TO THE RIGHT Worshipful his very good Patron, ROVVLAND TRAPS Esquire, the
Author, wishes all true happiness, both temporal and eternal in the Lord
Jesus.
COnsidering with my self (Right worshipful) how much I am bound to glorify
GOD, to whom I owe my self, and al whatsoever I am, and that in special sort
I am bound to seek the advancement of his name in that holy calling and
service, wherewith he has honored me, (the unworthiest of all other) in doing
good to his Church, and especially to those over whom he has set me, as a
guide to direct and conduct in the way that leads to eternal bliss and
glory; and considering withal mine own weakness and inability (more then
ordinary in other men) to answer that duty incumbent and lying upon me; I have
been moved, (being thereunto often and earnestly importuned by many, by whose
motion, the Lord seems to require it at my hands) to send forth this part of
my poor labors, to the view of all that shall please to look upon it, and so
to employ that talent the Lord has trusted me withal, to the greatest
advantage that I can, and to use the best means I am able, of furthering the
good of Gods Church, and hereby in some measure, to make supply of that, which
(through my known debilitie of body) is wanting in the discharge of my
Pastoral function. And howsoever these my poor labors be not worthy the
veiw of the learned and judicious, being simple, plain, and popular, both for
matter and manner, yet (I hope) they are sound, and without corruption, and
will not be unprofitable to the simple, and honest hearted, who want those
special endowments of learning, and depth of judgment, and yet are desirous
to be informed in the mystery of godliness, to their saving comfort, and
especially to those that are of my charge, whose profit in holy things, I
chiefly tender, and to whom my labors are most familiar, and principally due.
It grieves not me now again, to recommend to their eyes the things which
heretofore have been sent by their ears to their minds, and (I hope) to
their hearts; and though I cannot precisely say as the Apostle Peter did, I
know that the time is at hand that I must lay down mine earthly tabernacle;
yet that time being uncertain, and having had many times warning to bethink
my self of my uncertain continuance in this life, having sometimes received
the sentence of death in my self, that I should not trust in my self, but in
God, 2 Cor. 1.9.
who raises the dead; I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle to
stir them up by putting them in remembrance, and to endeavor that they may
be able to have remembrance of these things after my departing. 2 Pet. 1.13.15


In the Epistles of the blessed Apostle Paul, and in this, written to the
Colossians, most clearly and plainly men may see, and hear what the Lord
says to his Church, and what he requires at the hands of all Christians, both
for matter of faith, and of practice, and that both in general, and in
particular duties: yet in reading this and other Scriptures, it is not safe to
go alone, (unlearned and unstable souls pervert somethings in them to their
own destruction) a guide (as the Eunuch confessed) is of necessary use. 2
Pet. 3.16.
Act. 8.31.
I have therefore by these my poor labors, showed my self willing to be
helpefull unto such as stand in need of direction, and want better guides; and
I have endeavored to point out the way, whereby they may come to some measure
of right understanding and saving knowledge of that holy and heavenly truth
that is revealed in this divine Epistle, and my earnest desire is, that the
readers whosoever, would bring to the reading of these my slender pains,
humble and teachable hearts, and such as are pliable to the truth, and that
they would lay aside all preiudicate and forestalled thoughts, and partial
affections, E^hes. 4.15.
and set themselves both to seek and to follow the truth in love.

My method is not curious or hidden, but plain and open, and for the most part
one and the same, the simplest reader endued with any discretion, may observe
that the coherence, and parts of the Text being laid forth, the sense and
meaning of it is given (wherein I hope the Lord has directed me, according to
my desire, to find the right) and then doctrines are thence raised, which
being cleared and confirmed, and occurrent doubts removed, such use and
application is made, as my shallow brain conceived most properly, sorting and
suiting to the subject matter in hand, the heads of doctrines and uses, are
through out in the margent. Such as think my labors for their use, may please
to use them, and finding good by them, let them bless God for it, and yield
all praise and glory to him, to whom only of right it belongs; and such as
are otherwise conceited, I entreat to take my good meaning in good part, and to
leave them to others, who like better of them, and my self to stand or fall to
mine own Master, Romans 14.4.10
before whose judgment seat we must all one day appear.

And now (right worshipful) since it pleased the Lord to make you the means
of giving me a comfortable access to my charge, (wherein I have exercised my
Ministry this ten years, and upwards) howsoever in much weakness, yet the
Lord vouchsafing strength, above, and beyond mine own expectation, and the
conceit of others, for which (as I am ever bound to praise the name of the
Lord) I do freely, and thankfully acknowledge your undeserved love and favor
toward me therein, and resting assuredly upon the continuance of your wonted
love and kindness to me ward, I make bold to shelter these my poor labors
(being part of my pains taken in my charge) under your name and Patronage; I
doubt not but as my self have found you a kind and friendly Patron, so these
my labors coming unto you submissiuely (as they do) shall find your
favorable countenance toward them, and you will be pleased to vouchsafe them
your best protection. Accept (I pray you) this poor mite I now tender unto
you, in stead of some rich pledge of my unfeigned love and thankfulness. I do
heartily wish, and earnestly desire of the Lord, that as you have been the
means (in some sort) of the being of these labors of mine, so they may
return unto you in way of thankfulness, some spiritual good, which I hope,
they shall, the Lord blessing your careful and frequent perusal of them.

Thus being loath to be tedious and troublesome unto you, I commend this silly
present to your favorable acceptance, and your self, to the gracious
protection of the Lord, 1 Timothy 4.8.
who grant you ever that grace that has the promise, both of this life, and of
that which is to come. So I pray, and will (God willing) not cease to pray for
you.

From Barmondsey near London, March the 6th. 1614. Your Worships to command in
the Lord. EDWARD ELTON.

AN EXPOSITION of the Epistle to the Colossians, delivered in certain Sermons.
CHAP. I
VERSE. I. Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus
our brother.


THIS Epistle was written by S. Paul, The general resolution of th^s Epistle.
The time and place when this Epistle was written. The occasion of the writing
of this Epistle.
when he was prisoner at Rome. The occasion of the writing of it was a report
brought unto him concerning the estate of the Church at Colosse, that after
they of that Church had been converted by Epaphras to the faith of Christ, and
instructed in the truth of religion, according to the doctrine of the Apostles,
they were in danger to be seduced by false teachers, raised up by Satan, who
sought to impose and thrust upon them the observation of circumcision and
certain rites of the ceremonial law abolished by Christ, and to entangle them
by many philosophical speculations, and to bring in the worship of Angels, and
many other sorts of will worship devised by themselves. The Apostle hearing of
this imminent danger like to fall upon them, was induced to write this Epistle
unto them, as an Antidote against poison, and a remedy against these evils.
The sum and substance of this Epistle The sum and substance of this Epistle.
is thus much: That the Colossians ought to continue constant in the doctrine
of says delivered unto them by Epaphras, and to avoid the corruption of
flattering novelties and deceivers, and to join to constancy in faith, study,
care, and practice of good life; to which purpose he subioines many
exhortations both general and special. The division of this Epistle.
The material parts of this Epistle, besides the Proeme and the Conclusion,
are two

The sum and division of the first Chapter.
And to omit further subdiuision, this first Chapter contain, four parts: The
first is a comprehension of such things as are premitted in the first and
second verse. The The argument and subdiuision of the first part.
containing things premitted, therein is offered to our consideration the
sender of this Epistle, the parties to whom it was sent, and the salutation of
them. The sender in the first verse, Paul, who ioineth to himself Timothy a
brother. And he describes himself by his office and the efficient cause of
it, that he was an Apostle, and designed to that office by the will of God.
The parties to whom it was sent, are set down in the second verse, namely the
Colossians, who are set out by three epithites, Saints, faithful, brethren,
and all these in Christ. Then follows the salutation in the last words,
wherein the Apostle wishes and prays for two things to be given, Grace and
peace, and both these from God the fountain of all good things, and from him
as he is our father in Christ, and from the Lord Jesus Christ the Mediator, by
whom all good things come. And so much be spoken in general of the first part
of this Chapter. Come we now to speak of the first verse of this Chapter.

Paul an Apostle. Paul described by his office.
] The word Apostle in general acception signifies one sent as a Messenger: in
the New Testament with this addition [of Jesus Christ] it signifies more
specially one called immediately by Christ to preach the Gospel, and by him
sent to the whole world, without limitation, and to that end furnished with
understanding and knowledge of the Gospel, and doctrine of salvation,
immediately by the inspiration and revelation from the spirit of Christ, having
infallible assistance and testimony of the holy Ghost, that he cannot err in
executing his Apostolical office, and having also the gift of working miracles,
of conferring the holy Ghost by laying on of hands and of correction, as Peter
corrected Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5. The meaning then of Paul in saying an
Apostle of Jesus Christ, is this, that he was thus called to be an Apostle thus
furnished, and had this assistance, testimony and power by the will of God,
that is, by the eternal counsel and purpose of God, who as he says Gal.
1.15. separated him, etc. The words then are thus to be understood, that Paul
was immediately called by Christ to the office of an Apostle, and sent by him
to preach the Gospel to the whole world, and to that end furnished with
knowledge of the doctrine of salvation by immediate inspiration of the spirit
of Christ, with the infallible assistance of the spirit, and designed to that
office by the eternal counsel and purpose Every true teacher is able to show
his commission.
it is to be marked that Paul here stands upon his office and calling, that he
is an Apostle immediately called and sent, and this he does almost in the
beginning of every one of his Epistles, to put a difference between himself
and false Apostles; whence only note we thus much, Note.
that all true teachers are able to show their commission that they are
lawfully called and sent to preach, that they have both the inward and outward
lawful calling. Christ himself took not on him the office of Mediator, nor
the office and honor to be made the high Priest, but as he was called to it
of his father Heb. 5.5. Much less ought any to take on him the office of a
public teacher without lawful calling. And therefore it is Anabaptisticall to
think that any man that will may preach without special calling. A word is
sufficient of that point. In that Paul was an Apostle of Jesus Christ, one
immediately called and sent sent by him to preach the gospel, it follows
upon this necessarily, that his doctrine delivered in this, and in his other
Epistles, is heavenly, and is to be embraced, believed, and followed as the
doctrine of Christ Jesus. For why? his doctrine being given by inspiration of
the spirit of Christ, both for matter and manner, he teaching as he was acted
and moved by infallible assistance of the spirit of Christ, it must needs be
the undoubted oracle and immediate word of Christ, and so to be received. Paul
therefore gives thanks to God on the behalf of the Thessalonians, These.
1.2.13. that they received of him and other Apostles the word of the preaching
of God, not as the word of men, but as it was indeed the word of God.
Objection. Paul spoke and delivered some things in writing not given by
inspiration of the spirit of Christ, but of himself, as he says to the
remnant I speak, 1. Cor. 7.12.
and not the Lord, and therefore some things recorded in the Epistles of Paul
are not to be received as the word of Christ.

Answer. Paul there delivered, but he by collection and interpretation of the
Scripture did gather it, and so speak not of himself, but by the assistance
of the spirit of God, as we find in the 40. verse of that Chapter and so
notwithstanding that it remains a truth that the doctrine of Paul and of the
other Apostles of Christ is heavenly and simply to be believed, and obeyed as
the doctrine of Jesus Christ.

This may strengthen us against the poison of all other Anathema. The ^eachers
of the Church of Rome can show no warrant for their calling. Gal. 1.8.9.
If any man or Angel preach otherwise etc. hold and adiudge him accursed; and
let this arm us against all the devised doctrines of the Church of Rome, for
let that Church prove unto us that their teachers have apostolical power and
authority the same that the Apostles of Christ had and the infallible
assistance of the spirit of Christ in that they teach differing from the
doctrine of the Apostles and then we shall have some reason to condescend to
their opinions and to receive their unwritten traditions; but if that be a
privilege and prerogative belonging only to the Apostles the planters and
first founders of the Church of the new Testament, and not descending and
passing by succession to any other (as indeed it is) surely then we cannot hold
their ordinances and traditions being (at the least) diverse from the
constitutions of the Apostles any other thing then mere inventions of their
own brains. Luke 10.16.
He that hears you hears me so that their traditions and ordinances are not
appointed by mere humane power, but by the holy Ghost joining with their
teachers in the regiment of the faithful. A fair color and gilding set upon
a rotten post.

To answer them and their allegation ( He that hears you, hears me etc.) it
is true indeed that he that hears the Apostles and such as follow them in the
office of teaching, the pastors and teachers of the new testament hears
Christ, but how? surely so long as they teach nothing but that Christ has
taught. Christ has not assured us that whosoever hears men (though called to
teach) hears him simply whatsoever men teach; but so long as men preach Gods
word, and doctrine thence grounded, and that appears, Ioh 14 26.
the comforter (says Christ) which is the holy Ghost, there Christ promises
that his spirit shall suggest and bring all things to the minds of his Apostles
and their followers which he had taught them, not any new doctrines or
revelations; they then that speak any thing of their own contrary or diverse
from the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles in the new testament, falsely
pretend the holy Ghost, and let the Church of Rome set what gloss soever they
can upon their unwritten traditions, they cannot free them from being found
mere humane inventions, and their worship built upon them, unreasonable and
foolish, for devised worship must needs taste of the vessel whence it came,
the brain of man, full of ignorance and folly in matters concerning God and
Paul and to whatsoever is taught agreeable to the same, All reverence is due to
the doctrine of the true ministers of the Gospel.
as to the doctrine of Jesus Christ, as if Christ should speak immediately from
heaven, for the ministers of the Gospel being the Ambassadors of Christ and
speaking in his stead as we have it, 2. Cor. 5.20.
and being faithful and delivering nothing but the revealed will of Christ are
to be heard as their Lord and master Christ Jesus whose messengers and
Ambassadors, they are. Quest. Peter has told us: 2. Ephesians. 3 16.
in the Epistles of Paul somethings are hard, etc. and there is difference of
expositions of the writings of the Apostles: How then shall we that are
unlearned know what doctrine is agreeable to the true meaning of the holy
Ghost, in the writings of the Apostles? I answer Paul be hard yet the way and
means to come to the true understanding of them is to read and hear them
diligently, to mark them attentively, Note.
to pray heartily and to judge humbly. But for more special direction to know
what doctrine concluded out of the writings of Paul is agreeable to the meaning
of the holy Ghost in the same, we must remember two things which by diligent
reading and careful observation any one may easily find in the writings of the
Apostle. First that the whole teaching of the Apostle does run upon Christ his
whole doctrine, 1. Cor. 3.11.
as a structure or house is built on Christ the foundation as himself
speaks, no man more advanced the glory of Christ, euincing and proouing
justification and salvation in and by him alone, and none more withstood such
as preached the law or intermingled the law with the Gospel in the matter of
justification then he did, we preach Christ etc. and Chap. 2.2. I esteemed, 1.
Cor. 1.24.
etc. and many like sentences we find in his Epistles he runs almost in every
line upon the name of Christ and the advancement of his glory. The second thing
to be remembered is that in the doctrine of the Apostle concerning the worship
and service of God, which we are to perform in way of thankfulness for his
mercy, Romans 12.1.
the Apostle does urge upon us inward holiness and spiritual worship and
service. I beseech you, etc. and in this Epistle he much condemns external
worship and worshipping of Angels and commends unto us inward holiness and
spiritual worship. By these two general things remembered we may easily
discern who expound the writings of the Apostle aright and derive doctrine
from thence consonant to the meaning of the holy Ghost, (namely) they, who with
the apostle preach Christ with all due respect of his glory in the work of
redemption and salvation, and without any impeachment or derogation from him in
regard of his kingly, priestly, or Prophetical office, they that teach Christ
in all things to have the pre-eminence as it is verse. 18. of this Chapter, and
propound spiritual worship and service of God standing in mortification of the
flesh and newness of life, and that these are essential notes of true
doctrine we find them laid before us by S. John in his first Epistle the
fourth, in the trial of spirits in discerning the spirit of truth from the
spirit of error, he teaches that the doctrine is good and of God that is
founded on Jesus Christ incarnate, and holds the truth of his incarnation. And
secondly that propounds spiritual worship of God for says he verse 5. false
teachers and Antichristian spirits are of the world and speak of the world,
they are earthly and carnal they teach a plausible and pleasing worship
fitting the folly and corruption of man's nature, consisting in bodily exercises
rites and ceremonies, things of great estimation and admiration in the world;
on the contrary the teachers and spirits that are of God, even in outward
actions of religion require inward heavenly and spiritual worship of God
agreeable to the will and nature of God standing in true faith of the heart,
true contrition of the soul and other fruits of Gods spirit. By these two
notes, namely preaching Jesus Christ incarnate with all due respect of the
honor of his name as ^^e only king, Priest, and Prophet of his Church, and by
propounding spiritual worship of God we may easily discover the exposition and
doctrine concluded from the writings of the Apostle, which is most agreeable to
the meaning of the holy Ghost in these writings and having found the truth we
are to cleave unto it, and to yield reverence, faith and obedience to it as to
the doctrine of Jesus Christ. So much touching the description of Paul by his
office. The description of him from the efficient cause of his office. Note.
Now to the efficient cause of it in the words following, (By the will of God;)
we are to mark that the Apostle in setting down the efficient and first true
cause of his Apostleship, excludes his own will, that he was called, to be an
Apostle and sent to preach the Gospel not by his own will, but by the will of
God. He had no such will or disposition, in himself, no doubt he was
unwilling, but the Lord who in his eternal council had appointed him to that
office in his good time by his grace called him and of unwilling made him
willing, and even then when he was a bloody persecuter, the Lords will God
brings his purpose to pass for the good of his children oftentimes when they
are most auerse and repugnant. Exodus 4.13.
See then how the Lord brings his purpose to pass for the good of those that
belong to him, in their advancement to some good place and calling even then,
when they themselves are most auerse, unwilling, repugnant and utterly against
it. We read when Moses showed himself most backward, pleaded excuse and
entreated the Lord to send some other then the Lords will was effectual to
advance him to that honor to be the messenger to Pharaoh to deliver Israel to
have the leading and government of a mighty people. We find the like of Jeremy
the Prophet in the first Chapter of his prophecy, and when Jonah the Prophet
flatly refused to go to Nineveh, and as he thought fled from Nineveh, then the
Lord ouerruled him and advanced him to be a means of the repentance of that
City, as we read in the prophecy of Jonah. Use. Does the Lord by the
effectual Strength to our faith that the Lord will assist us in our lawful
callings.
even then when they are carried in a contrary course. Let this then in the
first place strengthen our faith in his providence and goodness, that when we
are called and set in any lawful calling and go on with good conscience in
that calling, the Lord will assist us and help our infirmities. For does the
Lord call to any service and not give strength to perform it? yes doubtless
though we find our infirmities still resting upon us, yet if we hold on a
constant course in that calling we shall find supply of strength. The Lord
could (if it had so pleased him) have made Moses eloquent but he did not, that
his glory might more appear, yet he was with his mouth and taught him what to
say as he promised. Exodus 4.12.
Moses found continual aid and assistance and supply of his want from the
Lord, and thus shall they that go on with good conscience in a lawful Gods
providence watches over his children when they full little think of it.
to a place and dignity clean contrary to their meaning, will, purpose, and
course of life formerly held? then let all Gods children learn for their
comfort that Gods providence watches over them for their good, when they full
little think of it, full little did Paul think when he breathed out
threatenings and slaughter against the Church of Christ that he should have been
a preacher of his Gospel, but that good will and providence of God over his,
ever waketh and never sleeps, though they sleep, and never think of any such
thing, nay please themselves in a contrary course, yet his providence is
working for their comfort, health, life, advancement unto honor, etc. do not
many natural things make this a clear point and preach thus much unto us?
grows not the grass and corn when we sleep, and the best herbs for our
health and use? Come not sweet shewers when we sleep that make husbandmen
rejoice and sing? and many other things make it manifest that the good
providence of God watches over his children for their good when they full
little think of it; Hest 6.
excellent is that story of Mordecai to this purpose. We there find that king
Ahashuerosh when he could not sleep commanded the Chronicles to be read before
him and finding there the loyalty of Mordecai that he had discovered a treason
intended against him and yet had no honor nor dignity given him for that
discovery, the king presently thought how and which way was fit to honor him
and it was concluded by the advice of Haman (who thought that the honor
intended would have light upon himself) that Mordecai should be apparrelled
with royal apparel etc. as follows in the Chapter. Poor Mordecai no doubt
was a sleep when this was concluded, and little thought of any such matter,
but the good providence of a gracious God that never sleeps sent this
comfortable mercy to his child for his honor and for the good of the whole
Church by his advancement. Oh then let this and the like examples teach us that
Gods providence watches over us for good when we little think of it, and that
our good God purposes to as many as be his children, such good as we can
hardly imagine and let us never fall from this God by distrustful fear, that
so cares and provides for his when they are asleep, and when they run on
in a contrary course. We are further to mark that Paul rises up and ascends
from his calling to the will of God, that he was now called to be an Apostle
and being called he knew the Lord had before in his will and purpose appointed
him to that office, for he knew not this but by the event: whence arises this
doctrine that Gods will revealed either by scripture or by particular events.
or by particular events, by the issues and falling out of things good or evil,
for it is certain that nothing comes to pass but by the will and providence
of God, if it were otherwise the Lord were not almighty, which is not to be
imagined, when therefore anything is come to pass Gods will is therein
revealed. For example when a man's house is burnt and his goods consumed then
Gods will and pleasure is revealed touching the loss of such things as Job
said. Job 1.21.
The Lord has taken because the Lords will was manifested in the loss of his
goods.

Object. Answ. by God. Isa. 45.7. Amos. 3.6.
But for the evil of sin we must consider a difference between sin it
self and the event of sin, or coming to pass of sin, the first of these
is evil, and the other good in respect of the end, to which it is by God
disposed, namely his glory in the manifestation of his justice and mercy. Now
God wills not sin it self, but the event or coming to pass of sin, but
how? not by effecting it, but by withholding his grace from the creature, and
not hindering it when he might if he would and so ex consequenti, God wills
the event of sin he not hindering it willingly permits it to be done for a
good end, even his glory, for the manifestation of his justice and mercy. Use.
Knowledge of Gods will for faith. Fact is from the word of God, and of
particular good and evil by the events.
both things to be known believed and practiced, look then into the word of
God. Would we again know his will concerning particular good or evil, to come
upon the outward estate of our selves or others, then tarry we the time the
Lord has appointed to discover and make it known unto us by event. It is
exceeding rash and hasty boldness in some, who dare go about to search the
will of God in things to come, by the help of wizards, witches and diabolical
means, yea a thing more frequent and common, and as wicked and damnable it is,
that some many times gather arguments of life or death, of good or evil
success upon their actions and business, by the flying or crying of birds, by
bleeding of the nose, burning of the ear, falling of salt, by dreaming etc.
This is a great abuse and profanation of the works of Gods providence, the
Lord has not appointed these things to manifest his will in things to come to
be ominous or to portend good or evil, and to observe them to that end, is a
superstitious device of men seduced by Satan, Note.
without any Christian or natural reason. The Lord sometimes suffers the event
to answer the foolish observation of such as give heed to these things in
judgment because they give heed unto them, Deuteronomy. 14.
and by that means the Devil steals out of their hearts that assured trust
in the providence of God, which is the chief stay of true believers amidst the
troubles and disorders of this world, and so, as the Preacher says, as the
fishes are taken in an evil net, Eccles. 9.12.
and as the birds are caught in the snare, so are they snared in the evil time
when it falls upon them suddenly, they know not which way to turn themselves
and to wind out of that trouble, nor whereto find comfort, remember we what
we find to fear God aright, Deuteronomy. 28.
and truly and then blessed shall we be at home, abroad, in town, in field,
in basket, in dough, in sheep, in kine, etc. And contrariwise, cursed for want
of religion and the fear of God, for that is revealed to be the cause of Gods
curse, not because the Raven flew over the house, etc. Now further, Paul making
the will of God the efficient and first cause of his Apostleship, that being an
outward state and condition of life, this general conclusion follows: from
hence that the will and Gods providence is to be seen in the distinction of
men into several callings
and is to be seen in the distinction of men into several callings, in
ranging men into several orders and degrees, disposing some to be Apostles,
some Rulers and Magistrates, etc. For howsoever it seems to be against nature;
that whereas all men are of one nature, sprung of one original, alike subject
to death, there should be so great inequality amongst them, yet herein
shines forth the wonderful providence of God, who out of so sundry orders and
degrees of men does gather a sweet harmony and agreement, for the maintaining
of he fellowship and society of mankind, without which it could not stand, for
one could not endure and bear another, there would range many outrages,
unless men were held in with the bridle of some greater authority and power,
yea more then this, the providence of God does clearly show it self, even in
the confusions and disorders that be amongst men distinguished into several
callings, when in the place where there should be Justice, there is wormwood,
and in the place of Judgment wickedness, yet therein appears the providence
of God, who does wisely order and dispose things so disordered and entangled to
a very good end, namely, the preservation of the society of mankind: for it
is a true position, better a tyranny then an Anarchy; better to endure
tyrannical oppressing Magistrates, then to have none at all: for that state
where there is no public power at all, but every man may do what seems good
in his own eyes, in stead of one tyrant makes many. Herein then appears the
providence of God, by disposing men into different degrees and callings, though
they be corrupt and disordered in their places, yet the Lord by his infinite
wisdom does order and dispose them to a good end.

A stay to our minds when we see disorders in men of place.
and authority, when justice and equity is bought and sold as though the Lord
did not regard: for certainly the Lords eye is over them in time to bring them
to judgment, and in the mean season as an excellent worke-master, who of
crooked and untoward matter frames an excellent work, does dispose them to the
preservation of society, and in that to the good of his Church. Eccle. 4.7.
It is the use the Preacher makes; If in a Country thou see, etc. be not
astonished, etc. stand not as it were at a bay in a careful and combersome
cogitation, as if God did not see or regard; for questionless he that is on
high, watches and wardeth over the highest, in due time to punish offenders,
and disposes of things confused and out of order, contrary to the nature of
them, to a very good end.

Every man's place and portion in this world is appointed by the will of God.
as Paul had his Apostleship by the will of God, so every man's place and
portion in this world is appointed unto him by the will of God; every man's
condition, whether high or low, rich or poor, public or private, is allotted
unto him by the good pleasure of God; for his will and providence guiding and
governing all other things, we may not seclude and shut it out from having
stroke in the conditions of men; no certainly, it is a general aphorism and
sentence of Scripture, that the Lord makes poor and makes rich, brings low
and exalts, and every man has his portion at his appointment: he made Joseph
Governor of Egypt, and he made Lazarus lie begging at the rich man's gate:
every one has his lot and condition, not by hap or chance, but according to
the ordinance and appointment of the Lord.

This doctrine ought to work in every Christian heart patience and peace,
Contentment with the estate we enjoy.
whatsoever it is: for as the common proverb is beggars must be no choosers,
and we are all beggars in respect of him who has the rule and disposition of
all things. Note.
Have I then little? it is the will of God I should have but little, and I
ought to be contented. Have I more? it is more mercy, requiring more
thankfulness, thankful for the one, and thankful for the other, and ever
contented with Gods will. And to that end we are to consider, first, that the
calling and condition we are in being appointed of the Lord, is the best state
and condition for us, if we be Gods children: for he willing our eternal good,
must needs will that is best fitting our service of him in this transitory
passage. Secondly, we are to consider what a clog and hinderance to good du^ies
coffeehouse is: they who are discontented with their state can never do
their duty in their place and calling, their minds are happled and enthralled.
1. Tim. 6.9.
Lastly, consider that the outward blessings and good things being no sure
signs of Gods favor, if we be not content with them, it makes it plain,
that we are not in his favor, though we abound in outward good things: for to
his children with the things themselves he gives quietness and contentment,
wealth without woe, store without sore, and as we use to say, it is the speech
of Solomon, Psalm 2.27.2. Pro^ ^ 2
Coffeehouse is left to godless persons, who are ignorant of Gods
providence, so then let these things stir us up to quietness and
contentation, our dwelling here or there is by the providence of God, in a
fair house or a foul: our condition of life, be it a rich trade or a poor,
is by his appointment; wheresoever or howsoever, it is above our merit or
desert, we therefore ought to be pleased and thankful. Now in that Paul ioines
Timothy a brother to himself in the writing of this Epistle, Paul and
Timothy joined together.
he did it no doubt both to show that he wrote no private opinion of his
own, but such things as had consent of other true teachers of the Gospel, and
also the better to move the Colossians to receive his Consent in true doctrine
is an excellent thing.
and much to be regarded; when teachers meet together in one truth, as Paul and
Timothy did, it is a thing of great use and consequence; for besides this,
that it does free the teachers from the note and blemish of lightness and
newfangled giddiness, and that they teach not opinions of private fancy, 2.
Cor. 1.17. 1. Cor. 14.32.
as Paul reasons for himself, and proves himself to be free from lightness,
it shows that they follow the rule of the Apostle Besides this, it is of
excellent use in respect of the hearers, who if they be unbelievers, not yet
brought to the faith, are thereby moved to faith and obedience, as the Apostle
says, 1. Cor. 14.24.
if all jointly prophecy, etc he is rebuked of all, etc. which argues consent
of those that rebuke, and then mark what follows, he will fall down on his
face, and confess that God is in the teachers, and so be moved to believe. If
the hearers be such as already believe, then consent of teachers is a special
inducement to constancy and perseverance, and serves much for the further
building of them up in faith and holy duties. As in the raising up a material
building, joint labor of many hands rids much work, when men's hands work
together jointly and cheerfully, then the building goes well forward, so in
the spiritual building of the Church, it must needs be a notable furtherance
of the work of that building, when the builders take pains together with
consent and good agreement. This we are to contend for, by earnest and hearty We
are to pray for good consent among teachers.
for certainly the devil does hinder the building of Gods Church by nothing
more then by difference and dissentions amongst the builders. And seeing that
by Gods mercy we have in our Church consent in substance of doctrine necessary
to salvation, this ought to move us to constancy and continuance, and not to be
like children as the Apostle speaks, wavering and carried about with every
wind of doctrine by the deceit and craftines of seducing Popish inchanters,
for though they buzze into Consent in substance of doctrine in this Church
ought to work in us constancy.
) that there is great difference and dissent amongst us, and a marvelous
consent among them of their Church, yet they that are able to judge aright, see
and perceive the clean contrary, that we by Gods mercy differ not in matter of
substance but of circumstance, and their own writers of special note avouch
as much, Morton Apologia, Cathol. page 304. etc. seeing then all of sanctified
judgment amongst us, and some of our adversaries (truth breaking out of their
mouths) confess that we differ not in matter of substance, let not difference
for matter of circumstance make us begin to be cold and backsliding in matter
of substance, no doubt the end the devil drives at in our differences is
Atheism or Papisme, and he has attained his end in too many, let us strive to
disappoint him of his purpose, and to that end we are often to think on the
argument of the Apostle. That if we follow factions, some hold of one and some
of another, 1. Cor. 1.13.
we shall be brought to that exigent that we must either confess Christ to be
divided (a thing impossible) or our selves to be no members of Christ and that
we are carnal. Cor. 3.3.4.
So much of the first verse.

VERSE. 2. To them which are at Colosse, etc.
First, touching the parties to whom this Epistle was written, not to say any
thing of the place of the City of Colosse but to speak of the titles, The
parties written unto in this second verse.
and Epithites here given to the Colossians (Saints, and Faithful) the
meaning of the Apostle in giving these titles unto them is this, that he held
them such as were cleansed by the blood of Christ from their sins, and had
some measure of inward holiness wrought in them, and that they were such as
professed the faith of Christ and were the adopted sons of God in him, and
brethren and fellow heirs of life eternal. It is first to be marked that the
Apostle writes not to noble men, nor to rich men, no, nor to poor men, not to
any order, sort, degree or condition of men apart, but to all generally at
Colosse of what calling or state soever, stiling them with these titles
(Saints, and Faithful, etc.) the lesson hence is this that religion (as one
says) knows not ou^ Religion knows not our outward callings and conditions.
for therein the providence of God appears as before was showed, but it
respects not the outward states, and callings of men in propounding and
applying the doctrine of grace and salvation. All in Christ of what calling
state or degree soever are holy believing brethren as the Apostle says. Gal.
3.28.
There is neither Jew, etc. all are one in Christ Jesus there is no difference
nor inequality of them that be in Christ in respect of justification and
adoption; Revel. 22.11.
where the holy Ghost says he that is righteous, etc. or more righteous, if
there be some increase of righteousness and justification; then there are
different degrees and inequality.

Ans. The righteousness there spoken of is inherent wrought in them that are
justified which is a fruit of their justification in Christ; of that there may
be increase? some have a greater measure of grace and sanctification then
others, and accordingly shall have a greater degree of glory in heaven. But
that righteousness by which a man is just in the sight of God is not
increased, for that is perfect in Christ; and admits no increase; they that are
in him are equally just in the sight of God as one says well, he that truly
believes in Christ, is as just as he that has fulfilled the whole law; he
that believes in Christ has the perfection of the law and so cannot have any
increase, it is then clear that there is no difference nor inequality of them
that are justified and the adopted sons of God in Christ. This is full of sweet
comfort to all such as believe in Christ though they be base and of low degree
in the world, yet this doctrine tells them that they are the dear saints of
God and in the sight of God equal and fellows to the greatest, in respect of
justification and adoption. Let this comfort and encourage thee in every good
way. It is Comfort for godly poor professors.
that many such as are poor and not like to rise in this world as their state
seems most desperate in the eye of the world and in For careless irreligious
poor professors.
to drunkenness, to swearing, to railing, etc. and why? they foolishly think
that as they are on the ground and can fall no lower, so they cannot rise or be
in better estate then they are, and therefore care not what they speak or do,
nor what men think or speak of them; on that they would but remember, that if
they be in Christ though of mean condition in the world, yet they are equal
and matchable to the best and greatest brethren, to the most noble, and to
kings and princes, no doubt the consideration and comfort of this, settled and
wrought in their hearts, would raise up their minds to better thoughts they
would then think thus with themselves, though we be poor wretches and of
mean condition and despised in the world, yet this is a great and singular
comfort unto us, that we being in Christ, are as highly in Gods favor as the
best, we are as precious unto him as the apple of his own eye, we have title
to his heavenly treasures (which are) better then all the riches and treasures
in the world.

God the ^^ther and with his son Jesus Christ.

If then we have like precious faith with the Apostles, i^ by our faith we have
fellowship with them, yea with God himself, it must needs follow that they
err greatly who teach that the Apostles might be sure of salvation, but not
other christians, that the Apostle might say, I am persuaded, etc. but we may
not say so, Romans 8.38. Therefore other christians may be sure of their salvation
as well as any of the Apostles. 1. Epist. 5.13.
and that this is false and erroneous, mark but that one sentence of S. John
these things I write to you, etc. S. John writes to all Christians that they
may know they have eternal life, now knowledge as all define it, is a
determination or fastening of the mind to one part with a certainty. If
Christians then may know they have eternal life, they may be settled, they may
fasten their heart and soul to it with a certainty, so S. Paul speaks of
himself and all other believing Christians. We know, 2 Cor. 5.1. The
salutation of the parties written unto.
etc. eternal in the heavens, and what is that but everlasting life, so much
of the parties.

Now to the salutation in the words following. Grace, etc. Wherein the Apostle
wishes and prays for two things to be given, Grace and peace, both from God
the fountain of grace and peace, and from him not as an absolute God but as our
father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ the mediator, by whom all good things
come unto us; here then in this salutation two general things are to be stood
upon. Interpretation.
First the things wished and prayed for (grace and peace) secondly, from whom
they descend and come unto us. For the first, touching the fence and meaning of
the words, we find in scripture a twofold acception of the word. (Grace) it
signifies either the free and gracious favor of God whereby he does accept
and is well pleased with his chosen in and for Christ, giving them remission of
sins justification, adoption, etc. or grace given, the gift of grace wrought
in us by his spirit, in both these acceptions we find the word used in one and
the same sentence. Now here we are to understand it in the first signification
only, Romans 5.15.
as signifying the gracious favor of God; whereby he does embrace his chosen,
Romans 5.1.
and the word peace does comprehend both inward peace, tranquillity of mind and
conscience spoken of, and outward peace with the creature, as Angels and men,
yea with the beasts and stones as it is, Job. 5.23.
and outward welfare, prosperity and good success, for so we read, Joseph
asked his brethren of their peace, Genesis 43.27.
or as the word is translated of their prosperity. When therefore the Apostle
wishes grace and peace to the Colossians, it is as much as if he had said, I
wish you the free and gracious favor of God in Christ Jesus, and likewise
quietness of conscience in respect of Gods favor, and outward peace with all
the creatures, yea good success and prosperity in all things. Hence first we
are to mark that the Apostle in his wish and prayer for good to the
Colossians, gives the first place to the grace and favor of God, wishing them
first grace, then peace. The grace of God is the chiefest good thing to be
sought after.
It is the doctrine of our Savior, first seek, etc. David prayed thus, Lord
lift up, etc. as if he had said, therein is my chief joy and comfort, yea I
find more true joy and comfort in that, then in the increase of wheat and wine.
The Apostle says he counted all things, Mat. 6.33. Psalm. 6.7.
etc. that he might be found in Christ, and so in the favor of God, and there
be many reasons why we should thus esteem and be of the gives comfort and
consolation, yea it works such rest and rejoicing of heart as all the goods
in the world cannot yield. A man upon his death bed galled with a guilty
conscience would give all the world (if it were his) for the least dram of that
comfort Gods children find in the apprehension of Gods favor. These things may
serve not only to make known and to prove the truth of this, that Gods grace
and favor is most excellent, but also to affect and stir up our Christian
souls to breath and seek after it above all things in the world, and let the
consideration of the excellency of Gods favor in Christ stir us up to spend
both time and strength, not after the manner of the world, in hunting after
riches and pleasures, but that we may find some assurance of Gods favor
toward us, and to this end carefully use we the means appointed both to beget
in us faith in the blood of Christ, whereby we may be assured of it, as
hearing, reading, meditating in the word of God with prayer, and also to
ratify and confirm; the same, as a frequent and a reverent use of the
sacraments.

In the second place in that the Apostle ioines these two (grace and peace) we
are taught. Where there is assurance of Gods favor there is peace of
conscience and contrariwise.
Where there is assurance of the grace and favor of God there is peace of
conscience, where is no assurance nor persuasion of grace, there is no peace of
conscience, then being etc. the Apostle makes peace toward God, that is peace
of conscience, the fruit of justification by faith, that when by faith we are
assured of the remission of sins and Gods favor, then we shall have peace
of conscience. The reason and ground of this is, because Gods favor in Christ
does disburden the conscience of that thing that sets God and the conscience at
difference and enmity, and makes it accuse in the sight of God, namely the
guilt and burden of sin, and that being removed by grace, and the conscience
thereof persuaded, it must needs then be quiet and at peace with God and
excuse and comfort in the sight of God.

Therefore ignorant and impenitent persons have no true peace of conscience
let them know they have no true peace of conscience, because that springs and
grows out of this root, a certain knowledge and assurance of grace which
cannot stand either with affected ignorance or hard hearted impenitency; they
may have a drowsinesse or a sencelesnesse of conscience, as it is in benumbed
and seared consciences: but they neither seeing their sin nor feeling the
sting of conscience cannot have true peace of conscience, the feeling of sin
always Gods giving before that.

Therefore nothing in us by the grace and merit of it, can pacify the
conscience in the sight of God.
because grace only does release from sin and so quiet the conscience, then
how is it possible that any thing in us by the dignity and merit of it should
pacify and settle the conscience in the sight of God? how can it be as the
Church of Rome teaches, that any goodness or righteousness inherent in us
should of it self breed true peace of conscience, it is impossible that the
conscience should be quiet and ioifull unless it have peace through grace. For
admit this (which can never be proved) yet gtant this, that a man could aspire
and come to a perfect measure of love to God, even perfect in measure and
degree according to the exact rule of the law of God, yet could not that
perfect love procure remission of any one forepassed sin, perfect love in
degree by the condition of the covenant of works do this and thou shall live,
can only bring the recompense and reward of life, it cannot both procure life
and also satisfy for sins past; that is no part of Gods promise annexed to his
covenant of works, he says not, do this and thou shall live, and if thou
fail in doing this and break my Law, thou shall by other good deeds done
satisfy for that breach, no, the condition of perfect obedience in the moral
Law propounded, once broken, there can be no compensation nor expiation but by
punishment either in the person offending or some other in his stead, it is
without question that the active obedience of Christ was most exact, he in his
life fulfilled the whole Law of God, yet was not that legal meritorious and
most perfect obedience of his sufficient to procure remission of sins for then
he died in vain, he must over and besides that suffer death, even the cursed
death of the cross, and bear in his body and soul the extremity of Gods
wrath before he could satisfy Gods justice for the sins of his chosen, 1.
Pet. 2.24.
therefore it is said he bare our sins etc. we may then safely conclude
against the Papists that it is not love nor any other thing in us (admit it to
be most perfect) that can satisfy the Justice of God, and so settle, the
conscience, only the assurance of grace and of the favor of God in Christ can
do it.

Now in that the Apostle wishes peace to the Colossians We may lawfully and it
is our duty to pray for the peace of the Church.
understanding not only inward peace as has been declared, but outward
prosperity, we are taught that we may lawfully, yea our duty is to pray for
the peace and prosperity of the Church. We shall find through the tenor of
the whole Scripture, that if Gods children found comfort or rejoicing in good
things and blessings of God temporal or eternal, their care has been to use
all good means for the continuance of them, as David finding true joy in
beholding the prosperity of Jerusalem, Psalm. 1^2.6.7.
stirs up himself and others to pray for the continua^^e of it. Reasons why
we should so do are, first because we shall be therein like God himself, who
is said to rejoice in doing good to his Church. Secondly, we shall thereby
testify our communion with the Church, that we are members of it, and have a
fellow-feeling both of the good and of the afflictions of the Church, but a
more special conclusion following also from hence is this, We may also pray
for temporal good things, in particular. Iam. 5.14.
that as the Apostle prayed for peace, so it is lawful for us to pray for
temporal good things in particular for health, liberty, peace, plenty,
fruitful seasons, etc. is any sick etc. where we see the elders of the
Church sent for, are to pray for the health of the sick, by proportion we may
call upon God for other temporal blessings, examples are many to this purpose.
Moses prayed for victory against the Amalekites, Exodus 17.11. Genesis 17.18. Romans
1.10.
Abraham that Israel might live, and was heard, Paul for a prosperous iourny.
The ground of this is the promise of God, who has promised to preserve his
Church and Children in this life, and to supply their necessary wants, and
what he has promised we may lawfully pray for, Gods promise is the ground of
prayer; against this some take exception, Exception.
and say, we know not whether temporal good things will be good or hurtful
unto us. Therefore we are to leave them to be given at the pleasure of the Lord.
Two needful cautions.
because it is to be understood with some caution of necessity to be observed
in the practice of it: seek we no further then the words of the Apostle in
this place, where we have these two cautions offered to be thought on; first
that we pray good things received of wicked and graceless persons, give
nourishment to sinful lusts of the heart, which break out in pride, in
wantonness, in riot, and in many disorders. The use We are therefore to take of
the guiltiness of an evil conscience in coming by temporal things.
so as we pray for grace in the first place, and for grace with them that we
may use them well, let us take heed we set not a bar between our selves and
prayer for a blessing upon the temporal good things we enjoy, that is the
guiltiness of conscience in ill getting of them. For can a thief pray over
his booty that God would bless it? he cannot, no more can we pray for grace
and the blessing of God upon our temporal good things if our consciences tell
us we have gotten them ill. And so much of the things wished and prayed for by
the Apostle, etc. The fountain from whence things wished for do descend.
Let us come to see from whence they descend, and first they are said to come
from God the fountain of all goodness, and from him as a father. For the
right understanding of the words, we must know that by the word father is
principally understood the first person in the trinity, yet so as in heart and
mind we must conceive the Son and the holy Ghost. For it is a rule in divinity
that the word (father) is taken personally and by it meant the first person in
the Trinity, The word father taken two ways personally and essentially.
when one person is confered with another, as vet. 3. but when it stands in
relation to us it is taken essentially and to be understood of the father, Son
and holy Ghost, subsisting in the same Godhead and divine nature. Note.
Here by the way we may see how silly a shift it is that is used by the Papists
to elude and put of our argument from this word father against invocation of
saints, for when we reason thus (Christ has taught us to call on God the
father only, therefore not on Angel or Saint) they reply, this concludes not,
for if this stand good, Christ has taught us to call upon God the father, and
therefore not upon Angels and Saints, then this likewise is a good inference
therefore not upon God the Son, nor upon God the holy Ghost, the rule delivered
overthrows this exception, for in calling on God our father we call upon God
the father son and holy Ghost. God is our father three ways and in what sense
he is called our father. Luke 3.38. Gal. 4.5.6. 1. Pet. 1.23.
But for the better clearing of these words we are to know that God is our
father, three ways. First in regard of creation, so Adam is called the son of
God. Secondly by adoption in Christ, thirdly in regard of sanctification and
regeneration by the word and spirit. We are borne anew, etc. and so made sons
of God by, etc. in this place we are to understand the Apostle not in the first
respect, but in the second and third, that he prayed for grace and peace, not
from God our father by creation, but by adoption and regeneration: for as we
are Gods creatures only, and have no other privilege, we dare not aproach his
presence having defaced his image, and by sin fallen from our first estate of
creation. The words thus understood For comfort we may depend upon God with
full assurance seeing he is our gracious father in Christ.
For the first in that God is our father in Christ, hereupon all that be in
Christ are taught to repose their whole trust and assiance of their hearts in
him, to depend wholly on him for grace and mercy, and all good things. For why?
he is God all-sufficient able to command heaven and earth, to serve for our
good. And he is God our father willing to do us good, yea such a father as
cannot grow out of kind, and leave of to be kind, and tenderly affected toward
his children, Isay 49.15.
he can as soon cease to be God (which is impossible) as forget to do good to
his sons Can a woman. etc. though she could, yet etc. says the Lord to Zion.
We are not to doubt of Gods providence in the time of need.
Away then with all doubting of the good providence of God in the time of need,
if we which are evil yet in the nature of fathers provide good things for our
children, how much more shall our heavenly father provide for the good of his
children, it is our Saviors argument, Mat. 7.11.
and let not reason stand against it, god is our father who has given his own
dear son to die for us to make us his children, Romans 8 32.
how then shall he not with him, etc. that is the argument of the Apostle. Let
me join to these a third argument, God made himself known to be our gracious
and provident father, before we could know much less acknowledge our selves to
be his children, he formed us in the womb, he brought us out in due time into
the world, he provided milk in the breasts, nourishment and all things
needful for us, yea more, he entered into covenant with us (with as many of us
as be in Christ) to be our God and father, and we to be his children for ever,
he signed and sealed this covenant by the sacrament of baptism the solemn
seal of our adoption to be his sons and daugthers, all these he did before we
knew what was done unto us, and will he now forget to provide good for us, when
we know and acknowledge him, and by faith depend upon him? it is not possible,
let then the comfort of this raise is up to an assured trust at all times in
the providence of God our good and gracious father. Again, secondly For
comfort. God cannot see us to be long in trouble seeing he is our merciful
father.
are we his adopted sons and daughters in Christ, then let us know for our
further comfort that the Lord cannot long behold our miseries and afflictions,
without pity and compassion, our sighs, our groans, our sobs of sorrow, and
tears of repentance in time of trouble and distress, cannot long be
unrespected of the Lord, as a man of tender bowels cannot look upon his child
humbled, and upon his knees, and weeping before him, but be moved to pity and
toward him, much less can the Lord being the father and fountain of all
compassion and mercy. And to give further strength to this comfort see and
consider a notable patheticall speech of the Lord, Hosea 11.8.9.
where the Lord makes as it were a demurre and pause upon the matter, when he
was to execute his judgment on his people, and faith, how shall I give thee up
on Ephraim, etc. could ever father speak more compassionately over his child,
when he is about to beat him? surely no tongue can express the pity and
tender compassion of the Lord; now if the Lord have such a melting heart
toward his poor people, that when the rod is up, and he is ready to strike,
he holds his hand of himself breaking out into these speeches, how should I
do it? my heart i^ turned up and down in me, oh then what force have o^^
sighs and groans before him in time of our distress. If we be his children
how do our tears of unfeigned repentance flowing from a grieved heart, move the
Lord to pity? can he continue to strike us holding up our hands for mercy,
looking upon him with watery eyes, humbled in the dust before him, and for
Christ his sake begging pardon of sin, craving ease, comfort, and relief.
No, no, be assured of it, he is our father, a kind, a loving, a good and tender
father, he seeing our trouble and hearing our groans, will be moved to pity,
and not fail in due time to send comfort either of strength or deliverance,
let this comfort and cheer up the hearts of all the sons and daughters of
God in Christ. Now further in that God is our father, For duty.
fear, humility, and obedience toward him. If we call him father, 1. Pet.
1.17.
etc. as often as we open our mouths and call God our father, so often even of
our own mouthe^ the Lord shall judge us. We must carry the affection of
children toward God seeing he is our father.
If we neither live nor desire to live in the obedience of his children; as we
take comfort in God to be our father, so we must also carry our selves as he
may take pleasure in us to be his children, or else the word father in the
mouth and no duty of sons in the life makes God of a Father a Judge unto us,
and turns his favor into fury, his pity into plagues, punishments, and
judgments against us, yea our own mouths shall testify against us, and of
them he will judge and condemn us. Let us then take this profit by it, that
God is our Father, even to reform us daily as the Lord shall give grace and
strength into the obedience of children, and so much of the first author and
giver of grace and peace in these words from God our father. Grace and peace
come from our Lord Jesus Christ immediately.


Now touching the last words of this verse, the Apostle says, grace and peace
come from the Lord Jesus Christ, that is immediately, for grace and peace come
from God the Father as from the fountain, but by the mediation of Christ, and
it is to be marked that the Apostle calls Christ (the Lord) in general, not in
restraining the word (Lord) as standing in relation to his members as in the
next verse. Now Christ is called (the Lord) as having full power over all
things as being Lord of life and death, of Heaven, Hell and of all creatures in
heaven and earth, so we read, this power Christ has not only as he is God,
Act. 3.15. Act. 2, 36. and 5.31.
equal to his Father, but as man also by the donation and gift of his Father,
more shall be spoken of this title in the next verse. Now in that Christ our
Savior is Lord of life and glory, Christ is God coeternall and coequall with
his Father.
and remission of sins, we may hence conclude that he is God coeternall with
his Father, and coequall to his Father, and this is clear in many places of
the Scripture, and by his miraculous works, manifesting divine power, and by
the honor and divine worship given unto him both by men and Angels. This
serves strongly to strengthen our faith concerning the sufficiency of the
redemption rewroght by Christ.
teaching them that by the merit of his death apprehended by faith, they have
grace and peace, full remission of sins and perfect redemptiom from eternal
death and damnation, and so making them to rest wholly on his death, as a
perfect satisfaction to God for their sins, for why? Christ our JESUS who was
content to shed his blood for us, was not only man but God, and all the works
of God are perfect, therefore we need not seek for grace and peace,
satisfaction and remission of sins any where but in Christ. The works of
penance which the Popish sort hold able to satisfy for sins, which they
foolishly term venial, do mightily derogate from this one, full, perfect and
sufficient sacrifice of Christ once suffered upon the Cross, for which one
offering has he consummated etc. Heb. 10.14.
Christ who suffered was both God and man, united into one person, and by
virtue of his Godhead, Act. 20.28.
he gave power to his death to be meritorious and of infinite price and value,
the Church is said to be (...) ^od not (...) suffer or shed (...) Christ
^^ffered ^^dely as (...) union Christ being God and man in one person, it is
said that God shed his blood, noting and giving us to understand for our
comfort, the infinite merit and sufficiency of his death, that the person
suffering, being not meet man but God also, his death was a sufficient
satisfaction for our sins.

VER. 3. We give thanks to God, etc.
In this verse, the Apostle begins the preface to his whole Epistle, The
beginning of the preface to the whole Epistle.
and continues it to the twelfth verse, and it stands upon a congratulation and
a prayer. The congratulation from this third verse to the ninth, the prayer in
the verses following.

The general exposition of the Apostles congratulation and prayer.
The words of this third verse, contain the general proposition both of the
Apostles congratulation and prayer, that he and Timothy did congratulate and
rejoice and pray for the Colossians, his congratulation is expressed by the
manner of it, namely, a giving thanks to God, who is here described by
relation to Christ (we give thanks etc.) his prayer is set out by the time
(always) that whenever he prayed, he was mindful of them, and prayed for
them: these are the general things contained in this verse, wherein we are to
mark that the Apostle expressing his congratulation or rejoicing, by giving
thanks for good things, that thanksgiving falls into prayer, he begins in
thanksgiving and he ends in prayer; his thanksgiving begets and brings forth
prayer: The point hence arising is this.

One grace well used brings forth another.
one sin never goes alone but begets and brings forth another; so is on grace
attending upon another, and is linked and lapped within another, where grace is
well used it will increase, the things of this world, the more they are used
the more they are worn, but it is contrary in the graces of the spirit of God,
one of them begets and brings forth another, Romans 5.4.
as the Apostle says patience etc. we may observe it in our selves, that as
many as have hearts opened as Lidia had, Act. 16.14.
to attend to the word preached, that attending with care brings us to
understand the word, understanding and knowledge used begets faith and good
affection, those being stirred up and exercised, bring forth a proportionable
measure of obedience and practice, where the grace of attention and meditation
is is not used, it makes many good lessons fall as seed upon the pauement, and
makes men ignorant of some principal things wherein they have often been
instructed; We must make much of the least measure of grace. Mat. 25.29.
let them cherish it and use it, and it will increase as our Savior has
promised to him etc. And not to go from the particular here offered, if men
congratulate and rejoice with others for good things found in them, or use to
rejoice for good things bestowed on themselves temporal or spitituall, giving
thanks to God for the same, that rejoicing of theirs going up to Heaven in
thanks to God; from him will be sent down further grace, even the grace of
prayer and calling upon God, and from thence further feeling and comfort in
those good things.

Secondly, in that the Apostle gave thanks and made Religious invocation
belongs only to God.
we are taught that religious invocation standing in petition, and
thanksgiving belongs only to God, and this may be confirmed, besides many
testimonies of Scripture, by many reasons viz. the very instinct of nature
teaches, whom we make our God, him to pray unto; though the Heathen had many
gods, and so did not call on the true God, yet they thought none was to be
called upon but a God; they always call on him or them, whom they accounted
gods, Iona. 1.5.
the mariners being heathen Idolaters cried every man to his god, so that to
whom prayer belongs, he is God by opinion of the Heathen, yea the brute
creatures in their kind call on God etc. he gives food etc. in many verses
David exciteth all creatures to praise the Lord. Psalm. 147.9. Psalm. 148.
Secondly, Invocation is a sacrifice of the New Testament foretold; Mal. 1.11.
Heb. 13.15.
hence giving of thanks is called a sacrifice. Now all sacrifices are to be
offered to God only. Exodus 22.20. Act. 14 14.
He that offers etc. Barnabas and Paul rent their clothes etc. when the
people of Lystra would have sacrificed unto them. Thirdly, be able to hear,
understand and help them that pray unto him, yea he must have knowledge of
their hearts, because prayer is sometime, Exodus 14 15.
Suspirium cordis, but a sigh of the heart. Wherefore criest thou, says the
Lord to Moses, yet he spoke never a word. 1. Sam 1.13. Act. 1.24.
Hannah spoke in her heart etc. but God only knows the hearts, therefore to
God only must prayer be made. Last of all, Invocation and Faith must always
go together, it is the argument of the Apostle. How shall they call etc. Romans
10.14.
Now we must believe only in God therefore to him only must we pray,
Confutation of invocation of Angels and Saints.
it meets with the opinion of the Papists, who hold and labor to maintain
invocation of Angels and Saints departed, that opinion cannot stand with this
truth of God: but they endeavor to uphold their opinion by this reason; say
they it is lawful to call upon men living here upon the earth, while we live
together we may request one another prayers as Paul did, therefore it is
lawful to call on Saints departed, for say they, if it be not lawful, Romans 15
30.
then is it for one of these causes, either because they will not hear us, but
(say they) that is not so, because now they have greater love unto us; then
when they were on the earth: or because they know not what we pray for, but
that also is not so, because look how the Angels know the conversion of a
sinner and rejoice, so the Saints departed know it, or lastly, because injury
is done to God or to Christ, but this is otherwise, for then we might not
request men living to pray for us.

This argument has many branches. First I answer to it in general, that the
consequent is naught, we may request the living to pray for us, therefore we
may pray to Saints departed, because for the first we have both precept and
promise, for the other neither. Again, touching their proofs first it is
true, Saints departed have greater love, for love continues for ever. 1. Cor.
13.8.
Yet the love of Saints departed is nothing else but a constant unchangeable
and continual desire, whereby they wish eternal happiness and salvation to
the whole Church of God, and to all the faithful, and that the kingdom of
Christ might be perfected in all his members, thus we may grant that Saints in
heaven do pray for us that is, they wish well to the whole militant Church,
and to all the members equally and indifferently, but to say they pray for one
and not for another, cannot be granted, because it is contrary to that love
they bear equally to all, and further they are exempt from that feeling of our
particular miseries, which they had on the earth, because that would detract
from their perfect joy and glory, therefore we may not conclude from their
love, that they pray for any one in particular. Secondly, whereas they say, as
the Angels know the conversion of a sinner so the saints departed know it. We
answer, there is not the same reason why the saints departed should know it as
the Angels do; because the Angels are appointed ministering spirits and know
many particulars which happen unto us, Heb. 1.14.
and many of our private necessities, but the Saints do not, being always
absent, and yet worship, and consequently invocation of Angels is forbidden in
the second Chapter of this Epistle and eighteenth verse, therefore much more of
Saints they neither knowing nor hearing our prayers Ob. God reueales to them
what is prayed for; we answer again, this appears not by any place of
scripture. Secondly, to what end should we pray unto them if they know not what
we ask but by revelation (and to the last thing they allege we answer. That
it does derogate from Gods glory and from the perfect mediation of Christ to
call on Saints departed, whereas they except. Then to request the living to
pray for us, we answer as before, the case is not alike. First because we have
both precept and promise for the one and not for the other. Secondly, we make
not the living mediators, as they do Saints departed, but only request their
mutual prayers to commend our suites to Christ our head; they having a fellow
feeling of our wants, as we have of theirs, and so as members together, we send
up our mutual prayers unto God, and exercise our charity one toward another,
and so notwithstanding this cauilling of the Papists it still remains a firm
truth that invocation and prayer belongs only to God.

Now to the Apostles description of God to whom he gave thanks and prayed; God
is here described by relation to Christ, that he is the father of Christ our
Lord and Savior, God is the father of Christ as he is God, and as he is man.
the word (father) here standing in relation to Christ is taken personally as
before we noted, and that we may rightly conceive how God is the father of
Christ, Christ being both God and man, we must know that God is the father of
Christ in respect of his deity, by nature, because he is of the same eternal
essence with the father, begotten from all eternity, and so the only begotten
son of God, Ioh. 3.16.
and in respect of his humanity, not because he had substance of body and soul
from the substance of his father, but because as man he was conceived by the
work of the holy Ghost, and by personal union his humanity is assumed and
does subsist in his deity, Luk 1.35.
the word was made flesh, and thus God is the father of Christ.

Ioh. 1.14.
We are further to mark that God is the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, How we
are to conceive of Christ in respect of Gods chosen.
whereby the Apostle gives us to understand how we are to conceive of Christ in
respect of Gods chosen, as that he is their savior and their Lord, not only as
he is Lord over all creatures, but in more special manner, and that in a
double respect, first in respect of freee donation from his father, Ioh. 17.9.
secondly in respect of his work of redemption. Ye are not your own, for ye,
etc. and so much may serve for the meaning of the words. 1 Cor. 6.19.20
Now we are to mark that the Apostle gave thanks and sent up prayers to God,
not as he is an absolute God, but as he is the father of Christ, and in him a
father to all that belong to Christ. And this is the Apostles ordinary form of
prayer and thanksgiving in the beginning almost of every Epistle: Our lesson
hence is this, that our prayers to God must in like manner be offered up in the
name and mediation Prayers must be offered up to God in the mediation of
Christ only.
so one mediator, in his name only must we come to Gods throne. How the Papists
do cauil on this place it is known, say they Christ is the only mediator of
redemption, but the saints are mediators of intercession, this distinction is
most foolish, it makes the body not answer to the shadow, nor the truth
correspondent to the figures, for the high priest in time of the law was in
figure a mediator both of expiation by sacrifices, and of intercession by
prayers, 1 Timothy 2.5.
and did shadow and show, that in time of the new testament both these things
should be conjoined and meet together in Christ: again, it does rob Christ of
a great part of his honor belonging to his Priesthood, for Christ has not
only by his own sufficient sacrifice, consecrated, but sits also at the right
hand of his Father, to make request for them. Heb. 10.14. Rom 8.32. Heb.
7.24.25.
Christ his Priesthood is everlasting, therefore his intercession is
perpetual, it is the Apostles reason, and to this we may join other reasons.
First; we by reason of sin, and because of our unworthiness are all chased
from the throne of God, and we are not able to stand before the throne of
glory, till it be changed into a throne of grace, he therefore that is our
mediator and intercessor to go between God and us, must be able to take away
sin and to procure righteousness, life, and the favor of God. Christ only
is able to do these things, therefore in his name only must we offer up our
prayers. Again, he must be our mediator, in whose name we have promise to be
heard: Ioh. 14.13.14.
but in Christ only this promise is made, Whatsoever ye shall ask, etc.

Romans 8.26.
Object. the spirit it self makes request. and ver. 27. the spirit makes
request for the Saints, therefore Christ is not our mediator only.

the spirit makes request for us with groans, we may not take it that the
Holy Ghost is subject unto grief or passion, but that he does breath into the
hearts of the faithful, such motions whereby they do earnestly cry unto God,
he makes or teaches them to pray with most vehement desires, sighs, and
groanings: or hence is he said to make request for them as we hear it; Reu.
22.17.
The Spirit and the bride say (come) not that the holy ghost does pray for the
coming of Christ, but because he enflameth the Church with a vehement desire
of his coming: so it remains a truth, that Christ only is our mediator and
intercessor between God and us.

In prayer to God we must be far from a conceit of any worthiness in our selves.
are we to come to God in prayer, in the name and meditation of Christ alone?
must we hope to be heard and respected of the Lord only in, and for his
beloved son Christ Jesus, then it ought to be far from us, when we come to God
in prayers to be lift up in any the least conceit of any worthiness in our
selves though we be regenerate, and though we be the children of God and such
as fear God, yet must we not think to be heard for our faith, and for our
fear of God, if we do, we come not in the mediation of Christ, for to come in
his name and mediation is not only in word to call on God through Jesus Christ,
and to conclude our prayers with these words commonly used at the shutting up
of prayer (through Jesus Christ our Lord) but to offer up our prayers in the
merit of his death the price of our redemption, and that cannot stand with any
the least confidence in any thing in our selves. confidence of some thing in
our selves, we come to a God clothed with justice and judgment, ready to
power out his wrath upon us; happily some will say, may we not in our prayers
stand upon it, and plead it in the sight of God that we are his servants and
children: did not David thus. Psalm. 86.2. 2. King. 20.3.
Did not Hezechiah thus frame his prayer. I beseech thee O Lord remember, etc.
has not God promised to hear and and accept the prayers of his children?

Ans. David and Hezekiah in the places cited, the eyes of the Lord are upon,
etc. Thus far as many as truly fear God, Psalm. 34.15.
may use the benefit of a good conscience and their own integrity, to
confirm them in the promises of God made to his children, their consciences
bearing witness that they are such as truly fear God, they may hereupon
comfort themselves with assurance that their prayers are precious to the Lord.
That is the use of the fear of God in the time of prayer, we are not to plead
to be heard for the fear of God, but to assure our hearts by it to be
accepted in, and through Christ.

Again, the consideration of this may comfort us against Comfort against a
fiery dart of satan.
wherewith he many times troubles the weak, namely this, that they are
unworthy, vile, and wretched, the devil will go about to persuade them, that
they are so unworthy as they may not pray to God, nor expect any favor from
him, in this case the weak Christian may comfort himself, and raise up his
heart, and beat back the assault of Satan with this, that he comes to God not
in his own name, nor any other name, but in the name of Christ, and in him his
unworthiness is covered; in and by him, the throne of glory and Justice is
changed into a throne of grace, and therefore we are not to be driven away from
God, in regard of our unworthiness, but to be truly humbled for it, and to
bewail it, and in humble confession of it to come to God, who has promised to
have respect in Christ to such as are of broken and contrite hearts. In this
description (Father of our Lord, etc.) They that acknowledge Christ their
Jesus, must also acknowledge him their Lord. Mat. 11.29.
the point of instruction is this, that as many as acknowledge Christ their
Jesus, must also acknowledge him their Lord, that is the right faith in Christ,
we hold it an Article of our faith, we are taught as much by Christ himself,
that such as come to him by faith, and find comfort in him, must take his yoke
on them, how then do they deceive themselves, and feed upon a fancy, who will
have Christ to bear the burden of their sins, and yet never submit their
necks to bear his yoke, They deceive themselves, who will have Christ a
Redeemer but not a Lord.
they will have a portion in his redemption, but their own lusts must be their
Lords, they will be saved by grace, and yet live the life of nature, follow
after drunkenness and all manner of profaneness, as they are led by the lusts
of their own hearts, let such know that they are bewitched with a strong
delusion of the Devil, they set up a Christ of their own framing, and believe
not in Christ propounded and set forth in the Gospel, for let them think on
it with reason, can they imagine that they hold Christ their Lord, whom they
daily despite and crucify, I think they are not so fond and foolish. Now this
they do by their sins, who continue hardened and unrepentant in their
sins, therefore it is said, one day they shall see him whom they have
pierced, if men hold not Christ a Lord, Revel. 1.7.
they cannot hold him a Savior, for these two are conioined. If ever then we
would find comfort in Christ, we must learn to make him our Lord, and suffer
him to rule in our heart and lives. Now to the last words of this verse,
wherein the Apostle sets it down in general, that he prayed afterward,
expressing the particular matter of his prayers, and he settes it not down
barely, that he prayed, but together with it, the time (always) that is to
say, ever when he called upon God for himself he ceased not to pray for them,
as he says verse. 9 not to say any thing of the time here mentioned, we shall
speak of it more fitly, cap. 4.2. The point hence to be observed is this. In
that the Apostle prayed for the Colossians for whom he gave thanks, by his
example we are taught that we are to lift up our prayers to God, even then
when we have cause to praise God, when we have just When we pray to God we
have also just cause to praise him, and so on the contrary.
for why? besides this that there is no man, who has such measure of gifts and
good things, but that so long as he is in this world he has his wants, and is
to pray for a supply for them; besides this, prayer is a special means
sanctified and appointed of the Lord, to procure and to bring down his
blessing on good things for the continuance and increase of them: yea such a
means, as by it other means, which must not be neglected, receive a blessing
from the Lord, good means serving for the continuance of good things unto us,
used without prayer are commonly crossed and cursed, because the Lord cannot
away to be made a servant to flesh and blood, but being used with prayer they
are blessed and they prosper. Therefore prayer must reach as far as any
matter of thanksgiving, what things soever do minister matter of praise and
thanksgiving to the Lord, the same gives us just cause of prayer for a
blessing upon them, and we must take knowledge of this duty, and labor to
practice it.

In the time of want men will fall on their knees, Men are wanting in the
practice of this duty. Hos. 5.15. Exodus 5.1.
with some men, want is more forcible to make them pray, then the commandment
of God, the commandment came to Pharaoh, let my people go that they, etc. but
he in his ruff and prosperity answered, who is the Lord, yet afterward when
he was plagued, and his stomach beaten down with an iron rod, he confessed
the Lord, Exodus 10.17.
and desired Moses and Aaron to pray for him. Thus many in time of sickness,
trouble and distress will pray unto the Lord, but in time of health and
plenty, in time of abundance, they are hardly drawn to this duty, nay, then
they say unto God, as we have it, depart from us etc. men many times promise
unto themselves a perpetuity in their goods, Job. 21.14.15
as the rich man did, but we know the answer of God unto him, Luke 12.19.
thou fool, etc. and take we heed we deserve not the same title, would we
have sure and certain hold of good things, then pray we for the continuance
of them, let our prayer reach as far as we have matter and cause of
thanksgiving, even then when Gods blessing is on our Tabernacles, Job. 29.6.
as Job speaks, when we wash, etc. when we have the blessings of God in
abundance, then are we to be humbled in prayer, and because we are commonly
careless of this duty in time of prosperity, know we, that if we lift up our
hands and voices in prayer only, when we are under the hand of God, that
prayer is a prayer of nature, not of grace: for nature teaches the bruit beast
to groan under the burden, when we are pinched then nature teaches us to cry
for help, it is not a prayer of grace, and the free spirit of God, and such
prayer, may stand and go hand in hand, with wilful rebellion against God, the
Lord says, his people in time of a great dearth assembled themselves for corn
and wine, and yet they rebelled against him, Hos. 7.14.
if then we would have our prayer a free will-offering, and so pleasing unto
God as a sweet fruit of his own spirit, and a testimony of our free obedience,
we must be carried to a quick and ready performance of it, even then when we
have matter of praise and thanksgiving

Now come we to the fourth verse. Wherein are laid The things for which the
Apostle gave thanks.
namely, their faith and love with the proper object of them both, of their
faith, Christ Jesus, of their love, the Saints, and that generally toward all
the Saints, and this matter of thanksgiving is further amplified by the time
that since etc. that is the sum and substance of the verse; wherein first
observe we the things for which the Apostle gave thanks, and those were not
things of the world, outward things; but things spiritual, Our thanksgiving
to God in the behalf of our friends must be especially for spiritual good
things in the^ Heb. 6.9. 2. Cor. 7.
that our rejoicing and giving of thanks to God in the behalf of our friends,
such as we are bound to tender and more entirely to respect must especially be
for spiritual things in them, for things pertaining to Gods Kingdom, and such
as accompany their salvation, as the holy Ghost speaks, see we the Apostles
rejoicing in this kind in lively colors, he there says he was filled with
comfort, when he heard by Titus of their mourning, their fervent desire, their
godly sorrow and the fruits of that, his joy and rejoicing was altogether for
the graces of Gods spirit in them; his example ought to be our rule, we are
chiefly to rejoice for spiritual good things found in our friends, and the
reason of this is; not only for the excellency of these good things, being of
their own nature more excellent then outward good things, but because other
good things are by them sweetened, and made truly comfortable to our friends,
and without them, all other things are but so many waights to weigh down their
condemnation to make it more heavy and intolerable, unto them, we are therefore
to give thanks to God, especially for spiritual good things in our friends.

Now this is contrary to the course and custom of the world, it is amongst men
usual in token of their love, The course and custom of the world reproved.
the frugality and thrift of their children and frinds, but few or none for
their faith, love, repentance, humility and other spiritual gifts and graces,
this argues we savor the things of the flesh, and not the things of the
spirit, for as many as are regenerate and children of God, as they find
sweetness and comfort in spiritual graces in themselves, so they delight to
see them in others: and again they follow the rule of the Apostle, in all
things they give thanks to God, even in every creature, they find out some
thing wheerby they are stirred up to magnify the power, wisdom, and
goodness of God, much more do they find such matter of rejoicing and
thanksgiving to God in the renewed image of God appearing in their friends, in
their holiness, their fear of God, their faith, their love, etc. If then we
find that we can rejoice and give thanks to God for outward things, and not
for spiritual graces, it is a strong proof that our hearts are not yet
seasoned with grace, and the consideration of this ought to stir us up to the
practice Faith in Christ for remission of sins ever brings forth some measure
of love both to God and men.
faith and love are conjoined, we are taught that faith in Christ for the
remission of sins cannot but bring forth some measure of love both to God
and all that bear Gods image, for though true sanctified love be not as the
Popish learning teaches, the form of true faith, nor concurring as a cause in
the act of justification, yet is there a necessary concurrence and concomitancy
of faith and love in the person justified, true faith pleasing to God and
available to salvation, Gal. 5.6.
is ever fruitful and works by love in life and conversation, and we may
safely say it is as possible that the sun should have no light, the fire not
burn, or the reasonable soul (which is immortal) not live, as that true
faith and assurance of Gods mercy in Christ should not be fruitful in
thankfulness, in obedience, and in many good duties of love both to God and
man. Note.
Indeed love and holy obedience may be divorced from that faith which the
Papists teach to be true catholic faith, that being but a bare assent to the
truth of the history, and such as may be in devils, can brng forth nothing
but trembling, or at the most admiration and amazement, as at the sight of some
Pageant or strange wonder, but that faith which has the right seal and soul
of a justifying and comfortable faith, that is an affiance and trust in Gods
mercy in Christ, for the remission of sins and all other appendant blessings,
temporal and eternal cannot but send forth love and many good fruits worthy
amendment of life, it is then (for the use of this) a sophism, a deceit of the
flesh forced upon men, It is a deceit of the flesh to think that true faith in
Christ may be severed from true love to men.
and yet have not the least dram of Christian love to their brethren, this is
to think that faith in Christ for remission of sins and many sins may
dwell together, which is a thing impossible, they that thus think, never felt
the power of Gods mercy in Christ; and they are yet in their sins whose hearts
are possessed with such deceiving thoughts, 2. Pet. 1.9.
we must know it for a truth from the mouth of the Apostle.

He that does not join to his faith virtue, etc. he is blind and he has
forgotten that he was purged, etc. does he not remember nor think on the power
or the blood of Christ, which is able not only to wash away the guilt and
punishment of sin, but to purge out the corruption of sin, if we have a
right faith in Christ, if we have a right apprehension of the blood of Christ,
it will certainly make our hearts pliable and obedient to God, and tender,
loving and sincerely affected toward men. Can we think that any man's heart is
washed in the blood of Christ, and yet it remains full of the poison of
sin? no certainly, never was any heart bathed in the blood of Christ but
thereby it was suppled and made tenderly affected toward all the Saints and
members of Christ. Therefore let no man deceive himself in this point. Now to
the object of faith and love, and first of faith (Christ Jesus) where in a word
We never find in scripture mention of faith and trust in any but in Christ and
in God. Exception.
a phrase ever in scripture used to express true faith and affiance standing
in relation to Christ and to God, we shall never find mention of faith
affiance, and trust in any, but in Christ and in God. This I note to show the
strength of our argument, against invocation of Angels and Saints. Where we
reason with the Apostle, that we cannot call on them because we may not believe
in them. Exception. Exodus 14.31.
Now against this, exception is made by our adversaries the Papists. No say
they? may we not believe in men? why? what say you to that, they feared, etc.
Again, Romans 10.14.
do we not read in the Epistle to Philemon, the fifth verse, the Apostle says
he heard of his love and faith, etc behold say they, the Scripture teaches
faith in Moses, and faith in the Saints. Answ. 2 Chro. 20.20
We answer in that place of Exo. the words are not in God etc. but they
believed God, that is, they gave credit to the Lord and to Moses his servant,
they gave credit unto the word he had spoken unto them, ver. 13.14. and so
their own translation has it crediderunt Domino and Mosi etc. and cannot
otherwise be expressed in Greek or Latin, as their own vulgar interpreter
has well observed. The like place we have, hear ye me O Judah, and ye
inhabitants etc, believe his Prophets, that is, give credit to the words of his
Prophets etc. for the second place we answer, that any man who is not wilfully
blind, may see that faith is there referred to Christ, and love to the Saints:
again, the Apostle speaks of the Saints living not departed as appears ver.
7. therefore that place cannot make for Popish faith and belief in Saints
departed, neither can they find any place of Scripture so much as by
implication, teaching faith or trust and affiance in men be they never so
good, but rather the contrary, the Lord has set a curse on that man that
trusts in men. Ier. 17.5.
Now further touching True justifying faith is fixed and bounded on Christ
Jesus only.
Faith, trust and affiance, the object of it is said to be Christ Jesus, whence
we may gather that true justifying faith is fixed and bounded on Christ Jesus
only, though faith in a general signification being a word of relation,
respecting things to be believed, have reference to the whole word of God, and
have for the material object of it, every truth recorded in the word, yet as
it is an instrument of justification, it beholds the special mercy of God in
Christ: it apprehends Christ and his merits, the merit of his innocence, the
merit of the holy and perfect obedience of his life, the infinite merit of his
satisfactory death, and hence it is called the faith of Jesus, and this is to
be marked, because in this respect only is faith said to justify, Romans 3.26.
faith does not justify as a quality inherent in us, for any excellency or
merit in it self, nor any action of faith of it self, but only by relation
to the object, because it takes hold of the merit of Christ, and does
apprehend and apply his perfect righteousness unto us, as the hand receiving
gold or silver given, makes not rich, nor the work of the hand in the act of
receiving by it self, but the gold or the silver. So it is not faith nor the
work of faith that does justify, but Christ, whom by faith we apprehend, the
matter of our justification as the Apostle has taught us, God has made him to
be sin, 2. Cor. 5.21.
and this being so it must teach us.

First, to take heed of the doctrine of the Church of Confutation of the
Papists touching the manner how faith does justify.
not by relation to Christ the object of it, but as an excellent virtue
bringing forth many divine and gracious motions in our hearts, as the fear of
hell, love of God, a consideration and a desire of life eternal, and so
fitting and preparing us, and making us worthy ex congruo to receive grace and
justification, a doctrine devilish and dangerous, flat contrary to the truth
now delivered, and contrary to that opposition made by the Apostle, where he
opposes believing and working, faith and works, therefore faith as a work or
excellent virtue does not justify, Romans 3.27.28.
for then the Apostles opposition is overthrown, then believing and working
might stand together, which are made opposite Such as will be justified in Gods
sight and saved eternally, must renounce all things in themselves.


Again (for the second use) if faith do not justify as an excellent quality,
for any excellency or merit in it self, but only by relation to the object of
it Christ Jesus, then as many as will (indeed) be justified in the sight of
God, and eternally saved, must learn utterly to renounce all things in
themselves, and there is good reason for it, for if other qualities and works,
be so far forth good, as as they come from faith, and faith it self, as a
quality or work does not justify us in the sight of God, then much less can
any other grace or work do it; it is the pride of our corrupt nature to look
for justification, and salvation by some thing in our selves, if we live in
civil fashion in the world, and we hurt none etc. then we are lift up in a
conceit of this, and we think we cannot choose but be saved, thus the Devil
taking advantage of our pride, does teach men to encroach upon the doctrine of
the holy Ghost, for whereas he has taught that good life and honest
conversation serves only as an evidence and necessary proof of true faith in
the blood of Christ, the devil teaches to advance these things to a higher
place of dignity, Gal. 5.4.
even to shoulder out Gods grace and merits of Christ in our justification, but
we must know as the Apostle has taught us, if we look to be justified by any
thing in our selves we are abolished etc. faith in Christ Jesus and confidence
in good works cannot stand together, faith and good works ever go together,
and true faith is ever fruitful in good works, but faith and confidence or
opinion of the merit of good works cannot stand together. If we look to be
justified and saved by Christ, we must cleave only unto him, and utterly
renounce confidence of all things in our selves, we must judge our selves, and
condemn our selves in regard of any thing in us, and plead nothing but mercy
and forgiveness, we must go out of our selves and fix our faith upon Jesus
Christ, and be fully persuaded in our hearts, that his death is our ransom,
Sanctified love must be expressed in the fruits of it chiefly to such as are
sanctified and to all such.
build upon him as a rock that never can be shaken, and then the gates of hell
shall never prevail against us, and so much of the object of faith.

Now come we to the object of love, that is (all Saints) true sanctified love
coming from faith is to be extended in the fruits of it to all men, as they
are men bearing the image of God, but especially, to such as are sanctified and
renewed according to Gods image in some measure of holiness, and it must be
teached generally to all Saints, as the Colossians did, so we are not only to
love one or two or a certain set number, but all Saints without exception, we
are to bear hearty affection to all generally, and to express it in duties of
love, to as many as we are able (says David) Lord my weldoing etc. but to the
Saints, Psalm. 16.5.
and he speaks indefinitely, to the Saints that are here on earth and to the
excellent; reasons of this are these, first, all the Saints are members of one
body, and it is a law laid on the members of the natural body by the
providence of God, that what ability is given to any member, it should be used
for the good of the whole body, and of every part of the body? that the sight
of the eye should be used as well for the direction of the foot, as for the
guiding of the hand. So in the mystical body of Christ, what good practical
grace or affection is wrought in any, it should be extended to the good of the
whole body, and of every particular member of the body. Secondly, there is the
same reason and ground of love in every Saint of God; namely, the image of God
renewed, their holiness and fear of God, though not the same measure, they all
resemble God their Father in some degree of holiness, and show that they are
begotten of the immortal seed of his word, therefore love being bounded and set
on goodness, and that being found in some measure in every Saint of God, we are
to extend our love to all and every Saint and servant of God, but for the
better clearing of this point a question must be answered, namely, Answ. First,
then private persons, because they bear a double image of God, inward in
sanctified grace, outward in place and authority. Secondly, in equal
comparison, when men are equal in degree, we are then in the first place,
principally to love and show duties of love to Parents, children and such as
are conjoined and tied unto us by nature, or any outward bond of marriage or
friendship, because we are bound to love them by a double bond of nature and
of grace, grace does not abolish natural affection, but only order it and
dispose it aright, and so the question is answered and the doctrine cleared.

Partial love of other reproved.
that language and speech ought not be heard out of our mouths, I love such a
one even from my heart, because he is an honest man, but such an one happily as
honest as he I cannot abide, and it may be we cannot abide him, even because
he is one that in our conceit is too forward in the fear of God, are we not
in this case become partial in our selves, Iam. 2.4.
as if our love be thus partial, we love one Saint of God and not another,
let our pretense be what it will, that we love him, because he is an honest
man, in deed and truth we love him not as a Saint, not for God, and his graces
in him, but in some other respect either for pleasure or profit, it is not
possible for us to love one as a Saint and fearing God, but we must love all
that fear God, because all in their measure have in them that which is truly
amiable and lovely. Again, if we love some and not others, we make it plain,
we yet love not God, can we persuade our selves that we love God, and love not
some whom he loves, can a man say he loves his friend and yet hate any one of
his children, 1. Ioh. 2.20.
no certainly he cannot no more can we truly say etc. If any man say I love
God, and yet hate his brother, he is a child of him that is the father of
lies, c. 3. 10. In this are the children etc. Let then the consideration of
these things stir us up to put away partial affection, let us bear and show
hearty love to all the Saints of God, so we may have testimony that our love is
sanctified, and that we love God, and from thence may rise up to an assurance
of his love in Jesus Christ. Now to the fifth verse.

VER. 5. For the hopes sake etc.
In this verse, the Apostle does lay before us two things. First, wherefore it
was that the Colossians continued constant in their faith in Christ Jesus and
love toward all Saints. What was the motive that stirred them up to go on in
faith and love, namely, the hope laid up for them in Heaven. Secondly, the
means how they came to the knowledge of that hope, and that was by their
hearing of the Gospel, which is described to be the word of truth and their
hearing of this hope, by the preaching of the Gospel is further amplified by
the time that they heard of it, before the writing of this Epistle. Whereof
(says the Apostle) ye have heard before, come we to the first of these two
general things in these words, for the hopes sake, by hope in this place we
are to understand, not the gift or grace of hope wrought in true believers
following true faith, but the thing hoped for, the thing certainly expected of
all that truly believe eternal happiness, glory and life everlasting, and
that is clear out of the text it self, because the gift or grace of hope is
in the heart, but this is here said to be laid up in heaven: (laid up) that
phrase is borrowed from Parents, who lay up good things to be given in time to
come to their children, the meaning is that the Lord has as it were laid up,
provided and prepared life, happiness and glory in time to be given to his
children, so we find it in the last doom that Christ shall pronounce upon the
blessed of his father, Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom
prepared, etc. Mat. 25.34.
In heaven, that is in the place and seat of the blessed Angels and Saints,
whether Christ is ascended, and from whence he shall come to judgment, this
then is the true sense of these words, for the eternal happiness life and
glories sake, prepared of the Lord from all eterniry in time to be given you in
the highest heavens. Now first in that glory and life to come is called by the
name of hope, one of these is put for another, one to signify another, hope to
signify heaven.

True christian hope must not only have reference to life eternal, but must be
a resemblance of it.
Hence we may take up this conclusion, that true christian hope, or the hope of
true Christians must not only have reference to life eternal, but it must be a
resemblance of life hoped for, and in some sort be correspondent unto it: for
as in metonimicall and sacramental speeches, when one thing is set down to
signify another, there is a resemblance and similitude between those things,
as the bread in the sacrament resembles the body of Christ, so our hope put
for heaven, it must be a resemblance of heaven, it must in some sort express
eternal life laid up for us in heaven; how can that be, may some say? Answer,
by working in us even in this life a beginning of life eternal, by making our
life and conversation heavenly, or as the Apostle speaks, Phil. 3.20.
in heaven. Then is our hope a lively image fit to resemble life eternal, when
it is manifested in the beginnings of life eternal, when it is effectual to
turn us from sin to God, and to work in us newness and holiness of life.
And that true christian hope is such a resemblance of eternal life, and is
thus effectual and so ought to be in us. Mark that place of the Apostle, our
conversation (says he) is in heaven. Phil 3.20.
What is his ground? even our hope of the glorification of our bodies, and
fullness of glory at the coming of Christ, for he says in the verse following,
from whence, 1. John 3.3.
etc. we have a plain text to this purpose, says S. John, we know, etc. and
every man that has this hope, etc. whosoever has true hope he is thereby
stirred up unto daily repentance and reformation of life.

Now for the use Trial of our hope of life and salvation in heaven.
and we look for happiness, and glory in heaven by the mercy of God in
Christ. But would any know whether his hope be a true Christian hope or no,
such a hope as will not deceive nor disappoint him in time of need, no not in
death it self, let him then examine it by this note, if his hope be a
resemblance of life eternal, if it do express in his life the beginnings of
that life laid up in heaven in some measure of purity, holiness, innocence,
meekness, and love, etc. so that a man may say of him as we use to speak of a
child towardly and of an ingenious countenance, that he is optimae Spei one of
excellent hope, then his hope is indeed religious and christian, such as will
comfort him when the pangs of death are upon him. But if otherwise he say he
hopes for life and salvation, and yet be not able to show it in some
conformity, similitude, and likeness unto life eternal, but his life is
rather an express image of his natural corruption, his life is stained with
many foul sins, that man's hope is but a pretense of hope, and in the end it
will deceive and make him ashamed, can a man say and that truly, he hopes for
heaven, and yet his very breath stinkes of hell, he breaths and belches out
blasphemous oaths, railings, cursings, slanderings, etc. and has his tongue
set on fire with the fire of hell, as S. James says, third Chapter verse 6.
can any say that he looks up to heaven, and beholds the fullness of happiness
and glory in heaven, and yet his eyes are full of adultery as the Apostle
speaks. 2. Pet. 2.14.
We know we cannot see the sun when a thick cloud is before it, Mat. 5.8.
and can we imagine that we see the brightness of glory in heaven, through the
thick foggy mist of many sins? it is not possible, our savior has said it.
That only the poor in heart, such as are purged both from the guiltiness and
filthiness of their sins shall see God, shall see by their faith in this
life the comfortable beams of the Lords living countenance shining upon them
in Christ, and shall see him face to face, even the brightness of his glory to
their eternal comfort in the life to come. In the second place in that the
Apostle does testify that he heard of the constancy of the Colossians in their
faith and love; toward all Saints for the glories sake laid up for them in
heaven, we are taught that it is the The steadfast looking into heaven does keep
true believers in a constant course of religion.
it is that which makes them cleave fast to Christ. and keep fellowship and
communion with the Saints, for though we are not to depart from sin or do
good, for this end only or principally that we may obtain eternal life, for
then we shall never obtain it, because this end and purpose proceeds from
self love, though we are not to avoid evil or do good, chiefly in respect of
reward or fear of punishment, but in respect of Gods glory and our own duty,
yet in the duty of religion and love, we may have an inferior subordinate and
second respect unto the recompense of reward, and to make us constant in well
doing, life everlasting must ever be in our eye, at which we must continually
aim. We read that Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ, Heb. 11.26.
etc. for why says the text he had respect unto, etc. verse. 27. He forsook
Egypt, etc. for he endured, etc. He had his eye upon heaven, and upon God in
heaven, the rewarder of them that seek him, and by faith depend upon him, and
that made him lightly esteem the troubles and trialls of this life, and not to
fear the rage and fury of Pharaoh or of any man living. Would we then for use
We must learn to cast our hope as the anchor of our souls within the veil of
heaven. Heb. 6.19.
would we be constant in religion, and the fear of God, amidst the troubles
and miseries of this life, yea in the midst of many violent assaults and strong
temptations of Satan, then learn we to cast our hope, the anchor of our
souls, as the holy Ghost calls it, within the veil of heaven, let us lift up
the eyes of our minds and fasten them on that glory and bliss that is prepared
and laid up in heaven, for all them that love the appearing of the Lord Jesus,
then we shall be able to put upon us Jobs resolution, Though the Lord should
kill me, etc. and in the hour of temptation and pangs of death, we shall
cleave fast unto Christ by faith, Job 13.15.
and hold our communion with the Saints, it is not possible that such as
profess faith and religion, and yet mind earthly things, and have their minds
groueling on the things of this world and profess in respect of wealth, that
they should hold out in faith and in the fear of God, in the time of trial
and temptation, the devil could thus reason, does Job fear God for naught? as
if he had said, Job 1.9.
Jobs fear and service of God is but in respect of his wealth and prosperity,
therefore lay but thine hand upon him, and he will start aside from his fear,
he will then show himself to be but an hypocrite. Though the devil was
deceived in Job, yet he has showed by this manner of reasoning that he knows
well that such as profess in respect of wealth and outward prosperity, they
are soon driven from their profession, by the least trial or temptation.
Therefore this ought to stir us up in our profession, to respect chiefly the
glory of God and our duty, and then labor to fix our eyes on the mark and
price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, that so we may be constant
and persevere in time of trial and temptation, which may come upon us we know
not how soon. It follows (laid up) this phrase as has been showed, is
borrowed from parents to bring within the compass of our understanding the
Lords eternal decree, and his purpose, to bestow life and glory upon his
children, our Such as truly believe in Christ and hold conjunction with the
Saints, may look for life and glory in heaven.
in that life and glory is laid up with the Lord in his eternal council.

We may conclude it shall in time be given to such as truly believe in Christ,
and hold fellowship and communion with the Saints, it is laid up for them, they
shall not miss of it, they may certainly expect it. Our Apostle does thus
build upon it, that he having finished his course and kept the faith, 2. Tim. 4
8.
thenceforth was laid up for him, etc. and that the Lord the righteous judge
would give it unto him, at the day of his departure, out of this life, and not
only to him but to all them also, etc. We may further be resolved of this truth
by considering the end, why natural parents provide and lay up good things for
their children, applying that by way of similitude to the Lord, for what is
their intent and purpose, in their providing laying up and careful keeping of
good things? surely in time to endow and to enrich their children, and it is
either change of affection or want of ability, that makes void their purpose,
either because their love is turned into hatred, or because they are not able
to do that they purposed, now the Lord having purposed and intended from all
eternity in time to endow and enrich his children with treasures of eternal
life and glory. What is it that may frustrate and make void his purpose? is it
change of his love? not possible, his love is essential in him, as
unchangeable as himself, he loves for ever whom he loves once. Is it want of
power? we cannot so imagine, he is omnipotent the God of all power, nothing in
heaven earth, or hell, is able to withstand or hinder him from effecting his
purpose, therefore happiness and eternal glory being intended by him to his
children in his eternal love that never changes laid up for them under his
hands, and keeping who is able to keep and to bestow it at his good pleasure
and that in heaven a place of all safety and security, where it cannot be
corrupted, stained, wax old, or waste and wear away, as the Apostle says, It
must needs in time come to them for whom it is prepared and appointed of the
Lord, 1. Pet. 1.4.
that is to such as believe and hold fellowship and communion with the Saints;
a matter for the use of it of great comfort to all that truly

Comfort to all that truly believe in Christ.
First therefore, let our meditation in this point be to this purpose, is life
and glory laid up for us, in time to be given unto us, then let us not be
dismayed and utterly dejected, though we loose all that ever we enjoy in this
world, far be it from us upon the loss of the transitory and fading things of
this world, to cry out and say we are utterly undone, how shall we do? whether
shall we turn our selves? let these distempered speeches arguing want of hope
be heard out of the mouths of such as want hope, and be far from us, let not
us fear what man or devil can do unto us, it is the encouragement our
Savior gives upon this very ground. Fear not, etc. every word has the weight
of an argument, as if he had said, Luk 12.32.
fear not the loss or want of earthly things (he there handles the argument
of Gods providence) it is your kind and loving father that does tender your
estate and has care of it, it stands with his good will and pleasure freely
to give without any merit of yours the kingdom, that is that heavenly kingdom
prepared for you, why then should you fear, Nay says he verse. 4. I say unto
you be not afraid of them that kill the body, that is, fear not them that are
able to take away your temporal lives, they can go no further, they cannot
strip you of life eternal, that is beyond their reach, they cannot enter upon
your souls to hurt them, they are your freeholds, free from the rage and
violence of satan, and an his instruments. Nay yet more then this, in that life
and glory is laid up in time to be given us if we believe in Christ. we may
hence receive further comfort though it be so that our brains be dashed against
the walls, our bones scattered in the streets, our blood run down the
channel, yet our bodies so mangled and martyred, shall be raised again
restored by the power of God, and be crowned together with our souls with
happiness and glory, and our tongues Expectation of ease, comfort, and
deliverance in time of trouble strengthened.
etc. that is our first use of this, that life and glory is laid up, and in
time shall be given unto us.

Again, secondly the consideration of this may strengthen us in our
expectation, of ease and comfort and deliverance in time of trouble, and
distress, that in the Lords good time we shall not fail of ease, comfort,
and deliverance, for why? has the Lord laid up eternal life and glory in time
to be given us, shall we not miss of it, may we certainly expect it? so
also has the Lord laid up ease, comfort, deliverance etc. for all his
distressed children in his good time to be given unto them, and as we are to
wait with Job all the days of our appointed time, Job 14.14.
till our last changing shall come, our changing from misery and sin to
happiness and glory, so are we in all times of trouble, and distresses to wait
till our changing shall come from the Lord, Isay 63.3.
till it please the Lord to give us beauty for ashes, etc. To change our sorrow
into joy, our sickness into health, and to deliver us out of our distress, it
is a fruit of our corruption to be impatient of delay, to make have to be
delivered and to seek by unlawful means as the fashion of some is in present
trouble, they must have present help, or else they will fetch it from hell it
self, by means of witches, sorcerers, and such like. Let them know, whosoever
they be, that are thus hasty, that this is a manifest demonstration of their
want of faith and trust in God for life eternal, shall we say we trust God
upon his word for happiness in heaven, and yet trust him not upon his promise
for help in time of need? can we persuade our selves that we believe there is
life and glory laid up in store with the Lord in time to be given us, and yet
not believe there is comfort and deliverance with the Lord in time of trouble?
no, no, if we trust not God for the less, we cannot trust him for the greater,
either then trust in the Lord in time of trouble, and with patience expect
comfort from him, or else thou have not yet learned to wait upon his mercy for
salvation, and remember the words of the Prophet. Isay 28.16.
He that believes, makes not have, an infallible character and badge of him
that believes is this, he makes not haste. If thou then make have thou
beleeuest not.

Now here a question must be answered in that the Apostle says, life and
glory is laid up,

For answer, we must learn to distinguish and make a difference between the
essence and substance of glory and the degree and measure of glory. Now the
first of these is meant in this place, that the substance of glory standing in
the fruition of the presence of God, fellowship and society with God the
Father, Son and holy Ghost, and with the Angels and Saints is laid up for true
believers, but the measure of glory may be laid up, and may be increased by
themselves, they by their good works of faith may treasure up a greater measure
and degree of glory, a greater reward in Heaven which shall be given, not for
the merit of their works, but of the mere mercy of God, who in the day of
retribution will crown his own gifts not our merits, and where he finds
greater measure of gifts, greater measure of the works of faith, there he will
in mercy bestow greater measure of glory according to that of the Apostle, 2.
Cor 9.6. 1. Cor. 15.41.
he that sows sparingly etc. he that sows liberally etc. and as he
says, as one differs in brightness from another, so there shall be greater
measure of glory in one Saint then in another, according to the measure of the
works of faith, this I take to be the meaning of our Savior, in saying, lay
up etc. that is treasure for our selves, a measure of glory, and add one
measure to another, True believers have not their happiness in present
possession but in reuersion. 2. Cor. 5.7. 1. Ioh. 3.2.
as men in heaping

Now further, in that the Apostle says, the happiness of true believers, is
laid up for them in Heaven, he would have known that they have it not in
present possession, but in reuersion, in hope and expectation, they live here
by faith etc, and as Saint John says it yet appears not how glorious they
shall be, though the Lord give them a taste of Heaven in this life in the first
fruits of his Spirit, in peace of conscience and joy in the holy Ghost to
comfort and stay their hearts, yet they must expect full fruition of happiness
in Heaven in the life to come.

Our use We must lift up our hearts and affections to the highest heavens.
that seeing our happiness and fullness of joy and comfort is not in any thing
under the Sun, but laid up in the highest Heavens, we therefore should lift
up our hearts thither, and set our affections etc. and to help forward, and
stir up our dullness, in this respect consider we but these two things.
First, to set our affections on earthly things, it is such an high degree of
sin, as our Apostle could not think of it, but with a bleeding heart, nor
speak of it but with tears trickling down his cheeks: and mark the steps
by which he comes unto it, Phil. 3.18.19.
many walk etc. Again, to set our affections on the things of this world,
will not only make us lose the hold that we seem to have of Heaven (for we
cannot compass Heaven and earth together) but the very remembrance of Heaven,
experience shows this. For speak to a worldly minded man, of the joys of the
life to come, of the eternal weight of glory that shall be revealed, and he
is no more moved then a stone in the wall, he has no apprehension of it, if
then we would not aspire to that high degree of sin, that will make an honest
heart bleed to think or speak of it: if we would not lose the hold we seem
to have of Heaven, the very remembrrance of Heaven, let us lift up our hearts
and our affections and not suffer them to settle and rest on earthtly things,
let us use them as travelers to help us forward in our journey toward Heaven,
but let our chief care and affection be on Heaven and heavenly things, and so
much of the first general part of this verse, in these words (for the hopes
sake) Now to the second part of it, in the words following (whereof etc.) the
words need no long expositon, the word (Gospel) is a word well known to
every one in sound, but happily to few in sense and signification. It
signifies in general good tidings, but in special the tidings or the
promulgation of the free grace and mercy of God in Christ, it is an evidence or
declaration of Gods covenant of grace, it signifies that part of the word of
God, that contains the promise of remission of sins and life everlasting,
made to all that truly believe in Christ, and repent of their sins, it is
called the word of truth, or (as the words are) of that truth, in a double
respect. First, because it is of absolute and infallible truth without error,
being published first by God, who is truth it self, after by Prophets and
Apostles, to whom it was revealed by inspiration and instinct of the holy
Ghost, and by them preached and written without error. Secondly, by a kind of
excellency above the law, because it does contain and publish that eternal
and saving truth, whereby we come to the knowledge of righteousness and
salvation by Christ, which we could not have by the law, nor was ever revealed
by the law, here first we are to observe that the Colossians heard of life and
glory laid up in heaven for them, by the Gospel Knowledge of life eternal
comes by hearing.
that the knowledge of life eternal coms by hearing, it is not in us by nature,
but it enters in by the ear, the listening and lending of the ear to the word
preached, is the ordinary outward means, whereby knowledge of salvation is
wroght in the heart; for saving faith which comprehends both knowledge of Gods
mercy, and affiance in his mercy, by which we are saved, comes by hearing, Romans
10.17.
when Adam fell from God, he knew what blessing he had lost, and into what
misery he was fallen, that was the knowledge of good and evil, the devil
promised and he got but he had no sight of rising, no knowledge of restoring
to the state of grace and salvation, till he heard it from the mouth of the
Lord, that the seed of the woman should break the serpents head, and so by
nature there is no knowledge of salvation but a sight of everlasting death and
damnation, indeed the heathen groped after happiness, and dreamed of Elisian
fields, but had no true sight of it, till it was revealed to them by the sound
of the Gospel.

We are to make precious account of hearing the word of God.
Is it so that by hearing of it we come to faith, and knowledge of salvation,
then think that our ears are put to the best use when they are hearing of the
word, for then they are exercised in a business that tends to the saving of
our souls, and let us not with giddy headed Monks and swelling Enthusiasts,
think basely of hearing, and think we shall come to the knowledge of
salvation, by idle visions and fantastical revelations; they brag much of
dreams and private illumination of the spirit, and so join the word and
spirit which the Apostle has coupled together, he calls his preaching the
ministration of the spirit, 2. Cor. 3.8.
to note that the word and spirit are so nearly conjoined, that they must
always go together, the spirit shines in the word, and the word is powerful
by the spirit, and we must be taught of God, but by the word the Lord puts them
together, Isay 59.21.
I will make this my covenant, etc. and by reason of this conjunction of the
word and spirit, the preaching of the word is an instrument of grace and
salvation, therefore we are not to depend upon visions and revelations from
heaven, but to make precious account of hearing the word. And again let us not
with contemners of the word reason thus, if I be appointed unto life and
salvation, I shall come unto it as well as they that hear all the sermons in
the world, that is a dangerous rock on which many souls suffer shipwreck.
Rather reason thus with thy self, am I careless of the means the Lord has
appointed to bring me to the knowledge of salvation, then I may justly fear
that I belong not to Gods election. For whom the Lord has appointed to such an
end, he has appointed to the means, and does sweetly incline and bend the
purpose of the will that way; whom he has predestined them he has called by
the preaching of his word. Romans 8.30.
It is the subtlety and cunning of the devil to work in the heart a
persuasion of indifferency, where the Lord by his ordinance has laid a
necessity, that the hearing of the word which the Lord has appointed a
necessary outward means to bring to the knowledge of salvation, is but a thing
indifferent, and to persuade that a man may be saved, though he be careless of
the means of salvation. Let us learn to take heed of this subtlety, consider
and take we but a short view of the state of such as lightly regard the hearing
of the word, they walk in the darkness and vanity of their minds, they rush
into errors, break out into blasphemies, run into all sorts of sin, they
degenerate into the nature of bruit beasts, and grow worse then they. For why
they have no strength against the corruption of their own hearts; nor any
power of grace to withstand the temptation of satan, but with full swing run
after the vanities of the world, and the pleasures of sin, and so lie open to
Gods wrath, which hangs over the heads of all unbelievers, being destitute of
Christ the robe of righteousness, wanting faith, mortification,
sanctification, and the whole armor of God, a state wretched and damnable; let
the consideration of it move us to make a special account of hearing the word,
whereby our judgments may be informed, our wills reformed, our affections
ordered, and every thought brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.
In the second place we are to mark that the Colossians came to the knowledge
of life and glory, laid up for them in heaven, by hearing the Gospel, whence
we learn that the doctrine of the Gospel, the doctrine The doctrine of the
Gospel is that which brings men to the knowledge of their salvation.
and life everlasting by Christ exhibited in the flesh, is that in particular
which brings men to the knowledge of their salvation. For why the Gospel of
Christ is the only charter and evidence of that heavenly inheritance, that is
prepared for them that shall be saved. It is not the book of the creatures,
the visible frame of the world, that can reveal or make it known, that serves
only to leave men without excuse, Romans 1.20.
it is not any extraordinary work of Gods justice, any of his judgments which
are real and visible sermons, they bring not to the knowledge of mercy,
neither is it the hearing of the law, because there is no seed of faith, either
in the law of nature, nor any revelation of it by the moral law of God, the
law is no isntrumental cause of faith, repentance or any other saving grace;
the moral law is called by the Apostle a killing letter, 2. Cor. 3.7.
the Minister of death and condemnation. And the Gospel is there said to give
life, and is called the ministration of righteousness and of the Spirit. Gal.
3.2.
And indeed it is the hearing of the Gospel that does confer the Spirit of
adoption, Act. 5.20.
as the Apostle says. Hence is the Gospel called the word of life, the word
of salvation, and therefore the hearing of the Gospel only brings the
knowledge of life and salvation. Act. 13.26.




Gal. 3.24.
and punishment due to the same without remedy, and so to compel them to go
to Christ set forth unto them in the Gospel. The point then being clear the
use of it is this.

Who they be that do truly and rightly preach the Gospel.
namely, they who do aim and drive at that, and in some measure effect that
which is the proper work of the Gospel, that is, bring men to faith in
Christ, and certain knowledge of their own salvation, The Papists teaching that
holds men in suspense and makes men doubt of their own salvation, and gives
them no certain light, nor knowledge of life and glory laid up for them in
heaven, is not the true teaching: The Gospel is then truly preached when the
preaching thereof is powerful by the work of the spirit, to confer the
Spirit of adoption, whereby believers know that there is life and salvation
laid up for them in Heaven.

Again, hence learn we who they be that rightly Who they be that rightly
hear the preaching of the Gospel.
they who are brought by hearing of it, to a true sight of their own
salvation, that life and glory is laid up for them in Heaven, the Gospel is
powerful in it self to bring men to the knowledge of salvation, it is the
arm of the Lord to that purpose, and if it be not thus powerful in thee, to
work in thee upon good ground, faith and repentance, and a measure of true
knowledge and assurance of thine own salvation, 2. Cor. 4.3.
thou have not profited by hearing of it as thou ought, and then mark what
the Apostle says, if the Gospel be hid etc. If thou be not able to see that
light that shines in the Gospel, touching remission of sins and salvation,
it is a sign of perdition. Again, consider that the devils understand both
the law and the Gospel, and give assent to the Gospel to be true, they go so
far, if thou then be not brought to some measure of assurance of salvation thou
have not yet gone beyond the devils, who are already in hell. Let then these
things work upon thee thus far, to draw thee to examine how thou have
profited by the preaching of the Gospel.

The Apostle here calls the gospel the (word of truth) Their opinion is
false, who hold; every man living an outward civil life may be saved in any
religion.
hence it follows that the opinion of such is false, who hold that every man
living an outward civil life may be saved in any religion, the Jew in his
Iudaisme, the Turk in his Turcisme, and the Heathen in his Paganism. For
reason teaches that truth is simple, and one error is manifold, and there is
one way to do well, and many ways to do evil. Now every Art and Science has
his truth, but saving truth, is the truth of the gospel, and there is but one
gospel, one in number, no more, and therefore but one way of salvation that is
by true faith in Christ.

VER. 6. Which is come unto you, etc.
In this verse, the Apostle proceeds in commendation of the gospel, and not
contenting himself to call it the word of truth, he goes on further to commend
it, and that by two arguments. The f^rst is taken from the wonderful diffusion
and spreading of it, that it was diffused and spread one all the world, that
the sound and preaching of it was come to all the parts of the world, in
particular to the Colossians, (which is come unto you etc.) Secondly, he
commends it from the effectual working and fruitefulnes of it, and that both
in general in all the world and in special among the Colossians, (for so the
sentence must be supplied and made up in the words following, as if the
Apostle had said is fruitful in all the world, as it is also among you etc.
and this argument of the fruitful working of the Gospel in special among the
Colossians is further amplified by the circumstance of time, that it was
fruitful among them, from the very day they heard and knew the Gospel whis
is delivered under the name of the grace of God, the matter of it, and by their
manner of hearing and embracing of it, expressed in the word (truly, or in
truth) from the day that ye heard etc. these are the general things contained
in this verse, come we to the first argument of commendation (come unto you)
that is published and preached among you as the Apostle, Romans 10.15.
citing the words of the Prophet says, how beautiful are the feet or coming
of them, and his meaning is how excellent and pleasant is the preaching of the
Gospel as appears in the next verse, but they have not all obeyed (unto all
the world) that is to all the parts of the world, Asia, Africa, Europe and
America, and to the chief nations and kingdoms of those parts, and from them,
if not the preaching yet the fame and sound of the Gospel came to bordering
nations: so that in the time of the Apostle there were very few or almost none,
unto whom either the preaching of the Gospel or the fame of Christ had not
come Hence is the preaching of the Gospel compared by the Apostle to the sound
or voice of the heavens, that as the heavens that beauty, motion influence show
and as it were speak and sound forth the glory of God to all nations, so
(says the Apostle) applying that of the Psalmist by the way of similitude to
the preaching of the Gospel no doubt their sound etc. Romans 19.18.


Some may say we read of certain nations newly converted to the faith, as this
land of ours, Ob.
long after the time of the Apostles? It is true, Constantine and Theodosius.

Now to the doctrine.

First we are to mark the phrase used by the Apostle, he The Lord in mercy
offers his Gospel unto men and brings it home unto them.
but come unto you, whence we may take up this conclusion, that the Lord in
mercy sends unto us his word of grace, the promise of remission of sins and
life by Christ, he does of his own good pleasure send and offer unto us his
Gospel, the means of grace and salvation, by which men are brought to the
knowledge of salvation, it is brought home unto us, we send not for it, no
surely, if it were not brought we should never seek for it, and the reason is
plain we have no understanding of the excellent comfort of it, much less any
desire after it in nature, it is above the reach of nature created even of
nature pure in the state of the first creation, much more is it above the reach
of nature, in the state of sin and corruption, it pleases the Lord therefore
in mercy to send unto us his Gospel, to offer the means of grace and
salvation. We read, Pro. 9.3.
W^sdome sends forth her maids freely to inuit the simple etc. to eat of her
meat and drink of her wine, and the Lord says, Ier. 7.25.
he sent all his servants the Prophets rising up early etc. and the Son of
God himself Christ Jesus says, Reu 3.20.
he does stand at our door and knock, behold etc. if any man hear etc.

Now the use The Lord requires that we receive the Gospel offered unto us.
the means of grace and salvation, what then does the Lord require of us?
surely that we receive his Gospel, for to that end is it offered, that we
should believe and embrace it, and submit our selves to the power of it: which
in the right use is powerful to work in us true faith and true repentance.
Now then consider this point, it has pleased the Lord in mercy to vouchsafe
unto us, the Gospel of salvation cou^tenanced by public authority, for the
space of fifty years together, his name be blessed for it, at the first
entrance and preaching of the Gospel when the preaching of it was rare and
scarce, then it was most welcome to many, they greatly rejoiced in it, and
took great delight in the sweet comfort of it, but afterward when the
preaching of it was more plentiful, and it was brought home unto us, then men
began to wax weary of it, as the Israelites did of Manna, and wish that they
had never been troubled with so much preaching, a marvelous thing that we
should grow weary of the goodness of God, offering mercy unto us, yet so it is
the speech is general in every man's mouth, that has any feeling of grace,
that our wonted love and zeal to the Gospel, is almost utterly extinct and
clean gone, the three capital and maine sins of the world, Saint John
speaks of, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, 1. Ioh. 2.16.
and the pride of life, sensuality and wanton pleasures, covetousness and
ambition have so taken up the hearts and lives of most men, that there is
nothing to be found in many of us but a mere neglect or contempt of the
Gospel. But let us take heed, if the Gospel the means of grace, coming and
being offered unto us, serve only for conviction, and not for conversion, to
convince and not convert us, it will convince us of such a sin as stands in
the sight of God naked, Ioh. 15.22.
and void of all excuse. If I had not come and spoken, etc. And consider
further these two things. First, the stabilitie of our estate stands in our
obedience to the Gospel: for when we entertain and obey the Gospel, our
state is founded in the Kingdom of God: where the Gospel is embraced, there
is Gods Kingdom, as the Prophet says; Thy God reigns, Isay 52.7.
and his Kingdom is most stable and firm, nothing is able to ouerturne it. If
then our estate be founded in Gods Kingdom, we may be assured of the
continuance of it, and of whatsoever may serve for our good. Would we then
have our estate never to change, but to the better? no doubt every man desires
it: then learn we to submit our selves to the Gospel of the Kingdom of God.
Again, consider we, though the Lord still continue his coming unto us by his
Gospel, and still offer and reach out unto us the means of grace and
salvation, yet we know not how long he will so do; he may we know not how
soon, either take the Gospel from us, or us from the Gospel: and if we
refuse to receive his grace offered by the coming of his Gospel, he will
force his judgments upon us by the coming of himself, by his own immediate
hand, as he has already begun. As he is kind to offer grace, so he is just to
revenge the wilful contempt of his offer, and he will proportion out the
punishment due to the refusal of his mercy, he will make it suitable and
agreeable to the sin, that as we reject and lightly regard his mercy
offered, so in time of trouble he will not regard our misery, but he will
laugh, Pro. 1.26.
etc. a sentence full of terror. If the Lord, who in trouble should comfort
us, when all other comforts fail and forsake us, if he will then deride and
mock us, that is, by the course of his providence, leave us in misery, and
make us a mocking stock to the world, it must needs be a state almost as hard
to be borne as hell it self. Let this be thought upon, and let it stir us up
in this our time and day of salvation, to accept the means of grace and
salvation, and to submit our selves in faith and obedience to the word of the
Gospel. It follows, (even as it is, etc.) hence we may conclude, that the
Gospel The Gospel and means of salvation is indifferently offered to all
sorts of men. Romans 1.16. Romans 15.8.
without respect or distinction of persons or difference of people, to Jews
and Gentiles, as the Apostle says. It is the power of God, etc. To the Jew
first, and also to, etc. First to the Jews, in respect of order, because
Christ was the minister of circumcision: and when he first sent forth his
Apostles, he forbade them to go into the way of the Gentiles, etc. but in his
last commission given at his ascension, Mark. 16.15.
he bid them go into all the world, etc. Now the preaching of the Gospel and
means of salvation being thus universal, Ioh. 6.44.
except the Father which has sent me, draw him. Draw him, says Augustine, not
lead him, that we might think his will does go before: for who is drawn if he
were willing before? So then the true answer to the question is, Ioh. 6.45.
Every man that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me.
They that are not inwardly taught of the father, They have great cause to
bless the Lord, who are inwardly taught of him
are left without excuse. And this (see the use of it) may minister great cause
of thanksgiving to God, to as many of us as the Lord has vouchsafed inwardly
to teach, and to open our hearts as he did the heart of Lidia, to believe and
obey the Gospel. For why? have not we great cause to magnify the name of the
Lord, Act. 16.14.
who in mercy has brought us to the obedience of faith, and in his secret yet
just judgment, has left others as good as we by nature, in hardness and sin?
When we see others left in their natural state and corruption, we may behold
in them what we had deserved, and how much we are bound to the Lord, who in his
just judgment has passed over others, and in his mercy has delivered us out
of our natural bondage, and so be moved to acknowledge his mercy with
thankfulness: and if any will stand to reason the case why the Lord does not
with the outward means give inward grace to al, the Apostle has given the
answer: O man, Romans 9 20.
who art thou that stand to dispute against God? he will have mercy on whom
he will: it is his mere mercy, that any man is brought to believe; and let
that suffice thee. So much of the first argument of commendation of the
Gospel, in these words, (which is come, etc.) Now to the second argument (is
fruitful in all the world) for these words must be resumed and repeated, to
make a perfect sentence: the Gospel is here said to be fruitful both generally
in all the world, and in special among the Colossians in two respects. 1. in
respect of the number of such as were converted daily etc. in respect of the
believers, who by the preaching of it were daily increased, as we read there
were added to the Church by the sermon of Peter about three thousand souls,
and verse 47. Act. 2.41.
it is said the Lord added to the Church from day to day such as should be
saved. Secondly, in respect of the proceeding of those believers, and of them
that were converted in faith, sanctify, and other graces. The original text in
some examples has two words, (...), which plainly show that this word
(fruitful) serving to express them both, has this extension, to signify
both increase in number, and increase of faith and holy fruits, that the
Gospel was fruitful in converting many, and powerful in them that were
converted, both generally in all parts of the world, and in special among the
Colossians. That is the meaning of the words. Come we to such things as may be
hence observed. First, from the fruitfulnes of the Gospel, the powerful
working of it generally in all the world, that the preaching of it in the days
of the Apostles was universally fruitful in all places of the world, in all
sorts of men, in their conversion, and other fruits, we are taught, that where
it pleases the Lord to work by the Gospel, nothing is able to withstand the
power and force of it. The Nothing is able to withstand the power and force of
the Gospel, where the Lord is pleased to work by it.
if not contrariety of states, both of government and religion, such
diversity of natures, wits, and dispositions, some being like wolves, some
leopards, some lions, especially in the Empire of Rome, which then flourished,
and in other mighty principalities, does plainly prove that it is able to bear
down before it the wisdom, learning, policy, power, and strength of the
world, and to cast down whatsoever stands up in opposition against it: for
indeed it was withstood and resisted by all these things and many more in the
days of the Apostles in the primitive times, Isay 11.
as might be proved, yet had it marvelous success, and did wonderfully
increase, and for the state of religion it changed the face of the whole world.
Isay 53.1. 1. Cor. 1.18.
The reason is given by the Prophet; It is the arm of the Lord: and by the
Apostle; It is the power of God: the arm of the Lord has ever preeminence,
ever prevails, and nothing is able to withstand the power of it. Hence the
Gospel has been and is so powerful, it having in it a power passing the
power of man, yea passing the power and strength of hell, it must needs be
effectual, and nothing able to withstand it. And is this true in the general
working of the Gospel? We are to examine the particular working of the Gospel
in our selves.
and know that then thou do indeed embrace the Gospel, and then is it
powerful in thee, when nothing in thee by nature is able to withstand the
power of it. When thou do feel it ouer-ruling thine own reason, and bearing
down the rebellion of thy will and affections, and what sin soever is most
pleasing unto thee Such persons deceive themselves, who think they embrace the
Gospel, and yet feel it not powerful to bear down (I will not say) their
secret corruptions, for those may lurk in their hearts and be unknown, but
their known sins, such as in their own sight stand up in opposition against
the Gospel: for let this be thought upon but in reason, can we think that
the Lords arm is powerful where the devils arm armed holds possession? Can
we imagine that the Lord has wrought by his Gospel, where pride,
covetousness, drunkenness, malice, or any other shameless sin does stand
up and outface it, and is seen above any power of it? has the Gospel in the
primitive times of the Church, nay in the memory of many amongst us, has it
been powerful to make men to forsake house, land, wife and children, yea to
lose, forgo their lives, by fire and faggot, and most exquisite torments; and
is it not now able to make thee to deny the lusts of thine own wicked heart?
can it not make thee forsake so much as a cup of beer or wine, not needful?
is it not able to make thee leave thy vain and carnal pleasure? is the Lords
arm weakened? is the power of the Gospel abated? no, no; deceive not thy
self, the Gospel is as mighty as ever it was through God to cast down the
strongest holds of sin and Satan, as the Apostle says. 2. Cor. 10.4.
Certainly, if the Lord have wrought upon thee by the Gospel, for thy
conversion and salvation, and not for thy hardening and deeper condemnation, by
thy abusing of it, he has thereby quelled and ouermastered the corruption of
thy heart, thrown down thy strongest and most rebelling sin, even that sin
that was most powerful and pleasing unto thee. Let this be thought on and
remembered. (as it is also.) We are here to mark that the Apostle descends
from the general working of the Gospel, to the particular: he says it was
fruitful in all the world, and there stays not, but adds further (as it is
also among you) no doubt both to commend and comfort the Colossians for their
embracing of the Gospel: whence we may note how How we may with profit and
comfort think and speak of the fruitful working of the Gospel.
namely, when we know and can truly say, it is powerful not only in general
in the Church and land wherein we live, but among us, then may any man speak
of the working of the Gospel, with comfort, when he can with the Apostle go
from the general to the particular, and can truly say it is fruitful in
himself, many men are able to make long discourses in commendation of the
power of the gospel, and by unanswerable arguments to prove the Apostles
words true in general terms, nay with instance and example of others
sanctified by it, but can say little or nothing of the power of it, in their
own persons. Now what profit comes by it to know that the gospel is the power
of God to the salvation of many others, if it were of the whole world, and not
of thy self? What comfort is it to know that many are brought by the gospel
to the way of life, and thy self left in the way that leads down to hell?
nay rather what discomfort comes by such knowledge? To have the eye of the mind
blinded, and not be able to see and conceive in the understanding the power of
the gospel, is an heavy judgment; but to see the power of it in the abstract
in it self in general, and not in our selves, that is the very devils case,
and it ought to be considered and thought upon. Come we to the words following,
wherein the special working of the Gospel among the Colossians is amplified,
that it was fruitful from the day that they heard, and truly or in truth knew
the grace of God: the Gospel is here called the grace of God, because it
teaches that remission of sins and life everlasting are obtained only by the
mere grace and mercy of God in Christ. The point of instruction hence offered
is this: In that it is said that the Gospel was fruitful among the
Colossians, upon their hearing and true knowledge, not of the Gospel, but of
the grace of God propounded unto them in the Gospel; we are taught that then
only is the Gospel powerful to work upon us, The Gospel is powerful to
make us bring forth good fruit, when we have a feeling knowledge of the
comfort of it. Ps. 19.10.11.
David: he there says that the judgments of the Lord were sweeter than the
honey and the honey comb; and then he adds, that by them he was made
circumspect. We read of the woman in the Gospel, that she loved much: why?
Luke 7 47.
many sins were forgiven her. When she felt much comfort in Gods grace for
the pardon of many sins, then she brought forth many good fruits. And there
is great reason for this, that the true knowledge of the grace of God in the
gospel, should make us fruitful in every good word and work. For when we
feelingly know the grace of God revealed in the gospel, then we know we are
within the compass of Gods special love, we are assured of his comfortable
presence and protection, of our portion in his promise of life and salvation,
of right and title to all the comforts and blessings belonging to the saints of
God. How then can it be, but that the feeling knowledge of grace, the ground of
such excellent comfort, should make us fruitful in all good things? license to
heap sin upon sin, We must labor to have a feeling knowledge of the grace
of God propounded in the Gospel. Heb. 4.2. Ezekiel 33.32 Ioh. 4.
as we hear it, so to have a feeling knowledge of the grace of God propounded
in the Gospel, and to have our hearing mixed with faith, as the holy Ghost
speaks. For surely we shall but hear as a pleasant song, as the Lord says,
nay we shall but cavil at it, till we have a feeling knowledge of the comfort
of it. The woman of Samaria did but prattle with Christ, till he told her of
her sin, and brought her to a true sight of her sin, then she humbled her
self, and confessed her sin. And after that, when she knew him to be a
Prophet, and did acknowledge him to be the Messiah, then she ran to fetch
others unto him, and said, verse. 29. Come and see a man which has told me all
things that ever I did: is not he that Christ? So we shall but prattle of the
Gospel, and make it but table talk, till we be humbled in our selves, and
have a true knowledge and an inward feeling of the comfort of it. Let us then
labor to have our hearts possessed with a feeling apprehension of the grace
revealed in the Gospel, and that will set our heads a work as it did David's,
to devise if it be possible some retribution: and we shall find, that as many
of us as have a peculiar right and title to Gods grace, sealed up in our heart
by the spirit of Christ, it will make us endeavor to be answerable to so strict
a bond, in all cheerful obedience and love both to God and men.

VER. 7. As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, which is for
you a faithful minister of Christ.
The Apostle having set down the means how the Colossians came to know that
life and glory was laid up for them in heaven (namely) by bearing of the
Gospel. In this seventh verse he comes to the person by whom the Gospel was
preached, and they brought to that knowledge (namely) by Epaphras (As ye also
learned of Epaphras) the Apostle further describes him what he was. First in
respect of himself and Timothy that in preaching of the Gospel he was their
fellow laborer, and adds, what affection they had toward him, that he was
dear unto them, or that they loved him dearly, then by his office and calling
that he was a minister of Christ, and he sets down how he demeaned himself in
his calling, that he was faithful, and that for the good of the Colossians
(which is for you a faithful minister of Christ) and further proves it verse
the eight, that he was faithful for their good in that he gave testimony of
their love (who has also declared unto us your love) which is amplified by the
quality of it in the last words (which ye have by the spirit) these be the
general things contained in these two verses. Come we to the words as they are
laid down by the Apostle (as ye also learned, etc.) we are hereto mark that
the Apostle is not content to say, that the Colossians came to the knowledge of
salvation by the Gospel, but that they also learned it of Epaphras, not that
Epaphras was a means of himself or by any other doctrine, but that he was the
preacher and dispenser of the Gospel, and by his preaching of the gospel The
knowledge of salvation, is ordinarily wrought in men by the Gospel preached by
men called to that office.
whence arises this instruction that the knowledge of salvation is ordinarily
wrought in men, by the Gospel not by the letters, and sillables or bare
sentences written in the books of the old or new testament, but by the gospel
taught and applied unto them by the ministry of man called to teach, for the
gospel is indeed the power of god to salvation, yet not to every one
generally, but to every one that believes that is the limitation, and how, is
faith wrought by the bare letter or sentence of the gospel? no, but by the
gospel unfolded and applied mark the gradation, how shall they believe in
him, Romans 10.14.
of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher, for
the working of faith, the Gospel must be heard and not only heard by a bare
repetition of the sentence but heard preached, that is to say, 2. Tim. 3.16.
unfolded and applied, the Scripture says the Apostle is profitable to teach,
to improve, to correct, and to instruct in righteousness, and mark what
follows upon this in the next chapter 1. 2. verses, I charge thee therefore
before God, and before the Lord Jesus Christ, which shall judge the quick and
the dead at his appearing, and in his Kingdom. 2. Preach the word; be instant
in season and out of season: improoue, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering
and doctrine. The Scripture being profitable in it self, it must be preached
and applied by men called to the several uses of it, the sentence of the
Gospel is general and the promises of salvation are indefinitely propounded
whosoever believes he shall be saved, they are above the reach of natural
understanding, such as reason cannot comprehend, and generals of that nature
must needs be unprofitable without explication and application of them, the
Lord therefore has ordained that men called to teach the gospel, should in his
name expound and apply the same to the persons of their hearers particularly,
that so they might be brought to the knowledge of Salvation.

Ob.
It will be said, the Prophet says, in the time of the Gospel, men should
teach no more, every man his neighbor, Ier. 31.34.
and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for they shall all know me
from the least of them, unto the greatest of them, says the Lord: How then is
it that the Gospel must be taught by the ministry of man, how is that a true
prophecy?

speaks in regard of the plentiful measure of knowledge under the Gospel
according to that, Isay. 11.9.
that the earth should be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters that
cover the sea. Some may reply and say, Reply.
this answer is not sufficient, is the Prophet so to be understood, that the
Elect of God should be taught inwardly by his spirit, then Saint John has
showed it needless to be taught by man, 1. Ioh. 2.27.
the annoynting (that is to say) the spirit of Christ, which ye have received
of him, dwells in you: and ye need not that any man teach you: but the same
annoynting teaches you of all things, and it is true, and is not lying, and as
it taught you, ye shall abide in him.

Again, the meaning of Saint John is, these things have I written unto you,
concerning them that deceive you. And then he subioynes in the seventeenth
ver. but the annoynting etc. So then notwithstanding these exceptions this
remains a truth, that men are brought to the knowledge of salvation not by the
bare sentence of the Gospel delivered in the writings of the Apostles, but by
it explained and applied by men called to that office.

Has the Lord sanctified the ministry of man called to teach and apply the
Gospel to such an excellency, We are not to think base of the ministry and
teaching of the Gospel, by men called to that function.
then let this serve to rule and order our conceit and and estimation of the
ministry and teaching of the Gospel by men called to that duty and function,
let us not think it either needless or base. Who well in his wits and lead by
the divine light of reason will lightly regard, that which being rightly used
will bring him to the knowledge of his own everlasting good. Such is the
ministry and teaching of the Gospel, by men called to that function, yea the
teaching of the word by men called to that office is ordaind of the Lord to make
it profitable, what part of the word soever it be, whether the Law or the
Gospel, let us then take heed we contemn not the teaching of the word by men
in any part of it, whether showing sin by the law and denouncing judgments,
or preaching mercy, and applying the promises of the Gospel; let us not
lightly esteem it, because it is brought by a weak and mortal man, the Lords
ordinance is powerful in weakness as in the creation, he brought light out
of darkness and reredemption and life out of death, so in our conversion he
works upon us by the ministry of weak men, and heerin he does not only
provide for our weakness, who are not able to endure the Majesty of his own
immediate voice, or the voice of an Angel, but to try our obedience whether
we will look only at his instrument or at his ordinance, whether we will
have our eye on the earthen vessel, or on the excellent treasure brought in
that vessel, and therefore to lay this a little nearer unto our hearts many
there be that will be content to look at the Lords ordinance of the word
brought by the ministry of men, when the word of grace and mercy is preached,
they will then look on that, as the word of God, and confess, and acknowledge
it so to be, and upon a false ground hale it to themselves, but when the law is
laid open, and the judgments of God denounced, then they hear and regard that
but as the word of man and not of God, then they bless themselves, and promise
peace to themselves, and say in their hearts, no such things shall happen unto
them, it is but the word of their preacher. I appeal to men's own hearts,
whether these thoughts do not many times rise in them or no, and if we find
they do, then mark what will follow, the Lord will punish us, even by our
own thoughts, that as we think his judgments denounced by the ministry of
man, to be but the words of men, and of our preachers, so he will make his
word of grace offered by the ministry of man to be unto us but as the word of
man, we shall ^ot in our sins, and lie still unconverted, it shall be
unprofitable unto us, for the Lord is just, and he will punish sin in the
same kind, and as we think of his word of threatening, so shall his word of
mercy be unto us. Consider the example of Herod: Mark. 6.20.
he heard many things John taught him gladly, he heard them (no doubt) as the
word of God by the ministry of John, but when John came to touch his sin,
and to tell him the danger of living in that sin, he would none of that, he
then thought it was but John's word, and so would be avenged of him, and so
indeed all that he heard of John was by the just judgment of God, but as man's
word unto him, he lived and died in his sins, so will it come to pass with
us, if so be we think the judgments of God denounced against us for our
sins in the ministry of the word, are but the words of men. Learn we
therefore in the ministry of the word by man called to that office, to look not
at the instrument, but at the ordinance of God, and let us receive the word, as
the word of God, whether threatening judgments, or promising mercy. Now to the
description of Epaphras. First, the Apostle says he was in respect of him and
Timothy their dear fellow servant; which words are thus to be conceived,
that they did acknowledge him a fellow labourer with them in the preaching of
the Gospel, and consequently one dearly beloved of them.

Now in that the Apostle says Epaphras was his fellow Timothy, Such as are
lawfully knit together in any common bond, they are to be tenderly affected one
to another.
hence we may conclude that such as are lawfully knit together in any common
bond, they are by the example of the Apostle tenderly to be affected one
toward another: children of the same parents, servants of one master, men of
one society, neighbors one to another, it is usual in the Scriptures to urge
and press love by this kind of reasoning, that men that are conioined by some
common bond, they ought to love one another. Abraham used this argument. Moses
used no other to accord the two Hebrews. Act. 7.26.
Sirs ye are brethren, why do ye wrong one to another? We may observe that
when Joseph's brethren forgot him to be their brother, Genesis 37 20.
or at least did not so consider him, they said, come let us kill him. But after
when they considered him as their brother, then they think of a more mild and
gentle course, verse 27. Come and let us fell him to the Ismaelites, and let
not our hands be upon him; for he is our brother, and our flesh: and his
brethren obeyed. As the scripture thus urges love, so nature it self teaches
it, having imprinted in such as she has conioined, a bending and an
inclination one toward another. And it was ever held odious among the heathen,
and a growing out of kind, for men in nature nearly conioined, to be far
disioined in affection. And is the bond of outward brotherhood, service,
society and neighborhood, and such like, a persuasion and a powerful
argument urging love? then doubtless much more is the inward bond of the
spirit, because by the spirit men are more nearly conioined, then they are or
can be by nature. By the spirit they are made members of one mystical body,
Therefore such as profess fellowship and communion of the Spirit, are tenderly
to love one another. Romans 12.5.
Let this then be thought on by all that profess the fellowship and communion
of the spirit. Let us think upon it, that we have one God to our father, one
Church to our mother, Christ our elder brother, and that we are borne of one
immortal seed, that we are knit together in one faith, one religion, one hope
of salvation, and therefore ought to love one another. Come we to the other
part of the description of Epaphras, that he was for the Colossians a faithful
minister of Christ.

A minister being faithful in discharging of his duty, it is for the good of
the people.
Whence note we first, that where a minister is faithful in the discharge of
his duty, it is for the good of the people, so says the Apostle, (for you)
that is, for your good: and this might be proved by all the titles that are
given to ministers in the Scripture. They are called light, which is
comfortable to the beholders, salt, for seasoning, laborers in the Lords
husbandry, builders of his Temple, leaders, guides, etc. all which show their
labor and pains in the ministry, tend to the good of Gods people. But the
experience of such as have profited, by the pains of faithful ministers may
sufficiently confirm the truth of this point.

Now then is it so, The people must answer the pains of the minister in
profiting themselves. Heb. 6.8.
then let us look where the minister is in any measure faithful, that we be
answerable in profiting our selves and receiving good, for as the holy ghost
says, that earth which drinks in the rain, and bears thorns and briers is
reproved, and is near unto cursing, whose end is to be burned. Consider yet
further these two things. First, hardness and want of profiting in the people,
is a great grief and discouragement, and even a pull-backe to a faithful
minister. Ier. 20 9.
Witness Jeremy who resolved upon this not to speak any more in the name of
the Lord. Again, if a minister be faithful, and we profit not, it argues, we
are sunk deep in rebellion, even drunken in sin, yea sunk deep into the
sin of drunkenness; for of all others, drunkards are the hardest to be
drawn to repentance: for as drunkenness for the time of it makes a man like a
bruit beast, unfit for any common and natural duty, so it is the natural
effect of that sin, to deprive a man (when he is sober) of all understanding
and capacity of instruction. Therefore the Lord when he was to call by his
Prophet for a general reformation, he spoke in particular to drunkards, Awake
ye drunkards, Joel. 1.5.
and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine. If then we would not hinder the
pains of such as labor in the ministry amongst us, and show our selves sunk
deep in rebellion, let us labor to profit and to receive good by them that
labor for our good, and endeavor to profit us. And remember the words of the
holy Ghost; Obey them that have the oversight of you, Heb. 13.17.
and submit your selves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
accounts, that they may give it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
unprofitable for you. Now in the next place we are to mark, that the Apostle
in commending Epaphras a minister of Christ, does not magnifi^ and extol him
for his wit, his learning, his eloquence, h^^ gravity, but he commends him for
his faithfulness, that he was faithful, that is to say, he did use his
talent and gif^ bestowed upon him for the best advantage, both of gaining glory
to Christ his Lord, and good to his people: for that is to be faithful, Mat.
25.
as appears in the parable of the talents. The chief ornament of a minister
is to be faithful in the execution of his office, and the like is ^^ue of
other callings 1. Cor. 4.2.
in respect of the execution of his office, is to be faithful, and to answer
that trust that is reposed in him. As for the rest (that is to say) as for
other things, or howsoever he be careful for other things, it is not so much
material, but it is especially required of him that he be found faithful.
And indeed it is required in every duty, that he be faithful in teaching, in
exhorting, in comforting, in reprehending, it must be found in every
ministerial action, without it nothing is pleasing to God profitable to men.
And this not only concerns the minister of the word, and is required of him,
and to be urged upon him, but it may be reached out further, and that by just
warrant of the word. The Apostle says, Romans 13.4.
such as are ordained to rule and govern others, they are Gods ministers, they
are appointed of the Lord, for the good of those that be under them, they have
a talent in trust given unto them. Now then that which most commends the
minister of the word, is it not also praise worthy, and most commendable in
others, Gods ministers, such as are deputed of the Lord to have the rule and
government of others? Yes doubtless, diligence and faithfulness in the charge
committed, either in Church or common wealth, as it is most requisite and
necessary, so it is most excellent and commendable, it is as a crown that
must be set on the head of all good duties. We read in many places, of the
vigilancie, care and diligence of Moses, that neither the difficulty and
infinite labors of his calling, the contumacy, untowardness, and ingratitude
of the people, the emulation and grudging of equals, did any whit hinder him
from going on with courage and constancy in his duty: the Lord therefore
himself with his own mouth, gives him this commendarion. Numb. 12.7.
That he was faithful in all his house, and that must needs be most
commendable which the Lord commends in any man. We find this commendation given
to Christ himself, and that with greater glory unto him then unto Moses, Heb.
3.2.
because he was a more excellent person. If we do but consider, how the devil
labors, to make men put in trust by the Lord with gifts and places of rule and
government, unfaithful, and not to answer the trust reposed in them, that so
their condemnation may be the deeper, and that he may hinder the profit of
others, who might be bettered by them: the truth of this will easily appear
that in any place of rule, it is most commendable to be faithful, he by
suggestion teaches men, as we see by experience to say (when they are urged to
do their duty) what can I do? I will not trouble my self? or make my self
busy, it belongs not to my office it is good sleeping in a whole skin, I
shall be blamed, I shall be reproched, I shall labor in vain, and
peradventure make the matter worse, another may do it better then I, with a
thousand such like suggestions, does the devil furnish men to make them
sluggish and unfaithful, all which plainly euince, that faithfulness in any
place of trust is an excellent thing. And let this be thought on by all that
are called to any rule or government of others either publicly or in the
private family, parents, masters, household governors, etc. seeing it is so
excellent a thing to be faithful, Men are to answer that trust the Lord has
reposed in them in any place and calling.
to use the place given them to bring such as are under them to fear the Lord,
for that is in general the charge that lies on governors and laid upon them by
the Lord in the fourth commandment, that they in their own persons sanctify
the sabbath, and learn to fear the Lord, and cause others under them to do
likewise. For want of faithful discharge of duty in such as have the
government of others, it comes to pass that many foul disorders spoken
against are still unreformed, to insist in one particular. Though the minister
cry out against drunkenness, and spend himself in dissuading from it, and
good laws be made for the reformation of it, yet still that sin is as rife
and common, nay more common then ever it was, where is the fault? is it not in
such as bear office and should faithfully execute their office, according to
law in that case provided. Yes without question, Psalm. 77.20.
Moses and Aaron must join hands together, the minister must be seconded and
assisted by the public officer, or else many there be that will not be
reformed. To persuade such as are in any public office, or have the government
of private families to become faithful in laboring, to bring those that are
committed to their charge, to fear the Lord, consider first that diligent
faithfulness in the charge committed, is both sweet and pleasing to God, Pro.
22.29.
and good for our selves. He that is diligent stands before Kings; but he
that is diligent in the work of the Lord, (such is every public charge) shall
stand with joy before the Lord, Mat. 25.21.
the King of Kings. Come good and faithful servant, thou have been faithful
in little; I will make thee ruler over much; enter into thy masters joy. To him
that is slothful the contrary shall be said. Again, let us but think with
our selves, how diligent the wicked are to do evil. Judas will watch when
others are asleep, and that for a mischief. The high priests and all that
rout assemble together betimes in the dawning against Christ, Matk. 15.1.
even before day will the wicked be working ill. They muse on mischief on
their beds. Pro 4.16.
And fear not to pull upon themselves that woe denounced by the Prophet* They
will rise early to call companions to follow after drunkenness, Isay 5.11.
and shall the wicked be thus diligent (if I may so call it) to do ill, and
shall it not move such as the Lord has put in trust, to be vigilant and
faithful in well doing. Surely then their vigilance and pains shall stand up
in judgment against them, and shall condemn them. Add to this as a third
motive, that which we find. Where the Lord says he will not hide from Abraham
that which he was about to do, and why? Genesis 18.19.
for I know him that he will command his sons, and his household after him, that
they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and judgment. See how the
Lord likes carfulness of parents, to instruct their children, it is so
pleasing unto him that he will reveal his secrets unto them that use it, and
hide nothing that may be for their comfort. On the contrary from such as are
careless of this duty, he will hide his secrets, his councels, yea without
repentance, all his comforts, and the light of his countenance for ever. Let
these things be thought on, and stir us up to faithfulness in any place of
rule and government.

VER. 8. Who has also declared unto us your love, which ye have by the Spirit.
Come we to the eight verse, where the Apostle proves that Epaphras was
faithful for the good of the Colossians, because he gave testimony of their
love. To omit other acceptions, the words are thus to be understood that
Epaphras made known to Paul and Timothy what love the Colossians bare unto
them (for he spoke of all their love to all the Saints before, verse. 4.) and the
words carry this sense; which ye have being far from us in body, that you do
inwardly affect us in soul and spirit, though you be far distant from us in
body and that the word (spirit) is sometimes thus taken, appears cap. 2. of
this Epistle ver. 5. though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
spirit.

Here first we are to mark that the Apostle commends Epaphras for reporting
unto him how the Colossians loved him and Timothy, which may minister this
instruction: that it is an excellent virtue for such as have intercourse and
pass between party and party, to relate and speak of things that may
engender, and increase true mutual love and Christian affection between them,
thus did Epaphras, he no doubt made known to the Colossians, what an excellent
Apostle Paul was, again he declared to him, what love the Colossians bare
unto him, to stir him up in affection toward them, hence it is that we find
it among the virtues of special note, Phil. 4.8.
to think and speak of things that pertain to love: will we see a reason of
this it is soon given, any man may easily conceive it, if he do but consider
as he ought the excellency of true Christian love amongst men, it being that
which is driven at in all commandments of the second table, and that which
makes all good duties profitable and good to our brethren, 1. Cor. 13.
as the Apostle proves at large, and love being thus excellent, surely the
speaking of such things, as tend to the furtherance and increase of it,
mutually amongst men must needs be a special virtue and a worthy grace of a
good Christian. Carrying of tales between parties is a notable vice. Pro. 26.20.
and increase love, is an excellent virtue. Then the contrary to this to carry
such tales and reports between parties which are as wood to the fire, to
stir up strife, to set men at ods and difference, cannot choose but be a
notable vice, and the very character and badge of a lewd person, and a fault
too common in the world, some there be who make tale telling so common a
practice, as there is not an honest man or woman that has not some time or
other been wounded by the stroke of the ranging tongue of the talebearer;
but let such as are guilty of this sin, consider the ugliness of it, let
them consider beside this, that it is the property of a vile nature, to seek
by tales to make others vile, that it is the very bane and poison of
friendship, and the cutthroat of amity, a degree of murder, Ezech. 22.9.
so says the Lord that in Jerusalem were men that carried tales to shed blood.
Let them I say further consider the^ reach of this sin, it reaches not only
to the killing of the bodies, but of the soul of many at one blow; we say, it
is a shrewd blow that killes three at once. Now the tale-teller (without Gods
mercy) killes his own soul, and peradventure the souls of twenty more,
Psalm. 12.3.
who rashly upon the hearing of a false tale condemn the innocent, the Lord
therefore stirred up the spirit of David, to pray that God would root out all
deceitful lips. If these things be thought on, they are sufficient to
breed in a heart not given over to it self, a detestation of this sin, and
let us take heed, the Devil deceiues us not in this case, for he will force
this upon us under many fair pretenses, as that we are sorry that our
neighbors has done so, that we speak not of malice, nor all we could speak.

Let us beware of this subtilty, and learn to avoid this sin.

From the last words (which ye have by the spirit) the True believers love one
another though they see not the face one of another.
that true believers love one another though they never see the face one of
another, which argues true love not rising from any outward thing, either
pleasure or profit, the ground of this, is their union with Christ, for they
that are one with Christ, cannot but be one in heart among themselves, how
far distant soever they be one from another in body: and let us hereby
try our love to the Saints of God, We are hereby to try our love to the
Saints of God. 1. Ioh. 3.14.
of whom we hear well and yet never saw them, if we love them as heartily as
our own son or brother, then our love is true spiritual love, and a
testimony of our adoption. We know that we are translated from death to life,
because we love the brethren.

VER. 9. For this cause we also since the day we heard of it, cease not to
pray for you, and to desire that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge of his
will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.
The Apostle having finished the first part of the preface of this Epistle, his
congratulation or rejoicing for the Colossians. The second part of the preface
of this Epistle, the Apostles comprecation.
In this ninth verse, he comes to the second part, his comprecation or prayer
for them, which is laid down in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh verses. In this
ninth verse, he first sets down the moving cause, what moved him to pray,
namely, the same that moved him to give thanks, (for this cause etc.)
together with the continuance of his prayer, that from the day, he heard of
their faith and love, he continued to pray for them, and then further he makes
known in what manner he prayed, namely with desire, after that follows the
matter of his prayer, that they might be fulfilled with knowledge, which
knowledge is limited by the object, namely the will of God, and further
amplified by two special things, wherein it does consist, namely, wisdom and
understanding, and both these spiritual. These be the parts of this ninth
verse. Touching the words not to say any thing of the moving cause, that
stirred the Apostle to pray for the Colossians, having spoken of that, in verse
the third, nor yet of the continuance of his prayer, that he ceased not to pray
for them.

Prayer is a special means for the increase of our spiritual knowledge.
and to make us increase in knowledge and spiritual understanding. The Apostle
thought it not sufficient to write unto the Colossians and to labor with them
by instruction and exhortation to confirm them in the true faith, but he
further says he ceased not to be instant with the Lord in prayer for them,
that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will, whence it follows
that prayer, not only of others, but of us for our selves, is a notable means
for the increase of our spiritual knowledge, Iam. 1.5.
this is taught most plainly if any man lack wisdom, if any having a small
measure of wisdom find an emptines, a defect and want of wisdom and knowledge
(as no man but shall if he be able to sift his own brain) and would have a
supply, let him ask of God which gives to all men liberally, and reproacheth
no man, and it shall be given him. The reasons of this are these: first, it is
a confessed truth, that the knowledge of Gods will revealed in his word, comes
by illumination of the spirit of Christ in whose power it is to open and shut
the book of God at his pleasure. We are not able of our selves, to understand
the plainest things delivered in the word. Luke 11.13.
Now the spirit of grace and illumination is obtained by the prayer of faith:
so says our Savior, if ye which are evil, can give good gifts unto your
Children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Ghost to them
that desire him? Whence it follows necessarily that prayer is a special
means for the increase of knowledge. Again true prayer, the prayer of faith
is not only a means to fit, to prepare and to sanctify out hearts to receive
grace; but even the very action of prayer, though it do not merit, yet does it
increase in some particulars, a further measure of grace and sanctification:
for example, true prayer for the pardon of sin works greater care to avoid
sin, it is not possible that a man should make a plain and hearty confession
of any sin to God in prayer and desire him to pardon it and promise
amendment, but that by the very confession he should be bettered and further
off from that sin: Hence it is that our Savior says, watch and pray, that
ye enter not into tentation: Mat. 26.41.
that he may be strengthened and better able to withstand temptation. So then,
prayer being a means to fit, and prepare our hearts to receive grace, and the
very action of prayer increasing a further measure of grace, in some
particulars, it must needs be a notable means for the increase of spiritual
knowledge.

For the use When we come to the hearing of the word we are to prepare our
selves by prayer.
when we are to come to the hearing of the word to be further informed in the
way of God, remember we then to prepare our selves by prayer to lift up our
hearts in earnest and hearty prayer unto God that the eyes of our minds may be
opened, that we may rightly understand things delivered, and that our wills and
affections may be transformed into an holy obedience to the will of God made
known unto us: for certainly it is a true speech one has, though God himself
should appear in the likeness of man and speak unto us, yet if he did not
also move and direct us by his inward grace his preaching would be unprofitable
unto us. We are therefore by prayer to crave the assistance of his spirit. Many
never think of this duty, many of us either lie securely bathing our selves in
our beds till the instant time of coming to the public assembly, or else if
we rise it is either to follow after worldly affairs, or to trick and trim up
our bodies, and few or none of us have any care to fit and prepare our selves
to sanctify our souls before we come to the hearing of the word, but we come
laden with our sins and with our minds ouercharged with diverse lusts, and so
it comes to pass that the speech of the Apostle is verified upon us, 2. Tim.
3.7.
that we are ever learning and yet never able to come to the sound knowledge of
the truth. And how can it otherwise be, but that as many of us as come without
preparation by prayer should be unfit to attain sound knowledge, for so coming
we rashly presume we can understand Gods mysteries by the strength of our own
wits, and so are justly confounded, and overwhelmed with the majesty and
brightness of them; Again we must know, that prayer is to the soul as
exercise to the body, and as men use exercise of the body, especially before
meat to stir up natural heat to quicken the spirits, and to sharpen the
stomach, so prayer must be used before we come to the feeding of our souls to
stir up spiritual motions in our hearts, and to work in us an holy appetite
and desire after the word, an hunger and thirst after the heavenly food of our
souls; as men for want of bodily exercise, sit sometimes at a table well
furnished with good and wholesome meat, and yet can eat little or nothing; so
we shall find, that for want of preparation, by the exercise of prayer, many
sit before the Preacher, and are not able to taste or feel any true sweetness
in any thing laid before them, nay they are heavy and sluggish, and unfit to
receive any good. Remember therefore before we come to the hearing or the word,
to lift up our souls in prayer to God, and even to stretch out the faculties
and powers of our souls, as men in bodily exercise stretch out the ioints of
their bodies, we shall thereby no doubt find and feel a great alteration in
our souls, that they are more quick and ready to receive heavenly
nourishment. Come we now to the manner of the Apostles prayer in respect of his
inward affection, that he prayed with desire.

In that he says, he did not only pray for the Colossians, True prayer must be
with inward feruencie and desire of the heart.
we are taught that true prayer must be with inward feruencie, with an holy
sanctified desire of the heart. Prayer must be rather a travel of the heart,
then a labor of the lips. Hence it is said to be a pouring out of the soul,
1. Sam. 1.15. Psalm. 141.2.
and compared to incense: to note unto us, that it must be offered up as it
were by fire, it must proceed from the heat of the heart, that it may be a
sweet smelling sacrifice to God. It is to be marked, that our Savior says
not, whatsoever ye pray for, but whatsoever ye desire when ye pray, believe
that ye shall have it, and it shall be done unto you. And that prayer must be
with an inward desire, it appears even by the Lords manner of dealing with his
children, Mark 11.24.
who uses means to whet and sharpen their desires, sometimes by deferring to
grant their requests. Thus he dealt with Moses: The Lords purpose was to spare
the people: yet when Moses prayed for them, Exodus 32.
the Lord said, ver. 10 Let me alone. And sometimes by afflicting of them: thus
he dealt with David. Psalm. 42.4.
When I remembered these things, I powered out my very heart because I had gone
with the multitude, and led them into the house of God, with the voice of
singing and praise, as a multitude that keeps a feast. And the Lord using
thus to deal with his children, does plainly euince and prove the doctrine
delivered.

We are to examine our selves how we pray.
and to show that men power out their prayers only of form and fashion,
without any sanctified disposition, or holy desire of their hearts; let us
insist in one particular, whereby we may easily see how men fail in this duty
and do not pray as they ought, with a true inward desire of their hearts: the
thing is this, men sometimes pray unto God, that they may abstain from some
known sin, a sin wounding and wasting their consciences, and they seem to
pray with desire that they may abstain from it, but the event many times
shows the contrary; for they find no fruit of their prayers, it vanishes,
and they lie still in that sin unreformed. For example, a man given to
customarie swearing, being told of it, and reproved for it, he will sometimes
lift up his voice in prayer, and say, I pray God give me grace to leave it,
which is a good speech, and a speech bearing show of inward desire to leave
that sin, but indeed many times there is no such matter, for he still forgets
himself, and oaths are still common with him. But will some say, judge that
and from thence I dare be bold to tell thee, that thy desire is no true desire,
when it is only a bare desire, when it cease and is at an end so soon as it
is uttered, and thou have no further care to use other sanctified means, to
help and strengthen thee against thy sin, as hearing, reading, and
meditating on the threatenings and judgments of God against that sin. Number.
23.10.
For thus it was with Balaam he desired to die the death of the righteous; but
his desire was no sooner uttered, but it was at an end: he had no care to live
a sanctified life, that leads to a blessed and comfortable death. Such as pray
for grace and strength against sin with a true sanctified desire, they join
to their desire, the holy use of other means, and their desire is not flitting
and vanishing, but constant, and they give the Lord no rest till he grant their
desire, yea they use vehement and urging arguments to the Lord, to move him to
grant it; they urge the former favor and mercy of God in helping them against
other sins: they pray that the Lord will not suffer their enemy Satan to
overcome them: they press the Lord with his promise, Ask and you shall have,
seek and you shall find. Thus it is with them that have a true sanctified
desire of grace and strength against sin. And to stir up our dullness in
this case, consider we, first that prayer without a true desire of the heart is
mere mockery, and cannot escape unpunished, the Lord denounces a woe against
it. Again, Hosea 7.14.
prayer sent out from a true desire of the heart, and offered up in Christ, is
pleasing to God, yea though it be but a desire true and hearty, when the voice
fails, yet then it pierces the clouds. Look on the example of Hannah: She
spoke in her heart, 1. Sam. 1.13.
her lips did move only, but her voice was not heard; and the Lord heard her:
And upon the example of Hezechiah: Isay 38, 14.
Like a Crane did he chatter, yet the Lord heard his prayer. And this is both a
notable comfort, and also a notable inducement to stir us up to power out our
prayers, with an inward feruencie, and with an holy desire of our hearts. Now
to the matter of the Apostles prayer in the words following (that they might be
fulfilled with knowledge in all wisdom and spiritual understanding) with the
limitation in respect of the object, the will of God. The words carry this
sense, that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge, that is to say, that ye might
increase in knowledge, and come to that measure the Lord has appointed
necessary for salvation, Ephesians. 4.7.
(for some of the members of Christ have one measure, some another, according
to that) yet every one so much as is necessary to salvation, which the Apostle
here prayed for (of his will) that is the will of God revealed touching things
to be believed and practiced. Credenda and sacienda.
Now in that the Apostle lifts up his prayer to God, for the Colossians, and
desired of him, that they having some measure of knowledge Both the beginning
and further measure of illumination is the free gift of God.
but a further measure of illumination and understanding of Gods will, is the
free gift of God, it is the Lords bounty and largess, it comes unto us as
alms to beggars, freely, it is gotten by earnest entreating and suing for, at
the hands of God, yet not for the merit of any entreaty, as the beggar gets
not his alms for the worthiness of his craving, but of the mere bounty of
the giver. So we get increase of knowledge from the mere mercy of God, and in
greater or less measure according to the good pleasure of the Lord. The
Apostle says, that the spirit distributeth his gifts as he will, 1. Cor. 12.11.
the distribution of the gifts of Gods spirit is voluntary, therefore free, and
the unequal distribution of the gift of knowledge, in that some have a greater
measure of knowledge then others, is a clear proof that the increase comes
from the mere bounty of the Lord, not from respect had of any thing in us; for
if the Lord should give a different measure of knowledge, not freely, but upon
desert, then in all likelihood they who have a greater measure of faith, should
have a greater measure of knowledge, but we may many times observe the
contrary, that they have more knowledge, who have a less measure of Faith, yea
sometimes they who have no saving faith, have such a measure of knowledge as
they are able to prophecy: Mat. 7.22.
therefore both the beginning and the increase of our knowledge of the will of
God is the free gift of God.

Let this teach us, Having some knowledge of Gods will revealed in his word,
we must not think that we are able to come by the strength of our own will.
any little knowledge of his will revealed in his word not to be lift up in
conceit of our own wit, as if then we were able to go on by our own
strength, if we do, we shall find a curse upon our wits, and by them we
shall be led into many erroneous opinions. If we observe it we shall find
this has been the mother of many foul and dangerous errors, when men having
some general illumination, some knowledge of Gods will revealed have then
thought themselves able to go on by the strength of their own wit, they have
been left to themselves and then have run into many errors, witness the
best learned among the Papists who resting on a conceit of their school
subtilties and distinctions invented by their own wits have run into most
gross and palpable absurdities, and have stiffely and obstinately stood in
defense of them, we must therefore learn, in going on in the knowledge of Gods
will not to rest on the strength of our own wits, but upon the blessing of God
upon them, use the benefit of wit and understanding in humility, for wit in it
self is no cause of wandering out of the way, into bypath of error and
heresy. Moses, Daniel, and David had excellent wits, but they were humbled and
sanctified, and so great helps unto them, it is not wit in it self, but our
proud conceit of wit, and too much resting in the seat of reason, which makes
us run into error, for that will not suffer us to subject our selves to the
simplicity of the word of God, we must therefore take heed of it. In the second
place, in that the Apostle in the fourth verse gave testimony of the faith of
the Colossians, and now prayed for the increase of their knowledge of the will
of God.

We learn that such as truly believe in Christ, and are able to testify their
faith to others, True believers being able to testify their faith to others,
may want knowledge of some things revealed in the word of God. Matthew. 16.
yet have their want of knowledge of the will of God, and may be ignorant of
some things revealed, the Lord gives them not a full measure of knowledge at
the first, but only some degree which is afterward increased. Thus our Savior
dealt with his Apostles, when they had confessed, that he was the Christ the
son of the living God, yet they knew not, the articles of his death and
resurrection, it is therefore said ver. 21. from that time forth, Jesus
began to show unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things of the Elders, and of the high Priests, and Scribes and be slain,
and rise again the third day. We read though Apollos was an eloquent man and
mighty in the Scriptures which did argue an excellent measure of knowledge,
Acts. 18.
yet he had his want of knowledge: even two of his Auditors, Aquila and
Priscilla, as we find verse 26. took him home with them, and expounded the way
of God more perfectly unto him, yea Saint Paul testified of himself, that he
might increase in comfort and strength of faith, by the faith of the Romans.
Now the reason why the Lord gives knowledge unto us by degrees, Romans 1.12.
is this, because though a man's mind enlightened and sanctified, be of great
capacity and will receive a great measure of knowledge, yet it is able to
receive but little at once, it is like a violl, or a glass, with a narrow
mouth, that must have water or some other liquid matter, put into it, drop
after drop. Mark. 4.33.
Hence it is said, that our Savior preached the word unto the people as they
were able to hear and understand it.

We must come to receive knowledge of the will of God by degrees.
by little and little, then let every one of us look so to receive it, let
every one attend with diligence on the ordinance of God, the preaching of his
word the ordinary means of knowledge, and let him look to receive knowledge
of the will of God by degrees, one measure after another, or one measure unto
another, for we must retain and hold things heard and learned, and add unto
them every time, we hear, further measure of knowledge, otherwise we cannot
look to be fulfilled with knowledge, as the Apostle here prayed, a vessel that
has a narrow mouth and an hole in the bottom ever open, can never be filled by
pouring water into it: no more can our minds be filled with knowledge, being
hard to receive, and having no retentiue faculty, no power to retain things
heard, and learned, but as fast as they are powered in they run out, and pass
away without profit, a fault that does rest upon many hearers of the word, who
hear many things and happily understand and receive them with joy for the
present, but after a while become forgetful hearers, as James 1.25. and let
slip the things they have heard, as if they had never heard them, these cannot
come to the hearing of the word, to be further filled because they have nothing
but emptiness in them, the things formerly received are gone, they are like
the mill turned about daily but with new water, well let such loose and
wretchlesse hearers consider, that it is not the hearing, the bare
understanding, nor the delight for the present, but the power of the doctrine
of the word remaining in us, that shall save our souls, by forgetting and
letting slip out of our minds good things received: Revel. 3.3.
we decline and decay in all good duties, the Lord therefore persuades with
the Church of Sardi, to recover herself from her declining, by remembering and
holding fast things received, the holy Ghost says that we ought diligently to
give heed to the things which we have heard, least at any time, Heb. 21.2.
we should let them slip, and mark the weight of his reason following,
strengthened by comparison, if the word spoken by Angels (that is to say the
Law) was steadfast, and every transgression, and disobedience received a just
recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,
that is to say the Gospel, which at the first began to be preached by the
Lord; which we do when we let slip the things we have heard, and so we bring
on our selves punishment proportionable to the excellency of the Gospel and
the first preacher of it Christ Jesus.

A small measure of knowledge of the will of God, will not serve to divert us
in the way to salvation. Phil. 1.9.
that must direct us in the way to life and salvation. The Apostle therefore
here prays that the Colossians might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will,
in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, and this I pray, that your love
may abound yet more and more, in knowledge. and in all judgment. One special
reason of this, is because the knowledge of Gods will must not only guide us
in particular actions of life which are innumerable: but must guide the inward
motions of the mind, will and affections which are most wayward, and hard to
be brought into subjection to any good, for a man may be able sometimes to
bridle himself in outward actions, but not to restrain the thoughts of his
heart.

We must not content our selves with a smattering knowledge of God will
revealed.
A man in his trade will not content himself with small skill if he be able to
reach further, and shall we then rest contented with a little, and small
measure of knowledge of Gods will revealed in his word. Look how much
knowledge we have of Gods will, so much knowledge have we of God himself and
of our own salvation, because God reuealeth himself and the means of
Salvation in the word, and without the knowledge of that, there is no knowledge
of God or of salvation. They that know not God in some measure the will of God
revealed in his word cannot know God, and so cannot know Gods mercy for their
own salvation, for if we know not God, God will never know us to our comfort,
therefore let us not content ourselves with a small measure of knowledge of
Gods will revealed in his word, but labor daily for a greater measure and
increase. In the last words of this verse the Apostle sets down two things
wherein the knowledge of Gods will does consist, namely wisdom, and
understanding and both spiritual. The word wisdom has many acceptions in the
Scripture, sometimes it is put to signify an evil quality, 2. Sam. 14.2.
the wisdom of the world properly called craft and subtilty, sometimes it is
taken in a good sense and then also diversely, as sometimes to signify the
doctrine of wisdom, sometimes the habit or quality of wisdom in the word,
1. Cor. 2.6.
and so it is taken in this place because it stands here in relation to the
will of God, and by it is meant, an ability or power of the mind above nature,
whereby the mind being cleared and disburdened of natural dullness,
unbelief, ignorance and vanity, is able soundly and truly to apprehend, to
acknowledge and embrace the known truth of the word of God as the Lord says on
the contrary, Ier. 8.9.
they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them? though
they had the law amongst them ver. 8. yet because they did not truly apprehend
and believe it, they are said to reject it, and consequently had no wisdom in
them, whence it is clear, that when we are wise in the knowledge of the will
of God, when we truly apprehend, acknowledge and embrace the known truth of
his word. The word (all) does not signify all kind of wisdom, but a full
measure of spiritual wisdom necessary to salvation. 1. Cor. 13.2.
So we find the word used, all faith, that is not all kinds of faith,
justifying faith is not there meant, but a full measure of faith of working
miracles. For the word (understanding) not to say any thing of the distinction
of it into the Theoricall and practical, by that word is meant, an ability and
power whereby the mind is able to apply the known truth of the word, to the
good ordering both of particular inward affections and outward things and
actions, as time, 1. Kin. 3 9.
place and person shall require. Thus Solomon prayed, that God would give him
an understanding heart, or understanding, whereby the affections of his heart
might be ordered and he might be able to judge and discern truly between
good and bad in particular causes and controversies, and give sentence
accordingly. Now both these, wisdom and understanding, must be spiritual,
that is, wrought in us by the spirit of Christ, on whom rests the spirit of
the Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of council and
strength, the spirit of knowledge, Isay. 11.2.
and of the fear of the Lord: thus then are these words to be conceived, as if
the Apostle had said in a sufficient true and sound apprehension of the truth
revealed in the word of God, and in a particular application of the same, to
the good ordering of all particular affections of your hearts, and the actions
of your lives, as the circumstance of time, place and person shall require
wrought in you by the spirit of Christ.

They are truly wise, who rightly conceive, acknowledge and embrace the truth
of the word of God: Psalm. 119 98.99.100.
standing in true apprehension of the truth revealed in his word, wisdom, we
are taught, that they indeed are truly wise, who rightly conceive, acknowledge
and embrace the truth of the word of God, they who have an eye upon the word,
and see the truth of that for their guide in all things, and are able to
govern themselves wisely, both in respect of inward affection and outward
action. Hence it was that David said, that by the commandments of God, he was
wiser then his enemies. Had more understanding then his teachers and the
ancient: and no marvel, though it was thus with David. There is reason to lead
us to think, that those who understand, what the will of the Lord is, are most
wise and indeed truly wise; first, because the will of the Lord made known in
the word, is the wisdom of the Lord revealed, manifesting such things, as the
wisdom of flesh and blood cannot reach unto: Therefore they who are able by a
supernatural light to conceive things contained in that, must needs be most
wise, according to the nature of the things understood, as they who are able to
conceive, and carry in mind the best rules of policy, are justly accounted
most politic. Again, they must needs be most wise, who are enabled to
provide for their own good estate, and that for ever, such are they who truly
conceive and embrace the truth revealed in the word, for that is able to make
wise to the Kingdom of God and eternal salvation. 2. Tim. 3.15. Object. Luke
16.8.


Some may say, we read that our Savior says, that the children of this world,
are in their generation wiser then the children of light, enlightened by the
spirit of God: how then is it true that they are most wise who rightly conceive
and embrace the truth of the word of God?

For answer,

Would we then (for use of this) be truly wise (no doubt every one desires it)
would we have that wisdom, They that would be truly wise, must labor to
know acknowledge and embrace the truth of Gods word.
that will make us wise to eternal happiness? then labor we rightly to
conceive, acknowledge and embrace the truth revealed in the word of God, that
is the wisdom of God, and able to make us wise and provident for our eternal
good. And to lead us on in this, consider we but this one thing, many men in
the world, carry a great show of wisdom, and indeed they are wise in their
kind, but they wanting this (if we observe it) we shall find that the Lord
does catch and confound them in their wisdom, and as he dealt with
Achitophell, he turns their plots and devices into foolishness. Nay which is
more familiar and easy for us to observe, we shall find that some that are
renowned for wisdom in the world and yet want this wisdom from the word;
they some way or other discover themselves, to be but stark fools, for
consider it, do not we see many times such as are able to speak well and
wisely and to give good council to others, and to manage their own outward
affairs with some good discretion, that they notwithhanding are tainted and
stained with some notorious sin, yea they are very monsters in the outrage of
sin; are not the wisest men of this world, many times grinding usurers,
extortioners, oppressors, greedy cormorants, hard dealers with their brethen,
such as defraud poor laborers of their hire, yea are they not sometimes
Alehouse and Tauerne-haunters, whore-hunters and such like. If we look into
the world we may easily observe it, that one way or other they discover the
weakness of that wisdom, the world does so much admire in them, the Lord
does punish the pride of their wisdom with some foul sin, and does suffer
them to yield to the subtilty of Satan, and deceit of sin, to make known
their folly by their sin, he does paint out their folly in their faces, and
set a Nouerint vniuersi upon them, and be it known to all men, that these whom
you account jolly wise men, behold they are mere fools. This must serve to
teach us and to stir us up, not to rest in such kind of wisdom, as is found
in the men of this world, but seek after that which is derived from the word
and so from God himself the fountain of all true wisdom. We are further to
mark that the Apostle in this place, ioynes wisdom and understanding
together. Whence it follows for our instruction; that it is not enough for us
to It is not sufficient to understand and take notice of Gods will, but it must
be applied to our particular occasions.
either commanding duty, promising mercy or threatening judgment, but we must
apply it to the ordering of our lives in particular actions, for as the
knowledge of Gods will is brought unto us, by the ministry of the word, not
only in the information of our understanding and judgment but in the use of
instruction in the way of righteousness and reformation of corruptions, both
of heart and life, so it must be received. Hence it is that David says, Psalm
119.105.
that the word was a lantern unto his feet, and a light unto his paths we are
to mark, that he says not, it was a light unto him to enlighten him, but to
his feet and path, giving us to understand that he did not rest in his
illumination by the word, and in his apprehension of the truth but he further
applied it, to the guiding of his particular steps in the ways of the Lord,
Else shall sin insinuate it self and get within our best actions.
and indeed there is great reason, why we should not content our selves with
the knowledge of the truth of the word, no nor yet with a temporary good liking
of it, without application of it, as particular occasion is every day offered
unto us, if we do; we shall find, that we shall not only faint under many
afflictions, but we shall fail in our best actions, sin will insinuate it
self, and get within them: hypocrisy will get into our prayers, hearing of
the word, receiving the Sacraments and almes-giuing; yea we shall fall into
many known sins. Consider the example of David, he doubtless knew the
nature and quality of adultery, and the judgments of God attending on it. Yet
because he made not special use and application of his knowledge he fell into
that sin. Use and Appication. Apply we therefore our knowledge diligently,
to the particular actions of our lives.
We see then the necessity of this duty: let us now suffer our selves in a word
or two, to be stirred up to the practice of it, and to this end know, that if
we conceive what is the will of the Lord in our best actions, in our hearing of
the word, prayer, receiving of the Sacraments, if we understand that we are to
perform them by faith, repentance fear, love, reverence, zeal, obedience and
humility: and do not apply this our knowledge, to the forming of them in this
manner, they become sin unto us, and abominable in the sight of God, Isay.
66.3.
even like the sacrifices of the Jews, yea I dare be bold to say, that the
knowledge of the death and passion of Christ, as it is a singular knowledge, so
without application it brings a singular judgment, if it be not applied both
for the remission of our sins and our sanctification, it shall be a great
increase of our condemnation: if then we would not have our best actions turned
to sin, yea, our knowledge of Christ a seal of condemnation: let us not
content our selves with the knowledge of the truth of the word of God, but
learn to apply it to particulars as occasion shall be offered.

VER. 10. That ye might walk worthy of the Lord, and please him in all things,
being fruitful in all good works, and increasing in the knowledge of God.
The Apostle sets down in this verse the end of his prayer for the Colossians:
to what end he prayed for them, namely, General resolution of the tenth verse.
that they might walk worthy of the Lod. Now because they might doubt how
far that extends, to walk worthy of the Lord, in the next words he explaines
it, even to the pleasing of him in all things, yea but might some say, how
shall we walk so worthy of the Lord, as that we may please him in all things.
The Apostle in the words following does tell us, by being fruitful in all good
works which is amplified in the last words, by the effect of such
fruitfulness, namely, a further measure of illumination and knowledge of God,
increasing in the knowledge of God. These are the general parts of this verse,
come we to the words as they are laid down by the Apostle. Particular
interpretations.
The word (walk) is well known to them that have any little reading in the
Scriptures, (who read with observation of the phrase) to be borrowed from
travelers signifying to live, or to hold on a course of life, either generally
in the duty of Christianity or in some particular place and calling, to walk
worthy of the Lord is not as the popish sort expound it, to live so as that by
Christian good life, we answer the justice of God, according to the rigor and
exact rule of justice, propounded in the moral Law, but that we walk in
uprightness, and sincerity of heart, as it is, Gen, 17, 1.
walk before me, and be then upright, and so as it becomes them who are
called by the Gospel, to be the sons and daughters of God, and to the hope
of salvation: the Apostle exhorts to walk worthy our vocation, Ephesians, 4, 1.
Philip. 1, 27.
and that our conversation be as it becomes the Gospel of Christ by which we
are called to be the sons of God, and to the hope of salvation, these two
places serve to expound this, and show that the words are thus to be conceived,
as if the Apostle had said that ye might live both in respect of the duties of
Christianity, (of your particular place and calling, uprightly as in the
presence of the Lord, and as it becomes them who are called by the Gospel to
be the children of God, and to the hope of Salvation.

Doctrine. First, in that the Apostle prayed for the Colossians, Our knowledge
of Gods will ought to end in practice
things to be done which indeed are never truly known of us, but in the
practice of them, as we know not in such sort as we ought what any that is
over us, either Father or master or governor does command to be done, unless
we do it, for that is the end of their command, which is not known but in the
practice: again knowledge in many places of the Scripture is compared to
light, and wherefore is light given, but that we should walk in it. Wherefore
shines the sun, but that a man should go out to his labor, so the light of
knowledge is given that we should walk in it. Ephesians. 5.8.
It is the argument of the Apostle: ye were once darkness, but now are light
in the Lord: walk as children of light, the night is past, and the day is at
hand let us therefore cast away the works of darkness, and let us put on the
armor of light, so that we walk honestly as in the day, not in gluttony and
drunkenness, neither in chambering and wantonness, nor in strife and envying.

Look we that our life be proportionable to our knowledge and profession.
but we will seem to have gotten thus much knowledge, that we are to repent of
our sins, and believe in Christ, that we may be justified and saved, we
will think there is great disgrace and indignity offered the meanest of us, if
we be told we know not these things: though few indeed know them as they ought.
Now then as we profess that we know in some measure the doctrine of faith and
repentance, Note.
so let us look that our life be proportionable to our knowledge, that we
walk in that light that is given unto us, take heed we be not found sleeping
in the day light, and standing still and idle in the midst of our knowledge;
and in this case beware of the subtilty and cunning of the Devil, who so
persuades with many that though they know Faith and repentance to be the way to
life and salvation, yet they need not so presently, and so soon as they know
it, to walk in that way, but that it is enough for them to enter into that
path at the hour of their death, and sufficient to express the knowledge of
faith and repentance in death, and not in the course of their life, and to make
his persuasion plausible and powerful, he comes upon them, as he came upon our
Savior Christ himself with scriptum est, it is written, and he tells them
they may find it in the book of God; and that the thief on the cross
repented at his last hour, and was received to mercy, and by this he does so
bewitch many, that they mock at the doctrine of timely repentance, and sooth
up themselves in their profaneness, and say (tush) if we may have but time to
call for mercy at our death, it is enough, it is no matter for walking in the
way of repentance, what should a man trouble himself that way, till he grow
old, or be sick and lie upon his death bed, repentance shall save a man at
any time, and we hope to dye repentant, and the servants of God. Thus does the
Devil delude and deceive many a poor soul, we must take heed of this
subtilty and strong delusion of Satan, and that we may be armed and
strengthened against it, consider. First, that though true repentance be never
too late, yet late repentance is seldom or never found, a man that has lived
a lewd and a vicious life, and is now at the point to yield up the ghost,
sorrowing and greeuing, may justly doubt of his sorrow, whether it be true
godly sorrow or no, though it be about his sin, because he cannot well perceive
whether it proceed from a loathing of his sin, or from a fear of death, and
whether he be humbled before the mercy of the Lord, or in respect of his
punishing hand; we have one example indeed in the Scripture, the thief on the
cross that repened truly at his last hour, but we have a thousand to the
contrary. Now what a madness is it for a man to cast himself on such a
dangerous point, to enter into such a way wherein only one has escaped, and
thousands have perished. Again, though God have promised forgiveness to true
repentant sinners, yet has he not promised repentance to every sinner, that
every sinner shall repent when he lust, we find not that in all the book of
God: this we find, that he threatens such as know his will touching
repentance, and walk not accordingly, but sleep securely in their sins,
that he will come upon them suddenly, yea, so as he will be sure to find them
sleeping, the Lord threatened the Church of Sardi, Reu. 3.3.
that he would come upon her as a thief, who watches his time, and comes
when men are a sleep, yea more then that, for the thief by making a noise
happily awaketh those that are lodged in the house that he breaks into; but
the Lord says further to that Church, thou shall be still asleep, and shall
not know what hour I will come upon thee. This we see verified upon many, who
either are cut off by sudden death in the very act of sin, or if they have
time given, yet the Lord either takes away understanding from them, or sends
upon them such an horror and fearful expectation of his wrath that they
cannot repent, if then we would not have our sorrow doubtful, even such as we
ourselves may justly suspect not to be godly sorrow, but rather arising from
the weakness of the flesh, or bitterness of pain, if we would not have the
Lords wrath to surprise us, and to take us sleeping in sin, and cut us off
suddenly in our sin, let us learn to express the doctrine of repentance, not
only in death, but in our lives, and to walk according to the measure of our
knowledge of faith and repentance. In the next place in that the Apostle says
that the end of our knowledge of the will of God must be a walking worthy of
the Lord, that is as becomes such as are called by the Gospel to be his
children, we are taught that we must frame and portion out our lives according
to the measure Our life must be proportioned to the measure of Gods goodness
toward us.
we must walk according to the measure of mercy: if we persuade our selves
we have so great mercy vouchsafed us, as to be the sons and daughters of
God, we must lead our lives in a proportionable measure of holiness and
obedience, and walk as becomes sons, as the Apostle exhorts: Ephesians, 5.2 3.
Walk in love even as Christ has loved us, and has given himself for us, to
be an offering and sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to God. But fornication
and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as
it becomes Saints, there is the ground of his exhortation, that having
received so great mercy and grace to be Saints, we are to walk as is fitting
the Saints of God, and there is great reason why we should so walk, because
as the earth renders to the husbandman the fruit of his pains bestowed upon
it, so we should render to the Lord the fruit of his mercy bestowed upon us,
and that is repentance, Roman, 4, 2.
a renouncing of all ungodliness, and a living soberly and righteously, and
godly in this present world. Tit. 2.12.
And this is a duty of great It will seem to be a soueraign restraint from
sinning against God.
it would hold us back from many notorious sins, would men be so profane?
would they break out into such blasphemous oaths, such cursed speaking, such
drunkenness, such filthiness as many do, if they did keep in their mind a
register, and remembrance of Gods mercies and favors toward them in their
bodies and souls, in their friends, in their country, in their magistrates,
in their ministers or any other way; no doubtless, if such persons as are
carried with violence against their neighbors to smite them with the venom of
their railing and slanderous tongues, would but call to mind when they are in
their heat; and their raging and mad mood the Lords mercy toward
themselves, how the Lord has dealt with them in great mercy, both in their
creation and preservation, and many other innumerable blessings, and (as they
persuade themselves) in the greatest mercy of all, the forgiveness of their
sins, and that they are to walk accordingly. Would they then go on in their
fury? no without question, then as Nehemiah said cap. 6.11. should such a man
as I flee, so they would say, should such a man or such a woman as I that have
received so great mercy from the Lord, should I so far forget the Lords
mercy, as to rage, rave, and some out mine own shame against my brethren; no,
no, I will rather suffer any injury then I will do such wickedness and sin
against my gracious and merciful God, this no doubt would be the fruit of the
remembrance of this duty, let us then be careful to remember and think upon
it, that we are to walk in a measure of holiness answerable to Gods mercy
toward us, and know that if we do not so walk, we turn Gods grace into
wantonness, and then certainly the Lord will turn his mercy into judgment.
Now to the words following (and please him in all things) here the Apostle
makes known how far walking worthy of the Lord does extend, namely to the
pleasing of him in all things, the original words signify only thus much,
Interpretation.
to all pleasing, but having reference and respect to that which (goes before
the walking worthy of the Lord,) they may well be thus rendered, to his liking
in all things, to the pleasing of him in all things. Now to please the Lord is
(in a word) to obey the will of the Lord, according to that comparatiue speech,
1. Sam, 15, 22.
where we see, that to please the Lord, is to obey the will of the Lord (in all
things) that is in thought, word, and deed.

Ob.
We cannot please the Lord in all things, for who is it that sins not?

Math. 5.6.
to hunger and thirst after it, for upon that, our Savior pronounces a
blessing, we are to labor in truth and sincerity to obey the will of God in
all things, and if we fail in any things, (as we cannot choose but fail in
many things) yet we so endeavoring the Lord accepts our imperfect obedience in
Christ, in and by whom the weak obedience of true believers is accepted as the
Apostle says, thus then are these words to be conceived, 1. Pet. 2.5.
as if the Apostle had said, even to the hearty and sincere through imperfect
obedience of the will of God, in thought word and deed, which is pleasing unto
him by the mitigation and moderation of the Gospel, whereby the Lord does
moderate the rigor of the Law, and accept of your imperfect obedience as
pleasing unto him in Christ.

In that the Apostle does deliver the sincere obedience Our most sincere
obedience to Gods will cannot stand without reproof in the sight of God.
not of satisfying but of pleasing the Lord, and that only in Christ: we are
taught, that though we walk as becomes the children of God, yet we do not
thereby satisfy the justice of God; our true and most sincere obedience to the
will of God, is not able to stand without reproof in the sight of God, the
greatest and highest degree of excellency it can reach unto, is in Christ to
please the Lord. We shall find that the Apostle does often inculcate and beat
upon this point that our walking as becomes us, does please the Lord, 1 Thessalonians. 4.1. Heb 13.16.
but never that it does satisfy his justice. The cavil of the Papists on that
place is not worth the answering; they make (promeretur) to have a passive
signification, and so no latin word, but a barbarous term. The point
delivered may further be confirmed by this reason: there is no good thing done
by any believer and regenerate person, but it is stained by his intermedling
corruption. Even our righteousness is as a menstruous clout, and therefore not
our best and most sincere obedience can satisfy the justice of God, and stand
in his sight without reproof.

Against this reason the Papists take exception, Exception.
and say is the best obedience of true believers stained with sin, then it
cannot please God, for say they, shall we say, that a sinful work is a
pleasing sacrifice to God, that is blasphemy, the Lord hates sin and all
sinful works, so that either you must make the obedience of true believers
not sinful, or if sinful, then not pleasing to God.

Consutation of the Papists.
and make them more just in the sight of God. We must hold it for a truth, that
our best obedience is so far from satisfying the justice of God, as that it
pleases not God unless he behold it in mercy, and in the face of Jesus
Christ. Mark we further what the Apostle adioynes to the pleasing of the Lord,
that it must be in all things: our instruction thence is this, that true and
sincere obedience of the will of God must be entire, such as will approve
themselves to the Lord, and please him, must sincerely without doubling True
obedience to the will of God must be entire
yet it must be the purpose of our hearts, we must purpose to please him in all
things, and not to offend him in any thing, if we do, it must be against our
purpose. It is said of Josias that he turned to God according to the whole Law,
and of Zachary and Elizabeth, Luke 1.
that they walked in all the commandments of God: which is not to be
understood as that they kept the law in perfection, but in the purpose of their
heart, they did not wittingly break the commandments of God, and the reasons
why we are thus to please God in our purpose and endeavor are these. First
because the commandments of God are so conjoined and linked together, as the
transgression of one is the breaking of all, Iam. 2.10.
for he that breaks one is guilty of all. Again he that lives in the manifest
breach of any one commandment of God, if occasion be offered, he will break
all, he being not regenerate, as he does plainly show by his sin, if it be
for his profit or pleasure, he will break all the commandments of God. Hence
it follows necessarily, that sincere obedience to the will of God must be
entire.

Let no man therefore persuade himself, He that lives in any one known sin
cannot persuade himself that he is pleasing to God.
because the world which sees but the outside cannot convince him of sin,
when his own conscience tells him, he lives in the manifest breach of some
commandment of God. Neither let any one flatter himself that his ways please
God, because he does prosper in outward things, as many think they are highly
in Gods favor because they have prosperity: that is a leaden rule, only then
we please the Lord, when our obedience to his will is entire, when we purpose
and endeavor to approve our hearts and lives unto him in all things; and to
help us forward in this, know, Note.
that we can never have assurance of our own salvation, till we have this
holy purpose and godly endeavor, so long as we live in the manifest breach of
any commandment of God, though it be only known to our selves, our
consciences will not be settled, it will at one time or other rise up and
condemn us, and if our conscience condemn us, God is greater and knows all
things, 1 Ioh. 3.20.
if then we would not be in continual doubt of our own salvation, which is a
fearful step to desparation, let us put on a goodly purpose of heart to please
God in all things, both in thought, word and deed. The words following are an
answer to a doubt that might arise from the former part of this verse, for some
might say, how shall we walk worthy of the Lord: Interpretation.
the answer is by being fruitful in all good works, that word (fruitful) is
metaphorical, and borrowed from trees that bear fruit, that as fruitbearing
trees bring forth fruit according to their kind, so we are to bring forth good
works, and to be fruitful, is to bring forth good works, that is to say, holy
and good actions, 1. John 3.
for good works are opposed to actual sin, we find them proposed under
the name of actual righteousness, and set against actual sin, where Saint
John makes opposition between doing righteousness and committing sin, and
to do righteousness is to perform a good work, therefore, by good works we
are to understand holy and good actions: whereas the Apostle says further (in
all) his meaning is in all sorts of good works, inward and outward in body and
mind, to insist in the Apostles own similitude, as fruitful trees bring not
forth fruit only, on one bough or branch, but on every branch plenty of fruit,
so good works the fruits of believing Christians must be brought forth not
only by the hand, the foot, the tongue and other members, but in all the powers
of the soul, and in all and every member of the body.

Good works are fruits of faith.
here he faith, that he prayed further for them, that they might be fruitful
in all good works, whence we may conclude, that good works follow faith, and
are fruits of faith, we shall find this point if we observe it constantly,
taught by the Apostle. For first, he teaches that we are justified by faith in
Christ, and then sanctified, and that our sanctification is a fruit of our
justification, and therefore, good works which are part of sanctification,
they follow faith, and are fruits of faith in them that are justified. Hence it
is that he says, 1. Tim. 1.5.
that love and so the duties of love, good works, come out of a pure heart,
good conscience and faith unfeigned,

The use of this point may be this, are good works fruits of faith, then it is
erroneous, It is erroneous to say, that works are the form and life of faith.
nay, very absurd, to say as the Papists do, that they are the form and life
of faith, not to make faith to be faith, but to make it good, lively and
auailable to justification, for so they teach. Now this is very gross, who
knows not that it is contrary to all reason, being contrary to the course of
nature, to say, that the fruit gives life to the tree, every man that knows
any thing can say to the contrary, that the tree gives life to the fruit, so
says gives life to good works, not good works to faith, to make it
available to justification, the life and form of faith, by which it is
effectual to justify, is special affiance and trust on Gods mercy in Christ,
and though such faith cannot be without works after it have justified, they
follow upon it as fruits, yet do they not concur with faith to the forming
of it in the act of justification, they having relation to faith as fruits,
they only as fruits declare it to be effectual in it self, they give not
life unto it. In the next place in that the Apostle is not content to say,
(that ye might walk worthy of the Lord) but he adds Our obedience to Gods
will must not be only inward and habitual.
we are taught that our obedience must not be only inward and habitual, we
must not content our selves with the having of any grace, be it never so
excellent, be it faith or the fear of God, but we are to show it and let it
appear in the actions of faith and of the fear of God, as fruitful trees in
their season do bud and blossom and their fruits grow to ripeness, and yield
comfort to the owners, so our obedience and subjection to Gods will and grace
wrought in us, must show it self in the fruits of it, to the glory of God, and
the good of our brethren, and hence it is, that the Godly are called trees
planted by the water side which bring forth fruit in due season, yea, so
planted, Psalm. 1.3.
as that in respect of their rooting they feel not when the heat comes,
Ierem. 17.1.
and the year of drought cannot make them cease yielding fruit.

Thus it is with all Gods children, So it ought to be with all that have any
grace wroght in them.
we are to manifest in the fruits of grace, and there is great reason for this,
for why? the Lord will have his grace that is in us, known both to our selves
and others, that is the end of all the Lords dealing with us, either by
prosperity or adversity, to discover what is within us, what grace there is in
our hearts; we our selves cannot know whether we have any grace in us or no,
but by the fruits of it, for example, the sap of a tree being good, the tree
is good, yet it is not known to be good by the sap, but by the fruits of it,
so we are not known to be good and to have grace in us, but by the fruits of
grace, and therefore the grace that is wrought in us, must appear in the
fruits of it, the fear of God must show it self in the fruits of it, yea, in
the proper fruits, such as properly issue and come from the grace of Gods
fear, wrought in the hearts of Gods Children, and those are specially these,
even a trembling and a reverent awe of God in prosperity, and a willing and
joyful subjection to his will in adversity, not to be lift up in pride, or to
lie securely in sin in prosperity, or to be utterly dejected in time of
adversity, but to tremble before the Lord in prosperity, when the hearts of the
wicked are most lift up, and to be inwardly comforted in the Lord in time of
adversity, these be the fruits that must be sent forth from the inward root the
true fear of God, and thus the grace of God, that is in us whatsoever it be,
must appear in the fruits of it. And that we may be stirred up to this duty,
consider we that the Lord will not, acknowledge any grace in us, unless it
appear in the fruits, the Lord says to Abraham, when he saw his willingness
to offer his son in sacrifice, now I know that thou fear me, seeing for my
sake thou have not spared thine only son: Genesis 22.12.
The Lord knew what heart was in Abraham before, he knows the hearts of all
his, but then by that fruit he did acknowledge his true fear to be in him: so
does the Lord, then acknowledge any grace in us, when it appears in the fruits
of it; again, we must know if we content our selves with the habit of
righteousness in the having of any grace in our hearts, the Papists shall rise
up in judgment against us, and condemn us, for they bring forth the fruits of
their false religion, and blind devotion, yea the very Athiests and vilest
Miscreants of the world, shall stand up in judgment against us, for they walk
after their lusts, they show the corruption of their hearts in all cursed
fruits of impiety and sin, let it then be a shame for us to be behind them;
let as many of us as persuade our selves we are religious and fearing God, be
stirred up to express the power and fruit of our religion and fear, that so
the Lord may acknowledge his own grace in us, wrought by his own good Spirit,
and that neither Papists nor Atheists may ever by the evidence of their
unsavory fruits, rise up against us in judgment, and condemn us.

Note we further, the Apostle says, fruitful in all good We must express
grace received in all good fruits.
whence we are taught that we are to express the grace that is in us by all
good fruits, for as true regeneration is universal, a transformation of the
whole man into the image of Christ, so it must appear and show it self in all
the powers of the soul, and if we be able to do much, we are not to content
our selves with doing a little, as the Lord shall enable us, we must be
fruitful in all good works and this is indeed a sure testimony of the
soundness of religion. Before we leave these words, a cavil of the Popish
sort occasioned from this, and the like places of Scripture, is to be
answered. Hence the Papists take occasion to wrangle and to reason against that
truth taught by our Church, that the best works of believers are stained with
sin, after this manner (say they) we find that the holy Ghost here and in
other places of Scripture calls many works of believers, good works, and
we must needs think the holy Ghost speaks the truth: but if they were
infected with sin, they could not be truly called good, for it can be no
good work that fails either in substance or in circumstance, or that has
any one fault in it, bonum ex integra causa, malum ex quolibet defectu, that
is truly good, that is every way good, and that is bad that has any defect,
therefore you must either say, that the holy Ghost calls evil good, and that is
blasphemous, or else acknowledge many good works free from sin.



Reply.
Again, because they will say we find, works called good in concreto,
considered together with the doers, and as they are done by believers. Matthew,
3, 16.
Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and
glorify your father which is in heaven. The holy ghost calling works done by
us good it follows they are not infected with sin, for if they be infected (say
they) then they cannot be truly called good.

Interpretation.
we are to understand knowledge of things to be believed concerning God, either
touching his Essence, attributes, or works, but specially experimental
knowledge of his grace and mercy in Christ unto salvation, for these words
have reference to that in the 6. verse (truly knew the grace of God) the first
thing wear to observe from them, is from the dependence of them, with the
words going before, in that the Apostle says, being fruitful in all good works,
and so increasing in the knowledge of God, we are taught that fruitfulnes in
good works, it brings forth a further measure of divine and saving
Fruitfulness in good works brings forth a further measure of saving knowledge.
he that is fruitful in good works, he feeds upon his own works, and by the
very juice of such fruits; his knowledge of the grace of God is nourished and
increased, indeed many wicked men, whose lives, abound with much impiety, and
are ouerspread with cursed fruits of sin, have sometimes a great measure of
divine knowledge, and by study and pains, do increase it, but the point is
this, that divine and saving knowledge is increased by fruitfulnes in good
works, and this may further be confirmed by Scripture, John 7.17.
says our Savior, if any man do the will of God, he shall know of the
doctrine whether it be of God; he there proceeds from doing the will of God
to the knowledge of his doctrine. What man is he that fears the Lord? Psalm.
25.2.
him will he teach the way that he shall choose, and verse 14. the secret of the
Lord is revealed to them that fear him: and his covenant to give them
understanding: which words must needs be understood of increase of knowledge,
because no man fears the Lord with true filial fear, but he has some
knowledge of his mercy; and this also may be further strengthened by reasons.
First, the more we exercise ourselves in the fear of the Lord, the more holy
we are, and the more holy, the better able are we, to discern holy things;
as in manuary trades, the more a man of ordinary capacity does exercise
himself in his trade, the more cunning and skillful he becomes: so the
practice of holy duties, does help and strengthen understanding of holy
precepts. Secondly, the more holy we are, the nearer we come to the nature of
God, and to the purity of his word, and so we are better able to discern
things revealed from God in his word.

The use The right use of increasing in knowledge is to be doers of the thing
we do know.
learn the right method and order of proceeding. Do thou desire to increase
and to grow in the knowledge of God; then be a doer of that thou know
already, and thou shall be blessed in thy deed as James speaks, cap. 1.24.
thou shall find a blessing on thy good work, to bring forth a further measure
of knowledge. Many say they desire the knowledge of God, and to be instructed
in his ways, but in the mean while they will not forsake their own evil
ways, and so though they have means of instruction, they fail of their
purpose. Do thou come to the hearing of the word and think to be further
built up in saving knowledge, and yet art guilty to thy self, that thou art so
far from being fruitful in good works, as thou have not reformed that
sin of thine, whereof thou have often been convinced, be it pride,
covetousness, etc. I dare be bold to tell thee it is not possible, thou shall
find that the Lord will punish thy fruitless hearing, with dullness and
hardness of heart. A scorner seeks wisdom and finds it not, Prou. 14.6.
or she will not be found, for so much does the holy ghost imply in that
sentence, that the grace of Gods spirit estrangeth it self, not only from
such as scorn and deride religion, but from such as profess religion, and
li^e wickedly, from the proud and ungodly, and if God withhold or withdraw his
grace, what can follow, but heaviness of mind, hardness We are to go on
from one measure of saving knowledge to another.
being the very matter and substance of them, that we are to go on from one
measure of saving knowledge to another, we are to increase in the knowledge of
God. This truth appears both in general, that we are to grow in grace, and in
special, 2. Pet. 3.18.
that we are to grow in the knowledge of God, in one and the same sentence,
grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: the
equity and reason of it is laid down, they that know most, know but in part. 1.
Cor 13.9.
Therefore we are to labor every day for increase of holy knowledge, and to
that purpose let us consider, that if we have the means of knowledge, and do
not increase in knowledge, it argues Motive.
and that there is some secret distemperature in our souls, if a man eat and
drink, and find not his body thereby nourished and strengthened, he must
needs think all is not well within him; so if we come to the feeding of our
souls both by the word and sacraments, and find no increase of grace and
saving knowledge, it is more then a presumption that our souls are distempered
and much out of order. Again if we content our selves in our weak and small
measure of knowledge, we are in great danger to be seduced, and drawn into
any error, for certainly where we are weak (be it in understanding, or be it
in affection) there the temptation will come against us, at one time or other.
If then we would not make it more then probable, even plain to our selves,
that we have some festred sore, and some lurking disease in our hearts, if we
would not be corrupted and misled by popish inchanters, and seducers, and
perish together with them, let us labor to increase in knowledge, and holy
understanding, that we may find the truth, hold the truth, walk in the truth,
and live and die in the truth.

VER. 11. Strengthened with all might through his glorious power; unto all
patience, and long suffering with ioyfulnesse.
This verse is a continuance of the Apostles answer to the doubt arising from
the first words of the former verse, where the Apostle says, he prayed for the
Colossians that they might walk worthy of the Lord. Some might thereupon
demand, how shall we walk worthy of the Lord, his answer was begun in these
words, being fruitful in all good works, and here it is continued, that we
walk worthy of the Lord, note only by being fruitful in good works, but
also by being strengthened with all might. And withal the Apostle lays down
the efficient cause and beginning of that strength, namely the glorious power
of God, together with the use of it in two particulars, namely in patience and
long suffering (unto all patience and long suffering) and further makes known
the quality and condition of these two things in the last word (ioyfulnesse)
these are the general parts of this verse. Come we to the words of it, and
first of these words (strengthened with all might) through his glorious power,
by might is meant inward ability of mind and will, because this might is to be
used in patience and long suffering, Interpretation.
which are inward graces of the mind and will, and by all might, is meant all
kind of inward strength, answerable to the quality or multiplicity of trials
and affections (glorious power) by power we are to understand the actual
power of God, Psalm 115.3.
and that not general, whereby he effects what he wills. Our God is in
Heaven, he does whatsoever he will, Ephesians. 1.19.
but his more special power working grace in them that believe, and this is
called his glorious power, by an excellency, that is his power, specially
manifesting his glory, hence it is that we find his glory and power
promiscually put one for another: as thus then these first words are to be
conceived, Romans 6.4. Ephesians. 3.16.
strengthened with all kind of inward ability of mind and will, through the
actual power of God, which works grace in them that believe, to the special
manifestation of his glory. In the first place we are to mark the first word
of this verse (strengthened) the Apostle says not being strong in the time
present, as before, (being fruitful) and increasing, but in the time past
(strengthened) whence we may gather this point of instruction that strength to
bear affliction must not only show Strength to bear affliction must be
provided before affliction come
but it must be provided aforehand, we must be well appointed and furnished
with strength against the time of trouble, which must show it self in bearing
of it with patience. The Apostles words are very direct and plain, he says
we must be strengthened unto patience, and this is further cleared, where the
Apostle verse 10. exhorts to be strong in the Lord, Ephesians. 6.
and in the power of his might, and presently in the next word subioynes that
we must be armed, and at all points provided, and put on the complete armor
of God, that we may be able to stand against the assaults of the Devil, and
verse 13. For this cause (says he) take unto you the whole armor of God, that
we may be able to resist in the evil day, that is either of temptation or
affliction, Luke 21.19.
it is worthy observation to this purpose, that our Savior says, possess
your souls in patience, patience and strength to bear afflictions must be
ours, not by usurpation nor yet by lawful use and occupation, as a thing
borrowed for the present, but by just title and possession, we must have it of
our own, we must be provided of it to use when time shall serve, and the
reason and ground of this is, because we cannot have it at any time when we
please, Means to be used to furnish us with strength against time of affliction
for the satisfying of their desire let them know that the means are not only
general, as the word, prayer, etc serving to work and increase any grace in
them; but there be two things that peculiarly serve as special means to this
purpose, to furnish us and give us possession of strength against the time of
trouble and affliction, the first is a frequent and serious consideration of
the manner of our tenure, in what sort we hold and enjoy the good things of
this life, health, wealth and such like, that it is conditional, that we hold
them with condition of the cross, with a limitation of Gods correction, we
must often think on it, that the promise made that such as fear the Lord
shall eat the good things of the land, is with condition of the Lords trial
and correction that they shall eat them; unless it please the Lord otherwise to
try and correct them; again we are often to meditate on the immutability of
Gods love, that his love never changes, but he is the same good God, when he
afflicts, as when he prospers any of his children, if we persuade our
selves that we are within the compass of his special love, we must often
think upon it, that his love is without change, and that whom he loves once he
loves for ever, he may change our estate as seems good to him, from prosperity
to adversity, but he is the same good God, no changeling, good before
affliction, good in affliction, and ever good to his children, and if this be
thought upon and settled, it will furnish our hearts with a notable measure of
Christian courage and fortitude, we shall find our selves enabled with Jobs
strength, to bear the greatest affliction, these two things then must be
thought upon and remembered, Job 13.15.
that our hold of the good things of this life is conditional; and that Gods
love is unchangeable, and we shall then be provided of strength against the
time of trial and affliction; Strength to bear afflictions being not provided
aforehand makes men either become impatient, or else to use unlawful means.
or else have (it may be) a boldness, but a desperate boldness, without all
comfort, such as is commonly in cowards, who being put to an exigent, are
sometimes rashly bold, and desperately hardy, but we shall not be able to be
bold with consideration as the preacher has taught us. In the day of wealth be
of good comfort, and in the day of affliction consider, that is, consider the
author and use of thy affliction, let us then often think upon our hold of
the goods of this life, and the immutability of Gods love, that so we may be
strengthened to bear with consideration the greatest affliction. It follows
(with all might) as the first word teaches that strength must be provided, so
these words show the measure of provision, that we must every way be
furnished with strength to bear affliction, if there were only one kind of
calamity and affliction, then one sort of strength We must every way be
furnished with strength to bear affliction Psalm. 34.19.
yea a thousand fold, many and great troubles, our strength must be answerable
I might here run into a large field and speak much of the afflictions of
Gods children, and thereby prove that we ought every way to be provided of
strength to bear them, but I choose rather to apply this. And for the use know
we it is not sufficient for us to be provided of strength in mind only, but
our hearts must also be furnished with strength, as we use to say, that a man
that endures any pain stoutly and unappalled, he is a man of a stout heart:
so indeed it may truly be said, when any affliction is borne with patience and
comfort, that the heart is stablished with Christian courage, we must not
only know that the good things of this life are held with a condition of the
cross, and that Gods love never changes; but we must in preparation of heart
be ready willingly to forgo these good things and be fully assured in our
hearts of Gods love toward us, howsoever he deal with us though he should
kill us as Job speaks; that is the right way to be strengthened with all might
to bear afflictions with patience, and to be at all points provided against
impatiency, for indeed it is the right way to be strengthened against any
sin, to have the heart stablished with grace; as the way to keep out
covetousness, is not as the Popish sort teach by wilful casting away our
goods, and vowing voluntary poverty, there may be great corruptions in the
heart after such devised means are used, because they are not ordained of God
they are not blessed, but by casting out of the heart distrust of Gods
providence and too much love of this world, that is the way to keep out
covetousness, and so the way to be strengthened unto all patience, is to be
ready in preparation of heart to forgo all the good things of this life, and to
be fully assured of Gods unchangeable love toward us, and to help us forward
in We are to consider that affliction will discover, what is in us.
consider we, that when affliction comes it will try our strength whether our
strength be only in our heads or sunk down and settled in our hearts or no,
as one says well, affliction is a very tell-tale, it will look into every
corner of us, and draw out from us what is within, it will discover and tell
abroad to all that look upon us what is in our hearts, whether weakness or
strength, we know it made a difference between Job and his wife in this kind
though both of them were happily strong aforehand in their measure of
understanding touching the nature, author, and quality of affliction, yet when
affliction came it discovered in the one strength and in the other weakness
of heart, so it will do with us, and therefore it behooves us to labor to
be strengthened with all might, that when trial of affliction comes, it may
not shame us, laying open our weakness to all the world, pray we ever with
David that our hearts may be sound, that we be not ashamed, sound without
halting and dissembling, sound without distrust, the root of grudging and
complaining, that so we may be sound and strong both in mind and heart, unto
all patience and comfort in the greatest trial and affliction. Come we to the
efficient and beginning of strength to bear all afflictions, namely the
glorious power of God, that is his actual power, whence first briefly observe
we that the actual power of God, does not only work upon the will of man
by changing it in the first conversion, which the Papists deny, who say it is
in the power of man's will, either to receive or refuse grace offered, clean
contrary to many places of Scripture. I will not stand to reason that point
with them.

But hence it appears that the power of God does not The power of God not only
works on the will in the first conversion but a^terward also. Heb. 6.19.
but does likewise afterward work strength in them that believe, and this is
to be observed, to this purpose it teaches us, whence it is that true
justifying faith fails not; and that hope is said to be an anchor sure and
steadfast; this comes to pass, through the power of Christ; which in his
members is a continued power, working strength and hability in them, and never
wholly interrupted, it is not any virtue or excellency in faith it self, or in
hope it self, that makes either of them, of never failing continuance, for
both faith and hope are changeable in themselves, and nothing in it self
unchangeable but God, but the power of Christ it is ever working in some degree
in his members that makes faith not to fail, and hope an anchor sure and
steadfast.

Hence it is that the Apostle says, we are kept through faith unto salvation,
but how? Hence it is that faith never fails. 1. Pet. 1.5.
not by any strength in faith it self, but by the power of God. The words are
very pregnant for the proof of this, and very emphaticall, we are kept, or as
the original word is, being military, we are guarded as with a strong
garrison by the power of God, by which our faith is fenced and fortified
against all hostility, so as no enemy of our salvation can break in upon it,
to overcome it, we may be assured of it, as many as are begotten to a lively
hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that our faith shall stand and never
be quelled in the greatest Our strength by which we stand in affliction, is
no^ of our selves, but from the power of God.
strengthened and guarded by the omnipotent actual power of God; we are
further to observe that the power and strength by which we stand upright in the
time of trouble and bear with patience any affliction, is not of our selves,
but from the power of the Lord, we are strengthened with all might unto all
patience through his glorious power, for why? it is the actual power of God,
that does but support and strengthen faith as we have heard, and also does
work in them that believe, a feeling consideration of Gods unchangeable love
toward them, and a preparation of heart, willingly to bear any trouble, even
they that believe have not these things of themselves, but from the actual
power of God working in them. Hence it is that the Apostle says of himself,
Phil. 4.13.
that he was enabled and provided of strength, to endure any condition of life,
to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to have want: not by any power of
himself, but by the help of Christ, and again we shall find, that the
dearest servants of God, such as have had great measure of strength to bear
afflictions, if the Lord did but a little withdraw his hand from them, their
weakness has then appeared, we see it in Job who whilst he had the power
of God, to support and strengthen him, was able in his greatest extremity, when
he was touched not only in goods, but also in his children, to bless God,
and with wise consideration of the hand that smote him; to reprove and sharply
to check the folly of his wife. Yet we find that afterward, when the Lord did
but a little withdraw his hand, to show that Job stood not by his own
strength, but by his power, then did Jobs corruption and weakness show it
self, and cause him to break out into some unbeseeming terms of impatiency;
it is then most clear, that strength by which we stand in time of affliction
is not of our selves, but from the power of the Lord.

Confutation of the papists.
who teach that we may in this life have in us such perfection of inherent
righteousness, as is sufficient to defend us from all formal transgression of
Gods Law, and all deadly sins (as they call them); besides the error in the
ground of this opinion, which is an imagined perfection of righteousness in
this life, if it be laid to the doctrine delivered and proved, we shall find
they cannot stand together, for I hope, they will not deny impatiency to be
formal transgression of Gods Law, being a sin against the first commandment
of the first table, and we have proved it by warrant of the Apostle, and
strength of reason, that the power by which we stand in time of trial, and
are kept from impatiency, is not in our selves, but only from the actual
power of God, therefore not any perfection in us is sufficient to defend from
formal transgressions of Gods law: and to say we have such perfection of
goodness in us, as is able to keep us from such transgression, is to make our
inherent righteousness, stronger then ever was in Adam, in the time of
innocence, nay, it is to ascribe unto us that which is proper to God alone, for
he only cannot possibly sin, by reason of absolute and infinite goodness in
himself, and it is not the strength either of Man or Angel, that keeps him
from sinning, but the power of God, and the special grace of God upholding him.

Again, is the strength by which we stand in time of Let us in time of
trouble, be strong in the Lord, even in the power of his might. Ephesians: 6:10.
Heb. 11:34.
then let every one learn to follow the exhortation of the Apostle in time of
trial and affliction, to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,
some may say, how is that to be done? how shall I that am a weak creature, be
strong in the Lord? the holy Ghost has taught thee, that by faith, of weak,
thou may be made strong, get thou hold of the glorious working power of God
by faith, and thou shall draw down strength from him, to bear with comfort
the greatest trouble. We read of Stephen, Acts 7.55.
when his persecutors were raging mad against him, that in the midst of their
violence, his eye was in Heaven, his faith pierced the clouds, and came to the
presence of God, and drew down from thence strength, and comfort unto him in
the heat of his persecution, when his affliction was at the highest and sorest
upon him, thus it will be with us, if we be able by our faith to break
through the cloud of our affliction, that in the sense of flesh and blood
seems to separate between God and us, Motives to persuade to the practice of
the former use.
and to apprehend the glorious power of God: we shall then find his actual
power, working strength in us unto all patience. Let us therefore raise up our
hearts to an apprehensio^ of the power of God to strengthen us in time Exodus
11.1.
the Lord was not only able by his mighty power to give his people passage out
of Egypt, but to make Pharaoh that was so loath to let them go, as glad to
rid them away, as ever before he was desirous to hold them, what assurance
then may we have of such end, issue and strength, as he in his wisdom shall
know best for his children that by faith depend on him, seeing he is thus able.

David's argument of comfort, he was discouraged and taken up short by Saul,
and told that he was a boy: 1. Sam. 17.
What says David, O King I have found that God has heretofore given me
strength above nature, when I was in danger to be devoured of a Lion and of a
Bear. Therefore I doubt not but he will even now also be to me, as he has
been, thus ought we to raise up our selves upon former experience of the
Lords mighty power, that as he has been, so he will he powerful to
strengthen us, and so by faith to rest upon him.

Join to this as a third motive to stir us up, thus to through his glorious
power: therefore we may be assured, if by faith we rest upon the power of the
Lord, that the Lord may as well lose his power, or lose his glory, which is a
thing impossible, as we fail of strength from him in time of affliction. Let
these things be thought on, that it is comfortable to rest upon the
all-sufficient power of God, that our former experience of his power ought to
assure us of continual supply of strength, if by faith we still depend upon
him, and that his power working strength in them that believe, tends to
special manifestation of his glory, which ever was, and ever shall be dear
unto him: and therefore if we depend upon him by faith, we cannot fail of
strength in time of trouble and affliction. And let the consideration of these
things stir us up to lift up our hearts to heaven, and by faith to lay hold
of the actual power of God, that so in our greatest affliction we may be
strong in the Lord. Come we to the use of strength here prayed for, in two
things laid down in the words following (unto all etc.) and the quality and
condition of these two, Interpretation.
(ioifulnesse) by patience we are to understand a quiet subjection of our wills
to the will and pleasure of God, in time of any pressure, cross, or
affliction, even to the death, without either seeking unlawful means to ease
our selves, or breaking out into bitter terms; for that indeed is impatiencie,
when a man is displeased for the work of God upon him, and for laying his hand
on him, and afflicting him, and seeks others to ease himself by unlawful
means, or does foolishly charge God that he deals hardly with him, murmuring
and complaining against him, the Apostle adds (to all patience) his meaning is
to a quiet subjection of our wills to the will of God in any, yea in the
greatest affliction (long suffering) patience and long suffering differ not in
kind, but in the time: long suffering is not, as some would have it, a
distinct species or kind of subjection of the will to the will of God, in time
of affliction, but a continuance of it, because oftentimes the same affliction
continues long: the word therefore here used is translated, Iam. 5.7.
long patience (ioifulnesse) that is, with joy and comfort of heart.

We walk worthy of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, not only
by doing good, but also by bearing evil patiently.
as we heard before; whence we may conclude and gather, that we walk worthy
of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, not only by being fruitful
in all good works, and by doing good, but also by bearing evil with patience.
And to prove this a little further, know that the will of God revealed in his
word, especially in the word of the Gospel, teaches not only that good must
be done, but that evil likewise must be suffered. It is the general
Aphorism and sentence of the Gospel, Revel. 3.10.
that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer their measure of
affliction, and it teaches also how evil must be suffered, namely, with
patience: hence it is called the word of patience, teaching to suffer evil,
and how to suffer it; upon which ground it follows, that then we walk worthy
of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, when we both do good
commanded, and suffer evil laid upon us, with patience, as we are taught by
the Gospel; again, we are to consider, that then we walk worthy of the
Lord, when according to the measure of grace given, our life is conformable to
the life of Christ, and then only is it so, when we do good commanded, and
suffer evil laid upon us with patience; for his obedience was active and
passive, a fulfilling of the law in his life, and a suffering with patience the
cursed death of the cross: thus must our obedience be, we must not only do
good, but suffer evil with patience, that we may be conformable to the death
of Christ, as the Apostle speaks. Phil. 3.10.


First, let this serve to beat down the reasoning of corrupt Affliction is no
good argument to prove that the Lord loves not his children.
and stop the slanderous mouths of wicked Atheists, which commonly, upon
occasion of the affliction of the godly, are open to blaspheme God, and charge
him with want of love to his children, because he does afflict them: the
doctrine delivered makes it plain, that affliction is no good argument to
prove that the Lord loves not his children, and the Atheist cannot thereupon
gather it, that the Lord does not regard them: for why? patience is an
excellent virtue, a special part of Christian obedience, whereof there were no
use, if they were not afflicted; and thereis no use of temperance out of
occasion and means of riot and excess, so there is no use of patience out of
afflictions. And besides this use of affliction, which is sufficient to silence
backe-biting flesh, charging God with want of love to his children, it serves
further to many other good uses, as to tame unbridled affections, to conform
faith by special experience of Gods mercy, to stir up obedience, yea, it is
as great an argument as can be of Gods love, and of eternal retribution. So
the Apostle reasons, we are chastened, and why? 1. Cor. 11.32.
because we should not be condemned with the world: let us not then give place
to the reasoning of flesh and blood in this case.

Again, for the second use, is it so that our walking It is but one part of
our duty to behave our selves well in time of prosperity.
but in suffering evil with patience? then let every one learn, that it is
but one half part of our duty, to carry our selves well in time of
prosperity: be it that we walk without public offense, and happily do much
good, it is not enough, we must also learn to obey the will of the Lord, in a
patient and quiet subjection of our wills to his will in time of adversity,
that is another principal part of our obedience: it is as well required of us,
that we suffer evil with patience, as that we do good with cheerfulness and
because some, yea such as fear God, and have a special measure of grace, and
by grace are enabled to do much good in time of prosperity, yet when
affliction comes they find themselves defective in this part of obedience,
their corruption does break out and show it self in some impatient word or
behavior: let us therefore think upon this duty, and withal think upon
some thing that they may help and strengthen us in the practice of it.

Note.
And first to this purpose, consider we whence our affliction comes, even from
the good pleasure and appointment of the Lord, all men for the most part will
confess the world to be governed by the Lord, but when it comes to their own
particular case in affliction, few do acknowledge it, then some accuse the
uncertainty of the things of this life, some ascribe their affliction to their
own rashness and want of heed, others again have their eye set upon the
wickedness of enemies that afflict them, accusing and condemning them, which
is a fault besides impatiency, even to confess other men's sins, and not our
own, we must learn to look higher, to see and behold Gods hand striking, and
acknowledge his good providence in our affliction, and that will make us if any
grace be in us in patience and silence to submit our selves to the will of the
Lord, for why? he is just in afflicting us, and wise, imposing affliction upon
us, for many good ends, and merciful, he might justly destroy us.

Note.
Secondly consider that by impatiency we are cruel to our selves, we weaken our
selves and make that stronger against us, which does already torment us, we
add affliction to our selves, in other things we commonly love our selves too
much but in this we are cruel to our own bowels, and become instruments of
further torment to our selves, and that cruelty is most barbarous, and the
greatest cruelty, for any crime a man commits against himself is greater then
it can be against another, as for a man to murder himself, is a more
fearful degree of murder then to murder an other, and so if a man be cruel
to himself, it is most savage cruelty. Let us then think upon it that our
affliction comes from the hand of God, who is most just wise and merciful in
afflicting of us, and that if we suffer our selves to be impatient, we are
cruel to our own bowels which is the greatest and most savage cruelty. Let
the consideration of these things stir us up to a patient and quiet
subjection of our wills to the will and pleasure of the Lord, that so we may
walk worthy of the Lord, both in prosperity and adversity. It is further to
be marked, that the Apostle says (unto all patience and long suffering.)
Whence we are taught to be constant in patience, We are to bear with patience
great and long continued affliction. Luke 9.23. James 1.14.
but as himself has taught us, take up his cross daily, and follow him.
Constancy is the complement and perfect work of patience: this point needs no
long proof, it stands upon the same ground with the former; it is easily
proved, but not so soon learned: for happily a man may in silence submit his
will to the good will of God, in some one affliction; but when either another
is added, or that increased and continued, then it is hard to continue patient,
for then, besides the rising up and rebelling of his own flesh, the devil
will be ready to suggest, that none whom God loves was ever so dealt withal;
and if we oppose to this suggestion the example of any child of God, then he
will shift his foot, and say, but never was any child of God so grievously
afflicted as thou art.

That we may therefore be strengthened against this subtlety of Satan, We are
to labor for strength against Satan's subtlety in his persecutions.
know that no such measure of affliction does ever befall us as has been laid
on the Saints of God recorded in the Scripture, take one in stead of many, read
and mark there affliction and an exceeding measure of it compassed round
about, Note.
his reins cut, not spared, his gall powered upon the ground, broken with one
breaking upon another, and run upon like a giant, can we say we have such a
measure of affliction? no surely, if we speak the truth, we cannot: and I
further prove it: 1. Cor. 10.13.
The Apostle says, the Lord will measure our affliction according to the
ability of his children. Now our strength when it is at the greatest, is far
inferior to the strength of Job, David, or Abraham, and therefore we must
needs confess our trials and troubles are far inferior and short of theirs.
Let not then Satan ever prevail with us, to persuade us, that never any whom
God loved was afflicted as we are: let us put back his suggestion with this
reason, and so learn to bear with constant patience the greatest measure, and
the most long continued affliction, that the Lord shall lay upon us. Come we to
the last word (ioifulnesse) this (as we said) is the quality and condition of
patience and long suffering. Our instruction hence is It is not enough to be
patient in great and long continued affliction, unless it be with sweet
contentment. Reasons of the doctrine.
unless it be with sweet contentment, joy, and comfort: we must not only be
content to bear the miseries and afflictions of this life, so far the
Heathen could go upon consideration of fatal necessity, but we must go a
step further, even to rejoice in our afflictions, yea as S. James says, 1.2.
count it exceeding joy when ye fall into diverse tentations. Reasons of this are
given first by Peter, because we are in affliction conformable to Christ,
rejoice (says he) in as much as year partakers of Christ's sufferings.
Secondly, by S. Paul, when we are weakest, we are indeed strongest, having then
special favor, 2. Cor. 12.10. Use. If patience be not with joy, it is not
pleasing to the Lord, nor a fruit of grace.
protection, and strength from the Lord: therefore says the Apostle, I take
pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches in necessities, in persecution, in
anguish for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then am I strong: let this be
thought on, that patience must be wirh joy and comfort; if that be away, it is
not pleasing to the Lord: and again know that patience with joy and comfort is
a true mark of Gods child, for affliction being sanctified, and sent as a
testimony of Gods love toward his children, Heb. 12.7.
if we with patience and comfort endure it, God in it and by it does offer
himself unto us, as unto children, affliction of it own nature does press
down the heart, hands and eyes: if then faith, patience and comfort can keep
the heart, hands, and eyes upwards, it is a manifest argument that the spirit
of grace and strength does rest upon us, making faith to triumph over the
trial, and making us conquerors, yea more than conquerors. Let this be
considered, Romans 8.32.
and stir us up to a cheerful and comfortable bearing of any affliction,
though it be great, and long continued upon us. And so much of this verse.

VER. 12. Giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.
The Apostle having finished the proeme and entrance of his Epistle, standing
on a congratulation and comprecation from the third verse to this twelfth, now
he enters upon a summarie declaration of the doctrine of salvation from this
verse to the 23. A summarie declaration of the doctrine of salvation from this
12. verse. to the 23. The general proposition. The parts of it.
the general proposition laid down in these verses, is this, that salvation
comes unto us from God the Father, by his Son Jesus Christ, true God and man,
and the head of his Church, whose merit is sufficient to all perfection of
eternal life. The parts of this proposition are two: First, a declaration of
the fountain and first Author of salvation, namely God the Father, together
with the effect wrought by him, in verse. 12.13.

2 Secondly, a manifestation of the worker of it, Jesus Christ, and the work
wrought by him, namely redemption, verse 14. to which is sub-ioined in the
verses following a confirmation and proof of his sufficiency to redeem us;
and that is proved both by the dignity of his person that he was true God,
the image of the invisible God, the first borne of every creature, and by the
eternal decree and good pleasure of his father, together with the application
both in general, and in special to the Colossians. The words of the 12. and
13. verses, being the first part of the general proposition, contain in them
two things; first, the effect wrought by God the Father, verse 12. Secondly,
the manner how it was wrought, verse 13. In the twelfth verse we find more
specially a thanksgiving to God (giving thank,) and the reason and ground of
that in those words (which has made, etc.) and the place of that inheritance
in the last words (in light.) First, briefly examine we the words of the 12.
Interpretation.
verse, the word (Father) is here to be taken personally, for the first person
in the Trinity, because one person is conferd with another, and it stands in
relation to Christ (meet) that is, fit, sufficient, so the word is rendered, and
it is so there translated by the Papists themselves, yet here they translate
it (worthy) laboring thereby to uphold their opinion of inherent worthiness
and condignitie deserving salvation, which indeed cannot stand either with the
proper signification of the word, or with the context, and with that in the
verse following, where it is showed how we are made fit, namely by effectual
vocation, justification, and a measure of sanctification. (To be partakers) or
to be a part (inheritance of the Saints) that is to say, life and glory, given
as it were by lot (for the Apostle alludeth to the division of the land of
Canaan) to them that are sanctified by faith (in light) that is to say, in the
glorious kingdom of heaven, for so we find the word (light) taken, Act 26.23.
show light or preach light, that is to say, life eternal. Now come we to such
things as may be observed from this verse.

think or speak of the grace of God in the work of our redemption, then our
hearts must be enlarged, When we either think or speak of Gods grace in the
work of our redemption, we are to magnify the name of the Lord. 1 Peter 2.9.
and our mouths opened to magnify the name of the Lord, for that is the end
of all the mercies of God bestowed upon us. It is the end of all the actions of
God tending to salvation: yea of the chiefest of them, our glorification in
heaven. The point of thanksgiving was handled before in the third verse; and
therefore in a word know we, that as many as have any comfortable feeling of
Gods grace in the work of redemption, Such as comfortably feel Gods grace in
the work of redemption are so affected
they never think or speak of it but with thanksgiving, and it is a sure note
and mark that we find true comfort in the doctrine of grace, if when we
think or speak of it, our hearts be filled with joy, and our mouths opened to
praise the Lord; for this being an exercise of the blessed Angels and Saints
of God in heaven, who do continually sing, thou art worthy to take the book,
and to open the seals thereof, because thou wast killed, and have redeemed us
to God by thy blood out of every, etc. Revel. 5.9.
It cannot choose but in some measure be begun in this life, and be found in
them who shall hereafter be glorified in heaven.

I come to the matter of the Apostles thanksgiving God the father does truly
and really impute the righteousness of Christ to them whom he does justify by
his grace in Christ.
the justification of a sinner, we may conclude that whom it pleases the
Father to justify by his grace in Christ, to him he does truly and really
impute the righteousness of Christ, and by his righteousness make him truly
and really meet and fit to be partaker of glory in heaven, it is not an
imaginary or a supposed imputation of Christ his righteousness, by which we
stand just and righteous in the sight of God; the Papists do scornfully term
it imputative justice and tell us that we are to tremble at that which follows
upon it, Confutation of the Papists.
so must we look for no heaven, but by imputation, we are from hence to take
notice of it, that it is not (as they falsely cavil) a supposed, but a real
imputation of righteousness, whereby we stand most in Gods sight, we are not
in conceit made meet for the kingdom of Heaven, but truly and really, and to
this agrees that of the Apostle, that we are made the righteousness of God in
Christ, 2. Cor. 5.21.
that as our sin was truly and really, not in conceit; but indeed truly
imputed unto him, and he made sin for us: so are we made the righteousness
of God in him. It is but a fond cauil to shift off the plain evidence of that
place in that they say Christ was made sin, that is to say a sacrifice for
sin, thereby thinking to elude the people of God and to persuade that we
misconster the place, for we confess it, that he was a sacrifice for sin, but
he was therefore a sacrifice for sin, because our sin was imputed unto him and
punished in him, and therefore it is said that he was made a curse for us, Gal,
3.13.
because the curse we had deserved was imputed unto him that the blessing of
Abraham might come upon us, through Christ Jesus, that we might receive the
promise of the spirit through faith. Let us not then be driven from this
truth, by any cavil or scorn of the Papists, but learn to hold it as a
certain truth, that it is a true real imputation of righteousness, by which
we stand just in Gods sight, and this is further clear by our real union with
Christ by the bond of his spirit; for by the spirit and faith we are really
members of Christ his mystical body and so his righteousness and merits are
truly and really communicated unto us, and we have interest in them Such as
come to be partakers of Christ's glory in Heaven are made fit for it in this
life.
but such as are before made meet and fit for it, not only by a real
imputation of righteousness, but by a measure of inherent holiness and
sanctification, and to prove this further, we are to know, that howsoever it
be true, that no goodness or holiness in us is proportionable in merit and
desert to the least degree of glory that shall be revealed because our best
holiness is imperfect, and life and glory is not given for the worthiness of it,
yet this is as true again, that life and glory shall be given in mercy
according to the measure of holiness, and where there is a greater measure of
holiness, there shall be a greater degree of glory, and consequently where there
is no holiness, no glory, nor the least degree of glory can be looked for;
Romans 2.6.
The Apostle having delivered it in the general, that the Lord will reward
every man according to his works, he presently subioynes a particular
explication that unto all them that continue in well doing, the Lord will give
glory, honor, and immortality, and eternal life, but on the contrary, such as
are contentious and disobey the truth, and obey unrighteousness, they can look
for no such reward from the Lord, upon them shall be indignation and wrath,
tribulation and anguish, and upon the soul of every one that does evil. We
may observe that though the kingdom of heaven be prepared for them that are
blessed of God the Father, verse 34. Math. 25.
yet they are not sent into the possession of it. By the sentence of our Savior
before he makes it known, both to themselves and to all the world that they
are fitted for it in measure of sanctification, and that they testified the
same by their works of mercy toward his members, that they fed the hungry,
clothed the naked, visited the sick, etc. whence it is most clear, that none
ever come to be partakers of life and glory in heaven, but such as are before
made fit for it by a measure of holiness.

By this doctrine you shut out infants dying in infancy from the participation
of life and glory in heaven,

The doctrine must not be extended to them, work of Gods spirit, not known to
us, and so not any actual sanctification is required of them.

Ungodly and profane persons in vain look to come to heaven continuing in
their sins. Heb. 12.14. Isay. 3 9.
no comfortable sight of God hoped for, then let no ungodly profane man or
woman, such as declare their sins as Sodom, sooth and flatter themselves, and
think they shall get to heaven well enough for all their abominable
silthinesse, (if they so think) they are much deceived, and let them hear it
from the mouth of the Lord as a terrible sentence to all unrepentant sinners,
that no unclean thing, neither whatsoever works abomination or lies, shall
enter therein, but they which are written in the lambs book of life. It is
therefore the exhortation of the Apostle, Reu. 21.27.
let no man deceive you with vain words, and I may say, let no man deceive
himself with such vain words or persuasions: this ye know (says the Apostle,
Ephe. 5 6.
verse. 5. that no whoremonger, neither unclean person, nor covetous person,
which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God, but because many please themselves in their filthiness and sins, in
hope hereafter to find mercy, though they have heard that late repentance is
seldom true repentance, and they may happily feeke it and not find it. I would
entreat him that we may a little further reason together upon the doctrine now
delivered, they have heard it proved that none can come to be partakers of
life and glory in heaven; but such as are before made fit and meet for it, and
can they think that they are fit for heaven who without remorse of conscience
do again crucify Christ, and make his wounds to bleed a fresh; thus do all
hard hearted and unrepentant sinners by their sins, if therefore they rightly
consider it they most of force confess, that they foolishly persuade
themselves they shall get to heaven. Oh, but Gods mercy is great? it is true,
he is a God of infinite mercy, but yet a just God, and it is strange that
wicked profane wretches should dare to presume of Gods mercy under many
sins, and yet they may find, that God has showed his justice to the dearest
of his children: to Moses, to Aaron, to David, and others, for committing some
one sin; yea, which is more, Christ himself, the glory and image of his
Father, could not escape the bitter death of the cross, because he became sin
for us. How then can bold and presumptuous sinners persuade themselves they
shall escape the punishing hand of God, they adding sin to sin, and wallowing
in their sins till death, without repentance? Let them duly consider this,
and for conclusion of this point, let us know, that there is no comfort to be
had in our hearts, touching life and glory in the world to come, but only by a
true espiall of sanctification of life in our selves: and let it move us to
labor by all appointed good means to come to a measure of sanctification,
that so we may glorify our heavenly Father in this life, and may seal up
assurance of our happy estate in his glorious kingdom in heaven (to be
partakers) or to a part.

Hence a question is occasioned. Some may say,

No, the very word used by the Apostle is against it,

The Prophet does infer upon the general resurrection, Dan 12.3.
that they that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and
they that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the stars for ever and
ever. And the Apostle plainly teaches this point, 1. Cor. 15.41.
there is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another
glory of the Stars: for one Star differs from another Star in glory.
And howsoever that in the parable, that all the laborers in the vineyard
received every one a penie, Mat. 20.12.
may seem contrary to this; yet we must understand it, as lying under this
distinction that in respect of essential glory, all the elect shall have the
same; but in regard of accidental glory, and the degrees of glory, therein
they shall not be equal. Use of the answ^r to the question.
And let not this be a point of speculation, only serving to make us able to
talk of it: if we rest in that, the very Devil shall reap as much profit by
it as we. But let us labor to make it comfortable to our selves, let it be
laid as a ground in our hearts of comfort, and of godly emulation, even to make
us strive to excel one another in holiness, that so we may find strong
consolation and comfort of conscience in this life, and increase of our glory
in the life to come (inheritance) in that the Apostle calls life and glory in
heaven, an inheritance, it is most Life and glory in heaven is given to Gods
elect freely.
whom it pleases the Father to make mere for it, not upon any desert of
theirs, but freely: for why? we know that an inheritance is given to the
child, of the mere love of the father; it may be, it was provided for him
before he was borne, and before he could do any thing for the deserving of
it. And thus our Savior speaks of the heavenly inheritance, Mat. 25.34.
Inherit you the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world.
It is a thing commonly known, that amongst men, an inheritance is not given to
the servant, who peradventure has done something either in the getting or
keeping of it, but it is given to the child, who happily is so far from
doing any thing, either to the getting or keeping of it, as yet he lies crying
in the cradle; so that by this word (inheritance) the Holy Ghost would have us
to understand, that life and glory in heaven is freely given, and not upon
desert. Again, if the word be taken in the other signification, it does
demonstrate and prove the same thing, that life and glory is freely given: for
shall we say that a man does purchase by merit, that which comes unto him by
lot? That were not only to go against the common received opinion, that lot
stands on mere chance, but to give the lie to the plain text, The lot is cast
into the lap, Prou. 16.33.
but the whole disposition thereof is of the Lord: so life and glory being
called a lot, it does plainly euince, that it is at the free disposition of the
Lord, and given of his free grace. And the reason is given by the Apostle: by
grace are we saved, Ephesians. 2.9.
lest any man should boast himself, lest any should glory, that he brings any
thing to the procurement of his own salvation, therefore it is, that we
obtain life and salvation freely. And with this agrees that, where the Apostle
having proved that we are justified freely, he says, Romans 3.27.
where is then the reioicing?

First, this serves to confute and overthrow that opinion Confutation of the
Papists.
who hold and teach that life eternal is given to them that are first
justified by Christ, upon their desert for the merit of their own good works,
and wages due to them by debt. Beside the error of this opinion, supposing a
twofold justification in the sight of God, which can never be proved by the
word, it cannot stand with the truth now delivered: for if eternal life be
freely given of grace, then not upon desert for dignity of good works. Free
gift and due debt cannot stand together. Oh but (say they) life eternal is
called a reward: it is true, Romans 4.4. Note.
life eternal is a reward of favor, not of debt: it is given of the mere grace
of God, without any desert of ours. We are to observe it, it is worthy
observation, that wheresoever in any place of Scripture mention is made of
reward, we shall find that it is promised to the worker, and not to the work
it self, as shall reward thee openly, Mat. 6.
whereby the holy Ghost would have us to understand, that though reward be
given in respect of the work, yet it is not given for the worth and dignity
of it, but it is given for Gods gracious acceptance of the person, and
consequently of his work in Jesus Christ; its given of favor, not of debt, as
deserved by the good work done by any believer. But the Papists further
reply, that Christ has merited, that the works of his members should be
meritorious of life everlasting: a mere device of their own. This proposition
is no where to be found in the Scripture We find in many places, that Christ
died for our sins, but no where for our good works, to make them able to
merit, and to purchase favor at Gods hands; and indeed it is not possible that
our best works being imperfect and stained with sin, should have the true and
whole nature of merit. It is a manifest contradiction, that any work should
have need of pardon from God (as all ours have) and yet fully satisfy the
justice of God, and deserve at his hands. Yea more than that, if Christ his
obedience had been imperfect, and any way defective, though he were God and
man, yet it had not been meritorious of life and salvation; for that were to
make contradictories true together, which all Divines, yea Schoole-diuines
(from whom the Papists fetch the body of their divinity) hold impossible to
God himself, because it is an argument of impotencie, not of power.

We are to express our thankfulness to God for his free gift of life eternal.
surely then, though we cannot deserve the least degree of it, yet it is the
pleasure of God our Father, that we should labor to express our
thankfulness by all holy obedience unto him; for it holds by proportion, that
if we are to be thankful to God for the bread we have to put into our mouths,
and for other temporal blessings, as it is our duty, because they are the
free gifts of God, and the use and comfort we find by them, comes from the
Lord, then much more are we bound to be thankful unto him, for making us his
own children, we that are not sons by nature, making us his Children by
adoption, yea, sons and heirs, even ioynt-heires with Christ his natural
Son, and by him, giving us sufficient and certain title, to an euelasting
inheritance in his own Kingdom. This is to be thought on, Romans 8.17.
and because every one will be ready to speak peace to his own heart in this
case, and persuade himself, that he is thankful to God for his grace and
adoption, let us learn to examine our selves whether we be so or no.

How is that to be done?

Even by our thankfulness to God for his gifts of a lower nature, for things
of less weight, David, 2. Sam. 7.18.
upon the consideration of Gods favor in outward things, to say, who am I, O
Lord God and what is mine house, that thou have brought me hitherto? and the
same spirit will be powerful in us, upon consideration of our title by grace,
to the inheritance of the Saints in Heaven, to say, Lord who am I that thou
should think of me, choose me, and make me thy child and heir of Heaven,
on the contrary, if we be not thankful to God, for the good things of this
life, but after the manner of the wicked, the more the Lord does increase and
multiply his gifts, the more we increase in pride and vanity, in scorn,
contempt and disdain of Such as look for life and glory in Heaven, must be
of the number of Saints.
we shall never be able to prove it, and to make it good, to the comfort of
our own souls, that we are thankful to God, for our title to his free gift
of life and glory in Heaven.

(Saints) This word points out the same thing, that was before delivered,
that such as look to come to be partakers of life and glory in Heaven, must in
some measure be sanctified, they must be of the number of Saints.

For further use Reproof of those, who will fully neglect the use of the Word
and Sacraments.
and participation of the Sacraments at times appointed, think upon this one
point, shall none come to be partakers of life and glory in heaven, who are not
of the number of Saints. How then can they look for it, who wittingly and
wilfully break off holy Communion and fellowship with the Saints, and do
openly divide and separate themselves, from the Society of them that shall be
glorified in heaven? know it for truth, thou must either hold Communion with
thy brethren in this life, in good things or else never look to have Communion
with them, in the life to come. If thou do excommunicate thy self (so I may
justly speak) and by a wicked and waiward separation divide thy self from the
society of the Saints upon earth, certainly without repentance, thou shall for
ever be excommunicate, and shut out of heaven.

(In light) That is to say (as ye heard) in heaven, now heaven is set out under
the name of light, Heaven is set out under the name of light to shadow out the
comfort there to be found.
to shadow out the excellent comfort that is there to be found, for we know
how comfortable a thing light is. As hell is resembled to utter darkness, to
teach us the horror of it; the use of this, as of other resemblances, setting
out the joy, comfort and glory of heaven, is to work in us Saint Paul's
affection, We are therefore to have a longing desire of Heaven, and to use all
good means to attain it. Psalm. 4.6.
and to this end, let us a little meditate upon this one similitude, as many as
are the children of God, do know, that there is no such comfort to be found in
any thing under heaven, as in the light of the Lords countenance shining upon
them, David preferred it before wheat and wine. Now in heaven, that light of
the Lords countenance, shall be the light that shall shine upon us in full
brightness, Reu. 21.23.
the glory of God does light the heavenly Jerusalem, how then ought this to
affect us, and to stir us up in a longing desire after it, even earnestly to
strive to come to walk in that unspeakable brightness of the glory of God,
the glory and light of the lamb Jesus Christ a light that never shall be
obscured with any darkness.

VER. 13. Who has delivered us from the power of darkness,
The Apostle shows in this verse, how God makes his Elect meet to be
partakers of life and glory in heaven, namely, by delivering them from the
power of darkness and translating them into the Kingdom of his dear Son,
under which terms, of delivering and of translating, are signified their
effectual vocation, justification and sanctification, through the effectual
working of his spirit, by the word of the Gospel, for these are the degrees of
Gods love manifested in time to his chosen, and in these very terms does the
holy Ghost, speak of the vocation of the Gentiles where Saint Paul says, he
was sent as an instrument, Romans 8.30. Acts. 26.18.
by the preaching of the Gospel to convert and call the Gentiles, and
propounds the end of his sending in these very words ( to open their eyes etc.
Interpretation.
) Come we to speak of the first of these (who has delivered us from the power
of darkness) the word translated (delivered) does signify such a deliverance,
as in respect of them that are delivered, is neither deserved by them, nor
desired of them, but is, as it were, a drawing and an haling, as is the pulling
of a beast, or rather a dead weight out of a pit, and in respect of the
deliverer, it signifies such a deliverance, as is wrought by his almighty
power, by the power of his spirit. And by the power of darkness, we are to
understand the rule and dominion of Satan, who is the Prince of darkness, and
does rule in the children of disobedience, by sin, by ignorance in the mind,
rebellion in the will, prauity and hardness of the heart ande. Whence it is
that actual sins, are called by the Apostle, the works of darkness. The
meaning then of the first part of this verse is this, who by the mighty and
powerful work of his spirit has drawn us, we neither desiring nor willing
it of our selves, out of the rule of Satan the Prince of darkness, who rules
by sin, in the children of disobedience. We are to mark in the first place
the order of this verse, in that the Apostle says, first we are delivered and
then translated,

Before we can be set into the state of grace, we must be delivered from the
state of corruption. Ephesians 4.22. 2. Cor. 7.1.
we must be delivered from the state of corruption and sin, a point easily
proved; every exhortation of the Apostle, tending to reformation and newness
of life, by way of implication does confirm it, as that we are to cast off
the old man, which is corruption, through the deceivable lusts etc. that we
are to be cleansed from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and to finish
our sanctification in the fear of God, these and many other of like sort, do
not only teach, that a change must be wrought, but imply the order of it,
that first we must be drawn out of the state of corruption and sin,

Examination and trial of our selves.
every one will persuade himself that he is in the state of grace, but would
we know whether we be so or no, then look to the first step and entrance
into that that state, examine whether thou have suffered an holy and heavenly
violence, whether the strong hand of grace has wrought upon thee, and drawn
thee out of thy corruption, if thou find it so, then doubtless thou art in the
state of Grace, but if otherwise thou never seltst any such powerful work in
thee, but if thou still live the life of nature, thou can not with comfort
persuade thy self that thou art in the state of grace, and for more special
trial in this case look to the working of Gods spirit in respect of the best
pleasing sin, even of that sin to which thou art most naturally inclined, if
thou find that God by the powerful work of his spirit has drawn thee from
under the power and tyranny of that sin, and that thou have not now such
pleasure in it as in former times, but do strive by good means against it,
and avoid occasions leading unto it, then thou may be sure, thou art entered
into the way of life, but if thou find, that yet thou art held in the snare of
the devil as the Apostle speaks, 2. Tim. 2.26.
in thraldom under that sin, that so soon as any occasion is offered thou
art ready to practice it, and that with pleasure, then hear and think on it,
with trembling that even Cain, Judas or Herod were as near heaven as thou art
yet.

Delivered.) The point hence to be observed is this, that Deliverance of men
from under natural bondage is a most hard thing.
it is such a thing as we are taught by this word, as does require the force
and strength of that hand that is omnipotent, and able to ouermaster hell, yea
such a thing as is wrought on him that is delivered merely passive, nay
repugnant and striving against it being dead in sin: Ephe. 2.1.
it is not in this case as in producing the forms of many natural things
which are bought e potentia materiae out of a capable pronenesse of the matter
to conceive such a form, but that God which at first was able to bring light
out of darkness, 2. Cor. 4.6.
the same God by the power of his spirit does deliver the mind from dullness
and ignorance, the will from rebellion, the affections from disorder, and all
the powers of the soul from corruption, let no man then please himself with a
conceit that he can at No man ought to think that he can at his own time and
pleasu^e be delivered from the bondage of sin and Satan.
that is to suffer our thoughts to rise up in contradiction to the holy ghost,
and in our hearts to gainesay the truth breathed out of the mouth of God
himself, in this and many other places, let no man then please himself, in
such a conceit so contrary to the plain truth plainly taught by our Savior, and
so neglect the timely using of the means, as hearing and reading the word of
God, and other means by which God does work the calling and and conversion of
his elect, and their deliverance from the bondage of sin and Satan. We are
further to mark that the Apostle says, not from sin and When men by the
work of grace are d^awne out of the state of corruption they are delivered not
altogether f om sin, but from the power of sin. Reason. Romans 6.12.
our instruction hence is this, that when it pleases God by the powerful
work of his grace to draw men out of the state of corruption, he does not
deliver them altogether from sin, but from the power of sin, so after their
deliverance, sin does not rule and reign over them, and in them according to
the exhortation of the Apostle. Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies,
the reason of it is this, the Lord will have us here so long as we live in
this world to be in continual exercise of faith and repentance, and spiritual
grace and strength, therefore he does not deliver those whom it pleases him to
call and convert altogether from sin, but from the power of sin, that sin
does not rule and reign in them, and this may serve as a special note and
mark that can not deceive us, whereby we may know when we are delivered from
our natural state and condition, For trial of ourselves touching our
deliverance from our natural state.
that though we sometimes fall into sin, yet we are not in bondage unto it,
and this may also serve to teach us when we are delivered from some particular
sin whereof we are most guilty, even then when we find the power of it
broken.

But happily some will demand how we shall know that we are delivered from the
power of some particular sin,

Then we are delivered from the power of some particular sin when we being
able to commit it, Paul says of himself, Romans 7.15.
the evil he hated he did, and after the fall we recover our selves by
speedy repentance, for where the seed of Grace has taken root, these three
things are to be found; a purpose not to sin; and if we be overtaken with
sin, 3. Things.

Again when we Lots wife, who though her body was delivered out of Sodom,
yet her heart was still there, and therefore she cast a long look back to
that filthy sink of sin, and they are to remember Lots wife, it is the
exhortation of our Savior, that as she was smitten by the hand of God, and
turned into a pillar of salt, so they first or last without repentance shall be
smitten and made spectacles of the Lords wrath. Interpretation.


Now to the second general thing, in this verse in these words (and has
translated) the word (translated) is here taken from the Latin, and
signifies through the effectual working of the spirit of God, working by the
word of the Gospel, carried and set over; (Kingdom of his Son) that is to
say, into the Kingdom of Christ his natural son, his son by eternal
generation in respect of his deity, and in respect of his humanity by personal
union, and by the word (Kingdom) we are to understand the regiment and
government of Christ, as mediator in his Church, and because Christ his
regiment is twofold, of grace and glory, we must know that here is meant his
kingdom of grace, whereby he does order and rule his Church and the members of
it in this life, which in respect of the manner of government shall have an
end at the second coming of Christ to judgment. 1. Cor, 15.24.
For though Christ his kingdom it self be eternal, because he is God, equal
to the father, and the head of his Church, yet the manner of the administration
of his kingdom, Note.
by preaching Sacraments and discipline shall have an end he shall then cease
to do the office of a mediator (but that by the way, (his dear son) that
is to say, the son of his love, so the words are in the original his son,
Mat. 3.17.
in whom as we have it, he is well pleased, thus then these words are to be
conceived, and through the powerful work of his spirit, working by his word,
has brought and set us under the regiment and government God does not only
deliver his elect from the power of sin, but sets them also into the state of
grace.
does govern his Church in this life, Now the first thing we have here to
mark is from the connection of the parts of this verse. The Apostle says, he
has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the
kingdom of his dear son, hence we may take up this instruction that God
does not only deliver his elect from the power of sin, but does also set
them into the state of grace, Romans 8.30.
and he does not only draw them out of the state of their corruption, but he
brings them under grace and works, grace in them, for as the Apostle says,
whom he has appointed to life and salvation, them he calls; now effectual
calling (which must needs be there understood) being applied to Gods elect, is
when grace is not only offered by the ministry of the word, but given
through the effectual working of Gods Spirit in the heart, he changing the
heart, and giving it power to receive the word, and to mix it with faith, and
to bring forth fruits of new obedience, for that is effectual calling, and
that does plainly prove that God does not only deliver his elect from the
power of sin, but he brings them under grace, and works grace in them. We
need seek no further for the proof of this, than the word here used
(translated) for translation is a setting of us out of one state into another.

The reason of this is because God will have the mind,

Let the consideration of this point for the use How to know when we are
effectually called.
and truly converted, namely then, when by the powerful work of Gods Spirit,
our minds, wills, and affections, are not only freed from corruption, but grace
is wrought in them: and to descend a little lower in the application of this
point, then we are effectually called out of some sin, and truly turned from
some sin, when we are not only kept from that sin, but with love, liking,
alacrity and cheerfulness, we practice the contrary duty, that is a rule
that cannot deceive us; many please themselves, and think they are in good
case, called home and reclaimed from some sin, when they avoid that sin:
but we must know that is not sufficient; 2. Pet. 2.20.
the Apostle does tell us that some may escape from the filthiness of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and of the Savior Jesus Christ, and
yet be tangled again therein and overcome, and the latter end be worse with
them than the beginning. As many as will be sure they are effectually called
home, so as they cannot go back again to their old course, must not only
find themselves delivered from their sin, but must also find the contrary
grace wrought in them, yea in some cases the contrary special grace: as for
example, such as will be sure they are called out of their natural blindness
and ignorance of God, of themselves, of the way to life and salvation, must not
only find their minds enlightened by a general illumination, a bare
conceiving and understanding of the sense and meaning of the word; that is a
common grace, and that may be common to them with the Devil, and the wicked,
but they must find in them a special experimental knowledge, a particular
acknowledgement and persuasion of the truth of the whole word of God, a
believing holy knowledge, which is never disioined from good affection, and
then they may be sure they are effectually called out of their ignorance. Thus
it is in other particulars. Let no man then imagine that he is effectually
called home, when for a time he has escaped the practice of some sin, unless
he can withal show the practice of the contrary virtue. And to this purpose
consider we but this one thing, that it is not possible for a man long to
continue in that barren and (as I may call it) graceles estate in which he does
please himself, if the sin be avoided, and the contrary virtue not
practiced, it cannot be but that he will return with the dog to his vomit:
for mark what our Savior has left upon perpetual record: Mat. 12.44.
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, if he return (as he will seek
to return) and find the house empty, or as the word i^, idle, not possessed
by grace, certainly he will enter and hold possession with greater strength
than before, and the latter end of that man will be worse than his beginning.

In the next place we are to mark, the Apostle says, translated into the
Kingdom, Gods elect being delivered from sin, and set into the state of grace,
are still under government.
that word (Kingdom) being a word of relation, having reference to subjects,
it teaches that Gods elect delivered from sin, and set into the state of
grace, are still under government, they are not at liberty to live as they
list: for why? the Kingdom of grace, as the Apostle reasons, gives no
license to sin, that they that are under grace, should therefore sin; we are
not under the Law, but under grace. What then? does it follow that we should
sin? God forbid, says the Apostle: Romans 6.15.
he speaks it with a detestation of that conclusion, as if he should have
said, fie upon it, far be it from us. The Scripture is pregnant in the proof
of this: but for more special information in this point, we must know what be
the laws, under which Gods elect live in this kingdom of grace: and they are
two; first, the word of God, Mark. 1.14. Romans 3.27. 1. Cor. 4.20.
the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles. Hence is the Gospel called the
Gospel of the Kingdom; the Law of faith. The second Law is the power and
operation of the Spirit of God in the hearts of his children; the Apostle
says, the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power; says the Lord, I will
put my Law into their inward parts, Ier. 31.33.
and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my
people. These being the Laws of the kingdom of Christ in this life, all Gods
elect set into the state of grace, are to be subject unto them, and to find
them powerful to work in them obedience. They do not only teach us under
what manner of government we live, but do plainly prove that we are not at
liberty to live as we lift, but still under government; for to that end is a
law given, especially the law binding the conscience, as these do, that it
should be obeyed, and to retain men within the compass of duty. Hence the
laws of men are truly called the sinews and holds of the commonwealth.
Object. Gal. 5.1.
But some may say, the Apostle has taught us, that we are set at liberty by
Christ, stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

If we be not ruled by the word and spirit of Christ, we are not delivered
from the power of sin.
nor in the state of grace. And a little further to press this, can we
persuade our selves we are in the state of grace, and vndergrace, and yet abuse
grace, make it an occasion to all licentious liberty to sin, make it as a bawd
to our lying, swearing, drunkenness, etc. If we do but weigh this in the
balance of natural reason, it will be found too light to this purpose; for
as we use to say, when a man does sell a thing of great worth for a small
price, and after that gives himself to rioting and mispending of that money, he
is a thief, and no right owner of that he sold, the like may be justly said
of such as abuse grace, that they are but usurpers, and no right owners of it,
and that they have no true lawful title unto it. Let this be thought on, and
withal remember what we daily call for, or ought to call for, at the hands of
God, namely this, that this kingdom may be set up and established in the
Church, and in our own hearts. And if we do not withal labor to submit our
selves to the scepter of his kingdom, the rule of his word and spirit, but
wilfully reject his yoke, we pray against our selves, we desire the Lord to
take us away, to confound and destroy us by his judgments, that his kingdom
may increase, and of our own mouths will the Lord judge us, and in his just
conceived anger accomplish that we ask. Therefore with trembling hearts let us
consider, and in time submit our selves to the kingdom of Christ. Before I
leave this word (Kingdom) I will briefly answer a cavil of the Anabaptists,
who upon this, and the like places of Scripture, take occasion to mainetaine a
confused Anarchy, and to reason against civil government amongst Christians,
after this manner, Gods elect (say they) effectually called and set in the
state and kingdom of grace, are governed by Christ the King, A cavil of the
Anabaptists answered
and by the Laws of his kingdom, his Word and Spirit. Therefore they need not
outward government of man, outward government by a magistrate is needelesse;
this is a mere cavil, having no soundness in it: it is easily answered, for
if we should but press them with the perpetuity of the fifth commandment,
that requiring subjects to yield obedience to the governors, and that being
eternal, they are not able to reply: but in a word to answer them; In the
visible Church are not only true believers, but hypocrites, as we are taught
in many parables in the Gospel, who are not governed by Gods spirit, but by
their own corrupt lusts, therefore in respect of them, civil government is
needful; yea, the best Churches in the world need civil government, for the
punishment of evil doers, and to say there needs no civil government, it
inclines to that old rotten condemned heresy, that God was not the author of
the old Testament, because there we find so many punishments mentioned and
executed. Again, true believers ought to be a Law and a Magistrate to
themselves, and so to live as not to need the civil maiestrate, but yet they
do not, neither can do being but in part governed by the Spirit for the time
of this life, therefore also in respect of them, for the ordering of the
outward man, civil government is necessary; and to this we may add, that it
is necessary for the protection of the Church, it being open to the malice of
Satan and the wicked. 1. Tim. 2.2.
Hence the Apostle bids us pray for kings, and all that be in authority, that
we may lead a quiet and peaceable life under them, in all godliness and
honesty. It follows, the next thing to be marked is, that the Apostle says,
God does ttanslate his Elect into the kingdom of his Son, he says not unto
his own Kingdom, though the kingdom of the Son (if we respect the Kingdom
it self) is the Kingdom of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, it is a power
of the whole Trinity, for the power to make laws binding conscience to be
obeyed upon pain of life and death, is a power of the whole Trinity; but the
administration of it, is given unto the Son, as himself witnesses, all
power is given unto me in Heaven and in earth, Mat. 28.18.
therefore he gives commission to his Apostles immediately from himself to go
teach and administer the Sacraments, but the reason why the Apostle says,
translated into the Kingdom of his Son, and not unto his own kingdom, is
because God the Father does admit no man to himself immediately but by the
Son God and man, the true and only Mediator between God and man, as our
Savior says; No man comes unto the Father, Ioh. 14.6
but by me.

No man is under Gods special government, but he that is in the Kingdom of
his Son. Psalm. 29.10
no man is governed by the special grace of God, but he that is in the
Kingdom of his Son, even a member of the Church, and ordered and ruled by
him. It is certain the universal government and providence of God is over all
creatures, in him they live, move, and have their being, even all in heaven
and in earth, yea the damned in hell, thus the Lord remains a King for ever,
but none are governed by his special grace, that is to say, his grace whereby
he does restrain and mortify corruption, and daily renew his decayed image
in the mind, will and affections, but only such as are in Christ, such as are
effectually caled and justified by Christ. We have proof of this, where the
Apostle says, when the Ephesians were without Christ, Ephesians 2.12.
they were without God, his meaning is not only without the true knowledge and
worship of God, and such as did neglect both; but such as were neglected, and
not regarded of God, in respect of his special government, and suffered to
walk in their own ways and sins, and to follow the lusts of their own
hearts, for we may easily conceive, that the words may extend to that meaning,
if we compare them with that we read, verse. 19. of that chapter, that in
Christ they were made citizens with the Saints, and of the household of God,
which words imply special care and government, as a wise and good householder
has a special care over them of his family; so the Lord being wisdom and
goodness it self, without question has a special care, and does carry a
special hand over them that be of his family; will we have some strength of
reason to confirm this, then know and consider we, that Gods special grace is
most free, and not given upon any desert of ours, 2. Cor. 1.20.
renouation etc. are made and fulfilled in Christ alone, he is the foundation
and complement of them all, Such as desire special grace to mortify sin,
and to renew Gods image in them, must labor to become members of Christ.
Hence it follows strongly, that none are ever governed by the special grace
of God, but such as be in Christ, because the promise is made and fulfilled in
him and by him.

The point thus cleared, let us further think on it, to this special purpose,
is it so, that none are governed by the special grace of God, but such as are
in Christ, then every one that desires special grace for the mortification of
sin, and for renewing the image of God in him, must labor to be made a member
of Christ, let him not suffer his eyes to sleep, nor the temples of his head
to take any rest, till he be assured, that he is set into the body of Christ,
and made one with him by the bond of his spirit, and by a true faith, and to
this purpose know it, that as long as we are out of Christ, we cannot pray
unto God with assurance of his special grace, for faith and assurance to be
heard, has ever respect to the promise, and there is no promise, no, not of
any temporary good thing to them, that are out of Christ, they that be out of
Christ, they cannot truly believe, they may boldly presume, they cannot truly
believe that they shall receive any temporary good thing from the Lord, if they
do, it is but as if a man should think to hold the wind in his fist; true
faith ever has relation to the promise, and out of Christ there is no promise,
they that be out of Christ, come to an absolute God, hence it is, that many
pray to God to give them grace to refrain some sin being convinced of it, in
their own conscience and told of it, they promise amendment, yea, they pray to
God to give them grace to refrain from it, and yet fail to obtain, because
they are out of Christ, whereas if they were in Christ, effectually called and
justified, they should receive Saint Paul's answer, and find it made good unto
them, though they were not freed from temptation to that sin, yet they should
find Gods grace sufficient for them, and this ought to stir us up to labor
by all good means, to be joined with Christ, by the bond of his Spirit, and
by a true and lively faith, and then we may be sure, if we pray for Gods
special grace, we shall have it given unto us; for can or will God suffer us,
to whom he has vouchsafed the blood of his own Son, to run headlong into
sin? certainly no, he will not we may find that God has vouchsafed his
common restraining grace to some Heathen men, as to Abimelech. God says he
kept him that he should not sin against him, therefore he will not cast away
the humble petition of his chosen being now actual members of Christ; no
doubtless, they craving grace, he will give them his special grace, not only
restraining, but mortifying their corruption, and renewing them in holiness
after his own image, let this then be a special inducement to move us, to
labor to be made members of Christ, and let us gather yet further argument to
move us to be made one with Christ out of this very text: the Apostle says,
Gods elect effectually called, are translated into the kingdom of his dear
son, that is, the son of his love, in whom he is well pleased: even well
pleased, not only with him, but in him with all his members, and that this may
be matter to move us, consider how happy and blessed a thing it is to be made
dear unto God, it is the very depth and ground of all true comfort, for then
we have peace with God, with our own conscience, with all the faithful, yea
with all the creatures in the world, the very beasts and stones of the field
are then in league with us, we then have access to the throne of grace with
boldness, Phil. 3.8.
we are assured of Gods special presence and protection, we may come into Gods
house with joy and gladness, we have title to all the blessings of Gods Saints
in this life, and right to eternal happiness in the life to come. Seeing then
such is the excellency of our being made near and dear to God by Christ.
This ought to possess our hearts with S. Paul's affection, to think all things
loss that we may win Christ, and be found in him, and by him be made near
and dear to his Father, Job 5.23.
and so pertakers of all the comforts and blessings of Gods Saints in this
life, and in the life to come.

VER. 14. In whom we have redemption through his blood that is, the
forgiveness of sins.
In this verse is contained a manifestation of the worker of salvation (Jesus
Christ) and the work wrought by him (Redemption.) More particularly we may
observe in this verse three things.

Three things in this verse to be observed.
First, in whom Gods elect have redemption, namely in Jesus Christ, in those
words (in whom.)

Secondly, the means of their own redemption (his blood.)

Thirdly, of what manner of redemption the Apostle speaks: even of redemption
from their sins, in the last words, where the Apostle says by way of
exposition, that is, (the forgiveness of sin.) Let us a little examine the
words: (In whom) that is in Christ the son of God, for these words have
reference to the last words of the verse, Interpretation.
foregoing, his dear son, (redemption) to redeem in a large and general
acception, signifies to set free some captive, or some that are oppressed, out
of the hands of their enemies or oppressor. Now because such deliverance may
either be by strong hand, as God redeemed his people out of Egypt, and as
Abraham redeemed Lot, or by ransom, we are here to understand deliverance by
ransom, for so the original word does signify, and the Apostle restraines it
to that, 1 Timothy 26.
and says in plain terms, that he gave himself a ransom for all.



death and damnation, he delivered us by strong hand, he destroyed through
death him that had the power of death that the Devil had delivered them which
for fear of death were all their life time subject to bondage. Hebr. 2.14.


It will be further objected, Ob.
if we were in bondage unto Satan and his captives, then the price of our
redemption was paid to him and not to God, for the ransom is commonly paid to
him who has the captives under his hand.

We were properly captives to the justice of God in the Law; and the curse of
the Law, Christ Jesus, we have deliverance from the guilt and punishment of all
our sins, by the ransom of his death as a price paid to God his Father to
satisfy his justice, before we come to such things as may be hence observed I
will briefly answer a doubt for satisfaction of some, who happily may move the
question and not be able to resolve themselves.

The doubt is this,

I answer; we must know and hold it for a truth, ad extra are common to the
whole Trinity, God the Father Son and holy Ghost, work together even in this
work of our redemption, but yet Christ the matter of our salvation is said by
a matter of excellency to be our only redeemer, Christ a redeemer in 3.
respects.
and that in a threefold respect.

First, because he only is God and man, for it was necessary



Leuit 25.49. Heb. 2.14.
yet by an excellency Christ is our only redeemer, and in him alone we have
redemption, because he is God and man deputed to that office, and had right of
propinquity and neerenesse unto us; we are here to mark the Apostle places
redemption in the remission of sins (In whom we have redemption): hence
follows this conclusion that none are redeemed by the death of Christ, but
only None are redeemed by Christ but only Gods elect.
And none are justified in Gods sight but those whom he predestinate, for none
have faith whereby they apprehend and apply Christ to their justification in
his sight, but such as were preordained to life and salvation. Now then
redemption being here placed in remission of sins, and remission of sins
being a part of justification in the sight of God, hereupon it follows
necessarily that none are redeemed by the death of Christ, Act. 13.45.
but only Gods elect. Again, if we should say Christ died for all, elect and
reprobate, then this would follow that he died for some who now are frying in
the fire of hell, which is a most absurd conclusion even contumelious and
blasphemous against Christ, it is as much as to say that Christ died for some
and after that was not able to bring them to life and salvation, the Apostle
has taught us that he gave himself for his Church, Ephesians. 5.25.26.
and the true members of it that he migh sanctify it and cleanse it, and so
make it meet for his kingdom of glory.

But will some say, 2. Peter 2.1.
and bring upon themselves swift damnation.

We are to understand these words (that bought them) as spoken not according
to the judgment of infallibi^ity,

It will be further said, 2. Cor. 5.19.
nor imputing their sins unto them, and has committed to us the word of
reconciliation. 1. John. 2.2.
He is the reconciliation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for
the sins of the whole world.

Again, John 3.6.
that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,
for God does embrace none but his elect in his eternal love: 1. Tim. 2.6.
the antecedent cause of sending his son into the world.

If any yet further say we read that Christ gave himself a ransom for all
men, to be a testimony in due time.

The answer is this not all and every particular man, meaning is, not every
particular disease, but all sorts of diseases.

Confutation of that opinion that Christ died for all, both elect and reprobate.
this might be pressed to the confutation of such as hold the contrary opinion,
namely that Christ his death is not only sufficient but effectual for all,
both the chosen of God and them also that are rejected of God, and that some
notwithstanding the death of Christ are condemned, they hold that comes to
pass not for their sins, as being truly satisfied for, by Christ, but for
their unbelief, by which they do again make the reconciliation made between
God and them void, and of none effect, which is an opinion utterly untrue, but
I will not further stand to refute it.

It is a mere fancy that there is universal redemption by Christ.
to teach us that it is but a fond imagination, and a foolish thing for us, to
think that there is an universal redemption by Christ, and that he died for
all, as some vainly shroud themselves under this, without reason or ground,
when they are convinced of sin, and forced to confess that they are grievous
sinners, then they fly to this, Christ died for all; many lean to this staff
of reed, and deceive themselves. We must learn to acknowledge and embrace
this truth, and be resolved of it, that Christ died only for Gods Elect
effectually, and if we will have comfort by his death, and by the doctrine of
redemption wrought by him, we must labor to find our selves in the number of
the redeemed, a Savior and Redeemer, by merit procuring the pardon of sin,
to him he is a Savior by efficacy also, by turning his heart from sin to
God; it is plainly propounded, that Christ gave himse fe to redeem, and to
purge; Tit. 2.14.
the proposition is copulative not disjunctive, and it is the rule of reason,
that if one part of the copulative proposition be false, the other also is
false; if then thou would know whether Christ has redeemed thee from the
guilt and punishment of sin, look into thy self, and see whether he has
purged thee from the filthiness of sin; if thou be not purged from the
filthiness of sin, out of al question thou art not redeemed from iniquity,
Note.
he that is not by Christ his death turned from sin, is not by it redeemed
from the punishment of sin, from hell, death and condemnation. In that the
Apostle says, the blood of Christ, that is, the death of Christ, the death of
the Cross, being an accursed death, Gal 3.13.
a death joined with the malediction of the Law.

Was Christ the means of our redemption and deliverance, The greatness of sin
is known by the death of Christ.
Hence we learn to know the horrible greatness of sin, it being such as no
creature in the world, neither Angel nor Saint, no not all Angels or Saints
were able to appease the wrath of God, and to satisfy his justice for it, but
only the death of his own dear Son, no nor as the doting Friars do dream,
one drop of the blood of Christ, let fall from his finger, had been sufficient
to redeem us, no punishment but death, even the cursed death of the cross,
was sufficient to that purpose.

Let us then look on Christ crucified, We are to look upon Christ crucified,
that we may see the ugly face of si^ne.
that God hates it with endless hatred, in that nothing would satisfy his
wrath for it, but the precious blood of his dear Son, and that powered out by
the cursed death of the Cross; men commonly esteem some sins but light and
trifling, as customarie swearing, breaking the Sabbath, idleness, wanton
jesting, etc. But we must know that these are of such weight, as they pulled
down the Son of God, from his throne of Majesty and glory, and caused him
to humble himself to death, and to suffer the cursed death of the Cross, and
to pour out his most precious blould for our redemption, there was no means
to redeem us from our sin, but the death of the Son of God, therefore
learn we to make conscience of every sin, (through his blood) I might here
enter into the question, and speak at large of it, whether Christ suffered in
soul or no, but I hold it not so profitable to stand upon that point; only in
a word know we thus much, that whatsoever Christ took of our nature, he took
it to this end, to suffer in it, and by suffering to save and redeem it. And
again, wherein Adam and we properly sin, by the same Christ the second Adam
made satisfaction for sin. But Christ took the whole nature of man, body
and soul, and both Adam and we commit sin both in body and soul.

Christ verily and properly suffered in soul.
Therefore, no doubt Christ verily and properly suffered in soul, as he endured
pains and torments in his flesh; I will not further enlarge this. Come we to
some other point of further instruction, we are to mark, the Apostle says,
Gods elect have redemption, that is, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from
the guilt and punishment of their sins, through the blood of Christ, that is,
his bloody death.

The means and meritorious cause of remission of sins is Christ his body
broken and his blood shed.
is not the body and blood of Christ it self, abstracted and considered apart
from his passion, but his body broken and his blood shed, his painful
suffering, his bearing in body and soul the extremity of Gods wrath, we need
not seek far for proof of this, the Apostle says in this chap. ver 20.
reconciliation was wrought by him of all things to himself, and to that he set
at peace through the blood of his cross, both the things in earth and the
things in heaven, ver, 22. In the body of his flesh through death, Heb. 9.22.
and we have it in express words, that without shedding of blood, there is no
remission, he says not without blood, but without shedding of blood, the
reason and ground of this is, because the Law of God being broken, and God
being offended by sin, nothing could satisfy his justice, Acts 20.28. It is
there said, that God has purchased his Church with his own blood, not that
God can suffer or shed blood, but we are thus to conceive it, that Christ
suffered only as he was man, yet because of the personal union of God and
man in Christ, it is said, that God shed his blood, giving us to understand the
infinite merit and sufficiency of his death.

The point thus proved, come we to apply it; Confutation of popish
transubstantiation.
and first is this a truth, that the means and meritorious cause of remission
of sins, is not the body and blood of Christ a part from his death then what
use is left of popish transubstantiation for which the Papists much contend, if
we should grant unto them, John 6.63.
which they are never able to prove, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament,
are turned into the substance of Christ his body and blood; yet what profit
should come by that bodily presence? surely none, by the sentence of our Savior
himself the flesh profits nothing. Bellarmines own confession is, that a man
may eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood after a corporal manner, and
yet profit himself nothing at all.



ordained nothing in his Church, either idle or supersti^ious: to come nearer
to our selves, is it so, that the meritorious cause of the remission of sins is
not the body and blood of Christ considered apart from his passion, but his
body broken, and his blood shed upon the Cross; we must then know that it is
not sufficient for us to understand, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament
are signs of the body and blood of Christ, for the body and blood of Christ
are not profitable abstracted from the work done in his body; many in their
simplicity and weakness, think they are suff^ciently instructed in the
matter of receiving the Sacrament, if being asked they be able to answer, that
the bread signifies the body of Christ, and the wine his blood, but we must
know this is not sufficient, we are further to It is sufficient to understand
that the bread and wine in the sacrament are signs of the body and blood of
Christ.
that bread and wine in the Sacrament, are memorials and remembrances of the
body of Christ broken and of his blood shed and powered out on the Cross for
the remission of sins, we are not to sever the remembrance of his body from
his death and passion, but together with the remembrance of his body, we are
to remember his painful and meritorious suffering in his body and soul the
wrath of God for our sins, and when we eat the bread and drink the wine of
the Sacrament, we are then at the very same instant to lift up our hearts to
heaven, and by Faith to feed upon the body of Christ broken, and by faith to
apprehend and apply the infinite merit of his death and passion to our own
fowls, particularly for the pardon of our sins. If we content our selves
with receiving the bread and wine as signs of the body and blood of Christ
thought upon and considered apart from his passion we then make the receipt of
the Sacrament unprofitable unto us, and very dangerous and hurtful for them,
we receive the sign without the thing signified, for if we receive not the
whole thing signified, we receive it not at all, and so we profane the sign,
and as much as is in us trample the blood of Christ under our feet, we eat
and drink our own damnation, we hasten some heavy judgment of God upon us.
Yea howsoever we seem to disclaim all Popery, yet thus receiving of the
bread and wine in the Sacrament, as sins of the body and blood of Christ
never remembering the suffering of Christ in his body, we therein give place to
a popish opinion, and to a distinction by them newly devised that the Sacrament
is a remembrance of Christ and not of his death. Let us then learn our duty
that when we come to receive the Sacrament, we are then by faith to feed on the
body of Christ broken, and on his blood shed on the Cross.

Come we to the last words (that is the forgiveness of our sins) we are to
mark that the Apostle makes redemption and remission of sins equivalent, of
equal reach and signification, in respect of Gods elect, that they that are
redeemed by the blood of Christ, have by it remission of their sins, he
expounds the one by the other.

Such as truly apprehend and apply the merit of Christ his death have full and
perfect remission of their sins. Heb. 10, 4
have full and perfect remission of their sins; for why? by the death of
Christ they have perfect redemption, with one offering has he consecrated or
made perfect for ever those that are sanctified, and here redemption and
remission of sins are made conuertible terms, that through the bloody death of
Christ we have redemption, that is, remission of sins, therefore it must
needs follow, that as many as truly apprehend the merit of Christ's death have
perfect remission of their sins. Note.
This will further appear if we consider after what manner sin is forgiven,
and that is by an action of God, whereby for the merit of Christ he accounts
sin as no sin, or as if it were never committed, and as a debt discharged,
for so much is implied in that petition, forgive us our trespasses or debts,
forgiveness of sin being an action of God, it must needs be most perfect,
for all the actions of God are most perfect, again, is it for the merit of
Christ, how then can it be any way defective; Christ his merit being infinite,
and every way answerable to the justice of God? Can remission of sin procured
by it be imperfect? it is not possible, we may then safely conclude, that as
many as truly apprehend and apply the merits of Christ's death have full and
perfect remission of their sins, where then is any place for that popish
distinction of remission of the fault, and not of the punishment? Consutation
of that popish distinction of the fault pardoned and the punishment retained


First, besides the relation that is between the fault and Leu. 20.19.20
such affinity and so near agreement between the fault and the punishment, as
that these two they are taken sometimes one for the other. They shall bear
their iniquity, that is to say, the punishment of their iniquity. He bare our
sins in his body on the tree, 1 Pet. 2.24.
that is to say, the punishment of our sins: for the Apostle in that speech
of his had an eye to that, Isai. 53.5.
he was wounded for our transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities, the
chastisements of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes are we healed.
Hereby then would the holy Ghost have us to understand that the fault and
punishment of sin cannot be so far disioyned and so drawn asunder as the
popish sort would have them, that the one should be pardoned, and the other
still retained.

John 1.29.
Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world,) then he is
unjust, but far be it from us so to think, it is all one as to require the
payment and satisfaction of a debt forgiven, which whosoever does is unjust. If
then they will not lay that imputation upon the Lord, which they would be loath
to lay upon a miserable mortal and sinful man, they must not charge him
with punishing any sin that he has forgiven.



Exception.
But against this they except, that some whose sins are pardoned, have
notwithstanding; sickness, poverty, contempt, yea death inflicted on them.
Therefore (say they) though sin be forgiven, yet the temporal punishment is
not removed?

These things spoken of and the like, Hebr. 12.
nor proceeding from an angry and displeased God. Again, they are laid on the
dear children of God to work in them amendment and care to avoid sin, and
for the exercise of Faith, the trial of patience, the stirring up of some
languishing graces that are in them, and for other good ends, and not to
satisfy for the temporal punishment: admit they were properly and truly
punishments (which cannot be proved) yet could they never answer and satisfy
the justice of God, for to satisfy God is not only to pay that we owe unto
him, but it does infer and imply full reconciliation with God; and a
pacification of his anger, and that God is well pleased with him that does
satisfy. Now the suffering of punishment cannot so satisfy God if it be
considered by it self, for then the damned in hell suffering punishment should
satisfy God, which is most false, therefore the person that must satisfy God
by suffering punishment must be considered, and he must be more then a mere
man, even God and man not able to undergo the punishment, Mat. 3.17.
but also such a one in whom God the Father is well pleased, as himself does
witness from heaven. So then though we grant that sickness, poverty and such
like were punishments; yet could they not satisfy the justice of God, because
the suffering of punishment considered by it self does not satisfy God unless
the person suffering be more then a mere man even God and man and such a one in
whom God is well pleased. Howsoever then true believers have sickness, poverty
and such like laid upon them, yet we must know they are laid on the^ as
fatherly chastisements and corrections, or as trialls for the exercise of their
faith and patience, for the stirring up of the good graces that be in them, and
not as punishments: and if they were laid on them as punishments, yet could
they not satisfy the justice of God. And therefore we are not to suffer our
selves to be drawn from this truth, full of sweet comfort, that by the bloody
death of Christ, all that truly lay hold of the merit of it, have full and
perfect remission of their sins, and freedom from all punishments temporal
and eternal.

Our duty is wholly to forgive the offenses of our brethren.
Let then as many of us as truly believe it, learn our duty following upon
it, and that is this, when we forgive the offenses of our brethren, we are
wholly to forgive them, even utterly to forgo all malice against offenders,
or offenses against us. Ephesians. 4.32.
It is plainly taught by the Apostle, forgiving one another, even as God for
Christ his sake forgave you. How does God for Christ his sake forgive us? we
have heard it delivered and proved even fully and perfectly, therefore we must
take heed of mincing the matter, and of half remission to our brerhren,
forgiving some part of the offense, and carrying a piece vnforgiuen; O evil
servant, says our Savior in the Parable, Mat. 18.32.
I forgave thee not a piece but all, and as I had pity on thee, so certainly,
thy pity ought to have extended as far as mine, to the forgiveness of the
whole debt of thy fellow servant; we see then our duty, that in forgiving the
offenses of our brethren, we are to follow the example of the Lord, we are
fully and wholly to forgive them, and to that purpose, know and consider we but
this one thing, that if we forgive not all to our brethren, whenever they
have offended us, we cannot then put up that petition to the Lord, forgive us
our debts, as we also forgive our debtours with any comfort, let the latter
part of that petition be a promise of ours to the Law, or a Law binding all
that look for mercy from the Lord, to show mercy, or a note of assurance, we
cannot use it with comfort, we therein fearfully pray against our selves, for
we reserving a piece of our malice against our brethren: in that petition we
beseech the Lord to reserve also a part of his wrath against us, forgiving us
but as we forgive others, and that being well considered, is able to make any
heart seasoned with grace, to tremble to think upon it, that we should so
fearfully open our mouths, yea, so boldly with our own tongues, call for wrath
and vengeance from Almighty God, let us (as we ought) consider and think
upon it, and let it stir us up fully and wholly to forgive the offenses of
our brethren, let us not remember in malice the least offense of our brethren,
least the Lord remember in judgment any of our sins, and so strike us as he
may justly, both body and soul to the bottom of hell, where no remission nor
redemption is to be hoped for.

VER. 15. Who is the image of the invisible God, the first borne of every
creature.
The Apostle here begins his proof, of the sufficiency of the work of
redemption wrought by Christ, that he is a perfect and sufficient Redeemer of
Gods chosen, his proof is laid down in three verses, the 15.16. and 17. he
proves it from the dignity of his person, showing that he is true and
eternal God, and therefore a perfect Redeemer. And that Christ is true and
eternal God, is first propounded by the Apostle, verse. 15. and then confirmed
verse 16. and 17. In the 15 verse containing the general proposition, are two
things affirmed of Christ, first, that he is the image of the invisible God;
and secondly, the first borne of every creature. Come we to more strict
examination of these things, and for the first, I will stand a while to open
the sense and meaning of the words, and not to trouble you with any curious and
unnecessary speculations, but to hold to the scope and drift of the Apostle
which was to propound sound Doctrine of faith, and to teach how with profit we
are to conceive of the person of Christ. Christ the image of God his father two
ways.
Know that Christ is the image of God his Father two ways. First, as he is the
eternal Son, of the same substance with the Father: and so his most absolute
and perfect essential image, for having the very same eternal essence and
substance with the Father, he does most perfectly represent him:
Interpretation. Heb. 1.3.
hence he is said to be the brightness of his glory, and the engraven form of
his person. Secondly, as he is God manifested in the flesh, as the Apostle
speaks, 1. Tim. 3.16.
because God being invisible does manifest himself in Christ, in whom he has
made himself known to us, to be most wise, just, and merciful; most wise,
because in Christ he expressed toward us, both perfect justice and perfect
mercy; and in Christ most just, because in him he perfectly punished all our
sins laid on him, as on our surety, and most merciful also in Christ,
because for his merit and satisfaction, he perfectly forgave his chosen all
their sins, and made them heirs of his kingdom of glory, thus is Christ
the image of God. The next word to be expounded is (invisible) for the clearing
of that, consider we thus much. That seeing is of two sorts, either with the
outward eye of the body, or with the eye of the mind. Concerning the outward
sight, whereby curious and ignorant people would be glad to see God, hardly
thinking there is a God, because they see him not with their bodily eyes, the
truth is, God cannot be seen, because he is a Spirit most simple and pure,
and not subject to the outward sense, therefore he says to Moses, Thou can
not see my face, Exodus 33.20.
for there shall no man see me and live. And the Apostle, 1. Tim 6.16.
God dwells in the light that none can attain unto, whom never man saw,
neither can see; touching sight by the eye of the mind, we must distinguish
our estate here in this life, from that it shall be in the life to come, and
know that by the mind whilst we are here, we are not able to see God as he
is in himself, because all our knowledge here, is by some outward forms or
fashions, which we conceive in our mind and understanding, and though we find
it said, that the Lord spoke to Moses face to face; Exodus 33.11.
we are to know that those words note only a more familiar and gracious manner
of speaking, not that he saw God in substance and essence as he is, and in the
life to come, as many as go to heaven shall see God in a most excellent
manner, and with such comfort as no heart can comprehend, Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God; Matthew. 5.8.
yet not simply as he is in his own nature, because he is infinite, and we
shall be still finite, though changed from corruption. Thus we have it made
plain, how God is invisible, because no way can he be seen, as he is in his
own nature, of any creature, either with the eye of the body, or with the eye
of the mind, in this life or in the life to come. It is only the Son of God
that has that sight of God his Father, for he is in the bosom of his Father:
and the sight that man or Angel, has of God in heaven; is, by a mediate
person, the Son of God. So then the meaning of the Apostle in these words is
briefly this; who is the eternal Son of God, of the same substance with his
Father, and in whom being incarnate; God who is invisible, not to be seen
either with the eye of the body, or with the eye of the mind in this life, or
in the life to come, in his own nature immediately has made himself known to
us to be most wise, just and merciful.

Now to the doctrine hence to be gathered: First we are The Godhead of Christ
is the first ground of our redemption.
that he is the essential image of God his father, and therefore a sufficient
and perfect Redeemer, that is the Apostles reason; Whence we may conclude,
that is the Godhead of Christ is the first ground of our redemption, it is not
grounded first upon the manhood of Christ, but upon Jesus Christ, God equal
with the Father in Majesty and glory. Yet we must remember that he is our
Mediator, in respect of both nature divine and humane, I will not enlarge the
point having said something of it before.

But for the use Our redemption by the blood of Christ stands firm and fast
for ever.
it must needs follow, that his blood is a most precious blood, and our
redemption made by that blood must of necessity hold, and stand firm and fast
for ever, all the power of hell shall never be able to ouerturne it, if once we
truly believe in Christ, we can never be utterly cast away. Upon this very
ground, that he and his Father are one, does our Savior infer, John. 10.28.
that his sheep shall never perish; and keep this for a sure ground, when
thou art tempted about thy redemption, and the certainty of it. We are further
here to mark, that the Apostle proouing Christ a perfect Redeemer, by an
argument from his God head, says not in one word that he is God, but he
delivers it in these terms, that he is the image of the invisible God, a true
and lively representation of God: setting out unto us his infinite wisdom,
justice and mercy.

True and saving knowledge of Christ, is never severed from true knowledge of
Gods infinite wisdom, justice and mercy.
can never be severed from the true knowledge of the infinite wisdom, justice
and mercy of God; they that truly know Christ, and by the eye of a true faith
look upon him, do in him, and by him see and behold, know and acknowledge the
infinite wisdom, justice and mercy of God; as when we look on the true
pattern and express image of any thing, we come to know the shape and form
of the first type, the thing resembled, so looking and truly beholding Christ,
the true image of God, we cannot but know the wisdom, justice and mercy of God
his Father, revealed and appearing in him. It is the speech of Christ himself,
Ioh. 14.7. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also* and when
Philip said unto him, Lord, show us thy Father, and it suffices, our Savior
checked him verse the ninth, Have I been so long time with you, and have thou
not known me Philip? he that has seen me, has seen my Father. How then
say thou, show us thy Father? To this agrees that of the Apostle, 2. Cor.
4.4.
that Christ which is the image of God should not shine unto them, then verse.
6. that we have the knowledge of the g^ory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ;
come we to apply this; is it so, that they who truly know Christ, do in him,
and by him as in a clear glass, see behold and know the wisdom, justice and
mercy of God; then let this be to us a ground of examination.

Let us every one from hence learn to reason back again on this manner if we
truly know not the wisdom, Trial and examination of our selves.
but by spiritual knowledge, even by special distinct and working knowledge,
then we know not Christ by any true and saving knowledge, for they that truly
know Christ, know with him and by him, the wisdom, justice and mercy of God.
If many men and women were examined touching this point, though they profess
Christ and Christian religion yet they would be found to know God no more then
the very Heathen, who never heard of Christ. I dare be bold to say, many there
be that have only a natural knowledge of God, which all men have by the
light of nature, or such as is gathered by the sight of the creatures; and that
no man may except against my speech, and say this is hard that we should so be
taxed, we live in a Church, where the knowledge of God is plainly taught, we
hear it sounding in our ears, and we cannot be so ignorant, let them
therefore hear how I prove it from the mouth of the Apostle, He says of
them, 1. Cor. 15.34.
that said let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Awake to live
righteously, for some have not the knowledge of God.

The proposition is laid down by the Apostle, and it is this, they that give
themselves to eating and drinking and sensuality, and live securely in their
sins, have not the knowledge of God, now the assumption may be made by too
many in the world, and then the conclusion must needs follow upon the premises,
that they have no knowledge of God it they will have it further proved; then
hear the Lords own Argument, he says, verse the 1. he had a controversy, he
was to enter an action against his people for want of knowledge, Hos. 4.2.
and how does he prove it? thus verse 2. by swearing and lying, killing and
stealing, and whoring they break out, and blood touched blood. To go no
further then the very first thing, is swearing an argument of the want of
knowledge of God? (it must needs be so, God having manifested himself most
plainly a just auenger of that sin) then many there be that can tell
themselves, if they will not palpably flatter themselves that they are such as
know not God, their speeches are more powdered with oaths, then their meat with
salt, yea their children may witness against them, whose tongues are no sooner
taught to speak plainly, but they learn to swear most wickedly: a man may
hear it from them playing in the streets, and so may truly judge of the
parents that they have no true knowledge of God themselves, neither care they
to teach others under them either by word or example to know the Lord. It is
then plainly proved against many, that will they, nill they, of force they
must confess they have no true knowledge of God, then let such as be
convinced consider that which was before delivered, that they know not Christ
by any saving knowledge, but as the devils know him, and let them mark the
sequel, and that which follows upon this, that they not knowing Christ, Christ
will not know them, when he comes to divide between the sheep and the goats,
he will not then acknowledge them for his, but say depart from me ye workers of
iniquity I know you not. Which is a heavy sentence and to be thought on with
trembling, and let it stir us up to labor for the true knowledge of God as he
has manifested himself in Christ, a God of infinite wisdom, justice, and
mercy, not a God all of mercy and no justice, that is to set up an idol of our
own brain, to think there is mercy with God though we repent not, but go on
in our sins. Let us labor to know God as he has revealed himself in
Christ, his express image a God of infinite wisdom, Note.
justice and mercy, that so we may assure our selves we truly know Christ, and
are known of Christ, and shall be acknowledged to be his at his coming, and to
help us yet forward in this duty, let us further consider that if the heathen
were left without excuse by the sight of the creatures, then much more shall we
by the sight of Christ the express image of God, if we know not God as we
ought, if we have greater light and means to know God by the coming of Christ
in the flesh then they, what a shame is it to have less knowledge of God then
they, if we in Christ see not Gods infinite wisdom and mercy, we are most
blind, we are even fools besotted and bewitched by the Devil, they are the
words of the Apostle. Gal. 3.1.
O foolish Galathians who has bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth
to whom Jesus Christ was before described in your sight and among you
crucified. If Christ be set before us in lively colors by the preaching of
the word and the administration of the Sacramants and we see not in him the
infinite wisdom, justice, and mercy of God we are bewitched and deluded by
the devil, let this be thought on, and let it stir us up to labor to know
the infinite justice and mercy of God expressed in the face of Jesus Christ. We
are further to mark the Epithet the Apostle here gives to God (invisible)
he says not the image of God omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, though
these things might have been truly affirmed of God, but the image of the
invisible God, whereby (no doubt) he would We must acknowledge God to be every
where present, though we see him not.
the same God who is every where present, yet is not to be seen, our lesson
arising hence is this, we are to acknowledge God to be every where present,
though invisible, and though we see him not, for God who fills both heaven and
earth is invisible and cannot be seen, if he could be seen, then must he be a
body, Psalm. 145.3.
and if so, then to be divided into parts and included in a place, and so not
infinite contrary to that. Great is the Lord, his greatness incompreh^nsible,
not to be shut up within the compass of any place, we are therefore to know
and acknowledge that God is every where present, though not seen of us. We
find this point expressed in most excellent terms by David, Psalm. 139.
where there is not a word escapes him, that God was seen of him, David knew
it well that he is a spirit invisible but yet he sets it out in most exce^lent
manner that God wa^ every where present with him, that he was with him a^ ^is
down sitting, and at his vpri^ing, about his bed, and about his paths, not a
word in his tongue but he knew it, let him move either upward or downward, to
the right hand or to the left, with never so great speed, even as speedily as
the Sun beams, from the East to the West, yet he could not flee from the
presence of the Lord, nor hide himself under any covert or darkness from the
al-seeing eye of God: thus it was with David, and we are to learn it by his
example, thus it ought to be with us, we are to acknowledge God, though
invisible and not seen of us, yet every where present. And if we would
further be resolved of this point, for the ground of it, consider we but that
which experience may teach us, namely this, men many times who sin in secret,
and have no eye of man looking on them, yet notwithstanding they tremble and
fear. Whence comes this? Surely their own conscience tells them that their
close and secret sins are seen of God though he be not seen of them, yea
when the conscience does fail in this testimony, (as many times it does,
being hardened by custom of sin) then the very dumb and senseless
creatures are sometimes made remembrancers and accusers of men for their
sins, as the Lord threarneth by his Prophet. Stories are full of examples of
this kind, yea, no doubt, Habac. 2.1^.
many of us may remember that we have either known or heard of some who have
been brought to confess their seeret sins by the sight of the fouls of the
air, yea sometimes such diseases have been sent upon men, as have made their
own mouths to publish and bewray their secret sin. What are these things
but even plain evidences and demonstrations that though God be invisible, yet
he is every where present, and sees things done in the most secret places of
the world, and when it pleases him, and by what means it likes him best does
he bring them to light. We are then to acknowledge it for a truth, though God
be invisible, yet he is every where present.

To enforce this yet further because indeed that is chiefly to be intended, and
driven at in this point,

Consider first it is one special means to work in us inward soundnes and
truth of heart, nothing is more effectual to keep us from hypocrisy, Our
hearts are to be settled in the truth of doctrine before delivered it will be a
means to keep us, first from hypocrisy.
and many other gross sins then this, what servant so lewd that will not
yield to his master eye service at the least: In like sort when we know and
acknowledge Gods presence, and that his eye looks on us, that he is a
beholder, a witness and judge of all our actions, and if we sin, we lie open
to his judgments, Secondly from sinning upon supposed secrecy.
who is it but one given over to sin and to the power of hell that will not
fear to offend, the undoubted persuasion of Gods presence will set a bar
before our corruption and keep it in: again it takes from our corruption, and
from Satan's alluring us to sin, that advantage which many times is imagined,
that is secrecy that we may sin because we are in secret, it is a
corruption bred and borne with us to seek corners, with us to commit sin,
shifts and excuses to hide it: the eye of the adulterer waits for the
twilight, and says no eye shall me, and gisguiseth his face. Upon this the
Devil takes advantage, and by it preuailes so far with some, that he does
utterly blot out of their minds the remembrance of Gos presence, and makes
them presume to sin with boldness, because (as they imagine) they are in
secret, that God, he is above, and the clouds they hide him that he cannot see,
and he walks in the circuit of heaven. Now this corruption of ours, Job.
22.14.
and this subtilty of Satan are crossed, and that liberty that some give
themselves to sin is taken away, by a settled persuasion of this, that God
though he be invisible, yet he is every where present, as many as truly
acknowledge God every where present, they cannot be emboldened to sin, the
Devil cannot prevail with them to sin, because they are in secret and want
witnesses, for they know God sees them, and there is no creature which is not
manifest in his sight, let us then labor to have in our hearts a full
persuasion of this, that God though he be invisible, yet he is every where
present, and we shall find it effectual to work in us inward soundness of
heart, and a notable means to defeat the subtilty and cunning of the Devil,
that he shall not be able to circumuent us, as he does many thousands in the
world, persuading with them that they are in secret, and therefore they may
sin, we shall be able to beat back this assault, and to tell him though we
see not God, yet God does see us, and all we think, speak or do, which is
more then if all the men in the world should see us, for he can kill soul as
well as body, and cast both soul and body into hell fire.

Come we to the second thing affirmed of Christ in this verse, that he is the
first borne of every creature, and for the understanding of the words, we
must know that the Apostle calls Christ the first borne, by way of resemblance
and allusion to the first borne in the old testament. Now Christ is so called
in a double respect, Interpretation.
first, because as the first borne were brought forth before the rest of their
brethren, so Christ as God was begotten of the substance of his Father before
any creature was made, or had being, he was begotten from al eternity after an
unspeakable manner, John 1.1.
before the world was. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with
God, and the word was God. When things created began to be, then he was, and
so before all creatures even from eternity, for time began together with the
world, and before the creation was eternity.

Secondly, because as the first borne son among the people of Israel,
succeeded his Father in the Kingdom, and Priesthood, and was Lord and
Governor of his brethren, so Christ was made heir of the world, Heb. 1.2.
and chief governor of Gods family, his children elected and adopted in him;
now here we are to understand the words of the Apostle, in the first respect
not in the second, because the purpose of the Apostle was here, to set out unto
us, the eternity of Christ his Godhead and not to speak of him as God and
man, for in that respect, namely, in respect of his manhood assumed unto unity
of person with his Godhead, he is resembled to the first borne, as he has
relation to his Church, Romans 8 29.
therefore called the first borne among many brethren. So then the words are
thus to be conceived, who was begotten of God his Father from all eternity,
before any creature was made, or had being.

Let us now come to the doctrine offered from these The eternal generation of
Christ is unspeakable.
that the Apostle speaking of the eternity of Christ, he sets it not down
simply, that he was from all eternity, but in a comparison, that he is the
first borne of every creature: whence we are taught, that the eternal
generation of Christ is unspeakable, as he is God begotten of his Father from
all eternity, we are not able to comprehend it, Revel. 19.12 Isai. 53.8.
but by way of shadow or resemblance: he is said to have a name written, that
no man knows but himself, and the Prophet says, who shall declare his age.

Let us not then curiously search into it, We are not curiously to search into
Christ his eternal generation.
nor into any of Gods mysteries, further then the holy Ghost in the Word goes
before us, and take for a truth, they that know God, and his secrets revealed
in his Word, are thus affected; they modestly and humbly come to the hearing of
the Word, and with trembling heart; and the more the Lord opens himself and
his mysteries to them, the more they find and feel their own wants and
weakness to behold such glory, and none come more boldly, and with less
reverence and preparation, then they that know nothing.

Come we to another thing offered unto us from this resemblance, full of sweet
comfort to all that belong to Christ is most dear and tenderly beloved of God
his Father.
is as the first borne, then any may easily gather it, that he is most dear
and tenderly beloved of God his Father; even so dear, as the first borne son
is commonly to an earthly Father, nay, there is no comparison between them,
but only for our capacity, it may thus be deliuerd, his love exceeds the
love of the most kind Father in the world, as far as God excels dust, earth,
sin, and corruption; to stand to prove this, were as much as to go about to
add light to the Sun: Let us rather consider the comfort of it, we know what
affection every one commonly bears to the fruit of his own body, to his first
borne, Comfort to the members of Christ.
it would go to the heart of a tender father, to see a leg or an arm of
their first borne cut off by the hand of a bloody butcher; let this lead us to
the consideration (as we are able to conceive it) of the Lords tender love and
affection to the members of Christ, his first borne, and teach us that he much
less can endure the wrongs done to any member of his Son, cruelties
exercised on them, pierce his gracious bowels, the Lord may, and does suffer
many afflictions to be laid on the members of Christ, for their good best
known to himself, as an earthly father perceiving cause of further good, does
sometimes suffer his chide to lie in prison, to be in want, to bite on the
bridle for a time, and as the saying is, he may see him need, but he cannot
endure to see him bleed; so our gracious God in his wisdom, for much good
known to himself may see the members of his son humbled; schooled and wayned
from the love of this wretched world, but undone, and utterly cast away, he
cannot endure it, he will not suffer it, no, he will not see it, let this be
had in remembrance, as a sweet comfort to all Gods Children in their greatest
afflictions.

VER. 16. For by him were all things created, which are in
The Apostle in this verse proves his general proposition laid down ver. the
15. That Christ is the true eternal God, begotten of his Father from all
eternity, this he proves by two arguments. First, because Christ is the
creator of all things. Secondly, because all things were created and made for
his glory. The first argument is laid down in the first words, for by him were
all things made, and that is resumed and repeated in the latter end of the
verse: in which argument, is special relation to the words of the former
verse, that he is the first borne of every creature. For if all things were
created by him, then it must needs follow, that he was before all things, and
that he was not created as Arrian Heretics hold, but begotten of his Father
from everlasting. Now this argument is further laid abroad, by a double
difference of things created, the Apopostle was not content to say in general,
that by Christ all things were created, but he does further particularize, and
unfold what he means by all things. First, by a difference of place, wherein
things created are, heaven and earth; which are in heaven and which are in
earth, then by difference of their quality, visible and invisible, after this,
follows another amplification by special instance, the Apostle insisting in
one sort of invisible creatures, namely Angels, which he calls by these titles
of honor and dignity, Thrones or Dominions, Principalities or Powers; he has
made all invisible creatures, even the most excellent invisible creatures, the
Angels, whether ye call them thrones etc. and then repeats the general, all
things were created by him; and thus far goes the first argument. The second
is in the very last words (and for him) and these be the parts of this verse.
Come we to speak of the words, as they are laid down by the holy Ghost, and
first of the words (for by him were all things created) whereas the Apostle
says (by him) namely, by Christ: though that phrase and form of speech
applied to any work, Interpretation.
do commonly signify the means, or instrument of working; yet here we are
not so to conceive it, as that Christ was an under instrument, or inferior
means of creating as the Arrian Heretics wickedly would have concluded, but
that by his substantial power, and virtue equal to the power of God his
Father, all things were created, Whatsoever the Father does, Ioh. 5.19.
the same things does the Son also. And again, we are not to understand
these words (by him) as spoken exclusiuely, as shutting out God the Father and
holy Ghost, for that is contrary to the first Article of our Creed, that God
the Father is the Creator of all things, and we are to remember the rule,
that Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indiuisa, and therefore the work of
creation, is a work of the whole Trinity; but we are to conceive of this, and
of that in the first Article, as set down only to show the order and manner
of the creation, that God the Fathers, as he is the fountain of the Godhead,
not temporal but original, so as the first author, he created all things by
God the Son, as Ioh. 1.3. All things were made by it, that is, by the Son,
the substantial Word of the Father, (created) that is, which were not before,
formed and made to be, and that of nothing, thus then are these words to be
conceived: For by his substantial power, equal to the power of God his
Father, working together with the Father and the holy Ghost, were all things
that were not before, framed and made and that of nothing.

Now to the doctrine, first we are to mark the argument of the Apostle, that
he proves Christ to be true and eternal God, by an argument from the
creation, that he created all things, and therefore he is God eternal, whence
it follows directly and plainly, that the work of creation, does manifestly
euince and prove the Godhead, he The work of creation is a plain proof of
the Godhead.
he that is able to create is God; for it is a property peculiar to the
Godhead incommunicable to create, it cannot be given nor agree to any
creature, Saint or Angel; no not to all the Saints and Angels, for that were
to make them omnipotent to give being to any thing, that was nothing before, is
proper to God. It is the Lords own argument to prove himself God, he says
verse 6. I am the Lord, Isay 45 7.
and there is none other. How proves he that verse 7. I form the light and
create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the Lord do all these
things. And Ier. 10.11. he brings it as an argument against idols and false
gods, to prove them no gods, but mere vanities as he calls them, and subject
to destruction: thus (says he) shall you say unto them, the gods that have not
made the heavens and the earth, shall perish from the earth, and from under the
heavens, and verse the 12. by way of opposition, he has made the earth, and
established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by
his descretion.

The point is clear, and for use of it, first it serves to discover Maniches,
Confutation of the Maniches.
such as held there were two authors, and two beginnings of things created, of
good and profitable God; of evil and hurtful, the Devil; we are to avoid
this as erroneous and false, and know that all things were created by God.

God made all things good, Ob.
how then came material evil things, (not to speak of natural evil, as
death and diseases, or moral evil, sin) how came scorpions, venomous
serpents to be evil and hurtful, will you say that God made them so?

Genesis 3.17.
but upon the fall, the Lord said, cursed is the earth for thy sake, in sorrow
shall thou eat of it, all the days of thy life. Again, we are to consider,
that the most poysonfull thing in the world, is good for something, though we
know not the use of it, experience teaches that one poison is driven out by
another, Psalm. 104.24.
therefore we are to say with the Psalmist, O Lord how manifold are thy works,
in wisdom, have thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.

We are to take heed of Satan's sl^ight in imitating the work of creation.
then let this teach us, to take heed of a cunning subtilty and slight, of the
Devil, who as in many other things, so in this, in the work of creation of
making things of nothing, would seem to imitate God, and would be like God, as
by iuglers, inchanters, and such like his instruments, he would seem to make
that to be which is not, and so does win to himself from simple people that
run after men of that cursed crew, from such I say as are simple and in the
Lords just judgment, given over to themselves, an opinion of great power, we
are to take heed of this subtilty, and know that the Devil cannot make the
least creature in the world, he by Gods permission, and for our trial may
delude the outward senses, and make things appear to be which are not as
Iannes and Iambres did, they turned their rods into serpents, and brought
frogs etc. and the witch of Endor who made counterset Samuel to rise out of
the earth, Exodus 7.8.
but he cannot make any true real and substantial creature, 1. Sam. 28.14.
or change a creature of one kind into another, when it pleases God to
restrain him, he is not able to make a counterfeit lowse, a base creture as we
read of the Egyptian inchanters, Exodus 8.18.
they assayed likewise with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they
could not. Let us not then be carried away with any conceit, that the Devil
can by a iugler or inchanter make any true creature. And because many there be
that are too forward to give heed to iuglers, and such deceivers, I would
entreat them but to consider the danger of giving heed to such persons, and let
them know that by such means the Devil does encroach and gather ground upon
them, and in time does get so far within them, as that he does seat and
settle himself upon their thoughts, he makes them to magnify him in their
conceit, yea, to deifie him in his instruments, and to ascribe unto him that
which is proper to God, even the power of creating things of nothing, which is
a most gross and abominable idolatry, in our thoughts to set up and magnify
the Devil in stead of God, what can be more gross? It was the sin of the
heathen.

But they will say this is my surmise and my imagination. Ob.


I answer them, Act. 8.9. we find that Simon the sorcerer used witchcraft and
bewitched the people of Samaria, saying, that he himself was some great man.
Mark what followed verse. 10. they gave heed unto him, from the least to the
greatest: and what was the issue of that? the Devil in time brought them to
this, even to ascribe unto himself in Simon his instrument the power of God:
they said this man is the great power of God. Let us therefore learn, that the
Devil is not able to make the least creature, and so be admonished not to
run after iuglers, giving heed unto them, lest the Devil get within us, even
so far, as to make us set up him in our thoughts in stead of the true God,
which is the most vile and gross kind of idolatry that can be, and cannot
choose but be the immediate forerunner of Gods heavy wrath and judgments. In
the next place we are to consider the generality of the Apostles words, that
all things were created by Christ: the work of creation wrought by Christ, as
God, is a general work, it is common to us, with all things that have a being
in the world, though there be a difference between us, and other creatures
under us, in quality and condition in respect of reason, yet they are the
creatures of Christ as he is God, as well as we. What is We must know Christ,
not only to be our Creator, but also to be our Redeemer and Sanctifier.
that our bodies and souls, and the members and faculties of them, are the
work of his hands, and that he is our Creator; for that is a common benefit,
extended to bruit beasts as well as to us; they have Christ, as he is God,
their Creator as well as we: we are therefore never to rest, till we know that
he is our Redeemer and Sanctifier, and that by him we are created anew, and by
him made new creatures, 2. Cor. 5 17. Gal. 6.15.
as the Apostle speaks, If any be in Christ, let him be a new creature: and he
says, that in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature; What a new creature is.
and in a word to tell you what it is to be a new creature, it is this, to have
the mind, will, and affections, and all the powers of the soul renewed, not in
substance, but in holiness and righteousness, and that in truth, according to
the image of God, in which we were first created.

Motives to stir us up to be created anew by Christ.
understanding, and ability, above many other creatures, we are to use them,
not only to consider the works of creation, and by them to see the power,
wisdom and goodness of God, but to have them sanctified by the word and
spirit, in faith and love, to serve the Lord, or else we have no more comfort,
by our reason and understanding, than bruit beasts by their sense and
vegetation. Psalm. 119 7.
This David knew well, and therefore said, Thy hands have made me and fashioned
me; and he does not there rest, as contenting himself to be the creature of
God, but ads further, give me knowledge that I may learn thy commandments,
or else I have no more comfort by this, than the bruit beasts have by their
sense.

Again, if we rest in our creation that we are the creatures

Come we now to the first difference of things created in respect of place, in
these words, which are in heaven: and that we proceed according to the true
meaning of the Apostle, ranging all things created into one of these two
places, heaven and earth, we must know first that the word heaven in proper
signification is taken in Scripture three ways, Interpretation.
sometimes to signify all that aeriall or elementarie region which is above
the globe of the earth and waters, to the lowest part or circle of heaven,
wherein the Moon is placed. Thus it is taken, Behold the fowls of heaven.
Mat. 6.26.
So also, Hypocrites, ye can discern (...), Luke 12.56.
by the brightness or cloudinesse of the air, ye can discern the weather. I
will hear the heavens, Hosea 2.21.
and they shall hear the earth.

Secondly, it is taken for all the celestial orbs, wherein the planets, the
Sun, the Moon, and the rest of the fixed stars are placed thus. Genesis 15.5.
Look up now unto the Heavens, and tell the stars if thou be able to number
them, says God to Abraham: and hence the stars are called the army or host
of heaven. Ierem. 33.22.


Thirdly, it is taken for the seat of the blessed Angels and Saints, whether
Christ is ascended, and from whence he shall come to judgment, thus it is
taken where the Apostle says he was taken up into the third heaven. 2. Cor.
12.2.
Now here it is taken generally for the air, the starrie sky, and the seat
of the blessed Angels and Saints: and by the earth we are to understand the
whole globe of the earth and waters, and as well the inward bowels of the
earth as the outward superficies of it. Where therefore the Apostle says which
are in heaven, and which are in the earth, it is as if he had thus said, which
are in the air, in the starrie sky, and in the seat of the blessed Angels
and Saints, and which are upon the face and inward parts of the earth.

Come we now to such things as may be observed from hence: first we are to
mark that the Apostle having set it down in general, that by Christ all
things were created, and that the work of creation wrought by Christ as God is
a general work, he does not there make a stop, but he does further amplify
this general by the special differences of things, that some things created
are in heaven, and some in earth, some visible and some invisible, whence we
may conclude, that though the work of creation be great and general, yet, it
is not confused, but it pleased The work of creation is great and general,
yet not confused.
and several conditions, for as the Apostle says, God is the author of peace
and order, and not of confusion and deformity, confusion and such like were
never made by God, but crept in by Satan's malice, and man's corruption, and
upon the fall came into the world as breaches and blots of Gods order set among
creatures: 1. Cor. 14.33.
now wherefore did the Lord (for that is chiefly to be known) dispose things
created into several places and conditions? Surely that there might not only
be a comely proportion and correspondency of one creature with another among
themselves; but that all might serve distinctly in their several places and
order, for the use and good of man: for as the Lord himself says, he
prepared the earth, he created it not in vain, Isay 45.18.
he formed it to be inhabited, I am the Lord, and there is no other. God
said, Gen 1.14.
let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to separate the day from the
night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.
After the flood: hereafter seed time, and harvest, and cold, Genesis 8.22.
and heat, and summer, and winter, and day, and night, shall not cease so long
as the earth remains: the consideration whereof should not only lead us to
see and behold the infinite wisdom of God in making so excellent a frame as
the world is, The work of creation shows the infinite wisdom of God, and
the consideration of it may strengthen our dependence on Gods providence at all
times.
but withal it may serve to strengthen our dependence at all times upon the
providence of God. For why? (consider it seriously) did the Lord before any of
us breathed in the world so distinguish and design his creatures in such
comely order, that nothing should be superfluous or wanting, but all jointly
and every one severally should serve for our use, and will he now we are
brought into the world forsake us? Certainly no; if we have hearts to rest on
his providence, he will never fail nor forsake us, we have the Lords own word
for it, Heb. 13.5.
that in quietness and content we should rest on his providence, for he has
said, I will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; and it is worthy
observation that we find Genesis 1. that the Lord created the first man upon the
earth, he made all things ready for his use, as a man that is to entertain his
friend whom he loves, he provides all things both for necessity and
pleasure, so did the Lord for man, he made the earth for him to go upon, the
heavens to cover and give light unto him, fishes, fowls, beasts, herbs, and
fruits to feed and comfort him, and he put beauty, sweetness, color,
brightness, and many other excellent qualities upon his creatures, to make them
pleasant and delightsome unto him: did the Lord this for our first parents, and
is he any changeling? no, no, with him there is no shadow of change: he
provided for Adam, and he will provide for us, if we be in Christ. Let us
consider our own coming into the world, wherein all things were ready
provided and set in order before we came, we were provided of parents, friends,
and many special comforts needful; yea let us but look upon our own
composition and making, that we have bodies furnished with members for every
good use, soule^ endued with many excellent faculties, and learn by such
testimonies of Gods love to depend on his providence.

In the next place we are to mark, that the Apostle says Christ as he is God,
could have made the meanest creature the most glorious.
and things of less glory and beauty, even things creeping on the face of the
earth: whence it is easy to be gathered, that if it had pleased God, he could
have made the meanest creature the most glorious, even a stone upon the ground
a star in the sky, and a worm an Angel: for what was the cause that the
creature was made a stone, and not a star? even the good pleasure of the
Lord, nothing else, no other reason can be rendered: Psalm. 135.6.
the Lord is great above all Gods, and has done whatsoever he would in heaven,
Romans 9.20.
and in earth, in the Sea, and in all the depths: though the words be spoken by
way of similitude in the case of predestination, to illustrate and make it
plain, that we ought not to ask a reason of it, but to rest in the will and
pleasure of the Lord; yet take them as a proper simple speech and standing by
themselves, and then they serve to silence the creature, that it ought not to
demand a reason why it was made of this order or fashion, but to rest in the
good pleasure of the creator: shall the thing formed say to him that formed it,
why have thou made me thus? as if he had said, it were too great boldness for
the creature so to reason with the Creator; let it rest in his will and
pleasure. The ground of this truth is, because the actual power of God is
equal to his will, Note.
his absolute power reaches beyond his will, he by his absolute power can make
of stones bread, or children to Abraham, but his actual power reaches no
further then his will.

Is it so that Christ if so it had pleased him, could have We are not to
deprave or abuse the meanest creature
then we are to esteem of the meanest things in the world, and not to deprave
and abuse them, as we do many ways, but most wickedly when we swear by
them, for then as much as lies in us, we advance them to the throne of God. It
is our Saviors argument, Mat. 5.36.
that we must not swear by our heads, because they are his creatures, and not
ours, we are not able to make one hair white or black. But I will not
further stand on that: let us by this be led forward to consider that Christ,
as he is God, is able to use the meanest and Christ as he is God can use the
meanest and weakest creatures to ouermaster the strongest.
as he could in the first creation of all things have made the meanest creature
the most glorious, so doubtless he can give power at his pleasure to the
weakest to match and overcome the strongest. We find in the book of Exodus that
he dealt with hard hearted and rebellious Pharaoh by frogs and lice, and such
like mean and contemptible creatures: it had been as easy for the Lord, when
he turned dust into lice, to have turned it into Lions, Bears, Wolves, and
beasts of exceeding greatness and cruel fierceness; but he rather chose to
confound pride by weakness, that his power might more appear, and to show
that he is able at his pleasure to make the weakest creature to conquer and
bring down the pride and power of the strongest. And to press this a little
further, let us think of it to this purpose: and if the Lord can make such
mean creatures, as frogs, lice, and flies, too strong for a mighty kingdom,
what resistance then can any silly man or woman make against the Lords wrath,
if they pull it upon them by their sins? his wrath can arm all the creatures
in heaven and earth against us, and give power to the least of them, to a fly,
an hair, or the like, far above any power of ours. Who then as the Prophet
says, Nahu. 1.6. can stand before his wrath, or who can abide the fierceness
of his wrath? his wrath is powered out like fire, and the rocks are broken by
him. Let hard hearted and impenitent sinners think upon it, that the Lord Jesus
Christ could (if it had pleased him) have made a silly worm a glorious Angel,
and he can use the meanest creature to bring down the power of the strongest,
he can arm all creatures against us. Let us therefore learn to tremble before
him: shall we provoke him to anger, and not bring confusion upon our selves? he
is a mighty creator, therefore able to bring infinite punishments upon us at
his pleasure. It is the exhortation of the Prophet, Amos 4.12 Prepare to meet
thy God oh Israel, and he builds his exhortation upon this very ground, for
lo he that forms the mountains, and creates the winds, and declares
unto man what his thought is, which makes the morning darkness, and walks
upon the high places of the earth, the Lord of hoasts is his name: as if he had
said, God is able to create the winds, to form the mountains, to alter the
course of nature, to make the morning darkness, therefore he is able to make
an eternal judgment for thy confusion; be therefore admonished to prepare to
meet this mighty God. For the conclusion of this point, Luke 20.18.
remember Christ his own speech, that whosoever shall fall upon him shall be
broken, and on whomsoever he shall fall, he shall grind him to powder.

Now to the second difference of things created in respect of quality, things
visible and invisible, that is to say, things corporeal, bodily substances,
subject to sight and other outward senses: and incorporeall, such as consist
not of a gross, Interpretation.
palpable, and visible matter, but have a pure, subtle, and spiritual
substance, as Angels and the souls of me^, which are creatures really
subsisting, but not to be perceived by any outward sense, that is the meaning
of the Apostle, I might stand here to show that Angels are substances, and
though they be invisible and and spiritual, yet they have a real being, and
have life motion and understanding, but I hope none amongst us are of the
Sadduces mind, who said there was neither resurrection, Acts. 23.1.
neither Angel nor spirit. But that they were only qualities or good motions
of the mind. Or that think as the like times did, that Angels or spirits good
or bad, were nothing but good and bad success. I will therefore go no further
then the naming of that point: and note we from these words briefly this, that
seeing the holy ghost made choice of this distinction of things created in
respect of quality, that some are visible and some invisible, we are therefore
to hold it as a true difference of things, It is a true difference of things,
that some are visible and some invisible. 1. Cor. 15.53.
yea such a distinction

If any further object that 1. Cor. 15.44. Ob.
their bodies shall be spiritual,

Again, we are there to understand (spiritual) opposed, not to visible, but
to natural, that is pure and free from heaviness of earthly matter, and not
standing in need of natural meane^ of nourishment or sustentaeion by meats
drinks, sleep and such like, they shall be spiritual thus understood, but
yet visible as the body of Christ, and to this end I note this to show how
cross the Papists are to this distinction made by the holy Ghost, they make
the body of Christ a visible creature invisible, and say it is the Sacrament
really present, and yet not to be seen, again they make visible forms of
Angels which are spiritual substances and invisible, and not to be resembled
by any outward forms, thus they confound things distinguished plainly by the
holy Ghost.

Confutation of the papists.
The Apostle here insisteth in one sort of invisible creatures, thrones or
dominions, principalities or powers. Though evil Angels be sometimes thus
called as Ephesians. 6.12. yet that good Angels are here meant by the Apostle it
is agreed upon by the best interpreters, Interpretation.
ancient, and of latter times; and upon good ground because so to understand
the words, is consonant to the scope of the Apostle in this Epistle, which was
to show that Christ is to be worshipped and not Angels, as the false Apostles
taught, cap. 2. 18. the good Angels are called by these names, not as by titles
of order and degree as the Papists affirm, who in this point of foolish
curiosity in setting down the orders of Angels, have gone so far as they
have lost themselves, as in a maze, for though it cannot be denied but that
there is order among the Angels, order being a most excellent thing, yet that
these be titles of order can never be proved. August^e says, what difference
there is between these 4. words, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers:
let them tell us that be able, so they prove that they tell us, for my part,
(says he) I confess I know it not, we are not then to conceive of these
words as signifying several orders and degrees of Angels, but as set down by
way of similitude to signify both the glory and office of the good Angel, by
whom Christ does execute, and perform many great and wonderful works, as it
were by Kings, Rulers, Princes and Potentates, for the Apostle does set down
these titles of dignity and office, in the abstract, for the concrete meaning
by Thrones, as it were Kings, Rulers, Princes or Potentates, thus then are we
to conceive the words of the Apostle, as if he had said, even the good Angels
were created by Christ, who are both most glorious creatures, and used by him
to perform many great and wonderful works, by what name soever ye call them,
whether ye conceive them under the name of Kings or Rulers. Princes or
Potentates.

Now, here first we are to mark, that the Apostle speaking of the creation of
Angels, he says not in plain terms, that invisible things were created by
Christ, even Angels; but he uses these borrowed speeches, Thrones, Dominions,
Principalities, Powers, he sets them down by way of similitude, comparing
them to the highest dignities and glories in the world, as Governors are
called Iud. 8 And that in the abstract, whence it follows, The good Angels
are most excellent creatures.
that the good Angels are most excellent creatures, earthly Kings, Princes and
Potentates in their greatest pomp, and glory of their Thrones, are but
shadows of the good Angels, and for further proof of this, we shall find
that the Scriptures speak of them, as of the excellency of all creatures, yea,
when the greatest glory and praise belonging to any inferior creature is
spoken of in Scripture, the speech is then taken from the glory of Angels, a
when the woman of Tekoah, 2. Sam. 14.17.
was to commend the wisdom and knowledge of David, she says, My Lord the
King is even as an Angel of God, in hearing of good and bad. Psalm. 7 8.25.
Thus Manna is called Angels food, that is most excellent food, that if Angels
should need food, it were fitting for them. 1. Cor. 13.1. though I should
speak (says the Apostle) with the tongues of Men and Angels, his meaning is,
if had the most excellent and eloquent tongue that possibly could be, thus
then the greatest glory and excellency of any creature being set out by speech
drawn from Angels, it must needs be that they are most excellent, yea, it is a
part of Gods glory, to have attendance of Angels, and it shall be a part of our
glory after the resurrection to be like to them, therefore they doubtless are
most excellent creatures.

The excellency of Angels must lead us to see the glory of Christ their
creeator and so in other things.
Surely thus, we are thereby to be led on, to see the glory of Christ their
Creator, for if these creatures be so glorious, how glorious then is he that
made them, we are not to rest in the beauty and excellency of the creature,
but to rise up, and ascend by that, and from that, to the glory of the
Creator, and thus must we do in all things of any excellency; when we see men
excel in rare gifts, of beauty, strength, goodly proportion of body, in
wisdom, knowledge and such like, we are not to rest in these things, but by
them must be brought to see the glory, power and infinite wisdom of the
Creator: yea, when we find knowledge and understanding of good things in our
selves, we are not to rest upon them, but to be carried up from our knowledge
and understanding to the giver of them, for what have thou, that thou have not
received from the Father of lights, which is a thing needful to be urged in
these days, wherein many men having good gifts, do rest too much in their
gifts of knowledge and understanding, as appears in the Brownists, Familists
and others, for doubtless, one special cause of their continuance in their
erroneous opinions, Note.
is their too much resting upon their own knowledge: whereby, in the just
judgment of God, they fall into the snare of pride and high conceit of their
understanding and knowledge, and make to themselves an idol of their own
understanding, a thing very dangerous and hard to be cured, for he that does
rest upon his own opinion, and though he err, yet holds his error for a
certain truth, by whom can he be cured? how will he submit himself to any
man's judgment? when he takes it not to be so good as his own, if the eye of
the soul, the understanding wherewith it ought to see and discover the pride
of it self, if that be full of the same pride, who then can cure it? therefore
we are to take heed, we rest not upon our own knowledge, and our own
understanding, least the Lord gives us up to pride, and to an high conceit of
it, and so we be come incureable in some erroneous opinion, but let us be
carried up from our excellency in any kind, to the author and giver of it,
and that will make us more humble in in our selves and thankful to God.

In that, the Apostle sets out the good Angels by Thrones, Dominions,
Principalities, The good Angels are as good Kings and Princes in the common
wealth. 1. Tim. 2.2.
Powers, we are further taught, that they are as good Kings and Princes in the
commonwealth, and that as good Kings and Princes are set up by Gods
providence, for the good and comfort of the good and godly, and for the
punishment of the wicked, to take vengeance on evil doers, so the good Angels
are appointed for the good and protection of the good and godly, and to execute
Gods vengeance on such as be wicked; a point easily proved in both the
branches of it. For the first, Heb. 1. last verse, they are said to be
ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for their sakes which shall be
heirs of salvation, Psalm. 34.7.
the Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that fear him, and
delivers them. For the second, we find that they as instruments of the
wrath of God, destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, they plagued Egypt with the death
of the first borne, they slew in one night, one hundred foure-score and five
thousand in Senacheribs host; 2. King. 19.55.
of this point we may make the same use the Apostle does of the power of
Princes and lawful Governors among men, will thou (says he) be without fear
of the power? do well: Romans 13.34.
so shall thou have praise of the same: for he is the Minister of God for thy
wealth, but if thou do evil, fear: for he bears not the sword for naught:
For he is the Minister of God, to take vengeance on him that does evil. So in
this case it may be said, will thou be without fear of the power of Angels,
The power of Angels is for the comfort of such as do well, and for the terror
of the wicked.
they then rejoice, yea, then they have a charge laid upon them by the Lord, to
use their power, to watch over thee, to keep thee, Psalm 91.11. Yea, thou shall
find the comfortable effect of their ministry, certain, though the
manifestation of it be not ordinary, as they ministered to Christ in his
temptation, agony and resurrection; so thou shall find, they will minister to
thee in all thy troubles, yea, thou shall find their protection over thee, if
the Lord see it good for thee, in common calamities and miseries, we read
Ezechiel 9.4. that a mark was set on them, that mourned in Jerusalem, for all
the abominations that were done in that city, that they should not be swept
away, in the common calamity of that city: So then being sealed by the spirit
of Christ, and sprinkled in thine heart by the blood of Christ, if it be good
for thee, thou shall be called out from the wicked, the destroying Angel shall
not touch thee, thou shall not be swept away in a common calamity, which is a
matter of excellent comfort. On the contrary, if thou be wicked and profane,
and have no care to keep in the ways of God, then know, the Angels have not
their power in vain, but at all times are ready to execute Gods vengeance upon
thee. It follows, All things were created by him and for him. These words are
a repetition of the general proposition, delivered in the beginning of this
verse. For the meaning of them only, call to mind that they are thus to be
conceived: That by the substantial power of Christ, working together with the
Father and holy Ghost, were all things that were not before fremed and made of
nothing. This repetition as others in the Scripture is not idle or superfluous,
but for special causes; First to signify that the Apostle had not spoken
rashly, but advisedly. Secondly, that the point delivered is an infallible
truth, that all things indeed without exception, were made by Christ, as we
have it, Ioh. 1.3. and without it was made nothing that was made. Thirdly, we
are to observe and remember this as fundamental point of religion.

The point hence to be obscrued is this: That seeing it The Lord doubling his
speech, we are to double our attention.
it must teach us to double our attention and consideration of the thing
delivered, for where the holy Ghost has a tongue to speak, we must have an
ear to hear, and an heart to consider, and he doubling his speech for the
more certainty, as the dream was to Pharaoh, Genesis 41.32. to signify that the
thing was established by God, our attention and consideration of it, must be
answerable, we are therefore not lightly to pass over, but seriously to The
work of creation is seriously to be considered.
it is one of our Sabboths days duty, if ye ask to what end. I answer, That
we may not only see the wisdom and power of God, but with David be brought
to see his infinite goodness and mercy toward man, Psalm. 8. when I behold
thine heavens, Psalm. 8 3.4.
even the works of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou have
ordained. What is man, that thou should vouchsafe him so great mercy. And in
that the holy Ghost does sometimes repeat the same thing.

We may further make use of it in this manner. When it pleases the Lord to
reiterate, and again to repeat his threatening of judgment, and when he does
stir up, and Threatenings of judgment against sin repeated, must not be
lightly regarded.
and that with vehemence to beat upon the same sin, we are not lightly to
regard those his threatenings, and to think the repetition of them idle and
vain, but to confider the infallible and inevitable certainty of his wrath to
come upon refractary, stubborn and hard hearted sinners, for shall the Lord
speak the word, and shall not he be as good as his word? shall he that is Lord
of heaven and earth threaten judgments, and that again, time after time, and
many times in patience expecting our repentance, and shall not he at length
(if sinners be not thereby moved) bring his threatened judgments upon them?
yes certainly, they are his own words, Leuit. 26.23.
that if they walk stubbornely, against him, he will then smite them seven
times, he will pay them home at last. And know it for truth, that if the Lord
often by his Ministers denounce judgments against any sin, be it
drunkenness, swearing or any other, if men snort and sleep in that sin,
which by the direction of Gods spirit, is often hit upon, and still go on in a
damnable course, in dullness of mind, and hardness of heart, the Lord
himself will then start up, and revenge his own contempt upon them, for then
the sin is grown to a ripeness, Note.
that is the immediate forerunner of judgment, and then is the sin
remediless, 2. Chro. 36.16. it is said ver. 15. the Lord sent to his by his
Messengers, often calling them to repentance, but they mocked the Messengers of
God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, until the wrath of the
Lord arose against his people, and till there was no remedy, says the text:
How often would I (says Christ) have gathered thy children together, Mat.
23.37.
as the hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not, but now
your habitation shall be left desolate. When sinners have many times been
admonished, and never amend, then their sins bring judgments without remedy,
and let all unfeeling hearts think upon it, and take heed how they tempt the
Lord over long.

Come we to the last words, And for him. In these words is laid down the
second argument, by which the Apostle proves Christ to be eternal God,
because all things were made for his glory, and that is the meaning of the
words, for though we have heard it before delivered, that all things were made
for man, yet we are not so to understand it, as for the glory of man, but for
as inferior end of the creation, and for the glory of Christ, as he is God,
and so the chief Lord of all things.

Christ as God is the perfection of glory in himself,

Things created serve not to add any thing to the essence of Christ his glory,
The heavens declare the glory of God, Psalm. 19.1.
and the firmament shows the work of his hands. Thus all things created
serve for the glory of Christ.

In that the Apostle says, the end of the creation of all Gods glory must be
the highest end of all our actions.
we are taught that the glory of God must be the highest end of all our
actions, and whatsoever we do we must make his glory our principal end, and
that this duty does follow from the words of the Apostle, I make it plain
thus, it being the principal end of things created, it must also be the
chief end of the actions of those things, or else things only idle and not
working, should have reference to Gods glory; and the Lord should have made
things only doing nothing to serve for his glory, which is most absurd once to
think: therefore our bodies and souls being made for Gods glory, all the
actions of them both must tend to the same end, it is the conclusion of the
Apostle agreeable to this. That whether we eat or drink, 1. Cor. 10.31.
or whatsoever we do, it must be done to the glory of God: again, all actions
must tend to some good, or else they are not good. Now the glory of God is the
chiefest good, it is put for the goodness of God it self, Romans 9.23.
and it is the whole joy and felicity of the Saints and Angels in heaven, to
glorify God, they are so ravished with the love of it, that they never wax
weary in sounding forth the praise of God: they cease not day nor night
saying, holy, holy, holy, Revel. 4 8.
Lord God almighty, which was, and which is, and which is to come.

Reproof of those whole labor and actions are to the dishonor of God.
that is, our duty, a duty indeed little thought on by many in the world,
many there be, who are so far from making the glory of God the chief end of
al their actions as that their lives and actions are nothing else but a
continual dishonouring of the Lord, they are so loose in their lives, and so
given over to follow the corrupt lusts of their own hearts, as they cannot
abide any that will not pour out themselves to the same excess of riot, or at
least allow of it, they hate none more then such as go about to reform them;
let such persons know that they are like the Devil and damned in hell, for it
is the practice of the Devil without ceasing, to belch out blasphemy against
God himself, and to labor to make others dishonor his name, and as they are
like the Devil in the practice, so (without true repentance) they shall be
like him in punishment, yea their own bodies and souls shall one day witness
against them, for in them are imprinted such lively characters of Gods wisdom,
power, goodness and mercy, that do so plainly preach to them the glory of
God, as they cannot blot out the marks of it, in the parts of their bodies,
and the powers of their souls, but being used by them in their actions to the
dishonor of his majesty, they shall be so many witnesses against them, when
the Lord Jesus shall come to judgment. Let them think upon that.

We are to take heed of seeking our own glory in doing of good things.
and take we heed that sin do not insinuate and creep within our best
actions our hearing of the word, our prayers and giving of alms the discharge
of our public office and function, etc. I know we cannot but sin in our best
actions, but my meaning is, we are to labor against the sin that is contrary
to the duty now laid before us, and that is vainglory when men do not good
things in simplicity of heart, aiming at Gods glory principally, but seek
their own private glory; and aim at the applause and commendation of men, a
sin that cannot easily be discerned, it is a branch of inward pride, I
therefore leave the examination to every man's conscience, let that tell every
one whether he do good things in simplicity of heart, aiming principally at
Gods glory, or whether in the doing of them he seek his own glory, I will
labor to dissuade from that sin, and to that purpose consider these two
things.

First, Reason Against seeking our own glory in doing good things.
there is no soundness of religion in the heart where there is a secret seeking
of a man's own glory, that man that makes it his chief end of good actions to
be spoken of and admired, does thereby make known that his heart is not sound.
How can ye believe which receive honor one of another, John 5.44.
and seek not the honor that comes

Again, we shall find that though other sins have bin Genesis 11.4.
yet when they came to build to get them a name: they were confounded in their
devises, Nebuchadnezzar a wicked king no doubt, was suffered to go on in many
other sins, yet when he thought with the majesty of his person and palace to
outface the Lord, Acts 12.
he became a silly and miserable beast. Herod had long vexed the Church, yet
went unpunished, till taking to himself the glory of God, then was he eaten
up of worms. And if any think these examples of an higher degree of sin,
then is the secret seeking of applause amongst men, let him know, that even
that is a robbing of God of his due honor, and the Lord is not only careful,
but as I may say curious, or as the Scripture speaks, jealous of his glory,
he cannot abide it should be any way touched or impaired, surely I will not
give my glory unto another: therefore they that incroach upon it in the least
measure cannot escape the judgment of God, Isay 48.11.
if then we would not discover the unsoundness of our hearts, if we would not
endanger our selves, suddenly to be overtaken by the hand of God let us take
heed we give no place in our hearts when we are performing good duties, 1.
Sam. 2.30.
to a secret seeking of our own glory, but in sincerity aim at Gods glory,
and remember for a conclusion of this, what the Lord has said: they that
honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be despised.

All creatures must be used to the glory of God.
it follows upon that, that they are to to be used, for that end the Lord
intended in making creatures, must be driven at in the use of the creatures.
How then can the Papists excuse themselves, for their hallowing (as they call
it) but indeed charming of bread, water, salt, spittle and such like, to
Confutation of the Papists.
no surely, it is a mere profanation of the name of God, an abusing of his
creatures, to the derogation of the infinite merit of the precious blood of
Christ, and that is an high degree of sin.

VER. 17. And he is before all things, and in him all things consist.
In this verse are propounded two things. First a repetition of two general
things affirmed of Christ verse. 15. that he is the first borne of every
creature in these words. And he is before all things; then a third argument to
prove Christ to be true eternal God, taken from his powerful preservation of
all things, in the words following. And in him all things consist; of these
words in order.

And he is before all things, these words being only a repetition of that
which before was delivered, that he is the first borne of every creature, are
so to be conceived, as before I showed when I stood upon these, words, that
Christ was begotten of the substance of his Father from all eternity: and now
to derive hence some further point of instruction, we are to mark that the
Apostle in the 15. verse, speaking of the eternity of Christ sets it down by
way of similitude and borrowed speech, because as then I noted, we are not able
to comprehend it, but by way of shadow and resemblance, now here he delivers
the same thing in more plain terms that he is before all things, to this end
without question, to take away all doubtfulnesse, ambiguity and error that
might be occasioned from the former similitude. The point I hence gather is
this;

That whatsoever is necessary to be known and believed All things needful to
be known and believed to salvation are plainly set forth in the Scripture:
is in one place of Scripture or other plainly set forth and easy to be
understood of all them that read diligently, mark attentively, pray heartily,
and judge humbly, we shall find, that where any thing necessary to be known to
salvation is delivered by trope or figure, or any thing obscurely, the same in
another place is explaned, to insist in one or two places, circumcision is
called the covenant and in the next verse the sign of the covenant: the
Paschall lamb is called the passover, Gen: 17.10. Exo. 12.11.21. 1. Cor. 10.4.
and verse the 27. the sacrifice of the Lords passover. Christ is called a
rock, yet a spiritual rock by way of exposition, and so that trope in the
institution of the Sacrament of the Lords supper, so much abused by the
papists, as the ground of their transubstantiation is expounded both by our
Savior and his Apostle Paul, 1. Cor. 11.26.
and made plain to them that are not wilfully blind, for when our Savior said,
do this in remembrance of me, and the Apostle, as often as ye shall eat this
bread and drink this cup, ye show the Lords death till he come, they do
plainly declare that bread and wine be memorials and visible signs of the body
and blood of Christ.

Is it so, Scripture is the best expounder of Scripture.
set down obscurely in one place of Scripture, is made plain in another, then
we must needs grant that the Scripture is the best expounder of Scripture, and
that we commonly give to a man of ordinary understanding, that he is Optimus
sui interpres, the best expounder of his own meaning, may not be denied to
the wisdom of God revealed in his word, we must needs grant that the best
way of expounding Scripture, is by Scripture it self, and that this point may
tend to some special profit of every one of us. Note.
Learn we hence, that the application of one place of Scripture, must be with
the consideration of another, we are so to apply one place of Scripture to our
selves, as that we forget not another; for if we observe it, we shall find
that the Devil does this way strongly delude and deceive a great number in the
world, he makes them not rightly apply, but hold to themselves some places of
Scripture helping them forward (by their abuse of them) in their sin with
utter oblivion and forgetfulness of another place, that might pull them back
from their sin, we may see this his dealing in one particular, in the sin
of presumption, men are bold to sin, presuming on Gods mercy, and he will
furnish them, with the remembrance of many comfortable places of Scripture, as
Psalm. 103.8. the Lord is full of compassion, and Psalm. 136. throughout that
his mercy endures for ever, and Psalm. 145.9. that his mercies are over all his
works, and makes them to entitle themselves to a number of such sentences,
sounding nothing but mercy, and thus he does carry them up as with a Psalm of
mercy, to the highest pitch of presumption, and makes them as it were, lay
violent hands, on the comfort found in these places, as if it did belong to
them, never remembering to apply these together, with that rule of the Apostle,
setting down to whom mercy belongs, Gal. 6.16.
we must take heed of this manner of application of Scripture, there being a
sweet harmony and consent between the places of scripture, they must be
expounded one by another, and applied one with another, for if that be a truth
(as indeed it is) that in comforting the distressed, the promise alone must not
be applied, but tempered with the threats of the Law, because much guile is in
the heart of man, and it is exceeding deceitful, then much more, out of that
case of distress, are we to apply to our selves the comfort of one place of
Scripture, so as we forget not the moderation of it, by another wherein there
is either a rule or threatening to keep us from presumption, we shall find this
practiced by Christ himself, the best example for imitation; we read Math.
4.5.6. When he was tempted to cast himself down from a pinnacle of the
temple, that temptation was backed by a comfortable place of the Psalm. 91.
Psalm. 91.11.12
He will give his Angels charge over thee, and with their hands they shall lift
thee up: l^st at any time thou should dash thy foot against a stone. Our
Savior did not rest on the consideration of that place alleged, and answer
the Devil as he might, that he played the Devil and left out that which made
against himself, the limitation of the Angels charge, that they must take
charge of him, not if he should come down headlong, but using the ordinary
means of descending, thus he might have answered that place alone, but to
answer the Devil (which is the thing we are to mark) out of the Law, which is
always a cooler of presumption, he said unto him, it is written again; Thou
shall not tempt the Lord thy God. Thus are we to apply the comfort of one place
of Scripture, with the remembrance of the mitigation of it by another; for
otherwise that which should be our life, will through our corruption become our
bane, and that which should minister matter of comfort to salvation, will be a
means of encouragement to sin with boldness, to our utter ruin and
destruction.

I come to the second thing, which is a third argument, Interpretation.
proouing Christ to be God, in the words following (and in him all things
consist) the words are briefly thus to be conceived, that by the powerful
hand of Christ, all things created, are preserved in their essence and state,
and sustained in their substances, quantities, qualities, motions, and actions,
so as if he should withdraw his hand they would all perish and come to
nothing, hence he is said to bear up all things by his mighty word, Heb. 1.3.
and to be with his Father, as nourisher of all things, Prou. 8.30. for we must
not understand this, and the like places (as I have often noted) exclusiuely,
as shutting out the providence of God the Father, and of the holy Ghost, but
that he together with the Father, and holy Ghost, does powerfully preserve all
things: now here, first we are to mark the argument of the Apostle, that he
proves Christ to be true and eternal God by the work of preservation, as
before by the creation, that he is the preserver of all things, and therefore
God. Whence it follows that the preservation Preservation of all things in
their essence and state is by the mighty ^ower of of God. 1 Pet. 4.19.
for else the argument had not been good, that is, Christ is the preserver of
all things, and therefore God. Unless preservation be a proper and peculiar
effect of the powerful hand of God, and consider we the ground of this given by
the Apostle, that God is a faithful creator, he did not only make the
heavens, and the earth, and all things in them, and so leave them as workmen
leave houses, as soon as they have made them they take away their hands from
them; but he is a faithful and careful creator, and does sustain things
created, and his hand is still with the work that he has made, and he holds
it up continually: the preservation, as well as the creation of al things, is a
proper effect of his power.

We must not rest in the means of their preservation.
as meat, drink, and such like: but we must see, behold and acknowledge in
them the powerful hand of God to sustain us and that he works by them, and
not they without him. Learn we to see in bread, the staff of bread, as the
Lord himself calls it, that is, the strength and power to nourish, which
comes from the Lord, Leuit. 26.26.
and is given and taken away at his pleasure; we shall find the Lord does
many times teach men this duty by their own woeful experience, I mean such as
are unmindful of this duty, that when they see not God in the bread which they
eat, he makes them pine away in the midst of their plenty, the means
vouchsafed have not power to do them good, and all, because they secretly
ascribe that to the means, which they cannot have except the Lord bless them,
we therefore are to learn our duty, namely this, not to rest in the means of
our preservation, but to see and acknowledge the powerful hand of God in them,
to do us good. Now for further use of this point, here comes a question to be
scanned, that seeing, our preservation in regard of being and state, is by the
mighty power of God, and we find in the Scripture, that some have been
preserved in respect of body, by the powerful hand of God, extraordinarily, as
Moses in the Mount, Daniel in the Lions den, Eliah forty days and forty
nights, with a course cake and pot of water.

The question may be,

I answer therefore, Daniel is cast into the Lions den, he may then expect
Angels to come and close the Lions mouths, the Scripture is plentiful in
examples of this kind, but on the other side, when ordinary means are to be
had, then it is contempt of Gods ordinance and presumption not to use them, but
to expect extraordinary help from heaven. When Elisha and his servant were
alone in Dotham, 2. Kings 6.17.
and without means of defense, then he might lawfully expect his garrison of
Angels, but verse. 32. where ordinary means were to be had, then he did not
look for such extraordinary help, but used the means offered, he shuts the
door, and bids them handle the messenger roughly, and thus this question is
answered, that when ordinary means cannot be had, then we may look for the
extraordinary, when they may be had we are to use them, yet so as we rest
not upon them, but see in them and by them the powerful working of the Lord.

The Church of Christ is preserved by his providence in special manner. Psa.
18.1.2.
namely this, in that all things are preserved by Christ, it cannot be but that
his Church, his body, is kept and preserved by his providence in specall manner
Isay. 27.3. the Lord says he keeps his vineyard, and he will water it, and
David found such safety and security under the special providence of God as
he was not able (as it should seem) with any words to express, and therefore
he uses all these metaphors, my rock, my castle, my fortress, my buckler, my
shield, etc. Now the same God is the same castle, and shield, and fortress,
and bulwark, and deliverer from all enemies and from the Devil and his
instruments, to all them that put their trust in him for ever. Ps. 17.8. David
prayed for special defense keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the
shadow of thy wings, he prayed (no doubt) in faith with assurance that the Lord
would so keep him, and does so keep all his children, now who will not warily
keep the apple of his eye, it is the tendrest thing and that part of the body
that men are most careful of, and even as the apple of the eye does the Lord
Jesus keep his, If Christ keep us we need fear nothing.
whom need we fear, do but remember that which we have in this text, that in
him all things consist, and the motion of all things is from and by his power,
though sinful motions as they are sinful are from the wicked themselves, yet
as motions they are from the Lord, and they cannot move the least finger, but
as rhey are sustained by him, why then should we fear them? no, no, know that
the hand of Christ Jesus is with thee, thou that art a member of him) both in
life and death, yea his hand shall keep the very dust of his own, when they
are dead; let this therefore sink and settle into every one of our hearts,
that Jesus Christ is our keeper, and it will make us love him, cleave to him,
and be of good courage in the waves of the sea of this troublesome world and
fear nothing.

VER. 18. And he is the head of the body of the Church: he is the beginning,
and the first borne of the dead, that in all things he might have the
preeminence.
The Apostle having spoken in the three verses going before of the dignity of
Christ his person in respect of his deity and so proved the sufficiency of the
work of redemption wrought by him. Now he comes to speak of his dignity, as
he is God and man by personal union, and withal teaches by way of
implication, how Gods chosen are made partakers of that redemption, namely by
their union and communion with Christ, that he is their head, and they his
members: the things affirmed of Christ in this verse, setting forth the dignity
of Christ his person as God and man are three.

First that he is the head of the body of the Church.

Secondly the beginning.

Thirdly the first borne of the dead.

To which points of glory is added the end of them all in the last words, that
in all things he might have the preeminence.

Come we to speak of these, as they are laid down in order. And he is the
head of the body of the Church, the words head and body are metaphorically
borrowed from known things, Interpretation.
and do signify that relation that is between Christ and his Church, that
there is the same relation between him and his Church, that there is between
the head and the body, and that in many respects, that as the head and body are
knit together by nerves, and by the soul, so Christ and his Church are united
and knit together by the band of Faith, and the spirit, as the head has an
eminency and excellency, and the body is under in place and dignity; so Christ
has an eminency and excellency above the Church, and the Church is under him
in place and dignity, as the head gives natural life, sense and motion to the
body, and the body receives those things from the head, so Christ gives
spiritual life and motion to the church, and the church receives such life and
motion from Christ, and as the head does guide, govern and defend the body,
and the body is guided, governed, and defended by the head, so is it between
Christ and his Church.

In these things specially stands that similitude and resemblance of Christ
and his Church to an head, and the members of a natural body, and that we may
yet better conceive the meaning of the words, two questions are briefly to be
answered which serve much for the understanding of that relation, that is
between Christ and his Church, compared to an head or body.

2. Questions
First, there being in Christ two natures, the question may be in respect of
which of these two is Christ the head

Ephesians. 5.23.
as the husband is the wives head, and the same is the Savior of his body. Now
Christ is the Savior of his Church, not according to his divine nature only,
nor only according to his humane nature, but whole Christ in his Godhead, in
his soul and flesh, and therefore whole Christ is the head of his Church, and
the Church, and every true member of it, is united to whole Christ, yet in this
order: first to the flesh and manhood of Christ, and then by that, to the
Godhead, because, Note.
as there is no union of man with God, being severed from him by sin, but by a
mediator, so is there no conjunction with the Godhead of Christ, but by his
flesh in which he performed the chief works of mediation, and that for the
first question

To the second I answer, Answer to the 2. Question.
that the union whereby Christ and his Church are united, though it be a true
and real union, yet is it not natural, as two joined in one nature nor
personal, as of body and soul, nor political, as of Prince and people, but
mystical and Spiritual, by the bond of the same spirit and faith.

Now lastly, the word (Church) signifies the whole number Christ is the only
head of the universal Cathol^ke Church.
this then is the full sense and meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had
said, Christ both God and man, in respect of both his natures, is after a
spiritual manner, knit to all Gods elect, called and sanctified, and is more
eminent and excellent, they giving spiritual life and motion unto them, and
does guide, govern and defend them.

From the words thus understood we may first conclude, that Christ only is the
head of the universal Catholic Church, for though every King may in good
sense be called the head of the particular visible Church of his dominion,
which is a body distinct from the whole Church, yet of the whole Church, being
one body consisting of all the members of it, there can be but one head, and
that is Christ, because he only is knit to Gods elect, called and sanctified
by mystical union, he only gives spiritual life and motion to all the members
of the Church, yea, the Papists themselves. against whom I note this, who say,
that the Pope is the head of the Church, Confutation of the papists. Ephesians.
1.22.
in their annotations on Ephesians. 1.22. confess that the Church in no sense can
be called the body of the Pope; and therefore we may conclude, that he cannot
be the head of the universal Church, as for their new coined distinction of
head imperial, and ministerial, it is not only without warrant from the word,
but foolish, and does imply a contradiction; for to be head argues
pre-eminence, as says the Apostle in the end of this verse, and to be
ministerial argues subjection and inferiority, therefore head ministerial
can never agree to the same subject. And so I leave this point, and come to
another, in that the Apostle sets down that relation that is between Christ
and his Church, by this similitude that he is as an head, and the Church as a
body, we are taught that there is a most near union, and conjunction between
Christ and his Church, even as near as there is between the head of a man and
his body, yea more near, for the There is a most near union between Christ
and his Church.
all opposite strength and power of Hell can never be able to separate him from
his Church and members; and hence it is that the word (Christ) is put many
times for the Church of Christ, because Christ and his Church are so nearly
conioined, for all the body is one, and even so is Christ, that is the Church
of Christ, as appears in the very next verse, for by one spirit are we all
baptized into one body. 1. Cor. 12.12.
Now to Abraham and his feed were the promises made, he says not, unto the
seeds as speaking of many; Gal. 3.16.
but unto thy seed, as of one which is Christ: where the word (Christ)
signifies not only the head or mediator, God and man, but also the Church
gathered and called by the preaching of the Gospel, Ephesians. 1.2 3. the Church
is called not only the body, but the complement of Christ, this is further
manifest by another similitude used by the Apostle, namely of man and wife in
marriage, that as the Husband and Wife in carnal marriage are united most nearly
into one flesh, and are indeed till death or lawful divorce by the bond of
marriage, one flesh even so near or rather nearer (because death cannot sever
them) is the conjunction between Christ and his Church, thus the Apostle has
taught, Ephesians. 5.31.32. where he does apply the words concerning carnal
marriage, to the conjunction between Christ and his Church, for this cause
shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they
twain shall be one flesh; this is a great secret, but I speak concerning
Christ and concerning the Church.

The point thus cleared, let us come to the use; First it Strength to our faith
touching justification by Christ his righteousness imputed.
for there being that near conjunction between Christ and his Church, as is
between the head and the body, it must needs be, that the graces and benefits
of Christ do truly and really belong to all his members, and what he did as
mediator, by the covenant of grace is truly imputed unto them and made theirs
by true faith, for what is done by the head in a natural body, may truly be
ascribed to the whole body, so what Christ did as mediator, he being the head
of his Church, is truly imputed to all his members. The Papists say it is but
a fancy of an idle brain, to hold that the righteousness of Christ, and his
merits are made ours by imputation, it is all one (say they) as if we should
say, one man does live by the soul of another, and yet they say that the merit
of the good work of one member of Christ, by reason of that communion that is
between the members, may be communicated and applied to another, which I
speak, not only to show the error in the thing it self, Papists err and
differ in their own opinions.
for it is false to say, that there is any such power given to any, to merit
for himself and for other, but to let us see, how absurd, and how forgetful
they are of their own assertion, and let us leave them to vanish in their own
iarring and dissenting opinions, and let us learn to acknowledge it a certain
truth, and labor to be strengthened in the persuasion of it, as grounded on
the near union of Christ and his Church, that as many as truly believe in
Christ, stand just in the sight of God, Ephesians. 5.30.
by Christ his righteousness, even his by inherency, but ours given and
apprehended by faith. Let that suffice for the first use.

Harm done to any member of Christ, reaches up to Christ himself.
even so near as between the head and the body, then let all such as harm any
member of Christ, happily a silly man or woman in the sight of the world, let
them know that the harm done rests not upon the person harmed, but reaches
up even to Christ Jesus in heaven, as harm done to the least finger, reaches
to the head, and sometime causes the head to drop down tears: so the harm
that is done to any member of Christ reaches to him. Exodus 15.7.
Moses says the enemies of the Church rose up against God. The Lord says, he
that touches his people, Zach. 2.8.
touches the apple of his eye, and that known speech of Christ from Heaven,
may here be remembered Act. 9.4. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? in my
members, and by my members, let this strike terror and amazement to all wicked
persons, who load the members of Christ with injuries and wrongs, in word and
deed; when thou do cast disgrace and contempt, by opprobrious terms, upon
a silly man or woman, believing in Christ; thou do it to Christ his head in
Heaven, and know that thou might as well spit in the face of Christ
himself; and a man will not suffer the least member of his body to be pinched
if he can hinder it, and shall Christ to whom all power is given in heaven and
earth, suffer any of his members bought with so dear a price, as his own
precious blood be wronged, and revenge it not? no certainly, such wrongs ring
in the ears of the head of the Church Christ Jesus, and will cause him one day
to come down in flaming fire, to consume them that abuse his members. Yea, it
is to be thought on and considered that the head of the Church is such an
head, as does know not only the wrongs done to his members, Note.
but the secret intents of mischief also, and the very purpose of evil
against any of them, for he is not only man, but God also, a searcher of the
secret thoughts of all hearts, let not then any man-thinke that he can wrong a
member of Christ so secretly, as that the wrong done, shall be smoothered in
the place where it is done, and never come to light, for why, it mounteth up
above the sun, even to Cnrist in Heaven, yea, he sees and knows thy malice
against any of his members, lurking in the depth and bottom of thy heart, it
is a corruption as old as Caine, to hide, cloak and shadow cankor and malice,
and to think that it reaches no further than a man's own bosom, but we are
to know, that it reaching to a member of Christ, though not in act, but only
in thought, it reaches to Christ, and is not only seen and known of him,
but it touches him, and he has a feeling of it, and without repentance and
change of mind and affection, he will punish it as intended against himself;
let this be thought on and remembered of all those that wrong their brethren, in
the secret thought of their hearts: it may be, and I make no question of it,
but many men and women never thought of this, that their secret malice reached
so high as heaven, let us now therefore learn it, and for conclusion of this
point, remember what the Lord says to Abraham, Genesis 12.3.
I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee: all that
truly believe in Christ, have him a friend to themselves, blessing them in
their own persons, and a friend blessing all that are friends to them, and a
foe to all false hearts, harboring and hatching mischief against them, which
is a matter of All the actual members of Christ are in special manner under
Christ.
and of dreadful terror to all that hate them.

By this relation between Christ and his Church, compared to an head and a
body, we are further taught, that all the actual members of Christ, as many as
are truly knit to him by the bond of his spirit, and faith they are in
special manner under Christ, yea, so as they are quickened by him, and have
spiritual life communicated unto them from him, as the head does quicken and
give life to the members of the body, and govern them in special manner, so
Christ in special manner does quicken and govern his members; in special
manner we need not seek far for the proof of this; let us but look back
to the last words of the verse foregoing, and consider them together with
these words, and the point will easily appear very plain: In Christ all
things generally whatsoever consist, that is, all things by his powerful hand
are preserved and sustained, his general providence is over all creatures, but
when the Apostle comes to set down what hand and government Christ has over
his Church, he says, in respect of his Church, he is as the head to his
Church, he does guide and govern it, as the head does the members, this is
also the doctrine of the Apostle, where speaking of the exaltation of Christ
raised from the dead, and set at the heavenly places, for above all
principalities and powers, and might and dominion, Ephesians. 2.20.21.22.23.
and every name that is named, not in this world only, but also in that that
is to come, he says that all things whatsoever; yea, his very enemies will
they nill they, are made subject unto him, but how? under his feet, there is
the manner of their subjection, and his Church also is made subject under him,
but how? as the body to the head says the Apostle, where we see a manifest
difference of subjection of other things, and of the Church unto Christ, and
withal, as plain a difference of that hand and government, that Christ has
over other things, and over his Church, that he has a general dominion over
other things, and that he gouernes his Church, and the members of it in
special manner, yea, so as he does quicken and give life to them, the ground
of this is, because there is the same spirit in Christ, 1. Cor. 6i 17.
and in his members, for as the Apostle says, he that is joined unto the Lord
is one spirit. The same spirit the fountain of life and grace dwelling in
Christ, and in his members, must needs quicken, sanctify and make them holy as
he is, in their measure, and as the same soul being in the head and members,
does quicken both head and members, the head as the chief seat of life and
sense, and the body as it is capable, and every member as is fit for particular
duty and function.

Now this for the use Trial and examination of our selves.
may serve as a ground of trial and examination, every one will be held as a
member of Christ, receive the Sacrament, to seal up their union with him, but
where is that conformity to Christ the head of his Church, in a measure of
holiness? where is life of Christ conuayed from him to his members by his
Spirit? where is almost that man or that woman, that can truly say with the
Apostle, I live, yet not I, Gal. 2.20.
that is in the corruption of my nature, but Christ lives in me, and in that,
I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith in the son of God, who has
loved me and given himself for me, can we persuade our selves that we are
members of Christ, and yet live as many do, the life of nature only, as they
are led by the light of nature, some think they are in good case, because they
deal truly and justly withal, and live peaceably with their neighbors,
things indeed commendable in themselves, and excellent if they come from a good
root, yet they are such as may be in natural men, mere heathen men have had
them, shall we then from these conclude that we are members of Christ? shall
any man think that he is knit to Christ, who is so far from being ordered by
his spirit in special manner, as that he is altogether guided by the inward
corruption and lust of his own heart, and by the outward temptation of the
Devil, yea, sometimes does even tempt the Devil to tempt him; it may seem
strange there should be any so given over to the corruption of his own heart,
Note.
yet such there be too many in the world, who even tempt the Devil to tempt
them, and they are such as dispose themselves to sin, such as make themselves
fit for the committing of sin, and make ready their hearts as an oven, as
says the Prophet, for example, Hosea. 7.6.
the drunkard makes his tongue fit for swearing, railing, ribald and filthy
speaking, the idle person his body fit for uncleanness, for thus to dispose
themselves to sin, is a discovering of the inward corruption of their hearts,
it is all one, as if a man should show his money to a thief, watching for his
prey in a dangerous place, or for a man to offer his naked breast to the stab
of a deadly malicious enemy, thirsting after his blood: so they offer
themselves as a prey to the Devil, and uncover their corrupt hearts in the
sight of the Devil, seeking such advantage to allure them to thrust them
through with his dart of sin. Now then can any man thus led by his own
corruption, and the temptation of Satan, yea many times (as I have showed)
tempting the Devil to tempt him, persuade himself that he is a member of
Christ? he might as well think that the shoes on his feet are parts of his
body, it is but a fancy; we are to know it for a certain truth, that as many
as are knit unto Christ, they are governed by him in special manner, and he
lives in them by his spirit. And that we may have some more special direction
in this case, and may know when we are governed by the spirit of Christ,
Notes of the infallible presence and habitation of Christ his spirit. Romans 7.24.
take these two notes of the infallible presence and habitation of his spirit.

First, a feeling of the mass and body of our own corruption, with a loathing
of it, and a desire to be delivered from it, as Paul says, O wretched man that
I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death. There was in him a
feeling and a loathing of his own corruption so is it with all them that have
the same spirit, for nature never feels corruption with dislike, but only
grace: so long as it is felt only by nature, it is followed with delight, yea,
the natural man holds it his chief felicity, when he may follow the swinge of
his own corrupt heart, and nothing grieves him more, then when that he is
crossed by some griping of an accusing and yelling conscience.

The second note of the presence and habitation of the Spirit of Christ is an
unfeigned purpose of heart to obey God in all his commandments according to
place and calling with an inclination of heart unto those commandments.
Barnabas exhorted the people of Antioch, Acts. 11.23.
Act. 11.23. that with purpose of heart, they would cleave unto the Lord. I say
an unfeigned purpose of heart, because even Pharaoh and the most wicked in the
world, sometimes when Gods hand is heavy upon them, when they are sick or the
like, they promise to amend and request others to pray for them, but yet as the
Lord himself complains, Hosea 5.4. they will not give their mind to turn unto
their God, they do it not from their heart, when they are recovered they
forget what they promised, because they promised not in truth of heart, their
promise cume not out from an hatred of sin, but rather from an hatred of the
commandment of God, and a sense of their present misery. Therefore I say an
unfeigned purpose of heart, with a ready and cheerful inclination of heart,
Psalm. 119.106.
to all holy obedience, such as was in David, a purpose bound with an oath and
a holy covenant made to the Lord to keep them from starting, I have sworn and
will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments: by these two things
found in us, we may know that we be governed by the spirit of Christ but if
these be wanting, we deceive our selves, if we think we are members of Christ,
we have then no conjunction with Christ the head of his Church, we are not
branches of the true vine but shall be cast out as unprofitable branches, and
let us tremble to think upon that which follows upon this, (namely) this,
that as in this life, John 15.6.
we have but a supposed union and conjunction with Christ, an union with him
only in our conceit, so in the life to come we shall have but an imaginary
communion and fellowship with him, and in deed and truth a final separation
from him, his Saints and Angels, and fellowship with the Devil and his
Angels, they that have not Christ their head and Savior in this life shall
have him their judge and condemner in the life to come: and they deceive
themselves who think they may live as the limbs of Satan, and yet die the
members of Christ. The next thing we The members of Christ ought to have one
heart, and one affection.
Christ is the head not simply of the Church, but of the body of the Church,
hence we are taught that the members of Christ ought to have one heart, and
one affection, to love as members of one and the same body, to be kind one to
another, and to make much one of another, we find this argument and manner of
reasoning plainly, proving this duty urged in many places of the Scripture, If
there be threfore any consolation in Christ, Phil. 2.1.2.
any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spitit, if any compassion and
mercy: fulfill my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of
one accord, and of one judgment we have the same ground of exhortation, urging
this duty, that we support one another through love. Ephesians. 4.4.
Why so? there is one body and one spirit says the Apostle, it is recorded
Act, 4.32. that the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of
one soul, the reason no doubt was this, because though they were a multitude,
yet they were all one body, and it were monstrous to have two hearts in one
body. This duty belongs to all that profess themselves members of Christ, All
that call themselves members of Christ must learn this duty to be knit together
in one heart.
as our agreement and conjunction in one nature, country, place, habitation,
law, liberty and religion, which are all of great weight to move us to mutual
love, but above all, this is of greatest weight, and most effectual that we
are members of the mystical body of Christ, the very light and order of
nature, teaches the members of the same body, to love and to tender one
another: no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes
it, Ephesians, 5:29: we cannot bring instance or example of any well in his wits
that did ever hate or hurt his own body wilfully. If then the consideration of
this, that we are members of one body, move us not to love and tenderly to
affect one another, it will convince us of sin against the light of nature,
yea against the light of grace, and the supernatural light of the holy ghost
revealing unto us that we are knit together by one Spirit, one faith, one hope
of salvation, yea it will convince us of want, of love to the Lord Jesus Christ
himself, who thought not his own blood too dear for us, but testified his
love toward us by shedding of his blood to redeem us, and therefore we ought
to love him again, but if we love not one another, it is a plain evidence
against us that we love not Christ, for he has set over that love that he
requires of us in lieu of his love toward us to be answered unto him in his
members, he will have it seen how we love him, and esteem his benefits by our
love to his members, therefore he says to Peter, love thou me, then feed my
lambs, as if he had said, show thy love to me upon them, and in doing good to
them: if then we would not be convinced of breaking the order and course of
nature of repelling the work of grace, of quenching (as much as in us) the
supernatural light of the holy ghost of want of love to the Lord Jesus to whom
we owe our selves, our souls and bodies, let us be stirred to love one
another, to be kind and friendly one to another, as the members of one body,
and for conclusion of this let us remember what the Apostle has said, if ye
bite and devour one another, take heed lest ye be consumed one of another, if
ye fasten your teeth one in another, as we do when we break out into bitter
terms of railing and reuiling one another, it is all one as if a man should
bite of the flesh of his own body, and if that be odious in nature for a man
so to deal with his own flesh, let us remember that we are members of one
body, and therefore ought to love one another, and it must be far from us to
wrong one another in word or deed.

Now to the second thing here affirmed of Christ setting forth the dignity of
his person, as he is God and man, (that he is the beginning) and for the
understanding of the words, some thing must be supplied, the word (beginning)
being a word of relation, having reference to something, whereof it is a
beginning, some refer it to all things, Interpretation.
that he is the first efficient cause of all things which is true, but that
cannot so well agree to this place, because the Apostle has spoken of that in
the verse going before, but the relation of it must be to something within the
compass of this verse either to the Church or to the resurrection of the dead;
and I take it, it may most fitly be referred to the Church, the chosen of God
called and sanctified, because the Apostle speaks of the resurrection of the
dead in the next words the speech of the Apostle in the original runs thus,

Eve was framed and made of the rib that was taken out of Adams side, so the
Church is framed and made of the blood shedding and streaming out of the side
of Christ crucified, for by his blood says the Apostle, Ephesians. 2.13. Ephesians.
2.13.
They which were far off are made near, and the chosen of God have
redemption through his blood, verse the 14. of this chapter and as the Author
to the Hebrews says 10.19. by the blood of Christ they have entrance, Colos.
1.14.
and verse. 12. it is a new and a living way, it has an efficacy and power in
it-quickning and giving life.

ab initio mundi, how then is the shedding of the blood of Christ the beginning
of the Church?

Christ indeed shed his blood only then,

Now to the Doctrine, in that Christ by shedding his Out of death comes life
to Gods chosen.
we are taught thus much, that even out of death comes life to Gods chosen,
Christ gives life unto them, not by life, but by death, which is a point that
may easily be confirmed: for if we look to the Lords manner of working, not
only in this particular, but in many others, we shall find, that he commonly
works all things in his creatures by the contrary, he creates things that are,
not of something, but of nothing; he makes light shine out of darkness, he
brings water, not out of a fountain, but out of an hard stony rock; And this
the Lord does, not only in the work of creation and preservation, but also of
the conversion of a sinner; therein it pleases him to work ordinarily by the
preaching of the Gospel, which is as contrary to the nature of man, as fire to
water, for there is no seed of the Gospel in nature, but as the Apostle says,
1. Cor. 2.14 the things of the spirit are foolishness unto the natural man:
yet by the foolishnes of preaching, it pleases God to save them that believe.
1. Corin. 1.21. and thus does he also in the work of our redemption, as one
says, if we consider Christ on the cross, we shall see our paradise not in
heaven, but in the midst of hell; out of his cursed death, does he bring life
and salvation to Gods chosen.

The reason of this is, that his power might more appear and the work to his
glory,

Consolation against despair in great extremity.
be comforted and strengthened against despair in his great extremity; let
him remember it is the Lords wonted manner of working, to bring riches out of
poverty, joy out of sorrow, mirth out of mourning, glory out of shame, life out
of death, happiness out of misery, heaven out of hell; and that such is the
Lords power, that he works commonly by contraries, and withal, his mercy is
as his power toward his children, and it will be a notable means to
establish his heart with comfort in the greatest blast of trouble, yea, be it
so, that the trouble be inward in soul and conscience, that he feels the
terrors of God fighting against him, and the Lord shows tokens of his anger
and heavy displeasure, yet if ever before he truly felt the sweetness of
Gods mercy in Christ, the consideration of this the Lords manner of dealing may
stay him from being utterly dejected and cast down, and may assure him, that
even out of that trouble the Lord in his season will work his greater
consolation and comfort, I know it is an hard matter, thus to be comforted in a
man's own particular affliction, to have it in speculation and knowledge, that
out of one contrary the Lord brings another, Note.
before special trial come, is no hard matter, but when the case is our own,
and our souls feel trouble upon them, then to be persuaded, that out of that
trouble the Lord will bring comfort, and on that ground to be comforted it is
hard, because there reason is strong against it, and corruption will be
stirring, and sometimes rise up in contradiction in the best, we read Act. 9.
that Ananias would scarsely believe the Lord himself in this point, though
indeed the case was not his own, when the Lord told him verse the 11. that out
of the persecuting spirit of Paul, he had wrought an holy profession, and made
him, who before was a persecutour, an holy professor, and that out of such
infidelity, he had brought such faith, Ananias would hardly believe it, but
began to reason the matter with the Lord, verse 13. yea, to dispute and bring
arguments against it, that he had heard of many, it was Vox populi, that he
had done much evil, backed and countenanced with authority, and so he thought
it impossible, that Paul should be converted and brought to the faith, thus
does reason and corruption many times stand up in opposition, to this ground of
comfort, that out of one contrary, the Lord works another, especially in a
particular case of affliction, therefore that we may be helped, and have our
hearts established with comfort, in time of need upon this ground, we must
further call to mind, and follow that notable rule of grace, that in case of
affliction, A rule to be followed in case of affliction.
reason and feeling must be laid aside, faith must be predominant, and rule
above reason and feeling, we are not to judge of our future estate according to
our present feeling, (for then we shall persuade our selves it is desperate)
but according to the word and promise of God, who has promised then to send
help to his children, when sense tells them it is farthest off, and they are
almost swallowed up of trouble, and to this, purpose, look on the example of
the Saints of God, in former times, Psalm. 130.1. Out of deep places, says
David, David.
have I called, and when he was plunged into the deepes of distressed
conscience, he laid aside his reason and sense, and by his faith rested on
the earnest promise which made him send up earnest prayer to God: when Moses
Moses.
at the red sea, as we read, Exodus 14. was in extreme anguish, he saw present
death every way, the people cried against him verse. 11. Have thou brought us to
die in the wilderness, because there were no graves in Egypt? And no doubt,
as Luther says, he felt in his heart a mighty cry of the Devil against him,
Exodus 14.11.12.
saying; All this people shall this day perish, for they can escape no way, and
thou shall be found guilty of this great calamity, as the author of it, because
thou have led them out of Aegipt: Moses in his extremity, by his faith broke
through his own sense, feeling, and aprrehension, and cast himself by faith
on the promise, and so cried unto the Lord with assurance that he would give
him de^iuerance, thus must we do in time of our particular affliction, we must
lay aside reason and sense, and by faith rest on the promise of God, and then
this ground of comfort, that out of one contrary the Lord can fetch another,
will be truly comfortable, and we shall be fully persuaded of the truth of it,
that out of our particular affliction, the Lord will work our special
consolation, and we shall be strengthened against despair in our greatest
extremities. A second thing offered from these words, is this: In that Christ
is the beginning of his Church by the Every true member of the Church must
fetch the beginning of his spiritual life and salvation from the Cross of
Christ.


We are hence further taught: that every true member of the Church, must thence
derive and fetch his beginning even the beginning of his spiritual life and
salvation, he must be able to say, he has the beginning of his life, and
salvation, from the blood of Christ, in the very act of the shedding of it.

How is that to be done, may some say?

Romans 6.8. by being dead with Christ, Galat. 2.19. by being crucified with
Christ, and that is done by believing, not only that Christ died for him, and
by app^^hending the merit of his death, but by spreading himself upon the
cross of Christ and believing that himself was crucified with Christ, and so
feeling the power of his death to kill sin in him; a point of faith not
known to many in the world, it is a subtilty and sleight of the Devil, to
blindfold men in this case, to make them content themselves with a conceit,
(for indeed it is no true faith but a fancy) that they have true comfort in
Christ, if they believe or rather think, that Christ was crucified for them,
and yet never believe, that they were crucified with him, We must therefore
find our selves crucified with Christ.
this is not to go to the first ground of true comfort, this is to take hold
of that which happily belongs not unto us (namely) the merit of Christ his
death, which appertains to none but to his members crucified with him, if we
would find true comfort in Christ, we must not rest in the fruit and merit of
his death, but go to the very root of comfort, the blood of Christ streaming
out of his body on the cross, and there find our selves crucified with him.

If you ask how a man shall know that he is crucified with Christ?

The Apostle has taught us Romans 6.6.7. that issued out of the side of Christ,
and was framed of his blood, that is, thou must find thy self ctucified with
Christ.

The blood of Christ is a most precious thing.
it is here made the seed of the Church, from whence the Church takes her
beginning; it is the blood of God so called, Act. 20.28. it is the price of
redemption expiatory, and clensing from sin, and we must learn so to esteem
the blood of Christ, as it is in it self precious, so let us account it
precious unto us, We are to esteem the blood of Christ most precious unto us.
and they are such as make sin common, that commit sin so ordinarily, that
Christ his side must still run, when they have committed any sin and are
washed from that, and come to the Sacrament to seal up their faith in the
blood of Christ, they commit the same again, and have need of his blood to
run again, they that thus make no account of sin, they make no account of
the precious blood of Christ, and let them know it is a step to that fearful
sin spoken of Heb. 10.29. of treading under foot the Son of God, and
counting the blood of the Testament as an unholy thing.

And let us remember one thing further, that if we hold the blood of Christ
precious unto us, then we ought to have a serious and continued meditation of
it, yea, oftentimes a solemn remembrance of it, by receiving the Sacrament of
the body and blood of Christ, the Jews were to eat unleavened bread seven
days together, and shall we think that a short and perfunctory remembrance of
the body and blood of Christ only for fashion at Easter or once in a year
enough for a Christian man or woman? Exodus 12.15.
no, carry another care with thee, or else be assured it will be easier for a
Jew then for thee at the day of judgment.

Now to the the third thing affirmed of Christ, setting out the dignity of his
person as he is God and man, ( that he is the first borne of the dead, etc) the
form of speech first borne as I showed verse. 15. is Metaphorical,
Interpretation. Christ called the first borne of the dead in two respects.
the Apostle thus speaks by way of resemblance to the first borne in the old
testament. Now Christ is called the first borne with a reference (to the dead)
in a double respect.

First because he was the first that did rise from the dead, to life eternal,
though we read that Lazarus and many

Secondly by virtue of his resurrection, he is the cause of 1. Cor. 15.20.
but did also sanctify the rest of their crop, so Christ rising from the dead
has not only made holy his own resurrection, but sanctified all the
faithful to an happy and joyful resurrection.

Some may say the wicked also shall rise from the dead by the power of Christ.
Ob.


It is true indeed; Genesis 2.17.
and a judge by virtue and necessity of that sanction added to that
commandment Quo die comederis: in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall
die the death; for that decree comprehends not only death temporal, but
eternal; therefore the wicked must needs rise to condemnation, that their
bodies may be punished with their souls, yet by the power of Christ as he is
God, and not by virtue of his resurrection; he by virtue of his resurrection
is the cause of the resurrection of his members only, this then is the meaning
of the Apostle, that Christ was the first that did rise from the dead to life
eternal, and by virtue of his resurrection, he is the cause of the
resurrection of all his members.

Now here we are to observe, that the Apostle says not, Christ is the first
that did rise from the dead, but that he is the first borne of the dead, which
form of speech does the places that now hold the bodies of the Saints departed
shall not hold them for ever.
it is but as the womb of a fruitful mother, as the earth brought forth the
body of Christ the first borne; so in the time that the Lord has appointed,
even at the consummation of all things it shall bring forth the bodies of the
Saints, as a mother does her child of whom she trauells in due season, the
bodies of the Saints buried in the dust or in any other place shall be yielded
up, and shall rise again at the time the Lord has appointed, we find that the
holy Ghost uses this manner of speaking comparing the resurrection to a birth
or bringing forth in many places of Scripture: we have it in the same words
that here are used, that Christ is the first begotten of the dead, Revel. 1.5.
and Paul in his Sermon to the people of Antioch, does apply that of the
Psalmist. Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee; Acts 13.
properly spoken of the eternal generation of Christ, as he is God, to his
resurrection; and bring it to prove his resurrection: God (says he verse. 33.)
has fulfilled his promise to us in that he raised up Jesus, even as it is
written in the second Psalm, Psalm. 2.7.
thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee Luke 20, 36. the Saints raised
from the dead are called the children of the resurrection: those and the like
places, do plainly prove the point delivered that the earth, the sea, or any
other place shall one day, even at the day of judgment bring forth or as the
Prophet speaks, cast out the dead as we have it in vision, Isay. 26.19. Reu.
20.13.
the sea gave up her dead which were in her, and death and hell delivered up
the dead which were in them.

Reasons of this are many, it is grounded on the truth

Upon the justice of God which ever goes hand in hand That the dead shall rise
again is a ground of great comfort to Gods children.
this was that which held up Jobs heart in the midst of his affliction, Job
19.25. I am sure that my redeemer lives etc. Now then, that every one of us
may have profit and sound comfort by this doctrine of the resurrection, so
comfortable in it self, we must not content our selves with the bare and
general knowledge of it, some there be that make known by their lives, their
wilful and affected ignorance, or rather denial of this in the general, and
show that they hold the position of the sensual Epicure; let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we shall die, and there is an end of all. 1 Cor. 15.32.
But as many of us as are better affected, and hold it an Article of our faith,
must not content our selves to hold the truth of that Article of the
resurrection of the body, but we must labor to be assured that we our selves
shall have a ioifull resurrection, We must labor to be assured of our
resurrection.
and be raised up at the last day by virtue of the resurrection of Christ
Jesus the first borne of the dead, how is that to be done may some say? The
holy Ghost has taught. Revel. 20.6 Blessed and holy is he that has part in
the first resurrection, for on such the second death has no power: but they
shall be the Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him, there is
a double resurrection, not of the body as Chiliasts, or Millenaries dreamed the
bodies of all both good and bad shall rise at once, there shall be but one
resurrection of the body, but there is a first resurrection before the last and
general resurrection, in the time of this life, and that is in the soul, when
the soul is raised from the death of sin to the life of righteousness, Note.
and they that will be partakers of the second with comfort, must have their
part in this first; for the truth is, both the first and the second, a it is
comfortable, are proper fruits and effects of the resurrection of Christ:
Christ by his rising from the dead put away his natural life, which he
rece^ued with our nature from Adam without sin, and he took to him a spiritual
life as the Apostle says in general, 1. Cor. 15.44.
the body is sown a natural body, and is raised a spiritual body, and so
Christ the head being raised up and quickened with spiritual life, it is not
possible that he should suffer any of his members to remain in the death of
sin, there must needs be a similitude between Christ and his members; let no
man then please himself with a bare knowledge or general faith in the article
of the resurrection: if any will find true comfort in his knowledge of the
comfortable doctrine of the resurrection, he must fetch his comfort from this
ground, that he knows Christ and the virtue of his resurrection, Phil. 3.10.
as the Apostle says, that he has an experimental knowledge, a knowledge
and an experience of the power of Christ his resurrection, raising him up from
the death of sin to newness of life, whosoever binds not his comfort,
gathered from the article of the resurrection upon this ground deceiues
himself, it is but as an hungry man dreams, as the Prophet speaks, Isai. 29
8. He dreams he eats, and when he awaketh, his soul is empty: or like a
thirsty man dreameth, and lo, he is drinking, and when he awaketh, behold he
is faint, and his soul longs. So he that falsely conceiues comfort from
the doctrine of the resurrection, when the time of refreshing shall come, Acts
3.19. at the day of refreshing shall find his soul empty of all true comfort,
yea I dare be bold to tell him, that the preaching of the word, his
profession of faith, especially of this article of the resurrection, shall not
be as the Apostle does infer upon the denial of it, 1. Cor. 15.14. an idle
empty and vain thing that follows, if there were no resurrection at all, but
there being a resurrection and he houlding and confessing a resurrection of
the body and thereby falsely concluding comfort: the preaching of the word his
own profession, Note.
and his houlding of that article as a truth shall stand up in judgment and
plead against him at the day of judgment, and for conclusion of this I may
truly infer it by the rule of contraries. If on him that has his part in
the first resurrection, the second death has no power; then over him that has
not his part in it, it shall have power, the torments of Hell shall be
powerful and prevail over his body and soul for ever.

Come we to another thing offered from these words, and that is this: we are
to mark that Christ is here said to stand in relation to the dead, as their
first borne brother, he is not only the first borne of many brethren as they
are living, but the first borne of them as they are dead, whence it follows
that even the dead bodies of believers, The dead bodies of true believers are
still the members of Christ
or in any other place, are still the members of Christ, and are still knitte
to Christ, and for further light to this point mark what the Apostle says 1 Thessalonians 4 14. that believers departed, sleep in Jesus, and Romans 14 8 whether we
live or die we are still the Lords, the reasons of this

First, there is an inseparable and perpetual union between of Soul but of
body, 1. Cor. 6.15. know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ:
thy body once knit to Christ so continues for ever.

Abraham, the meaning is not that he is God of Abraham's soul only, but also
of his body, therefore the bodies of believers, although they be dead and
rotten, yet they are still within the covenant and members of Christ.



Abraham being dead in body to be raised up again, for he is a God of mercy
and of life it self, and therefore will in time restore the dead bodies of his
Saints to life again, and that is the meaning of our Savior in that place.
We see then the point proved.

For use Consolation to every true believer.


Are the dead bodies of believers within the covenant? is God even when they
are dead still their God according to the covenant? is he a friend unto them
not only in life but after death, even to their dead bodies, that their
infernal enemies shall never hurt them? though they be turned to dust and
consumed, yet does his hand still hold and keep them, in time to restore them?
of them let the comfort of this be mingled with faith in every one of our
hearts, and we shall find it will stand by us, and comfort us, when we are
gasping for breath on our death beds, and arm us against the fear of death,
and the horror of the grave, mark (I beseech you) how David comforted
himself, when he saw nothing but present death before him, 1. Sam. 30.6.
David comforted himself, says the text, in the Lord his God, mark the words,
they are full of weight, together with the apprehension of death, as he thought
inevitable, he did apprehend the mercy of the Lord in the covenant, that even
in death, he was still his merciful God, and that death could not sever him
from his God: so if the truth now delivered, be settled in our hearts (that
even the dead bodies of believers are within the covenant) it will likewise
minister matter of sweet comfort in the very pangs of death, we being fully
persuaded with the Apostle, Romans 8.38. that not death it self can separate us
from the love of God, which is Jesus Christ our Lord. Why then should we fear
the stroke of death, or the horror of the grave.

Last of all, observe with me here against a foolish cavil of the Papists,
that the Apostle calls Saints departed dead men, the Papists take exception
against us, Confutation of a Popish cavil.
that we call Saints departed dead men, when we disprooue invocation of Saints
departed, and they say, we disdainfully call the triumphant Saints in heaven
dead men, as if they had no credit with God, nor any care or compassion of men;
they may here see we speak no otherwise then the holy Ghost has taught us,
calling them dead men, not in disdain (as they charge us) but as the holy
Ghost does, as for their credit with God, and care of men, we doubt not of it,
but yet we deny them to be Mediators between God and us, that is
dishonorable to the perfect mediation of Christ Jesus.

Now to the end of these three things affirmed of Christ, and the end of them
is in the last words. (That in all things he might have the preeminence) by
the word preeminence we are to understand, Lordship, Rule and Dominion and
for the extent and largeness of Christ his rule and dominion here spoken of,
Interpretation.
it is said to be in all things, these words are diversely expounded, but the
exposition most consonant to the concext, and consenting with other places of
Scripture, I take to be this, that Christ has rule and dominion over all
reasonable creatures both quick and dead, and for this, we have warrant from
a Parallel, and like place, Rom 14 9. where the Apostle says, that Christ
therefore died, and rose again revived, that he might be Lord both of the
dead and quick: that place may serve as a fit commentary and exposition of
these words.



Peter says in his sermon Act. 2 36. that after his resurrection, God made him
Lord and Christ, because as man, he received dominion and Lordship from the
Father, which he had not before, and in this respect Christ himself says,
Mat. 28.18. All power is now given unto me in heaven and in earth, and that is
the meaning of the Apostle, Romans 13.9.
when he says, Christ therefore died, and rose again, and revived that he
might be Lord both of the dead and quick. And so the words in this place are
thus to be conceived, that over

From the words thus understood observe we in a word, that it is a prerogative
of Christ Jesus, to be Lord of quick and dead. It is a prerogative of Christ
Jesus to be Lord of quick and dead.
How then can the Papists defend their Popes supereminent power, that fullness
of power they say the Pope has over the souls of men departed (as they say)
in purgatory, to reclaim, or to loose them from thence at his pleasure, and
to open o^ shut heaven to whom he will, not to say any thing of the error of
the place, it being but a fable, how can they maintain that power of their
Pope, without incroaching upon the prerogative royal of Christ Jesus, who is
sovereign Lord of quick and dead, Revel. 1.18. Confutation of the Popes
supereminent power.
They allege that he does it by virtue of his commission, by power committed
unto him, as Christ his Deputy and spiritual Magistrate, but that is as full
of doubt as the former, and a taking of that for granted, which cannot be
proved: they must first prove the Pope received such power (which they cannot)
before thence they conclude, that which they infer upon it, or else they
build on the sand: let it suffice only to have pointed at this; That which we
are to mark, as a ground of more profitable instruction, is this: the Apostle
says not, Christ is the head, etc. that he might be Lord over all both quick
and dead, but that he might have preeminence over them: whence arises this
conclusion. That Christ is then Lord over all, when in all he has
pre-eminence: or more specially The^ is Christ our Lord when he has
preeminence over us.
when he is not only known by that title, but when he has preeminence over
us, when his power ruling us, (namely) the power of his spirit and grace is
more eminent, and does show it self above any other power, either within or
without us, when his power of grace has pre-eminence, and preuailes over the
inward strength of our corruption, and over any outward power drawing us to
sin; then is Christ our Lord, for as we know in civil matters, he is not a
Sovereign and chief Governor, who has any ouerruling and higher power above
him. So Christ is not our Sovereign Lord, if any other power ruling in us, be
above or equal to his. himself has taught us, that he is then our Lord, when
he ouerrules the strength that does stand in opposi^^o^ against him, Luke
11.22. Wheresoever he rules, he is stronger then the strong man armed, holding
possession, he comes upon him and overcomes him: he takes from him all his
armor wherein he trusted, and deuideth the spoils. Hence it is that in the
Epistle of Jude verse the fourth, he is said to be Lord and Master, or Ruler,
for so the words are in the original, which deny that only Ruler, who is
God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, these two are put together to signify that
where Christ is a Lord, he is a ruling Lord, he has sovereignty and
preeminence: I need not further to stand to prove the point, but yet for more
special direction, some may happily desire, to be informed, how they shall
know when the grace of Christ has preeminence,

First, making us to do good things willingly, cheerfully, and not of
constraint, as we are compeld by Law, either of God or man, but even so, as if
there were no Law to compel us, for the preaching of the Gospel ministers
the spirit, says the Apostle, Galat. 3.5. and the spirit of Christ, makes the
people of God, a free and a voluntary people, serving God not of constraint,
but willingly, Psalm. 110.3. The Psalmist says, thy people shall come willingly
at the time of assembling thine army in holy beauty.

Secondly, making us do good things in sincere obedience to the commandment
of God, and to the glory of Christ Jesus, that the glorious name of Christ may
be magnified in us, and by us in all good duties, Phil. 1.20. this was Paul's
hearty desire: As I heartily look for and hope that in nothing I shall be
ashamed, but that with all confidence, as always, so now Christ shall be
magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.

By these two things found in us, Trial of our selves, whether Christ be our
Lord or no.
we may know that the grace of Christ has preeminence in us, and let us
hereby try and examine our own selves, whether indeed Christ be our Lord as
we profess or no, we hold it an Article of our faith, that we believe in
Jesus Christ our Lord: now if Christ be our Lord, not in title only, but in
truth, then has he preeminence, he preuailes by his grace over the inward
corruptions of our hearts, I leave the examination to every man's conscience,
yet we must know, that this is a duty incumbent and lying upon us, that as we
profess Christ our Lord, so we ought to find the grace of Christ powerful
in us, and that this is not a thing arbitratory in different and left to us at
pleasure, but a matter of necessity, consider we these things.

First, the Apostle has said, 2. Cor. 4.3. if the Gospel be hid, it is hid
to them that are lost, so certainly much more, if Christ the matter and
substance of the Gospel be hid, if he do not appear, and show himself
predominant and powerful by his grace in our hearts, it is more then a
probable argument of perdition.

Again to profess Christ our Lord, and not to find his grace powerful in
us, is made by the Apostle, the knitting up of many great sins in one bundle.
2. Tim. 3.5. the Apostle having spoken of many gross sins, he shuts up all
in this, that they have a show of godliness, but have denied the power
thereof. To pretend Christ to be our Lord, and not to find his grace powerful
over the corruption of our hearts, it contains the guiltiness of many sins,
yea at the day of judgment it will add weight to the guiltiness of other
sins, for then a professor of Christ being found an adulterer or a drunkard
shall be challenged and condemned not only for his whooredome or
drunkenness, but for the abuse of his profession, his counterfeit profession of
religion, his profession of Christ a Lord, yet weak and without power to
ouermaster his corruption shall aggrauate and add weight to the burden of his
sin, and press him down to deeper condemnation.

If then we would not seal it up to our selves that we are such as are
appointed to everlasting perdition, and if we would not cloth our other sins
(odious enough in themselves) with more guiltines, and make them stand with
more foul and ugly faces in the sight of God, his Angels and Saints at the day
of judgment, then let us learn it to be a matter of necessity, that as we
profess Christ our Lord, so we are to find his grace powerful over us, making
us cheerful in all good duties, and to good things in sincere obedience to the
commandments of God, and so as the glorious name of Christ may be magnified.
Observe one thing further, the Apostles doctrine of our union with Christ and
of receiving life from him it ends in this, that Christ might have the
preeminence, whence it follows, in our profession of the Gospel, touching
justification, In our profession of all things to come from Christ touching
life and salvation we are to seek nothing less the^ our own glory.
to come from Christ, we ought to seek nothing less, then our own glory, in
the doctrine of the Gospel all things end in the honor and glory of Christ,
that he might have the preeminence in all things.

And again the Gospel sets forth unto us heavenly and eternal things, not
deserved by us but given of the mere grace and goodness of God, therefore in
professing the Gospel we are not to seek our own glory, and let every true
believer make this use of it, when any gift or grace of Christ in him is
magnified, let him return the glory to to the right owner Christ Jesus: We
are to yield to Christ the glory of every gift and grace that in us.
know it is not thou that art praised for any gift grace or good work, but
Christ in thee to whom all honor and praise is due, he is the head the
beginning the author and the worker of all good gifts, therefore in every good
thing commended in thee, must he have the preeminence: it is an incroaching
upon his right to take any part of the glory to thy self.

VER. 19. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
The words of this verse as they have reference to that which is immediately
premised are a proof of Christ his preeminence in all things, but they may
more fitly be conceived as standing in relation to the Apostles general
proposition laid down in many verses.

That salvation comes unto us from God the Father by his Son Jesus Christ.

And then they contain a Second reason to prove Christ his sufficiency to
redeem us and the argument is from the eternal decree and good pleasure of
his Father, that he had so decreed, that Christ should be a sufficient redeemer
which is propounded under the matter of his sufficiency (namely) all fullness
dwelling in him, that it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness
dwell and therefore he is a sufficient redeemer, and this is the connection and
general scope of the Apostle in these words. We find the sentence in the
original thus laid down, for it pleased that in him the word (father) is not
expressed, but yet that word which is here rendered (pleased) being the same
word that is used by the Evangelist Mat. 3.17. Interpretation.
to signify and reveal the good pleasure of the Father, it may well be
referred to the eternal decree of God the Father, and the sentence thus made
up (it pleased the Father) that is to say it was the decree and good pleasure
of the father, from all eternity (all fullness) by fullness we are to
understand the fullness of the Godhead spoken of chap. 2.9. because that is not
really communicated to us, but certain finite and created effects of it, and the
Apostle here speaks of such fullness as dwelling in Christ, the head is
communicated to his members, neither that fullness spoken of Ephesians, 1.23. for
by that is meant the Church: but the fullness of grace and merit according to
that John. 1.14.16. verses: the word was made flesh, etc. and (of his fullness
have all we received grace for grace, etc) the Apostle here proves the
sufficiency of the work of redemption wrought by Christ, and that by the
sufficiency and perfection of merit to life eternal: Thus then we are to
understand the words, that it was the good pleasure of God the Father, that in
Christ should dwell all fullness and perfection of grace and merit to life
eternal.

Now here much might be spoken of the necessity of Gods eternal decree,
which is the force of the Apostles argument, that the Father decreed it in his
eternal council, that Christ should be a perfect redeemer, and therefore it
must needs come to pass, and likewise here we might speak of the contingent
and necessary coming to pass of things of the necessity of coaction and
infallibility, but I pass by these things.

The first thing we are to mark is, that it pleased God to The Lord has
appointed every man's measure of gifts that he would in time bestow upon him.
We may infer upon it a general conclusion that the Lord has appointed
every man's measure of gifts, that he will in time bestow upon him of
whatsoever, whether inward or outward, for his will appointing and disposing of
all other things, it may not be excluded from the appointment and disposition
of the measure of gifts he vouchsafes to every one; to insist in one
particular in stead of many the Lord has appointed every man's measure of food
and raiment and therefore Agur, Prou. 30 8. prayed that the Lord would feed him
with food convenient or, as the words are to be understood with bread of his
allowance statute and appointment, with that bread which God in council had
allowed and appointed for him, where by the way, we see warrant for that manner
of prayer which is with condition, with reference and regard of Gods secret
will and appointment, that we may lawfully and indeed that we ought (though
some think the contrary) to ask temporary good things with condition of Gods
will, if it may stand with the good will of God that he would grant them unto
us: (but that by the way.)

Now for the use Every one must be content with his own measure of good things
vouchsafed unto him.
let every man hence learn to be contented with his measure be it never so
small for why? it is appointed of the Lord, and he in his wisdom knows what
is meet and necessary for every one, and if we be not content with our measure
vouchsefed, we take upon us to prescribe to the Lord, and we determine of
things needful for us by a leaden rule even our own blind erring and
deceiving judgment which is not able to discern what is fit and necessary. I
might urge this by many reasons, Two doubts moved and answered.
but I speak of it in the beginning of this chapter, only now I will ad the
solution and answering of 2. doubts and questions that may be occasioned from
the duty delivered.

First it may be demanded seeing we are to be content with that portion God
has cut out for us in his eternal decree for the supplying of our wants, 1.
Doubt.
whether it be lawful to pray against poverty, sickness, adversities, and wants
or no, it may seem we are rather to pray for S. Paul's gift. Phil 4 11.12.


Answ. First the proper place of contentation is after the use of the means
(namely) labor, sickness, adversities and wants simply, but for the danger of
sinning which they bring men oftentimes unto, which manner of prayer respecting
the occasional danger that attends many times on poverty, sickness,
adversities and wants through our corruption, argues no coffeehouse with the
portion allotted unto us, and so may lawfully be used, we may pray against
poverty, sickness, adversities and wants not simply, but to the end we may
better glorify God, expressing or at least including always a condition of
Gods good pleasure, and to this effect that we be never tried above that we are
able, we may observe this in that prayer of Agur, Pro. 30.8.9. Give me not
poverty nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me: verse 9. lest I be
full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord, or lest I be poor and steal,
and take the name of my God in vain.

2. Questions or Doubts.
The second question is this, whether such as get a portion of goods by theft,
usury, oppression, or any other means condemned, may find contentment in those
goods, and say with comfort, it has pleased God to bestow such a portion of
wealth upon me?





and that by the eternal decree of God, (it pleased God the Father, that in
the person of Christ should al fulness dwell, Fullness of grace is only found
in the person of Christ.
that fulness of grace should or did dwell in any Saint whatsoever. The Papists
are not able to warrant that they affirm of the virgin Mary, that she was
full of grace, though they would feign ground it on the salutation of the
Angel, Luke 1.28. for so they translate, Hail Mary full of grace, Note.
but falsely and corruptly, and that may appear by the use of the same word,
Ephesians. 1.6. and that by their own translation, wherein he has gratified us
etc. say they in that place. And the judgment of Chrysostom is clean against
them, and that with a very good reason, (...), etc. he says not grace, which
he has given us, but (...) whereby he has made us freely beloved, which is
agreeable to our translation, Luke 1.28 thou that art freely beloved. So then
notwithstanding this colored cavil it remains a true conclusion, that the
fullness and perfection of grace is not, nor has been found in any one in
this life, but in the person of Christ. What a hellish pride therefore is it of
some to be blown up so high as they dream of perfection, of inherent grace in
themselves in the time of this life.

I hope there is none amongst us of that opinion, and Finding in our selves but
small beginnings of grace truly wrought we are not to be discouraged.
that we are not to be discouraged, though we find in our selves but small
beginnings of grace, if it be true grace, for the Lord gives grace unto us,
according to the manner of our receiving, as the infirmity of our nature is
able to receive it, which is not capable of perfection, it is like a glass
with a narrow mouth, and of small capacity and receipt, and the instrument of
receiving which is faith is weak and feeble, and the Lord (as here we are
taught) has in his eternal council designed fullness and perfection of grace
in this life, only to the person of Christ. There we may comfort our selves
if any of us find but a small measure of grace truly wrought in us, Mat.
13.33. the Kingdom of heaven, says our Savior, is like leaven hid in three
peckes of meal, and Gods Kingdom is set up in the heart, upon very small
beginnings, the very beginning of grace is comfortable, if it be true grace.



penetrans and diffusiuum, peircing and of a spreading nature, if a
proportionable measure of grace be found in every faculty of our souls, not
only illumination in the mind, but a measure of Sanctification in the will,
affections and in all the powers of our souls for sanctifying grace cannot be
truly wrought in one part or faculty of the soul, but it will diffuse and
spread it self over all the rest, hence is renation of Gods image in man
called a new creation, which is entire of the whole man, if grace be thus
proportionable in every faculty of the soul, then it is truly wrought, and
then though it be but small in measure, yet it will afford us matter of
singular comfort. And know we on the contrary that if we have our heads
abounding and ouerflowing with knowledge, and yet our hearts empty of good
affections, grace is not truly wrought in us, and in time of temptation and
trial it will fails us, and we shall find no comfort in it.

We must hunger and thirst after righteousness. Mat. 5.6.
then we must learn that lesson that has a blessing set on the head of it,
by Christ himself, and a comfortable promise annexed, blessed are they that
hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be satisfied, we are in
this life to be in continual hunger and thirst after grace, never to find our
selves full, and as it were glutted and purged with any grace, but ever to
find an emptiness and such a want of that grace, that is truly wrought in
us, as does require further supply and filling up, and that we may be
content to break through any danger, to attain to a greater and more full
measure of the same, as we say in our common Proverb, Hunger will break
stone walls, it will force a man to do things above strength; yea, we find
it recorded in stories (as 2 King. 6.19.) it has made some of the tendrest
bowels and most affectionate in regard of Sex, even women to forget natural
affection, such an impatient and holy feeling must we have of the want of a
full measure of grace, and such an hungring desire to be further filled with
grace that is already wrought in us, and to that end we are to use all good
means of further increase of it, hearing, reading, conferring, and continual
meditating in the word of God, prayer, etc. and to use them with earnest
intention of heart and mind, we can witness with our selves, that when we
have been hungry we have used means of filling our bellies, and of
satisfying our hunger with our best endeavor: so must we with all earnest
endeavor use the means of further filling our hearts with that grace that is
begun in us; many there be who happily renounce the error of supposed
perfection, and they will confess that to be an error, yet notwithstanding
they feel not their own emptiness and want of grace, as they ought, they
have a soothing and pleasing contentment, Note.
they have as they imagine a competent and sufficient measure of grace: for
example, of faith, they believing the remission of their sins through the
blood of Christ, though that faith never show it self, by any love or zeal to
the glory of God, or any earnest care of the good of their brethren, they
think they have a (...) of faith; yea, some out of their blindness and out
of their presumption dare say, their faith is so strong that the devil cannot
hurt them; such persons cannot have any hungring and longing desire after
further increase of faith, they think it matters not, whether they profit, and
be further built up in faith by the use of the means or no. I refer such
persons but to that one place, Luke 6.25. where they find a woe denounced
against them, and that out of the mouth of Christ himself, woe be to you that
are full, what? full of faith and grace? No, that is far from the meaning of
Christ, he knew well there is no such fullness to be found, but woe to you
that in your own conceit are full, to you that imagine a fullness of grace,
and think that you need not care for any further increase, to you belongs a
woe and a heavy judgment; if then we would not come within compass of this
woe denounced by him who cannot lie, nor be deceived, let us take heed how we
fancy to our selves such a full and perfect measure of faith, as admits no
further increase by the use of good means; Note.
I grant there may be a (...), a full assurance of faith, respectu obiecti, in
respect of the object (namely) the goodness, truth, and power of God, but not
respectu subiecti, as it is in us, in regard of our corruption. Where we find
full assurance spoken of in the Scripture, we may observe it has relation to
the object of faith, as Romans 4.21. we are not therefore to dream of a full and
perfect faith in us, but let us labor to find our weakness and want of
faith, and every other grace truly wrought in us, and hunger and thirst after
a further measure of it, and use the means by which it may be increased,
Confutation of the papists.
(all fullness) I might here enter into a confutation of that gross error of
the Papists that Christ has merited but the first grace for us, that is as
they hold, he has merited that we hereafter by our merits may take away our
own sins, yea the sins of others, All fullness of merit has residence in
Christ as in the proper subject of it.
is a sufficient confutation of it, for in Christ (as here we are taught) is
found all fullness of merit.

The last thing we are briefly to observe from this verse is from the last
word (dwell) which word does give us to understand, thus much, that in Christ
all fullness of merit, has residence and abode, as in the proper seat and
subject, as in the proper mansion and receptacle, the merit of life eternal is
properly inherent in Christ, Adam had stood in his innocence, he could not
have merited any better estate for himself, because he was a mere man, much
less can we in the state of corruption; the ground of merit even in Christ is
the personal union.

So then for the use Merit of life eternal is not ours by infusion or
inherency but by application and imputation. Luke 20.35.
and as is the love of God and man, but it is applied and imputed unto us, and
freely bestowed upon true believers in Christ; it is not (as one says well)
any dignity in us but a dignation of us, an accepting and accompting us worthy
in Christ, we have the very phrase, they that shall be compted worthy etc. the
Papists the defenders of inherent worthiness, and merit of works.

Object that 2. Pet. 1.4.

For Answer, we are to mark the text, God dwelling in them by the graces of
righteousness and holiness which is the image of God, and those graces being
not perfect in us bring forth an imperfect fruit which can never merit truly
and properly.

VER. 20. And by him to reconcile all things unto himself, and to set at peace
through the blood of his Cross both the things in earth and the things in
heaven.
This verse is a further amplification of the Apostles second argument, whereby
he proves Christ a sufficient redeemer, and the ground of this also is from the
eternal decree of his Father, for that must be resumed (it pleased the Father)
(by him to reconcile) the matter, substance and general proposition laid down
in this verse, is this.

That it pleased the Father, that the death of Christ in whom all fullness of
merit is found, should be a full and perfect atonement and reconciliation of
all things to himself.

This is generally propounded in the first words, and by him etc. and then it
is further explaned with some change and variety of phrase, and withal there
is mention made of the special means of reconciliation (namely) the death of
Christ, and that his bloody death upon the cross in those words (and to set at
peace by the blood of his cross. In the last words we have a distinction of
all things reconciled in respect of place, that some be in earth and some be in
heaven (both the things in earth and the things in heaven.) These are the
general parts of this verse.

Come we to the first thing the general proposition (and by him) to reconcile
all things unto himself, Interpretation.
by him, that is, by Christ, not as an instrument as the Papists say, Christ is
but a minister yet a chief minister of reconciliation, for so they would
bleare the eyes of such as read their annotations in their Rhemist testament:
we are not so to understand the words of the Apostle, but by him as a material
and meritorious cause of reconciliation as the Apostle says, 2. Corin. 5.19.
God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their sins
unto them, (to reconcile) that is to set at one and to make of enemies friends
as the Apostle says, Romans 5.10. When we were enemies we were reconciled to
God, by the death of his son taking away the cause of enmity and difference,
(namely) sin, for so long as that remained untaken away, no friendship could be
between God and man, and therefore we have it in the place before named 2.
Corin. 15.16. not imputing their sins unto them (all things) (that is) all
things in heaven and earth that he had appointed to be reconciled (to himself)
these words have reference to the word Father in the verse before. Thus then we
are to conceive these words, it pleased the Father by Christ not as an
instrument but as the meritorious cause to make all that he had appointed to be
reconciled even at one and at peace with himself, removing al cause of enmity
between them and himself.

Here first we are to mark the connection of this verse Our reconciliation
with God is ever grounded on fullness of merit.
that the Apostle coupleth and conioyneth these two together that it pleased
the Father. That in him should all fullness dwell, and by him being full of
merit to reconcile all things unto himself, whence it follows that our
reconciliation with God, is ever grounded on the fullness of merit: fullness of
merit in natural order ever goes before reconciliation with God as the ground
of it, and the reason is this, reconciliation with God is an agreement and an
atonement made between God and us, by taking away sin the cause of
difference, now sin is not taken away without full satisfaction made unto God
and he is not satisfied but by fullness of merit answering his justice, even
such merit as is able both to appease his wrath, and procure his loving favor,
for no imperfect thing can satisfy the justice of God, therefore fullness of
merit ever goes before reconciliation with God.

For use We must apprehend fulness of merit before we can be persuaded of
reconciliation with God.
so is it in the comfortable apprehension of them that are reconciled to God,
we must first apprehend by Faith the fullness of merit, before we can be
persuaded of our reconciliation with God, the conscience of man will never be
truly quieted and pacified touching reconciliation with God till he come to
apprehend by faithfulness of merit in Christ, though a sanctified life and
good works, do make our calling and election sure 2. Pet. 1.10. and it is the
objection of the Papists that our confidence in God touching the favor of God,
arises not only of Faith, but of good works, and for this they allege 1.
Ioh, 3.21. if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God, yet
we must know that a sanctified life and good works give no assurance of
themselves by their own merit or worthiness (as the Papists teach) but as they
have relation to Faith, whereof they are evident signs, and as they have their
life and actiuity from Faith, for mark, that place of Peter, give diligence,
says he, to make your calling and election sure, in doing these things; but
what? do these things done simply of themselves make sure our calling and
election, no, no such matter, but as they are joined and knit unto faith, so
says the Apostle, verse 5, join to your faith virtue, 2. Pet. 1.5.6.7.
and with virtue knowledge, etc. so then good works of themselves, breed no
assurance of Gods favor, but as they are joined with faith, and do issue out
from Faith, Romans 5.1.
it is the plain doctrine of S. Paul that being justified through faith, we
have peace toward God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, peace and confidence
toward God, touching his favor and our reconciliation with him arises from
justification by Faith, and that has ever relation to the perfect merit of the
obedience and death of Christ, to the fullness of merit found in him, I may
here be bold to relate as fitting to this purpose a worthy observation of
Luther, I have seen (says he) many among the Papists, who have painefully
traveled and upon mere conscience have done as much as was possible for them
in fasting, prayer, and other exercises, and all to this end that they might
obtain quietness and peace of conscience, notwithstanding the more they
traveled, the more they were stricken down with fear, and especially when
the hour of death approached, they were then (says he) so fearful that I
have seen many murderers, and other malefactors condemned to death, at the
time of execution dying more courageously, and more comfortably then they did.
This Luther observed in his time, and there is reason for it from the word of
God, for it is impossible that the conscience should ever be pacified
concerning reconciliation with God by any good thing found in us, no, not by
faith it self for the goodness of it, or done by us by the merit of it, but
only by faith apprehending the fullness of merit, and that found only in
Christ.

The next thing we have to mark, is to be gathered from There is enmity and
disagreement between God and us, till we be reconciled unto him.
for reconciliation is ever (as we know) of parties at difference in regard of
offense. So then hence we are taught; that before we are reconciled to God by
Christ there is enmity and disagreement between God and us, he is an enemy
unto us and we are enemies to him; the Scripture is plentiful in the proof of
this, we need go no further then the verse following, Col. 1.21.
you which were in times past strangers and enemies, in time before your
reconciliation with God, there was enmity between God and you.

Let the use We are to labor for speedy reconciliation with God.
to teach us to labor for timely and speedy reconciliation with God by his
son Jesus Christ, I mean, for actual reconciliation, for though such as
belong to Gods election, are in Gods purpose, and materially by the death of
Christ reconciled to God, yet that is not comfortable till it be known to us,
we must labor for actual reconciliation with God by a justifying faith, and
for assurance of it by the spirit of God to stir us up to this duty, consider
this, is God our enemy? who then can be our friend; as the Apostle says on the
contrary, if God be with us, who can be against us, Romans 8.31. so if he be
against us, who can be for us, if God who should comfort us in time of trouble
and distress be angry with us, then our trouble and distress is doubled upon
us, it is is both grievous and paineful unto us, and it is mingled with
bitterness of the curse, it is an accursed trouble; in a word, if God be
offended with us, and we not actually reconciled unto him, all the creatures
are at enmity with us, all the judgments of God attend us, yea we are liable,
not only to common miseries, but to strange and sudden judgments, as we see
some unrepentant sinners suddenly overtaken by the hand of God many times in
their greatest delights, even in the Sunshine, Sodom was destroyed, and so it
may be with us for any thing we know; Genesis 19.23.24.
therefore this exhortation is needful, that with speed we labor to be
reconciled to God, it was not for nothing that the Apostle did so earnestly
enforce it. Now we then, as Ambassadors for Christ, we pray you, yea God by us,
and Christ himself does entreat you, 2 Cor. 5.20.
that you would not contemn his grace, cast off his merits, and lightly regard
his death, we pray you in Christ's stead, that ye be reconciled to God.

I doubt not upon due consideration of this truth, every one will confess it a
thing needful to be reconciled to God, yet there be many things to hinder
the practice of this so necessary a duty, and one great hinderance of it, I
will discover, and that is the want of feeling our own misery in which we
are by nature, Note.
many bless themselves in their natural state, and feel no want of the blood
of Christ for reconciliation with God, they feel not themselves disioined from
God, both in regard of holiness and happiness, and that there is in their
whole man, both body and soul, an horrible confusion, their understanding full
of palpable darkness, their will perverse, abhorring that is good, their
affections raging and inordinate, and if they should die in that state, that
they should enter into that unspeakable misery, that has no end but shall
continue for ever in hell, this many feel not, and so never seek after
reconciliation with God, and to be free from this misery, we must therefore
look into the word of God, that discouers our misery, and labor to have a
lively sense and feeling of it, The first step to blessedness.
for that is the first step to blessedness, to know and feel our own
misery, and know for a truth, that we can never with true comfort apply the
sweet promises of the Gospel touching remission of sins, till we have a true
feeling of our own misery, it is the order Christ himself has taught to be
held in our coming to him with hope of comfort. Mat. 11.28. Come to me you
that labor, you that feel your sins and are pressed with the weight and
burden of them, and you shall find ease, none but you.

We are futher to mark that the Apostle says, it pleased Every sin is against
God.
hence we may gather, that every sin is against God, every sin reaches up
to heaven, and is an offense against God himself, reconciliation here spoken
of being an agreement between God and sinful man, it must needs be that
every sin is against God to whom reconciliation is made, we read Psalm. 51.4.
that David in the confession of of his adultery does avouch it with repetition
and doubling against thee, against thee only have I sinned, and the Lord
himself says, Genesis 20.6. that he kept Abimelech from adultery, and in that
from sinning against himself, I kept thee that thou should not sin, not
against Abraham, but against me.

Reasons of this are these, every sin is a transgression Ioh. 3.4. and so
offensive to the Law giver God himself.

Ob. The Law has two Tables, Objection. 1. Ioh. 3.4.
the first concerning love to God, and the second concerning love to man,
therefore it may seem the breach and transgression of the commandments of the
first Table, is only against God.



Ioh 43.25. Mat. 9.5,
and that is only God, by the testimony of the Scribes, and therefore every
sin is against God.





This truth meets with that erroneous mincing and extenuating Confutation of a
Popish distinction.
that some sins are venial, and some mortal; yea, venial of their own
nature, even such as are only besides and not against the Law of God, and may
stand with true justice and deserve not eternal death, but are taken away by
some temporary punishment, this extenuation of sin cannot stand with the
doctrine now delivered, for if every sin be against God who is infinite in
Majesty and Glory, it must needs deserve infinite punishment, the greatness
of every offense against any person in the commonwealth is ever measured and
esteemed according to the dignity and quality of the person against whom it is
committed, so sin being against God, the due deserved punishment of it, of
necessity must be answerable to the offense of so high a Majesty, there being
ever a proportion between the Lawgiver, the Law it self, and the punishment
due to offenders, it is therefore to be renounced as a shifting vain
distinction invented by the Papists to obscure the great grace of God in the
remission of sins; that some sins are of their own nature venial.

For a second use; is it so that every sin reaches to heaven; We are to take
notice of the enormity and greatness of every sin.
hence take we knowledge of the enormity and greatness of every sin, though it
be a sin against the second table, though it be an evil word or deed against
man, to the hurt of his body, goods or good name, yet we must know it stays
not at the man, but reaches up to the Lord, and he it is that will be avenged
of it, every man can take notice of the gross sins of the second Table, yea,
many hold them the only great sins (which indeed they are not) though they
be very foul. But if they wrong their brethren either secretly or in small
matters, then they out of their blindness of mind think it is either no sin
at all, or a trifling sin, if they can blind the eyes of men all is well,
but know it whosoever thou art, though thou may deceive man and bleare his
eyes with a thousand devices, yet thy sin is against God, and thou can not
blind his eyes, no gifts, no bribes, no cunning, can stop or stay him, as he
is God, he will have vengeance for his part, 1. Sam. 2.25. says old Ely, if
one man sin against another, the Judge as Mediator may moderate and order the
matter, and by his authority cause him that has done the wrong, (as it is a
wrong to man) to make recompense and satisfaction, but as it is a sin against
the Lord who will plead for him? surely, none but Jesus Christ the righteous.

Come we to the explanation of the Apostles general proposition in the words
following (And to set at peace) where we see a change of the phrase,
Interpretation.
and expressing of the special mean of reconciliation. To set at peace, is
all one in substance with the former phrase, to reconcile, and so to be
conceived (namely) to set at one to make of enemies friends; (Through the
blood) (that is) through his bloody death, it is a metonimicall speech, blood
being put for the shedding of his blood, and it is added (of his blood) to
signify the condition of his death, which was accursed, and to make a
difference between that shedding of his blood, and the shedding of it at
othertimes, as at the time of his circumcision, whipping, crowning with
thorns, which were preparatiues to the shedding of his blood on the cross,
thus then the words are to be understood, and to set at one to make of enemies
friends, through his death, and that his bloody and accursed death on the
cross.

Reconciliation between God and his chosen, is made only by the bloody death
of Christ. Heb. 7.26.
that reconciliation and peace made between God and his Elect, by taking away
sin is only by the bloody death of Christ, by Christ his sacrifice on the
cross, the Apostle here sets it down as the proper fruit and effect of
Christ his death, and we find it not in any place of Scripture ascribed to
any other thing, but only to the death of Christ, and for this we have many
pregnant places, now in the end of the world, has he appeared once to put away
sin, by the sacrifice of himself, Heb. 10.14. with one offeringe has he
consecrated for ever them that are sanctified; our Savior says, consummatum
est, it is finished, John. 19.30.
hereby signifying the consummation and perfection of his cross.

The point being clear it serves for the use Confutation of the Papists
touching their real and external sacrifice, which they hold to be in the
Sacrament of the supper even the very body and blood of Christ under the forms
of bread and wine, offered up to God the Father as a propitiatory sacrifice for
the quick and dead, that is their doctrine, now these two things cannot stand
together, that reconciliation and peace was made by the death of Christ
between God and his chosen, and that there is another propitiatory sacrifice
in the Sacrament, and that we may yet further see the error of the Papists
and be better settled in the truth taught by our Church grounded on the word of
God, consider we but this one reason, Christ his sacrifice once offered upon
the cross, is a most perfect and full satisfaction for the sins of Gods Elect
and is of infinite end eternal virtue and efficacy, and therefore other real
sacrifices are needless and superfluous.

The learned amongst the Papists reply,

There is no more reason why Christ should again be sacrificed,

They reply further by way of distinction, that whereas the holy Ghost says,
speaks of the bloody sacrifice which was sufficient once to be done: but
besides that, there is an unbloody sacrifice, whereby Christ is offered under
the forms of bread and wine in the Sacrament, and that is but an iteration of
the former, whereby the fruit and effect of the former is applied unto us.

This distinction is flat contrary to the plain text of the Apostle, Hebr:
10.11.12. for if Christ should be often sacrificed, after what manner soever
it skilles not, then the difference would not hold which the holy ghost makes
between the sacrifices of the Law, and the sacrifice of Christ for thus stands
the opposition. The sacrifices of the law were often to be offered, but the
sacrifice of Christ only once. The Priests of the law had many iteratiue and
co^memoratiue sacrifices of Christ his death, therefore we have not so now:
this is the opposition of the holy ghost, and this falls to the ground, if
there be any iteration of Christ his sacrifice; again, the distinction is
absurd and foolish, that Christ should offer himself upon the cross after a
bloody manner, and in the Sacrament after an unbloody manner, for the sacrifice
and offering of Christ and his death and suffering, which cannot be without
effusion of blood, are made by the holy ghost all one, Christ cannot be offered
without dying and suffering, Heb: 9.25.27.
therefore this distinction was never known to the holy ghost, neither has it
any footing in the word: it remains a truth, that Christ his sacrifice once
offered upon the cross, is most absolute, and of infinite merit and virtue to
reconcile us unto God, and therefore other real sacrifices whether
representative (as they call them) or unbloody whatsoever, are needless and
vain, and there is not in the Sacrament of the Supper, any real external
propitiatory sacrifice, as the Papists grossly hold and teach.

The next thing we have to mark is this, in that the Apostle makes the
special means of reconciliation between God and his chosen by taking away of
their their sins, both the guilt and punishment to be the death and passion
of Christ, that it pleased the Father to reconcile, etc.

We may hence conclude, that our justification in the Our justification in the
sight of God, is not only by the death of Christ.
the thing by which we are justified in the sight of God, is not the passion of
Christ alone, though that is one special thing by which we are justified; for
by that, as many as truly believe in Christ, have only remission of their
sins, which is but one part of our justification in the sight of God; in
common reason we know that reconciliation amongst men is made, when the party
offending has satisfied the party offended, either by himself or some other,
for the offense, be it really, or in words only, reconciliation properly goes
no further; the party offending, does not by satisfaction for the offense
deserve further favor, unless there be something else over and beside that
satisfaction; so is it in this case, the chosen of God being the parties
offending; God being the party offended by their sin, and satisfaction being
made to his justice by the death of Christ, that death alone considered, does
not procure any more than remission of their sins, and deliverance from al
punishment: it does not also purchase a right to life everlasting, and so our
justification in the sight of God, is not by the death of Christ alone, but
also by the obedience of his life, Some hold that our justification in the
sight of God, is only by the death of Christ.

Reas ns confirming the truth of the Doctrine.


our complete and full justification in the sight of God is by the obedience of
Christ as well active as passive; it is held by some, that our justification in
the sight of God is only by the death of Christ, and that the passion, is the
only thing by which we are justified in Gods sight.

I will therefore labor first to strengthen the truth now delivered, by some
reasons out of the word of god, and then answer such things as are commonly
objected against it.

First therefore consider we this reason: Christ is not only the price of
redemption, but the end and perfection of the Law: to what purpose? for
righteousness unto every one that believes, they are the very words of the
Apostle, Romans 10.4. Christ perfectly fulfilled the Law for righteousness
unto every one that believes. Therefore every true believer is justified in
Gods sight, not only by his death and passion, but by his righteousness
imputed.

1 Cor. 1.30.
the price of redemption, we have only deliverance from sin and deserved death,
and not the gift of righteousness, to life eternal, they are distinct
benefits.

Thirdly, whole Christ is given unto us with all his benefits, Isay 9.6. unto
us a child is borne, and unto us a son is given, that he might bestow
himself wholly on us as a Mediator, and all the works of mediation, as
(namely) his holy incarnation, his fulfilling of the Law, and his suffering for
sin, therefore we by faith are made partakers of the righteousness of Christ,
as well as of the merit of his death: if it were not so, then it would follow
that half Christ, Christ only suffering, and not working, were given unto us.

Fourthly, the Apostle says, Romans 5.19. As by one Adam and Christ together,
that as many as were made sinners by Adams sin imputed unto them, so many are
made righteous by the obedience of Christ imputed.



I answer,

Now against this it is commonly objected,

Christ as man fulfilled the Law for himself, that he

It is said again, we read that by the blood of Jesus we ius ingrediendi in
Sancta, Hebr. 10.19.
nempe coelum, (that is) right to eternal life by the blood of Christ, Romans
5.9. we are justified by his blood, and we shall be saved from wrath by him.

There is such neerenesse and affinity between the passion of Christ and his
active obedience, figurative speech, where one part of the obedience of Christ
is set down for the whole. Thus we find justification ascribed to the
resurrection of Christ Romans 4.25. which indeed does only justify by way of
testimony and application, and not by satisfaction, as does the obedience of
his life and death.

Romans 8.17. and therefore are justified only by Christ his death and passive
obedience.

Galat. 4.4.5. God sent forth his son made of a woman and made under the
Law, not borne but made, that he might redeem them which were under the Law,
that we might receive the adoption of the sons. The obedience of the Son
of God made man, and made under the Law, is that which freeth true believers
from under the law, and gives them adoption of sons. Christ as the natural son
of God, is heir of his Fathers kingdom: true believers as the adopted sons
become partakers of the same inheritance. Christ his mediation performs to
them the grace of adoption, and his mediation is his holy incarnation, his
fulfilling of the Law, and his suffering for sin, and therefore still it
remains a truth, that we are justified in Gods sight, not by the death of
Christ alone, but also by his active obedience.

Romans 4.5. Object.
Some object that faith is accounted or imputed for righteousness, and no other
righteousness required to our justification in Gods sight, but faith, and
therefore the righteousness of Christ is not imputed unto us, to our
justification.

I answer, (namely) that which it takes hold of, and that is the righteousness
of God, as the Apostle calls it, 2. Cor, 5.21. and that is the perfect
righteousness of Christ; which has all the power and merit of it from his
godhead, and is therefore called the righteousness of God, Phil. 3.9.
and so is Faith counted for righteousness, because it takes hold on that
which is our righteousness in the sight of God, even the perfect
righteousness of Christ: other objections there be but these are the chief,
and these being answered let us hold it as a truth grounded on the word of
God, We are to hold the truth of the doctrine delivered.
that our justification in the sight of God is not only by the death and
passion of Christ, but also by his perfect active obedience imputed unto us,
before we come to the last words of this verse observe one thing further, the
Apostle says not through the wood of his cross, but through the blood of his
cross, power to reconcile, pacify, satisfy and sanctify, is not given to
the wood of the cross, but to Christ his painful suffering on the cross.
Popish superstition touching the wooden cross of Christ, discovered to be
most gross.
The papists ascribe much to the wooden material cross of Christ, that it
being the instrument of redemption and the Altar on which Christ was offered,
it is sanctified and truly called holy cross, whereas indeed the Scripture
never calls it holy but rather cursed for the Apostle proves that Christ became
accursed for us in that he suffered on the cross, and that by testimony taken
out of the old testament, it is written, cursed is every one that hangs on
tree: yet the Papists will needs force holiness upon the wooden cross, Gal.
3.13.
yea they put confidence in it, and pray unto it, holy cross save us: thus
grossly superstitious are they, it is sufficient to have named this among such
as renounce and abhor such popish gross and carnal superstition.

Come we to the last words (both the things in earth, and the things in heaven)
these words are a distinction of things reconciled to God, by things in earth
we are to understand only the chosen of God living in the world:
Interpretation. 1. Tim. 5.21. Object.
by things in heaven, the holy and elect Angels as they are called.

Have the elect Angels who never sinned need of Christ a mediator? this
seems contrary to all show of truth, for reconciliation is a setting at one,
by taking away sin.

1. Tim. 2.5.
that they might by the grace of Christ be confirmed and set out of danger of
defection and falling from God, and that they might again be knit together
with the elect under one and the same head Christ Jesus, as the Apostle says,
Ephesians. 1.10. that he might gather together in one all things, both which are in
heaven, and which are in earth in Christ. In these respects the holy Angels had
need of a mediator.

Now that which we have hence to mark, is this, that it pleased the Lord
together with the reconciliation of his chosen to himself, to work the
confirmation of his elect Angels in grace and goodness, knitting them
inseparably to himself, he would not perfect the blessedness of his holy Gods
chosen children are right dear to the Lord.
he might have confirmed them long before, but he would not, it was not his
pleasure to give them that blessing, till Jesus Christ the mediator came and
joined them with man. Here then we are taught to see and consider the infinite
and unspeakable love of God to his chosen, that his chosen children are right
dear to the Lord, Heb. 11.39.40
and of exceeding great price with the Lord. We shall find it the argument of
the holy Ghost himself, to prove that the Lord had a fatherly, provident, and
special regard of his church under the new Testament, that the Saints that
suffered in time of the old Testament got not the thing promised, because God
had respect to us: God providing that they without us should not be perfected.
Where the argument stands thus; That the Lord had a fatherly care over us,
because they were not made perfect without us, and so it does plainly manifest
and euince the Lords wonderful love, and his gracious regard of his chosen,
that he would not give his holy Angels their full blessing of their
confirmation in grace, without the blessing of the reconciliation of his
chosen, and that this love of the Lord toward his chosen, may be yet more
clear unto us, consider that the chosen children of God, are so esteemed of
the Lord, that for their sakes he does many times extend his bounty, and
bestow temporary benefits upon the wicked, if ten of them had been found in
Sodom, the whole City had been spared for their sakes. The world does hate,
malice, Genesis 18.
mock and contemn the godly, making more account of one profane Esau, than
of twenty true hearted Jacobs, but the Lord whose love is life it self, more
esteems one Jacob, one faithful servant of his, then ten thousand worldlings;
yea ten of them shall stand before him to turn him from anger to mercy, when
he will not vouchsafe to respect ten thousand such as the world honors for
men and women of great account.

Oh then let us ever seek and sue to be within compass We are to seek and
sue to be within compass of Gods love.
and say with the Prophet David, Psalm 4.6. Many say who will show us any
good? but Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us. Again, are the
chosen of God of such high esteem and price with the Lord, that without them
he would not perfect the blessed estate of his holy Angels, and by them and
for them he extends his Such as fear God, bring much good to the place where
they live.
Then let us have our eyes opened to behold whether good or evil do come to a
land, to a city, or to an house by such as fear God, for the sake of ten
such, the Sodomites had escaped the fearful plague of fire and brimstone, and
for Noah's sake, was Cham preserved. Paul had all the souls given him that were
in the same ship, Act. 27.24. are these then the hurts of a place, and must be
rooted out, or else we shall not be well. Oh then learn to see their price
with God, and the profit and good that come^ even to the wicked, by such men
and women as fear the Lord, learn to esteem of them as we ought; let us not
be like the Gadarenes Mar. 5. to prefer our sin before Christ, and wish any one
fearing God to be gone, rather then part with a trifling profit, learn I say,
to think on the price with God, and profit to men, of such as fear the Lord.

Ver. 21.22.
VER. 21. And you which were in times past strangers and enemies, because your
minds were set in evil works, has he now also reconciled.

22. In the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and unblameable,
and without fault in his sight.


In these words the Apostle applies that which he has generally said of
reconciliation in ver. 20. to the Colossians in special, affirming that they
in particular, were reconciled to God by the death of Christ, that is the
proposition laid down in these two verses.

Now this proposition is amplified by a description of the Colossians, what
they were before their reconciliation, (namely) strangers and enemies, and you
which were in times past strangers and enemies: together with the proper seat
and subject of that enmity (namely) their minds, and that not in the essence
and substance of their minds, but in the quality of them, that their minds
were set in evil works ill affected.

The second amplification of the proposition is in the verse 22. from the end
of their reconciliation in these words, to make you holy and unblameable, and
that before him, in his own sight, these are the general parts of these two
verses.

I will first stand on that part of the Apostles proposition that is laid down
in the verse. 21. together with the description of the Colossians, before their
calling and conversion: you which were strangers, Interpretation.
that word is metaphorical, and is put to signify a spiritual separation and
alienation from God. That the Colossians before their conversion, were as
strangers unto God, in respect of spiritual communion, that they had as it
were nothing to do with God, nor he with them, in regard of any spiritual
blessing and comfort promised to his children, so does the Apostle express it
in the state of the Ephesians, cap. 2.12. that they were aliants from the
common wealth of Israel, and were strangers from the covenants of promise, and
had no hope, and were without God in the world; and makes it further clear by
opposition, ver. 19. that to be strangers is to have no fellowship with him,
either public or private, enemies, that is, such as did hate God, and were
hated of God for sin.

How can it be that any should hate God the chief good yea, goodness it
self?

The wicked hate God, not simply as he is God, (reconciled) that is, actually
and effectually, by communicating unto you the virtue of the death of his Son.
Thus then the words are to be conceived: And even you Colossians, who in times
past were estranged from God, in regard of spiritual communion, yea, were such
as hated God, and were hated of God, has God the Father now actually and
effectually reconciled.

The first thing that we have here to mark, is, that the Apostle does not
content himself to deliver the general doctrine of reconciliation between God
and his chosen, but he does in particular apply it to the Colossians, and
says, even you has he reconciled.

General doctrines must be applied particularly. 1. Tim. 4.2.
Hence we may gather, that general doctrines taught out of the word, must be
particularly applied to the hearers for their comfort or reproof, or to
profitable use for their edification, we find it the Apostles charge to
Timothy, not only in general to preach the word, to open and publish the
secrets of the Gospel, but to be instant in improouing, rebuking and
exhorting, with all long suffering and doctrine, Tit. 2.15. these things
speak, and not only so,

Cor. 10.5. that is a matter of great hardness and difficulty, and therefore
the truth must not only be taught in general, but it must also be applied in
particular, that the power of it may be felt to a through reformation.



Is it so that general doctrine must be particularly applied Hearers of the
word must suffer instruction and reproof as just occasion is offered to the
teacher.
then the hearers must suffer both teaching, instruction, and also
reprehension, and correction as occasion is offered to the teacher, they must
not start aside when the word is opened and applied to their just reproof,
shew^ing them their sins, or threaning judgments against them for their
sins, men must hear with willingness and patience the word of just reproof
and not quarrel with the affection of the speaker, when they are justly taxed
for their sins. If they do, it is not only an argument of a spiritual
frenzy, but of Gods judgments imminent and ready to fall upon them when they
cannot abide to be touched, but will have Preachers speak pleasing and
flattering things unto them, this iniquity, says the Prophet Isaiah.
30.13.14. shall be unto them, as a breach that falls, both suddenly and
remediless, without all hope of recovery, like the breaking of a potters pot,
which is broken without pity, and in the breaking thereof is not found a
sheard to take fire out of the hearts, or to take water out of the pit.

And consider we, Note.
that the word truly taught and applied never returns empty, for if it work
not godly sorrow and amendment, certainly, it works, hardness and
impenitency. It is either the savor of life to life, or the savor of death to
death, and remember withal what Solomon has said, Proverb. 28.9. that he
that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer shall be
abominable. He that refuses to hear God speaking in his accusing,
condemning and threatninge Law, the Lord in justice will turn away his ear
from his prayer, and his prayer does incense the Lord to wrath The Minister of
God may apply the promises of the Gospel to particular believers.
Learn we then to submit our selves to be taught the truth, and to be
rebuked for any thing that is a miss in us.

Secondly is it so, that the word must not only be generally taught, but
particularly applied, surely, then the minister of God may lay the indefinite
promise of the Gospel to the heart of every particular man for his comfort,
and assure him that he believing them, he shall be saved.



See how these enemies of the grace of God and of the word of his grace would
fame shift off the plain evidence of the word, to hold the people in suspense
and doubt of their salvation.

It is not to the purpose, whether the minister know that the man to whom he
speaks be in the number of the elect, the minister does not, neither is he to
assure any man of his salvation, but upon condition of believing, he does only
apply the general promises of the word to every man particularly upon
condition of believing. After this manner, the Gospel says, whosoever
believes shall be saved, the application of the minister is this, therefore
believe thou John or Thomas and thou shall be saved, and this is in effect, as
if Christ himself should say unto him, believe thou, and thou shall be saved:
for to his ministers he has committed the word of reconciliation: 2. Corin.
5.19. and so any man finding true faith in himself, (as he may find it upon
due examination as the Apostle has made clear 2. Cor. 13.5. prove your selves
whether ye are in the faith. Examine your selves: know ye not your own selves,
how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?) he may be assured
of his own salvation.

The next thing we have to mark is this, the Apostle says the Colossians
were in times past strangers and enemies but now they were reconciled from this
difference of times we may conclude that there is an intercourse and successiue
change not only in things natural, Men may be changed in respect of their sp
r^tuall condition.
but also in things spiritual and supernatural, men may he changed in
respect of their spiritual condition, and of children of wrath by nature, they
may be made the sons of God, and heirs of life and salvation, a point
plainly taught by Gods effectual vocation and calling of men out of the
kingdom of darkness into the liberty of Gods children and not only clear
from this text but by many other places of Scripture Romans 6.11. ye have been
servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart unto the form of the
doctrine whereunto ye were delivered, Ephesians. 5.8. ye were once darkness, but
now are light in the Lord. If any man be truly called out of the state of
nature into the state of grace, he can upon his own experience justify this
truth, that the spiritual condition of men may in time be changed, and the
ground of this is, Gods eternal purpose Romans 8, 30. whom he predestinate them
also he called, and whom he called them also he justified, and whom he
justified, them also he glorified. Other sheep I have, which are not of this
fold, them also must I bring says our Savior John. 10.16.

This being so that the Lord in time will bring home his wandering sheep into
his sheepfold, We must take heed of untimely censure and rash condeming such
as are yet uncalled and unconverted.
it serves to reprove the preposterous and rash judgment of some who are so
bold as to step up into Gods chair, and to give their deffinitiue sentence of
some wicked and ungodly men and to pronounce them ^eprobates and utterly cast
away, we must take heed of this boldness, and know that we are not to
despair of the final state of any wicked man, unless his sin be against
the holy Ghost (which we can hardly know and discern) for the Lord can and
will in his appointed time call him home if he belong to his election. Paul his
example may be in stead of many, how was he estranged from God? and how far
was he carried in fury and blood thirsty cruelty against the Church of God Acts
9.1. it is said, he breathed out threatenings: and his own confession is, Gal.
1.13. that he persecuted the Church of God extremely, and wasted it yet
afterward it pleased God to call and convert him, and of a violent bloody
persecutor to make him an excellent and famous preacher, in this example the
Lord has taught us to expect with patience the conversion of rebellious
sinners, knowinge this, that God can call and convert when he will, and whom
he will, he calls laborers into his vineyard, some at one hour, and some at
another, Mat. 20. it is therefore S. Paul's lesson to Timothy, 2. Tim. 2^.25.
and it must be ours, that we suffer evil men patiently, that are cureable, in
whom there is any hope proueing if God at any time will call them to
repentance, and God can and will in his good time bring home his chosen, be they
never so far strayed from him, therefore take heed of untimely censure and
rash condemning any man yet uncalled and unconverted.

Now in that the Apostle says that the Lord had now actually reconciled the
Colossians being sometimes mere Gods elect in regard of election are beeloued
of God being yet uncalled.
though for the present they be uncalled, yet even then in regard of election
they are within the compass of Gods love. For why? the Lord will in time call
them, and actually reconcile them to himself as he did the Colossians and that
does plainly prove his precedent and foregoing love toward them, that he
loved them before their effectual calling, even when they were strangers and
enemies: yea the Lord embracing his chosen in Christ (...) the Apostle says,
Ephesians. 1.4.
before the foundation of the wo^de though they make defection, and be
estranged from him, yet he changes not upon them, he only hates their sin
but still loves them. Hence it is that the Apostle says, that God sets out his
love, Romans 5.8.
makes his love toward his elect known, yea he makes it known both to them
and to all the world, that he loved them even, while they were yet sinners, in
that he gave his son Christ to die for them, and S. Ioh. 1. epist. 4.9. says.
In this appeared the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten
son into the world, that we might live through him, his love was toward his
chosen before, and in this was it manifested, that he sent his only begotten
son into the world, and even then when we loved not him but were yet in our
sins he loved us.

The reason and ground of this is from the immutability of God, with whom is no
variablenes, James 1.17.
and therefore these whom he has loved from all eternity and in lou^ elected
and appointed to life and salvation, them he does embrace in his love for ever.
It is not their enmity toward him that can make him turn away his love from
them in regard of election, and thus the Apostle reasons, Romans 11.28.
that the Jews as concerning the Gospel were enemies, but as touching the
election, they are beloved for their Fathers sakes, for says he ver. 29. the
gifts and calling of God are without repentance. The Lords love either in gifts
or calling is unchangeable.

But will some say, are the elect of God as yet uncalled, Ob.
and as yet strangers and enemies within the compass of Gods love, then it
seems their persons and works are pleasing unto God before their conversion,
and that is agreeable to popish doctrine* that is a thing they much contend for
and stand upon.

For answer to this we must learn to mark a different d^gree of the Lords
love extended toward his chosen, Note.
and in time to be called with that degree of love that is proper to the elect
uncalled, but when they are called and justified, then they are loved with a
further degree of his love even to an actual acceptance of their persons and
good works as pleasing unto him in Christ, they being ingrafted into Christ
their persons and good works are actually accepted as pleasing to God in and
through Christ, and so it remains a truth that the chosen of God yet uncalled
in regard of election are loved of God though not with that degree of his love,
it pleases him to vouchsafe to them that are actually called.

This may be to every one that has had testimony of Gods special love toward
himself a ground of exceeding great comfort? A ground of great comfort to such
as have testimony of Gods special love toward them
are men when they are uncalled within the compass of that love of the Lord?
then whosoever has had a true taste and testimony of Gods love toward him,
may be comforted with full assurance that that love shall continue for ever,
does the Lord still love those whom he has elected though they be as yet
estranged from him and do not know his love and will he in time make known
that love of his to them in their reconciliation to himself? And will his love
then ever fail those to whom it has been manifested and testified in
special manner? it is not possible, though the Lord for the present may seem
to hide his face from thee, yet if ever thou have had any pledge of his
special love toward thy self, comfort thy self, thou may be assured his
love will never forsake thee, his love is eternal and never changes, and upon
former experience of it, thou may reason thus for thy comfort, the Lord has
formerly testified his love toward me, therefore he will still continue to
love me, he will be good unto me, because he has been good, and add one
testimony of his love and mercy to another to his first, a second, to the
second a third, and so ever one mercy to another and one measure of love to an
other, this David knew well, and therefore he entreated the Lord to be good
unto him, because he had been good Psalm. 4.1. thou have set me at liberty
when I was in distress, and therefore still have pity upon me, Psalm. 4.1.
and this was the ground of David's comfort, and this may stablish thy heart
also with comfort, if ever thou have tasted the sweetness of the Lords
special love thou may with cheerful heart say. O Lord be good unto me not
because I have been a good servant of thine, but because thou have been a
good God of mine. If thine obedience were to be the argument why the Lord
should be good unto thee then (though thou be a faithful servant of God)
yet doubtless in conscience of thine own sin, thine heart would fail thee,
but the argument is to be the Lords former goodness and love expressed
toward thee, and this is a sure argument that will never deceive thee, the
Lord has been good, therefore he will still and ever be good, thou have had
experience of his love, therefore build upon it, his love shall never fail
thee, let us meditate and think upon this ground of comfort, in time of need
we shall find much sweetness in it.

The next thing we have to mark as a ground of further A stranger to God is
an enemy to God.
the Apostle does couple and conioyne these two together strangers and enemies,
hence we are taught that a stranger to God is an enemy to God they ever go
together, it is not betwixt God and man as betwixt man and man, one man may be
a stranger to another, yet not an enemy, but if thou be a stranger to God, Mat.
12.30.
thou art an enemy to God. Christ himself has taught the truth of this, he
that is not with me is against me, ye he makes it a reciprocal proposition,
and true back again, for says he, Mark 9.40. he that is not against us is
on our part: whence we may easily conceive the reason of it why a stranger to
God is an enemy to God, because by the testimony of our Savior there is no
medium between them, no middle condition between a stranger to God and an
enemy to God, he that has not communion with God (which in deed) is to be a
stranger unto him, he has it with the Devil, yea luke warm professors such
as the holy Ghost says are neither hot nor cold Revel. 3.15. which seem to
hold a middle condition, in deed and truth rightly considerered in that they
are lukewarm they have fellowship with the devil, and so must needs, so far
forth as they are lukewarm be enemies to God, and this ought to teach us to
take heed how we be always estranged from the Lord.

Some the holy Ghost has noted out as great strangers We must take heed we be
not any way estranged from God. Luke 15.13.
drunkards and such like, these (without question) are at open defiance with
the Lord, their behavior shows it, they bend their tongue like bows as says
the Prophet Jeremy 9.3. and shoot out their arrows, bitter and blasphemous
words against God.

We must not only take heed of this that we become not such strangers as
these who are at open war with the Lord, and can justly look for nothing,
but that the Lord should deal with them as with his professed enemies, even
come down in judgment upon them, hew them in pieces, and give them their
portion with hypocrites, we must not only take heed of this great strangenes
and open hostility, but beware that thou turn not so much as thy foot from the
Lord, keep thy self at home with him, frequent his house and come often to
his table where thou may have familiar communion with him, for as we count
him a stranger who seldom or never comes home unto us. Note.
So is he a stranger to the Lord who often absents himself from his house, and
seldom or never comes to his table, and in that wilful staying himself from
the house and table of the Lord he becomes an enemy to God, and takes up a
banner against him, which is little thought on by many persons, who ofttimes
upon no occasion absent themselves, and seldom, scarce once in a year or two
come to the Lords table, if a man should ask such persons whether they love God
or no, they would scorn the question, but if they make answer it would be
readily this, O yes they love the Lord, they would be sorry else, but will thou
understand o thou vain man whosoever thou art, if thou will understand and
consider it aright, know thou art an enemy to God, whatsoever thou say to the
contrary, thou art a stranger unto him, thou have not that familiar and
comfortable fellowship with God, that his people have in his house, and the
Lord holds thee a stranger, and consequently an enemy unto him, and without
repentance, will judge and plague thee as one of his enemies, think upon it
whosoever thou art that have bin careless in frequenting the house and table
of the Lord; and remember the words of the holy Ghost himself, If any withdraw
himself, Acts 10.38.
my soul shall have no pleasure in him. If any withdraw himself from the
communion of Saints in the house of God, and so from communion with God
himself, he withdrawes himself from under the special providence of God, he
is not under the special tuition of the Lord, but only under his long
suffering.

One thing more may hence be observed, we are to mark Together with Gods mercy
toward us, we are ever to consider our own misery.
but with it puts the Colossians in mind of their miserable estate, in which
they stood before they were reconciled, the conclusion hence may be general
(namely) this, that together with the mercy of God we are ever to consider our
own misery; the Lords bounty in any good blessing bestowed on body or soul,
should ever bring us to a consideration of our own formerwretchednes, that is
a rule of excellent use, the practice of it will make us truly humble, and
truly thankful to God for his mercy.

If the rich man who has come up of small beginnings, It will make us truly
humble, and truly thankful to Gods mercy. Genesis 32.10.
together with his own former poverty, it would make him in all humility and
thankfulness, to say with good Jacob, I am not worthy of the least of all thy
mercies, and all the truth which thou have showed unto thy servant, for with
my staff came I over this Jorden, and now have I gotten two bands. and if with
the blessing of our apparel, we did but consider our own shame and sin upon
which apparel was given (for it came in upon the fall) it would pull down the
pride of many in the world; here is a rule of direction for thee in respect of
apparel. Note.
Some say you can give no special direction what manner of apparel we are to
wear, and of what fashion our apparel ought to be, how much lace, fringe,
gold or silver; etc. we are to put upon our apparel. Indeed it is true, the
Scripture does not set down these particulars, but yet consider thou with thy
apparel, thine own misery, shame and desert by sin, and that will root out thy
vain delight in thy apparel; remember thy apparel is a badge of sin and
the desert of sin, and that will pull down thy pride, and make thee rather
sigh than swell with pride, as many do in respect of their apparel.

Come we to the seat and subject of that enmity that was in the Colossians
toward God before their reconciliation, (namely) their minds, and those ill
affected in these words, (because your minds were set in evil works) the
Apostles word in the original, here translated (minds) does signify agitatio^
or discourse of mind and reason, whereby one thing is inferd upon another, as
when the mind does not simply apprehend, but deduce one thing upon another,
that deduction is properly called (...) discourse of mind and reason, and that
is the Apostles word, Interpretation.
whereby no doubt he would have us to understand all the chief powers of the
soul (namely) reason, will and affections, for as sound and true friendship
amongst men stands not only in consent of understanding, when men conceive the
same things true or false, but in actual consent of will and affections, and
their enmity stands in the difference and dissent of minds, will and
affections, so is there enmity between God and men, when the minds, wills and
affections of men are opposite and against the will and wisdom of God, therefore
by the word (minds) we are to understand, reason, will and affections (were
set) these words are not expressed, but yet they are implied, the Apostle
speaking of the Colossians in their natural condition; for in saying (their
minds in evil works) he does thereby give us to understand, that their minds
had not in them only that original corruption, that is common to the
regenerate and unregenerate, (even the most regenerate having original sin
remaining in them) but that they had in the^ actual sinfulnes, as dulnes in
their minds, ignorance, oblivion, perverseness in their wills, frowardness in
their affections, and that the powers of their souls were wholly bent unto sin,
therefore the words may well be rendered as they are, because your minds were set
on evil works, and the meaning of the^ is briefly this, because your reason,
will and affections, had in them actual sinfulnes, and were wholly bent and set
upon sin.

Now here first observe that the Apostle says, Romans 3.13.14 15.16.17.18.
the Colossians were enemies to God, not because their bodies were defiled with
sin, as that their throat was an open sepulcher as he speaks Romans 3.13.14.
their mouths full of cursing and bitterness, etc. though those things no
(doubt) were common amongst them before their conversion, but because their
minds were set on evil works.

Hence we may gather that the beginning, and as it were All sin begins in the
mind.
the inward faculties of the soul are first defiled, and from thence flow
filthy streams of all actual sins. It is a point taught by Christ himself
Mat. 15.18. that evil things which proceed out of the mouth, come from the
heart, for out of the heart says he, come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slanders: where we see he makes the
heart, understanding by that the inward powers of the soul, the root and
beginning of all evil. Hence it is that the Apostle does so often urge
renouation of mind, as Romans 12.2. Be changed by the renewing of your mind,
Ephesians. 4.23. Be renewed in the spirit of your mind. Let us cleanse our selves
from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, 2. Cor. 7.1.
and grow up unto full holiness in the fear of God. And David prayed Psalm
51.10. that the Lord would create a clean heart within him, and there is
reason also to prove this, that the first and principal seat of sin is the
mind and soul, because all actiuitie and motion, good and bad is from the
soul, the body is but the instrument of the soul.

Confutation of the Papists.
who teach that the first motions of the mind disordered, even the evil lust
and concupiscence of the heart without consent of will to accomplish evil, is
no sin, this cannot stand with the truth now delivered, for if the mind and
heart be first defiled, and from thence comes actual sin, it must needs be,
that the first motions of the mind to evil, and the last of the heart, though
it be without consent is sin, yea in the regenerate, and it may easily be
proved, for even the having of an evil thought in the mind is repugnant and
contrary to the Law of God, and a fruit of corruption it is, such as we should
never have had, if we had stood in the state of innocence, and therefore
naught, and a sin.

Ob.
Yea, but says the Papists, we read, Iam. 1.15. that when lust has conceived
it brings forth sin: mark (says he) concupiscence tempts, and allureth
by some evil motion, but that is no sin till it does conceive (that is)
obtain some liking of the will in giving ear to it, and not expelling it.

To this I answer, consent even of it self is sin, though not in that height
and kind that outward actual sins are.

Secondly, is it so that every actual sin is a stream We are to keep our
hearts with all diligence.
the mind and inward faculties of the soul, then it behooues every one to
follow the council of the wise man, Pro. 4.23 Keep thy heart with all
diligence for thereout comes life.

And in the first place, we are to look to the change and and renouation of
our minds, and the purging of our hearts. It is to small purpose, for a man to
cleanse his hand, his foot, his eyes, his tongue, etc. so long as his mind
and heart remain polluted and unclean, there being a root of bitterness in
the heart and mind, it will ever be sending forth bitter and unsavory
fruits; yea, the greater and more excellent natural gifts of mind, a man
has, as wit, capacity, Note.
etc. the fitter instruments has he for the committing of sin, if they be
not sanctified; and therefore above all we are to look to our hearts. And that
we may so do, we must not only see gross temptations, but labor to find
out our inward corruptions, and the privy temptations of Satan laid against our
minds. The Apostle says, 2. Cor. 2.11. we must not be ignorant of his
enterprises, of his wiles and fetches, of his secret conueyance of sin into
our souls. For example, when Satan cannot fasten upon us either by violence or
fraud to do wrong to our brethren in regard of their goods, yet even then we
must not be secure, but stand upon our guard, and spy out whether he does
not cast into our minds, a secret liking of the goods of our neighbor,
tickling and deluding our hearts, and causing them to wish, Oh would such an
house, such a field, such a plat of ground, such a servant, or the like were
mine, for thus Satan will be tempering with our hearts, and thus many times
convey sin into them, when we see it not, nor think not of it, Saint Paul
himself thought not of the danger of this secret desire of heart, till he came
to behold himself in the glass of the last commandment, Romans 7.7. we must
therefore labor to find out these privy temptations, and fortify, strengthen
and guard our hearts against them, and repel them, and not suffer them to
enter. Men that look not into their own hearts, and find not out the
corruption of them, and watch not most narrowly over them, but only abstain
from outward gross sin (as most men if they come so far think all is
well) the Lord many times deals with them proportionably, even in this life he
lays his heavy hand upon the inward soul, Romans 1.28.
and torments the mind when the body is neither sick nor sore, for it is just
with the Lord, wherein we sin therein to punish us. As the Heathen regarded
not to know God, so the Lord in his just judgment gave them unto a reprobate
mind to do those things which are not convenient, as their sin was in their
minds, so his punishment seized and settled upon their minds. Let this stir
us up to labor to search our own hearts, and to find out the privy assaults
of Satan laid against them, and to arm our selves against them. The next thing
we have to mark, is that the Apostle says, their minds were set in evil
works, or were in evil, their minds were as it were hemmed in and enclosed
with sin before their conversion.

Such as be yet uncalled and not actually reconciled to God, are in the
greatest bondage that may be.
they are in the greatest bondage that possibly can be, their minds and all
the inward powers of their souls are enthralled in the bondage of sin, which
is the greatest bondage that can be, for why? even a gally-slaue under the
Turk, though he be in extreme hard servitude and bondage, yet his mind may
be at liberty, free from the chains of sin, but he that is uncalled, and
yet in his natural state, his mind is fettered and chained with sin, so as
he cannot think, will or affect any thing but sin, and this ought to be
considered, both to teach such as are called out of the state of their natural
bondage into the liberty of the sons of God, to be thankful to God for his
mercy, Thankfulness to God for deliverance out of that thraldom, and care to
hasten out of it being in it. Motives to that purpose.
and that they may have a true apprehension of their misery, and be stirred up
to hasten of it: let them consider these few things.

First, he that is in his natural state is a slave to God himself, and that
is clear by his slavish fear, for he cannot fear God as a child of God.

Secondly, he is a slave to good men, such as fear God, and in whom the graces
of God appear, they have and hold a kind of sovereignty over him, it is even
as hell to him to be in their company.

Thirdly, he is a slave to the world, and to the creatures in the world, as the
covetous man to his gold, some to the stars, some to days, as forsooth, this
is a dismal day, and therefore they may not take in hand any business that
day, some to the flying of a crow, the crossing of an an hare, and the like.

Fourthly, he is a slave to himself, either to his body, as the glutton and
drunkard, or to the passions of his soul, as lust, anger, envy; or to his
conscience, and that in respect of accusation, testimony and torment, his
conscience accusing for sin, makes him think every thing else does accuse
him, as the birds and such like; his conscience giving testimony to the
truth, many times against himself, as Moses says, their God is not as our
God, Deuteronomy. 32.31.
even our enemies being judges, his conscience tormenting him, so as many times
it makes him his own butcher.

These things well considered they are able to move any man, and will indeed
move him that belongs to God to look about him, and if he find himself in
his natural state, to hasten out of it, and that we deceive not our selves, as
many do thinking they are delivered from their natural state, when they are
not, let us examine our selves by this one rule.

See whether thou have suffered an holy and heavenly violence, in respect of
thy best pleasing sin, to which thou art most naturally inclined: if thou
find that the spirit of God working by the word, has drawn thee from under
the power and tyranny of that sin, that thou have not now such pleasure in
it, but thou do strive against it, and avoid occasions leading unto it,
then thou art entered into the way of life.

But if thou find thy self held in that snare of the Devil, 2. Tim. 2.26.
as the Apostle speaks, at his will, that so soon as occasion is offered,
thou do apprehend it, and that with much pleasure and delight, then surely I
can give thee no comfort, but let thee understand that Cain and Judas were as
near heaven as yet thou art. Let this be thought on and remembered.

VER. 22. In the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and
unblameable, and without fault in his sight.
Here we have part of that proposition, that is laid before us in these two
verses, expressing the material cause of the reconciliation of the Colossians
to God, in these words (in the body of his flesh through death) then follows
in the second amplification of the Apostles proposition, from the end of their
reconciliation in the next words (to make you holy and unblameable, and without
fault in his fight.

Interpretation.
Come we to the first of these, In the body, that is, in the body of his Son
Christ (it is added) of his flesh, to let us understand that Christ had and
has a true humane body, a body of flesh and blood, like unto ours in all
things, sin only excepted (through death) that is, through death of that
body, and so the words are thus to be conceived, as if the Apostle had said,
In the true humane body of Christ his Son, delivered to death, crucified and
broken upon the cross. I might here stand to show that Christ his body
crucified was and now glorified in heaven, is a true substantial body, a body
of flesh taken from the substance of the Virgin Marie his mother, and not a
fantastical body, a body in appearance only, a mathematical or maiesticke
body as the Vbiquitaries foolishly call it, who affirm that Christ his body by
reason of the personal union is every where present, but to pass by that.
Observe we that the Apostle said verse 10. it pleased the father to reconcile
al things unto himself, and to set at peace through the blood of his cross,
and here he says that the Colossians were reconciled in the body of his
flesh, hence arises this point of instruction.

That both the body and blood of Christ is the price of Both the body and blood
of Christ be the price of redemption.
and when we read of that we have remission of sins through the blood of
Christ, we must understand the whole passion of Christ, even his body broken,
and his blood shed, a point that need not be stood upon for the proof of it (no
question) we easily conceive and condescend to the truth of it, yet is it not
needles to be remembered, it may serve to direct our faith touching the death of
Christ that we are to eye by faith the body and blood of Christ for the
remission of our sins, we find it taught by Christ himself that to the
nourishment of our souls to life eternal, John 6.53. We are to eye by faith
the body and blood of Christ for the remission of our sins.
Except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no
life in you, and in the next verse whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood has eternal life, and our Savior has ordained in the Sacrament of the
Supper outward visible signs both bread and wine to represent and bring to our
remembrance both his body and blood, and to signify unto us that Christ is
distinctly set before us in the Sacrament, as meat and drink, and as perfect
spiritual nourishment to our souls yea Bellarmine himself the Arch-pillar of
the Roman Synagogue says in plain terms, that the form of bread alone does
not exactly represent Christ as dead, unless withal there be seen his blood
as shed, and the form of wine alone does not sufficiently represent Christ as
sacrificed, for (says he) only blood is no sacrifice; Confutation of the
Papists.
wickedly therefore deal the Papists, we may conclude against them out of this
their own mouths, who in the Sacrament of the supper take away the cup from
the people, and will not suffer them to have it; beside the breach of the
institution of the Sacrament, they go flat against the doctrine of the
Apostle, concerning one principal use of the Sacrament, which is to show
forth the death of Christ, which is lively done, when both bread and wine are
delivered, one for the flesh, the other for the blood and not otherwise, and
therefore he says, ^. Cor. 11.26.
as often as ye shall eat this bread and drink this cup, ye show the Lords
death till he come; yea, they are no less commanding speeches ver. 28. let a
man eat of this bread and drink of this cup, then that is, let a man examine
himself, it is therefore sacrilegious in the highest degree to withhold the
cup from the people, it destroys the integrity and soundness of the
Sacrament, and leaves to the people but a maimed and half matter of spiritual
nourishment in Christ, and an half satisfaction for their sins which is most
wicked and damnable: let us therefore hold fast and rejoice in the perfect and
most full ordinance of Christ, in that both bread and wine are delivered unto
us, and let us not forgo the comfort we may have in this point, that they are
visible signs of the body and blood of Christ, and do signify that by faith
we feed upon whole Christ, both his body and blood for remission of our sins,
to the perfect nourishment of our souls to life eternal. One thing further is
offered unto us from these words, I have heretofore spoken of it, ver. 14.
therefore I will only now recall it to memory. The Apostle says not simply,
in the body of his flesh, but adds through death, as before the blood of his
cross.

Hence we are taught: that we are not to fasten the eyes Christ his body broken
and his blood shed ought to be the object of our faith.
but upon his body broken, and his blood shed, especially when we come to the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Would thou receive grace, comfort, salvation
or any blessing from the Lord, come then to Christ hanging, bleeding and dying
upon the cross, Grace comfort and every good thing comes from God through the
death of Christ.
and by him suffering and bleeding on the cross (as one says well) there is
no hearing God, no helping God, no saving God, no God of mercy to thee at all.

Come we to the second amplification of the Apostles proposition in the words
following (To make you holy and unblameable, and without fault in his sight) the
word (holy) to omit other acceptions of it, does here signify pure, clean
from all spot of sin, for so the next words do expound it unblameable, and
without fault, Interpretation.
the word (unblameable) is given to Christ, he is said to be a lamb undefiled,
there is the same word that here is used, when therefore the Apostle says to
make you holy, and adds further unblameable, and without fault, his meaning is
this, 1. Pet. 1.19.
to make you pure and clean, so as you cannot justly be challenged, blamed or
reproved for any spot of sin: Now this holiness is twofold, either by
imputation of Christ his holiness or inherent in us, and that is only begun
in this life, and shall be consummate and made perfect in the life to come, and
that the Apostle does mean not only the first, but also the second, it is
clear by the like place, Ephesians. 5.26.27. where he sets it out in the same
terms, and says, it is wrought by the washing of water through the word,
therefore inherent holiness is only begun in this life, and to be made
perfect when we shall be personally set before the Lord, and shall see him
face to face in Heaven, so much also the Apostles phrase does imply, thus then
the words are to be conceived, to set you before his own face free from all
spot of sin by imputation of Christ's holiness, and by holiness inherent
begun in this life, to be made perfect when you shall see the Lord face to face
in Heaven.

Here first we are to mark that the Apostle says, the end why the Lord did
reconcile the Colossians to himself, communicating unto them the merit of
Christ Reconciliation with God and holiness inherent ever go together.
that reconciliation with God, and holiness even inherent begun in this life
ever go together. Whosoever is reconciled to God by the death of Christ, is in
some measure sanctified, and has holiness begun in him in this life, for
its the end the Lord does propound to himself in reconciling men unto
himself, and can the Lord be disappointed of his end? What shall withstand
him? Tit. 2 14.
again it is one end of the death of Christ to purge from sin, he gave
himself, says the Apostle, to redeem from iniquity, and to purge us to be a
peculiar people unto himself, zealous of good works.

Therefore, to whomsoever Christ is a Savior by merit to him also he is a
Savior by efficacy, these two are ever undivided.

They deceive themselves who think they have part in the merit of Christ his
death and yet want holiness.
how then do^ they deceive themselves, who think that the merit of Christ his
death belongs to them, and yet have not any measure of holiness in them, nay
whatsoever is holy they even hate to be drawn to it, whatsoever is unholy
they wallow in it, they tumble in it, they joy in it, yea, they even wish to
live in it, and grow old in it, such there be too many, and yet they fancy to
themselves, that the merit of Christ belongs to them, which indeed is a mere
fancy helped forward by strong delusion of the Devil: I may be bold to tell
thee whosoever thou art, for the Lord himself has taught me so to speak,
Heb. 12.14. If thou live not in some measure an holy life here, thou shall
never see the face of God to thy comfort and salvation, thou shall see him
indeed but to thy shame and confusion, so as thou shall call to the mountains
to fall on thee, and to hide thee, but in vain from his presence; let our
meditation a little settle on this point, and let us often think upon the
difference of holiness and profaneness, the one proouing unto us everlasting
joy with God when this life shall be ended, and the other assured woe with the
Devil and his Angels in the bottomless pit of hell for ever, if we
thoroughly think of this difference, we shall find it a peircing argument to
prick us forward to an holy life, it will doubtless force from us one of
these conclusions.

Now live like a Christian amongst men, and ever live like a Saint among the
Angels in Heaven, or now soake in sin and wallow in filthy pleasure for a
season, and then rot in the reward of it, an everlasting curse from the
presence of the Lord, in the pit of everlasting perdition.

One thing more briefly note we, the Apostle says, not to make you only
holy, but adds further unblameable and without fault in his sight,

Hence we may gather that where the Lord has begun The Lord having begun
true holiness in any he will perfect it. 1. These. 5.23.
whom he has begun to sanctify, he will fully perfect in the end, and this
is further clear by that prayer of the Apostle, Now the very God of peace
sanctify you throughout, this was a prayer of faith, he was persuaded the
Lord would sanctify them as himself says Phillip. 1.6. I am persuaded of
this same thing, that he that has begun this good work in you, Comfort to
them in who^ the Lord has begun the least measure of true holiness.
and this is a notable comfort to all such, in whom the Lord has begun the
least measure of true holiness, they may be sure he will perfect it.

Some complain of the want of sanctification (an holy complaint found but in
few) yet some thus complain that they find a dullness and deadness in
respect of all good motions, and the devil taking advantage upon this, many
times persuades them, they are fallen away, and God has given them over. Such
must know, it is a course ever held by the Lord, it is that which Gods chosen
have ever tasted, yet without reiection, they have had alterations in them,
sometimes sweet motions in their souls, sometimes deadness and dullness of
heart, what change think you felt David, when he cried, Psalm. 15.11. Oh cast
me not away from thy presence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me. If ever
thou have had the first fruits of the Spirit, an hatred of thine own sin, a
purpose of not sinning in any thing, though now deadness possess thine heart
yet content thy self, and wait for full holiness in time to be given: the
Lord has once begun holiness in thee, and he will perfect it. It is an
excellent place and to be remembered of us. We through the Spirit, wait for
the hope of righteousness through faith, The Apostle says not, Gal. 5.5.
they which are justified do in the spirit by faith yet feel the hope of
righteousness, but they wait still for it. So thou in the midst of conflicts
and terrors which often assault thee wayt patiently for righteousness and in
time it shall be revealed and made perfect unto thee in the Kingdom of heaven.

VER. 23. If ye continue, grounded and stablished in the faith, and be not
moved away from the hope of the Gospel, whereof ye have heard, and which has
been preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I Paul am a
Minister.
The relation of this verse, to the former stands thus, if ye continue in the
faith, ye shall be set in the sight of God holy and unblameable, therefore
continue in it, and so it also contains the first argument, by which the
Apostle labors to persuade the Colossians to continuance in the faith taught by
the Gospel, The fourth part of this chapter an exhortation to continue in the
true faith.
for there begins the fourth part of this Chapter, containing an exhortation to
continuance in the faith; urged by sundry arguments to the end of the chapter,
and the first argument is this.

If ye continue in the faith, ye shall obtain the end of your faith, the
salvation of your souls and this is not barely propounded, but amplified by
the manner of continuance, in these words, grounded and established, and
further cleared by the proper passion, or by the property of such as are
grounded and established, that they suffer not themselves to be moved away
from the truth in the next words, (and be not moved away from the Gospel.
Then follows the means how they came to have that hope of the Gospel
(namely) by hearing the Gospel preached, and least they should except and say,
the Gospel that we heard, we heard it only of Epaphras our Minister, and
we may doubt whether it be the true Gospel of Christ or no. This objection
the Apostle preuents by two arguments.

That first it was the same that was preached throughout the world.

And secondly, the same that Paul preached, and whereof he was a Minister: which
has been preached to every creature, which is under Heaven, whereof I Paul am
a minister. Come we to the word of this verse, Interpretation.
as they are laid down by the Apostle, and first of these words (if ye
continue grounded and stablished in the faith) the conditional note (if) does
not here imply doubting in the Apostle of the continuance of true believers in
their faith, as of an uncertain event, but the excellency and difficulty of
their undoubted continuance, and the Apostles earnest desire of the same and
that appears in that he thereunto persuades by many arguments, Phil 3.11.
we find the word so used in many places of the Scriptures. Look one for
many, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. The
Apostle does not there doubt of his resurrection, but by that conditional note
makes it known, how excellent a good thing it was, and how exceeding much of
him desired.

In the Faith] By Faith we are to understand the gift of Faith, together with
the matter of it (namely) the doctrine of Faith the Gospel, for the Apostle
here speaks of the gift of Faith, with reference to the doctrine of Faith, as
he explaines himself in the next words (hope of the Gospel) (grounded and
established) the words are Metaphorical, borrowed from known things. The
first from an house built on a sure foundation. The second from such as do
sit fast in a sure seat, to signify the firm and constant resolution and
condition of true believers, thus then the words are to be construed and
conceived.

If ye continue firm and constant in faith wrought in you by the Gospel.

Now for the ground of the first instruction, we are to mark that the Apostle
verse 4. said, he heard of the Faith of the Colossians, and here he persuades
them to continuance in Faith, the general conclusion following hence, is this.

We must not only begin well, but also continue in goodness.


The Lord does require us, that we not only like of good and godly motions for
a time, and after suffer them to vanish, to be quenched and dye in us, but that
we so begin that we may continue, and so continue in goodness that we may
endure to the end. To this purpose we find many exhortations, as quench not the
spirit, Stir up the gifts that are in you as fire is stirred up with blowing,
1. Thef. 5.10. 1. Cor. 6.13.
and stand fast in the Faith, the equity and reason hereof is twofolde.

Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end in many places of the Revelation,
and therefore he requires a good end as well as a good beginning.

Secondly, it is the property of true virtue not only to Paul blames the
Gallathians cap. 3.3. that having begun in the spirit would be made perfect by
the flesh, and our Savior shows what shame it is to him that begins to build
and cannot finish his work, Luke 14.30. this man began to build and was not
able to make an end.

To begin well and not to continue brings shame and therefore it is no true
virtue, for the crown of that is glory not shame.

Before we come to urge this duty, it will not be amiss to show some special
means how we may continue in goodness begun in us, for the means to that
purpose are not only general, as diligent hearing and reading of the word,
prayer, Sacraments, conference, good company, etc. but also more special, such
as serve peculiarly for the continuance and preservation of some particular
grace begun in us, for example.

A special means for continuance of humility begun in our hearts, Special
means for continuance of humility begun in us.
is a continual meditation of our own vileness and corruption, a looking on the
good things of other men as well as on our own good things, Philip. 2.4. A
consideration of our own gross sins.

A through examination without partial affection of the reports other men make
of us.

So a special means to continue love to the word of God when it is begun in
us, Special means to continue love to Gods word begun in us.
is

First to labor to have a lively sense and feeling of the sweetness of the
word. For the more we feel the comfort of it, the more we shall be enflamed
with a love

Secondly, to keep daily observation of the accomplishment in the mercies of
God promised to them that fear him, or in the judgments of God threatened
against the wicked.

Thus we find that David's love to the word was increased and continued. Psalm.
119.96.
I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy commandment is exceeding
large; then it follows in the next verse, Oh how love I thy Law, it is my
meditation continually. As if he had said, all things in the world, even the
most perfect come to an end, but not on jot or tittle of the word of God
fails, but all is accomplished, oh therefore, how love I thy word. I might
thus go on in many particulars, but by this that has been said, we have some
light given us, what special means we are to use for the continuance of any
grace already begun in us.

Now touching the continuance of love to the word, men have need a little to be
rowsed, for now generally men begin to decline and to fall from their first
love, Revel. 2.4.
as the holy Ghost speaks. We see the truth is of such majesty in it self,
as it captiueth the hearts of very reprobates unto a liking of it, but it is
only as a slash of lightning that comes, and is gone almost in a moment.
Motives to stir us up to continue love to the word of God.
That men therefore may be stirred up to continue their love and liking of the
word of God, let them consider these two things.

First, as it is not any sin, but continuance in that sin Revel. 2.10. and
I will give thee the crown of life.

Again, consider that his condition is better that never Mat. 12.45.
that the last state of that man is worse then the beginning, and there is
reason for it, for then follows hardness, impenitencie, and a greater weight
of condemnation, yea it is dangerous to fall from grace though it be but in
part, it made Paul in doubt of the Galathians cap. 4.20. If then we would not
loose our labor, and miss our reward; if we would not fall into such a
state, as is far worse than if we had never begun to do well, bringing with
it hardness of heart, and greater condemnation, let as many as have any love
to the word, or love to their brethren, any zeal of Gods glory, or other grace
begun in them, labor by all good means to continue and increase in the
same; shall the wicked be more constant in wickedness, then we in the fear
of the Lord? They serve the Devil, their own lusts, and their reward shall
be hell, and shall they be more constant in the service of the Devil, then
we in the service of our gracious God? let it shame us, of this we ought to be
ashamed indeed.

The next thing we have to mark, is the order of the words of the Apostle,
speaking of the manner of continuance in the faith. He says grounded and
stablished.

Hence we are taught, that we must first be grounded in We must first be
grounded in faith before we can be stablished in it.
First we must be firmly settled in the doctrine of the Gospel, before we can
be stable and constant in the profession of the Gospel. For why? in common
reason we know it to be true, that there is no constant stabilitie but upon
firm ground, an house or other building never stands stable and constant upon
rotten ground, or on a sandy foundation, and with this agrees that of James
cap. 1.8. A wavering minded man is unstable in all his ways, the mind or
heart being double and deceitful, the whole course of the life is answerable,
it behooues every one therefore to be well grounded in the doctrine of the
Gospel, yea such as are ignorant must be content, and think it no shame in
their old age to learn the Catechism, and first grounds of religion,
Ignorant persons must suffer themselves to be catechized in their old age.
that such as are ignorant, and not well grounded in the knowledge of the
truth, they lie open as a prey to Atheists and Papists, we see now the Papist
gathers ground upon us, and no marvel, because people are not well grounded in
the truth, the Jesuitical deceivers, and Romish rabble, besides their subtlety
of wit, whereby they are fit to deceive, they set many fair colors upon their
cunning persuasions, Seven fair deceiving colors of the Papists.
as first Scripture, but that by addition, detraction, or some allegorical
sense and gloss depraved; secondly, depth of learning, as Christ speaks of the
deepnesse of Satan, Reu. 2.24. and that confirmed by revelations; thirdly,
great and glorious titles, of Apostolical succession and antiquity; fourthly,
humility in voluntary subjection, and not sparing the body, as we read in
the second chapter of this Epistle 23. fifthly, fained and lying miracles, 2.
Thessall. 2.9. sixthly, flattering and fair speech, of which the Apostle
speaks, Romans 16.18. Last of all, obstinate suffering of death, wherein they
much glory, and how shall a silly unstable soul withstand these things,
surely without the great mercy of God, it is not possible, therefore men have
need to be well grounded: again consider such as are not well grounded in the
truth, they profit little, or nothing by sermons, a sermon to them is like a
great loaf set before little children, they stand and wonder at the preacher,
Note.
but profit little or nothing by the word preached, and if they see some men of
note fall from true religion, then they beg^nne to stagger, and are distracted
into sundry cogitations, and say there be so many opinions as they know not
what to hold, Peter playing the Jew, other Jews dissemble with him, yea
Barnabas is brought into their dissimulation also. We see then the necessity
of this duty, Gal. 2.13.
that it is needful to be grounded in the truth. Let us therefore never rest
till we truly understand the grounds and principles of religion, and be
settled, and fully resolved of the truth of them, that so we may follow the
truth in love of the truth, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 4.15. and that we may
cheerfully embrace it, and constantly hold it both in life and death.

For the grounding of the next point, we are to mark; the Apostle says not,
if faith continue grounded in you, but if ye continue grounded in the faith.

Hence I gather, that faith must not be built, and as it Faith must not be
built on our hearts, but our hearts must be built upon faith, as a firm
foundation.
Ierem. 17.9. are deceitful tottering seats, rotten foundations, but our
hearts must be built, and set upon faith as upon a firm foundation, we must
rise up as a building rises from the ground upon the foundation of faith,
(that is) upon the doctrine of faith, upon the doctrine of religion, and the
fear of God taught and comprised in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles,
in which sense it is said in express terms, that the Ephesians were built
upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. Ephesians. 2.20. (that is) upon
their doctrine, and Jude in his Epistle 20. exhorts to build our selves in
our holy faith, and the Apostle Paul taking his leave of the Church of
Ephesus, Acts 20.32. commends them to God, and to the word of his grace,
which (says he) is able to build further, etc. These and many other places of
like sort do meet together in this point of instruction.

That our hearts must be built upon the doctrine of faith, namely the Gospel,
yea generally upon the whole word, as a sure foundation, and not the word upon
our hearts.

Some may say, how is that to be done?

I answer,

Secondly, by yielding obedience unto it, for so our Savior says, Mat. 7.24.
he that hears of me these words and does the same, he is a builder upon the
word; yea, a wise builder, he builds upon it as upon a rock.

We see then that this duty is cleared, and the manner how to perform it made
known unto us.

Confutation of the Papists.
then certainly, we are not, as the Papists teach, to build upon the Church as
upon a foundation. They teach, that we are to ground and stablish our selves
upon the authority of the Church, and shame not to say, there can be no
certainty of the points of religion, no nor yet of the Scriptures themselves,
but only by the judgment of the present Church of Rome, this is contrary to
the doctrine now delivered, and pr^oued, and this makes the Church the
foundation of Scripture, and not the Scripture the foundation of the Church, as
indeed it is, and every member of the Church according to the doctrine of the
Apostle, must be grounded upon it.

Ob.
Yea, but says the Papist, how shall we know Scripture to be Scripture, but
by the Church, the Church does determine which is Scripture, therefore the
authority of the Church is greater than Scripture, and in this respect, as a
foundation, and the determination of Scripture to be Scripture, is built on
the universal consent of the Church?



Again, universal consent of the Church does not persuade the conscience that
Scripture is Scripture: It is not a sufficient ground to build upon, but only
as an inducement, it does move to a reverent regard of the writings of the
Apostles and Prophets, and thus says Augustine, Non credidissem scriptura nisi
me commouisset authoritas Ecclesia.

Is it so that our hearts must be built on the word, and not Reproof of them
that will have the word of God fitted to their hearts.
then such persons are far short of their duty, they come within compass of
reproof, who will have the word to be fitted and framed to their hearts, and
not their hearts to the word, this is to build the word on their hearts, and
not their hearts on the word, and indeed to turn the speech of the holy Ghost
to their own fancy, and to temper the word to their own humor, to set down
their own conclusion, and then force the word to prove it; you will say, is
there any such? too many without question, is it not thus with the Usurer, one
grounded in that sin, will not he, notwithstanding any reproof, by plain
evidence of Scripture still hold his conclusion, and resolve to continue in
his sin, and to that purpose take pains to seek out places of Scripture,
not to check his sin, and to build him up in holy reformation, but such as
may seem to him (blinded with the love of his gain) to favor his sin, is
it not thus with the drunkard, the unclean person, or any other gross and
grounded sinner? yes surely, as one says, no face is so foul, but it shall
find a painter: no sin is so gross, but some grounded in that sin will
seek to set a fair color upon it, and not only a common color, as to call
covetousness good husbandry, pride cleanliness, but which is most wicked, to
fetch painting out of the word of God (whence I beseech you) comes all
extenuation of sin, whence is it that men quarrel, and wrangle about the
nature, the greatness, the quality, or desert of sin, and say their sin
is not so great as Preachers would make it? but even from hence, that they are
tempering with some place of Scripture to fit that to their own corrupt
humors, and to make that serve for extenuation of their sin: (for example)
some are too bold with that of the Apostle: Love covers the multitude of
sins: they frame and construe too much to their own liking, even to back
them in their concealment and smothering of some gross sins, which they
ought to discover and make known, that they might be punished, to persuade
therefore to the contrary duty.

Motives to stir us up to frame our hearts to the word of God.
That we labor to frame our hearts to the word, as the building to the
foundation, and not the word to our hearts in any part or parcel of it,
consider we these two things.

First, such as frame the word to their hearts to abet them (go) it was Ahabs
case: 1. Kings 12. in respect of temporary destruction: he would have the
word of the Lord framed to the pleasing of his own fancy, going on in a
wrong course, therefore the Lord gave him up to follow the liking of his own
heart, and not to take counsel with Micaiah the true Prophet (verse 8.) but
with such as pleased his humor, who bid him go and prosper, when he went to
his own destruction.

Deuteronomy. 12.32. they either put something to the word, or take something from
it, by wrong construction, or application, they either add or detract, or else
it would never seem to boulster out sin, and then in what case they stand
let them see, even liable to all the plagues written in the book of God, and
to have their portion taken out of the book of life, Reu. 22.18.^9.
if then we would not be given over to the lust of our own hearts, to follow
it to our own destruction, if we would not have our portion taken out of the
book of God, and stand subject to all the plagues that are written in the book
of God, lets take heed we never go about to frame, the word to the corruption
of our hearts to uphold us in sin, but let us frame our hearts and make them
pliable to believe and obey the word in all things, yea never give thy self
rest till the word lie under thine heart even hid as David says, Psalm
119.11. as a foundation on which all thy affecti: ons and actions are grounded
and built, and pray ever with (David) in the same Psalm verse 36. Incline,
bend down mine heart unto thy testimonies: and not thy testimonies to my heart.

Now to the words following: (and be not moved away from the hope of the
Gospel:) by hope of the Gospel) we are not to understand the thing hoped
for, Interpretation.
(n) life and glory in heaven, as verse. 5. but the gift and grace of hope
wrought in the heart by the Gospel which is a certain, and patient
expectation of life eternal, purchased by the active and passive obedience of
Christ and promised in the Gospel to all that truly believe in him, and not
to be moved away from it, is not to loose it, not to let it fall out of our
hearts, and so the words are breefly thus to be conceived: and loose not your
certain and patient expectation of life eternal purchased by the perfect
obedience of Christ, and promised in the Gospel to all that truly believe in
him.

The first thing we have to mark from these words is, that the Apostle makes
it the property of such as are surely grounded, and established in the true
faith, not to be moved away from a certain expectation of life eternal.

Hence we conclude that true believers may have, and True believers may and do
certainly look for eternal life.
for why (hope is the daughter of Faith, and true Faith being a necessary
fruit ever following election, as appears plainly: Acts 13.48, and so an
infallible argument of confirmation to the soul of him in whom it is, that he
is elected to life and salvation, it must needs bring forth an hope
correspondent and answerable unto it, even a certain expectation of that which
is undoubtedly believed.

Again the hope of true believers comes from the testimony of the Spirit, and
is one of the fruits of Gods spirit as might be proved at large, and
therefore it is certain and sure.

Ob.
Yea but says the Papist, true faith may be lost, the testimony of the Spirit
may be extinct, the fruits of graces may wither and come to nothing, how then
can any man build on these grounds certain and never failing hope of life
eternal, Ephesians. 2.5.6.
and made to sit in certain hope of heavenly possession, upon the prayer of
our Savior that could not be in vain, but was heard of his heavenly Father:
Ioh. 17.20.21
upon the eternal love of God, from which nothing can divide us: Romans 8.39.
upon the unchangeable decree of God that stands fast for ever, sealed with
this seal, the Lord knows who are his. 2. Tim. 2.19.


A sure foundation of comfort to all true believers.
no, no, as many as truly believe, and have the witness of Gods Spirit, and the
fruits of his grace, they have a certain and immovable hope of life eternal,
and may rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious as says the Apostle, 1 Pet.
1.8.
and be thankful to God, for this inestimable gift, knowing this, that the
gates of hell shall never be able to prevail against them.

For concluding of the next point we are to mark the phrase and form of
speech used by the Apostle, he says not, and loose not by careless
negligence, but be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, this by
necessary implication poynteth out the state and condition of such as have
certain hope of life eternal (namely) this that their hope shall at one time
or other be assaulted, there shall be ever enemies that will set upon it, and
labor to drive them from their hold, yea says Luther, The hope of true
believers shall at one time or other be assaulted.
as soon as

Hence it is, Ephesians. 6.17.
that the hope of true Christians is compared by the Apostle to an helmet,
which as we know is a chief part of a Soldiers furniture provided to defend
his head, and put on to receive blows driven against his head in which
similitude is also implied one special reason, why the enemies of salvation
do chiefly set upon hope, and labor to move us away from our hope of eternal
life, because therein they strike at the head, even the head of all comfort, as
the Apostle says. 1. Cor. 15.19.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most
miserable. If our hope be confined to this life only, Note.
if our hope of eternal life be cut off; then farewell all the comfort of a
Christian, yea therein they strike at the head of all piety and religion, and
constant continuance in the fear of God, for this it was that made Moses
endure affliction without discouragement, Heb. 11.27.
his hope as an ankor was cast within the vail of heaven, and this indeed made
the Martyrs pass through the fire with singing and rejoicing, it was the Devils
drift in Jobs affliction to make him utter words of blasphemy and distrust,
Job. 13.15.
as appears by Jobs constant resolution to the contrary, if the Lord should
kill me, yet would I trust in him, yea further, the enemies of salvation
labor most of all against hope, Despair is a principal heresy.
to bring to despair, because that is a maine and principal heresy, it
denies God to be a Father, Jesus Christ a Savior, the holy Ghost a Comforter,
yea, it denies the love, the truth and the power of God, that God has any love
to mankind, truth in his word or power to perform his promise, and therefore
no marvel though the enemies of true believers bend their subtilty and
strength against their hope of life eternal. And these things make it most
plain, that so long as the Devil is the Devil, a roaring Lion, and thirsting
after nothing more then the blood of the Saints, our hope of life and salvation
shall never want enemies to assault it, but the Devil will one way or other
try, both his cunning by lies and errors and his strength, by violence to
move us away from our hope of life eternal, and therefore it behooves as
many as have this hope ever to stand upon their guard, to be ready armed and
provided against assaults, They that have hope of eternal life must be ever
provided to withstand assaults. Psalm. 119.116.117.
ever to pray with David, stablish me that in time of trial I be not
disapointed of my hope, stay thou me and I shall be safe, for if we upon our
hope, of eternal life in time of health, and out of trial begin to be quiet
with our selves, if we begin to be secure and presumptuous, let us be sure
we are not far from danger. We must consider that there is in them that
truly believe no such certainty of hope, as has in it no wavering or doubting
at all: no, no grace is ever for the time of this life mingled with the
contrary corruption, we must remember that we in regard of the infirmity of
our flesh are wavering and staggering, and have in us cause of humbling: that
so we may have recourse to the Lord by prayer to be stablished in our hope, and
then come hell, Devil, flesh, or any enemy of our salvation, if the Lord
stay us we shall stand fast, and be sure not to miscarry. Yea but will some
say, the Lord sometimes for the trial of the faithful, in the very act of the
assault, when Satan is laying siege to the consceience of true believers,
laboring by the sight of sin to drive to despair, the Lord seems to withdraw
his hand and to hide his face, his love and his mercy are so ouershadowed with
the cloud of present affliction that they cannot be seen.

What is to be done in such a case, and how then shall a man be able to hold
out,

To this I answer, Abraham as the Apostle says, Romans 4.18.
above hope when he had no reason to hope, then he hoped knowing the secret
power and working of the Lord.

Again, in such case we are to think upon the former and forepassed mercy of
God toward us, as David says, when his Spirit was in perplexity, within him
and his heart amassed. He remembered the time past and meditated in the works of
the Lord. Psalm, 143.4.5. but here will Satan lay before the conscience a
stumbling block and tell a man in time of conflict, that in this respect his
sin is the greater and more grievous, in that it has been committed against
so great mercy received, the greatness of mercy formerly received does
aggrauate his sin, therefore to help our selves again, and to repel and
beat back also this assault, we are further to call to mind, and remember the
examples of many servants of God as David, Peter, and such like.

To whom the Lord has remitted great sins committed after great mercy
received: And that we may set before us such examples for our comfort and the
confirmation of our hope, it is plainly taught by the Apostle Romans 15.4.
whatsoever things are written aforetime, are written for our learning, that we
through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. And that the
holiness of such men should not hinder us from looking on them for our
comfort: Saint James makes it plain in that particular of prayer, James 5.17.
where he says, the prayer of a righteous man avails much if it be fervent:
for example the prayer of Elias.

Ob.
Now some might say, Oh but Elias was a man endued with a rare measure of grace,
and we are far short of that holiness that was in him, this the Apostle
preuents, and says that he was subject to the like passions that we are, as
if he had said,

One thing further we may note from these words the Apostle says not, be not
moved away from hope at large, indefinitely, but from the hope of the Gospel.

Whence it follows, that the doctrine of the Gospel, The doctrine of the
Gospel only works hope of eternal life.
is that only which works in us hope and expectation of life eternal: it is
not the Law that can bring forth this effect, the Law properly works in us
no saving grace of faith, hope, or the like: hence it is, that the Law is
called a killing letter, and the Gospel only the word of life. 2. Cor. 3.
Acts. 5.26.
and the word of salvation, Act. 13.26. and many other places might be brought
to prove that the Gospel only works in us faith in Jesus Christ, and
certain hope of life eternal.

And first, this makes known that the hope of Papists is Confutation of the
Papists.
as their own words testify is grounded upon performance of those things God
requires of them, so far forth as they are able to do them, this hope is
rather of the Law then of the Gospel, he that will ground his hope upon
performance of those things, God requires of him, so far as he is able to do
them, has no reason in the world to hope for any good at Gods hand, for who is
so blinded with self conceit and bewitched with self love that sees not how
far short he comes of doing that he might do, both in the estate of nature
and grace to leave them therefore, and to apply the point to our selves, is it
so that it is the proper work of the Gospel to bring men to certain hope of
life and salvation.

Let us then further meditate on this point to this purpose, We must look
that the Gospel have the proper effect of it amongst us.
the Gospel sounding amongst us many years, let us therefore look that the
Gospel have the proper effect and work of it amongst us in this particular,
that it beget in every one of us a lively hope of eternal life, even a true
hope, not proceeding from Satanicall illusion or presumption, such as is the
hope of the greatest part in the world, but from good grounds from true faith
in Christ, and from the testimony of his spirit, and from the fruits of it,
look that we have such an hope, for that is the kindly and natural work of
the Gospel. And that I may not barely propound this without enforcement by
some reasons to move us unto it, consider with me these

First, if the Gospel have not wrought in us some measure

Note.
and we shall find it will answer, it is so far from finding comfort in
that, as nothing in the world does more gall and grind it, and there is reason
for it, because it has no part in that comfort, it is the case of the damned
in hell, their torments in hell are increased upon them by the consideration of
the loss of the comfort in heaven, they are not only tormented with pains of
sense, but of loss, so such as are in a desperate state, under a sense and
feeling of Gods anger: their desperation and their discomfort is greater in
consideration of the sweet comfort of the Gospel because they are persuaded
it belongs not unto them.

If then we would not find our selves (for any thing we know to the contrary,
in the same state with the Devil in hell, if we would not only be hopeless,
but even find our selves plunged (specially when the time of trial shall be)
into the depth of fearful desperation, let us be careful now while the
Gospel is sounding in our ears in this day of salvation as the Apostle
speaks, 2. Cor. 6.2.
that the Gospel may produce the proper fruit and effect of it in our hearts,
that we may have such an hope wrought in us by the Gospel as shall never
deceive nor make us ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost.

Come we to the next words (whereof ye have heard) these words contain a
specification of what Gospel the Apostle meant in the words before (namely)
that which ye have heard preached by Epaphras, wherein as we heard in the
resolution of this verse is implied the means how the Colossians came to have
hope of life and salvation (namely) by hearing the Gospel preached unto them,
the words in the original are thus, the Gospel which you have heard; there is
no difficulty in the words, for the sense they are to be taken in the proper
signification as they are laid down. The Gospel which you have heard, and
that preached unto you, for so much the words following give us to understand.
I pass over that which. I noted before upon the very same words verse 5.
the thing we are hence to observe for the ground of our instruction is this.

That the Apostle is not content to say continue grounded and stablished in the
Faith, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel in general, but he
adds further more specially, the Gospel which you have heard: the general
conclusion that comes from One special cause of falling back and declining in
any grace, is forgetfulness of particular doctrine heard preached.
in hope or any other grace is forgetfulness of those particular things which
we have heard preached unto us, when we decline or decay in religion in the
fear of God or in any other grace, it is by forgetting and letting slip out
of our minds the particular doctrine which we have heard and in former times
received. Reu. 3.2, Our Savior exhorting the Angel of the Church of Sardi,
being fallen into a drowsy security, to awake and strengthen the things which
remain, that are ready to dye, he sets down this as the means and remedy
verse. 3. remember therefore how thou have receiceiued and heard, and hold fast
and repent, thereby making known unto them, that forgetfulness of things heard
was the cause of their decay in religion, and the remembrance of them would be
a means of repentance and recovery, the holy Ghost Hebrews 12. persuading to
patience in time of affliction says, verse. 5. have ye forgotten the
consolation which speaks unto you as unto children? For so the words are to
be conceived, as uttered with an interrogation have ye forgotten? Heb. 12.5.6.7.
then he brings to their remembrance a place out of the old testament, my son
etc. whence it is clear that we are to conceive his speech as if he had thus
said, Pro. 13.11.
you ought not to forget the comfortable word of exhortation, you have
heretofore heard, and that has been taught tending to stablish your hearts
and to make you steadfast, by remembering it, you may he strengthened in
paience, and by forgetting it, you shall find the contrary effect, you shall
faint in your minds, and not be able to hold out in time of trial.

If therefore we would not decline in faith, in hope, and go backward in
grace and good things, We are to give diligent heed to things heard and not let
them slip out of our mind^. Heb. 2.1.
we are diligently to give heed to the things which we have heard that we be
not retchles, and loose hearers, that the things heard, run not through us.
Many things taught are heard of some with delight, their minds seem to be
ravished for the time with joy at the hearing of them, as Christ says of the
Jews, John was a burning and a shining candle, and ye would for a season have
rejoiced in his light, yet suddenly they slip away from them, John 5.35.
as if they had never heard them. This comes partly from the corruption of
nature, and partly from the Devil, heavenly things are so contrary to our
corrupt affections, that for them to abide in us is even like fire and water to
abide together, and the Devil does what he can to quench the light of them in
our hearts, and utterly to race out the remembrance of them, and not to leave
any print of them, let us then, knowing this corruption of our nature, and the
working of Satan, labor with care and diligence to keep things heard and
learned, let the remembrance of them be daily renewed in us by continual
meditation and thinking upon them, and to help us forward in this duty
consider.

First that by meditating and calling to mind things David's meaning when he
said he was wiser then his teachers Psalm. 119.99. and he makes this indeed
the reason, for thy testimonies are my meditation.

Again consider that the doctrine of the word heard Romans 2.16. at that day
God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel, if
then we do not call to mind and remember things learned: Note.
the doctrine heard shall at the day of judgment be a bill of indictment
against us, especially if we heard it with delight, and afterward have let it
slip from us it shall then leave us without all excuse, it shall be a bill of
indictment, and a fearful sentence of condemnation against us, and in
consideration of these things let us be stirred up to follow the council of
the wise man, both to take fast hold of instruction, Pro. 4.13.
and not to let it slip from us, let us keep it fast and sure when we have
laid hold upon it.

Now to that which follows. And which has been preached to every creature
which is under heaven, etc.) in these words is the first argument of
prevention, whereby the Apostle does prevent an objection of the Colossians,
they might say the Gospel we heard was only preached unto us by Epaphras our
minister, and we may doubt whether it be the true Gospel of Christ or no,
this the Apostle preuents.

First by this argument, that it was the same Gospel which was preached to all
nations of the world, for so the words are to be conceived, as appears
plainly by conference of those two places together Mark. 16.15. Interpretation.
Mat. 28.19. by every creature under heaven is meant all nations of the world.



Ob.
I answer as before verse. 6. that is to be understood of the profession of the
Gospel by public authority, the Gospel sounded forth in the days of the
Apostles to all nations, but it was not received by public authority till the
time of Constantine and Theodosius. The point I will observe from these words
having spoken of the same in substance ver. 6. it shall be from the purpose of
the Apostle in this place (namely) the preventing of that objection that the
Gospel they heard was only preached by Epaphras That is the true doctrine of
the Gospel that agrees with the doctrine of the Apostles preached to all the
world.
The Gospel you have heard is the Gospel preached to all the world, hence I
gather thus much.

That indeed that is the true doctrine of the Gospel which is consonant and
agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles preached throughout the whole world,
universality of doctrine, and general ouerspreading of it, is not sufficient
to prove it to be true, (for so any heresy may be forced upon men, unless it
consent with the doctrine preached to all the world, by the Apostles. Hence it
is that Paul says, Gal. 1.8.9.
and he doubles his speech that man or that Angel from Heaven must be accursed
and held in extreme detestation, that shall teach any doctrine not only
contrary but besides that we have been taught and have received from Paul and
from the other Apostles.

How shall I know that the doctrine now taught is agreeable to that which the
Apostles preached long since?

Look into the writings of the Apostles and Evangelists for there is not a
sentence that ever the Apostles taught but for the substance of it, Iraeneus)
by the will of God they afterward delivered in writings, to be a foundation and
pillar of our faith. Yea but will some say again, the writings of the Apostles
are hard to be understood.

How shall we then know what doctrine is agreeable unto them seeing the meaning
of the holy Ghost,

To this I answer: First, Peter 2. Epist. 3.16. things most needful to be
known and and believed to salvation, may come to be known by diligent
reading and hearing, attentive marking, earnest prayer and judging of them in
humility,

Again, we must know there be two things specially aimed at in the writings of
the Apostles. 1. The adua^cement of the name and glory of Christ Jesus. And 2.
the spiritual worship and service of God. Any man by diligent reading may
observe these two things principally driven at in all the writings of the
Apostles, and therefore that doctrine is agreeable unto them that sets forth
Christ unto us with all due regard of his glory, in the work of redemption and
salvation, with due respect of the honor of his name as the only King, Priest
and Prophet of his Church, and does urge upon us spiritual worship and service
of God standing in mortification of the flesh, newness of life and spiritual
obedience.

Thus we may know what doctrine is agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles.

We must not be discontented with doctrine plainly delivered because it is
common.
Then let us take heed of discontment with doctrine plainly delivered unto us,
because it is common, and because we have heard it many times before, for why?
the same doctrine must still be taught that was taught in the time of the
Apostles, and that doctrine is only good, it is the vanity of man's nature, not
to be content with good things, because they are common and ordinary, but it is
the worst kind of discontent to be displeased with things pertaining to
salvation, Note.
it is worse then if a man should not like wholesome meat set before him to day,
only for this, because he fed on the same dish yesterday, to be discontent
with the word, because we have heard the same thing before, is the itching of
the ear foretold by the Apostle* 2. Tim. 4.3. the time will come when they
will not suffer wholesome doctrine, but having their ears itching, and the
Apostle there says, this itching is found in them that follow their own
lusts. And let men take heed they follow them not to their own destruction,
for it is just with the Lord to harden our hearts, and to close the eyes of
such as hear the word only for fashion, and think themselves already
abundantly skifull. He has said by the Prophet Isaiah 66.2. To him will I
look, and to him alone that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles
at my words (that is humble in his own eyes, receiving the word with
reverence, hungring after it as the food of his soul, and saying in his heart
as Samuel did, 1. Sam. 3.10.
speak on Lord for thy servant hears, (Whereof I Paul a^^ a Minister) This
is the second argument preventing the former objection. The Colossians might
have made, the Gospel they had heard was the same Paul himself an Apostle
preached, that which hence is to be noted is briefly this, that Paul calls
himself a Minister of the Gospel, wicked therefore and blasphemous are those
scoffing speeches Scoffing and blasphemous speeches against the Ministers of
the Gospel.
of Harding against Jewel, and the like many times belched out of the mouths
of Papists and Atheists against the Ministers of the Gospel, your
Minister-like talk, your Ministership, etc. these blasphemies against the
sacred name of minister, which the word so often uses, as Saint Paul is not
ashamed to take to himself) are against the word of truth it self.

VER. 24. Now rejoice I in my sufferings for you, and fulfill the r^st of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake which is the Church.
In this verse we have the second argument of the Apostle persuading the
Colossians to continuance in the faith, the argument is from the end of the
Apostles own sufferings being prisoner at Rome, that he suffered affliction
for the confirmation of the Colossians in the faith and for the whole body of
Christ which is the Church, this argument is amplified by the manner of his
sufferings and the subject of them. The manner, that it was with rejoicing and
the causes of that were two, first, because his portion was allotted unto him,
employed in that word (fulfill) secondly, because his afflictions pertained to
Christ, and were the rest of his afflictions (and fulfill the rest of the
afflictions of Christ) then he makes known the subject of his suffering
(namely) his flesh, these be the things g^nerally comprised in this verse. Now
to the words as they are lay down by the Apostle, Interpretation. Genesis 3.1.
and first of these words (No^ rejoice I in my sufferings for you) the word
(Now) is not here a note of time but of transition, as now the serpent etc.
((...) my sufferings) that is in respect, or for my sufferings, a man may
happily rejoice in time of suffering for some other thing, but the Apostles
meaning is for, or in respect of hi^ sufferings for you (that is) for the
confirmation of you in the doctrine of the Gospel, and the encouragement of
you constantly to suffer for the Gospel, if you be called unto it.

The first thing hence to be observed is the argument of the Apostle, he makes
his imprisonment and his sufferings for the Gospel, an argument of
confirmation to the Colossians, to persuade them to continue in the faith.

The sufferings of Gods Saints are profitable not only to themselves but to
others also. 2. Cor. 1.6.
either for their own trial, for the correction of things amiss in them, or
as marks of their own adoption, but unto others, who either behold or hear
of them, the sufferings the Saints of what kind soever are profitable, not
only to themselves but to others also. The Apostle says whether we be
afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation, which is wrought in the
enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer, where we see he sets
down a double use and profit of his afflictions, reaching beyond himself to
the Corinthians (namely) their consolation and salvation, their comfort and
their encouragement in the like sufferings, the Apostles afflictions were
profitable to the Corinthians for their salvation, only as a means and
helping cause, and not as meritorious, but only to help them forward in the
way of salvation, for further proof of this, consider the several sorts of
the sufferings of the Saints, they are either corrections of their sin,
trials of their faith of their obedience etc. or testimonies of their
profession of the Gospel, as when they suffer as Martyrs, sealing their
profession of truth, with the suffering of any torment, yea, to the shedding of
their blood in all these we shall find that their sufferings are not only
profitable to themselves, but to others also, as first their sufferings in way
of correction are not only means of good to themselves, but documents and
warnings to others, to make them wary and careful to avoid the like sin,
thus were the sufferings of David, after his sin was pardoned. 2. Sam. 12.14.
because he was a public person and by his sin had opened the mouths of Gods
enemies, he suffered the loss of his child, that by his suffering orhers
might learn to take heed of the like sin. Again, their suffering in way of
trial are in many places of the Scripture set before us, for for the working
of patience in us, Iam. 5.10.11. Take (my brethren the Prophets for an ensample
of suffering adversity and of long patience, which have spoken in the name of
the Lord, behold, ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have known what
end the Lord made.

Last of all, their sufferings in way of testimony are notable means of
confirmation and encouragemens of oothers to the like sufferings, the stories
of the primitive times of the Church, are full of examples, it is very
memorable that is written in the Ecclesiastical story of the city of Edessa,
a city of Mesapotamia, Ruffinus lib. 2. cap. 5. it is there said when the
Christians by the decree of the Emperor were banished all Churches they met in
fields, which being espied of the Emperor, in great rage he struck his
chief captain with his fist, demanding why he did not thence also drive them
as he had commanded upon this, his Captain purposed the very next day to
destroy them, yet his affections arising against so cruel a fact, he secretly
lets fly abroad, that the next day he would destroy all that were found at
those meetings, hoping thereby to warn them to abstain from coming thither,
but see the powerful working of the bloody persecution of those days for the
confirmation of men in suffering for the truth, the next day Christians,
though before admonished of the danger, yet flock thither in greater number
then before, yea they run headlong, and make have as men afraid to come too
late to suffer death, among the rest the captain observed a woman to run
with such have out of her house, as that she neither stayed to shut her door,
nor to put on her clothes as womanlike modesty required, and in her arms she
carried a little infant, when the captain saw it; he commanded the woman to
come before him, and being come, he asked her whether she made all that have;
into the fields (said she) where the Christians meet. And have thou not heard
(said he) that the chief Captain is going thither to put to the sword all
that there he finds; yes (said she) I have heard it, and therefore I make
have that I may be there when he comes: but what will thou do with that
little infant (said he)? Take it with me also (said she) that if the Lord will
it may also be vouchsafed martyrdom: by this and many other examples that
might be brought, it is most plain that the sufferings of Saints in way of
testimony, are notable means to encourage others to the like sufferings.

We are to profit by our consideration of the suffering of Gods Saints.
let the saying be found true in us in respect of other men's sufferings (...)
let the afflictions of others be our instructions, let their corrections warn
us to be more wary, and to be more careful to avoid the like sins, let
their trialls build us up in patience, and holy obedience, and for the
sufferings of the Saints in former times as Martyrs, we are not to let the
remembrance of them vanish and fall out of our minds without profit to our
selves: indeed will some say there is use to be made of the suffering of
Martyrs, if we should fall into the like times, they did, then by them we
might be encouraged to the like constancy, and they might work in us like
resolution.

But what use can we now make of them in the days of peace?

Very great good use, they serve not only to seal,

Surely then the hearing of these their sufferings ought to make us to forgo
the sensual pleasures and profits of this world which cannot stand with the
keeping of Faith, and good conscience, did the holy martyrs in former times
suffer the loss of their lives by fire, faggot, and most exquisite torments, to
maintain the truth of the Gospel, and wilt not thou by their sufferings be
moved to suffer the want of so much as a cup of beer or wine not needful, or
the want of some carnal pleasure for the keeping of faith and a good
conscience? it seems it is not the same religion and Gospel now professed by
thee, and heertofore maintained by them? yes surely, but thou art not the like
affected professor of the same Gospel, it has not yet the same powerful
working in thy heart: and know it for a truth, that if the sufferings of the
Martyrs, they suffering loss of their dearest blood, have not thus far
profited thee, to move thee to suffer the loss, and the cutting off of thy
dearest sin; thou have not yet made a right use of them, and certainly, as
their sufferings were testimonies of the truth and power of the Gospel, so
they shall one day be so many witnesses against thee, they shall be as
Abraham's prayer was for Sodom, sweet smelling sacrifices to God in themselves,
but serving for thy deeper condemnation; as Abraham's prayer was accepted of the
Lord, and yet Sodom was destroyed.

Now rejoice I, etc.] not to say any thing of that, might hence be noted, that
we are to suffer affliction with joy, I stood on that verse 11. we are further
to mark that Paul rejoiced that his sufferings were for the good of the
Colossians, he was glad, and it did him good at his heart, that his sufferings
were for their good. Hence I gather that We are to be glad if in any thing we
may do good to Gods Church though it be to the shedding of our blood.
we are cheerfully to lay down our lives for the glory of God, and for the
furtherance of the salvation of our brethren, John 4.34. we have the example of
Christ laid before us, who took such delight in doing the will of his Father,
as it was even meat and drink to him to do it, the work of redemption, the
conversion and bringing of Gods chosen to the knowledge of their salvation, he
says it was his repast, it was even as meat and drink to him, we find a
worthy speech of the Apostle, Acts 20.24.
he says though the holy Ghost did witness and let him understand that bands
and afflictions did abide him, yet says he I pass not at all, neither is my
life dear unto my self, so that I may fulfill my course with joy for the good
of the Church of God,



Mat. 25.40.
yea to suffer, and shed our blood, if it may be for their good, this being
so that we are to rejoice and to make it the joy of our hearts, if we may do
good to our brethren by suffering and shedding of blood, then surely it
follows necessarily, we are to rejoice to do them good, We are to rejoice
in doing good to our brethren in discharge of our duty.
wherein we come not so far as to shed one drop of our blood, let this
teach us to shake off sloth and sluggishnes in doing public duties for the
good of our brethren, any man may see it, that many that are in place and
office to do good to others, go heavily and sleepily about public
business, every man almost is of such a leaden heart and heavy spirit in doing
the duties of love to his brethren as the things done, when they are done, are
neither pleasing to God, nor truly comfortable to men. Therefore a little to
awake and to stir up such men as are heavy hearted and drowsy in doing
service by love to their brethren, according to their place, calling and
ability consider we these things. Motives.


First in doing good duties with cheerfulness we are Deuteronomy. 30.9.
what better example then this to follow.

Secondly thereby we testify our communion with the

And consider yet further, if our work of love be Gal. 5.6.
and such as love is we may gather faith to be, if then we be slothful in
performance of the duties of love to our brethren, it will seal up unto us a
fearful conclusion, that our faith is indeed but a fancy, and our hope
suitable, such as in the end will confound and make us ashamed.

If then we desire to be like the Lord himself: if we would testify our
communion with the Saints of God, if we would not seal up to our hearts that
we have no true faith in Jesus Christ, and no sound hope of life and
salvation, let us be moved to discharge public duties that concern us, and
to do service to our brethren with alacrity, with joy and rejoicing, let us
shake off immoderate love of our selves, Note.
which causes men to make idols of themselves, to dream of nothing but their
own good and profit, for that indeed makes a man's heart that it cannot be
extended it is the mother of covetousness and many foul sins as appears.
2. Tim. 3.2.


Now before we come to the causes that moved the AApostle to rejoice in his
sufferings, I will stand a while to remove a misconstruction of this text, and
false collection that is made by the Papists, from these words of the Apostle,
In that the Apostle says (Now rejoice I in my sufferings for you, and fulfill
the rest of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodies sake the
Church. Hence they gather and conclude.

That the sufferings of the Saints are meritorious and satisfactory for
themselves and others, and that the sufferings of the Saints do satisfy the
justice of God for temporal punishment due, not only for their own sins,
but also for the sins of others, which collection is full of contumely and
blasphemy against the infinite merit and satisfaction of Christ his death and
passion, I might show the error of this conclusion by many places of
Scripture, the Apostle says, 1. Corinthians 1.13. was Paul crucified for you, as
if he had said, it is blasphemous once to think that either Paul or any
other but Christ was crucified for us, but that we may easily see the
weakness, and indeed the wickedness of this collection: The weakness and
wickedness of a popish collection from this verse discovered.
I will make it plain and evident that it is repugnant and contrary to the
words of this verse, and that this text which they bring as a strong argument,
to prove humane satisfaction is altogether against themselves.

Reasons against it.

First therefore consider that when the Papists describe unto us, what be
their satisfactory punishments, then forsooth they reckon up fastings,
sackecloth, pilgrimages, Paul were among the sufferings which the Papists
would have to be penal and satisfactory.

Paul spoken of in this place were punishments for the sin, either of
himself or of others were most absurd it has not so much as likelihood or
show of truth, it is clean against the text which makes known the Apostle
suffered for the name of Christ, and for the maintenance of the truth of the
Gospel, that is the argument of the Apostle, and so much is implied in the
word translated (fulfill) (...), vicissim impleo, I fulfill in the name of an
other (that is) of Christ and so much also is expressed in that the Apostle
calls his afflictions the afflictions of Christ, thereby giving to understand
that he suffered in and for the name of Christ, for that is one reason why the
sufferings of the Saints are called the sufferings of Christ, as says Peter 1.
Epistle 4 14. rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings
etc. then verse fourteen, if ye be rayled on for the name of Christ, blessed
are ye, for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you; which on their part
is evil spoken of: but on your part is glorified; where he makes it plain
that one reason why the sufferings of the Saints are called the sufferings of
Christ, is because they are suffered for the name of Christ, shall we then say
that the sufferings of Paul here spoken of, were sufferings for sin? it is
most gross, aliud est pati pro peccatis, aliud pro Christ^. Thus we see this
very text which the Papists would force to maintain humane satisfactions, it
bears strongly against them.

Ob.
Yea but says the Papists, by your leave, the Apostle says he fulfilled the
rest of the afflictions of Christ, whence it is clear (say they) that the
sufferings of Christ and of his members make one mass or one body of
sufferings, the sufferings of the Saints are the plenitude and fulness of Christ
his sufferings, and so by virtue of that union that is betwixt Christ and his
members, their sufferings receive influence and virtue from him to be
meritorious and satisfactory.

they are not one by personal union, Note.
Christ and the Believer are two distinct parts, now personal union is the
ground of merit in Christ himself, for his manhood apart, and by it self
meriteth nothing) but as it is received into personal union with the Godhead,
they must then prove which they are never able to do) that we are received
into unity of person with Christ before their conclusion will follow that by
virtue of our vnio^ with him, the sufferings of the Saints do merit and
satisfy. Thus then we see the the error and weakness of that popish
collection from this verse, that the sufferings of the Saints are meritorious
and satisfactory.

Come we to the causes that moved the Apostle to rejoice in his sufferings in
these words (and fulfill it, etc.) the word translated (fulfill) as we have
heard, it signifies not only to fill up the measure, but to do it in the name
of another, and the Apostles meaning is, in the name of Christ (the rest of the
afflictions of Christ) for the understanding of these words, Interpretation.
we must know that the sufferings of Christ are of two sorts, either such as he
suffered in his own person for the redemption of his Church in way of
satisfaction for sin and expiation of sin, whereof the Apostle spoke before
in this chapter: or such as he suffers in his members and in the whole Church
to the end of the world, when his members suffer in way of conformity and
similitude with Christ their head, then Christ accompteth their sufferings as
his own, hence they are said to have fellowship with him in his afflictions,
and to be conformable unto his death, Phi. 3.10. and of this second sort, the
words of the Apostle in this place are to be understood (The rest of the
afflictions of Christ) (that is) those afflictions that remain to be suffered
in way of conformity with Christ (in my flesh) (that is) which are appointed
unto me to suffer in my body, thus then we are to conceive the words of the
Apostle as if he had said, and fulfill up that measure of affliction allotted
unto me as a member of Christ, and remaining to be suffered by me in his name
by way of conformity unto Christ.

The first thing we have here to mark is the word used by the Apostle, he
says not bear the rest, but fulfill, whence we may take up this instruction.

The afflict o^s of the godly are measured out unto them the good proprouidence
of God.
when they are under affliction, they are filling up of an appointed measure,
how much or how little every one shall suffer is appointed in the eternal
council of God, and it was not appointed that every particular person should
suffer, all and every sort of affliction, but that every member in the body of
Christ should suffer some in one sort and measure and some in another. We
find the truth of this in Joseph's affliction, Psalm* 105.19. it is said they
held his feet in the stocks, and he was laid in irons until his appointed
time came and the council of the Lord had tried him he was afflicted, but how
much, or how long? even so much and so long as the Lord had appointed, until
his appointed time came. This also is clear in the bondage of affliction of
the Israelites in Egypt their affliction was measured and foretold, Genesis 15.13.
and when the measure was full and the time expired, the self same day they
were freed from it: howsoever there may seem to be some difference of time
mentioned in those two places, Exodus 12.41.
yet if we reckon the 400. years from the birth of Isaak and 430. from
Abraham his first coming into the land of Canaan, they are easily reconciled
and prove the point in hand. And to this the seventy years ^^thing mentioned
Ierem. 25.22. that also proves as much. And thus I might go on from one
example to another, and all meeting in this point delivered that the
afflictions of the godly are measured out unto them in Gods good providence, We
must not limit the Lord when we are under his hand in any afflictions.
things not only come to pass which God has appointed, but as he has
appointed concerning the manner and measure.

How then is it so that the afflictions of the godly are measured out unto them
in the good providence of God then we must learn, when we are exercised under
the hand of God, not to limite the Lord, not to appoint him, how much or how
long he shall afflict us, not to be content only for a day or two, or while
we think good and then begin to shake off the yoke of the Lord, but even so
long to endure the affliction with patience as he has appointed, ever
remembering that our affliction is measured out unto us by the good and gracious
hand of God, even by that hand that will be sure to keep measure and
moderation (which is a notable comfort) so says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 10.13.
God is faithful, and will not suffer his children to be tempted above that
they are able, but will even give the issue with the temptation, that they may
be able to bear it. Mark (I beseech you) the Apostle makes the Lords keeping
of measure and moderation in afflicting of his children, no less sure then it
is that God is faithful, and can God be unfaithful? If he can, then think
he will exceed the measure of our strength in afflicting us, if not, be of
good comfort, for so certain it is that he will keep measure in our
affliction, as he is faithful that can be no other, a sweet foundation of
comfort in the greatest affliction, join to this the example of the Israelites
before spoken of Exodus 12.41. verse. Mark it, the Lord did not break with
them one day, no not one hour, or minute of the appointed time of their
deliverance, and be thou sure of it, that even days and hours of comfort fit
for his children as they are known to the Lord, so are they always observed
of him most graciously and most precisely, why then should we tie the Lord to
our time and to our will, or else we faint, we fall, we speak or think
amiss, that the Lord regards us not, has forgotten us and forsaken us, or the
like, learn never to do it, let us never thus wrong our good and gracious
God, but let us in time of our affliction pray that the Lord would out of his
mercy consider our strength, and according to his promise lay no more upon us
then he will make us able to bear and that he would give the issue with the
affliction in do time to his glory and our good.

Ob.
Now here an objection made by some occasioned from this doctrine is to be
removed, by some such as are delivered out of trouble by means condemned in
the word, (as by witches and wizards) may say and that truly their measure of
trouble was appointed of the Lord, that so much they should endure and no
more, and these being the means of their deliverance, doubtless they were so
appointed of the Lord, and therefore may lawfully be used?





as a curse to them, that are so delivered, Note.
and without their unfeigned repentance, for the further increase of their
condemn^tion, for as heretofore I have showed, when as the means of getting
health, wealth, etc. are evil, it is therefore revealed that the Lord does
fully purpose ^o curse men, even in those good things, and that is a heavy
curse.

The second thing we have to mark is the next word here used (rest) the
original word ((...)) signifies the residue, remainder, hinder part or
remnant, etc. that which hence follows is this, that the afflictions of the
The afflictions of the members of Christ are but as remnants in respect of his
sufferings
are but as small remnants and relics of Christ his sufferings, What we that
are members of Christ do suffer, be it to the shedding of our blood by the
sharpest and most exquisite torments that can be devised, yet it is but a
remnant in comparison of Christ his suffering this we shall find confirmed by
further evidence of Scripture, Isaiah, 63.3. I have trodden the wine press
alone, and of all people there was none with me. Says Christ of himself, the
Evangelists set out in many words the bitterness of Christ his sufferings, as
that his soul was heavy to the death, his cries strong, Oh Father if it be
possible let this cup pass from me, his prayer was so vehement, his agony so
great, that blood for sweat burst out of his body. His complaint was that he
was forsaken, an Angel was sent to comfort him, and these do make it very
plain, that he endured greater pains then ever did any, and that the
afflictions of his members though they be martyred, yet are not comparable to
his sufferings, they are but as a dram in respect of the infinite weight of
pain laid upon him, it is easy to make this further clear by the strength of
reason. As

First, Galath. 3.13. he was made a curse for us; but in the afflictions of
his members, the Lord does moderate his anger, and in justice remembers mercy,
yea the curse is removed from them according to that in the place before
cited, Galathians 3.13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law when
he was made a curse for us.

Again, the Lord does ever in wisdom proportion out affliction according to
the strength of the afflicted, and the end of their afflictions, he knowing
their strength, and wherefore he does afflict them, hence it is that he says,
Isay. 57.16.
he will not contend for ever, neither well he be always wroth. Now we must
needs confess that Christ his strength did far surpass the strength of any
of his members, yea, of all his members, being God and man, he was able to
endure the whole wrath of God, and the end of his suffering was satisfaction
for sin, and of theirs only correction, trial or testimony in way of
conformity to him, and so far inferior to the end of his sufferings therefore
the afflictions of the members of Christ are not to be compared to the
affliction of Christ their head.

And this being so, that the afflictions of the godly be they never so
grievous, are but as a remnant in comparison of Christ his sufferings, then
whenever thou art afflicted, When we are afflicted we must consider what
Christ has suffered for us.
a little pain in the least part of thy body so bitter, consider then what
bitterness was in the whole sufferings of Christ, he drunk^ the full cup of
the bitterness of Gods wrath, thou do only taste it, or rather not so much
as taste of it, to teach thee to consider what Christ has suffered for thy
redemption, and that this consideration may be more profitable, learn to
extend it a little further after this manner, happily thou art pained with the
gout, the stone, the wind cholicke the toothache, or some such grinding and
griping pain, and to be eased thou can be content to wish thy self out of
the world; let this lead thee to consider the infinite pain and torment of
Christ his sufferings, and wtthall consider thine own sin, by which thou
do add and put new passions upon Jesus Christ, for thy sin does in a
second degree torment him again, will thou confess that the pain of a tooth
is so great, that in regard of it thou could wish with all thy heart to be
out of the world to be eased of that pain, Note.
and yet will thou not stick by thy sins, to add new torments to Jesus
Christ, whose torment once far exceeded the greatest pain and torment thou
can possibly endure; this is most savage and brutish cruelty, yea, such as is
beyond all the degrees of comparison, matchless cruelty, will thou (as much as
in thee is) add torments to him that shed his blood for thee, and suffered the
extremity of Gods wrath for thee, if men when they are pained, would be led
forward by that pain to behold the bitterness of Christ his painful
passion, and withal, that their sin is a further degree of torment unto him,
doubtless it would make them (if hell have not full possession of their
hearts) careful to avoid sin, yea, it would take from them all colorable
excuses, commonly fetched from the Devils storehouse, as that they are not
alone, that they are provoked and drawn on by company and the like, the
swearer and the drunkard will plead that they forget themselves, that they are
carried away with company; and will thou so forget thy self, and so run on
with company, posting and making haste to hell, and again pierce the sides of
Jesus Christ? will thou (as much as in thee is) heap new passions upon him? Oh
remember the bitter passion of Jesus Christ, and learn to be reformed.

Again, are our afflictions we being members of Jesus A check to that secret
thought arising in the heart of Gods child afflicted that never was any in the
like case that he is in.
never was any so grievously afflicted as he is: thus was it with Job 6.2.3.
he complained his grief and misery was heavier then the sand of the sea. Thus
the Church in great distress calls to them that pass by the way to behold
and see if any sorrow be like unto her sorrow. If such a thought enter into
thine heart in time of bitter affliction, learn to check it by this, Lam.
1.12.
look upon the bitter passion of Christ, and remember that the wave or billow
of Gods wrath did light upon his head, and all that thou do suffer is but a
flash of water breaking off from that wave or billow: but here the Devil has
found out a shift when a man comes to some that are afflicted, and sets before
them the bitterness of Christ his passion, and tells them they ought to look
upon that, and to remember that their affliction is nothing in comparison of
his sufferings.



I answer Job, of Abraham, of David, etc. men eminent and endued with a great
measure of strength, then certainly, their pain and affliction was greater
then thine, and thou art not tried and afflicted like one of them.

It follows (the afflictions of Christ) In that the Apostle calls his
afflictions the afflictons of Christ, I might stand to show that the
afflictions of the members of Christ reach up to Christ himself, which may
strike amazement and terror into all that wrong them, and may comfort them
that are wronged with assurance that the Lord Jesus will not suffer himself
long to be pinched in his members, he has experience of their miseries, and
has learned to be compassionate toward them, but this I have handled at large
verse 15. and let me add only thus much The Lord Jesus does know and
acknowledge his members in their greatest distress.
their affliction cannot divide betwixt him and them, and make him hide his
face from them: the Lord calls the Israelites his people, when they were
plunged in their deepest distress, Exodus 3.7. and in many other places of this
book, The Lord therefore is not like the proud people of the world.
who know a man in a gay coat or high place, but in poverty and baseness
will not vouchsafe to look upon him though he be most near unto them in
blood and kindred, it is not so with the Lord, but in the poorest plight, when
the backs of his children are bare for want of clothing, their faces lean,
quite altered with brinish tears, that have worn furrows in them, their
heads hang down for grief, and all their bones are disioynted with racking
tortures of bloody tormentours, even then does the Lord know and as graciously
acknowledge them for his own, as he did in their prosperity and chiefest
outward comfort. If we further follow in our meditations it will minister unto
us matter of sweet comfort.

Come we to the last thing to be stood on in this verse in these words (in my
flesh) The Apostle does here restrain his sufferings spoken of to his own
person, and withal does point out the subject of his suffering, that he being
now in prison, his body was afflicted, that we may The persecutors of the
Church ^n only w^^ch the (...) of Go^ ^^^^dre^ (...)*


That the persecuting enemies of the Church and of the members of Christ can go
no further then the body, they cannot come to the soul to hurt that, the soul
is free from the rage and violence of all Satan's instruments as our Savior
has taught, Mat. 10.28.

Objection. O^^^^*
But will some say they can make men abjure and renounce Christianity as the
Turks do at this day?

Note.
and so die, and yet go to heaven, and we are not by any outward thing in this
life or death, to judge of his estate before God, so a true Christian may be
forced to abjure Christianity, and yet still remain a true Christian, all the
Tyrants in the world are not able to hurt his soul.

We are not to fear them who can only kill the body.
but cannot kill the soul, and for our further encouragement herein, consider
but this one thing, are we the children of God and members of Christ, then the
Lord has delivered us from the power of sin and Satan, and the bondage of
unruly lusts, which are enemies to our souls and salvation, and is not he then
able, and also willing in his good time to free us from weak men, who can
only touch our flesh? yes doubtless, let us make no question of it, but
remember it and be strengthened in the time of need.

VER. 25. Whereof I am a Minister according to the dispensation of God, which
is given me unto you ward, to fulfill the word of God.
These words are a further amplification of the Apostles second argument, and
contain in them, first a reason of the Apostles suffering for the Church,
because he was a Minister of the Church (Whereof I am a Minister.)

Then secondly, a limitation of his Ministry, in respect of his Ministerial
charge, that he was appointed a Minister of the Jews, but of the Colossians
and the rest of the Gentiles in these words, according to the dispensation of
God which is given me unto you ward, wherein we have three materials to be
considered.

First, his Ministry which he calls a dispensation of God.

Secondly, how that was conferred upon him that it was given him.

Thirdly, the special reference and relation of it, unto you-ward.

Then follows the end of this dispensation thus given unto him in the last
words (to fulfill the will of God)

Come we to the words as they are laid down by the Apostle, Whereof I am a
Minister (that is) of which Church I am a Minister: I might here urge it
against the Papists, that the Apostle explaines himself how he suffered for
the Church, not as a Mediator between God and the Church, but as a Minister
of the Church, not to satisfy for others, but to minister to their faith by
confirmation and strengthening of it, by his example and patience, but of this
we spoke before in the former verse.

Observe we, that the Apostle says, he was a Minister of the Church, the body
of Christ; he says not that he was a Minister at large, the word Minister
being a word of relation, but he sets it down with this correlatiue the
Church, that his ministry had special reference to the Church of Christ, and
to the true members of Christ, and not to any other; Hence arises this point
of instruction.

That the outward ministry of the Word and Gospel is The outward Ministry of
the word is ordained properly for the good of Gods Church.
and with special respect to the true members of Christ, either actual or in
Gods election, all ministerial actions, as preaching the Word, administering
the Sacraments and the like, have special relation to the good of Gods chosen,
and this point is plainly propounded and laid before us by the Apostle, Ephesians.
4.12.
together with a reason of it in the verse before, that to this end Christ
ascending gave gifts unto men, some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some
Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers for the gathering together of the
Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edification of the body of
Christ.

The ground of this is the order which the Lord has made known that he holds
in bringing of his chosen to life and salvation, that whom he has
predestinate, them he does in time effectually call, and the ministry of the
Gospel is by him appointed an instrument and means of effectual calling, by
the preaching of the Gospel, men are called: Now effectual calling properly
belongs to the chosen of God, and therefore the ministry and means of salvation
has proper reference to the good of Gods chosen.

Ob.
But will some say, the word is to be preached to all, the commission was
general, go teach all nations, Mat. 28.19. and preaching is not limited in
respect of the flock committed to any man's charge?

Answer.

2. Cor. 2.16.
Now the application of this point might be to teach the wicked, how much they
are beholding to the chosen of God, Note.
for whose sakes they are partakers of the sound of the Gospel, which
sometimes works restraint in them from the outrage in sin though no
renouation, and so their judgment shall be the easier in that respect, yea the
continuance of the world is for the sake of Gods chosen, when their number is
full then shall the end be But let us rather think upon this doctrine to this
purpose, it is so that the ministry of the word by man, is appointed properly
for the good of the body of Christ, Trial of our selves whether we be true
members of the Church or no.
hereby we may know it, the Ministry of the word is ordained for the good of
Gods chosen.

If then thou receive good by it, it is a sure sign of election to life and
salvation; it is the mark Christ himself has set upon his sheep; Ioh. 10.27.
they hear his voice sounding in the ministry of the Gospel, and they follow
it, they are bettered by it: but if thou either wilt not hear it, or hearing
it carest not to follow it; but a drunkard before, a drunkard still, filthy
before, and filthy still, a worldling before, and still devoted to the things
of this earth, and minding earthly things, to what fold thou do belong, thy
self and others may easily judge, surely to the fold of goats, not of sheep.

To drive this a little deeper, that this may profit and move thee hereafter to
a further profiting by the ministry of the Word, consider these two things.

First, if the Minister would gain and gather thee to God and thou refuse, thou
must know that thy wilful refusal to be gained and gathered, is the immediare
forerunner of judgment, and of thine own destruction, and there is reason for
it, God has so threatened, Prou: 1.27. Zach. 7. From ver. 11. to the end, and
it is a resistance of the spirit of God, Acts 7.51.
and it is the ripeness and full growth of sin to hate to be reformed: Mat.
23.37.
Mark what Christ himself says, as he was a Minister of Circumcision, he
would have gathered them together, but they would not, therefore their
habitation should be left unto them desolate.

Ezekiel speaks of chap: 33.31. let him know the day shall come when his ears
shall hear, (will he, nill he) that which shall make his heart ache, go thou
cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, let these
things stir thee up to think upon it, how thou do profit by the ministry
of the word, and assure thy self Gods purpose cannot be frustrate, if thou
belong to him, his minister is sent for thy good, and thou shall receive good
by him, if not thou shall be hardened in thy sin and heap up wrath against
the day of wrath.

Come we to the Apostles limitation of his ministry in regard of his
ministerial charge in these words (according to the dispensation of God. Which
is given me unto you-ward) the words here translated (Dispensation of God)
are not to be taken as sometimes they are used, Interpretation.
for the providence of God as we use to say, by the merciful dispensation of
God (that is) by his good providence, because the providence of God cannot be
given, as the Apostle says, that this dispensation was, but they are to be
conceived as the original words do signify, according to Gods stewardship,
(to you-ward) (that is) in respect of you Colossians and the rest of the
Gentiles as we have it, Galathians 2.7.

The first thing we have here to mark is, that the Apostle calls his
ministry a stewa^dship given of God.

Hence we see that the minister of the Gospel, lawfully The minister of the
Gospel lawfully called to that office is Gods Steward.
he is set over the household of God, his Church as a steward over some great
family, hence it is that Paul says to Timothy: these things write I unto thee,
that thou may yet know how thou ought to behave thy self in the house of
God, and in his Epistle to Titus 1.7. in express words, a Bishop or
Minister is Gods Steward, 1. Epist. 3.14.
yea he would have all men so to esteem of them, let a man so think of us as
of the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God. 1. Cor. 4.1.
Where the Apostle also so makes known what be the things committed to the
Ministers of the Gospel to dispense and dispose of (namely) the secrets of God
(that is) the doctrine of the Gospel, which is a secret and a mystery hid from
the eyes of the world, (so called by the Apostle in the next verse of this
chapter) and the doctrine of the Gospel being the word of reconciliation
publishing remission of sins to all that truly believe it, and repent of their
sins, hence it is that the ministers of the word are said to have the
ministry of reconciliation committed unto them, and as stewards to have the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, 2. Cor. 5.18.
to open or to shut heaven according to the condition propounded in the Gospel
(that is) to declare and pronounce remission of Mat. 16.19.
and that Gods mercy is shut up from them that are unbelievers and unrepentant,
thus are the ministers of the word, Gods Stewards to dispose of his secrets
after his will, and good reason that his will only should rule in his own
house.

And therefore for the use of this in the first place the ministers of the word
must take notice of it, that they have only as the stewards of God, the
ministry of reconciliation to declare to the penitent remission of their
sins, and not power to forgive sins, Ministers of the Gospel have only as
stewards the ministry of reconciliation to declare to the penitent remission of
sins, and power to forgive sins.
as that man of sin the Pope does challenge to himself, who in his
blasphemous poenam and culpam punishment and sin, When the minister of God
pronounces remission of sins to the penitent and shuts up Gods kingdom
against the impenitent, it is as if God himself should do it.
and the ministers of the word have only the keys of ministry in respect of
Christ whose stewards they are to open and shut according to the will of their
master revealed, and not at their own will and pleasure.

A second use of the doctrine now delivered may be this is the minister of God,
Gods Steward to dispose of his secrets according to his will, surely then when
the Minister does so, when he does pronounce remission of sins to the
penitent, and shut up the kingdom of heaven and Gods mercy from the
impenitent, let us learn to account it, as if God himself should do it; for
hence it is, that the Ministers of the Word are said to remit or retain sins,
because they declaring by the Word remission of sins to the penitent, Ioh.
23.23.
and retaining of sins to the impenitent, it is as certain, as if God
himself should pronounce it from heaven: it is said Exodus, 14.31. the people
believed the Lord and his servant Moses, giving us to understand, that though
faith respect God only, yet is there such an Union betwixt him and his
Ministers, as indeed and truth we cannot believe him unless we also believe
his Ministers, speaking from him, let us therefore think upon it, and
especially when they shut up the kingdom of heaven, when they denounce the
judgments of God against us for any sin, every man will be ready to take
hold of the Word of mercy, and esteem that as the Word of God himself, but
in the word of threatening and denouncing of judgment, men make a division
between God and his Minister: let us take heed of this, and know for a
conclusion of this point, Note.
that if we divide between God and his Minister in the word of threatening, the
Lord will punish us in the same kind, he will divide between him and his
Minister in respect of us in the word of mercy, and in his just judgment he
will make his word of mercy, but as the word of man unto us, it shall be
unprofitable unto us, we shall find no true comfort by it; remember the
example of Herod, he divided between God and John in the word of threatening for
his sin, and the Lord made all that he heard from John, even the things that
he heard gladly to be unprofitable unto him he lived and died in his sins.

Now to the second Material 2 Material.
in the Apostles limitation how this dispensatio^ was conferd upon him in these
words (which is given me) the words are plain, and are to be taken in their
proper signification which is freely or of Gods grace bestowed upon me, in
that the Apostle says his ministry and dispensation in the Church of Christ
was given him, it points out first this general instruction, No man ought to
undertake the office of a Minister of the word unless it be given him of God.
but he to whom it is given of God, (that is) he that is inwardly called of
God, furnished with competent measure of gifts, both of mind and will for the
discharge of that office and has also outward approbation of the Church, and
for this there be many reasons.

First, because it is Gods order appointed in his Church, Romans 10.15.

Secondly, the ministry is Gods, and not man's, and therefore

Thirdly, unless they be sent of God they cannot gather

The use Confutation of an Anabaptisticall fancy.
who think that any man upon a private motion may step forth and undertake the
duty of a public teacher, and may preach and expound the Scriptures, and they
allege for themselves that such motion is from the spirit of God, but
(indeed) it is rather from another spirit even from Satan and from their own
pride and vanity, and it is an opinion foolish and fantastical, I will spend
no more time in confutation of it.

We are to mark that the Apostle speaking of his ministry and stewardship in
Gods house, an eminent office, and of excellent dignity, has an eye to the
first cause and fountain of it, that it was given and bestowed upon him,

Hence we are taught, that in all the good things of this life we enjoy, In
all the good things of this l fe we do eni^y, we are to look up to the giver
of them.
be it dignity, office in the Church, or in the commonwealth, be it health,
wealth, liberty, credit, stock or store, we are to lift up our eyes to the
hills from whence any of these good things come down, we are to look to the
fountain whence our stream has issued, even to the mere grace and mercy of
God, we find it was common and frequent with our Apostle thus to look upward
to the author and giver of every good gift, 1. Cor. 15.10. by the grace of God,
I am that I am. Ephesians. 3.7.8. he says he was made a minister of the Gospel
by the gift of the grace of God, even to me the least of all Saints is this
grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ, Gal. 1.15.
that he was called by the grace of God, this was commendable in the Apostle,
and is worthy our imitation, and it is a duty of great good consequence.

This duty practiced works in us first thankfulness. Secondly humility. 1.
Cor. 4.7.
nothing is more effectual to draw out thanks for good things received of men
then to know the things given to be mere gratuities above desert, and merely
from the bounty of the giver.

Again it is a notable means to humble us, shall we know the good things we
have are received from the mere grace of God, and shall we then be proud of
them? it is the Apostles conclusion, what have thou that thou have not
received, and if thou have received it, why reioycest thou, as though thou
had not received it? let us remember this duty, Note.
and the rather because it is the corruption of our nature to rest in the
things given and to forget God the Author and giver, to eat the bread, and not
to see God in the bread as says Luther. Moses knowing this inborne corruption,
Deuteronomy. 6.12.
gives this caveat, beware least, etc. and this corruption was grown to full
ripeness in Nebuchadnezar Dan 4.27. is not this great Babell that I have built
for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of
my majesty? Motives stirring us up to the practice of this duty.
and we know what followed he was driven out from men to live with beasts. Let
us take heed God deal not with as he dealt with him, we may justly fear it,
if we have not hearts to see and consider the mercy unto us, that he will
drive us out among beasts (that is) in his just judgment give us the hearts of
beasts, hearts taking sensual delight in those things we enjoy, ever groueling
upon them, and not able to lift up themselves, toward which is an heavy
judgment.

And consider we further whence it is that men see not 1. Cor. 3.21.22 23.
and out of them they are but curses, it is not possible that a wicked man who
finds not Gods grace in Christ, should see his mercy in outward things, for
(indeed) they are not given to him in mercy, but in judgment, as his portion,
and as witnesses of his unthankfulness, as it is said, God left not himself
without witness in doing good, giving rain and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness, and to leave him without excuse.

If then we would not (by the just hand of God) be given over to live as bruit
beasts amongst men, feeding and fatting our selves with Gods blessings, and
wanting eyes and hearts to see and consider his mercy in them, if we would not
prove to our selves and against our selves that we see not Gods grace in
Christ, let us learn to raise up our thoughts to see Gods grace and mercy in
the outward good things of this life given, and bestowed upon us that so we
may be thankful to him for them, and use them not to riot excess, bravery,
and to set out, and to magnify our selves above others, but to the glory of
him that gave them, and to the good of our selves and others.

It follows (unto you-ward) in these words we have the Paul's Apostleship had
special relate to the Gentiles.
in respect of you Colossians, and the rest of the Gentiles, that which I will
hence observe shall be this.

That the ministry and Apostleship given to Paul had special relation to the
Gentiles, yea he was appointed by special vocation the chief Apostle of the
Gentiles, as Peter was of the Jews; it appears plainly Gal. 2.7. and we
find it in many places of the acts, that Paul's commission was specially to
preach to the Gentiles, Acts 4.9. If any say the commission of the Apostles was
general, Acts 13.2. Acts 26.17.
this power and liberty was given, yet afterward it pleased the Lord in
wisdom for good causes to order it by a second decree, that Paul should
specially have care of the Gentlies, I say specially, for though Paul
(occasion being offered) preached to the Jews, they being dispersed among the
Gentiles, yet was he still the chief Apostle of Against the supremacy of the
Pope.
from Peter, the Scripture is plain that Peter was not chief Apostle of the
Gentiles, therefore admit the Pope to be his successor, and to have his
authority (which no wise man will grant being Apostolical) yet cannot be thence
derive his authority and power over the Gentiles, they might more probably
convey his title of supremacy from Paul, then from Peter, and indeed being
driven from this by plain evidence of Scripture, they would craftily seem to
derive their Popes authority from both Peter and Paul which is but a mere
shift, if they hold their own principles it is impossible.

In the last words of this verse (to fulfill the word of God) we have the end
of the Apostles ministry, that he was a minister of the Church to fulfill the
word of God, by the word of God we are here to understand the Gospel as
appears in the next verse, Interpretation.
and to fulfill it is to publish and to preach it and the preaching of the
Gospel by the Apostle is called a fulfilling of it, because by it the Gentiles
were called as was foretold by the Prophets, and that work being wrought and
fulfilled on them by the preaching of the Gospel, the preaching of it is
called a fulfilling of it.

That which hence is offered to our consideration is from the form of speech
here used, the Apostle says not to preach the Gospel but to fulfill it hence
follows this conclusion.

That the Gospel truly preached is not an empty word, The Gospel truly
preached is not an empty word. 2. Cor. 3.8. Gal. 3.2.
but a word filling those that belong to God with grace and goodness, and the
true preaching of it is powerful to that purpose.

Hence it is that the Apostle calls his preaching of the Gospel, the
ministration of the spirit, he says the Galathians received the spirit by the
preaching of the Gospel and herein lies a principal difference between the
Law and the Gospel. The Law does not minister the spirit, but by the preaching
of the Gospel the spirit is given.

This must teach us to make a precious account of the preaching of the Gospel,
We are to make precious account of the preaching of the Gospel. 2. Tim. 3.15.
which has with it (in them that belong to God) the operation of his spirit,
and is powerful to bring them from ignorance to knowledge, from darkness to
light, from the power of Satan to the glorious liberty of the sons of God,
and to make them wise to salvation, and let us look on our selves in our
natural condition before the preaching of the Gospel has wrought upon us,
what are we? surely, blind and ignorant of the ways of God, walking in the
darkness and vanity of our minds, rushing into errors, breaking out into
blasphemies, running into all sorts of sin, yedding to the suggestions of
Satan, embracing the vanities of the world, following the swindge and
corruptions of our own hearts, and lying open to the wrath and and judgments
of God, these things ought to move us to make special account of the Gospel
preached, which does in as many as it is powerful, inform the judgment,
reform the will, order and sanctify the affections, and bring into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.

The Gospel preached gives the Spirit, Note.
the Spirit begets Faith, Faith apprehends Christ, and Christ brings salvation,
therefore make precious account of the preaching of the Gospel.

VER. 26. Which is the Mystery hid since the world began and from all ages*
but now is made manifest to his Saints.
This verse, for the connection looks up to the former as an explication of
that the Apostle said in the end of it, of what word he spoke (namely) of that
Which is the Mystery hid since the world began (that is) the word of the
Gospel, and for the matter and substance of this verse it contains a third
argument to persuade the Colossians to continue grounded in the faith.

The argument is taken from the excellency of the Gospel, that the Gospel is
a hidden and deep Mystery and so of great excellency, therefore being preached
and revealed unto them, they ought to make precious account of it, and to
continue in the sound profession of it.

The order and disposition of this verse in it self is on this manner.

First, we have an instance or particular insisting in that part of the word of
God, that the Apostle was to publish, even that which is the Mystery.

Secondly, to this is subioyned a distinct and different condition of this
Mystery in respect of distinct and different times that it is.

Hid and Manifested.
Hid in respect of former and foregoing times in these word. Hid since the
world began.

Manifested in regard of time present, but now is made manifest.

Thirdly, to this is added the persons to whom it is manifested in the last
words to his Saints.

Come we to the particular examination of the words and first of this Mystery
hid in these words, which is the mystery hid since the world began. Under the
word Mystery, that we are to understand the Gospel it is evident by the
context, for the Apostle says in the verse before, Interpretation.
it is the word of God, and in the verse following, that word, that has Christ
for the matter of it, and that is only the Gospel. Now the Gospel which
contains the doctrine of the humiliation, exaltation, humanity, divinity,
office of mediation and all things concerning the life and death of Christ is
called a Mystery because it is wonderful; deep, secret and unsearchable, for
that is the proper and natural signification of the word ((...)) (Mystery) and
we shall find in Scripture this word always used to signify a thing secret
in religion, Ephesians. 5.32. the Apostle speaking of the near union and
conjunction of Christ and his Church says, (...), this is a great secret, we
have there the same original word, that here is used (hid) or rather as the
original word is, (has been hid) since the world began, the words are from
worlds) the meaning is from all eternity, and from all ages, (that is) from all
generations of the world, till the coming of Christ in the flesh, the Gospel
was hid from the Gentiles simply, and from the Jews comparatively, in
comparison of the clear lighr and manifestation of it since the incarnation of
Christ, so does the Apostle expound himself, Ephesians. 3.5.
Which in other ages was not opened as now it is revealed unto his holy
Apostles and Prophets by the spirit.

Thus then the words are to be conceived, even that secret and unsearchable
doctrine of the Gospel which has been hid and kept secret from all eternity,
and from all generation of the world, simply from the Gentiles, and in
comparison from the Jews before the incarnation of Christ.

Here first let it be observed in a word against the false and deceitful
dealing of the Papists that the word (...) is translated by them a Mystery in
this verse and in the A popish deceit discovered.
next verse Sacrament thereby laboring to maintain the false opinion grounded
on Ephesians. 5.32. that Matrimony is a sacrament, and so they translate that
place, and thence would they ground it, but (indeed) the opinion is erroneous
and false and that text will not warrant it, for the opinion it self, it
cannot be that matrimony should be a Sacrament.

Reasons proving Matrimony to be no sacrament.

First, because it was ordained in Paradise before the fall, but the Sacraments
of the new Testament were ordained after Christ his coming in the flesh.

Again, a Sacrament of the new Testament is an outward seal of Gods grace
unto salvation, a seal of the righteousness of faith, so says the Apostle,
which Matrimony is not, neither can the Papists ever prove it so to be, and
therefore no Sacrament, and for the ground of their opinion, they merely
wrest, and pervert the text, for the Apostle does inplaine terms avouch that he
speaks concerning spiritual marriage between Christ and his Church, this is a
great secret, but I speak of Christ, and his Church.

Again, to say that Matrimony is a Sacrament, because the word (...) Mystery
is given to it, is most absurd and foolish, Romans 4.11.
for they might as well say, that the Gospel it self is a Sacrament, which in
this text is so called, but that were as gross as to say, the seal and the
writing are all one, for Sacraments are seals of the covenant of grace written
in the Gospel, yea, they might as well affirm that the close working and
secret insinuation of Antichrist into the Church of God is a sacrament, which
is called a Mystery, but a Mystery of iniquity, 2. These. 2.7. yea also, that
name written in the fore head of the whore, Reu. 17.5. How absurd and foolish
then it is to say, that Matrimony is a sacrament, because it is called by the
Apostle (...), a Mystery, any man of the meanest capacity may easily discern.

Let it be further observed that the word of the Gospel has this tittle given
to it, that it is a mystery, a deep secret and hidden doctrine, the
consideration of this does offer this conclusion.

That it is no easy matter truly to understand, know It is no easy matter
truly to understand know and believe the Gospel.
a man cannot easily come to have knowledge and faith in the secrets of the
Gospel needful to be known, and believed to his own salvation, for proof
of this, that one place is sufficient, 1. Tim. 3.16. without controversy great
is the Mystery of godliness, the doctrine of godliness, the Gospel, is not
only a mystery, but a great Mystery full of secrets and of exceeding
profoundnesse and depth, and it is so without all question or controversy, the
word signifies by all men's confession that it is an opinion or truth generally
confessed of all, and that the Gospel is not easily coneeiued and believed, it
were easy to give instance of particulars, we preach Christ crucified unto
the Jews, even a stumbling block, 1. Cor. 1.23.
and unto the Grecians foolishness. Acts 17.18.
The Athenians the wisest of all the Heathen, said Paul was a babbler or
trifler, and setter forth of strange gods, when he preached Jesus, the very
substance of the Gospel and the resurrection. Yea, come we to those that make
profession of Christ and of his Gospel, some of them are natural and carnal,
and cannot perceive the things of the spirit of God. 1. Cor. 2.14 others are
regenerate and perceive them, but it is only in part, and that by the special
gift of God, Mat. 13.11.
and the reason of this is, Romans 2.15.
and since the fall we have some remainder of it in us: We must take heed we
deceive not our selves touching our knowledge and faith in the promises of the
Gospel.
but the Gospel the ground of it being Jesus Christ, is above the reach of
nature, created of nature in the state of innocence, and much more of nature
corrupted, and therefore it is no easy matter truly to conceive and believe the
doctrine of the gospel, and this must teach us to take heed we deceive not our
selves touching our knowledge and faith in the promises of the Gospel, if we
never felt the mighty and powerful work of God, or the working of his mighty
power, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 1.19.
to work in us understanding and faith in the Gospel, but have a faith easily
conceived without any supernatural work: We have indeed no true faith: it is
the faith of the greatest number in the world, even a faith conceived without
any hardness or pains at all, a faith conceived only by tradition, because
they are bred and borne and brought up in the bosom of the Church, and have
heard it delivered in the Church, that Jesus Christ came into the world, took
our nature on him, and suffered death on the cross, thereupon they conceive in
mind a bare persuasion that Christ is their Savior, and they can repeat and
patter over all the Articles of the Creed, yea, some are so grossly ignorant
as they repeat them as a prayer, which is ignorance as thick as the darkness
of Egypt, it is palpable and may be felt. Thus many do, and presently they
imagine they steadfastly believe them, without finding any hardness in the
matter, or any unbelief in their hearts, in respect of any one article of the
Creed, I appeal to men's consciences in this case, yea, the speech of many
ignorant persons makes it known, being asked whether they believe the articles
of faith, their answer is ready, they never doubted of any one article in all
their life, they believe them all.

Now what is this though we seem to renounce Popery, but indeed to fall into a
dangerous error of popish learning, to have an implicit faith, a faith
wrapped up and enfolded in the general, to believe as the Church believes,
which is a faith easily and soon conceived, to believe as the Church believes
without further ado. We must therefore remember what has been now
delivered, that it is no easy matter, truly to know and believe the doctrine
of the Gospel, Note.
the Gospel of Christ being the material object of faith, and the mercy of
God in Christ for the remission of sins the formal object of it, are great
and unspeakable mysteries, and cannot be comprehended without much hardness,
and much striving against natural unbelief and know it for a truth, we never
truly believe the Gospel to salvation, till we can say with a true feeling
of our own weakness and want of faith, as he said in the Gospel, Lord I
believe, Lord help mine unbelief, till we find and feel the power of Gods
spirit in us, ouermastering our natural hardness and our unbelief, touching
the secrets of the Gospel, and know for a conclusion of this point, that faith
easily gotten, is but a fickle and loose imagination, and in time of trial or
temptation or great affliction, it will fail us, it is a faith of nature and
reason, and not of the spirit of God, and when nature and reason fail, that
faith cannot stand.

I will add one other short use of this doctrine, is it so We must come to
the hearing of the Gospel preached with humble hearts. 1. Pet. 1.12. Iam. 4.6.
an heart emptied of all swelling conceit, for such as have it are unfit to
receive the wisdom of God, they are ill disposed to receive it, yea, God does
resist them, God resists the proud etc. the word signifies that God does set
himself as it were in battle array against them, to fight with them, and
therefore will not reveal his secrets to his enemies, being to fight with them:
pray we then ever with David, Psalm. 119.18. Open mine eyes that I may see the
wonders of thy Law. That I may see the wonders and great mysteries of thy
Gospel, yea, let us not rest in that we conceive of our own heads, out of the
word of the Gospel, or that we hear and learn of our Teachers, but let us
strive with God by prayer to be also inwardly taught by his Spirit; for here is
one cause why some fall from that they have heard and learned, Note.
because they pin their faith on the sleeue of their Teacher, and if he fall
they fall with him, because their ground is gone. Let as many as desire to
continue steadfast in the truth, never rest in that, they have conceived either
of themselves or by the teaching of men, but crave that the Lord by his spirit
may instruct them, and then no doubt the Lord will not send them away empty,
but will so season their hearts by his grace, that though thousands fall away
on every side, yet they shall continue steadfast in the truth taught and
received,

(hid since the world began) that is, as we showed from all eternity, is
plainly euinced and proved unto us, the eternity of the gospel. That the
gospel is the eternal word of God hid in God, The Gospel is the eternal
word of God.
and as ancient as God hhimselfe. Ephesians. 39.


The inference upon this by way of use might be to prove that the sending of
Christ into the world was decreed that the permissio of the fall of man was
decreed, and his redemption by Christ also was decreed in the eternal council
of God, but I pass by these things, these things are more fit to be examined
and discussed in the schools, yet let the eternity of the gospel be thought
on as many as truly believe the promise of the gospel, The eternity of the
Gospel is a ground of sound comfort to all true believers.
it may serve to strengthen and confirm them in never failing comfort for as
many as by true faith rest upon the promise of the gospel touching remission
of sins and justification by Christ may be sure that the ground on which they
rest will never fail them, the gospel is eternal coming out of the bosom
of God the Father, therefore as immutable and unchangeable as God himself, and
as impossible it is that he that does rest upon the promise of the gospel,
touching life and salvation, should be deceived as he that rests upon God
himself, who cannot possible lie nor deceive, all the promises of God in
Christ are, yea, and Amen says the Apostle, 2. Corinthians. 1.20. that is, they
are certain; and infallible, and Heb. 6, 18. the promise made to Abraham, and
in him to all the faithful is joined with the oath of God, and the holy ghost
there says: these are two immutable things wherein it is impossible that God
should lie: that as many as have refuge to hold fast the hope that is set
before them might have strong consolation, and let as many as truly believe
think upon it to their comfort.

It follows (and from all ages) the next point that is offered from these
words (being understood as they have been formerly expounded) is this, that
the vocation The vocation and calling of men to life everlasting is not
universal.
it reaches not to all times, places and persons of the world, the Gospel by
which men are called (as it is clear from this and other places of Scripture
was not revealed for many generations unto the Gentiles; to enquire into the
cause were curiosity and bold presumption, we are rather to adore the secret
judgments of God, and for the revelation of the Gospel to us, to magnify the
mercy of God and to become thankful, but for the point it is clear by many
testimonies of Scripture, that the Gospel was not revealed to the Gentiles for
many ages, it is said, Acts 14.16.
God in times past (that is) before the coming of Christ in the flesh,
suffered the Gentiles to walk in their own ways. Ephesians. 2.12. Romans 15.20.
The Gentiles in times past were without Christ yea, without God as Atheists in
the world: Paul preached where Christ was not so much as named according to the
prophecy of Isay. 52.14. to whom he was not spoken of, he shall be seen, and
that which they had not heard, shall they understand.

How then can that position and that conclusion, That redemption wrought by
Christ is universal is an error.
that Christ dyed to redeem all generally without exception, and that some
notwithstanding are not saved is through their own default, because they will
not? this position besides the error of it, in making the sin of the world
death, and hell stronger then Christ, or at least Gods purpose variable, and
subject to man's will, which are foul errors, besides this, it cannot stand
with the truth of this text, for if redemption be universal, then must it of
necessity be universally known, for otherwise it is no universal benefit, it
is a benefit only to such as know and believe it, and if it be not known, it
cannot be believed.

Now this text makes it clear, that it was never universally known, but
rather the contrary, it was hid from many ages, therefore universal redemption
is but a device of man's brain, and we shall find it to be but a deceiving
ground of comfort if we rest upon this, that Christ dyed for all, Note.
and have no better ground of comfort in time of need, it will fail us, for
then will the distressed conscience be ready to exempt it self from the
benefit of redemption, and say, Christ indeed dyed for all, if all would
receive him, but I by my sins have cut my self off from him, therefore the
benefit of his death will do me no good, let us then renounce it as erroneous
and false, that redemption by Christ is universal.

Let us come to speak of the Gospel in respect of the time present (but now
is made manifest to the Saints) by the word (now) we are to understand this
last age of the world, Interpretation.
beginning from the coming of Christ in the flesh, and reaching to his second
coming to judgment, all tne time of the new Testament, which is called by the
Apostle, the acceptable time, the time of grace and day of salvation, 2. Corinthians. 6.2. and that this word has this signification and extent, the
Apostle makes it most clear, Romans 16.26. the Mystery kept secret since the
world began but now is opened, and published among all nations;) for the word
of faith began to be preached to the Gentiles, only after the coming of
Christ in the flesh, and not before (to his Saints) that is as the Apostle
expounds himself, Ephesians. 3.5. first and principally to his holy Apostles and
Prophets of the new Testament, who were sanctified, and set a part to preach
the Gospel, and secondarily to all the faithful sanctified by the spirit of
Christ, thus then are the words to be conc eued.

But now in this last age of the world, in the time of the new Testament is the
Gospel revealed to his holy Apostles, and Prophets of the new Testament, and
to all the faithful sanctified by the Spirit of Christ.

We are here to mark the opposite condition of the Gospel in respect of
different times, that in former times it was hid from the world, but now is
revealed, together with the amplification, to whom (namely) to the Saints,
taking all together, we are put in mind of this conclusion.

That ignorance of the Gospel now under the gospel, Ignorance of the Gospel
in them that be of years and discretion is now in these days a fearful
thing.
in such as be of years and discretion (for of infants knowledge it not
required, they being children of believing parents, have, title to Christ by
the tenor of the covenant of grace I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed)
but in such as be of years, it is a most fearful thing, though it be no
easy matter truly to understand and believe the gospel, in respect of
natural hardness and unbelief, yet to the Saints, to them that are
sanctified, it is now made manifest, therefore now for them that ought to know;
to be ignorant of the Gospel, is a most fearful thing it seals up want of
grace and sanctification. If the gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
lost; The Apostle says in the verse before, 2. Cor. 4.3.
that he did approve himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God,
in the manifest declaration of the truth of the Gospel, and hereupon he does
infer, if our gospel be then hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In whom
the God of this world the Devil, has blinded the minds (that is) of the
Infidels, that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, which is the image
of God, should not shine unto them. Hence it is most clear, that ignorance of
the gospel in such as ought to know it, is a fearful sign, it shows not
only want of grace and sanctification but that God even now sits in judgment
upon such persons, and has begun to make known their reprobation and final
perdition, Reproof of them that are now ignorant of the doctrine of the Gospel.
and yet ought to know it, and have means to know it, many there be that are
so far from the true knowledge of the Gospel, as they cannot distinguish the
truth of the Gospel from error and falsehood, yea, some plead for themselves
that they are not booke-learned, and therefore (as they imagine) ought to be
excused in their gross ignorance, such persons conclude their own judgment,
and give sentence against themselves, that they want grace, and are in a
fearful condition, howsoever ignorance might before the manifestation of the
Gospel, excuse from so great sin, yet could it not excuse from sin
altogether, but now to plead ignorance in the clear light of the Gospel is
void of all excuse, yea, it argues that Gods wrath and vengeance has taken
hold on such persons; many will be ready to exempt themselves from this
fearful condition, and I doubt not, but some may truly say it, that they
know the way of salvation, the doctrine of redemption published in the Gospel,
and let such persons further consider the argument of the Apostle, Romans 13.11.
that the more knowledge we have, and the nearer we come to salvation, the
more we ought to answer it is holiness, considering the season says the
Apostle it is now time that we should arise from sleep, for now is our
salvation nearer, then when we believed; the night is past, and the day is at
hand, let us therefore cast away the works of darkness, and let us put on
the armor of light, so that we walk honestly, as in the day, not in gluttony
and drunkenness, neitheir in chambering and wantonness, nor in strife and
envying. If men that know the doctrine of the Gospel walk in gluttony,
drunkenness, chambering, wantonness, strife, contention and malice etc. it
argues that the veins of spiritual life are frozen up in them, yea, these
latter sins are more ugly then the sins of their former ignorance, the
Apostle calls the Galathians fools, Gal. 3.1. and why? because they knew not
the doctrine of the Gospel? No, but because they did not obey the truth of
the Gospel, Christ being in lively and evident manner preached unto them, as
if he had been crucified among them, where the Apostle does give us to
understand, that if the doctrine of salvation by Christ be plainly delivered,
and upon the delivery of it, understood and known, and yet not obeyed, not
answered, in faith and repentance, according to knowledge, such persons as so
understand and know it, are foolish and bewitched by some enchantment, they are
deluded by some secret operation and working of the Devil.

VER. 27. To whom God would make known, what is the riches of this glorious
mystery among the Gentiles, which riches is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
In this verse the Apostle does further set out the manifestation of the
Gospel to the Saints, by the efficient cause of it, (namely) the will of God
in the first words, to whom God would make known, then he does further commend
the mystery of the Gospel.

First by the condition of it, that it is richly glorious, what is the riches
of this glorious mystery.

Secondly, by the extent (among the Gentiles) And because they might doubt what
is meant by riches of the Gospel, and might understand his words, as spoken of
the riches of glory laid up in heaven, the Apostle does explain himself in the
words following, which riches is Christ in you the hope of glory. In which
words is couched a fourth argument to persuade the Colossians to continue in
their faith.

Come we to the words of this verse, as they are laid down by the Apostle;
And first of the efficient cause of the manifestation of the Gospel to the
Saints (To whom God would make known) the will of God is one and the same
without division and distinction; but for our understanding, it is by Divines
distinguished into the will of his good pleasure, Interpretation.
and his will revealed in his word, the rule of faith and obedience, we are
here to understand the will of his good pleasure according to that of our
Savior, Mat. 11.26. at that time Jesus answered etc. it is so O Father,
because thy good pleasure was such, when therefore the Apostle says, to whom
God would make known, his meaning is to whom God according to the good pleasure
of his will would make known.

We are here to mark that the Apostle is not content to say that the Mystery
of the Gospel now in the time of the new Testament is opened and made manifest
to the faithful sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, but he goes further and
sets down the good pleasure of God, the original and the cause of their
understanding and knowledge of the Gospel.



That the clear light of the Gospel does enlighten none but such as it
pleases God to illuminate. The clear light of the Gospel does enlighten none
but such as it pleases God to illuminate.
Notwithstanding the manifest Revelation of the Gospel now in the time of the
new Testament, yet none come truly to understand and know it, but only such
as according to the good pleasure of God, are by him enlightened* only they to
whom it pleases God to make it known, and for this cause Paul prayed for the
Ephesians, that the Spirit of wisdom and revelation might be given them,
that the eyes of their understanding might be lightened, that they might know
what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious
inheritance is in the Saints Ephesians. 1.17.18. and hence it is, that the Apostle
says, 2. Cor. 4.6. that God by the same almighty power whereby he brought
light out of darkness at the first creation of all things, does shine in our
hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ. Unless it please God to open our eyes, to see the secrets of the
Gospel, we are like the two disciples, Luke 24. that went with Christ to
Emaus, walked and talked with him and yet knew him not; so we pass along with
Christ in the Gospel, and hear him speak unto us, and yet have our eyes held
that we cannot know him, daily experience teaches the truth of this point, and
their is reason Paul may plant and Apollos may water, 1. Cor. 3.7.
but God only gives the increase, where, when, and to whom it pleases him.
Some may say; Psalm. 19.7.8. Psalm. 119.130.
gives wisdom and understanding and light to the eyes; and therefore it is
not peculiar to God, to illuminate. The word does convert, enlighten, Against
offense taken at this that all are nor now reformed by the clear light of the
Gospel.
and because where the word is truly preached, there some continue in their
hardness and sin, and are notorious sinners unreformed, we must remember that
the knowledge of the truth and reformation is that which only God must give, and
it is given at his good pleasure and though the preachers of the gospel,
should with Paul wish themselves separated from Christ for the winning of men,
yet shall no more be won to Christ then it pleases his Father to draw,
John. 6.44.
consider we the preaching of Christ himself: never man did or shall preach
with like holiness and power, were al reformed that heard him? nay were his
own disciples thoroughly reformed as they ought? no surely, our Savior does
often justly reprove their want of faith, and let this then strengthen us
against offense because all men are not reformed by the preaching of the
Gospel. Let us know that thus to be offended is as much as to be angry with
the Lord, for doing with his own as pleases him, and to quarrel with the
spirit of God for blowing where he lists which is fearful if it be not
duly considered.

Such as are enlightened by the Gospel are to be tha^kful to God for that
mercy. Mat. 11.25.
is it so that the clear light of the Gospel does enlighten none but such as
it pleases God to illuminate, then let as many as it pleases God to enlighten
with the knowledge of his truth, magnify the mercy of God, and be thankful
unto him for that his great goodness, we have the example of Christ himself in
this kind. If we that have the knowledge of the truth consider, how many are
left in ignorance, how many are given over to popish superstition, yea how many
living in the same place with us, frequenting the same means of salvation that
we do, and yet remain in their natural blindness, we shall find that we
have great cause to magnify the great goodness of God toward us, not only in
giving unto us his gospel, but making us to understand that above many
thousands, it is a blessing to have the Gospel brought unto us, but a double
blessing is it to have understanding hearts given us, hearts moved and yielding
to the truth of the gospel, every one that has this blessing vouchsafed may
justly break out and say, Lord what am I that thou should show me such
mercy, I was borne and brought forth in sin as other men, I have multiplied
and enlarged my sins, both before knowledge and since, my unthankfulness is
great, my unworthiness greater, yet thou have vouchsafed me mercy above many
thousands, and thus are we to meditate on the mercy of God in giving us
knowledge of the Gospel, and to open our mouths in praise and thanksgiving for
the same.

Come we to the commendation of the mystery of the Gospel in the next words
(what is the riches of this glorious mystery) the words are, what is the
riches of the glory of this mystery, the word (riches) is metaphorical
borrowed from outward good things, Interpretation.
and does here signify plenty and abundance of glory: we find the word
used in this sense in many places of the Scripture Romans 11.33. the Apostle
speaking of the admirable depth of Gods judgments, breaks out on this manner,
O the deepenes of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God, and
thus he calls the unspeakable bountifulness of God, the riches of his
bountifulnes, (of the glory) (that is) of the excellency of this mystery, both
in it self, and in regard of the effect making excellent, thus then are these
words to be conceived, what is the exceeding great and abundant excellency of
this mystery in it self, and in the effect of it.

Here first it is to be observed that the Apostle says God would make known
to his Saints, not barely the mystery of the Gospel, but the riches of that
mystery, and hence arises this conclusion.

That as many as are truly enlightened by the Spirit They that truly know the
Gospel know more then the truth and story of it.
they know more then the truth and the story of the Gospel. God does make
known to his Saints the riches and the glory of the Gospel, the good, the
excellent, the sweet and comfortable things of the gospel, they know the
Gospel as rich men may be said truly to know their riches when they know them
in the use and comfort of them, so they that are truly enlightened know the
gospel in the right use of it, in the sweet and excellent comfort of it,
touching remission of their sins, peace of conscience, adoption through Christ,
joy in the holy ghost, Ephesians. 1.18. the Apostle prays for the Ephesians that
they might know what the bare story of the Gospel? no, but what the hope of
glory, and what the riches of his glorious mystery among the Gentiles is.

Cor. 2.9.10.11 12. and it stands thus, God gives to his Saints his Spirit, the
Spirit reueales unto them the Secrets of the Lord, not only general things
known by the common gift of illumination, but the deep things of God the
hidden treasures of the Lord, 1. Cor. 2.9.
the things eye has not seen, neither ear has heard, neither came into the
heart of man, which God has prepared for them that love him, therefore they
stick not in the letter of the Gospel, but find the marrow and sweetness of
it. And for the use of this point, it may serve as a ground of trial; hereby
we may try whether we be truly enlightened, and have true and saving
knowledge of the Gospel or no.

Trial whether we have true and saving knowledge of the Gospel or no.


Now because every one will be ready to assume this to himself that he finds
the sweetness of the Gospel, some rule of direction is needful that in this
case we deceive not our selves, we are therefore to know that then we find the
sweetness of the Gospel, when we find that delight and comfort in it, that
worldly minded men do in their riches, and treasures, when we are affected to
it, as to our chief treasure, when we find our desire after it insatiable, and
especially when we find the comfort of it in time of trouble and distress,
Note.
for the most wicked will seem to find comfort in the Gospel in time of
health and prosperity, but if we can truly say with David Psalm. 119.50. it is
my comfort in my trouble, then we have found the sweetness of it, then we
have true knowledge of the Gospel, and to stir us up to labor for this,
consider but thus much, that not only the Law, but the Gospel also is a
killing letter, if we rest in the letter of it, and never search into the
Spirit, the life, the sweetness, and the comfort of it, yea (as I showed not
long since) nothing does more gal the heart wounded for sin, then the
remembrance of the sweet promise of the gospeil: if it find it not belonging to
it self.

Let us then truly pray that we may truly find out the sweetness of the
gospel, that it may stand by us and comfort us in our greatest distress.

The next thing we have to mark from these words is, that the excellency of
the Gospel is laid before us under the terms of riches and glory, two things
much affected, and much sought after in the world, yea these two were the
strength of the Devils last and strongest temptation, laid against our Savior,
Math. 4.9. he knowing the power of these two to allure to sin, he showed
him all the kingdoms of the world, and said, all these things will I give
thee, if thou will fall down and worship me.

Hence we may take up this conclusion, that look what The Gospel has more
excellent things in it to content the minds of true believers then the world
has in it to satisfy the desires of worldly minded men.
and to give them comfort and contentment the same or rather more excellent
things has the Gospel, in as much as heavenly things are above earthly
comforts and contentments, even most excellent to the souls of true believers,
has the Gospel in it self. For why? the riches of the Gospel is Christ in
whom is found all sweet comfort and contentment, even all the treasures of
grace and glory, hence it is that Solomon brings in wisdom (that is) the
wisdom of the Father Christ Jesus, Pro. 8.18. saying riches and honor are
with me,

Seeing then the Gospel is so rich a treasure in it self, we are to esteem
of it even for it self, and not to think basely of the Gospel, because it is
offered and brought unto us in earthen vessels, We are to esteem of the
Gospel for it self, and not to think basely o^ it because it is brought unto
us in earthen vessels.
weak, frail, miserable and mortal men as the Apostle says, 2. Cor. 4. we
must know that the excellency of the Gospel depends not upon any thing out
of it self, as not upon the worthiness of him that brings it, though it be an
Angel from Heaven, as it was Luke. 2. who brought tidings of it to the
shepherds, neither does the unworthiness of him that is the bringer, any
thing diminish or detract from the excellency of the Gospel it self, which is
a thing that some in these days do stumble at, and think that if the
messenger be stained with any spot or crime, then they ought not to receive
the word of the Gospel at his hand, it were to be wished indeed that all the
Ministers of the Gospel, as they are called Angels, had Angelical purity, but
let us take heed, we fasten not that unworthiness that is found upon the
heavenly and excellent mystery of the Gospel, that we esteem not that more or
less excellent, according to the condition of him that brings it, in common
reason we know it is absurd to make the truth or goodness of the message depend
upon the quality of the messenger, we will with gladness receive good news, or
that we are sure concerns our good whosoever brings it, and shall we then
refuse the glad tidings and comfort of the Gospel for the fault of those that
bring it, we are to try the spirits and doctrines of men, and finding them to
be of God, and indeed the word of the gospel, we are to embrace them as full
of heavenly comfort in themselves, and herein follow the example of the
Apostle, Phil. 1.18. he says verse 15. some preach Christ through envy and
strife not purely (that is in regard of their corrupt minds, for otherwise
their doctrine was pure, what then? yet Christ is preached etc. and thus are we
to joy in the gospel excellent and comfortable in it self, even for it self,
by whomsoever its brought unto us, yea, we are to love the Gospel excellent in
it self, even for it self, not in respect of any thing out of it self
attending upon it, because it brings with it wealth, peace and prosperity, for
so to love it, is to verify the Devils argument against Job, that as he said,
Job feared God because of his plenty of outward things, so we love the gospel,
yea, this is indeed to love our selves or to love the Gospel not for it self,
but for our selves because it brings advantage, because it brings things
pleasing or profitable unto us.

Some may say how shall we know we love the gospel for it self in the midst
of plenty and abundance of outward things.

We love the gospel in the midst of plenty and abundance of outward things,
David says, Oh how love I thy law, it is my meditation continually, if it be
so with us, though we cannot always be hearing, reading, or talking of the
Gospel, yet if we continually meditate and think upon it, then we love it
indeed.

Another thing to be gathered from these words, understood as they have bin
expounded is this.

That the gospel is not only of great excellency in it The Gospel makes all
true professors of it most excellent and glorious.
Prou. the 4.8: says the wise man, exalt wisdom, and she shall exalt thee,
she shall bring thee to honor: if thou embrace her, she shall give thee a
comely ornament unto thine head, yea, she shall give thee a crown of glory.
Pro. 4.8.9.


Our Savior the wisdom of his Father, and the substance of the Gospel
says, Pro. 8.19. his fruit is better then gold, he makes more excellent and
glorious then all the riches in the world, for (indeed) he makes all that truly
believe in him, Kings and Priests to the Lord, yea fellow heirs with him of
heaven, and gives them right and title to that crown of glory, the righteous
Lord has laid up for all that love his appearance, it is therefore a clear
truth It is a mere calumny that the true profession of the Gospel brings
beggary and shame.


The Gospel is richly glorious, not only in it self, but in the effect of it,
if thou be a true professor of it, it will enrich thee with such glory as all
the world is not able to afford, it will make thee, not only gracious and
glorious in the sight of God, good Angels, and good men, but thou shall be
honored in the inward conceits of the very wicked, as we read Exodus 11.3. that
Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaohs servants,
and there is reason for this why?

Pet. 4.14. because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon them. Who then
shall be able to take glory from them? not all the power of hell; though poor
Naboth, 1. King. 21, might seem to have all credit and good name quite taken
away for ever, being accused, convicted and executed for no less then high
treason and blasphemy, yet the Lord who knew his innocence has cleared him,
and in stead of a momentany shame suffered by him, has given him an honorable
name, standing upon perpetual record to all succeeding ages.

The Lord will disappoint them that think to get glory by any other thing save
only the true profession of the Gospel.
not only in respect of the eternal weight of glory in heaven, but even in
this world is truly to embrace the Gospel, and if any think to make himself
excellent and glorious by any other thing, let him know the Lord will
disappoint him of his purpose, yea though it be by doing that which is
exceeding good in it self (to pass by such as think to advance themselves by
sinful courses, for they shall leave their names as a curse unto Gods chosen.
Isay 65, 15.) For example, by yielding reverence and due respect, to them that
bring glad tidings of the Gospel, if a man hold the feet of them that bring
those glad tidings beautiful, anst do reverence them to get himself a name,
and do not also embrace the Gospel brought by them, let such a man be sure the
Lord will frustrate and make void his intention, look upon the example of
Herod, Mark 6.20. he knowing John Baptist, says the text, to be a just man,
and an holy, he reverenced him, and heard him, yea he did many things, and
heard him gladly; thereby (no doubt*) thinking to insinuate with John, and to
magnify himself, and to get himself a name, but we know the Lord did
disappoint him, we repute him not a man of famous memory, but behold in him the
very image and picture of infamy, there cleaues a blotte to his name for ever,
so surely as many as do reverence them who bring the glad tidings of the
Gospel, and so do a thing commendable in it self, but do it only to get
themselves a name, and do not withal truly embrace the Gospel it self, they
shall be disappointed of their purpose, yea the Lord does inwardly imprint in
the hearts of such their own damnation, in that they can witness with
themselves, they obey not them in the doctrine of the Gospel, whom they do
approve for the grace of God, that is in them, let this be thought on, and let
as many as desire to be truly excellent and glorious in the sight of God and of
men and Angels, be stirred up in truth and sincerity of heart to embrace the
Gospel, for so doing they shall be had in an everlasting remembrance as says
the Psalmist Psalm. 112.6. yea God will then undertake the protection of their
names, and will preserve them as their own salvation; it follows (among the
Gentiles) (that is) among all nations of the world besides the Jews, this does
show that God God does not reveal his Gospel according to foreseen merits.
he in the time appointed by himself made known the riches of the glorious
mystery of the Gospel, to the Gentiles lying in darkness and gross ignorance
yea without God in the world as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 2.12. yea we shall
find that the Jews before the coming of Christ were not preferred above the
Gentiles in knowledge of the will of God for their merit, if we read Stephens
testimony of them Act. 7.51. to 54. and join to this that of Ezechiel 16.
from 3. to 7. we shall easily yield to this truth, that the Lord does not
call to salvation and reveal his truth, for any merit foreseen, Confutation
of the Papists.
and consequently, the revelation of his truth, to be for merit foreseen, we
are to renounce this as a gross error, and for the Gospel brought and revealed
unto us, we being part of the Gentiles, to magnify the mercy of the Lord.

Now to the last words of this verse, which are an exposition of the Apostles
meaning, what we are to understand by the riches of the Gospel, and contain
also a fourth argument to persuade the Colossians to continue in the faith, the
argument is from the matter and substance of the Gospel, that the matter and
substance of the Gospel, and the subject of all true preaching of the Gospel
is Christ our Savior and redeemer, by whom we look for life and glory, and
therefore they ought to continue steadfast in the profession of the truth of
the Gospel; that is the purpose and drift of the Apostle in these words, and
of the beginning of the next verse, whom we preach the words are (which is
Christ in you the hope of glory) the word (which) does plainly show in the
original to what it has relation (namely) to riches, and so the word
(Riches) may very well be supplied (Christ in you) for the better conceauing
of these words, Interpretation.
we must understand that Christ his being in us, is not local or corporal,
but spiritual and supernatural. Christ is in us after a spiritual manner,
(namely) by his spirit in respect of Christ himself, and by faith in respect
of us, for these are the spiritual bounds by which Christ is knit to us, and
we to him, and we find Christ his being in us expressed in Scripture on this
manner, that he dwells in us by his spirit, 1. John 2 27. and again by
Faith, Ephesians. 3.17. and that we mistake not Christ his being in us, we must
know further, that the Spirit of Christ is in us, not in essence and substance;
but in operation, he working in us both to our justification and
sanctification, he both applying Christ unto us, and quickening us by his grace
to newness of life, (hope of glory) that is, by whom we certainly hope and
look for glory in heaven.

Hence is Christ called our hope, 1. Tim. 1.1. Thus then the words are to be
conceived.

Which riches is Christ being in you by the apprehension of Faith, and by the
operation of the Spirit of Christ by whom we certainly look for glory in
heaven.

From the argument here used by the Apostle take notice of a gross error of
popish doctrine. A gross error of the Papists confuted.
The Papists teach that the Gospel is nothing else in effect, but the law of
Moses made perfect, the law written in men's hearts by the holy Ghost, if this
were true, then should the Law and the Gospel be all one in substance, and
differing only in degree of perfection, then should Christ have bin revealed in
the Law which is false, the Law never knew Christ nor faith in Christ, the
mediator, God and man; the Apostle here makes Christ the substance of the
Gospel, and therein places the riches and excellency of the Gospel, which
indeed were no preferment at all, if the Law and the Gospel were all one, it
is sufficient to have named this. The next thing we have to mark is, that the
Apostle says, the riches of the Gospel is not only Christ, but Christ in us.
The Gospel does propound and set before us Christ, not only in his own
person, nature and office, but also in us by the apprehension of faith, and
application of his Spirit.

Hence we may gather, that to whomsoever Christ is a Savior, he is not a
Savior altogether out of himself, he is so a Savior to every one, as he is
propounded and set forth in the Gospel,

Now in the Gospel is set before us, not only a Savior out of us, but also
in us, and therefore to whomsoever Christ is a Savior, he is not a Savior
altogether out of himself, To whomsoever Christ is a Savior he is not a
Savior altogether out of himself.
let no man misconster my speech, and mistake this conclusion it may be
understood as favoring and giving allowance and strength to a Popish opinion,
(namely) this, that Christ is a Savior in us, by communicating and giving
merit to our works, and making them meritorious as the Papists teach, this
indeed is to make Christ not an absolute and perfect Savior by himself as we
are taught Hebrews 7.25. but only an instrument by whom we must save our
selves, and there is no truth in this, because Christ is not one with us, by
personal union which is the ground of all merit, even in Christ himself, when
therefore I say to whomsoever Christ is a Savior, he is not a Savior
altogether, out of himself, my meaning is according to the truth of the word
of God, that he is a Savior unto him, not only by the merit of his death
and obedience, How Christ is a Savior in some sort in us
procuring pardon of sin, and right to life eternal, but also by his
efficacy by his effectual working in him by his Spirit, working faith in his
heart to apprehend his merit, and purging his heart from corruption, and
turning it from sin to God, and for proof of this we have some pregnant
places of Scripture Titus 2.14 says the Apostle, Christ gave himself for us,
that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar
people unto himself, zealous of good works, not only to be a redeemer from
the guilt and punishment of sin, but also from the corruption of sin, 1. Pet.
1.18. says the Apostle, we were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver
and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as with a lamb undefiled, and
without spot, from what? from our vain conversation, says the Apostle, whence
it is clear, that Christ is a redeemer of men, not only from deserved
condemnation, and so a redeemer out of themselves, but even in them by the
operation of his spirit redeeming, that is, freeing and delivering them from
the corruption of sin, and from wicked conversation the fruit of it.

And therefore to whomsoever Christ is a Savior, to him he is a Savior, not
altogether out of himself.

The reason and ground of this is evident,

Now the application of the work of redemption is, by the inward work of his
spirit, and therefore to whomsoever Christ is a Savior, to him in this sense
is he a Savior, not altogether out of himself.

A point happily not known to a great number in the world; most men imagine
Christ to be their Savior, Reproof of them who think that Christ is their
Savior altogether out of themselves.
and herein does the Devil take advantage upon our doctrine, the doctrine
taught in our Church, that in the matter of justification in Gods sight, and in
the matter of salvation, we must go out of our selves, and seek for
justification and salvation only in Christ: hereupon does the Devil take the
hint, and delude many thousands, persuading them it is sufficient if they
believe or rather fancy to themselves, that they are justified and also saved
by the merit of Christ, by Christ a Savior altogether out of themselves,
though they never find Christ a Savior in them by way of application of his
merit to their justification and sanctification.

It is true (indeed) we must go out of our selves in the case of justification
and salvation in respect of merit, and seek for that only in Christ, and rest
only on him for that, but we must also find Christ in us by the work of his
Spirit applying his merit to our justification, and cleansing us to our
sanctification (that is) we must find Christ a Savior unto us, out of us by
his merit, and in us by the efficacy of his Spirit, and to stir us up to
labor for this, know it for a truth, Note.
that we can never have assurance that Christ has saved us by his merits till
we find he has in some measure also wrought in us, and purged us by his
spirit. He that is saved by Christ from hell, is by him also turned from sin
to God, and if this be wanting, there can be no assurance of the former. It is
the Apostles own conclusion. If upon examination we find not Christ in us, it
seals up a fearful conclusion (namely) this, that we are yet in the state
of damnation, let as many as tender their own salvation, think upon it, and
never rest till they find Christ a Savior out of them by his merits, and in
them by the powerful operation of his Spirit. Let us further observe as a
ground of another instruction, that the Apostle says, Christ in us is the hope
of glory, hence arises this conclusion.

That as many as have a true hope of eternal life, they None can truly hope for
life and salvation unless Christ be in them.


The reason John 1. Epist. 2.2. therefore no man can truly hope for life and
salvation, but on this ground that Christ is in him.

The discovery of the folly and vain hope of ignorant and wicked persons.
their folly, they commonly promise to themselves happiness, life and
salvation, and they hope to be saved as well as the best, though they live in
in their sins, and follow after their sensual pleasures even wiih
greediness, but let them know: this is a mere illuding and deceiving of
themselves: this is to build the hope of salvation upon a rotten ground, upon
sin ruling in them, not upon Christ in them, the ground of true hope.



beseech you) is this but to think that death and the pangs of it are
appointed for the begetting of true hope in them which is all one as if thieves
and other malefactors should think the day of assizes were appointed for
their preferment, and to advance them to some dignity, let them consider what
the wise man has said, when a wicked man dies, his hope perishes, Pro. 11.17.
and the hope of the unjust shall perish, even that which he hopes for does
vanish and deceive him, and let them remember that threatening sentence of the
Lord, Deuteronomy. 29.20. it is able to shake their hearts, that if any man who
walks on in a course of sin, bless himself and promise himself peace and
happiness, hope and comfort, the Lord has said in express words, he will not
be merciful to that man, how then can he hope to die blessedly who lives
wickedly: now the Lord cannot fail of his justice and truth to execute that
he has threatened.

Let this therefore stir us up to labor to put our souls out of danger
before death, sickness, and trouble come upon us, let every one of us
endeavor by all good means, that we may truly say with the Apostle, Gal. 2.20.
Thus I live, yet not I now, but Christ lives in me: and in that I now live in
the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God, who has loved me, and given
himself for me, and that will make our life prosperous, our death full of
hope and comfort, and our state in the world to come immortal and glorious.

VER. 28. Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all
wisdom* that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
The Apostle in this verse does first affirm that the subject of his and of
the other Apostles preaching was Christ (whom we preach) then he does
further branch and and divide his preaching into two heads, videlicet:
Admonition and Instruction.
Admonishing and teaching, and he does amplify both these by the common
object of them, (every man) and again his instructing of every man by the
matter of it (namely) (wisdom) and that true and perfect wisdom, (in all
wisdom) then he subioynes the end of his preaching, and admonishing in the
last words, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: these are
the general things propounded in this verse.

Whom we preach] that is, which Christ we preach; whereas as the Apostle says,
the subject of his preaching was Christ I will only note this one thing
briefly.

The matter of true preaching, is Christ Jesus.
and one special note by which we may know doctrine delivered to be sound and
good, is this, that it sets out unto us Christ Jesus with all due respect of
his glory in the work of redemption, and with due regard of the honor of his
name, as the only King, Priest and Prophet of his Church. Hence it is that the
Apostle, Galat. 3.1. calls the truth of the Gospel preached among the
Galathians, a lively description of Christ, as if he had been crucified among
them, and S. John, 1. Ioh. 4.1. teaching us not to believe every spirit, but to
try the spirits and doctrines of men whether they be of God or no. Among other
notes set down by him, whereby we may be able to discern the spirit of
truth, and the spirit of error, this is the first note of difference, that the
doctrine is good, and of God, that is founded on Jesus Christ incarnate.

And by this I might show the error of many points of popish doctrine,
Confutation of many po^nts of Popish doctrine.
as their making Christ a Savior in us by communicating merit to our works,
their mingling of his blood with the blood of the martyrs, in way of
satisfaction for sin, their joining with him intercession of Angels and
Saints, and many other of like sort, wherein they exceed^ngly detract and
derrogate from the honor of the kingly, Priestly, and Prophetical office of
Christ, and so teach not sound doctrine, but I pass from them to the next
words (admonishing) the original word (admonishing) does signify
propounding some thing that is amiss to the mind to be thought on,
Interpretation.
and to be corrected and aamended, and reproving for the same, and teaching
(that is) instructing every one in the truth, what he is to hold and believe
(in all wisdom) that is, in true and perfect wisdom, it is usual in
Scripture to put the note of universality (all) to note excellency and
perfection, thus then we are to conceive these words, admonishing every man
(that is) setting before the mind of every one what is amiss to be amended,
and reproving for the same, and instructing him in the truth what he is to
hold and believe even in true and perfect wisdom.

Here first we are to mark the order of the words of the Apostle, he sets
admonition before teaching, admonishing every man teaching, hence arises this
conclusion.

That by the preaching of the word we must first be We must first be brought
to a sight of our sin by the preaching of the word, and then be taught how to
come out of them.


First we must be admonished and showed our error and state of sin, and made
to see our sin, and then instructed how to come out of it, and in this order
of teaching has Christ himself gone before us, John 4. he first showed the
woman of Samaria her sin, that she lived in adultery before he taught her
that he was the Messiah, and what she was to hold and believe touching him, we
may observe it in the sermon of Peter, Acts. 2. he first laid before the
Jews their sin, that they had slain the Lord Jesus, and then upon their
touch and remorse of conscience, he said unto them verse 38. amend your lives,
and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost: if we look into the
book of God, we shall find that this has bin the order of all true Prophets,
Apostles and teachers from time to time, and the reason is that which is given
by the Apostle,

Trial whether we have truly profited by the preaching of the word or no.
they may know by this, if they have first been brought to a sight of their
sins, and truly humbled and cast down, and after that brought to believe in
Christ, for the pardon of their sins, then they have truly profited by
preaching, for as it is the right order of teaching, first to admonish and to
show sin, and then to instruct, so it is the right order of receiving the
word taught, and profiting by it, and never any of Gods children were
thoroughly comforted by the word, but they were first truly humbled by it, it
is a preposterous and disordered course of learning to learn as some do, that
mercy and salvation comes by Christ, and with that to content themselves, not
suffering themselves first to be schooled by the law, till they despair in
respect of themselves, and so come to Christ, and find comfort in him, and that
we may be resolved of it, that it is (indeed) a preposterous course of
learning: we must know that the very gate to true repentance, it is a true
contrition and compunction of heart, a godly sorrow for sin, for though it
cannot be denied, but that Gods free grace and mercy is the foundation of true
repentance, Note.
repentance following Faith, not only in time, but in the order of nature, yet
first must the heart be mollified, and by godly sorrow made pliable and fit
to receive Gods grace, otherwise it will not enter, the fallow ground of the
heart, must first be plowed, and then the seed of Gods grace cast into it, as
says the Prophet Ierem. 4.4. break up your fallow ground and sow not among
thorns: therefore they are deceived, who will needs be held truly repentant
for their sins, and yet never felt in their hearts any measure of godly
sorrow; happily they have had by a general sight and sense of sin, wrought
by the word or judgments of God, some light and vanishing touch of conscience,
causing them to send forth a natural sigh or sob, but their hearts were never
truly pressed down with the weight of any one sin, they skip over the first
degree, and will needs be graced with the highest degree of repentance, at
the first, even true conversion and turning from sin to God, which is a thing
impossible, if we will be saved, we must know that godly sorrow for sin is
necessary, we must every one drink his measure of that cup, we must first be
schooled by the Law, and feel the sharp rod of that school master, before we
can come to be good scholars in the school of Christ, let every one by this
examine how he has profited by the hearing of the word.

We are in the place to mark, the Apostle says admonishing The word preached
reaches all and every one, and so ought to be heard.
and received, whether it promise mercy, or threaten judgment, we are to make
use of it to our selves particularly, it is commonly seen, if a privilege
immunity or common benefit, be granted to any place, every man will have part
in that; but if it be a matter of charge, then they post it off to others; so
if the word promise any mercy, every man even with unclean hands will lay hold
on that, but if the word be drawn out against any sin, the guilty person will
commonly post that off to others; as if drunkenness be spoken against, he
that is guilty will see if he can spy any other in the congregation tainted
with that fault, Its a fault to post often the reproof of the word from our
selves to others.
then he thinks the Preacher speaks to that other, and not himself. This is
a sin as ancient as Adams fall. Adam he posted of his sin to Eve, and Eve
to the Serpent.

Let us take heed of this, it is a dangerous corruption, when a man is touched
by the word, and his own conscience tells him his sin is spoken against: then
as we use to say, to set a good face on the matter, and to bite in all tokens
of repentance, because he would not have it thought, that the word came so
near him, who so thus hardens his heart, may justly fear, that hereafter
he cannot repent, they go together, Romans 2.5. after thine hardness and heart
that cannot repent, and so he shall heap up wrath against the day of wrath.
(In all wisdom) in that the Apostle says, the matter of his teaching was true
and perfect wisdom, he preaching Christ, and teaching the Gospel of Christ;
I might stand to show the perfection and sufficiency of the word of the
Gospel, that it is sufficient, and alone sufficient to make men truly wise
unto salvation, but I pass by that.

In that the Apostle makes true and perfect wisdom, the particular matter of
his teaching and instructing of every man, we may conclude that every man
truly wise, Every one truly wise has his wisdom from the teaching of the
word of God.
no man is truly wise, but so far forth as he is taught by the word, and
does follow the teaching of the word, for why? the word is indeed true
wisdom, the wisdom of God revealed, manifesting such things as flesh and
blood was never able to reach unto, therefore it must needs be that no man is
truly wise, Moses said to the people, Deuteronomy. 4.5.
I have taught you ordinances and laws, as the Lord my God commanded me, that
ye should do even so within the land, whither ye go to possess it, then verse
6. keep them therefore and do them, learn and follow them, for that is your
wisdom, and Jeremy the Prophet, speaking of such as made no conscience to
follow the teaching of the word, Ier. 8.9.
says, Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in
them; as if he had said none at all.

Would we then be truly wise, If we would be truly wise our wisdom must
come by the teaching of the word of God.

Exodus 1.10.


the most simple witted are loath to be counted foolish, yea, the most wicked
affect wisdom, Pharaoh and his counsel, though their cursed meeting sauoured
of nothing but cruelty and blood, yet they would shroud it under the covert of
wisdom; come let us work wisely with them, etc. but would we indeed be wise,
let us then look that our wisdom come by the teaching of the word, that it be
a stream issuing out of that fountain, true wisdom comes not by the teaching
of nature, by the rules of Art, or worldly policy, by observation of outward
things, or common experience, a man may be exceeding wise according to these
grounds, and yet have not any dram of true wisdom, but in the account of
God himself, be a very fool, Luke 12.20. the rich man there spoken of, was
worldly wise, he could get, save, keep, and think of laying up his goods
against time to come, and yet God said unto him, thou fool, this night will
they fetch away thy soul from thee, true wisdom is derived only from the
word, and every man is so far forth wise, as he is taught by the word, and
does follow the teaching of the word.

Now because every one will be ready to take this to himself, that his
wisdom is derived from the word, and that he according to the measure of his
knowledge and grace, does follow the teaching of the word. I hold it fit to lay
down some special notes and mark, Special note of true wisdom.
by which we may know that our wisdom is (indeed) derived from the word, and
that our wisdom is taught by the holy Ghost, and to this purpose read Iam. 3.
from ver. 13. to the end of the chapter. It is there said that the wisdom
that is from above, true and heavenly wisdom, is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging,
and without hypocrisy, these are the fruits that be in true wisdom, and
issue out from it, hereby then we may try whether we be wise by the teaching
of the word and spirit or no, if our wisdom bring forth purity, gentleness,
easiness to be entreated being offended etc. then is our wisdom true and
heavenly: but on the contrary, if we be full of envying and strife, and
implacable, as many are that would be reputed jolly wise men and women, they
are full of envy, yea, such as can never be appeased, being once (it may be
without cause) offended, ready to believe every flying tale, and to judge
amiss, certainly, then our wisdom is not from the teaching of the word, and
descended from above, but earthly and fetched from the pit of hell, yea, the
more cunning we are to hide our malice, or to work the hurt of our brethren by
word or deed, the more foolish are we, has not Satan more subtilty and
cunning to work mischief, then all the men in the world, yet (indeed) he is
the most foolish creature that is, for he does nothing but work his own woe.
Let us therefore labor to be wise by the teaching of the word, and that we be
not deceived, often remember we the words of the Apostle, that true wisdom
is pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good
fruits, etc.

The last words of this verse contain the end of the Apostles preaching (that
we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus) the original word translated
(present) is judicial borrowed from open courts and places of Judgment,
Interpretation.
where men are brought and set before a Judge to be tried and examined, and the
Apostles meaning is, that we may set every man at the great day of the Lord
before his tribunal and judgment seat, (perfect) (that is) perfectly just and
holy, not only in regard of justice and righteousness imputed (for so all
true believers are perfectly just, in this life, he that truly believes in
Christ, has the perfection of the Law, and is as just as if he had fulfilled
the whole Law) but perfectly just and holy in regard of righteousness and
holiness inherent, and that perfect in degree (in Christ Jesus) (that is) as a
member of Christ, thus then the words are to be conceived, that we may set
every man before the judgment seat of God at the day of judgment, perfectly
just and and holy, not only in regard of holiness and righteousness imputed,
but in regard of inherent holiness and righteousness wrought in him by the
Spirit of God as a member of Christ Jesus.

Now here we are first to mark that the Apostle says, he and other Apostles
preached Christ, admonished and taught men, not to make them perfect in regard
of holiness inherent in this life, but to present them holy at the bar of
Gods judgment in the life to come, the point of instruction from hence is this,

That we may in this life proceed from one measure of We may in this life
proceed from one measure of faith and holiness to another, but we cannot come
to absolute perfection.
till this life be ended Ephesians. 4.13. the Apostle says plainly, that it
cannot be till we all meet together (in the unity of faith and knowledge of
the son of God) unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ, he there teaches that the ministry of the word shall endure
till we meet together, etc. giving us to understand, that then it shall cease,
now the Ministry of the word shall not cease, 1. Cor. 15.24.
but continue as the same Apostle teaches, till the end of the world, and
therefore before the end of the world there shall be no meeting together in
the unity of faith, nor any absolute perfection to be hoped for, and the
reason

The Apostle says, Ph. 3.15. let as many as be perfect etc. therefore
perfection is to be had in this life?

(perfect) his meaning is of some maturity, Our duty is so long as we are in
this life to go on from one measure of grace to another.
and ripenes in knowledge; and through long custom had their wits exercised to
discern both good and evil; and therefore notwithstanding this, it remains a
truth, that we may in this life proceed from one measure of faith and holiness
to another, but we can never come to an absolute perfection. The Anabaptists
dream of an absolute perfection of holiness in this life, but to pass by
them, our duty following from hence is this, it behoues every one of us in this
regard, never to set down our rest in any grace, but ever to be striving
forward, and to go on from one measure of faith and grace to another, and to
this purpose, we are to propound unto our selves, and to set before us the
best examples for our imitation, 1. Cor. 11.1.
as the Apostle says, be ye followers of me* even as I am of Christ; this is
that which deceiues many of us, we look downward and compare our selves, with
such as are of meaner gifts and graces then our selves, and we think all is
well, because we are not as the worst, though we never strive to come near the
best. Happily some of us have a measure of knowledge, and we rest in that
knowledge, we know the Sacraments to be holy seals of Gods covenant of grace,
but we have little or no care to use them; we know prayer to be excellent, but
we make no conscience to use it, only for fashion publicly, but very seldom
privately with our families, this is to set down our rest in knowledge and not
to strive to go on, and let us take heed of it, if we find the love of the
word and sacraments, the liking of prayer, etc. that should be joined to our
knowledge, stolen out of our hearts, we have cause to fear that sin will
deceive us, and creep on to a further degree, even to the hardening of our
hearts, that we shall not perceive it, and to the blinding of our minds that
we shall not see it. We may not think that Sodom, Saul, Judas and such like
were at the height of their sin at the first, but they went on by degrees,
from one degree of sin to another; and certainly, if we go not forward in
grace we go backward, and we grow in sin; and going on in sin, we shall
come at length to be hardened, and to the height of sin, and so pull down the
wrath of God upon us.

Let this therefore stir us up, not to set down our rest in any grace, but
let us strive to go on from knowledge to practice, and from one measure of
grace to another.

Note we one thing more in a word, in that the Apostle says, present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus etc. we The state of perfection is not proper to some
sorts and orders of men.
as the Papists teach, but every member of Christ is perfect, in respect of
righteousness imputed in this life, and shall be perfect in regard of holiness
inherent in the life to come.

But the Papists distinguish and say there be two kinds of perfection, a
less, consisting in keeping the Law necessary to salvation; a greater, in
observing the counsels of Christ, not simply necessary to salvation,
Confutation of popish distinctions touching perfect^on.
but to obtain a greater degree of glory, this distinction is most absurd.

For first counsels be commandments, and again, can there be a greater
perfection, then an absolute fulfilling of the Law? it is not possible.

If any man be able to fulfill the Law of God, he is most perfect, he is in
that respect perfect according to the example of Christ: therefore there can
be no greater perfection, it is absurd to say there can be no greater
perfection.

VER. 29. Whereunto I also labor and strive, according to his working, which
works in me mightily.
In this verse the Apostle sets down.

(Whereunto I also labor and strive.

(according to his working.)

(which works in me.)

(mightily)

Interpretation.
Whereunto (that is) unto which thing formerly spoken of, I also (that is) for
my part labor and strive; the words are (labor striving) the meaning is, to
which end I contend, not only with labor and pains, serving to that purpose,
and tending to that end, but with wrestling and striving against all adversary
power that does oppose against it, to hinder the attainement of that end. Thus
then these first words are to be conceived. Unto which thing I for my part
endeavor and contend, not only laboring and doing such things as tend to
that purpose, but striving against all things that oppose it, and hinder the
attainement of that end.

Now here we are to mark, that the Apostle says not, that he barely
propounded this as the end of his preaching and admonishing, that he might
present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: but he did labor and strive to
attain it; hence we may take up this general conclusion.

That every man in his personal and particular calling, Every man is to do
the duties of his particular calling with diligence.
and the good of men, is to do the duties of his calling with diligence, he
is not only to do the duties appertaining to his place, after the example of
the Apostle, to do them with labor and pain, breaking through all
difficulties, and all things that stand up against him, to hinder him in the
diligent performance of them. Eccles. 9.10. the Preacher says, all that thine
hand shall find to do, do it, with all thy power: not only do it, but do
it, with all thy power; as if he had said, follow the works of thy vocation,
and employ all the powers of the mind, about the discharging of it faithfully,
Paul biddes him that rules, not only to rule, but with diligence, and every
man that has an office or calling, to wayt on it with care and diligence, Romans
12.7.8. the reasons of thus duty are two.

First because it is appointed to man by Gods order, laid Genesis 3.19.
In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread till thou return to the earth,
that is, till thy death.

Secondly, because the Lord has given unto man both

We see then the duty proved, and the reasons of it; but that we be not
deceived in the practice of it, 2. Rules.
two rules must further be remembered.

First, our diligence in doing the duties of our callings, must be with
respect to the will and commandment of God, for diligence is required by his
commandment, and we are to be diligent in performing the duties of our
callings, in conscience and obedience to Gods will and commandment, not for
pride, covetousness or upon compulsion, or other by respects, as do the
duties of their callings in these respects painfully may be said to be great
workers, but nothing diligent.

Secondly, our diligence must be with direction of our labors to the end of
our callings, in the diligent performance of our duties, we must drive at the
end of our personal callings, that we may attain that end. The example of
our Apostle in this place does teach thus much, he was called to preach the
Gospel, that he might present some perfect in Christ Jesus, and to that end
did he employ his whole strength and endeavor; so must we in our particular
places and callings; for example, a master of a family, he that is called to
be a master and governor over others, must not only in a family be diligent,
in governing his wife, children and servants, for that may be done for his
own profit and commodity, which (indeed) is not unlawful, a man may reap the
fruit of the labors of those that be under him; Psalm. 129.2.
but that must not be the scope and drift of his diligent administration and
government: but he must therein drive at the preservation and good of the
bodies and souls of those that be under him; that is the end of his
particular calling. I might insist in other particulars, but by this we may
see our duty, and the manner of the practice of it, we must not only do the
duties of our callings, but with care and diligence, and with diligence rightly
ordered, (namely) with a respect to Gods will, and with direction of our
labor, to the end of our personal callings.

We are to practice the duty of diligence in our callings.
and to this purpose much might be said, as that diligence in doing the
duties of our callings, is a means by the blessing of God upon them, to make
rich, Prou. 10.4. yea, a means to keep from ungodly company, sinful
exercises, and all kind of unthrifty courses, yea, a remedy against pride, and
helping to work humility, and so making a way to all good prosperity; but as a
motive A Motive.
most powerful consider we only this one thing.

That diligence in doing the duties of our general calling as we are
Christians, diligence in hearing the word, receiving the Sacraments, Note.
without diligence in doing the duties of our personal callings is but mere
hypocrisy.

If a master of a family, or his wife be ready and willing to hear the word,
to receive the Sacraments, etc. and yet one of those be loose and wretchlesse
in the administration and government of his family, and the other careless in
the practice of private obedience and subjection to her own husband, surely,
they have but an outward form and show of religion, as the Apostle says, 2.
Tim. 3.5.
without the power thereof. For the true practice of the duties of the first
table of the commandments, is seen and does appear in the practice of the
duties of the second table, our love to God appears in our love to our
brethren etc. we truly serve God, in doing service unto our brethren in the
duties of our particular callings, as the Apostle does show chap. the 3. of
this Epistle ver. 24. in the example of servants, that servants in doing true
service to their masters they serve the Lord.

If then we would avoid the odious and foul sin of hypocrisy, which is
hateful to God and men, to whom it is known, and has the portion in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone.

Let us be stirred up to do the duties of our particular callings with
diligence, even in conscience to the commandments of God, ever aiming at the
end of our callings, that so we may assure our own souls, and testify to the
world, that our hearts are upright and sincere in the fear and service of God.



Hence we are taught, that known conclusion, that the Ministers of the Gospel
may labor and strive to win souls to God, but they can go no further, they
cannot effect it, Ministers of the Gospel can only labor and strive to win
souls to God but they cannot effect it.
1. Cor. 3.6. Paul may plant, Apollos may water, but God gives the increase.
And the reason of this is, that which is common to all callings, the fruit of
men's labor in their callings is, Except the Lord build the house they labor
in vain that built it: Psalm. 127.1.
so except the Lord give a blessing to the ministry of the word, Ministers
labor and strive but in vain.

Strength against discomfort when a Minister sees little fruit of his labors.
yea, the friut of the self same word by him delivered to one and the same
people, so diverse, that some regard it and do thereafter, others neglect it and
do contrary, Moses himself had experience of this, Exodus 9.20.21.

We must take heed the cause be not in our selves that we find not Gods
blessing on the ministry of his word.
unless it please God to give a blessing to his labors, then let us take heed
there be no just cause in us, why the Lord should withhold his blessing from
us in the ministry of the word, and in his just judgment give us over to the
blindness of our minds and hardness of our hearts, that we can neither see,
feel, nor understand to salvation, and that is when we have not a love to the
word, but are hypocrites and such as hear only for fashion, and of custom,
and have not a longing desire to profit; such as come on this sort to the
hearing of the word, the Lord does not bless their hearing, but does suffer
them to go on in a most fearful dullness. Examples of this there be many in
the world, and no doubt we may easily point out some, who have heard their
own particular sin discovered by the Ministry of the word, and that sin
spoken against, and the greatness and danger of it laid before them, and yet
they are bold to continue in that sin, and to go on in it, and what is the
cause of this? surely, because they heard only of fashion and custom, the
Lord did not bless their hearing. It is just with the Lord as the Apostle has
taught, 2 Thessalonians. 10.11.12. When men receive not the truth in love of the
truth, to send them strong delusion that they should believe lies, and to give
them over to the blindness of their minds, and hardness of their hearts. Let
this therefore be thought on, and let it stir us up to come to the hearing of
the word with love to the word, and a desire to profit by it, that so the Lord
in mercy, may strike an holy stroke within us by his powerful Spirit, that
we may be bettered by it.

Come we to speak of the power, by which the Apostle did labor and strive,
laid down in these words (according to his working) the meaning is,
Interpretation.
according to the working power of Jesus Christ. For we find both these
conjoined Ephesians. 3.7. the Apostle says, he was made a Minister, by the gift
of the grace of God, given unto him through the working of his power, where we
see working and power joined together.

For better clearing of these words, know, that the power of God is either
absolute, by which he is able to do more then he will; or it is actual, by
which he does what he will. And this actual power we are to understand in
this place, and so the meaning is, according to the working, or actual, or
effectual power of Jesus Christ. The point of instruction hence to be
gathered is this.

In that the Apostle says, he did labor and strive in his ministry according
to the working power of Christ, thence we are taught this general conclusion.

Power to labor and to take pains in any calling is from the actual power of
God.
yea, wisdom and skill to work in manuarie trades is not natural, nor
gotten by pains, though pains sanctified and blessed are means to attain
it, yet they are but means, and the fountain of that cunning and skill is the
working power of the Lord. Exodus 31.34. we have a plain proof of this, the
Lord says, he had filled Bezaleell with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship, and not only that
cunning and skill as the first gift, but we are further to mark, that all
increase and going forward in the same skill was from him. The Lord says, it
was of him and from him, that Bezaleell should be able to find out curious
works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, (that is) to devise
more and more every day, Pro. 20.12. the wise man says, the Lord has made
both these, even the ear to hear, and the eye to see. Which words not only
prove that the power to do any duty is from the Lord, but they contain the
ground of it, and the meaning of them is thus much, that the Lord has not
only formed all the parts of men's bodies, and (namely) these two, the ear,
and the eye, but he it is who enableth and quickneth them to their several
office and function, as he says to Moses Exodus 4.11. he has given the mouth
and speech to man, therefore all power to labor in any place or calling is
from the actual working

I doubt not but this is a known and confessed truth, let us therefore make
some profitable use of it.

And first it may teach public persons, Magistrates and Ministers, not to
look at themselves, at their own power, or rather at their own weakness,
but with comfort to look to the power of the Lord in the discharge of their
duties, Public persons are not to look at their own power, but to the power
of the Lord in discharge of their duties.
it is an engrafted weakness in man's nature, when any great or difficult
thing is to be taken in hand, to be fearing and doubting and ever casting
perils and dangers. Thus was it with Jonas, Jeremy and Moses, and many others.

Men are indeed to consider their own weakness, to humble them withal, but
yet being called to perform any public duty, they are then to remember
though they be weak, yet the Lord he is strong, and ever able to stregthen
them, and for their comfort, they are to remember that sweet promise of the
Lord to Moses, upon acknowledgement of his own weakness Exodus 3.12. I will
be with thee, as if he had said, I do not say, that I will help thee now
and then, but I will be with thee, ever and continually, I will aid thee in
this work, even I, and not any Angel of mine, but I my self, and therefore
fear not.

This is a notable encouragement to public persons in the doing of their
duties.

Again, is it so, that power to labor in any trade We must acknowledge our
strength and skill to labor in our callings to come from the Lord.
We must then learn to acknowledge it to come from the Lord, that we have
strength or skill to labor in our callings, and that our acknowledgement of
it, be not verbal, only in word, and of course, but that our own hearts may
witness with us, we do in truth acknowledge it, we must often send up
prayer to Heaven for strength to labor, yea, in the midst of our greatest
ability, for we have need of continual supply of strength, as the light of a
lamp has need of oil to mainetaine it; and when we have strength given, we
are to be thankful to God for it, using both it and the fruit of our strength
and labors to the glory of God, and the good of our selves and others.

Many men are defective in this duty, they never acknowledge the power they
have to labor, to be from the Lord, happily in word, they do if the question
be made to themselves, whether they do acknowledge their strength, to labor
to come from the Lord or no, they will answer certainly they do, but indeed
and truth they do not, for finding themselves lusty and strong to work, and
to take pains, they presume upon their strength and seldom or never call upon
God for a blessing upon it, and for continual supply of strength, and the
Lord notwithstanding suffering them to enjoy the fruit of their strength and
labors, he being wonderful in goodness, they seldom or never open their
mouths, to give thanks to the Lord; no, they commonly ascribe the fruit of
their labors to their own strength, as the Prophet Habakkuk 1.16. says of
the wicked of his time, they sacrifice to their own net, and that they get by
their labors, they abuse and spend riotously and wastfully, as fast as it
comes in; the Lord therefore has lately pinched such unthankful unthrifts,
he being Lord of all creatures, he has by the late hard weather, by the
extreme frost, The great ^rost in the year 1607.
bound up their hands, that they could not work, and so has set it before
them (if they will not wilfully shut their eyes) they may see whence they have
power to labor; I know the Devil the teacher of all the ungodly, will be
ready to suggest that this binding of men's hand by the weather was common to
all good and bad; it is true, but I make no doubt of it, but that such as
truly fear the Lord, found that of the Psalmist true, Psalm. 33.18.19. that
the eye of the Lord was upon them, to deliver their souls from death, and to
preserve them in famine, or if they were pinched with others, yet it was in
mercy, not in judgment, and only ungodly unthrifts, such as never acknowledge
their strength to labor to come from the Lord, they felt smart and were
pinched in judgment, and forced to mutter add murmr, and to fall to ungodly
excuses.

Let this then teach us ever to acknowledge the strength we have to labor to
come from the Lord, doubtless we may observe it when men do not acknowledge
God the author of their strength, the Lord in his just judgment strikes them
with sickness, blindness, lamenesse some way or other disabling them, he will
be honored in all his gifts, either by acknowledgement of them, or by the
confusion of such as will not thankfully acknowledge them.

Let us then learn to acknowledge what power or skill so ever we have in our
trades and callings that it is given of God, that so we may use it to his
glory, and to the good of our selves and others, and find his blessing upon it,
without which, our best strength turns to weakness.

Come we to the subject of the working power of Christ (namely) the Apostle
himself (which works or is effectual in me) that we are to mark from these
words is this. 3. The subject.


The Apostle says not, the power of Christ wrought and was effectual with him,
but in him, or as some expound the words, by him, whence it follows.

That neither the Apostle was, nor any minister of the Neither Apostle nor any
minister of the word is a co-worker with the power of God in the winning of
souls.
but only is as an instrument in the hand of so powerful a workman, the
actual power of God, does work in and by his ministers in gayning of souls
to himself, hence it is that the Apostle says; 2. Corinthians. 13.3. that Christ
did speak in him, not with him, seeing that ye seek experience of Christ,
We must ascribe that grace and holiness that is wrought in men by the
ministry of the word and Sacraments wholly to the power of God.
but is mighty in you, he takes not so much as speech or power to speak to
himself, but ascribes it altogether unto Christ, when therefore we see grace
and holiness conuaid into men's hearts by the ministry of the word, and
sacraments, we must learn not to ascribe it to any working power of the
minister or the elements, but wholly to the supreme power of almighty God.

But may some say, does not the Apostlle, 1. Cor. 15.10. say he labored, and
yet not he, but the grace of God which was in him, does not he then affirm a
power in himself, and of himself, and the grace of God to work with him;
indeed the Papists they abuse that place, and would force it to prove a
concurring of Free Will, with Gods grace in our conversion.



4. The measure.
Now the Apostle in the last words adds the measure of Christ his working in
him, that the power of The Lord works mightily by weak means of grace.
if you read Romans 15, 18.19. we are taught not to look at the outward man in
the ministry of the word, or the outward elements in the Sacraments, for the
ministry of the word is exercised by weak and mortal men and the outward
elements, bread, wine, and water are weak and common dead creatures in
themselves,

The use of this in a word is thus much, we therefore are to know that Gods
favor and grace is ever ready to be found, when it is faithfully sought in
the use of the word and Sacraments, Gods grace and favor is ever ready to be
found being faithfully sought, in the use of the word and sacraments.
our faith can never take the Lord tardy, in giving grace by his holy
ordinances, the ministry of the word and Sacraments, he works in them, and
by them mightily, his power is ever present in the right use of them, the
messengers in the Gospel. Luke 14.17. say not to them that were bidden, be
there at such a time, and in the mean while things shall be made ready, or go
with me now, and supper will be ready anon, but come, for all things are
ready, grace is now ready, and now prepared for them that seek it in the right
use of the word and Sacraments, and if we have failed to obtain grace and
comfort by the word and Sacraments, we are to impute it to our selves, and not
to lay the blame upon the ordinances of God, they are not barren of virtue and
power, but we were wanting in Faith and repentance, and other duties by which
we should have been better prepared.

THE SECOND CHAPTER.
VERSE 1. For I would ye knew what great fighting I have for your sakes, and
for them of Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my person in the flesh.


THe Apostle in the former Chapter, having declared the doctrine delivered to
the Colossians, to be agreeable to the truth, and persuaded to continuance in
the same. In this second chapter he does show them that they ought carefully
to avoid all other corrupt doctrines whatsoever, whereby false teachers would
obtrude, and thrust upon them any thing besides Christ, or any thing with
Christ as a means of salvation, whether out of Philosophy, or the Law of
Moses. That is the general proposition and matter that is handled in this
chapter. The general proposition and matter of this chapter.


The parts of this text three.
The parts of it are three.

1 First an Exordium, an entrance depending upon that that which went before in
the first and second verse.

Then two general propositions.

1 First, that in Christ we have full and perfect knowledge needful to
salvation and that in the third verse. 2 Secondly that all other things are
mere deceit and vanity verse 4.
And both these are amplified by many arguments and particulars persuading to
embrace the one and to avoid the other, and intermingled through the chapter,
we shall best see them in the passage and particular handling of the chapter.
Come we to the words of the first (For I would, etc.) these words look back
to the last verse of the former chapter as a preoccupation or prevention of an
objection. The Colossians might say, Paul thou do labor and strive much in
preaching the Gospel, but what is that to us, thou never saw us, nor we
thee, all thy labor and pains is nothing to us: this objection the Apostle
meets withal when he says. I would ye knew what great fighting I have for
your sakes, etc. Here we have 1 First, the Apostles desire that his labor and
fighting might be known in the first word (for I would ye knew what great
fighting I have, etc. 2 Secondly, for whom it was, in particular, namely for
the Colossians, and them of Laodicea. 3 And then generally for as many as have
not seen my person in the flesh.


For I would ye knew what great fighting I have, only the word (fighting) is
to be cleared and explaned, it is metaphorical, borrowed from such as
withstand assault, Interpretation.
or open violence and hostility, such as with all their strength set themselves
against the power and violence of open enemies, fighting does implie opposition
and the Apostle does thereby signify his spiritual striving, his earnest care
and pains he look to withstand the enemies of the Church, Satan and his
instruments, and that by his sufferings whereof he spoke chap. 1.24. And by his
earnest prayers, as he says, chap. 4.12. Epaphras did strive in prayers for
the Colossians, by his writings and reasonings, in way of confutation of all
adversaries of the truth, so much is implied in the word (fighting). Thus then
we are to conceive the meaning of the Apostle.

I would ye knew what care and pains I take for you in withstanding Satan, and
the enemies of the truth, and of your salvation by my sufferings, prayers,
writings, and reasonings against them.

The first thing here to be observed is this: the Apostle was not content to
have an earnest care and contention, for the good of the Colossians, and other
Churches, but he made it known to them I would ye knew it, says the Apostle,
he thought it no shame to tell them that he loved them, and had an earnest
care and striving for their good, the conclusion following hence is this.

It is lawful to make known and to speak of our Christian love to others.
and of our care for their good, a man may lawfully speak of it, and make it
known that he has a love, and christian care for the good of others, if so
be in speaking of it he set before him the glory of God, and the good of men,
as no doubt but the Apostle did in this place and we may observe it to be very
frequent and usual with the Apostle, to speak of his love and care for the
good of Gods Church, when he knew the speaking of it might redound to Gods
glory, and the good of his people 1. Cor. 12.11.12.13.14.15. he says he ought
to have bin commended of them, for in nothing was he inferior unto the very
chief Apostles, etc. he makes known that he had an exceeding love and care
for the good of that Church. Thus may we do, we may speak of our love and
care over others, that God may thereby be glorified, and our brethren bettered,
being thereby stirred up to answer our love again, and to praise God for it;
and there is reason Things to be avoided in speaking of our love to others.
for the matter of it every man (no doubt) is most ready to blase, and to set
abroad, and to amplify that love he bears to others, and that care he has
for their good, yea some deal in this respect as Absalom did, 2. Sam. 15, 4.
they speak of love and care toward others, that is not in them, as if they
loved them exceedingly, and cared much for their good, thereby to insinuate,
and get within the love and liking of others, and to get the good word of
others. These boasters are reckoned up by the Apostle in the rank and rabble
of reprobates Romans 1.30, or else if there be in them a care for the good of
others, they speak of it as the Pharisee speaks of his fasting, and giving of
tithes, Luke 18.11. with disparagement, and with disgrace of others, that if
they were in such a place, or in such an office, they would have men to know,
that they would deal better then others do, and so they cunningly seek their
own praise by other men's disgrace, which is a gross corruption, and a breach
of the ninth commandment, we may lawfully speak of our love and care over
others, so as therein we seek not our own praise, but the glory of God, if
praise be given of God and godly men, we may lawfully accept it, Note.
the Lord has promised to crown with honor, and estimation among men, them
that honor him 1. Sam. 2.30. Therefore it is not to be declined, the true
children of God may accept praise given, yea honor and dignity in the world,
Psay. 14.14.
so their minds be humble, and they have learned S. Paul's lesson, 2. Corin.
6.8. to use aright honor and dishonor, but they are not to seek it by
speaking of the good things that be in them, for so doing they seek to set
themselves above the Lord, and to ascend above the height of the clouds, and to
advance their glory above the glory of the Lord, which ought to be sought above
the salvation of their own souls.

The next thing to be marked is, that the Apostle says not, know that I have a
great fighting for you, etc. But I would have you to know, it is my desire that
you should know it, and his desire being holy and good does afford this point
of instruction.

It is good for men to know and acknowledge that love and care that public
persons have over them, and for them.
especially ministers and public persons, have over them, and for them, if
there be a care in the ministers of the Gospel to do us good, and that
manifested by any means, by preaching, writing, praying, admonition, or any
other way, it is good for us to take notice of it and to acknowledge it. Our
Savior says by way of pitiful complaint over Jerusalem, Luke 19.42. If thou
have even known, at the least in this thy day, those things which belong unto
thy peace, as if he had said I am in pity and compassion toward thee, wish
thou had known these things that concern thy peace, spoken unto thee by
the Prophets in former times, or at least the things offered by me in this thy
day, concerning thy peace, but alas thou would not take knowledge of them;
therefore now they are hid from thine eyes: see again how the Lord does
complain of his people, Ezechiel. 12.9. Son of man (says he) has not the
house of Israel, the rebellious house said unto thee, what do thou? as if he
should have said, how stupid and how senseless is this people, that yet will
not acknowledge thy care to instruct them by this manifest similitude, for the
Lord has bidden the Prophet verse 3. to prepare his staff to go up into
captivity, and he says go forth by day in their sight: and thou shall pass
from thy place to another place in their sight, if it were possible that they
might consider with the Prophet how they might escape the captivity threatened,
yet when the Prophet had done, they considered not his care to instruct them,
but stood as men amazed, and said what do thou? and of this does the Lord
complain; therefore it is good to know, to acknowledge, and to consider the
love, and care that others, and especially the ministers of the Gospel have
over us for our good; and there is reason for it, Reproof of them that will
not take notice of the tender care of their ministers over the^ when out of
love they justly reprove the^
as usury, extortion and such like, and that in a tender care over them for
their good, are so far from acknowledging that reproof to come from any love
toward them, as they begin to quarrel with the affection of the reproouer,
and stick not to mutter it in corners, that they are hardly dealt withal, and
unreasonably reproved, yea sometimes they seek by recrimination, and by
unjust accusation to blemish them that would wipe away their foul blots.

And thus they show themselves such as the wise man speaks of Proverbs 9.7.
he that rebukes the wicked gets himself a blotte; others again are like
to Lots sons in Law Genesis 19.14. who (as there we read) when Lot spoke unto
them to get them out of Sodom in care over them for their good, he seemed to
them as though he had mocked, so some when they are told of their sins, and
withal showed that judgment hangs over their heads for the same, they think
men that do so tell them do but dream, and are troubled with some
melancholic passions, and it is neither so nor so: well, let such as will not
now acknowledge the love and care of them that labor to do them good by
reproouing them for their sins, or showing the judgments of God due to their
sins know, that the Lord by his mighty working, will so bring to pas^e that
in their extremities they shall be forced to acknowledge it, then they shall
justify the love of such as did formerly reprove them, and then they shall
wish for their prayers as Pharaoh did for the prayers of Moses and A^r^^ when
the hand of God was upon him, Exodus 8.8. And as the stubborn Israelites did
the prayer of Samuel whom not long before they neglected, 1. Sam. 12.19. yea
wicked Jeroboam in case of extremity sends to the Prophet, whose doctrine he
would not follow, and no worse messenger then his own wife, 1. Kings. 14.1.
and may we not observe it that many who (at other times) regard no^ what the
ministers of the Gospel say unto them in tender care for their good, yet in
time of extremity are forced by the omnipotent hand of God, to send and to
seek unto them for comfort, and then many times in the just judgment of God
they are left in their misery, and are not able to take hold of any comfort
that is ministered, the Lord having so threatened, Prou. 1.26. that he will laugh
at their destruction, meaning that he in the course of h^s prouiden^e will
leave them in their miseries, and make them a mocking stock to the world, does
not daily and la^entable experience teach thus much, let it then stir us up
to take notice and to acknowledge the love and care of such a^ labor amongst
us for our good, be it but in poor and wea^^ measure, and in testimony of our
true acknowledgment of it, let us labor to take profit by it, for it is not
enough to cry out with the woman in the Gospel Luke 11.27. blessed is the
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou have sucked, to commend the
gracious words, the person or the gifts of love, care, or zeal that is found
in them that seek our good, no, no says our Savior blessed are they that
here these words, and do them, the heathen man could say lauda vt videam,
praise me that I may see it, that is the best acknowledgement of any grace in
other men manifested, serving for our good, to give testimony that we like it,
and that is the best testimony of our liking of it if we be bettered by it.

The next thing to be marked in the Apostles desire expressed in these words is
that he does express his care and the pains he took under the word
(fighting) a word that does imply opposition, and in this place does signify a
spirirituall withstanding of violence offered by the enemies of the truth, the
Apostle expressing a special part of his care and pains under the notion of
(fighting) does give us to understand thus much for our instruction.

That the truth of the Gospel has ever had some to The truth of the Gospel
has ever had some to withstand it.
no sooner was the true doctrine of the Gospel published by the Apostles of
Christ, and the true teachers of it, but false Apostles, deceivers and teachers
of error presently start up in opposition and contradiction to it, and so the
Apostles were put to a second and double labor, to teach the truth, and to
withstand error springing up after the truth like the builders of the walls
of Jerusalem, Nehemiah 4.17. who builded with one hand, and with the other held
the sword, it was the occasion of the writing of this Epistle, and of that to
the Galathians, that upon the preaching of the truth, and planting the Gospel
among them, they were in danger to be seduced by false teachers, examples of
this kind are infinite and ecclesiastical histories of all times and ages, are
full fraught with such examples, we read in the book of God, that together
with the doctrine of piety, and religion there sprung up the doctrine of the
Nicholaitanes, of Balaam, of Iesabell, and of those abominable and cursed men
that crept into the Church, whom Peter and Jude, do point out in their
Epistles, and warn men to take heed of them and diverse others, there were men
in the Church of Corinth thrust out by Satan, that took upon them to defend
feasting with Idolaters in idol temples, with meats offered to idols, and by
their subtle cauilling wits, helped forward by the Devil, took on them to
prove that they were not defiled by eating those meats, or by bodily
fornication: in whose steed after the Apostles times succeeded the Valentinians
and other heretics, yea come we to our own times, we shall find that so soon
as ever the light of the Gospel shined and dispelled the darkness of popery,
the devil set on foot many dangerous errors by Anabaptists, Libertines, the
family of love, and other such monsters.

And the reason and always shall have some to withstand and contradict it.

Many at this day are offended that errors and strange opinions spring up
together with the preaching of the gospel and take occasion thereby to slander
and deface it, We are not to be offended that errors and strange opinions
spring up together with the preaching of the Gospel.
yea the Papists knew it well that errors and heresies begun to sprout up, and
to show themselves in the Apostles time, and that shortly after their times,
the Church was every where grievously rent and tormented by monstrous heretics
and filthy persons, yet they shame not to object it as a vile reproach against
us, that such things do spring up where the Gospel is preached indeed they
consider not whom they reproach, for they reproach not only us, but whole
Churches of old, even Churches planted by the Apostles, and the Lord himself,
we may not take it to be no true Gospel, nor right preaching, nor no true
Church where errors and oppositions arise, but rather acknowledge it to be the
same Gospel that was preached by the Apostles, seeing Satan seeks to deface
it as he did in old time, if we think the Devil be still like himself, as
indeed he is no less malicious then he has been, but he labors more to
sow errors and to corrupt men, by how much he is nearer to his end, why then
should we not look for his working and practices against the truth to be the
same, or worse then they have been in times past, let the consideration of
this arm us against offense in regard of the damnable heresies, sects and
schisms; which follow the sincere truth of the Gospel. Let it strengthen us
against discouragement urged upon us by the blasphemous railing papists, who
charge the most heavenly doctrine of the Gospel to be the seed of all
heresies, errors, and tumults: for it is the devil that sowes all the ill
seed, and then sets wicked men aworke, Papists and such like, to exclaim
against the Gospel, as if the fault were in the doctrine of the Gospel.

This is the subtilty and packing of the Devil, and this being discovered
unto us. Let us be strengthened against all discouragement, thar the enemies
of the truth are able to enforce by this argument, that errors, oppositions,
and differences do spring up where the Gospel is preached, 1. Corinthians. 11.19.
there must be heresies even among you, that they which are approved among you
might be known.

Come we now to speak of the words following wherein the Apostle sets down
for whom his labor and fighting was (namely) in particular for the Colossians
and for them of Laodicea, and generally for as many as had not seen him, now
then, in that the Apostle says, he had great labor and fighting, a great care
to with stand the enemies of the truth by his sufferings, prayers, writings, and
reasonings against them, and that for the good of the Colossians, Laodiceans
and others, I might show that the sufferings of the godly are profitable for
others, but of that we speak, verse 24.1. chap. and again that the writings
of the Apostles are very profitable for others, daily experience shows.

The prayers of the faithful are profitable for the defect of others against
the violence of their special enemies.
who set upon their fowls to corrupt them with error, and to bring them into
heresy.

Touching the efficacy of prayer in general, that place of James is very
plain and pregnant James 5.16. that the prayer of the righteous man avails
much, if it be fervent, but for proof of this, that the prayer of the
faithful is a powerful means to defend others from being overcome by the
assaults of the enemies of their salvation, read Ephesians 6.18. we may there
observe that the Apostle does reckon prayer as a special part of the complete
armor of a Christian, whereby he may not only defend himself and repel the
assaults of particular enemies, but he way profitably use it for the defense
of others even the saints of God and fellow members of the same body, pray
always for all Saints (says the Apostle, as if he had said, do not use
prayer as an excellent weapon for defense of your selves only, against your
spiritual enemies, but for the defense of others also, even the Saints of God;
if we look into the world, we shall find example of many that have
received profit by the prayers of the godly in this kind, they have been kept
from quite falling from God in time of a dangerous conflict with Satan, and in
the Lords good time they have been delivered, but that there be no mistaking
of this point, know that we are not to ascribe this fruit of prayer to the
dignity of prayer, or to any worthiness in the faithful, Note.
but only to the bottomless mercy and goodness of the Lord, he of his
infinite goodness making them so powerful, and so mighty with himself as that
they are to him, as it were bands to tie him, and as a wall against him, that
he cannot sometimes execute his judgments on the wicked, unless they (as it
were) suffer him, and stand out of his way, and thus we read of his mercy to
Moses, Exodus 32.10. Let me alone (says the Lord) that my wrath may wax hot
against them; is there any thing at all in man to deserve this? no, no surely,

And for the use of this, it is an exceeding great comfort to the children of
God, such of them as are weak and happily conflicting with Satan, and under
some grievous temptation, and so not able to pray as they ought, or desire,
therefore they are to comfort themselves in this, that though their prayers be
in much weakness, yet they may have the benefit of the prayers of the godly,
Comfort to Gods children being weak and conflicting with Satan and under some
grievous temptation that they have the benefit of the prayers of the godly.
which are mighty and prevail much with the Lord; but let none at all take
hold of this comfort but such as are indeed the children of God, and remember
with this, that they that will be prayed for with comfort to their souls,
must be able at one time or other, though happily not for the present, being
under some grievous affliction, yet I say at one time or other to pray for
themselves, Note.
though in much weakness, Deutronomy 33.7. it is said thus Moses blessed
Judah, and said, hear O Lord the voice of Judah, he prays for Judah who was
able to send up his voice to God for himself, they that neither are, nor ever
were able to pray for themselves, but in time of need put themselves only on
other men's prayers, they are like the foolish Virgins Matthew 25. who go to
borrow oil, when they have most need to use it, I deny not but the godly may
pray for all sorts of men grounding on Gods general commandment binding them
to show duties of love and mercy to all sorts, be they godly or wicked, an
Abraham prayed for the Sodomites, Genesis 18.23. Lot for Zoar Genesis 19.20.
but yet only such as are the children of God have profit by the prayers of
the godly to defend them against the power of spiritual enemies, and to
eternal life, the wicked may have temporal calamities removed, as Pharaoh
had at the prayer of Moses and Aaron, and Jeroboam his withered hand restored
at the prayer of the Prophet 1. Kings. 23.6. but wicked reprobates cannot have
any spiritual comfort by the prayers of the godly, and therefore let this
comfort and cheer up only the children of God in their weakness, that though
they pray in much weakness yet the prayers of the faithful are strong for
them, and they houlding communion with the Saints, they have part in all the
good prayers of the people of GOD, throughout the whole world, and if the Lord
hear the prayer of one faithful man; or of two or three gathered together in
his name according to his promise, of what force then may we think are the
prayers of thousands, yea ten thousand thousands, even of all Churches of the
chosen children of God throughout the world; How shall not the Lord in mercy
according to his promise accomplish that which they ask? surely, the Lord
cannot but hear the^ calling upon him, let this then raise up the hearts of the
children of God, and make them in troubles lift up their heads with comfo^t,
and look about them, they shall see as Elisha did, more with them, then against
them, 2. Kin. 6.16.
they have Angels to guard them, all the Saints on the earth to pray for them,
which is a singular comfort if it be duly considred.

One thing more is further to be observed from the last words of this verse
(And for as many as have not seen my person in the flesh) I will not trouble
you with any curious speculation, tending rather to superstition then to
edif^cation, touching the face of the Apostle, the words are thus to be
conceived, for as many as have not seen my bodily presence before them, nor
ever heard me speaking unto them. Now in that the Apostle says, he had a
great fighting in prayer for as many as had not seen his face; we are taught.

That we must not only strive and be earnest in prayer We must not only pray
for our selves and our famillar friends but for all the members of Christ
wheresoever they be.
though never seen of us, we must never pray for our selves or friends with a
private heart and affection, but we are to wish and pray for the like mercy to
all the members of Christ that have like need, it is lawful for us to pray
for our selves and friends in particular, we have the example of David, of
Anna, and of our Savior himself, but in prayer for our good, and the good of
our friends, we must have (as they doubtless had) an eye to the common good,
that by that thing given, be it health, liberty or the like, we may be better
able to serve God, and to do good to our selves and others, and withal we are
inwardly to wish the like good to all the members of Christ, to whom it may
stand in like steed, this we are taught in the first words of that prayer by
Christ to his Church, the word (our) being a word of community does teach us
we should never pray for our selves alone, but together with our selves all
others, even the whole Church of God.

The reason

Reproof of such as neglect this duty.
much less do the miseries of many Saints of God in other places and
countries affect us, nay I fear me, I may justly speak it, many seldom or
never pray for their own families, no child, no servant, no ^o the wife of
their own bosom has the help of their prayers, their houses are nurseries
and seminaries of cursing and swearing, and all manner of disorder, it is just
with the Lord to punish such with unruly wives, with graceless children and
lewd servants.

Let us then learn to pray for our selves, and families, if we look for any
blessing of God upon them, and in praying for our selves, let us remember the
Saints in other places, our hearts are commonly narrow and straight, looking
only at our selves, and our own friends, and the dear Saints of God, members
with us of the same body are not thought upon, sincke or swim the Church of
God we care not for it, so we be well, this far from that affection that
ought to be in the members of Christ, and certainly, prayers made without
care, and desire of the good of others, return empty unto us without profit or
comfort, yea without doubt, it is one cause why the Lord does not bless us in
our callings and labors, the people of God say, Psalm. 237.5. If I forget
Jerusalem, then let my right hand forget to play; the implication of that place
is thus much unto us, that if we forget the Church of God, and do not remember
the Saints of God in affliction, in that wherein we may do them most good, as
(namely) in our prayers, the Lord may justly take from us our cunning and blow
upon our labors, and curse every thing we take in hand; let this stir us up
to think of others in Christian love, as of our selves, and to entreat the
Lord fot them as for our selves.

VER. 2. That their hearts might be comforted, and they knit together in love,
and in all riches of the full assurance of understanding to know the mystery of
God, even the father, and of Christ.
Come we to the second verse which is part of the Apostles exordium or entrance
to his matter following; in this verse is first laid down the end of the
Apostles fighting for the good of the Colossians and others, and the end was
this, that their hearts might be comforted.

Then follows two conditions of such as are capable of that cordial comfort.

First, they are such as are knit together in love, for so are the words in the
original, that their hearts might be comforted, they being knit together in
love.

Secondly, such as are knit together in all riches of the full assurance of
understanding.

And to this is added by way of opposition an explication of that
understanding, what it is (namely) a knowledge of the mystery of God, even the
father, and of Christ: of these things let us speak in order.

That their hearts might be comforted, the word translated (comforted) does
properly signify encouraged and raised up by some words of comfort being ready
otherwise to faint, or fall down under some affliction or trouble, the
Apostles meaning then in these first words is thus much, that their hearts
fainting and ready to fail in regard of trouble, and discouragement by false
teachers, adversaries of the truth, might be encouraged and raised up with
comfort.



That one special end is to be driven at in all ministerial actions, in
preaching, in praying, in writing and reasoning against adversaries of the
truth, is, that men's hearts might be comforted, One special end to be aimed at
in all ministerial actions is the comfort of men's hearts.
that such as belong to Christ may receive spiritual joy and comfort of heart,
1. Cor. 14.3.
the Apostle says, he that prophesies speaks unto men, to edifying and to
exhortation and to comfott, or rather (indeed) as the words are, to
encouragement and comfort. Two principal ends of preaching are encouragement
and comfort; the Gospel is the word of glad tidings and heavenly comfort, and
the end of the preaching of it, is to bring Gods Elect to certain hope of life
and salvation, and as many as are begotten to that lively hope, they are also
brought to rejoice with joy unspeakable, 1. Pet. 1.8. in so plain a poyn^ it
is needelesse to add further evidence, but for the use

Consultation of the popish manner of teaching.
Is it so, that a special end of all ministerial actions is, that men's hearts
might be comforted. Wickedly then deal popish teachers in turning their
teaching to a clean contrary end, even to hold men in suspense, and to make
them live in continual doubt of their salvation, and so void of all spiritual
comfort; every man may see that is a perverting of the ordinance of God, and a
great profanation of the holy word of comfort, which being truly taught and
directed to a right end, gives certain light and knowledge of life and
salvation, and is powerful by the work of the spirit to confer the spirit of
adoption, whereby believers know and are assured that they shall be saved, and
that does replenish their hearts with exceeding great and unspeakable comfort.
And again, for a second use of this point, it is a Resutation of a cavil of
the flesh against diligent attending on the ministry of the word.
is a means to make men live an heavy and a dumpish and uncomfortable life,
and a means to strip and deprive them of all delight, and comfort, yea some
are deeply possessed with a conceit, that it is a means to make men mad, foolish
people sometime have uttered it, where a Preacher has been sent among them,
that he would make them all go out of their wits, see the cunning of the devil
to fit the humors of men, or rather the drines and barrennes of their hearts,
being barren of al heavenly comfort, the devil does so drench them through with
carnal delights and pleasures, as he keeps them from any taste of the sweetness
of that joy that might come by profitable hering of the word and he persuades
with them that indeed, that is a means to breed in them disquietnes, grief,
sorrow and much vexatio^. We must take heed of this deceit working on our
corruption, and know that a special end of preaching, praying and other
ministerial actions, is, that our hearts might be filled with heavenly comfort,
yea, such comfort as will season all other outward comforts, and make them
truly comfortable, yea, such comfort as will turn our affliction to triumph,
and such comfort as once begun shall never be taken from us, but shall continue
with us for ever, Romans 8.57.
let us then banish and cast out of our minds, Ioh. 16.22.
all such deceiving thoghts that the ministry of the Word, Sacraments, prayer
another holy exercises are means to strip us of all comfo^^ they are means
(indeed) to humble us and to wound us for our sins, but yet to bind us up
again with heau^^ly comfort, to work in us peace of conscience, to settle us
in assurance of our right to eternal life, and to give us a t^st^ and
beginning of that joy eye has not seen, ear has ^o^ heard, nor the heart of
man conceived.

One thing more observe we from these words, the words (as I showed) are thus
to be conceived, that their hearts laboring and ready to faint, might be
encouraged and raised up with comfort.

Encouragement against adversaries of the truth is necessary.
if true Christians be not encouraged by such as are to fight for them as
Generals and Captains, I mean the Ministers of the Gospel, they faint and
are ready to fall under the hands of such as seek to make a prey of them, Gal.
5.12. I would to God they were even cut off, which do disquiet you. The
original word signifies to put men out of their estate, and to drive them out
house and home, as enemies do in time of war, and it gives us to understand,
that if the enemies of the truth be suffered to have their wills, and the people
of God be not encouraged and strengthened by comfortable exhortations,
prayers, and other means against them, they will in the end sack and spoil
them of their comfort.

We must pray earnestly that they who stand for the maintenance of the truth
may join together against the common adversaries of the truth.
the Papists, for surely, they begin to gather ground and to encroach upon
us, we therefore are to pray unto the Lord, (that is all we can do) thar the
differences amongst the Ministers of the Gospel being but in circumstance, not
in substance as popish inchanters buzze in the heads of the simple, that these
differences may be compounded, and that they may join hearts, hands and all
their force against the adversaries of our comfort, and may be better able to
minister unto us encouragement, strength and continual supply of heavenly
comfort.

Come we now to the first condition of such as are capable of comfort of heart,
in the next words, 1. Cond.
(that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love) the word
here rendered (knit together) does signify such a conjunction and knitting
together as is of the parts and members of the same body, Interpretation.
which are conjoined and knit together by ligaments, by nerves and sinews, and
so the word is used by the Apostle Ephesians. 4.16. by whom all the body being
coupled and knit together by every joint for the furniture thereof. Thus then
these words are to be conceived, they being coupled and knit together through
the bound of love as the members of the natural body are by nerves and
sinews. We are here to mark that the Apostle makes it a special condition
of such as were capable of the comfort: he drives at in all his painful
labors and sufferings, that they were such as were knit together in love, hence
we may gather.

That joining together in love with our Christian brethren They that hold
communion with their brethren in Christian love are most fit to receive
heavenly comfort by the holy ordinances of God.
preaching prayer, and the like means of spiritual comfort, for why? that
joining together in love is a forcible means to procure, and to bring down a
blessing from heaven upon Gods ordinances appointed for the comfort of his
chosen, to make them comfortable to us in particular, we read Psalm. 133. where
brethren join together in love, and dwell together in unity, it is not only a
good and comely thing, but such a thing as has promise of a blessing annexed
unto it, it is a means to procure a blessing upon our hearing of the word of
comfort, to make that effectual for our comfort 2. Cor. 8.1.2. the Apostle does
avouch that his ministry wrought as great grace and as great comfort in the
Macedonian churches, as in any other whatsoever, and withal he gives testimony
of them, that they were such as were knit together in love, and made their love
known by their ready contribution to the relief of the poor Saints; joining
in love together, is a means to bring down a blessing on our prayers to the
comfort of our souls. Psalm. 86.2. David had encouragement to call upon God
with assurance of comfort to the preservation, of his life, when he could
truly plead that he joined with the Saints in love, and that he did manifest
his love toward them by works of mercy, Preserve thou my soul for I am
merciful, I might thu^ go on to other particulars, but these may suffice to
s^^^ that joining together in love, is a means to bring down^ a blessing upon
the ordinances of God, and to make the^ effectual to our comfort, and so it
makes way for inward comfort offered unto us from the outward means of comfort,
yea it makes way for comfort offered unto us, when we have most need of comfort,
in our fears, temptations and afflictions, either of body or mind, if we be
such as are linked to our brethren in love, it inuiteth the godly to repair
unto us in our troubles, it makes them desirous to refresh our hearts with
words of comfort, it strengthens their hope in their supplications and prayers
to God for us, yea it mini^^ers arguments of comfort to our own souls, though
other m^^ should not come at us, or deal so well with us, as to minister
comfort unto us, by counsel, prayers, and other mean^ yet our own consciences
telling us that we are such as are knit to our brethrens love that testimony of
our own hart^ with the testimony of the spirit of God, will support our souls
in the greatest extremity. 1. Ioh. 3.14. We know we are translated from death
unto life because we love the brethren etc. what then shall daunt or dismay us?
It was Jobs case when his friends were Physicians of no value, Job. 13.4. not
able to apply the word of comfort aright, and miserable co^forters, then did
Job amongst other arguments of comfort to himself, recount and call to mind
this, that he had held communion of love, with the poorest Saints of God, and
testified his love by fruits of mercy, as we may read Job. 31. from verse 16,
to 23.

How then shall not this affect our souls, and stir up our A forcible motive
to stir us up to join together in Christian love
and to labor to be knit fast one to another by the bond of true love, seeing
joining one with another in love, is a means to give way to true comfort of
heart offered from the outward means of comfort, yea, to procure a blessing
upon the ordinances of God appointed for the comfort of his chosen, yea, such a
thing as will yield matter of comfort, when friends who should comfort us do
fail, and forsake us, 2. Phil. 1.2.
who then will not be moved to join with his brethren in love, yea, let me
conclude with the Apostle. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if
any comfort of love, any comfort yielded from love, then fulfill my joy, (it
would indeed be a great joy to all that fear God) to see it, that ye be like
minded having the same love.

Again, that joining together in love is a means to make Distraction and
drawing our hearts a sunder one from another brings forth a fearful effect.
even set a bar between us and inward comfort, and make us unfit to receive
it, yea, bring down judgment in steed of mercy, and a curse in steed of that
comfort that might come unto us by the ordinances of God, appointed for the
comfort of his chosen. Such persons as have their hearts full of swelling,
heart-burning, and deadly hatred against their brethren, and such as have their
mouths filled with galling, bitter and venomous speeches, or do any way break
the bond of love, and so continue, can they look that the Lord should give
them any grace, or comfort by his word or other holy ordinances? no certainly,
the Apostle has taught us that such persons have foul and defiled hands, 1.
Tim. 2.8. I will that men pray, every where lifting up pure hands without
wrath. If there be wrath and contention in the heart, the hands are soiled, and
made unfit to compass Gods altar, and the Lord does challenge men for coming
into his house with bloody hands, Isaiah. 1.15. yea he says, if we stretch out
such hands, he will hide his eyes from us, and though we make many prayers he
will not hear us, We are now shortly to be made partakers of the Sacrament of
the Lords supper, thereby to seal up our union with Christ, and our faith in
his blood, and to testify our communion with the members of Christ, let us
know we can look for no comfort by receiving that sacrament which is full of
comfort to a worthy receiver, unless we be knit together in true Christian
love one to another, if we come to be knit more nearly to Christ, and be
divided one from another, we deceive our selves, we shall but seal up
judgment to our selves, and eat and drink our own damnation. Now I know the
Devil will be ready to catch advantage upon this speech of mine, and will put
it into the heads of such as be at odds, and jar with others, that
therefore it is good for them to forbear coming to the Sacrament because they
cannot receive it with comfort, they cannot come with quiet minds; see the
cunning of the old Serpent, how he can put on the person of the teacher, and
take on him to teach men what is good for them, to avoid the danger of
damnation (if we may believe him) indeed it is not good for men to come to the
table of the Lord in the dregs of their malice and hatred, but why are they not
(as they ought) with speed reconciled both to God and men: will they continue
and go on in their malice and unchristian iars, and make that a sufficient
place and reason of weight to keep them from the table of the Lord, who taught
them to suffer the sun to go down on their wrath, and so take the Devil to
bed with them? yea, to lodge in the closet of their hearts, and then to plead
that as an excuse to keep them from the Lords table? this is even to add
drunkenness to thirst, one sin to another, or when we have wounded our
selves by sin to go on to the Devil for a medicine; I would demand of such
persons but this one thing, let them answer if they can, they say they cannot
come to the Sacrament with hope of any comfort, let that be granted, it is
true, so long as they continue in their malice* let them tell me then, if the
Lord should now in this state wherein they are, lay his heavy hand upon them,
(as they are in continual peril of strokes and judgments to light on them,
being at enmity with the brethren they abide in death, what then can be said
unto them for their comfort, 1. Ioh. 3.14.
if good and godly men come unto them of purpose to speak to their comfort,
what can they say to mitigate their fears, or to lessen their torment of soul
and conscience, surely nothing, till they have given some evident token of
their repentance and of through reconciliation with their brethren, and then
they may justly doubt of the truth of their repentance, and that it is but
forced and not of sincerity; yea, their own hearts may justly doubt of it, and
be most forward and forcible to accuse and to condemn them, and if our hearts
condemn us, God is greater then our hearts, and knows all things 1. Ioh.
3.10. he also will condemn us.

Let this then be thought on, and let it stir up such as be at difference and
jar with their brethren to seek for speedy reconciliation, and let them not
make their quarrel and contention, a pretense to keep them from the Lords
table, for that is to add sin to sin, but this day before to morrow let them
labor to be reconciled to their brethren, least the punishing hand of God
overtake them, and then they be left, not only void of comfort, but incapable
of any comfort, and in such a case as the best men in the world shall not be
able to minister sound comfort unto them.

We are further to mark, that the Apostle says not, being such as love one
another, but being knit together in love, he sets out their union through love
by a similitude from the conjunction of the members of a natural body.

True believers are as nearly coupled together through love as the members of
one body. Act. 4.32.
are by nerves and sinews, it is an usual and known comparison of Scripture to
compare true believers to the members of one body, true believers of the
primitive times, though they were a multitude, yet they are said to be of one
heart and of one soul and therefore (no doubt) they were as one body; and this
may serve as a ground of trial, Trial of our love one toward another whether
it be true or counterfeit.
and carnal love; if we be so knit together in love grounded on the image of
God, as it were as easy to pull an arm, or a leg from the body of a man, as
us one from another, then is our love true Christian love, and if by this rule
we examine our love, we shall find that many of us are much defective in this
duty, can we persuade our selves we are knit together in love, as the members
of one body, and yet upon a matter of a trifling profit, yea, upon suspicion of
some wordly loss grow discontented start a sunder, and break the bond of
love, yea, break out into opprobrious terms and vile slanders, is this to be
compacted and knit together, as the members of one body? if we so think we
deceive our selves, this is that the wise man speaks of Prou. 26.23. silver,
dross ouerlayed upon a potsheard, so are burning lips and an evil heart; even
to have burning lips, lips as it were inflamed with the fire of love,
professing great measure of love, but an heart cold, wicked and mischeeuous,
and that we may be stirred up to a reformation of our selves, consider we
only this one thing.

We can never be assured of our union with Christ Jesus til we find our selves
knit together in love one to another; for though that be first in nature, yet
this is first known, and we can never know that by this. If any say he loves
God (i) that he is assured of Gods love to him, and yet be not in love with
his brother, he deceiues himself, he is no better then a lier. If then we
would not be found liers for the good of our own souls, and prove our selves
still in the dregs of nature, having no fellowship with Christ Jesus the
fountain of all our comfort.

Let us never rest till we be knit together in love, grounded on the image of
God, and so fast as nothing in the world whatsoever falls out be able to pull us
asunder.

Now to the second condition of such as are capable of inward comfort in the
next words. 2. Cond.
And knit together in all riches of the full assurance of understanding.

By these words, in all riches of the full assurance of understanding,
Interpretation.
etc. we are to understand the Faith of the Gospel, as may appear by the
words following, where the Apostle does explane himself, that this full
assurance of understanding, is a knowledge of the mystery of God, even the
Father of Christ, and in him a gracious Father unto us, now this Faith is here
described and set out, by the general nature of it, that it is an
understanding, or knowledge and that further amplified by the quality of it,
that it is a certain, or an assured knowledge, a full persuasion of
understanding, so the word signifies, and again by the measure of that
certainty in these words in all riches, which is a borrowed phrase to signify
plenty, and a great measure.

Thus then are these words briefly to be conceived.

In the faith of the Gospel, which is a most plentiful and infallible
certainty of understanding.

Here first we are to mark that the Apostle was not content to say, they
being knit together in love, but he adds further, and knit together in the
true Faith of Jesus Christ, (for that is the general here set down in other
terms) hence arises this conclusion.

Joining together in love and in one and the same true faith must go together
as we must be knit together in love, so we must b^^ conjoined in one and the
same true faith: these two man not be divorced, nor put a sunder one from the
th^^, for as the Apostle teaches, without one faith, th^^ cannot be one body
we may observe it, Ephesians. 4. wh^^ he has spoken of one body, verse 4. he
subioy^^ verse 5. one faith giving us to understand, that there cannot be one
body, without one faith, no, though it be of such as are knit together most
nearly by some ^^tward bond, for example by the bond of marriage, ^^^ husband
and wife are not one body, under the same head Christ Jesus, unless they be
knit together in the ^^^^ true faith of Jesus Christ, they are indeed one
flesh by the bond of marriage, as they have relation one to another, but in
relation to Christ the head of all true b^^^^uers, they are not knit together
in one body, if they (...) disioyned in faith, A duty of such as enter into
that near union of marriage.
to them it may most fitly be applied, they are to look that they join
together, not only in mutual love one to another but in one and the same
faith of Jesus Christ, and against this do they offend, who join in that
near bond of marriage with such as be not of the same faith, and the same
religion, it is good for us to be advised in matching our children or our
selves in marriage, and that we especially look at the truth of faith, and
the soundness of religion.

Note.
Let us know that it is a secret poison that destroys virtue more then any
thing, when the godly are vn^^^^ly yoaked with the ungodly; Let us not stand
upon our wisdom in this point, that we are wise, and able to avoid the
danger, remember that Solomon was full of wisdom, and beloved of God, yet for
all his wisdom, he was overthrown by matching with the daughters of the
wicked, it is said of Iehoram, that he forsook the way of the Lord, and
wrought all wickedness in full measure, and why? because says the text, the
daughter of Ahab was his wife, and let this warn all, whom it may concern,
that in matching our selves, or our children in marriage, we look cheifely to
the truth and soundness of religion.

The next thing offered from these words, if we look on them as a description
of faith is, that true faith for the True faith in the general nature of it is
a knowledge of things to be believed.
and evidence and light of spiritual knowledge is the general nature of true
faith, the special form and proper act of it, is an apprehension, and a
particular application of the saving promise known, and of Christ promised,
the substance of the covenant of grace, but the general nature of it, it is a
knowledge of things to be believed, hence it is that the Lord says by his
Prophet, Isay. 53.11. by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many
etc. and our Savior Ioh. 17.3. this is life eternal, that they know thee to
be the only very God, and whom thou have sent Jesus Christ, the Apostle 1.
Pet. 3.15. teaches us to be ready always to give an account, to make an
apology, and to stand in defense of our hope, which cannot be without
knowledge, Augustine proves by the text of the Apostle, Romans 10.14. where it
is said, faith comes by hearing etc. that faith is joined with knowledge, for
how can a man believe by hearing that he understand, not, it is then a clear
point, that faith for the general nature of it, is a light of understanding,
it will be said, and indeed it is the objection of the Papists, Ob.
who hold faith to be no knowledge, but a bare assent of mind without
understanding of that, whereunto the mind assenteth, that the Apostle 1. Cor.
13.2. makes a plain distinction between knowledge and faith, and does sever
them as being two sundry things, if I knew all secrets and all knowledge, yea
if I had all faith etc. therefore (say they) faith is not a knowledge. We may
not think that we have true faith wanting knowledge of things to be believed.
and is not able to render any reasonable account of his faith, what he does
hold and believe needful to salvation, he that so thinks deceiues himself,
and let it be thought on by such as come to the Table of the Lord, herein
stands one part of their examination they are to examine their knowledge in the
doctrine of the Sacraments touching the Sacramental relation of the signs
with the things signified, I say not, if men have illumination and knowledge,
then they have faith, for illumination is a common gift, and though it be from
the spirit, yet is it not of the spirit; Note.
but this I dare be bold to say, If there be no knowledge, then there is no
faith: it is the first action of the Spirit of God, in the renouation of the
image of God in his Elect, to renew them in the Spirit of their minds, Ephesians.
4.23. If there be darkness in the mind, certainly, there is nothing but sin
in all other faculties of the soul. Our Savior says, Mat. 6.23. If the eye
be dark, then all thy body shall be dark, it is a true saying that one has,
that an ignorant heart is always a sinful heart, and a man without knowledge
is a man without grace, let this be thought on, and let it stir us up to
follow the counsel of the wiseman, Pro. 2.3, to call for wisdom, and to cry
to heaven by prayer for understanding, and by use of all good means hearing,
reading, meditating in the word of God, and to seek for it, yea to dig for
it, as for gold and precious stones, and a little to help forward our desire
and endeavor after knowledge, remember the words of the Apostle, 2. These.
1.7.8. that the Lord Jesus at the day of judgment shall show himself from
heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, rendering vengeance unto them
that do not know God and which obey not unto the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ, these two following close one upon another, ignorance of God, and want
of obedience unto the Gospel of Christ, and this ignorance is so foul a sin
as it shall be sufficient to bring down vengeance on them in whom it shall
be found at the coming of Christ to judgment.

Come we from the general nature of Faith, to the quality True faith is a
distinct certain and infallible knowledge.
that it is a full assurance and infallible certainty of knowledge, and that a
rich or plentiful knowledge, much might be spoken on these words, but that I
will briefly note from th^^ shall be this.

That true Faith is not a confused notion wrapped up altogether in uncertainty,
so as a man cannot be sure what he holds, or believes, but it is a distinct, a
certain and an infallible knowledge, which makes a demonstration in the mind
of the believer grounded not on reason, or sense, but upon divine testimony,
and upon the word of God. Hence Hebrews 11.1. it is said to be the evidence
of things which are not seen, (that is) the infallible demonstration and
certainty, whereby the mind being continued by divine testimony, does most
firmly embrace the promises of God touching remission of sins, and
justification by Christ, the Scripture is most plentiful in the proof of this.

Popish implicit faith no true faith.
where then is any place for implicit Faith taught by the Papists, who say it
is sufficient for a Christian to believe as the Church believes, though he
never know distinctly and certainly what the Church believes, this is indeed no
true Faith, but a blockish ignorance, and this doctrine tends to hold men in
blindness superstition and perpetual ignorance, we are to renounce it, and to
remember that true Faith is a distinct certain and infallible knowledge, yet
that this doctrine be not a snare to entangle and perplexe the consciences of
the weak, remember further, that though true faith be a distinct, certain,
and infallible knowledge, yet it is not a perfect knowledge Father Latimer said
well, there is great difference between certain knowledge, and clear or
perfect knowledge, certain knowledge may be of things absent that appear not,
but clear or perfect knowledge requires the presence of the object, it is
said we see now darkely as through a glass^. A man may therefore distinctly and
certainly know that which he believes, though not clearly and perfectly, and
this may comfort such as have but a little portion of saving knowledge, if it
be certain, though weak, it is pleasing to Go^ and comfortable to themselves,
if so be they content not themselves with it, but labor to increase it, and
to grow from one measure to another, for so will every one that has any
beginning of saving knowledge, he that thinks he has a portion of saving
knowledge, and contents himself with it, and never labors to increase it, and
to come to a rich assurance of knowledge, has indeed no true knowledge at all.

Now to the last words of this verse, which are as I showed, added by way of
opposition, as an explication of that word (understanding) what it is (namely)
knowledge of the mystery of God, to which is subioyned how God is revealed in
that mystery (namely) in distinction of persons (even the Father of Christ, and
Christ the soon of the Father.

To know the mystery of God, even the Father, and of Christ.] By the word
mystery having this addition, Interpretation.
the Mystery of God, and God distinguished into the Father and Son, We are to
understand the Gospel which is the doctrine of the humiliation, exaltation,
humanity, divinity, office of meditation, and all things concerning the life
and death of Christ, and this doctrine is called a mystery, as heretofore I
have showed, because the things delivered in the Gospel are wonderful, deep,
and secret, hid from the eye of natural reason, and made known only by
divine revelation, and in this mystery of the Gospel is God revealed to be
the Father of Christ, and Christ to be the Son of God the Father, thus then
are these words to be conceived as if the Apostle had said.

To know the deep secret, and hidden mystery of the Gospel, manifesting and
revealing unto us God, as he is the Father of Christ, and Christ the son of
the Father, and God equal to his Father.

Now we are to mark that Faith being (as ye have heard) for the general
nature a knowledge, it is here further set out together with the object of
that knowledge, together with that thing whereof it is a knowledge, that it is
a knowledge of the mystery of God (that is) of the Gospel revealing God the
Father, and the mediator Christ Jesus. Hence arises this point of doctrine
that the proper object of the knowledge of Faith is the doctrine of the True
saving faith is a knowledge of God revealed in the mystery of the Gospel.


It is not a knowledge of God revealed in the book of the creatures, spoken
of, Romans 1.20. nor a knowledge of God revealed in the moral Law of God, where
God requires absolute, complete, perfect, and personal righteousness, which
if any could reach unto, he should be fully acceptable to God, and needed not
to fly to Christ to be his redeemer, but comfortable and saving Faith is a
knowledge of God as he is made known in the covenant of grace, in the
Gospel, even a light and knowledge of the glorious majesty of the mystery of
God in the face of Jesus Christ as says the Apostle 2. Cor. 4.6. and hence it
(...) that the Apostle Romans 10.3. says, though the Jews knew the
righteousness which is of the Law and went about to stablish it, yet they were
ignorant, and had no knowledge of true righteousness, the righteousness of
God and the righteousness of Faith, and in the same chapter, verse ^ he calls
the word of the Gospel, the word of Faith, ^^^ing that word which saving Faith
does properly eye^ (...) has respect unto, for indeed the drift and scope of
all the oracles of God, and of the whole Scriptures, is, and (...) was, to lead
Gods elect to the knowledge of the s^^ing promise, and of Christ promised the
substance of the Go^pell; and howsoever Moses gave a Law which by r^^^on of our
corruption is the minister of death, yet wrote he also of Christ, John 5.46.
and did foreshew the death and passion of Christ for sin, in many types and
figures (...) the Brazen serpent and in the sacrifices of the ceremonial law,
yea the drift of the moral Law it self, was to bring to Christ, Galath. 3.34.
it being the end and scope of the whole Scripture to lead the chosen of God
to the knowledge of the saving promise unto faith, for saving faith has
respect unto the saving promise it must need, be that faith is a knowledge of
God revealed in the mystery of the gospel.

Reproof of them that rest in a confused and superstitious knowledge of God.
when he has only a superficial and confused knowledge of God, such
knowledge of God as may be had by the light of nature, or such as may be
gathered by the sight of the creatures, is there any such among Christians will
some say? I answer, undoubtedly this exhortation is not unseasonable in
respect of many that profess christianity, many there be who having lived in
the bosom of the Church, and in the clear light of the gospel, ten, twenty,
thirty, yea forty or fifty years, and yet (to their shame may it be spoken)
have no more true and saving knowledge of God, as God has revealed himself in
the Gospel then the very heathen, who never heard of Christ, and that I may not
seem to accuse, but to prove that I speak, do not most men and women imagine
they know God, as he is revealed in the Gospel, when they conceive him to be a
God all of mercy, and that the Gospel makes known nothing but his mercy,
grace and goodness in Christ Jesus. I appeal to the hearts of many, whether they
do not thus Now what is this, but to misconceiue of God, and to set up an idol
in their own brain, for in the Gospel God is made known unto us to be
perfectly just, and perfectly merciful, yea which is a deep mystery, Note.
that the justice and mercy of God are reconciled, and that both his perfect
justice, and his perfect mercy, are met together and expressed toward his
chosen in Christ, if we thus know not God, we do not know him as he has
revealed himself in the Gospel, and yet many having not this knowledge fancy
to themselves they have faith, and do not stick to say, though they want
knowledge they have a good mind, mark how the holy ghost has met with this
fancy, without knowledge the mind is not good, Pro. 19.2.
it is not possible the mind should be good without knowledge. Thus have I
showed, without knowledge of the saving promise of God revealed in the Gospel,
it is not possible that any should have faith. Let no man then deceive himself
and think he has faith, and yet know not God in the face of Jesus Christ, let
us all labor by the use of all good means, craving assistance of the spirit
of God, who only reuealeth the deep things of God, 1. Cor. 2.10.
that we may come to the knowledge of God manifested in the Gospel, and
consider we this one thing, that the want of true faith is the cause of all
judgments, it brings plagues of all kinds upon our souls bodies, goods, and
good names, yea it is the cause of those judgments, we many times foolishly
ascribe to wiches and wizards, when Gods hand is upon us in some strange
manner, we ascribe it to witches, and wizards, but indeed it is a wicked
heart of unbelief that has brought that judgment upon us, that is the witch
we may observe in Jude epist. 5. verse. that the people that were delivered out
of Egypt, were afterward destroyed, but why? for their murmuring, their
fornication, their tempting of God, their reuiling of Moses? no, though these
sins were common amongst them, yet says the text, they were destroyed for
their unbelief; therefore let us never rest till we have a measure of saving
knowledge of God as he has revealed himself in the Gospel; what the word
mystery does afford, I will not stand upon, having before spoken of the point;
the next thing we are to mark, is, that the Apostle says to know God, and
he stays not there, but says further, God the Father, and in Christ his
Son.

It is not enough to know that God is one in essence but we must also know him
distinguished in three persons.
the Father, Son, and holy ghost, all eternal and equal in power, glory and
majesty, only one true and everliving God, I say distinguished in persons, for
we must not conceive the persons in the Trinity, as divided and severed one
from another, ^s three men are really divided one from another, though all of
one kind, for the divine essence is infinite, and admits no division, but the
whole essence of the godhead is in every person.

We must look upon the unity of the divine essence of the trinity of persons
with a spiritual eye of faith
and that will keep us from many dangerous errors, but to hold to the words
of the Apostle in this place, know thus much, that God is the Father of Christ
in respect of his deity by nature, because he is of the same eternal essence
with the Father, and of his humanity by personal union, because his humanity
is assumed, and does subsist in his deity, John 1.14. the word was made flesh.
Thus is Christ the son of God.

There remains a doubt to be removed, occasioned from these words.

Some may say,

I answer, it is true, Peter's confession, Matthew 16.16. though the Papists
allege it to the contrary; our Sauioars answer in the next verse, flesh and
blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven, puts it
out of all question, that Peter's confession was more then a general knowledge,
and confession, that may be in Devils, unless we say the Devils made the
same by the holy ghost, which were most absurd and blasphemous, there is then
in faith for the general nature of it, a knowledge that Christ is the Son of
God, and there is a particular acknowledgement and application of it with
comfort, and this we are to labor for.

VER. 3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
In this verse for the matter of it, is laid down the first general
proposition that is handled in this chapter, namely that proposition which the
Apostle does labor to strengthen and persuade the Colosians, to embrace and to
hold fast, and it is this.

The first general proposition handled in this chapter.
That in Christ full and perfect knowledge of all things needful to salvation
is to be found.

Now this proposition is not plainly in these terms delivered, but it lies
under a similitude, wherein Christ is likened to a treasury, or an house of
store, and this knowledge to a treasure, and the Apostle says in him are laid
up fast and close all the treasures of this knowledge.

For the better clearing of the text let us enter into a more special
examination of the words.

Interpretation.
(In whom) the original word may be rendered (in whom or in which) for they
may be referred either to the word (mystery) or to Christ, all is one in the
sense and meaning of the Apostle, for the matter and substance of the Gospel
is Christ, and we are to acknowledge no other Christ but he that is set
before us in the Gospel, but the most received translation is (in whom) with
relation to Christ, (all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, (i) the most
excellent and precious things of wisdom and knowledge, and we are to
understand by the word (wisdom) the knowledge of things to be known and
believed; and by the word knowledge the knowledge of things to be practiced
(are hid) (i) are not known in respect of natural men and natural reason.
Thus then conceive the words of the Apostle, as if he had said, in which Christ
ar^ the most excellent and precious things needful: To be known either
concerning faith, or good life to be found, though hid from natural men, and
natural reason.

Now first of all, the matter and substance of this verse, that in Christ all
things needful to be known to salvation are to be found being considered
together with the similitude under which it is delivered, does afford this
conclusion.

That Christ is the storehouse of all saving and comfortable knowledge, in him
is all saving knowledge laid up, as in an house of store, Christ is the
storehouse of all saving and comfortable knowledge
and from him only it must be derived, from him only must we fetch all
saving knowledge, for why? in Christ is treasured up the knowledge of the
divine essence and nature, he being very God, 1. John 5.20. the knowledge of
the majesty and power of God manifested by his miracles, and resurrection, the
knowledge of the justice, goodness, love and mercy of God made known by his
coming into the world, and suffering of death, 1. Tim. 1.15. Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, the knowledge of the work of creation, Colos.
1.16.
government and preservation of the world, Heb. 1.3. he does sustain or bear
up all things by his mighty word, etc. In a word, the knowledge of the
reconciliation, redemption, and salvation of Gods chosen, and of eternal life
and glory reserved in heaven for them, all these are points of saving knowledge
to which all others may be reduced, and these are all to be found in Christ,
and only in him with comfort, he is the volume in which all these, and all
other points of saving knowledge are written, revealed and made known to us.
Hence then of necessity it follows, that the knowledge The knowledge of any
thing out of Christ is not a comfortable knowledge.
a knowledge tending to salvation, but rather to destruction and damnation for
example (houlding our selves to the Apostles similitude) a knowledge of any
merit, any satisfaction to God, and of any treasure of the Church out of
Christ. The Papists would bear us in hand that they know a treasure belonging
to the infinite treasure of the satisfaction purchased by the passion of Christ
out of Christ, and what is that? forsooth the passions of the blessed Virgin
Mary, and of all other Saints, who suffered more as they blasphemously speak)
then their sins required, this is no saving and comfortable knowledge, but an
accursed and damnable knowledge, indeed a fancy and dream of their own, it
is at jar and discord within it self, for how can that which is infinite
admit any thing to be adjoined and added unto it, they acknowledge an
infinite treasure of satisfaction in Christ, and yet they say there belongs to
it other satisfactions, what is this but with one and the same breath to
contradict themselves? I leave them therefore to vanish in their gain sayings,
and come to our selves upon this ground.

There is no comfort in the knowledge of God out of Christ, and much less in
the knowledge of any other thing.
that for us to know any thing out of Christ, though the thing it self be
good, yea even goodness it self, yea God himself, yet there is no comfort in
such knowledge out of Christ, we know him but as an angry judge, and as a God
clothed with justice and judgment against us, yea to descend lower to things
familiar, and of daily use with us, to know things given unto us of God, either
spiritual or temporal, either concerning the good of our souls as the word
and Sacraments, etc. or the good of our bodies, as meat, drink, apparel,
house or land, etc. to know these things to be blessings of God, is not
sufficient, that is no comfortable knowledge, yet many rest in that knowledge,
and think it enough if they can say, God has blessed them with such (...) such
things, the heathens were able to say so, there i^ (...) comfort in such
knowledge, our knowledge of things (...) us of God must go a step further, it
must be ground^d (...) Christ that it may be comfortable: we must labor to know
good things given us, not only to be blessings of God in themselves, but
blessings to us, in and by Jesus Christ, (...) must endeavor to use the Apostles
form of praise and thank^giuing; blessed be God who has blessed us with
spirit^^^ yea and with the temporal blessings we do enjoy, in Christ. Some may
say how is that to be done? understand to thy discomfort, that the good things
given unto thee are but given thee to leave thee without execuse, and for
further increase of thy condemnation. Let this be thought on, and let it stir
us up to labor to have our knowledge of al things we enjoy in this life,
grounded in the merit of Christ, the storehouse and fountain of all saving
knowledge. The next thing we are to mark is, that the knowledge of things
needful to be known to salvation, laid up in Christ, is delivered, not in
plain terms, but under this comparison, (the treasure of wisdom and
knowledge) hence we may take up this conclusion.

That saving knowledge, or knowledge and wisdom unto Saving knowledge found
only in Christ is a thing most precious.
it is a treasure of inestimable worth and excellency, the Apostle sets it
down as a thing whereof he was fully resolved that nothing in the world was
able to come near the worth and excellency of this, other things compared with
this, he held them as loss and dung, yea doubtless (says he) I think all
things but loss for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
whom I have counted all things loss, and do judge them to be dung, that I
might win Christ, he says he esteemed not, he made no account of knowing any
thing save Jesus Christ and him crucified, join to this that of the wiseman,
where he says the merchandise of this is better then the merchandise of
silver, and the gain thereof is better then gold, Prou. 3.14.15.16.17.18.
it is more precious then pearls, and all things that thou can desire, are
not to be compared unto her, etc.

The reason of this is plain. Mat. 16.26.
where he gives us to understand, that if a man should gain the whole world,
it would do him no good, and all in respect of his everlasting good, that
gain may stand with the loss of heaven and everlasting happiness, therefore
saving knoweledge found in Christ, is a thing of far greater worth then any
thing in the world.

We must labor to be persuaded of the excellency of saving knowledge, and to
affect it according to the excellency of it.
and to be affected toward it accordingly, we must have our affections
enlarged, and have even a covetous desire after this same heavenly treasure
(this is an holy covetousness) yea, with the wise Merchant, Mat. 13.45. that
seeks good pearls, and having found this pearl of great price, we are to
sell all we have, we are to renounce all that nature has endued us withal
and to despise and set light by all the profits, pleasures, honors and
preferments of this life that we may purchase this pearl of such excellent
worth; and this exhortation was never more needful then now in these days
wherein most men and women have their hearts set upon the world, and though
they have liberty and opportunity, yea, persuasion and encouragement, to store
up the treasures found in Jesus Christ, yet they through greedy desire of the
corruptible and casual treasures of the world, are wholly withheld from
seeking this one thing only necessary, what is the cause of this, let us
consider the cause of it, that finding that, we may labor to remove it, that
so the effect may fall to the ground, surely, the cause of it is this, men are
possessed with that conc^^t, of the Laodiceans, Revel. 3.17. that they are
rich, and need not the riches of Christ, to make them truly rich, they find
not themselves to stand in need of the precious treasures found in Christ to
enrich them, they go on in a fearful dullness and deadness of heart, and
do neither see nor feel their own poverty, and wretchedness.

Happily some will say we confess our selves to be sinners, therefore we
cannot think such a wicked thought, Ob.
that we have no need of Christ.

I answer to them that plead thus for themselves,

Consider we further but this one thing saving knowledge in Christ will stand
by us and comfort us when all things in the world forsake us, Note.
do not we see riches taken away from men, or elsemen taken suddenly away
from their riches, neither their silver nor their gold is able to deliver them
in the day of the Lords wrath, etc. Zephan. 1.18. but saving knowledge in
Christ is durable riches, Pro. 8.18. it is a treasure that will continue for
ever and minister comfort in the greatest extremity. Let us then in wisdom
affect this treasure and seek after it and even despise all things in the
world in respect of it, that so we may lay up in store a good foundation
against the time to come.

One thing more observe we, the Apostle says the excellent and precious
knowledge of things needful to be known to salvation are hid in Christ.

This considered, together with the relative to whom i^ is hid (namely) to
natural men, does offer this known conclusion.

The excellency and worth of saving knowledge is not known to every man.
yet it is not apparent to (...) man's eye, every man sees not the luster and
beauty ^f this precious knowledge, every man's mind is not (...) to comprehend
the worth of it, no not any man's mind but only their minds that are opened and
enlightened by the Spirit of God, Math. 16.17. our Savior says to Pet^^, upon
his confession that he was the Christ, flesh and blood had not revealed that
unto him, but his Father which it i^ heaven 1. Cor. 2.14. the natural man
perceives not the things of the spirit of God: for they are foolishness vn^^
him, neither can he know them, he has neither pow^^ nor possibility in
himself to know them, let him labo^^ and strive never so much, why? because
they are spiritually discerned.

The reason

Let then as many as have it revealed unto them b^e thankful to God; it is
esteemed a great favor if a rich king show to any the house of his Treasure.
Hezekiah to gratify the King of Babels Ambassador that brought him letters
and a present, They that have the excellency of saving knowledge revealed unto
them are to be thankful to God for the same.
showed them the house of the treasures, the silver and the gold, and the
spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, etc. how
great a favor then is it for the Lord, the King of heaven and earth, to show
to us, yea to give us eyes to see with comfort, the riches and treasures found
in his treasury even in Jesus Christ better then all the riches and treasures
of the world, how much are we in this regard bound to magnify the Lords
mercy, he has not so dealt with every one, we may see thousands left in this
blindness not able to see the things we see, yea we may see in them our own
image, what we were before the Lord put a difference between them and us. Let
it therefore stir up as many as have their eyes opened to see with comfort the
rich treasures found in Christ, to magnify and praise the Lord for so great a
mercy; yea let our hearts be enlarged, and mouths opened to praise the Lord
for the comfortable sight of this excellent treasure when it pleases him to
strip us of earthly riches which happily we had in great abundance. Let us in
such a case and time with David Psalm. 42.11. Psalm. 42.11.
rouse up our fainting souls and say, why art thou cast down my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? Wait on God, for I will yet notwithstanding
all this give thanks to the Lord. It is the council of the preacher, Eccles.
7.16.
In the day of wealth be of good comfort, and in the day of affliction
consider, and what is a man, that is the child of God, then consider? surely
among other things this, that God has opened to him the door of his Jewel
house, and let him see to his great comfort the tresures that are found in
Christ; this a child of God ought to consider in time of the loss of outward
riches, the consideration of this will swallow up all grief for the loss of
those things, and make him still lift up his heart and open his mouth to bless
the Lord and to say with David, I will yet give him thanks, for notwithstanding
I have suffered great loss in outward things, yet I still see to my comfort
the Treasures that are found in Christ, and I have still my part in them which
are better then all the treasures in the world.

VER. 4. And this I say lest any man should beguile y^^ with entising words.
In this verse is laid down the second general proposition handled in this
chapter The second general proposition handled in this chapter.
(namely) this.

That all things out of Christ are mere deceit and nothing worth.

And this proposition is delivered together with the Apostles purpose in
propounding of the former, that he laid before the Colossians the former
proposition to this end, that they might not be deceived by any thing tendered
unto them out of Christ, all things out of him being meer^ deceit, the
connection is this.

I tell you that in Christ is to be found full and perfect knowledge of all
things needful to salvation, and thi^ I speak to this end, that you may be
kept from seduce (...) of deceauers, such as go about to thrust upon you any
thing out of Christ in the matter of salvation, I tell you their words are but
entising flattering words, their p^^pose is to beguile you, this I say least
any should beguile you, etc.

So then in this verse we have the end of the propounding of the former
proposition, that it was to keep the Colossians from being deceived by
seducers, together with the manner and means whereby false impostors, and
false teachers commonly use to deceive (namely) by entising words, somethings
are to be cleared in the words of this verse, the word translated (beguile)
does properly signify to deceive the ignorant, and simple in reasoning with
them, thrusting upon them an error by false and deceitful arguments, and
reasons (with entising words) (that is) with colorable speech, probable and
plausible, carrying a show of truth, when indeed there is no truth in it, and
having in it a power to persuade.

Thus then the words are to be conceived.

This I say least any man in reasoning with you cunningly and deceitfully
should deceive you, and impose errors upon you, and that by m^anes of his
fair probable and deceitful speech.

First, we are here to mark, that the Apostle taught the Colossians, that in
Christ is found full and perfect knowledge of all things needful to salvation,
not only to this end, that they might know this and believe it, but that they
might by the knowledge of it be kept from error, that they might thereby be
armed and made able to stand against cunning seducers, such as should go about
to beguile them, and to corrupt them with error, under color of truth by
fair, slattering, plausible speeches. This observed the conclusion following
hence is this.

That sound knowledge of the truth, is not only good in Sound knowledge of the
truth is not only good in it self, but it is also an excellent preservative
against the delusions of cunning seducers.
and a notable means to keep us from being deceived by such as labor to
corrupt us with error. We find it worthily expressed by Solomon, Prou
2.10.11.12. When wisdom enters into thine heart, and knowledge delights
thy soul.

Then shall counsel preserve thee, and understanding shall keep thee.

And deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaks froward
things, (that is) from the man whose mouth utters error, false doctrine, or
enticement to sin, Ephesians. 4. the Apostle shows that Christ gave gifts to men,
some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists and some Pastors
and teachers, ver. 11. for the building up of his body the Church, in faith and
knowledge, and then ver. the 14. he shows the use of that knowledge (namely)
this that we henceforth be no more children wavering, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the deceit of men and with craftiness, whereby they
lay wait to deceive. But that we might be provided against the deceit and
craftiness of men, which is a plain proof of the point in hand, that sound
knowledge is a notable means to preserve us from being overtaken by the craft
of Seducers; and the reason index sui and obliqui, whereby they are able to
discover what is agreeable to the truth, and what is erroneous and contrary to
the truth, and so cannot be ouer-reached and circumuented by such as go about
to deceive them with error; would we then in these dangerous days wherein so
many lie in wait to seduce, If we would be kept upright in the truth in the
throng of many deceivers we must labor for sound knowledge of the truth.
use with diligence the ordinances of God appointed to that end to beget
knowledge, it is a reasoning of the flesh, and a beguiling argument forced upon
some men by strong delusion of Satan, to say thus, there be many seducers, many
that go about to deceive, therefore we will neither hear one nor other, or if we
hear we will believe never a Preacher of them all, this is not the way to
keep our selves from being deceived, no, this is the way to make us a fit prey
for seducers, to seize upon, such men as use thus to speak will hear and
believe profane and filthy persons, such as will lead th^n to lust and
lewdness, to drunkenness and all exc^sse of riot, they will hear and believe
such as will fill their ears with false tales, and slanderous reports, and
poison their hearts with malice against their brethren, but they hold it
dangerous to hear and believe such as labor to instruct them in the truth; as
if there were no danger of contagion but from them, it is all one as if they
should thus speak, there is none more subject to be drawn out of the way,
then such as use the best means to know the right way, or there is much poison
scattered in many places, therefore at any hand take heed of preservatives
against it, for what is it but sound knowledge of the truth, gotten by
careful, and conscionable attending on the means, that will descry the venom
of pestilent opinions, and preserve us from infection by them, and make us able
to try all things and to hold that which is good, let us then labor for
soundnes of knowledge.

But will some say, alas,

Indeed,

The next thing we have here to mark is, that the Apostle says, not least
any should force, or by violence drive you from this truth, but least any
should beguile you, and under the color of reason deceive you, and least any
by paralogisme and deceitful reasoning with you, should draw you to error,
hence arises this conclusion,

In matters of faith and religion there is greater danger from seducement then
from violence.
in matter of religion there is greater danger of corruption by smooth
deceivers, then there is of hurt by open persecutours, 2. Cor. 11.2. the
Apostle faith, in this regard he was jealous over the Corinthians, and verse
3. he feared least the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so their
minds should he corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ, he shows
the reason of that jealousy and fear verse 13.14.15. because false Apostles
were deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ,
and no marvel says the Apostle, for Satan, whose ministers they are, i^
transformed into an Angel of light, and therefore it is no great thing, though
his ministers be so, the reason of the Apostle stands thus, which is also a
reason and proof of the point in hand.

Ioab 2. Sam. 29.9. Judas and many others.

Now this being so, that in matters of religion, there is We must warily avoid
the pestilent breath of deceivers in matters of religion.
then of hurt by open persecutors, it must teach us to be most wary that the
pestilent breath of deceivers never infect us. Let us keep our ears from
harkening to their smooth persuasions, as we would refrain from one that had
some infectious disease upon him, and let us follow the counsel of our
Savior, Mat. 7.15. beware of false Prophets, which come to you in sheep
clothing, but inwardly they are ravening woolues.

How shall we know false teachers? Ob.


Our Savior has taught us in the next verse, Paul a persecutour was
unblameable, touching the righteousness which is in the Law, Phil. 3.6. and he
demeaned himself, so as no man could justly tax him, then doubtless a
deceiuer, who puts on a visard of holiness, of purpose to deceive may seem to
us to excel in holiness, if we judge of him by that appearance we may be
deceived, it is therefore the proper fruit of a Prophet as he is a Prophet
(namely) his doctrine by which we are to judge of him, and this is clear by
the like speech, Luke 6.44. every tree (...), if then the doctrine be good,
the teacher as he is a teacher is good, for he must not only be a teacher,
but a pattern of good works, with vncorrupt doctrine, with gravity and
integrity, Tit. 2.7. if then we would know a true teacher from a false, let us
look to his doctrine, and as S. John says, 1. Epist. 4.1. try the spirits
(that is) the doctrines of men, if we find them consonant and consenting with
the word of God, founded on Jesus Christ incarnate, and propounding spiritual
worship of God, agreeable to his will and nature, then is the teacher a true
teacher, but if otherwise we find his doctrine, either dissenting from the
word, or not grounded on Jesus Christ incarnate, or as the Apostle says, Gal.
6.12. making a fair show in the flesh; then let us take heed of him, and not
suffer such an one to disgorge his venom into our bosoms, there is greater
danger from him then from an open and professed enemy of religion; and that we
may yet further see the danger that comes by deceivers, consider we this one
thing,

Note.
He that is violently forced, and by terror overcome, and by extremity of
tortures and pain made to deny the known truth sins greatly, yet he may
retain the knowledge of the truth, and afterward he may repent and rise
again, and come to confess it, but he that is drawn away by imposters and
deceit, not only falls from the confession of the truth, but loses the
knowledge of the truth and emb^^ceth error in steed of truth, and at length
comes to this, that the truth he before loved and confessed he now hates, and
does persecute with bitter enmity and oppositions against it, examples of this
kind we have in Scripture as Himineus and Philetus, Hermogenes and Alexander
the copper smith.

We must warily avoid the infection of deceivers also in matters of life and
manners.
and in that deceivers are so dangerous we are to think upon it further, and
it must teach us most warily to avoid the infection of deceivers, not only in
matters of faith, but in matters of life and manners, for doubtless as Solomon
says, Prou, 11.9. an hypocrite with his mouth hurts his neighbor, he does not
only corrupt his mind with erroneous opinions, but many time stir up his
heart to sinful lusts, and pervert his ways to ungodly behavior: In plain
terms we are most heedfully, and warily to avoid such as persuade us to any
sin, under color of pleasure, profit or preferment, and so seek to beguile
us, they are more dangerous enemies of our souls, then such as go about to
force us to sin, and we are in special manner to take heed of our own
inborne beguiling enemy, I mean our natural corruption, the serpent that lies
in our own bosom, that is a deceiving enemy, the greatest enemy we have,
even greater then the Devil though he be a seducer to sin, Note.
the Devil could never prevail to bring us to any sin but by means of
that, it may seem strange that any man should play the Sophister with
himself, yet thus men do, by means of their own inborne corruption, for
example, such as are only hearers of the word, and not doers of it, they
through their own corruption think all is well enough with them and so play
the Sophisters with themselves, Iam. 1 22. be ye doers of the word and not
hearers only deceiving your own souls, this beguiling enemy our own
corruption* makes men many times think they have faith, when indeed it is
nothing but pride and presumption, and that that they repent when it is nothing
but a deceitful counterfetting and hypocrisy, we must therefore especially
take heed of this beguling dangerous enemy.

Some may say, how is that to be done?

I answer, Paul, 2. Corinthians. 12.9. my grace is sufficient for thee.

Secondly, we are to carry, and cherish in our hearts an universal hatred of
all and every sin, Psalm. 119.128. I esteem all thy precepts most just, and
hate all false ways; and not to give liberty to our own corruption, to
break out into any known sin, we cannot but sin as long as we are in this
life, but let it be against our purpose, and if we thus search and find out
own corruption, and be instant with the Lord for strength of grace against it,
and carry in a universal hatred of every known sin, we shall be able, in
some measure, to decline the deceit of our own beguiling corruption.

Come we to the manner and means whereby false teachers use to deceive in the
words following (with entising words) That which is offered unto us from
hence, is this.

False teachers for the most part have sweet tongues
as the Lord says by his Prophet Ierem. 23.31.32. Behold I will come against
the Prophets, says the Lord, which have sweet tongues etc. deceivers commonly
bring probable reasons and perswasiue arguments, and as the Apostle says, Romans
16.18. with fair speech they deeiue the simple,

We are not to esteem of aany speech in matters of faith by the outward hebit
and form of words.
because they come provided with intising and glosing speeches, and have taught
their tongues to speak lies, etc. Ierem. 9.5. And under glorious titles of
Church, of Councels, Fathers, Antiquity, Consent, etc. have ensnared many a
simple soul: but it serves also, to teach us, not to esteem of any speech,
especially in matters of faith, by the outward habit and form of words, and
as it is clothed with likelihood, or probability, for so we may be deceived,
for example, when the Papists say, it is not likely that our provident Savior
Jesus Christ, in the institution of the Sacrament of his Supper, would deliver
it in obscure and ambiguous terms, because that might cause much strife, and
contention, and the mistaking of it might breed Idolatry, that we worship for
Christ, that which is not Christ, or impiety, that we should not give to it,
being Christ, God, and man, divine honor, here is a probable speech, but
indeed no truth in it, if we look beyond the probability of it, for Christ did
not deliver his mind in the institution of the sacrament in obscure terms, but
after the manner of the Scripture in such terms as were usual and common to
sacraments, as might be proved, again their inference that the mistaking of it
might breed idolatry, is grounded on a mere device of their own, for there is
no worship due to the sacrament, and so no danger of idolatry, thus then we see
we are not to esteem of any speech by the likelihood, but we are to examine the
substance of it, yea, let us never measure any doctrine by the outward manner
of delivering of it: it is just with the Lord to make such as hear men in
respect of eloquence and outward ornaments, to hear without profit, because
they depend upon the wit of men, and not upon the wisdom of God, who only does
create the fruit of the lips to be peace Isay. 17.19. a speech worthy marking,
it is as proper to the Lord to give peace and comfort by the speech of man, as
to give being and form to a creature, and therefore as man is not able to do
the one, no more can he do the other, so it is just with the Lord let them
hear without profit who depend upon the wit and eloquence of man.

VER. 5. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
rejoicing and beholding your order, and your stedf^st faith in Christ.
This ver. depends on the former as a reeson of the Apostles care expressed
in the former ver. that the Colossians might be kept from the seducement of
such as should go about to beguile them with enticing words the reason is
this, because the Apostle was acquainted with the state and condition of their
Church, and this reason is couched together with an answer to a question they
might make, how he should come to the knowledge of their state, being absent,
and far removed from them, to this the Apostle answers that though he was
absent in the flesh, yet was he with them in the Spirit, rejoicing and
beholding their order and their steadfast faith in Christ.

This is the sum and substance of this verse, in it we have more
particularly these things to consider.

First, a prevention of a question that might be made by the Colossians, how
possibly the Apostle could come to be acquainted with their estate, seeing he
was absent from the^ this the Apostle meets withal in the first words by a
distinction, that his absence was in regard of his body and not of his spirit
(Though I be absent in the flesh, etc. Now because there might yet remain some
scruple, and doubt in the minds of the Colossians, admitting his presence with
them in the spirit; for that might be without knowledge of their estate, as a
man may be with his friends far distant from him in conceit, in mind and good
will, and yet be ignorant of their estate and welfare, the Apostle therefore
in the second place sets down the effect of his presence in the spirit with
the Colossians, to prove that he was present with them, not in bare conceit and
mind, but so as he was acquainted with their state, as (namely) that it brought
forth joy and rejoicing, and that is further amplified by the means whereby
that rejoicing was wrought (namely) by sight, and not by hear say, rejoicing
and beholding, which does also prove the truth of his presence with them in the
spirit, that he was so present* that he did look on them, as if he had been
bodily present, and that his beholding of them, is further enlarged by the
matter and object of it, and that twofold, beholding their order and steadfast
faith in Christ, that he seeing their order and their steadfast faith in
Christ, rejoiced. Now before we come to handle the parts of this verse in
particular one thing of good use and consequence is to be observed from it in
general, we are to mark that this verse is inferd upon the former as a reason
of the Apostles ear, expressed in the former verse, he was careful that none
should beguile them, why so? because he was present with them in his spirit and
saw their good order and steadfast faith in Christ, that reason is to be marked,
a man would think he should rather have thus reasoned. I am with you in
spirit, and I see some go about to beguil you therefore I am careful that no
man beguil you, but he says not so, but I see your good order, therefore I am
careful that no man seduce you; from this manner of reasoning we may take out
this profitable lesson.

That in our best estate when we think our selves most When we think our
selves most free from danger of temptation, then are we to be vigilant and wary
and to watch over our own hearts and lives. Romans 11.20. 1. Cor. 10.12.
when we find our selus most strong by the strength of grace and faith to
withstand the assaults and temptations of Satan, or his in struments laboring
to beguile us, and to draw us to error in judgment, to lust of heart, or to any
sinful action, even then are we to be vigilant, circumspect and wary, and to
watch over our own hearts and lives, the Apostle was careful to keep the
Colossians from seducement, when he knew them well ordered and steadfast in
faith; So must we in our best and most secure estate, as it may seem to us,
fear and be careful to avoid the danger of temptation, the Apostle says to
such as stand by faith, be not high minded but fear, and let him that thinks
he stands, take heed least he fall, which places make nothing against
assurance of salvation in true believers as the Papists urge them, but are
admonitions to stir them up to use means of securing themselves, by warines,
and do prove the point in hand, that even the^ when we stand and are steadfast
in faith, we are with all circumspection, to avoid the danger of temptation,
if we call to mind the place where, and the time when our first parents were
deceived, we shall easily yield to the necessity of this duty, the place where
they were tempted, seduced and ouerthrown, was Paradise, the time when, in
their state of innocence. Now let no man upon this conclude, therefore sinful
men though they be true believers may wholly and finally fall from God, for
there is not the same reason of the grace and creation, Note.
and the grace of regeneration, by the grace of creation man, or Angel has a
power either to stand or fall, and this power is in it self but by the grace
of regeneration such fear of God is put into the hearts of the regenerate,
Ier. 32.40.
that they shall not wholly fall from God, and this power of not falling from
God is in them indeed but not from themselves (but that by the way) in that
our first parents were tempted and fell in Paradise in time of their innocence,
it makes it most clear (which is the intention of my speech) that in our best
estate, we are not to be secure and think our selves free (I say not from
temptation) but from the danger of temptation; and therefore in our best estate
when we have most strength of grace, we are to be vigilant and to watch over
our selves, least Satan circumuent us, we see our duty, and that it may be
thought upon with profit, we must know that when Satan cannot preuail with us
to make us commit gross sins, The duty urged by an argument from Sat^ns
subtilty in tempting us to sin.
drunkenness, pride in apparel or other like fruits of ignorance, and of an
unreformed soul, then he will assail us with some spiritual temptation, for
example, he will seek to poison our souls with inward pride, to make us (if
possibly he can) to swell, and to be lift up in regard of that very grace
given, to with stand temptation, we therefore (even as many as make conscience
of known sins) are to watch over our hearts in this respect, least Satan get
within our hearts, and by his subtilty crewe be aware corrupt them, with this
secret pride, and consider, that it is not enough for us to disallow this
corruption, as happily at the hearing of this exhortation, some will say; Oh,
God forbid I should so foget my self as to think highly of that strength God
has given me, and to be lift up wirh a conceit of that, I know it to be a
sin, and I utterly disallow it, consider I say, that this is not sufficient,
the Devil will suffer us to go thus far as in judgment we disallow it, so
in affection we must humble our selves in fear and prayer before the Lord,
knowing this, that at one time or other, we may be tempted and solicited by
Satan, to this sin of secret pride, and if in judgment only we disallow it,
and be not humbled in fear and prayer against it, we shall not be able to
stand in time of temptation, our Savior therefore has taught us, and he often
repeats it, that we are to watch and pray, that we fall not into temptation,
it is worth our marking that he says, Mark. 13.33. take heed or look, watch
and pray, for ye know not when the time is, as if he had said, it is not enough
for you to look about you, to espy this or that sin, but you are to watch
over yourselues in regard of temptation to it, yea, to be humbled in fear and
prayer, that you may be strengthened against it.

Come we to the particular parts of this verse, Interpretation.
and first of the prevention of the question, the Colossians might make in
these words, though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
by the word (flesh) we are to understand his body, as appears plainly, 1.
Cor. 5.3. and by the word (spirit) the mind and that not in substance, or any
essential faculty, but in act or operation of his mind, the apprehension or
vision of his mind, and that in truth, not in fantasy, his mind being
enabled by the Spirit of God, truly to see and behold the state of the
Colossians, thus then these words are to be conceived, though I be absent
from you in my body, yet am I present with you in the apprehension and vision
of my mind, enabled by the Spirit of God, truly to see and behold your state.

Many things might hence with profit be noted, but that A man's body and his
mind in respect of the apprehension and thought of it may be far disioyned
one from the other.
that a man's body and his mind, in regard of the apprehension, cogitation and
thought of it, may be far disioyned, the body may be in one placc and the
mind in another, the Apostle in his body was at Rome, in his mind with the
Colossians, our own experience teaches this, we can witness it, that our
bodies are sometimes in one place, when our minds are in another, if we desire
proof by plain text of Scripture Isa. 29.13. this people, says the Lord,
come near unto me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but have
removed their heart far from me, again, Ezekiel. 33.31. the Lord says, the
people come as they use to come, and sat before the Prophet, and heard his
words, but would not do them, for with their mouths they made jests, their
hearts were wandering after their covetousness, their minds were upon their
profits in the world.

When our minds are sent out of our bodies in the thoughts of them they are to
be well bestowed.
and are sometime far disioyned. We are therefore to take heed that our
minds when they are sent out of our bodies be well bestowed, that they do not
straggle and and wander out into filthy lusts and proud imaginations, to think
of new fashions, to bitter grudging, or into idle, vain and foolish conceits
it is accounted by many for a part of man's liberty, that thought is free, but
they that take that liberty, are brought into most grievous slavery, to become
slaves to their own wicked thoghts and vassals to the Devil: we must remember
to bestow our minds well, when they are sent out of our bodies, in the
cogitations of them, and especially in the actions of religion and divine
worship, as in hearing the word, in prayer, etc. in hearing the word, we are to
look that our thoughts be spent upon the word delivered. In prayer that our
minds be lift up to heaven, and wholly exercised in thinking on the goodness,
mercy, truth, might, power and majesty of the Lord to whom we pray, Eccles. 5.1.
so has our Savior taught us to say, Our Father which art in heaven, etc. and
it is Solomon's reason, that we should not be rash with our mouths, nor that our
hearts should be hasty to utter a thing before God, why? because God is in
heaven, and we are on the earth, therefore in prayer to lift up our hearts, and
to spend our thoughts wholly in thinking on the power, goodness, mercy, truth
and glorious Majesty of the Lord. Now in this duty many are much defective, and
many of us in time of prayer, rather think of any thing, then of the mighty
power and Majesty of him before whom we stand, we gaze here and there, we note
this man, that woman, their gesture, their apparel, yea, the least toy that is
about them, or else our minds are wandering after our pleasures or profits
abroad; our own hearts can tell us, that thus it it is with many of us, and
this being so, we must know it is just with the Lord to cast out our petitions,
and to return our prayers empty unto us again, yea, to send them back with a
curse instead of a blessing, they are abominable to the Lord, as himself has
said, incense is an abomination unto me, etc. why was incense an abomination to
the Lord, surely, because such as offered it, Isa. 1.13.
did not offer it with inward truth of a sound heart, so if our prayers be
offered to God, and our thoghts be carried clean away from him, they are
abominable to him, and the sacrifice of fools. Let us then labor in hearing
the word, in prayer and in other holy exercises, to set our selves in the
presence of God, to think upon his glorious Majesty, and remember withal God
house is his chamber of presence, wherein we offer and present our souls and
the secrers of our hearts to be seen and censured of the Lord,

Come we now to the effect of the Apostles presence with the Colossians,
whereby he proves that he was present with them in spirit (namely) his
rejoicing, the word rejoicing is here to be taken in the natural and proper
signification of it, that his heart was affected with joy and comfort, in
regard of the good order he saw among the Colossians, we are to consider this
effect together with the present state of the Apostle, he was then absent in
body from the Colossians, yea, his body was held from them in prison at Rome,
when he thus rejoiced for their good order, and steadfast faith, he was then in
his own body afflicted, when his heart was thus affected with joy for the good
of the Colossians, this considered; the point instruction arising from hence is
this.

That we are not to suffer our souls (as it were) to be are not to be kept
within compass of that we feel in, Our joy and our sorrow are not to be kept
within compass of that we feel in or upon our selves but our hearts are to
rejoice or to be grieved as occasion is offered from the Church of God.
or upon our selves, but our hearts are to be resolved, and further to break
out either in joy or sorrow, as occasion is offered from the Church, and
people of God, we are, after the example of the Apostle, even then when our
selves are afflicted, to joy and rejoice at the hearing or sight of Gods mercy,
and blessing upon his Church and people, and again, when our own estate is
prosperous, even then to sorrow and be grieved for the affliction and misery
of the Church and people of God; we see the first of these proved in the
example of the Apostle in this place, and again, 1 Thessalonians. 3.7.8.9. he says,
when he heard good tidings of the faith and love of the Thessalonians, that he
had consolation in all his affliction and necessity; that he was alive if they
stood fast in the Lord, that he could not render due thanks to God, for all the
joy wherewith he rejoiced for their sakes before God.

For proof of the second, that when we enjoy health and prosperity, we are to
sorrow and to be grieved for the affliction and trouble of the Church and
people of God, which we either see or hear of, excellent and memorable is the
example of Nehemiah chap. 1.4. though he for his own particular was in health,
and high place, much favored of the king yet when he hard of the affliction and
distress of Jerusalem, he says he sat down, and wept and mourned certain
days, and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, yea, he could not
smother or dissemble his grief, it appeared in his face insomuch as the king
perceived it, and demanded of him why his countenance was sad chap. 2.2. Add
to this that of Daniel, who though himself was in great honor and estimation,
preferred above all the princes of Persia, and second to the King, yet in the
midst of his prosperity, when he saw the captivity still continued, Gods
worship decayed, Gods people oppressed, his heart was heavy, his soul melted
within him, and he humbled his soul with fasting and prayer, and thus we see
it made clear unto us, by the the example of such as were guided by the spirit
of God, that our affections of joy and sorrow are to be tempered not only
according to the sense of good or evil upon our selves, but as occasion is
offered from the Church of God.

And the reason of this may be taken from that simpathy and fellow feeling one
member has of the suffering, Cor. 12.26. If one member suffer, all suffer with
it, if one member be had in honor, all the members rejoice with it. Now if
many members suffer, or rejoice with one, according to the state and condition
of it, then surely must one member suffer with many, though it self be
honored, and it must rejoice with many, though it self be afflicted: and this
does convince those of sin, whose hearts are either dilated, and lift up with
joy, or contracted and depressed with grief, as they feel, either good,
Reproof of such as either rejoice or are grieved as they feel either good or
evil on themselves, and never regard the prosperity or affliction of Gods
church.
or affliction of the Church of God: It is a true sign of a sanctified heart,
and of a heart that has fellowship with the Church and people of God, to
rejoice for the good of the Church when we our selves are afflicted, and to be
grieved for the affliction of the Church, when we have all things at will; yea
it is an infallible sign of our true love to Gods glory: if when our estate is
prosperous, we can grieve for the troubles of the Church, heard of, or seen;
but if our hearts be so taken up with the consideration of our own prosperity,
that sorrow for th'affliction of the Church cannot enter, and if we cannot
more sorrow in the sorrow of the Church, then rejoice in our own joy, we have
cause to fear that out hearts are not rightly affected to Gods glory: and to
descend to some particular, let us in this respect examine our own hearts, how
they stand affected in regard of the present dearth, and scarsity, now begun
amongst us: and further to be feared, happily many of us having better means
then others, are not hitherto pinched with it, only thus far that we live
at greater charge then heretofore we did, but we are not so nearly touched
with it as the poorer sort, who doubtless feel the smart of it. Now let us
examine whether we be any thing grieved beyond that we feel, or beyond that
we fear, to come upon our selves, whether we have in us Jobs affection, Job
30.25. whether we now weep with them that are already in trouble, whether our
souls be now in heaviness for the poor already pinched: come to the trial
and duly examine the matter, we shall find our selves far short of this
affection, do not we still continue our vanities, and superfluities, our great
excess in our feasting, wherein every one makes a feast like to that of Nabal,
1. Sam. 25.36. What shall I say, of that brutish sin of drunkenness, to
which some still cleave so fast, as nothing can remove them from delighting in
it, till the means whereby it is fostered be violently taken from them, as the
Lord threatens Joel 1.5- Awake ye drunkards, and weep and howl all ye
drinkers of Wine: because os the new Wine for it shall be pulled from your
mouth; do not these things witness against us, and make it most clear to the
world, and to our own souls that we are far from fellow feeling, and fellow
grieuing for the afflictions of our poor brethren? Nay, do they not make it
known that we are such as stand at defiance with the Lord; and that we dare
confront him and iustle with his judgments, and fear not to rush on that woe.
Isay 11.12. Well, let us in the fear of God be admonished to take heed of
this standing out with the Lord, do we provoke him to anger, and not bring
confusion upon our selves, let us remember that though we yet feel not the
smart of this famine, yet we are to be touched with grief and sorrow for the
distress of our poor brethren in this kind, and in testimony of our true
touch of heart, for them, to abridge our selves of that variety, that excess,
and superfluity in diet, we were wont to use, Note.
riot and excess in eating and drinking is a grievous sin at all times, but
now it is a crimson sin, a sin of a double die, because now the Lord does
call in special manner to moderation: mark how the Prophet sets out the sin
of the people of his time, by this very circumstance, Isay 22.12. In that day
when the Lord God of Hoasts did call unto weeping, and mourning, and to
baldness, and to girding with sackcloath, in that very d^y there was joy and
gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine,
so if we now give our selves to excessive eating and drinking, it is a far
greater sin then it is at other times.

It follows, (beholding your order) the Apostle was enabled by the spirit of
God in truth and not in fantasy, to behold the state of the Colossians.
Whence, first we

That the Apostle had the Spirit of God in extraordinary manner, even to let
him see the state of Churches far removed from him, yea he had the spirit of
discerning, to know the state of particular persons, and so might lawfully pray
against particular persons, Paul had Gods spirit in extraordinary manner and
could discern the state of particular persons, and might pray, against
particular persons.
as he did against Alexander the copper Smith, 2. Tim. 4.14. because he was
able to discern who were incurable enemies of God and who were not, and was
carried with a pure zeal to Gods glory, not mixed with hatred, Woe being both
ordinary men, and endued with ordinary gifts may not do as Paul did.
we may pray against the bad cause the wicked enemies of God maintain, simply,
and absolutely, but against their persons with this condition, if otherwise the
good estate of the Church cannot continue, or Religion be preserved.

We are furtherto mark, that the Apostle says, he beholding It is a great
comfo^t to the godly to see others well ordered and truly religious
Hence we may gather that it is a matter of great comfort to the godly minded,
to see others well ordered, and steadfast in the faith, fearing God. And
religious David says, He rejoiced when they said unto him they would go into
the house of the Lord, Psalm. 122.1. It did him good at the heart, to see others
forward in the service of God, and and their be many reasons why the godly
minded do rejoice to see others fearing God, and religious.







Such as cannot abide the^ that fear God but hate them and r^^roach them are
far from the minds and Spirit of Gods children. Psalm. 15.1.4.
and cannot abide them (as the fashion of some is in this wicked age) such as
spare not to break out and to load them with scornful, and opprobrious
terms, those are far of from the mind and spirit of Gods children; yea,
they show themselves to bear the image of wicked Kain who flew his brother,
and why? because says John, 1. Epistle 3.12. his own works were evil and
his brothers good; yea, they bear the express image of the Devil himself,
who no sooner saw the image of God imprinted in man, but he sought to deface
it, It is made a note of him that shall dwell in the Lords tabernacle and rest
in his holy mountain, that he honors them that fear the Lord: and on the
contrary, it must needs fall heavy on such as hate them, and repine at them,
that is a sign they shall never dwell in the Lords tabernacle, but shall be
cast out from his presence for ever, and this ought to stir us up to be glad
and rejoice, yea to take much delight in seeing others religious and fearing
God, and to honor them, and to make much of them, it is a sure sign that
grace is truly wrought in our own hearts, when we from the heart delight to see
the image of it in others; The particular things the Apostle saw with joy among
the Colossians are expressed in the last words, your order and steadfast faith
in Christ, by the word Order we are to understand the manner of government
Ecclesiastical, that was amongst the Colossians, Interpretation.
the good order they held and kept in the regiment of their Church, together
with the vigilance, care and diligence of all men in their several orders and
degrees amongst them, that all and every one was careful to do his duty in
his place, and calling, that I gather from the contrary expressed by the
Apostle, 2. Thessalonians 3.11. there are some which walk among you ((...))
inordinately, contrary to (...) or (...) good order, and the Apostle explanes
himself in the words following, they work not at all, they are negligent,
idle, and busy bodies, meddling in matters that concern them not, as the
Apostle says of idle hus-wiues, they go about from house to house, ye^ they
are not only idle, but also pratlers and busybodies, etc. 1. Timothy 5.13.
this then is the very meaning of the Apostle, that he in spirit saw the good
government of their Church, and the vigilancie care and diligence of every one
in his own place and calling.

First, let it be here observed, that the Apostle looking Church government
being seen to be d^fectiue ought to affect the godly minded with grief and
sorrow, but it is no sufficient cause of separation.
and Church government that was amongst the Colossians, and seeing that to be
good he rejoiced.

Hence we may gather by implication on the contrary. That the behoulding of bad
Church government, or of some defect in it, is to work in such as are godly
minded a grief, and sorrow of heart, a mourning for that want, for that there
is warrant, both by rule and example in the word of God, I might show it more
at large but for that very cause, because there be defects in the government
of the Church, to make separation from the church, I see no sufficient ground
for that, this is the case of the separatists at this day, Confutation of the
separatists of our time.
therefore rend themselves of, and make separation from us.

I know they allege that our Church is Antichristian, and therefore they
ought not to communicate with us, Edward the sixth, and many that then lived
afterward suffered in Queen Mary's time, and are accounted Martyrs by the
separatists themselves, now no member of an Antichristian Church can truly be
called a martyr, for a martyr is a witness to the truth, and therefore
doubtless our Church is a true Church of God, I could wish that this might be
duly considered by the separatists, and such as incline to separation.

Let it be further observed, that one particular thing seen by the Apostle
among the Colossians that gave him contentment, and that he saw with much
delight and Diligence and orderly walk ng in our particular calling is pleasing
to God, and to al good men.
that every man walked orderly and diligently in his place and call^ng.

Hence it is clear that diligence and orderly walking in a man's place and
calling, is a thing both pleasing to God (for it is agreeable to his
commandment) and a thing also pleasing and delightsome to good men, it does
minister unto them matter of joy and rejoicing, they delight to see it, we may
observe that David Psalm 122. rejoiced not only to see that God had
accomplished his promise, and placed his Arc in Sion, but that there was good
order in the city of Jerusalem, there was careful and conscionable execution
of Justice, and judgment, verse 5. there were thrones set for judgment, even
the thrones of the house of David, it did glad David's heart to see thrones of
justice erected, and judges and other officers carefully executing their office
and function, the reasons of it are these.

First good men, such as fear God, they know that God

A gain good men know that careful walking in a man's

Would we then by good means gain the good liking and approbation of good
men, If we would gain the good liking and approbation of good men we must walk
diligently and orderly in our seuer^ll callings.
which is a thing to be thought on, as the Apostle teaches, Philip. 4.8. a
good name is much to be sought after Pro. 22.1. and that indeed is a good name
when men hear well, for good things and of good men, it is no true honor to
be magnified of a multitude, and applauded of never so many wicked men would
we by good means have the good liking of good men, and do that which may
minister unto them matter of joy. Let us then look that we walk diligently,
and orderly in our several place^, and callings.

Ob.
Happily some will say this is a needless and unseasonable exhortation, we are
well ordered in this respect, we are such as walk painefully in our places and
callings, indeed it cannot be denied, but that some are diligent and painful

make known the greatness and danger of it, and to this purpose consider we
these three things.

Zenacherib that Sion despised him, and laughed him to scorn Isay 37.22. so it
is no light matter when the godly minded are justly grieved mark what the
Apostle says, 1. Pet. 4.14. if such as belong to Christ be railed on, that
railing reaches even to the spirit of glory that rests on them, so if men by
disorder grieve the godly minded, they grieve not them alone, but the spirit
that is in them, for they are not grieved, but as they are sanctified by the
spirit of God.

Again, such as run to these ungodly spectacles, are

Last of all let them remember what the wise man

If then we would not justly grieve the godly minded, and in them the spirit
of God, if we will not make our selves guilty of other men's sins, besides many
of our own, if we would not justly be stripped of all good understanding, and
so go on in a senseless security, to our utter destruction, let as many as
are guilty of this sin, repent and reform themselves, and let us all in the
fear of God, be admonished to keep our feet from running to such ungodly,
yea dangerous and damnable exercises.

Come we to the next thing which the Apostle saw among the Colossians (namely
their steadfast faith in Christ, the words are in the original, the
Solidnesse, or Steadfastness of your Faith.

Observe we here that the Apostle ioynes these two together, their good order,
and their soundnes of faith, though faith be first in nature, yet good order in
life is first seen, and by that did the Apostle gather the soundness of their
faith; hence we may conclude.

Sound faith and well ordered life ever go together.
howsoever good order, and holiness of life, be not (as the Papists teach) the
form of faith, nor concurring as a cause in the act of justification in Gods
sight, yet is there a necessary concurrence, and conjunction of faith, and good
life in the person justified, the Apostle says, Gal. 5.6. true faith is ever
fruitful, and working by duties of love in a man's place and calling, indeed,
holiness of life may be disioyned from popish (catholic) faith, that being
but a bare assent to the history of the gospel, such as is in devils who
believe and tremble, but sound and solid faith in Christ for remission of
sins, and all other blessings, temporal and eternal, cannot choose but show
it self in duties of love, and many good fruits worthy amendment of life.

It is a deceit of the flesh to think that true faith and disordered life may
meet together.
to think that true faith, and disordered life may meet together in one and
the same subject; to think (as the most do) that though they be swaggerers,
swearers, etc. yet they have true faith in Christ; but can true faith in Christ
for remission of sins, and many sins dwell together? it is not possible, they
that so think, never felt the power of Gods grace and mercy in Christ, and I
dare be bold to tell them, they are yet in their sins, whose hearts are
possessed with such deceauing thoughts, and know it for a truth, we find it
in the word of truth, 2. Peter. 1.9. he that does not join to his faith,
virtue, and with virtue, knowledge: etc. is blind and cannot see far off, and
has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins, he does not remember,
nor think on the power of the blood of Christ, that that is able to wash away
the guilt and punishment of his sins and to purge out the corruption of
sin, he that is not purged from the corruption of sin is not washed from
the guiltiness of sin.

We are further to mark that the Apostle says not barely (beholding your
faith) but with this addition (your steadfast) or as indeed the words are (the
solidnes, soundnes and firmament of your faith.) Hence we may take up this
conclusion.

That true faith in Christ is no windy vanity; no empty, True faith in Christ
is no windy vanity nor empty show but has a true sound and solid being.
it is as a solid body, without rottennes, or concauity, without hollownes, or
deceit, Hebr. 11.1. it is said to be the (...) (that is) the substance or
ground of things hoped for, Heb. 3.14. the beginning or foundation wherewith we
are vpholden, Hab. 2.4. this point is made most clear, by the opposition there
made by the Prophet between the faith of the just, and the infidelity of the
unjust, the unbelief of the unjust is compared to a swelling bubble, for the
words are, he that swells as a bubble, or the unjust that lifts up
himself as a bubble, so as he seems as a mighty mountain, and yet is but as
a windy bladder or bubble, his mind is not sound or upright in him, but the
just shall live by his faith, his faith being no vain nor empty thing shall
uphold him, and minister patience, and true comfort unto him, which is a
pregnant proof of this, that true faith is no empty show, but a sound and
solid thing.

The reason of this is plain, Note.
the show and seeming face of virtue and grace, but not the substance and
truth of any grace, if grace be truly wrought in any, it is sound and solid.







to mark a diffetence between hollow hypocritical faith and a weak faith,
these two are not both one, a weak faith, a faith much lessened in the measure
by diff^dence and doubtings may be formal, that a sound and solid faith, Note.
it being (as ye have heard) then solid, when there is, though weak, yet a true
knowledge, and apprehension, and application of Christ, and of his benefits,
and thus we see it made clear, that wheresoever true faith is truly wrought,
it has a sound and solid being, the things essential to faith as knowledge,
apprehension, and application, they meet close together in such a faith.

This does first discover unto us that popish justifying Discovery of Popish
justifying faith to be no sound and solid faith
the Papists make it known in their doctrine and writings, that they
disclaim, and renounce particular apprehension and application of Christ, and
of his benefits, they publish it to the world that they hold that to be but an
impudent fiction, and what is this, but to let the world see the unsoundness,
and disioynted looseness of their faith, and their faith is no better then a
loose knowledge, or at the most, a bare assent to the truth of the articles of
our faith, which may be in very reprobates, yea in the Devils themselves; true
faith (as I have proved) is absolutely sound and solid, having knowledge,
apprehension, and application concurring and meeting close together. Now they
disioyn these, one from the other, yea they cry shame upon particular
application of Christ, and of his benefits, and therefore there is no
soundness nor saving substance in popish justifying faith.

Again the doctrine delivered makes known unto us, Discovery of the faith of
many in our Church is no true faith.
because the faith of many wants that solid soundness that ought to be in
true justifying faith, for why? may that in any wise be called true faith that
comes far short of the faith of very Devils, who believe and tremble?
without question it may not, and are there not many amongst us, who neither
know that which the Devil believes, nor yet through the hardness of their
hearts, can tremble at the judgments of God, as he can, but (to hold us to the
point) do not the greatest number amongst us rest in their bare knowledge of
Christ and never join unto that knowledge any true apprehension, and true
application of Christ, and of his benefits to themselves? I know we are prone
to think well of our selves, our own corrupt hearts will flatter us, and tell
us that we join to our knowledge true apprehension and application of Christ,
and of his benefits, and therefore have a sound and solid faith, but let us
join issue and come to the trial.

Two things discover whether we join to our knowledge of Christ and his
benefit true apprehension and application of them or no.
There be two special things by which we may truly know whether we join to
our knowledge of Christ, and of his benefits true apprehension, and application
of them or no.

The first is the proper fruits ever following a justifying faith; I say the
proper fruits following it not such as may be common to it with nature, as
civil life, just dealing, and the like, which may be in natural men and
unbelievers, but the proper fruits of it, as an inward love

Ephesians 6.16. as a breast plate, 1. Thessal. 5.8, yea as Saint John says
excellently well, 1. John 5.4. The victory that overcomes the world, it being
a notable instrument of the holy ghost, by which we withstand the lusts of the
flesh, the corruption of the world, and the temptations of Satan, and overcome
them, or if we be overcome by any temptation, yet it is (by reason of our
faith) with much striving and reluctation, even against our best pleasing
sin, by these two things we may try whether we join to the knowledge of
Christ, and of his benefits true apprehension, and application of them, or no,
and if many of us by these things duly examine our selves, without partial
affection to our selves, we shall find that we are far short of a sound and
solid faith, where is that man or that woman, who has true inward love to God
in his word of promise, and does truly fear God in his word of threatening,
and has his heart and life subject to the will of God revealed, and does
continually lift up his heart in prayer, and thanksgiving to God? and where is
that man or woman that feels the power of faith in time of temptation
effectual to withstand sin, yea to strive against the best pleasing sin,
and to carry the heart against that sin, which his heart naturally loves,
likes, and much affects? nay who is it almost, that is not carried with the
full swinge of his own heart, and with much pleasure to the committing of his
best beloved sin? it may be there is in a man sometimes a conflict between
his conscience and affection, which indeed may be in natural, and wicked men,
but where is he whose heart is carried against the natural inclination of it?
for that is a fruit of grace, I leave it to our own examination, and this my
speech to the blessing of God, and further to be thought on by our selves, and
that we may be moved to join to our knowledge of Christ, and of his
benefits, not an hollow but a true apprehension and application of them, which
ever receives strength from Christ, both to accomplish good, and to resist
evil; let us remember that nothing but a sound and solid faith shall stand us
in steed, at the hour of death, or at the great day of the Lord, let a man's
outward and civil carriage be never so excellent, yea if he could match the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, which for outward show was without
any exception, yet if he have not a righteousness exceeding that, even the
righteousness of a sound and solid faith, he can never be saved Mat. 5.20.

The next thing we are to mark from the words of the Apostle is, that he sets
out the solidnesse of the faith of the Colossians, together with the object of
it, (namely) Christ (your steadfast faith in Christ) which phrase cannot with
any likelihood at all, be taken, for giving credit to the things spoken by, or
of Christ, but for justifying faith.

Hence I will but call to mind a point I have heretofore handled, it is
worthy often to be remembered (namely) this.

True justifying faith is bounded and set on Christ Jesus only.
he is the proper object of it, howsoever Faith in a general sense and
reference respects the whole word of God, yet as it is an instrument of
justification, it beholds the special mercy of God in Jesus Christ, and does
apprehend and apply Christ and his merits.

Hence it is called the Faith of Jesus, Romans 3.26. Faith as a virtue or for
the dignity either of it self or of any action of it does not justify.
faith does not justify any thing at all as it is a grace wrought in the
heart, or for the dignity and worthiness, either of it self, or any other
action of it, but only by relation to Jesus Christ, because it takes steadfast
hold of Christ, and does truly apprehend and apply his perfect righteousness
and merits.

The Church of Rome acknowledges faith to justify, but how? forsooth as an
excellent virtue bringing forth many gracious motions in the heart, as a fear
of hell a love of God, a consideration and desire of life eternal, and so
making worthy ex congruo (as they speak) to receive grace and justification,
which is a doctrine devilish and dangerous, and flat contrary to the truth of
the word of God, Romans 3.27.28. the Apostle opposes believing, and working,
faith, and works, therefore faith as a work or virtue does not justify, for
then the Apostles opposition were overthrown, then believing and working might
stand together, which are made opposite in the act of justification in Gods
sight.

Again, this is to be marked of us, that faith does justify Against the
rebelling pride of our nature.
it is the pride of our corrupt nature, to look for justification, and
salvation by something in our selves, if men live orderly in civil fashion,
hurt none and do good to many, then they think, they cannot choose but go to
Heaven, thus does the Devil teach them to go beyond the doctrine of the holy
Ghost; he has taught that good life and conversation serves as an evidence,
and necessary proof of faith in the blood of Christ, by whom we are
justified, and the Devil he teaches to advance it higher, even to shoulder
out Gods grace, and the merits of Christ in our justification, we must
remember what the Apostle has taught us, Gal. 5.4. if we look to be
justified by any thing in our selves, we are abolished from Christ, we must
therefore in the case of justification, cast from us all confidence in any
thing, that is in our selves be it faith, or whatsoever it is, judge our
selves, condemn our selves, in regard of any thing in us, and plead nothing
but mercy and forgiveness, we must go out of our selves, and fix our faith
upon Jesus Christ, and be persuaded in our hearts, that his death is our
ransom, his righteousness, our righteousness, make him our perfect Savior
and Redeemer, and build upon him as a rock that never can be shaken.

VER. 6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him.
etc.
This verse, together with the seventh, as they have reference to the general
proposition laid down verse 3. that in Christ all things needful to
salvation are to be found, they contain an exhortation to cleave to Christ,
as the only way to life, the only root and foundation of all true happiness
and comfort, therefore the Apostle says, walk in him, rooted and built in
him, and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught, etc. but as this 6.
verse has more near connection with the verse immediately going before, it is
inferred upon it, as an exhortation to the Colossians, to go on in Christ as
they had begun, both in faith and in good life, expressed in the words (walk
in him) together with the manner how they were to walk in him (namely) as they
had received Christ Jesus, who is further set out by his title (Lord) and that
with an emphasis with addition of the article ((...)) the Lord, or that Lord.

Interpretation.
Let us come to examine the words of this verse (as ye have received Christ)
(that is) as ye have believed in Christ, for the Apostle having spoken of the
sound faith of the Colossians in the verse before, he infers upon it, as ye
have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, and these two
being thus conjoined by the Apostle, we cannot but understand by receiving
Christ, believing in him. 1. Cor. 15.12. we find the taken promiscually, in
co^^^^, as having both one sense and signification, in the first verse it is
said, the Gospel which ye have received and verse the 2. except ye have
believed in vain, the Apostle makes them of equal sense and signification
(the Lord) (that is) the only true Lord, and perfect Savior, by way of
distinction, to put difference between the true Christ preached by the
Apostle, and a false counterfeit Christ taught by false teache^s, (so walk)
(that is) so live, it is a known phrase of Scripture to put walking for
living, but with this addition (in him) it implies thus much, that they should
go on in their faith in Christ, and lead their lives by faith in him, and by
the motion of his spirit according to his will, for that is to walk in Christ,
as to walk in the law and commandments of God, is to frame the life according
to the preseription of his law and commandments; thus then these words are to
be conceived, as if the Apostle had said.

As ye have therefore believed in Christ Jesus, that only true Lord and
perfect Savior, so go on in your faith, and live by your faith in him, by the
motion of his spirit according to his will. Now from this ver. in general, in
that the Apostle does exhort the Colossians to go on in faith as they had
begun, is offered to our consideration this general conclusion.

That as we have begun in any grace, be it faith, the fear As we have begun
in any grace so are we to go on in the same.
so are we to go on in the same as we grow in years, so are we to grow in
grace, the Psalmist says of such as be planted in the Lords house, they still
bring forth fruit in their age Psalm. 29.14. and there is reason for it.

Because where grace is truly wrought,

The one holds out and increases, and the other is temporary, and vanishing
as the morning dew, as the Prophet speaks, Hos. 6.4.

The holy Ghost does often urge this upon us, that we are to grow in grace,
teaching therehy the necessity of this duty, therefore let no man think much to
hear of it often, for I do but now remember unto you that which heretofore I
have handled at large, and the rather I recall it to mind, because many are
much wanting in this duty, as men grow in years, Reproof of such as grow not
^n grace as they grow in years.
who are more ignorant of the things of God, then commonly some of great
years? who are more covetous then they? who are more auerse and backward to
every good duty, and every good action? it is needful then we should after be
put in mind of this, that as we grow in years so we are to grow in grace,
therefore to add something to that which heertofore has been said to this
purpose, let us first remember what Solomon says, Prou. 16.31. age is a crown
of glory, when it is found in the way of righteousness, not when it is
begun, but when it is continued in that way, then it is honorable; what is
it then, found in the way of sin? surely, far from honorable, it is then
base and contemptible, aged persons found ignorant and sinful, forfeit and
lose the reverence and respect that should be given them amongst men.

Again, let it be thought on, that it is a forfeiture and loss of Gods
favor, when aged persons are found in the way of sin, what they have been
in times past it skils not, if they have been forward in the fear of God
heretofore, and now are wholly fallen away, and with Demas embrace this
present world, if they have wholly lost their first love, 2. Tim. 4.10. Coloss.
4.14.
zeal, etc, the Lord will take them as he finds them, Mat. 24.46. that
servant is blessed whom his master at his coming shall find doing his duty,
but as it follows ver. 48. if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my
master does defer his coming, his master will take him as he finds him, all
the righteousness men have done, shall not be remembered, if the Lord find
them doing wickedly, as appears plainly, Ezekiel. 18.24. and indeed it shall
stand up in judgment against them: if then we would not lose the honor that
of right is due from men to old age, if we would not forfeit the favor of God,
and being found by him in the way of sin, increase the weight of our judgment,
let us labor to grow in grace as we grow in years, and as we go before
others in age, so let us exceed them in the graces of Gods spirit.

The next thing we are to mark, is the inference of this verse upon the
former, it depending on the former, as a conclusion, and exhortation grounded
upon it, the Apostle says, he saw in his Spirit the steadfast faith of the
Colossians, and upon that does infer this exhortation, therefore as you have
received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him.

First he shows they were sound in faith, and then does wish and exhort them
to go on as they had begun.

Hence we may gather.

That proceeding and going on in religion must be Proceeding and going on in
religious must be upon a good ground.
men are not generally to proceed in religion as they have begun how soever,
but having begun well and in the truth, then they are to go on.

For why? there may be a beginning in error, Note.
and to go on in error being convinced by evidence of the truth is obstinacy,
and if the error be in the foundation of religion, it is heresy, and to go on,
yea, to run with speed out of the way, it were better to turn back, even
zeal it self, earnest love of religion, and of such as are religious, it must
be bounded and kept within a right compass, it must be squared by the rule of
the Apostle Gal. 4.18. it is a good thing to love earnestly always in a good
thing etc. this being so, the Papists have no reason to open their mouths, Our
separation from the Papists justified.
because we walk not in that religion our forefathers received of them, and
because we hold not communion with them in their idolatry and superstition for
that were to go on in a wrong way, I know they brand us with the mark of
Heretics, in forsaking (as they say) the Catholic society, but they are
easily answered, that we have separated our selves not from the Catholic
Church of Christ, but from the malignant Antichristian synagogue of Rome, and
have gone out of Babylon, as the holy Ghost has commanded Revel. 18.4 that we
should not communicate with her in her sins, and so be partakers of her
plagues.

Ob.
But (say they) do you think all that communicate with the Church of Rome,
being (as you say) Babylon, are liable to the plagues of Babylon? what say you
then to your own forefathers who lived and died in the time of popery? will yet
say they were all cast away and condemned? see the cunning of these men to
bleare the eyes of the world, and at this do many weak and simple Christians
stumble.

Melchisedecke, Naaman the Assyrian, Cornelius and others, having (for any
thing we know) small or no means of true knowledge, yet by the working Spirit
of a gracious God, were mercifully pulled out of ignorance, and worshipped the
true God, therefore we are comfortably to hope of our forefathers living in
time of ignorance that they found mercy with the Lord, and to this purpose we
have an excellent place, Revel. 9.4. where it is said, it was commanded to the
Locusts rising out of the smoke of the pit, that they should not hurt the
grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree: but only those
men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. A sweet testimony of
the power and mercy of our most gracious God, who can, and no doubt did, even
when Antichrist was at his height, and in the midst of his Romish Locusts,
preserve his chosen from hurt by the^, to their destruction. We see then how we
may with comfort answer the cauilling question of the popish sort touching the
state of our forefathers, we see also our separation from their heretiall
synagogue justified.

Here again we are to mark the phrase of the Apostle, he says not, as ye
have believed, but as as ye have received, thus he sets out the nature of ^^ge
faith.

That true faith it a receiving of Christ with all his benefits, True faith is
a receiving of Christ with all his benefits.
and this is confirmed by that Ioh. 1.12. As many as received him, to them he
gave power to be the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name,
where we see believing and receiving Christ are made both one; and this is a
matter of great comfort to all that truly believe in Christ, Comfort to all
that truly believe in Christ.
they by faith do really receive Christ, Use.
they do it not (as the Papists cavil) in mere imagination, but really they
receive him, and so stand truly and really just in Gods sight by Christ his
righteousness, being imputed unto them, and received by them, now this comfort
the Papists labor to wrest from us, and against it they reason thus.

If a beeleeuer be truly and really just by Christ his righteousness imputed
and received,

I answer, debt of Gods chosen, and so become truly a debtour for them.

Again it is no blasphemy to say that Christ having out sins on him, was in
that respect to God for us, as every one of us is in himself to God, they are
the words of the Apostle Gal. 3.13, that he became a curse for us etc. and so
redeemed us from the curse of the Law, therefore let not the Papists think to
wring this ground of comfort from us, that Christ willingly undertaking to
satisfy for our sins, became truly a sinner, by our sins laid upon him;
and we again became truly righteous by his righteousness received by true
faith, the comfort of this will never fail us.

The next thing we are to mark in this verse is, that the Apostle says, the
Colossians received Christ Jesus (the Lord) adding these words (the Lord) by
way of distinction, to put a difference between the true and false Christ, for
false teachers preached Christ Jesus, only as the son of David, and joined
Moses unto him, and made a mixture of the Law and the Gospel, and urged
circumcision as necessary to salvation, but the true Apostle taught Christ
Jesus as the only true Lord and Savior, and so the Colossians received him,
hence I gather.

Christ must be taught and received as the only Lord of life and as a perfect
Savior
or else he is not taught, nor received, as he ought to be, we find Act.
3.14.15. Saint Peter in his sermon gives him these titles, the holy one, and
the just, the Lord of life whom God has raised from the dead etc. and that
justly, he being properly, and by nature holy and just, and making all his
members so, and he being the author and giver of life and glory, and so is he
to be taught and so to be received; Saint Jude in his Epistle verse the 4.
says that certain intruding deceivers did deny Christ Jesus, and mark how
he describes him, that only ruler who is God and our Lord Jesus Christ, for
so the words are to be read.

Now this I note to let us see that the Papists are in this regard blame
worthy, Confutation of the Papists.
yet not a perfect Savior in himself by merit, but a Savior in us, and
indeed only an instrument of Salvation, giving us grace to merit, our own
Salvation, for they teach that through his merits, God does pour into every
true Christian a particular justice or righteousness, whereby he is sanctified
and made able to do good works, and to merit eternal life; they be their
own words; and so they derogate and detract much from the glory of Christ, yet
they are not or at the least seem not so persuaded, they would make the world
believe they honor Christ, much more by their doctrine then we do by ours,
though we teach that Christ is a perfect Savior in himself, in regard of
merit, and that only our faith does apprehend and apply his perfect
righteousness and merit, they plead thus for themselves.

Say they, of the Papists, thus to plead for defense of their doctrine and we
are to renounce it, as much derogating and detracting from the glory of our
only Lord and perfect Savior Christ Jesus.

Come we to the last words of this verse (so walk in him) In that the Apostle
does testify of the Colossians in the verse before, that they had steadfast
faith in Christ, and in this verse, that they had received and truly believed
Christ and upon this does exhort them to walk on by their faith we are taught.

True believers must not only believe in Christ but must also live in Christ by
faith and by the motive of the Spirit.
and his benefits, for remission of his sins, and to his justification, but
his whole life must be a walking and going on in that faith; a true Christian
must not only believe in Christ, but he must also live in Christ by faith, and
by the motion of his Spirit, we have this further proved unto us by the
example of our Apostle Gal. 2.20. he says, that Christ lived in him (that is)
by his spirit and in that, that he lived in the flesh, he lived by faith in
the son of God, Gal. 3.11. he makes it general citing the words of the
Prophet, that the just shall live by faith, and Romans the 8.1. he says, such
as are in Christ, walk not after the flesh but after the spirit, and indeed
as many as believe in Christ to their justification, must also live in him by
faith, and find him powerful in them by Spirit, to their sanctification.

The point no doubt is clear, for the truth of it; yet happily some may desire
to be more particularly informed touching this duty, How we are to live by
faith in Christ in our general calling as Christians, and in our particular
places and callings.
and may demand how they are to live by their faith in Christ, the general
being not so easy to be understood; know therefore for our better and more
special instruction in this point, that our faith in Christ, must show it
self powerful, not only in our justification in the sight of God, and in our
inward renouation, faith purifying the heart Act. 15.9. which things are not so
sensible and easy to be discerned, but we are to walk by our faith in
Christ, our faith is to be working in our outward actions both of religion,
and general calling, as we are Christians, and in the outward actions of our
particular places and callings.

How is that may some say?

I answer,

Again, our faith is to show it self powerful in our outward crosses and
afflictions that befall us in our bodies or goods, How faith must be powerful
in our outward crosses and afflictions.
we are then by faith to rely upon that promise of God, 1. Cor. 10.12. that
the Lord will either give strength to bear them, or deliverance out of them,
and though temporary things fail us, yet we are by faith to retain hope of
mercy and of life eternal, and to wait on the good pleasure of the Lord for
our deliverance, the Prophet says; Isa. 28.16. he that believes shall not
make haste; thus we see in some part how we are to live by our faith in Christ,
in regard of our outward actions, both of religion and of our particular
callings, and in the outward afflictions of this life.

And these things I rather insist in, Reprofe of them who live not by faith in
Christ
that hereby we may try our selves whether we walk in Christ, and live by
faith in him or no, and if by these things we try our selves, we shall find
that many of us come short of this duty, for why? do not most amongst us spend
their days in the cares of this world? they care not only to do the works
of thelr callings, which is commendable, but they care for the issue of their
labors, which belongs only to God, and these cares, so take up their hearts,
that no good thing can enter into the^, and do not many seem to trust in God so
long as it pleases him to vouchsafe unto the^ the means of life, and
maintenance but if these be taken away then they are confounded in themselves,
as if there were no God to care for them; is this a life of faith? no, no, this
is to live by sense, like bruit beasts, this is not to trust God upon his word
and promise, but upon his pawn, like the distrustful usurer, who will not
trust a man without some specialty, or some pawn, so if the Lord please to lay
down his pawn as money, goods, lands etc. and leave them in our hands, we
trust him; but if these be taken from us, we doubt of his providence and
goodness, and break out into distemperd speeches, yea, some are so
distrustful of the providence of God, that they think when they have plenty of
outward things, if they should be somewhat liberal toward good uses, then
they and theirs might happily be brought to want, see how cunning our own
corruption is to deceive us, what is this but to prove against our selves,
that we are not the children of God, for we know wicked men are tender over
their own children, even bears and lions provide for their young, shall then
the God of all goodness wlthdraw his hand from helping his sons and
daughters, and making supply with interest of that they give to a good use, it
is not possible, let us then be better advised; and that we may be stird up to
this duty now delivered, know we this for a truth, if our faith be not in
some measure powerful in all actions and passions of our lives we yet believe
not in Christ to our justification, but we are yet in our sins, and our case
as yet is damnable for without question, as many as have received Christ Jesus
by faith to their justification, cannot but feel the power of that faith to
their renouation, and in the whole course of their lives; let them as many as
hold themselves interessed in the blood of Jesus Christ, labor to feel the
power of their faith in such things as they may best judge of it, as in the
outward actions of religion, and of their particular places and callings and in
the outward afflictions that befall the^.

When all things in this world, friends and means, yea, health and strength
fail us, yet let us then by faith rest on the promise of God, and certainly
hope for mercy and life eternal, that so we may live by faith, and may also
die by faith, and both in life and death find comfort in this, that we are
truly justified, and within the compass of Gods special love aod favor in
Jesus Christ.

VER. 7. Rooted and built in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been
taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
This verse contains an amplification of the manner how the Colossians were to
walk in Christ (namely) not only as they had received him, but in respect of
themselves that they should go on in him with constancy, and with a settled
course, expressed first in those metaphoricell terms (rooted and built in him)
and then more plainly, (stablished in the faith) and the Apostle having made
mention of faith which is a word comprehending many sorts under it, subioynes
an explication of it, what faith he meant, (namely) that faith of Christ, which
they had been truly taught, (as ye have been taught.)

And again, that they should be so far from being deficient and failing in
the fruits of that faith that they should on the contrary, abound in them, and
that with alacrity and cheerfulness of mind, set out by the effect of it,
(namely) thanksgiving (abounding therein with thanksgiving) Thus we have the
connection of this ver. with the former, and the general matter contained in
it; come we to the word of it, and first of the words, Interpretation.
Rooted and built in him. These words are metaphorical and borrowed one from
trees and plants, that as trees and plants not only grow upon their roots, but
are strong and able to endure the force of winds and weather, according as
they are rooted, so the Apostle would have the Colossians, and all true
believers, being engrafted into Christ by says, and growing up as branches
from him, as a root that cannot be loosened to be constant and strong in their
faith. The second metaphor is taken from houses and buildings, and in substance
does signify as much as the first, that as houses set upon a strong
foundation, are firm, and stand without falling in the greatest violence of
wind or water, so the Apostle would have true believers being built on Christ
the foundation of his Church: or rather in Christ as the Apostle says here,
and Ephesians. 2. the last ver. (to put a difference between earthly and
spiritual buildings) a foundation that never can be shaken, to be firm and
steadfast in Christ and the meaning of the Apostle is this.

That they should walk and grow strongly and formely in Christ, so as no
temptation or affliction should be able to remove them from him; even as trees
well and deeply rooted, and as houses set upon sure, firm and immooueable
foundations, which neither wind nor weather can ouerturne and throw down. Now
here passing by that doctrine of constancy in faith of which I shall have more
fit occasion to speak when I come to handle the next words, the first thing
we are to mark is, that the Apostle was not content to exhort the Colossians
to walk on in Christ, but he adds further rooted and built in him, that they
should walk in Christ, as those that are rooted and built in him, hence the
Apostle by implication does

That some men seem to walk in Christ, and yet indeed are not rooted and
built in him, Some seem to walk in Christ and yet are not rooted and built in
him.
mistake me not, I say not that some do truly walk in Christ, and yet are
not rooted and built in him, for certainly as many as truly walk and live by
their faith in Christ, are rooted and built in him, but I say some seem to
walk in Christ, and yet they are not rooted and built in him, thus much the
continuance of the Apostles exhortation in these words does imply, he adding to
his exhortation (walk in Christ) rooted and built in him, does thereby intend
the good of the Colossians, that they should walk in Christ, as those that
were rooted and built in him, and withal does intimate unto us, that men may
seem to walk in Christ, and yet not be rooted and built in him, nor be able
to stand without falling in time of trial, when they shall be tried either by
cunning deceuers, or open and violent persecutors, some seem to walk in
Christ, and yet they are not able to stand in time of such trial, and this is
further proved unto us by the second sort of hearers in the Parable, Mat.
13.20.21
some hear the word, and incontinently receive it with joy, and yet have no
root in themselves, and dure but a season, for as soon as tribulation or
persecution comes, because of the word, by and by they are offended, yea,
temporary believers there spoken of, not only know the word, assent to the
truth of it, profess it and rejoice in in it, yea, in the saving promise
without effectual application, but being pricked forward with desire of
praise, profit or some other sinister respect, bring forth some kind of seeming
fruits, yet says our Savior they have no root in themselves, and dure but a
season, they are like corn growing on the house top, and as soon as
tribulation or persecution comes,

This being so, it concerns as many as persuade our selves that we walk in
Christ, and live by faith in him, to look that our faith be not a temporary
faith, but such a faith as is well rooted and built in Christ, and such as will
stand strong and steadfast in time of trial. Such as persuade themselves they
live by faith in Christ must look that their faith be so rooted and built in
Christ as in time of trial it will not fail them.


Some may say, how shall we know that, how shall we now (before trial and
trouble come upon us) know that our faith is so rooted and built in Christ,
that in time of trial it will stand fast and not fail us.

I answer, Note.
or Papisme, if they should call themselves to account, they should find that
they were never able by the strength of faith to overcome some known sin, as of
pride, of self conceit, or the like, and so by the just judgment of God have
bin left to themselves, and being so left, have fallen, and made it manifest,
and clear to the world, that though they seemed to walk in Christ, and happily
with great forwardnes, yet (indeed) their faith was never rooted and built in
him, if then we would be assured that our faith is so rooted in Christ, that in
time of trial, either by seducement, or open persecution, it will not fail
us, let us before such trial, labor to find and feel our faith strong to
withstand temptation to known sins, if we find our faith steadfast, and able to
stand against the assaults of Satan in time of prosperity, then doubtless we
shall find it strong and never failing in time of trial by outward trouble or
any adversity whatsoever.

The next thing we are to observe from these words is that Christ is compared
to a root and a foundation in respect of his members, in that the Apostle
says, they must be rooted and built in him, hence we may conclude.

That Christ gives both sap and safety to all his members, Christ gives both
sap and safety to al his members.
there is no danger of any hurt to them that grow by faith in Jesus Christ, the
root of the tallest cedar, or strongest oak cannot defend the branches, or the
body from hurt, the wind may break off the branches, the axe may cut down the
body without resistance; but Christ the root of al his members, being
all-sufficient, and omnipotent does minister unto them as much safety, as sap,
so that no storm nor tempest, no force nor weapon, can separate the least of
his members from him, nor any way hurt them.

Consider we the reasons of it,

First, Christ does remove from his members that which

Again, as many as have Christ for their root, have

Some may say, none are more subject to miseries, Ob.
troubles, and dangers, then they that be the members of Christ, daily
experience shows it.

Though they be so, troubles that befall them are testimonies of Gods love;
and not of his anger; would we then have our hearts at liberty, free from dread
of all hurt that may befall us, especially in the time of some common calamity.

We must draw our safety from the same root from whence we derive our
salvation.
even from the Lord Jesus our Savior, from our being in him and growing in
him, and our communion with him, without this, all the means in the world will
not secure us from hurt, and deliver us from plagues, and judgments, no; Gods
own hand will not comfort us without respect had to this, that we are members
of Christ, such as be out of Christ, and unbelievers, have the wrath of God,
his threatenings, his oath, and his hand against them, and what hand or strength
can defend them, on the contrary, true believers are so free from danger of any
hurt, that though Satan, and his instruments, would yet they can do nothing,
that may hurt them, yea I may be bold to say (if I be rightly understood) that
God himself can do nothing to their hurt, because he will not, and so
understand my speech of his actual power, for his will and actual power, are
of equal extent, the one goes not further then the other, and so I say God
himself can do nothing that may hurt them; which is a great comfort to all
true believers; let us therefore labor to draw safely from the same root from
whence we derive our salvation, even from Jesus Christ our Savior, by being
ingrafted into him, and rooted in him by faith, and then we shall be safe, and
free from danger of hurt, in the greatest calamities that can be sent amongst
us.

Observe we further that the Apostle says, (rooted in Christ, and built in
him) and not on Christ, which is a phrase not usual in building, giving us to
understand that true believers are as Peter calls them, 1. Peter 2.5. living
stones, living and growing in the foundation: hence I gather.

That all the members of Christ are fruitful branches, and as living stones
receiving life; and grace from Christ, their The true members of Christ are
fruitful branches, and as living stones receive grace and life from him.
and therefore it is false which the Papists affirm, that hypocrites and ill
livers may be members of Christ, wicked men may be members of the visible
Church for a time, and of Christ sacramentally, but not indeed, as many as are
indeed, and truth, members of Christ receive sap from him, and bring forth
fruits answerable to such a root.

Come we to those words wherein the Apostle does plainly express the
meaning of his continued exhortation that the Colossians should go on in faith,
Hypocrites and ill livers cannot be true members of Christ.
with constancy as they had begun, having set it down in words
metaphorical, whereof we have spoken, he further propounds it in these plain
terms stablished in the faith, together with an explanation what faith he
means (namely) that faith which they had been taught, as ye have been
taught) the word (stablished) is not here metaphorical, as in cap. 1.13. in
the original we find two different words, Interpretation.
the word here is to be taken in the proper signification of it, and is as
much as if the Apostle had said, confirmed in the faith, so it is translated 1.
Cor. 1.6. as the testimony of Jesus Christ has been confirmed in you, the
Apostles meaning then is briefly this, confirmed in the faith of Christ, or of
the Gospel, all is one in substance, as ye have been truly taught by the true
teachers of the Gospel.

The first thing that is offered from these words to be considered, is the
constancy and stability of faith, in that the Apostle truly* says (stablished
in the Faith) the point is this.

That we are to be settled and confirmed in our knowledge, and faith of the
Gospel, we are not to stand in a mammering, not knowing whether our faith be
right, or wrong, but we are to be persuaded in our hearts, it is the true faith
of Jesus Christ, we hold and profess, We are to be persuaded in our hearts
that the faith of Jesus Christ we hold and profess is the true faith.
and to be resolved rather to forgo our lives, then to forsake it, and this is
that which the Apostle does enforce upon the Corinthians: 1. Cor. 16.13. says
he, stand fast in the faith, etc. and again Ephesians. 4.12. Ephesians. 4.12.
he says, it is one special use of the ministry of the Gospel, that Christ
ascending up on high gave gifts unto men, some to be Apostles, and some
Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers for the
gathering together of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the
edification of the body of Christ, etc. that we henceforth should be no more
like children tossed up and down altogether in uncertainty, but that we should
be settled in all points of religion, we profess, and have our hearts
stablished with grace, as we have it Hebr. 13.9. the reason and ground of this
that our knowledge and faith should be thus settled and stablished, is, because
it is knowledge and faith of the Gospel, We are not to be unsettled in the
principal points of religion as some be.
that every cavil of any seducer should drive us from our hold, and make us
doubt whether we go right or wrong, let this be far from us to be so light
and wandering.



which thou know, and then thou shall not be left to shift for thy self,
and to roll up and down in doubtfulnes, and uncertainty, for want of
direction, but thou shall then have a faithful guide and directer, within
thine own breast, thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee (as says the
Prophet Isay, 30.21. even the voice of the spirit of God who is always in them
that are upright and true hearted Christians, saying this is the way, walk in
it, for mark what the Lord promises to them that faithfully serve him,
Psalm. 25.12. What man is he that fears the Lord? him will he teach the
way that he shall choose.

Again, consider that excellent speech of our Savior to this purpose John
7.17. if any man do the will of my Father, he shall know of the doctrine whether
it be of God or whether I speak of my self; Note.
he that is a doer of the will of God in true and sincere obedience, he shall
not be left in doubt, but shall be taught the truth by the Spirit of God, and
fully resolved of the same, and indeed if men be left wavering and doubting
whether they be in the right way or no, it is because they are laden with sins,
and carried away with their own lusts, and are utterly void of the fear of
God, therefore labor thou to fear God, and to obey his will, according to the
measure of knowledge, and thou shall be guided by the spirit of God, to know
the truth, to love and embrace the truth, yea thou shall have thine heart so
stablished by grace, as that thou shall be settled, and fully resolved to live
and die in the truth held and professed.

And that we may be stirred up to this duty, consider we that the end of the
doctrine of the Gospel is to confirm us, and to make us certain of Gods
grace in Jesus Christ to make us rejoice in Gods presence in this world, even
to speak to God in prayer, and to meet him with comfort in his word and
Sacraments, and at the day of judgment, to stand with holdnesse before the
throne of glory. Now this cannot be done so long as we are wavering, and
floating up and down in uncertainty, John says, 2. epist. 9. whosoever
abides not constant in the doctrine of Christ, he has not God to be his
gracious Father, if then we would not disappoint our selves of the chief
comfort of the Gospel, let us never rest till we be so settled, and confirmed
in our true knowledge and faith of the Gospel, that no blast of false
doctrine, or breath of any seducer, can be able to remove us.

True faith has relation to the word preached.
and refer the faith wherein he would have the Colossians stablished, to the
doctrine of the Gospel that had been taught amongst them, (stablished in the
faith as ye have been taught etc.) Hence we may take up this known conclusion.

That true faith has relation to the word preached, true faith is conceived
and wrought by the public ministry, and teaching of the word, ca^l to mind for
proof of this, only that known gradation of the Apostle, Romans 10.14. How
shall they believe in him of whom they have not herd and how shall they hear
without a preacher, and the inference upon that, verse 17. is this, then faith
is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Now this makes it Faith built on
visions and apparitions and private illumination of the spirit is a mere fancy.
a mere dotage, and device of the devil 2. Cor. 3.8. the Apostle calls his
preaching the ministration of the Spirit, giving us to understand that the word
and spirit are so nearly conjoined, that they must always go together, the
Spirit shines unto us in the word, and the word is powerful by the Spirit,
and we must be taught of God, but it must be by the word, and by the
ministry of man, our Savior Christ, John 14.26. promises that his Spirit
shall suggest, and bring all things to the minds of his Apostles, and
followers, which he had taught them, and not any new doctrines or revelations;
therefore they who rest upon any revelations in the matter of Faith, besides
the word, most falsely pretend the Spirit of God.

Again, let this conclusion be thought on to further The faith of many
persons discovered to be but a mere imagination.
for why? do not many say they believe their salvation by Christ, and yet live
in continual neglect, or contempt of the public ministry of the word, they
either come not to the public exercises of the word, or care not to profit by
them. Let such persons know that their faith is indeed but a fancy, and as it
is not conceived by the teaching of the word, nor built on the word, so in
time of trial, it will minister unto them no comfort from the word, the
storehouse of all sound and saving comfort.

One thing more may be gathered from these words, In that the Apostle would
have the Colossians to be stablished in that faith they had been taught, we
may conclude.

That we are to be as fully persuaded of the truth of We are to be as fully
persuaded of the truth of Gods word and promise taught by man lawfully called,
as if God himself should speak unto us from heaven.
for why? God has so ordained, it is the ordinance of God that the promises of
the Gospel should be preached and* applied to our souls by the ministry of
man, and by virtue of Gods ordinance, the word and promise truly taught, and
applied by a lawful minister, is as certain and infallible, as if the Lord
should immediately speak from heaven himself, and for this very cause says
the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 2.1.3. thank we God without ceasing, that when ye
received of us the word of the preaching of God, ye received it, not as the
word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God, which also works in you
that believe, a plain and pregnant proof of the point delivered

And this (for the use of it) may serve to strengthen us in faith, Strength to
our faith and comfort unto us in time of trouble and temptation.
when we are conflicting with Satan, and wrestling against despair, if then
it please the Lord either to bring to our remembrance, the sweet promises of
the Gospel, we have heard delivered, and applied in the public ministry, we
are to apprehend and to take hold of them, and to be fully persuaded of the
truth of them to our comfort, or if it please the Lord at such a time to send
unto us his minister, to declare unto us our righteousness, as Job says cap.
33.23. and to say unto us out of the word of God, believe, and repent, and Gods
mercy belongs unto thee, we are then to be as verily persuaded of the truth of
that promise, as if God himself should speak unto us with his own immediate
voice from heaven, and so to be comforted and strengthened in our faith, and
full assurance of Gods mercy: when Nathan came to David being cast down to the
mouth of hell, (yet his faith not altogether failing, and told him in the word
of a Prophet, as we read 2. Sam. 12, 13. the Lord has put away thy sin, no
doubt David's heart was much cheered, and comforted, and his soul much
strengthened in the assurance of Gods mercy, yea doubtless more comforted by
Nathans speech, then if all the men in his kingdom, being not prophets should
have said as much unto him, because the promise and blessing belongs properly
to the minister in the discharge of his function, when therefore in the like
case the minister shall say unto us, believe and repent, and mercy belongs unto
thee; we are then to be as thoroughly persuaded it is true, as if God himself
should call us by name and say believe thou, and repent, and mercy belongs to
thee, or say unto us; I am thy Father, and thou art my child if thou believe
and repent.

It follows, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

In these words the Apostle makes known to the Colossians, that he would have
them so far from being deficient in faith, as that they should abound and
increase and grow to greater measure, and that with cheerfulness.
Interpretation.
For that is briefly the meaning of the words, abounding in that faith ye have
been taught, with cheerfulness, for concluding of the first point hence
offered, we are to mark that the Apostle does not say abounding in faith
generally, and so urging upon the Colossians, the general proposition, that
they should continually grow in grace, in faith, etc. but he does limitte his
speech to that faith, they had been taught, and says abounding therein.

Hence we may gather that to the doctrine of faith; To the doctrine of faith
or any other grace taught amongst us we are to add an increase in respect of
our selves in particular.
and use of that grace.

Understanding aright, we are not to add unto it any different thing, that
were to add to the word of God, but after the hearing of the doctrine of
faith, or any other grace, we are to gather more unto our selves in
particular, touching both particular knowledge, Note.
and particular use of the same, then that we have heard delivered unto us;
for proof of this read Matthew 13.23. he that receives the seed of the
word in good ground etc. that I observe from thence, fitting the point in
hand, is this.

That good hearers must be like good ground, and good ground (as we know)
brings forth more in harvest, then was cast into it, in seed time, so good
hearers receiving the seed of the word into honest and good hearts, must send
forth the same seed, but with some increase in respect of themselves, they
must add a measure to that they have received. Thus did David, he did not
content himself with that he had received of his teachers, but but did daily
increase in his particular knowledge, and use of the things taught, in so much
as he became wiser, and had more understanding then all his teachers, Psalm.
119.99. thus must we do, we must daily add to that we are taught a
particular knowledge, and use of it to our selves.

Means helping us to ad an increase to that we have been taught are two.
but how is that to be done? I answer, the means helping to that purpose are
many, but especially these two.

David says, he had more understanding then all his teachers, because the
testimonies of the Lord were his daily meditation.

more particular knowledge, and use of things heard, and of the doctrine of any
grace delivered in the public ministry, is an expressing of that in our
lives, which is made known by teaching, and an exercising of that grace we
are taught by the word, as occasion is offered, for by expressing, and by
exercise of faith, love, patience, and other graces, we shall come to more
particular knowledge and use of those graces, then by the doctrine of the best
teacher in the world, yea by exercise it comes to pass many times, that
private men are able to speak of faith, and of other graces, with better
knowledge and conscience then some preacher, Hebrews 5.8. it is said that our
Savior himself learned obedience, by the things which he suffered, he
exercising obedience in suffering, he learned obedience, and Romans 5.4. it
is said that the exercise of patience brings forth experience (mark it) by
exercising patience under the cross, we come to such a a particular and
experimental knowledge of our own weakness by nature, and of our strength
by grace, and by the assistance of Gods spirit, as we cannot possibly have by
the doctrine of patience.

We see then that by serious meditation on things taught and by exercising that
grace that is made known unto us by the ministry of the word, we may add a
further measure in regard of our particular knowledge, Reproof of such as are
defective in this duty.
we are so far from adding any measure, and abounding in faith or other
grace, as that we retain not things received, but let them slip and run
out of our minds, yea it may be we never thought this to be our duty, to
add any thing to that we are taught, indeed (as I said) we are not to add
any new thing unto it of our selves, but yet we are by good means to go on
to a further increase of our particular knowledge, Two motives to stir us up
to this duty.
and use of things taught, and to help us forward in this, consider we these
two things.

First, all the grace, and all the faith we have, or can reach unto, is little
enough in time of temptation, when there comes a trial of our faith, patience,
meekness, humility, or any other grace that is in us, we shall find, that all
we have is little enough, even holy Job, though he had a great measure of
patience, yet he found it too little in time of his greatest trial.

Again consider we, that if we rest in that we hear and learn by teaching,
and labor not to add unto it a particular knowledge and use, surely our
knowledge may end in ignorance and prophannes, for such knowledge is either
conceived by the strength of natural understanding, or at the most, it is but
a general illumination, and common to us with the reprobate, and if we go no
further, it must needs fail in the end, and by the just hand of God fall
either into ignorance or prophanenes, our Savior says Math. 13.12. whosoever
has not (that is) as appears by the circumstance of the place, has not more
then a general illumination, from him shall be taken away, even that he has
even his gifts of nature, as understanding, dexterity of wit, and the like; let
it therefore be thought on, that the greatest measure of grace is little enough
in the time of trial, and if we rest in that we learn by teaching, our
knowledge in the end may fall into ignorance or prophannesse.

Yea we may be left not only destitute of heavenly graces, but by the just
hand of God, be stripped and deprived of the good gifts of nature. Let us
therefore be stirred up to labor, both by serious meditation on things taught,
and by exercise of that grace that is made known by the word, to gather more
particular knowledge, and use of faith, or any other grace, then possibly we
can come unto, by hearing the best teachers.

The next thing hence offered to our consideration, is from the word here used
(abounding or exceeding) for the word signifies not, that there can be any
excess of faith, or any other grace, as the Papists writing on Acts. 17.22.
foolishly define superstition, to be an excess of religion, but that we are
not to content our selves with a small measure or mediocrity of faith, but to
labor for a plerophory, for store and plenty of Faith?

Hence then we see, what is a lawful desire and seeking We may lawfully and
we ought to use al good means to increase in faith and inward graces of Gods
spirit 1. Cor. 15 58.
but wherein? not in wealth and outward things, we are not to seek for such
things more then necessary for nature and person, but we may lawfully use all
good means to increase in faith, and inward graces of Gods spirit, yea it is
our duty so to do, as the Apostle exhorts, 1. Cor. 15. last verse, therefore
my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, immovable, abundant always in the work
of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord;
the reason is plain (namely) this.

Because the greatest measure of grace we can reach in this life, is not more
then necessary to salvation,

Now most men have their desires and affections set on the world, and greedily
hunt after abundance of riches, Reproof of such as greed ly hunt after the
things of this life and have little or ^o care to seek after spiritual good
things.
and honors, such as have plenty are never satisfied, such as are poor,
esteem them that have plenty most happy, and so every one almost labors to
gather riches to himself, but not to be rich in God as our Savior speaks,
Luke the 12.21. to heap up, if possibly he can, though by unlawful means
abundance of wealth, and riches, but few or none seek after the true riches
and treasures, after abundance of spiritual gifts and graces which indeed
ought to be sought for above all the wealth in the world, and to this end we
are to disburden our selves of care and greedy seeking after the things of this
life; the thorny cares of this world choke the seed of the word, and make it
unfruitful, Matthew 13.22. yea such as have abundance of riches and outward
good things, ought to spend more time, more care and labor in seeking after
grace and spiritual things, then they who are in poverty, and want things
needful,

Thus much the Apostle teaches us, 1. Cor. 7.21. when he says to the servant,
if thou may be free, use it rather, such as have plenty of wealth, have or
may have more freedom to attend on holy exercises, Note.
therefore they are to give more time to attend on the means, effectual for
the working and increase of grace in them, and if thou be poor, yet seek
for abundance of grace, if thou attain that, thou art richer then the richest
in the world, wanting grace, Two motives to stir us up to labor* after plenty
of grace.
and to stir up every one to labor* after plenty of grace, if thou be
rich, consider that thy life stands not in thy abundance, as Christ himself
says, Luke 12.15. if thou have no more care to be rich in grace; as thou art

Mary's part Luke 10.42. though the entertaining of Christ was as necessary as
any outward business, yet it was not necessary in comparison of that one
thing, for without this a man cannot be saved, which he may without any thing
else having this. Let us therefore in the fear of God be stirred up, not so
greedily to hunt after the things of this life, but to labor and seek after
this one thing, so absolutely necessary to our own salvation. Let us never
rest till by the use of good means, we attain to a plentiful measure of
grace, and by the spirit of grace be transformed into the image of Jesus
Christ.

Come we to the last words (with thanksgiving) the doctrine offered unto us,
hence is this.

That as we abound in faith, so are we to abound in As many as ab^und in
faith they abound also in thanksgiving to God.
it is not possible that any should have much faith and little thankfulness
to God for his mercy, the woman in the Gospel being assured of much mercy in
the forgiveness of many sins, returned much love to Christ Luke 7 47. and
certainly, if there be in the heart abundance of faith, a plerophory, and
full persuasion of Gods We are to examine our selves touching the measure of
our thanksgiving to God. Ps. 100.16.11.
and make a man say with David, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his
benefits toward me, yea it will make him keep a continual remembrance, with
a serious acknowledgement of Gods mercy toward him, and to dedicate and
consecrate his body and soul, and all that he has, to the honor and service
of almighty God, for that is true According to the measure of our thanksgiving
to God for his mercy in Christ so is the measure of our faith.
Let no man then deceive himself, but take it for an infallible rule, that
according to the measure of our faith, will ever be the measure of thanksgiving.

And again, according to the measure of our thanksgiving to God for his mercy
in Christ, so is the measure of our faith, and remember withal that if our
thanksgiving to God be not greater for his mercy in Christ, Note.
then it is for other blessings vouchsafed, we have no faith at all, happily
we can open our mouths and bless God for our health, our wealth, and other
outward good things, (which is commendable indeed) but if we have not our
hearts more enlarged, if we cannot more bless God for the work of faith in
our hearts, by the ministry of his word, and for his mercy apprehended in
Jesus Christ our hearts are not right within us, for that is the greatest
blessing of God that can be vouchsafed in this life, and if we be more
thankful for other blessings then for that, we have as yet no apprehension of
Gods mercy in Christ at all.

Examine thy self therefore whosoever thou art, have thou no thanksgiving to
God for that excellent gift of faith apprehending the mercy of God in Christ,
or less thanksgiving for that, then for other inferior gifts? certainly then
thou have no faith at all.

And again, have thou thine heart enlarged, is the very joy of thine heart,
and can thou more delight to bless God for his mercy apprehended by faith in
Christ, then for any other good thing that is a sure argument of a sound faith,
yea, that is a great argument that faith does inwardly abound in thine heart,
and then thou may justly rejoice and say, blessed be God my faith
increases, and I shall certainly go on daily to a clearer sight of Gods mercy
in Jesus Christ, and in the end be made truly conformable to my head and
Savior the Lord Jesus.

VER. 8. Beware least there be any man that spoil you through Philosophy, and
vain deceit, through the traditions of men, according to the rudiments of the
world, and not after Christ.
In this verse the Apostle returns again to that general proposition.

That all things out of Christ in the matter of salvation are mere deceit and
vanity; and here he comes to a more particular handling of it, laying before
the Colossians the special means used by seducers to deceive them, and to
draw them from Christ, and to thrust, upon them other things besides Christ,
that is the general matter contained in this verse.

Now this matter is expressed and laid out in these particulars. First in a
caveat and premonition forewarning to take heed of seducement; which
seducement is set forth by the nature aed force of it, where it takes place,
that it is of a corrupting and spoiling nature, in these words beware least
there be any that spoil you.

Secondly, in a special mention of some particular means whereby seducers use
to deceive (namely) these three

First, philosophy which is further by way of explication, said to be vain
deceit.

Secondly the traditions of men.

Thirdly the rudiments of the world.

Then in the last words of the verse, the Apostle does oppose to all these
corruptions, a general refutation, that these things must needs be false,
deceitful and of a spoiling nature, because they draw men from Christ, and from
seeking happiness and salvation by Christ alone, this is implied in those last
words (and not after Christ.)

Come we to speak of the Apostles caveat and premonition, together with the
first particular means of seducement, used by seducers, in these words),
Beware least there be any man that spoil you through philosophy, and vain
deceit. Beware, the original word signifies see, or look, it is a word proper
to the eyes of the body, but here transferd to the mind; and the meaning of
the Apostle is, let there be in you a vigilant care and diligent
heedefulnesse; (spoil you) this word is metaphorical, borrowed from thieves
and robbers, who come upon a fold of sheep, take and bind the sheep, and
carry them away as a prey, and the meaning is, beware least there be any that
cease upon you by imposture and seducement, and bind you, and carry you away
from the true faith of Christ, as a spoil, as a prey, and a booty;
(philosophy) this word properly signifies love or study of wisdom, but it
is here put to signify doctrine fetched from Heathen wise men and from their
books and writings containing the knowledge and science of natural and moral
virtues, and least the Apostle should seem generally to condemn all such
knowledge, both moral and natural, he adds further as a restraint (and
vain deceit) (that is) such doctrine fetched from Philosophers and Heathen
wise men, as is a vain and pernicious seduction, and drawing out of the way,
for so the word translated (deceit) signifies even a drawing out of the way
from Christ, and his true doctrine into errors, and in the end to destruction,
thus then are these words to be conceived, as if the Apostle had said.

Let there be in you a vigilant care and watchfulness, least there be any
that by imposture do cease upon you, and carry you away as a prey, or a booty,
and that by means of some corrupt doctrine derived and taken from
Philosophers, and Heathen wise men, which may seem to carry a show of wisdom,
but indeed is a vain and pernicious drawing out of the way from Christ, to
error, and to destruction. (beware) we are taught that heed and
circumspection, is needful, in respect of deceivers and seducers, we are to
take heed of such as go about to corrupt our faith, and our religion, and to
draw us into error, We are to take heed of seducers who seek to corrupt our
faith and religion and to draw us into errou^
yea, though we be such as are well grounded in the truth, yet are we to
take heed of seducement and drawing away, the Apostle witnesses of the
Colossians verse 5. that they were steadfast in the faith, yet he thought it
meet to give them this caveat, beware least there be any that spoil you,
etc. Hence it is that he says, Phillip. 3.1. it grieved not him to write to
them of that Church the same things, for he knew it to be a sure thing, even a
thing tending to their confirmation and stre^gthning against seducers, and then
he subioynes a tripled premonition, Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers,
beware of the concision: giving us thereby to understand, how needful it is
even for such as are well instructed, having been often taught the same things,
to look about them, to take heed of the deceit of false teachers, for indeed
the Lord who has the ordering, and does ever order the malice of Satan, for
the good of his Church, does suffer Seducers in the Church, for the exercise of
the faith and patience of his chosen, and for the manifestation of such as be
sound in the truth. 1. Cor. 11.19. Therefore they that be most sound in the
truth, are to be wary and to take heed of seducement.

It were easy further to show the necessity of this duty,

To this I answer,

Alas may some say, Cor. 11 14.15. how then shall we know them?

Ans. teacher, and having found him out so to be, and discovered him, we are in
the second place to avoid him Romans 16.17* I beseech you mark them diligently,
which cause division and offenses, contrary to the doctrine ye have lear-and
avoid them, yea, a false teacher being known to us we are to avoid the very
breath of him, We are to avoid the very breath of false teachers.
we are to give him no entertainment,

The next thing we have here to observe, is the nature and force of
seducement, where it takes place, that it is of a spoiling nature, therefore
the Apostle says not (Beware least any seduce you) but least any spoil you;
the point of

That where deceivers, teachers of error, fasten upon any person or people,
they spoil them, Where false teachers fasten upon any person or people they
spoil them.
they carry them away from the truth, as the bear, wolf or lion carry away
their prey which is not able to resist them, 2. Cor. 11. The Apostle painting
out the manners of false teachers, and by way of exprobration, reproouing the
Corinthians for suffering them amongst them, says thus; ye suffer even if a
man bring you into bondage, if a man devour

Whence it is clear that where teachers of error are suffered, they bring men
into bondage, they spoil and devour them. Act. 20.30. the Apostle says to
the elders of Ephesus, of your own selves, shall men arise speaking perverse
things, to draw disciples after them; the words carry this sense, that false
teachers rising up amongst them, and speaking perverse things, should so far
prevail with some, as they should make them (as it were, swear unto their
opinions, thus indeed did the Arrians the Donatists and other heretics in
succeeding times, as might be showed at large.

First, therefore this may serve to make us cease from maruelling We are not to
marvel some persons that are drawn to error become of obstinate in their
error.
and drawn away to papisme to brownism or the like, become wilful and
obstinate in their errors; here is the reason of it, false teachers have
spoiled them, and made a prey of them and hold them so fast, that a good
shepherd may happily take out of the mouth of the lion, two legs, a piece of
an care, as the Prophet speaks, Amos 3.12. but the greatest part they will
hold without rescue or recovery, yea, lamentable experience shows, that where
deceiving Jesuits and popish priests fasten upon poor silly souls, they cease
not only on their minds, in corrupting them with error, but upon their very
wills, so that, talk with them, and you shall find though they seem willing to
be resolved, and to learn the truth yet they will not, but when they hear a
reason, which they cannot answer, instead of yielding, they say, were such and
such here they could answer you, in this case, they do as Pharaoh did, Exodus
7.11. who when himself could not tell what to say, to so manifest a sign as
was wrought by Moses and Aaron, yet he persuaded himself his wise men and his
enchanters could, and send for them he will, to see what they can say, rather
then yield to the work of God, and thus do many seduced persons, when they
know not what to answer themselves, yet they think that such and such can, and
so they continue wilfully blinded and hardened in their errors: Let us not
therefore marvel when we see persons seduced, by popish enchanters, having
been dealt withal, by such as are able to convince them, still wilful and
obstinate in their errors, and hating to be reclaimed, deceivers have taken
them, and carried them away as a booty, and hold them fast under their power,
and by their iugglings, have not only shut up their eyes, that they cannot
see the truth, but by the just judgment of God, have bound up the power of
their wills, so as they will not be made to see it when they do see it.

We must not only avoid seducers but affect the truth and receive it in love
of it.
for indeed because men receive not the love of the truth hence it is as the
Apostle has taught us, 2 Thessalonians. 2.11. that God sends them strong delusions to
believe lies, even such delusions as strongly deceive them, and strongly hold
them, being deceived, for so much the words do import (...). That the Lord
sends upon them such errors as not only prevail with them, but are powerful
and strong to hold them, having erred, so as they have neither power nor will
to wind themselves out, but think themselves in happy case and right, when
they are most wrong, and so go on stiff and stubborn against the truth, and
against their own good, till they perish and be damned in hell, let this be
thought on, and let it stir us up to receive the truth in love of the truth,
and to testify our love to the truth.

1. Means.
Let us hate and detest all contrary error, as David says he did Psalm.
119.104. having gotten understanding of the truth, he hated always of falsehood.

Come we to the first particular means here set down whereby seducers use to
prey upon poor Christians (namely) philosophy and vain deceit, the Papists
in their notes on this place, charge us to be such as advance philosophy above
the due place, and say we have no other argument against the real presence in
the Sacrament of the Lords supper, but such as are borrowed from philosophy,
concerning quantity, place, position, dimensions, sight, taste and other
straites of reason, which indeed is a mere cavil and standerous imputation,
for we have many other arguments against that carnal presence both out of
Scripture and out of ancient Divines, and again, we bring no arguments out of
philosophy, but such as have ground in Scripture, the Scripture teaching that
Christ was truly incarnate, and had a true body like unto ours, had all the
essential properties of a true body, we hence conclude according to the rules
of philosophy, that his body is visible, circumscribed, locally and present
only in on place at one A doctrine grounded on philosophy is a means of
drawing out of the way from the truth of religion.
that is clear from these words of the Apostle, and the reason of it is
manifest.

Because the wisdom of man is blind in matters of religion, Romans 1.22. when
the Philosophers, and wise men among the heathen professed themselves to be
wise in matters of faith and religion, they became fools; therefore a doctrine
grounded on their writings must needs be a means of seduction and drawing
away from the truth into error. And this we may easily retort and turn back
upon the head of our adversaries especially the schole Divines amongst them,
who ground many doctrines on Philosophy as justification by inherent
righteousness, freedom of will and diverse others.

Let the use of this be thus much unto us, let it teach us to look to the
ground of every doctrine tendered unto us that it be grounded on the written
word of God the foundation of all true faith and learn we to suspect speeches
clothed in philosophical habit, under them many times lies hid much
corruption. Let us not then receive things offered unto us in that manner hand
over head but with examination. I deny not all use of philosophy, there may be
good use of it in divinity.

And I will now briefly show how far forth philosophy is pernicious and
hurtful to religion, and how far forth it is not.

First therefore know that philosophy and the learning of the heathen is
hurtful to religion, in that it puts down some things utterly false and
against the word of God as the eternity of this world, that chief happiness
is found in civil virtue, that virtue is nothing else but a mediocrity or
moderation of natural affection without renouation or change of them by grace
and such like.

Secondly, it is pernicious to religion, in that such things as have their
truth in philosophy and nature are abused to ouerturne or corrupt some truth in
religion, for example, that of nothing, nothing is made; it is true in nature
and reason, but it is false in divinity and religion, that teaching us that God
made all things of nothing, that from a privation to an habit there is no
return, has some truth in philosophy, but in religion it holds not true,
because from death to life there is a return, and there shall be a
resurrection of the body; that the justice and righteousness by which a man is
just and righteous is formal inherent in himself not in another, as wisdom
or learning is in him that is wise or learned is true in philosophy, but false
in divinity, because the justice and righteousness by which we are just and
righteous in the sight of God, is not inherent in us, but it is the
righteousness of Christ imputed unto us, many other instances might be given,
but these may sufficiently clear it, that philosophy is dangerous to religion
in that such things as have truth in philosophy are abused to ouerturne or to
corrupt some truth in religion.

Now on the other side, How philosophy is not hurtful but rather helpful to
religion.
philosophy and the science of natural things and moral virtues delivered by
Heathen men is not hurtful to religion in things there truly delivered and
used as a servant unto divinity, and so as it may be a means to further us in
the knowledge of God, and of heavenly things, for certainly the knowledge of
natural things and moral virtues may help in the knowledge of things heavenly
and divine, the Scripture it self does sometimes send us to the teaching of
nature, and of natural things, 1. Cor. 11.14. says the Apostle, does not
nature it self teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto
him, Christ himself sends his followers to the fowls of the air, and to the
lillies of the field to learn that excellent point of the providence of God,
in the preservation of them; the book of Job is full of arguments from things
natural to manifest and make known the infinite wisdom and power of God, and
there is no doubt, but that Moses and Daniel being instructed in the wisdom of
the Egyptians and Caldeans they made good use of that knowledge, let no man
then simply condemn philosophy and all liberal arts and sciences as some
foolishly do but so far forth as philosophy puts down things utterly false, or
as the rules of it are abused to overthrow or corrupt some truth in religion.

Let us learn to profit by our knowledge of any natural thing, let our
knowledge of a thing natural, We are to profit by our knowledge of natural
things
serve as a step to ascend by, to the knowledge and consideration of some
things heavenly and spiritual; for example we know that the eye has a faculty
and power of seeing. Let us thereby be led forward to consider that here is an
eye in heaven that sees more.

That in God the creator and maker of the eye, there is a power of seeing all
things. Thus did David reason, Ps. 94.9. he that formed the eye shall he not
see, he rises up from a consideration of sight given to the eye, to consider
the all-seeing eye of Gods providence; we knowing that there is in man a
conscience that does check him for notorious known sins (as it does if it
be not hardened and cast asleep by custom of sin.) This ought to lead us a
long to consider of a judgment to come, that there shall be a time when God
will bring all to judgment. Even our meat, drink and apparel, are to put us
in mind of the necessity of the food of our souls, and the inward hablements
and clothing of the soul, yea, the grass of the field, and the flowers of
our gardens flourishing for a time, and then fading away, are to put us in
mind of the short continuance and fading state of our lives, thus doing we
shall walk in earthly things and have heavenly minds, and make a right use of
our philosophy, even of our contemplation and knowledge of natural things.

Observe with me one thing further from these words (namely) this, that the
Apostle calls philosophy, the best learning of heathen, thrust upon men in
respect of true comfort and salvation, not only a deceit, but vain deceit, a
vain thing, such as has not in it that soundnes of comfort that is happily
expected by it, hence we are taught.

The greatest knowledge in humane learning will disappoynt a man if he look
for true comfort by it.
if a man think himself happy and lift up himself in regard of his excellent
knowledge gotten by his natural wit, and by study of the best humane learning
he deceiues himself, he shall vanish away in his own speculation, for why? true
saving and lasting comfort is not there to be found, it is only found in the
knowledge of the word of God, which is therefore called, and that by way of
exclusion shutting out true comfort from any other word, the word of comfort,
and the word of life. Hence it is, that the Saints of God have ever found such
delight and sweetness in the word of God, as they have preferred it before the
sweetest things, and made it the very joy of their hearts.

The knowledge that men of the best wits, and by the greatest study come to by
human learning cannot minister to them any true comfort in time of their
outward pressures and in time of their troubles, that lie on their bodies, it
can only tell them this or that trouble is to be born with patience, because
there is a necessity of the bearing of it, being laid upon them, there is no
remedy but they must bear it, or it may be, it can go thus far, as to tell
them that God will have it so, but their knowledge they have by humane learning
cannot show them in that trouble, the good and holy will of God, and the love
of God even in that trouble and that God is still the same good God unto them
in afflicting of them that he was before he laid that affliction on them, thus
far it cannot go, in regard of outward trouble, much less can it yield true
comfort in anguish of soul or perplexity of mind and conscience.

Now then this being so, that the greatest knowledge Such as take delight in
reading humane histories must moderate their delight.
let them as many as take delight (I will not say in reading of vain and
frivolous tales, but in reading true humane hystories of this Kingdom or any
other (which I speak not against, it is a commendable thing to read them) but
this I say, let such as take pleasure and delight in reading of them, learn to
moderate their delight, and let them take heed they be not carried away with
too much delight in reading of them, it is the corruption of our nature, to be
too much tickled with delight, and to place a felicity in reading such
hystories, and so to spend all the time we have to spare in reading of them,
but let us learn thus to think with our selves, will the knowledge I get by
reading those stories stay me in the day of my trouble? will it comfort me in
the hour of my death? then it is a sure thing, then is it comfortable indeed,
but if upon due consideration we find it to be vain and empty of all such
comfort, and that if we rest upon it, we wait upon a lying vanity and forsake
our own mercy as the Prophet speaks Jonah 2.1. Then let us take less delight
in turning over such books and seeking after such knowledge, and let us labor
to have our hearts possessed with greater delight in reading of Gods book which
is the volume of true comfort, and will furnish us with such comfort as will
stand by us in all times of trouble and distress either of body or mind both
in life and death

There is no true comfort to be found in natural knowledge.
even out of moral philosophy which seems to teach the way to true happiness is
not able to yield him any dram of true comfort in time of trouble, what comfort
then can such persons find as rest in their natural knowledge I mean in that
knowledge they have only by their mother wit, some persons will freely confess
they are not book-learned, and indeed they have not any jot either of humane or
divine knowledge which they ought to have, and might have had by the means long
continued amongst them they know not the distinction of the persons in the
trinity, or at least cannot distinctly tell what any of them has done for
them, they are not acquainted with the properties of God nor with his actions,
they know not his truth, his justice, his power, his mercy, and other his
attributes as they are made known in his word, happily they know them as they
may be known by the light of reason, and so did the Heathen, as the Apostle
witnesses, but alas that is a comfortles knowledge serving only to leave
them without excuse, let such as bless themselves in their natural knowledge,
such as content themselves to know God and the things of God as they may be
known by a natural man, let them consider that when trouble comes upon them,
they shall be left destitute and void of comfort especially when trouble of
mind comes, they shall then have nothing to oppose to the accusation of a
guilty conscience, nothing to the burning wrath and fearful displeasure of
God, but shall ly open to fear, trembling and desparation to voluntary death,
yea, to lay violent hands upon themselves.

Let these things be thought on, and let them stir us up not to rest in such
knowledge of God and the things of God, as we have by the light of nature,
which is comfortless, and will then disappoynt us of comfort, when we have
most need of it, but let us labor for that knoweledge which is offered and
may be had from the word of God, which will be sure to afford us true and
sound comfort, even in the greatest conflict of mind and conscience that can
befall us.

Come we to the second means used by seducers to deceive through philosophy
and vain deceit through the traditions of men, by traditions, etc.
Interpretation.
The Apostle in this place means such doctrine, rules or precepts as were
merely devised by men either contrary or Doctrines merely invented by men
spoil such as embrace the^.
we may find Mat. 15.9. that traditions are called men's precepts or rules,
merely invented by men, and ver. 3. such as cross and thwart the commandments
of God, such as be contrary, or at lest besides the written word of God, hence
then does the Apostle give us this conclusion.

That such doctrines in the case of religion are as mere inventions of men
having no ground in the written word of God, they spoil such as embrace them,
and draw them away from the truth into error, the reason

The written word of God is a perfect rule both of faith and manners, and
contains all things needful to be known, believed or practiced, it is
suffi^iently able to make us wise to salvation these things are written, Ioh.
20.31.
that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God, and that in
believing ye might have life through his name, and the Apostle says, Romans
15.4.
whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that
we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope: therefore
any doctrine added to the doctrine of the word, it being so absolute in it
self, Confutation of popish unwritten traditions.
now such are the unwritten traditions of the Papists, their doctrine touch^ng
their masses, trentalles, dirges, half communions, invocation of Saints,
adoration of images, hallowing of bread, water, oil, crossings, ceremonies and
many more of that stamp, they are all mere inventions of men, and such as
embrace them, are drawn from the truth to error; but the Papists plead and
say, these things are not so to be taxed as mee^e inventions of men.

Ob.
Because (say they) they were not ordained by mere humane power, but by Christ
his warrant and authority, by such as are placed over his Church, of whom he
says, he that hears you hears me, and he that despises you despise^h
me, they are appointed by the holy Ghost joining with their Pastors in the
regiment of the Church this is their color they set upon them, but to take
from them this shift.



Again, it is true indeed, Christ says, he that hears you hears me etc.
but how? so long as they teach nothing but that Christ has taught; he does
not assure us, whosoever hears man being called to teach, hears him simply
whatsoever he teach, but so long as man preaches Gods word and that appears
Ioh. 14.26. the comforter which is the holy Ghost, whom the father will send in
my name he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
remembrance, which I have told you Christ there promises that his spirit shall
suggest to the minds of his disciples all things, which he had taught them, and
not any new doctrines, therefore the Church of Rome cannot free their unwritten
verities from being found mere humane inventions, and we are to avoid them as
things that will spoil and draw us away from the truth into error, and embrace
only such doctrines, as are grounded on the written word of God, which is
perfectly able to make us wise to salvation.

Now to the third means used by seducers to deceive rudiments of the world,
and not after Christ.

These words if they be considered with the former they have respect unto them
on this manner, that the traditions of men were according to the rudiments of
the world according to the rites of the ceremonial law so indeed were the
traditions and rules of Pharisees touching washing of cups and platters and the
like, but these words besides the relation do imply that the rudime^ts of the
world are hurtful, and so I make them a third means used by seducers to
deceive.

Now the word translated Rudiments does properly signify elements, and by
rudiments or elements, Interpretation.
we are to understand the legal doctrine of Moses in the old Testament, the
rules and precepts given by Moses touching circumcision Jewish sacrifices, and
concerning many rites and ceremonies among the Jews as the eating of certain
meats and abstaining from other, the observation of days and times, wearing of
this or that kind of garment. Now these legal precepts and rules are called
by the Apostle, rudiments or elements by way of similitude, either alluding to
the four elements of the world, fire, air, earth and water, whereof all
perfect bodies under the heavens are compounded or rather indeed, to the first
elements of the instruction of ch^^d^en to the letters the A. B. C. or primar,
wherein little children are first instructed and thence led forward to the
exercise and study of more excellent learning such were the legal precepts
touching circumcision, Jewish sacrifices and the rites among the Jews they
were but as the A. B. C. the first letters wherein the Jews were trained up as
children for a time till the coming of Christ. At which time was revealed both
to them and the whole world a more excellent doctrine, and that this is the
allusion of the Apostle appears plainly, Gal 4.3. where speaking of himself
and all the Jews under the law, he says, when we were children, we were in
bondage under the rudiments of the world.

Again these legal precepts are said to be rudiments or elements of the
world, because they were concerning outward and visible things. Thus then are
we to conceive these words of the Apostle, According to the rudiments of the
world, as if he had said, according to the precepts and rules given by Moses
touching circumcision, Jewish sacrificies, and many outward rites among the
Jews which were but as a Paedagogie or an A. B. C. to instruct the Jews only
for a time, till the coming of Christ at which time was revealed a full and
more plentiful doctrine.

The law of ceremonies g uen by Moses is in some case pernicious to Gods people.
Now here first let it be considered of us, that these words of the Apostle
do implie that the legal rules and precept given by Moses teaching
circumcision, Jewish sacrifices and and services under the Law may be a means
to spoil people or persons, and to draw them from the truth of religion and
from Christ to perdition, therefore the Apostle gives warning to the Colossians
to beware least any spoil them, not only by the rules of philosophy and
traditions of men, but through the rudiments of the world, through the
paedagogie and childish elements of the ceremonial law these being as
pernicious and dangerous as the other.

Moses being part of the written word of God should be dangerous.

I answe e, Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit
ye nothing. It is a speech full of power, wherein the Apostle sets his
authority given him by Jesus Christ, against the authority of all that teach
the contrary, whosoever they be. Behold I Paul who am an Apostle, and have
authority to publish the Gospel, say unto you, whosoever says to the
contrary, if ye be circumcised, if ye think circumcision of necessary use
with faith in Christ, in the matter of justification, (for that is the argument
there handled by the Apostle) I tell you Christ shall profit you nothing, you
shall have no benefit nor comfort by his death, passion, resurrection or any
thing he has done; a plain proof of this, that the Law of ceremonies given
by Moses, is hurtful and pernicious, when things there prescribed are urged,
as things of necessary use to salvation together with faith in Christ.

And the reason Holy things of God even things of diu^ne institution being
extended beyond their right use become pernicious.
and hurtful, yea means to carry us away, as a pray from Christ to
everlasting destruction; thus the Sacraments which God has ordained to be
signs and seals of his covenant of grace, if they be reached out as they are
by the Papists to further use as to be Physical causes of grace to be things
that contain and give grace to the receivers by the very act and work of
receiving they become dangerous things, and in stead of ministering comfort they
become means to make Christ the fountain of all comfort unprofitable unto us.

I might yet further insist in the fruits and works of the spirit, as prayer,
Almes-deedes and such like, yea faith it self extended further then to be an
instrument apprehending Gods mercy, and the merit of Christ to justification,
to be a meritorious and deserving cause of justification and salvation becomes
dangerous and deadly, and this is carefully to be observed of us, for it is a
subtilty of the Devil, when he cannot make men lightly to esteem the holy
things of God, Note.
and to use them for fashion or custom, then to be tempering with them on the
other hand to make them to extend them to further use then God has appointed,
thus he dealt with Christ our head in his temptations, as appears Matthew. 4. by
conference of the third and sixth verses, when he could not weaken his faith
in the providence of God, and make him distrust, then he labored with him to
extend his trust in the act of it too far, even to presume on the providence
of God, and to neglect the means, thus no doubt he will be dealing with the
members of Christ, we must therefore labor to know and discern the right use
of all holy things of God and to take heed that the Devil or his instruments
prevail not with us to extend them beyond the same for so doing we do not only
abuse the holy things themselves, and make them unprofitable unto us, but they
become means to spoil us, to draw us from Christ and make his death and
bloudshedding, his resurrection, his victory over sin, death, and the Devil,
utterly void unto us, and yielding no profit nor comfort unto us at all. We are
further to mark, that the Apostle calls the legal doctrine of Moses rudiments
or elements, or the a b c, of the law, and that in respect of the more full and
perfect doctrine afterward revealed in time of the Gospel, hence we may take
out this conclusion.

That the teaching under the Law was nothing so The teaching under the law was
nothing so excellent as the teaching under the Gospel.
they that lived in time of the Law were but as young scholars in some petty
school, we that now live under the new testament, are as students of some
famous university, we by the teaching of the Gospel are led forward to more
excellent learning, and more is revealed to us, then to them that lived in time
of the old testament, and this is clear by many places of Scripture, we find
it to be one maine difference between the Law and the Gospel, that the
Gospel is a far more excellent and glorious light then the Law, 2. Corinthians.
3. from the sixth verse to the end, the Apostle does prefer the excellency of
the teaching of the Gospel, before the doctrine of the Law in many respects.

But happily some will object and say this seems not true for Abraham and the
Prophets had more revealed unto them, then the best of us,

To this I answer it is true indeed, Abraham with some one now or heretofore
living since the coming of Christ. Abraham is not a child in respect of such
an one, but if we compare church with Church, the Christian Church under the
new testament with the Church of the Jews under the Law, we shall find that
the Christian Church does far exceed the Jews in respect of revelation and
excellent knowledge, hence it is that our Savior says, Luke 10.24. that many
kings and Prophets desired to see the things manifested by his coming and saw
them not, and the Apostle, 1. Pet, 1.11.12. says, that the Prophets enquired
and searched, when or what time the spirit which testified before of Christ,
which was in them should declare the sufferings that should come unto Christ,
and the glory that should follow, unto whom it was revealed, that not unto, etc.

This then remains a true conclusion, that the teaching under the Law was not
so excellent as the teaching under the Gospel, they that lived in time of the
law were but as petties and young Scholars in respect of us that live under
the Gospel. Now then is the teaching under the Gospel more excellent then the
teaching under the Law? is more now revealed to us by the Gospel then to the
fathers of the old testament in time of the Law? then certainly our knowledge
must be answerable, Our knowledge of the mysteries of the Gospel must exceed
theirs that lived in time of the old testament.
the rule is general, to whom much is committed, of him much shall be required
according to the means vouchsafed, so shall be our account returned, ignorance
now in the clear light of the Gospel is a most heavy and fearful sin, it
might in some sort excuse them that lived under the Law, but now it is
inexcusable, now it leaves men void of excuse, ignorant persons have now
nothing to plead for themselves, and that the ugly shape of this sin may
further appear unto us, consider we that ignorance now in time of the
Gospel, it is an argument of hardness of heart, we know that a thing that is
often exposed, and set before the bright shining of the sun, and neither
changed nor mollified is of a stony nature, so surely such as live in the
bright beams of the Gospel; and are neither bettered nor mollified by them,
are of a most stony temper, yea ignorance now does not only argue this
hardness, but it is more then a probable sign of everlasting perdition, so
says the Apostle, 2. Corinthians. 4.3. If the Gospel be hid if the glorious
light of the Gospel do not enlighten us, but we continue ignorant of it, it
seals up a fearful conclusion against us, that we are such as are appointed
to everlasting destruction, especially if we be wilfully ignorant as many
are, who in respect of time and means might have been teachers as the author
to the Hebrews says, cap. 5.12. and yet had need to be taught the first
principles of christian religion, they are behind the Jews they know not their
letters the rudiments and first principles of the word of God, and can they
look to be saved? certainly no, continuing in that state they cannot, their
state is worse then theirs of Sodom and Gomorrha, it is the sentence of Christ
himself, Matthew 10.15. Let it then stir them up to use all good means to
come out of their blindness and ignorance, yea let such of us as have the
greatest measure of knowledge learn in respect of the clear light of the
Gospel to bewail the remnants of ignorance that be in us and be careful
daily more and more to increase in knowledge, that we may be answerable to our
means and condition.

Come we to the last words of this verse (and not after Christ.)

These words are apposed to the three means of seducement before specified as
a general refutation of them all, and the meaning is briefly this.

That they are not according to the doctrine of Christ in the Gospel, the
point of instruction that arises hence This ought to prevail with us to
renounce every corruption both of life and doctrine that is not according to the
doctrine of the Gospel.


That it ought ever to be a probable and sufficient reason to sway with us
against any corruption either of life or doctrine, that it is not after Christ,
and that it is not according to the doctrine of the Gospel, Ephesians. 4.20. the
Apostle does use this as a special argument against the corruptions and
manners of the Gentiles to dissuade the Ephesians now converted not to follow
their fashions he says that they had not so learned Christ meaning that such
things were not suitable to the doctrine of Christ, and therefore to be avoided,
and this manner of reasoning we are to use.

When Satan tempts us to any corruption and sin we are to use this kind of
reasoning.
we are to think and say with our selves, surely this is not according to
Christ, and if we have truly learned Christ, it will be a notable means to
avoid it, and especially this manner of reasoning is to be used in time of
some grievous conflict of conscience, when the conscience wrestleth with
despair, when the law accuses, terrifieth and threatens the wrath of God,
then will the Devil set Christ before us as an angry judge, saying unto us on
this manner, this thou ought to have done, and thou have not done it, know
therefore that I will take vengeance on thee, we are then to remember that this
is not according to the doctrine of the Gospel. Christ does not speak there
on this manner to poor afflicted consciences, he adds not affliction to the
afflicted, he breaks not a bruised reed, but unto poor afflicted
consciences, laboring under the burden of sin, and Christ himself in the
Gospel speaks most lovingly and comfortably, and says, Come unto me all ye
that are weary and laden, and I will ease you, Matthew 11.28. Be of good
comfort my son, thy sins be forgiven thee. Matthew 9.2. be not afraid, I
have overcome the world, John 16.33. we are therefore thus to reason in time of
conflict of conscience, and if we be able thus to do, it will be a notable
comfort and refreshing unto us in the greatest conflict that can be.

VER. 9. For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
This verse depends on the former as a reason to prove that Philosophy, the
traditions of men, the rudiments of the world, and all other things are mere
deceit and vanity, and altogether needless in the matter of salvation, and
that all things needful to salvation are to be found in Christ, the reason is
taken from the sufficiency and perfection of Christ, that in him is all
perfection and sufficiency to salvation to be found, therefore all other
things are needless, now this sufficiency and perfection found in Christ is
propounded in this verse, and applied to the Colossians in the next, and it is
not barely propounded in this verse, but laid down in the proof of it, and
that from the condition of the person of Christ, that Christ is both perfect
God and perfect man, united into one person, and therefore most perfect and all
sufficient to salvation, that is the respect that these words have to the
former and the sum of them (in him) that is, in Christ (the Godhead) (that
is) the very divine essence and nature, Interpretation.
not only the grace of God, but the very God of grace himself, the Apostle
adds further the fullness of the godhead, thereby signifying the full and
perfect Godhead, the perfect substance, nature, and essence of the godhead, and
yet further he says (all) his meaning in that enlargement is this, that the
whole perfect essence of the Godhead is in Christ not only perfect wisdom,
perfect power, perfect justice, perfect mercy, etc. but that the perfection and
fullness of all these together, and of every essential property of the godhead
is in him, yea that the same whole glory and majesty of the godhead that is in
God the Father is in Jesus Christ his son (dwells) (that is) abides and
continues united for ever, the Apostle speaking in the present time signifies
a continual residence and abode (bodily) this word bodily is here used after
the Greek phrase, the phrase of the Grecians, who use to put (...) that
signifies a body, to signify not only a thing that has a true being, as a
body has but a person, and we in our English tongue use the word (body) for a
person, as some body, or no body, we use to say for some person, or no person;
the meaning then of the Apostle in saying (bodily is essentially and personally
united to his manhood, that there is a true union of the godhead and manhood in
Christ, that they are made one person, and so the essence of the Godhead in
Christ, being in it self incorporeall, is after a sort by personal union
become corporate, they are the words of the holy Ghost, John 1.14. the word
was made flesh, the eternal word the son of God, the second person in
Trinity was incarnate and made man, thus then are we to understand this
sentence of the Apostle, as if he had said.

For in Christ the whole most perfect essence and substance of the Godhead
abides for ever, united truly and personally to his manhood, so as God and
man in Christ make one person. In this verse thus laid open and conceived are
found most excellent points of doctrine, and before I come to speak of the
particular things contained in it, we are briefly to observe and mark the
argument of the Apostle, whereby he proves that al sufficiency to salvation is
found in Christ, and no where else taken from the fullness of the Godhead
dwelling in him, for thus reasons the Apostle, Christ is true and perfect God
as well as man, and therefore a perfect mediator, and all sufficiency to
salvation

That the ground of all sufficiency in Christ, is his godhead, The ground of al
sufficiency in Christ is his godhead.
the godhead of Christ is that which makes him a most sufficient redeemer and
Savior, for indeed, hence it is that his blood is so precious, that the
shedding of it is satisfactory and meritorious, able by the merit of it to
purge, cleanse, and wash us from sin as Saint John says, 1. John. 1.7. the
blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin; we are to mark
his speech, he says, the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God is that which
cleanses us from all sin, and hence it is even from the Godhead that the
flesh of Christ though it profit nothing in it self, yet by virtue which it
receaueth from the Godhead to which it is joined by personal union it is the
bread of life, and a quickening flesh, John 6.58. yea hence it is that Christ
his righteousness, his perfect fulfilling of the Law is available for
righteousness, to every true believer, because he is God as well as man, and
so not bound to fulfill the Law for himself, but of his own accord he became
the end and perfection of the Law, and fulfilled it for righteousness to every
one that believes. Romans 10.4. this doctrine is to be thought upon.

And for the use of it, Strength against the reasoning of the flesh touching
the sufficiency of the death and suffering of Christ.
his death and suffering, for our own corrupt reason will teach us to argue
against the sufficiency of Christ, his death after this manner; Christ his
suffering was but for a time, and we by our sins deserve eternal death and
punishment in hell for ever, how then can Christ his temporary suffering answer
and satisfy for our deserved eternal punishment, between that which is
finite, in respect of time and that which is infinite in continuance, between
temporary and endless, there is no proportion? for answering of this cavil of
the flesh; the doctrine now delivered may help us, and we are to remember it,
in the hour of temptation, we may have need to remember it, therefore let us
think on it now before the trial come, that the ground of all sufficiency in
Christ is his Godhead, and therefore we are not esteem the merit of his death
by the time of his sufferings but by the person who suffered, that Christ who
suffered was both God and man, united in one person, and by virtue of his
godhead gave power to his death to be meritorious, and of infinite price and
value, and hence the Church is said to be purchased with the blood of God. Act.
20.28. and 1. Cor. 2 8. that the Lord of glory was crucified; the meaning of
those places is not, that God suffered or shed blood he being impassible, and
having no blood to shed, but they do note out unto us the infinite merit and
sufficiency of Christ his death in respect of his godhead, that the person
suffering being not a mere man but God and man, his death was made infinitely
sufficient and effectual by virtue of his Godhead personally united to his
manhood, and so was a sufficient satisfaction for the sins of the whole
world, and so I come to the particular things offered unto us in this verse,
and first we are hence to take knowledge of the perfect deity and godhead of
Christ, in that the Apostle says, all fullness of the godhead dwells in him.

Christ is true God of the some most glorious essence and substance with the
Father, and he is God of himself.
and he is God of himself, equal to his Father, and this is clear by many
places of Scripture, that one is an excellent place to this purpose,
Philippians 2.6. Where the Apostle says that Christ Jesus being in the form
of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God: that is being in the glory
and majesty of God, before his incarnation, he knew it to be no violence,
injury or usurpation to be equal with God, for he was (in deed and truth) God
of himself and of equal majesty and glory with his Father from all eternity.
I might further prove this by many reasons as by the prophetical predictions
of Gods Prophets, spoken only of the Lord of hosts, and applied by the Apostles
to Christ; by the works of God truly imputed to Christ, as to make the world,
that he is true God of himself, equal to his Father, if it were needful; but
come we to make use of this point, and first this being a truth grounded on
the word of God, it may not only settle us against many erroneous opinions
which I will not now remember; The doctrine of our church cleared from an
imputation which the papists cast upon it.
from a most vile and slanderous imputation cast upon it by the Papists, they
stick not to charge the doctrine of our Church to be faulty in no less then
the highest degree of Atheism, because we teach this very point.

That Christ is God of himself, and that he received not his Godhead from his
Father. Against this, one in a popish pamphlet cries out and says, upon this
position it follows that there is neither father nor son in the godhead, and
why so? mark his reason, for says he, according to the common sense (see)
common sense is the ground he builds upon in so high a mystery, he only is a
true natural son, that by generation does receive his nature and substance
from his Father, if therefore the second person in Trinity did not receive the
godhead from the first, but had it of himself as the Protestants do affirm,
than certainly he is no true son of the first, and consequently the first
person is no true Father, and thus says he, they overthrow both Father and Son
in the Trinity, and are found faulty in the highest degree of Atheism; a foul
fault indeed, if it were justly charged upon us, but to clear us from this
blot and to answer him. First, it seems this cauilling Sophister cannot or
will not distinguish between Christ's godhead and his person, for we teach that
Christ his godhead is of it self, Note.
that Christ in regard of his godhead is of himself, as well as the Father,
but that his person or sonship (as I may so speak) is from the Father as
Christ is the second person in trinity, and the eternal son, so is he from
the Father, that is our doctrine, and so the popish argument is not to the
purpose.

Again, this cauillers argument stands only on sense, and reason, not on the
word of God, and I answer further unto him, that the strict urging of the
natural generation of man, as a pattern of the spiritual and unspeakable
generation of the son of God is most absurd, for it will make the son a
distinct God from the father, yea, it will make Christ an inferior God to God
his father, because the father shall have his Godhead of himself, and the son
not of himself but of his father, which things are in no wise to be granted we
are to renounce them as utterly false, and to hold it for a truth grounded on
the word of God, that Christ is true God, yea, God of himself equal to his
father.

A ground of sweet comfort to all true believers.
it is a truth full of sweet comfort to as many as truly believe in Christ.

And the consideration of this is, that Christ is true God may minister to
them, not only this comfort, that they are made one with him by faith, who is
the ever springing fountain of all comfort, who is able to save and deliver
them from death and damnation, from the Devil and all the enemies of their
salvation, which is a great comfort but it may raise up their hearts with
further comfort as (namely) this that they are one with him, who is most
willing to save them, yea, that will be sure to confer and bestow upon them
righteousness and life everlasting, for why? they are one with him who is true
God, in whom is all fulness and perfection not only of power, but of mercy and
goodness, favor and loving kindness; who is not only most powerful but most
gracious and ready to do them good, and will never suffer them to perish, and
this is Christ his own argument of comfort and of assurance that none of his
shall perish, nor the power of hell ever prevail against them, that he and
his father are one. In the two verses before he says, I will give unto them
eternal life, Ioh. 10.30.28. ver.
etc. then follows the ground of all, ver. 30. I and my father are one, as if
he had said; I and my father are one in substance, will, power etc. therefore
none shall pluck my sheep out of my hand, none shall be able to take them out
of my fathers hand.

in him, and need not any thing out of him, as a complement of their
justification and salvation.

For why, they are perfectly justified by Christ, they have full and perfect
remission of their sins, so as there is no condemnation to them, Romans 8.1.
and they are made the righteousness of God in him, 2. Corin. 5.21. therefore
they need nothing out of Christ to their justification.

Again, all the works of meditation wrought by Christ are most absolute and
perfect, and need nothing to be added and adjoined, as a supplement unto them
to make them perfect, for Christ being God and man is a most perfect Savior,
and therefore he does perfectly justify and save all that truly believe in
him, the holy Ghost says, Heb. 7.25. he is able perfectly to save them that
come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercission for them.

Where then is any place for humane merits and satisfactions, surely, there is
no place left unto them, Confutation of humane merits and satisfactions.
any where but in Christ* in him we have full and perfect remission; the
masses, pilgrimages and other works of penance which the Papists hold able to
satisfy, do mightiy derogate from the one full, perfect and sufficient
sacrifice of Christ once offered upon the cross, Heb. 10.14. with one
offering has he consecrated or (as the word is) perfected for ever them that
are sanctified that sentence is worthy to be duly considered our meditations
are to dwell upon it; with one offering has he consecrated, and that for ever;
How we may be kept from abusing that doctrine that in Christ we have perfect
justification and salvation.
no need then is there of any thing at any time out of Christ, and again
consider that the perfect satisfaction made by one offering of Christ belongs
to them that are sanctified, that is also to be considered and marked of us to
keep us from abusing this doctrine, that true believers need nothing to their
justification and salvation out of Christ for our corruption will be ready to
abuse this doctrine and teach us to think thus with our selves, is nothing
needful to our justification and salvation out of Christ, then a sanctified
holy life is needless, we must take knowledge from this worthy sentence of the
holy Ghost; that this is a foolish and deceiving kind of reasoning, it is all
one as if thus we should reason, nothing is needful to justification and
salvation out of Christ, and therefore we will not have Christ himself, for
such as are not sanctified, have not Christ, they have no part in the merit of
his death and passion.

Note.
And further take we knowledge of this, that howsoever a sanctified life is not
needful to salvation in respect of any merit, yet is is needful in respect of
assurance of salvation, and in regard of the degree of glory in heaven: the
greater our sanctification is, the greater shall be our glory in heaven,
therefore learn we to hold the truth of the doctrine now delivered with the
right use of it, let us content our selves with Christ alone, with his
obedience, as most sufficient to our justification and salvation, even
despising in respect of him all other merits and satisfactions whatsoever, yet
so as we ever remember to whom the merit of his death and perfect obedience
belongs (namely) to them that are sanctified, and that sanctified life is
needful in respect of assurance of salvation, and regard of the degree of
glory in heaven.

The next thing we are to mark is this, the Apostle says, ye are complete in
him, he says not, ye are made complete or made perfect from him, but in him;
hence arises this conclusion.

The perfection of true believers in this life is in Christ.
it is not wrought by Christ in themselves, the perfection by which we are
perfectly just in this life, is out of our selves in Christ, it is not any
perfection infused and powered into us, but a perfection in Christ, even his
perfect righteousness inherent and abiding in him, and not powered into us, is
our perfection in the sight of God in this life, 2. Cor. 5.21. the Apostle
says directly, we are made the righteousness of God in Christ, Ephesians. 1.6. he
says, God by his grace made us accepted or freely beloved, not through any
perfection wrought in us, or righteousness powered into us by that grace, but
altogether out of our selves in his beloved, Phillip. 9.3. the Apostle says,
he accounted all things but loss and dung, that he might be found in him,
and then he expounds himself in the words following, not having his own
righteousness, but that perfect righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith;
these places make it clear, that the perfection by which we are perfectly just
in this life is out of our selves in Christ, and the reason of it is this.

Because even the best so long as they are in this life have the corruption of
sin remaining in them,

This may serve first to strengthen us against the erroneous Strength against a
f^lse position of the Papists.
who teach that a certain limited portion (for so they speak) of justice or
rigteousnesse, is derived out of Christ his infinite righteousness, and powered
into this or that man, and so he is made perfectly just by that righteousness
inherent in himself; a doctrine directly contrary to the truth now delivered,
and such as has no ground nor footing in the word of God, they are never able
to show it out of the word of God, that any portion of Christ his infinite
justice is infused into us, and inherently made ours, that is a mere device of
their own brain.

Secondly, this doctrine makes much for the comfort of all true believers,
Comfort to al true believers
for why? is it so that our perfection in this life is not in our selves, but
out of our selves in Christ, this then may minister singular comfort to all
such as truly believe in Christ, if we look into our selves, and be able to
search our selves, we shall find a world of imperfections in us, imperfect
knowledge, yea, more ignorance then knowledge, imperfect faith mingled with much
unbelief, weak and feeble hope etc. yea, nothing in our selves if we be not
partial in our selves, but cause of doubtting, distrust and utter despair,
but on the other side, when we remember that perfection is not to be sought for
in our selves, but in Christ, and if we truly believe in Christ, that even in
this life amidst our manifold imperfections, we have fullness and perfection
of righteousness in him, and that in him we are complete and perfect, it will
raise up our hearts with excellent comfort, yea, it will enlarge our hearts
with this comfort, further, that our perfection being in Christ it can never
be lost, Note.
we shall be as sure as Christ is in heaven, to find perfect righteousness
to our justification and salvation, for our perfection is laid up in Christ,
who is now in heaven at the right hand of his father, and therefore nothing can
take our perfection out of his hands: it is the Apostles argument Romans 8, 34.
it is Christ which is dead, yea, or rather, which is risen again. who is also
at the right hand of God, and makes request also for us; who therefore shall
condemn says the Apostle, so may every true believer truly say, my
perfection is laid up in Christ, who is at the right hand of his father, who
therefore shall take it from me, not all the power of hell is able to deprive
me of it, and that is an excellent comfor, and to be thought on to the comfort
of all that truly

Now from the words following, which is the head, and observe we only this,
that we are to consider Christ even whole Christ God and man in respect of the
Angels as a Lord over them and far above them, Whole Christ God and man is
Lord over the Angels and far above them.
the Apostle speaking of the advancement of Christ, Ephesians. 1.21. says, God
raised him from the dead, and set him at his right hand in the heavenly places
far above all principality, and power, and might, and domination, and every
name that is named, not in this world only, but also in that, that is to come,
Heb. 1.4. the holy Ghost says, Christ made is much more excellent then the
Angels, inasmuch as he has obtained a more excellent name then they.

And first in this respect, we are to be stricken with We are to be st^icken
with due admiration of the Majesty and glory of Christ.
has been the cause of giving too much unto them, even divine worship and
adoration: of that point we shall speak hereafter, but in that Christ is
Lord and Governor of the Angels, it may be matter of great comfort to all that
truly believe in him, and of terror to all unbelieving It is matter of
comfort to the godly and of terror to the wicked that Christ is Lo^d of the
Angels.


Of comfort to all true believers, because Christ their head is also head of
the good Angels, and will be sure to send them out to minister unto them for
their good, for their protection and comfort at all times, as we have it Heb.
1.14. they are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for their sakes,
which shall be heirs of salvation, yea, Comfort.
they have a charge laid on them by Christ, to watch over thee, and to keep
thee in all thy ways if thou belong to him, yea, to keep and protect thee (if
it be good for thee) from common dangers and calamities that be in the world,
a matter of great comfort to all true believers, on the contrary, Terror.
it may strike unbelievers with terror that Christ is the Lord of the good
Angels, and has them at command to execute vengeance upon them, we read in the
Scripture, that the Angels destroyed Sodom, plagued the Egyptians, and slew
in one night, an hundred foure-score and five thousand in Senacheribs host, 2.
King. 19.35. how then ought men to tremble and to stand in awe of Jesus Christ
the Lord of these glorious and powerful creatures and as the Psalmist says,
Psalm. 2.12. kiss the son least he be angry, and so they perish and be utterly
destroyed, for certainly, if men do not in time make peace with this great
Lord of Angels, he will one day, as the Apostle says, 2 Thessalonians. 1.7. show
himself from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendering vengeance
unto them that do not know God, and obey not his Gospel, let this be thought
on by all hard hearted and unrepentant sinners.

VER. 11. In whom also ye are circumcised with circumcision made without hands,
by putting off the sinful body of the flesh, through the circumcision of
Christ.
This verse is an anticipation or prevention of a secret objection. For the
Colssioans might say, you tell us that we are complete in Christ, but there
be some teachers that say, we Gentiles wanting circumcision are unclean, and
therefore not perfect in Christ, this the Apostle meets withal in this verse,
and says, that in Christ they also were circumcised: and in this verse the
Apostle begins to reason against the third means of corruption used by
seducers spoken of verse the 6. (namely) the rudiments of the world, the legal
doctrine touching circumcision sacrifices and ceremonies among the Jews, and
he begins in particular to deal against circumcision showing that the
believing Colossians needed not to be outwardly circumcised in the flesh, as a
complement or means to add any thing to their perfection in Christ; his
reason is this.

You are by the power of Christ inwardly circumcised, therefore you need not
outward circumcion in the flesh. That is the sum and substance of this verse,
and so stands the Apostles reason against outward circumcision.

Now before I come to speak more particularly of this verse, a doubt must be
removed, some may take exception against the Apostles argument, as
insufficient, and say, it is not to the purpose and question in hand, and not
continuing in the terms of the question.

For the question between the Apostle and false teachers was, Ob.
whether circumcision in the flesh were necessary or no, the Apostle says no,
it is not necessary, his reason is, because they were inwardly circumcised. Now
may some say, this is not to the purpose, this proves not outward circumcision
to be therefore needless, because they were inwardly circumcised; if this be a
sufficient argument against outward circumcision; then this also is a good
argument against outward baptism, that such as are inwardly washed by the holy
Ghost, need not outward baptism, but we see that to be contrary by the
practice of Peter, who commanded that Cornelius his family and others met
together, being inwardly baptized by the holy Ghost, should be also baptized
with water in the name of the Lord Jesus, therefore this seems to be no sound
and sufficient argument used by the Apostle.

Ye are inwardly circumcised, and therefore need not outward circumcision. For
the remouall of this doubt, Messiah to come, and a seal of righteousness and
regeneration, but in the time of the new Testament, the Messiah being come, the
Apostles argument is strong and sufficient because then circumcision with the
whole regiment of Moses is abolished, and the instance of baptism is not to
the purpose, because there is now this difference between outward circumcision,
and outward baptism, the one is abolished and removed by the coming of
Christ, and the other stands in force, by the institution and commandment of
Jesus Christ, therefore these two reasons are not alike. Yea are inwardly
circumcised, and therefore need not outward circumcision; that is a good
argument, and ye are inwardly baptized, and therefore need not outward
baptism, that is insufficient, and to come some short use of this before we
pass from it; Luke 19.14.
who will not have him to reign over thee, and that punishment threatened ver.
27. shall one day light on thee, those mine enemies which would not that I
should reign over them, bring them hither and slay them before me, the Lord
will cut thee off, and give thee thy portion with hypocrites.

Come we now to speak of this verse more particularly, we may observe it in
these things laid before us.

First, that in Christ the believing Colossians were circumcised, In whom also
ye are circumcised.

Secondly, the manner of their circumcision; with circumcision made without
hands.

Thirdly, what it was (namely) a putting off the sinful body of the flesh.

And lastly, by what means it was wrought and how they were in Christ
citcumcised (namely) through his circumcision; through the circumcision of
Christ, of these in order. In whom also ye are circumcised with circumcision
made without hands: for the right conceiving of these words, we must know that
circumcision among the Jews was a cutting off of the foreskinne of the flesh
as appears in the institution of it, Interpretation.
Genesis 17.10.11. and that cutting off the foreskinne was among them a Sacrament
answerable to our Sacrament of Baptism, a sign of Gods covenant of grace, as
the Lord there says, and a seal of righteousness, Romans 4.11.
as the Apostle says now as in our Sacrament of baptism, there is the outward
washing of water, and the inward washing of the spirit in them that are truly
baptized, so was there among the Jews an outward circumcision in the flesh a
cutting off of the foreskin of the flesh, and an inward circumcision of the
heart, a cutting off of the foreskin of the heart by the spirit of God; thus
then we are to understand the Apostle when he says, in whom also ye are
circumcised with circumcision made without hands as if he had thus spoken. In
Christ also ye believing Colossians have the foreskinne cut off as well as the
Jews, I mean the inward foreskinne of your hearts, which is not cut off by
the hand of man, but by the finger of God, even by the spirit of God.

Now first in that the Apostle says; the believing Colossians who were not
outwardly circumcised, were notwithstanding inwardly circumcised, and that they
in Christ had the effect of circumcision without the outward sign of
circumcision: Hence we may gather this conclusion.

Gods grace is not tied to the outward sig^e of the Sacrament.
grace signified by circumcision, may be had without circumcision in the
flesh-as appears plainly by these words of the Apostle, grace is not tied to
the outward sign or sacrament.

Ob.
But to prevent an objection in the beginning, some may say indeed, grace
signified by circumcision, may now be had without circumcision, because the
outward sign is not now in force, but in time of the old Testament it could
not be had without circumcision, for the Lord says, Genesis 17.14, the
uncircumcised manchilde in whose flesh the foreskinne is not circumcised, even
that person shall be cut off from his people, etc. and consequently grace
cannot now be had without the outward signs of grace: Therefore grace is tied
to the Sacrament.



Again, for the place alleged; I answer, that place is to be understood of
such as were of years and discretion, and not of infants, for it is not said,
the uncircumcised person being an infant, but indefinitely the uncircumcised,
and there is reason so to understand it from the text it self, for the Lord
says in the last words of the verse, because he has broken my covenant; now
to break Gods covenant is not incident to infants but to men of years, we see
then grace to salvation, even in the time of the old Testament, when
circumcision was in force, might be had without that outward sign, if there
were no wilful neglect or contempt of it; and consequently, grace is not tied,
either then or now to the outward sign or Sacrament of grace, the words of
David after the death of the child that died before the eight day, 2. Sam.
12.23. are to be considered, I shall go to it, says David, without question,
he meant not that the child was not in hell, or in any Limbus infantum as the
Papists dream, but he comforted himself by conceived hope it was with the
Lord, and thither himself should go. Remember again, the thief on the
cross that repented and was converted, Christ says to him, Luke 23.43. this
day shall thou be with me in Paradise, yet he wanted the outward sacrament of
baptism.

This I deliver to this purpose, Comfort against fear and doubting of the
salvation of children dying before they be baptized.
and doubting of the salvation of children taken away before they can come to
baptism; there is sometimes a scruple and doubt striking in the minds of some
touching children, that die without the outward sacrament of baptism, we must
learn to cast out that scruple and know that God is not worse to us under the
Gospel, then he was to them under the law, nor less able to save the seed of
the faithful, now without baptism then he was then without circumcision; his
grace was not then free and now bound, then great and now little, then strong
and now weak, we are not so to imagine, it were a wrong, yea, a blasphemy
against the infinite mercy of our gracious God and the God of thy seed, not
adding any condition of baptism if it cannot be had as it ought.

Oh but there is one speech of Christ himself, Ob.
that happily strikes deep, and it is objected by the Papists Ioh. 3.5. to
prove an absolute necessity of outward baptism our Savior says there,
except a man be borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of God; behold say they, a plain proof that outward baptism is
absolutely necessary to salvation.

I answer, first it can never be proved by sound reason, that, that place is
to be understood of infants, but rather of men of years, for if we mark it,
Nicodemus his question verse. 4. was this, how can a man that is old be borne;
can he enter into his mothers womb again, and be borne? our Savior answers
(holding (no doubt) to the terms of that question) verily, verily, except a
man grown in years in whom there is either wilful neglect, or contempt of
baptism be borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter etc. And again,
it is no more necessary, that by water in this place, we should understand
material water, then by the word fire, Mat. 3.11. we should understand
material fire: but rather, by water we are to understand the office and work
of the holy Ghost (namely) spiritual washing, as if our Savior had said,
except a man be borne of the spiritual washing of the holy Ghost, and this is
agreeable to that which follows ver. 6. that which is borne of the spirit is
spirit, and ver. 8. so is every one that is borne of the spirit, where we
find no mention of water; it remains then notwithstanding this speech of
Christ that outward baptism is not of absolute necessity to salvation,
therefore let us not fear the salvation of infants departed this life in
regard of the want of outward baptism; but look we with comfort to the
covenant God has made with the faithful, that he will be their God, and the
God of their seed.

We are further to mark that the Apostle sets out the inward circumcision of
the Colossians, in these terms, circumcision made without hands, hence we may
take up this conclusion.

The inward circumcision of the heart is not a work of man's hand but of the
powerful hand of God.
and taking away the corruption of it, is not a work of the hand of man, but
it is a work of the finger of God, and only wrought by the powerful hand of
God; hence it is that Moses says, Deu. 30.6. the Lord thy God will circumcise
thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou may love the Lord thy God
with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou may live, the reason
of this is.

Because inward circumcision of the heart, David prayed, Psalm. 51.10. create in
me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me; therefore proper
only to the hand of God; Now least we stumble and be not able to keep our
selves from falling in respect of precepts given in scripture to circumcise our
own hearts, to change them, and the like, Ierem. 4.4. be circumcised to the
Lord; Note.
we must know that all such precepts given in Scripture to men since the fall
of Adam and in his corrupt state do not signify and imply any power in man to
perform them, but teach us our duty, that we are to seek for help, where it
is to be had even at the hands of God, and let that be the first use of this
point.

That seeing circumcision of the heart, is a work only We are to seek and sue
to the Lord that he would circumcise our hearts.
and pluck off the foreskinne of our hearts, and take away the corruption of
them.

And again, if the Lord have in any measure circumcised The whole praise and
glory of our conversion must be given to the Lord.
let us give him the whole praise and glory of that work, look not too much
on the outward instrument; do not too much gaze upon the excellency of the
gifts of any that has been a means of thy conversion, least so thou give
part of the glory to the instrument, but ever have thine eye upon the mighty
power of the Lord whose only work it has been, remember that Paul or
Apollos, are but the ministers of God, by whom thou have been brought to
believe, 1. Cor. 3.5. bless God for them, but give him alone all the praise,
and all the glory of that great work.

Now come we to the words following, By putting off the sinful body of the
flesh through the circumcision of Christ.

Wherein the Apostle sets down what is the inward circumcision, namely, a
putting of the sinful body of the flesh (by putting of) these words are
often used by the Apostle in the like matter that is here handled, as cap. 3.
9. seeing ye have put off the old man with his works; Interpretation.
Ephesians. 4.22. that ye cast off concerning the conversation in time past, the
old man which is corrupt through the deceivable lusts, and they are
metphoricall, borrowed and taken from vncloathing of the body, or the stripping
off of the apparel, and do signify the manner of taking away, and abolishing
of the inward corruption of the heart, that it is after the manner of
incloathing the body, or rather indeed of putting off the skin of the body,
the heart and inward parts and powers of the soul being enwrapped and
encompassed with corruption as with a filthy garment or leprous skin
(sinful body) the word body does not here signify any corporeal
substance, consisting of flesh, blood and bones, but is also a word used by way
of similitude: to signify the massy lump of corruption, and that lump of
corruption is expressed by this word (body) to signfie the greatness and
extension of it, that it is as a body having all dimensions, height, length,
breadth and thickness, and as having all the parts of a foul monstrous and
reformed body, in which are found all sins bound up it were in one body,
which break out as any occasion is offered, hence it is that the Apostle
calls diverse foul sins breaking out of this body, our member, cap. 3.5. by
sinful body, then understand we, the sinful mass or lump of corruption
(of the flesh) by the word (flesh) we are to understand the corruption of
nature, even of the whole nature of man of all the powers and abilities both of
soul and body, for it is frequent and usual in Scripture to put the word
(flesh) for the corruption of nature; and not only to signify the corruption
of the inferior parts of the soul, as the affections, appetite and senses,
but also of the superior, even of the reasonable soul, and of the powers
thereof, the mind, will, memory and conscience, To. 8.7. the wisdom of the
flesh (that is) the wisdom of the mind, for that is the seat of wisdom, in
the natural and corrupt state of it is enimity against God; and the reason why
the corruption of the whole nature of man is called flesh, is this, because it
comes by propagation, by natural and carnal generation, and that that is
borne of the flesh is flesh. Ioh. 3.6. so then the full sense and meaning of
the Apostle in these words, by putting off the sinful body of the flesh, is
this.

By taking away and stripping off, as it were a leaprous filthy garment or
skin, the sinful mass, lump and body of the natural corruption of the
whole man, even of all the powers and abilities of soul and body.

Here first observe we that the Apostle sets out the inward circumcision of
the heart in these terms, that it is a putting off, an vncloathing or a
stripping off of the filthy leaprous garment of corruption; hence we are taught.

That the spirit of God inwardly circumcising and regenerating Regeneration
does not abolish any faculty of the soul or any natural affection of it, but
only takes away the corruption of them.
does not take away the substance of the heart, but the corruption of it,
regeneration is not an abolishing or taking away of any faculty of the soul,
as understanding, memory, will, conscience or any natural affection of the
soul, but only a stripping of the filthiness and corruption of them; for
why, natural corruption is not a substantial thing as some have thought, nor
a corruption of the substance of the soul, for then could not the soul be
immortal, if the substance of it were corrupted, nor Christ have taken man's
nature without sin, but it is a corruption cleaving and clinging to the
faculties of the soul, and to the affections of the heart, and such as may be
removed by the powerful work of Gods spirit, and hence is it said to be an
evil that does compass ^s about Heb. 12.1. cast away every thing that
presse^h down, and the sin that hange^h so fast on, or that does so easily
compass us about, so the original word signifies therefore regeneration is
not an abolishing of any faculty of the soul, but a putting off of that
filthiness, and that corruption that does enwrappe and compass about every
faculty of it, this I note in a word, it may be unto us one ground of trial,
Trial of the soundness and truth of our regeneration.
or of any affection of the heart, but of the corruption of it, hereby then
examine thy self, no doubt thou art or may be acquainted with the
disposition of thine own heart, (I say not with the depth, and all the devices
of it, the heart of man is deceitful and wicked above all things, who can know
it? Ierem. 17.9. only the searcher of the heart, the Lord he knows it, but
with a little observation thou may be acquainted with the natural
inclination and disposition of thine heart, in regard of the predominant and
chief ruling affections of it, whether it be naturally given most of all to
fear, to love, to joy, to sorrow, to anger or the like; well then, knowing the
chief ruling affection of thine own heart, see whether that affection still
remain in thee in the force and strength of it without the corruption of it, if
it do, then thou art truly regenerate, but if it do not, thou do but
flatter and deceive thy self, for example, if thou be one given to too much
joy, and much rejoicing, thou art one of a merry and cheerful disposition,
see whether thy joy and thy rejoicing be still as great and strong as ever it
was, not in sin and in outward carnal things, for that is the sinnefulnesse
of it, but in God and in good things, if thou find that thou can now rejoice,
not in filthy carnal pleasure in drunkenness or good fellowship, as it is
called, nor so much rejoice in the outward blessings of this life, but that
thou can as heartily rejoice as ever thou could, yea, thou can more
heartily rejoice in the love and mercy of God in Jesus Christ, in his service
and obedience to his will, for his love and goodness, then in any other thing,
that is a sure mark of a good and regenerate heart, and that the spirit of God
has wrought powerfully in thee, and stripped off the sinnefulnesse and
corruption of thy joy and cheerfulness in thee by nature; So if thou be one
of a hot hasty and choleric nature; if thou find that natural anger of thine
stripped off; the sinnefulnesse of it (namely) the rashness, the easines to be
provoked upon every trifling occasion, the excess in the measure, making thee
to forget duty both to God and man, and the expressing of it, for mere private
causes concerning thine own person, and not the cause of God; (for these are
the filthy rags wherewith thy natural anger is clothed) if thou find not
that affection it self abolished, but these things taken from it, and that
thine anger is now stirred up, upon weighty and manifest offense to God
conceived with deliberation; kindled through desire to maintain Gods glory;
love of justice and virtue, and directed against sin, and not the person of
the sinner, but with love to his person, and sorrow for the sin, and with
moderation, not making thee unfit for duties to God and man, then is that
affection wrought upon by the spirit of God, then is thine anger a holy, just
and sanctified anger, and thus may thou try thy self in other affections,
and remember it, that regeneration is not a taking away of any affection of the
heart, but a stripping off of the corruption of it.

We are in the next plac to mark that the Apostle says, inward circumcision
is a putting off, or a taking away of the body of the flesh, not some part, but
of the whole body True regeneration is a remoouall of corruption from all the
powers and faculties of the soul.


That true regenaration is entire, it is an abolishing of the whole mass and
lump of natural corruption (that is) of natural corruption in all the powers
and faculties of the soul, not a remoouing of corruption from the mind alone,
or will alone, but from all and every faculty of the soul, hence it is in
other terms expressed to be a putting off the old man, giving us to
vnderstanst that it is an entire work, even as the putting out of a perfect
man, with all the parts and members of a perfect man, for indeed where the
spirit of God, does work upon any man to the purging and taking away of his
natural corruption,

None ought to think himself truly regenerate unless he find himself
throughout wrought upon by the Spirit of God.
he puts off the whole body of corruption, let no man then deceive himself,
let no man think he is truly regenerat, because happily he is enlightened and
has a general ffooting knowledge of the Mysteries of the Gospel, and yet
notwithstanding is carried away with some inordinate affection, or some corrupt
lust to pride, to covetousness, to drunkenness, to sensual pleasure, to
someone gross sin or other, if this be true regeneration then Herod and
Judas were truly regenerate, Herod knew much, and did many good things, yet
was he a mere carnal man, possessed with inordinate love of his brothers
wife. Judas a disciple of Christ and no question, Christ taught him, and he
taught others many good things, yet was he a carnal man, carried away with the
inordinate lust of covetousness, and therefore deceive not thy self think not
that the Spirit of God has wrought on thee to thy regeneration, unless thou
find that he has put off the the whole body of thy corruption, and have
crucified the flesh withal the inordinate affections and lusts of it, and
withal remember, that except thou be truly regenerate thou have no part nor
portion in Gods Kingdom, that is, Christ his own speech, Ioh. 3.5.

Now here a question may be moved (namely) this.

How far forth the whole body of corruption is put off and taken away in
them that are truly regenerate?

To this I answer, Saul toward David for a time, 1. Sam. 24.17. but shortly
after his hatred brake out again, and he purposed to kill him, and thus does
the Spirit of God, eithet restrain or turn the affections of the heart
another way in the unregenerate only for a time, but afterward it breaks out
and shows it self again, but in the regenerate, the Spirit of God does take
away the power of natural corruption, so as at no time it bears sway in them,
but they hate it, and labor and groan for deliverance from it, and though
sometimes it give them a blow and a wound, yet is it with much reluctation and
striving against it, as the Apostle says of himself Romans 7.15. and after that
they recover themselves by speedy repentance.

Now further in that the Apostle does express the corruption of nature under
this word (body) signifying that it is as a body, having as it were all
dimensions of a body, Hence we are taught.

The corruption of nature is as it were a massy and substantial body and it
has a real being, and is exceeding great.
no shadow, but as it were a massy and substantial body, it is not as some
have taught, only a privation, an absence or want of that holiness and
righteousness that ought to be in us, but it is more, even a positive thing,
such a thing as has a real being, it is both a guiltiness in respect of
Adams sin, for in Adam all sinned Romans 5.12. and it is an inclination or
pronenesse of all the faculties of the soul, to that which is evil and
against the Law of God, the understanding is not only blind, but carried to
error and vain imaginations the will is not only nilling, or not willing
that which is good, but auerse and repugnant, and striving against it, and
willing only that which is evil continually, it is said, Genesis 6.5. the Lord
saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and why? all the
imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually, and
that the greatness of the corruption of nature may yet further appear,
consider we the diffusion and spreading of it, it is as a leprosy spread over
all the powers of the soul, there is not one free spot in the soul, but all
and every one is defiled with it, hence it is called the old man, giving to
understand that the natural man is nothing, but as a man made of corruption,
it is even as the man himself, and do not natural and carnal men demonstrate
and prove this, abridge them of their lusts, and they think they are no men
they had rather die then be abridged of the^, and hence is it also called the
law of the members, Romans 7.23. because all the powers of the soul and parts of
the body are subject to it as to a Law.

Again, consider we the comprehension of it, it contains, all sins in it
as a root, or as an Ocean sea, sending out into every channel and vain of the
body streams and floods of sin, so as one says well, if all the heresies that
be were ceased in the world, yet if God leave a man to himself, he has in
himself sufficient matter and spawne to breed and revive all kind of errors
and sin, the Apostle Gal. 5.19.20. having reckoned up many works of the
flesh, is forced to conclude and say. ver. 21. and such like, as being not able
to think of all the sins, that do as fire sparkle out of that furnace.

Last of all; the greatness of the corruption of nature may plainly appear
in that it takes occasion by the commandment of God, to break out and to show
it self as the Apostle says, Romans 7.8. sin (meaning the corruption of
nature) took occasion by the commandment and wrought in me all manner of
concupiscence; and again ver. 13. this sin that it might appear sin (that
is) exceeding great, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin
might be out of measure sinful by the commandment; it is herein like the
gangrene or elephantiasis the leprosy, it is made worse by that which should
be a means to cure it, it breaks out upon the commandment of God, if then we
duly consider the spreading, the comprehension and swelling of our natural
corruption it breaking out upon the commandment of God, which is given as a
remedy against it, we must needs confess it to be exceeding great.

Now then this being so, that our natural corruption is so exceeding great, it
being not only a want of that holiness, that ought to be in us, but a
pronenesse to all evil spread over all the powers of the soul containing the
seed of all sins, and breaking out upon the commandment of God: We are not
to think it a small matter to be in our natural condition as many foolishly
do.
and a light and trifling thing to be in his natural condition; some there be
who please themselves and hold themselves in very good case, because they are
no drunkards, no whoremongers, or the like; they cannot justly be charged with
any gross offense: yea, some stick not to bolt out this, or the like foolish
speech, that Preachers should lay before men only their open gross sins,
and deal only against drunkenness, whoredom, and such like sins: a speech
tasting of a filthy vessel whence it comes; yea, sent out (be it spoken with
reverence) from a very dunghill of filthiness and corruption: thou that thus
speak, whosoever thou art, thou have yet a rotten and a filthy stinking
heart, this argues thou do not know and conceive the corruption of thine
own nature, nor the stain and danger of it: thou art yet in bondage to thine
own corruption, and a vassaile and slave to the Devil, therefore think upon
it; and surely, such as think they are in a good case only because they are
no drunkards, no whooremongers, or the like; they see not the inward sin of
their hearts, and their corruption of nature, for they may be so by restraining
grace, and yet lie wallowing in the puddle of their own filthiness, and for a
man to think himself in good case, only because he is free from the act of
some palpable sins; it is all one as if a Traitor to his Prince, should
think himself free from danger of Law and execution, because he cannot justly
be charged with petty pilfring or stealing, for it is not only actual
transgression of Gods Law, but even our natural corruption, and that chiefly:
it being the mother sin, and the seed of all other sins that does sever us
from Gods favor, and make us stand subject to Gods curse and everlasting
perdition. Let us then labor to see the greatness of our natural guilt and
corruption, and to see our selves under Gods wrath in regard of it, and seeing
it, bewail and lament for it above all things; yea, whenever we make
confession to God of any known actual sin, we are then to be brought to the
sight of that sin, even to see with sorrow the root of it, and all our other
sins, and to cry out with Paul, Romans 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who
shall deliver me from the body of this death. And with David, Psalm. 51.5.
Behold I was borne in inquity, and in sin has my mother conceived me. For
confession of some known sin may be forced out from self-love, fear of
shame, punishment, or such like, and unless by that sin we be brought
down to the root of all our sins, Note.
and to have sense and sorrow for that also, we shall never find ease or
relief by Christ, he came not to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance, Matthew. 9.13. and not every sinner, but that sinner that condemns
sin in himself, and especially the mother sin, and is weary and laden and
groans under the burden of it. Mat. 11.28.

In that the Apostle calls the corruption of the whole (Flesh) he would have
us to know that the corruption of nature comes by propagation, The corruption
of nature comes by propagation.
it comes not as Pelagius and his followers taught by imitation, children have
not a want of holiness that ought to be in them, and a pronenesse to sin in
all the powers of their souls by imitation, but it is conuaid unto them from
their parents by natural generation, as we are plainly taught, Genesis 5.3. It
is there said, that Adam after his fall begat Sheth in his own likeness (that
is) corrupted like to himself. For as Job speaks Chap. 14.1. Who can bring a
clean thing out of filthiness, it is not possible. Hence we are said to be
children of wrath by nature, or nativity, even so borne, Ephesians. 2.3. And most
plainly speaks David to this purpose Psalm. 51.5. I was borne in iniquity,
and in sin has my mother conceived me; and if we desire further evidence and
proof of this, consider we but this one thing, that many times some particular
and inward evil quality of the parents is found in the child in his infancy
before he can learn it by imitation, and therefore it is conuaid and
transmitted from the parent to the child by generation, Note.
I say many times, not always, for it pleases God sometimes of his goodness
to stay the course of a particular evil quality and disposition, that it pass
not from the Parent to the child, as he did in the birth of Hezekiah the son
of a most wicked Father King Ahaz, and of Josiah son of wicked Amon: but
original corruption common to the stock, and common to mankind, is ever
conuaid from the parents to the child by the propagation of it, is perpetual
by natural generation.

And this must teach us to take heed of Pride and swelling We must take heed
of pride and swelling in respect of parentage.
men commonly look at the worthiness of their parents, and boast much of the
dignity and eminency of their ancestors in respect of their blood, riches,
honor, and such like; but if they look as they ought, they should find
matter enough to humble them, they shall find that their father was an
Amorite, etc. as the Prophet speaks Ezekiel. 16.3. and that they are in the
common condition of all men, polluted in their blood; and though they receive
from their parents outward glory and honor, yet withal they receive such an
hereditary common corruption and disease, yea it may be, together with that,
such particular infection as makes them odious in the sight of God; and if the
course of it be not stayed, it will poison their bodies and

Again, is it so that natural corruption comes by propagation, then let this
stir up all parents to labor to estate and entitle their children in
something, that may be for the good of their souls Parents must labor to
estate their children in something that may be for the good of their souls
that their children descending of them, may be entitled to some thing that
may be for their good.

How is that to be done may some say?

Answ. Let them labor to bring themselves within the covenant of grace and to
become true believing members of Christ, and then though they cannot derive
their faith and holiness unto them, because they begette them not as good men
and believers, but as men simply by the power and strength of nature, yet by
virtue of the covenant, God will be good and gracious to their children, Genesis
26. We read many blessings promised to Isaac and why? Verse. 5. Because Abraham
his father obeyed the voice of the Lord, and kept his Ordinances and
Commandments, his Statutes and Laws. Teaching plainly that the holiness of
parents seals up the Lords favor not only to themselves, but to their
children also: this cannot raking and scraping together of wealth do; men use
to say, happy is the child whose father goes to the Devil, a wicked saying;
it is rather a comfort to children when they can remember their parents, are,
or have been godly and in the favor of God, for he loving the stock will not
disregard the branches; they may say as Jacob said, Genesis 32.9. Thou have been,
or art, the God of my Father, good and gracious to him, show then mercy to me
his seed, according to thy sweet promise. Yea, God is good even to wicked
children of good parents. Genesis 36.7. Esau had riches and outward good things.
1. King. 11.32. When the Lord rent the Kingdom from Solomon for his sin, yet
one Tribe was left for David's sake. A notable inducement to make Parents to
become godly; and if we desire that God should be good to our children after
us, let us labor to bring our selves within the covenant, and we shall find
that an effectual means to move God to mercy toward our children for many
generations.

Come we to the last words (through the circumcision of Christ) in these words
is expressed the means how the believing Colossians were in Christ circumcised
(viz.) through, or by the circumcision of Christ, in this place we are not to
understand the passive circumcision, that whereby Christ himself was
circumcised, but the active, that whereby we in him are circumcised and
regenerated by his spirit, and we may note and observe a difference between
Justification and Regeneration or Sanctification, the Apostle speaking of
justification in the Verse before, says, We have perfection of righteousness
in Christ, in him we are complete, not adding any thing further, that that
perfection is wrought in us by Christ: but here speaking of regeneration and
sanctification, he says that in Christ also we are regenerate, and he
expounds his own meaning, how (namely) through the circumcision of There is a
manif^st diff^re^ce between justification and sanctification.
The Papists confound these two, in teaching justification by holiness
inherent: and I note this to teach us to take heed of so confounding of them;
and know we that justification is by righteousness inherent in Christ
apprehended by faith, We must take heed we confound them not.
but in part, and shall be made perfect in the life to come.

VER. 12. In that ye are buried with him through Baptism, in whom ye are
also raised up together through the faith of the operation of God which raised
him from the dead.
In this verse the Apostle meets with a secret exception that might be made
against his speech in the former verse, on this manner; some might say, though
outward circumcision, the cutting away of the foreskin of the flesh be not now
needful for the believing Colossians, that being proper to the time of the
old Testament, yet they have need of an outward sign and sacrament,
signifying and sealing up unto them their inward and spiritual circumcision:
this exception the Apostle preuents in this verse, showing that the Colossians
had an outward sign and seal of their inward circumcision (namely) baptism
which by Christ his institution succeeded circumcision, and that in stead of
being circumcised, they were baptized, and so had the outward sign with the
thing signified.

Now the Apostle does not rest in expressing the outward sign of baptism, but
by way of further explication and declaration of the inward circumcision, and
abolishing of the corruption of the believing Colossians, he sets it out,
together with the inward things signified by baptism, and whereof through
baptism they were made partakers, as,

First that, through Baptism was signified and sealed In that ye are buried
with him through Baptism, and

Secondly that though Baptism was signified and sealed up unto them, and they
made partakers of Christ his resurrection in these words: In whom ye are olso
raised up together.

And then follows the inward means by which their faith through the faith.

Which faith is further described by the efficient cause

And that power and operation of God is further specified

Come we to the particular examination of the words words. In that ye are
buried with him through Baptism; for the understanding of these words, two
questions are to be answered.

Interpretation.
First, what it is to be buried with Christ.

Secondly, how through Baptism we are buried with

Answer to the 1.
For the First, to be buried with Christ, is to have fellowship and communion
with Christ in his burial, to partake with Christ; both in the merit of his
burial, whereby he has changed the nature of the grave, and taken away the
horror of it, and turned it from an house of perdition, to a place of sweet
repose, and to partake with Christ in the power of his burial to bury sin
and natural corruption in us.

Answer to the 2.
For the second question I answer, that we are buried with Christ through
Baptism two ways.

First in sign and Sacrament only, for the dipping of the party baptized in
the water, and abiding under the water for a time, does represent and seal
unto us the burial of Christ, and his abiding in the grave, and of this all
are partakers sacramentally.

Secondly, we are buried with Christ through Baptism, not only in sign and
sacrament, but in deed, and truth, when by the working of his spirit we are
baptized into Christ, and really engrafted into him; for being really and truly
made one with Christ, we are made partakers of the merit and power of his
death, burial and resurrection, and all his benefits, as the Apostle plainly
teaches, Romans 6.34.5.6. Know ye not that all we which have been baptized
into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death? We are buried then with
him by Baptism into his death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead
by the glory of the father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For
if we be grafted with him to the similitude of his death, even so shall we
be to the similitude of his resurrection, knowing this that our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
we should not serve sin, etc. where he shows that such as are baptized not
only in sign and sacrament, but truly baptized into Christ, are baptized
into his death, burial and resurrection, and so are partakers of the merit and
power of his death, burial and resurrection, by the answer to these two
questions, we may come to conceive the meaning of the Apostle in these words
to be this, as if he had said, in that ye through Baptism being truly
engrafted into Christ, and made one with him, are partakers of the merit and
power of his death and burial, (for his burial presupposes his death and the
Apostle is so to be understood) to kill and bury sin and natural corruption
in you. Now these words being thus understood, the words following are after
the same manner to be expounded, only reading for (in whom) in which with
reference to Baptism, as the original will bear it, and it is more agreeable
to the context. In which Baptism, and the words so read, the meaning of them
is plain by the former exposition, as if the Apostle had said, in which
baptism you being truly ingrafted into Christ, are partakers of the merit and
power of Christ his resurrection, and by that power are raised up to newness
of life.

Now here observe that the Apostle by way of prevention Baptism succeeds in
the room of circumcision by the institution of Christ.
makes known that the Colossians had an outward sign and seal of their
inward and spiritual circumcision (namely) baptism, that in stead of being
circumcised they were baptized. Hence briefly note we that baptism succeedes
in the room of circumcision, and that circumcision being now abolished,
Testament, there is no reason why Baptism succeeding it should not be
administered to them in time of the gospel, unless we say that the condition
of the infants of Christians in time of the new Testament, is worse then of the
children of the Jews, in time of the old; and that by the coming of Christ,
the grace of God is more obscure, and not so ample and large, or less
testified to us then it was to them which lived under the law, which to say
were to cast reproach and contumely on Jesus Christ, and far be that ftom us.
For concluding the next point we are to mark that the Apostle speaks here in
the time present; Ye are buried with him, etc. Hence we may take up this
conclusion.

Baptism is effectual throughout the whole life in such as are truly baptized.
it is effectual to the taking away of sin in all times of life, it seals
up the washing away of all sins in all times of life, past, present, and to
come. Hence it is that the Apostle Peter, 1. Epist. 3.21. speaking of those who
were before baptized, says Baptism which now saves us and our Savior Christ
himself extends baptism in the force and efficacy of it, as well to the time
to come as to the time past, Mar. 16.16. He that shall believe and be baptized
shall be saved, the reasons of this.

That baptism is effectual to the taking away of sin in all times of life
are these two.

put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me, therefore the
force and efficacy of baptism is not limited to any time, but is of force so
long as the covenant is of force.

Secondly, baptism is the sacrament of incision of ingrafting

This for the use of it may discover the error of the Confutation of the popish
sacrament of penance.
a doctrine directly opposite to that which I have now delivered and proved,
and such a devise as destroies the true use and nature of Baptism, yea such as
is full of much discomfort we are to renounce it.

For a second use consider we the comfort of the truth Comfort to all that
find themselves inwardli baptized.
(namely) such as are careful to perform that part of the covenant made
between God and them, that belongs to them (that is) to repent of their
sins, and to believe in Christ, to them it is full of heavenly comfort. For
why? is baptism effectual to seal up the washing away of all sins in all
times of life? then in all times of trouble and distress: especially in time
of trouble and affliction of mind and conscience have recourse and go with
speed to thy Baptism, there thou shall find comfort, thou shall find that
God has therein sealed up unto thee his love and favor, and his everlasting
covenant of grace, and has promised to be thy God for ever, and he will not
fail of his promise. Men use often to look on deeds and wills, and such
like writings, that they may be resolved in matters of doubt: Look then often
on the Will of thy heavenly Father, sealed and delivered to thee in thy
Baptism, and thou shall be better resolved in the midst of thy greatest
doubts; thou shall there find that thou being once entered into covenant with
God, no evil in thee can drive God from his promise, but that he will surely
perform it, and be thy God for ever, even good and gracious unto thee, in the
forgiveness of all thy sins, yea, that in thy Baptism was sealed up unto thee
the pardon of all thy sins, even of that sin that happily now troubles thy
mind and conscience, and that is a matter of singular comfort, and often to be
thought on by all such as are truly baptized, and let none but such take hold
of this comfort, to them only it belongs, from these words

Such as are truly and inwardly baptized are partakers of the merit and power
of Christ his death, burial and resurrection.
That as many as are truly and inwardly baptized, are by baptism made
partakers of the merit, and power of Christ his death, burial and
resurrection, the Apostle says; through Baptism they were buried with Christ,
etc. and further proof of this we heard before out of Rom: 6.3.4.5.6. etc.
together with the ground of it (namely) our union with Christ that we being
made one with Christ, have communion and fellowship with him in his death,
burial and resurrection, and hereby first we may see the wickedness of that
Popish distinction, Confutation of a Popish distinction.
that baptism sanctification, without strength to fight against spiritual
enemies, and as though when we have comfort from baptism against terrors and
temptations, we are not strengthened and encouraged to fight against them, it
is a most absurd and foolish distinction, I leave them, and for the use of this
doctrine to our selves.

Is it so that such as are inwardly baptized, are by their Trial, whether we
be inwardly baptized or no.
made partakers of the merit and power of Christ his death, burial and
resurrection; then let us hereby examine our selves, if we find our selves
dead and buried with Christ, we are inwardly baptized, but if it be
otherwise, we are not; and that we may know when we are dead and buried with
Christ, remember we the condition of such as are dead and buried, they neither
see nor hear, they have no sense nor feeling of any thing; How we may know
that we are dead and buried wlth Christ.
if it be thus with us in respect of sin, when the Devil, and our own
corruption do allure us to sin; if we be not moved to it, but are as men
dead in regard of it; we are then through baptism dead and buried with
Christ: but if when we are moved to sin, we have hearts ready to yield unto
it: for example, when we are tickled, with the lust of uncleanness, if our
hearts be ready to consent, and our bodies to execute the same; if when we
are provoked by injury our hearts be presently enflamed with anger, our tongues
ready to shoot out bitter words; we are not yet through Baptism partakers of
the power of Christ his death and burial, and consequently we can have no
comfort by our baptism, and let us know it for a truth, that without inward
Baptism we have no part in Christ, outward baptism without the inward is but
the mark of a fool that makes a vow, and afterward breaks it, as says the
Preacher, Eccles. 5.3.

Let me now add one thing to this point, by way of further use and application
of it (namely) this, it being so that as many as are truly baptized, are by
baptism made partakers of the merit and power of Christ his death, burial
and resurrection, and we are hereby to examine our selves, let us further know
that we are often to examine our selves upon every occasion, we are to look
We are often to try whether we be inwardly baptized or no, and essentially
when the sacrament of Baptism is administered in our sight.
the administration of that Sacrament must be a visible Sermon to put us in
mind of this duty, even then are we to enter into our own hearts, and to
examine our selves, it is therefore a great fault in such as depart and go
away from the public assembly (having no urgent extraordinary occasion) when
the Sacrament of Baptism comes to be administered, as it is a bewitching, and
an enchantment of Satan to hold such as have Jesus Christ in lively manner
described in their sight, and crucified before them, in the preaching of the
word and administration of the sacraments, to hold them from yielding obedience
to the truth, Reproof of such as depart and go from the assembly when the
Sacament of Baptism is administered.
as the Apostle says, Gal. 5.1. so doubtless it is a subtlety and sleight of
the Devil, as much as possibly he can to keep men from seeing Christ
crucified before them. From seeing the death of Christ in lively manner set
before them, either in the preaching of the word; or administration of the
Sacraments; and to this end he labors to fasten upon their minds this
conceit, that Baptism only concerns the little children that are to be
baptized, and some few others, and nothing at all belongs to them but that they
may depart the congregation at their pleasure, and without question he has
poisoned the minds of many with this pleasing conceit, and it is very needful
that this cunning working of Satan should be discovered unto us, and we put
in mind of this fault, that we may learn to reform it, and to this end know
we.

That Baptism is a public work of the whole congregation, and every one of
us has a part in that work, in witnessing the work done by the the Minister,
in approving the same by one consent of the spirit of grace, by consenting in
prayer and thanksgiving, yea the whole body of the congregation ought with
knowledge of Gods covenant, and joy of a member to be added to the church, to
address themselves to that work; yea every one of us ought particularly to
take profit by it, as often as we see it administered, we are to call to mind
our own Baptism, and see whether the Lord has been powerful through that
to kill, and bury sin in us, and to raise us up to newness of life or no,
and to remember the vow every one of us made in Baptism, this is our duty, and
these excellent uses ought we to make of that holy Sacrament, whenever we
see it administered; therefore let no man think it a matter arbitrary and
indifferent, that he may either stay or go away at the time of the
administration of it: no, no it is our duty to attend it, and it is of
excellent and profitable use to every one of us, and it is the subtlety of
Satan to make us lightly regard it.

I pass on to further matter from these words of the Apostle, buried with him
through Baptism, etc. there is yet offered one thing more to be considered of
us, and that of excellent use.

Hence we are further taught, that such as are engrafted Such as are ingrafted
into Christ through Baptism, are so nearely conjoined with him, as that the
things done by Christ as Mediator, they did with him as the members of his body.
Hence it is that the Apostle, 1. Corinthians 12.12. (which is worthy to be
observed of us) gives the name of Christ to all true believers in Christ, he
styles them jointly together being one mystical body by the name and title of
Christ, so is Christ (that is) the Church of Christ; and he gives the reason of
it in the verse following, because by one spirit they are all baptized into one
body, whether Jews or Grecians, bond or free, and have been all made to
drink into one spirit, and they are made one body, under one and the same
head Christ Jesus; and hence it is that the Apostle, Gal. 2.19. says he was
crucified with Christ, and in the third Chapter of this Epistle, Verse 1. If
ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, as if he
had said, if ye be made one with Christ, and as members of Christ be risen up
with him, seek those things which are above, where Christ fitteth at the right
hand of God: by all which places and many others that might be brought it is
very clear, that so near is the union and conjunction of Christ and his true
members ingrafted into him through Baptism, that what Christ did as mediator,
they did with him, when he died they died with him, when he was buried they
were buried with him, when he rose again from death to life, they were raised
with him.

First, this may serve as a ground of excellent comfort Comfort to all such ar
are truly ingrafted into Christ by Baptism.
for why? consider it, is it so that when Christ died, they that are engrafted
into him died with him, when he was buried, they were buried with him, when he
rose again, they were raised with him? what then shall disappoint them, what
then shall deprive them, of the fruit, the benefit, and the comfort of Christ
his death, burial, and resurrection; surely, not all the power of hell is able
to do it; Let the Papists say what they will, that justifying faith by which
we hold the merit of Christ his obedience, active and passive, may be
utterly lost, which they are never able to prove, yet they will never be so
shameless as to say we can be frustrated and disappointed of the fruit,
benefit and comfort of that which we have already done together with Christ,
can a member of Christ die with Christ, be buried with him, and raised up with
him, and find no benefit nor comfort by Christ his death, burial and
resurrection, he dying, being buried, and raised up for the good and comfort of
his members; it is not possible, as many as are truly ingrafted into Christ,
died with Christ when he died, were buried with Christ when he was buried,
and were raised with Christ when he was raised, and therefore cannot be
disapointed of the benefit of his death, burial, and resurrection, but shall
be sure to find the comfort in those deeds of Christ, both in life and death;
yea we being once set into Christ, and made one with Christ, our hope of heaven
is so sure and certain that we are said now to sit with him in heaven already,
they are the very words of the Apostle Ephesians. 2.6. and that is a ground of
sweet comfort for all such as find themselves engrafted into Christ through
Baptism.

Again it being so, that so near is the union between If ever we look for
comfort by Christ the ground of it must be this that we are dead, and buried,
and raised up with Christ.
for all our comfort is from our union with Christ, and as many as are truly
united with him are dead, buried, and raised up with him, and therefore if ever
we look for comfort by him, we must find our selves dead, buried, and raised
up with him: through the subtilty of Satan many deceive themselves, they think
it sufficient if they can say, Christ died for them, and they are persuaded
Christ shed his blood for them, though they never find themselves crucified,
dead, buried and raised up with Christ.

But we must know that this is not sufficient,

I answer, of his death, but we must go a step further and find our selves
crucified and dead with him.

Romans 6.6.7. When the old man (that is) our natural corruption is crucified
with Christ; as a malefactor executed cease from theft murder, and the like,
so certainly, if thou be crucified with Christ, thou shall find thy self to
cease from thy old sins. And let this be ever the ground of thy comfort in
Christ, that thou art crucified with Christ: even a wicked reprobate may fancy
to himself that the merit of Christ his death belongs to him, but can never
go thus far to find himself dead and buried with Christ: if then we would
go beyond a reprobate, one that is damned in hell. Let us not content our
selves with a bare notion that Christ died for us, but let us labor to find
our selves dead, buried, and raised up with Christ: and that only will assure
us, that we through baptism are ingrafted into Christ, and made one with him,
and that all the strength of Hell shall never be able to make a division
between Christ and us, and that will be unto us a sure ground of lasting
comfort: it follows, (through the faith of the operation of God) in these
words the Apostle sets down, as we have showed, the inward means by which
outward Baptism was effectual to the Colossians, and they made pertakers of
Christ his burial and resurrection, (namely) faith, and that is described by
the efficient cause of it, (namely) the actual working of the power of God.
For the power of God is two fold; Interpretation.
absolute, by which he is able to do more then he will; and actuall^ equal to
his will, and that power we are here to understand, and the meaning of the
words is briefly this, through faith wrought in you by the actual power of God.

Observe we hence in the last place, that Baptism is effectual it is not the
outward act of baptism that does confer and give grace without faith. The
Apostle says plainly, Baptism is effectual to seal up Gods grace only in
such as believe.
Ye are buried with Christ through Baptism, and that through Faith. Yea, the
proposition is general, that the Sacraments without faith do not actually
confer grace Ephesians. 5.26. The Apostle says, that Christ sanctifies his
Church by the washing of water, and he there stays not, but adds further
through the word, (that is) through the word of promise believed: for indeed,
the word it self is not as a physical or natural instrument containing
grace, but does only signify the good will of God to his chosen, and being
mixed with faith is profitable, and it is the power of God to salvation only
to them that believe, Romans 1.16. Therefore the Sacraments which are but the
word of God made visible, do not give grace by the outward act, but through
faith in those that rightly receive them, they are effectual to signify and
seal up the grace of God.

Use. First, this may discover unto us the error of the Discovery of the
error of the Papists touching the force and effect of the Sacraments.
who teach that the Sacraments of the new Testastament confer grace, ex opere
operato, yea, they say that the Sacrament of Baptism does it self wash away
sins by force and virtue of the work and word done, and said in the
Sacrament; and for this they allege Act. 22.16. Arise and be baptized, and
wash away thy sins in calling on the name of the Lord. Which text if it be
well observed makes directly against them; for to the Sacrament of Baptism is
here joined calling on the name of the Lord, which is a fruit of faith, and
whereunto salvation is promised, Romans 10.13. It is therefore a mere device of
their own, that Baptism or the Supper of the Lord do confer and give grace
by the very work done: we are to renounce it as an untruth and Popish error.

And for the use of the point to our selves, is it so that faith with us, When
we come to partake of the Sacrament. we must look that we bring faith with us.
the Sacrament do not work faith, but seal it up where it is wrought, and if
faith be not all ready in us, they seal up nothing but judgment unto us; yea,
we must mix the hearing of the word and prayer with faith, or else our
hearing will be unprofitable, and our prayers but lip-labor and abominable,
and hence it is that men find no comfort in the promise of the Gospel in time
of trouble, and hence also is it that men by the threatenings of Gods Law are
more hardened and the word becomes a savor of death to their deep
condemnation; labor we therefore to believe and to mix the word and Sacraments
with faith, or else the Sacrament shall be a seal of thy damnation, and the
word preached and heard by thee shall aggrauate thy judgment.

These words (though the faith of the operation of God) understood as before
they were expounded, do further afford unto us this point of instruction.

True faith by which we are knit unto Christ and have fellowshippe with him is
wrought in us by the powerful hand of God.
Therefore the Apostle here calls it the faith of the operation of God, or the
faith of Gods power; true faith is not only the mere free gift of God, Phil.
1.29. to you it is given for Christ, that not only ye should believe in him,
but also suffer for his sake, as all other graces are; but it is so wonderful
and so supernatural a gift and grace of God as it is wrought by the exceeding
greatness of his power, by the working of his almighty power: as the Apostle
says, Ephesians. 1.19. That ye may know what is the exceeding greatness of his
power toward us, which believe according to the working of his mighty power,
and the reason of it, that faith in Christ is so wonderful and so supernatural
a gift is this

Because it is not only above nature corrupted,

Let us then from hence be admonished to take heed They deceive themselves
who think they can at their own time and pleasure believe in Christ.
herein the Devil does delude many thousands of poor souls in the world;
he persuades them that either already they believe and have faith, and that
easily conceived without feeling of any working of the mighty power of God,
yea, some are so besotted and blinded by the subtilty of Satan, that they
think they have believed in Christ ever since they were borne, and never
doubted of Gods mercy; or else if this slight be discovered and be two palpable
and their eyes be opened to see it, then he persuades with them, that though
now they believe not, yet they may hereafter when they will, and that it is an
easy matter to believe in Christ, and in their own power to believe when they
list; yea, that they may take hold of the mercy of God, and merit of Christ,
at the very last hour of their life, and with this pleasing conceit he
deceiues many and draws many a poor soul down to perdition: let us
therefore learn this truth, that true faith in Christ is a wonderful work of
Gods power, and make use of it to oppose it against the subtle and cunning
slight of Satan, going about to persuade to the contrary, and that we may be
yet further resolved and settled in this truth, and armed against the subtilty
of Satan in this respect, consider we but this one thing, that if true faith
in Christ were in a man's own power, then certainly never any of them whose
hearts are pressed down with the burden of sin, and the anger of God for the
same would despair, but would take hold of Gods mercy.

Now lamentable experience shows the contrary that at such time as some are
brought to a sight of their sinn^s and a through sense and feeling of Gods anger
against them for the same, they cannot then believe in Christ, nor take hold of
Gods mercy by any means, it is the property of the cursed nature of man at
such a time, Note.
as that to blaspheme God, and to despair of Gods mercy; and therefore it is
not in man's power to believe when he list.

Look on the example of Judas, did not he, when he saw the greatness of his
sin, and Gods hand was heavy upon him, did not he in a hellish horror of
conscience and fearful desperation lay hands upon himself: if faith had been
in his own power would he have done so? certainly he would not, let then all
such as now in the security of their hearts (neither seeing, nor feeling the
weight of their sins) think that faith is in their own power, and that they
may believe in Christ when they will: consider it, that when Gods hand shall be
heavy upon them, and the Lord shall let them see the greatness of their sins,
that happily then they may seek for faith and never find it; yea, it may be
that if then one would give them ten thousand worlds, they shall not be able to
find any comfort in Christ; let them think upon it, and learn to know that
true faith in Christ, is not in a man's own power, but it is only the work of
Gods mighty power, and never rest till they find that the Lords hand has
wrought upon them, and in them the wonderful supernatural work of faith, and
that we be not deceived in this point of so great weight and consequence, our
salvation depending upon it; (for without true faith in Christ there is no hope
of salvation) let us never rest till we find such a faith wrought in us, as is
able even to break through the sense and feeling of our own sins, and Gods
anger, and to take hold on Gods mercy, and the merit of Christ for our comfort,
and then we may be sure that faith is wrought in us by the mighty and
powerful work of Gods spirit.

Again, is it so, that true faith in Christ is the work Comfort for all such
as find true faith truly wrought in them.
herein comfort themselves; for certainly faith being wrought by the power of
God, the same power shall ever preserve it from failing, and being utterly
lost what power shall be able to vanquish and ouermaster the power of God, not
all the power of heaven, earth, or hell, can be able to do it, and hence it
is, that true faith never utterly fails; this comes to pass through the
power of God, which in all true members of Christ, is a continued power,
working strength and stability in them, and never wholly interrupted, Note.
it is not any virtue or excellency in faith it self that makes it of never
failing continuance; it is changeable in it self, and nothing in it self is
unchangeable but God: but it is the power of God ever working in some measure
in the members of Christ, that makes faith not to fail; hence it is, that the
Apostle 1. Peter 1.5. says, that we being begotten to a lively hope by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, etc. are kept by faith unto
salvation: but how? by any power in faith it self. No, but by the power of
God. The words are very significant, we are kept or guarded (for so the
original word signifies) as with a strong garrison, true faith wrought in us
by the power of God, is fenced and fortified by the same power of God against
all hostility, so as no enemy of our salvation can break in upon it to
overcome it, it may be much weakened and lessened in the measure, and the Lord
may suffer it to be ecclipsed and ouershadowed with some grievous temptation;
but his power that has begotten it, will never suffer it utterly to fail: no,
the mighty power of God being the efficient working cause of faith, gives
assurance to true believers that no adversary power whatsoever can ever
prevail against their faith, though the Lord do sometimes afflict them
grievously; yet I may be bold to say, that the stroke of his own hand cannot
prevail against their faith, because he will not; for his working power is
only equal to his will, it goes not beyond it. Hence it was that Job said 13.
Chap. 15. verse. Though the Lord should kill him, yet he would believe in him;
doubtless not boasting of any strength in himself* but being assured that his
faith should ever be supported by the mighty power of God, and not by any
stroke of Gods hand: no, not by the greatest of all, death it self; be
utterly quelled and extinguished: and upon this ground may all such as have
true faith wrought in them, build their assurance that their faith shall never
fail, nor be utterly lost, because it is wrought by the mighty power of God,
and by the same power it shall ever be preserved. And let all such as find
true faith in Christ truly wrought in them, herein comfort themselves.

Come we to the last words of this verse, wherein this working power of God is
specified to be the same that raised up Christ from the dead, for that is the
meaning of the Apostle in these words, Interpretation.
(which raised him from the dead) as if he had said who by that working power
of his raised up Christ from the dead, the words are clear, and need no
further exposition; only lest we stumble at some places of Scripture which
seem not to agree with this, that God raised up Christ from the dead, in that
it is said, Christ raised up himself, John 10.18. No man takes my life from
me, but I lay it down of my self. I have power to lay it down, and have power
to take it again. Know we that the word (God) in this place is to be taken
essentially, not personally, For the whole Trinity, and not for the first
person God the Father, and the external works of the Trnity are undivided.

God the Father raised up Christ,
Christ as God raised up himself,
And God the holy Ghost raised him up:
And so there is good agreement of this place and other places of Scripture.

Now first, we are to mark that the Apostle specifying the power of God by the
effect of it, he makes choice of this effect rather then any other, the raising
of Christ from the dead; he says not through the faith of the operation of God
which created the world, but through the faith of the operation of God which
raised Christ from the dead; hence we may gather this conclusion.

That the all-sufficient mighty power of God was wonderfully The all-sufficient
and mighty power of God appeared in raising up Christ from the dead.
In the resurrection of Christ did appear the exceeding greatness of Gods
power, the Apostle does plainly avouch it, Ephesians. 1.20. What is the exceeding
greatness of his mighty power toward us which he wrought in Christ, when he
raised him from the dead. Romans 1.4. The Apostle says, Christ was declared
mightily to be the Son of God, touching the spirit of sanctification by the
resurrection from the dead.

Now the reason Act. 2.24. as he was for a time. Therefore in the loosing of
those bounds there must needs appear the greatest power that ever was, for
the strongest bonds require the mightiest power to loose them.

Now the Lord has made it known that in raising up Christ from the dead, by
it when we are in the greatest distress, either of body or mind, When we are
in the greatest distress of body or mind we are to consider if the mighty
power of God in raising up Christ from the dead as a special means to
strengthen us.
we are then to look at the power of the Lord in raising up Christ from the
dead; and to consider that the Lord thus showed forth his power in loosing the
bonds of death, when it seemed all hope was gone, and when death seemed to
triumph over Christ, and that will raise up our fainting hearts and fill them
with comfort in our greatest extremities; for indeed though the Lords power
support us in time of some great distress, otherwise we should utterly faint
and fall flat under it, yet at such a time as that we are not able, through our
infirmity and weakness, clearly to see and perceive that working power of
the Lord, we are therefore to lift up our eyes and to look at the mighty power
of the Lord appearing manifestly in raising up Christ from the dead, and
setting him at his right hand in heaven, and that will be a means to confirm
and strengthen us in our hope and dependence on God at all times: we know that
if a sick man can call to mind any one that was handled as he now is, and yet
recovering his health, it comforts him much; in like manner if we in time of
trouble and distress can but remember the example of some mere man on whom
the Lord has showed his mercy and power in his deliverance, be it Job or any
other, Iam. 5.11. the Apostle says, Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and
have known what end the Lord made, it is a notable means to comfort, and to
strengthen our hope, much more will it comfort us if we set before us the
mighty power of the Lord in raising Christ from the dead: and therefore let us
ever in time of Gods power manifested in raising Christ from the dead gives us
assurance that we shall not be left in grave.


Yea, we are thus to consider of the mighty power of the Lord in raising Christ
from the dead, that he being raised who was bound with such strong bonds of
death: surely we shall not be left in grave, the Lord raised Christ when he was
dead and laid in the grave; therefore an easy matter is it for him, when we
are dead and and laid in our g^aues to raise us, if he raised him with his
whole hand, he can and will raise us with his little finger which is an
excellent comfort to be thought on by all true believers.

Observe further, that the Apostle says, Not raised Christ descended into the
state of the dead.
he was among the dead, that as the Apostle says, Romans 14.9. he might be
Lord both of the dead, and of the quick: and the comfort of this is delivered
in the verse before. Romans 14.8. That whether we live, we live unto the Lord,
or whether we die, we die unto the Lord, True believers whether they live or
die, are still the Lords.
As many as truly believe in Christ, though they be dead, yet still they are
the Lords; yea their dead bodies are still within the covenant and still
conioined to Christ, which is a sweet comfort unto them.

VER. 13. And ye which were dead in sins, and in the uncircumcision of your
flesh, has he quickened together with him, forgiving you all your trespasses.
This verse as it has relation to the general drift of the Apostle in this
Chapter, it contains an other argument to prove all sufficiency of salvation
to be found in Christ, and nothing out of him to be needful, the argument is
this, You believing Colossians are quickened together with Christ, having in him
free remission of all your sins, therefore he is most sufficient to
salvation, you need not either circumcision or any thing else out of him.

That is, the respect of this verse, to the general purpose of the Apostle.

Now more specially it contains a further explication and declaration of their
raising up together with Christ, spoken of in the Verse before, and that in
regard of the power of Christ his resurrection in them; the Apostle therein in
this Verse sets down their raising up with Christ in another phrase and form
of speech, that they were partakers of the power of Christ his rising, to the
quickening of them, that the Lord had quickened them together with Christ, and
this their quickening is further amplified and set before them by their state
and condition, in which they were before that quickening, by their state in
which they were by nature; that they were dead, and the Apostle does further
explane himself, what manner of death he meant (namely) not a corporal, but a
spiritual death, even a death in sin, and the uncircumcision of their flesh.
And ye which were dead in sins, and in the uncircumcision of the flesh, etc.
Then follows in the last words, the ground of their quickening (namely) the
free remission of their sins, forgiving you all your trespasses.

Come we to the words as they are laid down by the Apostle, and first of
these words; And ye which were dead in sins, and in the uncircumcision of
your flesh, that we may rightly conceive these words (dead in sins) we must
know that they are not to be understood of corporal death, Interpretation.
the separation of the soul from the body, and that without repentance (as our
Savior says, John 8.21. ye shall die in your sins, that the Colossians
were so dead in their sins, but of spiritual death in sin, and there is a
double spiritual death of such as are yet living in respect of sin, a death
to sin, whereof the Apostle speaks, Romans 6, 2. How shall we that are dead to
sin, yet live therein, and a death in sin, and these two are as contrary
one to the other, as life and death; For, to be dead to sin, is to renounce
sin, and to be free from the power of sin, but to be dead in sin, is to
live under the power of it, to be so under sin as a dead man, is under death,
and so we are to understand the Apostle in this place.

And ye which were under the power and rule of sin. By the word (sins) we
are to understand actual and original sin, yet least some should think
original sin excepted, the Apostle adds further (uncircumcision of your
flesh) that they were dead in the uncircumcision of the flesh (that is) in
original sin and corruption: now this the Apostle sets down by way of
allusion, to the fore-skinne of the flesh, and calls it uncircumcision of the
flesh, because the uncircumcision of the Gentiles was a sign of their
original sin inherent in them, as the circumcision of the Jews was a sign
of the taking away of the same: this then briefly is the sense and meaning of
these words, as if the Apostle had said; You that were in the time of your
natural state and condition under the power and dominion of sin both actual
and original as a dead man is under the pow- of death.

Now first, hence it is clear, that men in their natural Men in their
natural all state are so under the power of sin, as a dead man is under the
power of death.
they are not sick of sin, or wounded by it, or half dead, but stark dead
in sin, they have neither spiritual life, nor the actions nor faculties of
that life; and that this is the condition of men in their natural state, it is
clear by other forms of speech in Scripture, setting out the state of men
before conversion; as that they are called darkness. Ephesians. 5.8. not dark or
blind, but even darkness it self, giving us to understand, that they are
nothing but darkness: Hence they are called flesh, John 3.6. not fleshly, but
flesh it self and the wisdom that is in them, is enmity against God, Rom, 8,
7. not only an enemy or contrary, but even enmity it self. Hence it is that
the Apostle, 1. Cor. 2.14. sets out the natural man, not only to be void of
actual knowledge of God, and of all good things, but void of all potentiall
knowledge of them, he cannot by any power inherent in himself come to the
knowledge of them the natural man (says he) perceives not the things of the
Spirit of God; there is his actual want of knowledge touching spiritual
things, and least some should say this comes to pass, because he does neglect
or contemn them, he never labors to know them; the Apostle adds further,
neither can he know them, let him labor never so much; there is his want of
power to know them, the reason follows, because they are spiritually
discerned, a plain evidence and proof, that a man in his natural state is so
under sin, as a dead man is under death; sin holds a natural man as fast
under the power of it; as death does a dead man under the power of it, he
cannot move his mind to think, his will to like, and affect any thing that is
good; he is as a dead man in respect of any thing that is good: the Scripture
is both plain and plentiful

Confutation of the errors of the Pelagians and of the Papists.
First, this confutes Pelagius and his followers, who hold that by the power of
nature, men might come to salvation.

Again this meets with that erroneous opinion of the Papists, who say we may
prepare our selves to receive grace: this is utterly false, if the doctrine now
delivered be true, which indeed is most true, grounded on the word of God. For
what can a dead man do to his own quickening and raising up from the grave? can
he turn himself, and make himself fit to be raised up? we know it is
not possible; take him by the hand, lift him up, yet he cannot stand, unless
a soul be put into him, no more can a natural man move himself toward
grace or any good thing, unless he have spiritual life put into him; No,
says the Papist, he may give his free consent to his own quickening; how can
that be, ad idem,

Again, whereas they say that the natural will being by grace fortified and
lifted up unto an higher degree of perfection, can then concur and work with
grace to faith and all good works necessary to life everlasting, who sees not
that they speak against themselves, for this proves not that the will of man
concurreth by it own natural power, which is the point in question, but the
clean contrary, that the will only by grace is enabled, to will that which is
good, and that is the doctrine of our Church, that the will of man in the first
act of conversion is merely passive, able to do nothing; but being revived
and quickened by the Spirit of God, and of unwilling made willing, it is then
able to choose, will, and effect that which is good. Thus we see how the
Papists entangle themselves in their own words, and fall ere they be aware
into that which is against their own doctrine, to leave them to vanish in
their own speculations, and for the use of this to our selves.

Is it so, that men in their natural state are even dead Such as be in their
natural state have no cause to be proud and to be lift up with an high
conceit of themselves
what cause then have natural men or women such as have no testimony of true
conversion, but can witness if they deal truly with themselves that they
never felt any true change in themselves, but still are the same that they have
been heretofore. What cause I say have they that are in that state, to swell
in pride, and to be lift up with an high conceit of themselves, admit they have
excellent natural parts of body and mind, as wit, capacity, judgment,
strength, beauty, and they have riches, honors, or other outward good things,
yet surely they may hence see that, if they be in their natural condition,
they are as a dead corpse that is trimmed and stuck with so many goodly
flowers: yea the consideration of their natural condition may give them just
cause in stead of bearing their heads aloft, and looking big, to droope, and
to hang down their heads; yea to shed rivers of tears, in bewailing their
misery; for all their excellent ornaments and abilities are stained and defiled
by their own filthiness as the Apostle says, Tit. 1.15. to those that are
defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, even their minds and consciences are
defiled; yea which is a further degree of misery, their good actions, such as
are good in their kind, and commanded of God, by them are defiled, they are to
them but as a stinking savor that comes from a filthy dead carrion; if this
were well considered it would pull down the pride and peacockes feathers of
many, and stir them up to use all good means to hasten out of this miserable
condition.



Discovery of the cause why the word preached is nothing profitable to some.
It being so, that men in their natural state are under sin as a dead man is
under death, no marvel then though many that are present in the congregation,
when the word is preached, have no ears to hear it with profit; sound a
trumpet in a dead man's ear, and he hears it not, so is it with natural men,
they are as dead men, and let the Preacher cry out and lift up his voice like a
trumpet, Esaias 58. they are no more moved by the word, either by the comforts
or threats of it, then the dead bodies that lie in the graves under their feet,
unless it please God to put life into them, and let as many as have ears to
hear with profit and comfort, bless God for the same, and give him the glory
of that great mercy.

The next thing we are to mark in these words is this. The Apostle speaking in
the time past ( ye which were dead in sins, etc.) signifying that the
Colossians had been so, but now were not. Hence we may gather this conclusion.

That the chosen of God such as belong to Gods election, Gods chosen before
their conversion are in the same state with the reprobate in regard of bondage
under sin.
not in regard of election and Gods purpose, for so there is a difference
between them and the wicked even before their calling, they are then beloved
of God, as such as are only known to him to be in the number of his chosen,
and afterward to be called, but before conversion in regard of bondage under
sin, they are in the same estate with the wicked, they have no more power to
think, will or affect any good thing than the wiked. Ephesians. 2.1.2.3. the Apostle
describing them in their natural condition, in the end of the third verse
says, and were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others. 1. Cor.
6.11. such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God. The
reason of this truth is plain, namely this;

Because all both elect and reprobate are borne in the same estate, Our calling
out of our natural condition is aspeciall mercy of God.
before that we lie wallowing in sin, and pleasing our selves in a course of
sin; yea, we have no mind to any thing that is good; we are in the same
state with the wicked and such as shall be damned; this then is a sweet
meditation, when we can truly call to mind, that we were sometimes in the
same state with the wicked, but now are not; yea, this is more comfortable then
to think on election or redemption by Christ; for this gives us assurance of
our election and redemption, 2. Pet. 1.10. give diligence to make your calling
and election sure: for if ye do these things; ye shall never fall; the fore
it is most sweet and comfortable when we can truly say, we were sometimes
thus or thus given over to sin; but now are not, and especially when we can
truly say, so in respect of our best pleasing sin, that we were sometimes
held under the power and tyranny of that sin, but now are not, though
strength and ability be not wanting for the practice of it, yet now we have
no pleasure in it, we strive against it, and we avoid occasions leading unto
it; if we be able to say thus, that is a comfortable thing indeed.

All that are effectually called are to b^ thankful to God for that great
mercy.
in pulling them with his mighty hand out of that miserable condition, and to
this end, let them often call to mind their former condition, and that will
stir them up to thankfulness, no doubt this is one cause, why the Lord will
have a remna^t of original corruption to remain in the most regenerate during
the time of this life, Note.
that the sense of that with grief, and desire to be loosed from it, may put
them in remembrance in what state they were before they got life in Jesus
Christ; let us therefore by this Monitor, that is lodged with us, be put in
mind of our duty: let us often call to mind our former miserable bondage under
sin, then the life we have gotten in Christ, will be sweeter, and we shall
be stirred up to be more thankful to GOD for the same.

The next thing to be considered, is the phrase and form of speech here used
by the Apostle, setting out the original corruption of the Colossians; he
calls it uncircumcision of the flesh, alluding to the foreskinne of the flesh,
from this form of speech: occasion is given to speak of the extent and
spreading of original corruption, that it is as a skin spread over the heart,
and over all the powers of the soul; but of that we have already spoken,
verse 11. only that I will observe from this phrase shall be this; In that the
Apostle calls original corruption uncircumcision It is no strange thing in
scripture to put down the name of the sign for the thing signified by it.
this manner of speaking is very frequent in the word of God; we find
circumcision called the covenant, Ge. 17.14. which was but the sign of the
covenant, and the paschall Lamb the Passover. Exodus 12.11. which was but a
sign of it; and so the bread and wine in the sacrament of the Lords Supper,
are said to be the body and blood of Christ, which are but visible signs of
his body and blood, and the reason of this is, because together with the
outward signs, the things signified are truly offered, We must take heed we
abuse not the outward signs of the Sacrament, the abuse of them is very
dangerous.
even the body and blood of Christ. And hence it is that the Apostle says, 1.
Cor. 11.27. Whosoever eats this bread, and drinks the cup of the Lord
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, not as the
Papists grossly imagine, because he eats and drinks the body and blood of
Christ really and corporally present, but because the abuse of the sign
reaches to the thing signified. We must therefore take heed, that we come not
to the Lords table irreverently, and unprepared without a measure of true
faith, and true repentance, for so doing we make our selves guilty of the body
and blood of the Lord Jesus, the abuse of the sign ever redoundeth to the
abuse of the thing signified by it

Reproof of such as wilfully absent themselves from the Lords table.
know that they put away from them the things signified by the outward elements
of it, even the blessed body and precious blood of Jesus Christ, and
consequently they put away salvation from them, let all such as carelessly and
wilfully absent themselves from the Lords table think upon it.

It follows (has he quickened together with him) In these words the Apostle
declares the raising up of the believing Colossians together with Christ, in
regard of the power of his resurrection to their quickening. I will briefly open
the sense and meaning of the word (says he) (that is) God (quickened) this
quickening is to be understood not of a raising up of their dead bodies out of
the grave, but of a vivification and quickening of them in this life,
Interpretation.
and that being twofolde, either a deliverance from standing subject to hell
and eternal death, and a donation of right to eternal life, or a Freedom
from spiritual death in sin, and working in them a spiritual life of
holiness, we are to understand it of this second, as most fitly opposed to
their death in sin, that they were freede from death in sin, and had a
spiritual life of holiness wrought in them, (together with him) that is,
together with Christ, raised from the dead, and that by virtue of his
resurrection, they believing in Christ and being one with him were partakers of
the power of his resurrection to their quickening: thus then are we to
conceive these words, as if the Apostle had said; you that were dead in sin,
has God freede from your spiritual death in sin, and wrought in you a
spiritual life and holiness by virtue of Christ his resurrection, you being
true believing members of Christ, and one with him by faith; we had these
words in substance in the verse before; I will therefore only observe one
thing from them (namely) this, hence it is clear.

That as many as truly believe in Christ are partakers As many as truly believe
in Christ are partakers of the power and virtue of his resurrection.
They being raised with Christ are pertakers not only of the merit of his
resurrection; but are also partakers of the virtue of it, they are quickened
together with him, they are freed from the power and Dominion of sin, and
have the spiritual life of grace and holiness wrought in them. And this is
that the Apostle labored for, and accounted so excellent. Phil. 3.10. The
Apostle Peter, 1. Pet. 1.3. says plainly, We are regenerate unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The Scripture is full
of proof to this purpose, consider we the reason

Let no man then deceive himself, let none of us think None truly believe in
Christ, but such as find in themselves the power of his resurrection.
that we are freed from the power of sin, and have a spiritual life wrought
in us. If we live in any known sin and lie under the power of it, as in
drunkenness, adultery, malice, or the like, we falsely persuade our selves,
we believe in Christ, and know it for a truth, that as it is said, Revel. 20.6.
He that is partaker in the first resurrection, the second death shall never
have power one him: so on the contrary, such as are not partakers of the first
resurrection, such as are not raised up from their death in sin, they shall
certainly feel and endure the second death. And let this stir us up not to
rest till we find and feel the virtue of Christ his resurrection freeing us
from the death of sin and quickening us with a new life of grace and holiness.

Comfort for such as find themselves freed from the power of sin, and quickened
by grace to a new life.
comfort themselves with assurance that they are such as do truly believe in
Christ; yea, the comfort of this is yet greater, they may hereby assure
themselves of the continuance of the Lords mercy toward them, that he will
continue to be good and merciful to them for ever, for it was of his own mere
mercy that he quickened them being dead in their sins, the Apostle shows it
plainly, Ephesians. 2.4.5. and he having vouchsafed his mercy to the quickening of
them, that mercy of his shall never forsake them, but shall be reached forth
unto them for ever; it is the Apostles argument to prove the continuance of
Gods love, Romans 5 8 9.10. As many therefore as have found the love and mercy of
God to raise them up from the death of sin, may assure themselves that the
same love and mercy shall ever be reached out unto them, that is a singular
comfort to all true believers. Come we to the last words of this verse.

Forgiving you all your trespasses. In some books we find, Forgiving us all
our trespasses.

The Apostle meaning himself, and other believing Jews, as well as the
Colossians, and other Gentiles. It is not material whether we read (you) or
(us) it comes all to one purpose.

That remission of sins is the ground of the spiritual quickening both of
Jews and Gentiles dead in sins by nature. The word translated (Forgiving)
does properly signify freely forgiving, Interpretation.
and in the original it is put down in the time past, and does signify
having freely forgiven (trespasses) that word in the original, is the same we
had in the beginning of this verse, and does signify both actual and
original sin, any aberation or declining from the Law of God; and so the
Apostles meaning in these words is briefly this.

Having freely forgiven you all your sins, both original and actual. First,
here observe we the context that the Apostle makes the forgiveness of their
sins the ground of their quickening, and so he speaks in the time past,
having forgiven us, as if he had said, You has he quickened, when he had
forgiven you your sins.

Hence note we thus much,

That forgiveness of sins is by order of nature before Forgiveness of
sins is by order of nature before spiritual life of grace and holiness
inherent.
though in time they go together, when the Lord does vouchsafe to forgive any
man his sins, at the same time he works in him a measure of grace and
holiness, yet in natural order remission of sins goes before such
spiritual life of grace and holiness inherent: For as the Apostle has
plainly taught us, Romans 8.30. Justification goes before glorification, and
under glorification he comprehends sanctification, now one part of
Justification is remission of sins;

The Lord does first discharge a man of the guiltiness of his sin, and wash
away that in the blood of Jesus Christ, and then free him from the dominion of
sin, and purge his conscience from dead works to serve the living God, as
the holy Ghost speaks, Heb. 9 14.

For use;

Surely then it is a good argument to say, I am freed from the power of my
sin.

Therefore from the guilt and punishment of my sin.



A man may certainly conclude and gather from his sanctification, the remission
of his sins; A man may certainly gather from his sanctification the remission
of his sins.
the devil will suffer any man to say his sins are forgiven, and he hopes to be
saved: but would any man prove it, and so prove it as he may settle his own
heart in assurance of it, and put the Devil to silence, that he shall not be
able to gainesay it, let him then prove it from his own quickening by grace,
and that is an holy kind of reasoning, and an argument that will never deceive
him; if any be able to say truly, whereas I was dead in sin, and to every
good work reprobate, the Lord has put into me an heavenly life, and made me
active and lively to do his will, both in my general and particular calling;
yea, it is meat and drink to me to do his will, the same party may safely
say, my sins are forgiven. Let it be thought on by such, as in any measure
find themselves truly sanctified: the next thing that offers it self to be
considered, is the word here used (forgiving) which signifies, as I have
showed, freely forgiving; whence we are taught thus much.

Forgiveness of sins is of the mere free grace and mercy of God.
that sins are forgiven. Which point is plainly taught by the Apostle not
only here, but in diverse other places, Romans 3.24. He says in express
terms we are justified freely by his grace, not only by the grace of God but
freely; giving us to understand, that our justification, whereof one part is
remission of sins, is of grace, and that of mere grace, and of nothing but
grace, Ephesians. 1.7. He says we have forgiveness of sins, according to his
rich grace, the Apostle is not content to say according to grace, but according
to his rich grace, thereby signifying not only necessary sufficiency, but even
superaboundant plenty of grace, and so excluding all other things as every way
needless; it were easy to add to these other like places, but these may
suffice; yet before we come to the use of this point a doubt must be removed.

Some may say, is forgiveness of sins free?

Ans.

Come we to the use of this: First, this meets with that Confutation of Popish
humane satisfactions for the temporal punishment of sin.
Christ, say they, has taken away the guilt of sin and the eternal
punishment of it; but men must satisfy for the temporal punishment, either
here or in purgatory. This cannot stand with the truth now delivered, that
forgiveness of sins is every way free, how can that be every way free which
we in some part merit and satissie for? it cannot be freely given and deserved,
now it is the plain text of the Apostle, that we are justified freely.

Yea, but says the Papist, (freely) does not exclude all our working and
suffering in that matter of justification; for by your own doctrine it is
necessary that we believe and bring forth new fruits?

To this they are easily answered, it is true, (freely) does not exclude faith
and the fruits of it, but it shuts out all merit of faith, and of repentance,
and other good fruits, and does plainly show, that there is nothing in us, no
not faith it self, that does merit remission of our sins, it is of grace,
and of mere free grace, they cannot possibly by any shift, avoid the evidence
of that place, I leave them and come to our selves, and for the use of the
point to our selves.

Our own unworthiness must not discou^age nor hinder us from apprehending Gods
mercy for the pardon of our sins.
remember we that pardon of sin is freely given, it is not any way deserved
by us, therefore doubt not of it in regard of thine own unworthiness, indeed
if remission of sins did depend upon any worthynesse in us, we had then great
cause to doubt of it. But it depends only on the mere free grace and mercy of
God. Let not therefore our vnworthenes discourage us, it is a sweet saying, 1.
Ioh. 1.9. often to be remembered of us, If we acknowledge our sins; God is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins. If God can be unfaithful (not if
we be unworthy) but, I say, if God can be unfaithful, which is not possible,
the^ may we doubt of the pardon of our sins humbly acknowledged: yea, mark
what comfort we may raise from that place, if we see our unworthiness, and
with broken hearts acknowledge it, God is faithful and just to forgive it, be it
never so great. I speak not this, to hearten any one in a course of sin, that
any should heap sin upon sin; because no unworthiness of ours may discourage
us: no, no, that is to savor this doctrine to death and not to life, and to
turn the grace of God into presumption; but I speak it for the comfort of
such as through weakness, either are, or hereafter may be afraid, and stand in
doubt of the pardon of their sins, in regard of their great unworthiness,
they see themselves so unworthy wretches, that they doubt whether mercy beong
to them for the pardon of their sins, or no. Let such know for their comfort,
that the Lords mercy depends not on their worthynes, it is freely given where
it pleases the Lord to bestow it; for the pardon of sins, yea let them know
further for their comfort, that they seeing and bewailing their unworthiness and
desiring pardon of their sins, they want no merit.

How so will some say?

I answer*

One thing more is to be observed from these words Such as truly believe in
Christ have full remission of all their sins.
not any one of their sins shall be laid to their charge: they are free from
the guilt and punishment of them all. This does the Apostle plainly teach.
Romans 8.1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, which
walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit: and David says. Psalm. 10.3.3.
Praise the Lord my soul and forget not all his benefits, which forgiueth all
thine iniquities and heal al thine infirmities.

The use of it serves to comfort us exceedingly, as many Comfort to all true
believers that none of their sins can hurt them
no not the most heinous amongst them, not those wherein we have continued
long, and have doubled and repeated often, not those we have done with much
boldness and presumption, we now believing in Christ have free forgiveness of
them all, not one of them excepted, which is an exceeding great comfort, let us
further follow it in our own private meditations.

We must so forgive our brethren offending us, as God forgiueth us sinning
against him.
we must then learn so to forgive our brethren, it is the Apostles rule:
Ephesians. 4.32. Forgive one another, even as God for Christ sake forgiueth you:
away then with all maimed and half forgiveness of our brethren, forgiving one
offense, and retaining an other vnforgiuen; and let us take heed in this case
of the reasoning of the flesh: as forsooth, the matter is so grievous, so
prejudicial, we could be content to be entreated to forgive many other
offenses, but this we cannot, with many other the like shifts. Let us remember
that God forgiues us all our sins be they never so great, why then should not
we forgive our brethren, if we say we deserve better of them, so does God of
us; if we meant him or her no harm, no more does God us; if we say, the party
is far our inferior, Why? what are we to the Lord, if we many times have
forgiven them, with warning to do no more so, has not God much oftener
forgiven us? Yea, times without number; learn we then to be merciful, as
our heavenly father is merciful, and know that blessed are the merciful, Iam.
2.13.
for they shall find mercy, and there shall be judgment merciless to him that
shows no mercy.

VER. 14. And putting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
which was contrary to us, he even took it out of the way, and fastened it upon
the Cross.
In this verse, as it has respect to the general drift of this Chapter.

That all things out of Christ in the matter of salvation are nothing worth.
The Apostle deals against the Legal ceremonies of of the Jews and proves
them to be superfluous; yea, pernicious in that case: his argument is this.
The handwriting of ordinances or the Legal ceremonies that was in time of the
law, Christ has put out and taken away by his death.

Therefore to revoke it, and to seek to bring it in force again, which false
teachers labor to do in urging circumcision and the ceremonies of the Law
were not only vain but pernicious and hurtful. That is the general purpose
of the Apostle in this verse.

More particularly it conteins an amplification of the benefit spoken of in
the last words of the verse foregoing (namely) the full remission of all our
sins, understanding those words both of the Jews and Gentiles believing, and
the Apostle does amplify that benefit in this verse by the means whereby we
attain it, that we are fully discharged from the guilt and punishment of all
our sins, by full satisfaction made for them by Christ.

Now that full satisfaction is not in plain terms propounded, but is laid
down in the proof of it, and was proved by an argument taken from the
disanulling or cancelling of a bill or bond which did witness our guiltiness
of sin, and by which we stood bound over to the punishment of sin, that
Christ has cancelled that bond, and therefore fully satisfied for our sins,
that is the sum and substance of this verse.

In the verse we have these particular things laid before us.

First, a description of that bill or bond which did testify

Secondly, the cancelling of that bond by Christ which is set down by certain
degrees ascending or going upward Cross, in which words is implied the means
by which Christ cancelled the bond (namely) his cross or death on the cross.



Come we to the words as they are laid down in order, and first of these
words.

And putting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against us, which was
contrary to us. Interpretation.
And putting out, or having put out the original word signifies having blotted
out, and that perfectly, so as not one letter or title remains vnblotted out
(handwriting of ordinances) by these words we are properly to understand the
law of ceremonies belonging to the Jews in time of the old Testament;
touching circumcision and diverse washings, and other ceremonies, which the
Apostle calls the law of commandments which stands inordinances, Ephesians. 2.15.
but with all (as I take it.) We are further to understand by this handwriting
of ordinances, even the whole moral law of God; because the Apostle in this
verse (no doubt) would make known the benefit of Christ his death both to
Jews and Gentiles, that it brought to all that believe in him, not only
remission of sins, but a freedom from the law, both ceremonial and moral
(which was against us, which was contrary to us) (that is) so far forth as
it did convince, accuse; and condemn us for sin, and bound us over as a bond
to the punishment of sin. washings did show they were exceedingly filthy in
the sight of God, and so guilty of the curse of the law, and so did their
sacrifices.

Thus then conceive we these words, as if the Apostle had said, And having
perfectly blotted out the law of ceremonies, which in the use of it did
convince the Jews of sin, and bind them over to death for sin, and the
whole moral Law so far forth as it did accuse, convince and condemn us of
sin.

Now from hence it i is clare that Christ has not only Christ has both paid
the debt of Gods chosen, and also cancelled the bond, witnessing their
guiltiness. Reason.
accuse them for sin, and bind them over to the punishment of sin.

The reason and ground of this is very plain (namely) this, Christ has not
only paid every jot of the principal debt of Gods chosen, but has also fully
answered the forfeiture and penalty that did lie against them, for the breach
of that bond of the law of God (namely) the curse of the law, for as the
Apostle says, Gal. 3.13. He was made even a curse for them, therefore now the
law in regard of accusation, and the curse of it, is frustrate, and of no
force, strength, nor virtue against them, it is cancelled, it is as if it had
never been, we may then safely conclude with the Apostle against our
adversaries the Papists.

That Christ has fully satisfied for the sins Gods chosen need not piece out
Christ his satisfaction for their sins by anything they can do or suffer as the
Papists teach.
We know it in common experience, that we use not to deliver up or cancel
their bond, till the whole debt be paid, and they be fully satisfied, if but
half the debt or three quarters of it be paid, and not all in such sort, as
the bond requires, men still retain the bond in full strength and virtue,
but if the bond be delivered up or cancelled, that argues full contentment,
and full satisfaction, so is it between God and his chosen. Christ their
suerty who undertook the payment of their debt to God his Father, has paid
the debt, and cancelled the bond, and therefore has fully satisfied for them;
it is most absurd and gross to think, there is any thing unsatisfied, and
any thing left for them to pay, the bond of their debt being cancelled,
especially the bond being in the hands of God, who knows whether any part of
the debt be left unpaid; and is able to keep the bond in his hands, if it
be not fully satisfied, indeed if the bond had been in men's hands, it might
happily have been gotten from them by violence or fraud, but the bond being in
the hands of God, no such thing can be feared or suspected, therefore he
delivering the bond into Christ his hands, and suffering him to cancel it, it
is a plain and invincible evidence that he is fully satisfied for the sins
of his chosen, and they need not patch or piece out that satisfaction made by
Christ, by any thing they can do or suffer, as the Papists do grossly
imagine.

Such as be in Christ are so discharged from their sins as that none can lay
any thing to their charge.
Again, this doctrine may serve exceeding much for the comfort of such as are
in Christ; for why is it so that Christ has not only satisfied for their
sins, but cancelled the bond which did witness their guiltiness, certainly
then they may safely say with the Apostle, Romans 8 33. who shall lay any thing
to our charge, who shall condemn us, they are clear and free in law, the law
cannot charge them with any thing, yea the Devil the accuser of the brethren;
Revel. 12.10. is cast down and put to silence and can lay nothing justly
against them* yea, (which is the greatest comfort of all) God himself can
bring no action against them, their surety Christ Jesus has paid their debt
and forfeyture, and cancelled the bond, wherein they stood bound to God, they
are acquitted before the judgment seat of God, even in the high Court of
Heaven; therefore it is not possible they should any where be condemned,
unless we say there is some greater then God; or an higher Court of Justice
then the judgment seat of God, which were folly and blasphemy once to think;
how then, shall not this affect the hearts of Gods chosen, and fill them with
comfort and joy unspeakable, men commonly do applaud and please themselves,
and find great contentment in this, when they can truly say they owe no man a
groat, and they are out of debt, how much more may such as are in Christ find
sweetness and comfort in this, that they are out of Gods debt, not in regard
of duty, thankfulness and obedience, but in regard of his curse and
judgments, they now are no more bound over, and liable to the curse of the
law, let as many as truly belong to Christ, meditate and think on it for their
comfort.

That I will handle in the next place shall be that which is offered from the
word (handwriting) In that the Law is called an handwriting, an obligation or
bond, and that against us we are taught thus much.

That the moral law is not only a bond of obedience, The moral Law not only
binds to the obedience of it, but to the curse also for the transgression of
it, unless there be a freedom from it by Christ.
as it is in penal statutes in the common wealth, men are not only bound to
the obedience of them, but to the penalty for the breach of the^, so is it with
us in respect of the law of God, we are not only bound to obey it but to the
penalty of it: if we disobey it and break it, it is the condition annexed to
the law, plainly propounded in the word of God: do this and live, do it not,
and die the death, break it and thou art cursed, thou art bound to the curse,
which is the penalty of the law: for cursed is every one that continues not
in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them, it is a
clear point and stands with the tenor of the justice of God, that the breach
of the law should bind men over to his curse, unless there be deliverance
from it by Christ.

The miserable condition of such as be out of Christ.
as all are who live in their sins, and will not be reformed, they are bound
by the law to the curse of God, (that is) to perpetual woe end misery both in
the time of this life, in the end of this life, and after it is ended, even to
Gods bitter wrath in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone for ever. Oh
that men who live in their sins, would think on this as they ought, if they
see not themselue^ thus miserable in regard of the curse, even therein is the
curse already upon them in blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, if they
see and know their sins as they cannot but see and know them, who have been
often convinced of them, as their drunkenness, swearing, malicious dealing,
covetousness, usury, seeking to Wizards, Sabbath breaking, and the like; if
men see these sins, and their own consciences tell them, they deserve the
eternal wrath of God for them, let them then consider thus much and remember
it that they are bound over to the curse of the law by a double, yea by a
threefold bond, they are bound By the bond of the Law. By the bond of the
Gospel, and By the bond of their own conscience to death and damnation,
And that this may be thought on with profit. Let us consider what a trouble
the remembrance of sin has been to the godly at some times. The remembrance
of sin has been very troublesome to the godly at some times.
Job said, God writ bitter things against him; and made him to possess the
iniquities of his youth, Psalm 38 3. David said he had no rest in his bones
because of his sin, and verse 8. that he roared for the very grief of his
heart; if the memory of sin be such a trouble to the godly, oh what a rack
will it be one day to him that has it in full force against him, he that
besides the bond of the law, the bond of the Gospel, has the bond of his own
conscience binding him over to death and damnation, surely when the Lord shall
let loose the cord of his conscience who is out of Christ, though it be in
the midst of his iolity, he shall find it will be as the handwriting that
Belshatzar saw, Dan. 5.6. it will change the copy of his countenance, lose his
ioints and his knees will smite one against the other, yea he shall feel the
flames of hell fire flashing upon his soul and conscience, think on this all
you that now please your selves in a course of sin.

Come we to a second use, is it so that the law is a bond Gal. 3.24. our
scholemaster to bring us to Christ; The Law ought to be our Schoolmaster to
bring us to Christ.
let the whipping and terrors of the law drive us from it self to the throne
of grace and mercy, and for encouragement, know we that the end of conviction
by the law is, that the promise of mercy may be given to them that believe as
the Apostle has taught us, Gal. 3.22. the law concludes all under sin, that
the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe,
Know then that the terrors of the law threatening the curse and perdition, must
be a preparatiue to salvation* it must drive us from the law to Christ; that
he may be our Savior: When therefore the Law does convince and accuse thee of
sin, arraigne thee at the bar of Gods judgment, and fill thy soul with
terror, appeal from it, and go to Christ, and believe in him, and that with
such a faith as is joined with hope, love, and new obedience, and the promise
of pardon and life everlasting shall certainly be given to thee.

The next thing that by order of the words we are led to consider, is the word
(Ordinances) and therein to show the abrogation of the Law of Ceremonies, but
we shall more fitly handle that, Verse. 17. The next thing, I will handle,
shall be that, which the words following do offer to our consideration (That
was against us, or which was contrary to us) I take those words together,
because the latter are but an expressing of the former in other terms, and all
one in effect, the meaning I showed to be this, so far forth as the Law did
convince of sin, and as a bond binds over to the punishment of sin. Hence
then it is clear.

Christ has taken away the rigor and curse of the moral Law from Gods
chosen.
and freed them from it, not in regard of obedience, or as a rule of obedience
and the duties of love both to God and men, but in regard of the rigor and
curse of it, as it is a rule of good life. it is perpetual, it continues for
ever, and admits no abrogation. Our Savior Christ says, Matthew. 5.17. He came
not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it. And the Apostle, Romans 3.31. Do we
make the Law of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the
Law; the Law then as it is a rule of good duties, both to God and men, is
unchangeable, not abrogated by Christ, but in the rigor of it, requiring of us
in this life exact and perfect obedience, and that personal, that a man in his
own person fulfill it, and for matter and manner do perfectly all things
contained in it, and in the threatening, inexorable severity and curse of it, as
it does either convince of sin for the least breach of it, or as it binderh
to the curse, for the transgression of it; so it is against us, and contrary to
us, and so it is taken away and removed by Christ. The Apostle says, Rom 6.14.
Ye are under the Law, as many as belong to Christ are not under the Law, (that
is) under the rigor of the Law; God does not examine their obedience according
to the strict rule of the Law, but is pleased through his grace in Christ, to
accept their sincere, though imperfect obedience, Gal. 3.13. It is most plain,
that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, when he was made a
curse for us, (for it is written) Cursed is every one that hangs on tree, and
Gal. 4.4.5. That he became subject to the Law that he might redeem them
which were veder the Law, that is, them that were under the yoke and bondage
of the Law, and especially under the curse of it, that he might redeem them
from under the bondage and curse of the Law: it is then a clear point.

That Christ has freed Gods chosen from the rigor and curse of the moral Law
of God. Come we to the use of it: and first, this doctrine may Discovery of the
vain shift used by many to maintain their loosenes of life.
and careless contempt of the will of God, and to exempt themselves from all
holy obedience, stick not to charge the Laws and Commandments of God with
too much rigor, and too much strictness; yea they dare say, in plain terms,
the Preachers of the word in urging good duties upon them, lay too much upon
them, and do too much restrain them of their pleasures and profits, of
liberty in speeches, and freedom in apparel, and such like; to give instance
in some particulars, will not the drunkard and sensual person say, he must
follow his pleasures, and take his delight among his companions, abridge him of
that, and take away his life. Will not the proud person, man or woman, say,
they must needs follow the fashion, they must be like others, or else be
counted no body in the world: and what is the plea of covetous persons that
will be rich, howsoever they get it, forsooth, we must use what means we can
for our state, and make the most of our own: and what say swearers, and
blasphemers, Oh we cannot always avoid an oath, it is but a small matter now
and then to rap out an oath, and to swear a little: and generally what say al
loose livers, and profane persons, but this; the Preachers would have us
become saints on earth, but it will not be, our nature cannot like of such
strictness. Now, what is this (I beseech you) but, as if they should say the
law of God, the rule of holy and good life is too rigorous, and too
intolerable, and we cannot endure it: yea, what is this but a plain evidence
that they belong not to Christ, for there is no rigor in the Law to them that
are in Christ. If then we hold the law too rigorous and strict, we make an
argument against our selves, we conclude, our selves not to belong to Christ,
and of our own mouths will the Lord one day judge us; think on it all you
whosoever you be that are ever carping and cauelling and excepting against some
thing in each Commandment of GOD as too hard, too strict, and too rigorous.

And now to speak something on the other side, for the comfort and
encouragement of such as are in Christ, and endeavor to obey the will of God
in all things, without any reasoning and without disputing against it.

good duties perfectly, yet their practice of them faithfully is pleasing to
God, Comfort to such as are in Christ, their faithful practice of good duties
though it be imperfect, yet it is pleasing to God.
though they cast not off all evil fully, as they desire; yet true resistance
of it with hatred, is accepted of the Lord, though they have so many
infirmities as do make them often to sin, and to come short of perfection in
their best actions; yet the Lord will not examine their actions according to
the strict rule of his Law. They are freed by Christ from the rigor of the law
and their imperfect obedience to the Law is dead in the blood of Christ, and so
made, not (as the Papists teach) meritorious, but pleasing to God, their
failings besides their purpose shall never be laid to their charge, the Lord
will accept their will and sincere affection to obey him in all things, as
obedience acceptable to him, for that is the work of God in them, he works
that affection in them, and know it for a certain truth, God will approve thee
for his own work found in thee, and not reject thee for thine, he has
wrought in thee a will to obey him, he will not cast thee off because of thy
weakness, but will accept thy will to obey, for obedience it self, and will
spare thee in regard of thy weakness, as a man spares his own child, they
are the Lords own words uttered by the mouth of his Prophet, Mal. 3.17. a man
seeing the willingness of his child to do that he bids him though not able
to do it, is content to accept it as the deed it self: so does God deal with
his children, which may be an excellent comfort and encouragement to all that
are in Christ, to go on in walking humbly before the Lord and endeavoring to
keep faith and a good conscience.

Again, is it so that Christ has freed Gods chosen Such as truly believe in
Christ, must learn not to fear any evil overmuch.
as reuiling, cursings of ill tongs witchcraft, plague, pestilence famine,
sword, or death it self, for why, the curse which makes all these and other
like things hurtful is removed from them, that are in Christ. Therefore let
not them fear these things before they come, nor be discouraged when they
fall upon them. We read Heb. 11.36.37.38. That such as were renouned for their
faith in Christ and through faith obtained a good report, were tried by
mockings and scourgings; yea, moreover by bonds and imprisonment, they were
stoned, they were heawen asunder, and had their bones broken, etc. Let us then
be strengthened by this cloud of witnesses, as the holy Ghost calls it. Heb.
12.

First, Against fear of any evil that may befall us although it be so, that
we be taken away through want of food in time of dearth, or by plague or
pestilence, or by any other means; yet remember this, if we be in Christ, the
venom and sting of these things is removed from us and they fall not upon us,
as a curse, indeed if we be out of Christ, these things are but praeludia,
forerunners of further woe and misery, such as live in their sins, and are
out of Christ their condition is fearful: Note.
let them know to their terror, that, as they that are in Christ have no law
written against them, the handwriting that was against them is blotted out and
cancelled, so they that be out of Christ, have the Law in full force and
strength against them, they are subject to the rigor of the Law; yea which is
more; they have no Gospel written for them, for the comforts and sweet
promises of the Gospel belong to none, but to them that are in Christ; the
Gospel in it self which is the sweet covenant of grace, to them that are out
of Christ, is a word of bitterness, a word of terror, and further increase of
judgment, because they believe it not, and the seals of that covenant, the
Sacraments received by them, become seals of their judgment and damnation, 1
Cor. 11.29. In being pertakers of them, they eat and drink judgment and the
curse of God to themselves, and there is but a step between them and hell, and
there is no other difference between them and those that now lie frying in Hell
fire; but this, that they are past recovery, and these, in the great patience
and long suffering of God, are suffered yet for a time, (how long or how short
none knows but the Lord) to see if they will accept of life and salvation
offered them, which is a thing to be thought on with trembling; yea, such a
thing as may move the most wicked and profane person, man or woman in the
world if the Devil have not taken full possesssion of their souls, to
bethink themselves of speedy reformation.

Come we to the degrees by which the Apostle sets down the cancelling of
the hand writing that was against us.

1 He says, Christ has put it out.

2 He adds further, he has even taken it out of the way.

And not content with that he goes a step higher,

3 And says, he fastened it upon the Cross.

We are in general to mark the amplification of this point, the Apostle
thought it not sufficient to say, we have grace and full remission of all our
sins, but subioines to that.

That the Bill or Bond which did convince us of sin, and bind us over to the
punishment, is blotted out. Yea, but might some say, though it be blotted out,

The Apostle preuents this, and says,

Yea, but might some say,

This also the Apostle meets withal, and says,

That the word of God is able to resolve us all difficulties, and to answer all
occurring doubts, of the flesh whatsoever. But I will hold to the particular
here intended by the Apostle: hence it follows necessarily.

If we truly believe in Christ we are to be fully resolved True believers are
to be fully resolved of the pardon of all their sins.
and not to doubt of it, we must be fully persuaded of the truth of the whole
word of God, but especially of those things be they threatenings or promises
which the spirit of God has much beaten upon, and urged with much
amplyfication.

Has the holy Ghost been careful to take away all scruple and to answer all
doubts against full satisfaction for the sins of Gods chosen, and assurance
of the pardon of them to them that are in Christ,

Surely it must needs be a satanicall Spirit that shall contradict the Spirit
of God, in so plain and plentiful evidence of truth; and indeed it is the
spirit of Antichrist that does gain say it. The Papists teach, we can have no
assurance by faith, that our sins are forgiven us, It is the spirit of
Antichrist that teaches that true believers cannot be assured by faith of the
pardon of their sins.
and one of their cauelling objections is this.

We are to pray for the pardon of our sins every day, and to say, forgive us
our trespasses; therefore we cannot be assured of the pardon of them, if we
could, then we need not pray for it.





One thing more observe we, from these degrees by which the Apostle sets down
the cancelling of that hand writing that was against us, we are to mark that
the Apostle ioines these three things together.

1 Blotting out that hand working. 2 Taking it out of the way, and 3 Fastening
it to the cross.
As indeed signifying one and the same thing in substance (namely) this That
Christ has removed from the chosen of God the rigor and curse of the Law: so
as now it has no power over them and shall never hurt them.

And this is amplified by the Apostle in regard of our weakness with this
variety of phrase, that Christ has blotted out the hand writing, taken it
away, fastened it to the cross, ascending thus by degrees, but meaning one and
the same thing, this is to be observed to this purpose, it may teach us:

That the phrases and forms of speech used in Scripture The phrases and forms
of speech used in Scripture, of blotting out sins, of taking them away like a
cloud, and the like, signify thus much, that sin is quite taken away and
shall never hurt them that be in Christ.


It is all one with this, that their sins are fastened and nailed to the
Cross, for we see the Apostle ioines these together, blotting out, taking
away, and fastening to the Cross, as all coming to one purpose; wickedly, and
therefore most injuriously deal the Papists with us, in charging us to make a
justified man, but as a whited tomb fair without and foul within, and why
so? Forsooth, because we teach according to the phrase of the Scripture,
Remouall of a wicked slander which the Papists cast upon us.
but the merit of Christ his death imputed for the pardon of them. This, says
the Papist is to make a justified man like to a sepulcher whited without with
an imputed justice, but within full of iniquity and disorder; a mere shift and
cauelling slander, for to have some hid and covered (as we see) according to
the phrase of Scripture, is not (as they grossly imagine) to have it cloaked,
or as it were varnished over with a fair color, it still remaining under that
color, no, no, it is to have it quite removed, and taken away in the
punishment of it; for indeed nothing can be hid from Gods sight: when therefore
sin is said to be hid or covered in respect of God, the meaning must needs
be, it is quite taken away, it is as if it had never been, and let not the
Papists by any cavil they can devise, drive us from this truth and from the
comfort of it which is this.

If the Lord impute not sin, we are to know, Note.
he will never punish it, if he remember it not, certainly he will never
revenge it: if he cover our sins, without question he will never call them to
judgment, they are taken out of the way and fastened to the Cross, and shall
never be laid to our charge.

Come we now to the very last words of this Verse, wherein (as I said) is
implied the means by which Christ cancelled the handwriting that was against
us (namely) his Cross, Interpretation.
by the Cross we are to understand Christ his suffering death upon the Cross;
that Christ by dying on the Cross, did by that his death, blot out, take away
and cancel the handwriting that was against us, the very same nails that were
driven into his hands and his feet, were by him driven through that
handwriting: the meaning is in a word, that the very death, that Christ died
on the Cross, was an utter abolishing and taking away of the handwriting that
was against the chosen of God.

We are here first to mark, that the Apostle does ascribe the remouall, and
the taking away of the handwriting that was against us, not to the life of
Christ, but to his death; not to his active obedience, but to his passive, to
his suffering death on the Cross. Hence we may conclude and easily gather.

Christ his active obedience did not purchase the taking away of the guilt and
punishment due to Gods chosen for their sins, but his passive obedience.
his death and suffering; though Christ his active obedience was most exact and
perfect, and he in his life fulfilled the whole Law of God perfectly, yet was
not that perfect, legal and meritorious obedience of his, sufficient to
procure remission of sins, freedom from the curse of the Law; he must over
and besides that, suffer death, even the cursed death of the Cross, and bear
in his body and soul the extremity of Gods wrath, before he could satisfy
Gods justice for the sins of his chosen: and therefore it is said Isai. 53.5.
That he was wounded for our transgressions, and broken for our iniquities, the
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. And
the Apostle, 1. Pet. 2.24. says, He bare our sins in his body on the tree.

I may safely say it and deliver it as a certain truth, Discovery of the
monstrous pride of the Papists challenging remission of sins for something done
by themselves.
yea, for some things done by themselves, which they have no warrant in the
word of God, but merely devised by themselves, as their pilgrimages, wilful
poverty, vow of single life, and the like, they dare challenge pardon of sins
for these things, and stand upon it, that they purchase and procure remission
of sins by them. Oh the height of pride in these men, Jesus Christ the
righteous did not purchase remission of sins by his perfect fufilling of the
Law in his life, and yet the proud Papist shall challenge it for his will
worship, and devised obedience, which indeed is most hateful, and a most
abominable pride and presumption.

The next thing that is offered to our consideration, from this word (Cross)
is, that which the Apostle thereby entends (namely) this.

That Christ his death, his suffering and shedding Only by the death of Christ
upon the cross was the rigor and curse of the Law removed from Gods chosen.
only by the death of Christ on the cross is the handwriting blotted out and
quite removed, and taken away from the chosen of God, for why? Christ on the
Cross stood in steed of Gods chosen, he was their surety. Heb. 7.22. And when
he stood on the Cross then only he underwent the curse for them; the Apostle
shows it most plainly, Gal. 3.13. he says Christ redeemed them from the
curse, but when? Even then, says the Apostle, when he was made a curse for
them, and when was that? Surely then, when he hung on the cross for so it
follows in the proof of the Apostle, in the words following; for it is
written, Cursed is every one that hangs on tree. He redeemed them from the
curse, even then, when he was made a curse for them, and that was when he hung
on the Cross, which is a most plain and pregnant proof of this point, that
only by the death of Christ on the Cross, the rigor and curse of the Law was
removed from Gods chosen.



I answer, We must go to the cross of Jesus Christ if we will find
deliverance from the curse and from the venom and sting of any trouble or
calamity.
Revel. 13.8.

First then, hence we learn, whither we are to go to be freed from the
curse, whither to go to find deliverance from the venom and sting of any
trouble or calamity that shall befall us (namely) to the Cross of Jesus
Christ, when thou art sick or cast, into any trouble whatsoever, if thou
desire to have the bitterness and curse of that trouble removed, then seek
thou to the Cross of Jesus Christ.



I answer, trouble be still continued on thee, yet the venom and bitterness
of that trouble is removed from thee, and it shall not hurt thee, and without
this thou shall find no comfort in the time of thy trouble, and though thou
be delivered from it, yet will it be but in judgment, not in mercy, as it
was with Pharaoh, so shall it be with thee: one trouble shall follow in the
neck of an other, till thou be destroyed. Learn then in time of thy distress
to go to the Cross of Jesus Christ for ease and comfort, and then thou shall
be sure, whether it be continuance of that distress, or deliverance from it,
it will be in mercy and not in judgment.

Again, is it so that only by the death of Christ on the If we look for
freedom from the curse of the law, it must be by faith in the death of Christ.
even by faith in Christ crucified only; by the death of Christ on the Cross
is the curse of the Law removed; so far forth then as we have part in his
death by faith, so far we are freed from the curse of the Law, and that we
deceive not our selves in this point; (for herein every one will flatter and
sooth up himself, and think that he has faith in the blood of Christ, and
presume to come to the Sacrament, wherein faith is especially directed to the
passion of Christ)

That we therefore deceive not our selves, Special directions in this point.
know it for a truth, we can never have faith in the blood of Christ unless
we be further enlightened then nature can afford, and be made to see the sins
of our hearts and lives; yea, to see our particular sins: the vilest wretch
that lives can in general say, he is a sinner, but our sight of sin must be
special; we must see our particular sins, and we must see them together
with the curse and judgments of God, attending upon them; that we may be
humbled for them, and find our selves stand in need of the blood of Christ,
for the pardon of them: many men's consciences can tell them of their particular
sins, and yet they are not humbled for them, what is the cause? Surely,
because they see them not together with the curse of God due unto them, they
bless themselves in their hearts, and say, we shall have peace, although we
walk according to stubbornness of our own hearts, thus adding drunkenness to
thirst, as it is, Deuteronomy. 29.19. Men naturally say in their hearts the curses of
the Law are foolishnes, and deride the judgments threatened against them for
their sins, with the wicked which say, Isay 5.19. Let him make speed, let him
hasten his work that we may see it, and let the council of the of the holy
one of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it.

Labor then to see thy particular sins, and to see them together with the
curse due vnro them, that so thou may be humbled and find thy self stand in
need of the blood of Christ, this is the way to prepare thy heart for the work
of faith; and if thy heart be thus prepared and humbled, no doubt the Lord will
work faith in thee, to apprehend the merit of Christ his death for the pardon
of thy sins and thou shall be freed from the curse of the Law, and then thou
coming to the Sacrament shall to thy comfort find thy faith in the blood of
Christ strengthened and confirmed; and the Sacrament shall be to thee a seal
of that righteousness that is by faith in Christ Jesus.

VER. 15. And has spoiled the principalities and powers, and has made a show
of them openly; and has triumphed over them in the same cross.
In this Verse is a further amplification of the effect of Christ his death on
the Cross spoken of in the Verse before, and that by a comparison of the
greater to the less on this manner.

Christ by his death on the Cross has not only cancelled the handwriting
that was against us and taken that out of the way and fastened it upon his
cross, but by the same death has vanquished the Devil, and the powers of
Hell, and triumphed over them. Wherein is also a prevention of a secret
objection touching the ignominy of the Cross; for some might happily think in
that Christ was brought to that ignominious and cursed death of the Cross,
that the Devils had a great hand over him; this the Apostle preuents setting
against it Christ his victory and triumph on the Cross, that thereby he foiled
them, and gave them their utter overthrow, and had a full, absolute, and
glorious victory, and conquest over them; that is the dependence of this Verse
on the former and the sum of it.

Now this victory and triumph is in this verse set out by things Christ did on
the Cross: as

First, that he spoiled his and our enemies, the Devils, Principalities and
powers.

Secondly, that he made an open show of them, and

Thirdly, that he triumphed over them, and all these

That as in heathen triumphs among the Romans, and others, the chief
generals and leaders being overcome and taken captives and prisoners, had their
armor taken from them, their hands bound behind them, and made to their
public shame to follow, or to go before the conqueror, mounted on his most
glorious and triumphing Chariot. Even thus Christ took all the Devils in hell
prisoners, disarmed them and led them in trumph like slaves with their hands as
it were bound behind them, mounted on the Cross, as on a royal Chariot
triumphing over them.

That is the general meaning of the Apostle in the words of this Verse.

Come we to the handling of them more particularly in the same order they are
laid down by the Apostle. Interpretation.


As first, that Christ spoiled the Principalities and powers; the word
translated spoiled, does properly signify stripped or made naked, and being
here applied to enemies overcome by Christ, it signifies, that he disarmed
them, pulled off their armor, took from them all their weapons, and left them
naked and spoiled of all power to hurt.

(The Principalities and powers.) To pass by all curious speculations touching
these words, we are to understand by them the Devil and his Angels, who are
said to be Principalities and powers, because of their power which they
exercise over the wicked: in which respect they are said to be, Ephesians. 6.12.
Worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, spiritual
wickedness in high places blinding the minds, and hardening the hearts of the
wicked. Thus then conceive we these words as if the Apostle had said.

And has disarmed the Devil and his Angels who are mighty and powerful in
the children of disobedience, and taken from them their weapons, and left them
as it were naked, and void of all means to do hurt. First observe we here
in general the Apostles amplification of the effect of Christ his death on the
cross, he says that Christ, by his death has not only cancelled the
handwriting that was against us, but (which is more) has vanquished the
Devil and his Angels, thus the Apostle goes on from the lesser to the greater,
and from the greater concludes the lesser.

That Christ having spoiled the principalities and powers, has certainly
cancelled the handwriting of ordinances, etc.

Hence we may gather thus much; That is a good argument Such as find the power
of Satan vanquished in themselves may thence certainly conclude that the curse
of the law is removed from the^ and that their sins are pardoned.
If any man find the power of Satan vanquished in himself, he may thence
certainly conclude the remoouall of the curse from him and the pardon of his
sins.

It is the Apostles manner of reasoning in this place, and as David said Psalm.
41.11. by this I know that thou fauourest me, because mine enemy does not
triumph over me. So without question may a man that finds that the Devil the
enemy of his soul does not tyrannize over him nor exercise his power in him
carrying his heart after sin, but his power is weakened, and his dominion
overcome in him that man may safely say.

By this I know my sins are forgiven and I am in Gods favor. When therefore
thou find that Satan's dominion is Comfort to such as find Satan's power
weakened in themselves.
and that he cannot prevail with thee to make thee fall into presumptuous
sins, but thou have strength of faith to repel and quench his fiery darts
(that is) sudden, strong and dangerous temptations make thy advantage of it,
and say to the comfort of thine own soul.

Certainly I am free from the curse of the law and my sins are forgiven.
Come we to a more special consideration of the words, and first consider we the
word (spoiled) the Apostle says, Christ has spoiled the principalities and
powers, that is, as we have heard before, has stripped or disarmed them, The
Devil and his Angels are stripped of all their power against Gods chosen by
the death of Christ.
by this manner of speaking we are given to understand thus much.

That Christ by his death has taken from the Devil and his Angels, their
power they had against Gods chosen, by his death he has stripped them, and
left them as it were naked creatures, not able to do the least hurt to Gods
chosen, so much is tendered to us under the word (spoiled) and we are to
consider it; and that we mistake it not, but may rightly conceive this
doctrine, we must consider what power the Devil had against Gods chosen before
the death of Christ, What power the Devil had against Gods chosen before the
death of Christ.
and how that power is taken away by Christ his death; for the understanding of
this know we, that all descending of Adam and Eve by natural generation are
guilty of their first sin and borne unclean sinners, and the justice of God
is such, that where there is guiltiness of sin there is damnation due, all
then being guilty of sin deserving damnation, the Devil he stands before
God day and night, requiring even by the justice of God that all should be
damned in hell for ever; Herein then stands the power of the Devil against
Gods chosen, he had power to accuse them in regard of their guiltiness of
sin, and had power under a certain right of Gods justice (for the Lord
cannot deny justice and right because he cannot deny himself) to require
their damnation, this power the Devil had against Gods chosen before the death
of Christ. Now this power is taken away by Christ his death, on this manner.

How the Devils power against Gods chosen is taken away.
The Lord Jesus took all the sins and guiltiness of Gods chosen upon him,
and did bear them in his body on the tree, he suffered all the wrath and
torments due for the same, and so with his own precious blood washed them and
made them clean from all guilt, and they being washed and made clean from
guiltiness and sin, all the Devils power to accuse and require sentence of
condemnation against them is taken away.

Thus we are especially to understand this doctrine.

That Christ by his death has taken from the Devil and his Angels their power
to hurt Gods chosen.

And this is chiefly intended by the Apostle in this, when he says, Christ
has spoiled the Devil and his Angels, but withal we are further to
understand that Christ by his death has taken away the Devils power to hurt
Gods chosen either by temptation or persecution* howsoever he is still suffered
to tempt them, and to persecute them with cruel torments, Note.
because the Lord in his infinite wisdom will not have Christ his power in
this respect to show it self forth at once but by degrees, and in some
measure for the time, and then perfectly to take effect when all the dead shall
be raised, and Christ have all his enemies made his footestoole, 1. Cor. 15.25.
albeit I say the Devil be still suffered to tempt and persecute Gods chosen,
yet his power to hurt them in regard of their salvation, their right and title
to eternal life and blessed estate in heaven is taken away, he cannot by any
temptation or persecution pluck out of Christ his hands, so much as one soul
of Gods chosen.

Thus then conceive we this doctrine.

That Christ by his death has taken from the Devil and his Angels their power
to accuse and require the sentence of condemnation against Gods chosen; yea,
their power to hurt any of Gods chosen either by temptation or persecution in
regard of right and title, and certain hope of life and salvation is taken
away. That is the doctrine, and to manifest this to be a truth consider we
these places of Scripture; Genesis 3, 15. we have it in the promise and
promulgation of the Gospel by God himself, that the seed of the woman (that
is) Christ should give him a deadly blow, break his power and strength, so as
he should never be able to recover it, and that he should only bruise the
heel of Christ (that is) only touch and try some weak members of Christ by
many temptations but not be able to hurt them Heb. 2.14. we are taught that
this promise was accomplished by the death of Christ, and that Christ through
death destroyed him that had the power of death (that is) the Devil, and
delivered them which for fear of death were all their life time subject to
bondage, Revel. 12.10.11. after the battle between Michael and the great
Dragon (that is) between Christ and the Devil, Christ ouercomming John says,
I heard a loud voice* saying, now is salvation in Heaven, and strength and the
Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our
brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. But
they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
testimony, Ioh. 12.31. our Savior says now shall the Prince of this world be
cast out and presently he subioynes, and I, if I were lift up from the earth,
will draw all men unto me, signifying that by his lifting up on the cross the
Prince of this world (that is the Devil should be cast out, these are plain
evidences and proofs of this point.

That Christ by his death has spoiled the Devil and his Angels, and taken
from them their power against Gods chosen to hurt them. Comfort to the true
members of Christ when they have to deal with the Devil they must remember
they have to deal with an enemy already overcome,
and let none but such take hold of it, let not such as are of the Devil, as
S. John says 1. Epist. 3.8. such as make a trade and common practice of sin
think to find comfort in this doctrine they are not within the compass of it,
it belongs only to the members of Christ, and let them know for their comfort*
that Christ by his death has spoiled the Devil and his Angels of their power,
so as now the Devil cannot accuse them of sin, and they having to deal with
the Devil (as at one time or other he will be tempering with them) they must
remember they have to deal with a naked creature, with an enemy indeed, but
already overcome they need no more, but as it were set their feet on his
neck as Iosuah commanded his captains to set their feet on the neck of the
Kings he had vanquished, Iosu. 10.24 though the Devil do many ways tempt and
try thee, thou being a member of Christ, yea, though he lay siege to thy soul
and conscience, to bring thee to despair, and the Lord suffer him for a time
to carry a strong hand over thee for some good cause known to himself, even
to fight against thee with the terrors of God, yet know it for a truth, he
shall never prevail against thee to thy destruction, after a while the power
of the Lord Jesus will show it self, and in the end he shall tread down Satan
under thy feet, as says the Apostle, Romans 16.20. and that speech of the
Apostle is worthy observation, he says not the God of peace the Lord Jesus
shall tread Satan under his feet, but he shall bring him under our feet, he
shall shortly make all that believe in him, to tread upon Satan, and to trample
him under their feet, what an excellent comfort is this for all that truly
believe in Christ, let them to their comfort meditate hereupon.

Again, is it so that Christ by his death has spoiled Satan, The way to
overcome the Devil is by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ.
Christ has overcome Satan by his death, and from thence must we derive power
to overcome him, if we would be armed to fight and get victory over the Devil,
it must be by faith in the death of Christ. And hence no doubt it is that men
are easily foiled and do soon yield to the least allurement and temptation of
Satan, because they want faith in the blood of Christ, we shall hear a man
sometimes say, Oh, I would leave my swearing, my drunkenness, or put away my
rash anger, or the like, but alas I am such a weak and forgetful creature I
cannot do it; do thou (whosoever thou art) speak in good earnest, would
thou indeed leave thy sin, and of weak be made strong to overcome it; learn
then how thou may be so, from the mouth of the holy Ghost, he has taught
thee, Heb. 11.34. that by faith in Christ of weak thou may be made strong
they are the very words of the holy Ghost in that place, and Saint John 1.
Epist. 5.4. says, this is our faith, by faith in Christ we shall be able to
overcome the world, yea the Prince of this world the Devil, and to withstand
his temptations.

Labor then to get faith in the death of Christ on the cross, and thou shall
thence draw down not only comfort but strength against sin and Satan; and
know it for a truth, though thou be one of Gods chosen, and Christ has by
his death disarmed the Devil, yet to thee it is not effectual, till thou come
to have faith in his death, till then the Devil has power to tempt thee, and
to overcome thee, therefore never rest till thou find that thou have faith in
the blood of Christ, and assurance that thy sins are washed away in his
blood, and then thou shall be sure to find strength against sin, Satan, and
all the enemies of thy salvation.

The next thing hence offered to be considered is from the words
(principalities and powers) in that the Apostle calls the Devil and his
Angels (principalities and powers) it is plain they are not as some have
thought, The error of the Saduces convinced.
evil affections and wicked thoughts, it was the error of the Saduces Act.
23.8. they thought the Devils were nothing but evil affections and wicked
thoughts, but they are plainly convinced of error, by this and many other
places of Scripture, but that by the way: that which we are from these words
to consider is this.

Though the devil and his angels be stripped of their power against Gods
chosen, yet they are still mighty and powerful over the wicked.
The devil is still a mighty prince exercising his power and tyranny over the
wicked, he holding up his scepter in their hearts; he still has power to blind
their minds and to harden their hearts, and to lead them into all kind of
impiety and sin; the Apostle says Ephesians. 2.2. he is the prince that rules in
the air, even the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience,
even now since the coming of Christ in the flesh; yea the devil does exercise
greater power and tyranny over the wicked since the death of Christ, than he
did before, Revel. 12.12. We find in that song of victory after Christ had
vanquished the devil, there is a calling upon the heavens, and upon them that
dwell in them, to rejoice for the victory, and a woe proclaimed to the
inhabitants of the earth, and why so? the reason is given, the devil is come
down unto them, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time;
The meaning is, though Satan, before Christ overcame him by his death, was
among the inhabitants of the earth, even such as have their portion in this
life, yet now being overcome and stripped of his power against Gods chosen, he
comes down more heavy and in more tyrannous sort upon them than before, and
their woe is as it were doubled by Christ his victory, Satan being now out of
all hope to impugn and pull down the salvation of Gods chosen, he will
wreake his ire upon the inhabitants of the earth, he will exercise his power
over them to the full, and lead them deeper into all horrible sin and
condemnation, and make them run greedily upon their own destruction.

We are not therefore to marvel at it, that the devil It is no matter of
wonder, that the devil rages more in these days then in former times.
and makes men now break out into greater outrage of sin than in former
ages; he is now come down among the inhabitants of the earth, in this latter
age of the world, in more tyrannous manner, and the elder the world waxes, the
more the devil rages, and the more he rages the more his strength increased,
for anger being the whetstone of strength sharpens it, Note
therefore marvel not at it, that wicked men are now more shameless in sin
then in former times, rather let us marvel at this, that the sun that has
been witness of so many foul sins (for men now shame not to sin in the
open sunne-light they declare their sins as Sodom, they hide them not Isa.
3.9.) that the sun I say falls not down from heaven, and that the earth
opens not her mouth to swallow us up, and that the Lord Jesus comes not down
in flaming fire to burn both heaven and earth and to give the wicked their
portion in the lake that burns fire and brimstone, we may now justly every
day look for his coming to make an end of these wretched and sinful days.

Such as now find themselves under the power of the Devil, are in a most
fearful estate.
exercise his power over the wicked, and his tyranny greater over them since
the death of Christ then before, then let such as find themselves now in this
time of the Gospel, under the power of the Devil, such as are now blind and
ignorant, such as are now senseless and secure wordlings such as now are given
over to sensuality and drunkenness, to pride, to whoredom, or any known sin,
let them consider in what a fearful estate they are, their case is now worse
then the case of infidels, and of heathen men before the coming of Christ in
regard of the devils power over them, now his tyranny doubled upon them, and it
is now harder to escape out of his hands them is was before the death of
Christ. Men commonly promise to themselves, now in the time of the Gospel, an
easy escape out of their sins, and a ready repentance when they will; yea,
when they are most weak, even gasping for breath on their deathbed, but
alas, they deceive themselves, and therein does the Devil show his power
over them in possessing their hearts with such deceiving thoughts, know it for
a truth, and consider it wicked man or woman, whosoever thou art, the Devil is
now more mad against thee then if thou had lived before the coming of
Christ, and therefore will not easily let thee slip out of his hands; and let
it stir thee up to use all means possible, and with speed to be delivered
out of his power, lest then going on with hope of easy escape, the Lord in his
just judgment give thee up to hardness of heart, and in the end it be with
thee, as it was with wicked Ahab, and hard hearted Pharaoh, that the Lord in
his justice offer thee some bait or other to pull thee on to thy destruction.

Come we to the next thing that Christ did on the Cross in these words, (And
has made a show of them openly) the word translated, has made a show of them,
(for it is one word in the original) does signify thus much.

Has made them a public spectacle of scorn and derision, Interpretation.
he has exposed them to shame and much disgrace (openly) the word signifies
(boldly) and the meaning is publicly in the sight of many beholders, (namely)
in the sight of God, his heavenly Angels, and in the sight of all that look on
the death of Christ by faith; for indeed when Christ hung on the cross, he was
a spectacle of shame and contempt in the eyes of the world; all that looked on
him with carnal eyes, mocked him, and had him in derision, but in the sight of
God, his Angels, and all true believers, he had glory, and the Devil and his
angels had shame; in the eyes of God, and of his Angels, and all true believers
was Christ his victory on the Cross, most manifest and glorious, though in
the sight of the wicked it was base and contemptible, thus then conceive we
these words as if the Apostle had said.

And has made the Devil and his angels a spectacle of shame and scorn in the
eyes of God, his Angels, and all that look on the Cross of Christ by faith
Now hence it is clear, that Christ by his death on the Christ by his death on
the cross shamed the Devil.
Christ his death on the cross was not only the Devils spoil, stripping him
of his power, but it was his shame and confusion, for why? When our Savior was
on the Cross the devils assaulted him most fiercely, and used all the strength
they had to vex and torment him: and therefore in the Psalm. 22. wherein is
figured under the person of David the passion of Christ, the Devils are
compared to dogs, to bulls of Basan which tore his hands and his feet, to
Lions, to Unicorns, in regard of the^r cruel usage of him. Now this they did
to this end, that they might overcome our Savior, and triumph over him; but
all in vain, he on the Cross spoiled them, overcame them, led them captives
and triumphed over them, herein then stood the shame of the Devil, by the
cross, that by it he was disapointed of his hope and purpose against Christ,
he hoped he should have utterly destroyed him, but he was deceived and
disapointed of his hope, yea put out of all hope ever to prevail against him,
and that was his shame: for as the Apostle says, Romans 5.5. The hope of the
godly makes them not ashamed, meaning that they cannot be disapointed of their
hope, and so come to shame.

Whence we may gather on the contrary, that where hope, fails especially in
great matters undertaken, shame comes upon it, and so the devil being
disapointed of his wished and most wicked purpose in the death of Christ, was
thereby shamed; yea, the death of Christ on the Cross was his disapointement,
and so was it his shame.

Is it so then, that Christ his death was the Devils shame, did Christ on the
Cross defeat the Devil of his mischeeuous purpose, did he then disapoint him,
when the Devil thought he had him at most advantage, and in the very hour of
darkness, when he was delivered into the hands of sinners? Mar. 14-41.

The Devil cannot possibly shame any member of Christ.
did Christ shame the Devil upon the cross, and will he now, being exalted
into heaven, suffer him to shame any of his members? No, no, it is not
possible, Christ on the cross made void the Devils hope, that our hope might
never make us ashamed; be strong then in the Lord Jesus, whosoever thou art
that have any measure of faith in his blood, and remember when thou have to
deal with the Devil, thou have to do with a shamed creature, if thou hold out
the blood of Christ, and come against the Devil, in the glory of his cross,
the Devil will be ashamed to look on thee; yea, dastardlike he will hide his
head, he will not abide the sight of thee, and this is a sweet meditation, let
all such as truly believe in Christ therein exercise themselves.

Again, in that Christ his death was the Devils shame, we learn how we may
come to shame the Devil in the By faith in Christ his death we may come to
shame the devil in Gods sight.
by fetching our glory from his Cross, it may not be by standing on any worth
or excellency in our selves: no, no, in this case the common saying is true,
Confess the truth and shame the Devil, we must confess, we deserve nothing
by the best thing in us, but shame and confusion, if the Lord should deal with
us in his justice: and seek only to the Cross of Christ for our glory, and
say with the Apostle Gal. 6.14. God forbid, that I should rejoice but in the
Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world, and then we shall be able to put the Devil to shame.

One thing more we are to observe from these words, the Apostle says, Christ
by his death made the Devil ashamed openly, that is, as we have heard, boldly,
publikly, in the sight of God, of his Angels, and of all that look on the
Cross of Christ by faith. Note we then thus much.

That the Devils shame by the Cross of Christ, is The Devils shame by the
Cross of Christ, is an open shame.
to God, to his Angels; yea to all that by faith look on his Cross. No doubt
the Apostle had his eye upon it, when he said, 1 Cor. 2.2. He esteemed not to
know any thing save Jesus Christ and him crucified; he thought nothing so
worthy to be known as the glorious death of Christ.

If we then see not the glory of Christ on the Cross, Pet. 1.12. They desire
to behold the things of the Gospel and see them with admiration, we have no
faith in the death of Christ, If we see not Christ his glory and the Devils
shame in the Cross of Christ, we have no faith in the death of Christ.
yea, let me tell you more, if we see not Christ his glory and the Devils
shame, set before us in the preaching of the Gospel and administration of the
Sacraments (for therein is Christ crucified set before us, Gal 3.1.) If we
take no delight in seeing by the eye of our souls the glorious show that is
set before us in these things, but we turn our backs upon them, or our
hearts, are heavy and dull and not affected with them, and we have no delight
in them, it is more then a probable argument, we have no faith in the death of
Christ.

It is a wonder to see, how many men and women are carried after vain shows
and spectacles, and how they delight in them, how they run after a may game,
or the like, it is because they are not able to see better things. Pray then
that thine eyes may be opened to see that glorious show Christ Jesus made upon
the Cross, and that thou may delight morein that, then in all the
glittering shows of the world, otherwise thou can look for no comfort in
that glorious and triumphant death of Christ.

(And has triumphed over them in the same Cross.) Some read the words thus
(And has triumphed over them in himself.) But I take this reading (has
triumphed over them in the same Cross) to be more agreeable to the context and
scope of the Apostle, though the word Cross be not found in the original, yet
it is to be understood and may truly be supplied, as we have it in our
English translation.

For when did Christ spoil Satan and destroy his power, but when he suffered
death on the Cross, as is plain, Heb. 2.14. and then also he triumphed over
him. Now the Apostles meaning in saying Christ triumphed over them is this.

Interpretation.
That Christ by his death not only overcame the devil and his Angels and
stripped them of all power to hurt Gods chosen, but in his death he got
himself honor and glory over the Devil, and he did as Conquerours use to do
in their triumphs, that as they riding in triumph make known their power and
virtue over their enemies to their greater glory: so Christ on his cross to
his great glory did manifest and make known his power over the Devil; he
therein made his glorious power over the Devil and his Angels fully appear,
both to God, to his Angels, and to all that look on his cross by faith, and
that was his triumph, he on the cross showed himself more powerful then the
Devil, and stronger then all the powers of hell; yea, therein he manifested
the power of his Godhead, for though he cried with strong cries and tears and
sweat drops of blood, and cried out that God had forsaken him, yet his Godhead
sustained him, and even then by the power of his Godhead he uttered words of
faith and confidence, and said, My God, my God, in his greatest agony, he
showed himself stronger then the Devil and his Angels, and overcame them, and
so had the glory of a full victory and conquest over them.

Thus then conceive we these words as if the Apostle had said.

And in the same death on the Cross has manifested and made his power over
the Devil and his Angels fully to appear and gotten himself glory over them
in the sight of God, his Angels, and all that look one his Cross by faith.
Hence it is most clear, that Christ by his death has Christ by his death has
gotten a full and absolute victory over the Devil and his angels.
No man of any wisdom will triumph and boast himself before the victory. When
Ben-hadad King of Aram coming to battle against the King of Israel boasted
himself that the dust of Samaria should not be enough for all the people that
followed him, for every man an handful, 1. King. 20.10.11. The King of Israel
returned him this answer, Let not him that girdeth his harness boast himself,
as he that puts it off; giving him to know, that he boasted unreasonably,
before his time, he triumphed, before the victory which was folly in them, for
the event of war is uncertain, and triumph ever follows victory. Christ
therefore having triumphed over the Devil and his Angels in his cross, it is
most certain, he had therein a full victory and conquest over the powers of
hell, and that makes for our exceeding great comfort.

That Christ by his death has made a full and perfect satisfaction to God for
the sins of his chosen, Chist by his death has made a full and perfect
satisfaction, for the sins of Gods chosen.
yea Christ his obedience satisfactory was fully accomplished on the Cross.
And so are we to understand that speech of our Savior in his giving up the
Ghost, John 14.30. It is finished meaning that his satisfactory obedience was
then fully ended, and without question he could not triumph before he had
made a full and perfect satisfaction for us.

Objection:

I answer, Romans 4.25. the Apostle says Christ was delivered to death for our
sins, and is risen aganie for our justification, (that is) both to testify
his perfect obedience, and to apply it to us by his Spirit to our justification.

And the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.10. says, Christ ascended that he might fill all
things (that is) as may appear by the context of that place, that he might
fill Gods elect with all gifts of his spirit, needful to their salvation and
so work faith in them to apprehend the merit of his death to their
justification, we are then to hold it for a certain truth, that Christ his
death on the cross was a perfect satisfaction to God for the sins of his
chosen and therein he ended his satisfactory obedience, and we are to renounce
all other expiatory sacrifice whatsoever they be, they do much derogate from
Christ his victory and triumph on the cross; Popish expiatory sacrifices do
much derogate from Christ his triumph on the Cross-
and such as maintain them are enemies to the cross of Jesus Christ.

The next thing here offered to our consideration is this.

That Christ his cross was as it were his triumphing chariot, whence we may
easily see that Christ got himself Christ got himself glory not out of that
which is glorious, but out of his ignominious death on the cross.
it is the usual manner of working with the Lord to bring one contrary out of
another, especially when he has any excellent thing to work to his own
glory. In the first creation he made something, yea, all things of nothing,
Note.
he commanded the light to shine out of darkness 2. Cor. 4.6. in the
preservation of his people, he caused the water to come out of a rock, Numb.
20.22. In the work of the conversion of a sinner, ordinarily he works by the
preaching of the word, which is as contrary to nature; as fire to water, for
there is no seed of faith in nature and preching is folishnesse to the natural
man, and it is most clear from this text, that the Lord Jesus brought life out
of death yea, out of his ignominious and cursed death of the cross he got
himself exceeding great glory in the sight of God his Angels and of all that
with the eye of faith behold his cross, and this himself foretold, Ioh.
13.31.32. that God should be glorified in him, in his death, that the power of
his Godhead, should then manifestly appear, as indeed Christ will be
exceedingly glorified when he shall come to judgment in rendering vengeance to
the devil and to all the wicked.
as by darkning of the sun, the trembling of the earth, by cleaving a sunder
of rocks by the rising of some dead bodies, by rending asunder the veil of the
temple which drew from the Centurion a plain confession, certainly this man
was the son of God, a thing very worthy our serious meditation.

Is it so then that Christ triumphed and got himself glory over the Devil and
his Angels out of his cross even then when he suffered that shameful and
ignominious death on the cross? Oh then how will he be glorified when he
shall come with power and glory to judgment with thousands of his Angels, how
shall he then get himself glory in rendering vengeance to the Devil, and to
all wicked imps the instruments and limbs of the Devil? wicked men happily
think because Christ is a Savior therefore he will be a mild and favorable
judge, and not deal with them in rigor and severity, but let them know, that
when he shall put on his garment dipped in blood as we have it, Revel. 19.3.
when he shall arise and take hold of Judgment they shall find him a most
terrible God of vengeance; if he that is a sweet and comfortable Savior become
bitter and terrible, Note.
surely, his bitterness and terror will be intolerable, and he will be most
dreadful to all his enemies, even to all such as impugn and hinder the course
of his Gospel, yea, as the Apostle says, 2 Thessalonians. 1.8. to all that know not
God, and which obey not unto the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; let all
ignorant persons then and all hard hearted sinners think upon it, and in fear
labor to make this terrible judge their glorious and comfortable Savior.

Christ will work the glory of all his true members out of their suffering be
they never so shameful.
yea, as the Apostle says, Romans 8.7. through him they shall be more then
conquerours, they shall be triumphers in their sufferings, he will supply to
them such strength of faith and patience as their very enemies shall stand
amazed and wonder at them, and say, as the chief Priests and Scribes said,
Act, 4.16. what shall we do to these men, a speech worthy observation, they
that had power to imprison the Apostles, or to do with them what they would,
stand aghast and at their wits end, and know not what to do to poor, weak,
unarmed and friendlesse men, a strange thing, and such a thing as nature,
reason and the world understands not. Thus no doubt will the Lord Jesus show
forth his power in all his members, as he got himself glory out of his own
cursed death, so certainly will he show his power, and be glorified in thy
sufferings if thou belong to him; it is a shrewd evidence, men belong not to
Christ, when under the cross they rage and storm, and foame out their own
shame, the folly and corruption of their own hearts, if thou belong to Christ,
Christ will be glorified in thee, not only in thy actions, but in thy
passions, in thy sufferings, also he will manifest his power in thy patience,
faith and constancy under the cross, he will make thee more then a conqueror
in thy greatest afflictions.

Observe we further, that when Christ in the eye of the world had shame, and
seemed to be overcome, then had he glory, he vanquished and triumphed over his
enemies in his cross, hence we are to take out this point of instruction.

That we are not to judge of any by the outward We are not to judge of any by
the outward appearance.
It is our Saviors own rule Ioh. 7.24. judge not according to the appearance,
but judge righteous judgment and the reason Eccles. 9.1. no man knows either
love or hatred of all that is before them (that is to say by the consideration
of outward things it cannot be gathered whom God does love or hate, indeed we
may, and ought to despise a vile person, Psalm. 15.4. whether rich or poor, for
his vileness, yet may we not judge him vile Reproof of such as judge both
themselves and others by their outward estate in this life.
to think if a man thrive in the world then God loves him, and if he be
crossed in outward things then God hates him. But we must learn to reform our
judgment in this point and know that outward prosperity or adversity are
leade^ rules to judge by; it is no good argument to say God loves us because we
prosper in the world; or he hates us because we are crossed in outward things;
no, no, we are to look into the causes and qualification of the mind,
repentance, or hardness and continuance in sin: if we find the latter of
these howsoever we prosper: yet let us know it is not a blessing but a curse,
and it comes indeed from the providence of God, but to make his judgment just
when it falls upon us, by reason of our abuse of his mercy.

Let us then strive after this grace, that we may judge aright both of our
selves and others, and especially in time of affliction, it is a singular grace
of God to judge rightly of others in time of affliction, David pronounces a
blessing on him that judges wisely of the poor, Psalm. 41.1. blessed is he
that judges wisely of the poor: the Lord shall deliver him in the time of
trouble, etc. If we judge the poor the worse because of his poverty, or more
hardly judge of any because he is afflicted be it one that has been in our
knowledge guilty of some great sin (as we are ready to say if we see one
whom we have known guilty of some foul sin to be afflicted, I knew it
would come home to him, the Lord would plague him and not suffer him to go
unpunished) if we thus judge of the afflicted, we may happily sin against
the generation of Gods children, as David says, Psalm. 73.15. for the Lord may
have pardoned that sin, and we judging him plagued for it, we condemn him
whom God has acquitted, and that is a fearful presumption and such as cannot
escape the punishing hand of God.

Let us therefore learn to contemn a vile person discovered to be so for his
vileness, but take heed we judge of no man by the outward appearance, judge
wisely of the poor and afflicted that we may be blessed of the Lord, and
that he in mercy may deliver us in the time of our own troubles.

VER. 16. Let no man therefore condemn you in meat and drink, or in respect
of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days,
In this verse we have the Apostles conclusion of his refutation of legal
ceremonies which were urged on the Colossians by false teachers, as of
necessary use to salvation for the Apostle began to deal in particular against
those ceremonies verse 11. and from that verse to this has proved by many
arguments.

That there is perfect salvation, and all things needful to salvation to be
found in Christ, and that in him such as believe are complete and have all
perfection.

Therefore legal ceremonies are needless, this the Apostle infers in this
verse by way of dehortation, and that in regard of the premised reason; they
should not let any man condemn them, touching their neglect of those legal
ceremonies, and he does insist in some certain kinds of them urged by false
teachers, and under them comprehends all the rest as may appear by his
general reason in the verse following:

He gives instance of two sorts.

First, the ceremoniail choice of meats and drinks, let no man condemn you in
meat and drink.

Seeondly, the observation of Jewish feasts, which he does express in these
particulars, holy days, new moons or Sabbath days.

Come we to consider the words of this verse as they are laid down in order,
Interpretation.
and first of these words (let no man condemn you in meat and drink) the word
translated condemn does properly signify judge; it is usual in Scripture put
down the one for the other; the general word (judge) for the special
(condemn) we have it often so, Romans the 14. the same original word is in
our English rendered, and that truly, verse 3. (judge) and verse 4. (condemn)
for indeed the Apostles meaning in saying, let no man condemn you, is let no
man spend his judgment upon you in the woorst part let him not judge you to
sin, and condemn you to sin in meat and drink (that is) touching meats
and drinks prohibited touching the use of meats and drinks forbidden by Moses
Law, let no man judge you to sin in the use of them.

Moses Law.



And thus we are to conceive these words, as if the Apostle had said.

Care not for it, regard it not, that any man does judge you faulty and condemn
you of sin for eating and drinking meats and drinks forbidden in the Law of
Moses that judgment and condemnation of you is unjust. Now in the first place
we are to mark the maine of the Apostles speech, his speech is not a bare and
simple admotion, but a powerful inhibition, he says not, take heed that no
man condemn you, but he delivers his speech in manner of a law and form of a
commanding iniunction; let no man condemn you etc. the Colossians were in
danger to suffer false teachers to judge and condemn them in regard of legal
ceremonies and to take to heart their unjust censures, the Apostle therefore
interposeth his Apostolical authority, whereby he had power to give precepts
binding conscience, and he enioynes them not to suffer any so to do, let no
man, says the Apostle condemn you, let no man lay it upon you as a Law.

And thus the Ministers of the Gospel may exercise that Though the Ministers
of the Gospel may not give new precepts binding consciences yet their doctrine
being grounded on the written word of God may be charged upon men's consciences
and they may enjoin this to be done or that to be avoided.
The Apostle has taught us that it is a part of the ministerial office to be
instant, 2. Tim. 4.2. and that must be by commanding, urging, persuading, and
forbidding, etc. as occasion is offered, and especially then may the Ministers
of the Gospel use this manner of speaking, when they see their people in
danger to revolt from the truth, and to be seduced, they may then be instant
with them, and lay it as a law on their consciences, and say, let no man seduce
you, let no man draw you away from the truth, and thus must I needs at this
time frame and address my speech to some in our Church, I see some amongst us
in danger to be seduced and led aside into that dangerous schism of Brownisme,
Particular application to some being in danger to be led aside into that
dangerous schism of Brownism.
to such therefore I speak,

We in this Church of England have (blessed be God for it) the truth of
religion held, taught and professed, yea, the Brownists themselves cannot deny
but that the whole fundamental substance of truth is amongst us, yea, I dare
be bold to say futher, in the word of truth, and in the name of God, and to
pawn mine own soul upon it, we have the substance of the truth grounded on
the written word of the Prophets and the Apostles, and therefore upon this
ground I must charge thee whosoever thou art, that art wavering, and in danger
to be seduced and drawn to Brownisme, and lay it a law upon thy soul and
conscience, let no man seduce thee, and draw thee away from the truth of
religion held and professed amongst us, it is a saying worthy to be remembered,
and often thought on, that in divine matters, in matters of so high a nature as
is religion, no consultation is to be used, stand not thou now to consult of a
charge of religion, but be resolved of the truth held and professed, and tread
under foot all persuasions to the contrary whatsoever; and thus I thought good
to speak, occasioned from the manner of the Apostles speech in this place.

Now from the matter of this powerful iniunction, in that the Apostle says,
let no man condemn you in meat and drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of
the new It is the property of false^ teachers to judge and condemn men
chiefly for the use or neglect of outward things.
in respect of meat, drink, observation of days and the like. Therefore the
Apostle gives the Colossians a countermand, and enioynes them not to suffer
any false teachers to join with them, yea, it is the property of a false
teacher, rather to judge and condemn for the use or neglect of outward things,
then for the breach and transgression of the moral law of God, see it in one
example. The Scribes and Pharisees did more condemn for not washing hands
before meat, and the neglect of other things devised by themselves, then they
did for the transgression of Gods commandments, our Savior reproues them for
it, Mat. 15. from verse 3. to the 10. Let this serve Popish teachers plainly
discover themselves to be led with a spirit of error.
we shall easily find this mark on their foreheads, it is apparent every man
may see it, they more urge their own fleshly and ceremonial Law worship then
they do the spiritual worship of God; yea, it is extant and to be found upon
record in their own stories, that men have been more severely punished for
eating flesh on a friday, then for simple fornication or following strange
flesh, which is a certain note and badge of an Antichristian Church, learn we
hereby to discern them and to take knowledge of the spirit by which they are
led, and so according to the commandment of the Apostle in this place regard
not their unjust censures, calling thee heretic and loading thee with
opprobrious names; they will condemn thee to the pit of hell for not observing
some rotten devise of their own. Esteem it not, but set light by it as the
breath of men; yea, as the curse that is causeles Pro 26.2. and shall never
come.

The next thing offered to our consideration from this iniunction is the
instance here given by the Apostle he says, let no man condemn you, and he
does instance in meat and drink, hence we may take up this conclusion.

That through Christ we have free liberty in meat and We have free liberty
through Christ in the use of meat and drink.
we may freely eat any kind of meat and drink; any kind of drink; and men
are not to accuse and condemn us of sin in so doing, if they do we are not
to regard their censure.

Among the Jews before the coming of Christ there was a difference of meats;
some were clean, and some were unclean and forbidden, we may read of them
Leuiticus eleventh, through out, and Deutro. 14, from verse four, to the end of
the twenty and one, but now since the death of Christ all kinds of meat and
drink are left to our liberty, that difference is taken away, and as the
Apostle says, Tit. 1.15. To the pure all things are pure, and Romans 14.14 I
know says the Apostle, and am persuaded through the Lord Jesus that there is
nothing unclean of it self, but unto him that judges any thing unclean to
him it is unclean, and Verse 20. all things indeed are pure. The reason of
this is plain, before the coming of Christ some meats were clean and some
unclean, to signify a difference between Jew and Gentile, and the Jew
should not communicate with the Gentile, but now by Christ that partition wall
is broken down, and of two they are made one in him, Ephesians. 2.14.15. Therefore
the difference of meats is taken away, and Christians may now with good
conscience, with moderation eat any kind of meat, and drink It is injurious
to Christ his death to forbid the eating of some kind of meats at sometimes,
as the Papists do
at this day, it is made by the Apostle, a badge of Antichristian apostasy, 1.
Tim. 4.3. commanding to abstain from meats which God has created, to be
received with giving thanks, of them which believe and know the truth.

Object:

Answ: Noah, therefore they forbid it as unclean.







eat be not of the daintiest. Dan. 10.3. In a word, they may in time of famine
and scarcity ^enioine us a public fast, that we may testify our humiliation
and better attend on the exercises of the word and prayer, and we are then also
to obey them these cautions observed. Cautions to be observed in keeping a fast.


First, that our fasting be void of superstition, and that

Secondly, that we have no opinion of merit by it, that

Thirdly, That we hold it not of absolute necessity.

And lastly, that it be without breach of the rule of charity,

Thus we see that our Magistrates may forbid the eating of meats at some
times, and how we may also with good conscience obey them.

And yet, this remains a truth, that we have liberty through Christ to eat
any kind of meat, and that we may not be interdicted any kind of meat, at any
time, as unholy or unclean as it is among the Papists.

And let us use this liberty, purchased by Christ, with We are to use our
Christian liberty touching meats and drinks with thanksgiving and in
sobriety.
that by our eating and drinking we may be more fit to serve God, and to do
good duties; let us eat in time for strength, and not for drunkenness,
Eccles. 10.17. Let us not tire our selves with eating and drinking, and disable
our selves and make our selves fit for nothing but drinking, and then pretend
Christian liberty; so doing we turn Christian liberty into unchristian, yea
brutish license to sin, and we use our liberty as an occasion to the flesh.

Let this be far from us, and remember we the words of the holy Ghost, 1 Pet.
5.8. Be sober and watch, for your adversary the Devil as a roaring Lion
walks about seeking whom he may devour: giving to understand, that an
epicure or drunkard is a fit prey for the Devil.

Come we to the second sort of legal Ceremonies, wherein the Apostle does
insist) namely) the observation of Jewish feasts in the words following.

Or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath day.
Interpretation.
For the understanding of these words, we must know that the Jews had many
festival days, which they were to observe and keep holy by the appointment
of the Lord, but three special great feasts had they every year above the
rest, which were called solemn feasts, or holy Exodus 23. from Verse 14. to the
20. Leuit. throughout Deuteronomy. 16. from the beginning to verse the 15. They were
also appointed to offer a burnt offering unto the Lord in the beginning of their
months, Numb. 28.11. and they had an holy convocation, and were to keep the
first and last day of their great feasts, as Sabbaths, we find it so Leu.
23.35.39. these things rightly conceived, they will lead us to the true sense
and meaning of the Apostle in this place. For first, by holiday or feast, we
are to understand those three solemn feasts, the Passover, Pentecost, and the
feast of Tabernacles; by new Moon, the feast they kept in the beginning of
their month, by Sabbath days, not the Lords ordinary Sabbath, but the first
and last day

Now, whereas the Apostle says (in respect) it may be expounded either in
regard of the whole feast, or (as the original word signifies) in regard of
part of it for happily, some amongst the Colossians did in part observe the
Jewish feasts, and in part neglect them, thus then we are to understand these
words, as if the Apostle had said.

Let no man condemn you for neglect of any great feat of the Jews, or for not
observing their feast of the new Moon, or the first and last day of their
great feasts, or briefly thus.

Let no man lay sin upon you for neglect of any Jewish holy day either in
whole or in part. Now first, from the second instance of the Apostle, in that
he says, let no man condemn you in the observation of any Jewish feast, it is
manifest and clear.

That we now through Christ since the death of Christ have a liberty in regard
of days, we now in that time of Through Christ we have free liberty in
regard of the observation of days, excepting only the Lords day


It is that which the Apostle finds blameworthy in the Galatians, Gal. 4.10.
That they observed days, and months, and times, and years. Yea, he says in
the verse following that he was afraid of them, lest he had bestowed his labor
then in vain; in that they did turn again to those Jewish observations; and
he insists in the observation of days, and times, and years, but that we
mistake not the Apostles meaning, his speech being general.

Know we that he condemns not there the natural observation of days and
times, as the observation of day and night, summer and winter, harvest and
seed-time, nor yet the civil observation of times, as the time of planting,
setting, sowing, and plucking up that which is planted, spoken of, Eccles. 3.2.
But he reprooues them for their observation of days and times, as a thing to
which they thought they were bound in conscience, and as out of holiness, that
the Apostle deals against as opposite and contrary to the liberty of
Christians.

Romans 14.6. The Apostle says, He that observes the day observes it in the
Lord, Therefore we may now in time of the Gospel observe a day unto the Lord,
as a part of religion and his worship?



That we now under the Gospel are not bound in conscience to a religious
observation? of one set day above another, except only the Lords Sabbath.
Confuation of Popish festival days urged by the Papists as necessary to be
observed.
which they urge on men, and bind their consciences with the necessary
observation of them: they teach that the sanctification and keeping of their
appointed feasts is necessary, how then can they free themselves from the brand
of such teachers as the Apostle deals against in this verse, even such as
bind the conscience when they ought not, and charge men with sin unjustly.



sort of clothing, and for pride does inuest himself with a suit of a newer
fashion, every man knows he puts not away his pride, but only changes his
fashion: so the Papists do but change from one suit of sin to another, they
keep not the same feasts that the Jews did, but they have new feasts in
their steed, and those full of gross superstition, for they hold the
observation of them necessary, yea part of Gods worship, and place greater
holiness in those feasts then in the Lords Sabbath, and dedicate many of them
to the honor of Saints and Martyrs, that they may be pertakers of their
merits, and helped by their prayers. Now what is this, but most gross and
abominable Idolatry, and we must needs in this respect hold them in the
number of false teachers.

But may some say,

Answ: John 10.22. We read there was the feast of Dedication at Jerusalem,
which was a feast ordained by the Church, in the time of Judas Machabaeus, as
we find 1. Match, 4.59. in remembrance of the reparation of the Temple, and
deliverance from the tyrranny of Antiochus, and verse 23. Christ himself was
present at the feast, and by his presence he has given manifest allowance of
this. that the Church may appoint festival days, and being appointed, we may
observe them; yet know how the Church may appoint, and how we may observe them
being appointed, (namely) with these cautions.

First, How the Church may appoint and how we may observe festival days.
if the appointment and observation of them be held as a thing indifferent,
not of absolute necessity.

Secondly, if it be void of superstition, neither placing the worship of God,
nor any force of Religion in that observation of them, nor with any opinion of
holiness in those times, but that the appointment of them, be for the assembly
of Gods people, for the exercise of the word and prayer.

Thus may the Church appoint festiuities, and being so appointed we may
observe them, and thus does the Church of England observe holy days and no
otherwise and therefore the Brownists either ignorantly, or maliciously do us
wrong, in demanding whether our feasts be the true worship of God or no, in
their printed questions, for we place no worship of God in them (but that by
the way.

We see how the Church may appoint festiuities, and how we may observe them
and yet this is still a certain truth that we now in time of the Gospel are
not bound in conscience, and necessarily to the religious observation of days,
except only the Sabbath day, and not to pass from this without some word of
exhortation.

Is it so, that we now in time of the Gospel through Christ have this liberty,
that we are not tied in conscience

Then let us not forgo this liberty, and now make our selves slaves to
certain days, We are not to make our selves slaves to certain days.
and that after the manner of the very heathen.



I answer, Ier. 10.2. Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid for
the signs of heaven; fear not the signs of heaven, if we fear them
certainly we fear not God. Therefore let us take heed of this, let us hold
fast our liberty in respect of days purchased by Christ, and use it with good
conscience, remember thou art set free by Christ, from the observation of any
Jewish feast, therefore keep thou every day a Christian feast.

How is that may some say?

I will tell thee in a word; Exodus 35.3. But as it is a day of rest with some,
more liberty in regard of things either of present necessity as the quenching
of a fire having taken hold on an house, or of lawful conuenience, as
preparing of frugall meat and diet, out of the public exercise, or without
hinderance of it; That the Sabbath is moral and perpetual, proved.
as it is thus a day of rest set apart for the service of God, only in the
exercises of religion, and works of mercy and love: so it is moral and
perpetual, I might prove this by many arguments, consider we only these two.

Adam in Paradise before the fall, and therefore doubtless it is moral and
perpetual, for he then needed not any ceremony to lead him to Christ, he
needed not to believe in Christ, having not sinned.



We must not only abstain from open profanation of the Sabath, but we must
also take heed that we rest not in a ceremonial use of it.
let us not then only abstain from open profanation, by eating, drinking,
and immoderate feeding, or whatsoever may make us unfit for the service of God
in the duties of Religion. But let us take heed that we rest not in the
outward and ceremonial use of the Sabbath, which is a thing too common amongst
men: many come to the Church and hear the word, and go home again without
any profit by it; yea, with much hurt to their souls: they keep the Sabbath
only for fashion, not with any regard of true godliness, Note.
never laboring by the use of the Sabbath to grow in love toward God, or
tender affection toward men, for that is the true keeping of the Sabbath.

Now then to stir us up to be more careful hereafter of this duty, consider
only these two things.

James, 2.10. That he that has commanded one thing has commanded another,
and break one commandment of God, and be guilty of all: therefore he fears
the breach of every Commandment of God.

Again, call to mind what the Lord says in the end of

VER. 17. Which are but a shadow of things to come: but the body is in Christ.
This verse has respect to the verse immediately foregoing as a further
confirmation of it by a new argument, and in it is also couched an answer to a
secret exception, that false teachers might take against the Apostles
conclusion in the verse before; for happily they might except against him, and
say: is not the choice of meats, and observation of solemn feasts, new moons,
and the use of other ceremonies among the Jews, a thing commanded of God, why
then should they be neglected?

To this the Apostle does infold an answer in the words of this verse, and it
is this. That they were indeed commanded of God, but only to this end, to
shadow out Christ to come, and at his coming to cease and have an end; and so
the Apostles argument for confirmation of his conlusion is here taken from the
end and use of the ceremonies of the Law, and may thus beframed.

The Ceremonies of Moses Law were appointed by God to prefigure and shadow out
Christ to come.

Therefore Christ being now exhibited and come in the flesh there is no more
use of these ceremonies they have ended their office in Christ.

In this Verse more specially we have,



but the body is in Christ.

Interpretation.
Come we to consider the words of this Verse, (Which) (that is) which ceremonies
before mentioned, and all other of like sort. (A shadow) This word shadow is a
word of similitude or comparison and the meaning is a type or resemblance
figuring and showing things to come, and the legal Ceremonies are thus
compared to a shadow, especially in two respects,





(But the body is in Christ) The words are, but the body is of Christ, the
meaning is, but Christ is the body of those shadows (that is) the substance
and truth of them, because he did truly perform and exhibit those things
which they shadowed* thus then briefly conceive we the words of this verse,
as if the Apostle had said.

Which ceremonies before spoken of and all other of like sort, are but an
obscure resemblance, and being taken by themselves are but an empty show of
Christ to come, and of the mysteries and benefits of Christ, Christ is the
substance and truth of them, he truly performing and exhibiting those things
which they did prefigure and shadow out.

Now first the Argument here used by the Apostle is to be considered in that
he reasons thus.

That the end and use of legal ceremonies was to shadow out Christ to co come.
And therefore Christ being now come, there is no more use of them it plainly
teaches us the abrogation of the use of all significant and shadowing
ceremonies of Mosos Law, that by Christ his coming and death all ceremonies of
figure and signification are abrogated and taken away in regard of the use of
them. All significant and shadowing ceremonies of Moses Law are taken away by
Christ his death in regard of the use of them.


I say ceremonies of figure and signification for some were of order, and may
be used without binding the conscience to the necessary use of them. And
again, I say, in regard of the use of them, for as those ceremonies are set
down in the books of the old testament they are part of the written word of
God and may still instruct us concerning Christ his coming suffering death,
and the many and great fruits of it: but in regard of the use and observation
of them they are quite abrogated and we now in time of the Gospel are free
from the observation of any Jewish ceremony, being a figure of Christ to come,
yea, now the use and observation of Jewish ceremonies is a thing not arbitrary
and left to us as indifferent, but it is utterly unlawful, and that is
plainly taught Heb. throughout but specially 9.10.11.12. in the 10. verse it
is said, that the service of the old Testament only stood in meats and
drinks, and diverse washings, and carnal rites until the time of reformation,
when was that time? it is expressed in the verse following (namely) the time of
Christ his coming but Christ being come, an high Priest of good things to come
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands (that is) not of
this building. Neither by the blood of goats and calves: but by his own blood
entered he in once unto the holy place, and obtained eternal redemption for us
Gal. 5.2. the Apostle was bold to tell the Gala^hians and he speaks it with
authority setting his own name before it, that the use of circumcision would
prove most dangerous unto them, behold I Paul say unto you, that if ye be
circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

Paul himself circumcised Timothy.





To this I answer, Solomon's temple it was a thing indifferent, it was a
ceremony dead, but not buried, and so was it used by the Apostle as a thing
indifferent, but after the destruction of the Temple, when the Church of the
new testament was planted, then was it a deadly ceremony utterly unlawful. And
therefore wickedly, Discovery of the injurious dealing of the Papists in
loading their followers with a mass of ceremonies.
taken partly from the Gentiles, and partly from the Law of Moses, their mass
which they account the marrow of religion, is nothing but a mass of Jewish
ceremonies, and therein they lay on men's necks an intolerable yoke so called,
Act. 15.10. yea, therein they show themselves to be led with the spirit of
Antichrist, such a spirit as John speaks of, 1. Ioh. 4.3. in effect denying
Christ to be come in the flesh, we must remember that we are now set free from
the use of Jewish ceremonies; we now are not to worship God in outward
sacrifices and ceremonies, but in Spirit and truth, even in spiritual worship
and service.

The next thing offered unto us from this verse is this, that the Apostle in
describing the legal ceremonies, uses this comparison, that they are but
shadows: Hence we are plainly taught thus much.

That the significant ceremonies of the Law were only The significant
ceremonies of Moses law were only obscure resemblances and empty shadows of
Christ and his benefits.
and by themselves but empty shadows of Christ, and the benefits of Christ.
Christ was only shadowed out by them in the time of the old Testament. Christ
his grace and benefits were not given by the very sacrifices and ceremonies of
the Law but they that used them were to have an eye to the body of them
(namely) Christ, hence it is that the people of God were often reproved by the
Prophets in using of those sacrifices because they rested in the use of them,
as if by the very offerings of a sacrifice their sins had been taken away,
and in their offering they had not an eye to the body they looked not at the
true perfect sacifice of Christ, whereof those sacrifice were only a shadow
the Lod therefore says, Isai. 1.11.12.13. what have I to do with the
multitude of your sacrifice, I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and of
the fat of fed beasts, and I desire not the blood of bullockes, nor of lambs,
nor of goats.

When you come to appear before me, who required this of your hands to tread
in my courts?

Bring no more oblations in vain: incense is an abomination unto me: I
cannot suffer your new moons nor Sabboths nor solemn days (it is iniquity)
nor solemn assemblies. What is the reason of it? it is given ver. 15. in the
end for your hands are full of blood, as if he had said, when you offer these
sacrifices, you rest in your outward service, as if the very offering of it
were sufficient to confer my grace upon you, you look not by faith to the
one true perfect sacrifice, and that is manifest because you do not testify
your faith by the fruits of it, you still continue in your sins, and so your
sacrifices are abominable in my sight, I cannot endure them, Hebr. 10.1. the
holy Ghost says in plain terms, that the Law had the shadow of good things
to come, and not the very image of the things.

Here then comes a question to be handled (namely) this.

What difference there is between the sacracraments of the old testament and
our Sacraments of the new testament,

The Papists in answer to this question say, that the Sacraments of the old
testament did only signify and shadow out grace to be given afterward by the
passion of Christ, ex opere operato by the very work done; this is a mere
untruth, and a difference devised by themselves, that we therefore may assign
a right difference between them, we must first know that that the Sacraments
of the old testament, were both ceremonies and sacraments. Ceremonies as signs
of the Messiah to come, and sacraments as seals of the righteousness by faith
having the word of promise adioined to them the Lord promising in his word that
by those signs he would offer, apply, seal up and confirm grace in the righ
users of them.

The true answer.
Now then for answer to the question, as the Sacraments of the old testament,
were ceremonies, so there is a maine difference between them and our
sacraments, for so they are only resemblances of things to come having no word
of promise annexed unto them as our sacraments have, but as they were
sacraments, so there is no essential differenee between them and our
sacraments, No maine difference between the sacraments of the old Testament
and our sacraments.
they did signify and seal up the same grace and righteousness to salvation
and life eternal, that ours do, therefore the Apostle calls circumcision the
seal of the righteousness of the faith, which Abraham had when he was
uncircumcised, Romans 4.11.1. Corinth. 10.3.4. he says that the fathers in the
old testament did eat the spiritual meat, and did drink the same spiritual
drink, for they drank of the same spiritual rock, that we do in our
Sacraments (namely) Christ and so in substance there is noe difference between
their sacraments and ours, yet know that the sacraments of the old Testament
and our differs, and that in three things. The sacraments of the old testament
meant and ours diss^r further in three things


First, in outward signs and rites.

Secondly the Sacraments of the old testament did foreshew Christ to come.

Ours are visible declarations of Christ already come.

Thirdly, our Sacraments do more plainly and fully set Christ and his death
before us then did theirs.

For as in the new Testament, the means of revelation is more clear, the
light of faith greater, and the measure of grace more ample, so also by the
sacraments of the new Testament is the grace of Christ more plainly and fully
and plentifully offered and dispersed then by the sacraments of the old
testament.

Now this we are to consider. Is it so that the grace of Christ, is not now
set before us in obscure shadows,

Then let it shame us to be behind them of the old testament, in knowledge,
in faith, and in sound and comfortable apprehension and application of the
grace of Christ. It is a shame for us to be behind them that lived in time of
the old testament in knowledge, in faith, and in sound receiving of the grace
of Christ.


Heerin many are much defective, many have no understanding of the grace of
Christ, so plainly set before them in the sacraments, as if Christ were yet
in crucifying, and as if his blood were now dropping from his body in their
sight; yet many that come to the Lords table, see it not, nor have any
apprehension of the grace that is offered. And what is the cause? Surely, that
is one cause which our Savior has given Ioh. 3.19. we love dowes rather then
the substance, we are so wedded to the vanishing pleasures and fading profits
of this world, which are but shadows that we cannot see, much less affect
the true substance of grace in Christ.

Well, let us remember what our Savior says in that place, this is the
condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather
then light, so certainly we may justly fear, that this will be to our
deeper condemnation, that the truth and substance of the old shadows is come
into the world, and yet we rather love the shadows of pleasure and worldly
profits then this enduring substance, therefore our judgment and condemnation
shall be the greater.

All sacrifices propitiatory are now ended in Christ.
they are now needles, yea, they are pernicious, because Christ his perfect
sacrifice is succeeded in stead of all legal sacrifices, they being weak and
insufficient to take away sin, Christ by his one offering has made perfect
them that are sanctified, so says the Author to the Hebrews, Heb. 10.14. and
this discovers to us, that the The sacrifice of the mass is a most
abominable idol.
they please themselves in the shadow when they may have the true substance,
for they teach that Christ is still offered under the forms of bread and wine,
after an unbloody manner, which a is most gross, senceles and dangerous
heresy.

Let us remember that Christ his sacrifice on the cross, We are to cleave by
faith to the infinite and eternal merit of Christ his sacrifice on the cross.
substance and truth of all the old sacrifices, and so all expiatory
sacrifices are ended in that, and let us by faith only cleave to the infinite
and eternal merit of that one perfect sacrifice, as the only propitiation for
all our sin, and then we shall be sure to find remission of sins, peace
with God in this life, and eternal comfort with him in the life to come.

VER. 18. Let no man at his pleasure bear rule over you, by humbleness of
mind, and worshipping of Angels, advancing himself in those things, which he
never saw, rashly puffed with his fleshly mind.
In this verse the Apostle comes to deal against the corruption of religion
and means of seducement, and drawing away from the truth fetched from
philosophia, and the vain speculation of certain Enthusiasts (that is) such
as pretended heavenly visions and revelations, and he does insist in one
particular, which such false teachers labored to thrust on the Colossians
(namely) the religion or worship of Angels. Now the Apostles manner of dealing
against this is as it was before ver. 16. (namely) by way of dehortation, that
the Colossians should not suffer any to corrupt them with the religion or
worship of Angels, that is the general matter of this verse. The generell
matter of this verse.


In the manner of delivering of it more specially, The manner of delivering of
that matter.
two things are offered to our consideration.

First a disswasion from suffering false teachers to draw them away to the
worship of Angels.

Secondly, a description of such false teaehers.

And in both these are couched and contained arguments of refutation to repel
that false doctrine of the worship of Angels.

The disswasion is in these words (let no man at his pleasure bear over you by
humbleness of mind and worshipping of Angels) wherein is laid before us.

Let no man bear rule over you, or let no man defraude you: with the manner,
how false teachers sought to bear rule over the Colossians (namely) after
their own will and pleasure.

humbleness of mind (by humbleness of mind) for so (as I take it) those two
things are to be conceived and distinguished in the purpose of the Apostle.

That the one was the thing whereby false teachers labored to bear rule over
the Colossians.

And the other, the means used to persuade them unto it.

The description of false teachers, what they were, is in the words following.

(Advancing himself in those things which he never saw.)

(Advancing himself in those things which he never saw.

rashly puffed up with fleshly mind.

Now the arguments included in this disswasion and description to refell the
false doctrine of the worship of Angels, are especially these two.

First, that such worship is most dangerous, if they should embrace it, it
would be a means to draw them from Christ, to defraude them of their price,
and to bring them into thrall and bondage to the corrupt wills of men.

Secondly, that such worship is not built on any good ground, but thrust out
from the vain speculation of men taking on them the knowledge of things they
never saw, and that through the vain pride of their own fleshly minds.

Come we to the words of this verse, and first, Interpretation.
of the disswasion (Let no man at his pleasure bear rule over you, by
humbleness of mind, and worshipping of Angels) We find but one word in the
original, here translated (bear rule over you) and for the understanding of
it, we must know that the heathens in their games and public exercises of
wrestling, and the like; had some that used to sit as vmpires to give to them
that did best the reward of a garland, a crown, or some such thing. Now the
word here used is Metaphorical, and it is taken from the corrupt and unjust
dealing of such vmpires, who no doubt sometimes defrauded them of the prise,
that deserved it. From such unjust dealing of such vmpires is the word here
borrowed, and it signifies after the manner of unjust vmpires to defraude men
of the prise that is due to them: the meaning is to draw them from Christ, and
so to defraude them of eternal life and salvation, due unto them, in, and
through him (at his pleasure) that is, according to his own lust, without any
reason at all (by humbleness of mind) the meaning of it is not, by true
humbleness of mind, for that is an exellent grace and virtue: but by a
counterfeit show of it, under a color of humbleness of mind (and worshipping
of Angels) the words are (religion of angels) and the meaning is, by religious
adoration, or invocation of Angels, thus then we are to conceive the meaning
of this diswasion.

Let no man according to the lust of his own heart without any ground at all
by his false opinions draw you from Christ, and defraude you of the prise of
eternal life due to you in him: and that by persuading you under a color of
humbleness of mind to the invocation and worship of Angels. Now first,
observe we here that the Apostle was not content with his former disswasion,
Verse 16. Let no man therefore condemn you in meat and drink, or in respect
of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days. But he subioines
this to it as needful also, Let no man at his pleasure bear rule over you by
humbleness of mind, and worshipping of Angels. Thereby giving us to
understand, that false teachers used not one kind of imposture to draw the
Colossians from the truth, but on while they urged circumsion, and the
observation of the legal Ceremonies to be needful to salvation: an other
while they magnified angels, and under a color of humbleness of mind, sought
to bring in the worship of Angels. Hence we may easily take up this conclusion.

Satan has many fair colored means to corrupt religion.
if he cannot by one subtilty prevail to overthrow or corrupt the true faith
of Christians, he can and will use another; and if that succeed not a third;
yea an infinite number of sleights to that purpose: he is the Dragon with seven
heads, Revel. 12, 3. (that is) having the fullness of all subtilty and craft.

We must arm our selves against many subtilties used by Satan to draw us from
the truth of religion.
we must not only be armed against the colored craft and subtiltilty of the
Papists, laboring to corrupt us with a show of Scripture, by addition,
detraction or some absurd gloss, misinterpreted by glorious titles of unity
and universality by lying sig es and wonders, and such like, but we must be
provided to withstand the sleight of such as seem to have the truth, and yet
under the color of a constitution of a Church, go about to undermine the
whole building of sound faith and religion: yea let us be circumspect and arm
our selves against the subtilty of Satan, under the show of great knowledge,
and profound learning, tendering to us strong points of doctrine, and dangerous
errors, some there be that in this respect are deluded and much deceived, let
them remember what they read, Revel. 2.24. profounditie and depth of learning
abused to broach error, is the very deepenes of satan. Let us therefore arm our
selves against it, and against all his subtilties, and that we do this let us
receive the truth in love of the truth, and testify our love by bringing
forth the fruits of it, and then no doubt we shall have the secret of the Lord
revealed unto us, as it is said, Psalm. 25.14. We shall be able to discern
between truth and error, and spy out the subtlety of Satan going about to
deceive us.

The next thing we are to observe in this diswasion is, that the Apostle says
not, Let no man seduce you by bearing rule over you by humbleness of mind,
and worshipping of Angels, but he sets out such seducement with the danger of
it, that it is like to prove a defrauding of them of the prise of eternal
life, let no man defraude you of the prise of eternal life and salvation due
unto him, in, and through Christ.

Hence are we taught how dangerous a thing it is to be It is a very dangerous
thing to be drawn away to any fundamental error. The doctrine explaned.
such as is the invocation and worship of Angels: men that are so sedused are
in danger thereby to lose eternal life; and that this doctrine be not
mistaken, I must of necessity a little futther explane it.

First therefore, I say it is dangerous to be drawn away to such an error as
is against the foundation, and does ouerturne any truth necessary to be
believed to salvation, as the unity of the Godhead, the trinity of persons,
that Jesus Christ is the only Savior of all Gods chosen, that we are redeemed
by him, that we are justified in the sight of God by faith, without works, and
such like.

Secondly, I say not, that such an one as is seduced and drawn away, shall
never come to life and salvation, but that he is in danger to lose eternal
life, for happily he may be drawn and fall into that error of weakness and
ignorance, it was the case of the Galatians, Gal. 1.6. I marvel that ye are so
soon removed away unto an other Gospel, from him that had called you in the
grace of Christ, and he may continue in it ignorantly for a time, and afterward
repent and be saved. Thus then conceive we the doctrine, that he that is drawn
away to any error, ouerturning the truth necessary to be known and believed
to salvation, is in great danger to lose eternal life, and to be damned
forever, for he may come to hold that error obstinately to the end, and then
he shuts himself out from all possibility of salvation. The Apostle says,
Gal. 5.4. Ye are abolished from Christ, whosoever are justified by the Law,
ye are fallen from grace. The meaning is, you that are of that erroneous
opinion, and hold it stiffly, that you are justified by the Law, you are
abolished from Christ, Christ is to you an empty and unprofitable Christ, and
then as Saint John says, 1. Ioh. 5.12. He that has the Son, has life; and
he that has not the son of God, has not life, he cannot come to be saved.

Information of judgment touching erroneous opinions held by some.
that all erroneous opinions are not damnable, the Apostles themselves for some
time, even till Christ was ascended into heaven, held an error touching the
establishment of the Kingdom of Israel by their Lord and master, Act. 1.5. yet
were they, even then, in the state of grace, and salvation, because they rested
on Christ, as the only Savior of the world, who should take away theit
sins, and bring them to everlasting life; as appears, Ioh. 5.68.69. And
therefore it is not every erroneous opinion that is damnable, but only such as
does ouerturne some fundamental truth necessary to be held to salvation, and
that held with obstinacy to the end, that shuts a man out from all hope of
salvation.

Again, is it so that seducement and drawing away into some fundamental
error is so dangerous, is it the hazard We are to beware of such as would
have us yield though but a little, to some fundamental error.
as to hold justification in the sight of God, partly by faith, and partly by
works. Let us do in this case, as the Apostle says, he did in the like. Gal.
2.5. Give no place to them by subjection not for an hour, no not for one
minute, if we do, we bring our selves in danger to lose eternal life; it is
thought by some, there may be a little yelding to the Papists in fundamental
points of religion, and so an union and mixture may be made of their Religion
and ours, which is a mere dream of carnal Gospellers and worldly politicians:
we must not yield from the least part of truth revealed necessary to salvation,
our yielding never so little from such a truth is most dangerous: the Lord may
give us up to go on, from one degree of error to an other, till we come to
hold a lie in the right hand, (that is) with obstinacy continue in it, and so
be damned. Let us therefore take heed of yielding any jot from a fundamental
truth, let us hold that more precious then the whole world.

Mark we further, the Apostle says, Let no man bear Such as are misled by
others, either into errors or sin, are held by them in a miserable thraldom.
Proof of the first.
according to his own corrupt lust, without any reason at all. See then the
fearful thraldom of such as are seduced by false teachers, they bear rule
over them at their pleasure, they lead them whither they list. I showed when I
stood on the 8. verse. that false teachers carry away the simple as a prey, and
use them at their pleasure, the Apostle has made it manifest, 2. Cor. 11.20.
where he says, The Corinthians suffered false teachers to use them at their
pleasure. Having handled that point, I will not now stand upon it, nor now
remember the use was made of it: but consider we the truth of this in an other
kind: as false teachers lead the simple into error, and hold them in it at
their pleasure; even thus do many wicked instruments of sin, such as are
means to draw others to sin, and to lead them to lust and lewdness, to
riot and unthrifty means, do not they lead them at their pleasure and hold
them in sin, as they list. Look one the example of Ahab, 1 King. 21.25. It
is there said, Proof of the second.
he sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, and that
Iezabel his wife provoked him, he was a slave to sin at the provocation of
Iezabell his wife.

Look again, Prou. 7.22. the whorish woman having entised the wanton young
man destitute of understanding, it is said, he followed her straight ways as
an ox that goes to the slaughter, and as a fool to the stocks for
correction. And not to seek far for examples, are there not many in the
world that are slaves to wicked instruments of sin, even to such as lead them
to drunkenness, filthynesse and many lewd courses, are they not ready to
attend them at their beck, and at their call to go whither they list to lead
them? yea, are they not ready to go with them when they will have them,
sometimes (which is able make any honest heart to to bleed) from the Church to
the Tavern, are there not such in the world? it is too evident, there be too
many. Well, my speech tends to this purpose, to let such as are thus led by
others to know, and see, in what a miserable thraldom they are, they will say
sometimes when they are dealt withal to put up any injury or wrong, they will
not be made fools for any man's pleasure, such an one shall not use them at his
pleasure, and they put it up and say nothing, and yet they can be content that
the Devil and his instruments should lead them to lewdness and sin at
their pleasure; yea to be held in the snare of the Devil at his will and
pleasure. Tim. 2.26.

Learn whosoever thou art, that art thus led by wicked instruments of Satan to
see and consider thy bondage, that thou art in a miserable thraldom, and
seeing it, to use all good means to hasten out of it; They that are led by
others to sin must take notice of their bondage and hasten out of it.
and for such as are means to draw others to sin: I say no more but this;
That as they are the Devils factors: so without great repentance they shall one
day be his partners, and their portion shall be with him that was the first
entier to sin, (that is) the Devil and his Angels in the bottomless pit of
Hell.

One thing more is offered to our consideration from the form of speech here
used (Let no man defraud you of your prise) It should have been spoken of
before, but it will not be amiss now to remember it; It is this, in that the
Apostle says, Let no man defraude you of your prise, meaning by the word
(prise) eternal life and salvation in, and through Christ.

Hence it is evident and plain that eternal life is proposed Eternal life is
set before us in the Scripture as a prise.
it is made known to us in the Scripture, to be as a garland, or a crown
that is wont to be given to such as run well in a race, or such as wrestle
well, or the like, 1. Cor. 9.24. They which run in a race, run all, yet one
receives the prise: so run that ye may obtain, meaning the prise of
eternal life, and verse 25. he says, but we for an incorruptible crown,
(that is) for an incorruptible crown of life and salvation, Phil. 3.14. says
the Apostle, I follow hard toward the mark, for the prise of the high calling
of God in Jesus Christ (that is) to that heavenly glory, to which God calls all
his elect in Christ. Now the reason, eighth verse he subioyns, henceforth is
laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge
shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that
love his appearing, he says not, therefore I have deserved the crown of
righteousness, but that the Lord the righteous judge should give it to him at
that day.



I answer

That the Lord does crown true believers, bringing forth the fruits of
holiness and righteousness with the reward of eternal life, and that
justly, or as a just judge, not in regard of the merit of those works, but in
respect of his own free promise in Christ, having bound himself by his his
promise to give them the reward of eternal life, he is just in performance
of the

In doing good duties we may law^ully respect the promised reward.
We see* it then made clear, that eternal life is proposed and set before us as
a prize.

And this being so, hence it follows that we may lawfully have respect unto
it in doing good, it is warrantable by the word of God to have an eye upon
the promised reward in performance of good duties, for if it be lawful to
abstain from sin for fear of eternal punishment in hell, (as it is) we are
so taught, Matthew. 10.28. then it is also lawful to do good, with respect of
eternal reward, the Papists they charge us to teach that men may not do good
with respect to any reward; A Popish slander.
but they slander us it is our constant doctrine, that we may yet, understand
we this doctrine aright, we may in doing good have respect unto the
recompense of reward, so as we do it not only or principally in that
respect, in doing good we are chiefly to mind and respect Gods glory, How in
doing good we may have respect to the recompense of reward.
and the discharge of our duty, and in the second place we may look for the
promised reward.

To mind the recompense of reward only or principally is the property of a
mercenary hireling, and proceeds from self love, in the duties of religion or
love to all men.

We are to look first and principally after Gods glory, and the discharge of a
good conscience in doing our duty, and then we may lawfully have an inferior
and secondary respect to the recompense of reward. Again, is eternal life
proprosed and set before us as We are ever to have our eyes fixed upon the
crown of glory in doing good duties.
after we are come to the end of our race, then our duty is ever to have our
eye upon it, we are ever to fix our eyes, I mean, the eyes of our minds
upon that crown of glory and bliss that is prepared for all them that love
the appearance of Christ: and this is a duty of excellent use, it will make us
run with patience and comfort the race, that is set before us and make us hold
out and persevere in the fear of God amidst the trobles and miseries of this
life: yea, in the midst of many violent assaults and temptations of Satan. It
is said, Heb. 11.26. That Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ greater riches
then the treasures of Egypt: and what was the reason? because (says the text)
he had respect to the recompense of reward, and Heb. 12.2. it is said, that
Christ himself endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set at the
right hand of the throne of God, and why? for the joy that was set before him,
so certainly, such as are the members of Christ, looking up to the joy and
glory that after a while they shall enjoy, it will make them endure with
patience any cross, and despise and set light by any shame that the world can
throw upon them, though the mouths of wicked men be opened wide against them,
and load them with many opprobrious speeches, yet will not they be moved, but
esteem them as the speeches of idle lookers on, and give them leave to speak
and still hold on their holy course with a right foot in the race toward
heaven, let us therefore ever remember to lift up the eyes of our minds, and
fasten them on that glory that hereafter shall be revealed, this duty was
never more needful to be often urged, then now in these days wherein the
greatest part have their minds groueling and poring on the things of this
world, and have no view, no not so much as a glimps of that eternal weight of
glory that shall be revealed, yea, even such as profess religion and the fear
of God, begin to cast their eyes aside, and to look with too much delight on
the things of this world; and to mind earthly things too much; well, let such
as with Demas embrace this present world, and are ever poring on the things of
it, know, that it is a thousand to one, that the sight of eternal glory shall
then fail them, when they have most need of comfort by it, even in the day of
death, and in the hour of temptation, they may then happily seek for the
sight of it, and not find it, but insteede of it, have the sight of the
torments of hell to be ready for to cease upon them.

Let such also that fear God and begin to look aside on the things of this
world, know it will be hard even for them to hold out in says, and in the
fear of God in time of trial, remember the example of David, he was a man
that had spent much time in traveling toward Heaven, yet looking but a little
aside upon the glittering show of this world, had very near lost his way, his
feet were almost gone; his steps had well near slipped, Psalm. 37.2.

Let us therefore be stirred up ever to keep our eyes fixed on the mark, and
to look to the prise of eternal life that we may be able to run the race
that is set before us with patience and comfort, and hold out in faith, and in
the fear of God in the greatest trial and temptation; yea, in the very point
of death, we know not how soon the Lord may bring us into the trial.

The next thing we are led to consider by the order of this disswasion, is the
means that false teachers used to persuade to the worship of Angels, which was
the counterfeit show and color of humility for so we expounded those words (by
humbleness of mind) which may be further explained thus.

That false teachers used both an hypocritical show of humility in themselves,
in their speeches and behavior, and vfed also a colored argument taken from
humility to persuade to the worship of Angels.

I will only note one thing, from hence we shall have more fit occasion to
speak of counterfeit humility verse 23.

Hence then observe we, that it is an ancient practice of It is an old practice
of Satan under color of virtue to draw men to sin.
he labored to draw the Colossians to the worship of Angels under a show of
humility, by arguing and reasoning from humility,; no doubt after this or the
like manner; the Majesty of God is most holy and most glorious, and therefore we
being dust and ashes, sinful creatures, ought not to approach unto him, or
crave any thing at his hands immediately without the intercession of some that
are more pure and nearer to God, and may prevail more with him then we our
selves, and such be the Angels, therefore make them your spokesmen, and
intercessours to God for you, thus in all liky-hood they labored to persuade
the Colossians to the worship of Angels. Thus do the Papists at this day, oh
say they, it is boldness and presumption in you to go to God in prayer, be
humble, go to God by means of Saints and Angels, I note this in a word to
this purpose.

It is not always lawful that is tendered unto us under the color of good.
but sometimes it is wicked and sinful, for example, to consult with a
witch, a sorcerer or charmer, is a thing tendered by the Devil under the
color of much good and no harm at all in it; as forsooth, it is good to have
things that are lost again, and to be cured of a disease, and it is done by
good words and good prayers and the like.

Thus does the Devil delude many in the world and thrust on them, that which
is wicked and sinful, under a semblance and show of great good.

Ob.
But are not the words of Scripture good will some say?



What better words can there be, then such as express the praise of God, yet
such words may be wicked, being abused, 1. Sam. 23.2^. it was Saul's sin, when
the Ziphims to curry favor with him, came to betray David to him, and to
discover where he was that Saul might take him; he breaks out into praise and
thankesgiuiuing to God, for that their wickedness, and says, be ye blessed,
or blessed be God for you, a most wicked thing was it in Saul thus to praise
God, yet were his words good.

Let not then the Devil delude us, and under the color of good draw us to
evil, though the words be good, yea, the words of the Sctipture, and though
the prayer be the Lords prayer, yet being used to effect that for which there
is no reason, either in nature or in the word of God, rhey become evil, and
though the Lord do suffer things to be done by such means, yet let us know it
is in judgment o a greater plague, men thereby come to prosper in sin, and
their hearts are made more hard and incureable.

Come we to the thing that false teachers labored to thrust on the Colossians,
which was the worship of Angels.

Hence we are taught, that the worship of Angels is utterly The worship of
Angels is utterly unlawful.
and that we mistake not the point, we must know that there is a reverence
due to the good Angels (namely) a reverence of love, not of service, religious
worship and service is only due to God, The doctrine explained.
not to any creature, Saint or Angel, therefore the Angel forbids John to
worship him, and bids him worship God, Revel. 19.10. the Papists they give
divine honor and adoration to the Angels, yea, It is a wicked superstition to
make Angels intecessors between God and us as the Papists do.
and to make them intercessors between God and them which is a wicked
superstition here condemned by the Apostle, we are to renounce it, and to hold
us only to the mediation and intercession of Jesus Christ, and in him alone
offer up our prayers to God, and not in the name of any other.

And to strengthen us in this truth, that in the mediation of Christ alone, we
are to offer up our prayers to God, consider briefly these reasons.

Reasons proving the mediation of Christ alone.

First, we read 1. Tim. 2.5. that Christ is the only Mediator between God
and man, and therefore in his name only are we to pray unto God.

The Papists say, Christ indeed is the only Mediator of redemption, but
Angels an Saints are Mediators of intercession, which distinction is flat
against the plain evidence of the Scriptures.

We are taught, Heb. 7.24. that Chrlst hrs Priesthood is everlasting, and one
part of honor belonging to his Priesthood is to make intercession as follows,
ver. 25. and To. 8. the Apostle says in plain words, that Christ sits at
the right hand of God, to make request for us, therefore this distinction
cannot stand with the truth of Gods word.





Other reasons might be added, but these, I hope, may suffice to confirm us
in this truth. I will briefly answer a doubt that happily may arise in the
minds of some.

Romans 8.26.27 the Apostle says, The Spirit it self makes request for the
Saints, according to the will of God.

To this I answer,

Again, we are to mark, verse the 27. it is said that the spirit makes
request for the Saints according to the will of God, the meaning is, he
teaches men to pray, according to Gods will; he teaches both what, and how
to pray, and so this doubt is cleared.

Come we to the description of false teachers, what they were.

And first, they are described by their boldness, that Advancing himself in
those things which he never saw.

Secondly, by the root of that (namely) the vain pride (rashly puffed up with
his fleshly mind.)

For the first of these, I will first clear the words; the word translated
(advancing) does properly signify boldly, Interpretation.
setting his foot upon an other man's possession, without al right and title,
thrusting himself into the possession of that belongs not unto him, the
meaning is after the manner of an intruder thrusting himself into the
knowledge, or taking on him the knowledge and determination (in those things
which he never saw) (that is) those things he never saw with the eye of his
body, nor yet by the eye of faith, for faith is of things not seen by the eye
of the body Heb. 11.1. our Savior says to Thomas, Ioh. 20.29. Blessed are
they that have not seen, and have believed, yet is faith of things revealed
and made known in the written word of God, and so the Apostles meaning, in
saying (in those things which he never saw) is, in those things he never saw,
either by the eye of his body, or by the eye of faith.

Thus then we are to conceive these words, as if the Apostle had said.

As an intruder boldly thrusting himself into the knowledge, and taking on him
the knowledge of things he never saw, either by the eye of his body, or by
the eye of faith, made known in the written word of God, even of things whereof
he has no testimony, either from experience, or from Scripture, but are such
as are either devised by himself, or had by some fantastical revelation.

I might here stand to show, that the worship of Angels is a thing merely
devised, and a thing invented and thrust out from the vain wit of some men who
took on them to know things concerning the Angels, for which they had no
warrant, either from experience, or from the the word of God, but I hold it not
needful to stand on that point, I will rather speak of the general
conclusion offered from this part of the description of false teachers, that
they were such as did advance themselves in things they never saw.

It it the property of a false teacher, or take upon him the knowledge of
things not revealed unto him.
a false teacher, will not stick boldly and confidently to auerre things he
never saw, nor learned out of the written word of God, he is such an one as the
Lord speaks of, Ezekiel. 13.3. That follows his own spirit, and has seen
nothing (that is) has had nothing revealed to him from the Lord.

The boldness of the papists.
It were easy to give instance in many examples of old; but not to stand long
on this, the teachers among the Papists at this day, do sufficiently clear
this to be a truth, they dare take on them the knowledge of many things not
revealed: as of the order of the heavenly Angels, they dare boldly tell you
there is an hierarchy of the Angels in heaven, and there be such and such
orders of them, they dare take on them to know and determine what several
rooms, what distinct places there be in Hell, as that there is besides the
place of the damned, Limbus patrum, and Limbus infantum, and Purgatory, and I
know not what. And these, and the like, they avouch with great boldness, as if
they had seen them with their eyes; and yet are they never able to prove them
by any eye witness, or by any testimony of Scripture.

See then and consider, how far men go, when it Men go far in error when
Gods gives them up unto it.
they run to a fearful height, even to avouch with boldness, that which they
cannot warrant, either from their own experience, or from the written word of
God.

And by this also take knowledge of it, that not only They are led with a
spirit of error, who rest in idle visions and dreams or private illumination
of the Spirit.
such as take on them the knowledge of some things without the word, by private
illumination, they also are carried with a spirit of error, and we are to avoid
them as deceivers. Isay 8.20. to the law and to the testimony, says the Lord,
and if men speak not according to this word, it is because their is no light
in them. Let men therefore pretend, what light, what knowledge, or illumination
they will, yet if it be not according to the written word of God, it is no
true light and illumination, but a devilish Satanicall illusion, and if any
such be tempering with us, we are to avoid them as deceivers.

In the next place, in that the Apostle does thus describe a false teacher, and
tax him to be one that does advance himself, and take on him the knowledge of
things he never saw.

We may easily gather, that it is a fault to thrust our It is a fault to
thrust our selves into the knowledge of things not revealed.
and curiosity is to be avoided, which is a bold seeking, and looking into
things not revealed, either in the word, or by any event, that is, to presume
to understand above that which is meet, contrary to the rule of the Apostle,
Romans 12.3. Let no man presume to understand above that which is meet to
understand, but let him understand according to sobriety. Yea, that is to take
on us to rush on into Gods closet, and to set foot as it were into his
Several, even to thrust our selves into the knowledge of his secret will,
which he has hedged in, and kept several to himself and will not have us
thrust our selves into the searching of it, Deuteronomy. 29.29. The secret things
belong to the Lord our God, they are his peculiar; but the things revealed
belong to us, and to our children for ever. It was the fault of the Apostles,
Act. 1.6. When they would needs know, whether he would at that time restore
the kingdom to Israel? They received answer with a check, it is not for you
to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.
When Peter asked, Lord what shall this man do, Ioh. 21.21. he was answered
with a short reproof, verse 22. If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
that to thee, meddle not thou with that.

Reproof of such as curiously search into things not revealed and thrust
themselves into things breeding questions rather then godly edifying.
as to question what God did before he made the world, where Hell is, and what
parts are in hell, and the like: yea it is a fault to thrust our selves into
such things as breed questions, rather then godly edifying, the Apostle
condemns it, 1. Tim. 14. Give not heed to fables and genealogies which are
endless, and breed questions, rather then godly edifying which is by faith. We
are to avoid curious meddling, even with such things as may breed idle and
unprofitable questions: a thing too common in these days, many men to make
show of their knowledge, take delight to rush into such matters as may breed
questions, and such questions as tend not to build in love out of a pure heart
which is lawful and commendable; but to vain iangling, as the Apostle
speaks, even to quarrel and contention about names and titles, and things of
no moment, and so the Lord many times in his just judgment gives up such
persons to the vanity of their minds and suffers them to join hands with
Brownists, Familists, or some other schism, and in the end, they come to this
that it may be truly said of them which the Apostle said of some in his time,
1. Tim. 1.7. They would be Doctors of the Law, and yet understand not what they
speak, neither whereof they affirm they would make the world believe they
know more then other men, and see further into matters then others, and yet
understand not what they speak, and whereof they affirm: well let us labor
by all good means to know matters of faith and good conscience. (I speak not
against diligent searchers into the word of God,) but let us avoid all matter
of curious and needless questions, and if we will needs be quick sighted
and searching: let us be so in regard of our own sins and corruptions to find
them out, Wherein we are to be quick sighted and search
for who can understand his faults, Psalm. 19.12. and let us be so in regard
of the sleights of our spiritual enemies, that we may find out the temptations
of the world, the flesh, and the Devil: here is indeed matter of search and
enquiry, and herein we shall find matter enough to busy our heads, to
exercise our wits and so spend the best reach of our understandings upon.

Before I leave this point, I think it needful to remove an imputation that
is thrown upon us by the Papists, An imputation thrown upon us by the
Papists, removed.
they bend the force of this doctrine against us on this manner, say they, you
may be justly charged to be such, as thrust your selves into the knowledge of
things not revealed. Why so? because, say they, you take on you infallibly to
know that you are in the number of Gods chosen, and such as shall be saved:
Paul and some special men had, and therefore Paul might say, Romans 8.38. I am
persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come: verse. 39. nor height, nor
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Answ: by name, believe thou John, or thou Peter, and thou shall be saved, yet
it says, whosoever believes in the Son of God shall not perish, but have
everlasting life, John 3.16. Now, who is so simple that knows not the general
does comprehend the special, especially where there is a word of command to
apply, and the minister standing in the room of Christ as his ambassador, 2.
Cor. 5.20. to assure as many as believe, that they shall be saved.

Object:

Answ: We may, and ought, to search, when- we be in the state of grace, or no.
it is no presumption, we have the Apostles warrant for it, 2. Cor. 13.5.
Prove your selves whether you are in the faith, examine your selves, know ye
not your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates.
Therefore we may and we ought to search whether we be in the number of Gods
chosen or no, yet by direct means we are not to pry into Gods closet, or to
step up into heaven and search the roules of heaven, whether our names be
there written or no, but look thou into the closet of thine own heart, and see
if there thou find assurance of faith in the testimony of Gods spirit, bearing
witness with thy spirit that thou art the child of God, and the fruits of his
grace, and finding these things thou may, yea, thou ought to be fully
persuaded of it, that thou art in the number of Gods chosen, and let us not be
driven from this duty, it is the duty of every one thus to search whether he
be in the state of grace and salvation or no, that finding himself in that
state he may rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, or finding himself
not in that state he may use all good means with speed to come unto it.

Come we to the words following, wherein is set forth the root of that
boldness that was in false teachers (namely) the vain pride of their carnal
minds (rashly puffed up with his fleshly mind) where note we one thing in
general.

Hence it is clear, that the vain pride and windy conceit Boldness and
presumption comes from the vain pride and windy conceit of a carnal mind.
it is that which makes men take on them the knowledge of things not revealed,
yea, it is that which does thrust men into many bold actions, what a bold part
was it in Pharaoh and his host to follow after the Israelites into the sea?
whence came it? the text is plain, it came from a proud conceit, that they
could do what they list themselves Exodus 15.9. says Moses, The enemy said I
will pursue, I will overtake them, I will divide the spoil, my lust shall be
satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, mine hand shall destroy them. Thus
boasted railing Rabshaketh with many insolent words, 2. King. 18.27. and we
need not seek far, for examples to this purpose we may have them amongst
our selves, what is it (I beseech you) that makes such as live ignorantly and
wickedly, presume they shall die blessedly, and obtain life and salvation? is
it any other thing then a self conceit and vain imagination of a strong
faith? and whatsoever Preachers say to the contrary, that they are in a
damnable case, yet they through an empty conceit of their own, trust that God
will be more merciful then so, hope to be saved as well as the best, for so
commonly they speak, they dare be bold to equal themselves to the best; what
is it that makes men many times thrust themselves into reasoning of other men's
lives and actions unknown? is it not a proud conceit of themselves, that they
are not as other men? yea, we shall find if we do observe it, that in
relating other men's known sins, and upon just occasion there will be
sometimes a secret lifting up of our selves above them that are so faulty,
Note.
we are to take heed of it, and for use of the point.

The way to free our selves of presumption is to cast out pride and
self-conceit.
as that a blessed death shall close up a cursed life, let us therefore empty
our selves of all pride and high conceit of our selves, and to this end labor
to see thine own corruption and misery, the more thou see that, Note.
the more thou shall be humbled, thus it was with Paul Romans 7. none are more
proud and presumptuous then such as see not their own wretchedness, labor
thou to see the cursed corruption of thine own heart, and thy state by nature,
that thou art a child of wrath and perdition, yea, if thou be in the state
of grace, yet consider thou stand by grace, and have many infirmities, and
thou shall find it will be a notable means to cure pride, and to cast out all
high conceit of thy self and so keep thee from boldness and presumption.

Now let us proceed to a more special consideration of this part of the
description of false teachers, that they were such as were (rashly puffed up with
their fleshly mind) the word here rendered (rashly) may be translated
vainly, Interpretation.
for so it does properly signify now that may be understood two ways either
vainly without cause or matter at all, or vainly without fruit or profit,
so the word is used; Galat. 3.4. have ye suffered so many things in vain.
(that is) without fruit or profit, but here we are to understand the word
in the first sense, vainly (that is) without any cause, or matter at all, for
which they should be proud* (puffed up) this is a metaphorical and borrowed
speech, taken from a bag or bladder blown up with wind, to set out the
nature of pride, which is to lift uppe the heart, and to make it swell like a
bladder full of wind, and so the meaning is vainly proud (with his fleshly
mind) the words are with the mind of his flesh, the meaning is with his
carnal, corrupt and unregenerate mind, thus then conceive we these words as
if the Apostle had said.

Vainly, without cause or matter for which he should be so swelling and
proud through the corruption of his carnal mind.

Now first in that the Apostle says, rashly or vainly without cause or matter
proud we are plainly taught.

That there is sometimes a pride without any matter or Men are sometimes proud
of nothing, and their swelling imaginations go hand in hand with emptiness.
there is sometimes a pride upon a mere imagination and conceit of
something, when there is nothing; a poor pride as I may call it) a proud heart
in a poor breast, when upon a vain conceit men are proud of that they have
not; thus it was with the Church of Laodicea, Revel. 3.17, Thou say I am rich
and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and know not that thou
art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

Yea, pride and swelling imaginations commonly go hand in hand with emptines,





Reproof of such as are proud of grace and spiritual things which are not in
them.
for example many there be who are lift up with a conceit of faith they have
this opinion of themselves, that they believe in Christ, and take themselves to
be in very good case, and yet indeed come to the trial, and we shall find
they have not in them any dram of true faith; have they hearts enflamed with a
love to Gods glory? have they a fervent desire, that the name and glorious
Gospel of Christ, may be magnified? have they an earnest care of the good of
their brethren? does that care break out and show it self in actions tending
to that purpose? for these be infallible marks of true and lively faith; no,
no, these things are wanting and yet they swell with a conceit of true faith:
yea, some there be who having some measure of knowledge and grace and looking
on that through a false spectacle of self love do ouerween it, and are
conceited and proud of that measure that is not in them, and so are vainly
puffed up, and even they also are proud without any matter of pride at all.
Apostle that thou have not received? 1. Cor. 4.7. and that we may yet further
see the ugliness of this sin, and so be brought to an utter dislike and
detestation of it, The ugliness of pride discovered.
consider we both the causes of it and the fruits of it, without question, the
father of it is the Devil, and the mother of it is ignorance, therefore the
Apostle says, Romans 11.25. I would not brethren, that ye should be ignorant of
this secret; yea the mother of it is not ignorance natural or a mere absence of
knowledge, but affected and wilful ignorance, for if we did not wilfully shut
our eyes having any grace given us, we could not choose but see that grace to be
a free gift, and that we of our selves are to every good thing not only
insufficient, but even reprobate and repugnant, and that the gift we have is
imperfect, that we know but in part, and are sanctified but in part; and
touching the fruits of pride, they are most bitter and unsavory, it makes men
abuse their good gifts given to profit others, even to the scorn and contempt
of others, it is as a dead fly in the box of the sweet ointment of grace,
Eccles. 10.1. a proud person will never bend down to be serviceable to any,
he admits no familiarity with any, pride separates men from their brethren, 1.
Cor. 4.7. and that which is worst of all, proud swelling for any gift makes
odious in the sight of God, not only as other sins do, but after a special
manner, because it returns not that glory to God that is due to him, the proud
person takes the glory due to God to himself, and so stirs up the* Lord who is
jealous of his glory to wrath against him, and therefore was it truly said,
Pro. 16.18. pride goes before destruction, and an high mind before the fall,
it is an immediate forerunner of destruction.

Seeing then the father of pride is the Devil, the mother of it wilful and
affected ignorance, the fruits of it is abuse of good gifts, and a provoking of
the Lord to wrath, and that after a special manner to our downfall and
destruction, Let us take heed we be not put off, either with a conceit of
that is not in us, that we have faith when we have none, or for any gift of
grace bestowed upon us, ever remembering the words of the Apostle, what have
thou that thou have not received.

Mark we further, that the Apostle is not content to say that the false
teachers he speaks of were rashly puffed up, but he adds that their pride and
swelling was through the corruption of their carnal minds (rashly puffed up
with his fleshly mind.)

Pride comes from the corruption of the heart and mind.
Habak. 2.4. the Lord says in plain terms, he that lifts up himself, or
he that is puffed up, his mind is not right in him, his pride comes from the
corruption of his mind; David clearing himself of pride and of ambition, and
protesting his humility before the Lord, Psalm. 131.1. says, first of all, Lord
mine heart is not haughty, and then, neither are mine eyes lofty; neither have
I walked in great matters, and hid from me, giving to understand that the
cause of pride is haughtiness of heart, from the haughty heart come proud
looks and lofty eyes; the reason of this is plain (namely) this it is,

We must not suffer our hearts to settle on the good things we enjoy as
sufficient in themselves to do us good.
even from the hand that gave them? to make gold our hope, as Job speaks,
Job. 31.24. or to rest on any good thing as sufficient in it self to do us
good, is the very root of pride, when Nabuchadnezzar walking upon the top of
his palace, let his heart please it self in the consideration of his
greatness and dominion, then he brake out into that proud speech, Dan. 4.27.
is not this great Babel, that I have built for the house of the Kingdom, by
the might of my power, and for the honor of my Majesty? Yea. we shall find
that the dear servants of God have been thus overtaken, when they have
suffered their hearts to dwell upon the good things they enioied, when David
had overcome his enemies, and was settled in his throne, then looking with too
much delight on his own strength, he began to vaunt himself of the multitude
of his people, and must needs have them numbered, 2. Sam. 23.2. let it therefore
work on all theit hearts, whom the Lord has preferred above others in respect of
any condition or ability, such as have any gift of God either inward or
outward, be it riches or whatsoever it is, suffer not thine heart to dwell upon
it, for certainly if thou do, it will make thee proud, and to this purpose
consider we these two things.

First, Two reasons against suffering our hearts to settle on the good things we
enjoy.
consider the weakness and wants even of the best gifts themselves, how
unable they are they are to accomplish our desires unless a stronger power,
even the hand of God give strength unto them. For that which is said of bread,
that man lives not by bread only, and that it is not food received that does
nourish us, but the blessing of God upon it, may be truly said of all other
gifts.

Again, consider that in the matter of justification in the sight of God, no
excellency of any gift (be it faith it self) is of any moment, for faith does
not justify, for the dignity of it, but as an instrument apprehending that
which does justify.

The due consideration of these two things will be an excellent means to keep
our hearts from swelling in respect of any gift of God bestowed upon us.

One thing more is offered to our consideration from these words rashly puffed up
with his fleshly mind.

The word (flesh) in scripture signifies sometimes the corruption of the chief
family of the soul.
even of the mind and conscience, and hence it is very clear, that even the
mind and understanding not regenerate, is fleshly, therefore the Apostle says,
To. 8.7. the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject
to the Law of God neither indeed can be.

Which must needs be understood of the very best part of the soul, wherein
wisdom is seated, and Gal 5.20. the Apostle reckons heresy, which is an
error of the mind and understanding among the works of the flesh and
heerupon one speaks thus; says he, the Apostle ascribes those sins to the
flesh, Note.
which bear principal sway in the Devil, who certainly has no flesh, for
he says, enmity, contention, emulation, envy, are works of the flesh, the
head and fountain whereof is pride, which reigns in the Devil Confutation of
the Papists.
who teach that the word flesh in the Scripture opposed to spirit, signifies
only sensuality, and the corruption of the inferior parts of the soul, which
is slat against the plain evidence of this, and many other places of
Scripture. And we are to take knowledge of it, that We must labor especially
for the renouation of our minds.
as the Apostle exhorts, Ephesians. 4.23.

Yea, let us especially labor, for the renouation of our minds, the
darkness and ignorance in the mind brings forth nothing but sin, in all
the powers of the soul, and as before the fall the mind retained the chief
part of the image of God, Note
so now being corrupted it is most corrupt and the greater natural gifts of
mind we have, as wit, capac^ty, judgment etc. the fitter instruments we have
to increase in sin: therefore let us never rest till we find, by the use of
the good means that we are renewed in our minds.

VER. 19. And holds not the head, whereof all the body furnished and knit
together by ioints and bands increases with the increasing of God.
In this Verse, the Apostle does continue his description of false teachers,
such as labored to draw the Colossians away from the truth; and he further
sets them out to be such, as did not truly acknowledge, nor cleave to Christ
the head of his Church, in the first words (And holds not the head) and
having made mention of Christ under the word of similitude (head) he then
descends into a description of Christ, as he has relation and reference to
his mystical body the Church, as the head of it, and he describes him to be
as an head giving life and growth to his whole Church, and to every member of
it, (we taking these words together) whereof all the body increseth, as indeed
they are to be taken in the purpose of the Apostle, the words between them
(furnished and knit together by ioints and bands) are a declaration of the
quality and condition of that body to which Christ as an head gives life and
growth, that it is a body furnished and knit together by ioints and bands, as
if the words were read thus. Whereof all the body thus qualified (namely)
furnished and knit together by ioints and bands increases, in the last words
is specified what kind of growth and increase it is, that Christ as an head
gives to the body his Church, (namely) a divine and spiritual increase,
(increases with the increasing of God.

Come we to the words of this verse, Interpretation.
as they are laid down by the Apostle, And holds not the head (that is)
acknowlegeth not the head, nor cleaves to it in his doctrine for the Apostle
here speaks of false teachers, such as sought to bring in false doctrine of
the worship of Angels, and his meaning is, that they in that their doctrine did
not acknowledge nor cleave (as they ought) to the head, (that is) to Christ,
who is as an head to his Church: they did not acknowledge Christ to be the
only head, and cleave to him as the only head of the Church' (whereof) the
original words signify not (of which) with a reference to the word (head)
they are not (...), but (...) of whom with relation to Christ (all) (that is)
the whole body (namely) the Church, which is an one body consisting of many
members conioined in one body. Thus then conceive we these words, And holds
not the head, whereof all the body increases.

As if the Apostle had said, And does not in his doctrine acknowledge nor
cleave to Christ as the only head of his Church of whom the whole Church as one
entire body increases.

They who teach intercession and mediation of Angels and Saints hold not Christ
the head of his Church.
plead what they will, indeed they do not truly acknowledge Christ to be the
only head of his Church.

The reason of this is manifest, Conviction of the Papists not to hold Christ
the head of the Church.


Let then the Papists say what they will in defense of their invocation of
Angels and Saints, they cannot possible avoid the evidence of this text of the
Apostle conuincing them in respect of that to be such as hold not Christ the
head of his Church.

Now in that the Apostle says, holds not the head, meaning Christ, (whereof
all the whole body) meaning the Church: We are given to understand thus much,

That there is the same relation and union between There is the same relation
and union between Christ and his Church that there is between the head and
body of a man.
and this comparison is often used in Scripture, to set out the relation and
union that is betwixt Christ and his Church, Ephe. 1.22. the Apostle says, God
appointed Christ to be the head of his Church, which is his body.

And that we may rightly conceive that the relation and union that is between
Christ and his Church, com-Church pared to a head and a body.

Know we first that there being two natures in Christ, his divine and humane,
Christ is the head to his Church, in respect of both, Chhrist is head to his
Church in respect of both his natures.
even whole Christ God and man; for he is so the head, as he is the Savior of
his Church* These two are conioined by the Apostle, Ephesians. 5.23. Christ is the
head of his Church and the same is the Savior of his body. Now Christ is the
Savior of his Church, not according to his divine nature alone, nor according
to his humane nature alone, but whole Christ in his Godhead, and in his soul
and flesh; Therefore whole Christ is the head of his Church, and the Church and
every true member is united to whole Christ, yet in this order.

First to the flesh and manhood of Christ, and then by that to the Godhead.

Secondly, we are to know that though the union whereby Christ and his Church
are conioined be a true and real union; yet is it not natural, as when two
things are joined in one nature, nor personal, as the soul and body are
united; nor political or civil, as the Prince and people are conioined: but
it is mystical and spiritual by the bond of the same spirit, The union of
Christ and his Church is mystical.
and by faith. Thus then stand we this truth, that Christ both God and man in
respect of both his natures after a spiritual manner is knit to all the elect
of God, called, justified, and sanctified, and so we are to conceive of the
relation and union that is between Christ and his Church, compared to an head
and a body.

And first of all, this may serve to confirm that truth of Doctrine delivered
in our Church.

True believers are justified by Christ his righteousness imputed unto them.
for, there being that relation and union between Christ and his members, that
there is between the head and the body; it must needs be that the graces and
benefits of Christ do truly and really belong to them, and what Christ did as
mediator God and man by the covenant of grace, is truly imputed to them that
are one with him, by the bond of his spirit and true faith: we know that what
is done by the head in a natural body, is ascribed to the whole body. So what
was done by Christ as mediator, and so the head of his mystical body may be
truly imputed to all the members of that body.

Let then the Papists scoff at our doctrine of imputed righteousness as
absurd, as if one should be said to live by the soul of another, or learned by
the learning of another: let us acknowledge and embrace it, as grounded on that
near union that is beweene Christ and his members we being so nearly conioind
to Christ, that we are of his flesh and bones, as the Apostle says, Ephesians.
5.30. We must needs be just by his righteousness, even his by inherencie,
and ours, given unto us by God, and apprehended by faith.

Our union with Christ is a ground of patience and comfort in time of
affliction.
let them know that their affliction reaches up to Christ their head; himself
has said it, that when they are hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick,
and in prison, he is hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick, and in prison,
Mat. 25.35.36. Act 9.3. When Saul breathed out threatenings, and slaughter
against the Church, he says, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me. Christ
bearing part with us in our afflictions, certainly he will, either moderate the
weight of them, or give strength to bear them, or he will put an end to them.

Consider then in time of affliction besides this, that afflictions are thy lot
and portion inevitable, and Christ has gone before thee and drunk of that
cup, and thou art conformable to Christ in suffering, and they are but for a
time; all which may minister matter of great comfort unto thee. Yet consider,
besides these things that thy sufferings and afflictions reach up to Christ
thine head and thou shall find it will be a notable means to lift up thy
fainting heart in thy greatest affliction; a man will not suffer smart in the
least of his members, if he can help it; and shall Christ to whom all power is
given, in heaven, and in earth, suffer himself long to be pinched in any one
of his members? certainly no, he will not, we have not an high priest that
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb. 4.15. He has had
experience of them, and therefore will, after we have suffered a little season,
appear to our comfort, Revel. 6.11. Let us then rejoice, says Peter, 1.
Epist. 4.13. in as much as we are pertakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his
glory shall appear, we may be glad and rejoice, and be made pertakers of his
glory in heaven.

Before I leave this point, I hold it meet to discover a Popish error. A
popish error described.
The Papists they teach, that in regard of our union with Christ, the
afflictions of believers are meritorious, and do satisfy the justice of God,
and purchase his favor.

For, say they, receive virtue from him to merit, though in themselves, we
confess with the Apostle, Romans 8.18. They are not worthy of the glory that
shall be revealed unto us, yet in that we are members of Christ, they receive
influence from him our head, and are raised up to higher estimate, even to
merit Gods favor. See the craft of these men, to deceive the simple, and their
own souls.



Mark we further, the Apostle says, holds not the head (whereof or of whom)
with relation to Christ (for so we expound the words) he says, not from whom,
but of whom. Hence we are put in mind of a difference between the members of
Christ, and such as are not his members.

Christ his members are of him, others are only from him.
as are all creatures, for all things that are, are the creatures of Christ, as
he is God, and so from him, but it is proper and peculiar to the members of
Christ to be of him.

If thou be not of Christ thou art not a member of Christ.
and then thou art only in the common condition of all creatures, thou art no
nearer heaven then the ox or the horse as yet, for they be the creatures of
Christ, as he is God and so, and if thou die in that state, thou art in far
worse case then the very toade or venomous Serpent, for their death is an end
of their misery, but thine is a beginning of endless woe without ease or
remedy.

Observe yet further, it is not to be passed over without observation that the
Apostle says, Christ is the head, of whom all the body, he says not, of whom
the body, but of whom all the body increases.

Hence then it is clear, that he is the only head of the universal Christ is
the only head of the vniuesall Church.
and it cannot be given to the Pope, or any other: as for the devised
distinction of the new Papists, of head imperial and ministerial, it is, both
without warrant of the word of God, and foolish; it implies a contradiction,
for to be head argues pre-eminence and superiority, The Pope is not head of
the Church.
and to be ministerial, argues subjection and inferioritie, therefore these
two can never agree to the same subject.

Hence take we further notice that Christ is the head of Christ his graces,
benefits, and works, as he is mediator belong to all true believers.
yea, as Christ by his gracious dispensation is head of his mystical body, he
cannot spare any of his members, but every one is required to his perfection
and fullness: so says the Apostle, Ephesians. 1.23. Note.
He is the head to his Church which is the body, even the fullness of him that
fills all in all things, which is an excellent sweet comfort to all true
believers, Consolation.
it may give them assurance that they shall never be cut of from Christ: for
why? Christ as the head of his Church is not perfect without every one of his
members, and therefore it is not possible that any one of them should be cast
off and severed from him. The head of the natural body may be cut off and
severed from the body, but Christ the head of his Church being not perfect
without every one of his members, will not suffer any one of them to be cut
off from him.

This also duly considered that Christ is the head, of all such as be of low
degree in the world, Comfort to the poor despised members of Christ
on whom proud rufflers look so big: if they believe in Christ, they have as
much interest in all his benefits and merits as the greatest; be not then cast
down in respect of thy mean condition in the world, thou art despised and made
the foote-stoole of proud and great ones in this world; care not for it,
believe in Jesus Christ, and thou have as good part in him, and art as dear
and near to him, as the greatest Monarch in the world, he is the head, and
therefore as kind and loving, as good and gracious, as bountiful and
beneficial to thee, as to any other whosoever, and think on that to thy
comfort.

Now we are to come to the quality and condition of that body to which Christ
as an head gives life and growth, expressed in the next words (furnished and
knit together by ioints and bonds) where the Apostle sets out the body of
Christ, by two conditions.





Interpretation.
I will briefly lay forth the meaning of these words (furnished) the original
word signifies, under supplied or, furnished, as the members of the body are
under the head, and furniture being a word of relation implying some thing,
wherewithal a thing is furnished, it signifies supplied or furnished with
that which is answerable to the furniture, that comes from the head to the
members of the natural body (namely) to the furniture of life, sense, and
motion, and particular ability of every member, as of seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, feeling, concocting, and the like, that as the body is
vnder-supplied with life, sense and motion, and with particular ability of
every member needful, from the head, so the body of the Church is under
fupplied from Christ the head with spiritual life, motion, ability and grace,
both with grace of holiness and regeneration, and with particular grace
needful, (knit together) this refpecteth the members themselves, and the word
signifies compacted or conjoined with a most straight and indissoluble band
(by joints and bands) the Apostle does still continue his similitude, that as
the parts of the natural body are furnished from the head and knit both to the
head, and one to another by ioints and sinews, so is it in the mystical body
of Christ, the members of that body are furnished with grace and knit both to
the head, and one to another, as it were by ioints and sinews, and by ioints
and bands in this place we are to understand spiritual ioints and ligaments
There be three spiritual ioints and ligaments.
by which the furniture of grace is conuaid from Christ to his members, and
they knit both to him, and one to another and those are three. First the spirit
of Christ, Romans 8.9. if any man have not the spirit of Christ, the same is not
his, Ephesians. 4, 4. one body one spirit, by his spirit Christ does communicate
his graces to us, and we to our brethren.

Secondly, faith, for by faith we apprehend Christ and are made one with
Christ, and by the same we cherish, comfort and stir up one another mutuallie
in good things To. 1.11.12. I long to see you (says the Apostle) that I might
bestow among you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that I might
be comforted together with you through mutual faith both yours and mine, for
with faith is always joined the band of love and peace, faith works by love.
Gal. 5.6.


Thirdly, our several callings (not those by which we stand in relation,
only to the commonwealth, and may be serviceable only in things belonging
to the body as our several trades and occupations) but whereby we stand in
relation to Christ, as the calling of the Minister, Father: Master. Husband and
the like, for these also are spiritual ioints and bands. This then is the full
sense and meaning of the Apostle in these words as if he had said.

Being furnished or under supplied from Christ the head of his Church with the
grace of holiness and regeneration and with particular grace needful for
every member, and the members of it being nearly conjoined one to another, that
furniture descending down from the head to the members, and that conjunction
of the members both to the head, and one to another being by means of the
spirit of Christ, by faith and by several callings in the Church, as by so
many joints and bands.

furnished) in that the Apostle says, that all the body is furnished from
Christ the head, we are plainly taught that every member of Christ receives
virtue from Christ, and is furnished with a measure of grace from him, Every
member of Christ receives virtue from Christ, and is furnished with a measure
of grace from him.
every one has a measure of spiritual life and holiness conuaied from Christ,
yea, every one has his particular grace, as the wholebody of a man, and every
member of the body to the least finger suckes virtue from the head, and the
head is powerful to cause it to live, so is it in the mystical body of
Christ, there is not a member of that body but it receives some virtue, from
the head the Lord Jesus, yea, every one receives his own particular grace,
Christ is effectual in every one from the hiest to the lowest. Ephesians. 4.16. the
Apostle says, Christ is the head by whom all the body being coupled, and knit
together by every joint for the furniture thereof (according to the effectual
power, which is in the measure of every part) receives increase of the body
unto the edifying of it self in love, the Apostle having recounted many gifts
and graces of the holy Spirit, ver. 11, concludes thus. All these things
works even the self same spirit, distributing to every man severally as he
will. Job and other excellent worthies, had a greater measure of patience given
then others, that were not to undergo such trials as they did therefore says
the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.7. to every one is given grace according to the measure of
the gift of Christ, and that we mistake not this point, know we that Christ
gives to every one of his members an equal measure of his grace for their
justification, Note.
one is not more or less justified then another by the grace of Christ, but
not an equal measure of inherent holiness to their sanctification, nor an
equal measure of particular gifts and graces, but to some and more some less
according to his own good pleasure, and as every one has need, and we are not
to envy such as have greater gifts then our selves (that by the way) for the
point in hand it is clear by that which has been said, that every member of
Christ receives virtue from him, and is furnished with a measure of grace, it
is not possible that any that are in Christ should be destitute of grace, and
altogether want holiness, and therefore deceive not thy self whosoeuet thou
art, if thou be a member of the mystical body of Christ, thou can not want
furniture of grace in some measure, Christ is the head of whom all the body is
furnished.

Hereby then try thy self, whether thou belong to that Trial of our selves
whether we belong to the body of Christ or no.
every one will be held a member of Christ and come to the table of the Lord to
seal up his union and fellowship with him, but where is that life of grace and
holiness conuayd from Christ to his members? can we persuade our selves we
are members of Christ, and yet live as many do the life of nature, doing that
which is good in our own eyes according to the lusts of our own hearts? for
what should I say of our breaking the Sabbath, blasphemous oaths,
drunkenness, cursed and bitter speeches and the like? is it possible that an
heart so furnished and full of such corruption, is knit to Christ, and a member
of Christ? surely we might as well say, that a wooden leg, neither knit hy
common bond, nor having heat in it, is a member of a man's body.

Reproof of those that want spiritual life and nimblenesse in good things, and
yet think they are the members of Christ.
in good things. In matters of the world, we have great dexterity we are apt
to conceive, fit to contriue for the best advantage, because we savor the
things of the world, but in matters of holiness and religion, many of us are
frozen and benumbed, and as it were without life, and can we yet fancy, that
we are members of Christ? Surely, if we think so, we deceive our selves, S.
John says, 1. Ioh. 1.6. if we say we have fellowship with God who is light,
and yet walk in darkness, we lie: so if we say, we are one with Crhist, and
have fellowship with him who is full of grace, Ioh. 1.14. and yet receive not
of his fullness, some measure of grace, certainly we have no conjunction with
Christ the head of his Church, and then consider what follows on that; if we
have not Christ our head in this life, we shall have him our judge and
condemner in the life to come: and as in this life we have but a supposed
union with Christ. Note.
So in the life to come we shall have but an imaginary fellowship with him;
and indeed a final separation from him and from his Angels and Saints: And we
shall have fellowship with the Devil and his Angels.

In that the Apostle says further, the body of the Church whereof Christ is
the head is knit together.

Such as be of the mystical body of Christ are as nearly knit together as
the members of one body.
and this the Apostle teaches plainly, 1. Cor. 12.12. As the body (says
he) is one and has many members, and all the members of the body which is
one, though they be many, yet are but one body, even so is Christ (that is)
Christ mystical or the mystical body of Christ, Romans 12.5. The Apostle
says, that believers being many are not only one body in Christ, but every
one, one another members even as members one of another. A speech worthy
observation, we are so nearly knit together in the mystical body of Christ,
that we are as it were a leg or an arm one of another.

Now, before I come to make use of this, a doubt A doubt.
is to be removed. It may seem in that the members of the mystical body of
Christ are conioined as the members of the natural body, and there is as near
an union between them, and so doubtless a good agreement of mind, and inward
affection among them; it may seem (I say) that unity is an infallible note of
the Church, as the Papists teach, and that where there is unity and consent of
minds and judgments, there is the Church.

To this I answer:

Again, consent is not simply an infallible note of the Church, for it is
sometime amongst the wicked, as among Joseph's brethren, and among the
Sodomites, and in the kingdom of darkness, Luk 11.21. And dissension may be
sometimes among the godly, Paul and Barnabas dissented, Act. 15.39. Paul and
Peter, Gal. 2.14. There were schisms in Corinth. 1. Epist. 1.11. Consent
therefore, is not simply a note Note.
of the Church, unless it be in true faith and doctrine. Let not then a
glorious name of consent dazell our eyes A ground of persuasion to mutual love.
which is, an argument, we have often occasion to speak of, and it cannot be to
often urged in these days, wherein men's hearts are full of rancor, and malice,
and distracted, and drawn asunder one from another: let us therefore consider
that we are knit together as members of one body, yea as members one of another
and therefore ought to love as members of one body, Christian love is to be
expressed in two things.
and to express our love one to another, and that chiefly in two things.
First, in communicating the good things we have either inward or outward to
others, according to their wants and our abundance as Job says, he was the
eyes to the blind, and the feet to the lame. Job. 29.13. Secondly in a
fellow-feeling of the wants one of another, if the foot be hurt the tongue
laments it, the eyes weep for it, the head aches, and the heart grieves for it,
so must it be with us in respect of the miseries and afflictions one of
another, we are to be touched with their griefs, feel the weight of their
burdens, be pressed with their bonds, as if we our selves were banished with
them.

Now to stir us up to these duties, much might be said, but consider we these
two things.

First, consider the state of the body, if one member deny to communicate the
good it has received to another, as if the eye refuse to guide the feet by
the sight of it, we know the feet may stumble and endanger the whole body, or
if the foot be wounded, and the eyes refuse to look on it, the hands to handle
it, danger may come to the whole body, so if we deny to communicate the good we
have received to others that stand in need of it, besides this if the Lord may
blow on our good gifts, and rise up in judgment against us, we hazard the state
of the body whereof we are members,

Again, consider that our communicating good to our brethren, and our simpathy
and fellow-feeling of their miseries, is a sure testimony of our union with
Christ, for our union with Christ does nothing profit God, though a thousand
worlds were united unto him, Note
he has set over the profit of that union to others, as our Savior said to
Peter, Ioh. 21.16. Peter love thou me; then feed my sheep, as if he had said,
make it known thou art one with me, and love me, by doing good to them that
are mine. If then we would not be guilty of so great a sin, as endangering
the state of the body whereof we are members, which is a sin against the
light and order of nature, and if we would have such testimony as cannot
deceive us, that we are one with Christ the head of his Church; let us be
stirred up not to love in word and in tongue only, Ioh. 3.18. but to express
our love one to another, both by communicating the good things we have one to
another, and by a fellow-feeling of the miseries and afflictions one of
another, have we wisdom? Let us bestow it to the good of the ignorant, have we
holiness? let us make the best of it, to the winning of others, have we plenty
of outward things? let us therein communicate to others according to their
need and our abundance. Only one thing more I will note from these words
(furnished and knit together by joints and bonds) and then descend to that
which follows. In that our Apostle says, that the body of the Church is
furnished and knit together in joints and bonds (that is) by means of the
spirit and by faith in Christ, and by several callings, we Every man's calling
whereby he stands in relation to Christ, is or ought to be as a joint or sinew
to convey grace to others.
every man's calling by which he stands in relation to Christ (that is) that
rank, that order and degree any one has in the mystical body of Christ, as
he is a member of Christ, and is of this or that order in the mystical body of
Christ, as a believing minister, father, or the like, even that calling and
degree of every believer, by which he has special relation to other members
of Christ is to be as a joint or sinew for the conuayance of grace to them, by
that calling and degree, he is to transmit and convey the grace of Christ to
those that are next to him, and to furnish them with the grace that he has
received from Christ himself; every calling in the mystical body of Christ,
being a iuncture or bond, by which we are joined and bound to others, the
Apostle has taught us, it must be a joint of subministration or under
furnishing others with grace, Ephesians. 4.16. in the original the words are by
every joint of subministration etc. and this truth is grounded on that general
exhortation of the Apostle Peter, 1. Epist. 4, 10. let every one as he has
received the gift minister the same one to another, as good disposers of the
manifold grace of God, every one according to the measure of grace received
and according to his ability is to further the good of the mystical body of
Christ, and being as a joint or a sinew in that body in respect of some
particular calling he is in that calling, to do the office of a joint or
sinew, he is to be as the joint is to the body even a means to convey down
grace to those to whom he stands in special relation: the father to the
children, the husband to the wife, the master to his servants, yea, and one
brother to another* one fellow-seruant to another one neighbor to another, is
to be as a joint or sinew for conueiance of grace one to another, which is a
duty not known to many in the world. Some are of opinion, and if the question
were asked what they think, they would so answer, that it is a duty proper and
peculiar to the minister of the word, to be an instrument under Christ for the
conuayance of grace to the soul of men; and that it is a thing nothing at all
concerning them, they hold themselves exempted and freed from that duty, I
appeal Every one in his particular calling is to be a means to convey grace
to others that be under him.
learn then whosoever thou art, to reform thy mind and judgment, art thou a
father, a master, an husband, a neighbor etc. know it is thy duty to be a
means to convey grace to those that are under thee, or to whom thou slandest
in any special relation: though principally it concerns the minister to
edify the body of Christ. Ephesians. 4.12. yet the Apostle has laid it on all
Christians as a general duty, 1 Thessalonians. 5.11. edify one another, though the
Minister be the mouth of the people to God, yet, S. James has taught, lam.
5.16. that we are to pray one for another.

Now these duties generally appertaining to all Christians do certainly more
nearly concern them, as they have special relation one to an other, etc. the
father, the master, the husband, the minister, are to edify their children,
their servants, their wife, the body of Christ etc. in grace and goodness, and
to send up a message to heaven, and to call upon the Lord by prayer for them.

Now then to stir us up in this duty wherein many are much wanting, yea the
most are so far from this duty, that they minister nothing but infection to
the souls of such as be under them; no child, no servant, no not the wife of
their own bosom has any help by them, to their salvation, their houses are
nurseries of cursing, swearing, lying, ribaldrie, and all manner of impiety.
Motives to stir up to this duty.
And therefore to stir us up to the duty now laid before us, consider we:

First that the want of this duty is one principal cause

Again, the neglect of this duty will one day be most

Add to this a consideration of comfort and blessing, attending on the careful
performance of this duty; as the neglect of it is full of bitterness, so
doubtless the practice of it must needs be full of sweetness; and the
blessing of it is that which the Lord vouchsafed to Abraham, Genesis 18.17. he
will reveal his secrets to such, and will hide nothing from them that may be
for their good, and for their comfort, if then we desire that such as be under
us, should profit by the public ministry of the word; if we would not have
their not profiting as they ought, by our means to be a discomfort to us when
we have most need of comfort, if we desire the blessing of the Lord upon us in
the revelation of his secrets and counsels: yea, the light of his countenance
to our comfort, both in life and death. Let us then be stirred up to the
practice of this duty, let us by instruction, counsel, admonition,
consolation, prayer, etc. be means to convey grace to those, with whom we
stand in any special relation; and remember that we in our several orders and
degrees are as ioints and sinews, and let us do the office of ioints and
sinews in the mystical body of Christ.

Interpretation.
Come we to the last words of this verse (increases with the increasing of
God.) In these words the Apostle makes known unto us, that Christ the head
gives growth and increase to the body of the Church. And what kind of growth
it is (namely) an increase of God: there is an increase of the Church, when the
number of believers increased, whereof we read, Act. 5.47. That the Lord added
to the Church from day to day such as should be saved, but that is not here
meant, the meaning of the Apostle in these words, is briefly this.

That the whole Church, and every member of the mystical body of Christ,
receives increase from Christ the head, in regard of spiritual grace, as of
faith, hope, love, patience, etc. which he calls the increase of God, because
it is divine and spiritual. Hence we are first plainly taught, that both the
beginning Both the beginning and increase of grace is from Christ.
of him as of the head, says the Apostle, all the body of the Church, and
every member of that body is furnished with grace, and being furnished
increases, he gives both the furniture of grace, and the increase of it, they
are both his free gifts, freely given not upon any desert of ours, and that
is further manifest by the different measure of grace, in that some have more,
and some less; for that cannot come from any difference of believers
justified, because one is not more justified then an other; there is no
inequality between them in that respect. Therefore it must needs be from the
mere good will and pleasure of Christ, that some have a greater measure of
grace, and some a less, and so both the beginning and increase of grace is the
free gift of Christ; so says the Apostle plainly, Ephesians. 4.7. To every one is
given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

This I note in a word, Our good usage of grace and our manuring of Gods gifts
does not merit the increase of them
No, no, both the grace and the increase of it in every member of the Church is
from the mere good pleasure of Christ.

They object, Mat. 25.29. To every one that has shall be given, and he shall
have abundance, and from him that has not, even that he has shall be taken
away. Say they, he that has any talent and uses it well, to him it shall be
given, and he shall have abundance, as a remuneration or reward of his good
usage of it.

The meaning of our Savior is, both the grace and the increase of it freely,
he will be good only because he has been good, and add mercy to mercy: in
the next place we may easily see this conclusion laid before us.

Every true member of Christ increases in spiritual graces.
every true believer increases in faith, hope, love, humility, and other
graces given, and continually goes from one measure to another.

And hence it is, that their spiritual life is in Scripture compared to the
ages of men; some are babes in Christ, some children, and some are of riper
age, and their holiness is compared to the morning light, which shines briter
and brighter, Isai. 58.8. And it is the exhortation of the Apostle Peter, 2.
Epist. 3.18. grow in grace.





Pet. 2.5. They are said to be living flames; therefore ever growing. For the
spiritual life of grace cannot be idle, but is ever going on from on degree to
another: and howsoever the members of Christ do sometimes fall of infirmity
and sin grievously; yet Christ their head, of his goodness turns that
sin of theirs to good unto them, for they rise again more thankful to him,
more humble in themselves, more mild and equal toward their brethren, and
more wary over themselves, and they cleave faster to Christ. Therefore they
daily increase and go on in grace.

Use Trial whether grace be truly wrought in us, or no.
Let this then be a ground of trial to every one of us, do we persuade our
selves we have knowledge, faith, humility, any other grace or sanctification.
Let us hereby try our selves, if that grace be truly wrought, certainly it
will increase, and if it do not, it is but a counterfeit resemblance of grace:
Note.
nature can put on the counterfeit of any grace, a man may transform himself
into the likeness of any grace; but the difference is, this counterfeit grace
will not increase, it is but as a painted tree, it will never grow greater; but
grace truly wrought, is like the grain of musterdseed cast into the earth,
Mat. 13.32. Small at the first, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among
herbs. If then we would not deceive our selves, let us not rest in the
beginnings of grace, but as the Apostle exhorts, 2. Tim. 1.6. Stir up the gifts
of God which are in us. And by the use of good means, as hearing, reading, and
meditating in the word and prayer; and know we that the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper is a principal means that God has ordained for the strengthening of
faith, and increase of grace in us; because it is not only a Sacrament of
nourishment and confirmation of faith, but because the remembrance and faith we
have in the merit of Christ his passion which is most lively set before us in
that Sacrament, is the only thing that gives us strength and comfort against
all temptations. Therefore they show themselves graceless, and indeed not the
members of Christ, who carelessly neglect that Sacrament.

If we persuade ourselves we have any grace, let us be careful to use this
and all other good means that serve for the increase of it, and labor still
to go on from on measure of grace to an other till we become of ripe age and
perfect strength in Christ.

VER. 20. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ, from the ordinances of the
world, why? as though ye lived in the world, are ye burdened with traditions.
This verse has relation to that which is immediately foregoing, on this
manner; in the verse before the Apostle shows that there is that near union
between Christ and his Church, that there is between the head and the body;
and what Christ did as mediator the members of his Church did it with him: when
he died, they died with him: hereupon the Apostle does infer in this verse,
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ, etc. In this verse the Apostle begins
to deal against the corruption of Religion, and against seducement and drawing
away the Colossians from the truth, by means of certain humane decrees and
traditions, that false teachers sought to thrust upon them, as things necessary
to be observed for religion and conscience sake, and needful to salvation: and
in this verse is laid down his first argument of confutation of them.

An argument confuting humane decrees and traditions
The argument is this.

Ye are freed by Christ from the rites and ceremonies of the Law, therefore
you ought not to be subject to men's decrees and traditions that seem to be
derived from thence. Some would have the argument in this place to be from the
greater to the less. Thus Ye are not now subject to the rites and ceremonies
of the Law being freed from them by Christ, therefore much less ought you to
be subject to rites and ceremonies that are invented by the brain of men.

But as I take it, the argument is not so, but as now I have laid it down. For
it is not like that the false teachers of those times sought to impose on the
Colossians any other things then such as were either taken from Philosophy, and
the learning of the Gentiles, or from the ceremonial Law of Moses, and such
were their traditions here spoken of, it may appear by the expressing of them
in these terms, touch not, taste not, handle not: which no doubt were
imitations of legal rites and ceremonies; and so the argument of the Apostle
in this verse is to be conceived, as I have propounded it.

More specially we have laid before us in this Verse; First, the Apostles
reason to diswade the Colossians from submitting to the decrees and traditions
of men (namely) this, that they were freed from them by Christ his death, laid
down in the proof of it, that with Christ they were dead, and by death freed
from them.

Secondly, the inference on that reason, therefore you ought not to subject
your selves to them; delivered by way of interrogation, why are ye burdened
with them? amplified by exprobration of the absurdity of such subjection, that
it is all one as if they still lived in the world. (Why, as though ye lived in
the world, are ye burdened with traditions?)

(Dead in Christ) To be dead with Christ is to have fellowship with him in his
death; Interpretation.
even to die with him as the members of his body: (from the ordinances of the
world) By ordinances of the world we are to understand, Legal Ceremonies, the
original words are the same with those, Verse 8. and so to be understood. Now,
whereas the Apostle says, Dead from the ordinances of the world, it is not an
usual manner of speaking in the Scripture, to say, Dead from, but rather, dead
to this, or that, as dead to the Law, dead to sin; and therefore the meaning
is, as if the Apostle had said; Dead, and by death freed from the ordinances of
the world, (as though he lived in the world.) To live in the world may betaken
two ways.

1 Either to live in the world in respect of bodily life.

2 Or to live after the course of the world, as Ephesians. 2.2. Wherein in time
past ye walked according to the course of this world.

And in this latter sense we are to take these words (as though he lived in the
world) (that is) as though ye were not dead with Christ, and by death freed
from the orders of the world, but still lived after the course of the world
(are ye burdened with traditions) In the original, we have but one word, it
cannot be so expressed in English, it signifies thus much; Are ye held under
the decrees of men, or such things as seem good to men: so this translation
(are ye burdened with traditions) may be justified, though the Papists carpe
at it. This then is the meaning of the Apostle, in this verse.

If ye as members of Christ be dead with him and be as free as dead men from
the Ceremonies of the Law, why? as though ye still lived after the course of
the world, are ye held under the decrees and traditions of men, which seem to
be derived from the brain of men. Of the first part of this verse (namely the
reason of the Apostle, If ye be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the
world; much might be spoken, but we have handled the chief things thence
offered heretofore, as that there is so near a union between Christ and his
members, that when he died, they died with him, of that we spoke verse 12. And
also of the doctrine offered from those words, ordinances or rudiments of the
world, we spoke verse 8. I will not now again handle those points only. One
thing more we may gather from the reason of the Apostle. And for concluding the
point, we are to mark, that the Apostle says, If ye be dead with Christ from
the ordinances of the world, meaning, if ye be freed from them, he puts dead
from them, for freed from them; signifying indeed, that they were as free from
them as dead men that had nothing to do with them. The point that hence I
gather is this.

That death is a freedom, death sets men at liberty from Death sets men free
from the Laws of men and from all hard taxations in the world.
and from all miseries they are subject to in this world, that which Job says
of the servant Job 3.19. That death sets him free from his master, is true of
all kind of outward servitude, bondage, slavery, or misery that men undergo
in this life whatsoever, death frees them from it; the afflictions are but for
this life only, Romans 8.18. Death puts an end to them; the malice of the
Devil, the rage of tyrants, and violence of bloody persecutors can reach no
further then this life: they can but kill the body, as our Savior says,
Matthew. 10.28. and when that is done they must cease from their tyranny,
therefore we are not to fear them.

Our Savior himself makes this use of it, fear not them which kill the body,
and when they have done that can go no further, but fear him which is able to
destroy both body and soul in hell. We are not to fear them only who can
kill the body but him who can destroy both body and soul.


Again, is it so that death is freedom from all miseries that men are subject
to in this world, then be not too much cast down in any outward trouble We are
not to be two much cast down in our outward troubles.
or calamity that can befall thee, as sickness, poverty, losses, painful
labors, Job says, Job 3.21. and say sometimes, oh happy were I if I were
dead, then should I be free from my pain and trouble, as if death were an
end of all kind of misery, never remembering that death in sin will not rid
them from misery, but is the very gate through which they pass into the gulf
of endldsse woe, death indeed puts an end for a time to the aches and pains we
endure in the body, yet that is but a thing common to us with the dumb beast,
in that respect the sore traveled horse is happy when he dies, but death in
sin is a passage of the souls of men from less misery to greater, therefore
never think thy self happy if thou were delivered by death, from aches and
pains which thou endurest in this life, unless thou have assurance of a better
life after this life is ended, labor thou to be sure to die in the Lord, which
thou shall do if thou live in the Lord, or rather have the Lord Jesus living
in thee, Gal. 2.20 if thou live by faith in the son of God, and repent of thy
sins, and have true peace of conscience as the earnest of thy salvation then
indeed thy death shall put an end to all thy miseries, thou shall rest from all
thy labors, from all kind of sorrow and suffering, yea, death shall give thy
soul an entrance to everlasting joy and glory, if thou have this assurance,
thou lying under some grievous affliction, thou may lawfully say with the
Apostle, Phil. 1.23. I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.

Come we to the inference of the Apostle in the other part of this verse (why
as though ye lived in the world are ye burdened with traditions) where first
observe we the manner the Apostle uses in bringing in of this conclusion* he
says not barely you are dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world, and
therefore ought not to submit your selves unto them, but he brings in his
conclusion by way of interrogation, why are ye burdned with traditions) which
is very emphaticall and powerful, and he amplifies it by laying before them
how absurd a thing it were, if they should so do, that it were all one, as if
they lived still in the world (why as though ye lived in the world are ye
burdned with traditions) as if he had said, if such as live in the world
should subject themselves to those ordinances I would make no great matter of
it, but you Colossians who prove your selves to be dead with Christ from the
ordinances of the world, and not to live after the course of the world, for
shame do not you suffer your selves to be subject to the decrees and
traditions of men. Hence we may take out The remembrace of our christian
profession ought to keep us from doing any thing contrary or unbeseeming the
same.
we find this as a reason of weight often used in the Scripture, either to
persuade to some good thing, or to dissuade from some evil, Genesis 13.8, Abraham
used it as a special means to quiet matters between him and Lot, that
howsoever the Canaanites were at iar and discord one with another, yet it ought
not to be so between them, because they were brethren and professed the same
true faith and religion Mat. 6.32, After these things seek the Gentiles, 1.
Cor. 6.1. the Apostle upon this ground dares the Corinthians, dare any of you
having business against another be judged under the unjust and not under the
Saints, as if he had said, do not you remember that you are Christians and
professing the true faith of Christ, dare you then go to law one with another
under unjust and infidel judges and not under the Saints? it is a monstrous
shame for you so to do, by these testimonies we see we are to take advantage of
that profession we make, and by the remembrance of that to be kept from doing
any thing unbeseeming. Use True professors of religion are to gather strength
against temptations to sin by remembering that holy profession.
Let all such as profess religion and the fear of God think on it, art thou
being a professor of religion troubled and stirred up by the Devil and thine
own corruption to covetousness, to rash anger, or to any other known sin?
remember thy profession and learn to say, as good Nehemiah said, Neh 6.11. who
when he was moved by a falls Prophet, to go into the temple to save his life,
said, should such a man as I fly; so say thou, should such a man or such a
woman as I be covetous or rashly angry should I that profess my self to
depend on Gods providence and to seek after other things even things eternal
and lasting for ever, greedily hunt after the things of this life? no, no, I
will not do it, it were a derogation to the glory of my God, whom I profess
to be my gracious father; a dishonor to the profession I make, scandalous and
offensive to other weak professors: a means to keep back some not yet
called a giving advantage to the obstinate and an opening of the mouths of the
wicked Atheists and enemies of the truth, even to speak evil of the
professors of the Gospel, therefore far be it from me I will not do it,
thus are we to reason and resolve with our selves, in consideration of our
holy profession, not to do any thing contrary or unbeseeming the same.

We are to mark further, that the Apostle says, why, as though ye lived in
the world (that is) as though ye lived after the course of this world,
implying by that speech, that the Colossians did not or a least ought not to
live after the course the world.

Though we live in the world, yet we are not to live after the course and
fashion of the world.
the Lord will have his children to live in the world, and not to separate
themselves from the world, but to live as Lot did in Sodom, in the throng of
this sinful world, according to the limits of their particular places and
callings. And that for these reasons.



Secondly, that there may be a trial of our strength in resisting the
assaults of Satan in evil examples, for that is indeed true resistance of
sin, and victory over it is most victorious, Note.
when conflicting with many occasions and allurements to it, we strive against
it, and overcome it, and he is truly good, who is good amongst them that are
evil.

For these causes will the Lord have his children to live among the wicked of
the world: but to keep themselves unspotted of the world or any corruption in
the world, Romans 12.2.
fashion not your selves like unto this world, Ephesians. 5.11. have no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness, but even reprove them rather, Phil.
3.20. our conversation must be in heaven, free from all dregs of all earthly
corruption, many other places might be brought to this purpose, but for the
use of the point.

This meets with that plea, It is a vain plea, to say, many do this or that
and therefore why may not I do it.
if we live in the world, we must do as other men do, swear with them that
swear, drink with the drunkard, and be profane with them that are profane,
or else we shall be counted as no body in the world, is it so that thou will
not be persuaded, that this is thy duty, that though thou live in the world,
yet thou art not to live after the course of the world, but thou must needs
do as other men do, know then that thou shall one day suffer together with
others, the punishing hand of God shall one day overtake both thee and them; yea
let me tell thee more, there is no doubt but beastly drunkards, filthy
adulterers, and the blasphemous wretches that are in the world, may remember
some like to themselus on whom the Lord has showed his judgments, they may
call to mind some that together with their blasphemy have belched out their
last breath, or in a drunken fit have belched out their own souls, and that
loathsome and incurable diseases have been sent on the bodies of filthy
adulterers, and yet will thou still go on in the same course? know then that thy
punishment shall be greater then theirs, thou having such examples before thee,
and yet wilt not be moved by them to break off thy sins by repentance, thy
punishment shall one day far exceed theirs. He that slays Kaine, says the
Lord, Genesis 4.15.
shall be punished seven fold. Kaine was a murderer, and the Lords hand was
upon him for his sin, and made him an example, he set a mark on him; and if any
should be so bold as to commit the same sin, having him marked before him, and
to murder him, his punishment should be seven fold, so certainly if thou have
an example of Gods judgment before thee, and thou can remember the Lords
hand has been in fearful manner, upon one like to thy self, and yet thou will still go on in the same sin, know that one day thy judgment shall be
far greater then his.

Observe yet further this inference of the Apostle together with his
amplification of it, he says why, as though ye lived in the world, are ye
held under the decrees of men (that is) why, as though ye were not dead with
Christ but still lived in the world, are you subject to men's decrees: Hence we
are given to understand thus much.

Such as subject themselus to decrees that either are or seem to be derived
from the ceremonial law carry themselves as men that deny the death of Christ.
and as such as have no fruit nor benefit, by his death, this is clear from
the text, and with this agrees that of the Apostle, Galat. 5.2. if ye be
circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing, if ye subject your selves to
circumcision or any of the old legal ceremonies Christ shall profit you
nothing, the reason is plain.

Many popish decrees euacuate and make void the death of Christ.
not tasting, of abstaining from some kind of meats, and from marriage of not
handling money and the like, besides the badge of Antichristian apostasy which
the Apostle has laid on them. 1. Tim. 4.3. how can they free those their
decrees from being such as euacuate and make void Christ his death? A popish
cavil.
it will not serve their turn to say their decrees are not the same with the
legal ceremonies, and that their Church decrees, not abstinence from this or
that thing as unclean (though indeed they do, for they place holiness and
part of Gods worship in such abstinence and so condemn that kind of meat at
that time as unclean by their prohibition) but they cannot so shift off the
matter, by their decrees of abstinence from meat, and the like, being taken
from the ceremonial Law of Moses,

VER. 21. Touch not, taste not, handle not.
In this verse he does specify their decrees and express them particularly
in their own words, as if he had said, why are ye held under the decrees of
false teachers, as namely these, they say unto you, Touch not, taste not,
handle not, Interpretation.
some expound these words as spoken of diverse things as touch not a dead corpse,
taste not of this or that kind of meat, handle not holy vessels, and the
like, but I take it they may more fitly be understood as all spoken of the
same thing (namely) of meats, Touch not, taste not, handle not, this or that
kind of meat, for that is more agreeable to the context and to the words of
this verse, and that matter of meats did put the faithful of those times both
teachers and others to much business and trouble both in regard of the zeal
that some had by legal ceremonies, and in respect of continual use of meat
and drink (Touch not) the original word translated (touch) signifies either
to touch or to eat, yet but a little, and these words (touch not) may thus be
understood, eat not, no, not a little, or touch not with thy teeth, or chewe
not with thy mouth (taste not) that is a further degree of prohibition, do not
so much as taste with thy mouth: then follows a third degree yet higher
(handle not) do not lay thine hand on this or that kind of meat, thus then
conceive we these words.

Chew not in thy mouth, taste not with thy tongue, nor lay thine hand, on this
or that kind of meat.

Now here first we are to mark that the Apostle having said in general in
the verse before, be not burdened with traditions, be not held under the
decrees of men, in this verse he subioynes their particular decrees of touching
meats, and he gives instance and example only of them be not burdened with
traditions as (namely) touch not, taste not, handle not, this or that kind of
meat, no doubt he might have insisted in many other things, but he thought it
most needful to stand against their superstitious decrees concerning meats as
most dangerous to the Colossians, and hence we may gather this conclusion.

That as Satan and his instruments do ensnare the souls of men in many outward
things, so not with the least danger Satan does dangerously tempt and ensnare
the souls of men in respect of meat and drink.


Satan the enemy of our salvation is ever tempting and that dangerously in
respect of meat and drink either on the right hand or on the left, either to
abstain as did these false teachers, or else to exceed, he began this
kind of temptation betimes, our first Parents were noe sooner created and
placed in Paradise but he presently began to tempt them about meat, and
from that time to this he never rests laying snares to entrappe us, even in,
or about our meat and drink, and he knows this temptation to be of great
force. Therefore he laid it against him that was most strong thinking to
prevail but in vain, even against our Savior himself Mat. 4.3. And the
reasons why Satan's temptation in, or about meat and drink is so dangerous, are
these.

First, it is a thing we use and must use daily, and if we want

Again, if we have it, we are not only prone to abuse it

And herein the devil has prevailed further then in many other sins; Note.
who will bestow cost on others to make them sin in any kind, only to make
themselves meery? indeed for their profit or credit wicked men will hire others
to lie, and to swear falsely for them, but for sport and meeriment only who will
be at any great cost in making others to sin, except only in drunkenesse. This
shows plainly, that the devils tempation, in, or about meat or drink, is
exceeding powerful and dangerous, and that he many times prevails therein very
far in bringing men to an high degree of sin.

Our care then must be to take heed we be not overtaken with sin, we are to
watch over our hearts that sin do not creep upon us in time of our eating and
drinking.
Saint Jude does tax some in his time for want of this, verse 12. They feast
with you (says he) without fear, feeding themselves; and especially, we are
to have this fear in our hearts in the time of feasting, when we come to a
table furnished with store and variety of meats, it is the counsel of the wise
man, Prou. 23.3. That at such a time we be not desirous of the dainty meat, for
it is deceiuable. To feast together is not unlawful, holy Job suffered his
children so to do, but afterward he called them together and sanctified them,
and offered burnt offerings for them, for Job thought, Job 1.5. it may be that
my sons have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts, in time of their
feastings.

And this are we to have a godly jealousy and suspicion of our own selves,
that sin do not intermingle it self with our plentiful eating and drinking,
and that then our affections do not settle and rest too much one the
sweetness of our meats and drinks, and that we forget not God the giver, that
we forget not the hunger and thirst of our poor brethren, Amos 6.6. and that
we exceed not measure in eating and drinking: and that our hearts may be
possessed with this godly fear and jelousie. Note.
Let us remember what a grievous thing it is when our table is a snare to us,
it is one branch of that prayer that was made against the malicious enemies of
the Church, Psalm. 69.22. Let their table be a snare before them: thus it shall
be to us unless we watch over our hearts in our eating and drinking, even our
meats and drinks shall be snares unto us. Withal we are to remember that we
abusing the creatures of God, our meats and drinks, the Lord does many times
secretly turn them even to the hurt of our bodies, those good gifts which he
has ordained for the preservation of nature; being abused, through the Lords
just judgment, are sometimes turned to the choking and ouerturning of nature
in us; for it is just with the Lord, wherein men sin, therein for the most
part to punish them; it therefore stands us in hand, if we respect the good
of our own souls or bodies, not to let our hearts loose in time of eating and
drinking, but to be wary and circumspect, even in receiving our ordinary diet,
but specially when we come to a feast, take heed that then forgetfulness of
God, or our brethren, excess, or any other sin, do not intermingle it self
with our eating and drinking.

In the next place, in that false teachers among the Colossians were not
content to say, touch not, or eat not, of this or that kind of meat, but they
proceeded further, to forbid the tasting of certain meats: The minds of
superstitious persons are restles.
I might show you how restless the minds of superstitious persons are, they
are never content with the number of their own devised orders and decrees.
Thus it is at this day among the Papists, one order, one decree is ever and
anon invented among their Monks, and others of that rabble which they call
religious, but I will not stand on that point. Observe we the manner these
false teachers used in putting forth their decrees, they put them forth in the
singular number, touch not, or thou shall not touch, thou shall not taste, thou
shall not handle, that they might reach every particular, and in the negative,
which is of more force then the affirmative, they would have them bind as
strictly as Gods commandments.

Hence we are to note their curiosity, False teachers are very curious and
strict in causing their followers to avoid the least touch of things they
suppose to be unclean.
I cannot properly call it care, but their curiosity and strictness in
providing that their should be no meddling at al with meats, they supposed
unclean, that men should not touch them, no not taste of them, nor handle
them; and this strictness was not proper to those false teachers alone, but
has been found in all of like sort, in all ages and times, the Apostle says
Gal. 6.12. that false teachers were so earnest and forward in urging
circumcision on the Galatians, that they constrained them to be circumcised.

Now, this is not to be passed by without profit to our selves: let us
therefore think on it to this purpose, We are to be careful, and indeed
curious in avoiding all manner of sin.
their followers to take heed of the least touch, or least meddling with that
they fancy to be unclean; Oh; then how much more ought we to be careful, and
if you will curious, in avoiding that which is indeed unclean (namely) al manner
of sin: yea, we ought in this respect to be so strict, as we are not to
touch any means, or any occasion leading unto it, not to come into the company
of such as are notorious wicked persons, more then we must needs in respect of
the bond of nature, of office, of place and calling, not carelessly to come
into their company, for that is to touch pitch, and it cannot choose but defile
us. Peter in bad company denied his Master; and hither too we may truly apply
that of the Apostle 2. Cor. 6.17. touch none unclean things; and that also of
Jude Verse. 23. hate even the garment spotted by the flesh: it is too much
boldness in some who causlessely sort themselves with any company.

Reproof of such as think they may with out danger meddle with sins.
And again, some think they may without danger, attire themselves like
wantons, garishly; and may safely use filthy and rotten speech at their
pleasure, these they think are things not to be stood on, and it is too much
strictness to make conscience of them; but what says the Apostle, Ephesians. 5.3.
Fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named
among you as it becomes Saints; the Apostle would have us not to touch them
with the typpe of our tongues. And there is reason for it, Note.
it is a dangerous thing but to put on the counterfeit of sin, and for a man
to be but personatus peccator, to play the part of a sinner, as many foolish
think; oh they will but dally with sin, they will but make themselves meery
with a few ribauld terms, they will but touch sin and put it from them,
before they enter into the gross practice of it, such persons as thus speak,
or thus think, they are not acquainted with the corruption of their their own
nature; they must learn to know that if sin be sweet in their mouths, and
they delight to speak of it, certainly they will favor it, and not forsake
it till it turn to poison in their bowels as Zophar says Job 20.12. Yea let
them know they might as safely drink up strong poison and prescribe it a
measure how far it shall work, for why? whereas they say or think they will
but sport themselves with sin for a time, Sin makes sure work.
and they will leave it when they please; they must know that sin makes sure
work having once seized on them, it will hold them and that fast by the heart,
yea their will it self is kept in hold and bondage and cannot be cleansed
till the Lord with his powerful hand of grace do deliver it.

Therefore fancy not to thy self, thou will but touch sin for a time and
then leave it; No, no, learn to fear always, be afraid to come near the
borders of sin, fly from it as thou would from one sick of the plague,
whose breath thou will avoid, and the needless touching of any thing about him:
be not thou like the fool spoken of, Prou. 14.16. Who rages and is
careless, who has neither quick sight to epsy and foresee the occasions of
sin, nor care to shun them, but goes on securely till some heavy judgment
overtake him.

VER. 22. Which all perish with the using, and are after the commandments and
doctrine of men.
In this Verse our Apostle brings two other arguments to dissuade the
Colossians from suffering themselves to be held under the decrees of men, of
not touching, tasting, or handling this or that kind of meat.

The first, is from the condition of things, about which their decrees were in
these words, (which all perish with the using) it may thus be conceived, such
decrees as are of transitory things, the observation whereof has no force nor
strength to salvation and to life everlasting, you are not to place holiness
and religion in them, but such are these decrees (touch not, taste not, handle
not) and that is laid down in the proof of it, these are of things vanishing
and passing away with the using of them, they endure no longer, therefore you
are not to place holiness and religion in them.

The second argument is from the efficient cause of such decrees of men, that
they were the commandments of men, and therefore they should not suffer
themselves to be held under them.

Interpretation.
Of these in order. (Which all perish with the using) (that is) all which
touching, tasting, and handling, together with the things to be touched,
tasted, and handled, (perish with the using) the words signify (are to
corruption in the use) the meaning is, are consumed in the use, or are
corruptible, and endure no longer then the very use of them and both they and
the use of them do vanish and pass away with the time.

Now, here first the argument of the Apostle is to be considered, in that he
reasons thus; that the decrees of false teachers were of things perishing,
and passing away with the use of them, and therefore the Colossians ought not
to place holiness in them. Hence we are given to understand thus much.

Transitory things of this life do not of themselves make us more or less
holy in Gods sight.
I say, these things of themselves; we may sin, and that grieuouslie, in the
use of such things, and we may please God in the moderate and sober use of
them; but the things themselves, or actions about them considered by
themselves, do not make us more or less holy. 1. Cor. 8 8. The Apostle says
plainly, meat makes not us acceptable to God; for, neither if we eat, have
we the more, neither if we eat not have we the less. The meaning is, more or
less piety and religion, or are more or less pleasing to God, Romans 14.17. The
Apostle says, the kingdom of God is not meat nor drink (that is) religion
and the power of it, stands not in meat and drink, but in righteousness,
and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.

The reason is this, because godliness and religion as the Apostle says, 1.
Tim. 4.8. is profitable, it is of use to all things having the promise, both of
this life, and of that which is to come.

Now meat and drink and other outward things,

It will be said,

I answer,

And first, this meets with that error of the Papists, who place a principal
part of Gods worship in the use of outward Confutation of the Papists placing a
chief part of Gods worship in the use of outward things.
they hold it a great part of holiness and religion, to wear this or that kind
of habit, to abstain from one kind of meat and to eat another; it is a strange
thing that men should be so simple, especially, that men of understanding
should be so ouerseen, as to persuade themselves that the very using of this or
that outward thing, the abstaining from this or that kind of meat, should make
any thing to eternal life, that a thing corruprible in it self and consumed
in the use, and having no further use, but natural, for the present necessity
of the body should any thing avail to life everlasting. This is a strange
thing but that by the just judgment of God they are given over to themselves.

We must look that our religion be not in vanishing things.
in such things as pass away with the using of them: then, I beseech you, let
us every one look that our religion (for we will be held such as have
religion, and such as worship God in spirit and truth) Let us therefore look,
that our religion be not in things vanishing, transitory, and passing away
with the time; there is no doubt, but most of us, if not all of us, can
discern the groffenesse of Popery, and cry shame on it, in placing religion
in not touching, not tasting, or not handling this or that kind of outward
thing; yet we our selves many of us have no other religion, but even that which
is found in vanishing things, in things passing away together with the time:
for what else is our formal hearing of the word, our receiving of the
Sacraments of custom, and for fastiion, our prayers uttered with the mouth,
when our hearts are wandering far from God; yea the judgments of God being
upon us in plague, unseasonable weather, and such like. Will not we sometimes
confess, and say, these things are come on us for our sins, and yet what is
such confession in the most of us, but a vanishing thing, a fleting motion,
even a thing passing away with our breath, and the speaking of it, we have not
any ttue sense and feeling of our sins, neither will we (as we ought) come to
any particular sin of our own confessing, that to have deserved such a
judgment; what then is this but to place our religion in things vanishing, and
passing away with the time: indeed I confess that hearing the word and
receiving the Sacraments are not vanishing things in themselves, they have use
both in good and bad, in the one sort to life and salvation, in the other to
judgment and condemnation, but being formally used they are vanishing things,
in respect of theit saving and comfortable use, they pass away with the time,
in respect of that use we are not bettered by them, we have no profit by them
to life and salvation; and if we place our religion in a formal hearing of the
word or receiving the sacraments, and think we are religious in so doing,
surely, our religion is not sound, it is but hypocrisy, let us take knowledge
of it, and let us not think it sufficient, if we come to the Church, hear the
word, and receive the Sacraments, unless we find these exercises of
holiness, and of the worship of God, powerful in working grace in us, and of
comfortable use to our own salvation, yea, let us ever look that our religion
be found in things permanent, and such as have use to life everlasting, as in
faith, hope, love to God and men, humility, patience, and in works of mercy;
for these indeed pass not away with the using, but endure to life everlasting,
though the action of them be transient, and pass away with the time, and yet
being done by a true believer, one that is in Christ, the good of it remains
after the action, yea, the good of it shall follow him when all things in the
world forsake him, for they leave him at the grave, but that shall follow him
to heaven, as says the holy Ghost, and that is a notable inducement to stir us
up to the doing of good, and to the practice of religion in this manner.

In the next place, from the matter of this reason of the Apostle, in that he
says (which all perish with the using meaning meats forbidden by the Law of
Moses, and the touching, tasting and handling of them; we may easily see this
conclusion laid before us; that food of the body, corporal meat and drink,
and the actions about them in the use of them, namely eating and drinking pass
away with the time, and reach no further then the time of this life, I need
not spend much time in proouing this point, it will easily be confessed to be
a truth, Matthew. 15.17. our Savior has set it down as a general conclusion
that whatsoever enters into the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast into
the draught, it perishes and is consumed, 1. Cor. 6.13. the Apostle says,
meats are ordained for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God shall
destroy both it and them (to wit in respect of eating and drinking, and shall
cause these actions to cease, and the use the belly has in time of this life,
for in the life to come there shall be no use of meat or drink, we shall be
as the Angels of God in Heaven; what is our use of this point?

We are not to labor for the meat that perishes but for that which endures
to life everlasting
a duty wherein most of us are much wanting, we labor and toil, and spend
the strength of our bodies in seeking only after bodily food, and have
little or no care to seek after the food that endures to eternal life; yea,
many are so eager in seeking after the food of their bodies that they will
have it though it be with the loss of Gods favor, and with the breach of a
good conscience, witness that buying of trifles, pears and apples, and such
like on the Sabbath day, this argues we care not for any other thing, but that
we may have to fill our bellies, let as many as are thus minded, whose belly
is their God, Phillip. 3.19. let them know that this sin is highly
displeasing to God, yea such a sin as brings down Gods curse on all that
they have in special manner, for so the Lord has threatened Ierem. 17, 27. if
ye will not hear me to sanctify the Sabbath day, etc. Let us then know that
we are no gainers by breaking the Sabbath, we think we get much by it, but
the Lord will either consume our goods with fire or send a curse that like an
unquenchable fire shall devour all that we have; Let us then learn to keep
the Lords Sabbath holy, and to bestow it in holy exercises, and on that day
especially to labor and seek after that meat that endures to life
everlasting, this is that one thing abfolutelie needful spoken of, Luke the
10. and 24. verses, Mary's part, though the entertainment of Christ was as
necessary as any outward business, yet not necessary in respect of this one
thing for without this a man cannot be saved, Note.
which he may without any thing else having this.

Come we now to the arguments of the Apostle being three in number, by which
he diswades the Colossians from submitting themselves to the decrees of false
teachers in the words following (and are after the commandments and doctrines
of men.)

The first argument is from the efficient cause of these decrees (namely) men,
that they were the fruit of men's brains, and therefore they ought not to
place religion in the observation of them; now touching this argument, a doubt
must be removed before we come to the words of it (namely) this, it may seem
by the argument, A doubt propounded.
that the tarditions and decrees of men before spoken of verse the 20. were
such as were meerelie invented and devised by the brain of men, and not (as we
said) such as were derived from the ceremonial Law of Moses, for then they
should not be said to be commandments and doctrines of men.

For remoouall of this scruple we must call to mind that which we have often
heard that the rites and ceremonies of the Law, should be bound to her husband
so long as he lives and he being dead then to be free from him, so says the
Apostle, Romans 7.2. Now then if men by their commandments bind her to him
after he is dead, and decree that she is still bound to him, and that it is
unlawful for her to take another man to her husband, surely, that is not Gods
Law, but a commandment and decree of men, so is it in this case, the people of
God being bound to the things prescribed in the Law of Moses, but for a time,
if men decree that they are still bound to them as before, that time being
expired, that is not Gods commandment, but the commandment and doctrine of
men: and so this argument makes nothing against my former exposition, that by
traditions we are to understand decrees of men derived from the ceremonial Law
of Moses, the words of this argument have no difficulty in them, they are to be
conceived according to the proper signification of them, and the meaning of the
Apostle in them is.

That the decrees of men of not touching, not tasting, not handling, though
they seemed to be decrees derived from the ceremonial Law of Moses, yet indeed
they were only the commandments and teachings of men, and had no ground nor
warrant from the word of God.

We are in the first place to consider the argument it self in that the
Apostle reasons thus, that the Colossians should not be held under those
decrees of false teachers, of not touching, not tasting, not handling, as
things of necessary observation unto their salvation, because they were
precepts and commandments of men, having no ground in the word of God; we are
plainly taught thus much.

That men can give no precepts nor rules without warrant from the word of God
of necessary observation to life everlasting: rules given by men not grounded
on Gods word in case of religion, in matters of faith and manners are not of
any moment, or of any necessity, we are not necessarily bound to the
observation of them as things needful to life and salvation.

The reasons of this are manifest.

First, man's eye is not only dim or bleared, but stark blind in heavenly
things; therefore men can give no direction for the way to life eternal.

Secondly, the written word of God contains all things needful to be known,
believed or practiced, and is sufficiently able to make wise to salvation. 2.
Tim. 3.15. Therefore other rules besides that are needless, and if any be given
as needful to salvation, we are not bound to observe them. This I note in a
word, to let us see what we are, The observation of popish unwritten traditions
is dangerous and damnable.
of their rules of abstinence from meat and drink, marriage and the like, which
they urge on men as things of necessary observation, and say the breach of them
is a damnable and a deadly sin, we are to know there is no necessity in the
observation of them, but rather indeed the observation of such decrees and
precepts is dangerous, yea, it is damnable and deadly to observe them as the
Papists would have men observe them with opinion of necessity, and of merit,
and as a part of holiness and religion. Why but say they did not the Apostles,
impose it as a necessary law and decree on the Gentiles converted, Act. 15.28.29
that they should abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and that that
is strangled,

They call them necessary, not because they were by their decree in that manner
necessary as they were under the Law, but in respect of the edification of the
weak, stumble and to be offended: but rather it was necessary that they
should abstain from that liberty, for the edification of their brethren, and
that is the meaning of the Apostles in saying (these necessary things) and so
the Papists have hereby no advantage for maintaining any necessity in their
rules and decrees, not warranted by the word of God.

Observe we further that the Apostle in propounding this argument says not
only after the commandments but adds to that (and doctrines of men) no doubt
of purpose to avoid an exception that the Colossians might justly make, for if
he had said only after the commandments of men, they might have said indeed
these decrees of not touching, not tasting, not handling, are the commandments
of men, but yet it may be they are the doctrines of God, they are commanded by
men we confess, but happily taught of God, now to take away all occasion of
such exception, the Apostle says, they were both the commandments and
doctrines of men.

Some commandments of men are also men's doctrines and not to be obeyed; other
commandments of men there be which are also taught of God and to them
obedience is due.
Some are the commandments of men, and are also the doctrins of men (as were
these decrees of false teachers) and not taught of God at all in his word,
either expressly or by necessary consequent, and these we are to renounce, and
not to yield obedience unto. Other commandments of men, there be which are
also taught of God, and to them we are to yield obedience, for example, it is
the commandment of man, that we assemble our selves publicly to hear the
word, and this also is a thing commanded of God, and we are bound to submit
our selves to this commandment of man, and if we do not the Magistrate may
lawfully compel us, as it is said of good King Josiah, 2. Chro. 34.32. he
caused all that were found in Jerusalem, and Benjamin even all his subjects to
stand to the covenant he had made, yea, ver. 33. it is said, he compelled all
that were found in Israel to serve the Lord his God: Confutation of the
Brownists touching the constitution and planting of our Church in England.
They say we have no Church truly planted, and why so? because say they, your
Church was gathered only by the commandment of the Magistrate, after Popery
was put down men were compelled by the Magistrate to make profession of the
faith, and their profession was not voluntary.

Answ.

VER. 23. Which things have indeed a show of wisdom, in voluntary religion,
and humbleness of mind and in not sparing the body, neither have they it in
any estimation to satisfy the flesh.
In this verse the Apostle does prevent and answer an objection

To this he answers. First, by way of a general concession, that indeed they
had a show of wisdom. And then he does express in particular wherein that
show of wisdom consisted (namely) in three things. In voluntary religion, in
humbling of mind, and in not sparing the body.

In the last words of the verse he answers directly to the objection, and
remoues it by force of reason: what his argument is I will lay forth when I
come to the words.

Interpretation.
Let us now speak something of the general concession in the first words (which
things have indeed a show of wisdom) that is, which decrees have indeed [1]
certainly and truly (a show of wisdom) to omit other acceptions of the word
(show) it hear signifies an appearance or color of wisdom opposed to the
truth of wisdom, and so the meaning of the Apostle is this.

Which decrees have certainly an appearance of wisdom, they seem indeed to
be wise and to be worthy decrees.

We are here to mark that the Apostle says the decrees of false teachers
being as he said the commandments and doctrines of men, having no ground in
the word of God, yet they had a show of wisdom: hence then we may easily take
up this conclusion.

That things that have no ground in the word of God, Things not grounded on the
word of God, yea, things contrary unto it, may carry a show of holy wisdom.
yea of holy and religious wisdom 1. Sam 15.3. we find that when Saul had an
express commandment of God to smite Amalek and all that pertained unto them,
and have no compassion on them, but to slay both man and woman, infant and
suckling, both ox and sheep, both camel and ass, it seemed rather wisdom
to do the contrary, even to spare of the best of the sheep and oxen, yea godly
and religious wisdom that he might have wherewith to offer sacrifice. This I
might further show by many particulars: and for the ground of this, it is the
subtilty of Satan as by many means to draw to error, so by this as not of the
least force, even by deluding of the mind and judgment by making that seem
wisdom and goodness, which indeed is full of folly and sin.

Our use We are to take heed that a show of wisdom deceive us not, and make
us do things contrary to the word of God
some take liberty to sin upon this ground, oh, say they, many wise men do
this or that, and why may not we also do it; and being reproved for doing
so, they will not stick to say to the repoouer, as wise men as your self do
thus; it is indeed a plausible and powerful argument yea it is more plausible
and powerful to say, many ancient wise men do thus, therefore why may not I
do it, then to say many do it, and therefore I may do it. This latter is the
argument of such as have no fear of God before their eyes, but the other is
the argument of such as seem to have some religion in them: yea, Note
the Devil knows the force of this argument, and therefore we find which is
worthy observation, Act. 13.50. That he stird up certain devout and
honorable women, and the chief men of the City, and raised persecution
against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts that others
seeing such wise, grave, and devout persons carried against them, they might by
their example be more encouraged to do the like, and so give a greater blow
to the cause of God; I say therefore it is a plausible and powerfvll argument,
to say many wise men do so, therefore why may not I do it.

But let us take heed we be not led by the example of any, be they never so
wise, to break the Sabbath, to use gaming, swearing, this or that foolish
fashion in attire, or any other thing that the word of God does not allow. And
let us know that though men doing these things be very wise yet that is no
part of their wisdom to do so, and why then should we follow them in that in
which they are not wise.

And remember that their practice may lead thee to do as they do, but it
cannot preserve either them or thee from the reward of that sin; therefore
look not who they be that do this or that, but what warrant they have for the
doing of it, and how well they are like to speed for their doing, be not
carried away with a show of wisdom to do any thing contrary to the wisdom
and will of God revealed in his word, let that be thy guide and direction in
all things.

Come we to the particulars wherein this appearance of wisdom consists,
expressly set down by the Apostle in the words following, (namely) Voluntary
religion and humbleness of mind, and in not sparing the body: the decrees of
false teachers before spoken of, seemed to be wise and excellent, in that in
the practice of them there was voluntary religion, and humbleness of mind,
and not sparing the body.

Interpretation.
(In voluntary religion) by voluntary religion, we are to understand such
religion, and such worship of God, as is not willed and commanded by God in his
word, but is from the will of man, and may be called will worship, or indeed
superstition, that is, as that word (superstition) does signify, supra
statutum, more then is appointed by God in his word, when men do that which
they are not bound to by Gods commandment; and think that in so doing they
worship God, that is, voluntary religion (and humblenes of mind.) By
(humblenes of mind) in this plaec is meant submission, and stooping down lower
then Gods commandment, even a subjection to the commandments and decrees of
men. (and in not sparing the body) that is in one word, in hard usage of the
body, in rigorous and severe dealing with the body, in macerating, vexing, and
afflicting of the body, by withholding from it necessary sustenance, and
convenient regard.

Thus then conceive we these words as if the Apostle had said, those decrees of
not touching, nor tasting, nor handling, seem to be wise and of great worth,
in that in the practice of them, men give free will worship to God, and do
that which they are not bound to do, yea, more then God has commanded them to
do, and they stoop lower then the Commandments of God, and in humility
yield obedience and subjection to the commandments of men, and they stick
not, even to macerate, vex, and afflict, and to deal hardly with their own
bodies.

Now herein the first place, in that the Apostle does grant, that a show of
wisdom consisted in voluntary religion, and that the decrees of men seemed to
be wise and worthy decrees, for that in the practice of them there was
voluntary religion.

We may plainly see this conclusion laid before us, that Will Worship carries
a show of wisdom.
such worship, and service of God, as is not willed by God, but is wholly from
the will of man, seems to be wise and worthy service, and men seem to be
wise in offering to God voluntary worship and service: thus we read, 1. Sam.
13.11.12. That when Saul had rashly and hastily presumed to offer a burnt
offering which was more then he ought to have done; yet it seemed to him he
had done wisely, and a good piece of service to God; yea, he went about to
persuade Samuel that he had done very well and wisely, says he, I saw the
people were scattred from me, and thou came not within the days appointed,
and therefore I said, the Philistims will come upon us, and we shall be
forced to join battle with our enemies, and have not made supplication unto
the Lord; I was bold therefore, and offered a burnt offering: I was bold
therefore, says Saul, as if he had said, it was indeed more then I ought to
have done, I was bold to do it, I did it of mine head and of mine own
voluntary mind I offered a burnt offering, but I think in so doing I did well
and wisely, I had great reason for it, this no doubt was the drift of Saul's
speech: and thus does will worship such service of God as men fancy to be
good, many times carry before it ^ show of wisdom, and reason; yea, as one
says well, many points of superstition, have so much show of reason for them,
that without Gods commandment to the contrary, a wise man might think them
very fit means of Gods worship, and meritorious; how then may we profit by
the knowledge of this point? Surely thus.

It ought not to trouble us that men learned and wise are many times vvedded
to superstition.
The learned among the Papists, do exceedingly dote upon their devised
worship, and their works as they call them of (supererrogation) works not
commanded, but over and above the commandment, as high and excellent services
of God, and such as merit greater glory in heaven, they plead for them, and do
wonderfully please themselves in them; we are not to marvel at it, for therein
they seem to be wise; yea, therein they persuade themselves, they go beyond
others in profoundnesse of wisdom.

We must take heed that we lean not too much to humane wisdom and reason,
in Gods worship and service
but is merely from the will of man, does carry before it such a show of
wisdom and reason: let us then take heed, we lean not to much to humane
wisdom and reason, in the worship and service of God, if we do, we are in
danger to be carried away to superstition, and to serve God not according to
his will, but after our own fancy.

Reason will tell us that any kind of good service offered to God out of our
own good meaning and devotion, is pleasing to God, for so do ignorant and
superstitious persons plead for themselves, that they do this or that out of a
good mind and meaning.

For example, they coming into a Church, not in time of public worship, but
at another time, they fall down on their knees, and pray to the Lord, and they
hold that to be an high and holy service of God, and why? their own reason
tells them the place is appointed for the worship of God, and they are better
put in mind of God in that place, and their prayers are more pleasing to God
in that place then in another; and thus are men carried away with a show of
reason, to do that which the Lord never required of them.

But it will be said, may we not pray when we come into a Church, is it a
thing unlawful?

No, it is not, we may pray in all places, Tim. 2.8. I will therefore that the
men pray every where: but to pray in a Church out of time of public worship,
with respect had to the place, with opinion that we are more bound to pray in
that place then in another, and with a conceit that God will sooner hear us in
that place then in another; that is gross superstition, and utterly unlawful;
for the Lords worship is not bound to any one place, neither is God nearer, nor
more ready to hear in a Church then in another place, out of the time of
public worship; as for that they say, the place does stricke into them a
reverence of God and better put them in mind of God, that is just as the
Papists plead for their images, and therein they notably discover their own
corruption, in that they must needs have such helps as God never appointed, to
put them in mind of God, all these are but colorable shifts of man's own
reason; and we are to take heed, that we be not led away by reason to offer
that to the Lord as good service which he has never commanded.

Before we pass to the next thing, A doubt propounded.
a doubt is to be removed which happily may rise in the minds of some, I
will briefly propound, and resolve it, the doubt is this.

It is a received, and sound truth, that all true believers are a free and a
voluntary people that yield obedience, worship, and service to God
voluntarily, as if there were no Law to compel them, they have Christ living
in them, and the spirit of life reigning in them, Romans 8.2. and so their
religion, and service of God is voluntary, it may seem then, that men may
justly stand on voluntary religion as an excellent thing, and it is not to be
taxed as having a bare show of wisdom.

David bids Solomon, ^. Chr. 28.9. Thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of
thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind, thus is
their religon voluntary, and no otherwise.

(And humbleness of mind) In that the Apostle says further, that this show
of wisdom consisted in humbleness of mind, it may seem strange, for
humbleness of mind is a special part of true, and not seeming, wisdom; it
is pleasing to God, who resists the proud, as we have it, 1. Pet. 5.5. but
we must take the Apostles meaning, he understanding by (humbleness of mind)
in this place, submission and subjection of mind, to the decrees of men, that
have no warrant in the word of God, such submission and subjection, has only
an appearance of wisdom, and it is no true wisdom.

Observe we from hence, (I will pass by things formerly spoken on these
words, Verse 18.) observe I say, that the false teachers of the apostles time,
held it an high point of wisdom for men to submit their minds, to their
devised decrees, and not lift up the least thought, or the least conceit of
mind against them, and so the Doctrine hence is this.

It is one note of false teachers, to urge subjection, and It is one note of
false teachthers that they urge obedience and subjection to things of their
own devising as a matter of vvisdome.
that men may do very well and wisely, if they submit their minds with
reverence to things taught by them, though they be not able to warrant them
from the word of God; and thus much is implied in that expostulation of the
Scribes and Pharisees with Christ himself. Math. 15.2. Why do thy Disciples
transgress the traditions of the Elders, for they wash not their hands when
they eat bread: as if they had said, what reason have thy Disciples so to do:
is it not foolishly done of them, were it not rather wisdom in them to observe
the traditions of our Elders, men that were renouned and in high esteem for
their gravity and wisdom: that seems to be the drift of their speech, thus
reasoning the matter. (Why do thy Disciples, etc.

Now, this note cleaues fast to the teachers of the Romish Popish teachers
discovered to be led with a spirit of error.
for what is more common and frequent in their mouths then the authority of
the Church, that men are besotted, and possessed with foolish and heretical
pride in that they refuse to submit to the decrees of holy Churches, without
reasoning against them; yea, in that they yield not like reverence to the
decrees of their Prelates, that they do to the word of God, for so has that
cursed Council of Trent set down with (anathema) upon it; this plainly
discouers them to be led with a spirit of error and of Antchi^ist.

Why, but say they,

I answer them, as the men of Berea did, Acts 17.11. Whether their teachers
doctrine be true, and to reject whatsoever they find not proved by the
Scriptures, and yet are not the sheep thereeby made judges of their Pastors,
nor people of their teachers, but the word of God is made judge of every
doctrine, whether it be true or false; men indeed must with all reverence, and
humbleness of mind hear their teachers; yea obey them, and be ordered by
them, when they find their doctrine to be the doctrine of the holy Ghost, and
not the invention, or tradition of men. Luke 10.16. He that hears you,
hears me.

And herein are many amongst us much wanting, and Reproof of such as refuse
to submit their minds and consciences to the plain evidence of Gods word.
they will not in some things humble and submit their minds to the plain
evidence of the word, though they cannot deny but the doctrine taught is
agreeable to the truth; yet, they harden their hearts against it, and they will
not in humility yield obedience unto it, though they must needs confess the
thing reproved to be a sin, yet they will not subject themselves to the
reproof, and suffer themselves to be wrought upon and reformed: witness our
continued profanation of the Sabbath, in following after our sports and
pleasures, and wanton dancing on that day, our continual belching out
blasphemous oaths, our drunkenness, pride, and the like; yea, our wilful
running far and near after a cunning man, or cunning woman, (as they are
called) but indeed such as deal with sorcery and witchcraft: our seeking to
them in time of sickness, or weakness of body, though this sin have
been often laid before us, and surely herein I am persuaded that some
persons, go not only against the plain evidence of the word, but against
their own consciences, and as it were, lay violent hands on their consciences,
they will not suffer them to cry out against them as they would, and that is a
fearful thing. we know it is a grievous thing for one to lay violent hands on
his own body, it makes us tremble to think of it. Oh much more grievous is
it, as it were to strangle thine own conscience, and for a time to stop the
mouth-breath of that, for a little ease or health of thy body. Well let such as
still wilfully run into this sin, and into other sins, though they have often
heard to the contrary, let them but remember thus much, that the time shall
come (unless they repent) when even the blind and ignorant Papists, such ss
are led hood-winckt in their superstition shall be justified rather then they,
though they have a great measure of knowledge. For these ignorant Papists, (I
warrant you) with great reverence and devotion, yield obedience to the devised
decrees and doctrines of their teachers, and yet these persons will not be
brought to submit themselves to the truth, and to humble their minds and
consciences to the plain evidence of the eternal truth of God, therefore
certainly one day this sin shall lie heavy on their consciences, and those
blind Papists shall rise up in judgment against them, and condemn them.

Come we to the third thing, wherein this show of wisdom consisted (namely)
(in not sparing the body) in hard usage of the body; where first observe for
the grounding of the doctrine, that in the observation of those decrees of not
touching, etc. there was hard usage of the body, the Apostle does grant they
seemed to be wise, for that in the practice of them, there was hard usage of
the body: hence then in the first place we may easily gather thus much.

That superstitious persons in their kind, are not formal and superficial,
but they are laborious and painful in their Superstitious persons are not
formal, but in their kind they are laborious and painful.
they do therein sometimes go so far, as that they deal hardly with their
own bodies. The Prophet says of the wicked in his time, Ierem. 9.5. they took
great pains to do wickedly, so indeed do superstitious persons many times to
serve God superstitiously. Thus we read of Baals priests, 1. Kin. 18.28. that
they cut themselves with knives and launcers till the blood gushed out upon
them, Micah. 6.7. the hypocrite is brought in demanding, wherewithal shall I
come before the Lord, etc. I would take any pains, yea, do any thing even
that which is even against nature, I would lay hands on mine own child, and
offer my first borne child to serve the Lord, and is it not thus among the
Papists do not many of them undergo much hardness, and endure great pains
in their superstitions? as in wearing hairecloth going wooll-ward, bare footed,
whipping themselves, and the like: we read of some Monks called Flagetans, who
went bare foot in linen shirts, leaving an hole behind on their backs,
where they did daily whippe themseleues before the people till the blood
followed, and many hard vsages of the body we may read of, and happily some of
us may remember we have seen practiced by superstitious persons.

The pains taken by men in their superstitions ought to stir us up to greater
diligence and pains in the true worship of God.
For why? shall superstitious persons be so painful in their superstitions,
and shall we take no pains in the true worship and service of God? (for
example) shall a superstitious Papist rise early, and break his sleep to
perform his blind devotion to go to his mass, and will thou on the Lords
Sabbath lie loitering and bathing thy self in thy bed? it is the fashion of
the most, on other days to rise earelie, but on the Lords day to take their
ease, and to rise only to trick and to trim up their bodies, but not to
break one minute of an hours sleep to trim, and prepare their souls to
meet that Lord in the public assembly; well let us take knowledge of this
to be a fault? Exodus 32.6. it is said when Aaron had yielded to the people for
the making of the golden calfe, the people did rise earelie in the morning to
offer burnt offerings and peace offerings, let then the diligence and pains of
superstitious persons shame us and stir us up to greater diligence in the
true worship of God, if it do not, certainly it shall one day judge and
condemn us; and withal remember that it is a gracious thing to emploie our
bodies and all the parts and members of them diligently and painefullie in Gods
worship and service, to break our sleep, and with our eyes to prevent the
morning light, as David says, Psalm. 119.147.148. with our feet to trudge and
run after the preaching of the word with our ears to attend to it, striving
against dullness and drowsiness, no doubt pains taken in this kind, will be
a comfort unto us when we come to want the use of our members, when our eyes
wax dim, our ears heavy of hearing, and the strength of our whole bodies,
through age or sickness is much decayed, yet without question it will be a
comfort unto us, and cheer up our hearts, if we can remember they have been
heretofore painefully used in the true worship and service of God.

Again, let us a little further consider the pains of superstitious
Superstitious persons dealing hardly with their own bodies to serve the Lord
(as they do imagine) ought to shame us if we employ not our wealth and the
things without our bodies to the honor and glory of God.
shall superstitious persons not spare their own bodies, but deal hardly with
them, thereby serving God as they do imagine, and shall we spare things that are
without our bodies, I mean our wealth, and the outward good things of this
life, and not employ them to the honor and glory of God, and wherein we may
be sure to do good service to God, bestowing them liberally on the members of
Christ to good uses? let that be far from us, how shall we be able to
stand before the judge of all the world, when he shall say to us, the
Idolaters in their superstitions spared not their own bodies, and yet you in
the way of truth, have spared to honor me with your goods? or how may we
think we shall be able to glorify God by shedding of our blood (if the Lord
should call us unto it, if we now be hardly drawn to do him service with our
outward goods? It may be we are painful in prayer, in hearing the word, and
in other spiritual exercises, (and yet the number of them is but few, who are
painful in these things) but when it comes to this, that we are to do such
duties as cannot be done without cost, and without charge and trouble.

Oh how many of us shrink and draw back, and strive to put others before
them, far unlike to good King David, who said: 2. Sam. 24 24. I will not
offer a burnt offering unto the Lord my God, of that which does cost me
nothing: as if he had said, if I serve God without cost and charge, how shall
it appear that I do it in love, in obedience, and in conscience toward God?
Thus ought every Christian to say with himself, if I serve God in prayer, and
in spiritual exercises, and not in duties of love and mercy, even to my cost
and charge, how shall I manifest the sincerity of my faith, and of my love
toward God? I will therefore serve God, not only in spiritual duty, but in
such manner as shall be costly and chargeable to me, and howsoever the
Papists do this, thinking thereby to merit, yet let us do it respecting only
Gods glory, for that indeed ought to be more precious and dear to us then any
merit, and if it be not, our hearts are not right within us.

(not sparing the body) in that the Apostle says, that in hard usage of the
body, consisted a show of wisdom, Rigorous and hard dealing with the body is
but a vain show of wisdom.
we may easily gather that rigorous, inhumane, and hard dealing with the body,
and vexing the body, is but a color of wisdom its no part of true wisdom
derived from the wisdom of God, revealed in his word, we find it as an
approved rule of nature, and brought in by the Apostle himself to persuade
men to love their wives, Ephesians. 5.29. he brings it as a constant rule never
failing, no man (says he) ever yet hated his own flesh: no man well in his
wits, not mad or drunk, foolish or desperate, hated his own body, but
nourishes and cherishes it, even nature it self teaches thus much: let then
our adversaries, the Papists boast and brag of their outside of holiness,
standing in not sparing the body, in strict fasts, canonical hours, hard
fare, bad lodging, course apparel The Papists vainly boast of their holiness
standing in hard dealing with their bodies.
as glorious and excellent things whereby indeed they ensnare many a simple
soul, but let us know that these things are but outward shows and semblances,
there is no true wisdom in them, indeed we are not to pamper our bodies, it
will soon bring the spirit under the flesh, which is a miserable thraldom,
but we must labor to keep under other corruption of our bodies and souls,
that is, the beating of our bodies, the Apostle speaks of 1. Corinthians. We are
not so to beat down our bodies as that we enfeeble them and destroy nature and
make them unfit for good duties.
withholding from them meat and drink, and other things needful, as that we
enfeeble them, or destroy nature, and make them unfit for any good duty, that's
a grievous sin to deal so hardly with the body, and that for many reasons:
our bodies are the work of Gods hand, as well as the soul, they are made to
be instruments of our souls for many good uses: even to the promoting of Gods
kingdom, by speech, by administration and receiving the sacraments, and
helping of our brethren: they are the temples of the holy Ghost, members of
Christ and shall be glorified together with our souls, and therefore,
howsoever we are to keep under the corruption both of body and soul, yet are
we not by any means to destroy nature and the strength of our bodies, but we
are to hold an even course between the excess, and defect, and in one word,
our rule in this case is this, our bodies are so to be used, in respect of meat
and drink, sleep, recreation etc. that they may be fit instruments of our
souls, for the exercise of every good duty, in the way of repentance, in Gods
worship, and toward our brethren, and to this end we may lawfully use means
of comfort, and refreshing, and of preservation of the strength and abilities
of our bodies, as the Apostle bids Timothy, 1. Tim. 5.23. drink no longer
water; but use alittle wine for thy stomachs sake, and thine own infirmities.

Come we now to the last word of this verse, wherein the Apostle does directly
answer to the objection, and remooues by strength of reason. These words are
diversely read, some read thus (neither have they it in any estimation to
satisfy the flesh) with relation to the body, but the original runs thus
word for word, (are not in any honor to the filling of the flesh) and so (as I
take it) they may better be thus read, (but are of no value, save to filling of
the flesh, with respect to the decrees (of not touching, nor tasting, nor
handling) and that they are of no honor, no estimation or value, the reason is
from the use of them, they serve but to fill the flesh, by (flesh) we are here
to understand the lust and desire of corrupt nature, they are of no value, save
for the filling of the lust of corrupt nature.

Where observe we that the Apostle having said, that in the practice of those
decrees, of not touching, not tasting, and not handling, there was hard usage
of the body, yet here he reasons against them, as tending to the filling of
the lust of the flesh; the point hence offered is this.

Men may deal hardly with the flesh, and yet therein be carnal and they may
seem in their doctrine and practice to be spiritual, and yet therein be
carnal.
and yet be fleshly, men may deal hardly with the flesh, and yet therein be
carnal, and the reason is plain, from the words of the Apostle: they may in
not sparing the body, satisfy the lust and desire of their own sinful
hearts, yea, the conclusion is general, men may seem in their doctrine, and
practice to be spiritual, and yet therein be fleshly and carnal. 1. Ioh. 4.1.
says John believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of
God: he calls the doctrine of false teachers, (spirits) seeming indeed to be
spiritual, and yet he says ver. 5. they are of the world, and this indeed is
the mystery of Antichristianisme, thus is it in the whole body of popery, that
religion seems to be most spiritual, yet if we look into it, and have our
eyes opened to discern aright, we shall see, Popish religion seeming most
spiritual discovered to be most fleshly and carnal.
it is most fleshly and carnal it turns spiritual service into corporal,
standing in massing, pomp and music to delight the outward senses it says,
sinners, must have Gods pardon, or they cannot be saved, but withal it
teaches they may have it by the power of the keys for money, and that they may
by merits of other men, and though in death men fail of repentance, yet for
money they may be eased in Purgatory, with a thousand like things most pleasing
to nature, no marvel then though men of their own accord be so strongly
affected to popetie, Note.
and once being taken in that snare, are so hardly drawn out of it, we are
not to marvel at it, and for our selves in that it is so, that wherein men
seem to be spiritual, they may notwithstanding be carnal.

We are to look to our selves, and to our hearts in the We must take heed we
be not carnal in our practice of spiritual duties.
for as the Apostle says 1. Corinthians. 13.3. a man may give all his goods to the
poor, yea give his body to be burned, and yet want love, so we may do holy
and good duties, and yet in doing them want love to Gods glory, and fear to
his name, and do them to satisfy the lust of our own carnal hearts, for
pride, vaineglory or some other sinister and by-respect, we are therefore to
examine our hearts in the doing of good duetyes.

One thing more observe we, the Apostle we see reasons against the decrees of
men, tending to the satisfying of the flesh, its then a fault to satisfy the
lust and corruption It is a fault to tisfie the lust and corruption of the
flssh.
the Apostle makes it an opposite member to the putting on of Christ, Romans
13.14. put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and take no thought for the flesh to
fulfill the lusts thereof: and is this a fault? then doubtless far greater
is the sin of such as use means to stir up the lust and corruption of
their own flesh, as drunkards use to eat salt meats, to take Tobacco, and use
other means to whet and sharpen their thirst, There sin is exceeding great
who use means to stir up the lust and corruption of their own flesh. Note.
as may inflame their lust, and make ready their hearts like an oven, as the
Prophet speaks, Hos. 7 6. without question that is a most horrible sin, let
such persons as deal thus, know, that in so doing they even tempt the Devil
himself, they dispose their hearts to sin, and discover the corruption of
them in the sight of the Devil, and so even tempt him to tempt them, and
allure him as the thief is allured by the booty to set upon men, which is a
fearful thing, and such as must needs provoke the Lord to wrath in fearful
manner, and bring down his heavy judgments on them that use it, let such as
are guilty of this sin think on it, and learn to reform themselves.

THE THIRD CHAPTER.
VERSE. 1. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God.


Our Apostle having now absolved, and finished the first material part of his
Epistle, and showed in the first Chapter that the doctrine delivered to the
(Colossians) was the truth and confirmed it, and persuaded to continuance in
it, and having in the second Chapter confuted contrary errors, and corruptions
of false teachers who sought to thrust on the Colossians other things besides
Christ, or with Christ, as means of salvation, partly, out of Philosophy, and
partly, out of the Ceremonial law: the Apostle, I say, having thus laid down
the truth of Christian doctrine and confuted contrary errors, and so ended his
first part of this Epistle.

The se d part of the Epistle.
In this Chapter he comes to the second part of it, (namely) to entreat of
Christian life and conversation, showing how Christians ought to walk and
behave themselves both in respect of God, and men, both in their general and
special callings, whereunto he exhorts in these two Chapters following.

This Chapter consists of two parts. The first a general exhortation. The
second a comprehension of certain special Christian duties.
This third Chapter consists of these two parts.

The first, is an exhortation to all Christians, generally as they are
Christians and professors of the Gospel from the 1. verse to the 18.

The second part is a comprehension of certain special duties of Christians,
as they have relation one to another in some particular state and condition of
life, as of the duty of wives toward their husbands, children toward their
parents, servants toward their masters; the Apostle exhorting thereunto from
the 18. verse of this Chapter to the second verse of the 4. Chapter.

The general exhortation subdivided.
Now the general exhortation may be again subdivided: it contains in it an
exhortation to seek, and to effect heavenly things, from the first verse to
the fifth, and then an exhortation to Christian duties of the moral Law, to
duties required of Christians in the Commandments of God, and first to the
duties of the second Table, from the 5. verse to the 16. and then to duties of
the first Table in the 16. and 17. verses.

Now then the four first verses of this Chapter contain an exhortation to
seek, and to effect things above, and not things on the earth, and that
exhortation is expounded and urged in the 1. and 2. verses, and then in the 3.
and 4. verses is that removed which might discourage from that seeking and
affecting of things above.

In this first verse, more specially we have the Apostles exhortation to seek
things that are above, which is amplified by the place where they are (namely)
where Christ is in heaven, together with the glorious state of Christ there,
that he sits at the right hand of God. Seek those things which are above
(where Christ sits etc.) And this exhortation is urged by an argument taken
from the efficient cause of that seeking (namely) fellowship with Christ in his
resurrection, and it may be thus framed: If you be risen with Christ, then
seek those things which are above, but you are risen with Christ, that is
grounded on the 12. and 13. verses of the Chapter before, where the Apostle
says, as many as believed, were buried with Christ, and raised up with him:
and so he brings in this argument as a consequent on that, if then, or, if
therefore ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above: So then
the sum and substance of this verse is this, an exhortation to the Colossians
to seek things above, where Christ is in glory at the right hand of God, urged
from their fellowship with Christ in his resurrection.

Come we to the words of it as they are laid down by the Apostle, and first of
these words: (If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
above.) If then, or if therefore (says the Apostle) with relation to that
which went before, Chap. 2.12.13. Interpretation.
(be risen with Christ) to be risen with Christ, is to have fellowship with
Christ in his resurrection, being one with him by the bond of his spirit, and
by faith to be partakers both of the benefit of his resurrection, (namely) of a
full absolution from sin and justification, and of the virtue and power of
his resurrection to our vivification, to a raising of us up, and quickening of
us to newness of life in this life, and to the raising up of our bodies to
life everlasting, at the day of judgment. (Seek) this word (seek) is
Metaphorical, borrowed and taken from those that seek, and search for
somethings which they would gladly find; and the meaning of the Apostle is,
bestow all kind of endeavor, and labor, use all good means to attain all
those things which are above (by things above) the Apostle means, things in
heaven, and yet not things in heaven secret, and hid from us which are not able
to conceive and comprehend, (for there be things in heaven which eye has not
seen, care has not heard, and which the heart of man is not able to conceive)
but things revealed to the eye of faith in the Scripture, that is, the ioies
and glory made known to be in heaven, and especially the heavenly and eternal
life, with all things belonging to it, as (namely) perfect knowledge of God and
of Christ; perfect love of God, and our brethren, and consequently, perfect
concord, peace, and tranquillity of mind, charity, chastity, truth, and
sincerity, and a perfect transforming of our minds and wills to the will of
God; for these, and such like, are the things above in heaven, and these the
Apostle would have the Colossians to seek after, (for his drift was to
persuade to holiness of life) thus then briefly conceive we these words, as
if the Apostle had said, If ye then be one with Christ by faith and by the
bond of his spirit, have fellowship with him in the benefit, and power of his
resurrection, bestow all endeavor and labor, use all good means to obtain
the ioies and glory, and that blessed life, that's made known to be in heaven,
with all things belonging to it.

Here, first observe we briefly, before we come to the handling of the words
of this verse, the Apostles method, his order of proceeding in this Epistle,
he first delivers truth of Doctrine, and confutes contrary errors, and then
comes to exhortation, and to persuade to good life, and conversation.

Unto teaching of the truth, and confuting of errors must be added exhortation
to godly life.
Hence we plainly see, it is not enough, to teach the truth and to confute
errors, but to that must be added exhortation to godly life, and this we shall
find, to be an ordinary, and constant course, held by our Apostle, in all his
Epistles, to instance, in one, in stead of the rest, in his Epistle to the
Romans having laid down the doctrine of free justification, and of
sanctification, the use of the law, deliverance from the rigor of it by
Christ, the calling of the Gentiles, and reiection of the Jews: Chapter 12.1.
he comes to exhort to good life, and says: I beseech you therefore brethren by
the mercies of God etc. the reason of this order is given by the Apostle, Tit.
2.11.12. It is not enough for men to know the doctrine of the gospel,

This then in the first place concerns the teachers of the The duty of
teachers.
they must not only teach the truth and confute errors; but they must also
join to their teaching exhortation to good life.

Again must teaching and exhortation be conjoined, Where doctrine and
exhortation are joined together, it is the duty of good hearers to make use of
both.
then where this order is observed, whereunto doctrine is added exhortation, it
is not enough for us to have knowledge of the truth, and to have errors rooted
out of our minds, (that is but to answer one part of our teaching) we must be
further answerable to our teaching, and according to the same be careful to
lead a godly, righteous; and sober life; let us not deceive our selves, if we
say we are of a sound religion, we hate the Pope, and all superstitious, and
false doctrine, and yet walk in our old wicked ways, and works of
darkness, surely our state is no better, (nay it is far worse) then the
state of the poor blind Papists, and other heretics. Remember what our
Savior says: Luke 12.47. (That servant that knows his Masters will, and
prepares not himself, neither does according to his will, shall be beaten with
many stripes, and the 48. verse (to whom much is given, of him shall much be
required.) If the Lord trust us with much knowledge, certainly he will look
for much obedience at our hands.

Now to the doctrine offered from the words of this verse, we are first to
consider the Apostles argument, he labors to persuade the Colossians to seek
things above, and that they endeavor by all good means, to attain things in
heaven, and especially, an holy, and heavenly life, a life in some measure like
to that of Angels and Saints in heaven, by an argument taken from their
fellowshippe with Christ in his resurrection, that being one with him by faith,
and so pertakers of the benefit of his resurrection to their justification,
they should seek after an heavenly life.

A true feeling of our selves to have part in Christ his benefits and merits is
a most powerful argument to stir us up to an holy and heavenly life.
and the finding of our selves thereby made partakers of the merits, and
benefits of his death, of his resurrection, and of other his works of
mediation is as strong an argument and motive, as any possible can be to stir
us up to endeavor to become holy, and lead an holy and heavenly life, nothing
is more powerful and more preuayling to move men to lead a life in some
degree like to the life of Angels, and Saints in heaven, then to feel
themselves to have part in the merits of Christ his death and resurrection, and
other his works of mediation. For why? we being one with Christ by faith and
thereby finding the comforts that are in Christ, to belong to us, and that we
through him are within compass of Gods special love, it cannot but move us
to love him again, as Saint John says: 1. John. 4.19. (We love him because he
loved us first:) Gods love first felt warm, and comfortable in our hearts will
undoubtedly kindle in them, an ardent love of God again, can we find our
selves within compass of Gods special love, and favor be assured of his
comfortable presence, and protection, of our portion in his promise of life,
and salvation, of right and title to all the comforts and blessings belonging
to the Saints of God in this life, and forever, and not to be moved to love
God again, and to study to show our selves thankful to him in all holy
obedience, it is not possible?

(If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above) And upon
this ground, The doctrine of free justification by faith in Christ, is unjustly
charged to set open a gappe to looseness of life.
let us take knowledge of this that it is but a sophisme, and a deceit thrust
upon some men by strong delusion of the Devil, to say (as the Papists use to
say) that the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ, that the doctrine
we teach, that we being one with Christ by faith, are partakers of his life,
death, and resurrection, and all his works of mediation to our justification
is a doctrine of liberty, and that it makes men licentious, sets open a gap to
all looseness of life, that cannot be, that doctrine is indeed, the original
and ground of all sincere and holy obedience; and if we think, that we by
faith apprehend the merit of Christ his death and resurrection, for the
remission of our sins, and justification, and yet be wanting in duty and
thankfulness to God, and live a profane, a licentious and loose life; we
deceive our selves, yea we are yet in our sins, if our hearts be possessed
with such deceiving thoughts; never was any heart by faith made one with
Christ, and bathed in his blood, but it was thereby made soft, pliable, and
obedient to God, and tender, loving, and feelingly affected toward men; yea
certainly a lively feeling in our hearts of the comforts in Christ, and of Gods
mercy, in and through him, will set our heads a work to devise (if it were
possible) some retribution, and cause us to say with David, Psalm. 116.12. What
shall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits toward me.

In the next place, we are to mark the phrase and form of speech here used
by the Apostle, he says not (If ye believe that Christ is risen:) but (If ye
be risen with Christ) I have already showed from this manner of speaking in
the Chapter before, 12. verse, the near union that is between Christ and his
true members, and that when he died, and rose again, they died, and rose with
him, together with the use, that nothing can disapoint them of the benefit of
Christ his death, and resurrection, I will not now again stand on those
things, but from hence we are further taught thus much.

We must first find in our selves the power of Christ his resurrection raising
us from the death of sin to newness of life.
for our justification; but we must find our selves risen with him, that is,
we must find our selves partakers of the power of his resurrection to raise us
from the death of sin to newness of life; this is one principal effect of
the virtue of Christ his resurrection, spoken of by the Apostle, Phil. 3.10.
and the virtue of Christ his resurrection is the power of his Godhead, or of
his spirit whereby he mightily raised himself from death to life; and one
notable effect of that power is the raising of his members, from the death of
sin to newness of life, and this power we must find effectual in our
selves, as the Apostle has taught it plainly, Romans 6.4. and in diverse other
places, no doubt we have the point in speculation, we have often heard of it.

A strong motive to stir us up to this duty is this, that Christ his
resu^rection is no comfort to us if we be not risen with him.
and to this purpose, consider we but this one thing; Christ his resurrection
is a ground of excellent comfort, and without that all our comfort in Christ is
nothing; the Apostle has said it, 1. Cor. 13.15. (If Christ be not risen, our
faith is but vain, and we are yet in our sins.) Now then consider it,
howsoever it is most true, that Christ is risen, and his resurrection is a
singulat comfort to all his true members, yet to us it is no comfort if we be
not risen with him, if we be not raised from the death of sin, to the life of
righteousness by the power of his resurrection, he is not risen to us as a
Savior and a conqueror over sin, hell, death, and damnation, but as a judge
to condemn us: and this we may easily gather out of Revel. 20.6. Blessed is he
that has his portion in the first resurrection, (that is) in rising from sin
to newness of life (for ^uer him the second death has no power.) Hereupon it
follows strongly on the contrary, he that has not part in the first
resurrection, he that is not raised from the death of sin, to the life of
righteousness, he shall certainly feel and endure the pains of the second
death, over him it shall have power.

Let us not therefore content our selves to say, we believe, as it is in the
Creed, that Christ rose again from the dead: that is no better then the
implicit and infolded faith of the Papists, who say they believe as the Church
believes, not knowing what the Church believes; such a faith will not comfort
us in the hour of temptation: let us never rest till we find our selves
risen with Christ, till we feel the power of his resurrection, raising us up
from the death of sin to newness of life, and that indeed will comfort us,
when we stand in need of comfort, and give us assurance that the comfort and
benefit of Christ his resurrection belongs to us; yea, that will give us
assurance that the Lords mercy will never fail us, Note.
he having wrought in us by his spirit, and made us of vile wretches, vessels
of grace and holiness; of mansions of the Devil, temples of the holy Ghost,
certainly his grace, mercy and goodness shall never fail, nor forsake us,
yea this is it that will assure us that our faith shall never fail.

It follows, (Seek those things which are above) (that is) endeavor,
labor, and use all good means to attain them.

Hence we are plainly taught, that we must give all diligence, We must give all
diligence that we may attain an heavenly life.
that we may truly know God, and Christ, and our selves, and may truly love
God, and our brethren, and conform our minds and wills to the holy will of
God, we must seek for it, as for the thing we would gladly find, thus has
our Savior commanded, Mat. 6.33. Seek ye first the kingdom of God, etc. and
Mat. 13.45. he compares the kingdom of heaven to a Merchant that seeks good
pearls, thereby teaching us to use earnest endeavor to attain not only the
reward of glory in heaven, but an heavenly conformity, with the blessed Angels,
and Saints in this life, and the reason is manifest, is very hard, there be
many things to hinder it, as the power of our enemies, the Devil and his
Angels, the lust, and corruption of our own hearts, the evil examples that be
in the world, and manifold troubles and trials, that stand up, and oppose
against it, therefore we must use most earnest endeavor, and break through
all difficulties to attain it.





Reproof of careless and carnal people who never care to seek after
heavenly things, or seek them negligently.
and think they may find that which they never sought, and seek as though
they cared not whether they found or no, yea they stick not to say that
heavenly things may be sought, but other things must be sought after, turning
that saying of Christ, (First seek the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness, and then all things shall be ministered unto you) clean
contrary; first seek other things, and then the kingdom of God.

A motive to stir us up to a diligent seeking after heavenly things.
Now then to stir us up to greater diligence in seeking after an heavenly
conformity, with the blessed angels and Saints; consider only thus much, we
know not how soon the Lord may bring us to a trial, whether we have
earnestly sought after it, or no, and as then such as have sought heavenly
things diligently, shall find and feel unspeakable comfort, which they would
not miss for all the world, they shall find boldness to speak to GOD by
prayer, and assurance to be heard: so on the other side such as have had no
care to seek after heavenly things, shall find themselves in time of trial,
in a miserable case, feeling no comfort, nor daring to speak to God with any
hope to be heard, the Lord himself has said? Prou. 1.28, that then they shall
call upon him, but he will not answer, they shall seek him early, but they
shall not find him: and that's an heavy thing; when the afflicted are forsaken
of men, yet this refuge they have, that they may pray to God, but if they find
no comfort nor help from him, their state then is most wretched, let us think
on it, and let it stir us now while we have time, and before the evil day
come upon us, earnestly to seek after heavenly things.

One thing more we are to observe from these words (namely) the object of our
seeking, expressed by the Apostle, to be (things above in Heaven) in that the
Apostle makes the object of our seeking, things above in heaven.

We are taught thus much, that we are not to content Such as are made alive
with Christ are not to rest contented in using means to reach to the holiness
of the best that now live or heertofore did live on the face of the earth,
being but mere men, but they must endeavor after that holiness that is found
in heaven.
as the object of our endeavor and labor, but we must seek after things
higher, even in heaven, in a word more plainly, (keeping to the purpose of the
Apostle, which was to persuade to an heavenly life) we are here taught, that
as many as are made alive with Christ, and quickened by virtue of his
resurrection, are not to content themselves with their endeavor and labor,
and using all good means to reach the holiness of the best man now living on
the face of the earth, or that ever lived in the world, being but a mere man,
I say a mere man to except Christ, who was more, even God and man, howsoever
we are to follow the example of such as are good and godly, 1. Cor. 11.1. be ye
followers of me, even as I am of Christ: yet are we not to rest contented in
using means to reach the holiness of any man or woman, the most holy now
living, or heretofore living on the face of the earth.

Elias, Iam. 5.17. may be truly said of all Gods children, living in this
world, they are subject to passions, they have their infirmities, therefore no
man, the most holy that is, is a perfect pattern of holiness, and consequently
we are not to rest contented in using means, to attain the holiness of the
best man living in this world, we are not there to pitch down our rest, but we
are to endeavor by all good means, to aspire to that holiness, that is found
in heaven, it must be one part of our daily prayer, (as we are taught by our
Savior) that we may do the will of God here in earth as it is done above in
heaven.



The best and the most holy that are, must take notice of their want of
holiness and labor to aspire to a greater measure.
hereby the best of us may find how short we are of that we ought to come to,
no doubt if we compare our selves with others of the Saints and children of
God, that yet live in this world, we shall find we come far behind them in
many graces, much more are we short of that holiness that is found in heaven, I
speak not this to make sad the hearts of any, that truly endeavor after
holiness in regard of their great weakness, no certainly, the least measure
of saving grace is pleasing to God in Christ, but I speak it to stir us up
yet further, to seek after grace, and holiness, and to be displeased with our
selves, in regard of our wants and our imperfections, let us every one, even
those that have the greatest measure of holiness remember, that we must not
rest contented to reach the holiness of the best in this life, but we are to
labor and endeavor after that holiness that is found in heaven, and let us
with our Apostle: Phil. 3.13. forget that which is behind and endeavor our
selves unto that which is before: and still press forward, and follow hard
toward the mark etc. the greater measure of holiness we come to, Note.
the greater will be our comfort in this life, and the greater our glory in
heaven.

Come we now to the amplification of this exhortation in the words following,
(where Christ sits at the right hand of God) in these words the Apostle does
express the place where those things above to be sought for, are (namely)
where Christ is in heaven, and withal he does show the glorious state of
Christ in heaven, that there he sits at the right hand of God, we must stand a
while to open the meaning of the words (where Christ sits, etc.) that is, in
heaven where Christ is, for as the Apostle says. Ephesians. 1.20. Interpretation.
he set him at his right hand in the heavenly places. Now in that he says,
there he sits at the right hand of God; this form of speech is metaphorical,
and its spoken by way of similitude, to bring down to our reach and
understanding the glorious state of Christ in heaven, that there he is advanced
to an infinite, and unspeakable height of glory, for indeed in proper speech
God has neither right hand nor left, neither can be said to sit, or stand, he
is a spirit infinite incomprehensible, filling heaven, and earth, this form of
speech, then is it not to be taken in the proper signification of the words,
but as a borrowed speech, its taken from the manner of kings on the earth, who
use to set those at their right hand, whom they purpose most of all to honor,
1, King. 2.19. Solomon in token of honor caused a seat to be set for his
mother, and she sat at his right hand, or it is taken from the manner of some
great King, who haueing one only son, his first begotten, who shall be his
heir, and succed him in his Kingdom. He makes him to sit at his right hand,
that he may rule in his Kingdom with him, and exercise power and authority,
over all things belonging to the Kingdom, so then by this form of speech
(that Christ sits at the right hand of God) two things are signified. Two
things are signified by Christ his sitting at Gods right hand.


First, that Christ is exalted to unspeakable glory in heaven, 1. Timoth. 3.16.
that he there is partaker of the glory of his father, for the word (God) does
here signify God the father, and the author to the Hebrews says, Heb. 1.3.
that he sits at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places.

Secondly, by this phrase is signified, that Christ is exalted to a full
administration of his Kingdom: even to be the head of his Church, and with
his father to be Lord, and governor of heaven and earth, having all power
given to him both in heaven and earth, as himself says: Matthew. 28.18. and
this the Apostle shows plainly, Ephesians. 1. where having said, verse. 20. that
Christ is set at the right hand of his father: he presently subioynes by way of
exposition, that he is exalted, far above all principality and that all
things are made subject unto him, and he made the head of the Church, 1. Pet.
3.22. the Apostle says, he is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, to
whom the Angels and powers, and might, are subject.



he began to reign after his ascension into heaven, and again considered as
man alone, he is not Lord and King, but as man received into unity of person
with the Godhead, and subsisting in the second person of the Trinity, thus then
we are to conceive the words of the Apostle, as if he had said thus:

In heaven where Christ as God incarnate, and as man personally united to his
Godhead, where Christ, God and man, or man and God, both enjoy fullness of
glory, and is exalted to be Lord and King of heaven and earth, even to rule and
govern with his father all things both in heaven and earth.

First, observe we here that the Apostle does point out the place of Christ
his advancement to glory (namely) above in heaven, for in saying (where Christ
sits at the right hand of God) he gives us to understand, that above Though
Christ his Kingdom reach to all things, yet does he as God and man rule in
fulness of glory in heaven.
and though Christ his Kingdom extend it self over all things, yet in heaven
alone does Christ, as God and also as man rule in fullness of glory and Majesty.

Hence it is that the Apostle does expressly and distinctly set down the place
of his exaltation to be in the highest heavens, Ephesians. 20. that he sits at
Gods right hand in the heavenly places: and again, Heb. 1.3. its said, that
he sits at the right hand of Majesty in the highest places: and this meets
with that error of some, Confutation of that conceit, that Christ his sitting
at the right hand of his father proves his presence every where in his manhood.
whereas indeed, his sitting at the right hand of his father rightly understood
is rather a confutation, then any confirmation of that conceit, because his
sitting at the right hand of God, is his manifest exaltation, to rule in
fullness of glory, and that is (according to the doctrine of the Apostle) in
the highest heavens and not elsewhere.

Gods right hand is every where, Christ sits at the right hand of God,
therefore his manhood is every where, is a mere fallation and deceitful kind
of reasoning.



Christ in his manhood personally united to his Godhead does enjoy unspeakable
glory in heaven.
even in our nature, Chist in his manhood personally united to his Godhead* is
partaker of unspeakable glory, not only infinitely exceeding the glory of all
the sons of men, whose glory is less then a shadow in comparison of it, but
also of the most holy and glorious Angels, as the Apostle says, Phil. 2.9. God
has highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, and Heb. 1.13.
says the holy Ghost, unto which of the Angels, said he at any time, sit at my
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool, giving us to understand,
that his glory is far above the glory of the most glorious angels, yea, such is
the visible glory and brightness of Christ his manhood, that its said to be the
light of Confutation of Christ his bodily presence in the Sacrament.
Reu. 21.23. and this light and glory cannot be separated from the body of
Christ, how then can he be present in body (as the Papists say) in the
sacrament, and not be seen of any, is it possible, no certainly, its as much as
to give the lie to the holy Ghost, and to say, that Christ's body is not
glorious in heaven.

The use of this point for our selves, is full of It is a great comfort to all
true believers that Christ is now most glorious in himself, for he will one
day be most glorious in in his members also.
(to them belongs the comfort of it, and let not others meddle with it) as many
as are true believing members of Christ, may hence gather matter of exceeding
great comfort, for why? is it so that Christ our head is already possessed of
unspeakable glory in heaven? then certainly in time he will make us pertakers
of the same, he now is most glorious in himself, he will one day be most
glorious in his members, it is one part of his prayer, John 17.24. That his
members should be with him, and be partakers of his glory. And the Apostle
says plainly, Phil. 3.21. He shall change our vile body, that it may be
fashioned like unto his glorious body. How then shall not this fill the hearts
of all true believers with abundance of comfort, howsoever in this world we
are despised, made as the refuse, and ofscouring of all things, had in
derision, and be scorned and contemned of the world, yet as the holy Ghost
exhorts, Heb. 12.2. Let us look up to Jesus the author, and finisher of our
faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and
despised the shames and is now at the right hand of God. And remember that he
has prepared like glory for us in heaven, and it will make us endure the
cross, and despise the shame; yea let such as now, either lie under some
lingering disease or are pinched in their bodies, with hunger, cold, nakedness,
and their bodies are tossed from post to pillar, buffeted, beaten, spit on, and
many ways abused; yet they believing in Christ, let them think on this to
their comfort, that those distressed, or any way abused bodies of theirs, shall
one day be clothed with glory, and made like the glorious body of Christ
Jesus; yea remember that this is a thing so clear, and so certain, that the
Apostle doubts not to affirm, that we already sit with Christ in heavenly
places, Ephesians. 2.6. Let then as many as truly believe in Christ think on
this, as an infaliible truth to their comfort.

Christ our head and Savior is Lord and King of all things, gogouerning his
Church in special manner, and exercising his power to the confusion of such as
oppose him.
is Lord and King of all things, governing his Church and members in this world
in special manner, gathering them out of the world, guiding them in the way to
heaven, exercising them under afflictions and temptations, to spiritual
obedience, supporting them in their troubles, and defending them against the
rage of all enemies whatsoever, and again, exercising his power over all that
oppose themselves to his kingdom, to their utter confusion, that place Ephesians.
1.22. makes this manifest. The Apostle says that Christ sitting at the right
hand of God, is made head to his Church, to govern it as a head, and that all
other things are under his feet, and especially the enemies of his kingdom, to
tread them down at his pleasure, for howsoever the enemies of his Church are
under his feet, to tread them down when he will, yet he suffers them for a
time to exercise some power, and rage over his Church in this life, Note.
because he will have his members made conformable to himself, in a measure
of suffering, and some among the enemies of his Church belong to the election
of grace, and he will not destroy them with the rest, and because the number of
the elect is not yet full, but in the end he will bring them to utter
destruction, and to strengthen our faith in this, we see that Christ our Lord
and King, does sometimes manifest his power in bringing to naught the plots and
devises of the enemies of his Church, and in bringing confusion upon them, as
he did on those Gunpouder-Traitors, who intended the overthrow of the Gospel,
Comfort to all that truly believe in Christ against the fear of any adversary
power whatsoever.
or policy, but only to the all-sufficient defending power of Jesus Christ, to
him alone belongs the praise and glory of that our great deliverance, and to
him we must show our selves thankful, and let the consideration of Christ his
great power, comfort and encourage all that believe in him, against the fear of
any adversary power whatsoever, lets know whatsoever the enemies of Christ and
his Church, Antichrist, and the rest do against his members, they shall not
prevail to the hurt of their souls, Christ sits in heaven, and ouer-rules
them, limiting their power, and their rage, and in the end he will utterly
destroy it, yea they may as well pull Christ out of his seat in heaven, as one
of his members out of his hands, and that is an excellent comfort, for all
that truly believe in Christ.

VER. 3. Set your affections on things which are above, and not on things which
are on the earth.
In this verse, we have the other part, or branch of the Apostles exhortation
propounded, wherein he does exhort the Collossians to mind, and affect things
above, Set your affections on things which are above, and this is further
enlarged by dehortation from the contrary, that they do not mind nor affect
things on earth:) And not on things etc.)

The word here translated (Set your affections, Interpretation.
etc.) is a general word comprehending the actions, and operations, both of
the understanding and will; we find it in Scripture, applied to both, but
most commonly to the actions of will and affections, which are particular
motions of the will, and so it may be well rendered as here it is (Set, etc.)
or as we have it, Romans 8.5. (savor) the meaning of the Apostle is this, (mind
and affect) and in particular, let your thoughts and meditations, your care,
your desire, your love, and longing, be set on things above, (by things above)
as before was showed, we are to understand the ioies and glory of heaven, and
especially the heavenly life, that is made known to be in heaven, and all
things belonging to it, as perfect knowledge of God, and of Christ, perfect
love of God and of our brethren, and a perfect conformity of mind and will to
the will of God, (and not on things which are on the earth) By things on the
earth the Apostle means things of this life, things that pertain only to
the mainetenance of natural life in this world, as meat, drink, apparel,
rich etc. even all things whatsoever they be, serving either for our
necessity, or for our delight in this life only,; therefore 1. Cor. 7.31. the
Apostle shuts them up under one word, even under the names of this world
(they that used this world) meaning the things of this world, serving for our
our use only in this life, thus then we are to conce^^e the Apostles meaning
in the words of this verse, as if he had thus spoken.

Mind, and affect, let your meditations, thoughts, and musings, your care,
your desire, your love, and longing, be set on the ioies and glory of heaven,
and especially, on that heavenly life that is made known to be in heaven, and
on all things belonging to it, and pull away your minds, and affections, your
thought, your care, your desire, and your love, from all earthly things
whatsoever, serving either for necessity, or for delight in this life only;
now here:

First, we are to mark, that our Apostle was not content to say (Seek things
above, etc.) endeavor and labor by all good means to attain them, but he
adds to this, (set your affections on things which are above.)

We must not only seek the things that are above in heaven, but we must also
mind and affect them.
Hence, we are given to understand thus much, that it is not enough for us to
seek the things that are above, the things made known to be in heaven, but we
must mind and affect them, our thoughts must run upon them, and our hearts
must be lift up above all earthly things, and set on things found at the right
hand of God in heaven, thither must our care, thither must our desire our love
and longing be carried, for why? as our Savior has taught us, Math. 6.20. Our
treasure must be in heaven, and there also must our hearts be, yea certainly,
as he says in that place, If your treasure be in heaven, there will your
hearts be also, our hearts will follow our treasures. 1. Pet. 1.4. the Apostle
says, (our inheritance) even that which all true believers look to be
possessed of (is in heaven) therefore it is meet that our minds should be
there.

Now for the reason of this duty,

We see then our duty, let us hereby examine our selves, Most men are defective
in this duty, they do not mind and affect heavenly things.
I fear me the most of us shall find our selves much wanting, and far short
of that we ought to come unto. Do our thoughts ever run on heavenly things?
Are our minds and affections fully set and fixed on them? Surely if we deal
truly with our selves, I doubt we shall find that the thoughts of most of us
are otherwise taken up, and that our care, desire, love, and longing, are spent
on other things, to pass by such as manifestly discover, that they mind
nothing less, then things above, a man may judge of their inwards, by the
foame, and filth that comes from them, they foame out the folly of their own
hearts, in cursing, swearing, railing, filthy speaking, and the like; to pass
by them, I appeal to such as seem to be better minded, whether their
thoughts, their care, their desire, their love, and longing, be not rather
spent on the things of this world, then on things above in heaven; certainly
if we be not partial to our selves, and blinded with our own carnal
self-love, we must needs confess it to be so, in the most of us; as it was
said to Peter, Mark. 14.17. Thou art of Galile for thy speech is like. So I may
justly say to many of us, thou art of the world, thy speech is like, thou
sauourest not the things of God, but the things of the world, thy speech
bewraieth thee, thou art able to speak much, and to the purpose of the things
of this world, but when thou come to speak of heaven and heavenly things,
thy tongue does faulter, and cleaues to the roof of thy mouth.

Again, we know that one that is in a strange Country, and minds homeward, he
will ever be enquiring, and that wishingly, after the way that leads to his
dwelling, now where is almost that man or woman that does thus wishingly
enquire after heaven? nay surely, the way being pointed out unto us, the most
of us have little, or no care to walk in it, and that is a plain evidence,
that our minds are not thitherward, our hearts and affections are not set on
heaven and heavenly things; happily thou have a good liking, and a little taste
of the powers of the world to come as it is Heb. 6.5. and therewith thou art
content, and do please thy self; deceive not thy self, that liking and
taste may be in one that never shall be saved; thou must have more then a
taste, even a true, and sound affection set on things above.





Motives to stir us up to this duty.
and to stir us up to this duty, consider we.

hearts of true believers in this life, he works sometimes so great comfort in
their hearts, as maks them undergo most exquisite torments, even with singing.

Again, consider the comfort of a good conscience in Solomon says, Prou.
15.15. It is a continual feast. Oh then the joy and comfort of the holy Ghost
dwelling in us in heaven, and the peace and comfort of a good conscience there,
where it shall be free from fear, must needs be infinite and unspeakable: let
then the consideration of the beginnings of heavenly comfort so sweet and
excellent, even in this life, raise up our hearts above al earthly things, and
stir us up to set our minds and affections on the things that are at the right
hand of God in heaven.

In the next place, in that the Apostle does exhort (to set our affections on
heavenly things.)

We plainly see, that religion does not take away and Religion does not take
away and abolish humane affections, but does only order them.
and bring them into subjection to the will of God; we are not taught by
religion to put out affections, but to labor to have them sanctified, and by
grace moved to a right object, with due measure and moderation, according to
the nature of the object: we are taught in many places of Scripture, to hate
evil and to love good, to rejoice with them that rejoice, to be sorry with the
afflicted, etc.

And there be two reasons why affections are not abolished, but only ordered.

The first is this, God himself planted them in the heart

Secondly, affections renewed contain in them a great by grace carry us forward
to a notable high degree of holiness.

Hence it is that they are compared to strings of musical instruments, which
being well tuned, and rightly moved make a sweet harmony: so affections
ordered by grace, and moved by the spirit, are the matter of many excellent
virtues, and therefore they are not to be rooted out, but we are to labor to
have them rightly ordered.

We must spy out the motions and inclinations of our hearts, and labor to
have them sanctified and ^ightly ordered.
and moved by grace, as that our anger and hatred may be against sin, our
love may be to goodness, etc. And the rather let us strive, that the motions
of our hearts and wills may be thus sanctified, because being in their
natural condition, they carry us with a violent course to the highest pitch of
sin: and hence it is, that they are called motions of sins, Romans 7.5. and
they are the very fire and fuel of sin; to insist in one particular,
experience may teach, that the desire of man's heart not sanctified, is commonly
so set on the things of this world, as it cannot be satisfied, and if it be
suffered to run at large, it will carry a man headlong to the pit of
perdition, 1. Tim. 6 9.10. They that will be rich, etc. Now desire is not to be
rooted out, but to be ordered by grace, and turned another way, and set on
heaven, and heavenly things; and thus we are to deal with the motions of our
hearts, we are to labor to have them sanctified, and rightly ordered, and
know we that according to our affections, so shall we profit both by the
works and word of God: many see the wonderful works of God, Note.
and hear his word, with others, and yet profit not as others do, because the
Lord has not given them the like good affections; when therefore thou see
the judgments of God, on any place, or person, or hear his word, pray that
the Lord would fill thine heart with holy affections and the Lord so doing
without question: thou shall profit by the same.

Mark further that our Apostle to his exhortation (set your affections on
things which are above) adds a dehortation from seting our affections on
things which are on the earth.

Hence it is clear that we cannot mind and affect things We cannot mind and
affect things heavenly and things earthly both together.
it is not possible that our care, desire, love and liking should be sete on
things above and things on the earth both at one time, Phil. 3.19.20. the
Apostle makes a flat opposition between minding earthly things, and having our
conversation in heaven, as it becomes true believers: let no man then deceive
himself and say, They decciue themselves who think they may earnestly seek
after earthly things, and yet mind and affect things heavenly.
it is as possible to look upward, and downward both at once, yea, know we
that it is a dangerous thing by hot and earnest pursuit to seek after earthly
things, though it be by good and lawful means, that greedy hunting after
them, will make us settle on our dregs, so as in time we shall look for no
other happiness but in them. Indeed we may use the world, and the things of the
world, but it must be according to the rule of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7.31. as
though we used them not, and so as they may help us forward in our travel
toward heaven, and so as our hearts be not ensnared with any thing in the
world; yea we may use the things of this world sometimes for delight, yet in our
lawful delitght in them, Note
our chief joy must be at the right hand of God in Heaven. And now to speak
something that may tend to withdraw our hearts from the world and the things of
the world, to which they are even wedded, and will hardly hear of any divorce,
yet to this purpose consider, A motive to withdraw our hearts from the world
and the things of it.
we only the condition of the things of this life, that they are things
transitory, and of small continuance, this being well considered is of weight
and able to dissuade any one that is endued but with common sense, from wedding
his mind to the^, for who is it, but he that has his eyes shut up, and cannot
see things that differ, knowing that he has but a short time to enjoy the
things of this life, and the things themselves vanishing and flitting away as a
shadow, that will make account of them as his own, and promise himself any
long time in them, it was the foolish conceit of the rich man, Luke 12, 19.
Soul thou have much goods laid up for many years, live at ease, eat, drink,
and take thy pastime, he thought he had a perpetuity in his goods, but what
was the answer of God to him, thou fool, etc. and indeed what greater folly?
what more wilful madness can there be then this? for a man to give his heart
over to such things, as are shut up in a vapor a shadow, a puff of wind, a
bubble, or (such is man's life) which when they continue the longest, are but as
a spanne long, cut off by death, short and momentary; Oh then let not our
souls (which we hope shall live with the Lord, for ever) be so abased, as to
be set on vanishing, and transitory things, but let them be raised up to
meditate, mind and affect the things that last for ever, even the things found
in Jesus Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his father in heaven.

VER. 3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
The first words of this verse, contain an argument to confirm the Apostles
dehortation, in the last words of the second verse, (namely) from minding and
affecting things on the earth, and the argument is from the condition of the
Colossians believing in Christ (that they were dead) and it may thus be
framed, dead men have no mind, nor further care for the things of this life,
but ye are dead, therefore you ought not to mind them.

Now to this argument, happily the Colossians might take exception, they might
reply and say, are we dead? why then we are not to mind and affect things
above, dead men mind nothing, the Apostle therefore preuents this objection,
in the next words by further explication of his speech, letting them understand
that howsoever they were dead, yet not simply dead, but so as they had life,
and he sets down what manner of life they had (namely a life hid, yet are
dead, and your life is hid) yet hereupon peradventure the corrupt nature of
man might further infer, and say, is our life hid does it not appear, why
then should we seek and affect things that pertain to that life that appears
not, and omit the things of this life? this also the Apostle does meet withal,
and to this he answers in the words following, setting before them how this
life was hid (namely with Christ.)

Secondly in whom it was hid even in God.

And thirdly, the time when it should be fully revealed, with Christ in God.)

Let us now search out the meaning of the words of this verse (for ye are
dead) that is with Christ, as we have it in the chapter before, verse the
twentieth, you being one with Christ by faith are dead with him, that is,
Interpretation.
as partakers of the power of his death, and are as dead men in regard of
sin, and of worldly happiness standing in worldly pleasures, profits and
honors, and such like, and your life) that is, your happy life begun in this
world, to be made perfect in the life to come, that perfection of holiness,
and glory, that once ye shall have both in your bodies and souls; and that I
gather to be the meaning of this word (life) from the Apostles own words, in
the verse following, where he says, that when Christ which is your life shall
appear, then shall ye also appear ^ith him in glory. Even in perfection of
glory, and so he does expound this word (life) now hid, to be that glory that
shall be revealed at the coming of Christ, and that is fullness of happiness
and glory, wherewith the bodies and souls of true believers shall then be
invested (is hid) that is not only kept from the eyes of the world, who have
no sight of it at all, but in great measure from the eye of true believers
themselves, who are therefore said to walk by faith, and not by sight, 2. Cor.
5.7. (with Christ) that is above in heaven, where Christ is, and is hid as
Christ is now hid, who is hid from the eyes of all that live on the earth, he
sitting in fullness of glory at the right hand of his father, (in God) that is,
in the hand of God, in his grace, mercy and power, for as it is said, Acts.
17.28 that in God we live, move, and have our being, our life, our moving,
and being in this world is in him, that is in his hand and power, so the life
and glory that shall be bestowed on true believers being (as the Apostle says)
hid in God, the meaning is, that it is laid up in his gracious and powerful
hand: thus then we are to conceive the meaning of the words of this verse as
if the Apostle had said.

For ye believing in Christ, are partakers of the power of his death, and are
as dead men in regard of sin, and of worldly happiness and your happy life,
your perfection of holiness, and glory, that once you shall have both in your
bodies and souls, is altogether hid from the eyes of the world and in great
measure from your selves, even as Christ now sitting at the right hand of his
father, is hid from the eyes of men on the earth, and is laid up in the
gracious and powerful hand of God.

Now here first we are to observe, that as from having part with Christ in his
resurrection, our Apostle in the first ver. persuaded to seek and affect
things above, so now from their fellowship with Christ in his death, he
disswades from minding and affecting earthly things, he reasons thus, you being
partakers with Christ in his death, are as dead men in regard of sin, and
worldy happiness, therefore do not you mind and affect earthly things.

Hence we may take up this conclusion, that fellowship Fellowship with Christ
in his death is able to make us as dead men in regard of love and affection to
the things of this life.
the having of part with Christ in the power of his death, is able to make us
as dead men in regard of our love and affection to the things of this life, it
will make our hearts as dead within us, in regard of any affection to earthly
things, though we use them, and may lawfully use them, yea if it be abundance
of outward things that God has given us, yet if we have part with Christ in
the power of his death, that will make us that we shall not set our hearts
upon them, but in the preparation of our hearts, we shall be ready to forgo all
things we enjoy for Christ, and for the profession of the Gospel, if we
cannot hold them together, for as the Apostle says, Gal. 2.19. they that are
Christ's are crucified with Christ, and being crucified with him they have
crucified the flesh with the lusts thereof and as it is Gal. 5.24. their
affections are crucified, and dead in respect of sins, pleasures and the
profits of this life, even whatsoever is opposed to the kingdom of Christ, and
to a new creature. Let this serve as a ground of trial to every man, we
persuade our selves that Christ died for us, If we feel not the power of
Christ his death making us as dead in regard of love and affection to earthly
things, we can have no comfort in his death.
hereby we may try it, if we find Christ his death powerful in us, to the
mortification of our own wicked wills and carnal affections, that we are as
dead men, in regard of love and and affection to earthly things, then indeed
we have fellowship, and part with Christ in his death to our comfort, but if
our hearts and minds be as quick and ready, as lively as ever they were to
meditate and think of, to love and desire earthly things, and as strongly
carried after, and set on those things; whatsoever we say or pretend, it skils
not, the truth is, we are neither partakers of the death of Christ, nor have
any lively hope of a better life.

Oh that wicked worldlings whose hearts are glued to the world, and to the
things of this world, would but duly consider this, that the setting of their
hearts on the honors, pleasures, profits and preferments of this life is a
plain testimony that they have no part in the death of Christ; indeed it is
not possible to be altogether void of all affection to the things of this life,
so long as we are in the body, such is our corruption, and the things
themselves are needful for the maintenance and wellbeing of the body in this
world, yet take this with you, if we be dead with Christ, if we have part
with him in the power of his death, certainly our hearts will every day more
and more be weaned, and withdrawn from the love, and liking of the things of
this earth, and more and more be set on things heavenly, and therefore it is a
dangerous case, when men and women grow old, and in respect of their bodies are
decrepit, decayed and half dead, and have one foot as it were in the grave, if
then their hearts be more wedded to the world, and set on earthly things, and
if then they be more greedy of the things of this life, without question, that
is a dangerous case, it is a sign that they never had part in the power of
Christ his death, for that would make their affections together with their
body, by little and little, to die to the things of this world, and let us
know, that if we have no part in the power of Christ his death, we can have no
comfort in the merit of it, Gal. 6.14, God forbid (says the Apostle) that I
should rejoice, but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and mark what
follows, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world: where
he shows plainly in the general, that none can truly glory in the cross of
Christ, but only they who by the power of it are dead to the world, and the
world to them, as for others that feel not that power, they can no more glory
in the cross of Christ, then a man may glory of the victory his Prince has
gotten over enemies, himself in the mean time being a vassal, and slave
unto them, let this be thought on by as many as find their hearts wholly or
chiefly set on earthly things, and let it stir us up never to rest till we
find, and feel Christ his death powerful in us, to weane us from the love of
the things of this life, yea, though we have abundance of them, and hold, and
enjoy them, yet let not our hearts be set on them, the Papists say it is a
state of perfection to have nothing to do with the things of this life, now
that is but a fancy, it is rather a state of perfection, Note.
or coming near to perfection (for we are not to dream of any absolute
perfection in this life) in the midst of the abundance of the things of this
life, not to have our hearts set upon them.

The next thing we are to consider in this verse is in these words, (your life
is hid.)

Hence we are given to understand thus much, that the happiness, and glory,
The happiness and glory of true believers prepared for the^ in the life to come
is altogether hid from the eye of the world.
the comfort and joy unspeakable Peter calls it, 1. Pet. 1.8. of true believers
begun in this life, and to be made perfect in the life to come, is a thing
altogether hid from the eye of the world, the world has no manner of sight nor
apprehension, nor understanding of it, no not so much as a glimps of the world
sees the outside of a true believer, his face, his countenance, his outward
gesture and behavior, and his visible state and condition in the world, but
they neither see nor conceive the beauty, and glory that is within, as it is
said of the Church: Psalm. 45.13. She is all glorious within, and that glory the
world sees not, and as Eliphas says, Job. 22.20. our substance is hid, men of
the world may see the color and outward skin of true believers, but they
cannot diue into the substance of their happiness, and comfort begun in this
life, to be made perfect in the life to com.

One reason of this is given by Saint John. 1.3.1. namely this, because the
world knows not God, behold (says he) what love the father has showed on us
that we should be called the sons of God, for this cause the world knows
you not, because it knows not him) it knows not God to be a grations father
to his children, nor Gods dealing with his children, and therefore it knows
not their adoption, their happiness, and the inheritance he has provided for
them, and the comfort he has begun in their heart, in this life, and will
perfect in the life to come.

Again, true inward comfort in the heart, is a thing strange and unknown to
men of the world, they are not acquainted with it, they never felt it in
themselves, and therefore it is not possible, they should discern or take
knowledge of it in others.

Whence it is that profane persons do hold the true service of God which true
believers yield unto him a most unprofitable thing.
yea the greatest drudgery in the world, and the life of a true Christian, the
most heavy dumpish and most uncomfortable life that possible can be, here is
the reason of it, they have not eyes to see the comfort of that life, it is hid
from them, and they judge other men by themselves, they think no prison so
irksome as the Church, no toil more painful then prayer, hearing the word,
receiving the Sacraments, they hold no bondage so grievous, as restraint from
sinful and ungodly courses, yea, as the Apostle Peter says. 1.4.4. it seems
strange to them, that true Comfort and encouragement of true believers against
the scorn and contempt that is cast upon them by the wicked world.
as sound and sincere profession of the Gospel, because (indeed) they have no
apprehension of the comfort of that life.

Again, for further use of this point, let the consideration of it arm all
true believers against scorn and contempt cast upon them, by the wicked and
profane of the world, they are ever censuring true believers, deriuing their
profession, and insulting over their mean and miserable condition (and as they
think of it) and stick not to say What difference (I pray you) is between
them and us, but only this; we see they thrive not so well in the world, they
are many ways crossed, yea, sometimes they say, they can speak by experience,
themselves have been professors as forward as others, and yet yet never got
good by it, as the Prophet brings in the wicked of his time quarrelling and
saying, Mal. 3.14. It is in vain to serve God. Alas poor souls, let them
alone, let not this discourage any one that truly fears God, let us consider
that they have no understanding of the happiness and comfort of true
believers; a sinner ^^nnot disc^rne the happiness of a true Christian, nor
conceive how God deals with him, he is a mere stranger to his joy and
comfort, the Manna he feeds on is hidden, Revel. 2.17. Therefore let not the
murmuring, or the scorn of wicked and profane persons, prevail in the ears,
or hearts or of any that have understanding.

One thing more note we from hence, namely this.

That perfection of happiness and holiness, is in great measure hid from true
believers themselves, Perfection of happiness and holiness is in great part
hid from true believers themselves.
though they have the beginnings of it, yet the fullness of it does not appear
to them, 1 Ioh. 3.2. Saint John says plainly, That now we are the sons of
God, but yet it does not appear what we shall be. And Romans 8.23.24. We which
have the first fruits of the spirit, even we do sigh in our selves, wa^ing for
the adoption, even the redemption of our body.

We ought therefore with patience to wait for the accomplishment of our
happiness and holiness, We are patiently to wait for the accomplishment of
our happiness and holiness.
unless we have present preferment in this world, our principal pay will be in
the life to come, we have part in hand by grace in our souls, in this life,
and the rest is behind till the pay day in the world to come; yea, let all
Gods children herein comfort themselves, they groan under the burden of their
sins, and feel the want of holiness, let them know that in this life, Note
they shall never feel holiness, as they feel sin; it is an excellent
place to this purpose, the Apostle there says, Gal. 5.5. That through the
spirit we wait for the hope of righteousness through faith: that is, for full
revelation of righteousness imputed, and for the accomplishment of the effect
of it (namely) sanctification, we are to wait for it through faith; if we
have the first fruits of the spirit (namely) an hatred of our own sin, a
purpose of not sinning, and the true fear of God in our hearts; let us comfort
our selves in that, and wait for fullness of grace and holiness in the life
to come, as yet perfection of holiness is hid from us, in time it shall be
revealed, and we shall come unto it.

Come we to the manner, how the life of true believers is hid, expressed by
the Apostle in these words (with Christ) that is no otherwise then Christ is
now hid, who sits at the right hand of his father, and is hid from the bodily
eyes of all that live on the earth: to omit that which hence may be gathered,
that our happiness shall not be hid for ever, but in time be revealed, because
it is hid as Christ is now hid, who in time shall show himself from heaven
in glory of that we shall more fitly speak in the next verse.

Observe we from these words only thus much.

Christ now in heaven is hid from the bodily eyes of all that live on the face
of the earth.
the Saints in heaven in their souls now see Christ as he is in fullness of
glory, and in their souls they have immediate fellowship with him, according
to that wish of the Apostle, Phil. 1.23. and after the general resurrection,
they shall see him with their bodily eyes likewise, but he is yet hid from us
now living in this world, we see him not with our bodily eyes, for as the
Apostle says, 2. Cor. 5.6. While we are at home in the body, we are absent
from the Lord. He is absent from us in his body, and we are absent from him,
and we see him not, he is ascended into heaven, and as Peter says Act. 3.21.
Heaven must contain him until the time that all things be restored.

Christ has been seen of some whiles they lived here in this world, as of
Stephen, Act. 7.55. and of Paul in his journey. Act. 9.

Let this be granted, that Christ was seen of some, Stephen looked steadfastly
into heaven, and that Christ also spoke to Paul from heaven, from whence the
glorious light shined and yet a learned Papist in a book lately published
takes on him by warrant of that apparision of Christ to Paul Acts 9. to prove
that Christ his body (de facto) that is, actually, has been in two places at
once, but he can never from thence euince it, either by plain evidence, or
good consequent; doubtless that apparision was from heaven, Christ still being
in heaven, and it was extraordinary, and we are to hold it for a truth, that
Christ is now in heaven hid from the eyes of all that live on the earth: and
let us make this use of it.

Seeing it is so, that Christ is hid from our bodily eye, Pet. 1. Epist. 1.8.
says, We must labor to see Christ now hid from our bodily eyes with a
spiritual eye of faith.
Labor that we may believe in him though we see him not. Now because every
one will think with himself, surely this lesson is soon learned, though I
see not Christ with my bodily eye, yet I do eye, and look on him by faith,
and herein the Devil does delude many a poor soul, making it think it does
eye Christ by faith, when indeed it does not, that we be not therefore herein
deceived.

We must know that we are to eye Christ by faith, How we are to eye Christ by
faith.
as he is set before us to be looked on in the word and Sacraments, for so is
Christ the proper object of faith, we are to look on him by faith as as a
perfect mediator, God and man in one person, and so to eye the virtue and
sufficiency of his meritorious obedience both active and passive, even the
merit both of his fulfilling of the Law in his life, and of his suffering the
cursed death of the Cross, for this is Christ propounded, and set before us to
be looked on in the word and Sacraments, many an ignorant person thinks he
does eye Christ by faith, when he has only a general and confused notion
of Christ, he living in the bosomc of the Church cannot choose but hear of
Christ, but he has no understanding of the personal union of his Godhead and
manhood, and he is not able to distinguish between his active and passive
obedience, and he knows not whence it is, that Christ his obedience is of
infinite merit and sufficiency; well, thus are we to eye Christ by faith,
even as a perfect mediator, God, and man, in one person; and so the infinite
value and merit of his obedience, both active and pasiue; and if we do thus by
faith eye Christ, without question, that is unto us a ground of lively comfort,
we then see Christ, and in him unspeakable joy and comfort, that curse of the
Law, and condemnation removed, our sins washed away in his blood, and that
we in him have right and title to all the comforts of the Saints of God in
this life and for ever, and if we do not thus see Christ to our comfort,
certainly we shall one day see him to our everlasting confusion.

Come we now to the last words of this verse, wherein the Apostle does
express, in whom the happy life of true believers is hid (namely) (in God) and
before I come to that I chiefelie intend to stand on in handling of these words
I hold it not amiss, upon occasion of these words, to discover A popish shift
discovered.
a shift that the Papists have devised to uphold their intercession of Saints,
and their prayers to Saints departed; they being pressed by us after this
manner, that to pray to them, is to ascribe unto them, that which is proper to
God alone, even to know the hearts and inward desires of men.

They answer, that Saints in heaven do clearly behold God, and see him face to
face, now (say they) God contains all things in himself, yea the inward
comfort that is in the hearts of true believers in this life; and therefore,
though Saints departed do not see the secrets of our hearts, as they are in our
hearts, yet being present to the face of God, they do behold in it all things,
as it were in a most clear glass, this is their shift which indeed is a mere
forgerie, and a vain devise of an idle brain, without all warrant of the word
of God, we find it not in any place of Scripture, that the Saints in heaven,
beholding God face to face, do in him, as in a glass see the comfort that is
in the hearts of true believers, which the Apostle here says is in hid God,
and other things said, or done on the earth, that conceit is contrary to the
Scripture which teaches that God alone searches the hearts, and secret
thoughts of men, and we find that the Angels who he hold the face of God in
heaven, are notwithstanding ignorant of many things, as of the wisdom of God,
in calling and saving the Gentiles, Ephesians. 3.10. and of the day of Judgment,
and they know not the thoughts of men's hearts, unless it please God by
special dispensation to reveal them unto them, the Lord using their ministry
for the good of his chosen, much less do Saints departed know them, whom the
Lord never uses as ministering Spirits, as he does the good Angels, and if
Saints departed did, or might, know things done or said here on the earth, as
well as God, yet it follows not, that therefore we should pray to them, having
neither commandment, nor promise, nor example in Scripture, to warrant such
kind of prayer; we see then that this is but a mere shift of the Papists to
blind the world withal, that the Saints in heaven behold the face of God, and
in him see all things, and that therefore we may pray to them.

Now in that the Apostle says, that the life of true believers is hid in God,
we are given to understand thus much.

That the happiness and comfort of true believers, begun in this life to be
made perfect in the life to come, The happiness and comfort of true believers is
laid up in the grace, mercy, and power of God.
and laid up in the gracious and powerful hand of God; it is hid in his
grace, mercy, and power, for indeed it rests in the gracious promise of God,
by his free promise they have right unto it, and hold it, and as the Apostle
Peter says, 1. Epist. 1.5. They are kept by the power of God through faith
unto salvation. Their eternal happiness is kept for them, and they kept for
it, and both of them by the power of God. And hence it is that God is said to
be the God of consolation, Romans 15.5. as indeed the fountain and storehouse
of all true comfort: and hence it is, that the Apostle says, 1. Tim. 6.16.
That he only has immortality, and dwells in the light that none can attain
unto. He only has immortal and eternal life of glory in himself by nature
and does give it to whom he will, and he will give it in time to all true
believers.

We are to seek and to look for life and true comfort in all our distresses
at the hand of God.
even at the hand of God who only has it in his keeping, it is neither men
nor Angels that of themselves can give it unto us, but only God* Whither will
a man that needs anything go, but where he knows supply is to be had? If he
need but water he will go to the Well or Conduit: so we in time of sickness
or any other distress, standing in need of comfort, are to go to God, in
whose hand is laid up the happiness, and comfort of all his children, and we
are by earnest supplication and prayer, to sue for it at his hand, and then
doubtless (if we be in the number of those, to whom his promise belongs) we
shall not fail to obtain it, through his promise, the Lord is become a
voluntary debtor unto us, and our comfort being laid up in his promise, and
we suing to him according to his promise, and resting our selves on his
promise, we cannot miss of it in time of need, and we are not to doubt of
it; for God is faithful who has made the promise, Heb. 10.23. If God can be
unfaithful, then doubt of comfort in time of need, but that is impossible that
God should be unfaithful, therefore make no question of it, but we shall
find it in time of need: and consider further with thy self, do thou
believe there is eternal happiness, and comfort in heaven, laid up for thee
in the hand of the Lord? and will thou then doubt whether there be comfort for
thee in his hand in time of this life, and in this world, or no? Oh let it be
far from thee, remember that God is faithful, as the Apostle says, 1 Cor.
10.13. and will not suffer thee to be tried above thy strength, but will either
enable thee to bear thy trial with comfort, or give thee deliverance out of
it as shall be best for his glory, and thy good.

Again, is it so that the happiness, and comfort of true The happiness and
comfort of true believers is in a sure hand being laid up in the glorious hand
of God.
Then let us know that it is kept most safe and sure; at the first God trusted
man with his own happiness, and he wittingly and willingly lost it, but now
it is kept in the hand of God, and therefore it is most safe, as the Apostle
says, 2. Tim. 1.12. He is able to keep that which is committed unto him,
etc. Yea, the happiness, and true comfort of true believers is so safely kept
in the hand of God, that neither the fraud nor force of the world, or the
Devil without, not the flesh within, can deprive them of it, though the devil
and his instruments, maliciously purpose by their vexations, to make Gods
children miserable, yet can they nor do it, they cannot come near their
happiness, it is not only hid from their eyes that they cannot see it, to hurt
it, but it is hid in God, whom they neither can, nor dare assault; yea that
which Gods children hold it by, is hid from them even the hope of true
believers, as an Ancre is cast within the veil of heaven, Heb. 6.19. If then
we have in us the beginnings of heavenly life and comfort, let us assure our
selves, we shall never be deprived of it, the fullness and perfection of that
comfort is laid up in the powerful hand of God, and nothing is able to wrest
or wring it out of his hand, indeed if it were committed to our trust, and left
in our hands, to hold or to loose, we had just cause (as the Papists teach) to
doubt of the holding of it, but we must remember, it is laid up in the
gracious hand of God, even in the promise of God, who cannot lie, and it is
built one the eternal love of God from which nothing can divide us, Romans 8.39.
and upon the unchangeable decree of God, that stands fast for evermore, and
therefore the assurance of eternal happiness wrought in the hearts of true
believers, is built on a rock which never shall be shaken.

VER. 4. When Christ which is our life shall appear, then shall ye also
appear with him in glory.
In this Verse our Apostle makes known to the Colossians believing in Christ,
the time when their happy life, now hid in God, shall be fully revealed
(namely) At the appearance of the Lord Jesus when Christ shall appear; then
says the Apostle, Shall ye also appear with him in glory. Then shall your
happy life appear, and so he does prevent a secret demand the Colossians
might have made; for they might have said, you tell us our happy life is hid
with Christ in God, but when shall we have that life, and when shall it be
manifested, our Apostle answers, when Christ shall appear, then it shall be
manifested. Now this is not barely expounded, that at the appearance of Christ,
their happy life shall appear, but it is further amplified.

1 First, by a description of Christ.

That he is the life of true believers, When Christ which is our life shall
appear.

2 And then by a description of their state and condition, in respect of that
happiness and glory, that then shall be given them.

That they shall then be invested with it, and appear whith Christ most
glorious: Then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

We see then, the Apostle here makes known the When Christ shall appear.

And he describes Christ to be the life of true believers.

And he sets down the state of true believers, in respect

Come we now to the words of this verse, and first of these words (When Christ
which is our life shall appear. Interpretation.


(When) the original word here translated (When) has an indefinite
signification, it properly signifies, whenever, at what time soever, sooner,
or latter: (our life) the Apostle said before, ye are dead, and your life etc.
and it might seem he should have so continued his speech in the second person
(Ye) but here he changes his term and says (our life) meaning the life of
us Jews, and of you Gentiles, when Christ the life of all believers both Jews
and Gentiles (life) the word (life) is put by a Metonimy, by an usual manner
of speech in Scripture, for the Author and matter of spiritual and heavenly
life, for it is Christ that is the efficient cause of our spiritual life, and
in him it consists, and thus himself says, John 11.25. I am the
resurrrection, and the life. That is, I am the author both of this life, and
the life to come, I raise up the body from death to life, I quicken in this
life by the life of grace, and I give eternal life in the world to come.
(Shall appear) that is, shall show himself from heaven in his glory, as it
is, Math. 25.31. shall come the second time in glory to judge the world, and
thus does the Apostle plainly expound himself, 2. Tim. 4.8. where he says,
Henceforth is laid up for me the Crown of righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous judge shall give me at that day: that is at the day of judgment, and
then he adds further, and not unto me only, but unto all them also that love
his appearing: where we see he makes Christ his coming to judgment and his
appearing all one, thus then we are to understand these words, as if the
Apostle had said:

Whenever Christ who is the author, and matter of the spiritual life of all
true believers, both of Jews and Gentiles, shall show himself from heaven in
his glory to judge the world, thcn shall ye also appear with him in glory.

First observe we here that the Apostle speaking of the appearance of Christ
to judgment, he speaks indefinitly he does not define the time, he sets not
down any certain day, month, year, or age, when Christ shall appear to
judgment, but he says whenever Christ shall appear.

Hence we are plainly taught thus much.

The time of Christ's coming to judgment is to us uncertain.
no man can set down the certane time of his appearance, no man knows
certanly when it shall be, and for this we have Christ his own warrant.
Matthew. 24.36. Of that day and hour knows no man. Yea, he adds further, Mark
13.32. Of that day and hour knows no man^ no, not the Angels which are in
heaven, neither the Son himself, save the Father. Which may be understood,
either as Christ is man, or as he was then in the state of humiliation in the
form of a servant, howsoever we understand it, hence it is clear, that the
day and time of Christ his appearance to judgment is uncertain, both to men
and

First therefore, we are not curiously to search into the time of Christ his
coming to judgment, We are not curiously to search into the time of Christ
his coming to judgment.
howsoever by the foregoing signs of it being fulfilled, and come to pass,
we may know it not to be far off: yet we are not to take on us to know the
certain day, and hour, no, not the month, year, or age when Christ will
come to judgment, that is not revealed in the Scripture, and it is curiosity
to search into it.

Again it is so that the sign of Christ his coming to We are to live in
continual expectance of Christ his coming to judgment. Note.
and to follow the counsel of Christ, Luke 2^.34. Even to take heed to
ourselves, lest that day come upon us at unawares. Where by the way observe,
that the day of judgment is like to surprise and come unawares on them, that
are given over to sensual pleasures, or drowned in the cares of this life, but
in regard of the uncertain time of Christ his coming to judgment, it
concerns us every day to look for it, and to make account of every present
day, as of the day of his coming. For as one says well, the last day is
therefore unknown, that we might be ready every day, and howsoever we
cannot exactly make account of Christ his coming to the general judgment,
yet we may well reckon on the Lord commings unto us by death, and of the day
of our particular judgment, we may well reckon of that not to be far of, we
see the youngest and strongest come as soon to the grave as the weakest, and
most aged, and let us know that as death leaves us, so shall judgment find
us. Saul, Note.
Judas, and Kain, died long since desperately, and the Lord at his coming,
shall find them in the same state; and so it will be with thee, in what state
soever thou die, so shall the Lord find thee at his coming to Judgment,
therefore make ready for death, make account of it every hour.

How is that will some say?

I answer, whatsoever thou do do it with such zeal and feruency, with such
fear, with such sincerity of inward affection, as if forthwith thou were to
yield up the Ghost, and presume not thou on length of days, do not thou
indent and make a covenant with death, as the Prophet says of the wicked,
Isai. 28.15. putting death far from thee, and so grow to a deadness and
senseless security in sin, Matthew. 24.39. Our Savior makes deadness of
heart one sign of the last judgment, and doubtless it is a sign of
particular judgment, iminent and hanging over thine head, when thou art
careless, and do put that far from thee, which may suddenly come upon thee,
Genesis 19.14. We read that when Lots friends fleered and laughed at Lot, and
thought with themselves Lot told them but some idle dream of his own head,
then was judgment hard at hand, and the Scripture does much run on this
point that the day of the Lord shall come even as a the^f^ in the night, 1.
These. 5.2.3. Therefore take thou heed o^ this deadness of heart, put not that
far from thee which may shortly fall upon thee, remember that the Lords
coming, either to general or particular judgment is to thee uncertain, thou
know not when it shall be: live then in continual expectation of it; wait
thou and be every day ready for the appearing of the Lord Jesus.

In the next place we are to observe that which the Apostle here adds by way
of description of Christ, he says not simply when Christ shall appear, but
when Christ our life shall appear: hence we are given to understand thus much:

Christ is the life of all that look for his appearance to their c^mfort.
he is the author, and matter, of their spiritual life. Now for the right
conceiving of this point, and the further settling of it in our vnderstanding^
(...) are to consider, how Christ is the author, and matter, of the spiritual
life of true believers; and to this purpose know that Christ is the author of
spiriuall life, as the root of it, having it himself, and conueying it to all
that believe in him; hence is he said to be the true vine, and they the
branches, John 15.1. Again, he is not only the author of spiritual life, as
is God the Father, and the holy Ghost, but he is the matter of it, and in him
it consists, because he only is the propitiation for sin, 1. John 2.2. He
only is the expiatory sacrifice for sin the cause of death, and in him is
perfect righteousness to life eternal, even to the Justification of life as
the Apostle speaks, Romans 5.18.

Now if it be asked how this spiritual life is conveyed from Christ to them
that believe.

I answer, John 6.53. Eat his flesh, and drink his blood, before we can have
life abiding in us; true believers being thus truly united to Christ, Christ
by his Spirit does communicate first himself to them, and then both the merit
of his death for remission of their sins, and of his active obedience for
their right to life and salvation, and withal the power of his Spirit to
quicken them to the life of grace in this world, and to raise up their bodies
to the life of glory in the day of judgment.

Thus then are we to conceive this point, true believers being truly and
nearly united to Christ, by the bond of his spirit, and by faith, Christ lives
in them as a root in the branches, and by his Spirit does communicate to them,
both himself and all his merits, for remission of their sins; and perfect
justification, and also the power of his spirit to quicken them to the life of
grace here, and to raise up their dead bodies to life everlasting, happiness,
and glory in the life to come. And this Saint John teaches plainly, 1 John
5.11.12. God (says he) has given to us eternal life and this life is in his
son: he that has the son has life, and he that has not the son of God has
not life: Where he shows plainly that in Christ is life eternal, and as
many as are one with him, have Christ himself, and having him they have that
life that is in him, Christ is the author, and matter of their spiritual life.

They deceive themselves who look that Christ shall appear to their comforts
and yet find him not their life.
then think on it and deceive not thy self, if thou find not Christ thy
life, never look that he shall appear to thy comfort, the Apostle says not,
when Christ shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory, but
when Christ our life shall appear, etc. and we are to consider it, and hence
to take knowledge of it, that they speak foolishly, who say, if I be appointed
to life and salvation, I shall come to it howsoever I live, that is a mere
delusion of Satan; as God has appointed the end, so has he appointed the
means and way to come to that end, Christ himself fled from Herod Math. 2.14.
and yet was he appointed of God to live his time, which neither Herod nor any
other could prevent, therefore they reason foolishly that so speak, and know
it for a truth that Christ must be thy life, Christ must be the matter of thy
spiritual life, and must live in thee, Gal. 2.20. or else never look thou for
life and glory by him.



Romans 7.22. and a mind and disposition like to Christ Phil. 2.5. cheerfully
to do the will of God, and as willingly to seek Gods glory, and the good of
our brethren, as to eat when we are hungry, and to drink when we are
thirsty, and he works a love to Christ for himself, and of the members of
Christ, even because they are his members: 1. John. 3.14. We know that we are
translated from death unto life, because we love the brethren. If these things
be in thee in some measure, then indeed Christ is thy life, and shall one day
appear to thy comfort; yea, Christ being thy life, that life can never be
abolished, Christ died once, and now lives forever. Therefore having Christ thy
life take this for thy comfort, thou can not but live eternally: but on the
contrary, if the things before spoken of be wanting in thee, then certainly
thou must look for no comfort by Christ at his coming, thou art in death, and
shall abide in death, and die eternally, and be damned in hell.

One thing more is offered unto us from these words, in that the Apostle says,
(When Christ which is our life shall appear:) We are taught.

That Christ in time shall certainly appear to judge the world in power and
great glory, Doctr. 3. Christ shall in time certainly appear to judge the
world in power and great glory.
he shall appear both God and ^an of infinite glory, attended with his mighty
Angels, 2 These. 1.7. His glory shall be such that the powers of heaven shall
be shaken, Math. 24.29. Yea, the heavens shall pass pass away with a noise,
and the elements shall melt with heat, etc. 2 Peter 3.10 Seeing therefore such
shall be the glorious appearance of Christ at his coming to judgment, what
manner of persons ought we to be in holy conversation and godliness.

This use the Apostle Peter makes of it, 2 Pet. 3.11. Wherein wicked men walk
after their own lusts, We are to stand in continual awe of Christ his glorious
coming to judgment.
and say, where is the promise of his coming etc. and make even a mock at the
day of judgment, and fear not the glorious appearance of Christ, and herein
they are worse then the Devil, who trembles at the remembrance of that day:
well one day they shall tremble and quake, and be overwhelmed with horror, and
when Christ shall appear in glory not be able to endure the fire of his
wrath, let as many as love the Lord Jesus shake off security, and stand in
continual awe of his glorious coming, let our hearts be now smitten with a
reverent fear of it, and let us prepare to meet the Lord at his coming, that
we may be able to stand before him with joy, and there lift up our head
because our redemption shall be at hand.

Come we now to the description of the state of true believers in respect of
that happiness and glory which they shall have at the appearance of Christ in
these words (then shall ye also appear with him in glory) where the Apostle
does show that true believers shall then be possessed of that glory, and shall
appear with Christ most glorious, (then) this word has relation to the words
immediately going before (ye) that is, Interpretation.
ye believers who have Christ your life, and we are to understand that word as
spoken of the persons of true believers, not of their souls alone separate
from their bodies, nor of their bodies alone, then shall ye in your bodies and
souls (appear) that is, be manifestly seen of men and Angels (with him)
namely with Christ (in glory) that is, most glorious invested with eternal and
unspeakable glory, thus then conceive we these word, as if the Apostle had
said.

Then at the appearance of Christ, shall ye be manifestly seen with Christ,
invested in your bodies and souls with eternal and unspeakable glory.

Now first in that the Apostle says, that at the appearance of Christ, true
believers shall appear with him in glory, we may easily conclude.

Doct. 4. The happiness and glory of true believers shall one day appear and
and be seen of men and Angels.
That the happiness and glory of true believers shall not always be hid, but
it shall one day appear even to the whole world, yea both men and Angels shall
one day, namely, at the day of judgment, see the happiness and glory of true
believers, and be eyewitnesses of the same, for why? the Lord Jesus at that
day shall show himself to the sight of men and Angels, in endless Majesty and
glory in his own person, and he shall at that day come to be glorified in his
Saints, and to be made marvelous in all them that believe, so speaks the
Apostle in plain terms, 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. at his coming he shall not only be
infinitely glorious in his own person, but he shall also be glorified in his
Saints, he glorifying them, and they appearing with him in glory, therein they
shall show forth his grace, his power and his goodness, and that to the
astonishment and admiration of all that shall look upon them, even to the
amazement of men and Angels, Romans 8.19. the Apostle in saying, that the
creature, that is, the whole frame of the world, waits when the sons of God
shall be revealed: teaches also this point, that there shall be a time of
revelation, there shall come a day, when the glory of Gods children shall be
revealed to all the world, the reason of this is plain, namely this.

Because there must be a time, Comfort to true believers that their beauty and
glory shall one day be made manifest to the view of the whole world.
and be forced to confess and say, Oh we fools, thought their life folly and
madness, but now we see they are dear in the sight of the Lord, and have
their portion among his Saints.

Now then let this be laid up in the hearts of all true believers, as a ground
of great comfort to them, let them consider, that howsoever their beauty and
glory is in this world obscured and ouershadowed, and it is not seen of the
world, it lies hid from the world, either under affliction, or under that
excellent grace of humility, which the world accounts baseness they walking
humbly before the Lord, that humility of theirs is as a cloud to hide away
their glory from the eye of the world, yet let them be patient for a time, and
let them consider that it shall not always be hid, but the time shall come,
when it shall evidently appear, and be open to the view of the whole world,
yea, the time shall come that men and Angels shall see it with admiration, yea
which is most sweet and comfortable to be thought on, even they that here
have turned their glory into shame, as David says: Psalm. 4.2. that is, have
reproached them for their holy and religious carriage, and cast that in their
teeth as a reproach, and loaded them with odious and foul names even in
respect of that, the day shall come when they shall see that which now they
account their shame crowned with glory, and shall be forced to chang their note
and sing, a new song, yea, confessing their own folly shall cry out, and say,
we fools thought their life base and full of dishonor, and now behold their
unspeakable brightness and glory, let this be remembered as a matter of sweet
comfort to all Gods children, yea, let this encourage them even to be more
vile, as David said, 2. Sam. 6.22. when Mich^l mocked him for dancing before
the arc, I will yet be more vile then thus, so let all Gods children be more
vile, that is, more low in their own eyes, and walk more humby before the
Lord, and so be more base (as the world esteems of them) and the time shall
come, when they shall be had in honor of those that now contemn them, yea,
those that now despise them (if they repent not of that sin) at the coming
of the Lord Jesus, shall see them in glory, and shall be forced to acknowledge
their glory to their own everlasting shame and confusion.

We are in the next place to observe, that the Apostle says not, then shall
your souls, or then shall your bodies appear with him in glory, but then
shall ye, even ye, in your bodies and souls appear with Christ in glory,
hence we are taught:

That there shall not be a perfect consummation of the The glory of true
believers shall not have full accomplishment till the second coming of Christ.
then shall they in their bodies and souls appear with Christ in glory,
though the Saints of God now in heaven be blessed, Reu. 14.13. yet they look
for the perfection of their glory, when their bodies shall be glorified
together, with their souls at the general judgment: much is given to true
believers when they are dissolved, and go to Christ, but most of all shall be
given them when they shall be restored, and Christ come to them as Saint John
says, 1.3.2. when he shall appear they shall be like him: not only in their
souls, but in their bodies also, the text is plain, Phil. 3.21. he shall
change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body: and
then their bodies and souls joined together, and glorified together must
needs even in reason make a full weight and measure of glory: Reu. 6.^0. we
read that the fowls under the altar: cry how long Lord: as indeed expecting,
and earnestly desiring the last judgment, when Christ shall glorify himfelfe
in executing vengeance on the enemies of his Church, and give all his members
glory, both in their bodies and souls, and therefore the Saints in heaven are
in expectation of greater glory.

If any object Enoch and Eliah, that they in their bodies are already in
heaven, and therefore have a perfect consummation of their glory, and look
not for any greater measure of glory.

I answer, are hid from us, as he hid the body of Moses that the Devil looking
for it could not find it, but to leave that to be discussed by better
judgment, admit it to be true, that Enoch and Elias are now glorified in
heaven in their bodies, yet we must know that these examples are extraordinary,
the Lord took them up into heaven, that they might be types and figures of
Christ his ascension, and to nourish hope of life eternal in the Church, both
before the Law, and under the Law, and therefore they make not against this,
that the Saints in heaven, are yet in hope and expectation of full fruition of
the promised glory, and this Confutation of the opinion of the Papists touching
the blessedness of the Saints in Heaven.
yea, they affirm that they are as highly exalted in heaven as the Angels,
grounding on that saying of Christ, Mat. 22.30. whereas indeed if we look
upon that place, and consider it well, we shall find it rather makes against
them, for it is said, That the Saints shall be as the Angels of God in heaven,
but when; in the resurrection, at the general resurrection, and not before;
and again it is not said, that after the resurrection they shall be in every
respect like to the Angels, for then they shall be without bodies as the
Angels be, but they shall be as the Angels, in that then they have no need nor
use of marriage, that is the meaning of our Savior in that place, and so it
makes nothing for the purpose of our adversaries, to prove that the Saints now
in heaven are as highly exalted in honor as the Angels, and we are not to
suffer our selves by this to be driven from the truth, that the Saints in
heaven though they be blessed, yet have not obtained perfect consummation of
glory, but do expect it to be given at the day of judgment, yea, the first
member of Christ that died many hundred years ago, shall receive fullness of
glory in body and soul, till the last member be ready.

Lord Jesus would hasten his coming to Judgment, We may lawfully pray that
the second coming of Christ may be hastened.
and make perfect the glory of his Saints in heaven, and earth; mistake not my
meaning, I say not, that we may pray for the dead, but we may pray that the
Lord would make an end of the days of sin, that he would hasten the coming
of Christ, that he would give us deliverance from all the miseries of this
life: Romans 8.23. and in his good time (his kingdom of grace being finished)
give fullness of glory to all his Saints both in their bodies and souls.

Observe we further that the Apostle says not, (then shall ye appear in
glory) (but then shall ye appear with him (namely) with Christ in glory)
Hereby we are given to understand thus much.

That as Christ, and his members cannot be divided Christ his glory and the
glory of his members go together.
and the glory of his members cannot be disioined, nor put asunder when Christ
shall appear in his glory, then shall also all true believers be seen with
him shining in unspeakable glory, with the full manifestation of the glory of
Christ, shall go a full manifestation of the glory of all his members. The
reason of this is given in the place aforesaid, 2 Thessal. 1.10.

Because the glorification of the Saints,

Now then, what an excellent comfort is this to as many Comfort to all that have
part in Christ they shall certainly appear most glorious at the day of
judgment.
no sooner shall Christ appear in his but they also shall appear with him
most glorious, and indeed it cannot be otherwise, it is his will it should be
so, John 17.24. that all his members should be with him where he is, and be
pertakers of his glory: can the head Christ Jesus reign in endless glory, and
his members be covered with shame and dishonor? It is not possible, remember
it to thy comfort, if thou be a member of Christ, his glory, and thy glory
cannot be sundred, and know thou that it is as possible that Christ should not
be glorious, as that thou should not appear in glory at the day of
Judgment.



I must answer Cor. 4.17. A most excellent, and an eternal weight of glory.
Yet certainly it shall not be equal to the glory of Christ, but like it, the
text is plain: 1. John 3.2. When he shall appear we shall be like him. Phil.
3.21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his most
glorious body. The bodies of true believers shall shine in glory, like the
glorious body of Christ, and they shall be glorious in their measure according
to his image, who is the God of glory, they shall then be decked and trimmed,
as a Bride suitable, and fit for a most pure and glorious bridegroom, Revel.
19.8. even in the bright shining roabe of righteousness, and in most pure and
perfect holiness.

We are earnestly to long for Christ his coming to judgment.
that even now we might see him coming in the clouds; do we hear that no
sooner Christ shall appear, but we believing in Christ shall appear in glory
like to him, and do we believe this? (If we believe it not, why come we to
hear it) do we then believe this to be true, and shall we not long to see
the truth of it? Indeed if that great glory spoken of were uncertain, or
certain glory but small, it might be but small inducement to long after it; but
seeing it is as sure that we shall have glory as Christ himself the God of
glory, and that an unspeakable weight of glory, shall not this quicken and
stir up our spirits? Shall not this move us to long for the time when it
shall be revealed? Surely if we look for our part of that eternal weight of
glory, we cannot but as fervently desire after it, and cry out with the
Church, Revel. 22.20. Come quickly Lord Jesus. And if thou have not this
longing in thee, Note.
thine heart is not right in thee, and if thy desire be feeble, and weak,
seek to be quickened, labor thou to have a lively hope to be partaker of
that glory that shall be revealed, and then thine heart shall be filled with
abundance of comfort, and thou shall earnestly long for the appearance of the
Lord Jesus.

VER. 5. Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth, fornication
^ncleanenesse, the ininordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
covetousness which is Idolatry.
Our Apostle having finished his exhortation, to seek and affect things above,
and urged that on the Colossians, in the four first verses, in this fifth verse
he comes to his exhortation to Christian duties of the moral Law; and first
he exhorts to duties required in the commandments of the second Table, from
this verse to the end of the 15. and this exhortation stands on two parts.

The first is to the mortification, and pulling away of such

And the second part is, to the putting on, and taking

Now the Apostles exhortation to the mortification of sin, is again two fold.

The first is to the mortification of such sins as were

The second is to the putting away of such sins as

To come then to this Verse, where the Apostle begins his exhortation to the
mortification of such sins as were dear to the Colossians, that this verse
has reference, and respect to precedent matter, it is clear by the note of
inference (therefore) mortify therefore.

Now this inference is on this manner, the Apostle verse 4. laid before the
Colossians, that at the appearance of Christ to judgment, they believing in
Christ should certainly appear with him in glory. Hereupon even on this
promise of glory, he does infer this exhortation. Mortify therefore your
members, etc. As if he had said you have the promise of glory, and you
certainly look to be glorified with Christ at his appearance, therefore you
ought to labor, that (if it be possible) you may be found of him without
spot of sin, and to that end, you are to mortify the body of sin, and all
the members of it; that is the dependence of this verse with that which goes
before.

In this verse considered by it self, we have laid before us.

(Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth.)

Colossians, when the Apostle writ this Epistle, therefore he says, Mortify
your members, etc. And then comes to reckon them up; five in number.

(Namely) -- Fornication. Uncleanness. Inordinate affection Evil
Concupiscence. and Covetousness.


To which he adds by way of disswation, and to set out the ouglinesse of that
sin, that it is Idolatry.


Come we to the words as they are laid down by the Apostle, and first of the
general exhortation, Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth.

The word (Mortify) is Metaphorical, Interpretation.
it is borrowed from Chirurgions who when they must of necessity cut off some
part of a man's body (as in some diseases they must, then they use to lay
plasters to that part that is ill infected, and to be cut off, to mortify it,
that is, to make it dead without sense and feeling, that it may be cut off with
as little pain to the party as may be, from this manner of dealing is the word
here borrowed and taken, and the meaning of the Apostle in saying, (Mortify)
is this, do as Chirurgians do in some cases, use all good means to benu^me,
to take away life from our earthly members to kill them, and to make them no
more able to stir then members mortified; yea, no more then a dead karcasse,
for so does the original word signify. (Your members) that is, your sinful
motions, lusts, and affections, for the corruption of nature is compared to a
body, Chap. 2.11. and the motions, lusts, and affections, that arise from them,
are as members of that monstrous body, and therefore are called members by the
Apostle; and again, they are said to be as members, because being not
mortified they have force in all the members of the body to bring forth sin,
as the Apostle says, Romans 7.5. The motions of sin have force in our members
to bring forth fruit unto death. Yea, those motions and lusts that issue out
from natural corruption, being not mortified, they run through the whole
body, and soul, and do fill all the powers of the soul, and all the parts of
the body with sin, and therefore they are called members (which are one the
earth) that is earthly, which tend only to-earthly pleasures, and shall never
be admitted into the kingdom of heaven as it is, Revel. 21.27.

Thus then, understand we this exhortation, as if the Apostle had said, do you
as Chyrurgians use to do, when they are of necessity to cut off some member
of a man's body, use you all good means to benumme, yea, to kill, and to make
dead your sinful motions, lusts, and affections, which are as members of
that body of natural corruption that is in you, and being not mortified have
force in all the powers of our souls, and in all the members of our bodies to
bring forth sin, and tend only to earthly pleasures and profits, and shall
never be admitted into the kingdom of heaven.

Now here, first observe we the inference, and dependence of this verse on the
former, our Apostle having laid down the certain hope of glory with Christ,
that no sooner shall Christ appear, but all that believe in him shall appear
with him in glory; we are to mark that he presently subioines to this, the
duty of mortification, and says, (Mortify therefore your members, etc.)



That hope of glory and mortification of sin, must ever go together, Hope of
glory and mortification of sin must ever go together.
the one of these must ever follow upon the other, they must be undivided
companions, as many as have a certain hope of glory in heaven, they must
labor to quell, and kill the motions of sins in themselves.

For why? that conclusion of special faith, The premises on which the
conclusion of special faith is inferred.
I shall be saved, I certainly hope, and look for glory in heaven, is ever
inferred on two other propositions.



and forsake my sins, and I believe, and obey the Gospel unfeignedly, on
these two is ever that conclusion brought in. Therefore I shall be saved, I
do assuredly look for glory in heaven; therefore (doubtless) mortification
of sin, and hope of glory in heaven, must ever go together, they are not to
be sundred.

And let every one hereby examine himself, It is a vain deceiving hope of
glory in heaven that is severed from mortification of sin.
Saint John 1. epist. 3.3. delivers positiuelie, and does affirm it as a
general truth that every man that has his hope in him purges himself. He
says in the verse before, we know that when he shall appear we shall be
like him, and then he brings in this general proposition, Every man that has
this hope in him, purges himself, even as he is pure. That is, labors to
purge out all corruption of sin, that he may be in some measure pure as
Christ is pure.

Let no man then flatter, and deceive himself, with a vain hope of heavenly
glory, for indeed it is but a vain and deceiving hope that is severed from
mortification of sin, if thou undertake for the safety of thy soul, and
say, thou hopest to be saved, and yet allow thy self in the pursuit of
sinful pleasures and profits, even serving thine own lust with delight,
thou deceiuest thy self, thou have no true hope of a better life after this
life is ended; yea, I make no question of it, but I may justly appeal to
thine own conscience in this case, even that will tell thee, that thou
wallowing in sin, and pleasing thy self in a course of sin, thou have no
certain hope of comfort at the appearance of the Lord Jesus: thou that art a
profane person, an epicure, a drunkard, and an unclean person, or the like,
and have no care to mortify sin; doubtless thine own heart can tell thee,
that thou art so far from taking comfort in remembrance of Christ his coming
to judgment, and wishing for his appearance, that thou art afraid of it, thou
tremblest to think of it, thou think if Christ shoul now come to judgment,
he should come to trouble thee before the time, as the Devils speak, Math.
28.29. What have we to do with thee, art thou come to torment us before the
time. I appeal to thine own heart, whether this be not the very thought of
thine heart? with out question it is so in many; well let us remember it, that
hope of glory in heaven, and mortification of sin ever go together, and he
that has that hope in him purges himself, and so far as we have prevailed
in the mortification of sin, so far we may be assured of a better life, and
how far we have therein prevailed, may be easily known, because nothing is
therein done without great resistance of our corrupt and sinful nature.

Let us then hereby examine our selves touching our hope of glory in heaven.

True believers must labor by all good means to mortify sin in themselves.
that true believers labor by all good means to mortify sin, to benumme,
and to make sin dead in themselves.

Now for the better conceiving of this duty, I will first show, 1 What
mortification is. 2 Secondly, the means we are to use for the mortifying of
sin. 3 And th^rdly, the continuance of that duty.


What mortification of sin is.
whereby we do not only curb, and restrain the power and strength of our
natural corruption, and all the motions of it, but we abate, and weaken the
strength of them, and by little and little do kill and abolish the same. I
say, a work of grace, because it is not possible that nature should ever go
about to mortify sin; nature does neither see, nor feel corruption, but
only grace: again, I say, Note.
whereby we do not only restrain the power of our natural corruption, and
all the motions of it, for restraint of sin, may be in some part in civil
honest men, endued only with civil honesty, but we abate the strength of
sin, and by little and little, do kill and abolish it; and thus is
mortification set forth to us in many places of the Scripture, it is called a
mortifying of the old man, Romans 6.6. a crucifying of the flesh with the lusts
and affections thereof. Gal. 5.24.

If any ask how we shall know when the strength of natural corruption is more
then restrained,

I answer, Romans 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death.

Now the means whereby we may come thus to mortify sin in us are these.
Means that are to be used to mortify sin.


The first is, faith applying to our selves Christ crucified, Gal. 2.19. where
this faith is, there is the power of Christ his death, even that power that
sustained Christ on the Cross, to bear the guilt and punishment of our
sins, and that power is also effectual to abolish the corruption of sin in
all his members, and it is indeed the power of his spirit, Romans 8.13.

The second means is a serious application of the word Ephesians. 6.17.

The third means is a careful avoiding of all occasions Job says, Job 31.1.
He made a covenant with his eyes, etc.

Now lastly, The continuance of mortification of sin.
we must know that this duty does lie on us till death, because the corruption
of nature shall not be utterly vanquished, and abolished in any till death.

Thus then conceive we this duty, we are by faith applying to our selves Christ
crucified, and by serious application of the commandments and threatenings of
God to our several lusts and affections, and by careful auoidance of all
occasions and means that may stirrevp our corruption, and the sinful
motions and lusts of our hearts, to labor not only to bridle our natural
corruption and weakness, but to abate it, and this must be a continued action,
we are to do it so long as breath is in our bodies.

Many in the world discovered to be unmortified persons.
are there not many who shroud themselves under the covert of harmeles honesty?
they deal truly, they do no body harm, they abstain from all outrageous
behavior (which I speak not against) but yet if they look into themselves,
they shall find they cherish in their hearts naughty affections and damnable
lusts of anger or pride, self-love, self-conceit, covetousness, or the like,
and these they never labor to suppress and extinguish, no they nourish these
with liking, and think themselves in very good case, in respect of their
civil behavior; well let such persons know that they are unmortified, yea,
take this with thee whosoever thou art, that do bless thy self in thy
civil behavior, and think on it, thy civil carriage without mortification
of thy sinful lusts and affections is no better in Gods sight then a
glittering abomination, the like civil life was found in the very Heathen,
and it may be in one that never shall be saved, therefore think on it.

We are to practice the duty of mortification.
let us labor not only to bridle our corruption, that it break nor out, but
to kill and to crucify it, let us never rest till we find the first motions
of it, a burden to us, and that we groan under that burden desiring to be
delivered, yea, let such as have made some good proceeding in this duty still
go on, and more and more mortify the flesh with the lusts and affections of
it, for even the best have hidden and unknown corruptions in them, as David
said, Psalm. 19.12. and they must be found out and mortified, and because we
fail in this duty, the Lord himself sometimes takes the work in hand, Note
and he will crucify our corruption by his chastisements, yea (if we observe
it) we shall find, that the Lord sometimes will cross us even in good courses
for our secret corruption not mortified, as he overthrew the men of Israel,
twice going to battle in a just cause, and by the mouth of the Lord himself:
Judges 20. for their secret sin, because they were not so humbled as they
ought to have been, thus will the Lord deal with all that belong to him, let
us therefore, even as many as have begun to mortify sin, still go on in
that duty, labor we to find out our lusts, yea the hidden corruption of our
hearts, and by a true application of Christ crucified to thine own heart, by
laying to it the commandments and threatenings of the word, and by careful
auoidance of all occasions, and means that may stirrevp thy corruption, labor
to kill and crucify sin, and to this purpose remember the words of the
Apostle, Romans 8.13. If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye mortify
the deeds of the body by the spirit, ye shall live: if we please our selves in
any corruption of the flesh, be it but an inward lust, and live in it with
pleasure, we shall die, but if we mortify it, then we shall live,
mortification of sin, is an infallible sign that we have the spirit of life,
and that we live the life of grace in this world, and shall live the life of
glory hereafter.

We are further to observe how the Apostle here sets out the object of
mortification (namely) sin, and the sinful motions of the heart, he says
not in plain terms, mortify your sinful motions, lusts and affections, but
(mortify your members) he calls their sinful motions, lusts and affections,
their members, because indeed they are not only as members of that foul
body of our natural corruption, but because being not mortified, they have
force to bring forth sin in all the members of our bodies, and are to us as our
members. Hence we may raise two conclusions.

The first is this, that sinful motions, lusts and affections Sinful
lusts motions and affections not mortified, are as dear unto us as the members
of our bodies.
and are as dear and near to us as any of our members: hence it is that our
Savior bids us, Matthew. 5.29. pluck out your right eye etc. not meaning that
we should do violence to our own bodies, but that we should cut off, and cast
from us the dearest things we have, if they cause us to offend, and it may be
also understood of that corruption and concupiscence that has force in the eye
and hand, which is therefore called by the name of the eye and hand, because it
is as dear and tender unto us, as our eye or hand, Job. 20.12 13. Zophar sets
out this notably, he says, that wickedness is sweet in the mouth of the
wicked, he hides it under his tongue, he favors it, and will not forsake it,
but keeps it close in his mouth.



How we may know when our corrupt lusts and desires are mortified.
(namely) when they are not dear to us, we make not much of them, and they
are not to us as the members of our bodies, but as burdens, though they be in
us, and arise in our hearts, yet we like them not, but even hate and loath
them, for indeed they may be in us, yea, they may at some time be violent in
us, Note.
and ouercarrie us to sin, and yet be in a measure mortified, it was Peter's
case, Gal. 2.12. he was ouercarried with his fear to withdraw himself from
the Gentiles, yet was Peter a man regenerate and mortified, and that sin of
his was a sin of infirmity, for that indeed is a sin of infirmity, What a
sin of infirmity is.
when a man regenerate carrying in his heart a purpose not to sin, is
notwithstanding ouercarried by some great temptation, or violence of affection
to sin; every wicked and profane man will say, he sins of infirmity, as
the filthy fornicatour, the beastly drunkard, the common swearer, and the like,
but it is not so, these persons sin with all their hearts, and their sin
comes not from lust and affection, only at sometime violent, but ever ruling
and reigning in them, and so they sin of purpose, not of infirmity (but that
by the way) let it be remembered, that the lusts and motions of sin that are
in us, and do sometimes ouercarry us to sin, are for all that in a measure
mortified, when they are not dear unto us, but we hate and detest them, and
are weary of them, and strive against them, and this I speak for the comfort
of such as labor and groan vnde the burden of their own corruptions, yea,
and sometimes are driven in respect of them, to make question of their state,
whether they be the children of God or no, as sometimes this is their
complaint, I desire in my heart to obey God, and to keep faith and a good
conscience in all things, but I find that my nature is so wicked, and so
rebellious, that I sometimes doubt I am not the child of God; well examine thy
self by this, do thou (finding thy rebellion) hate thy lust? do thou
every day (humbling thy self before God) strive against it, and being
ouercarried by it to some sin, do thou recover thy self by new
repentance? if thou can with good conscience say, thou do this thou needst
not to fear it, thou art a child of God, for mark what the Apostle says,
Galat. 5.16. walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the
flesh, it is there made a privilege of Gods child not to be altogether void
of the lusts of the flesh, but not to fulfill them, that is, not to accomplish
them with love, with pleasure, and with full consent of will, if thou hate and
detest the lusts that are in thee, if thou resist them and strive against them,
if (being sometime ouercarried by them) thou recover thy self by new, and
speedy repentance, certainly (remember it to thy comfort) they shall never be
laid to thy charge, to thy condemnation.

It is a mere fancy that a man may when he will mortify the known
corruption of his own heart.
it is a conceit running in the minds of many, helped forward by strong
delusion of Satan, that they may subdue, and overcome their known sins and
corruptions when they will, and they may at their pleasure overcome their
pride, their lust, their covetousness, and the like. Alas they are deceived,
they shall find it will be as hard to do, as if they were to lay violent hands
on their own bodies, and to cut off a leg, or an arm, therefore let not any
of our hearts be possessed with such deceiving thoughts, Ierem. 23.23. Can the
blacke-Moore change his skin, or the Leopard his spots, then may they also
do good, that are accustomed to do evil, the Prophet there shows how hard a
thing it is to break of but a custom of sin, even as hard as to make a
black Moore white, a thing in nature impossible, now if custom which is but a
second nature be so hard to be broken of, what may we deem nature it self to
be, how hard a thing is it to abolish that corruption that is bred, and borne
with us, and is as dear unto us as any member of our bodies. Let no man then
imagine that he can at his own pleasure shake from him his old sweet familiar
sin, and offer violence to his own nature, and so pleasing himself in that
fond and windy conceit, neglect the timely, and careful using of the means of
mortification. Let us so sone as ever we spy any corruption, any sinful lust,
or motion in our hearts, use the means to kill the same, let us not suffer it
there to harbor, and rest, in hope hereafter to deal with it, and overcome
it, we shall find work enough at the first, and the longer we suffer it, the
stronger and the more heard it will be to ouermaster. Yea, let us know, it is
even a judgment of God upon us, if we suffer any known corruption in our
hearts, Note.
and use not the means to mortify it; for as there is no greater sign of
Gods wrath, then when he suffers men to go on, and thrive in sin; so
certainly it is his judgment upon us, when we suffer a known sin in our
selves, and use not the means to mortify, and to overcome it. Let us
therefore be stirred up to a timely and careful using of the means of
mortification, so soon as ever we find any sin in our selves.

The second conclusion may be thus gathered.

In that the Apostle says, (Mortify your members. etc,) Meaning the sinful
motions, lusts, and affections that are as the members of that monstrous body
of sin, and have force in our members; hence we may easily conclude thus
much.

That it is the inward lust, and corruption of the heart, It is the inward lust
and corruption of the heart that infecteth all the members of the body with
sin.
it is that which does fill the eye with pride, and with adluterie; so as the
very look of the eye is defiled, and the eye is full of Adultery: 2. Pet.
2.14. It is that which defiles the hand, and makes it lift up to shed blood,
and by it the foot is defiled, and hastneth to mischief, by it the tongue is
set on fire to blaspheme, to rail, to lie, and howsoever the Apostle says,
Iam. 3.6. That the wicked tongue is set on fire of Hell, meaning by the Devil,
yet it makes not against this I now deliver; because the Devil could not use
the tongue of man, or any member of his body, as an instrument of sin, Note.
were it not for the corruption that is within man himself; the Devil stirs
up that, and sends that abroad into all the parts and members of the body.
Math. 15.18. Our Savior teaches plainly, that all defilement of man comes
from within, even from the heart, from the lust and corruption of the heart,
that is the thing that does defile the whole man.

Solomon, Prou. 4.2.3. To keep our hearts with all diligence: We are chiefelie
to purge our hearts, and keep them with all diligence.
and in the first place, to look to the purging of our hearts from sinful
motions, lusts, and affections: would thou mortify the lust, or pride that
is in thine eye, thou must then labor to mortify the lust that is in thy
heart, which does fill thine eye with lust, it is preposterous and in vain to
go about to mortify the sin of thine hand, thy feet, etc. so long as thine
her at is full of unmortified motions and lusts, to instance in one particular,
it is to no purpose in respect of true mortification, to keep back thine hand
from doing wrong to others, either by violence or fraud, if thou have within
thee the heart of Ahab, even a secret liking of the goods of thy neighbor,
tickling, and delighting thine heart, and causing thee to wish, Oh would such a
house, or such a field were mine, for that rate of covetousness will at one
time or other send forth bitter fruits; look therefore in the first place, to
the mortification of the lust, and corruption of thine heart, if thou labor to
mortify the members of thy body, and not the members of that body of
corruption that are in thee, which fill thine eyes, thy hands, thy tongue, and
all the members of thy body with sin: the Lord may deal with thee
proportionablie, and justly fasten his judgment upon thine heart, and give
thee up to hardness and vnfeelingnesse of sin; for it is just with thee Lord
wherein we sin, therein to punish us.

One thing yet remains in this general exhortation to be considered (namely)
the quality of the members of sins, that they are earthly, we are to mark
that the Apostle says not, which are hellish or deuillish, as he might, but
which are earthly; he thought it sufficient to set out the ugliness of sinful
motions, lusts, and affections, to say they are earthly.

And indeed, Sinful motions of the heart are ugly and hateful enough in
that they are earthly.
it is enough to make the sinful motions of our hearts ugly, and hateful in
the sight of God, and of good men; yea, in our own eyes, if we be children
of God, when we find they tend only to earthly pleasures, it is enough to
make us hate and detest them, and desire to be freed from them, our Apostle
could not speak of such motions in other men but with tears in his eyes:
Phil. 3.19. They mind earthly things: the motions of their minds are earthly,
and shall we then speak and think of them in ourselves with delight? If we
do, we are far from the affection of the Apostle.

And indeed, If we be Gods children we cannot away with the sinful motions
of our hearts, because they are gross and earthly.
they cannot away with them.

Come we to the particular enumeration of the members of sin, which the
Apostle exhorted the Colossians to mortify, in the words following.

(Namely) Fornication. Uncleanness. Inordinate affection Evil Concupiscence.
and Covetousness.


He reckons up five particular sins, that are to be mortified, the four
first are sins against the seventh commandment.

Fornication. Uncleanness. Inordinate affection. Evil Concupiscence.
And the fifth is a sin against the eighth.

Covetousness.
Before we come to speak of these sins, as they are laid down in order;
observe the Apostles order, his manner of proceeding; from his general
exhortation to the mortification of sin. He comes down to particulars, he
thought it not sufficient to say mortify sin, but he descendes to exhort to
the mortification of such sins, as he knew were found among the Colossians, (as
indeed, Fornication was a sin common among the Gentiles) and the Apostle does
bend his speech much against it in his other Epistles; yea we shall find, he
insisteth more largely, in condemning that sin, then commonly he does, in
any other sin.

Hence we are taught thus much.

Preachers of the word are to speak against particular sins.
even sins known to be amongst them, to whom they speak; and not only to
say, take heed of sin, or fly from sin, but to point out particular
known sins that are found in them to whom they speak. We shall find it to
have been the practice of the Prophets and Teachers, from time to time. 2 Samuel
12.7. Nathan comes to David, and tells him, He was the man, yea, he went further
with him, and laid before him his particular sin, and the greatness of it,
bringing to his mind Gods mercy in his advancement, his contempt of Gods
goodness, and his closse and cunning dealing in committing his sin from that
verse to the 13. Thus Act. 2.23. the Apostle Peter tells the Jews of their
particular sin, That they had crucified Jesus of Nazareth, and to make them
see the ugliness of their sin, he goes on, and sets before them the manner
of Christ his apprehension, that they had taken him by the hands of wicked men,
preordained as vessels of wrath to that purpose, and that they had crucified
Jesus indeed, but that Jesus whom God had raised up from the dead, and by
his right hand exalted to the highest heavens, and made both Lord and Christ.
It were easy to show this by many other examples, that the Preachers of the
word, are not only to deal against sin in general, but to descend to
particulars, even to sins known to be in them to whom they speak.

The reason is plain, they are to labor to make men so to see sin, that
they may be humbled, and repent of it; and that will never be effected by
speaking against sin in general; every man will be ready to put of that
which is spoken in general from himself to others, and therefore there must
be a descending to particular sins known to be in them, to whom the Word is
preached.

First therefore, this gives warrant to the Ministers of Preachers of the Word
have warrant to speak against particular sins.
yea, it lies upon us that are Ministers as a duty, we are to deal with
sin, as private men use to speak of State-matters in general terms,
warily, and a far of, lest they be entangled in their talk, but we are to
strike at sin in particular; yea, we are to discover the peculiar ugliness,
and deformity of it, by the condition of the sinner, by the manner of doing it,
and by circumstances of time, and pla^e, and if sin be so set before such as
are guilty, it will either by grace make their hearts bleed for sorrow, as
theirs did, Acts 2.37. or by corruption burst for anger as theirs did, Acts
7.54.

Again, is it so that the Preachers of the Word are to his particular known
sin, We are not to think themselves hardly dealt withal when their
particular known sins are discovered by the preaching of the word.
be set before him in the preaching of the word; it is commonly said, when a
man reprooues a notorious sin in any man, that he speaks against that man,
as if a man and his sin were al one, whereas indeed the Preacher speaks not
against the person, but against the sin of the person, and if a man be
somewhat vehement in speaking against a particular known sin, according to
the nature and quality of it, then he shall be charged with too much rigor,
and he is too harsh and peremptory, and that his words are not to be borne;
thus we manifest, and belch out the corruption of our own hearts; yea, even
this is a particular sin too common amongst many: we delight in such
teachers, as come not near us, and in such as never touch our particular
sins: if a man fill our heads with novelties and strange conceits, he is the
only teacher for many of us; as for him that comes home to our hearts, and
sets our particular and personal sins before us, we cannot away with him, we
like not him but from the teeth outward. Let us take knowledge of this to be
the particular sin of many of us, and let us be humbled for it; otherwise we
may justly look for the curse of God on our hearing, that as we delight in
plausible novelties, so the Lord in his just iudgdment may suffer our heads to
be filled with them, and keep our hearts empty of all saving comfort; yea, even
hide from us the sweetness and comforts of his word.

Come we now to speak of the sins here reckoned up by the Apostle that are
to be mortified, and first of these four, Fornication. Uncleanness.
Inordinate affection. Evil Concupiscence.
Which are sins under one head, and all forbidden in the seventh commandment,
and of these I will not speak at large, for every one of them might take up a
large discourse but only so much as is for the purpose of the present text,
which drives at the mortification of these sins.

I will therefore:

First, show what these sins are severally, and the greatness of them.

And secondly, the means that are to be used for the mortification of them,
with application of the same.

And after that, come to some general doctrine that may be gathered from these
words.

First therefore know we that (Fornication) is an outward What fornication is.
and it is the carnal copulation of two single or unmarried persons, even
filthiness committed by two persons unmarried, and howsoever, this is not so
great a sin as adultery, which is filthiness committed between married
persons, or at least one of them being married, yet is it a most grievous
sin: 1. Corinthians. 6. from verse 15. to the end, The greatness of that sin.
our Apostle does there paynt out the greatness of it in lively colors, as
that it takes the members of Christ, and makes them the members of an harlot,
if defiles the body in more special manner then other sins, whence it is,
that men and women are counted dishonest, if not only, yet chiefly for the
sin of fornication, it defiles the temple of the holy Ghost, and it
prostituteth the bodies of men and women bought with a great price, even the
precious blood of Christ, to most base and vile uses: add to these the
fearful effects and fruits of this sin, which may also set out the
greatness of it, it brings forth a diseased body, a poor estate, and an ill
name, yea, which is woorste of all, it makes both body and soul liable to the
curse of God. 1. Corinthians. 6.6. yea, not only the body and soul of one, but of
two at once, even two at one time by this sin are enwrapped within compass of
Gods curse, and therefore doubtless fornication is a grievous sin.

(uncleanness) What uncleanness is.
this sin also is an outward breach of the seventh commandment, and by it we
are to understand, every actual defilement of body against nature, as that of
incest, with such as are within degrees forbidden, and laid forth Leuit. 18.
from verse 6. to the 18. and of other defilements which are more against
nature, as that which is committed with another kind, as with bruit beasts,
expressly forbidden, Leuit. 18.23. or that which is committed with that sex
which is not for that natural use spoken of, Romans 1.26.27. and was the sin
of Sodom, or that which is most unnatural, and was in part the sin of Onan,
Genesis 38.9. now these defilements of the body are most foul and grievous
sins, The greatness of that sin.
in that they are not only against the Law of God, but against the very light
of nature, and be commonly punishments of some other horrible sins, and ever
follow a very profane and dead heart: Romans 1.24. the Apostle says, when the
Heathen turned the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the
image of a corruptible man etc. God gave them up to their hearts lusts: unto
uncleanness, etc. therefore all kind of uncleanness is a horrible sin.

What inordinate affection is.
The third sin of the same kind here mentioned is the (inordinate affection)
which is an inward breach of the seventh commmandement, in the original it is
but one word (...), and hereby we are to understand the passion of lust,
which boileth and burns within, provoking the body, and mind to
uncleanness, and this is that which the Apostle calls burning: The greatness of
this sin.
1. Cor. 7.9. It is better to marry then to burn, that is, to have within a
continual feruencie of lust, boiling and stirring to uncleanness and
fornication, and herein may appear the greatness of this sin, in that it
is a burning lust and affection, for being so, it not only hinders good
motions of the heart, but as fire does consume all moisture of grace, yea where
there is an heart enflamed, and burning with the passion of fervent lust, that
slame does distract the mind, distemper the body, and disorder all holy
actions, it is worth marking that Peter says, 2. Pet. 2.14. they that have
adulterous eyes, which are the messengers of that passion of lust, they cannot
cease to sin, therefore (without question) this inordinate affection, this
passion of lust is a grievous sin.

Now the last sin of this kind expressed, What evil concupiscence is.
is Evil concupiscence) which is also an inward breach of the seventh
commandment, and first the Apostle calls it (evil) to distinguish it both from
the desire of nature, of things serving for the necessity of nature, as meat
and drink, which in it self is neither good nor ill, and also from the lust
of the Spirit, spoken of Gal. 5.17. which is holy and good, and this evil
concupiscence here spoken of, is the inward motion of the heart to
uncleanness, with consent of will, it is the purpose and desire of the heart
to any filthy act of adultery, called by our Savior the adultery of the heart:
Matthew. 5.28. he that looks on a woman to lust after her, The greatness of this
sin.
that is, with a will and desire to her, has committed adultery with her
already in his heart, now this is the mother and root of that burning lust, and
they differ only in degree one from another, this desire to any filthy act of
adultery is the first degree of lust, and that passion of lust is a further
degree, giving no rest, but ever stirring to the committing of the filthy act
of adultery, and therefore this desire of the heart to any filthy act of
adultery, being the mother of that fervent and boiling lust, and the
grandmother of uncleanness must needs be a great and a grievous sin.

Having thus seen these sins what they are, Means that serve for the
mortification of the forenamed sins are four.
and the greatness of them, consider we in the next place, the special means
that serve for the mortifying of them, which are chiefly these.

First, the fear of God, that we fear God in his word and commandment that
forbids these sins, that fear will cleanse both the heart and body: Marriage
indeed is a means to avoid the act of filthiness, Note.
but it will not kill lust if this fear of God be wanting, this has the
promise, Eccles. 7.28. I find more bitter then death, the woman whose heart is
as nets and snares, and her hands as bands; he that is good before God, shall
be delivered from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.

Prou. 2.10. Solomon says, when wisdom enters into thine heart, and
knowledge deligtheth thy soul, then verse 16. It shall deliver thee from the
strange woman, even from the stranger that flattereth with her words.





Reproof of such as use not these means.
If we now examine our selves by these means spoken of, it is to be feared we
shall find that many of us are unmortified in respect of these sins, yea,
even such as will challenge to themselves that they are free from the filthy
act of adultery, and not to stand on it, whether they fear the Lord, or
delight in his word, or use prayer against these lusts, or no, do not many
persons show themselves unmortified in regard of these sins, in their light
and wanton apparel, in their newfangled and garish attire.

They will say,

I answer thee, I take not on me to know thine heart,

Now then that every one may be stirred up carefully to use the means that
serve for the mortification of these sins.

Let us consider how far they provoke the Lord to wrath; A motive to stir
us up to use the means before spoken of.
we shall find they provoke him not only to execute his vengeance on the
parties themselves, that are guil^ty of them, giving them up in their souls to
prophanenes, and plaguing them in their bodies, with foul and filthy
diseases, but they provoke the Lord to execute his wrath on the place, and land
where they live, Leuit. 18.25. the Lord says, the land is defiled by them, and
shall vomit out her inhabitants, the words are of great vehemency, and
therefore our fear should be great, that we provoke not the Lord to such
vengeance, we ought to be stirred up to a careful practice of the means,
serving for the mortifying of these sins.

Come we to the third thing I propounded to stand upon (namely) some general
doctrine, that may be gathered

We may gather.

Fornication is not a thing indifferent or of small moment
and lightly to be regarded, but it is a sin, it is a breach of Gods Law,
and that a great and fearful breach of it, this point I have sufficiently made
manifest, only remember that the Apostle in the 1. Corinthians. 6. does much
insist on that, and condemns it by many arguments, and he calls it directly
sin, verse 18. Flee fornication, every sin that a man does is without the
body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.

Now thi^ we are to hold for truth, against whatsoever can be said to the
contrary, for indeed there is something said and objected by some to the
contrary, even against the plain evidence of the word, either in way of
extenuation of this sin, or to prove it to be a thing indifferent.

Hosea the Prophet Hos. 1.2. to take to him a wife of fornications, and
therefore (say some) fornication is not simply evil, and in it self no sin,
for if it be (say they) then did the Lord command the Prophet to sin.



Abraham had sinned if he had not gone about to kill his son Isaac, being so
commanded by the Lord, Gen 22. and the Israelites had sinned, if they had not
spoiled the Egyptians as they were commanded of the Lord, Exodus 11.2. though
the fact of Abraham without the special commandment of the Lord, had been
murder, and the fact of the Israelites had been theft, therefore it makes
nothing for the defense of fornication to prove it no sin* because the
Prophet had a special commandment to take unto him a wife of fornications.

It is further objected, Acts 15.29. the Apostles decreed that the Gentiles
should abstain from things offered to Idolles, and that that is strangled,
which are things indifferent, and to these they join fornication therefore say
some, fornication is a thing indifferent.

To this I answer,

Therefore wickedly deal the Papists who tolerate and permit open whoredom,
The wickedness of the Papists in tollerating whoredom.
the Pope allows the curtesants in Rome and other places at a rent to
profess filthiness, yea, the Papists stick not to say, and publish in their
writings, that the stews are for a commonwealth, and that in some persons
fornication is better then marriage, which indeed is a doctrine of diuelles,
and fetched from the pit of hell, what can be more contradictorie to the
Spirit of God, and to the plain evidence of the Scripture.

Oh but say they, of greater evils, as adultery, incest, and the like.

Augustine says, God will not have such a gain to be recompensed with such a
loss, and the Apostle says, Romans 3.8. Some say, let us do ill, that good may
come thereof, but mark what follows, their damnation is just, evil must not
be done, that good may come of it: we may see by this the shameless impudency
of the Papists, what wickedness will not they defend, that so boldly plead for
confessed filthiness.

It ought to be far from us to account fornication but a trisling matter.
and a grievous sin, then far be it from every one of us to extenuate the
matter, and to account of fornication but as a trifle, and as the world
speaks, but a trick of youth, shall we esteem that a trifle, and a trick,
that is repugnant to the eternal wisdom and justice of God revealed in his
holy Word, that shuts out of the kingdom of God, and opens hell mouth upon us,
and makes us subject to the curse of God, to be everlastingly tormented in
body and soul in the fire of hell? far be it from every one of us, and
certainly it is far from all that have any dram of grace, and any
conscience, or true feeling in them, they that esteem fornication a small
matter, and but a trick of youth, the Devil has dulled their hearts, and
that is come on them, the Prophet speaks of Hos. 4.11. whoredom, and wine,
and new wine has taken away their heart, even their judgment and
understanding, their conscience and feeling; and therefore labor thou to
esteem of fornication, as it ought to be esteemed, even as a foul sin and
fearful breach of Gods Law, and as a sin that of it self brings forth
fearful effects in this life, and in the life to come destruction of body
and soul, and so account of the threatenings of God against it, as of certain
executions, fear the plagues and judgments denounced against it, as presently
to come, on the committing of it, for if thou suffer Satan so far to prevail
with thee, as to account fornication but a trifle, certainly then as it is,
Prou. 7.22. thou will straight ways follow the harlot, as an ox that goes to
the slaughter, and as a fool to the stocks for correction, not discerning
whither thou go, or what danger thou art like to fall into, therefore
account of fornication as it is, and ought to be accounted of, and learn to
fear and avoid it.

In the next place observe we, that the Apostle does not only exhort to the
mortification of lust, breaking out into the act of fornication or uncleanness,
but to the mortifying also of the passion of lust, of inward burning, and of
evil concupiscence, to the mortifying of the purpose, and desire of the heart
to any filthy act of lust, hence we may take up this point.

That we are not only to strive against the act of We must not only strive
against the act of fornication but we must also labor to subdue the inward
lust of our hearts.
we must labor to stock up the root, and to dry up the fountain of all
filthiness, and evil concupiscence 1. Thessal. 4.3.4.5. the Apostle teaches
that our sanctification according to the will of God stands not only in
abstaining from the outward act of fornication, but that every one of us
know how to possess his vessel in holiness and honor, and not in the lust
of concupiscence, that is, not in the inward burning lust, stirring up to
filthiness coming from evil concupiscence, as if he had said, that is
indeed true sanctification agreeable to the will of God, and pleasing to God,
that is, throughout, outwardly in the body, keeping that pure and undefiled,
and inwardly in the heart, rooting out from thence, the lust of concupiscence,
and therefore we must not only strive against the outward act of filthiness,
but labor to pluck up the root, and to dry up the fountain of it.

And there is reason for it, labor but in vain though we cut off the branches
of lust; yet the root it self being still left in our hearts, certainly, they
will spring and grow again; therefore, in reason, we are not only to abstain
from the act of filthynesse, but to mortify the inward lusts of our hearts.

Reproof of such as are wanting in this duty.
I am afraid many of our own hearts will witness against us, and condemn
us; do not many, only for their profit, or credits sake, either to avoid the
danger of the Law of man, or shame of the world, or the like, abstain from the
act of fornication, and uncleanness, and yet never strive against the
inordinate affection, and evil concupiscence, which they know to abound in
their hearts, yea their own hearts can tell them they nourish impure, and
filthy lusts within, and yet they think all is well, so long as they are free
from outward filthynesse; yea, it may be some there be, who are unfit by
reason of age, or debility of body, for the practice of (Fornication) who yet
delight in seeing others wanton, and their hearts are tickled, and leap for
joy within them, when they see others run madding after that sin, in all
wanton and unseemly gestures, and they think that it is a matter of nothing,
and they are in no danger at all in that respect: I fear me, that which I now
speak sits near many persons, and they cannot avoid the dint of it, I appeal
to their own consciences, whether it be not so with many; and let such
persons whose hearts are herein guilty, know, that they are far from true
mortification, and consequently (as yet) far from hope of salvation.
Therefore think on it it, whosoever thou art, that think all is well, if
thou abstain from the act of fornication, or be unfit for the practice of of
it, and yet do harbor in thine heart known filthy lusts, and withal
remember that thy inward lust and concupiscence, is a breach of the
commandments of God, and that his eye does see thy most secret filthiness,
and will one day bring it to judgment, Eccles. 12. 14. the eyes of his glory
are so pure, as he will not allow the least filthy conceit in thine heart, and
therefore think it not sufficient to abstain from the outward act of
filthynesse, but labor thou to mortify, to kill, and crucify the inward lust
of thine heart, yea never rest using means to that purpose, till thine own
conscience bear thee witness, thou have in some good measure subdued and
overcome the same.

One other general doctrine may be gathered from these words: In that the
Apostle does exhort to the mortification of these sins, it shows plainly.

That we by nature are prone to fall into them; and So great is the corruption
of nature that without Gods grace we are prone to vile monstrous, and ugly
sin.
the great corruption of our nature, which without Gods grace is prone to such
vile monstrous, and such ugly sins: I showed the greatness of the corruption
of nature in handling the 11. verse 2. Chap. in that it is a body of flesh; but
hereby it may further appear to us, in that it shows it self in so many
foul sins of one kind, and some of them so enormious, and monstrous, as
they violate the very law of nature yea so great is the corruption of our
nature, breaking out into these sins, that age will not abate the burning
lust that issues out from thence. May we not observe it, that even aged
persons, whose bodies are decrepit and past the practice of uncleanness, yet
the fire of lust is still burning in their hearts, and lets loose their tongues
to filthyinesse? Oh then the huge heap of corruption that is in our nature;
the Papists say, we aggrauate the filth of nature too much, O they stand on
their pure naturals, but indeed the filth cannot be sufficiently spoken of, as
one says well, We are to take notice of the filthynesse of our nature, and to
use al good means to keep us from soul and monstous sin.


Let us take knowledge of it, and let it stir us up to use all good means,
that may keep us from these sins, we have the seed of al these sins within
us, and think not that age will mortify thy lust, or that humane wit will
keep thee from these sins, as some use to say, Oh such a one is a jolly wise
man, I marvel therefore, that he should so ouershoote himself, and fall into
that sin of fornication, implying thereby that humane wisdom is sufficient
to keep from filthynesse; no, no, thou art deceived if thou so think. David
was no fool, and yet we know he fell into this sin, yea consider it well,
that David when he was somewhat grown in years, and had also the remedy
against it, yea, as those times suffered, many wives, yet fell into the sin
of adultery: therefore be not thou secure, and think thy self safe, because
thou art wise, or aged, or have the remedy. No, no, think on the corruption of
thy nature, and still use all the good means that may keep thee from these
sins. Labor thou to fear God in thine heart, and that his grace may
sanctify, and cleanse it from filthy lust, and when any unclean conceit is
cast into thy mind, speedily reject it, bend thy mind another way, take in
hand some business about which thou can be busy indeed, and call to God
for strength, and then, no doubt, he will help thee to quench that fiery dart.

Come we now to the fifth particular sin, here specified Covetousness: (and
Covetousness which is Idolatry.)

In speaking of this sin, keeping my self still as neeere as I can, to the
purpose of the Apostle. I will observe the order, I held in handling of the
former sins.

1 As first, I will show what Covetousness is. 2 Secondly, the greatness of
that sin. 3 Thirdly the means that are to be used for the mortification of
it, with some application of the same. 5 And then come to some general
doctrine, that may be gathered from these words.
(Covetousness) is an inward breach of the eighth Commandment, What
Covetousness is
it is the theft of the heart, as the Apostle Peter 2. epist. 2.14. says of
wicked men, They have hearts exercised with Covetousness. It may be thus
briefly described.

It is an immoderate desire of having much, so the original word here used
does signify, and we are to understand it, with a reference to outward riches.

Now for the better conceiving of the nature of this sin,

First, it may be demanded, whether there may be a

Answer: there may,

Secondly it may be demanded: when is the desire of

Answer: Agur, Prou. 30.8. Feed me with food convenient for me: or with bread
of my allowance; where we see that Agur prayed to God, and desired of him that
he might have food of his allowance, (that is) the daily portion which God by
his wisdom, and providence had cut out for him, both to sustain his nature,
and to further him in the service of God, and if we desire such a measure of
outward riches, then is our desire moderate and lawful; and by this we may
further conceive when our desire of riches is immoderate (namely) when we
desire more outward wealth, then God sees necessary for the preservation of
our lives, and the maintenance of our lawful state, and condition, and that
immoderate desire of riches, is covetousness.

The greatness of this sin.
I might show this to be a great sin many ways, as that it is a sin against
God, a breach of his Law, it shuts out of the kingdom of God, but I will make
it manifest by that which the Apostle does here subioine, that it is
Idolatry, adding to that one thing further.

Covetousness must needs be a great sin in that it is Idolatry, in that it
is a spiritual Idolatry, and so not only a sin against the second Table,
but against the first also, in such sort, as he, or she, that is possessed
with it, is a spiritual Idolater, as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 5.5. which is
said not only in regard of the covetous man's love to riches, surpassing his
love to God (for so fornicators, and other sinners may also be said to be
Idolaters) but in that respect which is more proper to this sin, which is, that
covetous men put their trust in riches, which ought to be wholly put in God,
and is a chief part of that holy and inward worship we owe unto God.

The ground of covetousness.
For indeed the very ground of Covetousness, and of an insatiable desire of
riches is this: men have a false and foolish imagination, that wealth will
bring some happiness, and that if they have store of wealth, then they are in
safty and happy case, and thereupon their desire of riches is enlarged, and
they become exceeding greedy and insatiable, in desiring and seeking after
them, and having abundance are still covetous, and so withdraw their hearts
from the Lord, and trust to their riches, as to holds most strong and mighty.

Yea, many times covetous rich men so trust to their riches, as thereby in
their conceit they secure themselves against calamities; they think themselves
free from danger of famine, and many other afflictions; yea, we verify this by
a common speech of men, we commonly use to say of one that is wealthy. Oh, he
cannot do amiss, he has the world at will; as if we should say, he is free
from danger, no hurt can come to him, and this is undoubtedly true of all
covetous persons, they make their goods their God, they place happiness in
them, and they rest on them as on a foundation most sure and stable, that which
Job says in way of clearing himself, Job 31.24. is doubtless true of all
covetous persons, They make gold their hope, and say to the wedge of gold thou
art my confidence. And hence it is that the Apostle requires Timothy, 1. Tim.
6.17. to charge rich men that they trust not to their uncertain riches,
knowing that to be a common sin of rich men, to trust to their riches, and
thus is the covetous person an Idolater, the Devil setting up in his heart,
which ought to be the Temple of God, the Idol of riches, and so is
covetousness without question, a gteat and grievous sin.

Yet in the second place, the greatness of this sin will The effects of
covetousness
if we consider the fearful effects of it, 1. Timoth. 6.9. the Apostle says,
they that will be rich, they that have an insatiable desire of riches, fall
into temptations, and suares, and into many foolish and noisome lusts, which
drown men in perdition and destruction, and Verse. 10. he shuts up all in
general, that it is the very root of all evil, it is the mother of all
mischief, which we are thus to understand, that where this sin of
covetousness is, there sin abounds: there is no evil that a covetous man
will abstain from, if it may further his gain, neither will he willingly do
any good that seems contrary to his profit. Yea this sin of covetousness it
carries a man with a violent stream to sin, even against conscience; it made
Ahab sick till he had his desire, both Naboths vineyard, and his life; it set
Judas forward, against all sense, to sell his Master for thirty pieces of
silver, and that after diverse admonitions; and whence come treacheries, and
cruel murders,, sometimes of Fathers and Mothers, but commonly from hence,
the covetous heart is set on the booty, saying to it self, by this means, such
an house, such land, or such a sum of money shall be mine, and the heart
being set on that, it puts out all light of religion, of reason, and sometimes
of nature it self. Yea further, which is worst of all, this sin of
covetousness, it brings a man or woman almost to an impossibility of
repentance, and salvation. It is almost impossible that a covetous person
should be saved, Matthew. 19.24. says our Savior, It is easier for a Camel to
go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of God. (namely) A covetous rich man, the reason is given by our Savior in the
exposition of the Parable, Matthew. 13.22. The covetous heart is taken up with
the cares of this world, and those choke the seed of the word, and hinder it
from taking place in the heart, and so frustrate all means of repentance and
salvation; and of this the Lord complained, Ezekiell 33.31. They come to thee
(says he) as people use to come, and my people sit before thee, and hear thy
words, but their heart goes after covetousness. Their couteous hearts will
not suffer them to profit by the preaching; therefore without question the
sin of covetousness, being such a root of bitterness, and bringing forth
such cursed fruits must needs be confessed in this respect also, to be a
great sin.

Means serving for the mortification of the sin of covetousness are three.
1. Means.
Come we then to consider such means, for the mortification of this foul
sin, the lust of covetousness. The special means that serve to that
purpose, are chiefly three.

The first is a due consideration of the insufficiency of riches in themselves,
and of themselves to do us any good; for (as we have heard) it is an
imagination of some good, or happiness to be found in riches, that sets the
heart a work to desire them excessiuely. We must therefore labor truly to
understand and consider the insufficiency of them in themselves to do us any
good, that of themselves they are not able to do us good, as indeed they are
not, our own experience may teach us so much; we see sometimes a man pines
away in the midst of plenty, though he have abundance of wealth, yet nothing
is able to do him good, unless the Lord bless it as a means of good unto
him, it is not all the wealth in the world; that of it self can help us, or
keep away any judgment of God from us: Pro. 11.4. riches avail not in the
day of wrath: this we must labor to be persuaded of, and we shall find it a
notable means to expel out of our hearts the lust of covetousness.

The second means to this purpose is this: we are to consider Note.
and not in his mercy, why then should we enlarge our hearts immoderately to
desire wealth, which being given upon that desire, has the curse of God
attending on it.

The third means serving for the mortification of the Let your conversation
be without covetousness, and be content with those things that ye have)
where he makes an opposition between contentation and covetousness. So that
where contentation is, there cannot be covetousness. It is an excellent
means to drive it out, we must therefore labor for contentation, even to be
well pleased with that particular state, wherein the Lord has set us, and
to esteem it the best estate for us, be it better or be it worse, and to
this end we are to consider that nothing comes unto us, but by the good
providence of God, and (we being his children) from the good and gracious
hand of the Lord; and again, that we are less then the least of Gods
mercies, as Jacob said, Genesis the thirty two, the tenth, that we are
unworthy to draw breath in the air, and these things well considered, will
settle our hearts with contentation, and will be an excellent means to root
out the lust of covetousness. Having now seen this sin of covetousness
what it is, and the greatness of it, that it is as the sin of idolatry, and
that it brings forth many fearful effects, especially, that it brings almost
an impossibility of repentance and salvation, it nearly concerns every one of
us, to look into our selves to see whether we be guilty of this sin, or no?
if we duly examine our selves, We are to examine our selves touching the sin of
covetousness.
it is to be feared that the most of our hearts will be found infected with
this sin, our practice shows it, what heauing and shouing is there for the
things of this life? do not such as be wealthy use all means, both in buying
and selling to keep the poor still under? do they not many times sweep the
market of a commodity, so that others that come after them, can find nothing
but the refuse, or be forced to buy at the worst hand? and what should I say of
our fraudulent and deceitful dealing, and our seeking and taking advantage one
against another for the enriching of our selves? do not these things, and many
more that might be brought, plainly show that we are covetous.



Two motives to stir us up to use means to mortify the lust of
covetousness.
and to this purpose consider we only two things.

First this, thou may hear the word with joy, and have many good things in
thee, yet if thine heart be possessed with covetousness, that will not suffer
any grace to take rooting in thee, a croppe of corn will as soon thrive on a
waste mountain, or in a thick thornie hedge, as grace will grow in thine
heart if that thou be covetous.

Again if thou care not for inward growth of grace, yet I am sure thou carest
for the continuance of thy wealth, know therefore that covetousness will in
time waste and consume it, one compares covetousness to a thief, and says,
it is in vain for thee to lock up thy riches, so long as thou have within,
the great thief covetousness, and indeed the holy Ghost says, Prou. 11.28.
he that trusts in his riches (as every covetous person does) he shall fall:
for besides his inability of standing, he has the hand of God to pursue him,
and to push him down, therefore certainly he shall fall, and his estate shall
not continue, if not in his time, yet in his sons days, and we shall find
it true, that hardly a third heir shall enjoy the wealth of a covetous
worldling, if then we either regard the inward growth of grace, or the
continuance of that wealth we have with comfort, let us be stirred up to use
all good means serving for the mortifying of the lust of covetousness, labor
thou rightly to consider the insufficiency of riches in themselves to do thee
good, and that riches being excessiuely desired, and so given upon that desire
they have the curse of God attending upon them, and withal, labor to be
contented with thy present estate, esteeming that the best estate for thee, as
coming from the good providence of God, and that thou art less then any
mercy of God vouchsafed unto thee, that so thou may root out of thine
heart, the cursed lust of covetousness.

Some general doctrines remain to be gathered from these words.

I will only point at them.

First, in that covetousness is here condemned, we may gather.

That having much is not condemned, but the immoderate abundance of wealth on
us, The h^uing of much wealth is not unlawful, but the immoderate desire of
having much.
we neither desiring nor seeking after it, we may lawfully hold and use it,
we find many testimonies and examples in Scripture, warranting the having of
much,) if God give it) and the using of it, if we use it to Gods glory, and
the good of our selves and others, and with moderation, not setting our hearts
upon it: Psalm. 62.10. If riches increase, set not your hearts thereon. We
are to moderate our desire of wealth and having much to use it well.


The second general thing offered hence is this.

We see here, that there may be idolatry in respect of baser things then
Saints or Angels, Idolatry may be in respect of ba^er things then Saints or
Angels.
and therefore that Popish distinction of (...) and (...) of worship and
service,

VER. 6. For the which things sakes, the wrath of God comes on the children
of disobedience.
Confutation of a Popish distinction.
Our Apostle having verse 5. laid before the Colossians his exhortation to
mortify sin, and reckoned up some particular sins, that they were to
labor by all good means to mortify in this sixth verse and in the seventh
following, he labors to strengthen his exhortation, and to urge it upon them,
and that by two reasons.

Interpretation.
and the sum of it.

For the which things sakes etc. that is, for the which sins sakes before
spoken of (the wrath of God) by the wrath or anger of God, we are to
understand the effects of his anger, his punishments, plagues, and judgments
in this world, but especially the everlasting torments in hell, for it is
frequent and usual in Scripture, to put the anger, or wrath of God for the
effects of his anger, Romans 2.5. the Apostle says, thou after thine
hardness, and heart that cannot repent, heapest up wrath, that is, heapest
up punishments, and judgments, as it may plainly appear in the words
following, against the day of wrath, etc. that is, against the day of
judgment, when the Lord shall execute his just judgment on the wicked, when
the Lord Jesus shall say to them on the left hand, go ye cursed into
everlasting fire, etc. (comes) that is, certainly, and without all fail,
seiseth and takes hold on (the children of disobedience) this is a form of
speech often used in Scripture, it is an Hebraisme, and by it we are to
understand such as are obstinate and wilful in their disobedience, such as
will not be dissuaded from sin, nor yield to any divine admonitions, that
might draw them from sin, but are as it were, made and framed of
disobedience, and as it were, brought out of the womb of wilful rebellion,
and therefore called children of disobedience, in one word, by this manner of
speech is meant, such as are disobedient, rebellious and refractarie in sin,
and will not yield to any good council or admonition, nor by any good means
be brought to repentance, thus then we are to conceive the meaning of the
Apostle, in the words of this verse, as if he had said.

For the which sins sakes before specified, the plagues, and judgments of
God in this life, and everlasting torments in hell do ceaze, and certainly
take hold on such as are disobedient and rebellious, hard-hearted and
impenitent, and will not by any good means be brought to repentance.

Now before we come to consider the matter of doctrine offered from the words
themselves, observe we the argument of the Apostle, the reason he uses to
persuade to the mortifying of the sins before spoken of. He takes his
argument from the effect of those sins, that these sins, and every one of
them not repented of, brings down the wrath of God, and therefore they are to
be mortified, the Apostle would have the Colossians to consider the heavy wrath
of God attending on those sins, and thereby to be moved to the mortifytng of
them, hence we may gather thus much.

A serious consideration of Gods wrath that abides for sin ever goes before
true repentance for sin.
is a notable means to move men to repentance, for mortification is one part
of repentance, or I may thus deliver the point grounded on this context, and
other places of Scripture.

A serious consideration of the heavy wrath of God and of our fearful
condemnation, that abides for sin, ever goes before true repentance for
sin. Never did any, nor shall any truly repent of any known sin without a
serious consideration of the curse, and condemnation due to that sin going
before.

The reason is plain, true contrition of heart, must go before true
repentance, Acts. 2.37. first they were pricked in their hearts, their hearts
were compunct and wounded at the sight of their sin, and of the wrath of God
due unto it, and then in verse the 18, follows Peter's council, (...), repent,
or amend your lives.

This lets us see, Many deceive themselves in respect of true repentance.
they hold themselves truly repentant for their known sins, and will needs
be so accounted, and yet they can witness to themselves, that their hearts
were never wounded with a consideration of Gods wrath, they never set
themselves before the judgment seat of the Lord, nor considered how grievous a
thing their sin is, in the sight of God, and how displeasing to him, and what
fearful condemnation is due for the same. Happily they have had a vanishing
touch of heart for it, causing them to send forth a natural sigh or sob, and
causing them to say they have sinned, and they are sorry for it, and they cry
God mercy or the like, but their hearts were never truly pressed down, and
broken by the weight and burden of their sins, and with consideration of the
fearful wrath of God for the same. Out of question, I now speak that which
many of us know to be true in our selves, if we deal truly with our
selves, we cannot deny it, let us therefore not any longer deeeiue our
selves, but learn this lesson, that a serious consideration of Gods heavy
wrath due to sin, ever goes before true repentance for sin, and make use of
it, do thou know thy sin, and would thou repent for it truly? then set
thy self before the judgment seat of God, and consider the greatness of thy
sin, and what fearful wrath and condemnation abides thee for it, and let
the law be thy Schoolmaster, as the Apostle teaches, Galath. 3.24. let it
whippe and seourge thy naked conscience, showing thee thy sin, and the
punishment due for the same, yea, never to rest till the consideration of thy
sin, and of the wrath of God, due to thy sin, have brought thee down as it
were to the gates of hell, and to an holy despair in thy self, and then no
doubt (if thou belong to God) Christ will show thee comfort, he will work in
thee true repentance, and give thee strength against thy sin, yea thou shall
be delivered from the guilt and punishment of thy sin, and from the power of
it.

Come we now to the doctrine offered from the words themselves.

First observe we in a word, briefly a different manner of speaking in
Scripture, A different manner of speaking in Scripture.
in respect of our holiness, and sin, we read here, and in other places
of Scripture, that for sin comes wrath, but never shall we find it said in
Scripture, that for our holiness, or good works comes life and salvation, the
Apostle, Romans 6.23. having said (that the wages of sin is death) goes not on
with his opposition, that the wages of righteousness is life, but he changes
his terms, and says, but the gift of God is eternal life.



In that the Apostle says here, that the sins before spoken of bring down
Gods wrath, no doubt his purpose was not only to persuade the Colossians to
mortify them, but to work in them a religious fear and care to avoid them,
for having the same sentence, Ephesians. 5.6. and against the same sins, he
adds verse 7. be) the point hence offered is this. We are to fear and avoid
all known sin because of themselves they bring down Gods wrath and
judgments upon us.


We are to fear, and avoid these, and all other known sins whatsoever, even
because of themselves they bring down Gods wrath and judgments, howsoever we
are principally to fear and avoid sin, even because it is sin, and
displeasing to God, if there were no hell nor punishment due unto it, that is
the true fear of Gods children, yet we may, and we are in the second place,
to fear sin in respect of Gods wrath and judgments: and hence it is, that
the Apostle 2 Corinthians. 5. having made known, verse 10. That we must all
appear before the judgment seat of Christ. Verse 11. he says, Knowing
therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men. We knowing how dreadful
shall be the doom of wicked men at the day of judgment, we persuade men to
avoid sin; this fear was in ^^uid, Psalm. 119.120. My flesh trembles for
fear of thee. Asid he adds further, I am afraid of thy judgments. David had
a religious fear of God, he feared God himself, he feared to offend him, and
then in the second place he stood in aw of his judgments, and indeed such is
the canker of our nature, that the most regenerate have need to set before
them the wrath and judgments of God due to sin, that even in consideration
thereof they may be afraid of sin.

Let not then, such as truly fear God, Gods children are not exempt from all
fear of Gods wrath and judgments.
though they are freed from the wrath of God by Christ, and do fear God for
his mercy, with a filial and childe-like fear; yet that does not exclude a
fear of his judgments to keep us from sin, we are chiefly, and in the
first place to fear and avoid sin, even because it is sin, but in the
second place, we are to fear the wrath of God against sin; yea, we are
often, and diligently to ponder on the threatenings we find in the Book of
God, against sin, and to consider the execution of his wrath upon impenitent
sinners, and not to pass by the judgments of God, heard of, or seen in the
world, but to lay them to heart, that thereby our hearts may be still kept in
the fear of God, and that we may ever carry in us, a reverent awe of his
great and glorious majesty.

Observe we further, that the Apostle here speaks in the time present, he
says not, for which things sakes, the wrath of God has come, or will come,
but comes; which implies a continual action, that the wrath of God cease
not to come on such, as live in the sins before named, or in any known
sin; yea, many times the wrath of God is on men living in this world, when
they have little or no apprehension of it; yea, therein is the wrath of God on
them in most fearful manner, in that they have no sense nor feeling of it,
striking them with blockishnesse and dullness of spirit, and hardness of heart,
giving them up to a reprobate sorry so that hence we may conclude the certainty
of Gods wrath.

Gods wrath fails not to come on such as live and continue in known sins.
it is so certain that the Lords wrath shall ceaze on them, that live in
known sins, as that they have the earnest of it, and it has already taken
hold of them; and to this agrees that speech of Christ, John 3.36. He that
believes in the son has everlasting life, and he that obeieth not the
son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. 2. Pet. 2.3. The
Apostle says, that the damnation of false teachers (sleeps not) as if he
had said, their judgment and damnation is coming, and shall certainly fall
on them; and to that purpose our Apostle speaks powerfully, Epes. 5.6. Let no
man deceive you with vain words; for, for such things comes the wrath of
God upon the children of disobedience, as if he had said, happily some will
tell you, that fornicaiton etc. are no great sins, but humane slips and
infirmities, and that they exclude not out of Gods kingdom, but let no man so
deceive you, their words are but vain, and deceitful: learn you to know it
for a certain truth, that for such things the wrath of God comes upon the
children of disobedience.

We are, to be persuaded that Gods wrath shall certainly come on wicked and
rebellious sinners.
that the wrath of God, his plagues and judgments in this life, and fearful
torments in hell, shall most certainly come on wicked and rebellious sinners,
men are hardly brought to believe this, it will hardly sincke into their hearts
that their sins are so heinous as preachers would make them, and that Gods
judgments do so certainly abide for them; if they believe these things, would
they live in whoredom, drunkenness, and other known sins as they do?
Would they live in malice, and envy? would they lie and slander, rail, curse,
and swear, and commit all filthy abominations? Their living and pleasing
themselves in these, and other like sins make it plain, they believe not
that Gods wrath certainly comes on wicked and rebellious sinners, they
tremble not when Gods wrath and his judgments are denounced. If one should now
run through the streets, and cry, fire, fire, our hearts would be suddenly
smitten with fear; but let the Minister of God, stand, and cry, fire, fire,
yea the fire of hell, which is kindled by the breath of the Lord, as the
Prophet speaks, Isai 30.33. yet many of our hearts are nothing moved, and
that is a plain evidence, we believe not that Gods wrath abides for such
sins? Well, let us never rest till we be fully persuaded of this, that so
we may seek speedily to make our peace with the Lord, and withal think on
the greatness of his wrath: Nahum says 1.6. before the face of his wrath none
can abide, the mountains tremble, the waters flee away, the rocks are rent in
sunder, at the blast, or breath of his displeasure, and shall we be able to
endure it? Think on it, and the Lord make us wise to believe these things.

Now, from this word (comes) wherein the Apostle does, as it it were, put a
person on the wrath of God, and as it were, legs, and feet to walk upon, I
might show that who by custom of sin, and hardness of heart are so blockish
that they see not Gods wrath in it self, shall one day without repentance so
sensibly see, and feel the same, as if it were a person doing execution on
them, but that may be referd to the doctrine of the certainty of Gods wrath
already delivered: I pass by it and come to speak of the persons one whom the
wrath of God comes for the sins before named, and these are the children of
disobedience (that is) as we have heard, such as are obstinate in their sins,
and will not yield to any good counsel or admonition, nor by any good means
be brought to repentance.

Observe then, that the Apostle says not, the wrath of God comes on all
whatsoever they be that are guilty of the sins before named, but he does
limit and bound his speech to the children of disobedience, the point hence
offered is this.

Only obstinacy in sin brings Gods wrath.
nor any other particular sin whatsoever: but the lying in sin, and not
repenting of it, that brings Gods wrath; when men, notwithstanding all gracious
admonitions, or fearful threatenings, or other means that can be used, lie
still in their sin, and tie sin to sin, they make a way to Gods judgment
to fall upon them, it is continuance in sin without repentance that pulles
down the wrath of God. For why? Heb. 6.6. We read Isay 1. that the Jews were
suncke deep in rebellion, they were neither moved by the Lord his benefits,
nor by his punishments to amendment, yet Verse 16 the Prophet stirs them up
to repentance, and says, Wash you, make you clean: take away the evil of
your works from before mine eyes: cease to do evil. And then verse 18. Come
now, and let us reason together, says the Lord, though your sins were as
crimson, they shall be made white as snow, though they were red like Skarlet
they shall be as wool: plainly teaching us, that there is mercy with the Lord
to true repentance for sins, how great soever they be, and therefore it is a
certain truth that not any particular sin, nor many sins, but only
continuance in sin brings Gods wrath.

Here then for the use of this, is a ground of exceeding Comfort for such as
have grace to repent of their sins.
have grace to repent of it, such as being admonished of their sin are truly
humbled for it, as David was, 2. Sa. 12. and as Iehoshaphat was, being told of
his sin by Iehu, 2. Chapter 19.2. such as knowing their sin confess, and bewail
it, turn from it, and forsake it, here is comfort for them, they are not
liable to the wrath of God for that sin; and if it be so, that after
repentance, they fall into the same again of frailty, Note.
and against their purpose, yet if they recover themselves by repentance, and
break of that sin by new, and speedy repentance, even that sin committed after
repentance, and again repented of, makes them not subject to Gods wrath;
howsoever indeed such a sin will much weaken thy comfort, and thou shall
find, thou have just cause to pray with David, Psalm. 51.12. Restore to me the
joy of thy salvation. Yet certainly take this for thy comfort, it shall never
be laid to thy condemnation; for we may not imagine, that there is less mercy
with the Lord who is the God of mercy, then he requires of us toward our
brethren, now he has enioined us, Luke 17.4. That if a brother sin against us
seven times in a day: which is not to be understood of new offenses only, but
of all whatsoever, a certain number being put for an uncertain, even all
offenses, or how often fallen into by frailty, and seven times turn again
unto us, and say, it repents me, we must forgive him, and shall the creature
excel the creator in goodness and mercy? No, no, be assured of it to thy
comfort: if seven times (that is) many times, thou sin against God by
frailty, even in the same thing; and so often with weeping eyes, and sobbing
soul fall at his feet for mercy, there is grace, mercy, and pardon with him
to true repentance; but let no man hereupon presume, and turn this comfort
into a license to sin, and wilfully heap sin upon sin in hope of future
repentance; so doing, thou do wrest, and pervert this comfort, and cast thy
self upon a dangerous point, for what know thou, whether ever thou shall
repent, or no; and take this with thee, though God have promised mercy and
forgiveness to true repentant sinners; yet he has not promised repentance to
every sinner, that every one that sins shall repent, thou find not that
in any place of the Book of God, therefore deceive not thy self, take heed
of such presumption and learn to make a right use of the doctrine of comfort
now delivered; if thou have grace to acknowledge thy known sin, and to be
truly humbled for it, and to turn from it, though it have been often
committed, yet there is mercy for thee with the Lord; yea sweet, and full of
unspeakable comfort is it, that the Lord would have his children so sure of
the pardon of their sins, though they be many, whereof he gives them
repentance, with a dislike, and true loathing of them, as he would have it an
article of their faith, so as they be not sound Christians, if they believe
not the remission of their sins, for which they are truly humbled; let not
man suck poison out of this sweetness, and hence draw liberty to sin, if he
do, he savors this doctrine not to life and salvation, but to death, and to
his

Again, is it so, that only obstinacy in sin brings Gods wrath, then it
behooves every one to take heed of obstinacy, and continuance in sin, and
above all things in the world to avoid that as the greatest judgment of God in
this life: It concerns every one to take heed of obstinacy and continuance
in sin, as the greatest judgment of God in this life.
and to this end, we are to take heed of custom in sin, for custom in
sin takes away the sense and feeling of sin, and many not obstinate in sin
at the first, yet yielding to sin, and continuing in it for a time, at length
they become obstinate and hardened; yea, we shall find it a certain truth,
Note.
that men first harden their own hearts before the Lord come to harden them:
they yield to sin, and lie in sin, and refuse to be reformed, and then the
Lord in his just judgment gives them over to sin, and to the will of the
Devil to be led of him at his will, and then they become obstinate in their
sin.

We read in the book of Exodus (and it is worth our marking) that Pharaoh
many times hardened his own heart before it be said that the Lord hardened
it, we read not that till Chap. 9.12. Therefore let every one of us be
admonished to take heed of continuing in any known sin whatsoever it be,
learn thou to be moved betimes, and often to be moved with conscience of
thy known sin, lest thou hardening thine own heart, the Lord also come to
harden it, and then thy case is most fearful, thou art then liable to the
fearful wrath of God in this life, and for ever in the life to come.

Bcfore we leave these words, one thing more is to be observed, and that is
the Phrase, or form of speech here used by the Apostle, he says not, on the
reprobate, as he might have said, for only on them comes the eternal wrath
of God: but he says, Or the children of disobedience? on such as are
disobedient and rebellious in sin, and will not by any good counsel,
admonition, or other means be drawn from sin: hence we are given to
understand thus much.

That it is a fearful thing to be wilful in sin, It is a fearful thing to
be wilful in sin.
still to in the dear children of God a refusing, and a rejecting of the
means of their good for a time, as they lying under some grievous temptation,
and despairing of Gods mercy for a time, may for a fit refuse the means of
comfort, and with Job curse the day of their birth, and wish for death, Job
3.11. Yea, the dear children of God may sometimes fall into sin, whereof
they are preadmonished, whereof they are warned before to take heed; it was
David's case, 2. Sam. 24. in numbering of the people, though he was dutifully
admonished by Ioab not to do it; yet he (pricked forward, with the pride of his
own heart) would needs in all haste have the people numbered: and so the dear
children of God may for a fit, through the violence of temptation, refuse good
counsel, and the means of their good, and may notwithstanding forewarning,
fall into sin: therefore thus the point is to be conceived of us, that
wilfulness in sin, perseverance, and going on in sin, after many
admonitions to the contrary, is most dangerous, when it is with men as the
Prophet speaks, Zachar. 7.11.12. That they refuse to hearken, and pull away
the shoulder, and stop their ears, that they should not hear, and make
their hearts as an Adamant stone etc. That is fearful, and that is more then
a probable sign of their reprobation.

Stephen says, Act. 7.51. a withstanding of the Spirit of God in the ministry
of his messengers, therefore that must needs be a sign of reprobation.

Their case is fearful who wilfully persist in sin after many admonitions to
the contrary.
may see in what fearful state they stand; have thou been often admonished of
thy drunkenness, thy whoredom, thy pride, thy swearing, thy Sabbath-breaking,
or of any other sin whatsoever? And do thou still notwithstanding such
often admonition, wilfully persevere, and continue in thy sin,; then know
thou to thy terror, that continuing of time in thy sin seals up unto thee a
fearful conclusion, it is more then probable, thou art in the state of
reprobation, and in the number of such as shall be damned, thou art a child of
disobedience, and wilful rebellion, and therefore thou art not only a child
of wrath as all are by nature, but it is more then likely, that thou shall
never be received to mercy, and that thou art a child of perdition, and art
now trotting apace toward hell, and shall one day be fuel for the fire of
hell, which is a fearful condition to be thought on, even with trembling, and
if it be well considered, it is able to make thee (if hell have not taken full
possession of thee) to bethink thy self of speedy reformation, and therefore
consider it, and let this admonition now prevail with thee to that purpose; if
it do not, certainly, it shall one day be a bill of enditement against thee,
to thy deeper condemnation, therefore think on it, and in time make use of it.

VER. 7. Wherein ye also walked once, when ye lived in them.
In this verse our Apostle uses another argument to enforce upon the
Colossians his exhortation to mortify The remembrance of our sins past, and
now left, ought to work in us continual sorrow for them, and a care more and
more to mortify the lust of the flesh.
the argument is from their former conversation, that they in former times
walked in those sins, and therefore now they ought to mortify them.

Before we come to stand on the words of this verse, consider we this
argument; In that the Apostle thus reasons, ye walked once in those sins,
therefore now you are to mortify them.

Hence we are taught.

That the remembrance of sins, wherein we heretofore lived, and now have
left, ought to profitte us, it must not be idle, but an effectual argument to
stir us up to the mortification of the flesh, it ought to work in us
continual sorrow for those sins, and a care more, and more, to kill and
mortify the lust and corruption of the flesh, Ephesians the fifth and the
eighth, says the Apostle, ye were once darkness, but are now light in the
Lord: walk as children of light. The argument there is the same that here is
used, that the remembrance of their former state, ought now to stir them up
to a greater care of holiness.

And thus ought it to be with us, and certainly, so it is withal Gods
children.

Gods children are bettered by their sins and to it ought to be with us.
they are bettered by their sins past, repented of and pardoned, the
remembrance of them makes them more thankful to God for his mercy, more
humble and lowly in themselves, more mild and equal toward others, and more
wary and circumspect over their lives, and stirs them to the mortifying of
the flesh, hereby then try thy self, if the remembrance of thy sins past
be pleasing to thee, and thou can take delight in the remembrance of them,
that is a sign of a reprobate mind, and though thou beefreed from the practice
of them, yet thou art not delivered from the power of them, they are not yet
repented of and pardoned, if thou would be sure that thy former sins are
repented of and forgiven, then labor thou for a sanctified remembrance of
them, that thou may remember them with grief and sorrow of heart, and be
bettered by the remembrance of them, even thereby be thou stirred up to
further mortification of the flesh, and to live as much time as remains in
the flesh, not after the lusts of men, but as the Apostle exhorts, 1. Pet. 4.2.
after the will of God, and that will seal up to thy conscience assurance of
the pardon of thy former sinne^.

Come we now to stand on the words of this verse, they may be referred to two
heads.

1 The first is an expressing of the former conversation of the Colossians, in
respect of the sins before named, that they once in former times walked in
those sins, wherein ye also walked once. 2 The second is, a specifying of
time, when they walked in them, (namely) when they lived in them. Wheerein is
also unfolded the course of their walking in those sins namely, a life that was
powerful in them, that when that life was powerful in them then they walked in
those sins.
I will open and unfold the sense and meaning of the words, (wherein) some
render the words thus, Interpretation.
(among whom) with relation to the last words of the verse foregoing (the
children of disobedience) but indeed it is more agreeable to the context, and
to the argument, and purpose of the Apostle, to retain this translation
(wherein) with a reference to the sins before spoken of, and so the meaning is
in which sin (ye also) that is, you Colossians now called as well as others
(walked) this word is metaphorical borrowed from passengers, or rather from
such as walk in some place for pleasure and recreation, and so the Apostles
meaning is, that they held on a course securely, and with delight in those
sins (once) that is, sometimes heretofore (when ye lived in them) herein
the Apostle has respect to that which he has often said before, that they
were dead with Christ, and so his meaning in saying (when ye lived in them)
is, when your natural corruption as a kind of life, gave power and moving
for the exercise and practice of those sins, thus then briefly conceive we
the meaning of the Apostle, in the words of this verse, as if he had said.

In which sins before named, you believing Colossians, as well a others, held
on your course securely heretofore, even when your natural corruption was a
live in you, and gave power, and moving for the exercise and practice of those
sins.

The first thing here to be marked is, that the Apostle says, that the
Colossians also walked in the sins before named, signifying, that not only
the children of disobedience, but even they also as well as others before their
calling, and conversion walked in those sins? hence then we are taught.

The conversation of Gods chosen being yet uncalled, differs not from the
conversation of the reprobate.
differs not from the conversation of the reprobate, it is as vicious as foul,
and as much defiled with sin, as the life and conversation of such as shall
be damned, Gods chosen being yet in their natural state, walk on in sin,
and please themselves in the ways of sin, as much as they that are appointed
to destruction, there is no difference between the life of the one and the
other, till it please God by the powerful work of his spirit and grace to
make a separation and difference between them, read to this purpose, Ephesians.
2.1.^.3. 1. Corinthians. 6.11. Romans 6.17.19. those places make this a clear point.

We may not judge of the future and final state of any man, by his present
condition.


On this ground then we must learn to take heed, we determine not of the
final state of any man, being as yet in his natural state and condition, we
may not be so bold as to say, such a one is a reprobate, and a castaway; the
life of Gods chosen before their calling differs not from the life of the
reprobate, therefore judge not of the future and final state of any man, by
his present condition, we may lawfully judge a natural and carnal man to be
so, and as yet to be in a fearful estate, even in the way to destruction,
but to go further then that, is to break into Gods secret council, what a
natural man may be in after times, leave that to the Lord.

But I chiefly remember this doctrine to this end, to Such as are delivered
from their natural state, are to bless God for that benefit.
as many as are effectually called, are therein infinitely bound to magnify
the mercy of the Lord, before such calling, there was no difference between
their life, and the life of the reprobate, they walkd on in the same broad way
with them, they lay wallowing and pleasing themselves in the ways of sin, and
had no more mind to any thing that is good, then the vilest miscreant that
lives in the world, and who has made a difference between thee and a
reprobate? who has taken thee out of the way to hell, and set thy feet in the
way to life and salvation? only the Lord of his goodness, and by the power of
his spirit and grace, and if thou well consider it, thou can not be
sufficiently thankful to him for so great a mercy, when therefore thou do
see others (yet uncalled) pleasing themselves in a course of sin, and pouring
out the rottenness of their own hearts and walking on the ways of sin,
think on it, and consider it, not to insult over them, but rather to pity
them, and thereby call to mind, what thou wast before the Lord wrought on
thee by his Spirit and grace, consider that thou see in them, a lively
picture of thine own former life, and meditate with thy self on this manner.

Surely, such a one was I, so lived I once as these men now do, I took as
great pleasure in my sin, as they now do in theirs, and I ran as fast
toward hell as they now run; Oh then how much am I bound to the Lord for his
mercy toward me, who of his mere mercy has turned my feet another way, and
has put a difference, and made a distinction between my life and theirs, what
shall I render to the Lord for so great a mercy? this ought to be thy
meditation in respect of thy effectual calling, when thou see others left
still in their natural state and condition.

Observe in the next place, the word here used (walked) wherein ye also
walked, says the Apostle, signifying that the Colossians before their calling,
held on a continued course in their sins, securely with pleasure, as men
walking and going in some pleasant way with delight.

Such as are in their natural condition hold on a purposed course in sin, and
that with much delight in it. Object. Answ.
they do not simply sin, for fo do the most regenerate, but they hold a
purposed course in sin, and that with pleasure, and much delight.

Happily some may say, such as are in their natural condition are dead in
sin, cap. 2.13. how then can they be said to walk in sin? is that
possible?

The answer is easy, these two things rightly conceived may well stand
together, there is no opposition between them, as there seems to be, for
natural men are said to be dead in sin in respect of goodness, because they
are so held under the power of sin, as a dead man is under death, and have no
power at all to move toward any thing that is good. But they are said to
walk in sin, in respect of sin, it self, and therein they have
liuely-hood and actiuitie, therein they have not only a power to move but do
actually move, stir and exercise all the powers of their souls, and members
of their bodies, we are therefore to hold it for a truth, that it is proper
to men in their natural condition to walk in sin, to hold on a secure
course in sin with pleasure, such as are regenerate they fall sometimes into
sin, but it is one thing to fall into sin, and another to walk in it, as
it is one thing of weakness to slip, or fall into the mire, and another of
purpose to walk in it, or to tumble in it after the manner of swine, or mad
men, such is the difference between the regenerate and unregenerate,
Difference between the regenerate and unregenerate in respect of falling into
sin.
the regenerate of frailty, and against their purpose now and then fall into
sin, but such as are in their natural condition, they hold on a continued
course in sin, they go on with full purpose in sin, and with pleasure add
sin to sin, and this the Apostle teaches plainly, Ephesians. 2.2.3. in his
description of the natural state of the Ephesians, he says, they in their
natural condition walked in sin, and then he shows how, (namely) according
to the course of this world, and after the manner of the children of
disobedience, in the lusts of their flesh, in fulfilling the will of the flesh
and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others,
and to this purpose speaks Jude, verse 18. they walk after their own ungodly
lusts: and then he shows of whom he means it, verse 19. even of such as are
fleshly, (that is mere natural men, having not the spirit, having no dram
of sanctifying grace in them, noe doubt in speculation we are well acquainted
with this same point.

Come we therefore to the use of it.

And first, this doctrine meets with that error of the That Popish error
confuted, that a natural man may prepare himself to receive grace.
we showed the folly of this conceit chap. 2.13. in that men by nature are
dead in sins, it may hence also be refuted, for how is it possible, that a
man can prepare himself to receive grace, that is, running on with full
purpose and consent of will another way, as every natural man is; it is as
possible that a violent stream should suddenly turn backward.

If a man make himself ready to receive grace, it must be by his will, now
the will of a natural man is turned from God, and can follow nothing, but that
which is evil and repugnant to Gods will, and therefore it is not possible,
that any natural man should prepare himself to receive grace.

Trial of our selves, whether we be regenerate or no.
is it proper to men in their natural condition, to walk in sin, to hold
on a course in sin; then hereby examine thy self, hereby thou may know
in what state thou stand, whether thou be regenerate, or as yet in thy
natural condition, if thou carry in thee a constant purpose not to sin, and
thy falling into sin, is with a spiritual striving against it, and being
fallen thou have care to recover thy self by speedy repentance, then comfort
thy self, thou art regenerate, the seed of God is in thee, 1. Ioh. 3.9. but on
the contrary, if thou hold on a purposed course in sin, if thou walk in it
with delight, and sin without any spiritual striving against it, and add
sin to sin with pleasure, certainly thou art in thy natural state, and
have no assurance of any of the comforts of Gods children, I say without any
spiritual striving, and I would have it observed, I mean such striving as is
between the flesh and the spirit, between corruption and grace, for there may
be a striving in a natural man, between his natural conscience, and his
appetite, lust or affection, and here we may be deceived.



he does not only in his judgment disallow, but in his heart dislike that
sin, to which he is naturally most inclined, when a man has in him, not
only a check of his conscience, but a true dislike in his heart of that sin,
which his heart before loved, liked, and was most inclined unto, when the heart
is carried against it own liking, then is there a striving between corruption
and grace, for it must needs be a supernatural power, and work of grace that
makes a man dislike, that which nature most likes; hereby then try thy
self, if thou find in thee this spiritual striving against sin, then
doubtless thou art regenerate, but if thy striving that is in thee, be only
between thy conscience, and thine appetite, lust, and affection, then
certainly thou art yet in the dregs of nature and art yet walking on in the
way to hell, and so finding thy self, use all good means to hasten out of
that fearful condition.

(When ye lived in them.)

Observe we that the Apostle says, that the Colossians walked in the sins
before named (Whom they lived in them) when their natural corruption, as a
kind of life, gave power for the practice of them: hence we plainly see.

That it is the life of our natural corruption, that gives force to walk in
sin, The life and strength of natural corruption is that which makes men
walk in sin.
when our natural corruption is lively and strong in us, then we break out
into many foul actual sins and transgressions.

I hope this is a confessed truth, and for the use of it, we must know that the
cause of all sin is in our selves, James 1.14. Every man is tempted, The
cause therefore of all sin is in our selves.
when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence. It is folly for thee to
say as some do, having run on in a course of sin a long time, and now
happily being brought to some shame or punishment for it; woe to such a man, or
such a woman that ever I knew them: if I had not fallen into their company, I
had never come to this; they might (indeed) be an occasion of thy sin, and
their sin was great in so doing, but thine own corruption caused thee to be
overcome, and the cause of thy sin rests in thy self, and if we never saw
ill example in all our life, yet our own hearts would teach us to sin; when
therefore thou do bewail thy sin wherein thou have walked, look thou go
down to the root of that, and all thy other sins, thy natural corruption,
and be humbled for that especially, as did David, Psalm. 51. When he bewailed
his adultery, and murder, verse 5. he went down to the root, and said,
Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sin has my Mother conceived me. Thus
must we do in bewailing any known actual sin, for otherwise we may
bewail our actual known sins, through self-love, fear of shame, or
punishment, or the like, and so deceive our selves therefore remember thou in
bewailing thy actual sins to go down to the cause of that, and all thy
other sins, thy natural corruption, and be chiefly humbled for that, and then
no doubt thou shall find place to true repentance, even such repentance as
goes hand in hand with true faith, apprehending the merit of Christ his death
for pardon of all thy sins.



Corruption of nature is not altogether dead in the regenerat, and why?
it is not, it receives a deadly wound at the first conversion and effectual
calling, but it still remains and brings forth fruit till death: Romans 6.12.
Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
thereof: and the Lord will have a remnant of natural corruption to be in the
most regenerate till death, that the sense of that, with grief, and desire to
be loosed from it, may put them in mind in what a miserable state they were
when it was in full force in them, and so the spiritual life they have gotten
unto them in Christ may be the sweeter, and that they may be stird up to be
more thankeful to God for the same.

VER. 8. But now put ye away even all these things, wrath, anger,
maliciousness, cursed speaking, filthy speaking, out of your mouth.
Our Apostle having exhorted the Colossians (as we have heard) to the
mortification of such sins as did properly belong to their own pleasures,
and profits, propounding that exhortation, verse 5. and urging it by two
reasons in the 6. and 7. verses. In this eight verse he comes to exhort them
to the mortifying, and putting away of such sins as did tend to the hurt of
others, and this exhortation is propounded, pressed, and amplified by the
Apostle in the 8.9.10. and 11. verse. That this 8. verse has respect to that
which went before, verse 7. it is plain by the first words of it (But now) and
the respect, and reference is of the present time, and state of the Colossians
to foregoing time, and to their former condition, whereby the Apostle takes
occasion to press on them his following exhortation (namely) thus, that once
in former times they walked in sin, but now they ought to put it away.

In this verse considered by it self, we have laid before Colossians in these
words (put ye away.)

Then secondly, the Apostle comes to particular enumeration Wrath. Anger.
Maliciousness. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking.


And one other in verse 9. (Lying) Lie not one to another, etc.

Come we to the words of this verse, and first of the exhortation generally
propounded in these words, (But now put ye away even all these things.)

Interpretation.
(But now) In these words the Apostle (as we have heard) has respect to that
which went before, and his meaning is this, but now being converted, truly
called, and wrought on by the spirit of God: (put away) The original word used
by the Apostle has many significations, it signifies sometimes to lay up,
something to be used in times following, after the manner of Apothecaries,
sometimes for a time to suspend, sometimes to abdicate, to renounce, sometimes
to put off, as we do our apparel, and so it is translated, Ephesians. 4.22.
sometimes to cast away, so rendered, Heb. 12.1. and many other significations
there be of this word, but one signification it has, that does most fitly
agree to this place, and to the purpose of the Apostle, and that is, to put
aside, or to put clean out of sight, as we use to do the bodies of dead men,
when we bury them, and put them into their graves, to this the Apostle does
here allude, when he says (put away) continuing in his similitude begun verse
5. Mortify your sins, kill them, and then he goes on, and says, put them
aside, clean out of sight, as dead bodies are when they are buried, and so his
meaning is, deal with your sins, as you use to deal with the dead bodies of
men, bury them, put them clean out of your sight, have no more to do with
them, then the living use to have with the dead: (ye also) for so runs the
text in the original (But now put away, ye also) that is, ye as well as other
true believers (all these things) Some render the words (as indeed they may)
more generally (all things) howsoever they be translated, whether all things,
or with limitation, all these things, the meaning is all sins, or all these
sins here specified. Thus then we are to conceive these words.

(But now put away. etc.) as if the Apostle had said.

But now being converted and truly called, put away clean out of sight, and
deal you with all these sins, as other true believers do, bury them, have
no more to do with them, then the living have with the dead, let them be taken
quite out of the way, let not any print, or memory of them remain amongst you.

Now here, first, we are to mark, that the Apostle urges his exhortation by
the circumstance of time, and of the condition of the Colossians now converted,
and now truly believing, that whereas before when they were in their natural
condition, they walked in sin, now being converted, and believing in Christ,
they ought to mortify, and to put away the sins, wherein before they walked;
we see then, the Apostle makes effectual calling, a ground whereon to build
his exhortation, he held the Colossians truly converted, and effectually
called, and hereupon he does exhort them to put away Such as are in their
natural condition hold on a course in sin and can do nothing else, but such
as are taken out of that condition can move themselves to do good, and to
mortify, and to put away their own sins


Hence we may gather a maine difference between such as are in their natuall
condition, and such as are taken out of it, effectually called, and truly
regenerate; the one sort walk on in sin, and can do nothing but hold on a
continued course in sin, but the other, they are in abled to stir, and to
move themselves to do that which is truly good, and to mortify, and to put
away their own sins; howsoeur, indeed, in the first act of conversion, and
regeneration men are meerelie passive not able to move, or to do any thing
tending thereunto; yet in the course of holiness, after true conversion, they
are able to move and do that which is truly good, and to avoid evil; for
true faith wrought in the heart by the spirit of God, does alter and change the
heart, and does turn a man into a new creature, and conversation, as the holy
Ghost says, Acts 15.9. Faith purifieth the heart: and the heart once purified,
the whole man is altered and changed.

A ground of trial whether we be effectually called, and have faith, or no.
but after long continuance of the use of the means of thy calling, thou art
now the same then was^ heretofore, and thou have not yet any power to
mortify, and to put away thy old sin, thou may speak of faith, calling
and conversion, but indeed thou art but an unprofitable babbler, thou do but
misconster the Scripture, that speaks of faith, and calling, and interpret it
after thine own blind reason, and foolish fancy; if thou be effectually
called, and truly regenerate, thou shall find thine heart clean changed, and
far otherwise disposed then in former times, thou shall find that thou have
power to love that which before thou could not but hate, and to delight in
that which before thou did abhor, and to hate that which before thou
could not but love; yea thou shall find thy soul set at liberty, and made
able (though not perfectly, by reason of the relics of original corruption)
yet in some measure truly to follow the will of God, and hereby try and
examine thy self.

We are in the next place to mark, that the Apostle uses this form of
speech (put away) as a further amplification of the duty of mortification, he
thought it not sufficient to say mortify your sins, make them no more able
to stir and move then a dead man, but here he goes further, and says, put
away your sins, bury them, put them clean out of sight, have no more to do
with them then the living have with the dead; from this enlargement we are
plainly taught thus much.

of sin; or more plainly thus, we must go on from one degree of
mortification to another, and never rest using means, till our sins be truly
mortified, and as it were a dead body buried, we must never rest till we be
sure that our sin is truly mortified, We must go from one degree of
mortification to another and never rest till our sin be truly mortified.
as we are sure that a man is truly dead when he is buried: hence it is,
that true believers are said to be baptized, not only into the death of
Christ, but to be buried with him, Romans 6.3.4. And this Epist. cap. 2.12. the
Apostle says, there was wrought in the Colossians by neemes of their
conjunction with Christ, a spiritual death, and also a burial with him; and
this must every true believer labor to find in himself, even such a true
mortification of sin, as that his sin, is as it were buried, and put clean
out of his sight, and that he has no more to do with it then a living body
has with the dead.

And herein many deceive themselves, Many deceive themselves in thinking they
are mortified because they abstain from so^e sin which formerly they have used.
because they abstain from some sin which they have heretofore used, yea
they think they are truly mortified, humbled, and repentant for their sins;
if (as the Lord complains Isai. 58.5:) they afflict their souls for a day,
and hang down their heads as a bull rush, etc. If when they come to the Lords
Table, they then put aside their sins for a time, though afterward they
return to their former vomit, and wallowing in the mire, as the Apostle
speaks, 2 Pet. 2 22. Thus does the Devil delude many in the world; let us
then know that it is no true repentance, to lay aside our sin for a time, and
afterward to take it up again, with as much pleasure as ever we did: they
that so think are blinded by the Devil, and they deceive their own souls,
thou art not to think that thou art truly mortified, and dead to sin,
only because thou do abstain from this, or that sin which thou have used
before, a bare abstaining from sin will not assure thee that thou art truly
mortified, therein thou may be like one in a swowne, or in a trance, that
seems to be dead, and yet is a live, and life comes again and shows it self.



Romans 12 9. where the word used signifies to hate with an extreme hatred,
even as we hate and detest hell; if thy abstaining from that sin, be with
such detestation of it, then certainly thou art mortified, yea then thou art
come to a notable degree of mortification, therein thou art like to God
himself, who not only dislikes sin, but hates and abhorres it: Proverb.
6.16. Yea, it is worthy observation, that the Lord hates not only sin, Note.
but even the member that is made the instrument of sin, as it follows,
verse. 17.18. (but that by the way) it is an infallible character and sign of
the true fear of God, if having ability to practice sin, thou do abstain
from the sin thou have heretofore used in hatred of it, because it is sin,
and displeasing to God: Prou. 8.13. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.
Hereby then try thy self in thy abstaining from sin, thou shall find this
a certain rule, it will never deceive thee.

Observe we further, that the Apostle says, (put away ye also) that is, even
ye believing Colossians, as well as other believers; the Apostle stirs up
the Colossians, to do as other true believing Christians did, to mortify, and
to put away sin, as others did that were truly called.

Hence we are put in mind of this duty.

That true Christians ought to do that which belongs Every true believer ought
to conform himself to other true believers in all things pertaining to his
holy profession.
it is the part of every true believer to be conformable to other true
believers in all things that pertain to that holy profession and calling,
there be graces common to all Christians, as they are Christians, as knowledge,
faith, hope, love, etc. and all these must be found in every true believer in
some measure, and there be duties common to all Christians, as to deny
themselves, to be dead to sin, to crucify the flesh, to show mutual love
to their brethren, and every true believer must be a doer of these in some
measure, and it is common to all Christans patiently to bear any affliction
laid upon them, for Christ and for the true profession of his Gospel, and thus
the holy Ghost, urges his exhortation: Hebr. 12.1. having gathered a cloud of
witnesses, he concludes, wherefore let us also cast away every thing that
presses down, and the sin that hangs so fast on.

Hereby I might stand to tax and reprove such as will Reproof of such as
will be held true Christians, and yet are nothing like them.
and yet are no more like true believers in their lives (then as we use to
say) an apple is like to an oyster, they will needs be like the best in hope,
they say they hope to be saved, as well as the best, and yet they differ not
in life and conversation from the worst, even from such as shall be damned. But
I desire rather to press this duty on such, as are indeed true professors of
the Gospel.

Let them consider they are not to differ one from another, A true believer
must not suffer any sin to cleave unto him, which he sees other true believers
have put away from them.
in doing or suffering things common to that holy profession, yea, they are to
take heed they suffer not any sin to cleave unto them, which they see other
true believers have put away, art thou proud and selfe-conceited, and see
others humble and lowly? art thou covetous, and see other professors out of
love with the things of this world? art thou cruel toward thy poor brethren,
and see others of tender bowels and full of mercy? oh let it shame thee and
be stird up by the example of others, that profes the gospel with thy self to
put away thy sin, suffer not any sin to cleave to the, which thou see,
other true believers have mortified, and put away from them, labor thou to be
like them in all holiness and godly conversation, set before thee the example of
such as are most godly Paul set his example before Timoth. 2.3.10. and
endeavor thou to be like them.

One thing yet remains to be noted from these words, the Apostle says (all
sins) or (all these things) the point is this.

David says, Psalm. 119.101. We must put from us all sin.
I have refrained my feet from every evil way, Herod went to far as he did
many things John taught him, but still he would keep his brothers wife, so
many men happily put away covetousness, and yet retain drunkenness, Reproof
of such as put away one sin and retain another.
or false dealing, others put away swearing, and yet keep malice and
slandering, every one almost will have his best pleasing sin, but we must
know, that one known sin is able to defile the whole life, one dead fly
marres the box of sweet ointment, Eccles. 10.1. the Devil will not much
trouble us if he hold us entangled in any one sin, that is enough to draw us
down to hell, as a little leake in a ship not stopped, is enough in time to
sink the ship, and he that makes no conscience of one sin, is guilty of
breaking the whole law, Iam. 2.10. therefore learn thou to make conscience of
every sin whatsoever dispense not with any one, but be thou careful to
mortify, and put away every sin.

Come we now to the Apostles particular enumeration, his reckoning up of the
sins, that are to be put away, tending to the hurt of others, in the words
following.

Wrath. Anger. Maliciousness. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying.
In this catalogue the Apostle reckons not up all that might have been
remembered, but only some more common sins, and such as are most of all cross
and contrary to brotherly love, the sins here reckoned up, are either Inward
Or Outward


Inward, are the three first: Wrath. Anger. Maliciousness.


And the other three are outward.

Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying.
And again, the three first are sins against the sixth commandment. And the
three other, are partly against the sixth, and partly against the ninth
commandments: of these sins as they lie in order, the three first, Wrath,
Anger, Maliciousness,
are all sins under one head, they are inward breaches of the sixth
commandment, and touching these sins. I will

First show what they are, with the greatness of them.

Secondly, the means that are to be used for the putting of them away with some
application.

And then in the third place, come to some general doctrine, offered from this
verse.

Wrath) by wrath in this place, we are to understand the first sinful motion
of the heart, Interpretation.
against another person desiring revenge or punishment stirred up by some
offense committed. When a man's heart is stirred up against another, through
injury or wrong done, or supposed to be done, to desire revenge or punishment,
then is there anger or wrath in his heart, What wrath is.
and this (anger) or (wrath) may be thus described, it is a corrupt and sinful
desire of revenge, or punishment in respect of some offense, and that we
misconceiue it not, Difference of anger and wrath twofold.
I will stand a while to make it more plain, by showing a difference of anger
and wrath.

First we must know that (Anger) is a natural affection, it was planted in our
first Parents, in the first creation, yea, it was found in Christ himself who
was without sin, Mark. 3.5. he looked round about on them ungodly, and
therefore anger is not in it self a sin, and always sinful.

Again, we must know that anger is sometimes lawful and good, yea sometimes
not only allowed, but required as Eve should have been angry with the
serpent, and Adam with her, for tempting to sin, and anger is then lawful
and good, Note
when it is rightly conceived, and directed to a right object (namely) against
sin (for as one says well) he that is not angry for sin, When anger is
good, and when it is not good.
either knows not sin (or hates it not as he ought) anger therefore is
lawful, and good when it is rightly conceived, and directed to a right object,
and that with due measure; according to the nature of the object, and this I
might show by many examples in Scripture, as of Moses, of Phineas, of Elias,
David, Nehemiah, etc. yea, thus our Savior showed himself angry with Peter,
Mat. 16.23.
when he called him Devil, and said to him, get thee behind me Satan, and by
this we may easily conceive on the contrary, what anger is corrupt and sinful,
namely, such as is rash and hastily conceived without just cause, or on every
trifling occasion, Mat. 5.22.
whereof our Savior speaks, whosoever is angry with his brother unadvisedly,
or the cause being just, and weighty, such anger as is directed amiss, as
either against the person, or against the offense only, as it is an offense to
man, as an injury, and wrong bringing hurt and damage to men, and not as an
offense to God, Daniel 3.19. And lastly, such anger as does exceed measure, and
is not according to the nature of the object, but is as great for a small
offense as for a greater, and is an excessive desire of revenge, troubling the
mind, and making it forget duty to God, and men; for holy, and good anger does
ever quicken, and stir up men to prayer, and other good duties. Moses was very
angry, Ex. 32.19. yet he prayed ver. 31.32. and good anger is ever joined with
compassion over them that have offended, and sorrow for their sin: so we read
that Christ was angry and sorry Mar. 3.5. and then does anger exceed measure
when it so troubles the mind as men are put by these duties both to God, and to
their brethren, we see then what corrupt and sinful anger is.

Now the greatness of this sin may easily appear, The greatness of this
sin.
it is reekoned up among the works of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. it is evil in it
self, and stird up by the devil, it is the murder of the heart, such murder as
the heart is able to commit; yea it is the note, and fountain of the murder of
the tongue, and hand, for it not only admits, and receives contention, and
strife, as a match receives fire, but it stirs it up, and is as the bellows
blowing the coals of contention Prou. 15.18. An angry man stirs up strife,
and of strife and contention comes murder, both of the tongue and hand, yea all
manner of evil works, Iam. 3.16. Therefore, doubtless, corrupt wrath and
anger is a great sin.

The second sin here named is as the word is translated (anger) but indeed this
word does not express the force of the original, the original word (...)
signifies, Interpretation.
a fiery anger and it differs from the former only in degree; for this hot and
fiery anger, What fiery anger is.
is only a further degree of corrupt anger, and it is an inflammation of the
heart, and the whole man, as when through anger the heart is heated, the blood
enflamed, and the whole man as it were set on fire, showing it self in
countenance, as it were by sparks of fire, slashing out of the eyes and
nostrils, this also is a great sin, The greatness of this sin.
and it must needs be so, in that it is a further degree of corrupt anger, but
consider it in the effects, and we shall find it most odious, it is hurtful
even to a man's own body many times, so enflaming the blood that it brings a
fever, yea some say, it being often and usual, it dries up and consumes the
radical moisture, and causes a consumption, but much more odious is it in the
fearful effects of it toward others it makes a man dare to speak or do he
cares not what, Note
even to break out into cursing, swearing, railing, reuiling, etc. it is (as
one says) the drunkenness of the mind, a man in time of such inflammation,
has no regard to himself or others, no not to those whom he ought to
respect, we may see it in Jacobs sons, Simeon and Leui, Genesis 34.30. in their
heat they slew the Shechemites without regard of any thing, they regarded not
their fathers state in the land, and their own in that country, that they were
but strangers, and few in number, and that extreme danger might follow, both
to their father, and to themselves fiery anger had so darkened their minds, that
reason could have no rule in them, for indeed, as one says well, reason to a
mind incensed with anger, is like a key to a lock that is nimbled, it can do
no good, yea, this fiery anger makes a man haste to dishonor God, and to wound,
and kill both himself and others, therefore without question this is a great sin

What maliciousness is.
The 3. sin here set down, is (Maliciousnes) and this also is a sin of the
same kind with the former, it is an inward breach of the sixth commandment,
and it is yet a further degree of corrupt anger, it is old and inueterate
anger, or continuing wrath, it is anger or wrath, kept close in the heart,
cloaked and covered for a time, with purpose to do hurt, and waiting for
opportunity to do mischief, this was Cains anger against his brother Abel,
Genesis 4. he lapped up closely in his bosom, a conceived wrath and displeasure
against his brother, and he covered it, and spoke fair, to him ver. 8. come
let us go into the field, and when he had him there he slew him, and this also
is a most odious and detestable sin, The greatness of this sin.
not only because it is the daughter of such mothers, as wrath and anger but
because it is a going on in sin, and a sin colored over for a time, anger
that cannot speak, is most wicked, but anger that can speak, and speak
fair, Note.
and mean ill, that is wickedness it self, and so we see what those sins
are, and the greatness of them.

Now consider we the special means, that are to be used for the mortifying
and putting away of these sins, Means serving for the mortifying of these
sins are four.
the special means are these.

First, a serious and due consideration of our own vileness and sin, for many
strive against anger and wrath, and the 1. Cor. 7.11.


The second means is a due consideration of Gods providence, David's
consideration, 2. Sam. 16.10.11. Shemei curses because the Lord has bidden
him to curse, and this is a notable means for the mortifying of the foolish
passion of anger.

The third means is, auoydance of alloccasions of unlawful keeping our selves
from the company of contentious persons, Pro. 22.24. make no frindship with an
angry man, neither go with the furious man, mistaking and misconstruing the
words and actions of others, gaming, drunkenness, to whom is strife and
quarrelling etc. Proo. 23.29.
verse. 30. even to them that tarry long at the wine, to them that go to seek
mixed wine.

The fourth means, and that most effectual, is daily invocation of Gods name,
frequent and earnest prayer to the Lord, that he of his mercy would vouchsafe,
by his spirit to mortify that corrupt and violent affection of unjust anger,
for it is only the spirit of God that must order and govern our hearts, and keep
us from rash and unjust anger, and so we see the chief means that are to be
used for the mortifying of these sins. Most men and women are unmortified in
respect of the forenamed sins.
Now if due trial and examination be made of men and women touching these
sins, it is to be feared that the most will be found such as are not mortified
in respect of them, are there not many persons that are easily provoked to
anger at every trifling occasion for the moving of a straw in comparison? do
not many direct their anger against the person, and not against the sin, and if
they be angry for the offense, is it not only as its an offense to the^selus,
not as an offense to God? let a servant neglect his duty, or do a thing cross
and untowardly whereby he brings damage to his master and presently his master
or mistress are angry with him, and mightily enraged, and they say they are
angry for the fault of their servant, but let the same servant curse or swear
break the sabbath, and then they are either nothing at all, or very little
moved, and that is a plain evidence they are angry for the offense, as it is
an offense to themselves, and not as it is a sin against God, and is the number
small of such as are incensed with anger, breaking out into cursing, swearing,
raging, and most furious behauior, and are there not many that suffer anger to
lodge in their hearts, yea, do they not cover it for a time, and when
opportunity serves, show it forth? yea, some there be, that nothing will move
to put away their conceived displeasure, no words, no deeds, no good spoken, or
done to them, can stir them one jot, they will not suffer their malice to be
overcome; such persons they are worse then profane Esau, Genesis 33.
we read that he was overcome by Jacobs kindness, and moved to lay aside
his malice, and will thou be worse then profane Esau, a man noted for
profaneness, and standing for a perpetual record, Heb. 12.16. for a profane
person? Then the conclusion will fall heavy on thee; profane Esau shall rise
up one day in judgment against thee, and condemn thee: think on it thou that
art grown old in thy malice, and wilt not be appeased; and let all those that
find themselves guilty of these sins, (Wrath, anger, Eccles. 7.11. Two motives
to stir us up to use the means in mortifying the forenamed sins.
maliciousnes) be stird up to a careful use of the means that serve for the
mortifying of them. It is said, That rash anger rests in the bosom of
fools. It is an open proclamation of folly; such as are rashly angry, are
fools in print, and that in Gods book: and consider we further these two
things.

First, wrathful anger, and malice, lying in the heart, no good duty can be
done to God, or men. Iam. 1.19. Be slow to wrath, says the Apostle, and mark
his reason, verse 20. The wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness
of God, as if he had said, in time of wrathful anger thou can do nothing
that is good, and pleasing to God. 1. Tim. 2.8. I will that men pray every
where lifting up pure hands without wrath or doubting. The Apostle there
gives us to understand, that if wrath be harbored in the heart the hands lift
up in prayer are not pure, they are defiled with blood, as it is, Isai. 1.15.
and our prayer is abominable to the Lord: and thus it is in all other parts of
Gods worship, in our hearing of the Word, in receiving the Sacraments, etc. We
can do nothing pleasing to God, and with comfort to our selves.

Secondly, consider that wrathful anger, and malice, Saul was a raging man,
and the Lord sent an evil spirit upon him. And the Apostle to his exhortation,
Ephesians. 4.16. Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, subioines, Neither
give place to the Devil. As if he had said, give place to unjust anger, suffer
it to lodge with thee, and then thou give place to the devil, he becomes thy
bedfellow, and thou art his slave; if then we would not make our selves unfit
to do any good duty, and utterly unmeet to serve God in any acceptable sort,
and if we would be loath to bring our selves in bondage to Satan, let us be
stirred up to use all good means, serving to mortify rash, unjust, anger,
fiery heat, and malice; Let us often meditate on our own vileness, and
sins, and duly consider Gods providence, that nothing comes unto us, but by
the good providence of God, and let us avoid all occasions of unjust anger, and
pray unto God that he would vouchsafe by his good spirit to order, and govern
our hearts, and to keep them from unjust anger, and then, no doubt, in time by
Gods blessing on those means used, we shall be enabled to mortify, and to put
away from us, wrath, anger, and malitiousnesse.

Come we now to speak of some general doctrine offered unto us from these
words.

And first, in that the first motion of the heart desiring

Rash anger is not a venial sin, that is venial in the Popish sense.
nor binding men to be so sorry for it, but that it may be forgiven by
knocking the breast, going into a Church, sprinkling of holy water etc. But
rash anger is a sin in it self, and in it own nature deserving eternal
death, it is ranged by Christ himself, the best interpreter of the Law, under
the sixth Commandment, as a breach of it. Matthew. 5.21. Ye have heard that it
was said to them of old, thou shall not kill, for whosouer kills, shall be
culpable of judgment: verse 22. But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with
his brother unadvisedly shall be culpable of judgment: therefore it makes
subject to the curse of God, and eternal death, according to that of the
Apostle, Galat. 3.10. Cursed is every man that continues not in all things that
are written in the Book of the Law to do them.

But the Papists think they have sufficient ground for their conceit from that
text Mat. 5.22. Whosoever shall say fool, shall be worthy to he punished with
hell fire. See, say the Papists, he says not, he that is angry with his
brother unadvisedly, is worthy to be punished with Hell fire, but in the last
place, whosoever shall call his brother fool, therefore Hell fire is only due
to him that calls his brother fool, and so rash anger deserves not
everlasting damnation.

I answer them, Jews. The naming then of Hell fire, only in the last place,
shows not a diverse kind of punishment from the rest, but a diverse degree,
that a greater degree of punishment belongs to the last sin, then to the two
former, and so that text makes nothing for upholding the opinion of the Papists.

Observe we further, that our apostle speaking of these inward sins, Wrath,
Anger, Maliciousness, he puts them down in order, as they go one beyond
another in degree, as

First, rash anger.

Secondly, hot and fiery anger.

Thirdly, maliciousness, inueterate anger, or continuing anger.

Hence only note we thus much.

Sin creeps into the heart by steps and by degrees.
it is the subtlety of Satan to convey sin into the heart by little, and
little, he makes not men malicious at the first, but by his secret unmarked
creeping into their hearts, he conueies into them, happily at the first, only
a conceit against such a person, and a misliking of him, that misliking having
once entered, then he has gotten hold, and then he makes them displeased, and
rashly angry almost with every thing, said, or done, by the party misliked;
yea shortly after to be incensed with anger, and even mad against the same
party, and in the end, they meditating, and musing on a conceived wrong done,
or supposed to be done, he makes them purpose to do a mischief, yea to take
delight in so purposing, and to think it good for them so to do; no doubt,
malicious persons may easily observe that their malice has been begotten,
brought forth, and grown to strength, by these steps.

Our duty is to check the course of Satan at the first.
not to be of an hasty spirit to be angry, not to suffer our selves suddenly,
and on every occasion to be stird up to anger, lest the Devil get within us,
and press us on to a further degree.



Ephesians. 4.26. Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath. Let it not lodge
with thee, deal in this case as a man that has drunk poison, that as he
will use means presently to cast it out, lest it spread into his bowels, and
infect all the parts of his body: so do not thou suffer rash anger to rest
in thy bosom, but use all good means with speed to be rid of it; and in
this case do as Jonathan did, 1. Sam. 20.24. depart from him, or them, with
whom thou art angry, employ thy self some other way, about some thing thou
can be most earnest, and thou shall soon cease to be angry.

Now follow the outward sins here reckoned up.

Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking, and Lying.
And of these in order, as they are laid down by the Apostle, the first is
Cursed speaking.

1 I will first show, what is meant here by Cursed speaking, and the
greatness of that sin, with some application. 2 Secondly, the means that
are to be used for the mortifying of it. 3 And then, come to some general
Doctrine.
First therefore, know that the word here translated (Cursed speaking)
signifies blasphemy, or evil speaking, 4 Interpretation.
which though it be commonly understood of speaking evil against God; yet it
signifies as well evil speaking against men, we find the word so used, 1.
Cor. 4.13. We are evil spoken off. And so is it to be taken in this place as
may appear by the sins joined with it, both going before and following
after, being all of them against men.

Now this evil speaking against men, What evil speaking is.
may thus be described, it is a word, or speech, whereby the name or
estimation of another is hurt, blemished, or obscured, or at least a word or
speech, tending to the hurt and blemish of another.

Two sorts of it.
And of this evil speaking, there be 2. sorts.

The first, is in the parties absence, and that is (backbiting) Doeg did of
David) he told Saul no more then the truth, but it was with a purpose to hurt
him, 1. Sam. 22.9.10. and therein was Doeg a backbiter, and this backbiting is
a sin against the ninth Commandment.

Note.
as when public persons, or governors use them, not in way of defamation, but
in way of just reproof: so the Apostle called the Galathians foolish, Gal. 3.1.
our Savior the two disciples (foolish) Luke 24.25. and Herod, Fox, Luke
13.32. But hard terms used by private persons, such as have no calling to
pass their judgment, and censure on others for known evil, come within
compass of cursed and evil speaking.

The greatness of this sin.
Now this sin of cursed speaking, whether it be in secret backbiting, or in
open reuiling, or railing, is without question, a very great and grievous
sin; for why? it ever issues out of a corrupt heart, it comes out from an
heart that is full of gall, and bitterness, even inueterate anger, malice, or
envy, that is the root and mother of it, it makes worthy to be punished with
hell fire, as our Savior has taught most plainly, Math. 5.22. and if we
look upon it in the effects of it toward others, we shall find it most
hateful: for hence it is that this sin of cursed speaking is compared to a
rasor that cuts most sharply, Psalm. 52.2. to the thrusting through of a sword,
Pro. 12.18 to sharp arrows shot by a mighty arm, to Juniper coals which
burn most extremely, and keep fire very long: Psalm. 120.4. And indeed,
neither rasor, nor sword, nor arrow, nor fire, piearceth so deep, or wounds so
incurable, as does bitter and cursed speaking; for besides the hurt it does to
a man's good name (whereby sometimes all his endeauours in his place and
calling, are made frustrate, or of small effect, it many times so provoke as
no small mischief comes of it, many men being better able to endure any wrong
done against their person, or goods, then against their name; yea, the children
of God can worst of all bear reproachful words, whereby wicked men seek to
disgrace them, Note.
and bring contempt on them, because their good name is ever joined with Gods
glory, and if their good name be impeached, they know so much is derogated
from his glory, and therefore it must needs be confessed, that cursed speaking
(bringing forth such foul, and fearful effects) is a great and grievous
sin.

Now I desire that this great and foul sin may be thought on, This foul
sin of cursed speaking is too common amongst men.
and that every one of us would learn to avoid it, and put it from us; for it
is two manifest, that even this sin also of cursed speaking is amongst us;
what more common then tale-bearing, whispering, and backbiting? Are there not
many whose mouths are full of bitter and venomous speeches? if they be but a
little crossed, their mouths run over with all manner of railing, and cursed
speaking, uttering such terms as are not meet to be named: surely such
persons fear not the sentence of our Savior, Matthew. 5.22. He that calls his
brother fool shall be in danger of hell fire. They many times give cross
terms (as damned rogue, dogs face, and the like,) it seems Hell fire is not
hot enough for such persons, it must be made hotter: and certainly without
Gods great mercy, his curse shall be doubled on such; yea, and are there not
some who go yet further, they breath out cursed speeches against others, and
load them with vile terms, only because they fear God, and make conscience
of their ways, even because they hear the word and read the Scripture; and
do not many beltch out most spiteful speeches against them, and say, a yongue
Saint, an old Devil, you will to heaven quick, you are full of the spirit,
the Devil is within you, with a number of like deuillish speeches, fetched from
the bottomless pit of Hell. I take no pleasure in remembering these things, I
wish they that use them took as little, and I wish also that sin of cursed
speaking, and in that height of it I Iaue spoken, were not amongst men, but it
is too evident, it is, a man cannot pass the streets, but he shall hear such
cursed speeches.

Means that serve for the putting away of this sin are three.
And therefore, now let us consider some means that serve for the putting away
of this sin; the special means serving to that purpose are these.

First we must labor for honest, and good hearts, for of

Job says (recounting his uprightness) Job 31.30. Suffer not our mouths to
sin by wishing a curse unto his soul, and as David resolved with himself,
Psalm. 39.1. I thought I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my
tongue.

And the third means (which is that whereby these two James says, 3.8. no man
can tame, it is not in the power of man to tame it, we therefore must have
recourse to the Lord, and entreat him that he would purge our hearts, and set
a watch over our mouths, that we may, speak to his glory, and the good of
men. Two motives stirring us up to a careful use of these means.
And so we see the special means that serve for the mortifying of this sin
also. Let us be stirred up to a carefulll use of them, and to that purpose
consider we these 2. things.

First, all manner of ungodly and cursed speaking, is the Iam. 3.6. and it is
an evidence, that the Devil bears sway within, and sets the tongue a work.

Secondly, consider that if thou revile the children of Peter 4.14. and will
the Lord suffer himself to be reviled in his children? no, no, assure thy
self such impiety cannot escape his punishing hand.

But say some,

I would be answered of thee, Jude has taught thee by the example of Michael:
ver. 9. Michael the Archangell, when he strove against the Devil, and disputed
about the body of Moses, durst not blame him with cursed speaking, but said,
the Lord rebuke thee, durst not Michael revile the devil, and will thou revile
thy brother? think upon it, and take heed what thou do, and for conclusion
of this, if we would not make it clear, both to our selves and others, that
we are far from being guided by the spirit of Christ, and that our hearts are
possessed of the Devil, and our tongues his instruments, if we would not
(happily) revile the spirit of God, and shoot out our arrows of bitter words
against heaven, which must needs fall on our selves and bring down the
vengeance of God upon us, let us in the fear of God, be admonished to avoid
cursed speaking let us be stirred up to be earnest with the Lord, entreating
him to purge our hearts and to tame our tongues, and to bring them into order,
that they may speak to his glory, and the good of our brethren, and though we
be smitten with the tongue of others, and reviled, yet that we may not
return rebuke for rebuke, but contrariwise, bless, knowing that we are
thereunto called, that we should be heirs of blessing, as the Apostle says,
1. Pet. 3.9. that so we may have testimony and assurance to our own souls,
that we are heirs of heaven, and are within compass of Gods blessing, and
shall be blessed of him in this life, and with everlasting blessing at his
right hand in heaven.

Bitterness in writing cannot be justified though it be in defense of Gods
cause.
Now in that this sin of cursed speaking is to be mortified, and put away from
us, being a great and grievous sin, it follows by proportion, that cursed
writing cannot be justified and defended, and that cannot but be a great
sin, if any man dip his pen in wormwood, and suffer it to drop down gall
and bitterness in his writing, yea, though a man write in defense of Gods
cause, and truth of religion against notorious heretics, though they revile
him by their pens, yet he is to commit the injury to God, and not to revile
them again, much less ought any man to do it, in defending his own private
cause by writing.

Cursing and banning of others is a foul and fearful sin and ought to be far
from all that profess Christ.
or openly be a great sin, and to be put away, then without question, much
more is cursing, banning, and imprecation used against others, a great and
grievous sin, if to revile another, and to give hard reproachful terms be
a great sin, then much greater sin is it to utter ill, wishing against him,
as many graceless persons do, as that a vengeance, or mischief may light
upon him, that must needs be a most grievous and fearful sin, and ought
to be far from all that profess Christ, and that we may see the ouglines
of this sin, know that cursing of others is an abuse, and profanation of an
holy ordinance of God? for to curse is to pray against, and prayer ought not to
be used either to fulfill our lust on such as offend us, or for the hurt of
any.

Again, by cursing men they take on them the office of God, they step up into
Gods chair of judgment.

1 For first they judge the party, when they curse worthy punishment. 2 And
they determine the punishment that shall befall him, and wish it may light upon
him 3 And further he that curses another, goes about as much as lies in him
to make the Lord partaker with him in his sin, for he being offended with the
party, in a rage and violent passion desires the Lord to power some judgment
upon him, and would have the Lord bend down to satisfy his reuengefull desire,
which is a fearful height of impiety.
Desire of revenge is wicked, but to use God in it, and as much as in thee is,
to make him a party, or an executioner of thy rage, seeking and wishing that
he may curse and plague where thou will, he being all justice, all mercy, and
all goodness it self. O what an increase, We are to consider how fearful a
sin cursing is and learn to avoid it.
(which is a thing too common in the world) yea think on it seriously, that
the cursing of others is a taking of Gods name in vain, and then remember what
is the state of such as take Gods name in vain, even fearful and damnable,
they stand guilty before the judgment seat of God, and the Lord who only does
justify and acquit his children, has said, he will not hold and account them
guiltless, and if the Lord will not acquit and discharge thee from thy sin,
who then shall be able to acquit and free thee from the damnation of hell, let
it therefore settle and sink into thy heart, what a fearful and horrible
sin it is to curse and banne, and learn to avoid it.

Come we to the next outward sin here named, namely, (filthy speaking) and
in handling of this: I will 1 First, show the sin it self, and the greatness
of it, with examination touching the same. 2 Secondly, the means that serve
for the mortifying of it. 3 And then deduce some further doctrine that will
follow upon it, that this sin is to be put away.


For the first of these, know we that this sin of filthy speaking may thus
be generally conceived, it is a word or speech uttered that beseemes not
Christian honesty, when men speak of things that may move blushing, in gross
and unseemly terms, that in general is filthy speaking.

What filthy speaking is.
But more especially, filthy speaking here intended and meant, is any obscene,
immodest, or unchaste word, or speech, the Apostle here means, such unclean
and beastly words, as are wont to proceed out of the mouths of unclean
persons, and this the Apostle calls corrupt or rotten speech, Ephesians. 4.29. and
Ephesians. 5.4. he reckons up obscenity or filthiness, among things not to be named,
and this is a sin against the seventh commandment, and the greatness of it
may easily appear to us, thus it is a breach of that commandment, not only as
a fruit of uncleanness in such as use it, but also is an entisement, and a
provocation to stir up others to uncleanness: The greatness of this sin.
and hence it is, that the Apostle in the place before cited, calls filthy
speech, corrupt or rotten speech, comparing it to a corrupt, or rotten flesh,
that not only stinketh, and has happily worms engendered in it self, but
is poisonfull and hurtful to all that come near it, and hence it is likewise,
that the mouth (as in regard of all evil speech generally) so of this
especially is compared to a perverted mouth, Pro. 4.24. having as it were the
upper lip standing where the nether lip should stand, and contrariwise; yea,
hence it is, that the mouth or throat is compared to an open sepulcher, Romans
3.13. to an open grave, breathing and steeming up most loathsome and filthy
smells, and certainly the greatness of this sin is notably expressed, in
that it is called corrupt speech, for that shows it is extremely wicked, and
sinful, the holy Ghost commonly uses that manner of speaking, to set out the
exceeding greatness and foulnes of sin, as when men before the flood were
extremely wicked, and their lives stained with most foul sins, then the
holy Ghost, Genesis 6.12. says, all flesh had corrupt his way upon the earth,
and thus the Lord speaks of his people: Zephaniah 3.7. that they corrupted
all, etc. signifying that all were exceedingly wicked, therefore filthy
speaking being rotten and corrupt speech, we may conclude that it is most
wicked and abominable, and this we are to consider, and think on, it is the
fashion of the world to make small account of this sin, yea, Reproof of such
as are guilty of this sin.
wicked persons oftentimes boast of it, and make it the matter of their sport
and merriment, and too many there be, that are delighted in ribald and filthy
speaking, yea, they make it their repast and recreation, to utter wanton
speeches, to tell filthy tales, and to sing songs and sonnets, and ballads of
love, and lightness, and most abominable filthiness; yea, I may say to many
in this respect, as Christ said to the Pharisees, in another case, Mat. 12.27.
even your children shall herein be witnesses against you, may not a man often
hear it out of the mouths of children, even filthy speeches uttered by the
mouths of children? and that is a plain evidence, that their Parents, and
others with whom they live cannot wash their hands, and clear themselves of
this sin, since then the hearts of many will tell them they are guilty of
this sin, let us think on it, and consider the greatness of it, and if we
desire to be freed from it, consider we the means that serve to that
purpose, Means serving for the mortification of this sin are three.
the special means tending to the mortifying of this sin, are in effect the
same with those, that serve for the mortifying of cursed speaking, as,

First, we are to labor for chaste hearts, that our hearts Note.
so filthy rotten speech discouers a corrupt, and rotten heart, it is but a
vain speech of some, who say, though my speech be filthy, yet my heart is
clean, we must therefore labor by an holy fear of God, by sound and true
delight in his word, and by other good means to purge the heart of filthy
lusts.

Job was never adulterer, yet made he covenant with his eyes, because he being
clean in heart, would give no occasion outwardly, so must we in respect of
this sin.



Motives to stir us up to a careful use of these means.
Now to stir us up to a careful use of these means, besides the greatness
of this sin (which no doubt is of weight to as many as fear God, to make
conscience of so great a sin) consider we what our Savior says, Matthew.
12.36. that of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account,
at the day of judgment, (that is) of every such word as brings no profit to
men, nor honor to God, though it do not directly dishonor God, or hurt men,
and if of every such word men must be accomptable at the day of judgment,
then certainly much more for filthy words, if the trisler, and vain
babbler, one that powers out words that bring no profit to himself, nor others,
shall not be able to stand before the judge of all the world at the day of
judgment, where shall the filthy speaker, whose words have offended God, and
as a pestilent breath have brought much infection, and hurt to men, be able to
appear: yea, I may safely speak, to thee that art a filthy speaker, and
do delight in filthy speaking, in the words of Christ himself, Matthew.
23.33. how will thou escape the damnation of hell, surely, without Gods
unspeakable mercy thou shall not escape it, therefore think on thy sin, and
make no tush at it, but now while thou have time be humbled for that which is
past, and be stirred up in the fear of God, to use all good means that
hereafter thou may be enabled through Gods blessing, upon the means to put
away from thee all immodest, rotten, and filthy speaking.

Now in that this sin of filthy speaking, or the speaking The acting of
filthiness as stage players do, is a most fearful sin.
we may hence gather without question, the acting of filthiness is much more a
sin, if to speak filthily be a great sin, then doubtless, far greater
sin is it to act filthiness, to represent and set it out, not only by
speech, but by gesture, and by conueyances and devices, as stage-plaies do,
for what are stage-plaies, but representations of the vices, and filthy sins
of men in the world by speech and gesture? Reproof of them who make their
children stage players.
who make or tend to make their children stage-plaiers, yea know it, that to
make thy child a stage-plaier, is to dedicate him to the Devil, and to make
him his instrument, and touching this, I will say no more then an ancient
Divine says, plaiers behavior polluteth all things, and of plays he says,
they are the feasts of Satan, and the inventions of the Devil.

Come we to the last words of this verse, (out of your mouths) though these
words may be referred both to cursed speaking, and to filthy speaking, yet (as
I take it) they have special relation to the latter of these, and therefore we
find them added by the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.29. Let no corrupt communication
proceed out of your mouth, the point hence offered is this.

Though the heart conceive filthiness yet the mouth must not utter it.
we are indeed as much as is possible to keep our hearts free from all
unclean conceits, but if they be cast in by Satan, or arise from our own
corruption, we are not to utter them with our mouths in the hearing of others.

Reproof of them who suffer their mouths to utter what filthiness soever
they conceive in their minds.
much therefore are they to blame, who belch out what filthiness soever comes
in their mind, and being told of it, plead for themselves, and say, I am a
plain fellow, I am no hypocrite, I cannot dissemble, I must needs speak what I
think, as if a man were an hypocrite that yields obedience to the word of God,
what will thou answer, when this iniunction, of the Apostle (put away filthy
speaking out of your mouths) shall be laid before thee at the day of
judgment, surely thou shall then be speechless, and have nothing to answer,
thine own conscience shall then condemn thee, therefore think on it, and
remember the hurt that comes by filthy speaking, Note.
both to thy self and others, a filthy word is no sooner out of the mouth but
it sends a stink back again to thine own heart, and makes it fowler then it
was before, and many times it does dangerously infect others, yea, sometimes
it strikes such a deep wound into the soul of another, as no Physician can
heal, but only the holy Ghost, and no medicine can cure, but the blood of
Jesus Christ, and therefore if filthy conceits arise in thine heart, there
stifle them, suffer them not to break out, and to be uttered by thy mouth,
least so thou kindle a greater fire of lust, both in thine own bosom, and in
the hearts of others, and withal a greater fire of Gods vengeance, both
against thy self and others.

VER. 9. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
his works.
In this verse our Apostle adds the third outward sin, that is to be put
away (namely) Lying) and then having ended his enumeration of the sins that
are to be put away, he goes one to press his exhortation by weight of reason
in the words following: (Seeing that ye have put off the old man with his
works) I will lay forth this argument when we come to the handling of those
words.

Now touching this sin of Lying, I will 1 First, show what it is, and the
greatness of it, with examination touching the same. 2 And secondly, the
means that are to be used for the mortification of it. 3 And then come to some
general doctrine.


First therefore, for the sin it self, know we that a lie is when a man
speaks an untruth wittingly, and willingly, What the sin of lying is.
and with a purpose to deceive; for there be three things that concur in the
making of a lie.

1 First, that the thing spoken befalse, Three things concurring in the making
of a lie.
and an untruth, that is the very matter of every lie. 2 Secondly, that he
that speaks it know it to be false, and yet notwithstanding willingly
speaks it.
And herein, we are to observe a difference between speaking an untruth and a
lie; A difference between speaking an untruth and a lie.
for a man may speak an untruth, and yet not lie, as when he speaks that
which is false, but thinking it to be true, though he err and be deceived, yet
he speaks not against his knowledge, and so he speaks not a lie.

3 And the third thing in making of a lie is, that an untruth be spoken with
intention and purpose to deceive.
And these three things ever meet together in a lie, and so a lie is a
voluntary speaking of that a man knows to be false with a mind, and purpose
to deceive; yet that we misconceiue not this point, know that in speaking some
things, one word or one thing may be put for another, and yet no lie, Note.
as it is in Metaphors, and other figurative speeches; yea sometimes a thing
supposed, or fained may be uttered, and yet no lie, as it is in the Parables of
holy Scripture, as that Judge. 9.8. of the trees conferring together; and that
2. Sam. 12. propounded by Nathan to David of a rich man that had many sheep,
and a poor man that had but one, and diverse others, yea sometimes a man may
speak something not contrary, but beside, or diverse from the truth, and yet
not lie, as when parents would insinuate to their children the hurt and danger
of some place, as of a ditch or pit, they use to tell them there is a Bear, or
a Bulbegger to keep them from that place, and that is a thing spoken not
contrary, but diverse from the truth, and it is nothing else but an expressing
of a conceived danger in other terms, in words of terror, and fear, to keep
their children from it, and this may be done without fault; for a lie is
speaking of that is false, and contrary to the truth willingly, and with an
intention to deceive, The greatness of this sin appears by 4. things.
and this is a sin against the ninth Commandment, and this may easily
appear unto us to be a great sin.

First, for that the Devil, the author of evil indifferently, John 8.44. as
if in a special, and peculiar manner, lying proceeded from the Devil.



And thirdly, lying is a great sin, in that it is not only

And it is further a plain evidence of the greatness of this sin, in that
when a man has told a lie, yet he would not seem to have told it, and why
so? Nature it self teaches him that to lie is evil, and a sinful of
infamy, yea even swaggerers, and ruffians, such as make no conscience of any
sin, yet cannot endure to be charged with a lie, they hold it so odious,
that a man that gives them the lie, he must for it receive the stabbe;
therefore doubtless, the sin of lying is most odious, and hateful both of
God and men, though but mere natural men, and yet lying is a common sin,
and though every man be loath to be taken with a lie, yet it is a rare thing
to find a man that makes conscience of a lie: what more common with men in
buying, and selling, Lying is a common sin amongst men
and trading together then the sin of lying? I fear me the most of our
hearts will tell us, we have many times this way faulted, have we not many
times said, in selling of our commodities it is good, yea very good, and no
better to be had for money, when we knew it was naught, and worth little or
nothing? Yea, to a lie, have we not sometimes added an oath? which is most
fearful, and who is it almost that has not bidden his servant to lie? as to
say, such a thing stood him in so much, when it did not? or that he was not in
such a place, when he knew to the contrary? and what more common with servants
then to do as Gehazi the servant of Elisha did, 2. King. 5.25. to cloak and
smoth over a fault with a lie, which indeed is to wound themselves by sin,
and then to seek to the Devil for a medicine, no doubt I might yet instance
in many other particulars, our own hearts will tell us, that amongst many
other sins we are guilty also of this sin of lying, and we cannot clear
our selves of so foul a sin. Two means serving for the mortifying of the
sin of lying.


Now the special means that serve for the mortifying of this sin, are these
two.

Frist, we are to labor to carry in us, not only a conscience Psalmist says,
Psalm. 15.2. that is, in sincerity, and in uprightness of heart; the Devil may
sometimes speak the truth, Note.
but never without guile, he spoke the truth to Christ, Math 4.6. when he
said, He will give his Angels charge over thee, and with their hands they shall
lift thee up, lest at any time thou should dash thy foot against a stone:
but it was guilefully delivered, a material part of the text was suppressed,
and the rest perverted, to draw him to presumption; therefore labor thou to
carry in thee, a conscience of speaking the truth, and that in truth of heart,
if thou give so much way to thine own corruption, as to speak the truth
guilefully, thou will in the end not stick to utter flat lies, and palpable
untruths.

That he hates lying words, as well in others, as he forbeares to speak them
himself; if thou favor lying in others, thou will soon come to like it in
thy self, and therefore a notable way to keep it from thee, is to hate it
both in thy self, and in others, and remember to this purpose what the holy
Ghost says. Revel. 22.15. that not only such as make lies, but such as love
them shall be shut out of the heavenly Jerusalem.

Motives stirring us up to use of these means.
Now to stir us up to a careful use of these means, and to make conscience
to put away from us this sin of lying (besides this, that the reward of a
liar is not to be believed when he speaks the truth, common experience shows
it, that one being once found in a lie is hardly after that believed) besides
this, consider we these things.

First, lying is a conformity with the Devil, nothing

Secondly, every liar in respect of his lying is a loathfull Prou. 6.16.17.
Prou. 12.22. The lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.

Last of all consider we among whom liars are rancked Revel. 21.8. they are
reckoned up with the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and Idolaters, and they must have
their portion with those their companions in the lake that burns with fire
and brimestone, if then we would not make our selves most like to the Devil,
and be marked for his children, if we would not be odious and abominable in
Gods sight, and if we would not make our selves liable to most grievous
punishment in the bottomless pit of Hell, with such as are most abominable;
then let us in the fear of God be humbled for that sin of lying that has
been committed by us heretofore, and let us ever hereafter be careful to
avoid it; let us carry in us a conscience to speak the truth, and that in
truth of heart without fraud, or guile, and let us hate lying, both in our
selves, and in others, and let our hearts be taken up with a fear of God in
his holy Commandment that forbids this sin of lying.

Come we now to such general doctrine as is offered unto us from these words,
(Lie not one to another.)

First, we are to mark that the Apostle speaks indefinitely, he says not,
use not this, or that kind of lying, but indefinitly, and lie not one to
another.

Hence we may conclude.

All kind of lying is evil and to be avoided.
Ephesians. 4.25. Cast off lying, and speak truth every man unto his neighbor:
And for better conceiving of this conclusion, we must know that there are
usually made three kinds of lies.

Lies be of 3. sorts.
1 First, a pernicious lie, which tends to the hurt of another, either in his
life, or in his goods, or in his good name. 2 Secondly, a pleasant lie made in
merriment and sport. 3 Thirdly, an officious lie, when one tells a lie to do
another good, as to deliver him from danger, or the like.
Now there is not any of these sorts of lying, but it is evil, and to be put
away from us.

Note
no more then he may commit adultery, or do any act that is simply evil for
the same purpose; no surely, a man is not to lie, for the gaining of another
man's soul; though a Captaiue under the Turk, not yet won to the faith,
might be delivered by a lie, yet in this case a man is not to lie to set him at
liberty: the rule of the Apostle Romans 3.8. stands firm, evil (that is) that
which in it own nature is evil, may never be done, what good soever may come
on it.



a bad end, and therefore some lie, as (namely) an officious lie made for a
good end, may be used.

Answer, indeed actions, or speeches civil, Augustine to this purpose, says
he, there is no fact so ill, but may be defended, if it be considered not in
it own nature, but only in the end to which it sometimes tends; that which
is most ill may sometimes have respect to a good end, but the end makes not
that good which is ill in it self.

Some may further say, of two evils the less is to be

Answer, Lot which was of this nature, Genesis 19.8 in offering his two daughters
to be abused by the filthy Sodomites, though it were for the avoiding of a
greater evil, yet it cannot be justified, and in the example propounded, a man
may avoid both lying, and the discovering of him that lies hid, for he may
either be silent, or say he knows where he is, but he will not discover him,
and this he is rather to do then to lie, or to discover him, though he do
thereby expose himself to danger through the rage of him that

It is further objected, we read that many holy men in Scripture have lied, as
Abraham, Jacob, and many others,

Answer, those lies of holy men are recorded in Scripture, not for approbation,
and for our imitation that we should do the like, but as their falls and
infirmities, and that their faults, and slidings must be warnings to us: as
Augustine says, the fall of the stronger must be a warning

Oh, but the Midwiues of Egypt saved the male children alive, Exodus 1.19. and
Rahab saved the spies, Josh. 2.5. by lying,

Answer, again, the things that they did are commended, not their manner of
doing them, that which they did was a fruit of faith, and of the fear of God,
but they failed in the manner of doing it, and their lying is not approved,
that was their sin.



Wicked shifts of Papists to defend or to extenuate the sin of lying.
it remains then still a truth, that all kind of lying is evil, and to be
put away from us. I might bend the force of this doctrine against our
adversaries the Papists, who teach, that every kind of lie used in an oath is
mortal sin, but out of an oath, they say, a pernicious lie only is mortal,
and the officious, and jesting lie, are venial sins, that is, as they say,
sins besides the Law of God, and not contrary to it, and especially I might
stand here to show the wickedness of that new trick of Equivocation, whereby
the Jesuits think it lawful to delude our Magistrates being examined by
them, with their ambiguous, and indeed lying answer, The like shift of the
Familists.
and such a trick also that unreasonable sect of the family of love has
taken up, they use so to wind away with obscure and intricate terms when they
are examined, that their heresy can hardly be found out by their confession,
but I leave the further confutation of them to others that have done it to very
good purpose, and consider we, that no kind of lying can be defended,
Reproof of such as use lying for their own advantage.
that kind of lie has no excuse or defense, which is too common in the world,
when men lie for their own profit, and for their own advantage and gain, men
commonly think that that gain is sweet, and comes easily in, that is gotten
by lying, but alas, what sweetness, or what comfort can there be in that
gain that brings Gods curse with it, will thy gain (if it were) the gaining of
the whole world, be able to counteruaile the high displeasure of God, or the
loss of his favor, together with the forfeiting of thine own salvation? Oh
think on it, and learn to make conscience of lying, though thereby thou
might gain never so much, yea, if the case so stand, that thou must either
lie or lose thy life, rather suffer thy life to be taken from thee, and that by
most cruel torments, then to lie, and so sin against God: for what will it
profit thee to prolong thy temporal life here, and hereafter to lose life
eternal, and to hazard the state of thy soul for ever? it is an excellent
speech of Augustine (says he) thou will make a lie, least thou should die,
thou both lie and die too, for while thou would shun one kind of
death which thou may defer, but can not take away; thou fallest into two,
first, dying in thy soul, and then afterward in thy body, and certainly so
it is, therefore think on it, and consider it.

Observe we in the next place, that our Apostle says not barely (lie not) put
away lying, but he adds further (lie not one to another) and it is as if he
had said, howsoever others are deceitful in their words one to another, yet in
any case do not you believing Colossians use deceit, and lying one to another,
from this amplification, we may further gather thus much.

It is most odious for one Christian to lie to another.
to lie one to another, that is a great and grievous sin, and that this is
the purpose of the Apostle, to teach this point by this addition, is clear by
his exhortation, Ephesians. 4.25. where he says, cast off lying, and does not
only amplify that by the contrary, speak every man truth, but he adds
further, that here though he does indifferent terms, unto his neighbor, and
this we find added by the Lord himself, speaking by his Prophet, Zecha. 8.16.
These are the things that ye shall do, speak ye the truth, not only speak
ye the truth, but speak ye every man the truth unto his neighbor, it is then
a clear point, that it is a great and grievous sin, for one Christian, and
for one believer to lie to another.









Answer,

The second question is this, whether it be lawful sometimes

To this I answer, it is not only lawful, Note
as any crime a man commits against himself is more heinous then the same
crime against another. Many other particular cases I might lay down wherein it
is lawful, and expedient to suppress and conceal the truth in part one from
another.

But let this suffice for answer to these two questions.

We that profess our selves Christians ought to be far from using deceit and
lying one to another.
then far be it from every one of us to use deceit and lying one to another,
we hold our selves to be true believers, and we make profession of the same
faith, and shall we be found deceitful, and liers one to another? surely then
we dishonor our profession, yea, we make it more then manifest, that we have
no fellowship with God the father of truth, nor with Christ his son, who is
truth, nor with the holy Ghost, who is the Spirit of truth, remember we the
Apostles reason, cast off lying, for ye are members one of another, true
believers are members of that body whereof Christ is the head who is truth it
self, and in whose mouth no deceit was found, Isa. 52.9. it is therefore
monstrous to be found liers under such an head, and is it less then
monstrous, and dangerous too for one member of the body to deceive another?
certainly no, if the eye should deceive the foot would it not go wrong both
with it self, and with the whole body? and so is it in the mystical body of
Christ, if one member lie to another, and deceive another.

Let us then remember that we are members one of anther, and therefore ought
to love as the members of one body, and if there be true love in us, we cannot
lie, nor deceive one another.

Come we now to that which follows in this verse (seeing that ye have put off
the old man with his works.

Our Apostle having ended his enumeration of the sins that are to be put away,
in these words he goes on to press his former exhortation, tending to
mortification, and he does here further urge the believing Colossians to
mortify, and to put away clean out of sight the sins before named, by an
argument taken from their regeneration, begun, that seeing regeneration, was
begun in them, they should go on in the same, and mortify and put away
their sins.

Now this regeneration begun is laid forth by the Apostle in the parts of it,
which are two.

The first he calls a putting off the old man laid down in this verse.

The second, a putting on of the new, ver. 10. which putting on of the new man,
is further described in the words following to the end of verse 11.

Come we to the words of this verse, wherein is expressed the first part of
regeneration or sanctification (seeing that ye have put off) the original
word is (...) having put off, signifying that the believing Colossians,
Interpretation.
had already begun to put off the old man, and this phrase or form of
speech (put off) is metaphorical, it is borrowed from vncloathing the body,
from stripping off the apparel, to signify the manner of putting away, and
abolishing of the old man, that it is after the manner of putting off
apparel, and by the old man in this place, we are to understand the
corruption of nature derived from our first Parents, which all of us have
drawn from Adam, by natural generation, it is usual in Scripture to set out
this corruption under the name of the old man, so calling it by the name of
man, because it reaches as far as any power of part, as any faculty or
ability of the soul or body of man, and then giving to it, that Epithet
(old) because it is as old even as Adam himself since his fall, and sucked
out off his loins, and because it is in us before the new man, we have it in
us from our conception and birth, we receive the new man afterward from Christ
(with his works) that is, with manifold actual transgressions proceeding
from that corruption both in heart and life, thus then briefly conceive these
words.

Seeing that ye have already begun to put away and to abolish the corruption of
nature, spread over all the powers of your souls, and parts of your bodies,
derived from the loins of your first Parents by natural generation, with
manifold actual transgressions, issuing and proceeding from them.











Now first observe we the argument here used by the Apostle, he brings an
argument from regeneration, or sanctification, begun to urge the believing
Colossians to put away wrath, anger maliciousness, and other sins before
reckned up, that seeing they had already begun to put away the corruption of
nature with the fruits of it, they should still go on: hence we are plainly
taught thus much.

Sanctification or regeneration begun must be continued.
if the work of regeneration be once begun in us, we must labor to continue
it, and daily more and more to be purged from sin, and daily more and more to
be sanctified, yea, to feel the power of the spirit daily subduing pride,
self-love, vainglory, envy, covetousness, with a number of such like evil
affections, that are deeply rooted in our nature, it is the exhortation of the
Apostle, 2. Corinthians. 7.1. that we cleanse our selves from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit, and grow up unto full holiness, in the fear of God: it
is a point no doubt well known to us in speculation, that we are to go on
from one degree of sanctification to another, from one measure of grace to
another, and therefore I forbear to enlarge the point.

Yet we have need to be put in mind of it, Motives stirring us up to find
grace growing in us
and if we go not on from one measure of grace to another, certainly grace
is not yet truly wrought in us.

Again, howsoever the gift of regeneration, the Spirit of grace can never be
utterly extinguished and lost, yet we falling away from the measure of grace
received, we therewith lose the comfort of that grace, and the feeling of that
joy we were wont to find in the same, and we cannot recover it without much
sorrow and grief of heart. Let us therefore remember the exhortation of the
holy Ghost. Revel. 22.11. he that is holy, let him be more holy, let us not
content our selves, with the beginnings of grace and holiness, but labor to
go on in holiness, expressing the same in these words, the Lord has prepared
for us to walk in, it will be a comfort to us in this life, and through Gods
mercy it shall be rewarded with eternal glory in the life to come.

Come we to the words themselves, and therein first observe that phrase and
form of speech (put off) wherein the Apostle sets down the manner of
abolishing the corruption of nature, that it is after the manner of vncloathing
the body, we had the same form of speech, chap. 2.11. whence we noted that
the corruption of nature is not a substantial thing as some have imagined, nor
a corruption of the substance of the soul, for then could not the soul be
immortal, nor Christ have taken man's nature without sin, but it is a
corruption cleaning to the faculties, powers, and affections of the soul, and
such as may be stripped off by the powerful work of the spirit of God, this
was manifested, and use made of it, only here take notice of one thing further
from this manner of speaking, in that the corruption of nature, is as a garment
in wrapping the soul as the apparel does the body.

Unregenerate persons are most odious and filthy in the sight of God.
are most odious and filthy persons in the sight of God, they appear before
him, in the vesture of filthiness and corruption, unregenerate persons though
their bodies be clad in silks and veluets, and cloth of gold, yet in their
souls, there is nothing to be seen but most loathfull filthiness, they are
such as the Lord speaks of, Ezechiel, 16.6. polluted in their own blood, and
no Lazer, though as full of sores as Job 2.7. from the soul of his foot, to
the crown of his head, is as loathsome in man's sight, as an unregenerate
person is, in respect of this natural corruption in the sight of God, for in
regard of that, the Lord cannot look on him but be offended, it carries in it
a guiltiness of Gods wrath as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 2.5. unregenerate
persons are children of wrath, they have in them the image and stamp of Satan,
so as the Lord cannot behold them but in wrath in regard of their corruption.

A ground of examination and trial of our selves in respect of the co^ruption
of nature.
whether yet our souls be clothed in the lether coat of Adam, as Luther
speaks, in the leprous and mortal garment of natural corruption, or no, if
our souls be yet clad in the filthy rags of nature, certainly, in respect of
that, we are most odious in the sight of God, howsoever our bodies are tricked
and trimmed, yet we carry about the stamp of Gods wrath in our souls, and
as at all times, this is to be thought on, so especially when we come most
near to the presence of God, as it were into his chamber of presence, as we
do when we come to the public worship of God, then we come within compass of
the beauty of his face, Psalm. 27.4. Even before the bright shining face of
the Lord, shining in his ordinances. If we were to come into the presence of an
earthly Prince, or some great man, we would do as Joseph did, Genesis 41.14. when
he was to go before Pharoh, put of our old clothes; we know we are careful
to lay aside our old apparel, when we come into the public assembly on the
Sabbath day, and not to come in our old clothes; and shall we be so careful in
respect of the clothing of our bodies, and be altogether careless in respect
of the vesture of our souls? Shall we approach near the glorious presence of
God in our old rotten rags of nature? In our natural blindness of mind,
and hardness of heatt? We may do so for a time, but certainly at length the
Lord will find us out, and say to us as it is. Matthew. 22.12. Friend, how
came thou in hither, and have not on a wedding garment. How wast thou so bold
to come in hither, so near my glorious presence in thy filthy rags? And we
shall then be speachlesse, and not have a word to answer, and we shall hear
that heavy doom, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, cast him into utter
darkness, for assuredly the Lord will be glorified in all that come near
him, Leuit. 10.3. either to their good, and comfort which thou can not look
for coming in thy corruption, and sins, or in their confusion; therefore
remember that thou labor by all good means to cleanse thine heart, and to
sanctify thy soul, and as much as possibly thou can to put off the
corruption, and filthiness of it, when thou come to compass Gods altar,
and to appear before him in the public assembly.

In the next place, observe we, the Apostle sets down the corruption of nature
under the name of the old man, and so he calls it in other places: now hence I
might stand to show the extention, and greatness of the corruption of nature,
that it is extended and spread over all the powers of the soul, and all the
parts and members of the body, and therefore called the old man, signifying that
a natural man is nothing else, but as a man compounded of corruption, and that
the corruption of nature is no light, and superficial thing: but of these
things we have spoken, Cap. 2.11. Only one thing further I will hence observe,
and that is this.

In that the corruption of nature is expressed under the name of the old man,
we are given to know,

The corruption of nature is not in us as a babe, or as a tender weak thing,
but it is strong and powerful in us.
but it is tough, and strong as a man grown in years, yea it is strong and
powerful, even in babes, and sucklings, such as yet hang at their mothers
breast, though it show not forth the strength of it till afterward, and when it
comes to exercise the force, it shows it felfe no feeble and weak thing, but
of exceeding great strength, carrying to sin with a violent course, as any
occasion is offered; yea if it be not restrained it carries to extreme
outrage in sin, and hence it is called the Law of sin, Romans 7.23. because
as a Law it does exercise power over all the powers of the soul, and parts of
the body; yea original corruption is so strong in us by nature that it takes
occasion by that which should be a means to cure it, to break out, and to
show it self more violent, as the Apostle shows in his own example Romans
7.8.13.

We must take heed we suffer not our corruption to grow to a greater strength.
for then a thousand to one we shall never be able to overcome it, and this we
do if we suffer it to continue in full strength not abated by mortification,
if thou use not the means to put off thy natural blindness of mind, but
still continue in it, thy mind will become more incapable of any good
instruction: Do not many aged persons find this in themselves? Do they not
find such a dullness of mind in them, that they sometimes utter it in plain
terms, and say, they are too old to learn, as much as to say, they are too
old to be good, their blindness is become invincible; and is it not so in
the natural hardness of the heart? Is not that much increased by continuance
in the same, by the suggestion of Satan, by ill counsel, ill company, by
custom of sin, and by the just judgment of God; so as the means of
mollifying the word, and judgments of God, become means of further hardening?
Too lamentable experience shows this to be true, and therefore betimes grapple
with that old man, thine own corruption, and with speed use the means that
serve for the mortification of it; labor to believe in Christ crucified, apply
to thy soul the word of God, the sword of the Spirit, for the cutting down of
that corruption, if thou suffer it to continue in thee, thou ioinest hands with
the Devil, and take part with thine own corruption, thy greatest enemies,
and do fortify them against thy self, a thousand to one, to the utter
overthrow of thine own soul.

We find here further added that the believing Colossians had begun to put
off, together with the old man, his works, (that is) their manifold actual
sins issuing out from their natural corruption.

Now in that actual sins are called (Works) occasion is offered to examine,
whether actual sin have a positive nature and being, or no? But that point is
more fit for the Schools, only know we thus much, that actual sin has not
a being as a creature, as a thing created of God, but only as all other
actions of men, or Angels, which have their being in the doing, and cease with
the end of doing, and are no creatures.

Again, in that the Apostle calls actual sins, (works of the old man)
occasion is given to show, that actual sin is a work not proceeding from
God as it is evil, but from our own corruption, and from the Devil, and
therefore it is here called a work of the old man, and in other places, the
work of the Devil; indeed in actual sin the motion of the body or soul is
from God, for in him we live, move, and have our being, but the euilnesse of
that motion, by disposing, and applying of it otherwise then we ought, is from
the corruption that is in us, stird up by the Devil, I will not further stand
upon these points.

We are to mark that the Apostle does conioine the putting off the old man,
and the putting off of his works, and hence we may raise this conclusion.

The abolishment of the corruption of nature, and of the fruits of it, ever go
together.
the abolishment of the corruption of nature, and the abolishment of the fruits
of that corruption (namely) actual sins issuing out from thence are
undivided companions, they ever go together, Ephesians. 4.22. Yea, look in what
measure the corruption of nature is abolished, and put away, and without doubt
the fruits of it are in like measure abolished. Hence it is, that the
abolishing of the corruption of nature, is called a crucifying of the flesh with
the sinful affections and lusts, Gal. 5.24. and a crucifying of the old man,
and a destruction of the body of sin, together with a not serving of sin,
and not giving the members as instruments unto sin, Romans 6.6.13. And hence it
is, that true believers are said to be dead to sin, the corruption of nature
being as it were dead in them, and not bringing forth the actions of sin, as
it did when it was alive, and in full force, and strength in them.

Trial whether the corruption of nature be abolished, or no? is by the fruits
of it.
and hidden, and not so easily discerned, whether it be abolished, or no? Yet
the works of it are manifest, as the Apostle says, Gal. 5.19. The works of
the flesh are manifest: his meaning is, they are manifest, not only to God,
but even to men that have the light of reason, and natural conscience;
therefore by the works of it try thy self, there is no better warrant to thy
conscience, that the old man is put off, then when thou find his works
stripped off, it is a sure token that the corruption of nature is wounded in
thee, and has received a deadly blow, when it breaks not out into those
actual sins it was wont in former times, thou having still, strength,
abilility, opportunity, and means of committing the same; yea though thy
corruption be still working in thee, as it will be till death, and sometimes
prevail in bringing forth of sin; yet it is a sure argument that it is
wounded in thee, when thou go untowardly, and like a bungler about sin,
and as the Apostle says, Romans 7.15. Do not allow but hate that thou do,
but on the contraries, if the works of the old man be found in thee, those
manifest works the Apostle reckons up, Gal. 5.19.

Adultery. Fornication. Uncleanness. Wantonness, etc. or the like, if there
be as the Apostle here speaks. Wrath. Anger. Maliciousness in thy heart.
Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying in thy mouth.
And if thou commit any sin with pleasure, certainly the old man is yet
lively in thee, and is in full force and strength in thee, and thou art yet in
the gall of bitterness, and the band of iniquity, therefore deceive not thy
self, remember that the putting off the old man, and the putting off of his
works, ever go together, put off the one, and put off the other, hold on the
works of the old man, and the old man is not put off, if thy life be defiled
with sin, certainly thy heart is not clean.

VER. 10. And have put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge, after the
image of him that created him.
Come we to the tenth verse, where the Apostle lays forth the other part of
regeneration, or sanctification, begun in the Colossians, in the first words of
it: And have put on the new.)

Interpretation.
The understanding of the former words, will lead us to the meaning of these,
for here the Apostle does still continue his Metaphorical speech begun in the
verse before, (Put on) this phrase is taken from clothing the body, from
putting on of a garment, and to put on a garment (we know) is to cover the
body with it, and to apply it to the body: so that hereby is meant that the
believing Colossians had begun to cover themselves with the new man, and as
nearly to apply him to themselves as a garment (by the new man) we are to
understand that which is contrary to the old man (namely) the image of God
renewed in true believers, as the Apostle here expounds himself in the words
following, (which is renewed) (that is) that new quality of inherent holiness
that is wrought by the Spirit of Christ in all his members, which is therefore
called, 1 First, by the name of man because it also reaches as far as any
power, or part of soul, or body. 2 And again, it is called the new man, because
we have it not by natural birth but new birth, by regeneration afterward from
Christ.


Thus then we are to conceive these words (And have put on the new) as if the
Apostle had said,

And have begun to cover, and to apply to your selves as a garment, the image
of God, even that new quality of inherent holiness, that is wrought by the
spirit of Christ in all his members, both in their souls and bodies: the
Papists would force out of this text, that the justice, A note of the Papists
wrested from this text.
or righteousness by which we stand just in the sight of God, is a very
quality and form, inherent in the soul adorning the same, and not only
Christ his righteousness imputed to true believers, this is their note on this
place, but it is most absurd, it is clean besides the purpose of the Apostle,
he here treats not at a^^ of justification, either in the sight of God, or
men, but only speaks of regeneration, or sanctification, setting that out in
the parts of it, his speech drives not at all to justification, it seems they
are driven to hard shifts when they seek to wrest this, and like places to
favor their devise.

Observe we here that the Apostle speaking of the regeneration, or
sanctification of the believing Colossians, he sets it forth in these 2.
branches.

1 A putting off the old man. 2 And a putting on of the new.
Hence we are taught thus much.

That true regeneration, True sanctification st^nds both in abolishing the
corruption of nature, and also in a renouation according to Gods image.
or sanctification stands in these two things.

1 In abolishing the power of nature in all the powers of the soul, and in all
the members of the body. 2 And also a renouation of them according to the
Image of God.
And this we may find also plainly taught by the Apostle: Ephesians. 4.22.23.24.
That ye cast off concerning the conversation in time past, the old man which
is corrupt through the deceiuable lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of the
mind, and put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and
true holiness. For indeed, these are the 2. essential parts of regeneration, or
sanctification: mortification of the natural corruption, and a vivification,
or quickening by grace; Note.
and howsoever these two may be distinguished one from the other, yet they are
never to be separated, and put asunder, if either of these two be wanting,
there is no true regeneration, or sanctification.

We must be careful to join mortification and vivification together.
and necessary duty of regeneration, or sanctification, it is not enough for
thee to put off the old man, but thou must also put on the new, it is not
sufficient to mortify the flesh, but thou must also be quickened in the
Spirit.



with thy abstaining from gross sins, or with thy harmless disposition, and
therein bless thy self, but if thou would have the comfort of true
sanctification sealed up to thine own soul, then never rest till thou find a
new quality of grace, and holiness wrought in thee, and remember the words of
the Holy Ghost, Hebrews. 12.14. Without holiness thou shall never see God to
thy comfort.

The next thing we are to mark is the phrase here used by the Apostle (put
on) whereby he does intimate unto us that inherent holiness wrought in true
believers, is as a godly garment or glorious ornament, and being as a garment
it is not essential, as some have imagined, (but that only by the way) hence
we may gather.

That such as have put on the new man, such as are Such as are clad with the
habit of inherent holiness are glorious in Gods sight.
they are seen of him apparelled with that which is indeed gracious and
pleasing in his sight, and though it be somewhat spotted by the flesh, as the
best inherent holiness is, yet it is accepted of him in his son, and that they
are thus glorious the Apostle Peter has made it most plain 1. Peter. 4, 14.
he there says, that the spirit of glory rests on them, how then should they
not be most glorious, and the Prophet Isay speaking of them says, Isay 4.5.
that upon all the glory shall be a defense) and thus also the Lord himself
speaks of his people, Isay 43.4. thou wast precious in my sight and honorable.

Now the consideration of this ought to stir us up to a special care of
inward holiness, We are to be stirred up to a special care of inward
holiness.
that so the eye of the Lord may be pleased in looking on us, and we accepted
through his son in his sight, it is the fashion of too many in the world, to
spend much time, and to take great pains in trimming up the body, yea some are
afraid of nothing more then of inward grace and holiness, because it would
cross their pride, and forbid the nice dames of this age to make idols of
their bodies, and to bestow so much time in tricking themselves, with prancking
and painting, they think not on that exhortation of the Apostle, 1. Pet. 3.4.
but let us think on it, and remember it, that is the hid man of the heart,
that is a thing much set by before God, and let us take pains for that, and
know it is not either strength of body, eloquence of tongue, sharpness of
wit, beauty of face, or any other external thing, or common gift of God, that
is, pleasing unto him unless it be sanctified, labor therefore for holiness
and sanctification, that gives an honor to all inferior gifts, and by that
through Christ thou may appear glorious, and most pleasing in the sight of
the highest Majesty, whom thou should seek to please above all the world.

Note one thing further; In that the Apostle sets out inward sanctification to
be a putting on of the new man, we may conclude.

True sanctification is found in all the powers of the soul.
it is a putting on of a perfect whole man with all his parts, and indeed if
the spirit work powerfully in us, he works on all the powers of the soul;
sanctifying grace is never effectual in one faculty, and not in another.

We are not to think our selves sanctified because we are enlightened.
and has a knowledge of the mysteries of the Gospel, when notwithstanding he
is carried away with some inordinate lust and affection. Judas was a man that
had great knowledge, no question Christ taught him many good things, and he
taught others, yet was he a man unsanctified, therefore deceive not thy self,
and remember that true sanctification is entire, even of all the powers of the
soul, and is in every part and member of the body.

Now come we to the words following (which is renewed in knowledge after the
image of him that created him.

Our Apostle having laid forth the second part of regeneration, or
sanctification begun in this life, to be a putting on of the new man in
these words, he goes on further to describe the new man, and his description
is continued to the end of the next verse.

In that part of the description of the new man that is expressed in the words
of this verse, we have these things laid before us: 1. First, the general
frame, or making of the new man, that he is a man renewed. 2. Secondly, wherein
that renouation, or new making more specially consists, namely, in knowledge.
3. And thirdly, after what form or fashion, in what manner he is renewed in
knowledge, and that is after the image of God, who is here set out to be the
creator of him, wherein is also implied what kind of renouatio^ it is, that it
is a recreation, even a new creation.


We must stand a while to open the meaning of the words (which) that is,
Interpretation.
which new man (is renewed) the Apostle here speaks of the time present,
signifying a continual action as if he had said, which is begun to be
renewed, and is daily more and more renewed, now the word both the original, and
the English word (renewed) signify (as we know) to make a thing new again, to
restore a thing antiquated and deformed to the ancient form, and beauty, and
here in the Apostle had an eye to that created holiness, that was in man
before his fall, and so his meaning is, which new man is restored to his
ancient form, and beauty which he had in the state of innocence before the
fall (in knowledge) or into knowledge, the word here translated (knowledge)
does properly signify acknowledgement, and so the Apostles meaning is into an
acknowledgement, or into an effectual knowledge of God, of his will revealed,
and of that which is to be known and acknowledged of true believers: after
the image of him that created him (that is) after the image of God, and for the
better understanding of these words, we must know that the image of God in man
generally taken, is a conformity or likeness of man to God, as Moses brings in
the Lord speaking. Genesis 1.26. Let us make man in our image according to our
likeness) and conformity, or likeness to God stands in two things.

In likeness unto him 1. In happiness. 2. In holiness.


The first of those is not here meant, but only the second: for so the
Apostle teaches plainly: Ephesians. 4.24. put on the new man, which after God
(that is) in Gods image is created in righteousness, and true holiness, so
then this is the meaning of the Apostle, that the new man is renewed in such
manner as is effectual to a conformity or likeness with God in holiness
(that created him) those words intimate thus much, that the new man is as a new
creature of God, thus then we are to conceive these words (which is renewed in
knowledge after the image of him that created him) as if the Apostle had said.

Which new man is daily restored to his ancient form and beauty even into an
acknowledgement of God, of his will revealed, and of that which is to be
known and acknowledged of every true believer, yea into a knowledge in such
manner as is effectual to a conformity or likeness with God in holiness,
which new man the Lord has framed in you as a new creature.

We are here in the first place to mark, that the Apostle in describing the
new man, says he is a man renewed, a man made new again giving us to
understand.

That the new man here spoken of (that is) the quality of inherent holiness, or
the image of God, is not now simply new, but was once made before, Inherent
holiness or Gods image now in man was in man once before and is now renewed in
him.
and was in man once before, as it was indeed in the first creation, and that
being once made, and once in man before it was lost, as it was by the fall of
man, these are things agreed upon, even between us and the Papists, though
they dissent from us in the manner of the being of Gods image in Adam, and say,
it was in him merely a supernatural gift, and we on the contrary, a natural
gift. I will not dispute that question, but rather answer another question
arising from hence, in that the image of God was once in man, but lost by the
fall of man, it may be demanded.

How far forth the image of God touching holiness, Adam.

Answer, Some shadow of Gods image is still remaining in man.
there is a remnant of knowledge in the mind of man, there is a light of
nature, and certain general motions of God, as that there is a God, and that
he is a punisher of evil doers, and certain motions of good and evil, right
and wrong, equity and truth, the Apostle says, Romans 1.19.20. that the Heathen
came to know Gods eternal power and Godhead by consideration of the creatures,
their understanding did gather by the sight of the creatures, that there was a
God, and a powerful God, there is also a remnant of Gods image in the will and
conscience of man, the Apostle says also. Romans 2.15. the Gentiles did show the
effect of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts accusing one another, or excusing, so then there
is a remainder of the image of God in man, yet that is not able to make man
holy, no not in part, it is like to a dead child, wherein happily a man may
discern the likeness of the father, yet is it but a loathsome rotten
carcass, so it is in the image of God remaining in man, it is only left as a
monument of that image that once was in man, and to leave men without excuse,
Romans 1.20.

And therefore let this be the use we make of it, let us learn that there is
in all of us by nature sufficient knowledge, There is in every man by nature
sufficient knowledge to leave him without excuse and to condemn him
though not to make holy, and to save us, yet to leave us without excuse, and
to condemn us, do not thou think it will stand for a good plea at the day of
judgment, that thou never knew letter, that which many ignorant persons now
plead for themselves, to excuse their gross and wilful ignorance, that
forsooth they are not booke-learned, will not then stand them in steed, no, no,
thou have knowledge enough within thee to leave thee inexcusable, at the day of
judgment, and then to make thy damnation just, the Lord will not then hold
thee excused for thine ignorance, there is left in thee a light of nature
sufficient to condemn thee, yea thou living in the bosom of the Church, and
under the means of further inlightning, and thou not profiting by the means
to thy illumination, and to the renouation of the image of God in thy mind in
some measure, but going on in thy blindness and ignorance, surely the more just,
and the deeper shall be thy condemnation

The next thing we are to mark is this, that the Apostle says the new man is
a man renewed in knowledge, that the new man is a man restored to his ancient
form, and beauty, first in knowledge, hence we may take up this conclusion.

Illumination of mind is the first thing that is wrought in them that are truly
renewed according to Gods image.
the spirit of God does first inlighten the mind, and indue the mind with
knowledge of God, of his will, and of all things that ought to be known: Romans
12.2. Our Apostle persuading the Romans to a transformation, and change, he
does instance in this, that is, and principally that they should be renewed in
their minds, be changed by the renewing of your mind, and so likewise Ephesians. 4.
having bidden the Ephesians cast off the old man, verse 23. he says, and be
renewed in the spirit of your minds.

The reason of this, that in our renouation, the spirit does first enlighten
the mind, is plain.

Namely this, because illumination of the mind with true knowledge of God, of
his will, and of things that ought to be known, is the beginning of all the
rest of man's holiness, and according to the measure of renewed knowledge, there
follows a measure of holiness in all the faculties of the soul, and in the
whole man.

And let this be thought on, to this purpose, Where there is no knowledge of
God nor of things needful to be known there is no true holiness.
is the first work of the spirit, in such as are renewed, certainly then where
there is not knowledge of God, and of his will revealed, and of things needful
to be known in some measure, there is no new man, no spirit, but only the old
man, and the flesh which cannot enter into Gods Kingdom, where there is no
knowledge, but blindness and ignorance, there is no dram of true holiness,
ignorant persons may say (as they use to do, and sooth up themselves, and
stand at defiance with them that shall charge them to the contrary) that they
love God, they trust in him, and they fear him, but indeed they have none of
these things in them, it is not possible that a man should love or fear God,
or have true hope and confidence in him, who knows him not in his mercy, love,
goodness, truth, power, justice, and in the rest of his attributes, these 2.
things follow close one upon another, and ever go together.

1. An ignorant mind, and 2. A sinful heart.
And certainly, a man without knowledge, is ever a man without grace, I have
warrant from the Apostle so to speak, he has coupled them together, Ephesians.
4.18. strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them,
ignorance makes men strangers from the life of God, ignorant persons have no
manner of spiritual life in them, let then the Papists magnify ignorance as a
mother of devotion, but let us know, that to be in ignorance, is a graceless
condition, and let it cause as many as find themselves in that state, to
hasten out of it, it is a fearful condition that ignorant persons are in,
do thou not yet know God, as he has made himself known in his word, art
thou not acquainted with his properties, with his actions and attributes, as
with his truth, justice, power, mercy, and the like, as they are revealed in
his word? are these things strange unto thee? certainly, then the spirit of
God has not yet begun to work in thee, thou have yet no dram of
sanctifying grace, thou art yet in thy natural state, and so under the wrath
of God, and subject to the curse of God, therefore if thou tender the good of
thine own soul, never rest till thou find thy self in some measure
enlightened, and to that end, be diligent in hearing, reading, and meditating,
in the word of God, and use all other means with care, and conscience that
serve to that purpose.



We know in part, and this may serve to settle our minds in regard of the
manifold doubts and controversies that are in the Church and may teach us not
to marvel, though men of singular wits, deep judgment, great reading (admit
that to be sanctified) do not see all truth, but have their errors, we must
remember that the spirit of God does not renew men's minds, or give knowledge
of God, and of good things perfectly in the time of this life, but so far forth
only as is needful for the good of Gods children.

Observe yet further, our Apostle says, the new man is renewed, in knowledge,
or acknowledgement, in such manner as is effectual to a conformity, or
likeness with God in holiness. Hence we are taught.

That true illumination, and sanctified knowledge cannot Sanctified knowledge
cannot be severed from further holiness.
and indeed, in the whole man, and this is clear from that place. Romans 12.2.
Be ye changed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the
good will of God, and acceptable, and perfect, (that is) approve, love, and
obey the good will of God.

And the reason of this is,

Now happily some may demand,

For answer to this, we must know,

One general, and Historical which is only a bare

The other is special, and experimental knowledge,

Many know much and yet answer not their knowledge in a measure of holiness
because their knowledge is not sanctified.
they know, but do not acknowledge the truth of Gods will revealed, they are
like hard vessels of stone, that hold sweet water, and yet are not sweetened by
it, their minds hold a fleeting knowledge of God, and of his will, but are not
thereby bettered, and indeed, many times men by their general knowledge become
much more obstinate in sin, then they that are altogether ignorant: why does
not our knowledge of Gods judgments often senee, and of his mercies continued
unto us, work in us a loathing of sin, and a love of holiness? Surely, here
is the cause our knowledge is a mere speculation, and not a feeling knowledge,
we subscribe not in our hearts to the manifest truth of Gods justice and mercy;
we must therefore labor not only to abound in knowledge, but in spiritual
sense and feeling of that we do know, as we are taught, Phil. 1.9. Taste and
see how gracious the Lord is, says David, Psalm. 348. Not only see, and
understand the goodness of God, Note.
but taste, and feel the sweetness of his mercy. Illumination not sanctified
may be in the reprobate, yea in the Devil himself; therefore let us labor
for sanctified knowledge, and let us pray to God that together with the
knowledge of his will, he will give us the stength of his grace, that our
illumination, and knowledge may be effectual, and powerful to work in our
wills, affections, and whole man, the like measure of holiness.

Gods image mage in man stands in a conformity with God in true knowledge and
holiness.
Now further, in that the Apostle does thus describe the new man, to be a man
renewed into acknowledgement, even to a conformity, and likeness with God in
holiness, we may easily see what is the likeness of God in man, wherein it
consists (namely in conformity, and likeness with God in true knowledge and
holiness. The image of God consists not in the natural substance, or
faculties of the soul, or the abilities of it, (for then wicked men have still
the image of God in them, and the Lord sending their souls to hell he condemns
his own image) but in spiritual gifts, in wisdom, and justice, in true
knowledge, holiness, and righteousness, which were in man before the fall by
creation, and now since the fall are wrought in man, even in such as are
renewed by grace, this text together with that Ephesians. 4.24. makes this a clear
point; I only note it in a word, to show the weakness of that argument of
the Papists, which they use to bring from Gods image in man, to prove it
lawful to make an image of God.

For thus they reason, The weakness of that popish argument from Gods image in
man to prove it lawful to make an image of God, discovered.
therefore we may make the image of God: a mere shift if we rightly
understand wherein the image of God consists, we shall easily see through this
argument, and discern it to be but a cavil, for that wherein man is like to
God is spiritual, and invisible, and therefore cannot be deciphered by a
visible image.

Oh, but (say they) though God the Father, or the holy Ghost cannot be
pictured, yet God the Son,

I answer

Look we yet a little further on this description, in that the Apostle calls
a renouation in knowledge, and true holiness, a renouation after the image of
God, or a renouation to a likeness with God, hereby is further discovered.

Such men as are most renewed in knowledge and true holiness, are most like to
God.
and righteousness, we must understand this of mere men; for Christ God and
man, is in more special manner the image of his father, as we have it, Cap.
1.15. He is the eternal Son of God, and so his most absolute and perfect
essential image, and in him as he is God manifested in the flesh, God
incarnate, does God manifest himself to be most wise, most just, and
merciful; therefore I thus propound the point. That such amongst men, such as
being mere men are most renewed in knowledge, and holiness, are most like to
God, and do most resemble him, and the ground of this, may be that we find.
Romans 8.29.

Psalm. 82.1. God stands in the assembly of gods. And man is the image of
God in regard of his superiority over the woman, and the whole family, 1. Cor.
11.7. Yet both that Image of God in the magistrate, and that in the husband is
but an image that is outward, it is rather, as I may say, in the garment, then
in the body; the true and most lively image of God in men in this life, is a
renouation in knowledge and holiness, and they that are most tenewed in true
knowledge and holiness, are most like to God.

And this may serve to comfort, and cheer up the hearts Comfort and
encouragement to such as are truly renewed in knowledge and holiness.
and encourage them daily more to be renewed; for doubtless they that bear
the Image of God in any measure are dear to the Lord, and the more they are
renewed according to his image, the more dear are they to him, as children
that most resemble their Father, are most dear to the Father, it is the
greatest joy and pleasure that a man can have in any worldly thing to behold
his own image in his child, and to look on his own favor, and fashions,
his own countenance, and conditions in his child: so the more a man
resembles God in holiness, the more is he beloved of God, and the more dear
to him as being so much liker to him; yea there is no comparison between Gods
delight in his children, and the delight that earthly parents take in their
children, but only for our understanding it may thus be delivered; his love
to his children, and his delight in them exceeds the love of earthly parents,
as far as God excels dust, and earth, sin, and corruption.

And hence it is, that Abraham is called the friend of God, Iam 2.23. The Lord
was delighted with him, as one familiar friend is with another; and David a man
after Gods own heart, Act. 13, 22. And the Saints at Rome beloved of God Romans
1.7. Howsoever the goodness and holiness of Gods children do not profit, Note.
or pleasure the Lord (for he stands in no need of it) yet is it pleasing to
him, and not for the merit of it, but through Christ he is delighted in the
righteousness of his children. Psalm. 147.11. And they that are most renewed
in holiness according to his image are most dear and precious in his sight,
both in life and death. Let this then comfort such as are renewed in any
measure according to Gods image, and encourage them to labor still more, and
more to be renewed.

It is most displeasing to the Lord, when such as are most renewed in true
holiness are wronged or any way abused.
then certainly it must needs be a thing most displeasing to the Lord, to
do them violence, to offer them any indignity, or any way to abuse them; for
that abuse reaches to God, whose image they bear, to abase any that carries
about the least stamp of Gods image, is no doubt a great sin, but to abuse
them, in whom there is a lively and large impression of it, in whom a man may
discern evident tokens of Gods image renewed, that is without question, a
grievous sin, and highly displeasing to the Lord. We know if a man do any
way abuse the Kings picture, he does hazard the loss of his life, and if one
offer violence to an Idolatrous image of Christ, yea of the Virgin Mary, or any
other Saint among the Papists, he exposes himself to danger of death, and
will the Lord suffer the wrong done to his Image appearing in his children to
escape unpunished? No certainly it cannot be, the Lord will one day punish
such impiety most severely, and yet it is a common thing in the world, to
offer, and to do much wrong, and many indignities to such as bear the image
of God; yea many times to reproach them even because they bear his image, and
to lay that as a reproach before them, and in that respect to cast contempt on
them, and to load them with opprobrious terms. Surely, such persons as so
do, show whose image they bear, even the image of the world, and the image of
the Devil, and we are not to marvel at their manner of dealing, 1. John 3.13.
Marvel not my brethren though the world hate you. And let them know, that they
abusing such as carry about the image of God, that abuse rests not on the
parties abused, happily poor men, or women, but it reaches to heaven, even to
the Lord whose image it is, and they wrong such as are most precious in the
sight of God, and as tender to him as the apple of his own eye, Zach. 2.8. And
will the Lord so long endure so tender a part as it were the apple of his eye
to be touched and wronged? No, no, assure thy self he will not long suffer
himself to be touched in that which is so tender, and precious to him, and
thou shall not long escape his punishing hand, think on it whosoever thou art
that do any way abuse such as are renewed in holiness according to Gods
image, and repent of that sin.

Yea, let us every one learn to esteem highly of them We are highly to
esteem such as are renewed according to Gods image.
let us hold them most dear to us, that are most dear and precious in the
sight of God; let us therein follow the example of David, Psalm. 16.3. Let all
our delight be in the Saints that are on the earth; and in such should our
delight be: for assuredly we love not the Lord, unless we love them that
bear his image, and especially such as are most renewed according to his
image, and that in special manner, ye seek to do them good, as occasion is
offered above others.

One thing yet remains to be observed in these words, the Apostle says, the
new man is created of God: hence it is most plain.

That the new man is Gods creature, he is not a thing peeced, The new man is
Gods creature, and the work of his hand alone.
(for it is proper to him to create) and we are able to bring as little help
to our renewing, as we did, or could do to our first making.

And this meets with that conceit of the Papists, who say, we may dispose, and
prepare our selves to receive Confutation of a Popish conceit.
or could have done, to create us; as absurd, and false it is to say, we can
bring any help to our recreating and renewing, as the Papists say.

Confutation of that fancy that the new man in the regenerate is a
participation of the very nature of God.
that the new man is Gods creature; some light brains there be, who say,
that the new man in the regenerate is a participation of the very nature of
God, and that such as are regenerate are pertakers of the divine essence of the
Godhead, and they are deified; so they speak blasphemously, we are to take
heed of this delusion, such as hold this conceit brag much of the Spirit,
and of illumination, but indeed they are puffed up with a spirit of giddiness,
and are deluded by the Devil, this their conceit cannot stand with the truth
of this text, that the new man is created of God, for to no creature does God
communicate his divine essence.

But happily they will object,

I answer,

They object the fullness of the Godhead dwells, chap. 2.9. and we receive of
his fullness. John 1.16. Therefore we are partakers of the divine nature to
our regeneration.

Answer. John 1. verse 14. therefore if they be not wilfully blind they may
see the weakness of that objection.

Object. Peter 1.4. the regenerate are said to be partakers of the godly nature.

Answer, (godly nature) and thereby is meant such a precious and excellent gift
of holiness, as does resemble the divine uncreated holiness of God.

That is but your guess (say they) the holy Ghost speaks

It is true,

VER. 11. Where is neither Grecian nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
Barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: but Christ is all, and in all things.
In this verse our Apostle goes on further to describe the new man, and here
he sets him out by the condition of the persons in whom the new man is found.

1 First, by showing that in such as are renewed according to Gods image:
neither nation, not outward condition is any thing, and this the Apostle does
express in diverse particulars, that where the new man is, there is neither
Grecian nor Jew, their is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
Scythian, bond nor free. 2 Secondly, by showing that in whom the new man is,
Christ is all in all, in the last words of the verse, but Christ is all, and in
all things.
Now the occasion of this speech, that where the new man is, there is neither
Grecian nor Jew, etc. was this, certain false teachers sought to put it into
the heads of the Colossians, that among such as were renewed; there was great
difference, some were better then others, and had privilege above others, as
that a Jew was better, and had privilege above the Gentile, the circumcised
above the uncircumcised, and that it was a great privilege to be a Grecian
rather then a Barbarian, or Scythian and to be a free man, rather then a
servant, hereupon the Apostle takes occasion to teach the contrary, that among
such as are renewed in true holiness there is no such matter, there is neither
Grecian, nor Jew, circumcision, nor uncircumcision etc. but Christ is all and
in all things.

Interpretation.
Come we to examine the words touching the sense and meaning of them (where)
that is, where the new man is where there is a renouation according to the
image of God, there is neither Grecian not Jew etc. his meaning is not that
among them there is a confusion of all conditions, and no difference of nation,
or outward condition, but the differences that be among men, either of nation,
or outward condition, are nothing auailable to commend them to God, or to make
them more or less pleasing in his sight, as the false teachers taught, that
such as are renewed are neither bettered toward their true holiness,
justification in the sight of God, and salvation, in that they are Jews,
circumcised or free men, nor hindered in that they are uncircumcised,
Barbarians, Scythians, or bond men, and that this is the meaning of the
Apostle, it may plainly appear by that which he ads, that Christ is all, and
in all things, for Christ is all in all to justification, and salvation, and
the meaning of those words (that Christ is all and in all things) is this, that
Christ is to all true believers, whether Grecians or Jews, etc. all
sufficient, even in all things that pertain to their justification, and
salvation, he being made to them, as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 1.30. Wisdom,
and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.

Now here for further opening of the words, two questions

First it may be demanded, why the Apostle adds to Jew

Answer, Abraham, or tribe of Judah, and so they were called Jews.

The other in that they had the seal of the covenant, circumcision, by which
they were distinguished from other people, and so called circumcision, and both
these did false teachers magnify, and therefore the Apostle does express them
both distinctly.

Again, it may bae demanded, why to Grecian the Apostle ads Barbarian and
Scythian, seeing under the name Grecian, Romans 2.9.10
is wont to be signified all the Gentiles, as appears.

(Barbarians) and among them they hold the Scythians most barbarous, the
Apostle therefore adds Barbarian and Scythian to signify that not the most
barbarous amongst the Gentiles converted and renewed in true holiness, were
less pleasing to God in respect of their rudeness and inciuility, but were as
pleasing to him as the Jews or Grecians. Thus then we are to conceive the
words of this verse, as if the Apostle had said.

Where there is renouation according to Gods image, there no difference of
nation, or natural condition, be it Grecian, Jew, Barbarian, Scythian etc.
does either help or hinder men as concerning their true holiness,
justification in Gods sight, and their salvation; but to them of what nation or
condition soever, Christ is all-sufficient even in all things that pertain to
their justification and salvation.

First let it be here observed of us, that our Apostle does not simply deny
all difference and distinction of men, in regard of nation or outward
condition, among such as are renewed according to Gods image, and that among
true Christians there is no difference nor distinction at all, in respect of
nation or outward condition; but that the differences that be amongst them are
not auailable in regard of holiness, justification and salvation; here is no
simple, but a respective denial of these differences, of Grecians, Jews, etc.
this is to be observed, that we may discern how loose and ungrounded that
conclusion is, that some would force from this, and the like places of
Scripture (namely) this.

That by this text and the like, is taken away all difference and distinction
of men among Christians, The Anabaptisticalll fancy that all difference and
distinction of men among Christians is taken away discovered.
it is the conceit of the Anabaptists, that this and the like places of
Scripture do take away the distinction of Magistrate and subject, master and
servant, and the like, and that there ought to be no such difference among
Christians, as one to be over others and one to be in subjection to another,
but indeed, it is a mere fancy, this text rightly understood, will not bear
such a conclusion, and so to gather from hence, is to contradict the plain
evidence of Scripture, in other places, Isay. 49.23. the Lord speaking of the
conversion of the Gentiles, and so of the Church under the Gospel, he says,
Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and Queens shall be thy nurses, and the
Apostle, 1. Timoth. 2.2. biddes us pray for Kings, and for all that are in
authority, yea in this very chapter, the Apostle confirms the authority of
superiors, and teaches subjection of inferiors, with the duties of both.

But say they, Galath. 3.28. the Apostle says,

Answer, The Gospel, and Christian government, and policy may well stand
together.


Observe we in the next place, that the Apostle here reckons up the most
excellent differences amongst men, as the Grecian who did excel the Gentiles
in humane wisdom, the Jew to whom as the Apostle says, Romans the 9.4.
appertained the adoption and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of
the Law, and the service of God, and the promises, circumcision, the profit
whereof was much every manner of way: To. 3.2. and outward freedom which is an
excellent thing; and he says that none of these are any thing auailable in
such as are renewed according to the image of God, to commend them to God, and
to make them more holy and pleasing to him. Hence we may easily raise this
conclusion.

No outward privilege, prerogative, or excellency is of any account in Gods
sight to make any one more holy or more pleasing to God.
it is not the greatest pre-eminence in the world, that i^ of any esteem or
worth, to commend a man in Gods sight, I might show this by many particulars to
insist in one or two, was it not a great privilege to be of Christ his kindred,
in respect of blood, no doubt it was more then to be allied to the greatest
Emperor in the world, and yet mark what our Savior says of it. Mat. 12.48.
who is my brother, and who are my brethren, as if he had said, what is that
privilege to be my kinsmen by blood? is that any thing worth to make them
more holy or pleasing to God? no, no, I tell you they are my brethren, and my
mother, that do the will of my father which is in heaven, alliance in faith is
nearer and deerer to me then that in the flesh, who ever had greater honor
then was vouchsafed to the virgin Marie, to be the mother of Christ, yet was
all this nothing to commend her to God, had she not borne Christ in her heart,
as well as she bare him in her womb, she had never been saved.

Now the reason why outward privileges are of no esteem in the sight of God,
to commend any as more holy and pleasing to him is plain, (namely) this,
because they are carnal and temporal, and the things accounted of with God,
are spiritual and eternal, even things agreeable to the nature of God.

men to God, as single life, fasting, and voluntary poverty, Confutation of the
Papists teaching that some outward callings and actions commend men to God.
that virginity and single life is a state of perfection far excelling
marriage, and in it self of such dignity as it commends the person before the
judgment seat of God, and deserves Gods grace, full remission of sins, the
kingdom of God, and life eternal, a doctrine not only blasphemous and full of
contumely, and derogation from the blood of Christ, but such as does directly
cross that often repeated (and therefore most infallible) sentence of
Scripture: that God is no accepter of persons, that he regards no outward
state, condition, or dignity in the world for what else is single life, but an
outward state, or manner of life, and therefore admit it to be most excellent,
yet of it self it cannot commend, or make any one more pleasing to God.

Again, for a second use of this point, is it so that no outward We are not to
judge of Gods favor by the outward fashion of any man's person.
deem not such a man holy or highly favored of God, because he is increased
in wealth, honored in the world, or the like, do not thou so judge of thy
self, think not highly of thy self in regard of birth, honor, wealth,
favor, or any outward excellency whatsoever, it is not any of these or the
like, that does commend thee to God, and make thee pleasing to him, thou art
indeed to praise God for any excellency or preferment he has vouchsafed unto
thee, and having assurance of Gods favor in Christ, thou may lawfully enjoy
it, for God gives to his children, together with the outward blessing, joy, in
the fruition and use of it, Eccl. 5.18.19. but yet take heed thou boast not thy
self, and lift not up thy self in that respect with God, as if that outward
good thing did make thee pleasing to God; no, no, remember it, it is not any
outward preferment whatsoever, no, not in religion, that in it self makes thee
holy and pleasing to God, it was the conceit of the people of God in ancient
time, that they were highly in Gods favor, because they had Gods Temple, and
his outward worship amongst them, Ier. 7.4. they cried out, the temple of the
Lord, the temple of the Lord, and is it not the conceit of too many in our
days? do not many bless themselves, and think themselves highly in Gods
favor, only because they have been baptized, and they enjoy the ministry of
the word, and are made partakers of the outward Sacrament? Oh deceive not thy
self whosoever thou art, these things as they are only outward privileges
which thou enioyest, and happily others want, do not make thee holy and
pleasing to God, or nearer to heaven, no thou may have and enjoy these and
perish, yea, they may be to thee seals of deeper condemnation, ever think on
it, that it is not any outward privilege, no not in religion, that can of it
self make thee pleasing to God, and therefore do not lift up thy self in
regard of the fruition of outward privileges of religion, neue rest till thou
have further assurance of Gods favor, then the enioyment, and outwatd use of
them.

Observe yet further, that the Apostle here reckons up the meanest differences
amongst men (as uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, who were most rude
bond-seruants, who were not such as amongst us serve for wages, or apprentices,
but bond slaves, which were wholly their masters, and reckoned as part of his
goods Exodus 21.21. and he says, none of these hinder such as are renewed
according to Gods image, as concerning holiness, justification in the sight of
God, and salvation: hence then we may take up

No outward want or baseness does in it self make men less holy or less
pleasing to God. Reason.
That no outward want or means whatsoever, does in it self hinder men in
respect of holiness, no baseness, either of nation, or outward condition,
does in it self make men less holy, or less pleasing to God. And this is
built on the same ground with the former conclusion.

Because no outward thing is of any account with God to make more or less
holy, and hence it is that the Apostle does cheer up such as be of meaner
condition, 1. Cor. 7.21.22. Art thou called being a servant, care not for it.
Let not that discourage thee, thou art as pleasing to God, as a freeman, For
he that is called in the Lord being a servant, is the Lords freeman. I might
add to this other places of Scripture, but no doubt we will easily yield
this to be a truth.

And the use of it is that which the Apostle teaches in the place before
cited, Such as be of poor and mean condition in the world,,, are to be
cheered up in this, that their hand condition hinders them not in spiritual
and heavenly things they being renewed according to Gods image.
then lift up thine eyes, and cheer up thine heart, with the sight of that
honor belongs to thee. I may safely tell thee, thou art as high in grace and
favor with God, as the greatest Monarch in the world. A sweet comfort for all
poor and silly souls, on whom proud rufflers look so big, as if they were
not worthy to wipe their shoes: well, care not for their contempt, comfort thy
self with this, if thou be renewed according to Gods image, thou art as high
in Gods favor, as the greatest in the world, and think on that to thy comfort.

Now, here a doubt A doubt.
is to be answered, in that no excellency, or means of outward condition is of
any account with God, to make men more or less holy, and pleasing to God: some
may doubt of this, and say, there is difference of the works of men renewed, in
regard of outward state and condition, as the work of a Minister, or
Magistrate is far more excellent then the work of a mean Artificer, and the
Lord has promised, and will crown some with a greater degree of glory in
heaven then others, Daniel 12.3. They that turn many to righteousness shall
shine as the stars for ever and ever. Therefore it may seem that even
outward states, and conditions of men, are of some account with God.

To this I answer,

Now proceed we to such other points of instruction as are hence offered unto
us; mark we further that the Apostle says, where the new man is, where
renouation is according to the image of God, there Christ is all, there Christ
is all-sufficient, as concerning acceptance with God, and justification in his
sight. I might here take occasion to show that all sufficiency to
justification in Gods sight, even to the justification of such as are renewed
in knowledge after the image of God, is only found in Christ, and that there
is not as the Papists teach, A first, justification by Christ. And a second, by
the works of the regenerate.




We may plainly see that Christ is all-sufficient to such as are renewed
according to Gods Image, such as are renewd Christ is all sufficient to them
that are renewed according to Gods image supplying to them whatsoever can be
wanting, and making them accepted in Gods sight.
if they be uncircumcised, Christ is circumcision to them; yea, a more
excellent circumcision then the Jews had; if they be Schythians, Christ is
instead of ciuility to them, and he is their perfect wisdom; if they be
servants, he is their perfect freedom; in a word, Christ is every way
sufficient to them that are sanctified, and renewed according to Gods image, to
make them accepted and pleasing to the Lord, 1. Cor. 1.30. the Apostle says,
Ye are of him, (that is) of God, and his meaning is, ye are begotten of God,
regenerate by his Spirit, and renewed, as may appear by the same phrase, 1.
John 4 4. Ye are of God, and have overcome them, for greater is he that is in
you, then he that is in the world. Understanding the Spirit of God; so then the
Apostles meaning in saying (ye are of him) is this, ye are regenerate, and
begotten anew of the Spirit of God in Christ Jesus, and then to this the
Apostle subioines who of God is made to us, even to us that are so regenerate,
and renewed; Wisdom, perfect holiness, sanctification: and redemption. Heb.
10.14. The holy Ghost says, That with one offering has he consecrated for
ever them that are sanctified) Christ has consecrated, or (as the word is)
perfected for ever them that are sanctified. A plain proof of this, that to
them that are sanctified, and renewed according to the image of God, Christ is
all sufficient, and full perfection.

Let this be laid up as a ground of excellent comfort in Comfort to such as
are truly sanctified against the feeling of great wants and imperfections in
themselves.
and they many times sigh and groan under them, but let them not be too much
dejected, let not the consideration of thy wants ouerwhelme thee, and swallow
thee up, art thou in any measure renewed according to Gods image? has the
spirit of God been powerful in thee, to the abolishment of thy corruption,
and to thy renouation in some measure renewing thee in knowledge, and true
holiness? Oh then, let not the sight of thy wants, and imperfections utterly
cast thee down; remember that thy renouation according to Gods image does give
thee assurance, that Christ is to thee all-sufficient; thou art indeed to labor,
and strive to cast off thy wants, and infirmities, and daily more and more to
be renewed in knowledge, and holiness, the more thou art renewed, the more will
be thy comfort and the greater thy assurance that Christ is to thee
all-sufficient, according to the exhortation of the Apostle, 2 Pet. 1.10. Give
diligence to make your calling, and election sure. But if thou find thy self
oppressed, and kept down with the remainder of thy corruption, that thou can
not aspire to that perfection of holiness thou desire, let not that
altogether discourage thee, and put thee clean out of heart, still strive thou
forward, and withal raise up thine heart with this comfort, that thy
perfection is in Christ, and that Christ is to thee, perfect wisdom,
holiness, and righteousness, that he is to thee every way sufficient to thy
justification, and salvation, yea that in him, and through him thy imperfect
holiness is accepted as well-pleasing to God, and shall one day be crowned
with glory.

And as this doctrine is thus to be thought on, to the comfort of such as find
themselves truly renewed according to Gods image; so on the other side, let it
be considered by such as can witness with themselves (if they deal truly)
that they are in no sort so renewed, but that still they carry about the image
of the old man, that they are still in their natural state, and condition,
they are to think on it to this purpose.

Then certainly to thee that are not so renewed, to thee that art in no
measure sanctified, is Christ as yet nothing at all to thy comfort, To such as
are in no measure sanctified Christ is as yet nothing at all to their comfort.
I say, (as yet) what he may be hereafter I leave to the Lord. But as yet thou
have no assurance that Christ is any thing to thee to thy comfort, thou art yet
as an infidel or heathen without Christ, and then mark how the Apostle sets
out thy state, Ephesians. 2.12. If thou be without Christ, Then art thou an aliant
from the common wealth of Israel, thou have no fellowship with Gods people,
Thou art a stranger from the covenants of promise, and have no hope, and art
without God in the world: and say what thou will indeed, and truth, thou have
no true hope to be saved. Wicked, and profane persons commonly bear
themselves out in their sins, with this, I am a sinner indeed, but Christ his
death is sufficient for all; it is true, Christ his death is sufficient for
all, but you must know, it is not effectual to all, but only to such as are
sanctified: the words are plain, both here, and in the place before cited,
Hebrews 10.14. He has made perfect for ever, them that are sanctified. Such
as are not renewed nor in no measure sanctified, to them Christ is nothing at
all to their comfort; therefore go not thou on blindfolded with that conceit,
that Christ his death is sufficient for all. No, no, that is but the sophistry
of the Devil, where no sanctification is, there is no assurance of
justification by Christ; remember it, and carry it home with thee, Chirst is
all-sufficient, not to every one, but to such as are renewed according to Gods
image; if thou be not so renewed thou have no part in the merit of Christ,
think on it thou profane person, whosoever thou art, and let it shake thee
out of thy carnal security, and stir thee up never to rest till thou find thy
self in some measure renewed, and sanctified.

Some do gather from hence, in that Christ is all in all, that they that have
Christ, have all things, though they have nothing else; and they that have not
Christ, They that have Christ have all things though they nothing else, and
they that want Christ have nothing though they have all things.
have nothing though they have all things; which indeed is most true, and of
most excellent use, that they that have Christ, no misery can make them
miserable, and they find more comfort in the least morsel of bread God gives
them, then they that have kingdoms at their command, and yet want Christ; but
as I take it, this point is not so naturally gathered from hence, and therefore
I only name it, and pass by it.

Observe we further, that the Apostle says, Christ is all, and in all things
(that is) as we expounded it to all true believers, he is all-sufficient to
all true believers, whether they be Graecians, or Jews, etc. of what nation or
outward estate soever they be.

Hereby, first we may see, how that text is much abused by some, 1. Tim. 2.4.
where the Apostle says, That God will all men shall be saved. Note
Is to be understood not of all particular persons on the earth, but of all
sorts and kinds of men; for the Apostle here says, that Christ is all to
all, meaning all believing Graecians, Jews, etc. to men of all Nations, and
conditions, and so he teaches how to expound that other place, That God would
all men to be saved. Yea, hereby we may see that the Church of Christ is
Catholic, it is universal spread over all the world, it is not to be drawn
from the fellowship of all nations, to one city of Rome, or a piece of Europe,
as it is by the Papists, or as once it was by the Donatists, to a part of
Aphrica. But on these things I will not stand, the point more profitable hence
offered is this.

In that the Apostle says, Christ is all to all, even to all believers renewed
according to Gods Image whatsoever they be.

Hence we may gather thus much.

The most holy have need of Christ.
even such as are most renewed in knowledge, and holiness stand in need of
Christ his righteousness, to make them and their best works, accepted of the
Lord.

The reason David prayed, Psalm. 119.76. That Gods mercy might comfort him
according to his promise. He durst not stand to the rigor of his justice, but
he fled to his mercy: and Job says, Job 9.3. If man, meaning a man that is
holy, or at least, thinks himself so, disputes with God, he cannot answer him
one thing for a thousand. These and many other places of Scripture, make this a
clear point, that the most holy have need of Christ, to make them and their
works accepted of the Lord, Christ is all-sufficient to the most renewed.

And let such as are in the greatest measure renewed, remember that though they
be never so holy, yet they stand in need of the righteousness of Christ,
Such as are in the greatest measure renewed according to Gods image, must
remember they stand in need of Christ his righteousness.
and take heed of that hellish pride of the Papists, Pelagians, and Familists,
who dream of perfection in this life.

Again, is it so, that even such as are most holy, have need of Christ. Oh
then, how great need of Christ have others, who are not renewed, who have no
manner of holiness in them, certainly they stand in exceeding great need of
Christ, and yet commonly they have least apprehension, Such as have no
holiness at all stand in exceeding great need of Christ, and yet commonly they
feel not their want.
Many will confess that without Christ all are miserable, yet few feel
themselves to stand in such need of Christ as they do: a plain evidence
hereof it is, that thousands bless themselves in a conceit of their own
goodness, that they are honest men, or women, they never bare malice to any,
they ever dealt truly with all, and never did wrong to any: these indeed, are
good things, but herein many applaud themselves exceedingly, and their own
hearts tell them, they are righteous, and have no need of Christ.

Oh will some say, our selves to be sinners, and therefore we acknowledge we
have need of Christ.

I answer

Now, what is this, I beseech you, but to say in our hearts, though with our
mouths we confess, that we are sinners, yet in our hearts to say, we have no
need of Christ.

Let us therefore labor to cast out of our hearts this wicked thought, labor
thou to feel thy self to stand in such great need of Christ, as thou do,
in respect of the greatness of thy sins, and empty thy self of all conceit
of goodness in thy self, and remember that the most renewed according to Gods
image, have need of Christ, and so become even nothing in thy self, that thou
may be all in Christ Jesus, and that Christ may be all in all in thee.

VER. 12. Now therefore as the Elect of God, holy, and beloved; put on tender
mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering.
Our Apostle having ended his exhortation to mortification, and putting away of
sin, which exhortation was begun, verse. 5. and continued hitherto: In this
verse he comes to exhort the Colossians to the putting on, and taking to
themselves certain particular virtues, and he holds on his exhortation here
begun to the end of verse 15. and it may thus be branched out, in regard of
the virtues whereunto the Apostle exhorts.

1 They are either such as he exhorts unto simply, verse 12.13. 2 Or by
comparison, verse 14.15. 1 And again, the first sort of virtues, he sets
down particularly in this 12. verse. 2 And then shows wherein they are to be
declared, verse 13. (namely) in forbearing one another, and forgiving one
another.
To come to the handling of this 12. verse, first of all, the note of inference
(therefore) shows that this verse has relation to something foregoing, and
indeed it has respect, to that the Apostle said, verse 10. that they had put
on the new man, and from thence, he does here further exhort them, to put on
(as it were) the parts of that new man, as if he had said, you have already
begun to put on the new man, therefore you ought to put on all the parts of
that new man, so is this verse inferred, as a conclusion on that, that they had
put on the new man, and here the Apostle reckons up certain particulars,
belonging to the new man, which they ought to put on, five in number.

1 Tender mercy. 2 Kindness. 3 Humbleness of mind. 4 Meekness. 5 Long
suffering.
Now therefore put on tender mercy etc. and this exhortation is not thus barely
propounded, but it is backed and strengthened by an argument taken from a
Decorum, in regard of their excellent estate, and that expressed in three
things, that they were.

1 Elect of God. 2 Holy. And 3 Beloved.
And therefore it was meet and convenient, that they should carry themselves
answerable to such an excellent dignity, Now therefore (says the Apostle) as
the Elect of God, holy and beloved etc. and so we see the dependence of this
verse, on that which went before, together with the general matter contained
in the same.

Interpretation.
Come we to the words of it; In the original the words run thus, put on
therefore as the Elect of God, etc. In that form of speech (put on) the
Apostle does still continue his Metaphor, taken from clothing the body,
comparing the virtues here reckoned up, to the parts of that glorious vesture
of the new man, or to goodly ornaments belonging to it (as the Elect of God.)
This form of speech (Elect of God) is something different, both in the
original and translation from that Titus 1.1. and that Romans. 8.33. and (as I
take it) it comprehends more under it, and by (Elect of God) in this place, we
are to understand not only such as were chosen of God before the world was,
even from all eternity to life and salvation, but such as were also in time, by
the preaching of the Gospel, called out and selected from the world, and
effectually called to the knowledge of Christ, and to believe in him, and to
repent of their sins, for we find (effectual vocation) sometimes thus
expressed under the name of election, ye are a chosen, or Elect generation, and
that he means thereby vocation, 1. Pet. 2, 9.
it is plain in the end of that verse, that ye should show forth the virtues
of him that has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, now
this election in time (namely) effectual vocation is here chiefly meant by
the Apostle, when he says (Elect of God) yet so also as he does comprehend
under it, eternal election, and his meaning is, when he says (Elect of God)
effectually called of God, being by him chosen to life and salvation, before
the world was, (holy and beloved) that is, sanctified by grace, and beloved of
God in Christ, thus then are these words to be conceived, as if the Apostle had
said.

Now therefore seeing you have begun to put on the new man as a garment,
still go on, and put on the particular parts, and goodly ornaments, that
appertain to that glorious vesture, even those excellent virtues of tender
mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, and long suffering, as is
fitting, and beseemes such as are effectually called of God, being by him
chosen to life and salvation before the world was, and sanctified by his grace,
and beloved of him in Christ.

Let us now descend to such points of doctrine, as are here offered to our
consideration.

And first note we the inference of this verse, on that which the Apostle had
said before, that the Colossians had put on the new man, that they having put
on the new man the Apostle here further exhorts them, to the putting on of
these particular virtues of tender mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, etc.

Hence take we notice of thus much.

That every such as are renewed in knowledge, and holiness particular duties,
of holinrsse is not needless, but very necessary even to them that are most
holy, Exho^tation to particular duties of holiness, is not needless, eeuen to
them that are most holy.
this is clear from this context, and we may further confirm it by other
places of Scripture, Hebrews the 6 and 9. the Author of that Epistle says,
We have persuaded our selves better things of you, even such things as
accompany salvation, and then verse 11.12. he does desire them, that they
should every one show the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto
the end, that they should not be sloathfull, but followers of them, which
through faith and patience inherit the promises, 2. Peter 1. the Apostle having
set before them, to whom he writ, that the power of God, had given them all
things, pertaining to life and godliness verse the third, yet verse the fifth,
he stirs them up to join one virtue to another: Therefore give all
diligence thereunto, join moreover, virtue with your faith, and with virtue,
knowledge.



They that have the greatest measure of knowledge and holiness, must be content
to b^ often stirred up to holy duties.
happily thou have as much knowledge as he that is a teacher, yea thou art a
teacher thy self, yet thy affections may be wrought on, and helped forward in
holiness, by conference with others of meaner gifts, and private persons, and
thou may be much furthered in comfort by them, as the Apostle shows in his
own example Romans. 1.12. for I long to see you, that I might be comforted
together with you, through our mutual faith, both yours and mine, and
therefore though thou do abound in knowledge and holiness, yet suffer thy
self to be stirred up to particular duties, even in private, but especially in
public, and to that end consider, howsoever thou may profit much in
knowledge and holiness, by private reading and conference, yet through the
merciful dispensation of the Lord, much more by the public ministry, and
preaching of the word, that has the promise and blessing belonging to it, and
therefore make thou conscience to attend with diligence as often as thou may,
on the public ministry of the word of Gods grace, as Peter called it, Acts
20.32. which is able to build thee further, and to give thee an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified.

Observe in the next place that the Apostle here exhorts the Colossians to
put on tender mercy, kindness, humblenes of mind, etc. as the elect of God, holy
and beloved, that is, as it becomes such as are effectually called,
sanctified, and beloved of God in Christ, here then we may plainly see.

That there is, and ought to be a Decorum proper to the True believers called,
sanctified, and beloved of God in Christ ought to carry themselves answerable
to their holy and happy estate.
there ought to be a difference between the affections and lives of true
believers, and the affections, and lives of others not yet called nor
sanctified, which point is much beaten on, and often urged in Scripture, and
especially in the Epistles of Paul, Romans the 6. and 13. says the Apostle,
Give your selves unto God, as they that are alive, from the dead, and give your
members as weapons of righteousness unto God, Ephesians. 4.1. I therefore being
prisoner in the Lord, pray you that ye walk worthy of the vocation whereunto
ye are called, and verse 17. this I say therefore, and testify in the Lord
that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in vanity of their mind,
Phil. 2.15. the Apostle would have true believers so different from others, as
that they should, as lights shine in the world, holding forth the word of
life, all which places manifest this point, that true believers ought to carry
themselves as beseems them in regard of their excellent estate, being called,
sanctified, and beloved of God in Christ, and that there should be a manifest
difference between them and others, not called, both in heart and life; and
this has not only ground in the word of God, but it is also consonant and
agreeable to reason, even reason it self may teach, that such as are taken out
from the corrupt state of the world, and advanced to the glorious liberty of
Gods children sanctified, and beloved of God should demean and carry
themselves according to so great preferment, and to such an excellent condition.

True believers effectually called and sanctified, are to remember the
excellency of their condition, and especially in time of temptation, to keep
them from falling into any known sin.
sanctified, and beloved of God in Christ, they are to remember the honor, and
dignity of that holy and happy condition, and thereby to be stirred up to carry
themselves accordingly, ever laboring to deck their souls inwardly with all the
sanctifying graces of the spirit, and to shine forth in their lives in all
holiness and godly conversation, and when they are set upon by Satan or the
world without, or by their own corruption within, enticing them to any known
sin, they are then to think on the honor of their high and holy calling,
and thus to reason with themselves, shall I that am taken out of the corrupt
ways of this world, be drawn back again to tread in the same path with
them that are going toward hell? shall I that am sanctified, make my self
like to such as are profane, and walk after their own lusts? shall I that am
beloved of God, and within compass of his special love in Christ, by yielding
to this temptation, make my self worthy to be hated of him? no, no, far be
it from me, I am called of God, and I am to walk worthy of my calling, I am
sanctified, and I am not so to defile my self, I am beloved of God in Christ,
and I will not so requite his unspeakable love to me, this ought to be the
meditation of all such as are effectually called, sanctified and beloved of God
in Christ, and let them remember that a known sin in them, as pride,
covetousness, or the like, not only wounds their own consciences, but it
brings dishonor to God, and disgrace to their holy profession, it is a
scandal to the weak, Note.
a means to keep back some, not yet called, it gives advantage to the
obstinate, and opens the mouths of the enemies to the truth, and to profane
persons, to speak evil of their holy profession, these things they ought to
think on, and so to endeavor to walk answerable to their holy calling.

Observe we further, that the Apostle ioines these three things, together.

Elect of God. Holy. And Beloved.
And he says, these three were found in the Colossians, that they were Elect
of God, holy and beloved, hence we may gather thus much.

That where Gods eternal election (for that as I showed is Whom God has from
everlasting, chosen to life and salvation, them he will in time sanctify, and
to them he will in time make known his love.
and Gods love manifested shall in time follow after, and in time they shall
meet together, whom God has elected to life and salvation before all times,
they shall in time be sanctified, and made holy, and have Gods love in time
manifested to them, even shed abroad in their hearts, Romans 5.5. for howsoever
such as are elected to life and salvation, are doubtless beloved of God before
their calling, yet that his love is secret, and not known to them, till they
be called and sanctified.

On Gods eternal election, does ever follow in time, holiness, and Gods love
manifested, and these three shall in time meet together, and this the Apostle
teaches plainly Ephesians. 1.4. says he, God has chosen us before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love. 2 Thessalonians. 2.13. he says, God has chosen you to salvation, through
sanctisication of the spirit, and the faith of truth, whereunto he called you
by our Gospel, to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

That wicked conceit, that if men be appointed, to salvation, they shall not
perish howsoever they live, overthrown
for Gods election is certain and unchangeable, and therefore what need we
endeavor to live holily, and to do any good works? Blasphemous mouth, and
Profane wretch, whosoever thou art, do thou not see how thou seuerest those
things which God has conjoined, and will have in time to be found together, in
all that shall be saved? thou must know that whom God has chosen to life and
salvation from all eternity, them he has also appointed in time to be holy,
Note.
yea, it is a certain truth Gods eternal election does work in time in all
his Elect, another election whereby they choose him to be their God, and Gods
eternal love does in time work in them another love, whereby they love God
again, 1. Ioh. 4.19. we love him, because he loved us sirst, and therefore
deceive not thy self, as God has appointed to the end (namely) life and
Comfort for such as are truly sanctified, their sanctification concludes
certainly their election and salvation.
and none come to be glorified, but such as were before elected, called,
justified, and sanctified, Romans 8.30. think on it and remember it.

Again is it so, that on Gods eternal election ever follows holiness, then
here is comfort for such as are truly sanctified, they may hence gather and
conclude, that they are in the number of Gods chosen, and such as shall be
saved, the Devil will suffer any man to say, he is one of Gods chosen, his
sins are forgiven, and he hopes to be saved; but would any man prove it,
and have such proof of it, as may silence the Devil himself standing against
it; let him then look to the holiness of his heart, and life, and if he be
able thence to infer, and conclude his election, certainly he has learned
an holy, and sound kind of reasoning, and such as will never deceive him, but
minister comfort to him at all times; and though the Devil roar, and tyrants
rage, and breath out nothing but death and destruction against him, yet this
will be his comfort, that he is one of Gods chosen, and beloved of God, and
therefore nothing can come to him to his hurt, but the Lord will turn all
their malice, and mischief intended to his own glory, and his good, which is
a sweet comfort.

What that form of speech (put on) does offer to our consideration, I have
heretofore showed; only this much further we may profitably consider in the
application of it to these particular virtues, tender mercy, kindness,
humbleness of mind, etc.

That these virtues are as goodly ornaments, and precious Jewels, wherewith we
are to beautify and adorn our souls, The goodly ornaments and precious
Jewels that do most adorn and beautify Christians.
this indeed is that clothing of broidered gold, Psalm. 55.13. that will make
thee glorious in the sight of God, his holy Angels, and all good men. As for
that tricking up of the body in newfangled attire, it makes thee but odious in
the sight of God, and all good men; yea, it makes men, and women like to thy
self scorn and contemn thee, yea point at thee, and say, there goes a proud
fool,; therefore let all thy care, thy cost, and time be spent in decking thy
soul with the rich, and precious gemmes, and Jewels, that are here reckoned
up by the Apostle.

Now touching these particulars in general, we find that they are all such
as are required in the Commandments of the second Table, as Tender mercy.
Kindness. Meekness, and Long-suffering. Are comprised under the sixth
Commandment, and Humbleness of mind: under the fifth and this is not to be
passed by without some observation.


We are to mark that the Apostle coming to exhort, to put on the particular
parts of the new man; he does thus insist on those parts of the new man, that
belong to the second Table of the Commandments, he passes by the duties of
holiness required in the first Table, (and though indeed, duties of holiness,
and righteousness do ever go together, and are to be conioined in all that
are truly sanctified, yet the Apostle here passes by the duties of holiness,
and urges the Colossians to the putting on of the duties of righteousness, to
express their renouation, and sanctification in duties of love, and mercy
toward their brethren, our lesson hence is this.

Our renouation and sanctification must appear, especially in the duties of
love and mercy toward men.
for howsoever sanctification, do chiefly consist in holiness toward God,
yet is it most of all manifested in the duties of righteousness toward men.
Hence it is that our Apostle, Gal. 5.14. says, That all the Law is fulfilled
in this: thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, his meaning is true love
of men does ever include true love of God, and he that truly loves his
neighbor, loves God also, and so is the love of our neighbor said to be the
fulfilling of the Law; and therefore it must needs be, that duties of love to
men, do most of all manifest, and make known inward sanctification, Iam.
1.27. Pure religion, and undefiled before God, even the Father, is this, to
visit the fatherless and widows, in their adversity, and for a man to keep
himself unspotted of the world.

Why, might some say, pure religion,

It is true indeed, pure religion does chiefly stand in these things, but yet
the power of it does most appear, James when he says, Pure religion, and
undefiled before God, etc.

By this we may plainly see, that those men and women Such as the Papists hold
most holy and religious discovered to have no dram of true holiness in them.
and esteem the most holy, and most religious persons in the world, and as
Angels amongst men; their Moncks, Nuns, Friars, and such like, have no dram
of true holiness, and religion in them; true holiness ought to show it self,
not only in holy duties toward God, but in duties also of love, and mercy
toward men. Now they are tied, by their order, to live apart, from all
society of men, and to spend their days in contemplation, in prayer, and
fasting forsooth, and not to have any thing to do with other men in the world,
and therefore certainly there is not any iotte of true holiness in them.

Again, by the doctrine delivered, we may see that many Such deceive
themselves who rest in the duties of Gods outward worship and happily unto the^
add harmless life, and go no further.
Do not many amongst us content themselves in hearing the word, receiving the
Sacraments, and happily they add to these an harmless life, they do no
hurt, alas, What is all this? What good do they? Where is their tender mercy,
their kindness, their meekness, their long suffering? These things are not
to be found in them; it may be they profess, and say, I have enough for me,
and mine, I will betake my self to a quiet life, I will not trouble my self
with worldly cares, and businesses, I will go to the Church, and serve God,
and it may be, they do all these things, they serve God, in the outward duties
of his worship, but still they are as covetous, and as hard hearted as ever they
were, still as fierce, and as ready to be stird up to wrath, and revenge, and
still as far off from the duties of love, and mercy, which cannot be
performed without cost, and charge, as ever before; Is this holiness? Is this
religion? Is this a service of God pleasing unto him? No, no, deceive not thy
self, true holiness, and true religion is that which shows it self, not
only in duties of holiness toward God, but in duties of righteousness also
toward men: and the true service of God is to love, and serve him in serving
of men, in doing duties of love and mercy to men. Think on it, and remember
it, and let no day pass thee without some good work of love to thy brethren,
no more then it does without prayer, and other holy duties of Gods worship.

Come we now to the paticulars here urged by the Apostle; the first is,
(Tender mercy.

Interpretation.
(Put on tender mercy) The original words are, bowels of mercy, which is a
Metonimicall form of speech often used in Scripture, whereby is meant, pity
and compassion toward them, that are any way afflicted, or in any misery. And
here the Apostle does understand such a measure of pity, and compassion as
affects the very intrals, and bowels, making the bowels to dilate themselves,
and (as it were) to open themselves, and to burn and yearne within.

Here then, not to speak of this virtue so much as

We are first of all taught, that we are to be tenderly affected toward those
that are any way afflicted; We are to be tenderly affected toward them that
be any way afflicted.
we are to put one such pity, and compassion toward them that are in any
distress, as does move our hearts, toward them, and does possess our hearts,
with a true touch and feeling of their misery; yea, with as lively a sense of
it, as if we our selves were in the same case with them, this is clear from
this manner of speaking, (bowels of mercy) as may easily appear by the use of
this phrase, in other places of Scripture, Genesis 43.30. It is said, that Joseph's
affection was so strongly moved toward his brother Benjamin, that his bowels
were enflamed, and did burn within him. 1. King. 3.26. We read that one of
the women that contended before Solomon about the living child, was not able
to endure that the child should be divided,, because, says the text, Her
compassion was kindled, her bowels were moved, and did yearne, and burn
within her: and we may read of it in many other places, that the greatness and
tenderness of affection, is set out by moving, and yearning of the bowels,
and therefore this form of speech (bowels of mercy) does teach us to put on
such pity, and compassion toward such as be in distress, as does work in
us a lively sense and feeling of their misery. And hence is it, that we are
exhorted to weep with them that weep, Romans 12.15. and to remember them that
are in bonds, as though we were bound with them. Heb. 13.3.

The reason, Cor. 12.26.

Now before we come to the application of this point,

Answer, rule of Christian love which teaches us to put on tender bowels,
pity, and comiseration toward all in distress, being of the same nature with
us; yet with this difference, if they who are punished, suffer as blasphemers,
or traitors, and for any offense directly against Gods glory, the good estate
of the Church, and religion, then we may be so far from pitying them, and
sorrowing for them, and putting on tender bowels in regard of their sufferings,
as we may be glad, and rejoice, not pleasing our selves in the smart of any be
they never so wicked, but for other special causes, as

Psalm 58.10.11. The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance, etc.

Aram stricken with blindness, that they come no more into the land of
Israel, 2. King. 6.23.



It ought to be far from us to insult over them that be be in distress, and
to sport our selves in their affliction.


First, it being so that we are to put on tender bowels toward the afflicted,
and to them that are in any misery: certainly, then it ought to be far from
every one of us to insult over such, and to make our selves merry with their
affliction, as the manner of some is, to take advantage on the affliction and
misery of others, to deal hardly with them, to add affliction to affliction,
and to heap one misery upon another, and it is most barbarous and brutish,
and after the manner of the dog to fall upon him that is down, it argues
exceeding hardness of heart; for the afflictions and miseries of our brethren
are visible Sermons, moving us to pity, and compassion, and things seen
make deeper impression then things only heard of, if we then seeing the
miseries of our brethren be not moved with pity toward them, but rather we
insult over them, or we take advantage thereby to deal hardly with them, it is
an argument of extreme hardness of heart. Psalm. 69.26. They persecute him
whom thou have smitten. Therefore lay iniquity on iniquity, and punish one sin
with another, or add punishment to punishment, which is an heavy cross, and
to be thought on by all such as insult over them that are in misery, or take
advantage thereby to deal hardly with them.

Again, is it so that we are to be tenderly affected toward We are not to
content our selves with verbal pity.
yea so to be affected toward them, that our inwards are to be touched with
a feeling of their misery. Surely then we are not to content our selves with
that pity that is too common in the world, (namely verbal pity) a Lord help
thee; or as James sets it out, Iam. 2.26. Go thy ways, warm thy self, fill
thy belly, etc. and yet supply nothing that is needful; no, no, that is no
feeling pity, a feeling pity (doubtless) will make both the tongue to
speak, and the hands to minister that which may bring ease and comfort, and
where there be bowels of mercy, there will be ever a willingness, and
readiness to the works of mercy. And therefore deceive not thy self, if thou
be hardly drawn to any work of mercy, and it must be pulled from thee as it
were by maine strength, by many arguments, reasons, and many inducements, thou
have no bowels of mercy, thou have no feeling pity in thee, and if no feeling
pity be in thee to the distressed members of Christ, it seals up to thee a
fearful conclusion, even this, that thou art not of the same body with them,
and that thou have not yet felt the love of God in thy breast, neither have the
love of God dwelling in thee. The text is plain, 1. John 3.17. Whosoever has
this worlds good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels
from him, or against him, how dwells the love of God in him? Remember
therefore for a conclusion of this, the argument here used by the Apostle, he
wished the Colossians, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved of God, to put on
tender mercy; so I say to thee, if thou would be sure of thine own election
to life and salvation, if thou would have an infallible note of true holiness,
and if thou would prove it to the comfort of thine own soul, that thou art
beloved of God in Christ, then content not thy self with verbal pity, but
put on bowels of mercy, let the known misery of others enter into thine
heart, and move thy bowels toward them, even to minister ease and comfort as
any occasion shall be offered, and as the Lord shall enable thee.

Works of mercy must proceed from an inward moving and yearning of the bowels.
we are taught, whence the works of mercy, and the comfort we minister to
others, either in word or deed ought to proceed, (namely) from the inward
moving, and yearning of the bowels, from the heart tenderly affected toward
them, to whom we do any good, Isai. 58.10. The Prophet says, if thou pour
thy soul out to the hungry. He requires not only a pouring out of food to
the hungry, but with the food a pouring out of the soul. 2. Cor. 9.7. As
every man wishes in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of
necessity. Let this gift come from the wish of his heart and that the Apostle
there adds (for God loves a cheerful giver) may be the reason and ground of
this duty, Romans 12.8. and there can be no cheerfulness, unless the work come
from the inward affection of the heart, therefore every work of mercy ought
thence to proceed. even from the inward moving, and yearning of the bowels.

work of mercy pleasing to God, that comes either from ones superfluity, or
from the importunity of them that are in distress, or from example of others
inuiting us, or from a desire of praise or the like, much less that which is
forced out from torture, or torment, to stop the mouth of a guilty conscience,
as when wicked rich men lying on their death beds, are forced through the
gripes of a galled conscience Works of mercy please not God, which come from
superfluity, or from the importunity of the distressed, or from example of
others, or from desire of praise, and the like, or are forced out from the
gripes of a galled conscience.
to give some thing to charitable uses, no, no, beneficence acceptable to God
comes only from tenderness of heart, and without that, all our bounty or show
of mercy whatsoever, is nothing worth; for the Lord looks rather at the
affection, then at the outward action in all duties of love and mercy, and
here is comfort for such as are of tender bowelles, comfort for such as be of
tender bowels.
though they be not able to do any work of mercy, art thou tenderly affected,
toward the afflicted members of Christ? can thou mourn with them when they
mourn cannest thou pray for them when they are in distress,

One thing yet remains to be noted, the Apostle says, (bowelles of mercy)
he speaks in the plural number, heerby teaching.

That our mercies must be of diverse kinds, according Our mercies must be
diverse and often repeated.
according to the diverse subjects of miseries, or long continuance of them, It
is not enough to minister outward comfort alone, or inward alone, to him that
is afflicted both in body and mind, How we fail in this duty.
whose misery should open and affect our bowels.

Now to the second virtue here urged by the Apostle, (kindness) put on
kindness.

This virtue extends and reaches further then the former, for pity and
compassion is proper to those that are in some affliction and misery, but
kindness goes further: It reaches to all, What kindness is.
whether in prosperity or adversity, it is a sweet and loving disposition of
the heart, and a courteous affection to all, showing it self in pleasing and
good speech, it is an easines to be used and employed for the good of others
for so the original word does properly signify, and we find it so used in
other places of Scripture, says our Savior, my yoke is easy the word is
(...), and it may be rendered kind, my yoke is kind, Mat. 11.30.
if says the Apostle, ye have tasted how bountiful the Lord is; it may be
rendered, how sweet, or how kind the Lord is, 1. Pet. 2.3.
and so in many other places that might be cited. Here then we see what is
required of us, namely this, that we put on a sweet loving affection of heart We
are to put on a swe^t loving affection of he art toward all, showing at self
in kind speech and countenance.
that we show our selves affable and courteous to all, and tractable and easy
to be employed for the good of all; That is true kindness and courtesy, and this
we are required to show one to another, Ephesians. 4.32. be ye courteous one to
another, and tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
forgave you, and Gal. 5.22. gentleness is reckoned up among the fruits of the
spirit.

Now this virtue as it has relation to the afflicted, How this virtue is to be
manifested to the afflicted.
it is to be manifested in yielding comfort and refreshing to them, and
standing by them to help them in time of need, and to do them good, Absolon
could find it as a fault in Hushaie, that he went not with his friend David in
time of need, 2. Sam. 16.17. is this thy kindness to thy friend? and as it has
respect to others not afflicted, And how to others not afflicted.
it is to be expressed as before I have showed, in giving good speech, and in
showing good countenance, and in easiness to be used in any thing wherein we
may do good to others: and this is to be considered of us, Discovery of
counterfeit kindness.
in bowing and bending, and in outward ceremonies and complements, no, no, that
is but the courtesy of the world, it is commonly severed from good affection,
yea, sometimes it is a mask of a wicked and ill affected heart, and a work of
the flesh neither is it to be esteemed true kindness that stands in practice of
plausible behauior, as in drinking with the drunkard, which is counted a note
of a kind nature, or when men make themselves popular and pleasing to others by
giving way to them in their sinful courses, as in yielding liberty to such as
live under them for all licentious and disordered manner of living, suffering
them to swear and swagger, and to be profane without check and controlement:
they that so do are accounted kind, as ye shall hear some servants say, oh
such a man is a kind master, do his work, and I warrant you then he will
let you do what you will, work hard all the week, and he will let you run
whether you list upon the Sabbath day, is this true kindness? is this a fruit of
the Spirit? no, no, true Christian kindness takes not away necessary restraint,
and correction but does mittigate and moderate it, making it more easy to be
borne; and profitable true kindness consists in a tractable willingness, in
a facility and easiness to be used only in that wherein we may do good to
others, yea in an easiness to be employed for the good of al, which is to be
marked of us, for we may be deceived with We must take heed we be not
deceived with the shadow of this virtue.
Many heathen men have had, and many mere natural men may have in them the
counterfeit of this virtue, they are kind to such as are kind to them, and
friendly to their friends, but true kindness must go further, we must
therein be like God himself, his example must we follow Luke 6.35. he is
kind unto the unkind, and to the evil, so are we to be kind to our enemies
and those that hate us, and there must be in us an easiness to be used for
the good of all whatsoever they be, friends or foes, remember we that.

And now to stir us up to the putting on of this excellent virtue, consider
with me these two things. Two Motives stirring us up to put on kindness.


First, true Christian kindness is a special means to win the hearts of
all unto us, he that is truly kind, tractable, the best way to knit the
hearts of all especially of all good men unto him, yea to seal up to his own
soul an assurance of Gods favor and loving kindness, the shadow of this
virtue in heathen men has been of that force that thereby they have
maruellouslie carried away the hearts of men, and hence it is that many
profane and worldly men do much affect this virtue, or at least the shadow
of it.

Again consider on the other side that whatsoever other good qualities a man
has, yet if he be of an unkind and churlish nature he shall never win the
hearts of men, nor ever prevail in any worthy service, in Church, in
commonwealth or family, a sower, cynicall, and churlish behavior is
distasteful to every one. How was David galled with Nabals churlish answer?
he endured with patience Saul's laying wait for his life, and Shemeies cursing
of him, but he could not endure that answer of Nabal; and had not Abigail met
him and persuaded him to the contrary, he had not left to Nabal by the dawning
of the day any of his house to piss against the wall.

If then we desire to be loved of all and especially of our brethren, all good
men, yea to be assured of Gods favor and loving kindness toward us, yea so
to be loved of all men, as may be for our own good, and the good of others. Let
us put on a loving and kind disposition of heart toward our brethren, yea an
easiness and tractable willingness, as much as we are able to be employed
for the good of al, whether they be kind or unkind to us; and remember that
this virtue of kindness is of most excellent use in every worthy service
either in Church, commonwealth or family, it winnes men's hearts to us, and the
hearts being wonn^ they are easily wrought on to any good purpose.

Come we to the third virtue (humblenes of mind) put on (says the Apostle)
humbleness of mind, touching this virtue know we

That humbleness of mind, is a mean and moderate estimation of our selves,
and of all the good gifts and graces we have, either of body or mind.

It has a double relation, It has a double relation.
either to God, and then it is an acknowledgement of our nothingnes (as I may
so say) and that all we have is from God, or it has respect to men, and then
it is an esteeming of others better then our selves, namely, such as are truly
called, and Gods children, and this is the humbleness of mind here meant.

Here then first we see, we are to carry in us an humble We are to carry in
us, a mean and moderate estimation of our selves in respect of other men.
we are to esteem others better then our selves, and to this purpose the
Apostle says, Romans 12.16. be not high minded, but make your selves equal to
them of the lower sort, and yet more plainly, Phil. 2.3. let every man in
meeknes of mind, esteem other better then himself: I might add to these,
other places of Scripture to show that this is our duty, but I choose rather to
stir us up to the practice of it, for it may be we will easily yield that
this is our duty, that we ought every man in humbleness of mind, to esteem
others better then our selves.

Yet this virtue is hard to obtain, This virtue is hard to obtain.
it is contrary to nature it is agreeable to nature, to be proud of good
things, as appears by Herod, Act. 12.13. and Saul, who was offended that David
was preferred before him in the song, 1. Sam. 18.7. Saul has slain his
thousand, and David his ten thousand, yea, men are naturally proud of the shows
of things that are not in them, of glosses and shadows of good things, yea,
Note.
and sometimes when they know they are not in them, but clawbackes and
flatterers do ascribe to them, and therefore to stir us forward, in the
practice of this duty, even in humbleness of mind, Two motives stirring us up
to humbleness of mind.
to esteem others better then our selves, consider with me only these two
things.

First, we may see many good things in others, which we those good things that
be in us in greater measure in others, then they be in us.

Again, consider that we are privy to more sin and corruption in our
selves, then we can be in others.

How many evil things are in us, if we search and ransacke our own hearts,
which may worthily make us hang down our heads, and esteem more basely of our
selves then any other man can with any color of reason speak or ^hinke of us?
let these things be duly considered, and they will help us to hold down our
hearts in humility, and take from us all matter of lifting up our selves above
others; away then with those vain and foolish words, I am as good as thou. I
am his better, and the like; away with such proud and lofty thoughts, and let
us put on this glorious ornament of humility; let us in humbleness of mind
every one esteem another better then himself.

Observe we in the next place, the form of speech here used by the Apostle,
he says not, put on humility, but humbleness of mind, hence we are taught,

True humility is seated in the heart and mind.
they indeed are truly humble, that are of humble hearts and minds.

And thus we read, that David clearing himself of ambition, and protesting his
humility before the Lord. Psalm. 131.1. says, mine heart is not haughty, first
he begins with the lowliness of his heart, and then descends to protest his
humble outward carriage, it is the exhortation of the Apostle Peter 1. Pet.
5.5. deck your selves inwardly in lowlines of mind: for God resists the
proud, and gives grace unto the humble, let your humility be inwardly in heart
and mind.

Popish humility is counterfeit.
they would make the world believe that some among them are the most humble and
mortified men alive, in that forsooth they forfake lands and goods, and put on
the habit of a poor monk or friar, but indeed there is no true humility in
them, for under their show of humility, they nourish in their hearts, the
greatest pride that can be, even a vain confidence in themselves, challenging
to themselves a state of perfection.

Again, this doctrine, that true humility is seated in the The counterfeit show
of humility that is in the world, discovered.
does uncase and pull off the visor of humilty from the face of many in the
world, who make a fair show, and carry a fair pretext of humility, that
forsooth they can be content to lay their hands under the feet of their
brethren, to perform the basest office to the meanest, when indeed they mean
nothing less, happily they would lay their hands under their feet to supplant
them, or as Absalon did. 2 Sa. 15.5. make themselves plausible and familiar to
strengthen their hands in bad purposes, let such know, that as they put on the
counterfeit of so excellent a grace as humility, and varnish over their wicked
intents with so fair a gloss, that their hypocrisy in this respect is the
greater, and without repentance they shall receive the reward of such as cover
sin with a lie, even punishment double in proportion to that which is due to
open offenders, for their sin is doubled and enfolded one within another, and
their punishment shall be answerable.

It remains that we answer a popish cavil A popish cavil.
occasioned, from this, that we are to put on humbleness of mind, they of
that faction, cry out against us and say; we be far from humbleness of
mind, in that we hold certainty of salvation by faith, say they, you are
proud and presumptuous, and carry your selves too high upon that excellent gift
of faith, which indeed is a mere cavil, and herein they deal most
injuriously with us, they may if they will observe that we build not
certainetie of salvation upon the gift of faith, or upon the dignity of that
gift, as they do on the merit of works of grace, having (as they say) power
given of Christ to merit, for that were arrogancy indeed, but we build
assurance of salvation by faith, on the promise of God propounding mercy,
remission of sins, justification, life and salvation, that by true faith, lay
hold on the death and obedience of his son incarnate, which is a rock that
never can be shaken, therefore we cannot be justly taxed with pride and
presumption, for holding certainty of salvation by faith apprehending the
promise of mercy in the active and passive obedience of Christ.

Now to the 4. virtue here urged by the Apostle (meeknes) put on meeknes;
touching this virtue, that we may rightly conceive it, know we that meeknes in
a general acception What meekness is in a general acception.
of the word is a calmnes and quietness of heart and mind, a settled and quiet
disposition of mind; free from perturbation, when the mind is settled and
quiet, free from passion and disordered affections, then in a general sense
there is meeknes.

Now this calm and quiet disposition of heart and mind has a double relation,
It has a double relation.
either to God, and then it is a quiet and silent subjection of our hearts to
the will of God revealed, though therein our wills be crossed, a meek
submission of our wills to Gods will revealed, though never so contrary unto
them, and to this David exhorts, Ps. 4.4. examine your own heart upon your
bed, What meekness is here understood.
and be still; and of this spoke the Prophet,, Esaias 30.15. In quietness and
in confidence shall be your strength, as if he had said, your strength must be
exercised, not in striving against, but in the enduring of Gods hand or it has
relation to men, and then it is a quiet and calm disposition of heart, as is
neither prone to provoke,

Here then is required of us, even of as many as hold our selves, to be the
Elect of God, that we put on calm and quiet spirits, that we carry in us such
a disposition, as is neither prone to provoke, nor soon provoked to anger by
any injury, We are to put on calm and quiet spirits and we must be so
disposed as that we neither be prone to provoke, nor soon provoked to anger
by any injury.
and that is meeknes. We read 1. Pet. 3.4. that a meek and quiet spirit are
joined together, as indeed being one and the same thing, and we shall find
this duty often urged in Scripture, I refer you to the reading of Ephesians.
4.2. Gal. 5.23. it is reckoned there among the fruits of the spirit, and 2.
Tim. 2.25. the Apostle teaches Tymothy to instruct with meekness, them, that
are contrary minded, a worthy example of this we have in Moses, Numb. 12.3.
who being much wronged by Aaron and Miriam, yet was meek, and not stirred up
to anger; yea, he is there pronounced, by the mouth of the Lord to be a very
meek man, above all the men that were upon the earth. Other examples and
testimonies might be added, but these are sufficient to clear it that this is
our duty, namely, that we carry in our bosoms, meek and quiet spirits, and
such a disposition of heart, as is neither prone to provoke, nor soon stirred
up to anger. Reproof of such as are of hot, hastly spirits, soon stirred up
to anger.


Here then come such to be taxed, and justly to be reproved, that are of
hot, hasty, and turbulent spirits, soon stirred up to anger on every trifling
occasion.

Now too many such untaught and untamed hearts be amongst us. Are there not
many that show themselves of unquiet and turbulent spirits, on the least
occasion that may be? Yea, are there not some that if they have but a conceit
of a wrong offered, or done to them, if they but imagine such a thing, are so
far carried in their passion, and perturbation, that they show themselves
boistrous, and threaten to do great matters?

Happily thou will say, why? Do not wrong me,

Is it so, that thou can not endure to be wronged, we may gather by thine
own confession. Oh deceive not thy self, true Christian meekness that ought
to be in every child of God, is a quietness and calmness of Spirit, when
injuries and wrongs are offered or done to him, and that is the thing thou must
labor for, thou must put on such a disposition of heart, as is neither prone
to provoke, nor soon provoked to anger by injuries and wrongs, and that being
once obtained thou art of a meek and quiet spirit.

4. motives stirring us up to meekness
Now then, to stir us up to the putting on of this excellent virtue, consider
we,

Pet. 3.4.

Matthew. 11.29. Learn of me (says our Savior Christ) that I am meek and
lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

Thirdly, consider (amongst others) that one excellent Proverb. 15.1. that it
is of force, being expressed by soft and meek words, not only to keep wrath
from breaking out, but also to cause wrath, yea fiery wrath, being broken out,
to return and go back again. A worthy example hereof we have in Gedeon,
Judge. 8.2. who with a mild and meek answer appeased the hot and sharp words
of the proud Ephramites against him, so as they had not a word to reply, the
text says, verse. 3. Their spirits abated toward him.

Consider further, that comfortable promise that is Matthew. 5.5. That they shall
inherit the earth. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth:
they shall have possession of outward good things, so far forth as it may
stand with Gods glory, and their good. Yea so far forth also, they shall be
hid in the day of the Lords wrath. Zephan. 2.3. They shall be protected from
danger, when the Lord does execute his judgments in the world.

If then we could be clothed with such a garment, as is much set by in Gods
sight, if we would testify it to our selves, and others, that we have
received the Spirit of Christ, (and he that has not his Spirit is none of his)
if we would prevail against that, which in force is able to withstand, even
the wrath and rage of sinful man, and if we would have assurance that we have
right and title to the comfortable promise of God, touching the fruition of the
good things of this life, and protection from evil in the day of the Lords
wrath, so far as may be for his glory and our good: and in one word, if we
would be truly glorious in this world, and have assurance of everlasting
glory in the life to come. Then let us learn of the King of glory, Christ
Jesus, to be meek and mild in spirit, and let us put on such a disposition of
heart, as is neither prone to provoke, nor soon provoked to anger.

Come we to the last virtue here urged by the Apostle, (Long suffering.)

Concerning this virtue, know we, that long suffering What long suffering is.
differs not from meekness in kind, but only in degree, for it is nothing
else but a further degree of meekness, and that we mistake it not; we must
understand, that this virtue also has a double relation, It has a double
relation.
there is a long suffering in respect of God, and that is a continued quiet
submission of our wills to Gods will, under a long continued affliction, when
the hand of God is long continued upon us, and we continue to subject ourselves
to it in patience and silence, that is long suffering in respect of God, and
that is called long patience, James 5.7. And of that the Apostle speaks Cap
1.11. Strengthened with all might through his glorious power, unto all
patience, and long suffering, with ioyfulnesse.

There is also a long suffering in respect of men, and that is the
longsuffering here meant.

And it is a continued calmness and quietness of mind after many injuries and
wrongs offered, What long suffering is here meant.
or done by men, when a man being much, and often provoked by injurious words,
or deeds, does notwithstanding quietly pass them over, and put them up, and is
still quiet and calm, not provoked to anger, then is he long suffering.

We are to be of meek and quiet spirits though we be often provoked to anger,
and after many in^uries offered and done unto us.
it is our parts to be of meek minde^, and not to be stirred up to anger, I
will not stand long to prove this, being (as we said) but a further degree of
meekness, read only, Gal. 5 22. this virtue is there reckoned up among the
fruits of the spirit, whereby we are known to be the children of God, 1 Cor.
13.4. It is reckoned as one, yea as the first of those excellent properties of
love, that love is long suffering, and in many other places that might be
cited, we find this virtue commended to us, and indeed, it is a virtue rare,
and scarce to be found in this age of the world.

Reproof of them that are far from long suffering.
that we will now suffer nothing at all. Yea, some stick not to say, they will
carry no coals: and others hold it a disgrace to them, to pocket, and put up
an injury, and say, shall I suffer my self to be made a fool, and so indeed
to avoid the name of fools they will do the works of fools; for anger
rests in the bosom of fools Eccles. 7.11. and many other reasonings of the
flesh there be against this worthy grace of long suffering.

2. motives to stir us up to long suffering
Now in a word to stir us up to the putting on of this excellent virtue,
consider we,

Psa. 103.8. the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, slow to anger, and of
great kindness.

Again, consider the excellency of this virtue, many Proverbs 14.29. He that
is slow to wrath is of great wisdom, and Prou. 15.18. It appeaseth strife.
Proverbs 16.32. He that is slow unto anger, is better then the mighty man, and
he that rules his own mind, is better then he that wins a City; no
Conqueror so mighty as he that subdues his own passions. Prou. 19.11. The
discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and his glory is to pass by an
offense.

Howsoever then the world esteems long suffering a note of folly, and want of
wisdom, yet let us rest in the testimony of the holy Ghost, that it is true
discretion and wisdom to put up injuries and to pass by offenses. Let us
endeavor to adorn our selves with this goodly ornament of long suffering,
which indeed declares true wisdom, is a note of true valor and strength: and
(which is chiefly to be remembered of us) it makes us like to God himself,
and so brings comfort to our own souls. Let us think on these things, and
be hereby stirred up to the putting on of this excellent virtue.

Now here a scruple is to be removed, in that the Apostle says, Put on long
suffering, and he speaks indefinitely, not limiting his speech (as you see) to
a long suffering of some kind of injuries.

Hereupon a doubt may rise. Some may say, why? A doubt.
Some kind of injuries are such, as if we suffer them but a little time, we
hazard the loss of our lives, and the utter overthrow of our state, and
therefore we doubt whether we are to be long suffering in respect of them, or
no.

For remouall of this doubt,

Some are light offenses, Difference of offenses and wrongs.
such words and deeds as only offend us without any loss or hurt to us, and
these we are to tread under our feet, and to pass by as though they were
never spoke nor done, and of those is that place to be understood, Prou.
19.11. It is a man's honor to pass by an offense.

The second sort of offenses there be that are more then offensive (namely)
such as bring some small hurt to our goods, life, or good names, and these we
may take notice of by the example of Christ, John 8.40. but withal we must
do as he there did, put them up, and belong suffering in respect of them.

A third sort of injuries there be that go yet further, (namely) such as bring
danger to our lives or estates, either in our goods or bodies, and these we
may take notice of, and we may seek a lawful remedy against them, sooner or
latter, according to the known danger of them, yet so, as in our seeking a
lawful remedy against them, we still carry in us meek and quiet spirits,
for even in seeking a remedy against great injuries, such as endanger our
lives or states, we are to be long suffering (that is) of quiet spirits; we
must take heed that we nourish not in us a lust of revenge, when we seek the
righting of some great wrong, by lawful and appointed means. The Apostle has
taught us, Romans 12.19. that we must not avenge our selves, vengeance is the
Lords right, and we may not incroach on it, either by thought, word, or deed.

VER. 13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a
quarrel to another: even as Christ forgave you, even so do ye.
In this Verse our Apostle comes to show wherein the two last named virtues,
(namely) meekness, and longsuffering, are to be declared, and he sets down
distinctly two things wherein they are to be expressed and manifested.

First, in forbearing one another. and

Secondly, in forgiving one another.

And the second of these he does further amplify.

First, by the matter of forgiveness, what we ought to If any man have a
quarrel to another.

Secondly, by an argument, enforcing such forgiveness, Even at Christ forgave
you, even so do ye.

These be the heads and general things contained in this verse* come we to
speak of them as they lie in order, and first, of Forbearing one another.

Touching this we must know, Interpretation.
that to forbear is (according to the nature of the word here used) with
patience to suffer and tolerate such things in our brethren, as are
troublesome and grievous unto us; for the proper object of tolerance or
forbearance, is the unpleasing disposition or behavior of our brethren, their
disposition and manners that are offensive and grievous to us. And so the
meaning of the Apostle, when he says, Forbearing one another, is, as if he
had said, tollerating, or suffering with pasuch things in one another as are
offensive to you, supporting one another in love, for so the word is rendered,
Ephesians. 4.2. Supporting or bearing one with another in such things as are found
in your brethren troublesome, and grievous unto you.

Here then we may easily see, What forbearing on another is.
what is the duty laid before us, (namely) this, that we are to manifest and
express our meekness and long suffering in a patient sufferance, and
tolleration of such things in our brethren as are troublesome and grievous unto
us, in a quiet bearing with their unpleasing disposition, and manners; and that
we be not deceived in this duty, know we more particularly, that our
meekness ought to be expressed in tollerating and bearing the infirmities and
frailties of our brethren, appearing in their outward actions, as their
hastiness, slownesse, rashness, frowardness, or their passions and
perturbations, appearing likewise in their actions only, so farreforth as they
are displeasing unto us, or do therein wrong us.

What things we are not to tolerate in others.
We are not indeed to tolerate and suffer the open offenses and sins of men,
but we are to admonish and reprove them for the same, keeping our selves within
the compass of our callings, yea if so be Gods glory be called in question, or
the salvation of men be like to be hindered, we are then for a time to lay aside
meekness, and to put on severity. We read that Moses the meekest man on the
earth, when he saw the people of God worshipping the golden calfe, was so
incensed with anger, that he brake the two Tables in pieces beneath the
mountain, Exodus 32.19. he took his sword, and together with the sons of
Leui slew three thousand of the people the same day, as we find verse 28.
Yea, Christ himself though he would not break a bruised reed, yet when he
had to deal with the great corruption of the Scribes and Pharisees, Mat.
23.13. So then the duty is thus to be conceived.

We are to manifest our meekness, and our quiet suffering and bearing, with
the infirmities of our brethren, as their hastiness, slownesse, or other
passions and perturbations, appearing in their actions, so far forth, as
they are displeasing to us: We are to manifest our meekness in our quiet
bearing with the infirmities of our brethren, and with their passions and
perturbatio^s, so far forth as they are displeasing to us.
and this is it that we are exhorted to, Ephesians. 4.2. That we support and
bear up one another in love, in regard of infirmities. And Gal. 6.2. says the
Apostle, bear one another burden, meaning such things in our brethren as are
like burdens, even troublesome and grievous unto us.

meekness, who will not forbear their brethren in the least thing that may
be. Such as will not forbear their brethren in the least thing, are far from
Christian meekness.


Yea, some there be, whose mouths (publishing their own shame) stick not to
say, I cannot forbear, I must needs speak my mind, yea, some are grown so
shameless as to say, I will not forbear him, say what you can, and he shall
have as good as he brings, I can be as hot and as hasty as he for his life.

Surely, they that thus speak, are far from Christian meekness and long
suffering, and as yet can have no assurance that they are in the number of the
Elect of God, and that they are beloved of God in Christ.

Now then to stir us up to the practice of the duty laid before us. Motives
to stir us up to this duty of forbearance, are three.


Consider we first the necessity of this duty of forbearance, how needful a
thing it is, to bear with the infirmities of our brethren, and with their
displeasing passions,

And again:

Consider the benefit that comes by bearing with the Solomon says, Prou.
18.16. a fools lips come with strife, it is not so much the occasion given,
as lips that make strife, it is not so much the hastiness of the one, as the
hot reply of another, that works a quarrellous contention, which by
forbearance may be avoided, yea, we bearing with our brethren, sometimes for
the present, may afterward (the passion once ouerpast) have any reasonable
contentment at their hands, yea sometimes by forbearing thy brother for a time,
thou may shortly after have him voluntarily, and of his own accord
acknowledge his faults to thee.

And consider further that the poor oft-times forbear the rich, the subjects
the magistrate, the base the Noble, either for fear of hurt or hope of some
good, and ought not we much more for conscience sake frame our selves to
forbear our brethren.

For conclusion then of this point, if we desire to live a quiet and
comfortable life in any society, if we would turn away much hurt from our
selves and others: if we would show that good conscience is as powerful in
us, as the fear of hurt, or the hope of good is in others, to make us do that
we ought, then let us in the fear of God be stirred up to manifest our
meekness and long suffering in tollerating and bearing with the infirmities
of our brethren, and their passions appearing in their actions so far forth as
they are displeasing to us.

Before we come to the second thing here mentioned, observe that the Apostle
makes Christian forbearance a mutual and reciprocal duty, he says,
forbearing one another mutually, or by course, giving us to understand

Every one has need sometimes to be forborne.
even the best have need often times to be supported and borne withal.

For indeed the best have not only their infirmities in performance of holy
duties, Moses used the help of Hur, a man far inferior to himself. Exodus
17 12.

But they have in them such things as are troublesome, grievous, and offensive
to their brethren, they are either too selfe-conceited, abounding in their own
sense, or somewhat hasty, or the like, and therefore have need sometimes to be
borne withal, in which case a mutual forbearing one of another is very
necessary.

Do thou then see thy brother at this time too self-conceited, a little
hasty, or the like, Bear with the infirmity of thy brother now, and he may
happily bear with thee in like case another time.
and bear thou with his dullness, and he will bear with thy frowardness,
bear thou with his hastiness, and he will bear with thy
selfe-conceitednesse, etc.

I pass on to the second thing, wherein meekness and long suffering, are to
be expressed (namely) in forgiving one another.

And concerning this first, know we, Note.
that forgiveness is more then forbearance, for a man may forbear to revenge
an injury because he wants power to do it, or it is not expedient for him as
yet, he wanting opportunity or the like, and we know God himself suffers the
wicked reprobate, for a time to go under his long sufferance, but he forgiues
them not their sins, so that forgiveness is more then forbearance, and that
we may rightly conceive it as it is here expressed, according to the proper
signification of the word here used by the Apostle, What it is to forgive one
another.
know we further that the forgiving one another is a free remission, (for so
the word signifies) a free remission of revenge (that is) of requiting evil
for evil, and of returning punishment in We are to express our meekness, in
remitting all revenge for injuries done unto us, in not requiting evil for
evil, nor returning punishment in way of requital.
word or deed, when we neither carry in us any hatred or purpose of revenge
for wrongs received, nor return punishment in way of requital for them, then
we forgive.

Here then we see the duty required of us is this.

That we express and make known our meekness and long suffering, in
remmitting all revenge for injuries done, in not requiting evil for evil, nor
returning punishment for them in way of requital, either by thought, word or
deed, for howsoever we may (as before was showed) seek and use lawful
remedy against such injuries as are dangerous to our lives, or estate, yet in
the use of it, we may not carry in us a desire of revenge, for that were to
make the Magistrate an instrument of our malice, but we must manifest our
meekness and long suffering, in putting away all hatred, and remitting all
revenge, either by thought word or deed, and that is true and right
forgiveness one of another: True and right forgiveness one of another.


And this duty the Lord does often require at our hands, yea, our Savior
Christ requires it should be done, if need be, Mat. 18.22.
oftentimes, not seven times, but seauenty times seauenty times.

And it is that, also we do make continual profession of, and not only before
men, but even before the Lord himself forgive us our debts, as we also
forgive our debtors, we find this a clear point, Mat. 6.12. Luke 11.4.
and often urged in the Scripture.

We are to practice this duty.
and indeed the duty of forgiveness is very needful to be urged in this
age, it is a thing we are hardly drawn unto, there be many oppositions and
reasonings of the flesh against it, Carnal reasonings against it.
as forsooth the matter is so grievous and so foul, we could forgive any
wrong, and our friends should entreat us for any other thing but this: never
remembering how great offenses God forgiues us, and if we say, we have deserved
better at their hands,

A carnal distinction.
Some again, being by order of friends, or otherwise moved to forgive,
happily they will forgive the fault, but not forgette the matter, nor affect
the person offending them, but carry still a purpose of revenge, therefore we
have need often and earnestly to be stirred up to the practice of this duty,
of forgiving one another. Two motives to stir us up to forgive one another.
And to that purpose, consider with me these same two things.

First, we have here laid before us the example of Christ,

Again, consider that forgiveness one of another is an undoubted and
infallible argument to persuade our consciences,

Now then lay these two things together.

Consider, that Christ Jesus he suffered and bare the infinite wrath of his
father, even all that was due to all, and every one of Gods chosen, it cost him
the shedding of his dearest blood to procure remission of our sins.

Now we for our parts may forgive one another, without either cost or pain,
yea, we cannot do it but with unspeakable comfott, even thereby assuring our
own hearts of the pardon and forgiveness of our own sins; Oh then who is
it that will not be persuaded to such a duty, wherein Christ himself has gone
before him? it is a duty full of sweet comfort, think upon it, and be
stirred up (in the fear of God) by the example of Christ, and for thine own
comfort, to forgive thy brother. put away all hatred, and purpose of revenge
for injuries received. go not about to requite evil for evil, by thought,
word, or deed.

Come we to the amplification of this duty, of forgiving one another, and first
(as we said) it is further laid before us, by the matter of forgiveness in
these words (if any have a quarrel to another) the matter of forgiveness, is
matter of quarrel, the word (quarrel) is only needful here to be
explained, and touching that, know we that by (Quarrel) in this place, is
meant any just cause of complaint, when a man has just cause to complain of
some offense, of some injury or wrong offered or done to him by another, and
so the meaning is briefly this, if any one have just cause to complain of an
injury or wrong offered or done to him by another.

Here then observe we, that that the Apostle does limit forgiveness one of
another to matter of quarrel, he bounds our forgiveness one of another,
upon just cause of complaint, on matter of offense, and of injury, offered or
done to us by our brethren, this is to be marked of us, it gives some light
for the understanding of that, how we may be said to remitte and forgive the
trespasses of our brethren, How we forgive the trespasses of our brethren.
as we are taught to pray, namely, not as they are properly sins and
transgressions of Gods Law, (for so the remission of them belongs only to the
Lord, and no man is able to do it) but we forgive the trespasses of our
brethren, as they give to us just cause of complaint, as they are injuries and
wrongs, bringing detriment and hurt to us, either in body, goods, or good
name, so men may remit without impeachment, or derogation from Gods glory, a
man does remitte the trespasses of his brethren, when he does forgive the
injury and harm rising from them to himself, together with all the conceived
anger and malice for the same.

Now in that the Apostle does subioine to forgiving one another, the matter of
forgiveness in these terms (if any man have a quarrel to another) if any
man have just cause of complaint against another, we easily see thus much
offered to our consideration.

That we are to forgive our brethen, even We are then to forgive our brethren,
when we have just cause of offense and quarrel.
in regard of some injury or wrong offered, or done to us by them, we are then
to forgive, when we have just cause of offense and quarrel. We find the
question thus propounded by Peter, Mat. 18.21. Master how often shall my
brother sin against me, and I shall forgive him, and Luke 14.5. says our
Savior, though thy brother sin against thee, though thy brother offend thee,
and thou have just cause of complaint against him seven times in a day, and
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, it repents me, thou shall
forgive him,

The reason and ground of this duty is very plain, namely this.

Then is the fit time for the exercise and showing forth of any practical
grace or virtue,

Then is the fit time to show forth our meekness, in forgiving our brethren,
when they offend and wrong us, either in word or deed.

Therefore we are to forgive one another, Reproof of such as regard not this
duty, but plead against it.
this duty is little regarded in the world; may we not often hear it out of
the mouths of some, yea, they hold it a good plea, and sufficient defense for
themselves (say they) may we not serve him as he has served us, and deal
with him as he has dealt with us? and being reproved for their violence in
speech and behavior, expressing their cankered and reuengefull minds, why
(say they) judge you of it, they dare appeal to the judgment of him that
reprooues them, have we not just cause? have we not reason for it, thus to
be moved, and thus to speak, and thus to deal? we would gladly be quiet,
but we have just cause given us to be thus unquiet.

See how contrary our corrupt reasoning of the flesh is, to the wisdom of
the holy Ghost.

Admit this, thou have just cause to be offended, to complain of thy brother,
in regard of some injury done to thee, yet behold and consider how the holy
Ghost has cut off that which thy crooked and corrupt reason is ready
thereuppon to infer, that because thou have just cause, therefore thou may
show thy self violent and reuengefull; and carry in thee a distempered mind,
no, no, says the holy Ghost, if thou have a quarrel to thy brother, thou art
to forgive him, and then is the fit time to forgive thy brother, when thou have
just cause of offense given thee from him, think on it whosoever thou art,
that art ready to follow the crooked rule of thine own reason, and remember
that though thine own wisdom tell thee that thou having just cause of
offense, thou may show thy self violent and reuengefull, yet the word of
God, by which one day thou shall be judged, has taught thee otherwise.

And again:

Note.
If thou always deal with thy brother, as thou have just cause, surely, thou
may look the Lord will not remit any thing of the rigor of his justice
toward thee, and then thy case is most miserable, thou art then but a child
of perdition.

Remember it, and be stirred up even then to forgive thy brother, when thou
have just cause to complain of him, for some injury by him offered unto thee.

Come we now to the argument enforcing this duty of forgiving one another
from the example of Christ in these words (Even as Christ forgave you, even so
do ye.

These words for the meaning of them need not long to be stood on,
Interpretation.
only we are to examine how Christ forgiueth us; and touching that, know we
that Christ may be considered two ways. Either as a Medidiator God and man in
one person, and so he satisfied for our sins, and procured remission of the
sins of all Gods chosen, and he it is by whom, and through whom, or for whose
sake, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians 4.12. They have forgiveness of sins.
Or as God the Son, the second person in the Trinity, of the same essence
with the Father, and so does he properly forgive sins, according to that
assertion of the Pharisees, not denied by Christ, Mark 2.7. None can forgive
sins but God only. So the meaning of the Apostle in saying, as Christ
forgave you, is, as if he had said, as God in Christ for gave you, which
agrees with that, 2 Corinthians 5.19. God was in Christ and reconciled the
world to him self, not imputing their sins unto them.

Now first, here we see the argument laid before us, is from the example of
Christ, that we are to forgive one another, as Christ has forgiven us. I
might hence take occasion to speak of our imitation of Christ in general, but
that is not so proper to this place: only know we thus much.

That the actions of Christ are of three sorts. Christ his actions are of 3.
sorts.
First, such as are proper to his Godhead, as In two sorts of actions we are
not to imitate Christ.




Wherein we are to imitate Christ.
in obedience to the moral Law only, are we to follow Christ, and to tread
in his steps.

And therefore it is but a a fancy and dream of the Papists, that we are to
imitate Christ A Popist. fancy touching imitation of Christ.
in his 40. days fast, it is but a vanishing speculation of their own
brains. I leave them, and come to speak of that which is more proper to these
words, and for concluding of the point; we are to consider these words, Even
as Christ forgave you, euenso do ye, together with that, Ephesians. 4.32.
Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake forgave you: or this text
as before we expounded it, As God in Christ forgave you.

Hence we may easily gather,

Remission of sins once granted, remains for ever.
it is unchangeable.

For why? God forgiues sins, and he forgiues in, and through Christ, even for
Christ his sake, remission of sins comes from Gods free grace and love, and it
comes in, and through the son of his love, Cap. 1.13. and his love in Christ
never changes, and therefore remission of sins is most certain and
unchangeable.

Comfort to such as are assured of the pardon of their sins.


Have thou any assurance of the pardon of thy sins? remember it then to thy
comfort, that remission of sins comes from God, and it comes to thee through
Christ, in whom he is well pleased, and that for ever; and therefore the
remission of thy sins remains for ever.

Yea, may some say, remission of sins once granted,

But for answer to it,

Mark further, that the Apostle does not only urge us to forgive one another
by the example of Christ, but he does also press upon us to forgive, as
Christ has forgiven us, (Even as Christ forgave you, even so do ye.) Which
word (as) does not import Equali^ tie, but Similitude. We are to forgive one
another as God in Christ has forgiven us. I might here run into a large
field, but I will only point at some things briefly.

Hence we are taught.

We must freely forgive one another.
we are not to forgive upon condition or consideration upon the suite of
friends, upon the importunity of the party or the like, but freely and without
any by-respect, as God has forgiven us, yea we are to be like to God,
especially in this, in forgiving the whole offense and injury.

That which God forgive, he forgiues wholly and never after imputes it, so are
we to forgive our brethren, not carrying a piece of an injury vnforgiuen, not
reserving in our minds part of a wrong till afterward,

The fearful state of such as do not wholly forgive their brethren
discovered.
Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors, we most fearfully pray
against our selves; do thou open thy mouth, and call to the Lord to forgive
thee, as thou forgiuest thy brother, and do thou reserve a piece of thy
malice against thy brother? Surely thou do beseech the Lord to reserve a part
of his wrath against thee, and that is a fearful thing, that thine own mouth
should so call for vengeance to be powered down upon thy self, the least part
of his wrath is able to crush thee, and to press thee down to the bottom of
hell. Think on it, and as thou desire that the Lord should wholly forgive
thee, so do thou fully and wholly forgive thy brother: let not thine own tongue
be so dreadfully used against thy self.

VER 14. And above all things put on love which is the bond of perfection.
Our Apostle having exhorted to tender mercy, etc. Verse 12. and showed verse
13. wherein meekness and long suffering are to be expressed: in this 14. and
15. verses following, he goes on further to exhort the Colossians two other
virtues by comparison (namely to Love in this verse, and to peace the fruit of
love in the verse following.

Here therefore he exhorts them to put on love, and that not simply, but by a
comparison with the forenamed virtues, even to put on love, as a more excellent
and precious virtue then any before named, or as the uppermost, and so the
fairest, richest, and most precious piece of the new clothing, And above all
these things, says the Apostle, put on love.

Then he does further amplify his exhortation by a description of love,
setting it out by the excellent use of it, that it serves as a bond, that it is
the bond of perfection; That is the general matter of this verse.

Come we to examine the words touching the true sense and meaning of them
(Above all these things) that is, above all these forenamed virtues, Put on
love. Interpretation.
The Apostle does here still continue his Metaphor, taken from the clothing
of the body, and he compares love to the uppermost garment, that it is to be
put on with, and above all the rest of the clothing, and his meaning is with
all other virtues, put on love, and that principally, as the uppermost garment,
and chiefest part of that glorious vesture of the new man, and by love we are
to understand, love to our brethren, love of one another, (which is the bond of
perfection) the word here translated (bond) signifies not such a bond as does
tie one thing to another, but properly such a bond as does cowple, conioine,
bind, and unite many things together, and is to be rendered (couple, or
conjunction) bond of perfection, that is, according to the true and natural
signification of that word (of integrity) or as I may say, of wholenesse: for
it signifies the wholenesse of any body, either natural, moral, or civil,
when any body is a complete and whole body, consisting of all the parts of it,
then it is a perfect body.

Now the integrity or wholenesse here spoken of, is to be understood with
relation, both to the virtues before spoken of, and to all other Christian
virtues and duties that pass from man to man, which altogether make as it were
one perfect body, and with relation to the body of the Church, consisting of
diverse members, that love is the couple, conjunction, and knitting together of
all Christian virtues and duties of man to man, and making them as it were one
perfect body, and conioining also the members of the Church one to another, and
making them on whole and perfect body, cowpling together the members of the
whole Church, yea conioining the members of every particular Church, yea of
every society in the Church, that is the meaning of the Apostle when he says,
Love is the bond of perfection.

Thus then we are to conceive his meaning in the words of this verse, as if he
had said.

And with these, and all other virtues and duties that pass from man to man,
put on love one to another, as the most excellent part of that glorious vesture
of the new man, which love does unite and knit together all Christian virtues
and duties that pass from man to man, making them as one perfect body, and
cowpling together all the members of the whole Church, yea, the members of
every particular Church and society, and so perfecting the whole Church,
making it a perfect body, and perfecting every particular Church, yea, every
society in the Church. Now, first note with me in a word, that the Apostle
does here exhort to put on Love as a part of the new man.

Hence it is clear.

our brethren a right, no certainly, True Christian love of our brethren is
not in us by nature.
true love of our brethren is a renewed affection, whereby we are moved to
wish, speak, and do well unto them.

It is reckoned as one of the fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. and 1. Tim. 1.5.
The Apostle says, it comes out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and
of faith unfeigned; and indeed the will and affections must be changed before
there be any place for true love.

And this meets with that error of the Papists, who teach It is a Popish error
that the first act of love is in us by nature.
and that we have in us by nature an inclination to love both God and men, and
that only the second act, or exercise of love is from grace. This is but their
conceit, it cannot stand with the evidence and truth of the word of God in this
text, and in many other places.

And again this teaches us,

That we can never love our brethren truly and aright as we ought till we be
changed and renewed by the Spirit of God. We can never love our brethren as we
ought, till we be renewed by the Spirit of God.


A natural man may love others, in respect of the honor, profit, or pleasure
he receives from them, or the Lord by his special providence may dispose the
heart of a natural man to affect others, yea, to do good to them as it is
said, Daniel 1.9. God brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the
chief of the Eunuchs, and Nebuchadnetzar showed him great favor and highly
advanced him, Dan. 2.48. But a natural man can never truly and aright affect
others, and love them in the Lord, Note.
and as they bear his image, that is only the work of the Spirit of God; and
therefore if we would truly love and affect our brethren, we must labor to be
renewed.

Observe in the next place, that the Apostle exhorts to put on love, not
simply, but by comparison, with the virtues foregoing, as a more excellent
grace, then any of those forenamed, he says (Put on love above all) put on
love chiefly and principally, above all these.

Where first we see, that love stands in comparison with such graces and
virtues as have relation to men, and have their use in Christian life and
conversation amongst men, that in respect of such graces and virtues, love is
to be put on above them all, as a more excellent grace.

Hence we are given to understand thus much.

Love is more exellent then any of those graces that have relation to men.
and have use in Christian life and conversation among men; love is not more
excellent, neither is it here nor any where else in Scripture, simply
preferred above all graces whatsoever, (for in Gods sight and acceptance,
faith excels it, not in any dignity in it self, but in respect of the object
of it) so I say, love is not more excellent then any other grace whatsoever,
but its the chief grace and virtue in Christian life and conversation, and
more excellent then any of those graces that have relation to men.

How we are to understand the high commendation of love in the Scripture.
(namely) not as the form and life of faith, as the Papists teach falsely and
erroniously, but as the most excellent grace among those that have relation to
men, and have use in Christian life and conversation.

Cor. 13.13.





In that the Apostle does exhort, to put on love above all these, and other
graces that have relation to men, we may easily see thus much laid before us.

for faith works by love, Gal. 5.6. and love is the most excellent grace that
comes from faith. Love of our brethren is a most precious fruit of faith.


And hence is it that the Apostle Peter 1. Pet. 4.8. agrees with our Apostle,
and does second him in his exhortation, and says, above all things have
fervent love among you, he preferres love before all other graces, and that
justly, for indeed without love, what duties soever we perform to our
brethren are nothing worth as the Apostle shows plainly and at large, 1. Cor.
13. and the Lord himself does so account of love to our brethren, that if a man
were ready to come to his immediate worship, he is content that duty to him
should rather be left undone, then that the duty of love (should be neglected
to our brethren) as our Savior teaches plainly, Mat. 5.23.24 if thou bring
thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother has ought against
thee, leave there thine offering before the altar, and go thy way, first be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. I might be large
in setting forth the excellency of that worthy grace of love one to another,
but I choose rather to seal the consideration of the excellency of it upon our
hearts, and to make use of it to our selves, in that love to our brethren is so
excellent a grace.

We must learn to esteem it, We must esteem love to our brethren as a most
excellent fruit of faith, above all other virtues that have relation to men.
and to breath after it as the most excellent fruit of faith, we are fallen
into that age of the world our Savior foretold, Mat. 24.12. wherein the love
of many is grown cold, and no doubt this amongst others is one special reason
of it, men have not that hie esteem of love to their brethren as they ought,
they account it not as the most excellent ornament, and to be put on above all
other virtues that have relation to men, most men do esteem the love of their
brethren but as a base thing, yea an argument of an abject and base mind to
put on love with the properties and fruits of it mentioned, 1. Corinthians
verse. 13. as not to disdain and not to be provoked to anger, yea are there
not some who make the least account of it of any thing to bear true love to
their brethren? Happily they have many other good qualities, they are sober,
wise, judicious and able to give good counsel, but as for true love to their
brethren, they have no dram of that, and they make no reckoning of it, yea
they esteem it nothing to carry in their hearts the contrary, even hatred,
malice, heart-burning against their brethren; too many such there be in the
world, and therefore we have need to be taught this lesson, and often to hear
of it, that we are to esteem love of our brethren as the most excellent
virtue amongst those that have relation to men.

Motives to stir us up highly to esteem of love to our brethren.
And to settle this in our hearts, let us often think on that before spoken,
that without love all other virtues and duties performed to men are nothing
worth.

2. And again, consider that our Savior makes it the very character, badge,
and cognizance by which we may be known to be his disciples, John 13.35. by
this shall al men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another, by
this you shall make it clear to the world that you are my disciples, let these
things be often thought on, that the consideration of them may work it into our
hearts, even highly to esteem of love, to account it as indeed it is that
grace, amongst those that have relation to men, that does most grace and
commend us, and so to follow after love, 1. Cor. 14.1. and to labor to put on
love above all other graces whatsoever.



That love must be as the clothing of every one of the graces before spoken
of, yea of every grace, virtue, and duty that passes from man to man, every
grace, virtue and duty of man to man must come from love, and must be
apparelled in the habit of love. Every grace, virtue and duty that passes from
man to man must come from love and must be clothed in the habit of love.


For why? the virtues before named,

The use then of this point is this.

We are to look that all our virtues that have reference to men, be clothed
in the habit of love to our brethren. We must look that all our virtues that
have relation to men, be clothed in the habit of love to our brethren.

Two motives to that purpose.


Art thou pitiful, kind etc. look that thy pity and kindness be cladde in
the garment of love, put on that above them all, and whatsoever good duty, thou
do in thy general or particular calling, let it be done in love, and to
help us forward in this duty, consider we only these two things.

First, the graces here named. and the like may in the use of them be
profitable to others without love, but never will they be comfortable to thine
own soul.

Again, consider that many good duties bring not that fruit to others that
they might, being not done in love, because they want the blessing of God on
them; for example, a maniustly corrects his child or servant, not in love, and
for the good of the child or servant, but out of his distempered humor,
respecting the satisfying of his own irefull and furious mind, or having an
eye only to his own profit, or the like, that duty is not blessed, to the
child or servant, but they still remain as careless and retchlesse as ever
they were before, I might instance in many other parculars, but to shut up
all in a word, do thou desire that thy pity, thy kindness, and thy
humbleness of mind, should be comfortable to thy self, and that duties done
by thee should bring forth fruit and profit, then look that they all come
from love, and be clothed in the habit of love, and to end with the words of
the Apostle, 1. Cor. 16.14. Let all your things be done in love, that so they
may bring comfort to our selves, and we may find the blessing of God on them.

(which is the bond of perfection) we see an excellent use of love to men laid
before us, True Christian love to men, is as a bond, knitting together the
members of the Church and all Christian graces, virtues and duties, that pass
from man to man.
that it serves as a bond, knitting together the members of the Church, yea,
knitting together all Christian graces, virtues and duties, that pass from man
to man, making them as it were one perfect body, love is the bond of that
near conjunction of the members of the Church one to another, and it is the
bond of fellowship and communion that is between them, it makes one member
partaker of the graces and gifts of another, and that which is wanting in one
member, is supplied by the use of that grace and gift that is found in another
through love, and so love serves as a bond, knitting together the members of the
Church, and knitting together all graces and gifts found in them, as into one
body, fot howsoever the gifts and graces found in the members of the Church,
Note.
are all for the good of one another, and every member has right and title to
them, and may challenge an interest in them all, there is not a grace or gift
in any one member of the Church, but another that wants it, has right to it,
in the use of it, as the Apostle teaches plainly, 1. Corinthians. 3.21.22. All
things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or
life, or death: whether they be things present, or things to come, even all are
yours, as if he had said, what gift or grace soever is bestowed on Paul, or
Apollos, or Cephas, you may challenge it as your own in the use of it,
howsoever I say this is true, that whatsoever gift or grace is in one member of
the Church, another member that wants it, has right to it, in the use of it.

Yet without love, the gifts and graces that be in the members of the Church,
are not used for the good one of another, the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 8.1,
knowledge without love puffs up, and it is true of other gifts of the like
kind, arts, wisdom, etc. that without love they are not used for the good of
others, but it is love that edifieth, it is love that makes them profitable,
and rightly applied, for the building up of the body of Christ, and so love
both knits together the members of the Church, and makes the graces and gifts
that are in the several members profitable.

Yea, love does so conioyne the graces and gifts of the several members in the
use of them, as if they were all in one man, and so makes as it were of
several graces and gifts a perfect body, Act. 4.32. it is there said that the
multitude of believers, were of one heart, which no doubt was through love, they
were so nearly conjoined by love one to another, as if there had been but one
heart and one soul in them all.

And so without question, the gifts and graces that were in them severally,
were by love so knit together in the use of them, as if they had been all in
one heart, and in one soul, and so by love made as it were one perfect body:
which is an excellent use of true Christian love to men.

To draw this to some profitable use.

First know we that there is an imputation commonly A popish imputation
commonly cast upon our Church removed.
that we strippe true love to our brethren, and the duties of love, of all
good use in the Church of God, yea, that we hold them unprofitable and
unnecessary for Christians.

And why so?

Forsooth, because we ascribe not to them the merit of our justification in
Gods sight, see the wilful blindness of such as are devoted to their own
pleasing conceit, they doat so much on the merit of love and good works, as
they cannot (or at least will not) see any other use of them, but that which
must needs shoulder out Gods grace and the merits of Christ, we willingly
acknowledge that profitable and necessary use of love of others here
specified by the Apostle, that it serves as a bond of integrity or
perfectness, even to knit together the members of the Church, and to make the
gifts and graces that are in the members of the Church, as one perfect body,
and in their use as profitable as if they were all in one heart, and in one
soul.

How highly we esteem of Christian love and the duties of it.
Yea, we esteem of Christian love, and the duties of it, as the beaten high way
to eternal life, as testimonies of obedience and thankfulness to God for his
mercy, as illustrations of Gods glory, as means of much good to our brethren,
as proper marks of true Christian profession, as necessary antecedents of the
promised reward of eternal glory, as infallible evidences and proofs, of
remission of sins, and fruits ever following a lively, sound, and saving
faith.

Who then sees not, that most excellent and precious is the use of love, with
as many amongst us, as know and embrace the truth, and truly savor the things
of the spirit of God, and therefore it is but a cauilling slander of our
adversaries, to say we deprive love, and the fruits of it, of all good use in
the Church of God, and make no reckoning of them.

For the use of this point to our selves, is it so, that love to our brethren
is as a bond, knitting together the members It is for want of love that men are
distracted and drawn asunder one from another.
as one perfect body?

It is then a plain evidence, that it is for want of love, when men are
distracted, and some are carried one way, and some another, yea, it is want of
love, which makes us amongst our selves so loose and so uncoupled one to
anther, that we are as a body out of joint in many things, it is the want of
love, that makes us start asunder one from another on every trifling occasion.

We are to acknowledge that, our want, and to bewail it, and to stir us
up to entertain true love, one to another, and where it is to increase it.

Consider I beseech you, this excellent use of it, The excellent use of love to
our brethren is to be considered.
that it serve to join us together as one man, true love will make us speak
and think one thing, yea, it will make us help one another, care one for
another, comfort, council, and encourage one another in good things, and to
use all the good gifts bestowed on us, for the common good one of another, as
if they were all in one man.

And let us know that any society without love, Note.
is but as a tottering wall of stones, cobbled up together, without mortar or
binding, and so easily shaken, and soon ruinate and thrown down.

And again, remember that true love to our brethren, is not only taught by
precept, but it is inwardly implanted in the hearts of all true believers by
the Spirit, as the Apostle says, 1 Thessalonians. 4.9. touching brotherly love, ye
need not that I should write unto you, as if he had said, as natural
brethren (not degenerating and growing out of kind) are taught by nature to
love one another, so you, to whom God harh given his spirit, are taught of God
to love one another.

Let us then besides the excellent use of love one to anther, remember this,
that as many as are true believers have learned of the spirit of God to love
one another, and if we have not learned this lesson, surely we are not yet
taught of the spirit of God, we have not yet received the spirit, and having
not received his Spirit, we are none of his.

Observe with me in the next place, that the Apostle calls love (the bond of
perfection) he says not put on love, which is perfect, but which is the bond
of perfection, hence we True Christian love is not perfect in it self, but it
is the bond of perfection.


That love that is in true believers, and ought to be put on by them, is not
perfect in it self, but the bond of it, true Christian love in the members of
Christ is not a perfection of love but it is the bond of perfection in the
sense before showed. Confutation of the conceit of the Familists.
(indeed the gross abusers of love) who bear themselves much on this text of
the Apostle, and conclude that because the Apostle says here, love is the
bond of perfection, therefore there is a perfection of love in the regenerate
in the time of this life.

A mere device of their own brain, this text will not warrant such a
conclusion, it is far from the meaning of the holy Ghost.



Why, the Scripture is pregnant and plain for it, do we not read, 1. Ioh.
4.17. herein is that love perfect in us, that we should have boldness in the
day of judgment. And again verse 18. there is no fear in love, but perfect
love casts out fear, for fear has painfulnesse, and he that fears is not
perfect in love, Phil. 3.15. Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus
minded.

I answer them.

Note.
such as is seated in every power of their souls, and in every part of their
bodies, and that is a perfection of parts, but they have not in them a perfect
measure and degree of any part of holiness, nor an holiness in any power of
the soul, or part of the body, perfect in the measure of it, and so no
perfection in degrees, for as the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 13.9. The most
regenerate know but in part, and therefore their love, and other graces that
are in them, are proportionable, they are but in part, not perfect in the time
of this life.

But for answer to that place, 1 John 4.17. on which the

First, they can never euince and prove it, that in that place by love is
meant that love that is in us, that love we bear either to God or man: but
rather by love is there meant Gods love to us that are true believers, which is
said to be perfect in us, in regard of the effect of it, in regard of the use
and comfort of it, shed abroad in our hearts, for John says, verse 16. We
have known, and believed the love that God has in us, (or toward us) and
then he goes on still, (no doubt) speaking of the same love, and says, Herein
is that love perfect in us; but admit that John there speaks of that love that
is in us, either toward God or men, and he calls it perfect love, What then?
Will it thereupon follow, that there is an absolute perfection of love in the
regenerate, in the time of this life, and such love as has no defect in it?
No, no, their light brains deceive them, if they so imagine. For by perfect
love understanding it of that love that is in us, he means such love as is
true, found, and unfeigned, opposed to that which is hollow and hypocritical,
and thus we find the word (perfect) expounded Isai. 38.3. Where Hezekiah
says, Lord remember me now, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with
a perfect heart, where we may easily see that by perfection of heart, he
understands truth and sincerity of heart, and so in this place by perfect
love is meant sound, true, and unfeigned love, and such love casts out fear,
even all slavish fear.

The Familists therefore cannot fasten it on this or any other place of
Scripture, that there is in the regenerate, in the time of this life, an
absolute perfection of love, we are to renounce it as a fantastical conceit
of such as are deluded by the Spirit of error.

There is yet another sect (I mean the Papists) who abuse this description of
love, and gather from it a false conclusion. They gather that because the
Apostle says, (Love is the bond of perfection.)

It is a false conclusion gathered from hence by the Papists, that we are made
perfect by love, and justified by love in Gods sight.
That we are made perfect by love, and justified by love in the sight of God.
But this cannot stand with the true meaning of this description. We showed
before it is thus to be conceived.

That love serves as a bond to knit together all Christian virtues and duties
that pass from man to man, as it were into one perfect body, its a bond of
perfection in respect of those virtues and duties that have relation to men,
and therefore it cannot be rightly hence gathered, that love is of use to make
perfect in the sight of God. That conclusion is built on a sandy foundation,
and a misconstruction of the Text; but grant this unto them which they are
never able to prove, that true believers have a perfect measure of love, yet
can it not justify them in the sight of God; for justification in Gods sight
stands, partly, in the remission of sins, and partly, in righteousness
imputed, or as the Papists say, inherent righteousness.

Now perfect love in degree cannot procure remission of any one sin, that is
no part of Gods promise annexed to his covenant of works, he says not, do
this and thou shall live, and if thou do it not, but break my Law, by perfect
love thou shall satisfy for that breach. No, no, the condition of perfect
obedience in the moral Law propounded, once broken, there can be no
compensation, or satisfaction, but by punishment, either in the person
offending, or of some other in his steed; without question the active obedience
of Christ was most exact and perfect, yet was not that perfect, legal, and
meritorious obedience of his sufficient to procure remission of sins, but he
must over and besides that, suffer death, even the cursed death of the Cross,
and bear in his body and soul, the extremity of Gods wrath, before he
could satisfy Gods justice for the sins of his chosen; and therefore it is
said, he bare our sins in his body on the tree, 1. Pet. 2.24. We may then
safely stand on this against our adversaries, that it is not love (admit it to
be most perfect) that can justify us in the sight of God: because it cannot
procure remission of the least sin.

VER. 15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are
called in one body, and be ye amiable.
In this verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colossians to an other virtue,
namely to peace the fruit of love, and to this also he exhorts, not simply, but
by comparison, that they should have peace in them, and that it should be as a
ruler, and bear principal sway in them, and this exhortation he does further
amplify, First, by the author, or kind of peace, that it ought to be the peace
of God. And

Secondly, by the proper seat where it ought to rule, namely, in their hearts.



And his exhortation being thus propounded, he does further strengthen it, and
urge it on the Colossians by weight of argument, taken from the condition of
their calling, that they were called to this peace, expressed more clearelie in
those words, (in one body) wherein also is implied an argument, to persuade
them to it, that they were called unto it as members of one body. Last of all
for the better entertainment and continuance of this peace, he requires of
them that they should be amiable: and so the sum and substance of this verse
is, 1 An exhortation to peace, and that, a peace of God, and that it ought to
bear rule in their hearts. 2 Backed and strengthened by an argument taken from
their calling, that they were called unto it as members of one body. 3 And then
further amplified, by requiring another duty serving for the continuance of
that peace, that for the better entertainment and continuance of it, they
should be amiable, or grateful one to another.


Come we to speak of the exhortation in these words. And let the peace of God
rule in your hearts.

Interpretation.
By the peace of God, the Apostle means not that peace that God himself has,
and in which he lives, but that which he communicates to us; and that is
twofold: the first is that peace we have with God, arising from faith, touching
our reconciliation with God, in, and through Christ, whereof the Apostle
speaks, Romans 5.1. Being justified by faith we have peace toward God through
our Lord Jesus Christ. And Philip. 4.7. The peace of God which passes all
understanding, shall preserve your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus, but this
peace is not here meant: the other peace, is that which we have, or ought to
have with men, namely, that concord and good agreement, coming from love,
which we ought to have one with another; and of this the Apostle speaks in
this place, as may easily appear, both by the context, and by the scope and
drift of the Apostle in this place.

Now this peace is called the peace of God, because God is the author of it,
both commanding it in his word, and working it in us by his holy Spirit.

(Rule in your heart) The word here translated (Rule) properly signifies to
rule after the manner of a Judge, or an vmpire, it is taken from the custom of
the heathen, who in their public games of wrestling, or the like, had some who
sat as Judges, and did rule and order the runners or wrestlers, and gave to
them that did best some rewards; and the Apostles meaning is, let the peace of
God prevail over all your evil affections, which stir you up to discord and
dissension, and let it bear sway, and have chief command of them all, and
keep them under.

Thus then we are to conceive the meaning of this exhortation, as if the
Apostle had said.

And let that concord and good agreement coming from love, which you ought to
have one to another, commanded by God in his word, and wrought in you by his
holy Spirit, have the chief sway, and prevail over all your evil affections,
by which you are stird up to discord and dissension, let it be as a commander
over them all, and keep them all in subjection. Now here, first we are to
mark, that the Apostle calls the peace to which he exhorts, being that peace
that is, or ought to be amongst men, the peace of God, or Gods peace, (says
he) Let the peace of God, even that peace that has God the author, commander,
and worker of it, rule in your hearts.

Hence it is clear.

That true Christian peace, and good agreement amongst men is, as well as true
Christian love, a work of Gods spirit; ^^e Christian race is a fruit of Gods
spirit.
and indeed the Apostle reckons it up amongs^ the fruits of the Spirit, Gal.
5.22. And therefore men ^e not truly peaceable by nature, neither is their any
^rue peace, save among such as are truly sanctified.

Let it suffiice only to have named that in a word, the point more clear
hence offered is this.

The peace and agreement we hold one with another must be Gods peace, even such
a peace as is approved of by God in his word.
must be Gods peace, even such a peace as has God the author of it, such a
peace as is commanded and approved of, by God in his word; and that we err not
in conceiving this point, thinking that, a peace commanded and approved of God,
which is not.

Know we further more particularly, that the peace and agreement we are to hold
and embrace with men, it must be joined with truth of religion, Note.
and with holiness, it must be a peace thus qualified, even a peace going
hand in hand with truth and holiness.

And hence it is, that the Apostle, Romans 12.18. does exhort to peace, not
absolutely, but with condition of possibility. If it be possible (says he)
have peace with all men. Where he means not, a possibility of fact, as if he
had said, if it be possible, if it may be done and brought to pass, if you
may by any way, or means, have peace with all, (for their is possibility of
peace, unlawful) but he means a possibility in respect of right and
lawfulness of fact; his meaning is, if it be possible, and so as you may
lawfully, regarding good conscience, if you may have it so, as may stand with
holding true faith, and religion toward God, and so as you may still continue
in the true fear of God, and holiness, then have peace with all, Heb. 12.14.
says the holy Ghost, follow peace with all men, and holiness, without the
which no man shall see the Lord.

Where we see a manifest limitation of peace, we must have peace with all men,

with men, must be joined with truth of religion and holiness: we have then
good and sufficient warrant for our refusal of a pacification with the Papists
in respect of religion, We have sufficient warrant for our refusal of a
pacification with the Papists in respect of religion.
we have good reason for it, not to make peace with them, nor to consent with
them in regard of religion, because peace with them in that respect, would not
be Gods peace, the peace that is of God, must be peace in truth and holiness,
and we must remember that Christ, he is the way, the life, and the truth; and
therefore to have contention with such as hold not the truth in him, is no
breach of peace. Isa. 59.4. We read that the Lord calls for contention, yea he
was angry that none would make dissension, in taking part with the truth. No
man (says he) contendeth for the truth. It is the opinion of some, that there
might be a pacification between us and the Papists in respect of religion, if
there were on both sides but a little yielding: its true indeed, by yielding
their is some likelihood, and a general possibility, but no lawful
possibility of peace between us, because (as they grant) there must be a
yielding on both sides, but that we may not admit on our part, because the
religion we hold and profess, is the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles,
grounded on the truth of the word of God, from which we may not swerue on
hairs breadth.

Again, it is so, that the peace we hold with men must Our peace with men and
our agreement with them must not be in profaneness and sin.
Then take we knowledge of it, that our peace and agreement with men must not
be as commonly it is in the world, a peace and agreement with them, in
profaneness and sin, a drunken peace, commonly called, good fellowship. No,
no, that is not a peace of God, but the Devils peace, and we are to be
enemies, and at utter defiance with such peace, we have David's example for it,
Psalm. 49.16. says David there; Who will rise up with me against the wicked, or
who will take my part against the workers of iniquity. Where we see he vtters
a voice of dissension, if ever there were any, yea that which one calls the
foame of dissension, David is so far from joining hands with the wicked in
their sin, as that he proclaims a partaking against them, and his example must
we follow, it must befarre from us to join hands with the wicked and profane
men in their sin, yea in respect of their wickedness and profaneness, I
dare be bold to affirm, we are to be contentious with an holy contention, not
with bitterness and brawling, as Jeremy cries out, Ier. 15.10. Woe is me, my
mother, that thou have borne me a contentious man, and a man that strives with
the whole earth, which was in respect of the wickedness of that time. Let then
the world charge such, as in zeal to Gods glory, and in a Christian care to
discharge the office of true friends do reprove others, happily their
neighbors for their gross sins, and tell them of their swearing, cursing,
and such like; let, I say, the world tax them to be troublesome men, and busy
bodies, and such as no man can live in peace by, yet let them still go on in
that duty, and know its not only lawful, but their duty, to contend with
profane persons, and in respect of their wickedness, to be contentious with
them: the peace we are to hold with men, must be Gods peace, even such as is
joined with holiness and good conscience.

Observe we in the next place, the Apostle says not, let the peace of God be
in you, but let it rule in you: the duty hence offered is soon gathered,
namely this.

The peace of God, an holy, and religious peace, must not only have place, but
a principal place in us, it must be a predominant and ruling peace. Now the
word (Rule) as we know) is a word of relation, it has respect to things ruled,
and the things, an holy peace must rule and order, are our evil lusts and
affections, that stir us up to discord, and dissension, as pride, envy,
covetousness, and the like, and so the duty is thus to be conceived.

We must carry in us such a peace as is able to keep down We must carry in us
such a peace, as is able to ouerrule all our evil lusts and affections,
stirring us up to discord.
and dissension, we must have in us a peace so strong and so powerful, as
neither pride, envy, covetousness, nor any other evil lust or affection,
shall be able to prevail, or to break out with any contention.

And the reason and ground of this is given, Iam. 4.1. the Apostle there shows
by the contrary, that where peace does not rule, there our evil lusts and
affections,

That peace ought so to rule and command our evil lusts, and affections, as
they shall not be able to fight in our members, nor to break out into iars and
contentions.

Now if this duty be duly considered we shall find that Reproof of such as
are defective in this duty.
Do not the common brawles, and needelesse contentions that are amongst men,
plainly show it, that peace is not predominant in them? when men are at
difference and contention one with another, are they not hardly drawn to peace
or any agreement? as the common saying is, a Bear might as easily be drawn
to the stake, as many men to union and good agreement, when they are urged unto
it, does not then their pride, their envy, or some other evil lust or
affection work within them, and so far prevail, as they will not be
persuaded to it? And what is this, but a plain demonstration, that holy and
religious peace bears no rule in them, but they are ouerruled by their own
evil lust and affections, and they fight in their members.

Well let us take notice of that which is amiss in us, and We must labor to
find such a peace in us, as is able to keep under all our evil lusts and
affections, how we may attain unto it.
as is able to keep under all our evil lusts and affections, and to that end
carry in thee a love and desire of peace, for they that have no desire to it,
can neueuer have it to rule in them.

And again, search thine own heart, and find out that lust that is the
chief cause of contention in thee, labor to dispossess thine heart of that,
and to stir thee up to this, remember only this one thing.

If peace and good agreement with men, rule not in thee, certainly thou have
no true peace with God, and if thou have a settled peace of heart toward God,
of necessity thou must be at unity and peace with men, this will ever follow on
the former.

If then thou desire assurance of thy peace with God, labor thou to get such a
peace with men, as has the command over all thy evil lusts and affections.

The Apostle says, let the peace of God rule in your hearts: The proper seat
of true peace is the heart.


Hence note we further,

That the proper seat of holy peace is the heart, it is a small thing to have
peace in our mouths and tongues, when we have war in our hearts, for so may
hypocrites, as the Prophet complained, Ierem. 9.8. yea, a man may be kept from
discord and contention, outwardly by restraining grace, but if peace rule in
the heart, that is a work of Gods Spirit.

Come we to the argument the Apostle does here subioin to his exhortation, for
the enforcing of it on the Colossians, together with the amplification of it in
these words (to the which ye are called in one body) the argument as we may
easily see, is from the condition of the Colossians, that they were called to
peace as the members of one body, and therefore ought to entertain it, and to
have it ruling in their hearts.

The amplification is as we showed, by requiring of them another duty serving
for the better entertainment and continuance of peace, namely, that to that end
they should be Amiable or grateful (to the which) that is to say,
Interpretation.
to which peace of God before spoken of (ye are called) that is to say, ye are
bound by your calling, as you are Christians, and called to the profession of
the Gospel, for when a man is said to be called to any duty, thereby is not
only signified that it is lawful for him to do that duty, but that by his
calling he is bound to the performance and practice of it (in one body) that
is, as the members of one body, being gathered and knit together, by the spirit
of God, as members of one body under one head, Christ Jesus (and be ye
amiable) that is, according to the true and proper signification of the word,
be ye grateful or thankful, which is not to be understood (as some would
have it) with relation to God, as if the meaning were, be ye thankful to
God, for of that the Apostle speaks afterward verse 17. and here he entreats
of duties that pass from man to man, and are to be performed of man to man: it
is therefore to be understood with relation to men, be ye grateful or thankful
one to another, as well in conferring as in requiring of benefits, thus then
conceive we these words, as if the Apostle had said.

Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for why, it is a duty you are bound
to, as you are called to be true professors of the Gospel, gathered and knit
together by the spirit of God, as members into one body, under one head Christ
Jesus, and that you may better entertain and continue this peace among you, be
ye grateful one to another, as well in conferring, as in requiring of benefits.
First, we are here to mark that the Apostle does urge peace on the
Colossians, and persuade them to it, by an argument taken from their Christian
calling, that they were called to it, in that they were Christians, and
professors of the Gospel, and therefore ought to have it ruling in their
hearts: whence we may easily see.

That the remembrance, and confideration of our Christian calling and
profession, ought to sway and prevail with us, to move us to holy duties.
This generally might be stood on, but we have often had occasion to speak of
it, and therefore we will keep to the particular here urged by the Apostle,
hence then we are taught thus much.

Christians and professors of the Gospel, are bound to peace and go^d
agreement one with another, by their calling an profession.
our calling and profession of the Gospel and Christianity, does or should bind
us to the peace of God, an holy and religious peace, is a duty to which we are
called, a duty that belongs to us, in respect of our Christian calling and
profession. For why. True believing Christians and professors of the gospel,
are called to be children of God, and he is the God of peace, the author of
holy peace, not of discord, The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall ly with the kid, and the calfe, and the lion, Isa. 11.6.
and the fat beast together, and a little child shall bind them, meaning that
in the kingdom of Christ, the gospel should make the most mighty, fearce and
cruel, even as lions and wolves, and such like, put off their woluish and
lionlike nature become mild, gentle and peaceable, yea, true Christians are
called by to have interest and title in the covenant of grace which is also a
covenant of peace, they are called to have peace with God, and peace with their
own conscience, and therefore without question holy and religious peace with
men is a duty to which they are bound, and belonging to them in respect of
their Christian calling, and this being clear, let us think on it, to this
purpose; is it so, that an holy and religious peace, with men is a duty that
belongs to us in respect of Christian calling? certainly, then it must needs
follow that such as are at jar, discord, and dissension with others, offend
against Christian calling, and not only neglect Such as are at jar and
discord with others, offend against Christian calling.
and contrary to it, and so doing, their case and condition is most fearful;
such as do any thing either without the compass of their particular and
personal calling, or against it sin, grievously, and bring themselves in
danger of all Gods judgments, for men have assurance of Gods protection, only
so long as they keep themselves within the ways of their callings, Psalm.
91.11. if they go out of them, they bereave themselves of Gods protection, and
lay themselves open to all his plagues and judgments; yea, the text is plain,
Mat. 24. that the Lord at the day of judgment will deal severely with such as
shall be found at his coming, either neglecting the duties of their callings,
or doing contrary, verse 51. it is said, he will then cut off the evil
servant, and give him his portion with hypocrites, there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. If this be the case of such, as either neglect the duties of
their personal callings, or do the contrary, how fearful then is the case
of such as not only neglect, but do the contrary to the duty of their
general calling of Christianity and profession of the Gospel, which is more
excellent then all particular callings? surely, we must of force confess
their case to be most fearful, art thou called to peace with men? is peace a
duty that belongs to thee, in respect of thy Christian calling? do thou not
only neglect that duty, but practice the contrary? art thou found at jar, at
discord and dissension with others? surely, then thou lie naked and open to
all the fearful strokes of Gods punishing hand in this life, and if the Lord
should take thee away (as thou have no assurance of thy life, one minute of an
hour) if the Lord should take thee away in thy brawling and contention, then
woe to thee, it had been better for thee thou had never been borne, without
the extraordinary and unspeakable mercy of God, thy body then falls to the
ground, but thy soul goes down into hell.

Oh that such as be at dissension and discord with others, had hearts to
consider this, would they then go on in their brawle^ and contentions? would
they then carry themselves like lions or bears, and happily please themselves,
in their beastlike nature and behauior? I am persuaded if hell have not taken
full possession of them, they would not, this day, before to morrow, they would
seek to be reconciled, and to have peace with all men, therefore consider it
seriously.

That peace with men is a duty of thy calling, as thou art a Christian. And if
thou be found in that which is contrary ^o it, in discord and dissension, thy
case is most fearful, and lets us all consider, how unworthy and unbeseeming
our high and excellent calling it is to give our selves to contention and
debate, let them that are not called to peace contend and make debate, as for
us the condition of our calling will not bear it, either we must renounce
contention, or else disclaim the calling of Christians.

Mark we further, the Apostle says, not only let the peace of God rule in
your hearts, to which you are called, but he adds further in one body, more
clearly expressing it, how they were called to peace (namely) as the members

Christians are to have and to hold peace and good agreement one with another,
as members of one and the same body.
That Christians are to have and to hold peace, concord and good agreement one
with another, as members of one and the same body, for indeed they are one
body in Christ, and every one, one another members, Romans 12 5.

We find this duty propounded in these terms, in many places of Scripture,
Ephesians. 4.3. the Apostle having exhorted to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace, he ads this as one special reason and ground of it,

Let it serve as a ground of further exhortation to peace and good agreement
one with another, The consideration of this, that we are members of one body,
ought to be most effectual to move us to good agreement one with another
many reasons might be brought to move us heereunto, as our conjunction in one
nature, country, place, habitation, law, liberty, and religion, all which are
of great weight, to move us to have peace and good agreement, but above all,
this is of greatest weight, and most effectual, that we are members of one
body, for the very light and order of nature, teaches the members of the same
body, to be at peace one with another, what member of the body falls out or
disagreeth with another, no man yet ever hated his own flesh, Ephesians. 5.29, we
cannot give instance or example of any, well in his wits, that did ever hate or
hurt his own body, or that any one member of a man's body, was at jar and
discord with another: if then the consideration of this, that we are members of
one and the same body, move us not to live in peace and good agreement, it will
convince us of sin against the light of nature, yea more, even of sin against
the light of grace, in that the holy Ghost has revealed it to us, that we are
knit together by one spirit, one faith, and one hope of salvation, let then the
consideration of our near union into one body, under one head, Christ Jesus,
move us to peace and good agreement, if it do not, surely it argues we are
none of the members of that body. Now here a question Abraham did with
Abimelech, Genesis 21.32. Isaac with Abimelech, Genesis 29.31. but in respect of
religion, we may not make peace with the enemies of the Church, for that were
to join light and darkness, truth and falsehood, which can never stand together.

Come we to the last thing here required of the Colossians (and be ye amiable)
I will not handle this as a duty standing by it self, but as here it stands in
relation to peace, being here required by the Apostle, as a means of better
entertainment and continuance of peace, and so the point hence offered, is this.

An effectual means either to procure peace, where it is not, or to continue
it where it is, is gratifying one another by mutual benefit.
where it it is not, or to continue it where it is, is gratifying, and
pleasuring one another by mutual benefits, by conferring and requiting of
benefits.

This will best appear by particulars, as it is a notable means either to
procure or to continue peace by sending gifts and presents one to another, they
commonly prevail whersoeuer, or which way soever they go. A singular example
we have in the gifts and presents that Jacob sent to Esau, he says, he sent
the^, that he might find favor in his sight for the procuring of peace, and
agreement between them, as gifts of pacification, and the Lord gave a blessing
to that end; so likewise lending one another money, household stuff, and things
needful, Ephesus did Paul to the ship, Our money and other outward good things
are not only to be put to necessary uses, but also to be used for procurement
and continuance of peace and good agreement with one another.
Act. 20.30. inuiting one another to our tables and such like, are notable
means, both to procure and to continue peace and good agreement, we read Jude
Epist. verse 12. that Christians in the Apostles days, had their love feasts,
which were for the test^fying and continuance of their love and unity.

The use of this, teaches us not only the lawfulnes of these things, that we
may lawfully send presents one to another, but it teaches an excellent use
that is to be made of our money, and other such things, that they are given us,
not only for our necessity, and to provide us food, or to show our liberality
but also to win and keep the good affection of our brethren, and for procuring
continuance of peace and concord with the^ and let us look that among other
uses, we make this one principal use of our riches, and outward good things,
and abilities; worldly goods commonly part friends, as they did Jacob and
Laban, Ge. 31. through our corruption they are means of strife and disagreement,
and the very matter of the greatest cotention; but they that so use them (as
one says well) the time will come when they shall wish, they had never gone
further then the shouell, or spade. We must so use them, as they may be means
of peace and concord, and then, no doubt, we shall find the blessing of God
upon them, and comfort in the use of them, when we stand in most need of
comfort.

VER 16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisdom,
teaching and admonishing your own selves, in Psalms, and Hymns of spiritual
songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord.
The Apostle from verse, 5. of this Chapter to this 16. verse has exhorted the
Colossians, both to the mortifying, and putting away of such vices and sins,
as are forbidden in the second Table of the Commandments and to the putting
on, and taking to themselves such virtues as are there required: and having
ended that his exhortation; In this 16. verse, and in this 17. verse. following,
he exhorts them to the duties of the first Table, as to diligent study of the
word of God, to invocation, and calling on God in the name of Christ, and to
thanksgiving.

This verse for the dependence of it, has reference and respect to matter
foregoing, on this manner.

The Apostle having exhorted the Colossians plentifully to sanctification,
as well in putting off the old man with his works, as in putting on the new
man with his parts.

To the end they might do these things, in this verse. he exhorts them to a
familiar acquaintance of the word of God.

That, to that end they should have the word of God as a domesticke, as a
dweller with them, and familiar unto them.

In this verse considered by it self, we have these things laid before us.

Colossians, that the word of Christ should be a dweller among them.



Let the the word of Christ dwell in you plentifully in all wisdom.

Colossians the use of the word of Christ dwelling among them, that they ought
to make a double use of it, even thereby to teach, and to admonish, both
themselves and others: teaching and admonishing your own selves.

in Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual songs.

Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, and having made mention of Psalms,
and hymns, and spiritual songs, the matter of their mirth.

Singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord.

So then the sum of this verse is, The argument of the verse.
An exhortation to the Colossians, to have a plentiful measure of the word of
Christ, familiar to them, and so as they should be able wisely to use it for
the instruction and admonition of themselves and others; yea, to make use of it
in their mirth showing forth their mirth in singing after an holy manner, in
Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual songs, singing with a grace in their hearts
to the Lord.

Come we to the words of this verse, and first of these words (Let the words of
Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisdom.) The word of Christ does in
special signify the Gospel, the doctrine of grace and reconciliation with God
in, and through Christ.

But here it is to be taken in a larger sense and signification, even for the
whole written word of God, Interpretation.
that being given by inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3.16. and profitable to the
uses here limited, and specified, to teach and to admonish. Now the whole
Scripture is called the word of Christ, both because he is the author of it,
for he it was that spoke by Moses, and the Prophets, it was the Lord Christ
that sent Isaiah the Prophet, as may plainly appear by conference of Isaiah,
6.9.10. and Ioh. 12.40.41. and so he sent other Prophets successively time
after time: and because he is the matter and end of the whole Scripture, John
5.46. Moses wrote of him, as Genesis 3.15. and in the ceremony of the Paschall
Lamb, in the type of the Tabernacle, the Arc, all Sacrifices, the brazen
Serpent; yea, the whole Scripture propounds Christ to us the only mediator and
Savior, and to him is the whole Scripture referred as the end of it, Romans
10.4. He is the end of the Law, etc. And again, Gal. 3.24. The Law was our
Scholemaster to bring us to Christ, and does lead us to Christ; and for these
reasons is it that the whole Scripture is called the word of Christ, (dwell)
the word here translated (dwell) properly signifies to inhabit, or dwell as a
domesticke, as one of the same house,; it is a Metaphor taken from such as
dwell under one and the same roof with us, who who are best known to us, and
most familiar with us, and the Apostles meaning is, that the word of God should
be as well known and familiar to us, as he or she that dwells with us in one
and the same house, (in you) that is, amongst you; let it dwell amongst you,
and be familiar to you, (plenteously) that is, in abundance and great
measure, (in all wisdom) that is, in true and sound wisdom; it is usual in
Scripture to put the note of universality (all) to signify excellency,
perfection, truth, and soundness. And the wisdom here spoken of, is not the
wisdom of the word it self, but the wisdom that ought to be in them, to
whom the word is familiar; and the Apostles meaning is, that they should be
wise in the understanding and use of the word, being familiar to them, that
they should wisely understand it, and wisely use it.

Thus then we are to conceive these words, as if the Apostle had said.

Let a plentiful measure of the written word of God be as familiar, Meaning of
the text.
and well known to you, as a dweller with you in one and the same house, so as
in true wisdom you both understand it, and use it. Obseru.
We are here to mark first of all, that the Apostle having exhorted the
Colossians, to the mortification, and to the putting away of sundry vices,
Verse. 5.
as fornication, uncleanness, the inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,
and covetousness which is Idolatry, and to the putting on and practice of many
virtues, as tender mercy, kindness humbleness of mind, Verse. 12.13.14.15
meekness, long suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another,
and above all, love, which is the bond of perfection and peace.

He now comes to exhort them to have the word of God familiar to them, as a
means to make them able to practice that, to which he has hitherto exhorted.

And hence we may take this conclusion.

That the only effectual means serving for the mortification and putting away
of sin, and for the putting on, The only effectual means serving for the
mortification of sin, and for the putting on and practice of virtue, is the
word of God.
and practice of virtue, is the word of God, no other thing is able to make us
truly to abstain from sin, and to practice virtue, but only the word of
God.

Moral precepts of Philosophers and wise men, a good name, good company, good
education, good examples, and such like, though they be excellent things, and
of excellent use, yet they are not able to do this, to make us truly to
mortify sin, and put on, and practice virtue, only the word of God is able
to do that. And hence it is, that our Savior praying for his Apostles, and
all other that should believe in him, through their teaching: he says, Ioh.
17.17. Sanctify them with the truth, thy word is truth. And Ioh. 15.3. Ye are
clean (says he) through the word which I have spoken unto you. Psalm. 119.9.
David having propounded the question; wherewithal shall a young man redress his
way, as if he had said, wherewith shall a man most unbridled, untamed, and
unreformed, come to be bridled, tamed, and reformed: he presently answers
himself, even by no other thing, but by the word of God, which is a plain
proof of this point, that the word of God is the only powerful means that
serves for the purging out, and putting away of sin, and for the putting on
and practice of virtue.

The reasons of this are plain.

First, only the word of God pierces into the hearts of Heb. 4.12.

Secondly, nothing is able to make that which is spoken of sin, and of the
putting on and practice of holiness.

The Papists are no such friends to good works as they would make men believe.
they pretend that they are most zealous of good works, and such friends to
holiness of life, as none are like them, and they cry out against us as
enemies of good works; but indeed, if we duly consider the matter, we shall
find none greater enemies to good works, and true holiness then they, insomuch
as they take order that there may be no familiarity or acquaintance betwixt
the people, and the word of God; for they straightly forbid the people to read
the word of God, or to have it in their mother tongue: it is the word of God
that is the only effectual means to work true mortification and holiness,
and will they bar the people from that, and yet pretend that they are the
only friends and favorers of good works? Is any so simple that sees not
their deceit? And who cannot easily discern, that their practice is in flat
opposition, and contrariety to their word? I leave them, and for use of the
point to our selves.

If a man would be sure that he is truly mortified, and made truly holy, he
must look that the word of God has wrought it in him.
Then if thou desire to have sin truly mortified in thee, and to be renewed,
and to be made truly holy (without which, thou shall never see God to thy
comfort) never rest till thou be sure that the word of God has wrought in
thee a mortification of thy sin, and a measure of holiness; thou may come
to have a show of mortification, and holiness, by other means, but true
mortification and holiness is only wrought in thee by the word of God; and
therefore never rest till thou find that the word of God has been powerful
in thee to that purpose.

of my sin, and to work holiness in me? I abstain from sins, yea, I can
name particular sins to which heretofore I have yielded, but now I abstain
from them, am not I then mortified?

Answer:

First, if thou came to the sight of thy sins by the Law of God, Romans 3.20.
By the the Law comes the knowledge of sin. And

Secondly, by the affection both to the Law, and to thy sin, if thou love
the Law of God, even because it discovers thy sin, and the more it
discovers thy sin, the more thou love it, as David did, Psalm. 119.143.
And if thou hate thy sin principally, because God hates and forbids it, and
not in any sinister respect.

These are sure notes that the word of God has been effectual to work in
thee a mortification of thy sin, and never rest till thou find these things
in thy self.

The next thing we have to mark is, that the Apostle calls the written word
of God, the word of Christ) Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenteously,
etc.

Hence it is plain that Christ speaks to us in the written Christ speaks to
us in the written word of God, and in every doctrine there expressed, or there
gathered by necessary consequent.
either plainly expressed in the written word of God, or thence gathered by
necessary and good consequent, that doctrine so expressed, or so gathered, is
the word of Christ; our Savior says, Luke 10.16. to the 70. Disciples, he
that hears you hears me, and he that despises you, despises me. The
meaning is not; Whosoever hears man called to teach, hears me simply,
whatsoever he teaches, but so long as man teaches Gods word.

And that appears planely, John 14.26. Where Christ promises, that his Spirit
should suggest, and bring all things to the minds of hi^ Disciples, and their
followers; and he adds, which he had told and taught them, and not any new
doctrine and revelations. So long then as the Doctrine is either plainly
expressed in the written word of God, or thence gathered by good and necessary
consequent, it is the word of Christ, and so to be heard and received of us as
the word of Jesus Christ.

The vanity of such as rest upon revelations, besides the written word of God,
discovered.
thou must know, whosoueuer thou art, that thy revelation besides the written
word of God, is not the teaching of Christ, nor suggested by his spirit, but by
the spirit of error, even of the Devil, and the word and doctrine of Christ,
is the doctrine, either expressed, or agreeable to the written word of God.

It is worth our marking, that the Apostle calls his preaching, the
ministration of the Spirit, 2. Cor. 3.8. to teach us, that the word and Spirit
ever go together, the Spirit shines in the word, and the word is powerful by
the Spirit, and we must be taught of God, but it must be by the word, and
therefore deceive not thy self by any new vision or revelation, besides the
written word of God.

Mark we further, the Apostle exhortes that the word of God should be as one
dwelling with us under the same roof, as familiar to us, as a home-dweller.

Hence arises this duty.

We must be as well acquainted with the word of God, as with an home-dweller.
as one that we meet sometimes in public, but as one of our own house; we
must be as well acquainted with the word of God, as with one that does dwell,
and converse with us every day, and lodge with us every night, that as we
know one with whom we are familiarly acquainted, not only by face, and can
call him by his name, but we know him inwardly, and we are acquainted with his
nature and disposition, and with the very purpose of his heart, so we must be
acquainted with the word of God.

Not only knowing the face and sentence of the Scripture, but the inward
purpose and meaning of the holy Ghost in it, especially in the plain places of
it, and such as contain things needful to be known to salvation, Pro. 7.3.
Solomon exhorts us to bind the instructions of wisdom and her commandments,
upon our fingers, and write them upon the table of our hearts, to have them
even at our fingers ends, and verse 4. say unto wisdom, thou art my sister,
and call understanding thy kinswoman, be as familiar with the wisdom of God
revealed in his word, as with thine own sister, 2. Tim. 3.15. Paul says,
Timothy knew the holy scriptures of a child, and therefore doubtless they
were very familiar to him.

And must the word of God be thus familiar to us, even The Papists deal
injuriously with their people, in forbidding them to look into the word of God.
How injuriously then deal the Papists in not suffering their people to have an
insight into it? they say, the people are not without special license to look
into the word of God, but they must receive all things from their teachers on
their bare words, not reasoning or asking any question more then the horse
asks his rider why he turns him this way or that way, but simply obeying.

Now what is this, but directly to cross and contradict the spirit of God? but
they object

Some through their own corruption abuse the reading of the Scripture,

That is a deceitful kind of reasoning.

Reproof of them to who^ the word of God is a stranger.
as one of our own house? then thousands in the world, come within compass of
just reproof, are there not thousands to whom the word of God, is as a
stranger? they know no more the voice annd face of it, then of any they never
saw before, they are ignorant not only of the sentences of Scripture, but even
of the examples of it, which of all things are most easy, yea, of the
principal and fundamental points taught in each book, a fault that cannot
sufficiently be taxed especially in these days, and let ignorant persons take
knowledge of it, and learn to reform it, and never rest thou till thou be
familiarly acquainted with the word of God, and to that end be diligent in
hearing, reading and meditating in the word of God, and join thereunto
conference and prayer, content not thy self to meet with the word in public,
but be acquainted with it at home, turn over the leaves of the book of God
in thine own house, yea, take away sometime from the works of thy calling to
bestow in reading of the Scripture.





Motives to stir us to up a diligent reading and attending to the word of God.
And to stir thee up to this duty, consider only these two things.

First, there is no true comfort to be found in anything in time of trouble,
but in the word of God, Psalm the 119. and 50. David says. it was his comfort
in trouble, if men in trouble be not able to comfort themselves out of the
word of God, either they wring their hands, tear their hair and despair,
or else they do use some unlawful means, for indeed if men know not God in
his word, they know not his mercy, truth, love, and goodness, and what
comfort can they then find in their troubles?

Again, consider that prayer brings a feeling, and the sacraments a confirming
only of that comfort thou have in the word, if thou have no comfort in the
word prayer brings no feeling, nor the sacraments a confirmation, of any thing
but judgment and damnation, yea, know it for a truth, the Apostle has said
it, Romans the 2. and 16. thou shall one day be judged by the word, and if the
word of Christ acquit thee, Christ will acquit thee, and if his word
condemn thee, certainly thou shall never be saved,

And therefore think on these things, if thou desire to find comfort in thy
trouble, if thou would have prayer bring feeling, and the sacraments a
confirming of comfort to thee, and if thou would stand before the judgment
seat of Christ, at his coming, with comfort, then make the word of God thy
friend and familiar.

True friends will draw near to comfort us in distress, when strangers will
fly from us, and if the word be a stranger to thee, and thou to it, what
shall be able to comfort thee? surely nothing, and therefore never rest till
thou be familiarly acquainted with the word of God, post it not from thee to
scholars and Divines, no, no, if thou look for comfort in life, in death, in
the day of judgment: labor thou in plentiful measure to be acquainted with
the word of God.

And touching the measure of the word that ought to be familiar to us expressed
in the word (plenteously) only note we thus much, our Apostle says not, let
the word of Christ dwell fully or wholly, neither yet let a such a portion,
such a quantity or measure of the word dwell with you, and no more, but he
speaks indefinitely, and says, let the word of Christ dwell in you
plenteously, be familiarly acquainted with a plenteous measure of the word of
Christ not expressing how much.

Hereby teaching us.

That howsoever we cannot come to a familiar acquaintance with the whole word
of God, that is not possible Though we cannot be familiarly acquainted with the
whole word of God yet we must not content our selves with a stinted measure of
knowledge in Gods book.
and think that when we have gotten so much knowledge in the word, we have
then enough and then set down our rest, no, we must labor by diligent
reading, hearing, and other good means, to come to as much knowledge in Gods
book as possibly we can, the more holy knowledge we have in that, We must
go on from one measure of knowledge to another.
and the better stored with other sanctifying graces of the spirit, yea, the
more and greater will be our comfort in any time of need.

The next thing that comes to be considered, is the manner how we are to be
familiarly acquainted with a plenteous measure of the word of God, namely in
(all wisdom) (that is) so as in true wisdom, we both understand it, and use
it.



That we may come to understand the word of God, even truly and wisely to
understand it, We may come to a true and wise understanding of the word of God.
else this exhortation of the Apostle had been vain.

Indeed the word being a lantern to our feet, and a light unto our
paths, Psalm 119.105. and speaking to us as to children, Hebr. 12.5, that is
easily plainly and familiarly, we may doubtless come to the understanding of
it, yea, the simplest man or woman may come to be instructed out of the word
of God in all points of faith and manners needful to be known to his or her
own salvation Psame 19.7. the testimonies of the Lord is sure, and gives
wisdom unto the simple, and Psalm. 119, 130 the entrance into thy words,
shows light, and gives understanding to the simple, for howsoever it cannot
be denied, but there are many things in Scripture hard to be understood, yet
whatsoever is necessary to be known is plainly set forth in the Scripture,
and easy to be understood of such as with care and conscience use the means.

The Papists lay an hardness and obscurity on the Scripture, Confutation of the
Papists, laying an hardness and obscurity on the Scripture.
and hold that the Scripture, in what language soever,

There is no doubt, but the Lord purposing to reveal his will to man by the
Scripture, has caused them to be written in such sort, as man may without any
just cause of doubting understand them aright, at least so much of them as is
needful to be known to salvation, that being the very end on Gods part, in
writing of them as appears plainly, Ioh. 20.31.

These things are written that ye might believe, that Jesus is the Christ the
SON of GOD, and that in believing ye might have life.

Now the duty which these words (in all wisdom) do charge upon us, is this.

We must look that our familiar acquaintance with a plentiful measure of the
word, be in true and sound wisdom, Our familiar acquaintance with a
plentiful measure of Gods word must be in true and sound wisdom.
we must be wise both in the understanding and use of the word, if we be able
to carry in mind, and remember many sentences or examples of Scripture, which
we have heard or read, and they are familiar unto us, we must look that we
wisely understand them, and wisely use them.

And if you ask me wherein stands that wise understanding,

I answer,

First in a right understanding of them.

And secondly, in a right use of them.

As a man is said to be wise and well seen in any art, when he is able not
only to repeare the rules of that art, but he does rightly understand them,
and can make a right use of them, so we are wise in the understanding, and
wife in the use of the sentences, examples, and rules of Scripture, that are
familiar to us, when we rightly conceive them, and rightly apply them, when
we understand them according to the true meaning of the Holy Ghost, and when
we make a right and good use of them, and are bettered by them, and especially
in two respects.

First, when we thereby inform and build up our selves in things most
important, and of greatest weight concerning us, as we are Christians, as in
faith, the fear of God, love to God and men, and true comfort both in life and
death, and to that end make choice, and spend most time in the study of such
places, and sentences of Scripture, as serve most to that purpose.

And secondly, when we thereby inform our selves in things and duties that
most concern us and our particular callings.

The reason and ground of this duty is, because howsoever the word be in it
self, the will and wisdom of God revealed, yet to us it is not so, being by
us misunderstood, or used amiss, that is only the good and profitable word of
God to us, that is of us rightly understood, and rightly used, especially so
used, as that thereby were inform our selves in things most important, and in
duties that most concern us in particular, and therefore we must be wise in
understanding the word aright, and in using it aright, especially to inform us
both in things that concern our eternal good, and to make us wise to
salvation. 2. Timoth. 3.15. and to inform us in our particular and personal
duties, 2. Timoth. 2. we find that the Apostle having exhorted Timothy to
be constant in undergoing the labors of his ministry, and in bearing the
troubles and afflictions attending on it, verse the seventh, he says,
consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things, as if
he had said, hear not these things without consideration, understand me
aright, and the Lord give thee, that thou may both rightly understand, and
make a right use of the things I have now spoken, that concern thee for thine
own good, in thy place and calling, 1. Timoth. 1.1.4. Paul biddes Timothy
command some that they give not heed to Genealogies, which says he are
endless, and breed rather questions then godly edifying, which is by faith.

Teaching us plainly, that when we look into the book of God, we are to
make a difference of things, Note
and not to spend much time and study in things of less importance, but
rather to labor that we may wisely understand, and make use of things that
tend to our edification and comfort, and so to be wise in the right
understanding and use of the word, being familiar to us, as we may be bettered
by it in things most weighty, and such as concern us in particular.

Now this duty rightly conceived, serves to check and Reproof of sundry sorts
of men.
in the world, as namely, all such as abuse the words and sayings of holy
Scripture, to make themselves and others merry, such as make jests of
Scripture phrase, such as adulterate and make merchandise of the word of God,
2. Corinthians 2, 17. thereby seeking their own advancement in the world, and
their own gain, such as turn it to Allegories, or such as pervert and wrest
it for the maintenance of any error, and of that sort there be thousands in
the world: in reproof of these I will not stand, but consider we this duty, as
it may with more profit concern our selves; and if we duly consider it, we
shall find there be two sorts of men that are thereby justly to be taxed. Two
sorts of men justly taxed.


First, some there be that are acquainted with many places of Scripture, they
can be plentiful in quotation, and in citing of them, but it is, either for
their own delight, in some curious question, tending rather to strife then to
edification, or for the holding of some false conceit of their own, as that
there is an absolute perfection of holiness in time of this life, that the
Sabbath is ceremonial, or such like.

Again, some there be, and those are more common, that are very expert in the
duties of other men, and when they hear or read of them, they can say, there
is a good lesson for such a one, but as for the things that concern
themselves, either for the information of their judgments or for the good
ordering of their lives, they have little or no care to be acquainted with them.

Is this to be wise in the understanding and use of the word? no, no, if the
word were familiar to thee in true wisdom, thou would rather inform thy
self in those things that most concern thy self, and thine own place and
calling, then in the duties of others, yea thou would We must remember this,
that we are to be wise in the understanding and use of the word of God, to the
bettering of us.
so as thou may be bettered by it in things most important, and such as most
concern thee in particular.

Now here happily some may say.

I desire to be wise in the understanding and use of the word, even to be
bettered by it in things most weighty, and concerning my self in particular,
but how shall I come to that true wisdom?

I answer thee, the means to come to it, 3. means to come to a wise
understanding and use of the word of God.
are especially these.

First, thou must bring with thee to the reading or hearing of the word the
fear of God, for to them that fear him will the Lord reveal his secret, and
his covenant, to give them understanding, Psalm 25.14. the Proverbs 9.10.

Secondly, thou must bring with thee an humble mind Note.
and not suffer thy mind and judgment to be informed by it, Psalm. 119.130.
The entrance into thy words shows light, and gives understanding to the
simple, that is, not to such as have no wit, nor discretion at all, but such as
are lowly in their own eyes, and abase the pride of their own wit, to the
wisdom of Gods Spirit, and thou must ever make one place of Scripture agree
with an other, for there is a sweet consent of Scripture with Scripture;
therefore read not one sentence alone, but the whole context and compare the
like places with it.

The last and chief means, is prayer to the Lord, that David a man according
to Gods own heart prayed at least 10. Psalm. 119. for the teaching of God in
the understanding of his Law, much more ought we to do so.

And if thou be careful to use these means then no doubt, thou shall be wise
in the understanding and use of the word, and be bettered by it in things that
concern thy good in this life, and for ever in the life to come.

And to stir thee up to the practice of this duty, know thus much.

There is no comfort (as we heard) in-time of trouble but in the word. Now the
word of comfort, the sentences of Scripture full of sweet comfort, which thou
art able to repeat, is no comfort to thee, unless thou be wise in the
understanding and use of it, for as one says well, the word of God foolishly
understood, Note.
is not the word of God to him that so understands it, and therefore bring thou
to the hearing, or reading of the word of God, true fear of God in thine
heart, lay aside all proud conceit of thine own wit; be careful to make one
place of Scripture agree with another, and have recourse to God by prayer, that
he would open thy understanding and wit, and then doubtless thou shall have
the word of God familiar to thee in true and sound wisdom, and then shall thou
wisely understand it, and make true use of it.

Come we to the use of the words, dwelling with us plenteously, here urged by
the Apostle in these words (teaching and admonishing your own selves.)

Interpretation.
(Teaching) that is, instructing, or informing the mind in knowledge,
(admonishing) that is, reproouing for that which is amiss in life and
conversation, (your own selves) the word may be expounded one another
mutually, and so the meaning is briefly this, Informing one another mutually
in knowledge, and reproving one another for things amiss in life and
conversation.

The point hence offered is this.

To teach and to admonish b^longs not to Ministers alone, but even to all that
profess Christ.
though his especially, and in peculiar sort it belong to him; but its the duty
of all that profess Christ, they are to teach and admonish one another, as
occasion is offered.

Hebrews 5.12. The author of that Epistle says, for the time, they ought to
have been teachers. 1 These. 5.14. Admonish them that are unruly. If we read,
John ^. from verse 35. to 45. we shall find many examples of this kind; John
taught Andrew, and another of his Disciples: Andrew instructed Peter; likewise
Jesus, Philip; and Philip, Nathaniel. And so it is clear, that we ought to
teach and admonish one another; yea, private persons may sometimes instruct
teachers in some things in private: examples we have, Act. 18.26. Poor Aquila
and Priscilla instructed eloquent Apollos: the text says, Whom when Aquila and
Priscilla had heard they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of
God more perfectly, we see then our duty. Now this duty is little thought on,
or practiced.

Where is almost that man or woman that has care Reproof of such as care not
to teach and admonish others upon just occasion.
the most have no care to teach or admonish them, that be under their charge,
much less others: well this is our duty, and learn we to make conscience of
it.

Again, is this a duty of private persons, to teach and We are to profit by
the teaching and admonition of private persons.
when this duty is performed to thee by a private person, thou art to profit
by it, say not thou as commonly profane persons use to say, when thou art
justly admonished of some sin by a private person, who made him a teacher? And
what have you to do to control me? Do not so put a stumbling block in thine
own way; know that a private person admonishing, and reproving thee for sin,
justly, and in the spirit of meekness, he is called to it, and it is God that
in him reprooues thee, and it is thy duty to suffer thy self to be admonished
by him, as from the mouth of God, and therefore do not lightly regard his
admonition, but labor to profit by it, as thou will one day answer the
contempt of it, before him that shall judge both the quick and the dead.
When God calls by any means, do not thou stubbornely disobey, and cast away
thine own soul.

Come we to the particulars here expressed, wherein we are to teach and
admonish one another, (namely) by Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual songs,
together with the manner, how we are to use them, as that (for the general)
they are to be song, and for the special manner, with grace in our hearts to
the Lord.

Touching the difference of these three, Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual
songs, not to trouble you with variety of opinions, this is the most received
distinction of them.

Interpretation.
That by Psalms, we are to understand holy songs in general of what argument
soever written, whether peccatorie, and containing matter of petition to God
for good things, or deprecatory, containing matter of petition, for turning
away of evil things, or Consolatory, containing matter of comfort, or
whatsoever, which were wont to be sung to God, and sounded out as well with
instrument, as with voice.

And by Hymns are meant, special songs of praise to God, thankesgiuings to
God for benefits received.

And by Spiritual songs are signified, certain special hymns containing the
praises of God for his noble acts, for his great and wonderful works, which
were wont to be song only with the voice; and such were the songs of Moses,
Exodus 15. of Deborah, and Barack, Judge. 5. and diverse such there be in the
Book of Psalms, which are therefore called songs, and not Psalms. The
Apostle adds (Spiritual) thereby understanding such songs, as proceed from
the Spirit, and are framed by the Spirit, as (namely) such as are, either
already recorded in the word, or composed according to the word, containing
spiritual and heavenly matter. (Singing) what that is we know, uttering them
with a loud tuned, and artificial voice (with a grace in your hearts) (that is)
with understanding and feeling hearts, 1 Cor. 14.15. says the Apostle, I will
sing with the spirit, but I will sing with the understanding also, with minds
understanding what is sung, and with hearts full of heavenly joy, stirred up
and affected according to the matter that is sung (to the Lord) that is, to the
praise and glory of God, therein yielding obdience to God, and with
acknowledgement of all praise, honor, and glory to be due to him.

Thus then conceive we the Apostles meaning, as if he had said, In holy songs
to God of what argument soever, in songs of praise to God for benefits
received, and in songs for his great and wonderful works, those songs being
already either pe^ned by the spirit of God, and found in the Book of God, or
framed according to the word, containing spiritual and heavenly matter,
singing and sounding them forth by the voice, both with understanding, what is
sung, and with hearts full of heavenly joy, and affected according to the
matter that is sung to the praise and glory of God.

Now first, we are here to mark that the Apostle, unto teaching and
admonishing one another, he presently subioines in Psalms, and Hymns, and
Spiritual songs, not limiting the duty of teaching and admonishing only to
Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, but pressing that duty upon the
Colossians when they had occasion to be meery, and did express their mirth by
any good means, that even then they should teach and admonish one another.

Our lesson hence is this.

That the duty of teaching and admonishing one another, the duty of edifying
our brethren, is not to be neglected in time of our mirth, The duty of
edifying one another is not to be neglected in time of our mirth.
when we have occasion to rejoice for the blessings of God, and to show forth
our joy, by singing or playing on an instrument, or otherwise. to express it
by lawful means; we are then even in our mirth, and joy, and meerie meetings
to glorify God,

For if that be a truth (as it must needs be) being spoken by the truth it
self Mat. 12.36. that of every idle word men must give account, then
doubtless of their idle and unprofitable singing, and meery-making, not
tending to the profit of men, nor the honor of God.

And again, it being the Lord that makes us glad, and puts cherfulness
into our hearts, Act. 14.17. There is reason that he and his children should
have the chief, and as it were, the first fruits of the same, and therefore
we are to be mindful of this duty, even in our mirth we are to edify and
do good to our brethren.

This duty much neglected amongst men.
unless they either sit in the assembly of the mockers, as the Prophet speaks,
and which he disclaimed in himself, Ierem. 15.17. I sat not in the assembly
of the mockers. Unless it be, either in scoffing, and mocking, and taunting
of others; or else they break out into profane and unclean speeches, songs,
and daunces, which hurt both themselves and others, and if happily one of
better temper, and more grace tell them, its good to be meery and wise, or
that such mirth as they use is not fitting; What shall be hear from them but
this, or the like speech? He is a precise and melancholy fool, and what does
he in their company, they come together to make meery, and why should they not
be meery, he disturbes them, and hereupon most men think, and stick not to
say it, they cannot be meerie in the company of a Minister, (if he be not a
profane person) or in the company of one fearing God.

We are to practice this duty.
and know it is our duty, even in our mirth to think on the edification of
our brethren, and that duty is not to be omitted when we are most meery.

A motive stirring up unto it.
And that we may be stirred up to the practice of it, remember we that one day
we shall come to be accountable for our mirth, as well as for other things, and
in this respect I may say to thee, whosoever thou art, that in thy mirth do
let thine heart loose to any kind of mirth, and thy mirth tendes altogether to
the dishonor of God, and offense of his children, as Solomon does to the young
man, Eccles. 11.9. Go too, rejoice and be meery, let thine heart cheer thee,
follow the ways of thine own heart, in thy meery-making, lay aside the
remembrance of God, and of all goodness, but know thou that for all these
things, a time will come, wherein thou shall come to be accountant and
answerable for all these things, before the judge of all the world; therefore
think on it, and take heed how thou do demean thy self in time of thy
mirth.

The next thing obseruable in these words is, that the Apostle says, not only
in Psalms, but he adds further, in Hymns, and Spiritual songs.

Where, note we, that the Lord in great mercy, Obseru.
has provided, even for the wearisomnesse of our nature, if we had been tied
to one of these sorts of spiritual exercises, though it were that which we are
most fit for, yet such is our nature, we should have grown dull and weary of
it; the Lord therefore in mercy, has given us variety, that when we are
weary of one, we may take another in hand, but on that I will not further
stand.

Hence we are plainly taught.

That we may lawfully show forth our joy and mirth in Psalms, and Hymns, and
spiritual songs, We may lawfully show forth our joy in singing Psalms and
hymns, and spiritual songs and we may lawfully make choice of Psalms and
spiritual songs so as they fit our present occasions.
its lawful for us (the Lord having given us occasion) to sing Psalms, and
Hymns, and Spiritual songs, and the Lord having given us variety of Psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs, we may lawfully make choice of Psalms and
spiritual songs, and sometimes sing one, and sometimes another; yea, its our
duty to make choice of such Psalms as are most fitting our present occasion,
as we may and ought to come to God, as occasion is offered, with petitions of
diverse sorts, with requests, intercessions, deprecatio^s, complaints, etc. as
the Apostle has taught us. 1. Tim. 2.1. so we may and ought to come to him
with Psalms and Spiritual songs of diverse arguments, fitting present
occasions.

Touching the lawfulness of singing Psalms, I hope, we doubt not, we have
Christ his own example to warrant it, Mark. 14.26. And the example of Paul and
Silas, Act. 16.25. and we have the Apostle James his precept, Ia. 5.13. Is any
meery, let him sing Psalms. But for our choice that we are to sing Psalms
according to present occasion, besides the evidence of this text, read Psalm.
33.3. David there bids us sing to the Lord a new song; and again, he repeates
the same, Psalm. 96.1. and Revel. 5.9. The 24. Elders sung a new song.

David's Psalms fit for us to sing.

David's Psalms are new to us, when we make choice of such as are according to
our new and present occasions, and when we sing them with new affections; for
then though the words be old, yet the song is new to us, in the motions and
affections of our hearts, and therefore we are to make choice of such Psalms
as fit our present occasion, and to sing them with new affections, I grant
indeed, its lawful at times, which we set apart to that purpose, to sing the
Psalms of David from the first to the last, one after another in order, but
yet if the Lord offer new and present occasion, we are then to make choice of
a Psalm fitting the same.

A wrong which the Papists do to the people discovered.
for they restrain and limit the duty of singing Psalms and spiritual songs
only to certain orders of men, and hold it a great offense and sin for the
common sort of people to sing a Psalm to the Lord; yea, they compel the
people under them, to abjure the use of Psalms, which is a most wicked and
injurious thing.

David, yet we are not to sing them hand over head, never considering what are
most fit to be sung, We are not to sing Psalms without regard of present
occasions and without new affections.
as most do, especially in private, thou must make choice of such a Psalm as
is most proper and fit for the present occasion, and sing it with new
affections, and to that end thou art to call to mind, and consider the new
benefits and blessings, the Lord has vouchsafed to his Church, to the place
where thou live, or to thee in particular, and as the Lord does renew his
graces and mercies, either toward his Church, or thy self, do thou renew thy
praises to him again, and that in singing such Psalms as are fit for the
magnifying of his name for these mercies, and though the Psalm or song be
old in regard of the words and matter of it, yet let it be as a new song to
thee in regard of the motions and affections of thine heart, yea, sometimes
when thou art most merry, and have occasion of great joy, in respect of some
outward blessing, as happily the marriage of thy son or daughter, or the
like, then make thou choice, not only of a Psalm wherein thou may praise
God for that mercy, Note.
but at such a time as that, it will be good for thee to sing also such a
Psalm as may serve to temper and moderate thy joy.

Namely, such a Psalm as contains matter of grief and sorrow, thereby both
to put thee in mind, what was or may be in thee, and also, to season thy joy,
with the remembrance of the sorrow of Gods Saints. that is also fitting in
respect of thy self, and thus thou art to be wise in matter of choice of the
Psalms thou singest, for doubtless, to sing Psalms without wise discretion
and choice, and without new affection, when we have new and present occasions,
is a profanation of them, and a taking of Gods name in vain, and what belongs
to them that so do? thou art able to remember the Lord will not hold him
guiltless that takes his name in vain, and if the Lord will not who shall
then free thee from guiltiness and sin?

Mark we further, the Apostle says, in Psalms and Hymns and spiritual
songs, singing them with a grace in in your hearts unto the Lord.

The matter of our singing (if it be a ditty) must be either songs already
found in the word of God, or such as are composed according to the word.
and found in the word of God, or such as are composed according to the word,
it is lawful for us to sing other songs besides Psalms, but our songs must
be spiritual, that is, such as are composed according to the word of God, and
contain spiritual matter.

Hence it is, that the Apostle, before his exhortation, in effect the same with
this Ephesians. 5.19. he sets these words verse the 18. be not drunken with wine,
wherein is excess, but be fulfilled with the spirit, as if he had said, as
drunkards when they are full of wine and strong drink then they use to belch
and bellow out, according to the folly and rottenness of their stinking
hearts, carnal and filthy songs, and rimes, so look that thou be fulfilled
with the Spirit, that from the motion of the Spirit, you may sing songs suitable
to such a moouer, containing matter spiritual and heavenly.



All obscene ribald, and filthy songs condemned.
which are too common in the world, all amorous ballads of love and lightness,
that contain matter of filthiness, and savor of nothing but the flesh, they
are here condemned, and if the use of them, then certainly, the buying and
selling of them is utterly unlawful, Note.
yea, they are more fit for Sodom and the stews, then for a Christian
commonwealth, yet they are commonly bought and sold, and people run after them
with greediness, and what is their plea forsooth, they must needs have
something to pass away the time, and to make them merry, alas poor souls,
their mirth in such things, is but as the mirth of poor prisoners, who happily
are frolic over night, and the next day are brought forth to judgment, are
arraigned, condemned, and shortly after come to be executed: if thou will
needs be merry, let the matter of thy mirth be spiritual, make thy self
merry in singing Psalms and Hymns and spiritual songs, that mirth will bring
sound and lasting comfort, whereas in the midst of the other mirth, the heart
is many times heavy, and the end of that mirth is heaviness, yea, Prou. 14.13.
the songs and laughter of fools (and such are all they that delight in filthy
ribald songs) it is (as the Preacher says, Eccles. 7.8.) but as the noise of
thorns under the pot: it makes a crackling and blaze for a short time, and it
is suddenly gone. oh then, let the matter of thy singing be such as may stir
up spiritual joy in thee, and bring forth such comfort as may last for ever.

In that the Apostle says in Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs singing
with a grace in your hearts unto the Lord, further note we

That as the voice and tongue is one special instrument and means to glorify
God, Note.
and ought so to be used at all times, so chiefly in singing of Psalms.

But I pass from that, and come to consider the manner of our singing in these
words (with a grace in your hearts to the Lord) where first we are taught.

That in singing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, In singing of Psalms
and spiritual songs our hearts must go with our voices.
our singing must not be only with the voice, or rise only from the throat, but
it must proceed from the depth of the heart, we must sing Psalms and holy
songs with understanding, and with an holy feeling in our hearts, our hearts
must be cheerful in singing, even possessed with heavenly joy, and affected
according to the matter that we do sing.

And for further clearing of this, that the exhortation of David Psalm. 33.
serves directly, where he says, sing cheerfully with a loud voice, as if he
had said, sing not only with a loud tuned voice, but with inward affection and
cheerfulness of heart, and that also of the Apostle, Ephesians. 5.19. speaking to
your selves in Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing, and making
melody to the Lord, in your hearss, the word translated (making melody)
signifies making music as with a sweet instrument, thereby plainly teaching
us that when we sing Psalms there must be as well music in our hearts as in
our mouths, yea the chiefest melody must be in our hearts, our hearts must
have a gracious and sweet feeling of that we sing, and it must affect our
souls with spiritual pleasure and delight.



more general.
reason and ground of this duty is this, it is in singing of Psalms as it is
in praying, for many times Psalms and prayer have the same matter, and dif^er
only in manner of uttering Now in vocal prayer there must be a lifting up of
the heart, together with the voice whence it was that Hezekiah bid Isaiah lift
up his prayer to God. 2. King. 19 4. And if the heart be not lifted up,
together with the voice, and moved according to the matter of the prayer,
surely the prayer is but lip labor, whereof the Lord complains, Isai.
29.13. So it ought to be in singing of Psalms, the heart must be stirred up
and ^ffected according to the matter that is sung, else is the singing but
lip labor and displeasing to God, and this condemns that manner of singing,
commonly used among the Papists (namely) their singing in a strange and Singing
in an unknown tongue, and that manner of singing of Psalms, wherein the words
and sentences are broken and divided, is not justifiable.
for how can the heart be affected with, and according to the matter that is
not understood? it is not possible, yea, this condemns that manner of singing
Psalms, wherein the words and sentences are broken and divided, and one
syllable or word is run upon, with so many divisions, as the sense is
darkened, and the singing only feeds the ear with a pleasing tune, but it
fits not the heart with any good affection that manner of singing, though it be
of Psalms and spiritual songs, serving only for the tickling and delight of
the ear, cannot be justifiable by the word of God.

Again, is it so, that in singing of Psalms, our hearts must go with our
voices, and our hearts must have in them a gracious feeling of that we sing,
and according to the matter be stirred up and affected, when we sing Psalms,
and must there be a melody in our hearts, as well as in our mouths.

Oh then take we notice of it, that for the most part our Our failing in in the
manner of singing of Psalms, discovered.
do not we many times, when we are singing of Psalms, either in private or
public, think of nothing less, then of the matter we sing; are not our
hearts, even then wandering after our eyes? yea, are they not many times
ranging and rouing abroad, and far removed from it? and how be our hearts
affected in time of our singing, to instance in some particulars.

Do thou when thou singest, I lift mine heart to thee,
my God and guide most just, Psalm. 25.


Do thou then lift up thine heart and soul to the Lord in heaven? or
rather, are not thy thoughts depressed and kept down by earthly cogitations,
and thou have not so much as a thought of that glorious Majesty? and when thou
singest out of the 19. Psalm.

That the honey and the hony-combe are not so sweet as the Law of God, art thou
so affected toward the word and commandments of God? I fear me in the most
of us, there is no such matter, we sing and sound it out that the word is most
sweet and precious, but in the mean time, our hearts have no feeling of the
sweetness of it, is this to sing Psalms, with a grace our hearts? no, no,
such manner of singing is rather graceless.

Our hearts must be full of heavenly joy, and affected according to the matter
of our singing, when we sing Psalms.
thine heart must go with thy mouth, and thine heart must be full of heavenly
joy, and stirred up and affected according to the matter thou singest, and if
it be not so, surely, then thy singing is but lip-labor, and highly
displeasing to God: that thou may therefore sing with grace in thine heart;
come to that holy exercise prepared, be able to say with David, Psalm. 57.7. my
heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared, I will sing and give praise.



Motives to stir us up to this duty.
nor have their hearts full of heavenly joy in singing of Psalms, it argues
plainly their hearts are not right within them.

And again, as verbal prayers thorough the just judgment of God bring men to
great blockishnesse, so vocal singing, singing only with the voice and not
with the heart will in time bring an exceeding deadness and dullness on men,
that they shall sing only upon custom and fashion, without any feeling at
all, and therefore labor thou to prepare thine heart, and to set thy heart in
tune, when thou art to sing Psalms, that so thou may sing with a grace in
thine heart, even with surpassing heavenly delight, and that thine heart may
be moved and affected, according to the matter which thou singest.

The next thing here required by the Apostle in our singing Psalms is:

That it be to the Lord, singing with a grace in your Our singing of Psalms
and spiritual songs must be only to the praise and glory of God. Reasons
even with reverence to his great and glorious Majesty, and with
acknowledgement of all honor and praise to be due to him alone, for why,
singing of Psalms is a special part of Gods worship, and therefore may not be
yielded to any other but the Lord alone.

And again, to have Psalms sung to him, is a special part of the Lords
glory, which he will not communicate to any creature, man or Angel, no, not to
the humanity of Christ, though that be exalted far above the Angels,
howsoever indeed it is true, that we may sing Psalms to Christ, and call on
him in prayer, yet our singing and praying to him, must be as he is (...),
Note.
God and man in one person, his humanity is not to be worshipped with
religious worship, for it self, or by it self, because by it self it is a
creature, but as it is personally united to the Godhead, and as it is part of
that person which is, true God, so the humanity of Christ is to be worshipped
with one and the same worship, that the Godhead is as appears plainly,
Hebrews the first and the sixth, it is there said, that the Angels must
worship the first begotten son of God, brought into the world, that is,
Christ God and man, (but that by the way.)

Hence it is clear that no part of religious worship is to be given to the
humanity of Christ apart and severed from his Godhead, and therefore Psalms
are not to be sing to his humanity alone, and if not to the humanity of
Christ, then much less to any other creature, and it proves it strongly that
our singing of Psalms must be directed to the Lord and to his praise and
glory alone.

The Papists taxed for singing songs of praise to the Virgin Mary.
as in praying so in singing they offend, little regarding to keep within
compass of this duty, in their mass book we find they have songs of praise
to the Virgin Marie, in which they blasphemously call her their mediatrix, and
say she is placed in the throne with God the Father, and that she reigns with
God, yea they sing to her that she is the mother of grace, the fountain of
mercy, with a number of like praises that they sing to her most wickedly, and
most blasphemously; for there is no mere creature either in heaven or in earth
worthy to be joined with God, and to have any part of divine worship, such as
is singing of Psalms, and spiritual songs, he is God over all, and he alone
is to be magnified and praised for ever.

We must remember to direct our singing of Psalms to the praise of God.
say thou with Moses, Exodus 15. I will sing unto the Lord, who is the
fountain of all the good things I enjoy, when thou have occasion to rejoice
for some blessing of God vouchsafed unto thee, and to show forth thy joy by
singing of Psalms, then sing not to thy self, that is, in thy singing have
not respect neither look thou to thine own wit or pains, as if thine own
wit or pains had been the only cause of that blessing, nor yet to thy
friends and means, to thy fortune, to thy bag or baggage, nor to any other
thing, let no creature rob God of his right, sing thou to the Lord, and
direct thy singing to him alone, even to the praise and glory of his name
alone, who alone is the author and giver of every good gift.

One thing in general may be further gathered from these words, (In Psalms,
and Hymns, and Spiritual songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the
Lord) (namely this) it is clear by this text.

That the exercise of singing is lawful if it be both for matter and manner, as
the Apostle has here set down, if the matter be a Psalm, or a Hymn, or a
Spiritual song, and if it be with grace in our hearts to the praise of God,
then no question of it, singing is lawful. Hence by proportion we may gather,
that playing upon an instrument of music is also lawful; yea, the harmony of
many musical instruments together, is a lawful thing; if it be rightly used,
Playing upon an instrument of music, and the harmony of many musical
instruments together, is a lawful thing if it be rightly used.
and as it ought to be, and that it is lawful, the excellent use of it makes
it manifest, its of use to stir up spiritual joy and cheerfulness in the
heart. We read 2 King. 3.15. that when that great Prophet Elisha saw his
mind, through the zeal to Gods glory troubled in respect of the King of
Israel, he called for a minstrel, and so by means of his playing his mind was
refreshed, and the heat and zeal of his affection was stirred up to speak the
word of God And hence it is, that we use to sing a Psalm before the Sermon,
Note.
it is not a matter of complement to grace the action, but to stir up our
hearts more cheerfully to speak, and hear the word of God; and therefore,
doubtless, music either in singing, or playing on instruments, being of such
excellent use, is a lawful thing and may be used, if it be rightly used, and
that we are especially to look unto, that we use it aright.

Some may say, how is that,

I answer, Answ. The right use of Music.
when we use it to a right end, with moderation and in due season, when we use
it to stir up spiritual joy, and to make us more fit to glorify God, and to
walk in our callings, and when we use it moderately, not making of a
recreation an occupation, not playing to play, (that is) not suffering our
hearts to be stolen away, and snared in the pleasure of our music, and when
we use it seasonably, not using it when we should be otherwise exercised, as in
prayer, in hearing the word, in meditating on that we have heard.

Reproof of those that abuse music.
and justly to be reproved; it is (no doubt) with many of us, as it was with
the people in Amos his time, Amos 6.5. They make David their defense for
music abused; yea, do not many use music, not to stir up spiritual joy,
but to stir up their wanton lusts, tripping and dancing after their music
wantonly, and immodestly; yea, and that excessiuely, even spending whole days
and nights, and that in Tauerns, and like places? Yea, do not many thus use it
on the Sabbath day? What is more common then at our weddings on the Sabbath
day, to do as the people did, Exodus 32.6. To eat and drink, and to rise up
and play, and then to attend to our music, and to dally and dance? Yea, some
think they may lawfully do it when the public exercise is done, then they
think they may follow their dancing and gaming: but know thou whosoever thou
art, that so doing, thou keep a day, not to the Lord, but to the Devil, and
thou do then more dishonor God and hurt thy self, then in any day of the
week besides; remember it therefore, that thou may lawully use music if
thou rightly use it; if thou use it to a right end, to stir up spiritual joy
with moderation and in due time and season; and if thou fail in one or more of
these circumstances thou do abuse it, and shall one day answer for the abuse
of it; yea, without repentance the Lord will judge thee, as that evil servant,
Matthew. 24 49. who is there said, to eat and drink with the drunken, its
lawful to eat and drink, but if men eat and drink with the drunken (that is)
excessiuelie abusing their meat and drink, they shall receive an heavy doom,
so if thou abuse thy music, which may be lawfully used, without repentance
for that sin, thy portion shall be with hypocrites.

VER. 17. And whatsoever ye shall do in word or deed, do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, even the Father by him.
In this verse the Apostle goes on to exhort the Colossians to other duties of
the first Table of the commandments; as to invocation, and calling upon God,
and to thanksgiving in this exhortation, he commends to them a general rule,
reaching to all things not specified before, as if he had said, because it
were infinite to write to you of all things particularly, take this that I now
set before you, as a general rule of al your sayings, and doings whatsoever:
here then the Apostle does urge on the Colossians, this general. That
whatsoever they did, they should do it in the name of Christ who is described by
his title Lord, and by his name (Jesus) and withal the Apostle does specify
and express more particularly what he means by that general, all whatsoever
they should do (namely) all words and all deeds whatsoever (says he) ye shall
do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, and he there stays
not, but he further requires of them, that their sayings and doings should be
with thanks to God (giving thanks to God) and that is enlarged, by showing how
God is to be conceived of them in their giving of thanks to him (namely) not
only as the creator of al things, but as a father, and then by whom as their
mediator they should present and offer up their thanks to God in the last
words, by him (namely) by Christ, and so the sum and substance of this verse
is an exhortation.

To say and do all tings whatsoever in the name of Christ, with thanks to God
the Father, through him the only mediator between God and us. The parts of this
exhortation are these two.

First, that whatsoever we shall do in word or deed, we do it in the name of
the Lord Jesus.

Secondly, whatsoever is done of us, we give thanks to God by Christ.

Come we to the first of these: And whatsoever ye shall do in word or deed,
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, (that is) what business soever ye
shall enterprise, what matter soever ye shall enter upon, and take in hand to
perform. For the word ( do is here extended by the Apostle, Interpretation.
as we see, both to word and deed, and therefore we are to conceive his
meaning largely, and generally, (in word, or deed) that is, either in speech
or action, (do all) do all those businesses and matters in the name of the
Lord Jesus.

Lord Jesus?

Lord Jesus.

(In the name of the Lord Jesus) This form of speech has many acceptions in
Scripture, I will not stand to remember them. Here it does imply thus much,
that what business or matter soever we enterprise, we take it in hand, with
invocation, with calling on God in the name, and mediation of Christ, and that
is clear by the words following, that we are to give thanks to God the Father
by him, (that is) in his name and mediation as appears plainly Ephesians. 5.20.
Thus then conceive we the Apostles meaning in these words. (And whatsoever ye
shall do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.) As if he
had said, The meaning of the text.
What matter or business soever you enterprise, and take in hand, either in
speech, or action, let it be such as you enter upon with prayer, and when you
enter upon it and take it in hand, look that your enterprising of it be with
invocation and calling upon God in the name of Christ.

Now first observe we that the Apostle, Obseru.
here sets before us a general rule according to which, whatsoever matter, or
business we take in hand, either in speech, or action, must be framed, that
whatsoever we do in word, or deed, we must do it in the name of Christ,
even with calling upon God in his name.

Hence presses this point.

That all matters, businesses, and works we take in Every work and business
we take in hand in speech or actio^, must be such as we may present before the
Lord in prayer Reasons.
they must be such as we may present and set before the Lord in prayer, they
must be such as we may crave the Lord his direction, his assistance, and his
blessing in, and upon them through Christ, and whatsoever work or business,
we may not commend to God in prayer, that we may not say, or do.

For why? there is no matter, business or work we may take in hand, but that
we have either express warrant for,

And again, even in matters of businesses of this world, Abraham, Genesis 17.1. I
am God all-sufficient, walk before me, and be thou upright, and therefore,
doubtless, all matters, businesses, and works we take in hand, either in
speech, or action, must be such as we may set before the eye of the Lord, and
offer and present to him in prayer, craving his direction in them, and his
blessing upon them in the name of Christ; it were easy to make this further
manifest.

But for the use, When we go about any matter, or business we are to consider
whether we may comend it to God in prayer, or no, and accordingly to do it,
or leave it undone.
and whenever thou go about any matter, or business, learn then thus to
debate, and thus to think with thy self; is this thing that I go now about
such as I may commend to the Lord in prayer? May this that I am about, be said,
or may this be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, even with thy calling on God
in his name? Surely then, I may take it in hand with cheerfulnes and comfort;
but on the other side, is this I am now about to do, such a thing, as I dare
not set before the Lord in prayer, nor call on him for a blessing in the name
of Christ, or at least, I doubt, whether I may so do, or no? Surely then its
good for me to forbear, and to take heed how I adventure on it.

Oh that men would thus think and reason with themselves, when they are about
to take in hand any thing, either in speech or action, no doubt it would be a
notable means to keep them from doing many things they do amiss, would men
if this were thought on and remembered, would they then take upon them by their
speech to give false evidence and testimony, against an innocent, or to make a
lie for the defense of a guilty person? Would they then enter on their
business, and take in hand works of their callings on the Sabbath day? with
many other things that might be reckoned up: but these are to common amongst
men, and therefore I instance in them, would men, I say, take in hand to do
these and many like things, if they did remember, they are to take in hand
nothing, either in speech or action, but that they may do in the name of
Christ, and may commend to the Lord in prayer, in, and through him? Surely no,
if they had any dram of the fear of God, they would not, and therefore
remember this as a rule of excellent use to guide thee in all things, thou
take in hand, either in speech or action, that which thou may take in
hand, either to speak, or do; it must be such as thou may do in the name
of Christ, and commend to God in his name: and if the thing thou art about to
speak, or do, be such, then go on with boldness, if it be not, take heed
how thou do it; and howsoever it may bring thee in worldly profit, yet
because thou can not commend thy work to the Lord in prayer, thou can not
look for a blessing on that profit, but rather, indeed, the curse of God upon
it; yea, without thy repentance and Gods great mercy toward thee, thou shall
find the curse of God upon that, and that being laid to the rest of thy
goods, even upon all that ever thou have, Habac. 2.9. And therefore ever
remember this, that all matters and works thou take in hand must be such,
as thou may commend to God in prayer, and say, the Lord for his Christ sake
bless them, and give good success unto them.

The next thing that offers it self to our consideration, as a duty laid
before us in this general rule, is this.

All our ways and works ought to be enterd into with prayer, when we
enterprise, and take in hand any business, either in speech or action, we
must call on God in the name of Christ, for a blessing upon it.

Look on the example of Abraham's servant, Genesis 24.12. All our ways and works
are to be taken in hand with prayer.
and have mercy on his master Abraham. And Ruth 2.4. Boaz prayed for his
reapers, for that salutation of his (the Lord be with you) was, no doubt, a
lifting up of his heart with his voice, that the Lord would strengthen and
bless their labors. And Act. 20.36. We find that Paul before he took
shipping, kneeled down and prayed. And by these examples and many more that
might be brought to this purpose, we are plainly taught.

That we are to take in hand the labors and works of our callings with
prayer, if opportunity serve not to make a set prayer at the beginning af every
work, yet at least, even in the work we are to lift up our hearts to the
Lord, when we are laboring and sweering, and in the midst of our greatest
imploiment.



Psalm. 127.1.2. Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that
build it, and it is in vain to rise early, and to lie down late, and to eat
the bread of sorrow.

Therefore we are to call upon God for a blessing upon them.



That which the Apostle says of the creatures, 1 Timothy 4.5. is also true of the
works of our lawful callings, they are sanctified by the word and prayer.

First, therefore, this serves to check and reprove such Reproof of such as
care not to sanctify their labors by prayer.
and are very sedulous and painful in their work, they toil, and moile but
they have no care to sanctify their labors, and to call on God for a blessing
upon them. Do not many of us rise early, and so soon as ever they are up,
they fall to their work, and continue at it till they are weary, and then lie
down, never calling on God before, nor giving thanks after? Is this a labor
in our callings pleasing to God? No, no, if thou so think thou art deceived,
thou must know that labor and toil, though it be in a lawful calling is not
simply good, and a thing wherein God is pleased (for wicked men may do it) but
labor sanctified is the labor that the Lord likes, and will bless; and
withal remember that thou laboring and working, and yet having no care to
call on God for a blessing on thy labors, thou labourest not in the name of
the Lord Jesus.

Thou will say, in whose name then?

Surely in thine own name, even in confidence of thine own strength, and thou
art one of those James speaks of chapter the 4.13. that say, to day we will
do such or such a thing, such a piece of business we will dispatch this day,
but never lift up their hearts to the Lord, desiring him to enable them to do
it, and so doing, it is a bold presumption in thee, and one time or other,
cannot escape the punishing hand of God, and therefore take heed of it, and
ever remember that thou must enter on thy labors with prayer, at least every
morning call thou to God for a blessing on all thy labors that day, and in the
heat of thy work, when thou art most earnest about it, still now and then lift
up thine heart in prayer.

Again, is it so, that when we take in hand the ordinary works of our
callings, we are to call upon God in If we may not enter on the works of
ordinary callings, without prayer in them, much less on the duties of Gods
worship.
as to hear the word, to receive the Sacraments, and the like: and herein
the most of us are much faulty and justly to be blamed, do not most men and
women, either come from their beds or from some ordinary business to the
Church, never caring to call upon God for a blessing on that holy business.

Well, let us know that so doing, though the works of hearing the word,
receiving the Sacraments, be holy in themselves, yet they are not sanctified
unto us, and howsoever we renounce the opinion of the Papists, touching opus
operatum, yet indeed we do as they do, we rest in the work done, yea, we
coming to the Church without calling upon God before we come, we come not in
the name of God, but in our own names, and can we then look for a blessing?
Surely no, but rather for a curse, and that our hearing of the word should
turn to our deeper condemnation, and therefore especially remember when thou
come to do the work of the Lord in his immediate worship and service, that
then thou call on God in the name of Christ for a blessing, that it above all
other things may be sanctified unto thee.

Now the Apostle says (whatsoever ye do) and then adds (in word or deed) it
is clear.

That even speech is sometimes a work, as the speech of the Magistrate, or of
the Minister.

And therefore no light matter as some esteem it, but upon that I will not
stand, neither will I enter to speak of the point of mediation in whose name
we are to pray till we come to the last words of this verse (by him) only one
thing we are to mark that the Apostle says not (by the name of Christ) though
by his name many great works may be done, but in the name of the Lord Jesus,
no doubt he thus spoke upon purpose to teach us thus much.

We must be able to do all our works in the name of Christ with comfort, and
so as they may be in his mediation accepted.
for indeed men may do great works by the name of Christ, and yet find no
comfort in the doing of them, they may by his name prophecy, and cast out
devils, and do many great works, Matthew. the seventh and twenty two, and yet
find no comfort, nay they may (notwithstanding these great works) go to hell.

Therefore if we would find comfort in our labors we must do them in the
mediation of Christ, and so as we are sure they are accepted in and through him.



of Christ, the best words we do or can do, We must labor to have part in
the merit of Christ, that our works may be accepted in and through him.
and never rest till by faith thou do apprehend his merit, and apply it to
thy self, and then thy works and good things thou do will be pleasing to
God, and in and through the mediation of Christ, thou shall find comfort in the
doing of them.

Come we to the second part of the Apostles exhortation here urged, namely
this, that whatsoever is done of us, either in word or deed, we give thanks
to God by Christ (giving thanks to God even the father by him) giving thanks
to God, that is, with joy and gladness of heart, magnifying and praising God,
with a true and serious acknowledgement of his goodness and mercy,
Interpretation.
opening your mouths to render thanks and praise to him (even the father) in
the original it is (and the father) the conjunction (and) does not here note
diversity of person, but is put to declare how God is to be conceived of us in
our giving thanks unto him, namely, as our father in Christ his son, in whom
he has loved us, and made us accepted in his sight, Ephesians. 1.6. and of his
fathers love toward us in him, has bestowed on us, that for which we give
thanks, and many other benefits (by him) that is by Christ, as your mediator
and in his name, Ephesians. 5.20. this then is the meaning of these words, as if
the Apostle had said more largely thus.

With joy and gladness of heart, and with a serious acknowledgement of the
goodness of God, The meaning of the text.
opening your mouths to magnify and to render thanks to him as to your good
and gracious Father in Christ, offering up your praise and thanksgiving by
Christ, as your Mediator even in his name, and through him alone. Now first
here we may plainly see this duty laid before us.

As we are to begin our works and businesses with prayer, so we must end
them with thanksgiving.
it is not enough for us to come to to God before our work, craving his
direction and blessing in and upon the same, but we must come to him after it
is ended with thanksgiving, having then our hearts enlarged, and our mouths
filled with praise and thanksgiving to him.

And for this also we have example in the Scripture, Genesis 24. Abraham's servant
not only prayed before his journey verse the twelfth, but verse the twenty
seven, he gave thanks to the Lord, for that he had given him good success
in his journey, and he said, blessed be the Lord God of my Master Abraham,
which has not withdrawn his mercy, and his truth from my master, 2. Chron.
20. we have a notable example to this purpose we there find that when a a
great army came against Iehoshaphat and his people, and they were to go out
and to meet them, and to fight against them, that good King and the people, not
only humbled themselves before they went out, and Iehoshaphat made an excellent
prayer, from verse the sixth, to the end of the twelfth, but also afterward
when the Lord had given them a marvelous victory over their enemies, then
they blessed the Lord, and gave thanks to him for the same, verse 26. they
assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the
Lord, says the text, and verse 28 they came again to Jerusalem with viols and
with harpes, and with trumpet even unto the house of the Lord; and to these
might be added other examples teaching us the same thing, that we are not
only to enter upon our works, and begin them with prayer, but that we must
also end them with thanksgiving to God, with cheerefulnes of heart, opening
our mouths to magnify the name of the Lord, for the same the reasons of this
duty are these.

First, because God is the principal agent in every

And again, because thanksgiving must ever reach as

Objection. Happily some may say,

I answer, we are even then to give thanks to the Lord, for howsoever the
success answer not our desire and expectation, and so in seeming, and in our
conceit is not good, yet if we be in Christ, certainly it is good, and for the
best to us: The Lord sees it would not be good for us to prosper in that
business, and he in his wise providence will so dispose it as it shall be to
our good according to that Romans 8.28. All things work together for the best
unto them that love God, even to them that are called of his purpose, and the
Lord does sometimes cross us in some good business and with prayer taken in
hand, to humble us for something wherein we have failed and not done as we
ought, as happily we have not prayed with feruency of spirit, as we ought,
but coldly or customarily, or the like, and therefore howsoever the success of
our labors taken in hand with prayer be not answerable to our desire and
expectation, yet notwithstanding that, we are to bless God for it, and still
it remains our duty, that what work or business soever we take in hand,
either in speech or action with prayer, we are likewise at the end of the
same, to open our mouths in praise and thanksgiving to God, we must not
only do all our works in the name of Christ, but we must do them also with
giving thanks to God in his name.

Now in this duty most of us are far short and much

Especially if the Lord cross us never so little in any business we take in
hand, Many fail in this duty especially if the Lord cross them but a little
in any business they take in hand.
if things we take in hand, succeed not according to our desire, what shall
we then hear from many of us, giving thanks to God? Nay rather, muttering
and murmuring, yea, sometimes cursing and banning, and wishing a plague or a
mischief to light on the thing or person by whose means we are crossed, this
is too common amongst us, now what is this but to be displeased with the
work of Gods providence, and indeed to mumure against God himself, thy duty
is to begin thy business with prayer, and howsoever it succeed, though
contrary to thy desire, yet to bless God, and with joy and gladness of heart
to give him thanks, and remember if thou belong to Christ, thou have reason so
to do, for then thou being crossed, the Lord sees it good, thou should be
so, and he will dispose it to thy good.

Oh but this is hard to flesh and blood?

It is true:

But thou have more in thee then flesh and blood, even the Spirit and grace,
else is that cross a curse unto thee; but to go on in the application of this
duty, if we duly examine our selves, and call our selves to a strict account, I
fear me, the most of us will be wanting in this duty of thankfulness, even
then when our labors succeed well, and we prosper in them according to our
desire, where is almost the man or the woman to be found that gives true
thanks to God for the same? Happily we do it for form or fashion in some
few words, as I praise God for my good success this day in my business, but
where is our thanksgiving to God with a serious meditation and due
acknowledgement of his goodness and mercy? where is that affection of David,
opening the mouth wide in magnifying the name of God, as David did, 1.
Chronicles the twenty nine? read the place from the first verse to the end of
the thirteenth, verse the eleventh he says, Thine oh Lord is greatness and
power, and glory. and victory, and praise, for all that is in the heaven, and
in the earth is thine, thine is the kingdom, Oh Lord, and thou excellest as
head over all, etc. See, he could not find words sufficient to set out the
affection of his heart, where is this manner of thanksgiving to be found?

Surely it is rare and hard, to be found amongst men in these days; well, to
stir us up to help forward in this duty, I might urge the excellency of it,
being a peculiar exercise of the Angels in heaven.

But consider we only these two things.

We are to practice the duty of thanksgiving to God, after our labors and
works. Motives to stir us up unto it.


Surely, it argues our hearts are not sound within us, for an hypocrite may
desire and pray for a good thing, and pray for it from the bottom of his
heart, and yet have no good and godly desire, but a desire of self-love, but
he can never give true and hearty thanks to God for any blessing received,
Note.
he may fumble out out some words of thanksgiving, but he can never truly
and heartily praise God.

And if we then have not our mouths filled with hearty thanksgiving unto
God, after that our labors are ended, it is an evident argument our hearts are
but hollow, and there is no soundness of grace in them.

And again:

Consider that thanks and praise is never truly given to God for any mercy or
blessing, but through Gods mercy it brings down another mercy, and a further
blessing.

Look on the example of the leper, Luke the seventeenth, he returning and
giving thanks to Christ for his clensing, had also his sins forgiven, as we
may gather by those words verse 19. Go thy way, thy faith has made the whole.

If then we would make it clear, to the comfort of our own hearts, that our
hearts are not hollow, but that there is soundness of grace in them, and if
we would have mercy after mercy, and one blessing after another, through Gods
mercy descending down upon us; let us then be stirred up, not only to come
to God in prayer, when we take in hand our works and businesses, but also to
come to him after with our hearts enlarged, and our mouths opened, and full of
true praise and thanksgiving to God.

The next thing that offers it self to our consideration, is from these words
(even the Father.) Whence we are taught thus much.

That our giving thanks to God must be to him, as to Our thanksgiving to God
must be to him, as to our gracious father in Christ.
when the Lord has vouchsafed to us any good thing, or blessing, we must be
able to give him thanks for it, as for a blessing, coming to us from his
fatherly love in Christ, as a blessing coming to us in, and through his Son
Christ Jesus, we must be able to use the Apostles form of praise and
thanksgiving, Esphesians 1.3. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, which has blessed us with all spiritual blessing: in heavenly
things in Christ with Spiritual, yea with this or that temporal blessiing in
Christ Jesus.

Men commonly think it enough, if they can say, I thank the Lord, he has
given me such and such a good thing, though they be not able to say, such and
such good things in Christ.

Now there is no comfort in such thanksgiving, the very heathen might go so
far.

We must be able to give thanks to God for blessings vouchsafed to us, We
must labor to know and be assured that God is our father in Christ, that we
so give him thanks for good things vouchsafed unto us. A motive thereunto.
as tokens and pledges of his love, in the Son of his love Christ JESUS; and
this we shall never do, till we know that God is our Father in Christ, and
we have his Spirit bearing witness with our Spirits, that we are his
children; and therefore we are never to rest till we come to that knowledge,
and that assurance; to give thanks to GOD the Father of our Lord JESUS Christ,
for any blessing, or good thing vouchsafed to us only as a blessing and good
thing in it self, and not to us in Christ, is so far from being comfortable,
as indeed, it does rather bring in discomfort; it gives thee to understand
that, that good thing is given, to leave thee without excuse, and for further
increase of thy condemnation, and therefore never rest till thou be able to
bless God, and to give him thanks for good things vouchsafed to thee from his
good and gracious hand, in, and through Christ.

We are to come to God in prayer and thanksgiving only in the name and
mediation of Christ.
and that is clear by this text, that in Christ his Son alone we are to
pray and give thanks unto God, we must do all things in the name of Christ,
and give thanks to God by him, I will further prove this by some reasons.

Heb. 7.25. He is able perfectly to save them that come unto God by him,
seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them; and hence it is that
redemption and mediation are joined together, 1 Timothy 2.5.6. Therefore Christ
only is our Mediator, and in his name alone must we pray, and give thanks to
God.

Gal. 4.5. therefore he alone must be our Mediator.

John 16.24 and no where in the name of any other. Therefore in his name alone
must we pray, and give thanks to God.

Fourthly, he must be our Mediator in whose name John 14.13.14. If ye shall
ask any thing in my name, I will do it. 2 Cor. 1.20. In him all the promises
of God are yea, and Amen, (that is) are confirmed, and fulfilled; therefore in
his name alone must we come to God in prayer and thanksgiving.

Happily some will object, that which we find, Romans 8.26. The Spirit it self
helps our infirmities, for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the
spirit it self makes request for us with sighs which cannot be expressed.

I have heretofore answered this (but in a word to remember it) the Apostles
meaning is,

And this we are to hold against our adversaries, Confutation of the mediation
of Angels, and Saints held by the Papists.
yea, they have found out a new distinction for this point, that forsooth,
Christ is the Mediator of redemption, but the Saints of Intercession; wherein
they rob Christ of a great part of his honor belonging to his Priesthood;
for Christ has not only by his one sufficient sacrifice, of himself
consecrated them that are sanctified, Heb. 10.14. but also sits at the right
hand of his Father, to make request for them. Romans 8.34. Christ his Priesthood
is everlasting. Heb. 7.24. Therefore his intercession is perpetual.

The Papists allege some places of Scripture to prove their mediation of
Angels and Saints, Ier. 15.1. Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet mine
affection could not be toward this people (that is) if Moses, Samuel, and the
like, I will not stand to remember them, only that which they bring to prove
that we may plead our own worthynesse in prayer, and desire to be heard for
our own good works I will briefly answer, to this purpose they allege the
example of David, Psalm. 86.2. Preserve thou my soul for I am merciful: Oh
God, save thy servant that trusts in thee. And of Hezekiah 2. King. 20.3. I
beseech thee O Lord, remember now, how I have walked before thee in truth, and
with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. Hereupon
they conclude that we may pray to God in consideration of our own good works.

I answer them, David and Hezekiah in the places cited, did not plead the
merit of their righteousness, Psalm. 34.15. And thus far we may use the
benefit of good conscience, and our own integrity (namely) to confirm us in
the promises of God made to his children, but we must ever remember to come to
God in prayer, Note.
and thanksgiving, in the name and merit of Christ alone.

Now to the 18. Verse.

VER. 17. Wives submit yourselues unto your husbands, as it is comely in the
Lord.
The Apostle having absolved the first part of this Chapter containing an
exhortation to all Christians, generally as they are Christians and professors
of the Gospel, from the first verse hitherto in this 18. verse.

He enters on the second part of it, and he continues that to the 2. verse of
the 4. Chapter, The second part of this Chapter.
and this part is a comprehension of certain special duties of Christians
they stand in relation one to another in some particular state, or condition of
life; it contains special exhortations addressed to certain sorts of
persons, The Apostles order in this part of the Chapter.
and particularly, and (namely) to all the ordinary parts of a family, both
inferiors, and superiors.

And therein the Apostle holds this order.

First, he exhorts to the duties of those that are more

And then to the duties of those who are less straightly tied

Here therefore, first the Apostle begins with the duty of wives, and says,
Wives submit your selves unto your husbands as it is comely in the Lord.

And in this verse we have these things in general laid before us.

First, an exhortation to wives, to submit themselus to their husbands and that
generally, or indefinitely propounded.

Secondly, an argument to back and strengthen that

in the Lord.

(Submit your selves) The word properly signifies, be ordered, Interpretation.
or placed in order under another, the meaning is according to your inferior
order and place, subject your selves, it is the same word with that, Romans 13.1.
(To your husbands) the words are to your own husbands, as it is comely, or as
it is meet, and as it beseemes you (in the Lord) the meaning of that form of
speech, is thus much, so far forth as it may stand with the true fear of
God, and with your obedience to his will, so as you may still hold piety, and
good conscience toward God, as we may gather by the same phrase, 1 Cor. 7.39.
Or thus, in things lawful, and agreeable to the will of the Lord.

Thus then, conceive we the exhortation of the Apostle, as if he had said,
Wives according to your inferior order and place, The meaning of the text.
subject your selves to your own Husbands suffer your selves to be ordered by
them, as it is meet, and beseemes you, so far forth as may stand with the
true fear of God, and obedience to his will in things lawful, and agreeable
to the will of God.

Come we now to the matter of the doctrine; and first observe we, Obseru.
that the Apostle having exhorted to general duties that concern all
Christians, as they are Christians; he there stays not, but comes now to
exhort to special duties, that concern certain sorts of persons
particularly; he comes to exhort to the duties that concern Christians in
their personal estates, and conditions of life.

Hence we are taught thus much.

That it is not enough for a Christian to carry himself well, and as a
Christian in the general duties of a Christian, but he must also behave
himself Christianly in the special duties of his special calling. A
Christian must not only carry himself well in the general duties of
Christianity, but also in the special duties of his special calling.
Its not sufficient for a Christian to be of good conversation abroad, but his
behavior must be also good and such as it ought to be at home.

And hence it is that the holy Ghost directs his exhortation to several sorts
of persons (especially in the family) to carry themselves holily and justly,
not only here, but in other places of Scripture, as Ephesians. 5. and 6. 1 Pet.
2. and 3. Tit. 2.

And the reasons of this are manifest,

First, every Christian having two callings: one general

And again, every Christian besides his general

They therefore are justly to be blamed and reproved Reproof of those who
carry themselves well in show in their general calling, and yet fail in the
duties of their special calling.
and yet carry themselves badly in their special, they who would feign seem
to be good Christians abroad, and yet behave themselves wretchedlie at home,
too many such there be in the world. For example, look upon a people assembled
to hear the word of God, and you shall see, there is almost no man or woman
amongst them but they carry themselves reverently, all, and every one almost
is a like reverent and attentive in hearing the word, and every one almost,
seems to make conscience of that general duty in the Church, but go home
with many of them to their houses, and look into their conversation at home,
and there you shall easily see they make no conscience of their special
duties, of duties that concern them in their particular state and condition of
life, there you shall see either the wife refusing to subject her self to her
husband, or the husband bitter to his wife, the children stubborn and
disobedient to their parents, or the parents too indulgent, or too rigorous
toward their children; servants refractarie and careless in their duties, or
masters unjust and unequal in their dealings toward their servants; yea, in
some houses you shall see all parts out of order, both husband, wife, and all
the rest, neglecting the duties of their particular place and standing.

And again, are there not some who carry themselves in Christian duties, which
they owe to men; well, and without exception toward most men abroad in
public, but toward them, to whom they stand in some special relation,
wretchedly, and wickedly? As the wife carries her self well, and in some
tolerable sort toward all, save to her husband, and the husband demeanes
himself well, and gives some content to all save his wife, and so in other
relations.

Now consider we this, is this to carry our selves as Christians ought to do?
No, no, this is but the form of godliness without the power of it, as the
apostle calls it, 2 Timothy 3.5. this is but mere hypocrisy; is it like thou
behauest thy self well (for conscience sake) toward them to whom thou owe
but a general duty, and not to those to those to whom besides the general
thou art tied with a special bond? no, no, it is but for thy credit, or thy
profit, thou disguisest thy self abroad; for such a one thou art indeed, as
thou art at home, there is the principal proof and trial of thee what thou
art, and ever remember this; it is not enough for a Christian to carry himself
in general duties as a Christian, but he must also carry himself well in
the special duties of his particular place and calling, and the practice of
the one without the other is but hypocrisy, and it is worth our marking, that
the holy Ghost does here single out the duties and conditions of men and
women severally, and he speaks to wives apart, and to husbands apart etc.
thereby to leave us without all excuse: if we be not conformable even in our
particular duties in this or that state or condition of life, for that which
is spoken to al (such is our corruption) we commonly put it off, as if it were
spoken to none, but this we cannot so pass over; no, no, not so much as with
any colorable excuse, that may satisfy our own sinful corruption and ill
judging conscience.

Observe further that the Apostle in setting down the special duties of
several sorts of persons, he begins first with the inferiors, as first he
teaches the duty of wives and then of Husbands etc. and this order he
observes in other places, hereby teaching us.

That when we are to deal with persons of several When we are to inform
persons of several conditions in their duties we are rather to begin with the
inferiors then the supeperiours.
as when we are to make peace between the inferior and superior, as
servants and Masters: we are first to begin with the inferior, the servant
showing him his fault, and letting him see his duty, and then in the second
place with the superior for so much the fifth commandment teaches us.

The Lord does there directly teach the inferior his duty, and the superior
by implication, but on that I will not further stand.

Come we to the special duty here urged, namely, the duty of wives, that
they be subject to their husbands, in handling this duty, I will observe this
order keeping as near as can be, The order observed in handling the duty of
wives which is the third doctrine.
within compass of the Apostles words.

First, I will show what this subjection is.

Secondly, wherein it does consist.

Thirdly, the generality of it, touching the persons whom it concerns.

Fourthly, how far forth it is to be yielded, and then after some
particular examination touching the practice of this duty, I will use some
motives to stir up them whom it concerns to the perfourmance of it.

What the wives subjection is.
First therefore know we, that this subjection is an humble, a ready and willing
mind in the wife, yielding to the government of her husband, as to the
ordinance of God; for indeed so has the Lord ordained, that the wife should
be subject to her husband, Genesis 3.16. thy desire shall be to thine husband,
and this subjection must be of an humble and ready mind, our present text
makes it clear, in that the Apostle says, wives submit your selves which is
as much as if he had said, be not constrained, to it, but of a ready mind,
of your own accord, even willingly subject your selves to the government of
your husbands, acknowledging the ordinance of God, and resting in it, and this
also is taught, Ephesians. 5.22. where the Apostle says, wives submit your selves
unto your husbands, as unto the Lord, that is, not as to man, and to the eye
outward, or by constraint, but sincerely, and from your hearts as to the Lord
himself, the husband being in Gods stead, and verse 24. in that he says,
wives are to be in subjection to their husbands as the Church is to Christ, he
plainly teaches that their subjection must be of a ready and willing mind
for the Church, the true spouse of Christ is subject to Christ willingly,
sincerely, and from the heart. Now this humble, ready, and willing subjection
of the wife to her husband, does consist in two things, namely, in reverence,
and in obedience, The subjection of the wife to her husband is in two things,
in reverence and obedience.
the wives subjection to her husband, must be in a reverent awe of her
husband, and in obedience to him, we find it so branched out in the word of
God, Ephesians. 5.33. says the Apostle, let the wife see that she fear her husband
(that is) she must carry in her mind a reverent opinion of her husband, and in
her heart a reverent awe and fear to offend him, acknowledge him as her head,
and so her fear toward her husband must not be a slavish fear but a fear of
love such as is from the body to the head, and from the Church to Christ, even
of a loving affection fearing to offend her husband in any thing, and showing
forth that, her inward loving fear, by outward meekness and lowliness in
her speech, countenance, and all her behavior toward him.

And again, her subjection to her husband must be in obedience to him, doing
what he gives in charge to be done, and forbearing to do that he forbiddes,
we find that both these were in Sara toward Abraham, her husband, 1. Pet.
3.6. Sara obeyed Abraham, and called him Sir, the Apostle propounds her example
to be followed of all Christian wives, they are to carry in their hearts a
reverent aw of their husbands, showing it forth in all meekness of speech and
gesture, and they are to yield obedience to them in word and deed.

Now the extent of the wives subjection, The duty of subjection in the wife to
her husband reaches to all wives whatsoever they be.
the third thing that I propounded to speak of, is implied in the first words
of this verse (Wives) in that the Apostle speaks generally and indefinitely,
and says, wives subject your selves to your husbands, he gives us to
understand.

That this duty of subjection is general and common, and reaches to all
wives, high or low, rich or poor, noble or base, and there is no exemption of
any wife whatsoever she be, from this duty of subjection to her husband, though
the wife be very wise, and more fit to govern, and the husband of meaner
parts and weaker judgment, if he have any use of reason at all, if he be
not a man frantic or mad, one altogether bereft of the use of reason; if
he be so, then doubtless the wife is not bound to subject her self to his
government, but rather to take on her to be his guide and his governor, for
the power of government being taken away, subjection depending on it, cease;
but if he have the use of reason, be it but in a small measure, she is not
exempt from subjection, though she be never so wise, if she be a wife, she
must be subject, she must yield reverence and obedience to her husband,
unless she will shake off the yoke the Lord has laid on her neck, and
break in sunder the cords of Gods holy ordinance.

Concerning the fourth thing, namely, how far forth subjection is to be
yielded by the wife to her husband, How far forth subjection is to be
yielded by the wife to her husband.
especially in that branch of it namely, obedience, it is laid before us in the
last words of this ver. (in the Lord) co^sidred together with the last words of
Ephesians. 5.24. so let wives be to their husbands in every thing that general is
here limited, and we are to understand that these words put toge-thus, that
the wife is to be subject and obedient to her husband in every thing in the
Lord (that is) in every thing honest and lawful, in every thing commanded by
the husband, not contrary or different from the word of God, the wife is to
yield obedience, but if husbands command their wives unlawful things, therein
they are not to be subject nor obedient to them; Luke the fourteenth and
twenty six, he that loves father or mother, or wife, or children; and so of
the husband, she that loves her husband more then Christ, and in obeying her
husband disobeyes Christ, is not his disciple, but if the husband command his
Wife any indifferent or lawful thing she is to yield obedience without
gainesaying, though it be never so cross and contrary to her own mind; as
if her husband say to her, I will not have thee thus or thus attired, but thus
or thus (not commanding any new fangled or whorish attire, but such as is
comely) she is to conform her self to his mind, and if he bid further, go
to such a place, whether she may lawfully go, (being not to a playhouse or the
like) though she have no mind to go, or if he bid her tarry at home when she
has a mind to be abroad, if she cannot persuade him to the contrary: in
these things she is to obey him, for indeed in these things the commandments
of the husband has Gods stamp set on them, and if in these things and such
like things the wife disobey, she rebels against God himself.

Now if wives do examine themselves by this that has been said, Particular
examination of wives touching their duty toward their husbands, and their
failings therein discovered.
Do thou carry in thine heart a loving awe and fear toward him as to thy
head and governor, set over thee by the Lord, fearing to offend him in any
thing either by speech or gesture? I fear me if most wives answer these
questions truly, their answer must be negative, and they must needs confess
they do not. The vnreuerent behavior of many wives toward their husbands is
too palpable, are there not some who care not to show themselves in the sight
of all that look on them so far from yielding reverence to their husbands,
as they stick not to scoff and scorn them, to tush and puff at them, and to
cut them up short in words? yea some there be who care not to break out into
gross terms and bitter words against their husbands, yea, which is most
fearful sometimes to curse their husbands, whom they should reverence and
fear.





Now for the second branch of subjection (obedience) are there not many wives
as much wanting in that as in the former? surely yes, it is too evident. Some
there be, who stick not to utter it, that they will do this or that, yea
sometimes they bind it with an oath, they will do it, let their husbands say
what they can to the contrary, or they will not do that he would have them
(being a thing lawful) though he would never so feign; to insist in one
particular, are there not some wives, who if their husbands bid them leave of
this or that apparel, as too fine or costly in the matter, or too garish in
the manner, will presently answer him they will not? yea, some are so
shameless, as to answer in this manner, let him say or do what he can, I
will have it so, thus, and many ways besides, wives discover the rebellion of
their hearts, in vnreuerent and undutiful behavior toward their husbands,
yea, they are hardly drawn to this duty of subjection, it is an hard matter
to persuade them to it, because the wife is yoke fellow with her husband, and
nearly knit to him, even one flesh with him, and therefore many wives think
it unreasonable, and too much laid on them, in that they are inioined to be
subject to their husbands. Four motives to persuade wives to perform their
duty to their husbands.


Now then to persuade with them to yield to this duty, let them consider only
these things.

First, such wives as refuse to subject themselves to their husbands, inuert
the order of nature, it is as if the body should refuse to be guided by the
head.

Secondly, they break the ordinance of God, yea, a most ancient ordinance of
God, for even in man's innocence, before the fall was, woman by Gods ordinance
subject to her husband with pleasure, and if thou be not now subject to thine
husband, thou breakest the cords of Gods ordinance, and pretend what thou will,
that thou art subject to other superiors and governors, indeed and truth
there is no such thing in thee, but an intolerable pride, swelling against all
superiority as occasion serves, for how can thou stoop under other yokes, and
yet wilt not bow down thy neck to this, of all other the most ancient and the
most easy.

Thirdly, consider the Apostles words in this place, that it is a comely thing
for the wife to be subject to her husband, and the want of this or the
contrary to it, is an uncomely and unseemly thing, see thou a woman not
subject to her husband? she is an uncomely and loathsome creature in the sight
of God, though her face be never so fair, her beauty is but as a ring of gold
in a swines snout, Prou. 11.22.

Last of all, the want of subjection in the wife to her husband, is as the want
of teaching in a Minister, and the want of justice in a Magistrate, it is a
blot and blemish to all her other good qualities and virtues be they never so
excellent, admit she be descreete, chaste, sober, etc. yet if she be not
subject to her husband, she causes the word of God to be ill spoken of,
Tit. 2.5. and that makes all her other good qualities nothing worth, it brings
a blot on them all, seem she never so religious, if she be not subject to
her husband, she has but a show of religion without the power of it.

Let all Christian wives think on these things, it is not so light a matter as
many women think, to be vnreuerent and undutiful toward their husbands,
thereby they preuert the order of nature, they vioiate the ordinance of God,
they make themselves odious in the sight of God, they blemish all the good
things that are in them, yea, thereby they make it plain, that their religion
is but a show without substance, it will never yield them sound comfort, be
thou therefore thou wife (whosoever thou art) stirred up in the fear of God,
to yield subjection to thy husband, lay aside all reasonings of the flesh to
the contrary, labor thou to subdue al thy rebellious thoughts, and never rest
till thou be able with a willing mind, to show thy self reverent toward
thine husband, and obedient to him in all lawful things, and remember who it
is that requires this duty, at thine hands, even the Lord, who has made thee
of nothing, redeemed thee (if thou belong to him) with the blood of his own
dear Son, and preserved thee from thy birth, giving thee food, raiment, and
all good things, and let these move thee to become obedient to his voice, and
he saying to thee, wife submit thy self to thine husband, let thine heart
answer him, I am content to do thy will O Lord, yea, thy Law is within mine
heart to do it, and then doubtless thou shall he a woman much set by before
God, 1. Pet. 3.4. and many blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee.

VER. 19. Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter unto them.
In this verse the Apostle sets before us the duty of husbands toward their
wives, namely this, that husbands ought to love their wives, which is set down
by way of exhortation, and that indefinitely, husbands whatsoever ye be, love
your wives, and this exhortation is further amplified by a disswasion from the
contrary, that husbands should not be unloving or unkind to their wives,
which is expressed under a comparison, the Apostle comparing the unkindness of
the husband toward his wife, to bitter things, he says, be not bitter unto
them (Husbands love your wives) that is, carry in your hearts a kind and loving
affection toward them, and show it forth both in word and deed,
Interpretation.
(and be not bitter unto them) that is, be not to your wives as bitter things
are to the taste, be not unpleasant and harsh in your behavior toward them,
use no hard and rigorous dealing to your wives, either in word or deed, take
heed your love turn not into gall and bitterness toward them.

Now first, let it be here observed of us that our Apostle having taught wives
in the former verse, to submit themselves to their husbands, and now coming in
this verse to speak to husbands, he speaks not to them as it may seem, he
ought to have spoken; for having said, Wives submit your selves to your
husbands, it may seem he should here have said, as most answerable and
correspondent to his former speech, Husbands rule over your wives, and exercise
your authority over them; for rule and subjection are correlatiues and
correspondent one to another, not subjection and love; yet the Apostle thus
speaks not, but he being guided by the Spirit of God speaks thus; Husbands
love your wives, and be not bitter unto them. He thought it more fit to
teach husbands their duty, then to put them in mind of their power, and to let
them understand how to use their power over their wives well, and as they
ought, then to stir them up to the exercise of it, he knowing husbands ready
enough to use their power and authority over their wives, thought it more meet
to inform them how to use it aright, and in holy manner, then to stir them
up

Hereby plainly teaching us thus much.

That husbands are especially to look that they use their power and authority
over their wives well, and in a right manner, Husbands are especially to be
careful to use their power and authority over t^eir wives well and in a right
manner.
they are to be most careful for this, that the rule and government of their
wives put into their hands, be used as it ought to be; its lawful indeed,
for husbands to rule and govern their wives put in subjection unto them, but
the practice of that rule and government must be seasoned with love and
sweetness.

And hence it is that howsoever by implication, its clear from many places of
Scripture, that the husband has power and authority given him over his wife,
and he may use it; yet, we never find it directly said, husbands rule over
your wives, or husbands exercise authority over your wives, but we find it
often said, husbands love your wives, and give honor to them as to the weaker
vessels; thereby teaching, and urging the manner of husbands rule and
government, and therefore husbands are especially to look to that, and the
reason of it is manifest, (namely) this.



and tyranny in the rule and government of their wives; Reprofe of such
husbands as use rigor and tyranny in the government of their wives.
happily some may take occasion through their own corruption, upon that
doctrine, touching the subjection of wives, to play the tyrants over their
wives, and because wives are to subject themselves to their husbands, and are
to yield them reverence and obedience; hereupon they may happily think, that
they may tyrannize over their wives, and carry themselves as Lions in their
own houses: but let them know, whosoever they be, that think they may so
do, they discover their own weakness, and their want of right understanding
and judgment, and they savor the doctrine of the Apostle to death, and not to
life. And now learn, whosoever thou art, that howsoever thy wife is to subject
her self to thy rule and government, yet thou may not thereupon take
occasion to domineere and tyrannize over her; no, no, thou must especially
look to this, that thy superiority and dominion over thy wife be rightly used,
laborur thou to have thine heart sanctified in thy preferrement above thy wife,
that it may be used in holy manner, even in love, and that it may be void of
all rigor and bitterness, and if it be not so used, assuredly, without
repentance, that preferrement of thine shall one day stand in judgment against
thee, and shall arggauate and increase thy condemnation.

I come to the duty it self here urged by the Apostle, The order observed in
handling the duty of husbands, which is the second doct.
(namely) this, that husbands are to love their wives.

Touching this duty, I will show.

1 First, what this love that ought to be in the husband is. 2 Secondly,
wherein it consists. 3 Thirdly, the extent of it touching the persons. 4 And
fourthly, the measure and condition of it.
And then after these things laid a little nearer to our selves, I will use
some motives to stir up to the practice of this duty.

First, therefore know we, that this love is, a chaste affection in the heart
of the husband, What the love of the husband to his wife is.
whereby he is so united and knit to his wife, as he does rest contented with
her, and speaks her good by all good means, without subjection, in, and for
the Lord; I say, a chaste affection; to distinguish it from unchaste love, and
wanton lust; for the love of the husband to his wife must be, as the love of
Christ to his Church, Ephesians. 5 25. And Christ his love to his Church is most
chaste; that which is added, that this love does so unite the husband to his
wife, as he does rest contented with her, and seeks her good by all good
means; we shall show that, in expressing wherein it consists, but that this
must be without subjection its clear, in that the husband is the wives head,
Ephesians. 5.23. and that it must be in the Lord, and for the Lord, (that is) so
as may stand with the fear of God in obedience to his particular Commandment,
binding every man to love his wife in special manner, we cannot doubt of
that.

The love of the husband to his wife stands in love to her body and love to her
soul.
I come therefore to the second thing, (namely) to show wherein this love
consists: and forth at there be two essential parts of the wife, her body,
and her soul, the husbands love consists in them both, and for the husbands
love to the body of his wife, that consists in two things, in contentation and
preservation.

The husband must content himself with the love of his own wife only: we
find that particularly commanded, Prou. 5.18.19. Let thy fountain be blessed,
and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Verse 19. Let her be as the loving
Hind, and pleasant Roe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and
delight in her love continually.

And secondly, the husband must prefer the body of his wife, by cheerishing,
governing, and defending of her, and these three are so conioined, and linked
one within another, as they are not to be sundered; for to cheerish and not to
govern, is foolish cockering; to govern, and not to cheerish, is austerity;
to cheerish, and govern, and not to defend, is to make the wife no better then
a slave, nay, worse then a bruit beast, for men will cheerish, order, and they
will also defend, and shelter their sheep, and oxen, from injury of weather,
and shall then any of these things be denied to the wife? No, no, men are to
nourish and cherish their wives, as their own flesh, Ephesians. 5.29. They must
(as they are able) provide meat, drink, apparel, and all things needful for
them, and provision being made, they must so order and dispose all things, as
there be no excess in any thing, and they must also shield them, as much as
they can, from all injury and wrong, both at home, and abroad.

Now, for the husbands love to the soul of his wife that stands especially in
two things.

The first is, that which we are taught, 1 Pet. 3.7. That he dwell with his
wife as a man of knowledge: the husband being the wives head ought to be more
eminent, and to appear above her in wisdom, judgment, and discretion, and
the fear of God, and according to his height and measure in those good things,
to bend down, and to apply himself, either to implant the same, or to
increase them, being already implanted in his wife. Husbands sometimes
complain that their wives are unruly, and carry not themselves as they ought
toward them, when indeed, the fault is from themselves, because they should
dwell with them, as men of wisdom, and knowledge, and do not; its as if the
head which has the guiding of the body, should lead it through briers, and
thorns, and cause it to be scratched, and then complain that the arms, or
legs, did ache, or smart; for the husband is the wives head, and should wisely
lead her, and go in and out before her.

The second thing wherein stands the husbands love to the soul of his wife is
comprised under a general duty, Philip. 2.2. the husband is to carry an
equal mind toward his wife, and that is, especially in bearing with her
frailties and infirmities, as with her hastiness, or slownesse, her
importunity, and such like; The Apostle Peter in the place before cited, says,
Let the husband give honor unto the woman as unto the weaker vessel; let him
entreat her with mildness, and gentleness, bearing with her natural
weakness and infimities, and if she fall by occasion into any fault (except
Adultery, which is the bane of wedlock) let him labor by all kind and
gentle means, to reclaim her, considering himself, as the Apostle says,
Gal. 6.1. that he also may be tempted, and fall into the like sin.

The duty of love in the husband to the wife reaches to all husbands.
For the third thing, the extent of this duty touching the persons whom it
concerns, that is implied in the first words of this verse (Husbands.) In that
the Apostle says indefinitely, Husbands love your wives, not bounding the duty
on husbands of this or that order, or condition; he would have us understand
that this duty is also general, and reaches to all husbands, hie and low,
rich and poor, none excepted, though the husband be a King, or the greatest
man in the earth, if he be an husband he must carry in his heart a chaste
affection toward his wife, he must love both her body and soul, content
himself with her love only, cheerish, govern, and defend her, dwell with her
as a man of knowledge, and bear with her natural frailties, and infirmities.

The husband must love his wife as much as himself, and with as hearty and
true love as he loves himself.
Now for the measure of the husbands love, the fourth thing I propounded to
speak of, that is taught by the Apostle, Ephesians. 5.33. Let every one love his
wife, even as himself: the husband must love his wife as much as himself, and
with as hearty and true love, as he does himself, he need not seek far
for a pattern of the love he is to bear to his wife, or a fit example for his
imitation; let him but look into his own heart, and there he shall find love
to himself drawn out in lively red letters, even in his own blood, and that
is the pattern accor-to which he must proportion his love to his wife; the
husband must consider what good, he in his heart wishes to his own body and
soul, and what harm he labors to avoid, and the same good must he
heartily wish to the soul and body of his wife, and the same harm must he
labor to keep from her; as it is abominable to have two measures in one shop,
one to buie, with a greater, and another, to sell withal, and that a less,
Prou. 20.10. So is it for a man to have two measures of love in his breast, one
a greater, by which he loves himself, and another a less, by which he loves
his wife, there must be the same true measure and condition of love, in the
heart of the husband, both toward himself, and toward his wife.

Now to lay these things a little nearer to our selves, Particular examination
of husbands touching their duty to their wives, and their failings in that
respect discovered.
No doubt, even they that make conscience of their duty, and endeavor most of
all to perform it, must needs confess, that in some thing or other they have
failed, but not to speak of them that fail of infirmity, and against their
purpose; are there not some who have, and daily do fail grossly, and please
themselves in their sinful failing and declining from their duty toward
their wives? The number of such is too great in the world. Are there not some
who carry in their hearts not only a wanton and brutish lust toward their
wives, which continues but for a time, and afterward turns as Ammons love
did, 2. Sam. 13.15. into extreme hatred. Are not some, who content not
themselves with the love of their own wives, but follow after strange flesh,
and delight to embrace the bosom of a stranger? Is it not too manifest that
there be some husbands so far from cheerishing their wives, and providing
things needful for them, as whatsoever they get, they spend in vain, and
unthrifty company, in the Alehouse, or the like place, and let wife and
children starve at home. And alas, how many husbands be there, that dwell not
with their wives as men of knowledge, are not able to govern their wives with
any good discretion, but are foolish heads, and cannot go wisely in and out
before them? How many, again, be there, that cannot bear with the frailties
of their wives, but if the wife be hasty, the husband is as hot; if she be
rash, he is as heady, and intemperate? And many other ways do husbands fail
in their duties toward their wives. Well, husbands must be humled for their
failings past, and learn now to make conscience of their duty; carry in thine
heart a chaste affection toward thy wife, content thy self with her love,
cheerish, govern, and defend her, as much as thou art able, 3. Motives to
persuade husbands to perform their duty to their wives.
dwell with her as a man of knowledge, bear with her natural fraileties, and
infirmities, and let thy love be as much, and as hearty toward thy wife, as
toward thy self.

And to help thee forward in this duty, consider,

Mat. 19.5. and in loving her, thou love thy self, Ephesians. 2.25.





If then thou bear any love to thy self, if thou would not (as much as in
thee is) deny that Christ loves his Church, and so show that Christ his love
has not yet warmed thine heart, and if thou would not be found unfaithful
to the Lord, who has committed thy wife to thee for her good, and is able and
will (without repentance) punish thy breach of trust in hell fire, then be thou
stirred up in the fear of God to love thy wife as thy self, look what good
thou do wish in thine heart to thy self, wish the same to thy wife, dwell
with her as a man of knowledge; frame thy self to bear with her natural
infirmities, and know withal thus much, that love in the husband and fear in
the wife, are the sinews of a well ordered house, and they make a sweet
hamonie, if love and fear harbor under one roof and lodge in one bed, they
make a blessed consent, and good agreement, and if love be wanting in the
husband, bitterness is the wives portion, as the Apostle here says, and if
fear be wanting in the wife, it were better for the husband to dwell in a
corner of the house top, then with such a woman in a wide house, Prou. 21.19.
therefore let both husband and wife make conscience of their duties one to
another.

There is one thing further to be observed in this verse.

We may observe, that the Apostle makes love in the husband to his wife, and
unkind, hard, and rigorous dealing with her, opposite and contrary one to
another, yea, as Unkind and hard dealing with the wife, either in word or
deed, cannot stand with that love that ought to be in the husband to his wife.
and be not bitter unto them.

Whence it is clear, that unkind and hard dealing with the wife, either in
word or deed, cannot stand with that love the Holy Ghost here requires of
husbands, bitterness and sweetness can never meet together in one and the
same subject, no more can hard dealing and love be found in one and the same
husband, if the husband be rigorus and bitter to his wife, he is void of that
love and sweetness that ought to be in him, and therefore it cannot be,
Reproof of such husbands as are violent in their dealing with their wives, and
do beat and bunch them.
and with extreme violence mis-vse her, that manner of dealing cannot stand
with love to the wife, the husband that so deals with his wife is a monster
amongst men, and fitter to live in Bedlem then in a civil society: for indeed
it is the part of a mad man to strike his own flesh, as he does who strikes
his own wife.



I answer

Have thou used all other good means, serving to that purpose? have thou
admonished her, sharply reproved her, as Job did his wife, Job 2 10. yet so
as thy admonition and reprofe has been without bitterness and passion, and with
a merciful heart toward her, and so as she might perceive thou soughtest her
good, and not to ease thy self on her? have thou so done? commonly this
objection comes from men that never use any other good means, but only in
their violent passion of anger (which is a madness for the time) or in their
drunken fit strike their wives upon the least occasion, yea, sometimes without
any occsion at all, but be it so, thou have used all other means, yet thou
may justly doubt, whether striking of thy wife, be a lawful and good means
or no, thou find no express warrant for it in the book of God, as thou
do for smiting thy child with the rod, Proverbs 23.14. and in many other
places, and for buffetting of thy servant, 1. Peter 2.20. but for striking of
thy wife No warrant in Scripture for striking of the wife.
thou have no such express warrant in the word of God, but grant this, that a
man may strike his wife, as he may cut and lance his own flesh in the time
of some great extremity, when no other means will serve, he has a sore on
his arm or leg, that of necessity must be cut and launced, and a man in
this case may cut or lance his own flesh, yet be thou as hardly drawn to
strike thy wife, as a man in that ease would be to cut or lance his own
flesh, even in the greatest extremity will a man hardly be drawn to cut or
lance his own flesh, not one amongst ten thousand can find in his heart to
do it himself, and with his own hand, he will hardly suffer another to do
it, it will grind and grieve him to suffer it to be done by another, be thou
as hardly drawn to strike thy wife, nay rather forbear to do it* because
thou can not find that as a means sanctified of God, to work any good upon
thy wife; and let all husbands that are bitter to their wives in this kind,
and in their passion do strike them, know, that they bear no true love to
their wives, they are monsters amongst men, yea, they are odious in the sight
both of God and men.

VER. 20. Children obey your Parents in all things for that is well-pleasing to
the Lord.
The Apostle does here urge upon children, their special duty toward their
Parents, and that is obedience, he exhorts them to it, propounding his
exhortation indefinitely, in these words, (Children obey your Parents) then he
sets down how far forth they are to obey them, (namely) in all things, and
he does further strengthen and press his exhortation by force of argument,
taken from the Lords good liking of childrens obedience to their Parents, that
such obedience is pleasing, yea, exceeding acceptable, and highly well
pleasing unto the Lord, these are the general things contained in this same
verse.

Come we to the words of it, (Children) the word children in Scripture has
many acceptions, I will not stand to remember them, here it signifies, such as
are children by natural generation, Interpretation.
begotten and borne of natural Parents, and by (Parents) we are here to
understand Parents by nature, Parents in respect of natural procreation (obey)
the original word here used does properly signify to listen or hearken to
another, as the inferior does to the superior, the meaning is, to bend down
your ears, and incline your hearts, and yield unto, and obey the sayings and
doings of your Parents, that concern you, even that which they say or do to
you (in all things) we are to expound these words, by those Ephesians. 6.1. children
obey your Parents in the Lord, and so the meaning is in all things honest,
lawful and agreeable to the word of God (for that is well pleasing to the Lord
(that is) such obedience is exceeding well pleasing, and in high degree
acceptable unto the Lord, thus then conceive we the Apostles meaning in this
verse, as if he had said.

You that are children by natural generation bend down both inwardly and
outwardly to yield obedience to that which is said or done to you by your
natural Parents, and yield to them entire obedience, obey them in all things
honest and lawful, for such obedience is exceeding honest and pleasing to the
Lord. Now first of all, the special duty here urged upon children The
special duty of children to their Parents, is obedience.
I will still hold my former method and order in handling of it.

First, I will show what this obedience here required is.

Secondly, wherein it consists. The order observed in handling this duty.


Thirdly, the extent touching the persons that are to yield it.

Fourthlie, how far forth it is to be yielded by children to their Parents,
and then after some application of things delivered, I will bring some motives
to stir up children to the practice of it. Childrens obedience to their
Parents described.


First therefore know that this obedience is a voluntary and hearty yielding
(so far forth as children are able) to the voice and wills of their
Parents, a yielding from the heart willingly (as they are able) to that which
is said by Parents to children, and by Parents, willed to be done or suffered
of their children. I say a voluntary and hearty yielding, for that is the
condition of all true sound and sincere obedience both to God and man, and so
it ought to be qualified, if it be forced, it is no true obedience, it is then
but as the obedience of Devils and reprobates, who, will they, nill they, are
subject to the will of God, yea both do and suffer what the divine providence
has appointed, and if it be a yielding with grudging, murmuring, or the least
repining, it is no sound obedience, and therefore childrens obedience to their
parents must be a voluntary and hearty yielding (as they are able) to that
which is said and willed by them to be done or suffered of their children.

Now this willing and hearty yielding of children unto the voice and will of
their parents, stands in two things. Childrens obedience to their Parents,
stands in two things.


First in a cheerful yielding to that which parents teach, counsel, and
command, though the things commanded be never so base or painful Prou. 1.8.
My son says Solomon, hear thy fathers instruction, and forsake not thy
mothers teaching, and that children are to yield to the commandments of their
parents, it is clear from the general, that every soul is to be subject
unto the higher powers, Romans the thirteenth and first, parents have their
authority from God, and as they are parents they bear Gods image, and their
commandments, not contrarying the word of God, carry the print of Gods
commandments.

Secondly, the yielding of children to their Parents stands in a quiet and
patient suffering of that which Parents inflict and lay upon them in word or
deed, be it admonition, reproof or correction, yea, though the correction
be with just cause, or more excessive then it ought to be, Proverbs the
thirteenth and first, A wise son will obey the instruction of his father, but
a scorner will hear no rebuke, Proverbs 15.5. A fool despises his fathers
instruction, but he that regards correction is prudent, Hebrews the twelfth
and ninth, we have had the fathers of our bodies which corrected us, and we
gave them reverence.

And again, Parents are bound, yea, it is a duty lying on them to rebuke and
correct the children offending, and therefore it is a duty of children to
submit themselves to their rebukes and chasticements: that is one part of their
obedience.

Now the extent of obedience to Parents, touching the persons that are to
yield it, is implied in the first word (children) the Apostle speaking here
also without limitation, not saying children that are young, children that are
unmarried, All children without ex^eption are to yield obedience to their
Parents.
or that live in their fathers house, or ye sons or ye daughters, but ye
children, indefinitely, he give us to understand that this duty of obedience
to Parents, belongs to all children whatsoever, and it is neither age, nor
place, nor condition that exempteth sons or daughters, from yielding
obedience to their Parents.

Here therefore by the way are the Papists justly to be taxed as the Pharisees
were, Popish doctrine touching childrens wives directly contrary to Gods word.
Mat. 15.6. they make the commandments of God of no authority touching
childrens obedience to their Parents, by their own invention, for they hold
and teach that in case of vowing, a Maid once out of her nonage, that is (say
they) at twelve years old or above, may vow her self a Nun; and a young
man out of his nonage, likewise (say they) at fourteen years or above may
vow himself a Monk with consent of Parents, yea, directly contrary to the
express will and commandment of Parents, this is a devilish doctrine, and
directly contrary to the express commandment of God; a child, son or
daughter, is not exempt from obedienee to Parents at any age, and we find it
directly said, numbers 30.6. that the father may make void the vow of his
child, though pertaining to Gods worship, much more a vow made without warrant
of the word of God, nothing at all pertaining to his worship, but rather
irreligious and tending to the dishonor of God.

Yet here two questions are to be resolved.

First, whether the son being a Magistrate, and the father none, or inferior
unto him, ought to obey his father.

Answer:

And again:

In things that may further him in the execution of his office, the son is
also to obey his father, thus did Moses, Exodus the eighteenth and twenty four
verse, the text says, he obeyed the voice of his father in Law, and did all
that he said, but if the father council or command any thing against that
place and office, then the son is not to obey him.

A second question is this, whether a good child is to obey a wicked father.

Answer, a good child is to obey a wicked father as he is a father, not as
he is a wicked man and commandes wicked things, for a difference is to be
made between the office and calling of a father, and the person that bears
that office, and a good child is to obey his wicked father, as he bears the
office of a father, for so he bears the image of God, but not as a wicked
person commanding wicked things.

Now the fourth thing propounded to be spoken of, namely, how far forth
obedience is to be yielded by children to their parents. How far forth
children are to obey their Parents.


That is laid before us in these words (in all things) understanding them as
before they were expounded, namely) in all things honest and lawful, and
agreeable to the word of God, children are so far forth to obey their
earthly Parents, as may stand with their obedience to God their heavenly
father, if parents would pull their children from God, from his truth or from
their obedience to him, children are then to shake off natural affection, and
as one says well, they are to reserve to the Father of Spirits, holiness and
freedom of soul, but if Parents command their children things lawful or
indifferent, therein they are (as they are able) to yield obedience, though the
things commanded be most painful Philip. 2.8. the Apostle says, Christ was
obedient to his father to the death, yea, to the most painful and ignominious
death of the cross.

Now here also comes a question to be answered, it may be demanded, whether
a child that is marriageable, if the father command him or her to marry, is
to obey him?

Parents indeed have power to dispose their children in marriage, and they are
not to marry without their consent; and the Father commanding the child to
marry, the child is to obey two things concurring with the commandment of the
Father.

First if the child be willing.

Secondly, if the Father command the child only thus far (namely) to marry
with a person thus, or thus well quallified, as with one of honest life and
conversation with one of sound religion, as Isaac commanded Jacob, Gen 28 1.2.
and not with this, or that particular person, the child having no mind there
to match, if these two thing meet with the commandment of the Father, then
doubtless, the child is to obey his commandment.

Now if children try themselves by the thing delivered, Childrens failings in
their duty to their parents, discovered.
Where is the child to be found, that yields to that which is said, or done by
his parents willingly? Do not many children do that which they are bidden,
with a backward look, with murmuring, whispering, and much repining? Do not
some except against it, as too base, or to painful? And are there not many
children who cleave to their own will and wisdom and think they know well
enough how to carry themselves, and so despise the counsel of their parents,
especially in matters of marriage, and calling, and things of greatest moment?
Where is the child that does quietly and patiently bear the rebukes and
chastisements of his parents? Do not many children in that respect, even
oppose against their parents, and resist them, especially if they be grown to
any strength and years? Yea, some think that when they are grown to years,
when indeed, they ought to be most obedient, that then they ought not to be
so much as once rebuked by their parents for any fault, then carnal reason
teaches them to say, they are fools that will digest reproves and checkes,
and suffer themselves to be censured, yea they shall have others to put it
into their heads, that they are now past children, will you be thus used?
Will you bear this? Why, you are now 21. years old, you are past a child,
and hereupon many children take heart to themselves to be stubborn, and
disobedient to their parents, and many ways besides these, do children show
themselves undutiful, and disobedient to their parents. Well, thou art a
child, examine thy self by that which has been delivered, and finding thy
self wanting in obedience to thy parents, 3 motives to stir up children to
yield obeidience to their parents
be humbled for it, and now knowing thy duty, learn to make conscience of it.

And that thou may be stird up so to do, consider these three things.



Prou. 30.17. The eye that mocketh his Father, and despises the instruction of
his Mother, let the ravens of the valley pick it out, and the young Eagles eat
it. The meaning is, let such a one come to some untimely death, and let his
body be cast out unburied, and be devoured and eaten up of the beasts of the
field, and the fowls of the air; yea, disobedience to Parents seals up the
fearful wrath, and heavy displeasure of God. 1 Samuel 2.25. The text says,
Notwithstanding they obeyed not the voice of their Father, because the Lord
would slay them, the Lord was angry with the Sons of Ely for their
wickedness, and was purposed to slay them, and in his just judgment he made
their disobedience to their Father a punishment of their former sins, and
means to bring down his heavy wrath upon them.

And last of all, consider the Apostles argument, obedience Prou. 1.9. it will
grace and beautify thine heart and life, in such sort, as thou shall seem
amiable both to God and men; if then thou would not make it clear to the
discomfort of thine own soul, that thou art not yet in the state of grace; if
thou would not seal it up that the Lord is highly displeased with thee, and
has a purpose to destroy thee; and if on the contrary thou would do that
which is exceeding pleasing to the Lord, then be thou stird up, of what age or
sex soever thou art, to yield obedience to thy parents in all honest and
lawful things; even willingly yield thou to that which they say, or do to
thee, and quietly and patiently submit thy self to their rebukes, admonitions
and chasticements.

Having thus seen the special duty here urged upon children, let us
proceed to some other things that yet remain to be observed in this verse,
and in the next place, its not to be passed by without observation, that the
Apostle says not, children obey your Fathers only, or children obey your
Mothers alone, but he uses a word common to both, and says, obey your
parents, as

We see then that obedience is required of children to both their parents,
children are to yield obedience, Children are to yield obedience both to father
and mother.
both to Father and Mother, the first Commandment expreslie says, honor thy
Father and thy Mother. And Prou. 10.1. express mention is made of the Mother
as well as of the Father, A wise Son makes a glad Father, but a foolish Son
is an heaviness to his Mother. So again, Prou. 15.20. A wise son reioiceth
the Father, but a foolish man despises his mother. We find it expressly
commanded by the Lord, that children should fear both Father and Mother,
Leuit. 19.3. Yea, there the Mother is put before the Father: Ye shall fear
every man his mother and his father, says the Lord. Touching the practice of
this duty, we have an example without all exception, even of Christ himself,
Luke 2.51. Its there said, He came down from Jerusalem to Nazaret, and was
subject, or obedient to his Father and mother.

Now this serves to discover the wickedness and sin of such children as
pretend to yield, and happily do yield obedience to their Fathers, and yet
notwithstanding, make small account of their Mothers, The wickedness of
children who yield obedience to their Fathers, but lightly regard their mothers,
discovered.
and lightly regard their commandments, or their chastisements, in word or
deed; this is the fault of many graceless children and of sons especially;
and especially, when they begin to grow to years, then they seeing and
noting the mothers infirmities, the weakness of their sex, and how unable
they are to punish them for their disobedience, and their inferior authority
in the family, and chiefly in this, that they have little or nothing to do
in disposing of lands or goods, they easily grow to some contempt, or at least,
neglect of duty and obedience to theit mothers: but let all children that have
any care to please God, set against all these things Gods Commandment, that
binds them to yield obedience to their Mothers, as well as to their Fathers,
and know it for a truth, thou do not yield obedience to thy Father for
conscience toward God, but in some other sinister and by-respect, because he
can reward thy obedience, or punish thy contempt, if thou yield it (...) not
also to thy mother; and withal remember that obedience to thy parents, not to
thy father alone or mother alone, but to both Father and mother is the
obedience that pleases God, if thou think to please God by obeying the one,
and denying obedience to the other, thou deceiuest thy self, and if these
things move thee not to this duty, yet at least consider with thy self, the
great pains of thy Mother, peculiar to her, what it cost her in thy breading,
bearing, and bringing forth, she bare thee in her womb with much sorrow and
grief, and at last, with great pain and danger brought thee forth, and
being brought forth, her pains and care intending of thee, far surpassed the
pains and care of thy Father, and it may be her love was ever greater toward
thee, then the love of thy Father, and ought not these things to prevail with
thee, to yield her reverence and obedience, as well as to thy Father? If they
do not, surely it argues, thou art either exceeding blockish and void of
understanding, or else altogether unnatural to thy mother.

Now, here happily it may be demanded,

For answer to this, we must know there be three things that a child does owe
to his Parents, (namely) reverence, obedience, and relief and maintenance, if
the Parents be in any want: and the third and last of these, The unnaturalness
of children who deny relief to their poor and distr^ssed, and helpelesse
Parents.
the very light of nature teaches, (and by the way to touch it) If a child
deny to succor and relieve (according to his power) the poor, old,
distressed, and helpless Father or Mother, he is worse then some bruit
creatures: its said of the Storks that when they are old they keep the nest
continually, and their young birds (by the instinct of nature) provide for
them, and feed them till they die. Think on this, thou that think thy poor
Father, or mother, a burden and a clog to thee, and think every day a year
till they be dead, art thou worse then an unreasonable creature? and can
thou then think there is any grace in thee? Certainly no, it cannot be that
there is any dram of grace in the heart of that child who denies relief to
his poor helpelesse parents, yea, who spares it not from his own back, and
from his own belly, to relieve his poor old Father or Mother (but that by the
way.)





Moses, Exodus 18.24. Ruth to Naomi, her mother in law, Ruth 3.5. Yea, Christ
our Savior was obedient to his supposed Father, Luke 2.51. And the Prophet
Micah 7.6. reckons it up among the great sins of his time, that the daughter in
law rose up against her mother in law; therefore doubtless, children are to
yield obedience, not only to their natural parents, but also to their fathers
in law, and to their step-mothers.

Observe we further that the Apostle urging children to yield obedience to
their parents; he says, Children obey your Parents in all things, for that is
well-pleasing unto the Lord: that thing (namely) obedience to parents is
wel-pleasing to the Lord.

Hence comes a question to be discussed, (namely) this,

To this I answer: Romans 8.8. They that are in the flesh cannot please God: and
it is a true rule, that the person must first please God, Note.
before his personal actions, as they are his actions can be pleasing unto
him, but as that obedience is an action, and a duty considered in the abstract
that is by it self apart from the person, its pleasing to God, because its a
thing commanded of God, and simply good in it self, in it own nature, as is
hearing of the word, praying and such like, as these things considered in
themselves, and by themselves are good, and pleasing to God, though not as they
come from unregenerate and unbelieving persons, so is obedience to Parents, yet
know we thus much further, that howsoever obedience to Parents, yielded by
children unbelieving, as it is their personal obedience, cannot please God;
yet no doubt, the Lord of his exceeding bounty does sometimes vouchsafe
temporal good things, and blessings, Note.
even to such obedience. Note.
Such is the rich goodness of our good and gracious God, as of his abundant
mercy, he does sometimes give outward blessings, even to the civil obedience
and outward good carriage of hypocrites and unbelievers.

Will we see some examples of it? No doubt Iehu King of Israel was but a
carnal man, he departed not from the sins of Ieroboham who made Israel to
sin; yet because he diligently executed that which was right in the eyes of
the Lord in some things, the Lord promised him that his posterity to the
fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel, 2. King, 10.30. Ezechiel
29.30. We find that Egypt is promised to Nebuchadnetzar, King of Babel, (a
man without question unbelieving) for his service against Tyrus. Oh then the
exeeeding rich bounty of the Lord our God.

How ought this to stir up children to yield obedience to their parents?
That is a thing to which the Lord no doubt, will sometimes of his rich bounty,
vouchafe temporal blessings, though it be performed by children unbelieving,
Therefore this ought to stir up all children to this duty, and if thou be a
child within Gods covenant, and a true believing member of Christ, let it most
of all encourage thee to yield obedience to thy Parents, and ever remember thou
to thy comfort, that if the Lord carry his eye of bounty toward them that are
without, and strangers from his fold, much more will he of his rich mercy,
reward thee that art one of his own chosen, and a sheep of his own pasture:
think on it, and remember it.

Consider we yet further, the ground of the Apostles reason in this place; he
says, Children obey your Parents in all things, for that is wel-pleasing to
the Lord: What is the ground of this? How knew the Apostle that Obedience to
Parents is a thing well-pleasing to God? Surely, he knew it from the
Commandment of God, because such obedience is commanded in the 5.
Commandment, and he knew it to be in an high degree well-pleasing to God,
because that commandment is as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 6.2. The first
Commandment (namely) of those that concern our duty to men, and the first
Commandment with promise, with a special promise annexed to it, that thy
days may be prolonged upon the land which the Lord thy God gives thee. Hence
it was that our Apostle knew this duty of obedience to parents to be
wel-pleasing, yea, better pleasing to God then any other duty of the second
Table, and this reason thus considered with these grounds of it does afford
unto us this conclusion.

That Gods good lykinge of any thing, is to be gathered from his will
revealed, Gods good liking of any thing, is to be gathered from his will
revealed.
we must gather the good liking, and aprobation of the Lord, that he likes,
and that he approues, this or that thing, from his word.

For in deed, what he wills in his word, that he likes, his will there
revealed being the rule of all our holiness and goodness: nothing done by us,
is holy and good and pleasing to him, but that which he there wills. And
hence it is, that the Apostle puts them together. To. 12.2. that we may prove
what is the good will of God, and acceptable and perfect, what God wills,
being good because he wills it, and being willed by him and so good, is also
acceptable and pleasing to him. Micha. 6.6.7. The prophet bringes in man thus
demaundinge, wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and how shall I bow my
self before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, and
calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or
with ten thousand rivers of oil? shall I give my first borne, for my
transgression: even the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul? will
these things please the Lord? and then verse. 8. The prophet answers, he has
showed thee o man what is good, and what the Lord requires of thee; surely to
do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble thy self to walk with thy God:
as if he had said, that which the LORD has showed, and revealed to thee to
be good, and that which he requires of thee in his word, that is the thing
that is pleasing to him.

Now then is it so that the LORDS good likinge, and approbation of any
thing, and that he likes this or that, and is pleased with it, is to be
gathered from his will revealed.

I might then apply this to discover the folly of the Papists, who think they
do things highly pleasing to God, yea, meriting at his hands and deserving
heaven, when they do things that can find no footing in the word of God, and
are not grounded on any commandment or example or promise in the word of God,
but are merely Idolatrous and superstitious, but not to spend time in showing
their folly.

A direction touching things done pleasing to God.
it may serve to guide us that we be not deceived, touching things done
pleasing to God, we are not to conclude things to be pleasing to God from our
own fancy and our own opinion, because we conceive and think them to be
liked of God and pleasing unto him, but from the word and promise of God, many
deceive themselves in this respect, they think they do things highly well
pleasing to God, and such as he does greatly like and approve of, when
indeed and truth there is no such matter, for example, do not many think
that their true and just dealing with men, their giving every man his own,
and the like things done by them, are things exceeding well pleasing to the
Lord, though those deeds come not from any sanctified heart, nor from the
root of a sound justifying faith, nor yet are done with any regard of Gods
glory?

Do not many thus think? it is too evident, they do, and in respect of doing
such things, they think they are greatly in Gods favor, indeed it cannot be
denied, but that such things for the substance of them, and considered in
themselves, and by themselves are grounded on the commandments of God, but
thou must further know that they must also be done in such manner as the word
has prescribed, they must proceed from faith purging thine heart from the
natural corruption of it, and they must be done in love to God, Heb. 11.6.
Romans 14.23.
and with respect of his glory, else its impossible they should please God, and
therefore do not thou gather and conclude that God is well pleased, with the
things thou do only because the things done are good in themselves, if thou
do, thou deceauest tby self, thou gatherest Gods acceptance and good liking
only from thine own fancy, and the devil and thine own corrupt heart deceive
thee, and thus are many thousands deceived, it was Paul's case before his
conversion, when he was in the worst case, he thought himself in the best,
and before he knew the meaning of the law, he made no doubt but he was alive,
but when he saw the sense and strict justice of the commandment he found
sin alive in him, and himself dead, and so thousands in the world being as
yet in their natural corruption, think they do things highly pleasing to
God, but alas they deceive themselves, and therefore if thou tender thine own
good, take thou heed of it, Romans 7 9.10.
and remember that thou must not only do good things, that is, things
warranted by the word of God, but in that manner that the word has prescribed
with an heart purged by faith, with a love to God, and a due respect to his
glory, that thou may gather Gods good liking and approbation of things done
by thee, and if it be otherwise with thee, surely the good things done by thee
are hateful to God, and they bring in the end but everlasting death upon thy
soul.

VER. 21. Fathers provoke not your children to anger, least they be
discouraged.
In this verse the Apostle coming particularly to speak to parents touching
their duty toward their children, he sets down what he requires of them by way
of prohibition or dehortation, he forbids that, and dehorts them from that
wherein commonly parents are faulty, and wherein they many times offend, and
that is immoderate severity and rigorous dealing with their children which is
expressed by the effect it commonly works in children, that it stirs them up
to anger, and the Apostle does direct his dehortation, specially to fathers,
and says, Fathers provoke not your children to anger, because if either of the
Parents offend in rigor toward their children, it is commonly the father, the
mother, more usually offending on the contrary part, by too much indulgence
and tenderness, therefore the Apostle says, Fathers provoke not your children
to anger, and this prohibition or dehortation, he does further strengthen by
an argument taken from the dangerous event of immoderate severity and rigor of
Parents toward their children, namely their deiection of mind, their
discouragement, least (says the Apostle) they be discouraged, and so the sum
and substance of this ver, is a dehortation used to Parents, especially to
fathers, dissuading them from rigor toward their children, and from hard
usage of them for fear of their discouragement.

By fathers we are here to understand natural Parents, Interpretation.
both fathers and mothers, though the Apostle (for the reason before yielded,
does thus direct his dehortation, the word here rendered (provoke not to anger)
properly signifies to exasperate, and to stir up to anger by disgraceful
terms, and by contumelious speeches, but we are to take it in a larger sense
and signification according to that Ephesians. 6.4 Where in our English
translation, we have in effect the same words, that here we find, but in the
original, there is a different word used by the Apostle (...) a word reaching
further, and comprehending more under it, signifying to irritate or to stir
up to anger any way, to give children any occasion of anger, and that unjust
and sinful anger, even such as is spoken of Ephesians. 4.25. let not the sun
go down upon your wrath, the word is there also (...), (that is) unjust and
sinful anger, so then that word in the Ephesians, and this considered
together, the meaning is, fathers do not exasperate and stir up your
children any way either by word or deed to unjust and sinful anger, or
rather thus, use no hard and rigorous dealing with your children, whereby they
may have occasion to be stirred up to unjust and sinful anger, least they
be discouraged, (that is) least they be dejected and cast down in their
minds, and put out of all heart (for so the word signifies) least they be put
out of all courage, and comfort, and even despair of doing any thing pleasing
unto you.

Thus then we are to conceive the Apostles meaning in the words of this verse,
as if he had said.

You that are natural Parents, and especially you fathers, do not you abuse
your fatherly authority over your children, do not you any way exasperate and
stir up your children to anger, use not you any hard and rigorous dealing
toward them, whereby they may have occasion to be stirred up to unjust and
sinful anger; least you so doing, your childrens minds be dejected in
them, and they put clean out of heart, and lose all courage and comfort, and
even despair of doing any thing pleasing unto you. I might here note that of
Parents, which before we observed of husbands, verse the nineteenth, that
Parents also are prone to abuse their authority over their children, and
therefore the Apostle thought it most fit, to check that pronenesse, and to
warn Parents, especially, and above all things, to avoid rigor and immoderate
severity toward their children, Note.
and indeed it is the common fault of all superiors (if they be not
sanctified) to abuse their authority, and to exercise rigor and tyranny over
such as be under them: but I will not stand on that, having already handled it:
Here we may see it plainly laid before us.

Parents must take heed of rigorous dealing with their children.
they are not to use any immoderate severity toward them.

And this is clear, both from this text, and that also, Ephesians. 6.4.

The reason Rigorous dealing of Parents with their children is in 3. things.
Either in commanding their children unjust or unreasonable things, when they
seeing the pliablenesse of their Saul, he was a wicked man, and he added this
to the measure of his sin he abused his fatherly authority in all these three
things, 1. Sam. 20. from verse 30. to the end of the 33. we find that Saul in
his rage commanded Jonathan his son a most unjust thing, even to bring David
to him, that he might kill him, and what could be more unjust, that a kind
friend should bring his dear friend, and that an innocent man should deliver
another innocent party into the hands of his malicious enemy that meant to
shed his blood? yea he reviled him verse 30. he called him the son of the
wicked and rebellious woman, the son of an impudent whore, in plain terms,
bastard, and he went yet further, verse 33. he cast a spear at him to hit
him, with a purpose to kill him, this manner of rigorous dealing of a wicked
and wretched father toward his son, has the Scripture recorded to teach all
Parents to avoid the like, and that they seeing the rigorous dealing of a
father toward his child pointed out in the book of God, as one of the great
sins of wicked Saul, might take notice of it, that it ought to be far from
all those that would not be like so wicked a father, and what Parents soever
make any conscience of their duty, ought to be far from extreme rigor and
immoderate severity, toward their children, either in their commands, or in
their reproves, or their corrections.

Now herein many Parents are faulty, Reproof of Parents dealing rigorously
with their children.
even things beyond their ability and strength, and if such things be not
done, abridge them of their meat and drink, and of things needful, and do
not some Parents load their children with most odious and foul names, calling
them rogues, rascals, and filthy carrions, dogs, and the like.

Yea, (which is strange) specially in the mother, sometimes calling the child
(Whore-sonne) if the child be the son of an whore, what is then the mother;
yet see how some Parents, rather then they will want a foul (by-name) for
their child, will not stick to lay a blot on themselves, and are there not
some, who in beating their children are extremely rigorous, and handle them as
if they were no better then dogs? Nay surely, one of tender bowels, would
not so use his dog as some Parents in their rage use (or rather abuse) their
children, yea, I wish there were not some who do vaunt of their rigor and
severity, and say, they will make them know that they are their Parents,
these things are too common in the world.

Well, let such as know themselves faulty in these things, be humbled for
that which is past, and henceforth learn to know, that it is a great and
grievous sin in thee whosoever thou art to be extremely rigorous and severe
in thy dealing with thy children, either in requiring things above the strength
of thy child, or in thy censuring of him, either in word or deed, and do not
thou think with thy self, what skils it, what matter is it if I deal with my
child as I list? am not I his father, and must not he, will he nill he, be
subject to me, and to my authority? it is true, indeed thy child is to be
subject to thy power and authority.

If thou command him some unjust and unlawful thing, howsoever thy child is
not to obey thee in doing of that, yet if thou add further rigor, and fall
upon him, and beat him for not doing of it, thy child is not to mutter or
murmr against thee, and if he be stirred up to any impatience, that is
his fault, yet thou must know that thy power and authority over thy child is
limited also, Two things to be considered of Parents who deal rigorously with
their children
thou may not use it after thine own pleasure, and be rigorous and
outrageous in thy dealing with thy child, if thou be, surely thou art an
unnatural Parent, thou sinnest against the light of nature even bruit beasts
will love their young ones, and use them lovingly, and if nature require this
at thy hand, what then should grace work in thine heart? Think on it, and
withal remember the Apostles argument in this place, thy hard and injurious
dealing with thy child, will dull and discourage him, it cannot otherwise
choose, because thou art so nearly bound to thy child, and thy child to thee;
when the child shall consider, it is my Father, or my mother, who should do
me most good, that deals thus hardly with me, and does me most ill: Oh, it is
a great discouragement to the child, it takes from the child all courage to
any good duty, either in thy service, or in the service of God, and therefore
take heed of it.

Happily some will say,

Yes doubtless, they are, It is a fault in Parents to be to indulgent to
their children.
so on the other side it is also a fault in them to be too remiss, and too
indulgent, and too much to tender and cocker them, this was David's fault, 1.
Kin. 1.6. the text says, He would not displease Adoniah his Son from his
childhood, to say, why have thou done so? And this is the fault of too many
Parents in these days, and especially of many foolish mothers, who so dandle
their children, and are so vainelie pleased with them, that even their faults
also please them; they delight to hear them swear, and to missecall others;
this is to let loose the reins of fatherly authority, and to lay the bridle
on the necks of their children, and so doing, they make them wantons, and
dissolute persons, and as much as in them is, bring the curse of God upon their
children.

Censure and correction of children is necessary, for as Solomon says, Prou.
22.15. Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rodd of
correction shall drive it away from him; there is a bundle of frowardness,
stubbornness, vanity, and wickedness, bound up in the heart of a child; Job
11.12. A man newborn is like a wild Ass colt, but the rod of correction
shall drive it away from him. It is therefore Salomons counsel, Prou.
23.13.14. Withhold not correction from the child, If thou smite him with the
rod, he shall not die thou shall smite him with the rod, and shall deliver
his soul from hell. Parents therefore are to correct their children offending,
and if they do not, they sin; but they must take heed their censure and
correction be not extreme, and unmeasurable, they must look to the measure
of it, that they exceed not measure in it, and that it may be such as may
profit their children. 3. Rules to be observed in correcting of children.


And to that purpose, these rules are fit to be thought upon, and observed.





give thee a wise heart to give correction, and thy child a soft heart to
receive it with patience, and to profitte by it.

And if these rules be observed of thee in the correcting of thy child,
doubtless thou shall do it with mildness, and without rigor, and thou shall
do it with profit to thy child, and with comfort to thy self; yea, thy child
in such manner corrected will give pleasures to thy soul, Prou. 29.17. He
will utter such gracious speeches, do such righteous deeds, and have such
comely gestures, and practice such obedience and thankfulness toward thee,
as shall much delight thy soul; therefore remember the rules propounded.

Mark we further, the Apostle lays down his prohibition in these terms:
Provoke not your children to anger: Where we see, that howsoever children are
not to be provoked to unjust anger, and if they be, they cannot excuse
themselves, that they are thereunto provoked, yet Parents are not to give them
occasion of such anger; Parents are not to stir them up to it by their
rigorus dealing with them.

Hence we may raise this general truth.

Though no evil spring but from an evil root, nor issue Though every evil
do spring from an evil root, yet men sin in provoking others to evil.
nor to give them occasion to it; for although man can excuse himself by
saying, I was provoked to th^s or that evil, yet is not he without his sin,
but many times his sin is the greater, as our Savior said to Pilate, Ioh
19.11. Who has provoked and stird up another to evil For that is (indeed) to
lay a stumbling block before another, and a fearful woe is denounced against
every one by whom offenses come, Math. 18.7. Woe be unto the world because of
offenses,

Reproof of such as delight to stir up others to sin, and the greatness
of that sin discovered.
This serves to discover the sin of such as use to provoke the choleric to
anger, the drunkard to excess in drinking, the contentious person to
quarrelling and take pleasure, and make themselves sport in stirring up others
to sin; thou must know, whosoever thou art, that in so doing thou make thy
self guilty of great sin; for in so doing thou seruest the Devils turn,
thou art his instrument, yea thou take on thee the Devils trade, and that is
the worst trade in the world; its his trade and manner to spy out to what
sin men are most naturally inclined, and there to assault them, and will thou
be like the Devil?

Again, consider with thy self, with what conscience can thou be a means
to draw others into temptation, whereas the Lord requires thee to pray for thy
self and others, Lead us not into temptation? And remember thou the
punishment of the Serpent, Genesis 3.14. for being an instrument of the Devil in
tempting our first Parents; if the natural Serpent was so plagued for being
an instrument of the Devil in his temptation, vnknowingly, what shall become
of thee, if thou apply thy wit, thy tongue, and heart, to do him service in
this kind? Surely, as thou art the Devils instrument, and like him in thy
practice, so thou may justly look one day to be like him in punishment:
and if they that turn many to righteousness, shall one day shine as the
stars for ever and ever, Dan 12.3. Then surely, thou that turnest many from
righteousness, and stirrest them up to sin, shall be as black as the
blackness of Hell, and to thee as Jude speaks verse 13. is reserved the
blackenesse of darkness for ever. Think on it, and know it is not so small a
matter, as its commonly thought to be, to make others drunk, or stir then
to any sin.

One thing further, may be briefly noted from this verse (namely) this, that
the Apostle would not have childrens minds discouraged, Fathers provoke not
your chidren to anger, least they be discouraged, says the Apostle, he would
not have their minds daunted and cast down in them.

Hence we are taught.

That Parents are chiefly to take heed of doing any Parents must take great
heed of doing any thing that daunt the minds of their children and discourage
them from good things.
they are rather to encourage, and to hearten them to every good duty; yea, if
parents epsy but any good mind, and good inclination in their children, if
they discern but any seed of grace, or good gift, springing up in their minds
or hearts, if they perceive any pronenesse in them to religion, any desire
after some special good calling, as happily to the Ministry, or the like, they
are to cheerish it, and according to their power, they are to use all good
means that it may be increased, at least to water that tender budde with the
drops of sweet counsel, and with the word of comfort and encouragement, and to
send up to heaven by prayer, that the Lord would warm it by his spirit, and
rain down his blessing upon it, that it may grow to some ripeness.

They are altogether unworthy the name of parents, Reproof of such Parents as
grieve at the good graces of their children.
and restrain them from all means whereby they might attain to further
increase of them. Good Parents, and they have any soundness of grace in their
own hearts, will be glad and much rejoice to see the lest beginning of grace in
their children, they delight to see grace in any other whosoever, but most of
all appearing in their own children, Note.
and they will carefully use al good means that serve for the increase of it,
and they will ever encourage and hearten on their children in every good duty.

VER. 22. Servants be obedient unto them that are your Masters, according to
the flesh, in all things, not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but in
singleness of heart, fearing God.
The Apostle having laid down the special duties of those in the Family, who
are more nearly tied one to another. Now he comes to the duties of such as are
less bound one to another, (namely) to the duties of Masters and Servants, and
following his former order, he begins with the duty of servants, and the
condition of servants being harder then any other, he sets down their duty in
more words then any of the rest.

First exhorting to it in the 22. and 23. verses, and then strengthening his
exhortation by force of argument, verse. 24.25.

In this 22. verse, we have two things in general laid before us.

First, the duty of servants generally propounded by way of exhortation in
these words. Servants be obedient unto them that are your Masters according to
the flesh, in all things, and then the manner of their obedience in the words
following, Not with eye-seruice, as men-pleasers, but in singlenes of heart,
fearing God. Touching the exhortation to the duty more particularly the
Apostle does first propound it, and exhort to it indefinitely, Servants be
obedient to your masters) and then he amplifies his exhortation both by
describing their masters, that they are their masters according to the flesh,
and by setting down how far forth obedience is to be yielded unto them,
(namely) in all things: Servants be obedient unto them that are your Masters
according to the flesh, in all things.

Let us first examine the words of this exhortation touching the sense and
meaning of them.

(Servants) In the time of the Apostle when he writ this Epistle,
Interpretation.
such were properly called (Servants) as were taken in war, and kept in
bondage, or such as were bought with money, and indeed slaves to their masters,
but we are to take the word in a larger sense, for servants of any sort
whosoever, even such as our servants are, who serve for wages, or as
Aprentices, (be obedient) the original word here used is the same we had,
verse 20. and the meaning is the same; Servants listen and hearken to your
masters, and yield to them, and obey them in that they say, or do to you,
(according to the flesh) these words have relation to the word (Masters)
Masters according to the flesh, and the meaning is, to your masters who have
power only over your bodies and not over your souls and consciences (in all
things) that is, in all things your masters say, or do to you, being things
honest and lawful, for so much is implied in that masters have power only
over the bodies of their servants, and not over their souls, so as if the
master command his servant any thing against the liberty of a good conscience,
he is not therein to be obeyed.

Thus then we are to conceive the meaning of these words, as if the Apostle
had said.

You that are servants of any sort whatsoever, do you yield to that which is
said, or done to you by your Masters, who have power over your bodies, but not
over your souls and consciences, yield to them entire obedience, obey them in
all things, honest and lawful. Now here, first, the special duty of
obedience due Servants are bound to yield obedience to their masters.
and touching that, I will show first what that obedience is.

The order observed in handling that obedience
Secondly, wherein it consists.

Thirdly, the persons whom it concerns.

And fourthly, how far forth it is to be yielded by servants to their
Masters; then after some particular examination, I will add some motives to
stir up servants to this duty.

What the obedience of servants to their masters is.
First therefore know, that this obedience is a willing, and cheerful yielding
of servants to the voice and will of their masters, even a cheerful yielding
to that which is said to them of their masters, and willed by their masters to
be done or suffered of them.

Servants obedience to their masters is in two things.
And this willing and cheerful yielding of servants to the voice and will of
their masters stands in two things.

First, in a cheereful doing of things commanded by their Luke 17.7. Christ
sets down this clearly, ween he says, Which of you is it that having a
servant plowing, or feeding cattle, would say unto him by and by, when he were
come from the field, go, and sit down at table: as if he had said, if a
servant that has been toiling all the day long in following the plow, or the
like labor, at night when he comes home weary and hungry, be commanded by
his master a further service, he is not to refuse to do it, he is still to
do what his master commands him.

Pet. 2.18. Servants says the Apostle, be subject to your Masters with all
fear, not only to the good and courteous, but also to the froward, even to
such as are froward, crabbed, and perverse, and wrongfully buffet you, for so
it follows, verse. 20.21. For what praise is it, if when ye be buffeted for
your faults ye take it patiently? but and if ye do well, ye suffer wrong
and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.

Servants are in silence to suffer the checks and rebukes of their masters, not
answering again as it is Tit. 2.9. not muttering or murmuring, not giving one
word for another, and they are patiently to bear that correction that is laid
on them by their masters, though it be unjust or excessive, and therefore say
not then, being a servant, when thou art unjustly corrected, I deserve not to
be so roughly dealt withal, but remember thou deseruest more at Gods hand for
some other sin, and the hand of thy master is but the instrument of God, for
the punishment or correction of that other sin which is in thee.

Now for the persons whom this duty concerns, The duty of obedience to masters
concerns all servants whatsoever they be.
that is laid down in the first word (Servants) the Apostle here also not
limiting this duty to servants, of this or that sort, but saying indefinitely
(servants) we are given to understand that the duty belongs to all servants,
whether they be bound to their masters, or serve for wages, or howsoever, say
not thou, I am but a Journey man, or I am but hired for a day, or my master is
my brother, my uncle, or my kinsman, and therefore I am not bound to such duty
and obedience as others, no, no, remember that Jacob served his uncle Laban
Genesis the twenty nine. If thou be a servant, to whomsoever, or for how long
or how short a time, thou art bound to yield obedience to him that is thy
master, both willingly, doing what he commaundes thee, and patiently
suffering what he lays on thee, either in word or deed.

Forth the fourth thing, A servant must obey his master in all things honest
and l^wfull.
how far forth this duty is to be yielded by servants to their masters,
that is expressed in these words (in all things) thou art a servant, thou must
yield obedience to thy Master not in some things, such as are most easy, or
do best agree with thine own fancy, doing what likes thee, but thou art to
do what things soever pleases thy master, Tit. 2.9. what he will have thee
do, being not contrary to the word of God, being things honest and lawful,
indeed if thy master command thee to lie, to swear, or the like, thou art not
therein to yield to his commandment, but in all indifferent and lawful
things, obedience must be yielded by the servant to his master.

Trial of servants touching their duty of obedience to their Masters, and
their failings therein discovered.
out of question most servants will, find themselves far short of that duty
they owe to their masters.

It is a general complaint that servants were never worse then now in these
days, and indeed scarce one servant of a thousand makes conscience of that
obedience that is due to his master, where is almost the servant to be found
that yeeldes willing and cheerful obedience to the voice and will of his
Master, or Mistress, or Dame, for the word (Masters) is to be understood of
both? where is that servant that willingly does that which is commanded by his
Master, or Mistress or Dame, and with meekness and patience bears that
rebuke or correction they lay on him or her? Nay, do not many servants, being
bidden do one thing do another, and even what they list themselves? and if
they be rebuked are they not ready to reply? do they not answer again, and
give one hard word for another? are they not sometimes as loud as their
masters? and if they be corrected do they not many times take the staff by
the end, and resist? yea, do they not sometimes curse their Master or
Mistress, or Dame, and wish a plague or mischief to light on him, or her, or
on the hand that strikes them? those things and many other of like sort, are
too common with servants, and are matters of just complaint in the mouths of
most governors of families.

Well, let all servants now call themselves to a strict account, and examine
themselves touching this duty of obedience toward their masters by that which
has been said, and finding that thou have heretofore failed, be humbled for
thy failing, thy disobedience to thy master is one of thy great sins, and
till thou be humbled for that, thou have no true repentance.

Therefore this day before to morrow be humbled for that, and learn
henceforwarde to make conscience of yielding due obedience, to thy Master. 2.
Motives to stir up servants to yield obedience to their Masters.


And to help thee forward, consider with me that so long as thou art
disobedient to thy master, thou cannest

Again, consider that thy master is but thy master acaccording of God, who can
and will without thy true repentance, destroy both body and soul in the fire
of hell, then in the fear of God, be thou stirred up to yield willing and
cheerful obedience to thy Master, do that thou art commanded, be it never so
base or laborious, being a thing lawful, and suffer with meekness and
patience that rebuke and correction that is laid on thee by thy Master, and if
thy Master correct thee unjustly, consider thou that it is the Lords will thou
should be under so sharp a master, and he calls thee to suffer a little
for his sake, who gave his own son to suffer so much for thee, if thou
belong to Christ, therefore submit thy self and bear it quietly, and lay
aside all reasonings of the flesh that rise up to the contrary.

As happily thou will say, I could be content to bear rebukes and correction
too at the hands of my master, if he were a man of any account or reckoning in
the world, were he a magistrate or a minister, or some other man, but alas my
master is a poor silly man, one of the poorest in the place where he dwells,
and therefore I cannot so well digest his rebukes, and so patiently take
correction at his hand.

Take thou heed of this kind of reasoning, this comes from the suggestion of
Satan, and from thine own corruption, and know it for a truth, that be thy
master never so poor, he has as much authority over thee, as the greatest
man has over his servant, his poverty does nothing detract from his authority
over thee, neither ought it to lessen thine obedience to him, and therefore
make conscience of it to yield obedience to thy master, be he never so poor,
or of never so mean condition in the world. And so much of the special duty
of servants here laid before us.

One thing yet remains to be observed in these words namely the description
of masters; they are masters according to the flesh, that is, such as have full
power only over the bodies, and not over the souls of their servants, here
is then matter of comfort for servants that are under hard and cruel masters,
Comfort for servants that are under cruel masters.
thy cruel master is but Master over thy body, he can but exercise his
cruelty over that, he can never hurt thy soul, and he can use his power over
thee, but during the time of this frail and mortal life, in the grave the
servant is free from his master, Job. 3.19.

Yea, if thou be a servant fearing God, and thy master a carnal man, here is
comfort for thee, thy master has only power over thy body, the chief part,
thy soul and conscience are free, yea, freer then the soul of thy master, for
he is a servant to sin, Note.
but thou art the Lords freeman, 1. Cor. 7.22. but the point espccially here
offered is this.

That the master has not authority over the soul, Masters have not authority
over the souls and consciences of their servants to impose any thing upon them
not warranted by the word of God.
no, the master is not to command the body of his servant so as may hinder the
liberty of good conscience, as to command his servant to attend him at a mass
or some idolatrous service, if the master so command his servant, he is not to
obey him, as the Apostle says, 1. Corinthians. 7.23. we are bought with a price,
be not the servants of men, the Apostle there simply forbiddes not service to
men, (for that were to contradict himself in other places) but service and
obedience to men in things not commanded by God, not warranted in the word of
God, a subjection of our wills in the case of religion to the will and
pleasure of men, it is therefore a profane speech to say, I will be of what
religion my master will have me, Reproof of such servants as pin their
religion on their masters sleeue.
that is to subject thy soul to thy Master, whereas indeed, he is but master
over thy body, thy master according to the flesh.

A Popish Objection.
Indeed says the Papist, (here he takes hold) secular masters and secular
governors, be it Prince, or whosoever, they have nothing to do in matter of
religion to impose any new thing on their inferiors, they are but masters
according to the flesh, but the Pope and his clergy, being spiritual
Masters, Masters in spiritual things, they may impose what they think meet
on their inferiors.



Come we to the second general laid down in this verse, (namely) the manner
of obedience due from servants to their masters, in these words (not with eye
service as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing God) we see here
the Apostle sets down both what manner of obedience servants ought to yield
to their masters, and the contrary to it, commanding the one, and forbidding
the other, and he begins with the contrary, which he calls eye-seruice, and
tells servants they are not to obey their masters with eye service, and least
his speech should be mistaken and misconstrued in forbidding eye service, he
further shows what manner of eye service, he forbids, namely, such as
commonly come from men pleasers, from such as only seek to please men.

Not with eye service (says the Apostle) as men pleasers, and then he comes
to the right manner of obedience thar servants are to yield their masters,
showing that it ought to be contrary to that eye service, even single or
simple hearted obedience, even such service as is done in singleness and
simplicity of heart, and he does further discover the root of that, whence
such single hearted service springs, (namely) from the fear of God. But in
singleness of heart fearing God, and that is the general resolution of the
second part of this verse, setting down the manner of obedience that servants
owe to their Masters.

Let us clear the words touching the true sense and meaning of them (with eye
service) the original word is in the plural number, Interpretation.
(not with eye services) the meaning is not with duties of obedience performed
to the eye, not doing the duties and things commanded by your masters, only in
the sight and presence of your masters only when they are present and look on
you, or may come to the knowledge of that you do, and if they turn their
backs, or the things you do shall never come to their knowledge, or at least
you so imagine, then you either sit idle, or slack your labor, or do worse,
as men pleasers, that is, as those who only care to satisfy men, and to give
them contentment for the time, and have no further respect (but in singleness
and simplicity heart (for so is the word) the single or simple heart in
Scripture, is usually opposed to a double, hypocritical, and deceitefull
heart, and by it is meanr a sound, honest, and sincere heart, and the meaning
of the Apostle is this.

But doing service to your Masters, in the simplicity and truth of your
hearts, without any manner of fraud or dissembling, even from the sincerity of
your hearts, yielding to your masters, sound, true, and faithful service,
(fearing God) (that is) carrying in your hearts as the ground of such sincere
and faithful service, a reave. rent awe and holy fear of the great and
glorious Majesty of God, even out of a holy love to him, in regard of his
mercy, and of a reverent love of him, in respect of his judgments and fearing
to offend him in any thing.

Thus then conceive we these words (not with eye-seruice, as men pleasers, but
in singleness of heart fearing God) as if the Apostle had more largely spoken
thus.

Not doing the duties and things commanded by your masters only, when your
masters are present, and look on you, or may come to the knowledge of that you
do, at othertimes being idle or remiss, in your business, or doing amiss,
as those who only care to please men, and to give them contentment and look
no further; but do you even from the sincerity of your hearts, yield to your
Masters, sound, true and faithful obedience and service, ever carrying in your
hearts a reverent awe and holy fear of God, even of a true love to him for his
mercy, and of a reuerrent awe of him in respect of his judgments, fearing to
offend him in any thing. Now first from these words, expressing the manner of
that obedience and service that is due from servants to their Masters, servants
are further taught.

That they must not only yield obedience to their masters and do the^
service, but they must do it in such manner as it ought to be done, and in
special, their obedience and service must be qualified as the Apostle has
here expressed, it must not be eye-seruice, obedience to the eye of the
masters, but single hearted service and sincere, coming from the fear of God,
servants must yield to their masters true and faithful obedience, they must
do them service truly and faithfully as well in the absence of their masters
as in their presence, as well when their masters cannot look on them, or
happily take account of their service, being employed in other affairs far
distant from them, as when their masters stand over them and behold every thing
they do.

Sincerity and faithfulness is required of servants in Sincerity and
faithfulness is required of servants in doing service to the^r masters in all
places, and at al times and in every business of their masters.
And further to prove this, besides the evidence of this text, read Tit. 2.10.
The Apostle there requires it in plain terms, that servants show all good
faithfulness to their masters, that they show their sincerity of heart in all
things, for that (as I take it) is the meaning of the Apostle, when he says
(all good faithfulness) as if he had said, servants show forth sound and
sincere faithfulness in all your obedience, and in all your services done to
your masters, not to spend time in proving the general, but rather to make it
manifest in the special branches of it: we must know there be two things
wherein that true and faithful^ service that servants are to yield to their
masters, especially consists (namely) in diligence, and in a care of their
masters good.

Servants are to yield faithful obedience to their masters, The things
wherein the faithful service of servants consists.


First, in a diligent performance of that business they are set about by their
masters, as well in their absence as in their presence, not idling and
loitering, and trifling out the time when their masters eye is from them; but
at all times, doing that business whereabout they are employed, with the
uttermost strength of their mind and body, or both, according to the quallity
of the business.

And secondly, in a care of their masters good, and profit, and his lawful
advantage, not pilfring any of the benefit of their labors to their own use,
without the consent of their masters, nor riotously and wastefully mispending
their masters meat, drink, or any of his goods, but being as careful and as
thriftie for their masters and their families as they would be for themselves
and their families, and that also as well in the absence as in the presence of
their Masters.

Will we see some examples of true and faithful service in both these kinds.
Look upon Joseph, Genes. 39. he no doubt was diligent in the works of his
masters service, as we may gather by the Lords blessing on his labors, he was
also careful of his masters goods, insomuch as the text says verse 6. That
his master left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and took account of nothing
that was with him, and verse 8. That his master knew not what he had in the
house with him, but committed all that he had to his hand.

But most excellent and memorable in this kind, is the example of Jacob, Gene.
31. verse. 38. to end of verse 40. This 20. years, says Jacob, have I been
with thee, thine ewes and thy goats have not cast their young, and the rams of
the flock have I not eaten. Verse 39. Whatsoever was torn of beasts I brought
it not to thee, but made it good my self, of mine hand did thou require it,
were it stolen by day, or stolen by night. There was his faithful care for
the the goods of his Master, he was so far from pilfring any thing from his
master, as he made good that which was lost, and for his pains and diligence,
he says, That he was in the day consumed with heat, and with frost in the
night, and his sleep departed from him. Here is indeed an example of single
hearted, and faithful service yielded by a servant to his master; let all
servants look on this example, and consider it, and if they duly consider it,
and thereby examine their own practice, no doubt it will convince most
servants of unfaithfulness toward their masters.

done to their masters, with this right line of true service, The
unfaithfulness of servants in doing service to their masters discovered.
it will discover the wickedness of their hearts, and they must needs
acknowledge they swerue far from the right manner of service they ought to yield
to their masters; Do not many servants in their masters presence seem to be
very diligent and painful, yea, careful too for the good of their masters,
and that their work may be for his best advantage, and every way seem to
yield to him true and faithful service, but if once he turn his back to
them, then they loiter and trislle out the time and care not which end goes
forward; yea if they can hide their negligence and fraud, though it be by a
lie, as Gehazi did, 2. King. 5.25. They care not, its the complaint of many
masters, and no doubt a just complaint, that their servants wili do little, or
nothing, longer then they look upon them; yea that some of their servants, if
they look not narrowly to them, will be filtching, and steal from them, and
convert their goods to their own use, or wastefully mispend them; It not this
the manner of service that many servants yield to their masters? Surely, if
they deal truly with themselves, they must needs confess it to be so:
Well, know it thou servant, whosoever thou art, that this manner of service is
but eye-seruice, this is not single, but double hearted and hypocritical
service; thou plaiest the hypocrite with thy master, and will the Lord suffer
thee to go unpunished? No, no, assure thy self the Lord does hate and abhor
hypocrisy in every thing. Thou may happily please thy self, and give ease
to thy self in thy negligence and idleness, or in thy pilfring and drawing
things from thy master to thy self, but withal thou bring woe to thy
conscience, and the curse of God on thine own soul; yea, so long as thou art
a servant only to the eye of thy master, and art unfaithful in his service,
thou eatest not thine own bread, thou live theeuishly, though thou steal
none of thy masters goods, and being idle, and in his absence neglecting his
business, thou stealest away thy labor from him, which is as due to thy master
as any of his goods; and therefore let every servant be admonished in the fear
of God, to take heed of yielding only eye service to his master, and if thou
would not be guilty of hypocrisy and theft; two foul sins bringing
fearful judgments, be thou stird up, even in singleness of heart, to do
service to thy master, truly and faithfully; be as diligent and painful in
thy masters businesses, and as careful of his lawful profit, and best
advantage in his absence, as in his presence, and as well when he is many miles
from thee, as when he is present and looks on thee, and take heed of the
sin of wicked Ziba, 2. Sam. 16.3. He was very unfaithful to his master:
consider his example, and learn to avoid his sin.

Observe we in the next place that the Apostle makes an opposition between
eye-seruice pleasing to men, and singleness of heart.

Whence it is clear.

That a servant may do service contenting the eye of his master, Note.
and pleasing to him, and yet with a double and deceitful heart; and though
the Master be a continual beholder of the conversation of his servant, and
his eye always on his service, yet he is not every way a competent judge of
his good or ill service, for his servant may do service to his eye, and
pleasing to him, and yet carry in his breast a dissembling heart.

Yea the point is general.

A man may do good duties, so as men cannot except against them, and yet with
a double and hypocritical heart.
A man may do good duties contenting the eye of man, and pleasing to man, and
yet with a double and hypocritical heart.

Our Savior shows it plainly, Matthew. 6. That men may fast, and pray, etc.
and in so doing, please men, and get their applause and commendation, and yet
be hypocrites and do those things not in truth and sincerity of heart, but
in mere hypocrisy and with double hearts; and the reason

Nature can put on the counterfeit and semblance of grace and make that seem to
men a gracious work which is done without any dram of sanctifying grace in
the heart.

This must teach us not to content our selves with the good liking and
approbation of men, We must not not rest in the good liking of men touching
good du^ies done by us, but labor to approve our hearts to the Lord in the
doing of them
no, no, we must gage our own hearts in the doing of good duties, and look
that they be done of us in singleness and sincerity of heart, we may seem to
do many goodly things before men, which men may applaud and highly approve,
and we may be thought petty Angels, and as it were dropped out of heaven, and yet
be impoisoned at our hearts with vain glory, and hypocrisy, and the like;
and therefore think not, thou do good duties as they ought to be done,
unless thine own conscience (being instructed by the word of God) bear thee
witness, thou do them in singleness and sincerity of thine heart, ever look
to that in the doing of good duties; and assure thy self, if thine own
conscience witness against thee in the doing of any good duty, that thou do
it in hpocrisie, or with desire of vain glory, though all the world commend
thee for it, yet the Lord has no delight in thee, and if thine own heart
condemn thee, as John says, 1. Epist. 3.20. God is greater then thine heart,
and much more will he condemn thee; and therefore it concerns thee to look
to thine own heart, and to the sincerity and uprightness of it in the doing
of every good duty.

Mark we further, the Apostle says not only, with eye-seruice, but adds to
it (as men-pleasers.)

Hence a question may be moved (namely) this, Whether it be utterly unlawful
to please men?

Answer: Cor. 10.33. that he pleased all men in all things, not seeking his
own profit, but the profit of many that they might be saved. And Romans 15.2.
it is his precept, Let every man please his neighbor in that which is good to
edification, and therefore it is not simply unlawful to please men.

But that we may understand how it is lawful to please men and how it is not:
How it is lawful to please men, and how it is not.
know we it is not lawful to please men in sin, and in evil things; and
again, its not lawful to please men in good things, resting only in the
pleasing of them, and contenting our selves only in their good liking, but its
lawful to please men in good things, and for their good; so did the Apostle in
the places before cited, and in his precept, he says, Let every man please
his neighbor in that is good to edification; and again, it is lawful to
please men in good things, so as we rest not in the pleasing of them, but aim
also and that chiefly, at the pleasing of God.

The last thing offered unto us in this verse, is from the last words of it,
(fearing God) where the Apostle making the fear of God the root of single
hearted service understand we thus much.

The good and faithful service that servants do to their masters comes from
the fear of God.
that is the root and fountain of it; it was the fear of God that made Jacob
and Joseph so faithful in doing service to their masters.

And indeed, where the fear of God is truly grafted in the heart, it will
cause men to make conscience of every sin, and where that is wanting, as
Abraham concluded, Genesis 20.11. there no conscience is made of the greatest
sin. If thou would be a faithful servant, get Gods fear into thine heart.


Would thou then be an obedient servant, yielding service to thy master in
singleness of thine heart, then endeavor thou to have thine heart seasoned
with Gods grace and fear.

And again for masters, do thou desire a faithful servant, If thou would
have a faithful servant, get one truly fearing God.
David professed he would seek such an one, Psalm. 101.6. Mine eyes shall be
unto the faithful of the Land that they dwell with me, he that walks in a
perfect way he shall serve me; and if thou would have servants that are
under thee true and faithful, then endeavor thou and use all good means to
work the fear of God in their hearts, they are justly plagued with bad
servants, that care not whether their servants be religious, or no, no more
then for their Ox or Horse; so that like one of them they be able and willing
to do their work; its the complaint of men sometimes, such a one is a very
good servant for pains taking, he will work hard, but he is nimble fingred,
he will be pilfring now and then. Now, Note.
here is the cause of it, he wants the fear of God, he is unfaithful to God,
how then can he be faithful to men.

Labor therefore to plant the fear of God in thy servant, and then doubtless
he will do thee true and faithful service; yea, then the blessing of God will
be upon his service, and happily on all thou have for his sake, as it is said,
Genes. 39.45. The Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake;
godliness is gainefull even in servants, and therefore bring thy servant to
the hearing of the word preached, examine him afterward, instruct him, and
give him good example, and by all other good means, draw him to fear God, and
through Gods blessing, that being once wrought in his heart, thou shall have him
a good and faithful servant.

VER. 23. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
man.
The duty of Servants toward their Masters being very hard, and withal no
less needful for servants to perform, the Apostle dwells somewhat longer on
it, then on the duty of any other particular condition of life.

Here therefore in this 23. verse, he still goes on in his exhortation to the
duty of servants, and does further lay before them this general, reaching to
all their actions and businesses done in the service of their masters, that
whatsoever they do therein, they should do it heartily, and then he shows
them the means, how they may come to do so, (namely) by doing it as to the
Lord, and not unto men, as if he had said: I exhort you to do what action or
business soever you do in the service of your masters heartily; and would you
know how you may so do? Here is the way, whatsoever ye perform in the
service of your masters do it as a deed and service to the Lord, and not unto
men.

Interpretation.
(Whatsoever ye do) (that is) what thing, action, work, or business soever
ye do in the service of your masters, for the Apostle here speaks of the
works of servants, as they are servants, and those are the works of their
Masters, and that his meaning is so, the word following makes it clear (...)
work it, so the word properly signifies (heartily) the original word
signifies, from the very soul, the meaning is, do it from the heart with good
will, so does the Apostle expound himself, Ephesians. 6.7. doing the will of God
from the heart (says he) verse 6. and then verse 7. With good will serving
the Lord and not men, so the one does expound the other, (as to the Lord and
not unto men) For the understanding of these words, we must know, that every
Master, as he is a Master, has his authority from God. Romans 13.1. And he
bears the image of God in his authority, and power over his servants; and it
is the will of God, that the Master should be over his servant, and command
him; and that the servant, should be under his Master, and be commanded by
him, and obey him. And so the commandment of the Master (not contrary to the
word of God) carries the stamp of Gods commandment, and the servant in
obaying that, obayes the will of the Lord. These things rightly understood,
will help us to the understanding of these words, (as to the Lord, and not
unto men) and show that they are thus to be conceived; as therein principally
serving the Lord, and not men: or thus, as therein doing service, not simply
and barely to men alone, but in them to the Lord, and therein obaying his will.
The Master as he is a Master, bearing the image of God, and standing in the
Lords stead: his commandment being not contrary to the word of GOD,
bearing the stamp of Gods commandment.

Come we to the matter of instruction, hence offered: and first, here we
see, that servants are further taught.

That they must do all their works, in the service of their masters, from the
heart willingly: Servants must do the works of their Masters, from their
hearts willingly.
whatsoever they do in the service of their Masters, be it great or small,
be it pleasinge, or displeasinge to themselves, they must do it from their
very heart and soul.

Howsoever the servants soul be free, and the Master has not power over it:
Yet the beginning of all good service, from servants to their Masters, is in
the heart, and soul: and from thence it must come, and this is not only
clear from this text, but also from that Ephesians. 6.6. Where the Apostle says
to servants: be obedient to your Masters, not as men-pleasers, but as the
servants of Christ, doing the will of GOD from the heart.

And the reason and ground of this, is that general truth that it is no true
service or obedience either to God or men, that is not willingly performed,
there is a need full work of the heart and soul in every service and duty
done, whether to God or men, and if the duty done, be either forced or done
with a grudging heart, it is no Servants are to examine their hearts in doing
the works of their masters.
and look thou do every work thou art set about by thy master willingly,
and from thy very heart and soul, and lay aside all grudging and repining, too
common a thing with many servants, especially if the work be any whit
laborious and wearisome, then many servants go about it with an ill will, and
with a secret repining in their hearts, and as we use to say, as if they had
neither life nor soul, take thou heed of this, and know that howsoever thy
work so done may bring profit and benefit to thy master, and thou may
think that sufficient, as some stick not to say, have I not done your work,
and what would you have more? yet indeed that is not enough, if so be thou
desire comfort in thy doing of service to thy master, howsoever I say, thy deed
done may bring profit to thy master, yet being done unwillingly, it will never
being comfort to thine own soul, thy work done unwillingly, is no more
pleasing to God then the deed of thy masters horse or ox; And the application
of this may be general, if we do Good duties done unwillingly yield no
comfort to the doer.
or after the manner of laden heavy hearted and drowsy professors, surely,
there is no comfort to be found in the doing of it, for indeed it is not the
doing, but the ready and cheerful doing of Gods will, that pleases him
which we daily pray for; he looks rather to the heart, and to the motion
and affection of the heart in doing any thing then to the thing it self, yet
so as the thing done be agreeable to his will, and a good duty commanded in
his word, if any superstitious thing be done it is not pleasing to him, though
it be done from the very heart and soul, and with the greatest good
intention, and with the greatest devotion that may be, the Lord then regards
not the heart, and motion of it, but in doing of any good duty, he rather
looks to the heart, and to the affection of the doer then to the thing done,
and only that good duty is pleasing to him, which is done heartily, even from
the very heart and soul, 1. Corinthians. 9.17. and therefore take heed thou be
not possessed with a spirit of slumber in doing of any good thing, that is the
character and badge of a carnal and drowsy professor, but labor thou to
have thy heart quickened by grace, that whatsoever good thing thou do either
in the immediate worship of God, or to thy brethren, thou must do it with
alacrity and cheerfulness and from the very heart root, as the Apostle
speaks Phillippians the first and the eighth, for that is only pleasing to God.

The next thing that comes to be considered is this, the Apostle having said to
servants, whatsoever ye do in the service of your masters, do it heartily,
he adds further (as the means whereby they may come to do so, this
consideration, that in doing service to their masters, they do it not barelie
to men alone, but in them to the Lord, their masters (as they are masters)
bearing the image of God, standing in his steed.

Hence servants are taught.

That they must discern the image of God in their masters, Servants must
discern Gods image in their masters that they may serve them willingly and
heartily.
service unto them, they must consider that their masters are in Gods room to
them, and stand in Christ his stead, as his vicegerents in the family, and
they commanding any lawful thing, it is Christ that commands it.

Hence it is that the Apostle does exhort servants Ephesians. 6.5.6. to be obedient
to their masters as unto Christ, and as the servants of Christ, but here
happily some may say, are wicked and ungodly men,

are to be loved and reverenced) but yet as thou art his servant look not so
much at them as at the image of God in his authority and power over thee,
discern thou that and let thine eye be ever upon that, and that no doubt will
be a means to make thee do whatsoever thou do in thy Masters service
heartily and willingly, and from thy very heart and soul, as to the Lord
himself, and not to thy master alone; many servants carry themselves rudely
and irreverently toward their Masters, as if they were their companions rather
then their inferiors, not showing any token of subjection, not standing bare
to their masters, not bowing unto them, nor rising up before them, yea even in
the public assembly many of them stand cheek by cheek with their Masters,
with their hats on their heads, which is vnreuerent behavior in an high degree.

Now here is the cause of it, they discern not the image Reproof of such
servants as discern not Gods image in their masters, and thereupon fail in
their duties toward the^.
they look only at the outward appearance of them, which happily is poor
and mean, indeed if rich Masters, or Masters of great place in the world did
bear the image of God and poor Masters the image of an Angel or some meaner
creature, it were some thing, but thou may know that thy Master be he never
so poor or mean, as he is a Master bears the image of God as well as the
richest master in the world.

Again, many servants happily do that which they are commanded by their
Masters, but if the thing commanded a little cross their humor and displease
them, Note.
they do it vntowardlie, and with very ill will, and what is the cause of
this? whence comes this? surely from hence; they discern not the image of God
in their Master, they consider not their Masters commanding them any lawful
thing, it is the Lord Jesus in them that commands it, would thou go
untowardly, and with ill will about thy business if the Lord Jesus that has
redeemed thy soul from hell (if thou belong to him) and shall one day come
with glory to judge the world, were in thy masters place and stead, and did
command thee to do? Oh no, thou will say, I would be most ready and willing
to do any thing, were it never so hard that he should command me, why then
consider that thy master stands in the room of Christ Jesus, and thy master
commanding any lawful That every one may yield willing subjection and hearty
obedience to his superiors, he must discern Gods image in their authority
and power.
and as they are our governors, do stand in the Lords stead to us. Thus did
David discern in wicked Saul, when he called him the Lords anointed, 1. Sam.
26.9. and this indeed is the ground of all willing and hearty subjection of
any inferior to his superior, then we shall willingly and heartily do
whatsoever lawful thing is enjoined by our superiors, when we have an eye to
the image of God in them, and look on them as standing in Gods stead, and that
the obedience and subjection we yield to them, is yielded not to men alone,
but in them to the Lord: yea, to reach out this a little further there is never
a one of us, but we are bound to do service one to another, in duties of love
and mercy, as occasion is offered.

Note.
Now then consider we, that in doing duties of love and mercy to our brethren,
we do them not to men alone, but in them to the Lord Jesus, so himself says
plainly, Matthew. 25.40. and that will make us do them, heartily and willingly.

What is the pull-backe? what commonly makes men unwilling to do good duties
of love and mercy to their brethren? surely they look only at the outward
habit or quality of the person, and their own flesh teaching them to say within
themselves, what? shall I be serviceable to such a base fellow, to one so
sordide, so mean, and so ill deserving of me? these are the thoughts and
reasonings suggested by the flesh, and that thou may be able to quell and
overcome them, learn thou to look through them, and to epsy under the base
and mean condition of thy brother a more excellent person, and that in doing a
duty of love and mercy to thy brother, thou do it not to him alone, but in
him to the Lord Jesus: If men did duly consider this, that it is the Lord Jesus
to whom they do duties of love and mercy in their brethren, would it not put
spirits into them, and make them do them willingly and cheerefullie? no doubt
it would, and ever will, in all that have any true feeling of the comforts in
Christ.

And therefore ever consider thou to whom the duty of love and mercy, is
principally done, even to the Lord Jesus in thy brother, and that will make
thee do it heartily and from thy very soul, as to the Lord, and not to man
alone.

Note we one thing further the Apostle says to servants: whatsoever ye do
in the service of your masters, do that as to the Lord.

Hence it is clear that the meanest thing a servant does The meanest thing a
servant does in the service of his master is a service done unto the Lord.
a servant in doing the meanest service to his Master serves tht Lord as the
Apostle says plainly in the next verse, for ye serve the Lord Christ: here
is a matter of great comfort for servants employed in mean offices under their
masters, Comfort for servants that are employed in mean offices under their
masters.
art thou employed in thy masters kitchen, as a kitchen boy or maid? do thou
sweep the house, wipe shoes, and then though thy employment and service be
base in the eye of the world, yet it is not base in the sight of God, he
esteems it as good service done to himself, he regards it, and will one day
in mercy reward it, and think on this to thy comfort.

VER. 24. Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
In this verse the Apostle comes to strengthen his exhortation touching the
duty of servants before delivered, and to press servants to the practice of
it by force of argument, and to that purpose he here uses an argument taken
from the rich reward, as it were the wages and hire thereof, which is no less
then the inheritance of eternal life, which true believing servants shall
receive at the hands of the Lord, as if he had said, be encouraged yield
obedience to your masters, and to serve them in singleness of heart, and
whatsoever ye do in their service, do it heartily for of the Lord ye shall
receive the reward of the inheritance, and this argument the Apostle does
further amplify, first, by their own certain knowledge and assurance of it,
that they shall receive such a reward, knowing (says he) that ye shall
receive it. And secondly, by a reason why they are to look for so great
reward at the hands of God; because that in serving their masters, they serve
their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and he takes their service as done to
himself, and therefore he (doubtless) will pay them their reward, and give
them that reward that he has promised to all his faithful servants, and so we
see the general things that are contained in this verse. Interpretation.


(Knowing) that is, not by guess or conjecture, but certainly, Knowing, you
doing your duty being assured of it, your knowledge being grounded on the
promise of God, who is faithful and just to perform it (the reward of the
inheritance) (that is) eternal life and salvation in Gods kindome of glory.

Now that is called both a reward and an inheritance.

First, a reward, both by way of similitude, because it is given as wages is
wont to be given to workmen, and laborers at the end of their labors, when
their work is finished, then commonly they receive their hire and wages; so
when Gods children have finished their course, and passed through the labors
and miseries of this life, they receive eternal life. Whence it is that the
Apostle Peter, 1 Epist. 1.9. says; They receive the end of their faith, even
the salvation of their souls. And in this similitude, and resemblance is
eternal life called a reward, and also, because being promised by God to his
children, it is duly and justly rendered to them upon his promise.

And secondly, eternal life is called an inheritance, because it belonges, and
is, and shall be given to Gods children even to such as are his adopted
children in Christ, who having received the adoption of sons, are the heirs of
God through Christ, as we have it, Gal. 4.7. and as the Apostle says, Romans
8.17. Being children are also heirs, even the heirs of God, and heirs
annexed with Christ, yea joint heirs with Christ the natural Son of God, of
whose body they are members, and so are heirs of salvation, as it is Heb.
1.14. and life eternal is their proper inheritance, and therefore so called in
this, and in many other places of Scripture, (For you serve the Lord Christ)
that is, in serving of your masters, you serve not them alone, but in them the
Lord Christ, your masters standing in his steed, and the Lord Jesus Christ
taks your service as done to himself, thus then we are to conceive the meaning
of the Apostle in the words of this verse, as if he had said.

You Servant do as faithful and hearty service to your Masters, as you would
do to the Lord, certainly knowing and being assured of it, that you (doing
your duty) when you have gone through the labors of this life, of the Lord ye
shall receive eternal life, and salvation in his kingdom of glory, as the
promised reward due to all his faithful servants which is an inheritance that
he will bestow on you as on his adopted children in Christ, for in serving of
your masters, you serve the Lord Jesus Christ, and he takes your service as
done to himself. First, we are here to mark, that the Apostle does encourage
servants to be obedient to their masters, and to serve them in singleness of
heart, doing every thing in the service of them, as to the Lord, by an argument
from the rich reward of their service, that of the Lord they shall receive no
less then the reward of eternal life.

Hence then we may conclude.

Servants may have an eye to the reward of eternal life in doing service to
their masters.
the Apostle setting this place before them, as an encouragement, that they
shall receive the reward of eternal inheritance; they (doubtless) may look
up to it, and have respect to it in doing good service to their masters.

And this is grounded upon that general, that in doing good duties, men of any
calling or condition may lawfully have respect to the recompense of eternal
reward, as it is expressly said that Moses had, Heb. 11.26. And hence it is
that eternal life is proposed and set before us in the Scriptures, as a price,
and as a garland, or crown, 1 Cor. 9.24.25. And being so resembled, men may
have an eye to it in the performance of good duties.

Yet so as they do not good duties only, or principally in respect of that
reward, we are chiefly to respect Gods glory and the discharge of our duty
in doing of good duties, and then secondarily, we may mind and respect the
recompense of eternal life. And therefore thus may servants do, in doing
service to their Masters, in doing of it, they are principally to mind Gods
glory, and the discharge of a good conscience in doing their duty, and yet
therein also may they have an eye to the promised reward of eternal life, and
salvation.

And this being so, servants are (indeed) in doing service to their Masters,
Servants are to have an eye to the great reward of eternal life for their
encouragement in doing service to their Masters.
to have an eye to that great reward of eternal life, laid up and provided for
all those that keep faith and a good conscience in doing the duties that
concern them, they are to look up to that, and ever to fix the eyes of their
minds on it, and that (no doubt) will further and encourage them to do true
and faithful service to their masters; and whatsoever they do in their
service, to do it heartily as to the Lord; servants are oftentimes discouraged
from doing such service as is required at their hands, from the smallness and
slenderness of their wages and reward: and though happily, they receive as much
as was couenanted and agreed upon, betwixt them and their masters, yet because
it is but little or they think it to little, therefore they take liberty to
themselves to neglect their duty, and to do but little, and stick not to say
(as the common saying is) if you will mend my wages, I will mend my pace, or to
say, what if the service I do be not altogether such as it ought to be, yet it
is answerable to the wages I receive, such servants as thus speak, and do,
they show plainly they look only to the hand of man, and no higher, and in
so doing they deal most foolishly; for they looking only to the reward they
receive from men, and doing service (as they think) answerable thereunto, what
do they but even deprive themselves of that rich reward, good and faithful
servants, shall receive at the hands of the Lord, in comparison whereof, all
that servants do, or can receive from man, be it a thousand pound a day, is
not to be esteemed worth a rush, and therefore look not thou to the
slenderness of the wages thou receiuest of thy master, but let thine eye be
ever on the greatness of that reward that is yet behind, no less then a
kingdom, Math. 25.34. and no less then the riches of thy heavenly Master,
verse 21. A reward infinitely surpassing any service thou art able to perform
and that (no douht) will make thee lay aside all reasonings of the flesh, as
that thy wages are but slender, or thy master is a man, either not deserving a
good servant, or without conscience to reward him, and the like, and it will
make thee true and faithful in the service of thy master and to do whatsoever
thou do in his service heartily and cheerfully, because thou look further
then the hand of thy Master, and see a rich and incomparable reward reserved
for thee in a better hand, even in the hand of him who is able, and will also
in his good time bestow it on thee, ever look thou up to that rich reward that
is laid up in heaven for all good and faithful servants: and consider thou
that the Lord of his mercy will crown thy poor service done to thy master
with no less then a kingdom, and with the ioies of his own everlasting
kingdom; and without question, the consideration of that, will cause thee to
pass through all difficulties suggested by thine own flesh, and will encourage
thee to serve thy master in singleness of heart doing whatsoever thou do in
his service heartily and cheerfully.

In the next place we are to mark the Apostles first amplification of his
argument in the words of this verse? (Knowing) He says not barely, for of
the Lord, he shall receive the reward of the inheritance, but knowing it, you
believing servants doing your duty as you ought in your place and calling,
being thereby assured of it, that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of
the inheritance.

Hence we may raise this conclusion.

That doing of the duty that ought to be done in any Faithful and conscionable
doing of duties that ought to be done does assure believers of eternal life.


The Apostle here says to believing servants, be obedient to your masters, do
you your duty as you ought, certainly knowing that so doing, ye shall receive
the reward of the inheritance of the Lord.

Hereupon we may gather.

That by faithful and conscionable doing of that duty that ought to be done
in any particular place or calling, true believers may certainly know, and be
assured that of the Lord they shall receive the reward of eternal life, and
this does the Apostle further show in his own example most plainly, 2 Timothy 4.
where he says to Timothy verse. 5. Do the work of an Evangelist, make thy
ministry fully known, then he adds verse. 6. for I am now ready to be
offered, and the time of my departing is at hand; as if he had said, do thou
Timothy that which becomes thee in thy place and calling, faithfully and with
conscience, for I have so done in my place and calling; I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith, and done my duty faithfully and conscionably,
and stood against all opposition to the contrary, and now I am ready to be
offered and to depart this life: and then mark what he is bold hereupon to
infer and to affirm, verse 8. Henceforth (says he) is laid up for me the
crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at
that day, as if he had said, I have finished my course and done my duty in my
place and calling, and hereby I know, and am assured, that hence forth is
laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

A plain proof of this.



And the reason and ground of this is. Because true believers are not only
assured by the infallible testimony of the Spirit of God after an unspeakable
manner bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God,
Romans 8.16. and so as children, have right to the eternal inheritance in
heaven, but they are also assured of it by the fruits of the Spirit, 1. John
3.14. We know we are translated from death unto life, because we love the
brethren. Love of the brethren, a fruit of the Spirit, gives assurance of
translation from death to life, that men are set out of the state of nature
which is deadly, and are now in the state of grace.

Now love to our brethren shows it self and is manifested in doing good to
them, as in the general calling, as we are Christians so in our particular
place and calling, in family, Church or Commonwealth, when we in that
particular place and calling, do the best good we can to our brethren, we
manifest our true love to them, which is a fruit of the spirit; and therefore,
hereupon it must needs follow that by faithful and conscionable doing of the
duty that concerns true believers in their particular place and calling, by
doing it in singleness of heart, in obedience to the Commandment of God, with
a sincere respect to Gods glory, and the good of their brethren, they may come
to certain knowledge, and assurance, that of the Lord they shall receive the
reward of eternal life,

Confutation of that Popish doctrine that men in this life can only have a
good hope and no certain assurance of their salvation.
First, it meets with that desperate and devilish doctrine of the Papists, who
teach their followers ever to stand in doubt of their salvation, and tell them
they can never come to any certain knowledge and assurance, but at the best,
may only have a good hope of it, whereas indeed a good and sound hope such as
the Apostle speaks of Romans 5.5. that makes not ashamed ever comes from faith,
and faith is a certain persuasion resting on the free grace and promise of
God, and so they confound themselves in their own speech: but being pressed
with this and the like places (knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the
reward of inheritance, and we know we are translated from death unto life
because we love the brethren.

What is their answer forsooth (knowing) here and in such like places say
they signifies a knowledge by sign and by conjecture and not a certain
knowledge, A Popish cavil confuted.
which is a mere shift, for the word is the same with that 1. John 5.20.
Where John says, we know that the son of God is come. Now (I hope) they
will not say that our knowledge of Christ his incarnation, and coming in the
flesh, is a knowledge by guess and by conjecture, but a certain knowledge,
they will say they know and believe it certainly. Now the original word
there, is the same with this here, and therefore as well in this, as in that
place, it signifies a certain knowledge.

Oh but says the Papist we cannot have certain knowledge that the reward of
eternal life belongs to us by doing the good duties the Lord requires of us
because we may perhaps not have done them so well as we ought,

Indeed if our knowledge and assurance of the reward of eternal life were
built on the perfection of good duties done by us, of their brethren, are
thereby assured that the promised reward belongs to them, their assurance not
resting on the dignity or perfection of their works, but on Gods free and
gracious promise, who has freely promised in Christ to reward the poor
endeauours, and service of his children, with the reward of eternal life; and
therefore this still remains a truth, that true believers by faithful and
conscionable doing the duties that concern them in their particular place and
calling, may come to certain knowledge, that the reward of eternal life
belongs to them.

A ground of comfort and encouragement to true believers to do good duties.
its not a doctrine of presumption as the Papists taxt it, but of great comfort
and encouragement, even to hearten us to the doing of every good duty, indeed
if it were uncertain, happily we might obtain the crown, and happily miss
of it, we should have no heart to seek after it; but now since it is so that
we believing in Christ, and doing good duties faithfully, and with conscience,
may thereby come to a certain knowledge, that we shall obtain it: it is a
notable comfort and encouragement to us, and let all servants therefore (to
them is the encouragement here particularly intended) let them (I say, and all
others of what calling or condition soever they be, consider how they wrong
themselves in the neglect or careless doing of good duties that concern them,
they thereby deprive themselves of sweet comfort. Art thou a true believer? and
do thou persuade thy self that thou do truly believe in Christ, do then
the duties that concern thee in thy place and calling faithfully, and with a
good conscience, and thou shall thereby make known unto thy self and others,
that thy faith is no fancy, and seal up to thy soul a sweet comfort that the
promised reward of eternal life belongs to thee, thou shall not serve God in
vain, as the wicked think and speak, Malac the 3. and 14. true believers
serve not the Lord for naught, no, no, of the Lord they shall receive a rich
reward, as the wicked heaping sin upon sin, treasure up wrath upon
wrath, Romans the second and the fifth, so true believers doing one good duty
after another, lay up treasures for themselves in Heaven, Matthew the sixth
and the twentieth, even one degree of glory upon another: and therefore let
us be stirred up with faithfulness, and good conscience, to do the duties
that concern us in our particular places and callings as the Apostle exhorts,
1. Cor. 15.58.
be abundant always in doing holy and good duties, forasmuch as we know
certainly that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.

The next thing that comes to be considered in this verse is this, the Apostle
calls eternal life the reward of inheritance, he says, that true believing
servants, shall of the Lord, receive the reward of the inheritance, and
therein he teaches two things, I will speak of them in order.

The first is this.

That howsoever true believing servants be men's bondmen, yet are they the
Lords freemen, and howsoever they do service to men, yet they are
notwithstanding the children of God, and the Lord does account them not as
servants, but as children, Though true believing servants be men's bondmen, yet
they are the Lords free men, and the Lord accounts them as children.
for inheritance (as we know) belongs, and is given to children, and not to
servants, and that this is a truth, besides this text we have evidence for it
in many other places, 1. Cor. 7.22. the Apostle applying his speech to the
comfort of servants and bondmen, tells them that though they continue servants
yet being in Christ, their case is good, for he that is called in the Lord,
being a servant, is the Lords freeman. 1. Cor. 12.13. the Apostle says, by
one Spirit all believers are baptized into one body, they are members of the
same mystical body of Christ, whether bond or free, and so the adopted sons and
daughters of God, the reason of this is plain (namely) this.

True believing servants (as they are believers) differ not from other
believers, but are all one with them in Christ, as the Apostle says,
Galathians the third and the twenty eight, there is neither bond nor free, but
all are one in him, in him they are equal with others in respect of
justification in the sight of God, in respect of adoption to be the children
of God, and in that respect their particular outward difference, as that they
are servants, is not regarded, as either any help or hinderance unto them, as
they are believers, as they are in Christ, they are Abraham's seed, and heirs
by promise, Galathians the third and the twenty nine, they are the children of
God, and heirs of all the blessings of God in this life, and in the life to
come.

And therefore true believing servants (though they be servants to men) yet for
all that they are the children of God, and the Lord does so esteem them, as
his adopted sons and daughters in Christ.

Let all true believing servants lay up this truth in their hearts, Comfort
for true believing servants against the consideration of their hard and base
condition.
be somewhat discouraged, and their minds may be something cast down in
them, when they look on their outward estate (and as flesh and blood esteems
it) their hard condition in the world, as that they are not as many others
are, sui iuris, they are not their own men, but are in subjection under
others, and at the beck, at the call and command of others, and their
condition is servile and base.

But what do thou troubling and vexing thy self with the consideration of
thy mean condition amongst men? art thou a true believer? do thou truly
believe in Jesus Christ? then set thy thoughts on that honor thou art called
unto, thou art then the adopted son or daughter of God, fellow heir with
the son of the Lord, and king of heaven; and thou have right to all the
comfortes, of his children in this life: and to his everlasting inheritance, in
his kingdom of glory. And though thou be but a servant to men, yet even
thy servitude, is sweetened unto thee, and thou art more then a servant to the
LORD: thou art his son through Christ: and therefore think on it to thy
comfort.

Indeed, if thou that art a servant, be not a true believer, but as yet in
thy natural condition; thou art then in a miserable servitude: thou art then
not only a servant to man, but a servant to sin, a slave to the Devil, and
thy servitude is accursed to thee: and therefore hasten (as much as thou can)
out of that fearful servitude, and never rest, till thou be sure thou do
truly believe in Christ; and once truly believing in him, it is not thy
outward condition (be it never so base) that can hinder thee from being the
son of God. Thou art then his adopted child, in, and through Christ: and
then thou art within compass, of his special love and favor, and have right
to all the comfortes of his children, both in this life, and in the life to
come.

Now, the second thing the Apostle teaches

That eternal life, though it be a reward, yet it is not a reward given of
merit, but of mercy: Eternal life being a reward: is a reward, not of
merit, but of mercy.
it is a reward freely given, and not deserved, being a matter of inheritance.

For we know, an inheritance is freely given by the father, to the child,
and not deserved by any merit of welldoinge: it is given by the father to the
child, of the mere love of the father; and it may be it was provided for him,
before he was borne, or before he could do any thing for it: and so our
Savior speaks playnelie of the heavenly inheritance. Matthewe 25.34. In
herite the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundations of the world. And
every man that knows any thing, knows thus much, that an earthly
inheritance, amongst men, is not given to the servant, who (happily) has done
something, and helped his master, in gettinge, or keeping of it. But it is
given to the child, who (it may be) is so far from doing any thing, to
the purchasinge of it, as that yet he is an infant, and a suckling.

And so eternal life being called, the reward of inheritance; we are
thereby given to understand, that it is given to GODS children, not on any
desert of theirs: but freely. Romans. 6.23. It is worth our markinge, that the
Apostle having said, the wages of sin, is death. He goes not on (as the
Rhemists themselves on that place confess) as the sequel of the speech
required. He says not on the contrary, the wages or reward of holiness, is
eternal life: but he changes his terms, and says; but eternal life, is
the gift of GOD. A plain proof, that eternal life, is not given on merit,
or desert: but freely of the free grace of GOD: it is the free gift of GOD.

And the reason of this, is not only want of proportion,

But, because the LORD alone will have all the glory, of the salvation of his
chosen: he will not have man to have any part of that glory.

And therefore the Apostle says: Ephesians. 2.9. By grace ye are saved
through faith, not of works, least any man should boast himself, least any
should glory, that he bringes any thing to the procurement, of his own
salvation. We see then the point is proved.

That eternal life, though it be a reward, yet it is not a reward, of
merit, but of mercy: a reward freely given, not deserved by any thing done
by us.

First, this serves to confute and overthrow the opinion Confutation of the
opinion of the Papists touching the merit of works.
who teach that eternal life is properly the reward of good works, and given
to them that are first justified by Christ not gratis and freely but as wages
due to their good works, on their desert, and for the merit of them, yea, that
God has set forth heaven to sale, for our works, we find these very words
in their writings yea, some of them write thus, that a supernatural work,
proceeding from grace within it self, and of it own nature has a proportion,
and condignitie with the reward, and sufficient value to be worth the same, a
doctrine most wicked, and full of derogation from Gods glory, and besides the
error in the foundation of it, supposing a double justification in the sight
of God, which they are never able to prove by the word of God, it cannot
stand with the doctrine now delivered, and proved out of the word of God, for
if eternal life be a reward freely given, then not on the desert and
dignity, of any thing done by us, free gift and due deserved debt cannot stand
together.

Oh but says the Papist,

I answer them.

The original word here used, and the Latin and for the worth and dignity
of it? nothing less, they are never able thence to euince it, thar is but a
loose and disioynted conclusion.







And this being so, that eternal life is a reward of inheritance freely given
to Gods children.

We must look that we make title to it, noe other We must make title to life
eternal, only as we are Gods adopted children in Christ.
Say not thou (as commonly blind, and ignorant people use to say) I know I
must love GOD above all, and my neighbor as my self: and if I do my good
will, so to do; God will be merciful to me, and I shall go to heaven:
that is to lay claim to heaven as a servant, not as a son: thou must say,
when thou have done all things commanded thee, thou art an unprofitable
servant. Luke 17.10. Yea, says the Papist, (here he puts in his absurd
gloss) say so for humillities sake; though indeed we are not unprofitable:
a poor shift and a sottish.

We are taught to say for humillities sake indeed, A popish cavil answered.
that we are unprofitable servants, but not against the truth. Does our
Savior teach us to say, that which is not true, for humillities sake? when he
bids us say, we are unprofitable servants. Noe, (without question) he does
not; we are to say so, and in so saying, we speak the truth. We deserve
noe good thing, by our best works, at the hands of God: we are ever to
renounce all merrite of our own works, and to challenge, or lay claim to
heaven, only, as we are children of God, adopted in Christ, by whose merit
we are justified; and by whose spirit we are sanctified. And yet, we are not
heervpon to cast off all care, of doing good works: though we are to
disclaim, all merit of good works; yet we are not to lay a side, the care
of doing of them. Noe, we are to express our thankefullnesse to God, for his
mercy, by all holy obedience.

If we are to be thankful to GOD, for every bitte of bread, we put into
our mouths (as it is our duty) because it is the free gift of GOD: and the
use and comfort we find in it, comes from the blessing of God, then much more
are we to be thankful to GOD, for making us, that were by nature children
of the Devil, his own children by adoption, yea sons ane heirs, even joint
heirs with Christ his natural son, of that everlasting inheritance in his
own Kingdom of glory.

And therefore think not that now, because we may not lay claim to life
eternal, for the merit of our own good works, therefore we may neglect
them, no, no, if thou be a child of God, the spirit of God will be powerful
in thee to another purpose, then the consideration of thy title by grace to the
inheritance in heaven, will make thee say as David did, 2. Samuel the second
and the eighteeenth, Lord who am I that thou should think of me, and
choose me, and make me thy child by adoption, and give me title to thy
heavenly Kingdom, what shall I render unto thee for this thine unspeakable
mercy toward me, and thou will then studdy to show thy self thankful to
God for his mercy in all holy obedience in doing all good duties that
concern thee, and therefore deceive not thy self, if thou feel not this
working in thy self, thou have not the spirit of God, and if thou have not his
spirit thou art none of his and if thou be not his child, thou have noe right
nor title to his heavenly inheritance, for only as we are sons and
daughters of God in Christ Jesus, have we right to the reward of everlasting
inheritance.

The second amplification of the argument is in the last words (for ye serve
the Lord Christ) this is a reason why servants are to look for the reward of
inheritance, because that in serving their Masters, they do serve the Lord,
yea, he takes their service as done to himself.

Here is then comfort and assurance to all true believing servants doing
their duty to their Masters Comfort for true believing servants doing their
duty to their masters.
that they shall receive the reward of inheritance at the hands of the Lord
for they serve him, and it is just and equal, that he to whom the service is
performed, should pay them their wages, and this the Lord will never deny, his
word is past from him, his promise is out, and therefore doubt not of it, if
thou believe in Christ, and do thy duty to thy Master, the Lord will
certainly return thy good service into thy bosom, with his blessing in this
life, and will also give thee the reward of eternal inheritance in the life to
come, think on it to thy comfort.

VER. 25. But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong that he has
done, and there is no respect of persons.
In this Verse, the Apostle brings a second argument to strengthen and enforce
his exhortation touching the duty of Servants, and he does hearten and
encourage them to do their duty, and to go on in the doing of it, by an
argument of comfort against the injuries and wrongs done to them, form a
general sentence; That wrongs done shall one day be redressed, and that the
wrong doer shall receive for the wrong he has done; the LORD will one day
repay it with deserved punishment.

In which argument he preuents a secret objection.

For happily Servants (especially in the days of the Apostle, when they were
bought, and sold, and hardly used) might say unto him; you tell us that we
believing in Chirst and doing our duty to our Masters, there is a rich reward
abiding for us, and that of the Lord we shall receive the reward of
inheritance.

But alas our present condition is intolerable, we are hardly entreated, and
we sustain great wrong and injury, this the Apostle meets withal in this
argument, and tells them to their comfort, that one day their wrongs shall be
righted, and there will come a time when the Lord will punish the wrong doer,
and give him his just desert.

And this argument is further amplified by the property of the Lord in giving
judgment (namely) this, that he is a righteous and impartial judge, not
respecting any man's person; in the last words, and there is no respect of
persons.

And so the sum and substance of this verse is a general ground of comfort
to all that are oppressed, and suffer wrong, here particularly applied to
servants, suffering wrong at the hands of their Masters, that one day the Lord
will take their cause into his hand, and give the wrong doer his just deserved
punishment, and that without partiallitie.

Come we to the words as they are laid down by the Apostle.

And first of the argument.

Interpretation.
(But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong that he has done) That
is, he that deals unjustly with another (for the word properly signifies)
He that does hurt, or harm another, or others; and the Apostle puts these two
together, 1 Cor. 6.8. Ye your selves do wrong, and do harm, and that to
your brethren; and so the meaning is, he that does hurt, or harm another, or
others, in person, goods, or good name: (shall receive) meaning from the Lord,
or from the hand of the Lord. (For the worng that he has done) the words are
(the wrong he has done) it is a Metonimicall speech, putting down the
efficient cause for the effect, the meaning is, just punishment for the wrong
done.

Thus then briefly conceive we these words, as if the Apostle had said.

But he that does hurt or harm another in person goods, or good name, shall
receive from the hand of the Lord, just punishment for the same. Now here in
the first place mark we the argument the Apostle uses, having in the verse
before encouraged true believing servants to do their duty to their masters
by an argument from the rich reward they shall receive: here he adds further
encouragement and comfort unto them by an argument from the punishment of such
as wrong them, that such as wrong them shall receive from the Lord just
punishment.

In the first place he comforts them from the rich grace and mercy of the
Lord in rewarding their welldoing.

In the second, from his justice in punishing wrong-doers.

Here then note we.

That to true believing Servants, and indeed, to all true Both Gods mercy and
justice are comfortable to true believers doing their duties in their places
and callings.
both Gods mercy and also his justice are comfortable; It is a comfort to Gods
children keeping faith, and a good conscience, to consider, that the Lord is
both a gracious, a free, and a liberal rewarder of well-doers, and that he is
also a just auenger and punisher of wrong-doers; Gods children many times find
sweetness in the consideration of the justice of God, I say, many times, not
always, yea in the remembrance of his wrath, and judgments against evil
doers. David speaks plainly to this purpose, Psalm. 119.52. I remember thy
judgments of old, O Lord, and have been comforted: He was staid up and
comforted in time of his oppression and trouble, by considering the Lords
justice manifested in executing judgment against the wicked; and thus it is
with all Gods children, they with comfort many times consider and remember the
justice of God and his wrath and judgment on evil doers, and the reason is
this.



Difference between Gods children and the wicked when they think upon Gods
justice.
and that he is a just judge, and punisher of evil doers; no, no, they put the
justice and judgments of God as far out of their minds as possibly they can,
and they frame to themselves a God all of mercy, and indeed an idol God; and
hereby try thy self, if thou find that it is even dreadful to thee to
think of Gods justice and wrath, and that he is a punisher of evil doers, and
thou do labor to stifle all thought and consideration of that, and thou art
ever harping on his mercy, and do frame to thy self a God all of mercy, and
could wish that God were made all of mercy, it is a foul argument thy heart
is not right within thee, and therefore remember and think on this, that Gods
children many times find comfort even in the consideration of the justice of
God, and that he is a just punisher of evil doers, and never rest till thou
also, at sometime or other find comfort therein, yea that thou can with
comfort think on the just judgment that shall be given by the judge of all
the world at his coming, and can even wish and pray for that day, and with
comfort cry out, as it is Reuelat. 22.20. come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

Consider we in the next place the matter of the Apostles argument, he says,
He that does wrong shall receive for the wrong that he has done at the hand
of God, just punishment.

Here then we see it plainly laid before us.

That the Lord will certainly punish wrong doers, The Lord will certainly
punish wrong-doers.
such as wrong their brethren, and any way oppress them, shall not escape the
punishing hand of GOD, the LORD will not suffer them that wrong their brethren
(except they repent) to go unpunished, but they shall certainly receive just
punishment from his hand.

We find Deuter. 32.35. the Lord says, vengeance, and recompense of wrong
from him, is so certain, as it is laid up in store with him and sealed up
among his treasures, Proverb. 22.22.23. says Solomon, Rob not the poor
because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in judgment. For the Lord
will defend their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoil them. Pro.
23.10. Remove not the ancient bounds, and enter not into the f^eld of the
Fatherless. Verse. 11. For he that redeemed them is mighty: he will defend
their cause against thee. 1 Thessal. 4.6. The Apostle exhorts, that no man
oppress, or defraude his brother in any matter, and he gives this reason, for
the Lord is the auenger of all such things.

And indeed, the reason

Let this then strike a terror into the hearts of all Terror to all wrong-doers.
even into the hearts of all that any way wrong their brethren, of which sort
there be many in the world.

Do not many of our hearts tell us we are guilty of doing wrong to our
brethren?

No doubt the conscience of most men can tell them, they have done wrong to
their brethren, on way or other, either in their persons by hard usage, or in
their goods by violence, or fraud, or in their good names, by backbiting, and
slandering, and the like, and it may be more ways then one; well, consider
thou, that for the wrong thou have done, or do, to thy brethren, there is
punishment and vengeance laid up in the hands of the Lord for thee, and it is
laid up in a sure hand, even in the hand of him, who will be sure to find thee
out, and unless thou in time do truly humble thy self, and repent, will be
sure to pour it down upon thee, and thou shall not escape it; and think not,
because (happily) thou art a man of place, and power, and thy poor underling
oppressed and wronged by thee, dare not complain, or open his mouth to men
against thee, therefore thy ease is good enough: no, no, howsoever the poor
worm trodden upon, dare not open his mouth, yet the sin it self opens a wide
mouth against thee, it cries loud, and makes a loud cry in the ear of the
Lord, Isai. 5.7. I looked for judgment, but behold oppression, for
righteousness, and behold a crying.

Oppression and wrong-doing is a crying sin, and it will never rest till it
bring down judgments, sometimes it brings down visible judgments in this
life, though not always, 2 Pet. 2 9. The Lord reserues the unjust unto the day
of judgment to be punished; Yea, though the Lord regard not the persons, or
prayers of wicked men oppressed, and injuriously dealt withal, yet he many
times, regards their cause, and he hears their oppression and wrong crying to
him, and will punish the wrong-doer. Yea, know we yet further, that though
wrong done by thee, be forgiven by the party, and he prays for thee as
Stephen did, Act. 7 60. Lord lay not this sin to their charge, yet till thou
thy self be truly humbled and repent of thy sin, thou stand liable to
punishment, the Lords justice will not suffer wrong to escape unrevenged:
think on this thou that art guilty of wrong doing heretofore, and let every
one of us ever hereafter take heed of so foul a sin.

Again, is it so that the Lord will punish wrong doers, Comfort for such as
are wronged and can find no relief n^r remedy at the hands of men
they must remember that howsoever men regard them not, nor have any care to
see their wrongs righted, yet the Lord that sees all things, he sees them, and
he regards them, and he will one day revenge them.

Art thou a child of God that art wronged? Note.
here is then double comfort for thee, thy well-doing shall receive reward,
and thy suffering wrongs shall find a revenge, and therefore thou above al
other, possess thy soul in patience, commit thy cause to him that judges
justly, and take heed thou never go about to avenge thy self, it is the
Apostles exhortation, Romans 12.19. Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves, but
give place unto wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine I will repay, says
the Lord: and it is built on this very ground, Vengeance is mine, and I will
repay, if thou seek to avenge thy self, thou incroachest on the Lords right,
and then thou wrongest thy self, and prouokest the Lord to displeasure against
thy self.

May I not seek remedy and redress of my wrongs at the hands of the
Magistrate, and at the hands of such as are set in place to right wrongs?

Yes: (doubtless) thou may for great wrongs, the revenge of it to him, and
he (doubtless) will give the wrong-doer (if he continue in his sin) his
just deserved punishment, be he never so great, or mighty, a sweet comfort
for all poor worms oppressed by the mighty men of the world.

Art thou a servant (for to thee did the Apostle chiefly intend this comfort)
and art thou wronged by an heard dealing master? Remember thou, God sees thy
wrong, and he will one day avenge thy wrong, if thou commit it to him in godly
patience, indeed if thou take on thee to avenge thy wrong thy self, thou do
then loose the benefit of Gods regard, and thou shall surely taste of his rod
for so offending. But if thou in patience possess thy soul, and commend thy
cause to him, certainly the Lord will one day set thee at liberty, avenge thy
cause, and render vengeance into the bosom of those that wrong thee.

Come we to the amplification of the Apostles argument in the last word of the
verse, (And there is no respect of persons.) Wherein he sets down the
property of the Lord in giving judgment, that he is a just and most
impartial judge, and that with the Lord there is no respect of persons, for so
the sentence is to be supplied, as we have it expressly set down, Romans
2.11. Ephesians. 6.9. and in many other places.

Interpretation.
(And there is no respect of persons.) The words properly signify no respect
of face, or of outward appearance, for the original word ((...)) signifies the
face, or outward show, we find it so rendered, 2 Cor. 5.12. Which rejoice in
the face and not in the heart; and so by the word (person) we are to understand
the outward quality, or the outward state, and condition of man, even that in
man which is conspicuous, and to be discerned by others, which does commonly
make him more, or less esteemed amongst men as country, sex, state of life,
as that he is a Father, a Master, a Servant, etc. riches, poverty, wisdom,
learning etc. and not to respect the person in judgment, is not to be moved,
or carried through any partial affection toward any, or from any, in regard
of his outward quality and condition, either to spare any, because of his
dignity and preserment above others in the world, or to pity another because
of his inferioritie and low estate amongst men, but to give just judgment
according to the cause and works of every one: thus then conceive we the
meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had spoken more largely thus.

And in giving of judgment there is no regard with the Lord of the outward
quality or state of any man, he will not spare any in respect of his outward
dignity and state in the world, neither will he pity any in regard of his
mean quality and condition amongst men, but he will judge every one, high or
low, rich or poor, uprightly according to his works.. First, here we see
plainly laid before us, the absolute righteousness of the Lord in giving
judgment, that he will give just judgment to every one, not regarding the
outward appearance or condition of the person whatsoever, to pervert judgment.

And hence it is, that the Apostle calls the last judgment, God will give just
judgment to every one, not regarding the outward condition of the person.
Romans 2.5. and then he goes on further to show the justice of God in giving
judgment, that he will reward every man according to his works (that is) to
them which by continuance in well doing, seek glory, and honor, and
immortallitie, eternal life, etc. and he gives this self same reason of it,
verse. 11. for there is no respect of persons with God, and this uprightness in
giving judgment

Without partiallitie, is signified by the white Throne, spoken of Revel.
20.11. For the white color in scripture, is used to represent purity, and
glory: and in that place, it signifies, that the Judge, shall give most just,
and vncorrupt judgment, and free from all spotte of partiallitie.

And the reason of this is manifest (namely) this, the most holy, and glorious
majesty of God, is free from all sinister,

But against this, happily, some may object, and say. We read Matthewe 11.22.
our Savior says, it shall be easier for Tyrus and Sydon, at the day of
judgment, then for them of Corazin and Bethsaida. And again, for the land of
Sodom, then for Capernaum, at the day of judgment: verse. 24. and he gives
this reason of it. Because many great works were done, in those places: their
outward condition was better, in regard of their outward means of
repentance. Capernaum, was lift up to heaven, in regard of the preaching of
Christ, and his workinge of miracles there. And again, Luke. 12.47.48. he
says, the servant that knew his Masters will, and prepared not himself,
neither did according to his will, shallbe beaten with many stripes: but he
that knew it not, and yet did commit things worthy of stripes, shallbee
beaten with few stripes. Where we see (may some say) judgment shall be given
according as men doing things worthy stripes are quallified, either with
knowledge or ignorance, and therefore it may seem, that the Lord at the day of
judgment will respect persons, and regard the outward quality and condition of
men.

For answer to this,

But what then, is the Lord an accepter of persons in judgment? nothing less,
for to accept persons in judgment, is through a corrupt and partial affection,
in respect of the person, to pervert judgment, and to give wrong and unjust
judgment.

Now the LORD is far from this, What it is to accept persons in judgment.
in giving and awarding greater or less punishment, as the sin is greater or
less, not only in the kind or nature of the sin it self, but in regard
of the quality or condition of the sinner.

Therein the Lord deals most justly, and is far from all touch of
partiality, he is not moved by the quality or condition of the person to
spare or pity any unjustly, but he will give just and proportionable
judgment and punishment to every one, living and dying in sin, according as
his sin shall be, even greater or less, and yet ever just in regard of his
quality and condition, and so it still remains a truth, that the Lord will
give just judgment to every one, and not accept any man's person in regard of
his outward quality and condition to pervert judgment.

We must take heed we rest not upon any outward condition, as able to stand us
in stead in the day of judgment.
yea, or as a means to move the LORD to spare us, or to pity us, and not to
award just sentence and judgment against us for our sins.





But yet I must tell you there be two sorts of people that (notwithstanding
this confession) presume the Lord will deal favorably with the^ in respect of
outward things the one sort are carnal professors, and the other are ignorant
persons, for the first of these, do not many persons think that because they
are borne and brought up in the bosom of the Church, they have been baptized
and made partakers of the holy ordinances of God* therefore the Lord will be
merciful unto them, and not give sentence of condemnation against them, they
shall never come into the judgment of condemnation, though their hearts and
lives abound with foul sins.

And again:

Do not many ignorant persons think that the Lord will hold them excused, and
not deal with them according to their sins in respect of their ignorance?
even because they are ignorant, therefore the Lord will hold them excused?
indeed ignorance that is not voluntary, shall excuse not altogether from
sin, but from so great sin, but ignorance wilful and affected, such as is
the ignorance of them who live under the means of knowledge, does rather
aggrauate and increase sin, then any thing mitigate or lessen it.

And therefore deceive not thy self, and let every one take heed how he
presumes that the Lord will be favorable to him, and hold him excused,
because he has the outward calling of a Christian, or because he is
ignorant, remember this, that the Lord is no accepter of persons, he in giving
judgment will not spare, nor pity thee in respect of thy outward quality or
condition, no, no, that shall then stand thee in no stead, unless it be to
heap up judgment upon thee, and never rest thou, till thou be sure that thou
art a lively member of Jesus Christ, in him alone thou shall be accepted, and
be able to stand Comfort for poor souls oppressed by great men in the world.
at his coming to judgment.

Again is it so, that the Lord at the day of judgment, will give just
judgment, not accepting any man's person whatsoever, nor regarding the outwa^d
state of any man, hee^e is then further comfort for poor souls oppressed by
great men in the world, the Lord will not only one day punish their
oppressors (unless they repent for their oppression and wrong, but he will
do it without all partiality, and without all respect of persons, their
greatness shall not stand them in stead to bear off the stroke of the Lords
punishing hand; no, no, they shall appear before the Lord as naked and void of
all greatness, as the poorest man in the world; let all that suffer wrong and
hard measure at the hands of great ones, think on that to their comfort.

Such as bear Gods image in any place of authority, are to b^ like the Lord in
^udging without respect of persons.
as the Prophet says, Isai. 28.17. they must lay judgment to the rule, and
righteousness to the balance, they must hea^e causes indifferently, and
determine them equally, examining them (as it were) by line and square (as the
Mason or Carpenter does his work) they must beware of favoring the great ones
for their greatness, which is to decline on the left hand, and of pitying, and
in pity favoring the part of the poor, and meaner sort, in respect of their
low degree, and howsoever that may be thought a virtue, even by men wise and
well minded, yet that it is a fault and sin, the text is plain Exodus 23.3,
Leuit. 19.15. we there find it expresselie forbidden, to respect the poor
man in his cause or question of strife, and thus far may this concern us,
we are called sometimes to vmpire and judge of matters of difference between
parties, and therein we must take heed we be not corruptly carried with any
partial affection in respect of the quality of any party to judge amiss.

respect of persons, yea, every one of us are to be guided by this rule in
judging of sin, We are to judge of sin without respect of persons, and
therein many are faulty.
it is the fault of the most to judge that to be sin in some, which they
deem not so in others; for example, many will judge and condemn that as
covetousness, or pride, or garishnesse, setting out the lightness and vanity
of their mind in strangers, which they will not so judge and so condemn, if
it be found in their own near friends, as in wife, child, father, mother,
kinsmen, and such like, as though diversity of subject could make the self
same thing a sin in some, and not in other some, and yet thus it is with many
in the world; and what is this, but as James says chap. 2.4. to be partial
in our selves and judges of evil thoughts, that is, judges ill affected,
carrying in us, perverse and crooked thoughts, and judging in respect of
persons; thou must judge sin to be sin, and condemn it though it be
never so nearly resident and found in thy dearest friends, and if thou do not
so, Note.
surely thou have neither a true dislike and hatred of sin, nor a true love
of thy friends, for a true dislike of sin will make thee dislike it
wheresoever it is found, and he loves his friend truly, that has learned to
love him or her spiritually, and cannot abide sin in the party loved without
some seasonable admonition and reproof.

And therefore, if we would not show it, that we have no true dislike of
sin, even because it is sin, and displeasing to God, nor any true love of
our friends (which we would be loath that any should think of us.)

Let us learn to judge and condemn sin in whomsoever it is found, without
respect of persons, yea, judge and condemn a sin to be as great a sin in
thy nearest friend, as in any other whosoever, and that will seal up
sweet comfort to thy soul, that thou have thee spiritte of God in thee,
transforming thee, into the image of God, and as that thou art like the Lord in
this world, so thou shall be like to the image of his son Jesus Christ, in
the world to come. Amen.

VERITAS FILIA TEMPORIS


THE FOVRTH CHAPTER.
VERSE I. Ye Masters, do unto your Servants that which is just and equal,
knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.


IN this first verse of this Chapter, the Apostle does still continue his
exhortation, begun verse the 18. of the foregoing Chapter, containing
special dut^es of Christians, as they stand in relation one to another, in
some particular state and condition of life, and having before propounded, and
urged the duty of Servants toward their Masters.

Here he sets down on the other side, the duty of Masters toward their
Servants; and he tells Masters, here be two things required of them toward
their servants; as (namely) that they do to their servants.

That which is just. And
That which is equal.
And these two things, the Apostle does urge on Masters by way of exhortation,
generally propounded in these words (Ye Masters do to your Servants that
which is equal.) And then he strengthens this exhortation, and moves masters
to the doing of these two things, by force of argument, and that taken from
their subjection to an higher Lord and Master.

That they are not absolute Masters, and subject to none, but that they also
have a Master above them, to whose censure they are subject, and to whom they
must one day yield an account (as of all their doings) so of their dealings
with their Servants. And this argument the Apostle does amplify.

First, by their own knowledge, (or at least, they ought to know, and consider
it) Knowing (says the Apostle) that ye also have a Master.

And then, by setting down what Master it is they have above them (namely) not
an earthly, but an heavenly Master

And so the general things before us in this Verse, are these two.

First, a general exhortation to Masters to do to their servants, that which
is just and equal.

Secondly, a reason to strengthen that exhortation, and to press these duties
on them (namely) this, because Masters know (or at least, ought to know) that
they are not absolute Masters, and subject to none, but have also an heavenly
Lord and Master above them, to whose censure they are subject, and to whom they
must one day render an account.

Of these two things in order.

Interpretation.
What we are to understand by Masters and Servants we heard before in the 22.
Verse of the foregoing Chapter, (namely) such as are masters according to the
flesh, and such are servants for wages, term of years, or howsoever. (Do)
the word properly signifies, exhibit, or yield* (that which is just) that is,
that you are bound unto, and of right ought to yield unto them, and cannot deny
them, unless you deal unjustly with them; (and equal) that is, that which
is meet and fit for you to yield to them even that which it beseems you to
yield to them, in regard of equity, piety, and a good conscience. Thus then
conceive the meaning of this exhortation.

You that are Masters according to the flesh, yield to your Servants, that you
are bound unto, and of right ought to yield unto them, unless you will do
them wrong, and deal unjustly with them, and that also that becomes you to
yield to them, even in equity, piety, and good conscience. Now, first the duty
of Masters toward their servants The duty of masters toward their servants.
here expressed comes to be further considered.

In handling of it, I will first lay forth the particulars wherein the just
dealing of Masters toward their servants consists.

First, the particular things which Masters are of right

Secondly, the special things wherein stands their equal

Thirdly, I will show the extent of the duty touching

And then after some examination, I will bring some

First therefore, know we, that Masters are of right to yield to their servants
three things, their just dealing with their Servants stands in three things.
The just dealing of masters with their servants stands in 3. things.




For as the Master must look, that none of his servants be idle, so he must
see that none of them be oppressed; if either of these things come to pass,
that the Servant be ouerburdened, or idle, it is a fault in the Master, and
he deals not justly with his Servant. Solomon says, A righteous man, a just
dealing man, regards the life of his beast, Prou. 12.10.
he will not load his poor dumb beast, with too heavy burdens, but he
regards the life and strength of it: Much more ought a master to regard the
life and strength of his servant, and accordingly to proportion out his
business and work.

Mat. 10.10.
that she rises whiles it is yet night, and gives the portion to her
household, and the ordinary to her maids; though she raise up her servants
betimes to work, Prou. 31.15.
yet she is not cruel toward them, but gives them their food in due season.
She fears not the snow for her family, for all her family is clothed with
Scarlet, 21.
or with double, etc. she prouides warm and thick clothes for her servants
that they may be defended against the extremity of cold.

but they must proportion out their admonitions, rebukes, and chastisments,
according to the offenses of their servants, and to that end, they must wisely
consider the nature and quality of the offense, and of light, and small
offenses, and little ouersightes, not to tak notice. Give not ear to all the
words that men speak, Eccles. 7.23.
lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee. This reason is given of it. For
often times thine heart knows that thou have cursed others: Verse. 24.
thine own heart can tell thee, thou have spoken as bad words against thy
betters, and if the fault be greater, deserving admonition, or rebuke, or
correction, to measure it out according to the nature and quality of it; he
must also consider, how often, or seldom, the Servant has fallen into that
fault, and whether he will be bettered by word only, or no, and if he
find, that he will not be chastised with words alone, Though he understand,
yet will not answer, as it is Proverb. 29.19. then to use further chastisement.

And he must ever take heed of passion in time of his censure, that he
neither rebuke nor correct his servant in rage and passion, for that will
certainly carry him beyond just measure, but he must do it in compassion
even mourning in his heart for the sin of his servant, with desire to help
him out of it.

And these three things spoken of are the particulars, that Masters are of
right to yield to their Servants.

Now in the second place, the special things that Masters are to yield to
their Servants in equity and conscience, are these three. There be 3. special
things that masters are to yield to Servants in equity and conscience.


That is,

First, moderate rest from their labors, lawful recreation, without which
servants cannot continue with any Exodus 23.12. Deuteronomy. 5.14.
Especially Masters are bound in equity and eonscience to give their servants
liberty to sanctify the Sabbath, and to keep an holy rest to the Lord on his
day, both publicly and privately; for they being created and redeemed as well
as their masters, are as highly endebted to the service and worship of God as
their Masters, this is plainly expressed in the fourth Commandment.

Amalakite did the poor Aegiptian, 1. Sam. 30.13.
being sick in the field. And the Master may not defraude his servant when he
is sick, of things needful, neither may he abridge him of any part of his
wages, for the time of his sickness; because the servant is not then
restrained from working by his own negligence, but by the hand of God, and it
may be, has gotten his sickness by his faithful pains taking in his
masters service; and therefore his master in equity is bound to relieve him
with things needful, and to give him his full wages agreed on between them
at the first.



Deuteronomy. 15.13.14.
The Lord commanded, that when there was a manumission, a free sendinge out of
servants: they should not let them go away empty, but that they should give
them a liberal reward, of that the Lord had blessed them withal, by their
service. Howsoever, that law was one of the judicialls belonging to the Jews
regiment: yet the equity of it, is perpetual, and belonges to us, and to our
posterity for ever. And we see then what are the special things, that
Masters are to yield to their servants, in equity and conscience.

Now, for the third thing propounded (namely) who be the Masters, that are to
deal thus justly, and conscionablie, with their servants, All masters are to
deal justly and conscionably with their servants.
that is laid down in the first word (Masters) The Apostle speaking
indefinitely, he gives us to understand, that this duty belonges to all
Masters whatsoever, without exception, of what state, calling, or condition
soever they be: and let not any man think that his greatness in place and
calling, or his mean concondition can dispense, with the neglect of any of the
forenamed particulars. And let all masters try and examine themselves touching
the duties delivered, and lay their practice to the rule: and if they so do,
where is the Master to be found that can clear himself, and can justly say,
he has not failed in his duty toward his servants: and to pass by them
that fail of infirmity, Reproof of such masters as fail in duty toward
their servants.
and against their purpose, are there not many Masters that fail wittingly and
willingly? Are there not some who are so far from yielding that which is just
and right to their servants, as that many ways they wrong them with hard and
cruel services, with burdens too heavy, with stripes too many, and which is
barbarous, and sauoureth of cruelty, pinch them in their food? Do they not
(as we use to say) both backe-beate them, and belly-beate them? And are there
not some who are ever finding fault with every trifling oversight? and if the
fault be greater, are there not some who are so far from considering the
nature and quality of the offense, and from grief and compassion in
correcting, as they fall on their servants in a rage and violent passion, rate
him, and beat him most unreasonably? And if we look to things that are to be
yielded to servants in equity and conscience, how do many Masters therein come
short of their duty? Do they not deny their Servants moderate rest and
correction, unless on the Lords day when they should be otherwise exercised?
Then they can be content their servants should have free liberty to recreate
themselves, wherein it does more harm to their souls, then good to their
bodies. And do not some Masters abridge their servants of liberty to sanctify
the Sabbath? yea, do they not of a covetous mind compel their Servants,
happily well minded, even against their wills to break the Sabbath, and to do
the ordinary works of their callings? And is not a usual thing for Masters
to cause their servants, almost every Sabbath to tarry at home, to dress
meat, and to make ready their dinners, and so indeed, they eat the flesh,
and drink the blood of their Servants? And are there not many Masters, who are
so far from recompencing the good service of their servants with some thing
over and above their wages, as many times they stay their wages for their
sickness, or for something they pretend, they have lost, or some damage they
received by them? Where is almost a Master that does carefully provide things
needful for his servants in time of sickness? Nay, do not many Masters
murmurre and grudge at it, that the poor sick servant eats and drinks, and
does nothing but spend and burden the family, and if they can by any means,
they will pack him out of the house, and if once they get him out, never after
regard him; these and the like, are the dealings of many masters, and
governors toward their servants.

Masters are to try themselves by the things before delivered.
that finding thy self defective and short of that duty thou ought to
perform to thy servants; be humble for that sin, it is a sin against thy
personal calling, and therefore a grievous sin, and so long as thou do live
in that sin thou can have no true peace in thine own conscience, nor any
assurance of Gods special potection over thee.

Therefore humble thy self, and betimes repent of that sin, and now knowing
thy duty, learn ever hereafter to make conscience of it; and to help thee
forward, consider further these three things. Three motives to stir up
masters to deal justly and equally with their servants.


First know that if a master deal unjustly or unequally with his servants, he
does exceedingly provoke the Lord to anger and heavy displeasure against him:
unjust or unequal dealing with servants is a crying sin, it calls for
vengeance. Behold the hire of the laborers (who are servants for the time)
which have reaped your fields (which is of you kept back by fraud) cries,
Iam. 5.4.
it makes a loud cry in the ears of the Lord of hoasts.

We find a fearful threatening denounced against this sin. The King
Zedekiah and the people, had made a covenant to proclaim liberty, Iere. 34.
from 8. ver. to 17.
that every man should let his servant go free, and every man his handmaid,
which was an Ebrue or an Ebruesse, and that none should serve himself of them,
and they afterward repented, and caused the servants and the handmaids whom
they had let go free, to return and hold them in subjection as servants and
handmaids, ver. 11. Then follows the threatening and a fearful speech, verse
17. ye have not obeyed me, in proclaiming freedom every man to his brother
and every man to his neighbor, behold I proclaim a liberty for you says the
Lord to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you a
terror to all the kingdoms of the earth. An heavy sentence, and to be thought
on with trembling of all that deal unjustly and unconscionably with their
servants, in deed unjust dealing with servants is a sin so displeasing to the
Lord, as in some case it is not sufficient for a master to be humbled for that
sin, and to make confession and acknowledgement of it to God, though with
salt tears, and much grief of heart, but he must also make some satisfaction
to his servant, Exodus 21.26.27. we find that a Master for pulling out his
poor servants eye or smiting out his tooth, must not content himself with
saying I am sorry for it.

Or being truly grieved for it, but he must give his servant his liberty and
freedom for it, Note.
for the rule is true, wrong in deed must be recompensed indeed with some
real recompense, otherwise the Lord accepts not of any humiliation for it,
which is a thing little thought on by many masters, who in their rage, beat
their servants or cast things at them, even what comes next to hand, to the
wounding or laming of them, and then think it enough to say, I am sorry, I was
too rash, I wish, I had not done it, I pray God forgive me, or the like, but
alas, that is not sufficient, thou must know the Lord accepts not thy
confession and humiliation for that sin, unless thou make some satisfaction
to thy poor servant, for his hurt or maime received by thee. Therefore
doubtless unjust dealing with servants, is a great and grievous sin, far
greater then some conceive it.

Again, unjust dealing with servants is a plain evidence of the want of Gods
fear, Leuit. 25.43. Thou shall not rule over thy brother being thine hired
servant cruelly, but

Where we see an opposition between hard and cruel usage of servants, and the
fear of God. If the people of God under the Law, dealt cruelly with their
brethren being their servants, they showed plainly they had no fear of God in
them, and the reason is given verse 42. because they were the Lords servants,
whom he brought out of the land of Egypt.



Last of all, consider what Job says, 31.13. he protests he did not
contemn the judgment of his servant, and of his maid, when they did contend
with him, and think themselves ill entreated by him. Mark his reason verse
14.15. He that made me in the womb, has he not made him, and if I should
deal unjustly or cruelly with them; What then shall I do when God stands
up? and when he shall visit me, what shall I answer? as if he had said, if I
wrong my poor servants, how shall I stand before him that is Lord and master
of us both? and how shall I come to him, and call on him with comfort, when his
hand shall be on me, and when he shall visit me with any affliction? a
reason of weight and to be thoroughly considered.

We see by this, if a master deal unjustly or cruelly with his servants,
he shall be at his wits end, and not know what to do, nor how with any
comfort to look up to the Lord, and call on him when the Lord stands up
against him, and visits him with any trouble, especially if the Lord cross
him, by the undutiful or unconscionable dealing of his servant, as it is just
with the Lord so to do, the master having dealt hardly with his servant,
either pressed him with too heavy burdens, pinched him in his food, cruelly
corrected him, or any way wronged him, it is just with the Lord that such a
master, sometimes suffers punishment at the hands of his servant, and is
crossed by the undutiful and unconscionable dealing of his servant; yea,
sometimes smitten with that servants tongue, the servant telling abroad to his
shame and discredit his hard usage, and it may be adding some thing to it, as
that he has not a good meals meat in a year, or the like: When an unjust and
cruel master, is thus crossed and smitten, he cannot appeal to the Lord, and
have recourse to him, and pray to him, that he would release him from that
cross; his own unjust and unconscionable dealing with his servant, sets a
bar between him and heaven, and he cannot pray to the Lord with comfort.

If then thou that art a Master, would not exceedingly provoke the Lord to
anger against thee, and commit a crying sin, a sin calling for vengeance,
and for which the Lord will not accept thy humilliation without some
satisfaction to thy poor servant. If thou would not make it evident, that
thou have no true fear of God in thee: if thou would not set a bar between
thee and heaven, and not be able to pray to the Lord, with comfort or any
assurance of release, when the Lord does visit thee with any affliction;
especially when thou art crossed by the undutiful, and unconscionable dealinge
of thy servant, and smitten by the tongue of thy servant, and happily wronged
by him. Then in the fear of God be admonished to yield to every one of thy
servants, that which is just and equal: require of them things proportionable
to their strength, give them food and raimente, or competent wages, to provide
them, and that in due time; have care to measure out to them, just censure and
correction for their faults; yield them moderate rest from their labors, and
lawful recreation, and in time of their sickness provide (as thou art able)
all good means that serves for their health and recovery, and that they have
good usage in time of their weakness; and give them also according to thy
power, some further recompense over and above their wages, at their departure,
according to the good and long service they have done thee; and if thou make
conscience of these things, doubtless the Lord will bless thee in thy
servants, and bless their labors to thee. And if thou be crossed by the
undutiful or unconscionable dealing of thy servant, yet thou may have
recourse to the Lord with comfort: power out thy complaint into his bosom, and
he will here thy prayers.

One thing more may be gathered from this exhortation of the Apostle,
considered together with some thing goeing before.

We are to mark that the Apostle having said in the chapter before, that
servants truly believing in Christ, and doing their duty to their Masters,
as they ought: in singleness of heart; they shall receive of the Lord, the
reward of everlasting inheritance: the LORD does esteem them as his sons and
heirs, of his eternal kingdom of glory, and will reward them as his sons
and heirs. Yet here he exhorts Masters, to deal justly with them, and to
yield unto them, meat, drink, and their just wages: and here Masters are
bound, and of right, ought to give their servants these things: and servants
may lawfully receive, and enjoy them, and still look for the promised reward
of eternal life, the point hence arising is this.

That right and title to heavenly inheritance, does not Right and title to
heavenly inheritance does not hinder any one from having part in the outward
good things of this life.
nor bar any one for having part in the outward good things of this life,
that is a child of God, and joint heir with Christ of the kingdom of heaven,
may notwithstanding, have, hold, enjoy, and posses wordly things, even those
things it pleases the Lord to give him, in his place and calling: and yet
certainly look for the promised reward of eternal life. It is a fancy and
dream of the Papists, which they thrust on their followers, that to lack
propriety in worldly goods, and wilfully to refuse the possession of them,
shall have reward in heaven above other states of life: a true believing
servant doing his duty in his place and calling, and receiuinge his wages
from his master, holding and using it as he ought: Confutation of a Popish
fancy.
the reward of everlasting inheritance, when such proud Popish votaries, who
willfullie refuse to posses any wordly goods upon conceit of greater
perfection: and indeed refuse labor, and all other good excersises and live on
the sweat of other men's brows: shall be shut out of heaven, and thrown down
to hell.

Come we to the second general thing laid down in this verse (namely) the
reason, the Apostle uses to persuade all masters, to yield to their servants
that which is just and equal, taken from their subjection to an higher master,
amplified by their own knowledge of it, or that they ought to know it, and by
setting down what master it is (namely) not an earthly but an heavenly master
(knowing) the word is the same we had verse 24 chap. 3. Interpretation.
and so to be expounded (knowing) that is, certainly knowing (ye also) that
is, even ye as well as your servants (have a master) that is, have one above
you, who as a master has power and authority over you, to call you to an
account for things done or left undone, to whom you must yield a reckoning and
account, as of all other things, so of your dealing with your servants (in
Heaven) the meaning of that amplification is not that they have a Lord and
master in Heaven, locally circumscribed as the Epicure thinks, Job 22.14. but
the meaning is a great, mighty, and most powerful Lord and Master, even the
Almighty Lord of Heaven and earth, who is here said to be in heaven, because
he is most glorious and most powerful, able to punish offenders most
severely, and as the Apostle says, Romans 1.18. to reveal and manifest his
wrath against them from heaven, even to pour and to rain down his judgments
on them, as a mighty storm that falls with violence from heaven on the earth.

Thus then conceive we the words, as if the Apostle had said.

Certainly knowing that your selves as well as your servants have one above
you, as a master, that has power and authority over you, to call you to an
account for your dealings with your servants, even the Almighty Lord of Heaven
and earth, who is most glorious, mighty and powerful, able to punish you (if
you offend) most severely, and to throw down his judgments on you, as a
mighty storm from heaven. We are here first to mark and consider the
argument of the Apostle: he reasons thus with Masters, ye Masters yield to your
servants that which is just and equal, for you your selves are under another,
you have one as a master above you, who has power and authority to call you
to account for your dealings, and to punish you if you deal unjustly and
unconscionably with your servants, where we see the Apostle persuades masters
to do their duty to their servants by an argument from their subjection to
an higher Lord and Master, who sits above them as a Sovereign Lord, having
pour to call them to an account and to punish them for their neglect of duty,
or any abuse of their authority, and they are to consider it.

Hence we may gather this conclusion.

That a special means to keep masters, and indeed If masters and all
superiors cont^nually remember that they have a supreme heavenly Lord and
master above them, it is a notable means to make them conscionable and careful
in doing their duty. Job 31.21.
and to do it as they ought, is for them to have an eye upward and ever to
look, and to fix their eyes on a sovereign Lord that is above their Masters
and all superiors, men in any place above others are ever to carry in mind and
remember that they have a supreme heavenly Lord and master above them, to
whose censure they are subject, and to whom they must one day render an
account of all their dealings, and they shall find it will be a notable means
to work in them a conscience of their duty, and to make them ever careful to
do it aright, we have a worthy example of this in Job, he cleeres himself
(being in place above others) from abusing his power and authority, to the
wrong of any poor helpless person under him, and he wishes that if he lift
up his hand against the fatherless, that is, used his power and authority
against the fatherless, when he might help him in the gate that is in the
place of justice that his arm might fall from his shoulder, 22.
and be broken from the bone, and mark his reason what moved him to take such
heed of abusing his authority and to abstain from doing wrong, and dealing
unjustly with any? surely this, he had his eye ever upward, his eye, even the
eye of his mind, was ever on the great and glorious Majesty of the Lord, 23.
he knew and remembered that he had a Lord above him, and if he did wrong to his
inferiors, he was subject to his punishing hand, as himself says verse 23.
for Gods punishment was fearful unto me, and I could not be delivered from
his highness, we read Genesis 50.19 that Joseph reasoned thus, with his brethren
fearing (their father being now dead) that he would have paid them again all
the evil which they had done to him, and came unto him, and craved pardon of
him, and said, we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of thy
fathers God, Verse. 17.
Joseph made them this answer, Fear not, for am not I under God? as if he had
said, do not think that I will deal with you as you do imagine and take on me
(now I have power) to use my power to that end, to requite the wrong you have
done to me, no, no, my brethren, I know I am subject to an higher power, I am
under God and I have mine eye on that great and mighty Lord that is above me,
and therefore fear no such matter; a plain evidence and proof of this point
that it is an excellent means to keep masters and all superiors in order,
and from dealing unjustly and unconscionably with their inferiors, even to
lift up their eyes and to look upward and to remember that they have a supreme
Lord above them to whose censure they are subject, and to whom they must one
day give an account.

The reasons of this is plain.



And,

Secondly, it will work in them humility, an humble mind, and humble
carriage, and not suffer their minds to swell, nor to be lift up in them
above their brethren, Deuteronomy 17.20.
which the Lord would not have in the King himself; which swelling indeed is
the cause of scorn and contempt and of oppression and wrong.

Hereby then we may see, whence it comes to pass Wh^nce it is that Masters
and other Superiors abuse their power and authority.
and make no conscience of dealing justly and conscionably with their servants
and inferiors, they fear not to wring them and wrong them, and to deal
hardly with them in many respects, here is one special cause of it, they
look not upward, they have not an eye and due regard to that great Lord that
is above them.

Would Masters and other Superiors if they had an eye to heaven, if they did
behold the high and glorious Majesty that sits above them, with vengeance in
his hand to be thrown down upon them, if they deal unjustly and
unconscionably with their Servants; would they then, as sometimes they do, not
care to do open wrong to their Servants, that all men see, and cry shame
upon? Or would they covertly and cunningly wrong them, happily under color of
law and justice, equity and conscience? As Iesabel dealt with Naboth, 1 King.
21. Certainly no, if they had any spark of grace in them, they would not, but
many Masters and Superiors look only downward, and their eye is only on the
poor servant, and such as are under them, and thence comes much unjust and
unconscionable dealing toward them, and that makes them swell and lift up
themselves above them, and their own corruption helped forward by the Devil,
teaches them to think and say with themselves.

What? Am not I a man of place and authority? am not I in this or that office?

Yea, to say as it is Psalm. 12 4. Who is Lord over me? Who shall check and
control me for my dealing with my servant, or my inferior? Who has any thing
to do with it? with many like speeches.

Masters and other Superiors are to have an eye to that great and glorious
Lord that is above them.
ever lift thou up thine eye, and look up to that great and glorious Lord
that is above thee, and remember that he has power over thee, to call thee to
an account, and to censure thee, yea to throw both body and soul into Hell
for sin, and it will be a notable curb to thee, and hold thee back from
unjust and unconscionable dealing with any that is under thy power, and withal
remember, that in respect of thy power and authority, thou bear the image of
God, and will thou blot and blemish that, and abuse that to work injustice and
to do wrong? certainly that sin cannot escape the sharp punishing hand of
God.

Come we to the amplification of the Apostles argument in the word (Knowing)
that is, certainly knowing, being persuaded of it as a certain truth, where
we see, the Apostle speaks to Masters among the Colossians, as to men
certainly knowing, and nothing doubting, but that they had a master above them
in heaven; the Apostle made no question, but that it was a known truth,
whereof Masters among the Colossians were assured, and fully persuaded: and he
does enlarge his argument, and further press this duty on them from their own
knowledge of this, that they had a Master above them, as if he had said.

Ye Masters do that which is just and equal to your servants, forasmuch as
you are not ignorant, but you certainly know it, that you have one above you
as a Master, that has power and authority over you, to call you to an account
for your dealings with your servants. Hecne we gather thus much.

That certain knowledge of the truth of that which is brought in way of
argument to persuade to any duty, Certain knowledge of the truth of an
argument either of persuasion, or of disswasion, is of great force to prevail
with them in whom that knowledge is.
or to diswade from any sin, is of great weight and force to prevail with
them in whom that knowledge is; when a man can say to any person or persons,
do this, for you know how you are bound to do it, or what will follow the
doing of it, or avoid that, for you know the danger of it, it gives great
advantage for the seating and settling of that persuasion, or diswasion on the
hearts of them to whom it is directed.

Hence it is that our Apostle does often use this kind of enforcement, either
to press some duty, or to dissuade from some sin, that they to whom he writ
knew this or that, as 1. Cor. 6. We have example of it in many verses, as verse
2. Do not ye know that the Saints shall judge the World? Verse 9. Know ye
not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? and in many
other verses of that Chapter. Ephesians. 5.5. He uses the same kind of
amplification; For this ye know that no Whooremonger, etc. And hither I might
bring many other places, wherein the same enforcement and amplification is
used, being indeed of great force to settle an argument on the hearts of them
to whom it is directed, and the reason is plain, (namely) this.

The mind and judgment being convinced of the truth of an argument,

Now this serves to discover the exceeding hardness, The exceeding hardness and
searednes of many men's hearts discovered.
and (as I may say) the searednesse of of the hearts of many in the world, who
will not be persuaded to that which is good, or dissuaded from that which is
evil, though they know that to be most true, yea, truth it self, that is
brought as an argument to work on them; as let this undeniable a^gument be
brought to dissuade the swearer, the drunkard, or any other profane person
from his sin; that one day he must appear before Gods judgment seat and
come to judgment for his sin, and it moves him nothing at all, no, though it
be sharpened and driven down with this enforcement, that he knows it to be
true and his own conscience tells him so, yet the edge of it is many times
turned back, and blunted on the hardness of his heart.

Will thou say thou swearer, thou drunkard, or thou profane person, whosoever
thou art, that thou know not this, or thou art not persuaded of the truth of
it, that thou must one day come to judgment for thy sin? Why there is one
within thee, even thine own conscience will tell thee the contrary. Some
knowledge of a judgment to come is implanted in nature: the very heathen in
the darkness of nature had some glimmering light of it, and therefore set up
Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, as judges in Hell.

And hence it is, that even mere natural and carnal men, though they sin
in a corner, no eye of man looking upon them, yet they tremble and are afraid,
and the word of God is pregnant and plentiful to this purpose, and it has
often sounded in our ears, and therefore thou can not plead ignorance, that
thou know it not, and yet will not thy knowledge of the truth of this
argument (thou knowing it to be true from the light of nature, and from the
word of God) work on thee, and dissuade thee from thy sin? Oh then thou must
needs confess thou have a most hard and benumbed heart, and that is the
greatest plague that can befall any in this life, that is greater then the ten
plagues of Aegipt, and therefore now take notice of thy fearful condition,
and with speed hasten out of it, and take this with thee, and think on it, if
thy knowledge of this truth that there is a Lord above, and a judge of all the
world, who will one day bring thee to judgment for thy sin, do not now
prevail with thee to dissuade thee from thy sin, thou shall one day find
and seele the truth of it, yea, thou shall seele the weight of his wrath to thy
eternal woe and confusion for ever.

The Apostle adds (in heaven) a master in heaven (that is) a most glorious,
mighty, and powerful Master.

Hence it is clear.

That Masters and all Superiors have a most mighty and powerful Lord and
Master over them, Masters and all Superiors have a most mighty and powerful
Lord and master over the^.
therefore they are to serve him in fear, They are to serve that Lord in fear.
and to rejoice unto him with reverence, Psalm. 2.11. And to fear the stroke
of his hand it must needs be an heavy stroke that comes from the highest
heavens. The greatest man in the world, can fetch his blow but from his head;
his crown,

foolish opinion of ignorant people met withal.
who think that God sits in heaven like an old man, with a Crown on his head,
and a Scepter in his hand: and this must teach us, when we come before the
Lord, to pray unto him, to hear his word, or the like, Note.
to come with all reverence and fear, this is the argument of the Preacher,
Eccl. 5.1. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to
utter any thing before God: for God is in the heavens and thou art on the
earth, let thy words be few. We must take heed of lightness and unseemly
behavior in the presence of God.

VER. 2. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.
I have not yet laid forth the parts of this Chapter, though I have handled
the first verse of it, because (indeed) the first verse of this Chapter
belongs to foregoing matter, being a continuance of the Apostles exhortation to
special duties that concern Christians, and so rather to be reserved to the
former Chapter then to this.

The parts of this Chapter.
But now for the general resolution of this Chapter, into the parts of it,
leaving that verse as belonging to the third Chapter. Know we that it contains
in general two things.



The conclusion of this Epistle subdivided.


Now the conclusion contains in it these more special branches.









Now then the first general (as we said) is a regression, The first general
part of this Chapter subdivided.
a turning from special to general duties, the Apostle exhorting thereunto in
2.3.4.5.6. verses, and his exhortation is twofold, and may thus be branched out.

First, an exhortation to prayer and thanksgiving in 2.3.4. verses.

Secondly, to a wife carriage and behauior toward them

For the first of these the Apostle does exhort to prayer and thanksgiving,
both for themselves and for others generally verse. 2. and then also for him and
Timothy in particular, expressing what he would have them to ask of God for
them in verses 3.4.

Come we then to his general exhortation in the second verse, (Continue in
prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving) where we have the Apostles
exhortation to prayer, not barely propounded, but amplified by two qualities
which he requires in prayer, (namely) continuance and watchfulness; he
exhorts to prayer, and that continual and earnest, (continue in prayer and
watchfulness in the same) and then to join to prayer thanksgiving.

Continue (that is) go on, persevere, Interpretation.
and be incessant (in prayer) the word translated prayer, in this place does
properly signify adoration, or an humble entreaty for any thing at the feet
of another, when a man does prostrate and humble himself at the feet of
another and entreat for some thing at his hands, and so this word is here to
be taken in a large sense and signification (namely) for any humble and holy
request made and offered up to God by faith in the name of Christ, for things
needful, either for our selves, or others, the word (prayer) in this place, is
to be taken as comprehending under it both request made to God, for good things
for our selves, properly called petition, and request made for the avoiding, or
removing of evil from our selves, called supplication, or deprecation, and
also request made for the good of others, or the turning away of evil from
others, called intercession, as they are distinguished by the Apostle, 1 Timothy
2.1. I exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

(And watch in the same) The meaning of these words is, and be fervent in that
holy exercise of Prayer, let it be performed of you with earnest intention of
soul and body, for watchfulness (as we know) is opposed to drowsinesse, and
sleepiness; and so here, being applied to prayer, is opposed to a cold,
careless, drowsy, and sluggish performance of that duty: (with
thanksgiving) that is, with returning praise, and thanks to God, for good
things received, whether they be obtained by your requests, or freely bestowed
upon you, without, or above your supplication.

Thus then conceive we the meaning of the Apostle in the words of this verse,
as if he had said.

Persevere, and be incessant in making and offering up to God by faith, in the
name of Christ, humble, and holy requests for things needful, both for your
selves and others, and be fervent in that holy exercise, performing it, with
earnest intention, both of heart, mind, and body, and return praise for good
things received, whether they be given upon your request, or freely bestowed
upon you, without, or above your supplications. We are here to mark, that
our Apostle having laid before the Colossians, many excellent duties, both
general and special, both common to all Christians, and proper to some in
their particular state and condition of life, he now exhorts them to prayer.

Our lesson hence is this.

Although teaching and exhortation be singular and notable means to frame us
to godliness and righteousness

It is not enough for us to hear, and to be informed of duties that concern
us, both as we are Christians, and in our particular states and conditions of
life, and to be stirred up to the practice of them, but to that enformation and
incitement, prayer must be added, It is not sufficient to be informed what
duties concern us both in general and particular, and to be stirred up to the
practice of them, but to that information and incitement prayer must be added.
both public and private, for why? as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 3.6. I have
planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase: so then neither is he
that planteth, any thing, neither he that waters, but God that gives the
increase. Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God gives the increase, and at
his hand it must be sought for, by earnest prayer; the Lord that has promised
a blessing to his ordinance, has appointed prayer to be the means to draw it
down to us, and having commanded us to hear him speakinge to us in his word,
he has appointed that we should seek to him in prayer, to make his word
effectual unto us.

And the reason

And though the spirit give knowledge of duties that concern men both in
general and special, yet if he do not also bend the will and affections,
and frame the whole man to an holy obedience, certainly there will follow no
conscionable practice of those dutie^.

Now the spirit is to be sought for by prayer, and to the prayer of faith the
promise is m^de, that by it we shall obtain the holy Ghost, Luke 11.13. if you
which are evil can give good gifts unto your chi^dren, how much more shall
your heavenly father give the holy Ghost to them that desire him. And therefore
(doubtless) to teaching and exhortation out of the word, that they may be
effectual, prayer must be added, both public and private.

This then (for the use Reproof of them who add not prayer to their hearing
of the word of God.
many there be, who ^re so far from adding prayer to that which they have
heard taught, and to which they have been exhorted out of the word of God, as
they never so much as once think on things delivered; if once they get out of
the Church the things spoken are to them as though they had never heard them.
They suffer the Devil to steal the seed out of their hearts, and to take up
their minds with other thoughts, yea, if (happily) some do a little think or
speak of things they have heard, and will freely confess that Paul may plant,
and Apollos may water, but God gives the increase. Yet where is almost the man
or woman, that do so humble themselves in prayer, and privately call on God to
make the things they have heard profitable to them, and to work in them faith
and holy obedience, such a man or woman is rare for to be found.

What? do thou dream of any strength in thy self, to believe or to do
the things thou have heard out of the word of God? Art thou so unacquainted
with the corruption of thine own heart? that is a gross blindness indeed,
and if thou so think, thou shall never do any good duty made known to thee
out of Gods word: good duties are discovered to thee out of the word of God,
that thou may see thine own weakness and wants, and bewail them, and
humbly beseech the Lord, as well to make thee obedient to his will, as to
reveal to thee the rule of life.

And for want of this, because men do not add private prayer to that which
has been taught, and to which they have been exhorted, it comes to pass
that the word is unfruitful and unprofitable to them, though both general and
special duties have been laid before them, and they have been stirred up
to the practice of them, yet most men are still in their sins, and as
unreformed as ever they were, and here is the cause of it, to teaching and
stirring up to their duties, they never added prayer, they never humbly
besought the LORD, as he had outwardly taught rhem their duties by preaching,
so he would inwardly teach them by his holy Spirit, and work in them a
conscience of their duties.

Well, consider (I beseech you) it is a fearful thing when the holy
ordinances of God have no power with us, when they are not effectual to our
good, and that comes to pass for want of earnest prayer to God, as well in
private as in public for a blessing upon them.

Yea, hence it is, that often times the LORD does power down a curse upon men,
and they are made worse by the holy things which they have heard and
therefore learn we ever hereafter, to teaching and exhortation to add prayer.

Yea, let such as make conscience to meditate and confer on the word heard,
join to their meditation and conference earnest and hearty prayer, it was
David's practice to meditate in the Law of God continually, Psalm. 119.97. verse,
and that he sanctified his meditation by prayer, it is clear Psalm. 19 14. let
the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength and
my redeemer, and therefore think not because thou art a man fearing God, and
thou make conscience to meditate on the word heard, and thou do rightly
conceive of things delivered, therefore thou need not add prayer to thy
meditation; no, no, the more godly thou art, the more need have thou to pray,
because Satan will be busiest against thee, and thou art the readiest to be
puffed up with a conceit of thy knowledge and remembrance of holy things
therefore do not thou forget to join to thy hearing to thy meditation and
conference, earnest and humble prayer.

Now touching the Apostles exhortation to prayer, much might be said of prayer
in general, but I hold that not so pertinent to the purpose of the Apostle, I
will rather speak of the qualities here required to be in prayer.

We are to continue and persevere in prayer.
that we continue and persevere in calling on the name of the Lord in prayer,
and pray continually, and this the Scripture much exhorts unto, 1. Thessal.
5.17. Pray continually, Ephesians 6.18. Pray always with all manner of prayer
and supplication in the Spirit, Luke 18.1. Our Savior spoke a Parable unto
them, to this end, that they ought always to pray, and not to wax faint, and
this I might further prove by many examples, and make it clear that we are
not to think the exercise of prayer, needless or unseasonable at any time.

The reason supplied, our sins remitted, we supported in temptation and
delivered from evil?

And if we have all things that heart can wish, belonging both to body and
soul, yet we have need to crave Gods blessing on them, that they may do us
good.

All times therefore ministering occasion of prayer, we are to pray continually.

If this be so, may some say,

To answer

Ordinary, to be used daily: Extraordinary, at some times, as occasions
requires, as for the avoiding or removing of some great affliction, or heavy
judgment, or for the obtaining of some needful grace or temporal blessing,
and for the performance of this, a man may for a time omit the works of his
calling, and give himself wholly to prayer, but ordinary prayer, that may
stand with the performance of all duties belonging to a man's calling, a man
may both serve God by ordinary prayer, and that continually, and do
whatsoever his calling (though it be most laborious) does require, and that
this may be conceived.

Know we further.

That ordtnarie prayer is either set and solemn, in ample manner to be
performed, and that upon set and certain occasions, as at the beginning of
works, at the receiving of the creatures of God, at our going to rest at
night, or it is sudden and short, called Eiaculation of heart (that is) a
secret and sudden lifting up of the heart upon any occasion; and this kind
of ordinary prayer may be used in the midst of necessary business, it does
neither hinder it, nor is hindered by it.

Thus we see how we may pray continually, either by set, or by sudden
prayer, and yet not omit the duties of our callings, nor the preservation of
life.

Reproof of such as pray by fits and starts, and of such as either break ^he
use of that exercise, or seldom use it.
and hence it is, that some pray only by fits and starts, only in time of some
affliction, when the hand of God is on them, or when their consciences are a
little touched with the point of the spiritual sword, the word of God, and
some there be, who heretofore have used prayer in their houses, and now have
either altogether left off that exercise, or seldom use it, and so indeed show
themselves to be hypocrites, Job does so brand them, Job. 27.10. will the
hypocrite call upon God at all times or continually; as if he had said,
certainly no, he will not.

Two motives to stir us up to ^ontinu^^ce and per^ ^uer^nce in prayer.
Now then to persuade us to the practice of this duty: consider the necessity
of it, and the sweet and comfortable fruits of it.

For the necessity of it, to pass by our own wants of body, and soul,
which (if we feel) will bring us on our knees, there is a necessity lying
upon us in regard of Gods commandment, prayer being a special branch of his
worship required in his word, and his will is, that this commandment should be
as well kept as any other, and condemnation will befall us, as well for the
neglect of this, as of any other? And for the fruits of prayer, The excellent
fruits of prayer
they are many and great. Prayer as a means (not as a meritorious cause not
by merit and worthiness in it self but by faith in the promise) as a means
(I say) it obtaines remission of sins, it turns away all evils as
punishments; and supplies all wants, it does sanctify and give an holy use of
all the good things we enjoy, and without which we are usurpers, and do
wickedly abuse Gods blessings. For all things are sanctisied to our use by the
word and prayer, 1. Tim. 4 4.

Yea further, prayer gives strength to faith, hope, and other graces of Gods
spirit. And is it impossible (says one) that either that Christian who is
diligent in prayer, should be weak in faith and other graces, or that grace
should abound where there is a neglect of prayer, Matthew. 26.41. watch and pray
(says Christ) that ye enter not into temptation, as if he had said, be
vigilant and careful in the performance of this duty, that you may be strong
in faith, able to quench the fiery darts of the Devil, and to withstand the
force of temptation to sin.

And hence it is that one says, pray, and sin if thou can, noting how
special a preservative prayer is against temptation, if in time of temptation,
we fly to God in the prayer of faith, for strength and assistance, we^ shall
either have the temptation removed, or receive the answer made to Paul, 2.
Cor. 12.9. my grace is sufficient for thee.

Oh then seeing such precious fruits come from prayer, let us be stirred up to
a continual use of it, and to hold on a constant and continued course in the
practice of it, not only publicly in the congregation, but privately in
our houses, with our families, that so we may become familiar, and as it were
better acquainted with the Lord, for in prayer we have some familiar fellowship
with God.

Let us therefore have recourse to the LORD by prayer, that by it, as a means,
we may obtain pardon of sin, freedom from all euilles, supply of all
wants, and further strength and increase of all graces.

We are to take notice of one thing further comprised under this first
quality of continuance and perseverance in prayer, for indeed the word here
rendered (continue) signifies not only continuance in regard of time, but
instancie and importunity, and it is so translated by some, and that truly,
be instant in prayer.

So that hence we are taught.

We must after an holy manner be instant and importunate with God in prayer.
but we must be instant and importunate with the Lord in prayer, with an
holy instancie and importunity, we must not only hold on a constant and
continued course in prayer, but we must also solicit the Lord often, for the
same things, if our requests be not granted, we must pray for the same
needful things again and again, till he Lord answer us graciously, hear our
prayers, have mercy, and help us with such things as we crave at his hands,
or something proportionable, and this our Savior has taught us by the example
of a man that comes to borrow bread of his friend at midnight, Luke 11.8. I
say unto you, though he would not arise and give him because he is his
friend, yet doubtless, because of his importunity, he would rise and give
him as many as he needed.

So says Christ, ask and it shall be given you, not only ask but seek,
neither there rest, but knock, and and this also is taught by the Parable of
the widow and wicked judge, who feared not God, nor reverenced man Luke
18.1.5. and the reasons why we must be instant in prayer, and after an holy
manner importunate, and even bold suitors of God, asking and craving the same
needful things (as yet not granted) again and again are two.



and depend on the LORD, not only in the matter of his promise, but also in
respect of his own good time appointed for the accomplishment of it, and that
we are not such, as if we be not heard at the first, will fling away in a
chafe, as men use, who having received repulse and denial, say they will never
open their mouths more in the matter, they will not be so much beholding to
them to whom they sue, that we may show our selves far from this impatient
behavior, and that we are not such as prescribe when the LORD shall hear and
grant our requests, but that we in patience depend upon him, we must (our
lawefull requests being not yet granted) still continue to solicit and
importune the LORD in our prayer.

Many there be who are justly taxed as failing in this duty.

Some there be that will prescribe to the Lord when he shall hear them, and
are impatient of any delay; Reproof of them who ei^heir prescribe to the Lord,
when be shall hear their prayers, or are impatient if their requests be not
speedily gran^ed.
yea, be there not some, who, if the Lord do not hear them, nor and answer
them according to their desire, after once or twice calling upon him, and
asking of some needful thing at his hands, even secretly shrink from the
LORD, and say in their hearts, as the King of Isreal's messenger said, 2 King.
6.33. Should I attend on the Lord any longer? Their practice shows it
plainly: for let the hand of God be upon them, and let them be under any
affliction, in their bodies, children, or goods, and what do they? Happily at
the first they seek and sue to the LORD by prayer, themselves, and desire
others to pray for them, but if comfort and deliverance come not when they
would have it; Do they still continue seeking and suing to the LORD? Are they
impotunate suitors, in patience waiting for the Lords answer? Nothing less.
They fall from seeking to the Lord, even to seek to the Devil and his
instruments, to Witches, Wizards, and such like: Surely such persons show they
have no true faith in the promise of God, they trust not God on his word for
comfort in this life. And it is certain (say what they will) they trust him
not for comfort in the life to come, and for the salvation of their souls;
yea, even the dear children of God do sometimes fail in this duty, and show
their infirmity in this kind, Note. Gods children are sometimes impatient, if
the Lord defer to grant their requests.
when they living under some great affliction, power out their suits to the
Lord for ease, comfort, and deliverance, and the Lord seems to have a deaf
ear, and after some good space of time, their requests are not granted, what
shall ye hear sometimes from them? Surely this, or the like speech, sauouring
too much of their own weakness, alas, I have many times called on God, and
made my humble suit unto him for comfort, but as yet, I find none, or the Lord
seems to hide his face from me: and as the Prophet says, Lament. 3.8. When I
cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer? What would you have me to do? Shall
I still continue praying? I fear me, the Lord is angry with me. Thus do
the dear children of God, sometimes discover their weakness.

2. Things are to be considered to make us instant and importunate with God in
prayer.
And we must learn to strengthen our selves against it, and if thy lawful
request be not granted after many times calling upon God, yet do thou still
persist in prayer, and comfort thy self with the consideration of these things.

First know, that the Lords delay to grant thy request,

for the special good of his children. 4. Reasons why the Lord does defer to
grant the requests of his children.


As first, that by deferring he may try their hope, and exercise their faith,
that he may see whether they thorowlie believe his promise, and will depend on
his goodness, even then when he seems to hide his face from them: thus dealt
Christ with the Canaanitish woman, Matthew, 15. from 22. verse to thy 28.

First, she cried, Have mercy on me oh Lord, the son of David, my daughter is
miserably vexed with a Devil, he answered not a word, made as though he
heard not.

Secondly, his Disciples besought him for her, then he Israel. Yet she came
again, worshipped him, and said, Lord help me; he repelled her again with
this; It is not good to take the childrens bread and to cast it to whelps: he
called her dog, a bitter repulse, yet she still persisted in prayer; and then he
answers, O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee as thou desire.

Secondly, the Lord sometimes deferreth to grant gifts sought by prayer, that
when they are given, they may be more welcome to us.

Thirdly, that his benefits should be esteemed of, more

And last of all, that our feruency in prayer might increase.

Thus the Lord dealt with Moses, Exodus 32. The Lord Moses prayed for them he
seemed not to regard his prayer. Nay, he said to him, verse. 10. Let me alone
that my wrath may wax hot against them, for I will consume them; this was to
inflame the affection of Moses, to make him more instant for the safety of the
people, as (indeed) he was, verse 11. O Lord (says he) why does thy wrath
wax hot against thy people which thou have brought out of the land of Egypt.

Thus we see that repulse must not discourage us from perseverance and
importunity in prayer, no, no, if thy lawful request be not granted after many
times praying, know it is for one of these 4. causes before spoken of: and
withal remember, if the Lord give thee grace to persevere in prayer, he
deferring to grant thy request, that is a more excellent gift then the thing
thou suest for, and exceeding pleasing to God; and therefore let not thine own
corruption prevail with thee, and cause thee to cease calling on God, because
he seems not to hear thee for a time, think not that the Lord is therefore
angry with thee, that is but thine own weakness, still persist in prayer,
and the Lord in his appointed time will hear thee, and give thee that thou
call for, or some thing proportionable, even that which shall be most for
his glory, and thine own comfort.

Come we to the second quality here required in prayer (watch in the same.)

We must be fervent in prayer, and pray with earnest intention of hearts,
mind, and body.
it is not enough that we pray, and that we continue and persevere in prayer,
unless we be also watchful and fervent in prayer, and therefore our Apostle
here ioines these two together; Continue in prayer, and watch in the same: So
likewise Ephesians. 6.18. requiring that we should use our Spiritual armor with
all prayer and supplication upon all occasions, in, or by the Spirit, he
adds, and watching thereunto withal perseverance and supplication. And 1.
Pet. 4.7. says the Apostle, Be ye therefore sober, and watching in prayer;
and that prayer must be fervent.

The reason and ground of it, is the Commandment of God, who has inioined us,
to fear, love, and serve him, with all our heart, soul, and strength, he
requires vehemence and feruency in all duties both toward himself and toward
men, therefore prayer being an excellent service of God, it ought to be
fervent, and to be powered out with earnest intention, both of soul and body.
Hence it is called, a pouring out of the soul, 1 Samuel 1.15. and of the heart,
Psalm, 42.4. And indeed, the heart and inward soul is the chief seat of
feruency in prayer, howsoever feruency in prayer be for the most part,
expressed by outward signs and gestures of the body, as by shedding of tears,
by lowdnesse of voice, by bowing or prostrating of the body, by lifting up the
hands, eyes, and such like, yet sometimes, no doubt, there may be a fervent
prayer made to God, Note.
where these signs and gestures are wanting, as in case of extreme weakness
of body, when the body through rage, or extremity of sickness is exceedingly
weakened, the senses decayed, speech taken away; so that the heart and mind
are the chief seat of feruency in prayer, they especially are to be carried to
a quick and ready performance of the duty of prayer, and to be watchful and
attentive in it, yet so, as (out of the case before specified) that feruency be
expressed, by outward signs and gestures of the body, the exercise of prayer
must be performed with earnest intention both of soul and body.

Here then I might justly tax many Popish prayers, as lip-labor and
displeasing to God, Many popish prayers lip-labor and displeasing to God.
as their prayer in an unknown tongue, their numbering of prayers on their
beads uttered without any sincere affection of the heart, and their mumbling up
their prayers in their canonical hours, etc. But I leave them, and come to
our selves: Is it so,

What then shall we say of such, as have no sooner kneeled down and lifted up
hands and eyes toward heaven (and some do scarsely so much) but forthwith,
Reproof of such as are drowsy and sluggish in prayer, or pray only of
custom and for fashion sake.
as if they were a sleep, or in a heavy slumber, they hau^ forgotten before
whom they have presented themselves, and what is the thing they have in hand.
Others having begun well, by and by forget themselves, and suffer their
drowsy minds to be carried to some other thing, and as if they were in a
slumber speak many times they know not what, or at least they consider not
what.

And do not many come before the Lord, both in public and private, and call
on him only of custom, and for fashion sake, and so utter out a cold and
sluggish prayer? These things are too common amongst men. Well, I beseech you
to consider things aright, would any man thus behave himself in making his
petition to a Prince, a mortal man, and that for trash and transitory things?
Surely, if he had any understanding in him, he would not, and shall we then be
so heavy, and drowsy, so cold and careless in supplicating, and making
petition to the King of Kings, for things of greatest weight and moment? Do we
think to obtain any mercy or good things at the hands of God by a sluggish
and drowsy prayer, uttered with yawning, half sleeping and half waking? No
certainly, we shall not, as the prayer of faith (if it be fervent) is an
excellent service to God, and exceeding pleasing to him, and o^ great force to
bring down many blesings from the Lord, Iam. 5.16. So on the other side, cold,
sluggish, and drowsy prayer, and a prayer only of custom and fashion, cannot
choose but be highly displeasing to the Lord, and a means to pull down his
curse; for the more excellent the service is, and the more acceptable to God:
the more shameful a thing it is, and the more displeasing to God, to perform
it slothfully and drowsily. and therefore take heed thou do not so perform
it. Labor thou to be fervent in prayer and to put up thy supplications and
suites to the Lord with earnest intention of soul and body.

And to that end use helps, as thou would use means to keep the body
waking, if thou were to attend some weighty business in the night: 3. Things
helpefull to make us watchful and fervent in prayer.
so in the holy business of prayer, use means to keep thy mind and thy
heart waking, that they may be watchful and earnestly intend that business

And to that purpose,

First, call to mind and remember before whom thou Isai. 6.2.

Secondly, bring with thee a feeling of thy wants, even

And thirdly, fear just repulse, that the Lord may justly

And if thou carefully use these, and the like helps, doubtless thou shall
find them excellent means to rowse thee up in prayer, and to quicken thee to a
fervent calling upon the Lord, and to make thy heart and mind earnestly intent
on that holy business, and then thy prayer will be a means of many
blessings, and much comfort unto thee.

The Apostle adds (with thank^sgiuing) I spoke of the point of thanksgiving,
Cap. 3.17. and therefore will not now stand upon it, only note we, that the
Apostle would have prayer and thanksgiving joined together. He says not
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same, and give thanks, as if they were
things to be done at several times, But continue in prayer, and watch in the
same with thanksgiving.

Hence we may gather thus much.

That even then when we have cause to pray, we have also cause to bless the
Lord, When we have cause to pray, we have cause also to bless the Lord.
and to praise him, when we are under some cross or affliction, and have
cause to call on the lord for ease, and comfort, and deliverance, even then
also, have we cause to open our mouths to magnify and praise the name of the
Lord. And hence it is that our Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 5.18. exhorts us to give
thanks in all things.

Reproof of them who are so apprehensiue of their present affliction as they
forget Gods mercies vouchsafed unto them.
and it seals up their mouths that thy cannot bless the Lord for them as
they ought; let a man have cause to bless God for many good things, yet if he
be crossed in any one thing, that cross commonly takes away the remembrance
of these good things, and he forgets to bless the Lord for them.

This is a great corruption, we must learn to avoid it, and know, that even
then, when we (lying under the hand of God) have cause to pray, for ease,
comfort, and deliverance.

We have also cause to give thanks to the Lord, for many good things, for
(happily) in thy affliction the Lord gives thee patience, and inward comfort;
and this is certain, that in any affliction that befalles thee, the Lord
deals not with thee according to thy deserts, for he might plunge thee into
the pit of Hell for thy sins, and if he mittigate of that justice, and more
easily correct thee; thank him and bless his name for that mercy, and be not
only fervent in craving ease and comfort at his hands, in time of thy
affliction, but at the same time remember (as thou have just cause) to be also
as forward in giving thanks to the LOKD for mercies reeeiued.

VER. 3. Praying also for us, that God may open unto us the door of utterance
to speak the mystery of Christ: Wherefore I am also in bonds.
In this verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colossians to pray for him and
Timothy in particular, and requesteth them together with themselves to
remember him and Timothy in their prayers, (praying also for us) and then he
expresses what he would have them to ask of God for them, namely, the gift
of speech and utterance, under a borrowed and metaphorical speech, in these
words, (that God may open unto us the door of utterance) and withal he sets
down for what purpose they would have that gift of utterance bestowed on them,
even for the publishing and declaration of the Gospel, which (by way of
commendation) the Apostle calls the mystery of Christ (to speak the mystery of
Christ) and he further shows the excellency of the Gospel by his sufferings
for it, that for the Gospels sake, he doubted not to expose himself to
trouble, and was in bonds for it, (Wherefore I am also in bonds) and then he
further requires their prayers for himself more specially that such a gift of
utterance might be given unto him as was fit for the publishing of the
Gospel, both in regard of the excellency thereof, and of the special trust
of Apostleshippe committed to him verse the fourth, that I may utter it as it
becomes me to speak, these are the general things contained in these two
verses.

Come we to speak of them in order.

And first the Apostles request made to the Colossians comes to be considered,
he requesting their prayers for himself and Timothy (praying also for us)
there is no hardness in the words, for the sense of them, the meaning of them
is this.

Remember me and Timothy, together with your selves in your prayers,
commending your selves to the LORD in your holy petitions and supplications,
and us also together with your selves. Now then we are first to mark and
consider that our Apostle requesting the prayers of the Colossians for himse^fe
and Timothy, did thereby signify that he and Timothy stood in n^ede of their
prayers, and what was he and Timothy? surely men endued with a great measure
of knowledge and grace, and men of excellent gifts, Paul (no doubt) a chosen
vessel of God, Act. 9.15.
was a man of rare gifts, and adorned with excellent knowledge, wisdom,
courage, humility, and many other worthy graces of Gods spirit, and of
Timothy, he witnesses 2. Timoth. 3.14.15. that he had known the Scriptures
of a child, and was persuaded of the things he had learned of him, yet these
men request the prayers of the Colossians, and thereby implie that their
prayers were indeed need. full for them, and that they stood in need of
their prayers.



The best and the most holy have need of the prayers of others.
That even the best have need of the prayers of others, men that have the
greatest measure of sanctification, knowledge, and gifts, and are in great
favor with the LORD; notwithstanding have need of the prayers of others for
them: And hence it is that our Apostle not only here, but in many other places
does request the prayers of others for himself, Romans 15.30. he entreats the
Romans earnestly, even for the Lord Jesus Christ his sake, and for the love of
the spirit, that they would strive with him, by prayers to God for him, Ephesians.
6.19. he desires them of that Church that they would make supplication for all
Saints, not only for the weaker sort, but also for the strongest, and for him
in particular, that utterance might be given unto him, that he might open his
mouth boldly, to publish the secret of the Gospel, 2. Thessal. 3.1.
Furthermore brethren (says the Apostle) pray for us, that the word of the Lord
may have free passage, and be glorified as it is with you. Thus does our
Apostle often recommend himself to the prayers of others, and thereby plainly
show, that he conceived, and would have others to understand, that he stood in
need of other men's prayers.

The reason

First, because howsoever they have received much, yet

Secondly, they are in danger through their own corruption to swell, and to
be lifted up above their

Thirdly, the Devil is most busy against them that are more emminent then
others in grace and sanctification, greatest measure of grace, have need to be
helped by the prayers of others.

No man is to ^^^k himself (...) ^xcellent in ^nowledge, or ^^ny other ^ce as
that he has no mind of other men's prayers.
as that he has no need of other men's prayers, if any so think, he
deceiues himself in his own proud conceit, and his own heart deceiues him:
if a man have the spirit of grace, and prayer, and be able to pray for others,
and can boldly go to the throne of grace, and his calling be to pray for
others, (he being a Minister) yet he must know that himself also has need
of other men's prayers, it is not a matter of complement and form only for a
Minister, and one that is endued with an excellent gift of prayer, sometimes to
recommend himself to the prayers of the people, no, no, he ought to do it,
he must consider that the force of prayer is not from the dignity of the
persons that make it, Note.
but from faith in the promise, and though they that pray for him, be far
inferior to him in knowledge, and other excellent gifts, yet being many,
and joining together in the prayer of faith, as one man, their prayers are of
great force with the LORD, he has made a gracious promise to them, Matthew
the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth; If two of you (says our Savior)
shall agree in earth upon any thing, whatsoever they shall desire, it shall be
given them of my father which is in heaven.

For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
midst of them.

Acts 12. We find that earnest prayer, being made by the Church to GOD, for
Peter, when he was imprisoned by Herod, the LORD sent his Angel and delivered
him.

And therefore let none of us think it is a matter only of form, or a
needelesse thing for a Minister, or one that has excellent gifts, and
happily a notable gift of prayer himself, to crave the prayers of others; he
has need so to do, even in the time of his greatest strength, and in time of
sickness, or some great danger he ought to require the assistance of others
in prayer, and to put himself on the public prayers of the Church; and if
the best, and such as are endued with excellent gifts, have need of other
men's prayers, certainly, then they much more that are of meaner gifts, and
have less measure of grace.

Now before we come to the next point, it is not amiss to discover an error
of the Papists; from this and the like places of Scripture, our adversaries the
Papists would gather warrant for their invocation of Saints departed.

And thus they reason.

Saint Paul here and in other places desires the prayers of others living on
the face of the earth, and entreats them to pray for him: therefore (say they)
much more may we desire the prayers of Saints departed, A Popish argument for
invocation of Saints departed.
and now in glotie, and pray them to pray for us.

A weak and silly ground, it follows not,

What is there reply?

Forsooth (say they) we need no commandment to pray, or desire others to
pray for us, Reply of the Papists.
but it is sufficient to know their credit with God, and willingness to
entreat for us, when they are thereunto requested, ungrounded affections when
they can find noe warrant for them in the book of God: then (forsooth) they
stick not to say we need none, and they fly to other shifts and speculations
of their own, would a man think that a man of learning (as they will be
accounted) would ever breath and publish such rotten stuff? why? themselves
make invocation of Saints, a part of religious worship, and call it (...), yea
they call on Saints departed, as mediators between God and themselves: and
needs there no commandment nor express warrant out of the word for things
so weighty? surely none, but men that care not what they utter, would avouch
it; but it is an usual thing with our adversaries thus to deal.

In the next place, we are to mark, that our Apostle having made known to
the Colossians, that he allwaies prayed for them. Chap. 1.3. Here he desires
them to pray for him, and for Timothy: hence we may gather thus much

(...) M^n^ster and the people ought mutually to pray one for another.
as the Minister is bound to pray for the people, so again are the people
bound to pray for the Minister: and this is not only clear by the evidence
of this text, but also from other places before cyted, wherein the Apostle
requires to be helped by the prayers of other Churches.

And indeed there is great reason down of the Ministers is the overthrow of
the people, the Ministers are their sheepheardes, and if they be smitten, the
people are commonly like silly sheep scattered abroad, they are as the
watchmen of a castle or city, and if they be either blinded or corrupted
the city or castle may easily be surprised by the enemy, by these and many
other names of similitude given to ministers in Scripture, every man may see
what cause the people have to seek to sustain and strengthen them by their
prayers, and that they ought to strive in prayer to God for them continually.

We see then what we ought to do touching this particular.

Let us duly consider it, We must not rest in seeing the wants of our
ministers, but we must pray that the Lord would remove them, and make supply
of that which is wanting unto them.
but few there be, that seek supply to their wants, and strength to their
weakness, by their often and fervent prayer to God in their behalf.

No doubt thou may (if thou will be curious) spy many wants and
imperfections, in the best and most faithful Ministers, and if thou so do,
rest not in seeing and complaining of them, but use that same means which the
LORD has put in thy power for the redress of them, and pray to the LORD that
he would remove them, and give supply of that which is wanting, that is
their duty, and if thou be one that do pray for the Minister, remember to
pray for him chiefelie for his works sake, even in respect of the word of
comfort he brings to thee, In what respect the people are to pray for their
Minister.
(happily) many pray for the Minister in regard he is a quiet man, and not
contentious, and his outward carriage gives them contentment, (which indeed are
things commendable) and men are to bless God for these things, and pray for a
Minister endued with them, but look that thou do as the Apostle has taught
thee 1 Thessalonians. 5.13. Have the Minister in singular love for his works sake,
and testify thy love in praying for him, chiefelie for his works sake, and
for the worde^ sake; and pray thou that the LORD would more and more, fit and
enable him to the work of his ministry, and that the LORD would open his
mouth to speak to thy profit and comfort, and know that it is one great cause
that men find no sweetness in the comforts delivered by the Minister,
because they pray not for the Minister, that the LORD would open his mouth to
speak to their comfort, and therefore do thou (when thou come to hear a
faithful Minister) pray to the Lord that he would direct his heart, and open
his mouth, that he may speak to thy good, and thy comfort, and to take this
as a sure rule.

Note.
The best way to find comfort in our friends is to pray for them, so
certainly the best way to find comfort by the Minister, is to pray for
him, and therefore be careful to practice this duty, and pray to the Lord
that he would mo^e and more fit and enable his Minister to the work of his
calling and that he would give him strength, courage and power, to stand
against men and devils, that seek by force and subtlety, to daunt and
discourage him, or to drive him away, or to hold him back from the faithful
discharge of his ministry, and whenever thou come to hear him lift up
thy heart to the Lord for him, that the Lord would so guide his heart and
tongue by his Spirit, that he may speak to thy profit and comfort, and then
doubtless thou shall find much good by his teaching.

Mark we further, that in this request of the Apostle, he says not barelie
praying for us, but praying also for us, praying for us together with your own
selves.

Here then we do plainly see, that in praying for our selves, we must
remember others, as members of one and the same body with us: this point I
have heretofore handled, and therefore I now only name it.

And know we thus much briefly.

In that the Apostle says, praying for us, together with your selves; we may
gather that he that will pray for another, must pray for himself, He that will
pray for another must be able to pray for himself.
and he must be able to pray for himself, and if thou can not pray for thy
self, how can thou pray for another.

Wicked, profane, and loose persons, Reproof of such as promise to pray for
others, being not able to pray for themselves.
do this or that for me (say they) and I will pray for you, being indeed not
able to pray for themselves, with comfort for as Solomon says, Pro. 28.9. He
that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer shall be
abominable. He that is hardened in his sins, and willingly, and wittingly,
turns away his ear, from knowing or obeying the will of God, revealed in his
word, he cannot pray for himself with comfort, his prayer does incense the
Lord to further wrath against himself, and how then can he pray for another
with comfort? doubtless he cannot, and therefore labor thou to be able to
pray; and to put up the prayer of faith for thy self, otherwise never think
that thou art able to pray for another.

Come we to speak of the second general thing laid down in this verse
(namely) the thing the Apostle did wish the Colossians to ask and crave of the
LORD in their prayers for him and Timothy, expressed in these words, That GOD
may open unto us the door of utterance, he entreats the Colossians to pray
for him and Timothy, and he tells them what he would have them to ask of GOD
for them (namely) this, That GOD might open unto them the door of utterance.

Interpretation.
That form and phrase of speech (the door of utterance) in this place is a
Metaphorical and borrowed speech used by way of similitude, wherein the
Apostle compares the mouth, the instrument of speech, and utterance, unto a
door, or gate, of it self shut, which none is able to set open, but the Lord;
indeed the word (door) used Metaphorically, and by way of similitude, is
sometimes put to signify occasion, as Paul says, 1 Cor. 16.9. A great door
and effectual is opened unto me, (that is) a great opportunity or occasion of
preaching, and spreading of the Gospel is offered unto me, but here being put
with the addition (of utterance or speech) we are to understand by it the
mouth, the instrument of speech, which is as the door or passage of speech, and
the opening of that door, which is only from the Lord, as the Apostle here
says, (that God may open unto us the word of utterance) does imply two things.

First, a giving of a power and ability of speaking, and of utterance, all
natural impediments being removed; and taken away, a faculty to speak and
utter things without any impediment, and a giving of liberty of speech and
utterance without any outward let or hinderance.

Thus then we are to understand these words, as if the Apostle had said; Pray
for me and Timotheus, that the Lord (who is only able) would vouchsafe to set
open our mouths, that of themselves are shut, and not able to utter a word,
and that he would make them as open gates and doors, through which speech and
utterance may pass, that our mouths may be able to speak and utter forth
things without any natural impediment, and that they may speak freely without
any outward let or hinderance.

First, here consider we, what it is that the Apostle desired the Colossians
to pray for that the Lord would give to him, and Tymothy, (namely) this, that
God would open to them the door of utterance, that he would give them ability,
and liberty of speech, and utterance to preach the Gospel of Christ; he
desires them not to pray that the Lord would give them power to work miracles,
that they might be able to heal the sick, or the like, but that they would
pray, that the door of utterance might be opened to them.

Hence then we may easily see.

That an open door of utterance, a mouth able to A mouth able to utter forth
the secrets of the Gospel is absolutely needful for the Lords Minister.
yea it is a thing of absolute necessity, without which, none can be a good
Minister; let a man have never so much learning, and knowledge in his head, yet
if he want ability, conveniently and with some grace to utter, and express
the same, he is not fit for that holy function, and for the service of the
Ministry of the Gospel. Malak. 2.7. The Prophet said in time of the old
Testament, That the Priests lips should preserve knowledge, it should not be
only in his head, but in his lips, and they should seek the Law at his mouth,
and his mouth should be able to utter it.

And he gives this reason of it; For he is the Messenger Cor. 5 20. And being
the Ambassador of the Lord to his people, it follows necessarily that he must
be able and apt to deliver his embassage unto them.

Again, the people attain their faith ordinarily by hearing, Romans 10.17.
Faith is by hearing, and therefore it must needs be, that the Minister must be
able by speaking, to beget faith in them, and to confirm the same, as the
Apostle speaks plainly, Verse 14. How shall they hear without a Preacher,
without one to open and to utter forth to them the doctrine of the Gospel.

And hence it is, that the Apostle in the description of one that is to be
chosen to that great office of the Ministry, requires chiefly, that he be apt
to teach, 1 Timothy 3.2. It is then a clear point, that an open door of
utterance, a mouth able to utter forth the secrets of the Gospel, is a thing
most requisite, and ought to be found in some measure in every Minister of the
Gospel.

Dumb Ministers are insufficient ministers of the Gospel.
who are altogether destitute of the gift of utterance, are dumb and cannot
speak, and have no manner of ability to utter forth the secrets of the
Gospel? Admit they have all the virtues and good properties that can commend
a man in the world besides, yet wanting this they want that which is most
needful, yea absolutely needful, without which they cannot be fit for the
work of the Ministry; yet many such have crept into that calcalling, and
still lurk in the Church, and it being a matter of such great and absolute
necessity to utter forth the secrets of the Gospel.

We are to bless God for giving a minister to a people able and fit to
publish the secrets of the Gospel, and to pity them tha^ want such a minister.
where we see a Minister set over them that has knowledge and a competent gift
of utterance fit for the publishing of the Gospel, and conscience to use it,
the Lord has visited that people with a special favor. And we are to pity
that people to whom the Lord has denied that mercy, and suffered them to live
under a Minister that has no manner of ability that way: there case is
pitiful indeed, for howsoever Christ has done sufficient for the salvation of
all the world, yet they want the ordinary means whereby the benefit of
redemption might be applied to them, and so their case is lamentable, happily
they see it not, and in that respect it is more pitiful, and we are to put on
tender bowels, and in pity and compassion toward them, to pray to the Lord as
our Savior has taught us, Matthew. 9.38. that he would send to them such
workmen, as for knowledge, utterance, and other gifts are both fit, able, and
willing also, to make known, and to open unto them the secrets and sweet
comforts of the Gospel.

In the next place in that the Apostle does entreat the Colossians to pray for
him and Timothy, that the Lord would set open their mouths, and that he would
make them able to utter the secrets of the Gospel.

We are further taught.

That GOD only does open the door of utterance, God only gives ability and
liberty of speech.
not only the knowledge of holy things, and of the Mysteries of Christ, but
even words to utter them is from the Lord.

Let a man have never so much knowledge, and be as full of good matter, as was
Elihu, Job 32.18. Yet unless the Lord put words into his mouth, he shall be
dumb and not able to utter it, Exodus 4.11.12. We find that Moses pleading
his infirmity, and that he was not eloquent, but a man of slow speech, and
slow of tongue, the Lord said unto him, who has given the mouth? As he had
said, do thou not consider, that I only give ability and power to speak, to
whom I will, and that I take it away at my pleasure? Therefore go thy way, and
I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shall say. Psalm.
51.14. David entreating the Lord to deliver him from blood, he promises that
his tongue should sing ioifully of his righteousness. Yet in the next verse,
as if he had forgot himself, and not said well, in saying, my tongue shall
sing ioifully of thy righteousness; he makes his prayer to the LORD, that he
would open his lips, that his mouth might speak to his praise.

Plainly showing.

That though the LORD should, according to his request, give him the matter of
praise, and thanksgiving, and he should conceive it in his mind, yea put
matter into his mouth; yet, unless the Lord did add a further grace and
mercy, even to open his lips, he should not be able to utter it.

Act. 17.28. In the Lord we live, move, and have our being; every motion of
soul and body, (as it is a motion) is from the Lord; without his help and
assistance we are not able to move the least finger to the doing of any
outward civil thing, and therefore much more does he alone unloose the strings
of our tongues, and give ability and liberty of speech to utter forth holy
things, and the mysteries of the Gospel.

Confutation of free will as the Papists teach it.
Hence I might take occasion to show the error of the Papists, the patrons and
defenders of free will, who teach a freedom of will, even in the will it
self, and of it self in spiri^uall things; but if every motion of body and
soul be from the Lord, and we are not able to move any facul^y of the one, or
part of the other, but as we are helped and assisted by the Lord, then there
can be no freedom of w^ll, in the will it self, and by it self, in civil
good things; indeed, we willingly acknowledge a liberty of will, to will
spiritual good in the state of grace, after regenerat^on; yet not a liberty in
the will it self, but by the continual assisting grace of God, the will
truly changed and renewed, has freedom to will that which is good, yet not by
it self, but by the continual

A Minister of the word that knows holy things and has thought upon them must
entreat the Lord to enable him to utter them.
Now is it so, that God only does open the door of utterance* and that a man
having never so much knowledge cannot utter it unless God open his mouth.

Surely then, the Minister of the word must not rest in his knowledge and
meditation, but he must humbly crave it of the Lord, that he may be able to
utter the holy things he has thought upon.

And here (by the way to touch it) if the Minister of the word cannot utter
the holy things he has studied and thought upon; unless the Lord give him
utterance, how then is it possible, that one being not a Minister, nor ever
called on to that office should be able to utter them? A Minister of the word
being not able to utter the holy things he has studied and thought up on,
unless God give him utterance, much less can others that are no Ministers be
able to do it.
How can one that comes from a manuary trade to Preach (as it is sometimes
among Brownists.) How (I pray you) can such a man think, that he shall be
able to utter holy things, and to speak as a Minister in a Congregation, or in
a meeting of Christians.

Object: The Lord can enable him so to speak,

I grant it, that is without question, the Lord can, but whether he will or no,
thereof I make some doubt, and I have reason for it, because indeed, such an
one does thrust himself into an office to which he is not called, and therefore
cannot pray to the Lord to open to him the door of utterance, to speak as a
Minister with any assurance te be heard.

Admit this,

What then, is he therefore rightly called to that office? Canaan, we must know
that the date of extraordinary calling is expired, and therefore such a man as
comes suddenly from a manuary trade to preach the word, cannot look that the
LORD should open to him the door of utterance to publish the secrets of the
Gospel. No, no, a Minister of the Gospel, lawfully called, and fitted for
that office, must crave it at the Lords hands, that he may be able to utter
the secrets of the Gospel. Prou. 16 1. The preparations of the heart are in
man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. The meaning is, that a man
may have, as it were, whole armies of thoughts in his mind, and those by long
meditation orderly disposed, yet the uttermost of his mind is, as God shall
open his mouth, he cannot utter aright any part of that matter he has thought
on, unless the Lord give him the gift of utterance, and at his hands it must
be thought for.

Ability and liberty of speech to the minister of the Gospel, must be sought
for at the hands of the Lord.
by earnest and hearty prayer, who only it is, that must give it, and withal
it behooues us to take heed we provoke not the Lord to shut up that door^ of
utterance: for as it is, Revel. 3 7. If he open none can shut, and if he shut
none can open. Now we by our sins provoke the Lord to lock up the door of
utterance, even to take away, either ability or liberty of speech from his
Ministers, when men walk not worthy the Gospel, Phil. 1.27. They justly
provoke the Lord, either to send foolish teachers, or to stop the mouths of
such as are wise and able to divide the word of God aright, and not to suffer
them to speak any more in his name to them. If the Minister have the door of
utterance, Note.
and have his mouth opened to tell thee of thy sins, and the danger of them,
and thou have not a door of vterance, thou will not suffer the word to enter
into thine heart and to work in thee a reformation, but thou do still
please thy self in thy sins, and in following the lusts of thine own heart.
What do thou? surely provoke the Lord either by death, or some other way to
silence the Minister, and to stop his mouth: therefore consider it, and if we
desire ability and liberty of speech, to the Ministers of the Gospel: let us
heartily and earnestly, sue for it at the Lords hands, let us take heed, we
provoke him not by our sins to take away these things from them: if we
humbly seek for it, that the Lord would open the door of utterance to his
Ministers; and if we open our own hearts, and suffer the word of GOD to enter
into them, then (doubtless) where the door is opened, the LORD will open it
wyder, and hold it open, maugre the malice of the Devil and all the power of
Hell.

Note we one thing further; Paul (noe doubt) had the door of utterance opened
to him; he had abillitie, and some liberty to utter the secrets of the
Gospel, though he was a prisoner, as appears Act. 28.31. and yet here he
desires the Colossians to pray, that God would open unto him the door of
utterance: hence we may gather.

That a man that has the gift of utterance ought, not He that has the gift of
utterance, ought to pray and to entreat others to pray for the continuance and
increase o^ that gift.
that the LORD would continnue it to him and more and more increase it.

If a man have his house full of food, and provision laid up for a whole
year, yea for many years, yet he must still pray: give us this day our daily
bread; and still pray that the Lord would give him the use of those things, and
give them power and strength to do him good. So if a man be strong to
follow his labor, and be never so able to do the works of his calling;
yet he must still crave strength and assistance from the Lord, that the LORD
would bless his strength and give him the right use of it, and continue it to
him.

Reproof of those who rush upon the works of their callings presuming on their
own strength.
the Lord therefore does sometimes blow upon their strength and suddenly turns
it to weakness.

Having now handled the matter which the Apostle entreated the Colossians to
pray for, in the behalf of himself and Timothy, come we to the end and
purpose for which he desired that ability and liberty might be given them in
these words (to speak the mist ry of Christ) the Apostle desired that the door
of utterance might be opened to him and Timothy, for the publishing and
preaching of the Gospel, the excellency whereof he sets out by two arguments.

First, by the high and heavenly matter of it containing in it heavenly
mysteries of Christ, and

Secondly, by the worth of it in respect of the greatest affliction, that it is
a doctrine so excellent, as it is worth the suffering for, to the loss of
liberty; yea and life too, if the professors of it be thereunto called, and the
Apostle says that he for the professing and preaching of the Gospel, doubted
not to expose himself to trouble, and to be bound with chains as an evil
doer, and so by his own suffering for it, he proves the excellency of it, in
these words (wherefore I am also in bonds.)

Interpretation.
Let us first clear the words touching the sense and meaning of them (to speak)
that is, to publish, declare; and by speech to make known (the mystery of
Christ) that is, the doctrine of the Gospel, for so the Apostle calls it,
Ephesians 6.19. The secret of the Gospel. Now the Gospel i^ called the
mystery of Christ because Christ is the subsubiect matter of it, and he is
the very substance of the Gospel, the Gospel containing in it the doctrine of
Christ his incarnation and offices, his humiliation, his exa^tation, his
humanity, his divinity, his office of mediation, and all things concerning the
life and death of Christ.

And again:

The Gospel is called a mystery, because it is wonderful deep, secret and
unsearchable, such an excellent, and withal, such an hidden thing, as the
understanding and knowledge of it cannot be attained by any wit of man, no nor
of Angels, who are therefore said to stoop down to look into the marvelous
work of redemption, and the secrets of the Gospel, 1. Pet. 1.12. (Wherefore I
am also in bonds) these words have no difficulty in them, the meaning of them
is briefly this, for which excellent doctrine of the Gospel I also suffer
restraint of my liberty, and am imprisoned and bound in prison.

In the first place observe we here that our Apostle desired ability and
liberty of utterance to be given to him and Timethie, for this end and
purpose, that they might publish and declare, and by speaking make known the
doctrine of the Gospel, they desired not that gift for their own praise, that
they might seem learned, (for without the gift of utterance, a man's learning
lies hid as a Jewel in a dark place) or for their own profitte, that they
might be more liberally rewarded by the Church, but that they might by speech
utter forth, and declare the secrets of the Gospel, here then just occasion
is given to show that the gift of utterance bestowed on a Minister of the
Gospel both ought to be used, and not to be as a talent hid and wrapped up
in a napkin, and that it ought to be used to a right end, not to his own
praise, nor his own profit, but to the publishing of the secrets of the
Gospel, so as may be most for the glory of God, and the good of his people,
but on these things I will not stand, let it suffice only to have named them.

In that the Apostle desires the gift of speech to speak the mystery of
Christ, and by speech to make known the doctrine of the Gospel.

Verbum vocale, (as it is called) a publishing, a making known of the doctrine
of the word by the voice of man, The preaching of the word, by the tongue and
voice of man, thereunto called, is a thing lawful and necessary.
is warranted, it is a thing that may and ought to be used, yea, it is a
matter of necessity, it is needful, that the doctrine of the word be made
known by the speech of man as may easily be proved.

For as the Apostle says, Romans 1.10. the Gospel is the

How shall they believe without a Preacher, for the working of faith the
Gospel must be heard, and not only heard by the bare repetition of the
sentence of it, but heard preached (that is) the secret mysteries of it opened,
and applied by the voice and speech of man called to that office.



First this crosses the foolish conceit of the Anabaptists and familists who
hold that the public ministry and The opinion of Anabaptists and Familists
who deny the teaching of the word by the ministry of man, overthrown.
they allege for defense of their opinion that of Iere. 31.34. where the
Prophet foretells that in the time of the Gospel, under the new Testament, men
should no more teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying,
know the Lord, but they should all know him from the least of them unto the
greatest of them.

Therefore (say they) teaching now by the voice of man

Answer, the Prophets meaning is,

Oh but says the Familist, John 1. Ioh. 2.27. has showed it to be needless
to be taught by the voice of man. The anointing (says he) (that is) the
Spirit which ye have received of him dwells in you, and ye need not that any
man teach you.

Again, the meaning of Saint John is, known by the speech of man called to
speak, and that by utterance and speech it be opened and applied to the
hearers for their instruction and comfort.

We are to esteem the preaching of the word by the voice of man called to
that office, not a thing needless or arbitrary, but an holy ordinance of God
by the voice and tongue of man, called to that office.

Let us not think and esteem it as a needelesse thing, or a matter
arbitrarie, left to our choice to hear, or not to hear at our pleasure, it is
most needful for the working of saving knowledge and faith, and learn thou
to account it as the ordinance of God to that purpose, and if thou know not GOD
as he has made himself known in his Word, thou know him not to thy
comfort.

Now thou can not know GOD, as he is revealed in his word ordinarily, but by
his word opened and applied by the speech of man called to that office, and
therefore be not thou either so unthankful to God for his mercy in
appointing man like to thy self, to teach thee, or so injurious to thy self,
as lightly to regard the word spoken to thee, by the ministry of man.

Now this is a thing whereof the Ministers of the word, have just cause to
complain in this decrepit and wicked age of the world, some think they know
as much as he that speaks can tell them, and men now (for the most part) if
they come to hear the word preached, make small reckoning of the doctrine of
the word, made known to them by the speech of man called to that office,
especially of the doctrine of the Law, if their sins be discovered, and the
danger wherein they are by reason of their sins, and the judgments due to
their sinne^ be denounced against them, they think those are but the words
of men, the words of their Preachers, and no such thing shall come unto them,
and they bless themselves in their own hearts, and still go on in their
sin.

Now then seeing the speaking of the word is so lightly regarded, and vocal
speaking does so little good, we may justly look, that the Lord should cause
that to cease, and now come amongst us with real sermons, even his plagues and
judgments, the heavens seem to threaten judgment that they shall be as
brass, and the earth as iron.

Let us therefore be warned in time, whilst the word is yet sounding in our
ears, by the voice of man, to make more account of it, let us esteem and
reverence the speaking of the word by the ministry of man, as the ordinance of
God, and make conscience of yielding obedience unto it, least the Lord seeing
our light regard of that soft and familiar voice of man, he take that from us,
and send out his fearful thundering voice of judgment, that seeing we
refuse to yield our selves flexible to the one, we may be broken and
crushed, and shattered in pceccs by the other.

In the next place, let it be observed that the doctrine of the Gospel
containing the doctrine of Christ his incarnation and offices, his life and
death, is here called the ministry of Christ, a doctrine deep and secret,
far above the reach of man's wit and understanding, the consideration of
this does offer unto us this conclusion.

That it is no easy mattet truly to understand, know It is no easy matter
truly to understand and believe the doctrine of the Gospel.
a man cannot easily come to have knowledge, and faith in the secrets of the
Gospel, in the doctrine of Christ his incarnation; his office of mediation,
his two natures, personal union of them, and other things needful to be
known and believed.

And hence it is that the Apostle says, 1. Timoth. 3.16. without controversy,
the doctrine of godliness, that is, the Gospel containing matter of Christ
his person and offices, that doctrine is not only a mystery, but a great
mystery, and an exceeding profoundnesse and depth, and that without all
question or controversy, the word signifies by all men's confession, that is
an axiom or truth, held and confessed of all, that the doctrine touching
Christ his person and offices, is not easily conceived, no not by the best
natural wits, it were easy to give instance in particulars, 1. Corinthians. 1.23.
We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the
Grecians foolishness (says the Apostle) Act. 17.15. The Athenians, the wisest
of the Heathen, and the wisest among the Philosophers, when Paul preached to
them Jesus, and the resurrection, they said he was a babbler, a trifler or
setter forth of strange gods.

The reason

There is no feed of the doctrine of Christ in nature, the moral Law was
written in nature before the fall, and since there is some remnants of it in
us, Romans 2.15. the Gentiles show the effect of the Law written in their hearts
their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing one
another or excusing.

But the doctrine of Jesus Christ incarnate, the mediator of the new
testament, is above the reach of nature created, much more of nature corrupted.

And therefore it is no easy matter truly to know and A sl^nder t^rowen upon
our Church by the Papists removed.
They say we teach an easy way to salvation, in that we say to men according
to the doctrine of the Gospel, repent and believe in Christ, and thou shall be
saved, behold (says the Papist) an easy way to be saved; is it so? can it be
an easy thing for a man by faith to appre- Christ and his merittes, and to
apply them to himself to his comfort, and yet be an hard matter for a man,
truly to know, understand and believe the doctrine of Christ? can one of these
be hard and the other easy, it is not possible, and therefore it is a mere
slander cast upon us by the Papists that we teach an easy way to salvation,
rather (indeed) they teach an easy way to salvation by implicit faith.

But let us further think on the doctrine delivered to this purpose, is it so,
that it is no easy matter to know and believe the doctrine of Christ because
there is no seed of it in nature?

Then deceive not thy self, think not that thou do A faith easily has^ is
no true faith, and herein many deceive themselves.
when thou have only such a faith as may be easily had, a faith conceived
without any hardness, a faith conceived only by tradition which (indeed) is the
faith of the greatest number in the world, they having been borne and bred,
and brought up in the bosom of the Church, and having heard it delivered in
the Church, that Jesus Christ came into the world, took our nature upon him,
and in that nature suffered death upon the cross, and gave himself a ransom
for all men: thereupon they conceive in mind a motion, and a bare conceit,
that Christ is their Savior, and they can repeat all the Articles of the
Creed, and presently (as they imagine) steadfastly believe them, never finding
any hardness, or any unbelief in their hearts, in respect of ane one article.
If thy faith in Christ be such a faith, it is no true faith. If thou never yet
felt the mighty and powerful word of God, or the working of his mighty power
as the Apostle speaks Ephesians 1.19. Working in thee understanding and faith
in the Gospel, and in the doctrine of Christ, certainly thou have no true
faith but a fancy.

The doctrine of CHRIST his incarnation and Offices, is a doctrine full of
great mysteries which cannot be comprehended without much hardness, and
striving against natural unbelief, and know for a truth, that thou do
never believe the Gospel to thy comfort, till thou can say, with a true
feeling of thine own weakenenesse, and want of faith, as he said in the
Gospel, Lord I believe, Lord help mine unbelief. A faith easily conceived
without feeling any hardness and struggling against unbelief, is but a loose
imagination, in time of trial, either temptation, or great affliction, that
faith will fail thee, it is a faith of nature, and reason, and not of the
Spirit, and when nature and reason fail that cannot stand.

Therefore deceive not thy self, never rest till thou find in thee a faith
conceived, by the use of the means, hearing of the word preached, meditation,
prayer, and such like, and wrought in thee by a supernatural power,
ouermastring thy natural hardness, and unbelief, thou maie^t be sure, that
a faith so wrought, is a faith of Gods Spirit, and that faith will never fail,
the gates of hell shall never prevail against it.

Whence it is that men of excellent wits and greatest learning do
notwithstanding err in the doctrine of Christ his incarnation and offices.
and are not able rightly to conceive them, and they are as a sealed Book unto
them, Isai. 29.11. Even from hence, these things are deep mysteries, the true
knowledge of them cannot be reached by the best wit in the world, it is only
the Spirit of God, that must open, and reveal them; and if the Lord have
vouchsafed that mercy to thee, and given thee a true understanding of them,
thou being a simple poor man or woman; Oh bless his name for that great
mercy, he has vouchsafed that to thee, which he has denied to thousands
besides, as good as thou by nature; yea, to many living under the same means
with thee, therefore thou have great cause to bless God for his mercy, and to
say with Christ, Matthew. 11.25. I thank thee oh Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and men of
understanding, and have opened them unto babes, to me a poor silly creature,
and simple man, or woman; yea, let thy heart, tongue and life, express and set
forth the great mercy of God toward thee in that respect.

Come we to the matter of doctrine offered from the second argument, here
setting out the excellency of the Gospel (namely) the Apostles suffering for
it, expressed in the last words of this verse (wherefore or for which I am
also in bonds.)

Now in that the Apostle says that the doctrine of the Gospel is not only a
doctrine full of high and hidden mysteries, and in that respect an excellent
doctrine, but that for it also he refused not to suffer imprisonment, and loss
of his liberty, and in that regard also a doctrine of great excellency and
dignity we may e^sily conceive.

That the sufferings of such as profess the Gospel, The excellency of the
gospel appears clearly through the sufferings of such as truly profess it.
be they Ministers, or others, the afflictions that are thrown upon true
professors of the Gospel, for the profession, of it, are so far from being
an argument against the worthiness of the doctrine of the Gospel, as that
they much clear, and strongly prove the excellency of the same, even through
the sufferings of the true professors of the Gospel, does the excellency of
the same appear,

For why? Therein appear plainly, the power, we may safely say that the
sufferings of such as profess the Gospel, even their suffering for the
Gospels sake, do much clear and manifest the excellency of the gospel, and
show forth the glory of it, and tend much to the advancement of it. The
Apostle affirms it plainly, Philip. 1.12. That the things he suffered for
the Gospel, his afflictions, his bonds, had turned rather to the confirmation
and advancement of the Gospel, then otherwise.

That which the deu^ll thinks will be a means to disgrace the Gospel the
Lord tu^nes to be a means to bring glory to it.
The Gospel being most repugnant to the tyranny of Satan, the manners of the
wicked world, and the corruption of our sinful flesh, the Devil and his
instruments bestirre themselves against it, and pursue the professors of it,
with many indignities and much hard measure, thinking thereby to make the
Gospel it self odious, and to bring the profession of it into contempt and
disgrace; but altogether in vain, the more they labor by afflicting the
professors of the Gospel, to disgrace the Gospel and the profession of it, the
more do they clear the excellency and glory, both of the Gospel, and of the
true profession of it, and such as have their eyes opened by the Spirit of God,
are able even through the afflictions of the professors of the Gospel, to see
and discern that excellency and glory; indeed carnal, and worldly minded
men, see no manner of beauty nor glory at all in the Gospel, and the
profession of it, being under many sufferings, they hold the sincere profession
of the Gospel base, and contemptible, and why so? Because as it is Act. 28.22.
that ways every where spoken against, because it lies under many nicknames,
and reproachful terms, but if thine eyes be opened by the spirit of God,
thou see even through those reproaches and disgraceful terms, a glorious Men
look not upon the true profession of the Gospel with a right eye till they see
the beauty of it through many and great afflictions.
and thou do not look on the true profession of the Gosspell with a right
eye, with an eye opened and cleared by the Spirit of God, till thou see the
beauty and glory of it, lying under many and great afflctions and sufferings,
the more the world seeks to disgrace the Gospel, and the true professors of
it, the more the glory of it appears, the brighter it shines, and if thou see
it not, thou look on it with a carnal eye, and there is no more comfort of
the Gospel belonging to thee, then to one that is carnal, and therefore if
thou would find the comfort that belongs to a true professor of the Gospel,
never rest till thou be able to see, and discern the excellency, and glory of
the Gospel, and the sincere profession of it, manifested, and made clear by
the suffering of true professors, yea never rest till thou be, not only, not
discouraged, but as the Apostle said of some in his time, Phil. 1.14 more
emboldned and heartned to go on in a constant profession of the Gospel, by the
sufferings of others for the same. Let not the indignities and reproaches
thrown on the true professors of the Gospel make thee more out of heart, and
more out of love with the profession of the Gospel, if they do, thy heart is
not right within thee.

In the next place observe we that the Apostle making mention of his
sufferings, and in particular, of his imprisonment, he specifieth the cause of
it, he tells the Colossians, he was in prison and bonds, and that not for any
misdemeanor, for any crime committed, by him deserving bonds, but for the
heavenly doctrine of the Gospel, that his professing and preaching the
Gospel, was the cause wherefore he was imprisoned, and that for it he was in
bonds.

Whence we are taught thus much.

That of the same kind of calamities, and sufferings ^ha^ befall the godly,
and the ungodly, of the same kind of suffering, that befall the children of
God, and the wicked.

Though the godly and the wicked many times suffer the same things, yet the
c^uses for which they suffer, are much different.
the wicked they are punished for their wickedness, and for their offenses,
but the godly, they are pressed by the wicked with many vexations, even for
their piety and religion, and so though they suffer the same things, yet not
for the same cause. We may see it in many examples, Genesis 39.20. We read that
Joseph was imprisoned in the place where the Kings prisoners lay bound, and in
the 40. Chapter verse 3. We find also that Pharaohs two officers his chief
Butler, and his Baker were cast into the same prison where Joseph was, and so
both Joseph and they suffered the same imprisonment, but the causes of their
imprisonment were much different one from the other; Joseph he was put in
prison at the false and slanderous accusation of his mistress, indeed the
true cause was his refusal to commit folly with her, and to sin against God.
But Pharaohs Officers were committed for their offenses against their Lord and
King, and justly for their deserts. We have example of this also in Christ and
the two thieves that were crucified with him, both Christ and they were in the
same condemnation, as one of the thieves said, Luke 23.40. (that is) in the
same judgment, they suffered the same punishment, yet how different the cause
of their suffering was, from the cause of Christ, we know well, and one of the
thieves did acknowledge it, verse 41. We are (indeed) says he, righteously
here, but this man has done nothing amiss.

This then is manifest that howsoever the godly and wicked be under the same
troubles, the same pressures, and vexations, the godly are imprisoned and so
are the wicked, yet not for the same cause, the godly they suffer unjustly, and
for a good cause, the wicked they suffer justly, and for their evil doing.

And this serves.

First, to justify and clear that common received sentence.

Not the punishment, but the cause is that which makes the Martyr. That
sentence justified, that not the punishment but the cause makes the Martyr.
He that suffers the same torments, and the same tortures that holy Martyrs
do, is not therefore a Martyr; no, no, it is the cause for which a man suffers
that makes him a Martyr.

A man may suffer some things that holy men of God do, and yet be a wicked
man, and suffer for his evil doing, and this is the very case of Popish
Martyrs. The case of popish Martyrs.
The Papists, they canonize some for Saints, and register them for Martyrs, who
have suffered death for no less then monstrous treason against their Prince.

Oh, (Catholics) suffer imprisonment and death too, for their conscience, and
for religion, and what say you to them? Are not they holy men and Martyrs?

Surely no,

Now this they are never able to do, their persecuted Catholics (as they call
them) suffer for superstition, and Antichristian heresy, and therefore cannot
be truly held as holy men and martyrs.

But for the use of this point to our selves, I^ is rash judgment to condem men
for troublesome persons, only because they suffer never examining the cause of
their suffering.
is it so that howsoever the godly and the wicked, both lie under the same
trouble, and the same suffering; yet if for different causes: the one for
sin, the other for pyetie and religion, and for a good cause. Surely, then it
must needs be weak and rash judgment, by and by to censure and condemn them
for troublesome persons that suffer, never examining the cause for which they
suffer: that cannot choose but be headdy and untimely judgment, and we must
take heed of it. And this must further teach every one of us, if we suffer
any thing at the hands of men, to look to the cause of our suffering; in thy
suffering, look that the cause it be good, and not evil, as Peter has
exhorted. 1 Pet. 4.15. Let none of you suffer as an evil doer: stand not thou
on thy suffering, a wicked man may suffer the same, If we suffer any thing at
the hands of men, we must look to the cause of our suffeing, that we suffer for
well-doing.
some men being justly smytten with the tongue of others, and hardly spoken of
and that justly, they lying under an hard censure, and yet just; for their
pride, their covetousness, their uncleanness, their faithless dealings in
couenantes, their defrauding, their circumuenting, and goeing beyond others in
barganing, and the like. What do they? and how do they commonly shift off the
matter? oh (say they) men speak ill of me; but say all what they will, or can,
I care not for it, better men then I have been ill spoken off: Christ himself
had scarce a good word, when he was here on the earth: it is true indeed, good
men, and Christ, have been ill spoken off. But did Christ, and good men
deserve it? did they ever provoke others to it by their ill deeds? thou will
say noe. Why then, do thou not see what a deceiving argument thou use?
Good men and Christ, have suffered in this kind: the hauey been ill spoken
off, I now suffer hard and ill speeches, and therefore I pass not for them,
why? but thou thy self know, Christ and good men deserved not to be ill
spoken off; they have been ill spoken off unjustly for well-doing, but thou
justly, for ill-doing, will thou then shroud thy self under the example of
Christ, and of good men, in regard of thy suffering? Thou deceiuest thy self,
if thou be ill spoken of, and thine own conscience tell thee thou deseruest
it, think not to shift off the matter, and to find comfort in saying Christ,
and good men, have been ill spoken of, no, no, though they that speak ill of
thee, and revile thee, sin in so doing: yet there is no comfort in thy
suffering. Indeed if thou be ill spoken of unjustly, or for a good cause;
there is comfort in that suffering: some say some times, oh, if I had deserved
such hard speeches, it would never grieve me. Thou speak foolishly, if thou
had deserved them, then were there just cause of grief: but not deserving
them, there is noe cause of grief at all, but rather of comfort, and
rejoyceing, and therefore in thy suffering in this or any other kind, ever
look thou to the cause of thy suffering: if thou suffer justly, then be
humbled and repent of thy sin, other wise the Lord will charge it more fully
upon thee, at the last day: if unjustly, or for a good cause, with meekenes,
and patience, possess thy soul, and rejoice, in that thou art partaker of
Christ his sufferinges. 1. Peter. 4.13. And if thou be rayled on for pyetie,
and for religion (as he says) Verse 14. there is a blessinge belonging to
thee, and through thy sides they strike the spirit of glory.

Observe yet further, in that the Apostle was imprisoned for the Gospel, we
are playnelie taught.

That for the Gospels sake, and for the true profession We must be ready to
suffer loss of liberty and of life also, if we be called unto it, for the true
profession of the Gospel.
Luke. 14.20. says our Savior: if any man come to me, and hate not his
father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and
his own life also: that is incomparison of me, and of my Gospel; he cannot
be my disciple. Therefore in the preparation of our hearts, we must ever be
ready to suffer any torture, or torment for the Gospels sake, if the Lord
vouchsafe us that honor, and we be thereunto called.

Now then is this a truth? ought true professors of the Gospel to be ready to
lay down their lives for the truth of the Gospel, The failings of men in this
particular duty discovered.
how know you that may some say? surely it is easily known, and I can easily
make it plain, are not many in the world, so wedded to the sensual pleasures
and profits in the world, as they will not forsake them, for the keeping of
faith and a good conscience, they will not forsake any sensual pleasure, or
any unlawful gain that comes in, for the keeping of faith and a good
conscience, and can we then think that such persons are prepared to forsake
wife, children, house and land, and to suffer the loss of their lives by fire
or sword if time of trial should come for the Gospels sake? no, no, there is
no such matter, if the Gospel have not been powerful in thee, and wrought in
thee a denial of ungodliness and worldly lusts, certainly thou art not
prepared to lay down thy life for it, therefore deceive not thy self, thou
must be prepared to suffer imprisonment, and loss of liberty for the Gospels
sake, if time of trial come unto thee, and how soon it may come thou know
not, and if it come, and thou be not then prepared, a thousand to one (without
the extraordinary mercy of God) thou will shrink from Christ, and from the
truth of his Gospel, and then woe be to thee, Christ will deny thee, and be
ashamed of thee, when he shall come in his glory, Luke 9.26. therefore never
rest till thou be prepared to lay down thy life for the Gospels sake, and to
that end, never rest till the Gospel have wrought powerfully in thee, a
denial of ungodliness and worldly lusts, and taught thee to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world, Tit. 2.12. and then (doubtless)
thou art prepared to suffer any thing that shall be laid upon thee for the
Gospels sake, and if the time of trial come upon thee, thou shall be able
(through Gods grace assisting thee) to seal thy profession of the Gospel with
thy dearest blood.

VER. 4. That I may utter it, as it becomes me to speak.
In this verse the Apostle requires the prayers of the Colossians for himself,
more particularly, that they would lift up their prayers to God for him more
specially, that he being now in prison, and suffering for the Gospel, might
with boldness, and all corrupt fear set apart, be able to utter forth the
secrets of the Gospel (that I may utter) and withal, he sets down in what
manner he desired that he might utter it, namely, in such manner as was meet
and fit for him to speak.

That I may utter it the word (it) has relation to that which went before
(namely) the mystery of the doctrine of the Gospel, Interpretation.
and the word here rendered (utter) signifies to manifest, and to make plain,
and clear, that I may discover and lay open the secrets of it, that I may make
manifest, plain and clear, that deep and hidden doctrine of the Gospel as
it becomes me to speak, or as I ought to speak, for so the words are
translated, Ephesians. 6.20. which words are not to be taken as some have taught as
a reason of that which goes before drawn from the necessity of duty, as if
the Apostles meaning were that I may utter the doctrine of the Gospel, because
I ought to speak it, and because I am bound by necessity of duty: but as
expressing the manner, in what manner, he desired that he might utter it, as if
he had said; that I may utter it in such manner as I ought, and as it
becomes me, and this Decorum and manner of speaking must be understood as
having a double relation, both to the excellency of the doctrine of the Gospel
it self, and to the office and calling of the Apostle.

The Apostle here meant such a manner of speaking as was meet and fit, both in
regard of the excellency of the Gospel, and of that trust or Apostleship that
was reposed in him, thus then we are to conceive the words of this verse, as
if the Apostle had said.

I entreat you to pray for me more specially being a prisoner, that I may be
able by speech to manifest and make plain that deep and hidden doctrine of
the Gospel, in such manner of speaking, as is meet and fit, both in regard of
the excellency of the Gospel it self, and of that trust of Apostleshippe
that is reposed in me. Now here it is not to be passed by without observation,
that the Apostle entreated the prayers of the Colossians for himself more
specially, that he being now in trouble for the Gospel, in prison and in
bonds, for the preaching of it, they would he mindful of him, and recommend
him to God in their prayers, especially and above others, that now in time of
his trial he might be strengthened, and not shrink back for fear, nor by
any sinister and corrupt affection, be diuerted, and turned aside from a sound
and sincere utterance and manifestation of the truth of the Gospel, but that
he might utter it, and deliver it as it ought to be delivered; Hence we may
note briefly.

That howsoever we are to recommend all, both Ministers and other professors of
the Gospel to God by prayer, yet especially those that are in trouble, those
that suffer imprisonment We are especially to remember in our prayers, those
that suffer for the truth of the Gospel.
we are to remember them in our prayers especially, yea as the Apostle says,
Romans 15.30. to strive and to be most ea^nest and instant in prayer to God for
them: and there is great reason for it.

Because indeed in time of suffering, and trial, the Devil will be most
busy, both by inward suggestions, How we are to practice this duty.
the truth of the Gospel maintained without impeachment, and their own souls
comforted: and on the former ground, such as are in trouble must learn not to
be secure, Men that are in trouble must not be secure, but must be earnest with
God themselves and entreat others also to pray for them that they may be
strengthened.
in time of trial upon confidence of their own gifts. Admit a man's gifts were
not inferior to the holy Apostle Paul; yet such a man being in trouble for the
Gospels sake, ought in fear and humillity to call on God for strength, and to
entreat others likewise, to do the same, in his behalf: but let it suffice to
have poynted at these things offered to us from the circumstance of the person
of the Apostle, his and condition at that time being a prisoner. Now touching
the matter of this verse, we are in the next place to mark, that the Apostle
does here desire to be helped by the prayers of the Colossians, that they
would pray for him in particular, that he might utter forth and make manifest
the mystery of Christ. He here changes the term, in the verse before he
used the word (speak) but here he says, that I may utter it, that I may
manifest and make plain. Whence we are given to understand thu^ much.

That the speaking of the mystery of Christ, the preaching There ought to be a
perspicuity and plainen^sse in the preachin^ of the word.
yea, the word ought to be delivered in such evidence and plainness, as the
meanest capacity may be able to conceive and to understand it, and as if
Jesus Christ crucified, were pictured and painted out before the eyes of men,
as the Apostle said by way of reproof to the Galathians, Gal. 3.1. O foolish
Galathians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, to whom
Jesus Christ before was described in your sight, and among you crucified, as if
he had said, to whom have I preached the doctrine of the Gospel in such
evidence and plainness, as if Christ had been painted out before your eyes,
and had been crucified among you, and you had seen his blood distilling from
his hands and side.

And hence it is:

That our Apostle calle^ his preaching of the Gospel, a declaration, or a
manifestation of the truth, for so the word signifies, 2 Cor. 4.2. in
declaration of the truth, we approve our selves to every man's conscience in
the ^ight of God.

The reason of this truth is plain, namely this.

in him to their comfort and salvation.

Now this cannot be effected, this end cannot be attained unless men rightly
conceive and understand the doctrine of Christ, therefore it must be delivered
in such evidence and plainness as they may conceive and understand it.

That manner of preaching therefore cannot be justified, that is full of
obscurity, Preaching that is full of obscu^ity, and above the understanding o^
the hearers cannot be iuiustified.
wherein there is a mixture of speech, and intermingling of Latin and Greek
with Eng^ish, before hearers that are unlearned, and howsoever some in way of
defense of it, say, that kind of preaching is learned, indeed and truth, there
is no such matter, only that teacher shows learning, that shows men Christ,
he is the learned preacher that is able rightly to unfold the mystery of
Christ, and to manifest the secrets of the Gospel, and so to paint out Christ
before the people, as they may (as it were) see him crucified and glorified,
and that life that flows out of his blood, and the comforts that are treasured
up in him;

And again must the doctrine of the Gospel be delivered We must not except
against the doctrine of the word because it is delivered in plain, easy and
familiar terms.
and yet many there be in the world that have no great liking of the truth of
the doctrine del^uered, even because it is tendered unto them, in a familiar
plainness and simplicity; they have itch^ng ears. 2. Tim. 4 3. they delight
to hear things delivered in more lofty and glorious terms, surely such
persons show the vanity and weakness of their understanding, and the
unsoundness of their judgments. Why should thou except against or dislike
the truth delivered in plain and easy terms? art thou offended with the
Lord, for dealing plainly with thee? whence comes that exception and dislike?
consider thou whence it comes, and thou shall find it comes from thine own
corruption, helped forward by strong delusion of the enemy of thy salvation,
for thou exceptest against that which may be most for thy good, and likest
that which many times turns to thy hurt, the Lord (justly punishing the vanity
of thy mind, and the pride of thine heart) suffers thee to suck in poison and
dangerous errors, lying hid under lofty and goodly words, which thou
understand not, and therefore take thou heed of excepting against the
doctrine delivered in plainness of words, if thou hear the truth of the word
plainly deliuerd, be so far from excepting against it, as even therefore bless
God for his mercy, that vouchsafes to discover to thee the truth of his word so
familiarly remembering that speech of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14.22. strange tongs
are for a sign, even a iudegement and punishment sent of God to them that
believe not, therefore take heed thou neither except against, nor dislike of
the doctrine of the word, for the plainness of it, the plainer and the more
familiarly the word is delivered to thee in the public ministry, the greater
token and sign is it of Gods loving kindness and favor toward thee, and yet
know we, that this perspicuity and plainness in preaching The Minister of the
word must lay open the doctrine of the word, in such manner as is suitable both
to the excellency of the matter, and to the dignity also of his ^wne calling.
as it becomes me to speak. And so the next point of doctrine laid down in
this verse is this.

The Ministers care and study must be, not only in plain and familiar terms to
declare and speak the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but also so to speak it, as it
ought to be declared; the Minister must not only have care to manifest, and to
lay open the doctrine of the word, but he must look also that he do it in such
manner as is meet, both according to the excellency of the matter, and dignity
of his own calling, and that trust that is reposed in him, 1. Pet. 4.11. if any
man speak (says the Apostle) that is, in the public Ministry of the word,
let him speak, not only the words of God, but as the words of God, as it
becomes him to speak, such words, we find that the Minister of the Gospel is
graced with many excellent titles, he is called the messenger and ambassador
of Christ, he is styled with the name of Angel, Revel. 2. and Cap. 3. He is
said to be the Lords Steward put in trust by him, 1. Cor. 4.1. all which teach
him that he must deliver the message of his Lord and Master, with due regard of
the dignity of his message, and answerable to that trust that is reposed in
him. 2. particulars required in the right handling of the word of God.


Not to stand on the general: the particulars of this duty, are many, but
especially these two.

First, the Minister must look, that he utter forth and declare the doctine
of the word purely, and powerfully;

Secondly, it must also be delivered as the Apostle says, Cor. 2.4. In plain
evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, (that is) in such sort as sin may
thereby be rebuked, the conscience rifled, and judged, and the secret
corruption of the heart made manifest, and that it may be a means) by Gods
blessing upon it) to instill the grace of faith, and repentance, and holy
obedience into the hearts of the hearers, yea the word must be delivered with
such evidence of the spirit, as the hearers may discern the power, the
presence, and the majesty of God in the preaching of it, and be forced to say
in plain terms without question God is in the Preacher, 1 Cor. 14 25. that is
the right manner of handling the word of God, when the preachers of it show not
words but power, as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 4.20.

Now this doctrine might be applied to reprove sundry sorts of teachers,
Sundry sorts of teachers, briefly taxed.
as (namely) such as deliver the word of God in the intising words of man's
wisdom, spiritual things in a carnal manner.

Secondly, such as mingle the word with their own, and other men's devises, to
make their doctrine have the more applause, then which, what can be more
unworthy? as the Lord says by his Prophet Ier. 23.28. What is chafe to the
wheat?

Thirdly, such as for want of pains, or study, deliver the word, either in
terms unfit to teach, or persuade, or without order, and so not easy to be
learned, and remembered, and so without power, as it has no point to pearce the
hearts of the hearers, these, and many other, come within the compass of just
reproof by the doctine delivered.

But let us think on it to this purpose; Is it so that the Minister must not
only manifest the doctrine of the word, but he must deliver it purely, and
powerfully; yea, with such evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, as the
word spoken by him may judge the conscience, and search the secret corners of
the heart; and as the Holy Ghost says, Heb. 4.12. Enter through, even the
dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the ioints and the marrow,
and discover the thoughts of the heart, and be a means to work grace in the
hearers?

Cor. 2.16. Who is sufficient for these things? It is a very hard matter to
preach the word of God aright.
It is no easy matter to preach the word; Men think the Ministers of the
word of God speak whatsoever comes into their minds; it is not so, if they
speak the word as it ought to be spoken, no, no, Preaching of the word of God
requires great labor, study, meditation, and prayer, and the Minister must
not only be earnest in prayer himself, but after the example of the Apostle
in this place, he must request others to pray for him, that he may utter the
Doctrine of the Gospel as it becomes him to utter it; did Paul who was
guided by the Spirit of God, and had the infallible assistance of the Spirit
(being an Apostle) desire to be prayed for, that he might utter the doctrine
of the Gospel as it became him to speak?

How great cause then have we that are but ordinary Ministers to desire the
prayers of the Church, we are much more to crave the prayers of Gods people,
and they are to help us with their prayers; One says well, consider that it
is the easiest thing to hear, and it is the painefullest thing to preach the
Gospel* aright; therefore pray thou that the Minister may utter the doctrine of
the word, as it becomes him to speak, that he may deliver it in such
evidence, and plainness, and with a^l such purity and powerfulness, as it
ought to be delivered, and then doubtless, through Gods blessing upon it,
thou shall find it a means discovering the secret corruption of thine heart,
and working saving knowledge in thee. Yea, thou shall find the doctrine of the
word so delivered, or means confirming and strengthening grace in thee, and
making thee certain of Gods grace in Christ; yea, making thee rejoice in Gods
presence in this life, and at the day of judgment to stand before him with
joy, therefore be mindful of this duty.

VER. 5. Walk wisely toward them that are without, and redeem the time.
The Apostle in this verse proceeds to his second general exhortation,
wherein he exhorts the Colossians to carry themselves wisely toward them that
are without, and this he does generally in this verse, that they carry
themselves wisely in all things, and then that they carry themselves wisely in
one particular, (namely) in the wise usage of their speech, verse 6.

His general exhortation in this verse is first propounded.

Walk wisely toward them that are without. And then, more particularly
declared, how they may so do in the last words (namely) By redeeming the time.

(And redeem the time.) First therefore of the general exhortation, (Walk
wisely toward them that are without.)

Interpretation.
(Walk) That is, live, carry your selves in life and conversation, both in
your words and deeds; the word (Walk) is often so used in the Scripture.
(Wisely) or as the word is (in wisdom, or with wisdom) the meaning is, with
good discretion, with religious heed, and circumspection, as the Apostle
says, Ephesians. 5.15. Take heed that ye walk cicumspectly, not as fools, but
as wise.

Christian discretion, what it is.
Now Christian discretion, and an holy wariness is used in life and
conversation, when in every thing, said, or done, there is regard had of the
end of the speech, or action, that the word or deed, be to the glory of God,
and the good of others, and that it be without giving advantage of just
exception against it, or any just cause of offense; that is (indeed) true
Christian wisdom in life and conversation: (toward them) that is, among them,
or having any dealing with them (that are without) by those that are without,
we are to understand all unbelievers, all that are out of the Church, or
without Christ, as Ephesians. 2.12. Whether such as have not heard of Christ, as
Infidels and Pagans, or such as have heard the doctrine of the Gospel, and yet
have not received it, but still continue in their natural hardness, and
unbelief.

Thus then are we to conceive these words, Walk wisely toward them that are
without. As if the Apostle had said.

Carry your selves in life and conversation, both in your words, and deeds,
with Christian wiswisdome and discretion, with an holy wariness, and
circumspection, look that in every thing, said, or done by you, there be
regard had of a right end, even Gods glory, and the good of others, and let
your behavior be without just cause of exception, or offense to them that are
unbelievers, of what sort soever they be, you living among them, as necessity
requires, or having busin^sses and dealings with them. The duty here laid
before us, comes to be considered in the first place.

And it may thus be conceived.

That true believers, such as truly profess the Gospel, True believers must
be wise in their behavior and dealings with the wicked and unbelievers, and
take heed that they give them no just cause of exception or offense.
with wariness, and circumspection, even toward them that are without, in
their walking among the wicked, and unbelievers, and in their dealings with
them, they must have a wise regard of their behavior, they must look that
every thing, said, or done by them, be to Gods glory, and (if it be possible) a
means to work good upon the wicked, and that it be without just cause of
exception, and offense, I say, without just cause of exception, and offense;
for many times the wicked take exception against the holy religious and godly
behavior of true believers, and are offended at it, 1 Pet. 4.4. And as the
Prophet says, Hosea 14.10. The wicked stumble, and fall in the ways of God;
but that is offense taken, not given. True believers, and professors of the
Gospel must be wise in their behavior, and take heed they give not any just
cause of exception, or offense, and that not only to their weak brethren, but
even to the wicked and unbelieving. And hence it is, that the Apostle does
exhort us, Romans 12.17. To procure things honest in the sight of all men (that
is) words and deeds, not only lawful, and agreeable to the rule of honesty,
and goodness, and the will of God revealed in his word, but such also as give no
just offense to any, as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 10.32. Give none offense,
neither to the Jews, nor to the Grecians, nor to the Church of God: neither to
the Church, nor to those that are without the Church, 1 Thessalonians. 4.11.12. the
Apostle exhorted them of that Church, that they should study to be quiet, and
to meddle with their own business, and to work with their own hands; to
this end, that they might behave themselves honestly, (or as the word
signifies) decently toward them that are without, even in the sight of
unbelievers.

We see then there ought to be a Christian wisdom, a godly wariness, and
circumspection in such as are true believers, that in their behavior among the
wicked, they give them no just advantage, either to except against, or to be
offended with any thing, said, or done by them.

And the reason of this duty is this.

The life and behavior of true believers, ought to be a visible confutation
of the manners of the wicked, that when they look upon it, they may be
checked and reproved, thereby made to see how they ought to behave themselves,
and may glorify God in the day of the visitation, 1. Pet. 2.12. And therefore
it ought to be far from being like to the wicked life of unbelievers, in any
respect, that so it may give them no just cause of exception, and of stumbling
at it.

Many professors of the Gospel justly taxed for behauing themselves unwisely
in the sight of the wicked and profane
as the Apostle said to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6.7. There is utterly a fault
among you. There is in many professors of the Gospel too great a yielding to
their own corrupt affections, some that make profession of the Gospel, carry
themselves not as wise, but as fools, in the sight of the wicked, and ungodly,
and as Michal said to David 2 Samuel 6.20. they uncover themselves in the eyes of
carnal minded men, as a fool vncouers himself, they show themselves envious,
covetous, selfe-conceited, contentious one with another, censorious and such
like, even in the sight of the wicked, that they are able justly to tax them
with these and the like faults.

Oh remember thou have taken on thee the profession of the Gospel, and
would bear the name of a true Christian, thou must walk wisely even
toward them that are without; in thy whole carriage in thy words and deeds,
thou must have regard to the right end, Gods glory, and the good of others,
and thou must take heed thou give no just cause of exception or offense, by
any thing thou say, or do, no not to the wicked, and unbelieving; yea,
thou must be so wise in thy carriage, and thy behavior among them, Note.
as that sometimes thou must forbear the doing of some lawful thing so far
as may stand with the keeping of faith and a good conscience; if so be, thou in
thy Christian wisdom and discretion perceive, that the doing of it will hinder
some great good that may otherwise be done.

We have example of this in Paul, Acts 19.10. He was full two years in
Ephesus an Idolatrous City, and saw their Idolatrous worship of Diana, yet all
that while he kept silence, and spoke not a word in particular against Diana,
as he might have done, only in general terms he said, as it is in the
speech of Demetrius verse 26. That they were no gods which were made with
hands. And this did Paul forbear to do, that he might do some good in that
City by preaching of the Gospel, which could not have been suffered if he
had spoken against Diana in particular.

And thus must thou that art a true professor of the Gospel do sometimes,
and let it never be justly said of thee, that would carry the name of a
true Christian, 3. Things are to be considered, serving, to stir up true
professors of the Gospel to carry themselves wisely in the sight of the
wicked.
that thou art as covetous, as unquiet, once angry, as hard to be appeased, as
merciless, as ready to catch, as idle, as censorious, and iudgeing, as those
that make no profession at all, let none of these things, or the like, be
truly affirmed of thee, let not the wicked be able justly to charge them upon
thee.

And to that end consider.

First, that if thou carry thy self so unwisely, and so without Christian
discretion, as thou give just cause of exception, or offense, thou do
expose thy self to the malice of the wicked, and (as it were) enclose thy
self within their hands, and if the wicked be so bold, as that they will
assault the names of the harmless, with obtrectations, and slanders, how will
they insult over thee, having just advantage against thee?

Ezekiel 36.20. and the Apostle cites it, Romans 2.24.

Pet. 2.12. the doctrine of God our Savior is adorned, Tit. 2.10. and many
times unbelievers are wrought upon, and won as the Apostle says in one
particular; Let wives be subject to their husbands, that even they which obey
not the word, may be won by the conversation of the wives. Oh then, thou
that do, or would carry the name of a true Christian, be thou careful to
walk wisely toward them that are without, let thy words and deeds be ordered
by Christian wisdom, in all thy speeches, and actious, have an eye to Gods
glory, and the good of others, and take thou diligent heed, that nothing be
said, or done by thee, that may give just advantage to the wicked to speak
evil of thee, and to throw disgrace upon thy holy profession.

In the next place, we are to mark, that the Apostle says not, Walk wisely
with them, but toward them that are without; it is one thing to walk with
unbelievers, and another to walk toward them, there is great difference
between these two: to walk with any, is to walk as they do, Note.
and to hold on the same kind and course of life that they do, but to walk
toward others, is to live among them, and as occasion is offered, to have
business and dealing with them.

Hence then we may gather thus much.

That howsoever we are not to walk with the wicked, Though we are to eschew
the corruptions and bad manners of the wicked, yet we are not to avoid all
m^nner of deal^ng with them.
the Apostle has taught us, Phillip. 2.15. that we are to live blameless and
pure, and the sons of God without rebuke, but where? apart from all wicked
and ungodly men? no, in the midst of a naughty and crooked nation, among whom
we ought to shine as lights, and that in the world, even in the throng of
wicked men, and unbelievers. The Lord will have his children to live among the
wicked, as Lot did in Sodom.

Reasons why the Lord will have his children live among the wicked.
First that they may spend their time, their strength, and all their abilities
of body and mind, for the common good of all, as the Apostle says, 1. Pet.
4.10. let every man as he has received the gift, minister the same to another,
as good disposers, of the manifold grace of God.

Secondly, for the exercise of their faith, their wisdom, and other graces
that are in them, and for the trial of their strength in striving against
sin, that their faith and other graces may be exercised, and that they may
be tried what is in them, whether they will cleave to the Lord with a perfect
heart, or be carried aside with the corruption of the world, for that is
indeed true resistance of sin, and victory over it most victorious, when
we conflicting and grappling with many occasions and allurements to it,
strive against it, and overcome it, and he is truly good, who is good among
such as be evil, if Joseph had not been tempted to folly by his Mistress,
his chastity had not been so great and glorious.

The Lord therefore will have us live in the world, among the wicked of the
world, in the midst of many means and prouocations to evil, that the
strength of Gods grace that is in us, may be known, and this doctrine might
be applied to show the error of some of ancient time, Some briefly taxed, who
refuse to live in any fellowship with notorious sinful men.
and I might hereby show the error of the Monks and Votaries among the
Papists, who think it a state of perfection to live like droanes fatting
themselves in a cloister, apart from all society of men, but I rather choose to
show the limitation of this truth that it be not misconceiued of us, and
touching the limits of it, know we that it is thus confined.

We may live among the wicked, only as we stand in some relation with them, The
Godly may live among the wicked only as they stand in some relation with them
and as we are conjoined with them by some bond of nature, of office, of place
or habitation, for the corruption of men must not drive us from our station and
from performance of Christian duties that concern us in our places and
callings, as the Lord has called every one, Note.
so let him walk, 1. Cor. 7.17.

And again, we may have dealing with the wicked, only as just occasion is
offered, The Godly may have dealings with the wicked only as just occasion is
offered.
we may not hand over head, live with all sort of wicked persons, and carelessly
thrust our selves into any wicked company, and think as the foolish
Familists do, or as Drunkards and Epicures do, that it is no matter into what
company we come, we have no warrant for that: And there is great danger in so
doing, there is no disease so contagious, nor sickness so infectious, as is
the ill behauior of the wicked, if we sort our selves with them, and there is
no age, sex or complexion, so apt to catch and take a disease from another, as
are the best of Gods children, to take hurt by the company of wicked persons,
and therefore we are not to live among them, but according to the limite of
our own particular places and callings, nor to have dealings with them, but as
just occasion shall be offered unto us.

In the last place it is not to be omitted, that those who have not heard, or
not received the Gospel, are here said to be without, wherein the Church is
compared to Gods Kingdom, City or House, true believers to the subjects,
citizens and household of God, and unbelievers to strangers, and such as have no
part nor portion among them.

Here then appears the wretched and cursed condition Wicked men and
unbelievers are in a most miserable state and condition.
they are disioyned from God, the fountain of all true happiness and comfort,
they have no fellowship with God, or the people of God, Ephesians. 2.12. they are
without Christ, and are aliants from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
from the covenants of promise, and have no hope, and are without God in the
world. Yea wicked persons such as believe not so long as they continue in that
state stand subject to the whole wrath of God, Wicked persons are to consider
their fearful condition, and to hasten out of it as soon as possibly they
may.
thou that art a drunkard, a swearer, a profane person, consider thy cursed
state, as yet thou art severed from Gods comfortable presence, thou art shut
out from all benefit of Gods promises of life and salvation, thou have no part
nor title to the blessings of God, belonging to the Saints of God, and that is
a beginning of hellish torment, for final separation from God, and an
apprehension of his wrath is hell it self.

Now such is the case of all men, that do not yet truly believe in Christ,
and such are they that live in the practice of any known sin, yea think on
it, thou that art a wicked man, and an unbeliever, thou art so far disioyned
from God by thy sin, as there is greater enmity, and contrariety between
God and thee, then between fire and water, light and darkness, and if God be
against thee, then who can stand for thee? nay God being thine enemy, all the
judgments of God attend thee, all the creatures of God are armed against thee,
and thou lie open to eternal woe and misery: Oh then enter into a seserious
consideration of thy miserable state and condition, and pray to the Lord, that
by the light of his word, and power of his spirit, thine eyes may be open to
see that misery, and seeing it may be humbled for it, and hasten out of it,
and never rest till thou be sure thou do truly believe in Jesus Christ, and
then without question thou shall be in Gods favor, and be one of his own
house and family, The happy condition of such as truly believe in Jesus
Christ.
and have communion and fellowship with God, and with the Saints of God, and
that is a most blessed state and condition, thou shall then have peace with
God, with thine own conscience, with all the faithful, yea with all the
creatures in the world.

The stones of the field shall be in league with thee, and the beasts of the
field shall be at peace with thee, Job. 5.23. thou shall have access to the
throne of grace with boldness, and come into Gods house with joy and gladness,
thou shall have title to all the blessings of Gods Saints in this life, and
right to eternal happiness in the life to come.

Labor therefore for this above all things, and count all things loss in
respect of this, that thou may win Christ, and be found in him and by him
be conjoined with God, and the Church of God, and be partaker of all the
comforts and blessings that belong to Gods Saints.

Now to the last words of this verse.

(And redeem the time) the Apostle having required of the Colossians by way of
exhortation, generally; that they should walk wisely toward those that are
without, in these words (redeem the time) he shows how they may so do, and
wherein especially stands their godly, wise, discreet and wary walking
toward them that are without namely in or by redeeming the time, for these
words (redeem the time) are not (as they may seem) a distinct precept, or an
exhortation by it self, but are to be conceived as expressing the manner of
wise walking toward them that are without, the original text shows it
plainly, for thus run the words, walk wisely toward them that are without
redeeming the time.

The word here translated (time) properly signifies opportunity or present
occasion, that present fit time, Interpretation.
wherein any thing to be done, may be done fitly and happily, and it is
here to be understood with relation to the good that may be done, even for
that fit opportunity, and fit occasion offered of well doing, and the word
(redeem) in the proper and natural signification of it, signifies to buy some
thing back again, and it is here used metaphorically by way of similitude,
it is taken from the custom and practice of wise Merchants, or Tradesmen, who
use to buy their commodities while fit time of buying serves, and while the
market holds, and having (happily) had great losses, or formerly spent their
time idly or unthriftily, do afterward seek to redeem, and (as it were)
to buy back again the time that is past, not that they are able to call back
again any one minute of time past, that is impossible, but by their most
careful and diligent employing of the present fit time of gaining, that is
offered to them, by using in that opportunity more then ordinary diligence,
for recoueuering of their losses, even then breaking of their sleep, and
abridging themselves of lawful refreshing and delights, they do as much
business in that same time, as they might have done both in that, and in the
time formerly misspent, if they used only ordinary diligence; and so to
redeem that opportunity and fit occasion offered of doing good, and of
well doing.

Signifies two things.

First, to observe, take, and use it being offered, and not to let it slip, and
pass away without using of it.

And secondly, to use it with more then ordinary diligence, yea, to use it with
loss of our own pleasures and profits.

Thus then we are to conceive these words, as if the Apostle had said to the
Colossians.

Observe, take and use the opportunity, and fit occasion of well doing, when it
is offered, yea, use it with more then ordinary diligence, even with loss of
your own pleasures profits.

Now here first in that the Apostle says, walk wisely to them that are
without subioyning (as showing the manner how they may so do) (redeem the
time) or (redeeming the time) I might hence note thus much. That we show our
selves wise Christians, such as carry our selves wisely among them that are
without, if so be we omit no opportunity of well doing, but on that I will not
stand, but rather on a positive point, the duty hence offered, namely this.

The time and opportunity of doing good both in respect of our selves and
others, is to be taken and used when it is offered.
is not to be neglected, and let pass, when it is offered, we are to observe
the time and opportunity of doing good, and to take it, and use it, when it is
offered unto us, when we have opportunity for the practice of the duties of
piety, or for the doing of any good, we may not foreslow it, and let it slip
away from us, and this has our Savior taught us plainly, Ioh. 12.35. where
he says, yet a little while is the light with you, walk while ye have light,
least the darkness come upon you, for he that walks in the dark knows
not whether he goes, as if he had said, you have now opportunity, and fit time
to walk as ye ought, having light to direct you, look that you use it, while
you have it, and let it not pass away from you, least that being gone, and
darkness coming on you, you know not then whither ye go, Gal. 6.10. says
the Apostle, while we have time let us do good unto all men.

Let us not suffer any good occasion of doing good to others, slip away from
us, but let us take hold of it, while it is offered, and so in one particular
the holy Ghost bids us, Heb. 3.13. exhort one another while it is called to
day, and to these I might add many other testimonies, for the proof of this
point, Ierem. 8.7. the Lord complained of his people, that they did not observe
and use the time of grace and mercy, for the amendment of their lives when it
was offered unto them yea, in that respect he preferres the very bruit beasts
before them (says he) even the Storke in the air knows her appointed times,
and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow, observe the time of their
coming, but my people knows not the judgment of the Lord, they observe not,
neither use the time of grace and mercy for the amendment of their lives so
that we see by plain evidence of Scripture, that we are not to neglect and
let pass the opportunity offered unto us, for the exercise of piety, or for
the doing of any good whatsoever, the reason and ground of this is.

Because indeed,

We must learn and mark a difference of good things that are to be done by
us, A difference of good things that are to be done by us is to be observed
some are such good things as reach not to all times of this life, such as are
not to be done at all times, but are limited to some particular time and are
to be done in some particular time and season as hearing and reading the word
of GOD, and reading other good books, conference, set and solemn prayer,
giueinge good council, admonition, reproof, giuinge alms and the like.

Though these be good things, that we are to do, yet the doing of them, is
not bound to all times, and so the oportuni^ie of doing these things, and the
like: only then when the Lord does vouchsafe us means, and abillitie, and just
occasion in respect of time, place, person, and other circumstances. Other good
things there be that we are bound to do, which extend and reach over the whole
life, and are to be continual acts, to be performed in every part, and time of
our lives. From the doing of which, no part of our life is exempted: as
(namely) the exercise of faith, and repentance, of amendment of our lives, of
workinge out our own salvation, with fear and tremblinge, of seekeinge
reconciliation, with GOD, yea though we have assurance of salvation.

And the opportunity of doing these and the like things, is every instant and
present time, even every moment of our lives, is the opportunity given us for
the amendment and reformation of our lives, yet more special opportunity
vouchsafed unto us, for the doing of these things: For our turning to God,
for our seekinge reconciliation with God, and the like: is that time of the
Lords gracious visitation, as our Savior calls it. Luke 19.44 That acceptable
time, and that day of salvation, as the Apostle calls it. 2. Cor. 6.2. (that
is) that time wherein the Lord does offer us mercy in the ministry of his
word, wherein he stands at the door of our hearts, and knocks by the sound of
his word outwardly, and by the motions of his spirit inwardly, showing us our
sins, and moouinge us to repentance, yea that time wherein the Lord calls us
to repentance by his mercies, by his judgments, by his patience, and long
sufferance: thus then we are to conceive the doctrine now laid before us.

We are to observe the opportunity and fit time of doing good and to take that
opportunity when it is offered unto us, (that is) we are to observe and mark
when the Lord does vouchsafe us means to do good, and just occasion in regard
of time, place, person, etc. for the doing of any good thing that is limited to
some particular time, and to take that opportunity when it is offered, and to
use it, and not to let it slip, and we are to observe every part and time of
our life, as fit for repentance, and amendment of our lives; but especially,
the time of the Lords gracious visitation of us, by the Ministie of the word,
and when the Lord calls us to repentance by mercies, or by judgments, and to
take hold of that opportunity, and to use it, and not to suffer it to pass
away from us.

And now to come a little nearer to our selves, Cor. 6.2. We are to observe the
Lords gracious visitation of us by the m^nistrie and preaching of the Gospel
and to make use of it for our good while it is offered.
Behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of salvation: the Lord has a
long time, and does still vouchsafe to visit us with his word and Gospel, and
has seconded the same both with his mercies, and his judgments. This then is
that opportunity, this is that fit time of repentance, and of turning from our
sins to God, in amendment of our lives, and of doing good to our selves. Let
us take notice of it, and observe it, yea, let every one of us in particular
observe it; do thou observe, and take hold of this opportunity of the good of
thy soul while it is offered, thou know not how soon it may be taken from
thee. 2 Mot^ues to stir us up to observe the time of the Lords gracious
visitation of us by the pre^chi^g of his Gospel, and to make use of it while
we have it.


First, if Christ now knock at the door of thine heart, by the preaching of
the Gospel, and by his mercies and judgments, and thou defer to open unto
him, and to let him in, and let slip the opportunity of turning from thy
sins to God, in amendment of thy life; happily hereafter thou may pine
away with a desire of having him, and yet not find him, nor any place to
repentance; remember that exhortation of the Prophet, Isai. 55 6 Seek ye the
Lord while he may be found, and call ye upon him while he is near. There
will come a time wherein the Lord will not be found; yea, a time will come
which he threatens, Proverb. 1.26. When such as now regard not, but despise
his calling unto them, shall cry to him in their misery, and he will not
hear them, but laugh at their destruction: which is a fearful sentence, as
one says, the Lords laughter is more to be feared then his anger; therefore
take heed, thou let not slip that opportunity of doing good to thine own
soul that is yet offered unto thee.



From these words (redeeming the time) understood as before they were
expounded; we are further taught thus much.

be likewise Merchants or Tradesmen. A wise Merchant or Tradesman having
heretofore lost time of gaining, In using the opportunity of well doing we must
be likewise Marcha^ts or tradesmen, we must gain the time formerly lost by
our negligence, by double diligence.
he will (as it were) buie it back again, by his more then ordinary
diligence, when time serves him again; so must we do in respect of the
opportunity and time of well-doing offered unto us, we must gain the time we
have formerly lost by negligence, with double diligence; yea, we must redeem
it with loss of our ease, our pleasures, and our profits, 1 Pet. 4 3. It is
sufficient (says the Apostle) for us that we have spent the time past of the
life after the lust of the Gentiles, walking in wantonness, lusts,
drunkenness, in gluttonies, drinkings, and in abominable idolatries.

We are to consider our former misspent time, and not to mispend any more, but
rather to gain and recover that which has been lost with future diligence in
well-doing. Psalm, 119.32. David says, I will run the way of thy
Commandments, when thou shall enlarge mine heart: where we see David promises
that his heart being set at liberty, being set free by grace from the bondage
and dominion of his own natural corruption, he would not walk and keep an
ordinary pace in the ways of Gods Commandments, but he would run in them,
he would make more then ordinary speed in well-doing, and so redeem the time
formerly lost. Thus must every one whose heart is set free from the bondage of
sin, It must be far from true believers to spend their time in trifles, and
after the manner of the world, they must use more then ordinary diligence in
doing good things.
in vain delights to drive away dumpes, though indeed lawful recreation may
be used, if it be used lawfully, and at times meet and convenient, to make us
more fit for the good duties, yet thou must take heed thy heart be not
entangled with the pleasures of this life, remember thou, that time well
passed, is the best pastime, and thou that art a true believer, Note.
and set free from the power of sin, thou must use more then ordinary
diligence in doing of good things, thou must not content thy self to hear the
word, to pray or to do other good things, as mere natural men use to do
them (that is) so as may stand with their credit in the world, with their ease
and worldly profit; if hearing of a Sermon cross their worldly commodity,
they will none of that, thou must not so do; no, no, thou must redeem the
opportunity and time of doing good, thou must buy it with a price, even with
the loss of thine own ease, pleasure, and profitte. 2. Motives to stir us
up to redeem the time of doing good with the loss of our own ease, pleasures,
and profits.


And to help thee forward, and to stir thee up to the practice of this
duty: consider with me only these two things.

First, mark what the Apostle says, Tit. 2.14. Christ gave himself for us,
that he might redeem us from all

Judge of all the world, and have it said to thee as it is, Mat. 25.21. Well
done good and faithful servant, enter thou into thy Masters joy, then look
thou redeem the time of doing good, do not thou only observe, take, and use
the opportunity of well-doing, but use it with more then ordinary pains, and
diligence, even with loss of thine own ease, pleasure, and profit, and if
thou so gain time, no doubt thou shall then be richly rewarded with gain and
glory in the day wherein the Lord shall come to take account of his servants.

VER. 6. Let your speech be gracious always, and powdered with salt, that ye
may know how to answer every man.
In this Verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colossians to carry themselves
wisely toward them that are without, in one particular thing, (namely) in the
wise usage of their speech, because (indeed) in wise ordering of the speech;
spiritual wisdom is singularly discovered, and withal, holy and gracious
speech, is a usual and very effectual way and means of doing good upon them
that are without, and of winning them: therefore the Apostle does particularly
exhort thereunto.

The general parts of this verse are two.

First, a duty touching the right ordering of speech, propounded by way of
exhortation in these words, Let your speech be gracious.

1 Which exhortation is further enlarged by the extent of that duty, in respect
of time, that their speech should be gracious always. 2 And then, by a
similitude, wherein gracious speech is compared to meat powdered and well
seasoned, in these words, and powdered with salt,
The second part of the verse is a declaration of the end, wherefore the
Colossians should look that their speech were gracious (namely) this, that so
they might know how to answer every man, expressed in the last words, That ye
may know how to answer every man.

Of these in order.

First therefore, of the exhortation, Let your speech be gracious always, and
poudered with salt.

Interpretation.
In the original the words run thus, Let your speech be always in grace
powdered with salt, Which sentence standing upon a comparison, is in general
thus to be conceived; Let your speech be seasoned with grace as other things
are with salt: wherein the Apostle compares gracious speech to flesh, or fish,
or other things, that are powdered. Now (as we know) things that are powdered
with salt, are not only by that powdring kept from rottenness, and
putrefaction, but they also taste of that seasoning, and are made more sauorie,
and pleasing to the taste of those that eat them, they are made both
wholesome, and sauourie, so would the Apostle have speech and communication,
not only by grace to be kept from rottenness, and corruption, that so it be
not rotten speech, as he speaks, Epes. 4.29. But that it also be so seasoned
with grace, as that it carry with it the taste of grace, and even express the
grace that is within in the heart, and that it be good and profitable to the
hearers, and apt to engender and work some grace in the hearts, and minds of
them that hear it, for (indeed) speech is, or may be said to be gracious or
seasoned with grace, when it expresses some grace, that is in the heart of the
speaker, and when it is also apt to work some grace in the hearts of those
that hear it, as the Apostle says, Ephesians 4.29. When it is good to the use
of edifying, and does minister grace to the hearers.

Thus then we are to understand this exhortation.

Let your speech, your talk, and communication one with another be so seasoned
with grace, as other things are with salt, as that it be not only thereby kept
from rottenness, and corruption, but that it savor of grace, and express
that grace that is within in the heart, and that it be also fit to work grace
in those that hear it. Not to speak of that which is offered to us from this
verse, considered together with the former, the Apostle here exhorting the
Colossians to carry themselves wisely toward them that are without,
particularly in regard of their speech, and so implying that holy and gracious
speech serves much for the good of our selves, and others, we shall have
occasion to speak of that afterward.

In the first place, we have in this exhortation this duty plainly laid before
us.

That our speech must be gracious, it must Our speech must be seasoned with
the salt of grace, and savor of grace, as powdered meats do of salt.
and it must be a manifesting, and an expressing of the grace that is within,
wrought in our hearts. And hence it is that the Preacher says, Eccles. 10.12.
That the words of the mouth of a wise man have grace: and Prou. 15.1. Solomon
says, the tongue of the wise uses knowledge (that is) the wise person speaks
in such sort, as that his speech does show forth grace, and we have example
of this in our Savior Christ, Luke 4.22. Where we find it said, that he
spoke with an evidence, and plain demonstration of grace, that the people
wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.

And the reason of this, that our speech must be seasoned with grace, and
savor of grace that is within, is plain (namely) this*



Therefore the speech, which is the exercise of the tongue, must be seasoned with
grace, and must savor of grace.

Now that we may better conceive this duty, we must know that there be many
particular graces, that are to be sprinkled upon our speeches, as salt upon
meat, and wherewith it must be seasoned, and whereof it must taste, and
savor, 5. Special graces wherewith our speech must be seasoned and whereof it
must taste and savor.
but especially these five (namely) A reverent regard both of God and men.
Modesty. Meekness. Sincerity. And a due regard of the good name of others.


I will speak of them a little further in order briefly.

A reverent regard of God and men.
if we have occasion to use his names, and titles, as Lord, God, etc. or those
things whereby he is known to us, as his attributes, his ordinances, his
creatures, his judgments, etc. we are to use them with all reverence of his
great name, and with fear of his glorious majesty, Deuteronomy. 28.58. and contrary
to this, is light and careless using of any of his titles in our common talk
and communication, customable swearing, and forswearing, blaspheming, cursing,
making jests of Scripture phrase, and the like.

Again, our speech must be seasoned with a reverent regard of men, in our
speaking of men, and to men, we are to express a regard of that which is to
be reverenced in them, as (namely) the image of God, and especially the
renouation of his image, and if they be above us in age, gifts, place, etc.
then to speak of them, and to them, with just titles of reverence, as Anna
did, who being rebuked by Elie, answered him with reverence, and said, nay my
Lord, 1. Sam. 1.15. I might show this in other examples.

Contrary to this, is scoffing, cursing and deriding speech, and vnreuerent
speaking of men, and to men.

Secondly, our speech must be seasoned with modesty, Modesty.
and that is thus, if we be to mention good things, that are in us, or good
things done by us, tending to our commendation, we are to speak of them with
modesty, and so as we rather extenuate them, then boast of them, as Paul did,
1. Cor. 15.9. I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meet to be called
an Apostle, if we be to mention things that may move blushing, we are to
utter them in as seemly words as possibly may be.

Contrary to this is boasting and vainglorious speaking of our selves
forbidden, Prou. 27.2. let another man Meekness.
and contrary to modesty in speaking, is also filthy, obscene and unchaste
speaking forbidden by the Apostle, chapter the 3. verse 8. but put away even
all these things, wrath, anger, maliciousness, cursed speaking, filthy
speaking out of your mouth.

Thirdly, our speech must be seasoned with meekness, we are to answer or
reprove those that any way offend us, with meekness, with calm and quiet
speech, free from passion and perturbation, 1. Pet. 3.9. be courteous (says
the Apostle) not rendering evil for evil, neither rebuke for rebuke.

Contrary to this is miscalling, rating and reuiling one another.

Fourthly, our speech must be seasoned with sincerity, Sincerity.
or at least that we think to be the truth, and we are to deal plainly,
and sincerely with others, in speaking of their sins, when just occasion is
offered, to tell them of their sins, Ephesians. 4.25. speak every man the truth
unto his neighbor Leuit. 19.17. thou shall nor hate thy brother in thine heart,
but thou shall plainly rebuke thy neighbor, and suffer him not to sin.

Contrary to this, are lying, glosing, dissembling, and flattering speeches,
speeches that sooth up men in their sins, or extell them above measure,
whereof David speaks Psalm. 12.2. they speak deceitfully every one with his
neighbor, flattering with their lips, and speak with a double heart.

Last of all, our speech must be seasoned with care of other Care of other
men's good name.
we are to speak of the sayings or doings of other men in private,
charitably, either speaking of them, as little as may be, if they be evil,
or interpresing all in the better part, if they be doubtful, and where there
is no evident cause to the contrary, which is an especial fruit of charity, as
the Apostle shows 1. Cor. 13.7. love believes all things, it hops all
things, it endures all things.

The contrary to this is rash speaking, and censuring of the sayings and doings
of others, slandering, secret whispering abroad the faults of another,
tale-bearing, forbidden, Leuit. 19.16. Thou shall not walk about with tales
among thy people.

We see then how we are to conceive the duty propounded namely thus, our
speech must be seasoned with grace, and it must savor of grace, (that is) it
must express a reverent regard both of God and man, it must be a manifestation
of our modesty, meeknes, sincerity, and a due regard of the good name of
others. Reproof of such persons as many ways utter forth unsavory speeches.


Now then if we examine our selves touching this duty, how far will many
of us be found from that grace that ought to be in our speeches? are there not
many that are so far from seasoning of their speech with a reverent regard of
the great names of the LORD as that they carelessly use them in their common
talk, and upon every trifling occasion use to say, O LORD, O GOD Jesus etc.

And is the number of those few, that powder their speech not with grace, but
with oaths, blasphemies, and cursings? I wish it were not so, but alas, the
number of such is exceeding great, many there be that scarce speak a word,
but they powder it with an oath, yea, little children so soon as they are able
to speak, their mouths are full of oaths, they learn them (no doubt) of
their elders, and this is so common a sin, as we may justly say as the
Prophet did, Ierem. 23.10. because of oaths the land mourns; and are there
not many whose mouths are full of scoffing, scorning, and reproachful
speeches? and as for seasoning our speech with modesty, meekness, sincerity,
and due regard of others good name, are there not many whose mouths run over
with ribald and filthy speaking, with railing, reuiling, with lying,
dissembling, flattering, with uncharitable censuring, with slandering, secret
whispering, with tale-bearing? as the Apostle says, 1. Timoth. 5.13. some go
about from house to house, and are pratlers, and clacke in every corner,
whatsoever they know, and so are sowers of dissension, and makers of strife.

Well, let us take notice of our sin, and know whosoever thou art, that art
guilty of sin in any of these kinds, thou art so far from gracious
speech, as that thy speech is graceless and wicked.

And as they that have their speech powdered with grace have testimony to
their comfort, that their hearts are seasoned with the spirit of grace; Four
motives to stir us up to have our speech seasoned with grace.
so thou have evidence and testimony to thy terror, that the Devil sits and
rules in thy heart, and that thy tongue is set on fire of hell, Iam. 3.6.
Consider therefore thy fearful condition, and the greatness of thy sin,
and now therefore whilst that thou have time be thou humbled for it, and
labor henceforward to have thy speech seasoned with grace, and sauouring of
grace; and to that end consider with me further what Solomon says, Prou.
20.15. there is gold and a multitude of precious stones, but the lips of
knowledge are a precious jewel, as if he had said, the greatest heap of gold
and precious stones, is not to be compared with gracious words, and speech
seasoned with grace.

And again:

Proverbs 13.2. a man shall eat good things by the fruit of his mouth, what
be those good things that a man shall eat, as the fruit of his gracious
speech? surely, the good will of good men: yea, as Solomon says, Prou. 22.11.
of great men, and Gods blessing, these two are the precious fruits which good
and gracious speeches bring forth, as on the contrary, speech wanting grace,
is like stinking flesh, and it is loathsome and odious to God and good men, if
therefore thou would have testimony to thy comfort, that thy heart is
seasoned with grace, if thou would be enriched with that which is better
then gold, or precious stones, if thou would not utter that which is
hateful to God, and loathsome to all good men, and if thou desire the good
will of men, and Gods blessing on thee, then be thou careful to have thy
speech seasoned with grace, never rest till thou find that thy speech is the
very image and lively picture of grace, carrying in it and expressing a
reverent regard of God and men, modesty, meekness, sincerity and a due
regard of the good name of others.

From this exhortation, let your speech be gracious and powdered with salt.

We are further taught thus much.

That our speech must not only be a manifestation of Our speech must not only
be a mani^^station of grace that is in our hearts, but it must also be fit to
work grace in those that hear it.
and to this purpose speaks the Apostle plainly. Ephesians. 4.29. Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of your mouths, but that which is good, to the use
of edifyinge, that it may minister grace unto the hearers: as if he had said,
that which is sound, good, and gracious, and serves to the use of edifying,
and ministering grace unto the hearers: our speech must be speech of faith, of
hope, of love, of the fear of God, of patience, of comfort, of admonition, of
good counsel and the like.

May we not speak of worldly matters?

Yes doubtless, we may, There is no place for fond foolish idle, and fruitless
s^eeches.
and good to the hearers; there is no place for fond, and foolish talk, for
idle, and fruitless words. Our Savior says, that of such words we shall
give an account at the day of judgment. Mat. 12.36.

And if we repent not, even for them, we shallbee condemned: our speech must
be such, as may yield some good taste, and effect some good in those that
hear it: yea, it must be always such, as the Apostle here says. Let your
speech be gracious always: happily some will speak religiously, at such
time as they are pinched by affliction, then they will speak religiously, and
graciously, or before gracious company, and yet at other times, and before
other persons, let loose the bridle of their tongues. But a true believer, must
always season his speech with grace* and if he do it not at all times, and
customarilie, he does it not for conscience sake; and therefore look that thy
speech, be ever seasoned with grace, and such as is fit to minister some good
to the hearers, and that it may be so, observe these two rules. Two rules to be
observed, serving to make our speech fit to minister some good in the hearers.


First, premeditate and forethinke what is fit to be spoken for the good of
others, and let thine heart guide thy mouth, at it is Prou. 16.23.

Secondly, sanctify and offer up thy speeches to God in prayer, pray that the
LORD would guide thy tongue, and set a watch before thy mouth, and then
(doubtless) thou shall be ab e to utter gracious words, such as are seasoned
and savor of grace, and thou shall then add doctrine to thy lips, Proverbs
the sixteenth and the twenty three, thou shall so speak, as that others shall
be bettered by thy speech.

Now to the second general part of this verse (that is) the declaration of it,
to what end the Colossians should look that their speech should be gracious,
expressed in these words (that ye may know how to answer every man.)

Interpretation.
I will briefly deliver the sense and meaning of the words.

That ye may know (that is) that ye may attain unto wisdom and discretion,
and may be able to know how with wisdom and discretion to answer every man,
the word (answer) in our common speech has relation to some question, or
demand going before, and to answer (as we know) is to return speech to a
question or demand according to the purpose and meaning of the question or
demand, but here it is used in a larger sense and signification, it signifies
to begin and to continue speech whether upon occasion of some question or
demand, or otherwise, without occasion ministered by a precedent question or
demand.

And here it signifies generally to begin and to continue speech, we find
the word (answer) so used in many places of Scripture, Matthew. 11.25. it is
said, at that time Jesus answered etc. we find in that place, no question nor
demand going before, and so the word (answered) has not there respect to any
question or demand foregoing but is put to signify that which he began to
speak, and say, so Matthew. 28.5. we find it is said, that the Angel
answered, yet notwithstanding there went no question or demand before, and so I
might show it in other places, that the word (answer) is many times used
according to the Hebrew phrase, and does generally signify to begin, and to
continue speech, and so it is here used, and is to be taken in that general
sense and signification.

Now because an answer (as we know) is commonly occasioned by a question, or
demand from some other man; and is, or ought to be fit, and suitable to the
question, or demand, and made according to the purpose, and meaning of him
that makes the question, or demand: Therefore the Apostle adds (every man)
his meaning is, fitly, and to good purpose, according to the occasion offered
from any man. Thus then we are to conceive these words (that ye may know how
to answer every man) as if the Apostle had said more plainly thus.

That you may attain to wisdom and discretion, and may be able to know how
to begin, and how to continue to speak fitly, and to good purpose, according
to each occasion, that is offered unto you from any man. We are to mark and
observe in the first place, that the Apostle did here exhort the Colossians,
that they should have gracious speech in their mouths; that their speech
should be ever seasoned with grace, to this end: that they might know both
what, and how to speak fitly and to good purpose, upon every occasion.

He says to them, let your speech be gracious always, and powdered with
salt, that ye may know how to answer every man that is, how to begin, and
how to continue your speech fitly and to good purpose, hence we may take up
this conclusion.

That gracious speech, speech seasoned with Continual cus^ome of speaking
holily and graciously brings men to spiritual wisdom and enables them to
speak fitly, and to good purpose upon every occasion.
to be spoken and to deliver it in the best manner, and this is grounded on
that Parable of the talents, Matthew. 25. which being put forth to use, bring
forth, or rather bring in as many more, as it is verse 16* 17. If a man use
the grace that is in his heart, and express it by holy and gracious speeches,
he shall gain, and add more to it.

And hence it is that the preaching of the word is held a very effectual
means of increasing all manner of grace in the heart of the Preacher. Note.
Howsoever some teach others they should not sin, and yet themselves commit
foul sins, yet it is not possible, but that one, who is endued with faith,
and the Spirit of God, should utter gracious speeche^, to the edification and
good of others, and not be wonderfully strengthened, and much increased in all
manner of spirtuall grace himself; and in this sense it was that the Apostle
said to Timothy; These things exercise, 1. Tim. 4 15.
and give thy self unto them, that it may be seen how thou profitest among
all men: and so (doubtless) it cannot be, but that any, whosoever they be
that have grace in their hearts, and use it, and accustom their mouths to
utter gracious speeches, it cannot be (I say) but that they should be able to
speak wisely, and to good purpose at all times.

Would thou then be able to speak fitly, and to good Isai 50 4. Know to
minister a word in time to him that is weary? Oh then let thy tongue be ever
powdered with the salt of grace, have in thy mouth at all other times gracious
speeches, Such as desire to speak words of comfort in time to a weary soul,
must have their mouths at all other times full of gracious speeches.
and certainly then thou shall not be to seek of sweet and comfortable words
in time of need, many come to their friends whom they love well, and wish well
unto, in time of their trouble, happily lying on their sick beds, and are not
able to afford them on word of spiritual comfort, only they can use a common
form of speech, ask them how they do, and say, they are sorry to see them
so, and then they have done; here is one special cause of it, their mouths
are not seasoned with gracious speeches at other times; they use not to season
their speech with grace at other times, and so it comes to pass that when they
should, and (it may be) would use gracious and comfortable words, they cannot
frame themselves to them, but even then also, they are out of season with them;
learn thou therefore to acquaint thy self with holy and religious speeches,
let thy mouth at other times be exercised in speaking graciously, and then
(doubtless) though thou can not speak so eloquently, as some that foame out
nothing but goodly speeches, yet thou shall be able to speak to better purpose,
Note.
because (indeed) it is not man's wit, but Gods grace, that seasons speech, and
makes it profitable, and comfortable.

Through the use of rotten and corrupt speech men are made unfit to speak to
good purpose upon any occasion.
they that accustom their tongues to speak words grateful to none, but to
the Devil, and damnable men, what do they? Surely they make themselves unable
to speak to good purpose at any time, and they are not able to speak well,
and to good purpose, when there is most need of good speech, as happily when
themselves lie on their death beds, they are unable to utter one word of
spiritual comfort; but (as the Preacher says) The beginning of the words of
his mouth is foolishness, and the latter end of his mouth is wicked madness.
Eccles. 10.3.
A wicked man whose mouth is full of wicked graceless speeches, his words
begin in folly, and for the most part, they end in madness; lamentable
experience shows it, that such as accustom their mouths to utter rotten and
corrupt speech in their life time, when they come to the hour of death, they
commonly know not what to speak, or how to utter any word of sound comfort,
they either lie like stocks, or stones, or they speak idly, and vainly; and
(indeed) it is just with the Lord they should be so punished; as they loved
cursing, so shall it come unto them, and as they loved not blessing, so shall
it be far from them: As they loved graceless speech in their health, so it
is just with the Lord, that in their sickness they should be able to utter
that only which is graceless, and void of all true comfort: think on this,
and consider it, Psalm. 109.17.
thou that art a common swearer, a railer, or the like, thy words are not
wind, they pass not away with the speaking; no, no, thou that do belch out
bitter blasphemy, and other cursed speeches, thou do not only thereby offend
God, and grieve Gods children, and make thy self liable to the curse of God,
as other grievous sinners do, Note.
but thou prouokest the Lord to follow thee with his punishment in this
particular kind, that as thou have been graceless in thy speech in thy life
time, so thou should not have a word of grace, and sound comfort in thy
death; therefore remember thou swearer, thou railer, or the like, by thy
swearing, or railing, thou do even shut up thy own mouth, that thou shall
not know how to utter one word of comfort in time of thy distress, and in the
hour of death, and as thou do tender the comfort of thine own soul, in the
time of great distress, put away swearing, railing, and all manner of corrupt
and rotten speaking.

Now from the words themseues, in that the Apostle says here, that ye may
know how to answer every man.

We are taught in the next place.

That a Christian must have in him a knowledge, he must know how to speak as
occasion is offered, A Christian must know how to speak when he is demanded
any thing that pertaines to his Christian faith and profession.
especially if he be demanded any thing pertaining to his Christian faith, and
profession, 1 Pet. 3.15. Be ready always to give answer to every man that
asks you a reason of the hope th^^ i^ in you. A Ch istian must be ever ready
and prepared to give an account of his faith, and of his hope of salvation.

Confutation of Popi^h implicit faith.
faith infolded in the faith of the Church: the Jesuits teach, that Lay people
are not bound to know what matters of faith be: ignorance (say they) is better,
it suffices if they consent to the faith of the Church whatsoever it be,
which is a cross absurd heresy. If a Christian must know how to answer, and
must be ready to yield an account of hi^ faith, certainly then he must know
the doctrine of faith, and of Christian hope, it cannot otherwise be.

Reproof of such as are not able to give any good account of their faith.
If they be examined touching Original sin, justification in the sight of
God, and the like points, whereof they have often heard? yet they are not able
to give any good and direct answer; and let it shame us of this, (indeed) we
ought to be ashamed, have thou lived many years under the teaching of the
word? Do thou hear the doctrine of faith, and heavenly knowledge from day to
day, and is it not a shameful thing that thou should be unable to render a
reason, and give any good account of thy faith? Think on it, and let it shame
thee indeed, and never rest, till thou know how to answer any that shall ask
thee a reason of thine hope.



No, indeed a Christian is bound to make a just apology of his faith, and ought
to defend the truth, Mat. 26.63. and cap. 27 14. and we have his commandment,
Mat. 10.17. beware of men, and therefore we are not to answer such as ask us
something of our Christian profession, with a manifest purpose to scorn the
truth.

From these words (That ye may know how to answer every man.) We are further
taught.

That our speech must be fitly applied, it must be as an Christians must not
only know what to speak, but also how to speak fitly to the present purpose,
and so as they may do most good. To that end all due circumstances must be
considered
they must make their speech fit to the circumstances of times, persons, and
places, Proverb. 29.11. A fool (says Solomon) powers out all his mind: but
a wise man keeps it in till afterward. Pro. 15.23. How good is a word in due
season. Some private Christians being able to give good counsel, or to admonish
and reprove others, Reproof of them who observe not due circumstances in
admonishing or reproving of others
yet many times fail in fitting their speech to circumstances, they tell a man
of his fault being drunk, or in the heat of his passion, or they admonish and
reprove such as are not fit to be admonished or reproved.

Who are they that are not fit to be reproved?

They be of two sorts.

First, natural fools, Pro. 26.4. Answer not a fool according

Answer a fool, according to his foolishness, lest he be wise in his own
conceit.

There be two sorts of fools, natural fools, and conceited fools; natural
foole^ are not to be answered according to their folly, but conceited fools
are to be answered, their error is to be confuted, and their misdemeanour to
be reproved, that perceiving their dotage and sin, they may be humbled,

Secondly, such as be obstinate scorners, Prou. 9.8. Rebuke not a scorner least
he hate thee. And our Saviors rule is, Mat. 7.6. Give ye not that which is
holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before Swine. If thou (being a
private Christian) be certain that thy admonition, or reproof will do no
good, but that the parties reproved will trample them under their feet as things
of naught, thou art not to admonish, or reprove them, but rather be silent, or
separate from them; for if thou go beyond thy bounds against the rule of
Christ, where is thy warrant of safety against the malice of wicked and
violent persons? Surely it comes to pass sometimes, that a private Christian
admonishing, or reproving wicked persons for their sins, not observing due
circumstances, does expose himself to their malice, and they run on him, and
as mad dogs rent him, and tear him; yea, and sometimes put him out of
patience, and due moderation; therefore in thy admonition, in thy reproof, and
in all thy gracious speeches have regard to all due circumstances, and let thy
speech be fitly applied in respect of persons, places, and times, Prou. 25.11.
A word spoken in his place is like Aples of gold with pictures of silver, holy
and gracious speech is commendable in it self, but when it is uttered in due
time, and place, it is exceeding gracious and pleasant, it is pleasing to God,
and it becomes profitable to others, and comfortable to thine own soul and
conscience.

VER. 7. Tychicus our beloved brother, and faithful Minister, and fellow
servant in the Lord, shall declare unto you my whole estate.

8. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your
state, and might comfort your hearts.

9 With Onesimus a faithful and a beloved brother, who is one of you. They
shall show you of all things here.


The Apostle having finished the first general part of this Chapter (namely)
his exhortation to some general duties.

In this seventh verse he enters on the second general part of it, containing
the conclusion of his whole Epistle, The second general part of this Chapter,
and the conclusion of this whole Epistle.
the particular parts and branches of his conclusion we have heretofore laid
forth.

The first is laid down in the 7.8. and 9. verse and is a declaration of the
Apostles own love, and care of the Colossians, expressed by sending certain
messengers unto them, to acquaint them with his estate, and generally with the
estate of the Church where he was, and also to understand their estate, and to
comfort, and confirm their hearts; that is the some and substance of these
three verses.

In them, we have more particularly these two things offered to our
consideration.

First, the persons whom the Apostle sent, and employed

Secondly, the ends and causes wherefore he sent them.

The persons he sent, were Tychichus, and Onesimus, and both these he
describes, and commendes to the Colossians, to be worthy persons, by certain
excellent quallities. As first, in the 7. verse, he commends Tychicus both by
that which was common to him with all true believing Christians, that he was a
brother, to which he adds the adiunct and epithet (beloved) (Tychicus our
beloved brother) and then by that which was more proper, and peculiar to him,
in respect of his calling and function, as that he was, First, a Minister,
Secondly, more specially, a fellow-seruant with the Apostle in the Lords
business.


And to both these, he adds the adiunct (faithful) and faithful Minister.

Secondly, he likewise commends Onesimus verse 9.

First, by the title (brother) to which he ioines two Epithites (faithful,
and beloved) With Onesimus a faithful and beloved brother.

And secondly, by the particular relation that was between Onesimus and the
Colossians, that he was one of them.

Now the ends and causes wherefore the Apostle sends these two worthy persons
to the Colossians, are two.

(shall declare unto you my whole state) and the things done where he was,
generally, verse 9. (They shall show you of all things here.)

Tychicus, a faithful Minister; therefore he says, verse 8. Whom I have sent
unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your state and comfort your
hearts.

And thus we have the resolution of these three verses. I take them together,
because they make but one context.

In further handling of them, I will first speak of the persons that were
sent, and then of the ends, and causes of their sending.

And for the persons before we come to speak of them seueraly we may observe
thus much in general.

The Apostle sent not one messenger alone, but two together, though Tychicus
was a worthy messenger, and fit for the dispatch of the business alone, yet
with him he sent Onesimus, no doubt in these respects, both to make the
message of more authority, the things that concerned either party being
confirmed by the testimony of two witnesses, and for the mutual comfort and
aid which they might have of each other, both in their journey, and in their
business there, and for these causes (no doubt) it was, that our Savior sent
out his twelve Apostles two by two Mark. 6.7. and so the 70. disciples, two and
two before him, Luke 10.1. Hence we may gather the wisdom and care that ought
to be used in matters and businesses of weight and importance, especially in
businesses of the Church, both in regard of the business it self, and of the
persons employed in the same, but on that I will not stand, only observe we
generally touching the persons sent by the Apostle thus much.

That the Apostle did commend the persons whom he sent on his message, and he
set them out by sundry excellent qualities, and titles of honor, he said not
barely, I have sent to you one named Tychicus, and an other whose name is
Onesimus, but I have sent to you Tichicus, a man excellently qualified, a b
loved brother and faithful minister with Onesimus also a man worthy
commendation, being a faithful and a beloved brother, who is one of you: as
if the Apostle had said, I have sent unto you, men whom you may safely credit
and believe, and the report and message they bring you, is to be regarded,
because I know they are good men, and I dare boldly commend them to you for
such as will speak the truth, and make conscience of that they deliver unto
you.

This no doubt was the Apostles drift and purpose, in commending his messengers
sent to the Colossians, whence we may gather thus much.

That the dignity and goodness of the person or persons be it one or more,
that are sent on a message of weight and importance, is of great force to give
entertainment to the message that is brought, when the messenger is known to
be an honest man, and of good credit, and one fearing God, the message that he
brings, is the better credited, the honesty, fidelity and good qualities of
the messenger commonly makes the message more welcome and better regarded.

As David concluded of Ahimaaz the son of Zadoke, The honesty, fidelity and
good qualities of the messenger, commonly makes the message more welcome and
better regarded.
and so many times the good opinion that men have of the honesty and goodness
of the messenger, that brings them any tidings, it swayes much with them to
believe his report, and to give great regard to it: common experience shows
this to be true, even in civil businesses and matters of the world: and no
doubt thus it is also in the heavenly message, and in bringing the glad tidings
of the gospel, if such as are the Lords messengers, employed in bringing the
comfortable news of salvation, be known to be men well qualified, not only
with knowledge and utterance, but with sanctified hearts and lives, oh it
strikes a great respect of that which they bring, and preuailes much for the
entertainment and reverent regard of the message they deliver to Gods people:
for howsoever in that holy business, men ought to look rather to the message
then to the messenger that brings it: yet indeed the multitude and greatest
part, rather cast their eye on the messenger, than on the message, and
according as the messenger is, either good or ill, so they regard the message
it self. We read Mark: 6.20. Herod did many things that John Baptist taught,
not because John was an excellent teacher, but because he was a good man, so
says the text, Herod knowing that John was a just man and holy, he reverenced
him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.

Now here occasion is given to reprove some, who Reproof of such ministers*
as carry them selus basely and offensiuely in the sight of those to whom they
are sent.
and to exhort and stir them up that as they would see any due regard of the
message they bring to Gods people, and any good fruit of it, yea, as they
tender the comfort of their own souls in the great day of the Lord, so they
would be careful to show themselves not only able messengers, but good and
godly messengers of the Lord, and that they would make it appear, that they
not only call others to a fellowshippe and communion with Christ, but that
themselves also have true fellowshippe and communion with him, and that it may
be truly said of them as here of Tychicus, that they are beloved brethren.

We for our parts are to pray for this, that seeing the We are to pray that
all that are sent about the Lords holy business may be as well godly men as
good scholars.
and that they may be as well sanctified in their hearts and lives, as in their
doctrine sound and good, otherwise certainly woeful experience will show it,
that they shall pull down as much with their lives, as they build up with
their doctrine.

Come now we to speak of the persons severally, and first of Tychicus and his
commendation, in these words (Tychicus our beloved brother, and faithful
minister, and fellow-seruant in the Lord) what Tychicus was by birth, in
respect of the country, we find Act. 20.4. that he was borne in Asia, and that
he went with Paul going thither to preach the Gospel, but for his
description, here Paul calls him.

First (a beloved brother) a brother not by birth or blood, Interpretation.
or in respect of country (as the word brother) is often used in Scripture, but
in respect of religion, and profession of the same true faith of Christ, so are
all true Christians, all that profess the same faith of Christ called, Mat.
23.8. one is your Doctor, to wit Christ, and all ye are brethren, so in many
other places of Scripture, and the Apostle adds (beloved) thereby signifying
that he was worthy to be beloved of all true Christians, for his piety,
religion and godly life.

Secondly, he calls him (faithful Minister) that is, one who did serve Christ
in the ministry, and preaching of the Gospel, and in that office, he did
answer that trust that was reposed in him.

He adds (and fellow-seruant in the Lord) that is, one that serves the same
Lord that I do, even the Lord Jesus Christ in the holy ministry, and laboreth
in the ministry of the word together with me: this then is the meaning of the
Apostle, as if he had said.

Tychicus who is one professing the same true faith with us, one (no doubt)
beloved of God, and one whom I love, and worthy to be beloved of all true
Christians, and one that does faithfully serve Christ, in the ministry and
preaching of his Gospel, yea, and labors together with me, in the ministry
of the word, he shall declare unto you my whole state. Note we here, in the
first place, that the Apostle commending Tychicus, he gives him these titles,
as titles of honor and dignity, that he was a beloved brother, and faithful
Minister, and fellow-seruant in the Lord, he thought he could not better
grace him, and set him out, then by these titles, a brother in Christ, a
Minister of the gospel, and a fellow-seruant in the Lord; hence then it is
clear.

That these are indeed styles and titles of great honor, It is a great honor,
to be a brother in Christ, a minister of the gospel, and to be specially
employed in that service.


It is said, Ioh: 1 12. As many as received him, to them he gave power (or
rather as the word signifies prerogative and privilege) to be the sons of
God, even to them that believe in his name. Where the Evangelist teaches, that
as many as receive Christ, as many as truly believe in Christ, and are true
believing members of Christ, and so brethren one to another in Christ, they
have this privilege and preferment, to be the sons of God, the excellency
of which honor is unspeakable: and if to this be added, some special and
proper title, as to be a Minister of the gospel, it must needs be an
exceeding great honor; I It is monstrous impiety to turn the titles of
honor, which God has given to his servants into matter of scorn and contempt.
To say in way of scoffing, oh he is a brother forsooth, or he is one of the
brotherhood, and what is he but a pild Priest, or a pelting Minister, and such
like. Such sons of Beliall, and such profane scoffers there be in the world:
well, let it not discourage any that is (indeed) It is matter of comfort to be
of the brotherhood with the members of Jesus Christ.
that is a title of honor and glory, that the God of glory has vouchsafed to
set on his dearest children, and this is our rejoicing, (even as many of us as
are true believers) that the Lord has vouchsafed to honor us not with vain
puffes of worldly honor, but with such honor as shall never be taken from
us, yea, though we have only the common title of Gods children, the title of
beloved brethren, truly given unto us, it is enough to fill our hearts with
joy, and our mouth with laughter for evermore, that being a greater dignity,
then to be sons and heirs to the greatest Monarch in the world, for then we
are the sons and heirs to the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and heirs
of a Kingdom not earthly, but in the highest heavens.

Now more specially from the first of these titles (beloved brother) in that
the Apostle calls Tychicus a brother, and he adioynes (beloved) a brother in
Christ, a true Christian, and so beloved of God, and beloved of the Apostle
himself, and worthy to be beloved of al Christians: hence we are taught thus
much.

Though we are to love all men, yet more specially and more entirely are we to
love the Saints and children of God who are ou^ brethren in Christ.
we are bound even in that respect much more tenderly to embrace him in our
hearts, and to love him, howsoever, Christian love must reach generally to all
men, as they are men and reasonable creatures, and we must love even the
wicked and unbelieving, as partakers of the same nature, as they have title to
the same common redemption, and as they have in them the remainders of Gods
image, yet in more special manner, and with more entire and hearty affection,
are we to love the Saints and children of God, who have union and conjunction
with us in Christ. For indeed the order of Christian love is this, The order of
Christian love
we are first to love God simply for himself, and then all that bear his
image for his sake, and among these, those that bear Gods image, more
especially, to love them that are renewed according to Gods image in holiness,
and excel others in spiritual graces, Psalm. 16.3. my well doing (says David)
extends to the Saints and to them that excel in virtue, Gal. 6 10. let us
do good unto all men, but especially unto them which are of the household of
faith, our doing good is a fruit of our love, and it must be extended
especially to the household of faith, the object of our love is all men
generally, it must be set on all, as they bear Gods image, but chiefly on
the members of Christ, the Saints and children of God, in whom are manifest
arguments and signs of true and unfeigned holiness and religion.

What then shall we say to many in the world, who Many justly reproou^d who
hate them that are renewed according to Gods image, and spitefully abuse them,
and love and delight in them who bear the image of Satan.
and are brethren in evil, and mates and companions in drunkenness, in
swearing, and the like, surely, I may say as the Holy Ghost has taught me, 1.
Ioh. 3.12. they are as Kaine was, of that evil one, Satan, they are yet to be
reputed, both in their own, and other men's judgments, children of the Devil,
Kaine flew his brother, and why? because as it follows, his own works were
evil and his brothers good, the old serpent Satan, has not yet cast his skin,
he still sowes dislike among men, and for the same cause, we find it too
common, where some are truly fearing GOD, and religious, they make themselves
a prey, Isai. 59.15. others that are wicked, even in that respect, hate them,
gnash their teeth at them, cannot abide them, but let such know, as they are
like Kaine in sin, so it cannot be, but if they go on in that sin, they
shall at length be like him in punishment, the hand and curse of God shall
overtake them.

We are to love them that bear Gods image because they bear it, and a godly
man or woman because they are godly.
and to persuade us to it: know we then thus much.

That this is an infallible note of the true child of God, 1. John 3.14. we
know that we are translated from death to life because we love the brethren,
and David makes this a special note of him that shall dwell in the Lords
tabernacle, This is a special note that we are Gods children.
Psalm. 15.4. that he is one in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he
makes much of those that fear the LORD; would we then be infallibly assured
that we are the children of God? every one (no doubt) would have that
assurance, and every one making show of religion, How we may be sure that our
hearts are moved with a sanctified motion of love.
will flatter, himself, that he is a child of God, but would we certainly
know it, then let us love them that fear God, and bear Gods image, even
because they bear his image, because they are godly and religious, and that we
deceive not our selves in this.

Let us love with speciail love every one, in whom we discern any measure
of sanctifying grace, according to the measure of grace, without partiality,
and without respect of persons; for (happily) we may love some that are renewed
according to Gods image, some that are holy and religious, because they are
kind to us, and in respect of our own profit, or some other by-respect, and
yet not love others, as holy and religious as they, because they are not so
kind, and so beneficial unto us in outward things, that is, to love as the
Publicanes did, of whom Christ says, Mat. 5.47. that they are friendly to
their friends; and that love may be in them, that are yet in the corruption of
nature.

If therefore thou would be sure that thine heart is moved with an holy
and sanctified motion of love, then love them that are holy, and religious,
whatsoever they be, yea though they have many infirmities in them, and though
they be thine enemies, but yet love them so far as they bear the image of
GOD even because they bear his image, love every brother because he is a
brother in CHRIST, and that will be to thee an infallible note that thou art a
child of GOD, and it will certainly seal it up to the comfort of thy soul,
that thou art in the state of grace in this life, and shall be partaker of the
glory of Gods children in the life to come.

In the next place we are to observe that the Apostle commending Tychicus in
regard of his calling and function, that he was a Minister, and one that did
serve Christ in the ministry of of the Gospel, and one that labored together
with him in that calling, he gives to these titles the adiunct or epithet,
faithful (and faithful Minister) we see he does not commend Tichicus a
Minister for his wit, his learning, his eloquence, his gravity, etc. that he
was a learned, an eloquent, or great Minister, (though these be good and
commendable things in a Minister) but he commends him for his faithfulness,
that he was faithful in his Ministry and did answer that trust that was
reposed in him in discharge of his duty.

Hence then we may gather.

That the chief ornament and that which most commends The chief ornament of a
Minister of Christ is faith fulness in the execution of his office.
is to be faithful, it is the best epithet of praise that can be given to a
minister of the Gospel, that he is faithful, and that he is one that does
use the talent and gift bestowed on him for the best advantage of gaining
glory to Christ, his Lord, and of good to his people, and that in the
performance of such duties as concern him, he does answer that trust that is
reposed in him.

1. Cor. 4.2. As for the rest it is required of the disposers that every man be
found faithful, as if he had said, as for the other things, or howsoever he
be careful for other things, it is not so much material, but it is
especially required of a Minister of the Gospel, that he be faithful, and
(indeed) faithfulness is required of a Minister in every ministerial action,
that in teaching, in exhorting, in comforting, in reprehending, and such like,
he be found faithful, and without faithfulness he can do no duty of his
calling, pleasing to God, or profitable to men. I have heretofore handled this
point, Cap. 1.7. and therefore I now touch it in a word.

Now in the last place from this commendation of Tychicus, note we, that the
Apostle, though he was an Apostle, and Tychicus (no doubt) but an ordinary
Minister, yet he calls him fellow servant (Tychicus our beloved brother, and
faithful Minister, and fellow servant.)

We see then.

Ordinary Ministers that are truly called to that office, are fellow-seruants
with the Apostles.
though indeed, there is difference in degree between an ordinary Minister,
and an Apostle: an Apostle being a minister of a higher sort, and that by the
ordinance of God, yet ordinary Ministers serve the same Lord that the Apostles
did, even the Lord Jesus Christ.

And that is a matter of great comfort to all true Ministers of the Gospel,
faithfully laboring in their calling, Comfort to all true Mininisters of the
Gospel, who faithfully labor in their calling.
they are thereby assured of the assistance of Gods Spirit in teaching, of his
protection over them in their Ministry, and that they shall be rewarded in the
end, with an eternal weight of glory, as certainly as the Apostles that are in
heaven, they serve the same most powerful, good, and gracious Lord, the
Apostles did, and serving him, they cannot be disappointed of their hope.

Come we now to the description of Onesimus.
VER. 9 With Onesimus a faithful and a beloved brother, who is one of you.
This Onesimus (no doubt) was the same man that was servant to Philemon, who
both robbed his master, Interpretation.
and ran away from him, whom Paul after that having won to Christ, and
begotten in his bonds, as he says, Philem: epist. verse. 10. he sent again to
his master craving pardon for him. Now him, the Apostle calls not only
(beloved brother) but he adds (faithful) thereby meaning, that he was an
honest, and trusty brother, and he thus commends Onesimus, lest upon his former
fault, and fraud, the Colossians should take occasion to set light by him, and
the Apostle further commends him, that he was one of them (that is) one of the
same Country, and (it may be) of the same City with the Colossians, and a
member of their Church.

Now for the matter of doctrine offered unto us from this commendation of
Onesimus, (passing by that which was common to him with Tychicus, as that he
was a beloved brother) we are to mark here that the Apostle calls him a
faithful brother; thereby showing that howsoever he had been in former time
faulty, in deceiving of his Master; yet now being converted, and having
repented of that sin, the Apostle did not so much as think of his former
fault, but now esteemed him as an honest, and trusty brother, and so calls
him, and would

Hence we are plainly taught thus much.

That the falls and faults of men after their true repentance and conversion
to the Lord, are to be forgotten of us, The falls and faults of men after
their true repentance and turn ng to the Lord are to be forgotten of us.
no man's sin which he has truly repented of, ought to be any disparagement
to him in after time, we are not to have any man in less esteem, or to
think the worse of him for his sin in former time committed, if he have
truly repented of his sin, and good fruits of amendment do budde forth,
and show themselves in his life, and conversation, but we are rarher after the
example of the Apostle in this place to commend him, as far as truth will
bear, and to speak of the graces of God, that are in him.

Luke 7. We find, that when a certain woman that had been a notorious sinner
came to Christ, sitting in the Pharisees house, though she washed his feet with
tears and showed forth token of unfeigned repentance, and love, yet the
Pharisie that had bidden Christ, still esteemed of the woman as she had been
in times past, and said within himself, verse 39 Surely, this man is not a
Prophet, if he were, he would have known who, and what manner of woman this
is which touches him, for she is a sinner: this secret thought and close
biting censure of the Pharisie, our Savior, who knew his heart, brought to
light, and he reproved it.

First, by propounding to him a Parable, from the 40. verse to the 47. and in
the 47. verse, he does directly check his hard conceit of the woman, and tells
him, that he thought amiss of her: I say to thee, many sins are forgiven her
for she loved much, as if he had said, thou iudgest amiss of this woman, thou
art not to deem of her according to her former life past, known to thee to be
wicked, and sinful, but as she now is, truly penitent, and showing her
self an humble penitentiarie, judge of her by her love, which is an infallible
proof of her acquittance, and discharge from her sins, plainly teaching the
point I have now propounded, that we are not to think, or esteem the worse of
any one, that has been known in former times to be faulty, if so be now we
see visible and apparent signs of his unfeigned repentance, but we are to
think and speak of him as now he is.

And the reasons of this are these.

First, in regard of God that he may be glorified in the conversion of
sinners, for the worse they have been before, the greater is Gods mercy and
power in their amendment, and his mercy toward them therein ought the more to
be acknowledged, and he the more magnified for the same accordingly.

Secondly, in respect of the person himself that has repented, that he may be
encouraged, and fully persuaded of the good estimation he is in with men, for
howsoever his conscience, after his true repentance, do assure him of Gods
favor toward him, yet his weakness will easily make him suspect, that he
is contemned of men, or that howsoever they make show of esteeming him, yet
some hard conceit still sticks in their mind against him.

And lastly, in regard of other men, to whom his labors and endeauours, though
never so well performed, shall be of little force or fruit, except their be a
good opinion conceived of him, for these reasons we are not to think, or
speak the worse of any that has been heretofore known to be guilty of
some great sin, if now he have repented, and do show evident signs of
sound repentance.

First, therefore such persons are justly to be taxed, and much to be blamed,
who if once they know another to be guilty of some great sin, ever after
that, carry a foul suspicion of that party, and though they see manifest
tokens of repentance, Reproof of them who once knowing another to be guilty of
some great sin, ever after think hardly of that party though they see
manifest tokens of his repentance.
yet will never be satisfied, but are always suspicious, and take it as a
maxim or ground, he or she, that is once found to be evil is always
supposed to be evil; yea some are so rash and so unadvised, that they are
ready on every jar, and difference, to cast that in the teeth of another,
which happily the Lord has cast behind his back, and forgiven the party
having truly repented.

This ought not so to be, thou art not to think, or speak the worse of any,
whose sin has been open to the sight of the world, if now he have repented
of his sin, and now carry in his body and life, the marks of true
repentance; consider with thy self, that thou would be loath to have that
thrown in thy dish, thou have done amiss in former times, if thou have been
truly humbled for it; remember then to deal with others, as thou would be
dealt withal thy self: and for this point I say no more but this, take heed
thou condemn not him, whom (it may be) God has acquitted, set not thou a
curse where thou see the print of Gods blessing, and do not thou load them
with heavy burdens, whom (for any thing that thou know) Christ himself has
disburdened; if thou so do, thou make thy self odious in the sight of God.
Prou. 17.15. He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemns the just,
and whom God has justified, even they both are an abomination to the Lord.

Comfort to such as have been guilty of foul sins, but now are truly humbled
for the same.
and are not to be cast in their teeth, and they are not to be vpbraided with
them? Here is then matter of great comfort to all such as have been
heertofore overtaken with foul sins, but now are truly humbled for the same,
and do testify their repentance by bringing forth new fruits, men are not
to object these sins to them, if they do, it is either malice, or rashness
in them, it is their sin; yea further, if thou have been faulty in some foul
sin in times past, and have truly repented of thy sin: know it to thy
comfort, Note.
the devil himself is not to vpbraid thee with it, he cannot lay it to thy
charge, if he do at any time object to thee thy life past, on this ground
thou may repel his objection, and may boldly say unto him, tell me not
what I have been, but tell me what I am, and what I will be by Gods grace
hereafter, I confess (indeed) to the glory of Gods power, and mercy, I have
been thus or thus faulty, but now as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 6.11. I am
washed, now I am sanctified, I am justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
by the spirit of my God, and the Lord now accepts me not as I have been, but
as I am; and therefore avoid Satan, be packing, thou art not to object to me my
former sin, thus may every one that has truly repented his former gross
sin, answer the Devil, obiecting to him his life past, and this is a
singular comfort to all true repentant sinners, and let none but such take hold
of this comfort, let not such as live in their sins, catch at this, it
belongs not unto them, but if thou have been a grievous sinner heretofore,
and now art humbled truly for thy sins, and truly repentant, here is
comfort for thee, I speak it for thy comfort alone, neither men nor devils are
to object to thee thy former sins, if they do, it is nothing, the Lord does
justify thee, and who shall condemn thee? and think on it to thy comfort.

One thing yet remains in the commendation of Onesimus, the Apostle adds
(who is one of you) as if he had said.

Onesimus is on of your own city, and a member of your Church, therefore you
ought the more to esteem him. Hence we are taught.

That even natural and civil respects in which men partake one with another,
as consanguinity, affinity, If men be conioined not only by the bond of one
faith and relig on, but also by some natural or civil bond, they are in that
respect bound to love and regard on another more tenderly.
nation, country with the like, should be to them causes of greater mutual
love one toward another, if men be conjoined not only in fellowship of the
same faith and religion, but also by some natural or civil bond, they are in
that respect bound more tenderly to love and regard one another.

And on this ground (no doubt) it was that the Apostle said 1. Tim. 5.8. if any
provide not for his own, namely, for them of his household, he denies the
faith and is worse then an ^^^id^ll; a man is especially to love, and regard
those that are more nearly knit to him, by the bond of nature, Reproof of
them who regard those least who are of themselves.
in regard of the familiarity we have with them, or because their infirmities
are best known unto us, and it i^ hard to find neighbors to agree together,
even because they are neighbors, and daily converse one with another, what
iarres and differences do daily rise between neighbor and neighbor, and
between such as dwell the next door one to another, we find it too common a
thing; well, let us remember, that our neighborhood ought to bind us more
nearly together in spiritual love one to another, and when thou art stird up
by the Devil, and thine own corruption, to jar, and to fall out with thy
neighbors, think thus with thy self. Shall I fall out with him? no; besides
the common bond of Christianity I am bound to him, with a more special bond
of neighborhood, he is of the same parish, and of the same particular
congregation with me, and therefore I ought the more to love and regard him,
even in that respect, let us remember that we are taught by the same word, fed
at the same table of the Lord, led along by the same waters of comfort, and we
rest in the same fold, and let us in regard of that near conjunction, more
tenderly love and regard one another, that so having mutual love, and
fellowship one with another in this life, we may (through Gods mercy) have
eternal fellowship, and communion together in the life to come.

Having now spoken of the persons whom the Apostle sent to the Colossians, and
of the commendations he gave them, come we to speak of the ends, and causes,
wherefore he sent them, which are (as I have showed) two.

First, to acquaint the Colossian with his own state particularly, and with
the state of things where he was generally, as he says verse 7. (shall declare
unto you my whole state) And verse 9. (They shall show you of all things here.)

Secondly, that he might be made acquainted with their state, and that they
might receive comfort by his messengers, sent unto them, and especially by
Tychicus, whom he says verse 8. that he sent to them for the same purpose.

Touching the words, some things are to be cleared, that we may better
proceed in the matter of doctrine verse 7. ( shall declare unto you my whole
state) the Apostle by his whole state, Interpretation.
meant all those things that were done to him, and befell him in prison, for
so the words do signify, things done about me, or done to me, the Apostle
would have the Colossians understand, what was done to him, and how he was
dealt withal being in prison, then he says verse 9. they shall show you of
all things here, by all things, he meant not all things in general,
whatsoever were done at Rome, for there was (no doubt) a multitude of things
done, a world of things done in that City, but all things concerning the
state of the Church, and the case of Christian faith, and profession, the
knowledge whereof was profitable for the Colossians to know.

And where he says verse 8. that he sent to them for the same purpose, that
he might know their state, his meaning is, that he might understand the state
of their church and how it stood with them in regard of Christian profession,
how the Gospel prospered, and was glorified among them, or otherwise how they
were molested, and troubled for the Gospel, heads (and might comfort your
hearts) (that is) might encourage you, and cheer up your hearts, happily
grieuing, and fainting for my imprisonment, or persecution of the Church, that
he might hearten, and strengthen you against imminent dangers, and against the
scandal, and offense of the cross; thus then we are to conceive the Apostles
meaning, in respect of the ends wherefore he sent messengers to Colosse, as if
he had said.

I have sent to you two worthy Messengers, Tychicus and Onesimus to these ends,
and purposes, that they may report to you how I am dealt withal, and all
things that are done to me in my imprisonment, together with all things that
concern the state of the Church here at Rome, and may relate, and make report
to me back again, how it stands with you, how the Gospel does prosper, and
is glorified among you, or otherwise, how you suffer for the Gospels sake, and
that they might be means to cheer up your hearts, that you faint not at my
trouble, and might strengthen you against troubles that are like to fall upon
you, and against the offense and scandal of the cross. I might hence (as just
occasion is given) speak of the Apostles singular care that he had over the
Colossians, who being himself in prison which could not but give him much
occasion of care for himself, yet ceased not, to care for them, and in care of
their good, not only to write, but to send such worthy messengers unto them,
and that for so good ends, yea such men as himself (no doubt) had need of to
minister to him in prison, and so, for their good, to neglect (as it were, his
own life, and health, which was an exceeding measure of care, and it ought to
be imitated of all that will approve themselves faithful and careful
ministers in the like case, but upon that I will not stand.

In that the Apostle sent, forth his messengers to these ends, to acquaint the
Colossians with his own state, and with the state of the Church where he was,
and to understand of their state, he does plainly manifest a desire that was
in him to know the state of the Colossians, and that they also were desirous to
hear and know his state, and the state of the whole Church where he was, and
that they did even long to hear one from another, whence we are given to
understand thus much in general.

That particular Churches may be desirous to know Particular Churches may
desire to know the estate one of another, and particular persons may enquire
after the estate of other Churches. Nehem 1.2. Reason.
yea, of special members, and special instruments of Gods glory, in other
Churches.

We have here example of it, and elsewhere in other Epistles of Paul, and we
have a notable example of it in Nehemiah: Nehemiah enquired after the state of
the Jews and concerning Jerusalem, and there is reason for this.

Because (indeed) the Lords dealing with his Church, is not only a part of his
revealed will, but it is a thing of special note and observation, and therefore
may be enquired after and known.

And so it is lawful for us, It is lawful to desire to hear news from other
Churches, and touching such as be special instruments of Gods glory in them,
if it be not for novelties sake.
it is an Heathenish thing to hearken after news for novelties sake, as the
Athenians are noted to have done, Act. 17.21. who gave themselves either to
tell, or to hear some news, and many of us may justly be taxed also for so
doing, we may lawfully desire to hear news, but our listening after news
from other Churches, must be to other good ends and purposes, as namely, that
we may praise God for their good estate, or that we may reach forth our
helping hands to them, either by prayer, The principal causes why we should
desire to hear news from other Churches.
or otherwise, as occasion and necessity shall require, these (indeed) are the
principal, and almost the only causes why we should be desirous to hear
news from other Churches, and if we listen after news to these ends, it is a
testimony of our communion with them, and that we are members of the same
body with them, and have a fellow-feeling, both of their good, and of their
troubles.

Now more specially, in that the Apostle says, verse 7. That Tychicus should
declare to the Colossians his whole state, how he was dealt withal, and all
things that befell him in his imprisonment, this being one end, wherefore he
sent his messengers, and he sending those messengers, out of his singular love,
and care that he had of the good of the Colossians we must needs conceive thus
much.

That it was goood for the Colossians to know the state of the Apostle then in
prison, and hence we may gather this point of instruction.

It is good for us to be acquainted with the state of Gods children that be in
prison, or in any other trouble or affliction.
it is good for us to know, and consider how they are dealt withal, what
things come unto them, how they behave and carry themselves in their troubles
and what issue they have out of them, what end the Lord makes, as James says
Iam. 5.11. ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have known what end the
Lord made, so it is good for us to know, yea to mark, and observe the things
that befall Gods children in their sufferings, and what end the Lord makes of
them, and not only to know and consider the things that befell the Church and
children of God in former ages, set before us in the Scripture for examples to
look upon, but to know and consider the things that are now done to Gods
children in time of their troubles, and how they demean themselves, and what
issue they have out of them, for therein we shall many times see Gods great
mercy and his wonderful power manifestly appearing, and therein we shall see
the malice and fury of Satan, and of the world against Gods children, and how
marvelous the Lord is in his Saints, how he many times restraines the malice
and power of their enemies, how he supports and holds up his children, how he
arms them with patience, and how he is present by the unspeakable comfort of
his spirit, when they are most weak, and gives them issue out of their
troubles when all hope seems to be gone, and therefore doubtless it is good
for us to know and consider the state of Gods children in time of their
imprisonment or any other suffering whatsoever, it is good for us to mark and
observe it, and to be acquainted with it.

To what purpose may some say? Que^t.


Even to this purpose, The great good that comes unto us by our knowledge and
due consideration of the state of Gods children in time of their troubles and
afflictions discovered.
the knowledge and due consideration of the state of Gods children in time of
their pressures and afflictions, and how they are dealt withal, how they
carry themselves, what comfort they find, and what end the Lord makes of
their trials is of excellent use, to put off, and to make void a notorious
shift that Satan uses sometimes against the weak Christian, as when a weak
Christian is pressed with some great affliction, and some to comfort him, and
cheer him up, happily put him in mind of Joseph, of David, of Job, and such
like, and wish him to consider what end the Lord made of their trials, Satan is
ready to suggest to the weak Christian, alas, what tell you me of Joseph,
David or Job? what am I to be compared to them? they were men of excellent
gifts, and endued with a great measure of strength their examples is not to be
used and applied to me, which indeed is false, for as James says of Elias,
Iam. 5.17. they were subject to like passions that we are, they had their
infirmities as other men have, and they are set forth as examples of comfort,
to the weakest of Gods children, but if a weak Christian through the subtilty
of Satan, and his own weakness, be not able to find comfort in
consideration of these examples, yet if he can call to mind, that he knew in
his own time a child of God, as weak as himself, lying under some great
affliction, and he was acquainted with his whole state in his affliction, and
how the Lord vouchsafed comfort unto him, and made a good end of his trouble,
he shall find that that will be of excellent use to repel and quench the
fiery darts of Satan, and that will be a notable means to strengthen and to
hold him up, and to give him assurance, that the Lord will likewise restrain
the malice of Satan against him, and give him patience in his affliction, and
will make such an end of it, as shall be most for his own glory, and his
comfort; do thou therefore acquaint thy self with the state of Gods children,
suffering either imprisonment or any other trouble, (thou can not want
examples) consider, observe, and mark them, how they are dealt withal, how
they behave themselves, what end the Lord makes of their trouble, and thou
shall find it will be a notable means to strengthen thee in time of like
trial, and if thou in time of thy affliction can call to mind, and be able
to say, I know a child of God, that was afflicted as I am, I remember his
whole state, how he was dealt withal, and what end the Lord made of his
trouble, no doubt, thou shall find, that this conclusion of comfort will
follow. Therefore I make no question, but that the Lord will be likewise good
unto me, and give me such issue out of my trouble, as shall be most for his
own glory, and my good; Let every child of God therefore, labor not only to
arm himself with comforts and examples of Scripture, (though with those
chiefly) but with examples also of his own age and time, and thou shall find,
that in time of need, thou shall thereby have stronger consolation and comfort.

Now further whereas the Apostle says, he sent his messengers to the
Colossians, to know their state, and to show them all things where he was,
meaning this, to know the state of their Church, how it stood with them in
respect of christian profession, and things that did concern the state of
religion where he was, we may easily conceive thus much.

That in our listening and enquiring after the state of other We are chiefly to
inquire how it stands with other churches, and with our friends absent in
respect of religion.
how it fares with the gospel among them, and how the professors of it are
dealt withal; yea in our enquiring after the state of our particular friends
absent from us, we are chiefly to listen and look after their spiritual
state.

It is an usual thing, for men in token of their love, to inquire after the
health, the wealth, Reproof of them that chiefly inquire after other things.
which (indeed) is not to be disallowed, it is both lawful and commendable:
the Philippians inquired after the health of Epaphroditus, cap: 2.26. after he
had been sick, and now recovered, the Apostle sent him to them that they might
see him, and rejoice for his recovery; But we are especially to listen after
them, and desire to know how it stands with them in respect of religion, how
they profit and increase in faith, in love, in repentance, in humility, and in
other gifts and graces of Gods spirit, that is the thing we are chiefly to
inquire after: and let it suffice to have named this point. The Apostle adds
further, that he sent Tychicus to the Colossians, that he might comfort them,
that he might be a means to cheer up their hearts, that they should not
faint at his troubles.

Whence we are taught.

That it is a principal duty to be performed by them Tychicus was, to others,
to comfort them to whom they are sent, that they faint not, and that they be
not overcome of affliction: yea it is one special end to be d^iuen at by all
such as are sent forth from the Lord to his people, even by all the Ministers
of the gospel, they are in their speeches and ministerial actions, chiefly to
aim at this, that men's hearts may be comforted, that such as belong to God may
receive spiritual joy and comfort, The ministers of the gospel are chiefly to
intend in their speeches and mini^teri^ll actions, the spiritual joy and
comfort of such as belong to God.
and may be furnished with such comfort, as that they may be able to stand
without fainting in time of any affliction, that is either upon themselves or
others.

Pet: 1.8. this point I have handled before, therefore I now only touch it.

Many ministers of the gospel justly reproou^d, but especially the wickedness
of popish teachers discovered.
who turn their speeches and their teaching to a clean contrary end, even to
hold men in continual fear and doubt, and so in stead of comfort they fill
them full of discomfort, and despair in time of great affliction, any man may
see that that is to cross the ordinance of God, and to profane the holy word
of comfort.

We are further to mark, that the Apostle says not, and might comfort you,
but, comfort your hearts.

Hence we are taught,

True and sound comfort of heart is ordinarily delivered by the ministers of
the g^s^ell out of the word of God.
I say (ordinarily,) for extraordinarily it may be delivered by private
persons. Job 33. verse: 19. we find that when a man is stricken with sorrow on
his bed, and finds no comfort, yet if there be with him a faithful messenger
of the Lord, one of a thousand, if he declare unto him his righteousness, and
minister comfort to him faithfully, out of the word of God, that will comfort
him, and cheer him up, and make him see the face of the Lord with joy, verse.
26. and the reason and ground of this is,

Because (indeed) the Lord that formed the lips has undertaken to give a
blessing to the word of comfort delivered by his faithful Minister, Isai.
57.19. I create the fruits of the lips to be peace. Peace unto them that are
far of, and to them that are near (says the Lord. Peace (that is) true,
perpetual, and constant comfort, unto them that are far of, and to them that
are near.

Oh then, Special account to be made of the comforts of the word, delivered
by the ministry of faithful Ministers.
How ought we to treasure, and store it up in our hearts? Worldly wisdom
teaches men to provide against a storm, and a rainy day (as we use to
speak) that they may have some thing to comfort their bodies in time of need;
oh then be thou wise, provide some comfort for thy soul against the time of
distress, and affliction, and remember that thou can not ordinarily have
true comfort, unless it be delivered by the ministry of the Gospel, out of
the word of God, and the comforts that faithful Ministers deliver out of the
word, are cordial indeed, they are such as will stand by thee, and cheer up
thine heart, when all the comforts in the world, fail thee, thou may
observe in that, sometimes it comes to pass, that a man that has had no care
to provide such comfort, when the Lord lets loose the cord of his conscience,
and (happily) now he lies on his death bed, though he would give all the
world, (if it were his) for the least dram of sound comfort, yet he cannot
have it, therefore be thou wise, now make precious account of the comforts
delivered to thee in the ministry of the word, hide them and treasure them up
in thine heart, that in time of need they may comfort thee, and thou may
find the sweetness and comfort of them in thy greatest affliction.

VER. 10 Aristarcus my prison-fellow saluteth you, and Marcus Barnabas sisters
son, (touching whom ye received commandments. If he come unto you, receive
him.)

11 And Jesus which is called Iustus, which are of the circumcision. These
only are my worke-fellowes unto the kingdom of God, which have been unto my
consolation.


In this verse the Apostle comes to a second branch of his conclusion, The
second branch of Apostle conclusion.
(namely the declaration of the love of others, that were with him toward the
Colossians, made known both by their salutations, sent unto them, and by their
prayers for them, in the 10.11.12.13. and 14. verses. In the 10 and 11. verses
we have three persons mentioned, that out of their love sent salutations to
the Colossians, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Jesus, and that the Apostle might
incite and stir up the Colossians, to regard the love of these men, and to
love them again, he describes them, and sets them out after a double manner.

First, he commends them by such titles as were proper to them severally, as
that Aristarcus was his prison-fellow, Marcus kinsman to Barnabas, his sisters
son, and that he was also a man touching whom they had received
commandments, that if he came unto them, they should receive him, and Jesus,
by his surname, that he was surnamed Iustus.

Then the Apostle commends them all three together, by things common to them
all. As

First, by their descent from the Jews, that they were al three of the race of
the Jews, (which are of the circumcision.)

Secondly, by their assisting of him, and working together with him to the
kingdom of God, which commendation is further amplified by the word of
restraint (only) that they only were his workfellowes unto the kingdom of
God. And then,

Thirdly, they are commended by the comfort which they yielded to the Apostle,
that being in part, an effect of their assistance of him to the kingdom of
God, in the last words of verse 11. (which have been unto my consolation) and
so we see the general things contained in these two verses.

Come we to speak of them severally, Interpretation.
and first of the 10. verse. (Aristarcus my prison-fellow saluteth you, and
Marcus, Barnabas sisters son.) Touching these two persons, who they were: the
first of them we may read of, Act. 19.29. and Act. 20.4. and Act. 27.2. In
those pla^es we find that he was of Macedonia, a Thessalian, no doubt,
descended of the Jews, and being converted by Paul's preaching, he did
accompany him in the most of his iourneies, he was taken with him in the
tumult at Ephesus, and after that he accompanied him going into Asia, and was
carried prisoner together with Paul to Rome, and therefore he here calls him
his fellow-prisoner.

The other here named (Marcus) was (no doubt) that John Mark, spoken of, Act.
12.12. who being taken into the company of Paul, and Barnabas, ministered to
them in their journey till they came to Perga, a City in Pamphilia, but then
departed from them, and returned to Jerusalem, Act. 13.13. by means of whose
departure, there arose afterwrd a sharp difference between Paul and Barnabas
insomuch as they parted company, and went asunder one from another, Act. 15.39.
But after this, Mark repented him of his departure, and was reconciled to
Paul; yea, he became studious, and painful in promoting the Gospel, and he
was with Paul being prisoner at Rome, and ministered unto him, as appears both
in this text, and Philem: Epist. verse. 24 him the Apostle commends under the
title of Barnabas sisters son, (that is) nephew, or kinsman to Barnabas, that
worthy servant of Christ, and he further adds that touching him they had
received commandments, meaning that they had been written to concerning him,
and the tenor and effect of the commandment, or writing was, that if he came
they should receive him (that is) that they should entertain him kindly, and
respectively, as a true and faithful servant of Christ, and the reason of that
Commandment, or writing was, lest upon his former fault, his refusing to go
with Paul, and Barnabas to the work of the Lord, and thereupon Paul's refusal
to take him to his company, the Colossians should think that Paul still
carried an hard conceit of him, and that he was not worthy to be received.

Thus then conceive we the meaning of the Apostle in the Apostle, in the words
of this verse; as if he had said.

Aristarcus that has gone through many brunts of trouble with me, and now my
fellow-prisoner, and John Mark nephew to Barnabas, that worthy servant of
Christ. who (indeed) at one time pulld away his shoulder from the work of the
Lord, for which I was much offended, and after that refused to take him to my
company, but having repented himself of his departure, and being reconciled
unto me, I have written to you concerning him, and touching him you have
reciued commandments, that if he come to you, you should give him kind and
respective entertainment. These two out of their love, send salutalions, they
lovingly and friendly salute you. Now here observe we in general that these
persons Aristarchus, called Iustus, out of their love, and in token of it, sent
salutations to the Colossians, whence we have warrant and ground for sending of
salutations. That sending of salutations, is not only a matter of civility,
Sending of salutations is not only a matter of ciuility, but a duty of love
that one christian is to yield to another, and it must proceed from love.
and good manners (as we call them) but a duty of love required of Christians,
and to be performed one to another, by word, or by writing, we have example of
it not only here but in other places also Romans 16. almost throughout the whole
chapter, 1. Cor. 16.19.20. 2. Cor. 13.12. we find it required by express
precept, greet ye one another with an holy kiss, and therefore sending of
greeting one to another, is not only a matter of common courtesy, but a duty
to be performed for conscience sake, to express that love and good affection
that we bear one to another, for the Lord who has appointed it to be a token
of love, would have it to proceed from love, and therefore whom we are
forbidden to love in their evil ways we are forbidden to salute, 2. Ioh. 10.
verse. If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not
to house, neither bid him god-speede. We must then look with what affection
we salute one another, our saluting and greeting one another must be a
testimony and token of our hearty, and unfeigned love to those which we salute.

No doubt we will easily yield that to salute one another is our duty, and we
so do, as occasion is offered, Reproof of those who yield to others only a
verbal and complementall salutation.
but is thy saluting of an other at all times a fruit of thy true love to them
whom thou salutest? I fear me it is not so in some, they salute others, and
seem kindly and friendly to greet them, but their salutation is many times,
(as we use to say) but from the teeth outward, it comes not from any true love
of the heart, especially if there have been a difference, or jar between
them and those whom they salute, or they have conceived some dislike of them,
then their salutation is but as the covetous misers welcome, Proverb. 23.7. as
though he thought it in his heart, he says to his guest, eat and drink, but
his heart is not with him, so they salute others with whom they live, and
(happily) ask them how they do, but it is like Ioabs saluting of Amasa, 2.
Sam. 20.9. they carry within a wicked purpose, and mischievous heart against
them, yea some think it sufficient if they yield a verbal greeting of those
with whom they live, and stick not to say, I give him or her the time of the
day, when I meet them, I ask them how they do, and what would you have more,
yes, there is more required of thee, thy saluting of others must proceed from
a true love of them, it must be a fruit ishuing out of that love, and to that
end consider thus much.

Motives to stir us up to salute others heartily.
For the first table of the commandments is fulfilled in the second, and the
duties of the second, are plain evidences of the duties of the first, and he
that says he loves God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for how can he
that loves not his brother whom he has seen, love God whom he has not
seen, 1. Ioh. 4.20. Pet. 1.22. seeing your souls are purified in obeying the
truth through the Spirit to love brotherly without faining, love one another
with a pure heart fervently.

If then thou would be loath to dissemble with God, and if thou would not
discover that thou art yet in the dregs of nature, and not sanctified by the
word and spirit of God, then let thy heart and tongue ever go together in thy
saluting of others, take heed of formal saluting of any: Let thy saluting and
greeting of others ever proceed from inward affection and be an evidence and
testimony of thy unfeigned love to those whom thou salutest.

In the next place we are more specially to mark, that the Apostle to provoke
the Colossians to love, and honor Aristarcus, as he out of his love saluted
them, describes him by his imprisonment with himself, that he had gone through
many troubles, and now was his prison fellow, whence we may note thus much.

That the constant suffering of men, and namely the The constant suffering of
men and their imprisonment ought to move us to love and to honor them above
other professors.
yea to honor them above other men, yea above other professors of the Gospel,
we find that the Apostle thus set forth Andronicus and Iunia his Cosens Romans
16.7. And Epaphras Philem. Epist. verse. 23. and indeed ought we not exceedingly
to love, and in love to honor, and respect them, who being free, are content to
become bound for the Gospel sake, and are most faithful, and fast to Gods
truth, and ought we not exceedingly to honor those whom the God of glory has
so highly honored, as to choose them out from among the common sort of soldiers,
to be as it were his champions to stand out in the defense of his truth,
against all gainesaiers? certainly we ought.

And therefore take heed thy thoughts be not like the thoughts of the world,
do not thou think they are fools, We are not to think as the world does
touching those that are imprisoned for the truth of God.
as the world, and as carnal minded men think of them, but remember the words
of the Apostle Phil. 1.29. To you it is given for Christ, that not only ye
should believe in him, but also suffer for his sake.

The Apostle would have us to know that it is a special favor which none
attain to, but they to whom it is given and granted by special privilege
from the Lord, and that it is a special honor vouchsafed to some, to suffer
for the truth of God, and thou art to discern that honor and to see it shining
through the thick cloud of their sufferings, and thou art to honor, and to
esteem them the more, whom the Lord has so honored, otherwise thou look
not on them with a right eye, and thy heart is not right within thee.

Observe further in that the Apostle calls Aristarchus his prison fellow we
may easily, and we must needs conceive, that the Apostle had a companion, and
fellow, one that did partake with him in his suffering, and did suffer the same
things with him, and hence we may raise this point of doctrine.

The same afflictions befall diverse of Gods children.
that which one of Gods children suffers, another, yea it may be many others
suffer the like, the cup of affliction in any kind, is not tempered, and
appropriated to one child of God alone, but it is made ready for many of them,
as the father himself shall judge fit, and many of Gods children drink of the
same cup of affliction, no child of God is singular in his suffering, but he
may find out a fellow sufferer, if he look abroad into the world, and into
the state of Gods children in former times.

Genesis 26.1. The text says there was a famine in the land besides the first
famine that was in the days of Abraham, plainly showing, that the Lord tried
Izhak with the same affliction of famine, that he had tried Abraham his father
withal. Heb. 11.36. The holy Ghost says others have been tried by mockings,
and scourgings, yea moreover by bonds and imprisonments, giving us to
understand, that howsoever the Saints suffered some one kind of affliction,
and some another, yet no kind of affliction was laid on any one alone, but
others were fellow sufferers with him, and endured the like, we see it then a
clear point.



And this (for the use) may serve as a ground of great comfort to a child of
God in time of some grievous affliction, Comfort to Gods children in time of
their grievous afflictions.
as the common saying is, it is a comfort to such as be in misery to have a
companion in their suffering.

And (indeed) there is matter of comfort to a child of God in time of his
affliction in this, that no other burden is laid on him then was before, or
(happily) now is borne by other of Gods children, and that he may (if he will)
find out a fellow-sufferer one that is like to himself in suffering, in time
of great affliction, Satan will be busy with a weak Christian, and go about
to persuade him, and to fasten it upon him, that never any but he took up that
cross, or at least, was afflicted as he is, and sometimes he does work that
persuasion into the hearts of some that are weak, and they stick not to utter
it, and to cry out, as the Church did, Lamen. 1.12. was there ever any sorrow
like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the Lord has afflicted me
in the day of his fierce wrath: Oh never man nor woman suffered as I suffer,
never any felt and endured that which I feel, and endure. Thou art deceived
whosoever thou art, this is but out of thy weakness, it is not so, if thou be
a child of God know it for a certain truth, what thou do abide, others of
Gods children in like sort have abiden, and thy suffering, and measure of
affliction, is no more a token of Gods displeasure to thee then this was to
them, but both to thee, and them it is his messenger in love, for the exercise
of thy faith, the trial of thy patience, or some other good end, the Apostle
Peter speaks plain to this purpose 1. Pet. 5.9. Resist the (devil) steadfast
in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your
brethren, which are in the world. If then Satan be busy with thee in time of
thy affliction, and tell thee thou art an odd person, and thou differest from
all Gods children in thy suffering, and that the Lord never dealt so with any
of his children, tell him he is a liar as he has been. The Apostle whom thou
ought to believe has taught thee another lesson, that the same afflictions
are accomplished in thy brethren, which are in thee, although thou know them
not, and therefore thou art no odd person, thou differest not from all Gods
children in thy suffering, ever remember it in time of thy grievous affliction,
that no other trial, or affliction, is upon thee, then has been, or now is
endured by other of Gods children, and thou art no otherwise chastised then
with that rod that has been laid on their backs, whose salvation is sure,
and thou shall find it will be a notable comfort to thee.

We are further to observe that the Apostle describing Marcus, and commending
him to the Colossians, he sets him out by his kindred, that he was Barnabas
sisters son, that he was kinsman to Barnabas, that worthy servant of the Lord,
and in that respect to be esteemed, hence we may easily gather thus much.

It is a matter of honor and dignity to be of the kindred of such as are godly
and worthy instruments of Gods glory.


And hence it is that the Apostle not only here, but elsewhere remembers this
title of honor, as Romans 16.7. Andronicus nnd Iunia my Cosins, verse, 11.
Herodian my kinsman verse 21. Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my Kinsmen
whereby the holy ghost would teach us to esteem it as an excellent honor to be
of the kindred to a godly man, see then by this briefly, the great force of
true piety and the accoumpt it is of with the Lord, it is sufficient not only
to get honor to those that have it with all that are able to judge aright, but
also to all their kindred, and such as be True piety is not only an honor to
those that have it, but it brings honor also to all their kindred.
and after an holy manner even boast in it, that they have worthy servants of
God to their kinsmen, and much more to their parents, that they are the
children of godly parents, yet so as that by their example they be stirred up
to the like godliness, else that honor will turn into their shame, both
before God, and men, for as Solomon says of age Proverb. 16.31. Age is a
crown of glory when it is found in the way of righteousness.

So to be kinsman to some worthy servant of God, or descended of godly
Parents, is a crown of glory, if it be set on the head of one that is godly
and religious himself, else it is rather a dishonor unto him, and without
Gods mercy, it shall increase his condemnation.

Again, is it an honor to be of the kindred to holy men It is the greatest
honor that can be, to be brother to the Lord Jesus, and the adopted son or
daughter of God his father, in and through him.
that is the highest degree of honor that can be vouchsafed to any; worldly
men esteem it great honor to be of the kindred of noblemen, and great men in
the world, but alas, it is but a shadow, or rather not so much as a shadow,
compared to the true honor of the least of Gods Saints, to be brethren to
Christ, and the adopted sons and daughters of God, and therefore let thy
heart be affected with that honor, and be thou even ambitious, in seeking
after tbat above all things in the world.

The Apostle further affirms that touching Marcus, the Colossians had received
commandments, that if he came unto them, they should receive him, they had
been written unto concerning him, they had received letters (no doubt of
commendation touching him, and letters giving order and charge to them, and
commanding them in the Lord, as the Apostle says Philem. 8. verse, though I be
very bold in Christ, to command thee that which is convenient, so they had
received letters (it may be) from the Apostle, by virtue of his Apostleshippe,
commanding them, if Marcus, now a true and faithful servant of Christ came
unto them, they should give him kind and respective entertainment: See then
in the Apostle an excellent example of Christian behavior, toward such as
having formerly offended, are now truly humbled for their offense, and show
forth evident signs of their repentance for the same. Though John Mark had
made defection not from Christ and Christian faith, but from the labor and
work of it, from going with Paul and Barnabas to the work of the Lord, and
therefore grievously offended, yet now having repented himself of his sin,
and testified his repentance by his sincere care to promote the Gospel of
Christ, the Apostle did put clean out of his mind, his former offense, and
esteemed him as a true and faithful servant of Christ, and did commend him to
the Church by his letters, he writ letters of commendation on his behalf, yea
(as it may seem) he used his Apostolical power, in charging them to whom he
writ, that if John Mark came unto them, they should receive him, we see then no
former offenses should be remembered after the heart is truly touched for
them, and repentance made known by infallible tokens, this point we lately
stood on.

I will now only add thus much.

After mutual reconciliation between parties that have been at difference,
all former offenses ought to be clean forgotten, and there ought to be a
doing good one to another, as occasion is offered.


And therefore do not thou say as commonly men use to say, I will forgive him,
and I will be friends with him, but I will neither meddle nor make with him, I
will neither buy nor sell with him, I will have nothing to do with him, A
common saying amongst men justly taxed.
there is no sound reconciliation; Upon sound and true reconciliation, there
must follow a speaking, and a writing for the good of the party that has
offended us, yea, a doing good to him, as occasion shall be offered, if that
follow not, certainly, there is no sound reconciliation, no reconciliation
pleasing to God, and comfortable to thine own soul.

Now further in that the Apostle says, that touching John Mark, the
Colossians had received commandments, or letters of commendation, and had
been written unto in his behalf: we may see.

That letters commendatory may lawfully be given unto Letters* of commendation
may lawfully be given to men.
certificates and testimonies in writing, touching the virtue, and good life,
and conversation of men, for their better entertainment in strange places may
lawfully be granted.

We find that the Apostle thus yielded commendations to Phoebe in his epistle
Romans 16.1. I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, an it was an ancient custom
in the primitive Church, to give to some both professors and Preachers of the
Gospel, letters of commendation, as we may gather, 1. Cor. 16.3. 2. Cor. 3.1.
which (indeed) the Apostle there says, he needed not to, or from the
Corinthians, because their conversion was his letter of commendation, need we
(says he) as some other, Epistles of recommendation, unto you or letters of
recommendation from you, verse 2. ye are our Epistle written in our hearts,
which is understood and read of all, yet thereby he shows it was the manner of
the Church, to give letters of recommendation to some in those times: and so it
is still lawful for the Church, and Governors of it, to give and grant
letters of recommendation to some in these days, if so be they be careful to
certify nothing but the truth, and to commend none but such as are worthy to
be commended, How and to whom letters of commen^dation may be given.
it is a gross abuse that has crept into the Church, that many rouers and
wanderers, who have been spued out of some place for some enormious sin, they
come to other places where they are not known, bringing with them, letters of
large commendation, they bring many goodly virtues written down in their
papers, when notwithstanding a man may see many foul vices abounding in their
lives.

The giving of letters com^ (...)
it does much hurt in the Church, especially if the persons so commended be in
the ministry, then they (...) given him for the notable uprightness, and just
dealing used by him.

It may be will some say,

(...) indeed* name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.

(Jesus) may not be given to any child, at his baptism: and indeed, it is a
presumptuous, The Ie^uites justly taxed for their bold presumption in taking to
themselves the name of Jesuits.
and bold part, of that pestilent brood of the Jesuits, to take to themselves,
the name and title of Jesuits: that being a name, and title derived from the
name (Jesus) the proper name of our Lord Christ, which ought not so much as by
deriuation, to be put upon any creature whatsoever. Obect.
Happily they will say, that we take to our selves, the name of Christians,
which is a name derived from Christ, and why then may not they take the name
(Jesuit) derived from the name Jesus.

Antioch: not by the device of man, but by divine oracle, as the word there
used signifies, but we find no warrant for the name, Jesuit, in the book
of God, and certainly, it is a monstrous boldness and presumption, to
arrogate and assume that name, that being derived from the most high and
glorious name (Jesus) a name above every name, Phil. 2.9.

Names of special signification may now be given to children.
But to make some use of this to our selves: howsoever we may not now give the
name JESUS to any child at his baptism, yet as that name being a name of
special signification, was given to some in time of the old Testament: so now
may we give names to our children, that signify and put us in mind of good
things: we may give names to preserve the memory of something, to preserve the
name and memory of parents, or kindred: especially if they have been godly, and
religious: or to revive the remembrance of the life and profession of good men,
by renewing their names.

The use we are to make of our a mes given us at our baptism.
And we must know that though our names, that have been given us at our
baptism, be not of some special signification, yet they should put us in
mind of our new birth: they were given at the sacrament of regeneration, and
new birth, and whenever they are recited, they should put us in mind of
that, and of that vow and promise we made to God at our baptism, when thy name
was imposed on thee, and registered in the roll of Christians, thou did
promise in the sight of God, of his Angels, and of his people, to forsake the
devil and all his works: and whenever thy name is repeated, thou should
call to mind that vow, and endeavor to perform it: and if thou do not,
surely, thy very name shall one day be a witness against thee, and increase
thy judgment.

Now further in that this Jesus was surnamed (Iustus) or Just: in that he had
gotten such an honorable title among the Romans, as to be called Iustus, and
through his notable upright and just dealing amongst them, it teaches us thus
much.

That the Lord vouchsafes titles of honor even in this The Lord vouchsafes
titles of honor to his children even in this world.
such as are true believers, and by their holy and righteous conversation,
seek glory and honor: the Lord does crown them with honor, they have many
times excellent epithites, and titles of true honor given them, even in this
world. We may see it, not only in this man, but in other examples also: we
find that Abraham is called (faithful Abraham) he has that honorable title
vouchsafed him by the Apostle, Galat: 3.9. and he is known by it to all
nations. Thus Noah was called a Preacher of righteousness, 2. Pet: 2.5. and
Lot (just Lot) the same chapter and 7. verse: and thus the children of God are
usually commended for some excellent virtue in them: yea certainly, by what
gift, grace, Note.
or virtue soever the children of God and true believers, do most of all
glorify God, in the same does the Lord commonly vouchsafe them honor, and
cause them to be reverenced, and magnified, even in this world. Thus Joseph
for his wisdom, by which he much glorified god, was had in honor with
Pharaoh, and the profane Egyptians, Genesis 41.38.39. Can we find such a one as
this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God has showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise
as thou art. Thus Phinehas for his zeal in executing gods judgments; was
renowned from generation to generation, Psalm. 106.31. And on the contrary,
wherein wicked men most of all dishonor God, therein commonly the Lord does
cause them to be branded with a note of infamy, even in this world, as
Jeroboam has often that black mark set upon him, Jeroboam the son of Nebat
that made Israel to sin, it became as a surname to him. And Judas is often
branded with that foul blemish of treason, Judas the traitor, or Judas
Iscariot, that betrayed Christ, and the reason and ground of this is.

Elie, 1 Samuel: 2.30. says the Lord to him, they that honor me I will honor,
and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. The Lord will certainly
honor them that honor him, and he will bring shame and disgrace on them that
dishonor him.



The right way to get honor and estimation in the world.
no doubt thou do, for (indeed) a good name and good estimation in this
world, is much to be desired, Prou: 22.1. it is to be chosen above great
riches, and above gold; why then seek it not in fleshly courses, but in the
love of God, and of his word, in the love of his truth, and in approouing thy
self both to god and man, in well-doing, that is the way to get the title of
honor.

well-doing, they are counted as the basest, and as the offscowring of all
things; they are pointed at with the finger, nicknamed, and many ways abused.

It is true (indeed,) but we must know, Note.
yea sometimes thou shall be honored in the conscience of some, whose tongues
do smite thee: and therefore if thou be one that do strive to keep faith and
good conscience, and to approve thy self in well doing to god and man, be
stird up and encouraged to do it more, undoubtedly the Lord will cause thy
righteousness to shine as the light, Psalm 37.6. it shall be as clear as the
light, to the eyes of all that look on thee, and shall shine brighter and
brighter: thou shall have increase of honor, ^n this present world, and thou
shall find, through Gods mercy everlasting honor, and an eternal weight of
glory bestowed upon thee in the life to come.

The Apostle having thus commended and set forth these three, Aristarcus,
Marcus, and Jesus, by things proper to them, severally: he comes to commend
and set them forth by things common to all three, jointly together: as first,

Interpretation.
That they were of the circumcision, (that is) of the race of the Jews,
naturally descended of the Jews: for so are the Jews, many times, expressed
in the new Testament, under that name or title, Circumcision. Rom: 3.30. it is
one God who shall justify circumcision of faith, (that is) the Jews, as
appears verse: before; so Titus 1.10. There are many (says the Apostle)
disobedient, and vain talkers, and deceivers of minds, chiefly ^hey of the
circumcision, (that is) the Jews.

Now in that the Apostle commended these three, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Jesus,
being now converted to the faith, and being now believing Christians, that they
were of the lineage and race of the Jews, we are given to understand thus much.

True believing Jews may challenge it as an honor to them that they are
descended of such ancestors
that they are come of them, who were a people, with whom the Lord made a
special covenant.

For howsoever the body of that people generally, fell away by their unbelief:
yet that lets not, but that the remnant of them which believe, have some kind
of privilege above other people. The Apostle demanding, Rom: 3.1. What is
then the preferment of the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision? he
answers himself in the second verse: much every manner of way, for chiefly
because unto them were committed the Oracles of God: for what (says he) though
some did not believe, shall their unbelief make the faith of God without
effect? God forbid. The believing gentiles are become sons of God together
with the believing Jews: yet so as the Jews, are (as it were) the first
borne, and the elder brother of the two: the gentiles are not true branches of
the Lords olive, but such as of wild olive branches are naturalized: whereas
the Jews were natural branches: and to the Jews was the gospel first
preached by the commandment of Christ, Matthew: 10 6. and from them it proceeded
to the gentiles: and the Apostle reckons up many privileges of the Jews, To:
9.4. that to them pertaines the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and
the giving of the Law, and the service of God, and the promises. therefore
(doubtless) it is a matter of honor to true believing Jews, that they are
descended of such progenitors: and this must first teach us.

Not to hate the Jews (as many do) because they are The believing Jews are
not to be hated, because they are Jews, but they are the more to be loved
even in that respect.
and christian faith: but if they be true believers, then to love them the
more, because they are Jews: and seeing the Lord made such a special covenant
with that people, and vouchsafed them such excellent prerogatives, and that
they are descended of the holy Patriarchs according to the flesh: in that
respect, we are to love them, though they be yet uncalled, and to wish them
well, and to pray for their calling, and for their conversion.

Again, it is a matter of honor to the true believing

We may see then, that descent from excellent and worthy ancestors, and from
such as have many privileges joined with true faith, is (indeed) a matter of
honor and dignity; To be descended of excellent and worthy ancestors, is an
honor and dignity, when it is joined with true faith in Christ
bare descent from such ancestors is no matter of honor at all, unless it be
joined with true faith, but concurring, and meeting together with true faith in
Christ, it is a matter of great honor, yea certainly, in whom there is true
faith in Christ, Note.
though the person believing be not of the Jews (which is our case) yet to him
(as one says well) all the nobility of Christ his ancestors according to the
flesh, is communicated, to one that believes in Christ, be he Jew, or Gentile,
even the Fathers and ancestors of Christ, according to the flesh, are made his
ancestors, and he is honorable in them.

Abraham is his father, as the Apostle says plainly, Gal. 3.7. They which are
of faith, the same are the children of Abraham, but one that believes not in
Christ, though he be a Jew by natural birth, yet he is not to be esteemed as
a true child of Abraham, as the Apostle likewise says, Romans 9.6. All are not
Israel, which are of Israel; and it is no matter of honor to such an one to
be descended of the Jews according to the flesh, and so in like case, admit it
to be true that our adversaries, the Papists say, that their Pope, and their
Bishops are successors of Peter, and of the Apostles, yet that personal
sucession is nothing worth, Personal succession is nothing worth without the
truth of faith.
that is no matter of honor, except they can show some good evidence that they
likewise succeed them in the true faith of Christ, which they are never able to
do; indeed, personal succession is of some worth, and to be esteemed of, and
we reverently esteem of it, if so be true faith in Christ concur and meet
with it, but to use the bare plea of antiquity, and of personal succession,
without the truth of faith, is but a vain brag, and an empty title without
honor.

Interpretation.
Come we to the second thing common to these three men, Aristarcus, Marcus, and
Jesus, whereby the Apostle commends them to the Colossians that these only
were his worke-fellowes unto the kingdom of God; that word of restraint
(only) is to be understood with limitation to the Jews, as if the Apostle had
said these only of the Jews, or these only among them of the circumcision,
are my workefellowes (that is) join not only their hearts, but their hands,
even all their force and abilities, with me to the furtherance of Gods
kingdom, and do (indeed) with me, further, and help forward the kingdom of
God, the Apostle speaks in the time present they are my worke-fellowes, (unto
the kingdom of God)

The Kingdom of God in Scripture, has many acceptions, I forbear to speak
of them, here it signifies the Gospel, or the whole word of God, the doctrine
of the Prophets, and Apostles, and especially, the doctrine of the Gospel.

And that it may thus be expounded, we have warrant for it, Act. 28.23, Where
it is said, that Paul expounded to them that came unto him, and testified the
kingdom of God; then presently is added, by way of exposition, and preached
unto them concerning Jesus, taught them the doctrine of the Gospel. And
again, verse 31. Preaching the kingdom of God, and then follows, and
teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.

Whence it is clear, that the Kingdom of God is sometimes put for doctrine of
the Gospel, for (indeed) the doctrine of the Gospel is the Scepter of Gods
kingdom, Mar. 1.14. Isai. 1.4.53.1.
and the special means whereby he reigns among us, in which respect the
Gospel is called the Gospel of the kingdom, and the rod of his mouth, and
the breath of his lips to slay the wicked, and the arm of the Lord.

Thus then we are to conceive these words, (these only are my worke-fellowes
unto the kingdom of God*) as if the Apostle had said.

These only among the Jews, join their hearts and hands, even all their
force, and abilities with me, to the furtherance of the Gospel, and do
(indeed) with me further, help forward, and promote the doctrine of the
Gospel. Now, first in that the Apostle thus commended these three men,
Aristarcus, Mark, and Jesus, that they were his worke-fellowes to the kingdom
of God, in that he gave them this commendation, that they joined hearts and
hands together with him, in furthering and advancing the kingdom of God, in
helping forward, and promoting the doctrine of the Gospel.



That it is an excellent and commendable thing, when men join together in the
work of the Lord, when men join their hearts, and hands, even all their
force, and abilities together, in advancing the kingdom of God, It is an
excellent thing when men join their hearts and hands together in advancing the
kingdom of God
in helping forward, and promoting the doctrine of the Gospel, it is a matter
most excellent and commendable.

For why? We know that a combination, and association, and ioining together of
men, in any good work, is an excellent thing, deserving commendation, and the
better the work is the greater commendation is it for men to join their hearts
and hands together in the furthering of it.

Gal. 2.9.) Give the right hand of fellowship one to another, and join
together as one man in advancing Gods kingdom, when they join their studies,
their labors, their learning, their utterance, their teaching, their writing,
and all their abilities to the furtherance of the Gospel.

We are to pray that the ministers of the Gospel may join together as one
man in advancing Gods kingdom.
yea that is a special thing we do pray for, if we pray aright when we use
that petition, Let thy kingdom come. We are to pray to the Lord that the
differences amongst the Ministers of the Gospel may be compounded, and that
they may join hearts and hands and all their forces together, for the
advancement of Gods kingdom, and for the beating down of the kingdom of
sin, Satan, and Antichrist, that they may join together as one man against
the enemy of our salvation, and against all the adversaries of our comfort.

Again, is it an excellent thing when men join hearts A vile and
discomme^dable thing it is, when men join hands and hearts together to hinder
the doctrine of the Gospel.
that is a fearful high degree of sin, that is to be work-fellowes, not to
the kingdom of God, but to the Kingdom of the Devil: Do thou join hands
with othets, to hinder the doctrine of the Gospel? Do thou together with
others oppose the spreading of the Gospel, and course of good things? A thing
too common in the world, if the grace of the Gospel do but peer out, and begin
to appear in any, presently men band themselves against it, they
discountenance it, and they join all their force and strength against it? do
thou, I say, join hand with such persons? Surely then, thou make thy self
guilty of a fearful and high degree of sin, and thou prouokest the Lord to
heavy wrath against thee: consider that place 1 Thessalonians. 2.16. The Apostle there
says that the Jews in hindering the course and spreading of the Gospel to
the Gentiles, filled up the measure of their sin, and it was a token that the
wrath of God was come on them to the utmost; would not thou then fill up the
measure of thy sin, and make it even ripe and ready for judgment? Would
thou not seal it up to the terror of thine own soul, that Gods wrath is
already ceased upon thee, and that the Lord already sits in judgment on thee?
then be not thou a worke-fellow with those that openly hinder the course of the
Gospel, and do not thou join hands with them that oppose the grace of the
Gospel, and good things, take thou heed of so foul a sin.

Now more specially in the next place we are to mark, that the Apostle calls
not these men his fellow-wellwishers, or such as had only as good a will to
the furtherance of the Gospel, as himself, but he calls them his
fellow-workers, he says, they were such as did some thing together with him,
to the advancement of Gods kingdom, and to the furtherance of the Gospel.

Hence we may gather this conclusion.

It is not enough for us to wish as well as others to the ^urtherance of the
G^spell, but we must do some thing together with them that labor that way.
we must put our helping hands to that work, we must join hands with them
the tendeuour and labor to advance the kingdom of God, yea though we be but
private persons, yet must we do something together with the Minister, that may
serve to help forward the kingdom of God, and may further the Gospel.

This we find that Aquila and Priscilla being tent-makers, and one of them a
woman, yet were they the Apostles fe^low-workers, so he calls them, Rom,
16.3. The original word is the same that is here used, they labored together
with the Apostle: so again, verse 9. of that Chapter, he calls Vrbanus his
fellow-helper in Christ, and thus Marcus, Aristarcus, Demas, and Luke, his
fellow-helpers, Philem: Epist. verse. 24.

Such as only wish well to the doctrine of the Gospel and yet help ^t not
forward any thing at all, are reproved.
wishing that things were well, and saying, oh that men would yield to the
Doctrine of the Gospel, and to the things they are taught in the public
ministry of the word, then it were an happy thing, then all would be well,
but alas, few there be that help forward any thing at all that way, few there
be that join hands with the Minister, to help forward the kingdom of God.

And it may be, some think it is a matter not belonging to them, to help
forward the Doctrine of the Gospel, but that it pertaines only to the
Minister: indeed principally it belong to him, but thou must know, it belongs
to thee also, being a private person in thy place and calling, thou must within
the compass of thy calling, It belongs to private persons within compass of
their callings to help forward the doctrine of the Gospel.
be a fellow-worker with the Minister to the advancement of Gods kingdom, and
promoting of the Doctrine of the Gospel.

Alas, how shall I that am a poor man be a fellow-worker with the Minister,
and help forward,

Thou may be so many ways, by instruction, In two things especially, may
pr^uate persons help forward the doctrine of the Gospel.
and the like; but especially by these two things.

1 First, by remembering the doctrine delivered by the Minister, and conferring
upon that, and even whetting that upon thy children, servants, friends, or
neighbors, as the Lord commanded his people, Deuteronomy. 6.7. And thou shall (...) *
rehearse (the word signifies to sharpen) them continually unto thy children,
and thou shall talk of them when thou tarriest in thine house, and as thou
walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up.

2 Secondly, by earnest and hearty prayer to God for a free passage of the
Gospel, 2 Thessalonians. 3.1. Pray (says the Apostle) that the word of the Lord may
have free passage, and be glorified even as it is with you.

These two ways, thou art especially to join hands with the Minister, and
become a fellow worker with him, in the advancement of Gods kingdom, and to
further the advancement of the Gospel. Two motives to stir up private persons
to help forward the doctrine of the Gospel.


And to stir thee up to this duty, consider only these two things.

1 First, where there is conscience of this duty, experience show i, there is
much profit by the public ministry of the word, and where this is neglected,
there is little or no good done by the most faithful, and powerful ministry
of the word, the Minister may spend his heart out of his body, and do little
good, if he have no worke-fellowes to help forward the doctrine of the Gospel.

2 Again, consider that thou praiest to the Lord that his kingdom may be
advanced; thou say, Let thy kingdom come, and yet have thou no care to
help forward Gods kingdom? What is this but to mock God, who cannot be
mocked, and to deceive thine own soul? Thou do by that prayer of thine
(thou not caring to help forward Gods kingdom) provoke the Lord to wrath
against thee, and of thine own lips he will one day judge thee

If thou then desire that the ministry and preaching of the word of God should
be much profitable to thy children, thy servants, and others; yea, if thou
would not provoke the Lord to punish thee, as a mocker of his majesty, and
of thine own mouth to judge and condemn thee. Then be thou stird up to carry
in thee a conscience of this duty, be thou a fellow-worker with the Minister
to the kingdom of GOD; join hands with him, to help forward the doctrine of
the Gospel, by counsel, by admonition, by consolation, by good example, and
the like, but especially, by whetting the doctrine delivered by him in the
public ministry of the word, up- thy children, thy servants, and others, and
by earnest and hearty prayer for a blessing upon the preaching of the Gospel,
and thou shall find much comfort in so doing.

Further observe we (in a word) the Apostle says, these only among the Jews,
were his worke-fellowes to the kingdom of God.

Peter was either not at Rome when this Epistle was written, or else he was much
too blame.
Where then was Peter, it is like he was not at Rome when the Apostle writ this
Epistle, whether he was there at all, or no, I will not dispute, but it cannot
be that he sat there as Bishop 25. years, as the Papists hold, as an
Article of cheir Creed, either he was not at Rome when this Epistle was
written, or else he carried himself little better, then when he denied his
Master.

One thing yet remains to be considered of us, namely, the form, and manner
of speech here used by the Apostle, (The kingdom of God) he puts down the
kingdom of God, for the doctrine of the word and Gospel.

The point hence offered is this.

That the doctrine of the word, and especially the doctrine The doctrine of the
word and Gospel is that whereby God does rule and reign amongst us, and over
us, in special manner.
for by his universal government and providence, he rules over all things,
both in heaven and earth, yea over the Devils and damned in hell, as the
Psalmist says, Psalm. 29.10. the Lord remains a king for ever, but in special
manner does the Lord rule and reign, by the doctrine of his word and Gospel,
by that does he exercise his kingly power and authority over his Church and
children.

And hence is the doctrine of the Gospel called the power of God, 1. Cor.
1.18. and verse 24. the power of God, and the wisdom of God, yea, hence it
was that our Savior said, John 5.25. that the hour should come, and then was,
that the dead should hear the voice of the son of God, and should live. The
Lord does rule and work so powerfully by the doctrine of his word and gospel,
as that thereby he quickens, and gives life to the dead, even to such as are
dead in their sins, and makes them live a new spiritual life, and yield
obedience and subjection to him, and therefore by that does he rule and reign
amongst us, and over us, in special manner, and the reason of this is this.

The word and gospel, is one of the laws of Gods kingdom of grace, and hence
is the word, the doctrine of the gospel, called the word of the kingdom, Mat.
13.19. and the law of faith, Romans 3.27. where is then the rejoicing (says the
Apostle) it is excluded, by what law? of works? nay, but by the law of faith,
by the doctrine of the gospel.

Now as an earthly King does rule and reign over his subjects, and keeps them
in awe and order, in special manner by the laws of his Kingdom, so does the
Lord by his word and Gospel, and of the Laws of his Kingdom of grace, and
therefore by that does he in special manner rule and reign amongst us, and
exercise his kingly power over his Church and children, hence then it must
needs follow, that the more or less the doctrine of the word and Gospel,
Trial of our selves, whether we be under the special government of the Lord
or no.
if the doctrine of the word and Gospel be powerful and effectual amongst
us, then does the Lord rule and reign amongst us, in special manner, as our
King and Governor, if that be powerless and fruitless, and if that have no
power nor fruit amongst us, surely then the Lord reigns not amongst us in
special manner, the Lord is then in no other sort our King and Governor, but
as he is King over the reprobates, yea, over the Devils, and damned in hell,
even by his general providence, yea, let every one in particular examine
himself touching this point, does the Lord rule and reign over thee, and in
thee by the doctrine of his word and Gospel? then is he thy King and Governor,
in special manner, if he do not so reign and rule over thee, and in thee,
certainly thou art not under his special regiment and government, and thou
must know it is not enough for thee, only to have understanding of the letter
of the word and gospel, but thou must know and feel the power of it.

The doctrine of the word and gospel is the kingdom of God, it is in it self
the arm of the Lord, and his ruling power, and it must be so to thee, else
thou art not under his special government, thou must feel the doctrine of the
word and gospel, teaching thee to humble thy self in due consideration of thy
miserable state wherein thou art by nature, and to deny thy self in a true
acknowledgment of thine own corruption, and to lay fast hold upon Christ, who
is the light of thy salvation, yea, thou must find the doctrine of the
gospel, teaching thee (as the Apostle says) Tit. 2.12. to deny ungodliness,
and worldly lusts, to live soberly, and righteously and godly, in this present
world, yea, the power of the gospel must be seen in thy attire, that thou
go comely, not vainly and garishly; in thy speech, that it be gracious, not
idle, wanton or blasphemous, in thy whole carriage, and in all the actions of
thy life.

If the doctrine of the word and gospel be not thus powerful over thee, and
in thee, assuredly, the Lord is not thy King, and governor in special manner,
think on it and hereby examine thy self, and if thou find that thou art not
under the special government of the Lord, thy case is fearful, hasten out of
it, as soon as possibly thou can, thou art in a miserable state, and
condition, thy case is worse then the case of other creatures in the world,
that are subject to the general government and providence of God, for thou art
subject to the power of the Devil, thou art his slave, and the Devil holds
up his scepter in thee he is thy Lord, and King, therefore Paul said Act.
26.18. that he was sent to the Gentiles to turn them by the preaching of the
Gospel, from the power of Satan to God, ignorant people and profane persons
cannot abide to hear of this, that the Devil should rule in them, and that he
should be their Lord and King, they spit at the meaning of the Devil, and they
say fie on him, and they defy the Devil with all their heart, but alas, so
long as they live in their ignorance, and profaneness, they are under his
power, so long as thou live in thy pride, thy covetousness, thy usury, thy
maliciousness, thy drunkenness, thy whoredom, thy swearing, or any other
pleasing sin, thou art from under the special government of the Lord, and
the Devil is thy Lord, and King, for there be but two regiments and kingdoms
in this world, the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Satan, and if thou
be not in the kingdom of Christ, thou art in Satan's kingdom.

Again consider that condemnation, and everlasting perdition, is the portion
of all that have not Christ for their head.

Note.
Now Christ is head to none, but such as have their life from him, and none have
life from Christ, but they that are ruled and governed by him, and he rules
none but by the power of his word: and therefore if thou be not ruled and
ordered by the doctrine of the word and Gospel, thou art in a fearful
condition, thou have Satan ruleing over thee, as thy Lord, and King, and thou
art liable to everlasting perdition. Consider this, thou that art an ignorant
person, thou that art a proud person, a drunkard etc. And findinge thy self in
this miserable thraldom, hasten out of it by all possible means, never rest
till thou find, that thou art made subject, to the doctrine of the word, and
Gospel, and that it is powerful in thee: causing thee to lay aside thy former
sin, and turning thee to all holy obedience, then thou may be sure that
thou art under Gods special rule, and government.

Comfort for all that cheerfully subject themselves to the doctrine of the word
and Gospel.
they are under the special rule and government of the Lord; the Lord is their
King, and governor in special manner, and to them as to the true and loyal
subjects of his kingdom, are all the benifits of his kingdom belonging, and
communicated, even the spiritual, and eternal benifites of Christ, as faith,
true conversion, remission of sins, righteousness, the gifts of Gods
spirit, and continuance of the same, glorification, and life eternal, and
they are made partakers of that glory, to be kings, and priests, unto God,
Revel. 16. Which is an excellent comfort, and to be thought on, by all that
truly submit themselves to the doctrine of the word and gospel. And thus we
have handled the second thing, whereby the Apostle commended thse three men,
Aristarcus, Marcus, and Jesus, common to them all, that they only were his
worke-lellowes unto the kingdom of God.

Come we to the third, and last thing, whereby he sets out their commendation
joyntlie together, in the last words of this verse: that they were to his
comfort, and consolation, (which have been unto my consolation) and this in
part is an effect of the former, namely, of their joining hands with him, to
the advancement of the Kingdom of God, and to help forward the doctrine of
the Gospel, therein they were to the Apostles consolation, Interpretation.
the word here rendered consolation, signifies also council and encouragement,
and so the meaning is briefly this.

Which have been to my comfort, to my council, and to my encouragement.

Now for matter of doctrine hence offered, first in that the Apostle says
these three men Aristarchus, Marcus, and Jesus, helping forward the kingdom of
God and furthering the doctrine of the gospel together with himself, were to
his consolation, and did thereby much comfort him, we are given to understand
thus much.

That the aduancers of the kingdom of God, and such

It is a great comfort to the ministers of the Gospel, when they see others
join hands with them to the advancement of gods kingdom, It is a great
comfort to the ministers of the Gospel when they see others join hands with
them to the advancement of Gods kingdom.
and to the furthering of the gospel. For why? If their hearts be rightly
affected, and set as they ought to be for the advancement of Gods glory, if the
first and chief thing they aim at, and seek after, be the kingdom of God,
and his righteousness, it ought to be Math. 6.33. it must needs be that such
as together with themselves, do further, and advance the same, are a great
consolation to them, and minister sweet comfort to their hearts.

The right way to cheer up the heart of a faithful minister is to join hands
with him in advancing Gods kingdom.
and in helping forward the doctrine of the gospel, it may be thou bear
true love to a faithful minister of the gospel, and thou would be glad to
do him any good thou art able, here is the way to do the best good, and to
yield him the greatest comfort, join thy hands with him in advancing the
kingdom of God, and in furthering the doctrine of the gospel, and that will
be an excellent cordial, to the comfort of his heart, thou can not minister
matter of greater joy, and consolation to him, by any thing, then by so doing.

Now further in that the Apostle says these three men, Aristarchus, Marcus,
and Jesus, had been to his consolation and encouragement, and been in steed
of counselors to him in some things, he being an Apostle, and a man of
excellent gifts, and graces, and they no doubt far inferior to him in gifts,
and graces, it teaches us.

Men of great gifts and graces need sometimes encouragement counsel, and
comfort from men of meaner gifts and graces then themselves.


And hence it was that our Apostle said, he longed to see the Romans, Romans
1.12. that he might be comforted together with them, through their mutual
faith, both his and theirs, and (indeed) the reason of this is plain, namely
this.

The Lord does not give all gifts to any one man, nor the like measure of the
same gift to every man, a less measure of the same gift, yea the Lord does
sometimes so dispose his gifts, as that a man of meaner place and fewer gifts,
has some singular and special gift, whereby he may help, and do good to
others, of higher place, and of greater gifts.

This then must teach us not to despise men of meaner gifts then our selves;
Men of meaner gifts then our selves are not to be despised of us.
Do not thou in regard of thine excellent knowledge, wisdom, or any one gift,
or grace of God bestowed on thee, lift up thy self above others, and disdain
to have familiar conference, and speech with men of meaner gifts then thy
self, no, no, do thou stoop down, to confer with them, and to listen to
things said by them, and take thou benefit of some gift, (happily) more
eminent, and in greater measure in them, then in thy self, though thou excel
them in knowledge, yet it may be they go beyond thee in good affections, and
thereby they may do thee good, they may be means to stir up thy zeal, to
quicken thy love, or the like, yea certainly thou may find some good by
having speech, and conference with the meanest of Gods children.

VER. 12 Epaphras the servant of Christ, which is one of you, saluteth you, and
always strives for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and full in all
the will of God.

VER. 13 For I bear him record that he has a great zeal for you, and for
them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis.


The Apostle in this 12. and 13. verses still goes on in the second branch of
his conclusion, namely, the declaration of the love of others that were with
him toward the Colossians, and here he sets down, the love of Epaphras
toward them, manifested, and made known by two things.

By his salutations sent to them, and by his prayers for them. That he saluted
them, and that he prayed for them, Now these things are not thus naked, and
barely propounded, but first the Apostle describes Epaphras, by two qualities
or conditions.

First, by his calling, that he was the servant of Christ.

Secondly, by that particular relation that was between him and the
Colossians, that he was one of them, Epaphras the servant of Christ which is
one of you saluteth you.

And then the Apostle further sets out Epaphras by his praying for the
Colossians.

First, by the manner of his praying, that it was with striuings and earnest
contention, and that continually, in these words, (and always strives for you
in prayers).

Secondly by the matter of his prayer, what it was he prayed for, on their
behalf, namely this, that they might stand perfect, and full in all the will
of God.

And then verse 13. the Apostle does discover the efficient cause of that
earnest striving of Epaphras in prayer, for the Colossians, that it proceeded
from his zeal for them, which zeal of his is further set out by the measure,
that it was great: and by the extent of it, in regard of the persons to whom it
reached, that it reached not only to the Colossians, but also to them of
Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis: and it is also confirmed by the testimony of
the Apostle, I bear him record he has a great zeal for you, etc. in which
testimony is also prevented a secret objection, for happily the Colossians
might have said to the Apostle.

Object: How know you that Epaphras strives in prayer for us, are you privy
to his private prayers, for therein especially, if he do remember us, he
makes mention of us?

Now this objection the Apostle preuents when he says, (for I bear him record
that he has a great zeal for you, etc. as if he had said, howsoever I am not
privy to his private prayers, yet I dare boldly write, that he strives for you
in prayer, because I am privy to, and a witness of a great zeal that he
bears to you, and to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. And thus we see
the general things that are laid down in these two verses.

Come we now to speak of them, as they lie in order, and I will take the words
as they are laid down before us.

First therefore of these words, (Epaphras the servant of Christ, which is one
of you, saluteth you, and always strives for you in prayers.)

Epaphras the servant of Christ] That first title, (servant of Christ) is not
here to be taken in a general signification, as it is common to all the
faithful, who are servants of Christ, 1 Cor. 7.22. but in a special sense,
for the minister of Christ: for so the Apostle called Epaphras, cap: 1.7. and
therefore this title (servant of Christ) is not here given to him as a
quality and condition, Interpretation.
common to him with all true believers: but as signifying his particular office
and function, that he served Christ in the ministry of the gospel* (which
is one of you) how these words are to be taken, we showed verse 9. namely
thus, who is one of the same City and Church with you* (saluteth you) that is,
wishes you health, prosperity, and all true happiness that can be. (And
always strives for you in prayers.) The word strives is metaphorical
borrowed, and taken from such as withstand open violence and hostility: or
from such as earnestly strive for masteries or life, against such as seek to
take it away: and it is here put, to signify earnestness and feruencie of
spirit* (always) that is, whenever he does humble himself in prayer, (which
he does often) he remembers you. Thus then are these words to be conceived, as
if the Apostle had said.

Epaphras that serves Christ in the ministry of the Gospel, who is one of
the same City and Church with you, wish^th you health, prosperity, and all
true h^ppinesse and comfort, and whenever he does humble himself in prayer,
(which he does often) he is mindful of you, and with earnest contention of
mind, and feruencie of spirit, he prays for you. Now first in that the
Apostle calls Epaphras the servant of Christ, thereby meaning the minister of
Christ, or that he served Christ, in the ministry of the gospel, we are
taught thus much.

The Minister of the gospel is in special manner the seru^nt of Christ.
he is Christ his servant in more particular manner, then men of other
callings, it is his profession, and (as it were) his trade, to be the servant
of Christ, even to serve the Lord Jesus, in bringing his message, and his
embassage to the people of God, that is his place and office.

And therefore the Apostle says in plain terms, 2 Cor. 5.20. that the
ministers of the gospel are Ambassadors for Christ, and in Christ his stead do
entreat Gods people to be reconciled unto him, 1 Cor. 4.1. Let a man so think
of us as of the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God; and
hence it is that the Apostle often calls himself and other ministers of the
gospel, the servants of Christ: as Rom: 1.1. Paul a servant of Jesus Christ.
Philipp. 1.1. Paul and Timotheus the servants of Jesus Christ. Titus 1.1. Paul
a servant of God, etc. yea the devil himself plainly and f^eely confessed this
truth, though not in love to the ministers of the gospel. Act: 16.17. These men
are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.

a special duty; Ministers of the gospel must look they deliver nothing, but
that which is according to the will of Christ, and for his glory.
are they in peculiar manner servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and
master? are they sent out from him on his message and embassage? surely then
they must look they deliver nothing but that which is both according to his
will, and for his glory: a good servant will do the will of his Master, and
what his Master appoints him, and what he requires of him, and will seek his
Masters credit in all his courses: and so ought the ministers of the gospel,
ever to have an eye to the will of Christ, their Lord and Master, and to seek
his glory in all things: those ministers forget their office and calling, that
they are the servants of Christ, who deliver their own fancies, and new found
devices, or apply their speeches and teaching to the humors of men, and seek
to please men. Gal: 1.10 If I should yet please men, I were not the servant of
Christ: Ministers that are men-pleasers are not the true servants of Christ.

Again, here is matter of comfort for all true ministers Comfort for all true
Ministers of the gospel.
for why? are they in special manner servants of the Lord Jesus, to whom all
power is given in heaven and in earth, Matthew. 28.18. they may then be bold to
deliver the message the Lord has put into their mouths, they have a Master
will make it good, and they may boldly stand in the face of all that oppose
them and gainsay it, they have a Master that is able and willing to defend
them, and this is an excellent comfort unto them.

Now further, is it so, is a true minister of the gospel in Men are to esteem
the Ministers of the gospel, as the servants of Christ.
then learn thou so to esteem him, even as the servant and ambassador of the
Lord of glory, and take heed thou offer him not the least contempt or wrong, in
word or deed, though he be (happily) poor and weak, yet he has a Master,
that is mighty and powerful, and will mightily revenge the wrong done to his
servants. Ahab, Iezabell, and Julian found it by woeful experience, and no age
or state, can show the contrary, that ever any contemner or abuser of a true
minister of God, escaped the visible vengeance of God, and his revenging hand
on him, or his; therefore take heed how thou do wrong, or abuse a minister
of the Gospel.

I should now speak of two titles the Apostle here gives to Epaphras, (that
he was one of the Colossians) and likewise of his saluting of them, but of
those things we spoke verse 9.10. and therefore I pass by them, and come to
these words (and always strives for you in prayers.) where first, in that the
Apostle says, that Epaphras did strive in prayers for the Colossians, that
whenever he humbled himself in prayer, he prayed for them with earnest
contention of mind, with feruencie of spirit, we are plainly taught.

We must earnestly pray for others together with our selves, and especially
those with whom we stand in special relation.
and with whom we have near conjunction: for Epaphras was the minister of the
Church at Colosse, and he prayed earnestly for the Colossians, as he was their
minister, and so must we be earnest in prayer, for those with whom we stand in
some special relation, and with whom we have near conjunction: as the
Minister for his people, the Magistrate for those that be under his government,
the Master of the house for his family, etc.

We have examples of this in other places of Scripture, as that of Samuel, 1 Samuel 12.23. God forbid (says Samuel) that I should sin against the Lord, and
cease praying for you. Samuel accounted it a sin, if he should cease
praying for the people. And that of Moses, Psalm: 106.23. where it is said, that
he stood in the breach, no doubt by earnest intercession and prayer, to turn
away the Lords wrath from the people: and thus (doubtless) did Job sanctify
his children, by earnest and hearty prayer for them, Job 1.5. and the reason of
this is plain, namely this.

We are to have a lively fellow feeling of the wants and necessities of others,
and as the Apostle says, Cor. 12.25. we ought to have the same care one for
another, as members of the same body, and especially of the wants and
necessities of them, with whom we are more nearly knit and conjoined: and
therefore out of that lively feeling of the wants of others, and especially for
such as are nearly knit unto us by any special bond, we are to send out earnest
and hearty prayers for them, and to call on the Lord even with feruencie of
spirit, for a supply of their wants.

A duty wherein many of us are much defective, Reproof of such as seldom or
never pray for others together with themselves with any earnestnes
many seldom or never pray for others together with themselves with any
earnestness and feruencie of spirit: it may be thou art sometimes earnest in
praying for thy self, necessity, or extremity pressing thee, the hand of God
in some heavy affliction driving thee to it: but in praying for others, oh how
cold art thou? yea (I fear me) I may justly speak it, many seldom or never
use any earnest prayer for their own families, for their own children, and
those that belong unto them: happily thou say, God bless my children, and
God make them his faithful servants, (which I speak not against) but when
did thou strive in prayer for them? when did thou power out thine heart, as
David said he did, Psalm. 42.4. in the behalf of thy children, thy servants, or
for the wife of thy bosom? I appeal to the hearts and consciences of many,
they can tell them, they have seldom or never done it: well remember, this is
thy duty thus to pray for others, together with thy self, and that with
earnestness of spirit, and especially for those, to whom thou owe special
duty, for thy wife, thy children, thy servants: and to that end, consider their
special wants and necessities, and if thou neglect this duty, it is a plain
evidence thou have not such a feeling of other men's wants and necessities, as
thou ought to have, and it is an argument thou art not a lively member of
the same body with them, whereof Christ is the head, and if thou pray not
earnestly for thy wife, children, and servants, and out of a feeling of their
wants, thou have not that love, and that care of them, that ought to be in
thee, and without repentance thou shall one day answer for it; yea many times
it comes to pass, that a man that makes no conscience of this duty, Note.
even to be earnest with the Lord in prayer for supply of such grace, as is
wanting in his wife, children, and servants, he finds the punishing hand of
God upon him in his wife, children, or servants: the Lord does punish him with
an unruly wife, with graceless children, and with lewd servants; therefore
learn then to make conscience of this duty.

Now further in that the Apostle sets down Epaphras his manner of praying for
the Colossians under that metaphorical word (strives) a word borrowed and
taken from such as withstand violence and hostility, or such as strive for
masteries, we are given to understand.

It is no easy thing to pray well.
to pray to God truly and heartily, is no easy matter: true and hearty prayer
is ever with striving, and wrestling against opposition, and it is as hard a
matter to pray truly and heartily, as it is to with stand a strong armed man,
that seeks to take away life from us.

And therefore the Apostle not only here but in other places also, uses this
phrase and form of speech; as To: 15.30. I beseech you for our Lord Jesus
Christ's sake, and for the love of the spirit, that ye would strive with me by
prayers to God for me. and 2 Cor. 1.11. (says he) that ye labor together in
prayer for us, plainly teaching. That true and hearty prayer is with much labor
and striving, Hindrances of true and hearty prayer.
There be many things that oppose, and stand against making of true and hearty
prayer to God, as

First, the malice of Satan, who seeks (if possibly he can) and the like: if he
cannot so do, then he labors to make us hasten out of our prayers, and to
post them over hastily, or to pray coldly or faintly.

Secondly, our own corruption, the deadness and

And therefore deceive not thy self, do not thou think They deceive themselves
which think it is an easy matter to pray well.
and to make hearty prayer to God: no, no, learn this lesson, and remember
it, that to pray truly and heartily, is a thing that is done with as much
pains and labor, as if thou were to wrestle and struggle with a strong man
that seeks thy life: some foolishly think, and they stick not sometimes to
speak it, that having lived many years in scraping wealth together, and
hunting after riches, when they are old, then they will go to the Church and
pray: alas poor souls, how are they blinded, as if it were the easiest matter
in the world, to pray well: indeed, to pray formally, and to say prayers, (as
some use to speak, that they have said their prayers) and you may believe
them, their mouths only have prayed, their hearts prayed not, they prayed not
with any due reverence of the great and glorious majesty of God, with any
sound feeling of their own wants, or with any holy desire of the things prayed
for: and so to pray, is an easy matter indeed: but that is but lip-labor, and
(indeed) lost labor, yea hateful and displeasing to God: remember thou, if
thou would pray well, and so as the Lord may accept thy prayer, that it must
be with much striving, thou must find in thee a striving against the malice
of Satan, and against the deadness and dullness of thine own heart, yea there
must be an holy violence used in thine heart, when thou praiest, and that is to
pray truly and heartily.

Again, is it so, that true and hearty prayer is ever with striving and
wrestling against opposition?

Comfort for such as find sometimes a dullness and deadness upon themselves
in praying.
and dullness creeping upon themselves in the ho^ie exercise of prayer, if so
be they do truly strive against these things; some are much cast down, and
discouraged, and they think their prayers are not pleasing to God, because
they find sometimes in themselves a deadness, and dullness, and many
by-though^s, cast into their minds but consider with thy self, do thou
strive against these? Art thou displeased with them? Do thou sigh and groan
under them, and are they so heavy a burden unto thee, as thou can only
stammer out a prayer unto God? Comfort thy self, even that stammering prayer
of thine is true, and hearty prayer, and well-pleasing to God, thou have an
example for thy comfort in this kind, Isai. 38 14. Like a Crane or a Swallow,
so did I chatter, I did mourn as a Dove. Hezekiah was so pressed with grief,
as that his prayer was only like the chattering of a Crane, he was not able to
utter a perfect sentence, yet was his prayer heard of the Lord; so if thou be
able only to utter a stamering prayer in regard of thy deadness, and
dullness, sometimes creeping upon thee, yet if thou sigh and groan under it,
if thou pray against it, and by all good means strive against it, and look
for the perfection of thy prayers in Christ; assuredly thy prayers are true and
hearty prayers, and well-pleasing in the sight of God, and that is an
excellent comfort to be thought on, by all such as find a deadness and
dullness sometimes creeping on them in prayer, and are displeased with it, and
do truly strive against it.

Before we come to that which follows, a question is to be answered, namely
this.

In that true and hearty prayer is ever with striving against opposition, it
may be demanded, Whether a man may striu in prayer, in a set form of prayer
whether a man may strive in prayer, that uses a set form of prayer.

To this I answer, that he may, a man that is not able to conceive a form of
prayer in words, as some are not, for want of memory, utterance, Note.
and have a feeling of the want of the things that are prayed for: but yet let
not any man herein take liberty to himself, at all times to use a set form
of prayer, for that cannot at all times express his particular wants, and
necessities, and therefore let every one labor that he may be able to conceive
a prayer, and to take to himself words, as it is, Hosea 14.3. And if a man or
woman be suddenly pressed by some calamity, or some sin pressing the
conscience, and that person is not able to conceive a prayer, then let him, or
her, in such a case, rather go to the Lord with sighing, and groaning, with
sighs that he cannot express in words, as the Apostle says, Romans 8.26. then
betake himself to a set form of prayer, which happily makes no mention of that
special grace, he stands in need of.

Come we now to the matter of Epaphras his prayer, what it was he prayed for,
on the behalf of the Colossians, laid down in these words (That ye may stand
perfect and full in all the will of God.)

These words require a little search into them, for the right understanding.

(That ye may stand) The word (stand) as we know, Interpretation.
being applied to men, properly signifies, an action or position of the body
of man, opposed to falling, starting aside, shrinking, or backsliding, but in
Scripture it is often used in a Metaphorical and borrowed sense, signifying,
continuance, constancy, and perseverance, as in the 1. Cor. 16.13. Stand fast
in the faith, etc. the meaning is continue, be constant, and persevere in the
faith, shrink not, start not aside, nor slide back from it, and that that is
his meaning, it is clear, in that he adds, quit you like men, and be
strong, and so it is here to be taken; That ye may stand, (that is) that ye
may continue, abide, and persevere, without shrinking, starting aside, or
backe-sliding, (perfect and full) these words being words of relation (for
where there is a perfection, and fullness, it must needs be a perfection and
fullness of something) we may gather whereunto they have relation by the words
following (in all the will of God) These words considered together with that
prayer of the Apostle, cap. 1.9.10. Where he says, I cease not to pray for
you, and to desire, that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will in
all wisdom and spiritual understanding. By these two places compared
together, we may easily conceive whereunto these words (perfect and full) have
relation, namely, to the knowledge, and obedience to the will of God, as if the
Apostle had said, perfect and full in knowledge, and obedience to the will of
God.

Now severally, that word (perfect) does not here signify absolutely perfect,
in knowledge and obedience to Gods will perfect, with a perfection of knowledge
and obedience, in measure and degree which cannot be reached in this life, but
soundly perfect, with perfection of soundness, and truth opposed to
hypocritical holiness, and emptiness, and so the word (perfect) is often
used in Scripture, Isai. 38.3. Hezekia said, he had walked before the Lord in
truth, and with a perfect heart: he puts these two together, and therefore the
Apostle here adds the word (full) giving us to understand, that he meant such
a perfection, as is opposed to emptiness, and hollownesse. And again, the
word (full) is not here to be taken for an absolute fullness of knowledge and
obedience, in degree, but for a true, and sound fullness, for so also that word
is sometimes, used, as 1 Ioh. 1.4. These things write I unto you that your joy
may be full, (that is) that your joy may be true, sound, and sincere, (in all
the will of God) by the will of God we are to understand, the will of God
revealed, and by (all) is meant, the whole will of GOD revealed.

Thus then briefly are these words to be conceived, as if the Apostle had said.

Epaphras, he prays earnestly for you, that you may continue, persevere, and
go on, sound, and sincere, and truly, though not absolutely, full of
knowledge, and of obedience, to the whole revealed will of God. First, observe
we, that Epaphras here praying to God, and that earnestly, for the Colossians,
that they might continue and persevere, sound, sincere, and truly full of
knowledge and obedience to the will of God. I might hence show that the
faithful, and fervent prayers of others are needful even for such as are
sound, sincere, and truly full of knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, that
they may be strengthened, and may stand fast, persevere, and go on in the
same, and they are to crave the assistance of other men's prayers to that
purpose, but on that I will not stand.

Hence, in that Epaphras prayed that the Colossians might stand perfect and
full in all the will of God, implying that they were already sound, and sincere
in knowledge and obedience to the will of God, and he prayed for their
constancy and continuance in the same.

We may easily gather

That constancy and perseverance in sound knowledge, and in true, and sincere
obedience to Gods will, is the free gift of God, Perseverance in sound
knowledge and in sincere obedience to Gods will, is the free gift of God.
Epaphras prayed for it, that the Lord would give it to the Colossians, it is
not only Gods free gift to be sound in knowledge, and sincere in obedience, but
it is his gift also to stand, continue, and go on in that soundness, and in
that sincerity, the Lord gives to know, and to obey his will, and he gives
continuance in that knowledge and obedience.

And howsoeur, such as have sound and saving knowledge, and sincere obedience
to the will of God, truly wrought in them, shall never wholly fall away from
it, for the fea^e of God is put into their hearts, that they shall not part
from God, Ierem, 32.40. Yet they stand not by any po^er from themselves, but by
the power of God, 1 Pet. 1.5. They are k^pt by the power of God, through faith
unto salvation. It is the power of God that vpholds them, and it is the Spirit
of God that does still stir and move their minds and wills, being already
regenerate, to mind, and to will, that which is truly good, and makes them
able to bring forth good actions, which otherwise, they are not able being
hindered by the flesh, so long as they are in this life. Hence it was that David
after his regeneration, prayed to the Lord to incline his heart unto his
Testimonies; and the Church prays for new drawing, Cantic. 1.4. Draw me, we
will run after thee: and the Apostle witnessing of the Philippians, Phil.
2.12. That they had always obeyed: yet he adds, Verse 13. That it was God
that wrought in them both the will, and the deed, even of his good pleasure, it
was not of themselves that they were able to will or work any

And so he plainly teaches this point.

That to continue in sound knowledge, and sincere obedience to Gods will, and
to go one in the same, is the free gift of God* First, this meets with that
opinion of the Papists, who teach that men regenerate are able to do good, and
to obey the will of God, and to go on without concurrence of new grace
following, That popish opinion confuted, that men regener^^e are able to do
good and to obey Gods will without concurrence of new grace following.
which is a mere falsehood, it cannot stand with the truth now delivered.

For if it be the free gift of God, to continue in sound knowledge and sincere
obedience, certainly then besides the first grace working regeneration, there
must be a subsequent second grace vouchsafed from the Lord, that makes the
regenerate do, and work that good, which they are made able to do by grace, it
cannot be otherwise.

Again, is it so that to continue and persevere in sound Such as are truly
regenerate, are to acknowledge at all times their own impotency and
insufficiency to any good thing.
Then let those in whom the Lord has wrought sound saving knowledge, and a
measure of sincere obedience to his will, ever acknowledge their own impotency
and insufficiency, that though they be truly regenerate, yet they are not,
able to do any good thing, but by a continued supply of new grace, and let them
ever acknowledge that their standing, and perseverance in sound and sincere
obedience to the will of God, is merely from the Lord, and let him have all
the glory, and be thou ever watchful in prayer for constancy, and
perseverance, because thy standing is by grace, and it is the free gift of God.

Now in the next place in that Epaphras prayed so earnestly, and with such
feruency, for no other grace but this, that the Colossians might constantly
continue and persevere, and go on in sound and sincere knowledge, and obedience
to the will of God, we are plainly taught.

That constancy and perseverance in sound, sincere, entire, Constancy and
perseverance in sound knowledge and obedience to Gods will is an excellent
thing.
it is a special grace for such as are sound and sincere in knowledge, and
obedience to the will of God, to stand fast, to continue, and to go on in the
same, without starting aside, or backe-sliding.

We find in the Scripture many exhortations, and sentences to this purpose, as
that 1. Cor. 16.13. stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, and be strong,
and that Revel. 2.10. be thou faithful unto the death and I will give thee the
crown of life, and this warning has our savior given Luke 9.62. Luke. 9.62.
he that puts his hand to the plough and but looks back is not apt for
the kingdom of God, Paul blamed the Galathians Gal. 3.3. and called them
foolish, for beginning in the spirit, and then seeking to be m^de perfect in
the flesh, for not holding on as they had begun, many other places of
scripture beat upon this point, and persuade to continuance, and perseverance
in grace, and holy obedience, as a most excellent thing, and a special grace,
and the reason of it is this.

no sin condemns a man but his final impenitencie, Note.
a final continuance in his sin, so no grace, or virtue shall be crowned,
but that which continues to the end.

It is only continuance, and perseverance in faith, in love, in the fear of
God, and in profession of religion, that shall be crowned with glory, we shall
find it most true which the Prophet speaks Ezechiell 18.24. If a righteous
man of a hundred years old forsake his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and
do according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, the Lord will
also forget all his righteousness he has done, and as our Savior says Math.
24.13. he that endures to the end, he shall be saved, and therefore we may
safely conclude, that continuance, and perseverance in sound and sincere
knowledge, and obedience to the will of God, is a most excellent thing, and a
special grace.

Such as have begun to show themselves sound in knowledge and sincere in
obedience to Gods will ought to go on in the same.
Oh be constant in that soundnes, and in that sincerity, go on in the same,
remember it is a most excellent thing to stand perfect, and full in true
knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, and this is a needful exhortation, and
cannot be often enough, and sufficiently urged, in this backsliding age, and
in these declining times of ours, wherein many shrink back, and start aside
from the sound and sincere profession of the gospel, and obedience to Gods
will, some have heretofore seemed to be sound and sincere in professing the
faith, but now they shrink back from that soundness, and sincerity, and as
Christ said to the Church of Ephesus Revel. 2.4, have lost their first love,
some heretofore seemed to have care to sanctify the sabbath, to train up
their families in the fear of God, to pray with them, and seemed to make
conscience of other holy duties, but alas, now they are shrunk back from
their first love, and former works, and there is now in them, almost an utter
forsaking of all good duties, well, remember whosoever thou art, that there is
no pleasing of God, nor hope of glory, without perseverance in sound and
sincere obedience to Gods will, Note.
to the end. The Lord is an eternal God, and his will eternal, and he
requires a perpetual service, and obedience, remember therefore whence thou
art fallen, and repent, and do thy former works; And to return to our
exhortation begun, if thou be one that art yet sound and sincere in the
profession of the gospel, in knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, be stirred
up to stand fast, and to go on in the same, and to that end further consider
these two things.

2 Motives to stir up such as are sound and sincere in the profession of the
Gospel to continue and to go on in the same.
First, the Lord receives much more dishonor by the backsliding of such as
having entered into the profession of the gospel, do afterward fall away,
either renouncing faith, or denying the power of it by an ungodly life, then he
does by the ignorance, and impiety of such as never entertained that way. And
secondly, the falling from grace, though but in part is dangerous, it is an
hard thing to recover that fall, it will cost thee many a sigh, and many

The state of those that fall back from the profession of the gospel, is more
dangerous, and more hard to be recovered, then of those that never entered into
the way of godliness, 2. Pet. 2.20. and therefore if thou be entered into sound
and sincere profession of the gospel, labor to stand fast, and to continue in
the same, and that thou may

2 Special things required in them that would continue in the sound and
sincere profession of the Gospel.
First, a receiving of the Gospel with a love of it, simply for it self, even
for the excellent comfort of it, and not for any by respect, not for honor,
profit, praise of men, and such like, if thou receive the gospel in respect of
honor, profit, and the like, thou will hold the profession of it, no longer
then it may stand with the enjoying of those things, and if by occasion, the
gospel hinder the holding of those things, then farewell the profession of it.

Heb. 3.12. Take heed says the Author of that Epistle least at any time there
be in any of you, an evil heart and unfaithful, or an heart of infidelity to
depart away from the living God, and if these things be in thee.

A receiving of the gospel with a love of it, simply for it self.

And a mortified heart, emptied of all secret unbelief, hypocrisy, and
spiritual pride, undoubtedly thou having begun to profess the gospel, thy
beginning shall have increase, and at last a perfect work, and thou shall be
able to stand fast, and to hold on the constant profession of the Gospel.

Now from these words (perfect and full in all the will of God) in that the
Apostle says (perfect and full) the foolish Familists think they have ground
for their absurd and foolish opinion, Confutation of the Familists, holding an
absolute perfection in the regenerate in this life.
that there is an absolute perfection in the regenerate, in the time of this
life, but alas, their light brains are deceived, and the spirit of error
deceiues them, I showed before how the words are to be taken, namely, perfect
and full, in regard of soundness and truth, I have heretofore showed the
vanity and absurdity of that opinion, chap. 3.14. I will not now stand on the
large confutation of it, only call to mind that distinction, that then I made,
that there is a perfection of parts, and a perfection of degrees, a perfection
of parts is an holiness in all the faculties of the soul, and in all the parts
and members of the body, having the seeds of all necessary virtues with an
endeavor to obey God in all things, and that is in the regenerate, in the time
of this life. But perfection of degrees, that is, an holiness in all the
powers of the soul, and parts of the body, perfect in measure and degree, that
is not in any in this life, for as the Apostle says, 1. Cor. 13.9. the most
regenerate, know but in part, therefore other graces are in them
proportionably, but in part, nor perfect in degree, in the time of this life:
but I leave them.

Note one thing further, in that Epaphras prayed that the Colossians might
stand perfect, sound and sincere in obedience to all the will of God.

We are taught.

That it is not enough to perfection, and filling to In sound and sincere
obedience to Gods will is required a conformity to all the will of God.
that in some or many things we endeavor to please God, but there must be in us
a conformity to all the will of God.

There must be in us a soundness and sincerity, in respect of the whole will
of God revealed, as David said, Psalm. 119.101. I have refrained my feet from
every evil way, that I might keep thy word, and verse 128. I esteem all thy
precepts most just, and hate all false waye^, so must we do, else we are not
sound and sincere in our obedience to Gods will.

In this case we must have no partial affections, We must not carry in us
partial affections in respect of sin.
Herod went so far, and did many things John taught him, but still he would
have his brothers wife: so happily many hate covetousness, and love drunkenness;
others hate drunkenness, and love swearing, and every one almost will have his
darling sin, and if it be so with thee, thou art not sound and sincere in thy
obedience to Gods will, if thou would be sound, there must be in thee a
purpose and an endeavor (howsoever thou can not but fall) to obey God in all
things, and at all times, and know thou, that even one sin, wherein thou
live wittingly and willingly, defiles thy whole life, and the Devil will not
much trouble thee, if he hold thee entangled in any one sin, that is enough
to draw thee down to perdition, as a little leake in a ship not stopped, will
sincke the ship, and he that makes not conscience of some one sin, is guilty
of breaking the whole law, Iam. 2.10. therefore if thou would be sound and
sincere, and have comfort in thy obedience to the will of God, look there be
in thee, a full purpose and an endeavor to obey God in all his commandments.

Come we to the thirteenth verse.

VER. 13 For I bear him record that he has a great zeal for you, and for
them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis.
In this verse, as we have showed, our Apostle does discover the efficient
cause of Epaphras his earnest striving in prayer for the Colossians, that it
proceeded and came from his zeal for them, and this verse has respect to the
former, as an argument or reason proouing that Epaphras did strive in prayer
for them, taken from the efficient cause of it, namely, his zeal toward them,
and that zeal of his, is further set out by the measure of it, by the extent
of it, and by the Apostles own testimony, For I bear him record (says the
Apostle) that he has a great zeal for you, the words of this verse need no
long exposition, For I bear him record, or I witness with him, Interpretation.
I yield him my testimony, that he has a great zeal, the word (zeal) in
Scripture, has many significations, but having here relation to the
Colossians and others, it signifies a fervent affection of love, a burning
love, a love that cannot lie hid, but is like to a fire that is hot, and often
breaks out into flame, for you Colossians, and for your neighbors them of
Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis, for Laodicea and Hierapolis were neighbor
towns or cities not far from Colosse.

This then is briefly the meaning of the Apostle in the words of this verse.

For I witness with Epaphras, that he has a burning love, even a love that
often times, like fire flames out, and shows it self, both toward you, and
toward your neighbors, them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. Consider we
the Apostles argument in this place, in that the Apostle proves Epaphras his
striving in prayers for the Colossians, by laying forth his zeal toward
them, as the efficient cause, and root of it.

He plainly teaches us thus much.

That out of zeal toward others, ever comes fervent Zeal and burning love
toward others, ^uer brings forth a careful performance and practice of all
good duties toward them.
as occasion is offered, and according to the measure of zeal, so is the
practice of good duties, a great zeal brings forth fervent prayers, and
careful performance of every good duty, and where zeal and burning love is
wanting, there is either a neglect of good duties altogether, or a doing of
them for fashion, or for by-respects.

And for further proof of this, the example of Paul, is most pregnant: he, in
many of his Epistles, makes known his zeal, and his fervent love toward
those, to whom he wrote.

And thereupon, his careful performance of good duties, ishuing out from
thence, even his careful instructing, admonishing, reproouing, comforting, and
praying for them, as occasion was offered. 2. Cor. 7.3. He says the
Corinthians were in his heart, to dye and live together; and from that love of
his, it was that he made them sorry with a letter, verse 8. and he says,
verse 12. That he wrote that letter unto them, to manifest, and make known
his care toward them, in the sight of God. From his love, and from his care
toward them, came his careful reproof, of that which was amiss in them by
his letter. 1 Thessalonians. in the 2. and 3. chapter, he does notably clear the
truth of this point, in his own example. Chap. 2. he says, he was affected
toward the Thessalonians, as a Nurse, and as a Father to his children: and
being thus affectioned (says he) verse 8. Our good will was to have dealt unto
you, not the Gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye wear
dear unto us. And then verse 11. that from that love it was, that he exhorted
them, and comforted them, and besought every one of them, as a father his
children. And chapter 3.1. he says, wherefore since we could no longer
forbear, as if he had said, my love toward you was such, and so strong
within me, it was like a fire in my breast, I could no longer keep it in, and
from thence it was, that I sent Tymotheus our brother to establish, and to
comfort you touching your faith, a plain evidence and proof of this.

That out of zeal and burning love toward others, ever comes a careful
performance of all good duties, and the reason of this is very plain,

True love is ever industrious, and painful for the good of those that are
beloved: and according to the measure of it, so is it more or less industrious
and painful.

And therefore certainly, out of zeal, and burninge love, ever comes careful
performance of every good duty. Hence then we may easily conceive, Whence it
is that men altogether neglect the doing of good duties to their brethren, or
else do them coldly in by-respects.
and conscionable in performance of good duties, toward their brethren; even
from hence, they have noe heat in them, they have no burning affection of true
love in their hearts toward their brethren; their hearts are either taken up,
with self love, or with doting and corrupt partial love, and thence it is that
they either altogether neglect the doing of good duties to their brethren, or
they do them coldlie, and faintly, or in sinister and by respects. We must
therefore labor to have our hearts seized and possessed with a zeal, and with
a burning affection of love to our brethren, and that we err not touching this
point, but may both rightly conceive this zeal, and be persuaded to the
embracing of it, being rightly conceived, I will stand a while to show.

First, what this zeal is.

Secondly, the sorts of it.

Thirdly, how it is to be manifested.

Fourthly, in whom it ought to be found.

And then after some examination of our selves touching the same, I will use
some motives to stir us up, to put on and to express this holy affection.

First, therefore know we, What zeal is
that zeal or burning love toward our brethren, is a feruency of spirit,
arising of a mixture of love and anger, for zeal, is a mixed affection, causing
men to seek the good of their brethren, and moving them to indignation and
grief, when any thing is done to the hurt of their brethren, or that may
hinder their good: And this feruencie of spirit, causing men thus to do, is
twofould, either according to knowledge, and guided by the word of God, or it
is blind, 2. sorts of zeal.
and not according to knowledge, as was that of Paul before his conversion;
Phill. 3.6. concerning zeal, I persecuted the church.

Now thirdly, touching the manifestation of this feruencie of spirit, causing
men to do as has been said, it is to be manifested two ways. Zeal is to be
manifested two ways.


Epaphras in this place he had a zeal toward the Colossians, and he made it
known by striving in prayers for them, thus did Paul as we have seen in the
places before cited.

Zeal ought to be found in all, but especially in public persons and such as
have the government of others.
And he sharply reproved Aaron verse 21. what did this people unto thee that
thou have brought so great a sin upon them? Now in the fourth place for the
persons in whom this zeal to our brethren ought to be found; We must know,
that it ought to be found in all, but especially in magistrates, in ministers,
and such as have any way the government of others, as here we see it was in
Epaphras a minister, and so in Moses, in Paul and such like public persons,
so then the sum of all that has been said touching zeal to our brethren is
this.

All men, but especially magistrates, ministers, and such as have the
government of others, are to have their hearts seized with a feruency of
spirit, arising of a mixture of love, and anger, causing them according to the
direction of the word of God, to seek the good of their brethren, and moving
them to indignation and grief, when any thing is done to the hurt of their
brethren, and they are to manifest that feruencie of spirit by doing what good
they are able to the souls of their brethren, by instruction, by counsel, by
comfort, and by prayers, and (as they are able) to remove and turn away, or at
least endeavor to turn away evil from their brethren, by showing holy anger
against their sins, by admonition by reproof, or by correction, as just
occasion is offered. This is that zeal and that burning affection of love that
we are to have our hearts possessed with all, and especially magistrates, and
ministers, and such as have the government of others, and this are they to
manifest it to their brethren. Reproof of such as want zeal to their brethren.
And now if we do examine our selves touching this holy affection of zeal to
our brethren, where, almost, is it to be found, where, almost is that man that
has the government of others in any kind, that magistrate, that master of a
family, or the like, that has in him a feruency of spirit, causing him to
seek the good of the souls of those that are under him, showing it forth by
instruction, by good counsel, by comfort, by fervent prayer, and moving him
to indignation and grief for their sins, manifesting that by holy anger, by
admonition, by reproof, by correction as just occasion is offered? do not many
masters and governors, not only neglect these good duties, to those that be
under them, but many times even countenance them in their sins? do they not
many times stand by their children, and servants, and hear them rail, curse,
and swear, and many ways misdemeane themselves, and yet show forth no manner
of grief, and indignation, nor dislike for the same. Do they not suffer them
to break the sabbath without controlement? yea sometimes such as have the
government of others stand by them in the open streets, when they are at their
sports, and vanities, and look on them, and never open their mouths to
reprove them. This is for want of zeal to our brethren, we have not our
hearts possessed with that burning love toward them that ought to be in us,
and therefore in a word, or two, to stir us up to labor after this zeal,
and this burning love toward our brethren, Two mot^ues to stir us up to
labor after zeal, and burning love toward our brethren.
and especially such as are under our government, consider first of all that if
thou have not a zeal in thine



If then thou would do good duties to thy brethren, and especially to those
that are under thy charge carefully, and conscionably, and so as they may be
pleasing to God.

And if thou would make it clear, that thou have a zeal to Gods glory, and
that his glory is dear unto thee, (which indeed ought to be more precious and
dear unto thee, then thine own salvation.)

Then labor thou to put on zeal and burning love to thy brethren, and
especially to those that be under thy charge, never rest till thou find in
thee a feruencie of spirit, even a mixture of love and anger, causing thee
(according to knowledge) to seek the good of their souls, by all good means,
and moving thee to an holy indignation and grief, when any thing is done,
that may be to the hurt of their souls.

In the next place, we are to mark the Apostles amplification of Epaphras his
zeal, by the measure and extent of it, that it was a great zeal, extended to
the Colossians, and to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. Hence note we
(in a word.)

That sometimes the children of God have in them Gods children have sometimes in
them a great measure of zeal and burning love to their brethren.
and burning love to their brethren, and that extended to many of their
brethren, for (as the Apostle Peter says, 1 Pet: 1.22.) The children of God
have their souls purified in obeying the truth through the Spirit, to love
brotherly without faining, so as sometimes they come to love one another with a
pure heart fervently.

They have not only that grace of true love to the brethren begun in them, but
they many times feel it fervent, and hot within them.

Now then, this being so, that the children of God, many That popish opinion
confuted, that men cannot know whether they have grace or no.
for so they hold, when they are pressed with it, that a believer may be
assured of his salvation by the testimony of the Spirit, and by grace wrought
in him: they answer, that a man cannot know whether he have faith and grace in
him or no. This opinion of theirs cannot stand with the truth now delivered,
that the children of God have many times that grace of true love to their
brethren in a great measure, and a burning love unto them: for can a living man
have fire in his naked bosom, and not feel it warm? no more can a man have a
zeal, and burning love to his brethren in his heart, and not feel the heat of
it, it is not possible, and therefore it is but a fancy, that a man may have
grace in his heart, and not feel it.

The great zeal that is found in Gods children ought to lead us to a
consideration of Gods great love to his children.
for why is there sometimes in men, that are compassed with many infirmities,
and have in them such dregs of corruption, so long as they are in this life,
such a measure of love to their brethren, as their love is a zealous and
burning love; how exceeding great then is the love of God to his children, who
is the perfection of love, even love it self, 1 Ioh. 4.5. his love to his
children far exceeds the love of the best men in the world, even as far as
God himself excels dust, and earth, sin, and corruption.

A sweet comfort, and let it be laid up in the hearts of all Gods children:
have thou an assurance of Gods love shed abroad in thine heart? Note.
then comfort thy self, his zeal, his burning love to his children, is like
to himself, infinite, and unchangeable: it was the ground of sending Christ,
as the Prophet says, Isai: 9.7. the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
this. And the Lord having once loved thee, his love will never fail thee, but
undoubtedly bring thee to eternal happiness and bliss.

One thing further we are to mark, the Apostle does not barely affirm it,
that Epaphras had a great zeal to the Colossians, etc. but he confirms it by
his own testimony: and to the end they might be fully persuaded of it, he
says, I bear him record, or witness, that he has a great zeal for you, and
for them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. The point hence arising is this.

That we are to witness the good things, and the good We are to witness the
good things and graces that are in our brethren, when our witness may do any
good.
when our witness may be to Gods glory, to the praise of his gifts, or may
win more credit to their grace and gifts, that they may be more able to do
more good by them.

Thus did the Apostle in this place; and thus did our Savior give testimony
to John, Mat: 11.11. Verily I say unto you, among them which are begotten of
women, arose there not a greater then John Baptist: thus are we to do, only
remembering this rule.

That we witness the good things that are in our brethren, When we are to
witness the good things that are in our brethren.
and speak of them rather in their absence, then in their presence, unless in
case of extreme deiection of mind, otherwise we are rather to speak of them
in their absence, then in their presence: for though we witness the truth, yet
our testimony in the hearing of our brethren themselves, may seem rather to
savor of flattery, then of any good liking of those good things, and (through
the corruption of nature) it may be an occasion of making the party proud, and
highly conceited of himself.

Come we to the 14th verse.

VER. 14. Luke the beloved Physician greeteth you, and Demas.
In this Verse the Apostle does further manifest and declare the love of two
other men, that were with him, toward the Colossians, namely, of Luke and of
Demas, that they also sent greeting and salutations to them: and the first of
these he sets out over and besides his name, by his particular calling and
profession, that he was a Physician, to which is added an epithet, or adiunct
of further commendation, (beloved) that he was a beloved Physician, Luke the
beloved Physician greeteth you. and Demas he only names, without adding any
further title of commendation to him.

Who this Luke was, it is doubtful, and some think it was Luke the Evangelist
that writ the gospel, and the Acts of the Apostles; others think it was not
he, but some other man of that name, Interpretation.
to which opinion I rather incline, because in all likelihood, if it had been
Luke the Evangelist, the Apostle would rather have given him that title, then
the title of Physician, that being a more excellent title, and of greater
honor and dignity. And again, the Apostle speaking of him, 2 Timothy: 4.11. he
only names him without addition of Evangelist; that which they (who hold him to
be Luke the Evangelist) do allege for their proof out of Philem: epist:
verse. 24. that he was Paul's fellow helper, is not of sufficient weight to
prove it: for some were his fellow helpers, that were no Evangelists, nor
Ministers, as appears Rom: 16.3. Aquila and Priscilla tent-makers, were his
fellow helpers: but who this Luke was, it is not much material: they that hold
him to be the Evangelist, say also that he was a Physician, one that had skill
in that faculty of Physic, and in curing bodily diseases, and therefore
without further inquiry we may keep to this title Physician, here given him
by the Apostle.

Luke the Physitian] The Apostle adds (beloved.) The original text runs
thus: Luke the Physician that beloved: the meaning i^, Luke the Physician
beloved of God, and for his piety, religion, and christian carriage in his
calling, singularly beloved of me, and of all true Christians that knew him.
(and Demas.) This Demas was he (no doubt) of whom afterward the Apostle
complained, 2 Timothy: 4.10. that he had forsaken him and embraced this present
world: we need not further stand upon these words touching the meaning of them.

Now in that the Apostle sets out Luke by his particular calling and
profession, that he was a Physician, (not to inquire, why it was, that Paul
had a Physician in his company, I hold that a needless thing,) we have a
manifest allowance given to physic, and to Physicians.

That to be a professed Physician, one that has skill to It is a lawful and
commendable course of life to be a professed Physician.
and a lawful and commendable course of life, otherwise the Apostle would
never have commended Luke, by this term (Physician,) if to be of that
profession, were not lawful, and very profitable, and comfortable unto the
sons of men; but further to prove this, we find that the spirit of God has
given approbation of Physic in other places of Scripture. Ierem: 8.21. the
Prophet bewayling the hurt of the people, even the misery that was to come on
them for their sins, he wishes verse. 22. that their hurt might be healed,
and he sets down his wish by way of expostulation, in metaphorical terms,
taken from balm, which is precious for curing of hurts and wounds, whereof
there was great store in Gilead, as appears Gen: 37.25. and from Physicians,
says he, Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Physician there? and Job
13.4. Job compares his friends to unskillful Physicians: says he, all you are
Physicians of no value. In that parable, Luk: 10 34. it is said of the
Samaritane, by way of commendation, that he bound up, and powered in oil and
wine into the wounds, of the man that lay wounded between Jerusalem and
Jericho, which (indeed) was a practice of Physic: for wine serves to cleanse,
and to ease the pain within, and oil to mollify the flesh, and to allay the
pain without: to which the Prophet alludes, Isai: 1.6. they have not been
wrapped nor bound up, nor mollified with oil. but most pregnant for proof of
the point in hand, is that speech of our Savior* comparing himself to a
Physician, Mat: 9 11. says he The whole need not a Physician, but they that
are sick. In which comparison, he shows plainly, that there is sometimes
necessary and good use of the Physician for the body, and therefore his
calling is lawful and commendable.



Good and wholesome Physic is to be esteemed as a blessing of God and of
needful use at sometimes.
and not (as the fashion of some is) to contemn it as a thing altogether
needless, and unprofitable; some are so wilfully auerse in this kind, as
sometimes they stick not to say, they will rather die then take Physic: but
let such know, they are guilty of the neglect of an excellent ordinance of God,
and a means that he has appointed for the preservation of health, and life,
which we are bound to preserve, by all possible good means; Note.
for this temporary life is a precious jewel, it is given us that in it we
might use all good means to attain to life and salvation, it is the time of
grace and salvation, and as the Preacher says, Eccles. 9.4. Whosoever is
joined to all the living has hope, for it is better to be a living Dog, then
a dead Lion. And if a man die in his sins, all hope of repentance is gone,
and he cannot redeem it with the price of a thousand worlds.

That which some use to object against the use of Physic, is not worth
answering

That some who use Physic are not better for it, but many times the worse,

For by the same reason they might reject the use of meat and drink.

Do not we see that some thrive not, but even pine away in the midst of
plenty,

And that we may use Physic with a good conscience and look for a blessing
on it; Three things to be remembered in the use of Physic.
Three things must be remembered.

1 First, that the medicines we use be lawful, such as have in them a
natural power and virtue to cure a bodily disease, not charms, or spells, or
amulets, and the like, which have no power, either by creation, or by any
ordinance of God to that purpose.

2 Secondly, that we use good medicines, only as means, not trusting in them
as able to do us any good of themselves, without Gods blessing on them; king
Asa commended in Scripture for many other things, is yet blamed for this, 2 Chronicles. 16.12. That he trusted to the Physicians.

3 And thirdly, that we use good Physic and medicines, with prayer, ever
calling upon God, for the pardon of our sins, yea rather desiring the pardon
of our sins, then the release of our pain, and entreating the Lord for a
blessing unto our Physic, for the removing of our disease, and the restoring
of health unto us, if it be his good will and pleasure, and if thus we use
Physic in time of need, we shall find it profitable, and comfortable, and a
means of restoring health to us, if the Lord see it meet for his glory, and
our good.

We are more to esteem of the physic for our souls, then of the physic
for our bodies.
of that physic and those medicines that serve for the curing of the
maladies, and diseases of our souls, and as every one is, or ought to be a
Physician for his own body, so much more for his own soul.

Few are skillful Physicians for their souls.
But alas, I must needs here break out into a complaint; Few there be that
have any understanding or skill, what thing is good for the healing of the
infirmities and diseases of their souls, and (which is worse) most have little
or no care to learn or remember such things, when they are told them, every
one almost knows what is good for his body, every one almost can say, oh, I
have an hot liver, or a cold stomach, a moist brain, or I am troubled with
wind, and such like, and this is good for me, and that is hurtful, and this
I will use, and that I will forbear; yea, if we hear it but once from the
mouth of another, this is good for you, or that is hurtful in regard of your
infirmity, or disease, we ever after that remember it, and we can say, I heard
such an one tell me once, it may be 20. or 30. years ago, this is good for
me, and therefore this I will use, this is hurtful for me, and therefore I
will forbear it. This I speak not against, this is lawful, but let this
shame us in regard of our ignorance and unskillfulness, and want of
remembrance, touching things that are good against the infirmites, and diseases
of our souls, we seldom or never say, oh I have a windy mind, a mind full of
nothing but ignorance, and vanity, my heart is much troubled with the lust of
uncleanness, of pride, of covetousness, and such like; this is good for me,
and this I will use, and that is evil and hurtful for me, and I will refuse
and avoid it. Nay, let a man tell us many times over, what is good against the
particular infirmity, or disease whereof our souls do chiefly labor, and
we either take no notice of it, or we remember it not.

For example, let us hear and that often, that a due consideration of the
insufficiency of riches in themselves to do us good, that our excessive desire
of them being satisfied, has the curse of God attending on it, and that
contentation, and the like, are means to cure that lust of covetousness that
is in us.

Let us be told that a serious consideration of our own vileness and sin, a
due consideration of Gods providence that nothing befalles us but by his hand,
that frequent and earnest prayer, and the like, are special means to be used
against the violent affection of iniust anger that takes place in us, and we
either take no knowledge of these things, or we remember them not.

Thou will say, alas my memory is weak,

Can thou remember a thing once told thee for the good of thy body, or no
care for the good of thy soul: and hence it is that thou do take notice, and
remember things told thee for the good of thy body, though thou hear them but
once, and not things often spoken for the good of thy soul.

Well, art thou able to see and discern the particular infirmity of thy body?
Do thou know and remember it once told thee, what is good, or what is
hurtful in regard of that infirmity? And do thou use the one and forbear
the other accordingly? Oh then let this shame thee if thou be ignorant, or
unskillful touching the infirmity of thy soul, or remembering not things often
told thee that are good against the same, and for the curing of that
infirfirmity, as thou art a Physician in some sort for thine own body, which is
commendable; so much more be thou a Physician for thy soul, spy out the
disease of thy soul, and if thou know the special infirmity, or diseases
of thy soul, be it one, or more, labor also to know what may serve for the
cure of it, and if once thou hear of that which may do thee good for that
disease, lay it up, and remember it, and make use of it, as occasion is
offered. And in as much as thy soul is far more excellent then thy body, so
have thou a greater care of the health and soundness of that, then of thy
body.

The Apostle adds (beloved) signifying that Luke was such a Physician, as for
his piety, and religion, and for his We are so to carry our selves in our
particular callings, as we may justly gain love from them with whom we have
to deal.
and of all true believers that knew him. I spoke of this Epithet before,
verse 7. I will only add thus much in a word.

That according to the example of Luke we are to carry our selves in our
personal and particular calling as we may justly gain love from those, with
whom we have to deal, that we may justly and truly be called (being
Physicians) beloved Physicians, being Merchants, beloved Merchants and such
like, and that we may so do, we must look that in the practice of the
works of our places and callings there bea practice of holiness and love,
that we show forth holiness toward God, and love to our brethren, How this
may be done.
in the practice of the works of our particular callings, and that we be such
as in the works of our particular calling, seek not our selves, our own
profits and commodities, but the glory of God, and good of our brethren, and
that we by love serve our brethren, as it is Gal. 5.13. And if we so do, we
shall (doubtless) win the love of our brethren, and find comfort in our
own hearts.

In the last place observe we, that the Apostle concludes with Demas, that he
also sent salutations to the Colossians, and he only names him, and sets no
mark of honor upon him; And whence was this? Surely the holy Ghost whose
penman the Apostle was, seeing the hollownesse and hypocrisy of Demas, which
afterward brake out, and appeared in forsaking Paul, and embracing this
present world, would not vouchsafe him any title of commendation, though he
deceived men, who made account of him in regard of the good profession he made
for a time, and he was a companion to the Apostle, yet he could not deceive
the holy Ghost, he saw his hollow heart and therefore, would not give him any
title of honor, more then this, that he sent salutations to the Colossians,
which a wretched worldling may easily do.

Hence we may gather.

That howsoever dissembling hypocrites, may deceive Though dissembling
hypocrites may deceive good men, yet they cannot deceive the Lord.
in regard of their outward profession, and admit them to be their companions,
as Paul did Demas, yet they cannot deceive the Lord, the Lord sees the deceit
and hollownesse of their hearts, and though men make account of them, yet the
Lord vouchsafes them no regard at all; no, though they eat and drink in his
presence, though they come to the Table of the Lord, and hear him speak unto
them in his word, and seem to make an excellent profession, and go so far
in that profession, and come to knock at heaven gates, and men cannot discern
them, yet the Lord all that while sees them to be but hypocrites, and has no
respect unto them, and will then tell them, he knows them not whence they are,
and say, Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, Luke 13.26.27.

Professors of Religion are to look to the soundnes of their profession.
think it not sufficient to come to the hearing of the word, and to the Table
of the Lord, and to make a fair outward show of religion, but look there be
soundness of religion in thine heart; for alas, what will it avail thee to
make a goodly show of Religion, and to be highly esteemed for it among men,
yea amongst good men, when notwithstanding the Lord sees thee to be a
dissembling hypocrite, and has no regard unto the? Remember this, thou may
in a seeming show of Religion go so far as to knock at heaven gates, and
challenge the Lord to let thee in, and yet the Lord see thee to be but an
hypocrite, and then be dismissed, and sent away with a N^scio, I know thee not,
depart from me thou worker of iniquity; therefore as thou do tender the
good of thine own soul, look to to the soundness of thine heart, Note.
that religion be soundly rooted in thine heart, and that thou may with good
conscience appeal to the Lord, as David did, Psalm. 139.1. and as Jeremiah did
Ierem. 12.3. and honor the Lord in thine heart as they did, and then
(doubtless) the Lord will honor thee, he will vouchsafe thee honor and good
estimation in the world, at least in the hearts of his children, and of his
mercy he will crown thee after this life is ended, with everlasting honor in
the kindome of heaven.

VER. 15. Salute the brethren which are of Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
Church which is in his house.
In this verse the Apostle comes to the third branch of his conclusion, which
is laid down in the 15.16. and 17. The third branch of the Apostles conclusion.
verses, and it contains a setting down of some special things which he
willed the Colossians to do, and that they should cause to be done, both to the
Church of Laodicea, and to some particular persons.

In this verse he wishes the Colossians to salute from him their neighbors,
them of Laodicea, whom he styles by the name of brethren, (Salute the brethren
which are of Laodicea) and then more specially, one Nymphas, together with
those that were in his house whom he does honor and dignifie with the title
of a Church, (and the Church which is in his house.)

Let us first clear the words touching the sense and meaning of them. (Salute
the brethren.)

The word (brethren) in Scripture has diverse acceptions, Interpretation.
sometimes it signifies such as are children of the same womb, brethren by
nature, as Jacob and Esau were; some times men of the same blood, as Abraham
and Lot, Genes. 13.8. sometimes men of the same Country, thus Saul's
contrymen are called his brethren, 2. Chr. 12.2, sometimes men of the same
religion. And thus the word (brethren) is usually taken in the new Testament,
for such as being converted to the true faith of Christ, made open profession
of that truth, and so it is here to be taken. (Salute the brethren which are
of Laodicea) that is, salute those at Laodicea which are converted to the true
faith, and make open profession of the faith, and Gospel of Christ, (and
Nymphas more specially, and the Church which is in his house.) Some by Church
in Nymphas his house, understand a Congregation, or an assembly of Christians,
which (say they) it may seem, used to meet together in his house, to perform
holy exercises of Religion, but (as I take it) that is not the meaning of the
Apostle, so much being before implied in the word (brethren) even all the
Christians generally that were in Laodicea, but by the Church in the house of
Nymphas we are to understand his Christian family, which was so well instructed
in the true faith of the Gospel, and so godly and religious as for the piety
and good order observed in that family, there being the word read,
instruction, consolation, prayer, singing of Psalms, and such like holy
exercises used, it was like to a little visible Church, or Congregation, in
which there be professors of true Religion, worshipping God in Christ according
to his word, in the exercises of Religion.

Thus then are the words of this verse to be conceived, as if the Apostle had
said.

Salute in my name, or from me your neighbors, those at Laodicea, who being
converted to the faith of the Gospel make open profession of the same, and
more specially Nymphas, and his Christian family, which for the piety and good
order observed in the same, in the use of holy exercises, is, even as a little
visible Church, or congregation, in which there be professors of true religion,
worshipping God according to his word in the exercises of religion. Come we now
to such instructions as this verse does further offer unto us; and first in
that the Apostle sent salutations from himself to them of Laodicea, which was
a token and testimony of his love toward them, and yet he had never seen
them, as appears cap: 2.1. only note with me, this in a word.

That we are to love even those Christians we never We are to love those
Christians we never saw, and to testify our love unto them by all good means.
upon any just occasion that is offered.

For why? they are members with us of the same body, and they are conjoined
with us by the same Spirit, even by the Spirit of Christ: and therefore we
ought to love them, though we have never seen them, face to face, and to
testify our love by salutations, prayers, and the like, as any just occasion
is offered.

And if thou have not a love to the members of Christ, Such as want love to the
members of Christ wheresoever they be, cannot as yet assure themselves to be
members of the body of Christ.
as yet. This point I have heretofore handled, and therefore let it serve to
have pointed at it in a word.

In the next place, we are to mark, that the Apostle saluting them of
Laodicea, that were professors of the true faith of Christ, he calls them
brethren. Whence we are taught thus much.

That professors of the same true roligion are in as near Professors of the
same true religion are to hold themselves as brethren one to another, and to
love one another as brethren, even heartily and mutually.
and are to be affected one to another, and to love one another, as brethren,
such as profess the same true religion, are to hold themselves as brethren one
to another, and to love as brethren, that is, to love one another heartily and
mutually, for so do natural brethren, unless they degenerate and grow out of
kind; We find it often in Scripture, that the professors of the same true
faith, are styled by the name of brethren, and stirred up to hearty and mutual
love, under the title of brethren, as Rom: 12.10. Be affectioned to love
another with brotherly love. 1 Pet: 3.8. Love as brethren. It is a known point
(no doubt) in speculation, we have many times had occasion to speak of it,
and therefore I will be brief in it: and the ground of it is also (doubtless)
well known to us, it being the same with the ground of the love of natural
brethren,

We that profess the same true faith, are to remember that in that respect we
are brethren, and are to love one another as brethren.
and remember that besides this, that brotherly love is the badge and
cognizance of our profession, by this shall all men know that ye are my
disciples, if ye have love one to another, Ioh: 13.35. and is an undoubted
pledge of our own salvation, 1 Ioh: 3.14. that brotherly love is a thing, not
only taught outwardly by precept, but inwardly taught and implanted in the
hearts of all true believers by the spirit of God, as the Apostle says
plainly, 1 Thessalonians. 4.9. touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
you. why so? for ye are taught of God to love one another; as if he had said,
as natural brethren (not degenerating and growing out of kind) are taught by
nature to love on^ another: so you to whom God has given his holy Spirit, are
taught by the spirit of God to love one another.

Deadly hatred of our brethren, and the s^uits of it, are the deu^lls lessons.
Now then hence reason thus with thy self; is brotherly love, a lesson taught
by the spirit of God? who then is the teacher of deadly hatred? who puts into
me swelling, and heart-burning against my brethren? who fills my mouth with
bitter and venomous speeches against them? are these lessons taught by Gods
spirit? no, no, he is the God of peace and love, and these are the teachings
of another spirit, even of that infernal spirit, the author of confusion, the
sower of all dissension among brethren, these are the teachings of the Devil
himself: think on this, whosoever thou art, that have thine heart filled with
poison, even full of hatred and malice, and thy tongue bent to shoot out
arrows, even bitter words against thy brethren, thou art so taught by the
Devil himself, he is thy instructor, and he is thy teacher: as many as are
true believers, have learned another lesson, that they are taught of God to
love their brethren heartily and mutually. And if thou have not learned that
lesson, thou art not taught of the Spirit of God: and if thou be not taught of
Gods spirit, surely thou have not his spirit, and if thou have not his spirit,
thou art none of his.

Let this then stir up every one of us, seeing we profess the same true
faith and religion, and so are brethren, to love one another with brotherly
love, that so we may have testimony to the comfort of our own souls, that
we (indeed) are true professors, knit together by one spirit, even the Spirit
of God, and guided by the Spirit of God.

Now further observe we, that the Apostle having sent salutations to all the
brethren in Laodicea generally, he salutes Nymphas and his house particularly:
Nymphas excelling others in piety and religion, is preferred by the holy ghost
before the rest, and had in special remembrance by the Apostle: salute the
brethren which are of Laodicea, and especially Nymphas, and his godly family.
Whence we are given to understand.

That they that honor God, shall be honored of him: Note.
yea they, according to the degree of honor which they give to the Lord, shall
be honored of him: if any surpass others in honoring the Lord, the Lord will
also honor him above his fellows. but on that I will not stand.

Let us rather consider the duty arising from hence, namely this.

We are to honor men more or less, according as they honor God.
as the Apostle did here in particular salute Nymphas, he excelling others in
piety, and thereby manifest a special regard and estimation that he had of
him.

So ought we to carry in our hearts a more special regard of those that
excel others in piety and religion, and more especially to honor them, that
above others, do honor and fear the Lord. Psalm. 15.4 it is made a note of
him that shall dwell in the Lords tabernacle, that he honors them that
fear the Lord. and Psalm: 16.3. David says, his delight was in the Saints that
were in the earth, and chiefly in the excell^nt, in those that did excel
others in grace and holiness; the reasons of this duty are manifest.





And therefore, (to make use of this) do thou honor one man above another?
do thou carry in thine heart a more special regard of one above another? no
doubt every one does so, when they compare man with man: look then it be
according to the duty now laid before thee, even in respect of this, that he
excells others in piety and religion.

Do not thou according to the common course of the world, honor and esteem
one man better then another, In honoring one man above another, not wealth or
outward estate, but piety and religion are to be respected.
because he is more wealthy, or of better estate in the world then others,
that is not the rule, by which thou art to be guided in the preferring and
honoring of one man above another; no, no, look to his piety and religion,
and to the infallible tokens of Gods fear in his heart, and according to them,
let him have place of honor and estimation in thine heart, and he that excells
others in piety and religion, let him be the man thou do honor and esteem
above others, yea though it be in an unequal comparison, in respect of outward
condition: as happily one is a Magistrate, and another a private person, Note.
if the private person excel the Magistrate in piety and religion, let him
have the chief place of honor in thine heart. Howsoever, indeed, thou art to
reverence the place and authority given unto Magistrates, and to honor and
respect it with all due reverence and honor, and to submit thy self to it,
even to the shedding of thy blood: yet in regard of piety and religion, a
private person going before a Magistrate, let him in that respect, have an
higher place of honor in thine heart, then the Magistrate, and do thou in
honoring and preferring one man before another, in regard of piety and
religion, ever honor him most, that does most honor God: and know for thy
comfort, that that is a certain evidence and proof, that thou love the
honor of God, and that his honor is dear unto thee, in that thou not only
honor them that honor him, but thou do honor them more or less
according to the measure of honor which they yield to the Lord.

Now further in that the Apostle calls the christian family of Nymphas a
Church, we see

That a small number of the faithful, Note.
even one family may carry the name of a Church. But on that I will not stand.

Why did the Apostle call the family of Nymphas, a Church? it was because of
the piety of that family, and the good order observed in it, there being in it
holy exercises of religion constantly used, as reading the word, instruction,
prayer, singing of Psalms, and the like: and thereby the whole family framed
to piety and religion, therefore it was that the Apostle called it a Church.

Hence we are taught thus much.

A family wherein there is a constant use of holy exerc^ses, and the members
of it thereby fram^d to holiness and religion, is as a l^tle visible Church.
the teaching and religious ordering of a family, is so acceptable a thing to
the Lord, as he esteems of such an house, as an holy assembly of his Saints.

And hence it is, that not only here, but in other places also, the holy ghost
does commend, and give the title of a Church to particular families, Rom: 16.5.
Greet the Church that is in their house. and 1 Cor: 16.19 Aquila and Priscilla
with the Church that is in their house. so likewise Philem: verse 2. of that
episte, is saluted with the Church in his house. See then how pleasing a thing
it i to the Lord, when a family is instructed, and religiously ordered, he
makes account of that family, as of a little visible Church and congregation.

An excellent motive to stir up governors of families to a religious ordering
of their families.
for indeed it is the duty of every master and governor of a family, to
teach and to instruct his family, and to pray with them in private, and not
only to bring them to the public assembly, and there to pray, and by all good
means to frame them to holiness and religion. And here is an excellent motive
to stir them up to the practice of that duty; a family instructed and
religiously ordered, is esteemed of the Lord as a little visible Church and
assembly of his Saints, and that is no small matter: for such a family has
the blessing of God upon it, and his special protection over it, for the
blessing of God is ever annexed to his true worship and fear, Godliness has
the promises of this life and of that that is to come. 2 Timothy: 4.8.

Again, consider what a family not instructed and religiously ordered is,
What a family is, wherein there is no religious order.
surely, no better then a company of Atheists, for it is one property of the
Atheist, not to call on God, Psalm: 14.4. and we may see this true in common
experience, look into many familie^ not instructed and relig^ously ordered,
and what are they? like a little Church? nay surely so far out of order, as
they are rather like to an hellish company, where the devil himself sits as
president: there is nothing, but ignorance, worldlines, pride, wantonness,
swearing, fighting, whoring, stealing, lying, and such like.

And yet further to excite and stir up masters and governors of families to
the instructing and religious ordering of their families, consider what we
find Gen: 18.19. Another excellent motive to stir up masters and governors
of families, to order their families religiously.
the Lord says, verse 17. Shall I hide from Abraham what thing I do; as if
he had said: no, no, I will not hide any thing from Abraham, for I know him,
that he will command his sons and his household after him, that they keep the
way of the Lord, to do righteousness and judgment. See how the Lord likes
the carfulness of masters and gouernous to instruct their families, it is so
pleasing unto him, as he will reveal his secrets to such as do it, and hide
nothing from them that may be for their comfort.

On the contrary, we may gather, that from such as are careless of this duty,
he will hide his secrets, his coun else, and without repentance, his comforts,
and the light of his countenance for ever. So then, if thou that art a master
of a family, do desire that thy family may not be a company of Atheists,
among whom there is nothing but ignorance and all impiety, but rather as a
little Church, and so esteemed of the Lord, having his blessing upon it, and his
special protection over it, and if thou desire that the Lord may not hide his
counsels from thee, but may reveal his secrets unto thee, and hide nothing
from thee, that may be for thy comfort. Then look thou to the instruction and
religious ordering of thy family, resolve with good Joshua, Josh: 24.15.
whatsoever others do, yet thou and thine household will serve the Lord; practice
thou constantly the use of holy exercises of religion, private reading,
praying, and the like: and then (doubtless thou shall find, the Lord will
esteem of thy family, as of a little visible Church, and thou shall find his
blessing upon thee, and upon thy family, and the Lord will reveal and make
known to thee, whatsoever may be for thy comfort.

Now to the 16th verse.

VER. 16. And when this Epistle is read of you, cause that it be read in the
Church of the Laodiceans also, and that ye likewise read the Epistle (written)
from Laodicea.
In this Verse, the Apostle goes on further, to inioyne two other things to be
done by the Colossians, as



And he tells them when they should so do, (namely) after themselves had read
it: And when this epistle (says he) is read of you, cause that it be read in
the Church of the Laodiceans also.

And that ye likewise read the Epistle written from Laodicea.

Touching the words of this verse, there is no great difficulty to them, save
only in the last words of it concerning the Epistle witten from Laodicea.

When this Epistle (that is) this letter, sent unto you, Interpretation.
is read, cause it (that is) take order that it be read (in the Church) that
is, in the public assembly of the Laodiceans.

Now for that Epistle written from Laodicea there be diverse opinions; some
think it was an Epistle written from Paul to the Laodiceans, and of this
opinion are the Papists, but that cannot stand with the words of the Text, for
the original is (...) and (...), as it is rendered from Laodicea, not to
Laodicea.

Now whereas, they say, though it be from, not to the Laodiceans, yet that
phrase does not signify, that the Epistle was written from Laodicea, but that
the Colossians were to require and call for that Epistle from the Laodiceans,
that it was an Epistle the Apostle had written unto the Laodiceans, and the
Colossians were to require it at their hands, is but a shift, a Gloss, and a
needelesse adding to the Text.

Some again think, that the Epistle written from Laodicea, was the first
Epistle of Paul to Timothy, indeed that Epistle has such a postscript, that it
was written from Laodicea, a chief City of Phrygia Pacaciana, but that
postscript is no part of Canonical Scripture. And again, it is clear, Cap.
2.1. that when the Apostle writ this Epistle, he had not seen the Laodiceans,
and therefore he could not mention any Epistle of his written from thence, he
having never been there.

A third opinion is, that the Epistle here spoken of written from Laodicea, was
an Epistle written to the Apostle, either from the whole Church of Laodicea, or
from the Pastor of that Church; and (indeed) this opinion is most probable and
most agreeable to the words of the Text, without any addition or forcing at
all, and it seems, that Epistle written from Laodicea, was written to Paul
touching some things to which he makes answer in this Epistle to the
Colossians, and therefore he willed the Colossians to read it, that they might
the better understand upon what occasion he had written somethings contained in
this Epistle to them: and so taking that to be the meaning, that the Epistle
written from Laodicea, was an Epistle, that either that whole Church, or the
Pastor of that Church had written to Paul.

Come we to such points of instrustion as this verse does offer to us.

And first, observe we, that the Apostle would have his Epistle read both in
the Church of the Colossians, and in the public assembly of the Laodiceans,
whence we may easily see, I will but point at it.

Paul, and of all other books of Scripture, in the public assembly The
Epistles of Paul, and other books o^ Scripture may, and ought to be read in
the public asembly.
and congregation, we have here a plain allowance given to it, that th^s
Epistle, and other Epistles and other books of the Scripture, may be, and
(indeed) ought to be publicly read, in the public congregation, yea, the
Church governors may, and ought to take order, that the books of holy
Scripture be read in the public meetings of the people of God.

And to this purpose the Apostle speaks more directly, and with far greater
vehemence, 1 Thessalonians. 5.27. He there commands the governors of that Church in
the name of the Lord to do this duty, yea, he binds them to the doing of it,
under pain of Gods heavy displeasure, denouncing his heavy wrath against
them if they did it not (for so much the word signifies) I charge you, or I
adjure you, ^n the name of the Lord, on pain of the Lords wrath, that this
Epistle be read unto all the brethren, the Saints, to all the Christians that
are members of your Church, in their public meeting, a charge full of power
and Apostolical authority, urging the governors of that Church to the doing
of this duty.

Now, how cross and contrary to this, is the Church of Rome, that Church,
directly forbids the reading of the books of the Scripture among the people,
The Papists justly taxed in that they forbid the reading of the Scripture among
the people.
at least the reading of them in a known tongue, which is all one, they
strictly inioine that no vulgar translation of Scripture be used, pretending
forsooth, that such translations are principal causes of errors, and heresies;
how far are those men from the mind of the Apostle, who would have his
Epistle to be read in the public congregation, that even common Christians (no
doubt) and all the faithful people of God might be acquainted with them, but
I leave them, and for the use of this to our selves.

Is it so that the Epistles of Paul, and other Books of We are not to despise
the public reading of the Scripture.
and ought to be read in the public congregation? Let none of us then despise
the public reading of them: happily some have a conceit, that it is scarce
lawful for them to be present at the public reading of the word, and
therefore they purposely absent themselves till the exercise of Preaching
begin. If any so think, let them know it is but a fancy, Act. 15.21. It is
said, that the books of Moses in the time of the Law were read in the
Sinagogues, and so (doubtless) may, and ought the books of Moses, and other
Scriptures be now read in the public congregation, and if Church governors
may and ought to take order for the reading of them, we also are bound to
hear them so read.

Observe we in the next place that the Apostle would Colossians to be read in
the Church of the Laodiceans, The Epistles of Paul, and other books of
Scripture do not only belong to the^ to whom they were particularly written
but do ind^fferently belong to all Christians.
as needful and profitable for them also.

Whence we are given to understand this much.

That howsoever this, and every other Epistle, and other books of Scripture be
directed to some one Church, or person, yet they belong to us, and to all the
Church of God, as the common and public treasure of them all. This Epistle of
Paul to the Colossians, and other books of Scripture, do not only belong to
them, to whom they were particularly written, but do indifferently appertain
to all Christians; For why? (that we may not only affirm this, but prove it)
as the Apostle says, 2. Tim. 3.16. The whole Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable to teach to improve, to correct, and to instruct in
righteousness. The Apostle, we see, there speaks not only generally of the
whole Scripture, but indefinitely in regard of the use of it, that it is
profitable to teach, to improve, to correct and to instruct in righteousness,
not this or that Church, or person only, but indefinitely all, and every one
without exception; and to this agrees also that of the Apostle, Romans 15.4.
Whatsoever things were written before time, were written for our learning, that
we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Though
indeed that place specially intend the old Testament, the writings of the
Apostle being not then extant, yet it is true also of every part of the new
Testament, because the Spirit is always like it self, and therefore the new
Testament being written by the same Spirit, is also written for our learning,
as well as the old, and whatsoever things are written in the books of the old
or new Testament, are written, and do belong to us, Mar. 1337. Says our
Savior; Those things that I say unto you, I say unto all, as if he had said,
my doctrine, and my exhortation i^ general, though it be spoken and delivered
to you, that are now my hearers, yet (indeed) it belongs to all, it concerns
all men whososoeuer, and so (doubtless) we may safely say, that howeuer the
Epistles of Paul, and other books of Scripture be directed to someone
particular Church, or person, yet indeed, that which is written to one Church,
or person, belongs to all the Churches of God, and the doctrine and matter of
them is indifferently belonging to all Christians.

And the reason of it is this.

Paul, and other books of Scripture, were by the will of God penned and
committed to writing, that they might be for the genenerall good of Gods Church
that they might be the foundation and pillar of true faith, as John says,
Ioh. 20.31. These things are written that ye might believe, that Jesus is the
Christ the Son of God, and that in believing ye might have life through his
name.

And therefore howsoever this Epistle to the Colossians, and other Epistles,
and other books of Scripture, be directed to particular Churches, or persons,
yet they contain in them a perpetual doctrine, and such a matter as is common
to all Christians, to the end of the world, and this being a clear point.

First, it serves for answer to a foolish conceit of the Papists, An answer to
a foolish conceit and fond objection of the Papists.
and a fond objection they commonly make against our doctrine.

Oh (say they) your doctrine is not sound and good: and why so? Because (say
they) it is not confirmed by Miracles, you pretend (say they) that you are
traveling toward heaven, and yet you know not whether you be in the right
way, or no, because you have no Miracles, as it were letters or news from
heaven, from such as have gone in the way that you walk, to assure you that
they are there arrived, and that you are in the right way, which is an absurd
cavil. We may easily answer them, by the doctrine now delivered, for we have
miracles to confirm the truth we profess, inasmuch as the miracles of Christ
and his Apostles are recorded in the written word of God, and being there
recorded, they serve for confirmation of the truth of the Gospel, not only
then, when they were wrought; but for confirmation of the same truth to the end
of the world, and so they belong to us also, in that our faith is the same that
theirs was that did them, we are not destitute of letters from heaven, having
the Epistles of Paul, and other Apostles which belong to us as well as to them,
to whom they were particularly directed. Indeed we want such miracles, and such
letters as are contained in popish legends, and Indian new, which are mere
delusions of Satan, and forgeries of men. But so long as by Scripture we can
justify our doctrine, we have letters from heaven sufficient to assure us,
that all that truly embrace the faith we profess, being now departed this
life, are safely arrived in the kindome of heaven, and therefore it is but a
cavil, to say we want miracles, and letters from heaven, to confirm our
doctrine. But come we to the use of the doctrine that concerns our selves.

Paul, and other books of Scripture, howsoever they be directed to particular
Churches, We are to make use of the books of Scripture either read or
expounded to our selves particularly.
yet the matter of them does indifferently belong to all Christians? Let us
then take notice of this, and learn we, whenever we hear the Epistles of
Paul, or other books of Scripture read, or expounded, or we our selves do
read in them, then to think thus with our selves, surely that I now hear, or
that I now read, belongs to me, and I am to make use of it to my self, and
though it be directed to such a Church, or such a person, yet I am to take it
as spoken to my self, it concerns me to consider how this may profit me,
either for the information of my judgment, for my teaching in respect of some
truth, or for the improuing of some error that is in me, or for the correction
and reformation of some things amiss in my life and conversation, or for my
further instructing, and my edification, and building up in holiness, and
comfort.

Do thou whenever thou either hear, or read any part of the writings
of holy Scripture, ever remember this, that the matter or doctrine of that
place pertaines to thy self, and do thou apply the several threatenings,
promises, and instructions of the word, thou hear, or read to thine own
estate particularly.

In this duty many are exceeding short, and much defective, Many are de^^ctiue
in this ^utie.
I might show it in many particulars, to instance but in one or two; the
Apostle in this Epistle, Cap. 3.6. says, that for fornication, uncleanness,
the inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is
Idolatry, the wrath of God certainly comes on the children of disobedience, He
says again, Ephesians. 5.5. That no whooremonger, neither unclean person, nor
covetous person which is an Idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of
Christ, and of God. He says again, 1 Cor. 6.9.10. Neither fornicators, nor
Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor thieves, nor
covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall inherit
the kingdom of God.

Now consider it, do men that are guilty of the sins there reckoned up, when
they hear, or read those places, think they belong to themselves? Do they
apply them to themselves, and say within themselves, surely this is my state,
my sin is here touched, and this judgment is denounced against me? Do they
thus? No, no, nothing less, happily they think and will confess the things
there spoken, to be true, the vilest wretch that lives may so do: but to
think the truth of them belongs to themselves, they are far from that, for
if they did, how durst they still live and continue in their known sins,
against which such fearful judgments are threatened.

Again the holy Ghost says, Heb. 2.2.3. If the word spoken by Angels was
steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience reciued a just recompense of
reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first
began to be preached by the Lord, and afterward was confirmed to us by them
that heard him; the meaning is briefly this, if every transgression of the Law
was severely punished, how shall we escape, if we do but neglect the Gospel?
Do men that neglect the Gospel, such as, (howseuer they do not blaspheme the
Gospel as the Papists do, and call the professors of it heretics) yet they
love it not as they ought, they delight not in it, they account it not most
dear and precious unto them, and all things dung, and nothing worth in
comparison of it? do such persons when they read that place think it belongs
to them, and that judgment is there threatened against them? No, no, no such
matter, they think, that seeing they draw not their own sins after them (as it
were with cart-ropes, as it is Isaiah 5.18. and they hate the known sins of
many, as Adultery, Murder, and the like, that therefore their neglect of the
gospel, their want of love unto it, is nothing, there is no judgment of God
belongs to them. This without question is the conceit of many carnal
Gospellers, and thus I might insist in many other particulars, and show how we
fail in this duty, we think not that the things we hear, or read in the
Scriptures, belong to us, and we apply not the several threatenings of the
word to our own estate and condition, we must then learn whenever we either
hear or read any part of the Scripture, to think thus with our selves;
Surely this doctrine belongs to me, this promise is made to me, Two motives to
stir up to make use of the word of God either heard or read to our selves
particularly.
this threatening, I being guilty of that sin, or the like, denounced against
me.

And to help us forward in this duty, consider we these two things.

First, if we thus hear or read the word of God, we shall make it truly
profitable to our selves, we shall through

Hebr. 4.2. which profited them not, because it was not tempered with faith, we
shall not only do this, but we shall one day find the threatenings of the word
verified, and made good upon us, to our eternal woe and confusion.

If then thou do desire that the word heard, or read by thee, may be truly
profitable: that the instructions, comforts, and threatenings of it, may be to
thy good, and if thou would not both strip thy self of the benefit of the
instructions and comforts of it, and find the threatenings of it made good upon
thy self, then learn thou whenever thou do either hear, or read it, to
think, and be persuaded, that the matter of it belongs to thee in particular,
and that thou art to make use of it according to the purpose and drift of it.

To omit that which the Papists gather from the last words of this verse, that
seeing the Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans is not to be found, therefore
some part of the Scripture is lost, and that the canonical Scripture we have,
is not sufficient without addition of unwritten traditions, that being built
but upon their own mis-interpretation of the text: the Apostle willed the
Colossians to read the Epistle written from Laodicea, no doubt, that they might
better understand some things in this Epistle, written to themselves. Hence we
may gather.

That we may and ought to read other holy writings, That we may and ought to
read other holy writings, besides the written word of God.
even such as may help us in the understanding of the word.

The reason is plain, such holy writings may serve for our edification: for if
we may be edified by the gracious speeches of holy men, and furthered in grace
and goodness by their holy life, as doubtless we may: books, Men are
blameworthy for not reading holy books written by men.
for hereby that excuse that men commonly plead, is taken away, that the
Scripture is hard to be understood* for why? thou have not only the benefit of
the public ministry, but in this age many excellent books are put forth in
print, that may help thee in the right understanding of the word, and
therefore if now thou be ignorant, thy ignorance is wilful and affected, and
thou art left void of all excuse.

VER. 17. And say to Archippus, take heed to the ministry that thou have
received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.
In this Verse, we have another thing laid before us, which the Apostle willed
the Colossians to do, (namely this) that they should speak to Archippus, and
he tells them what he should say to him, what words they should use, and after
what manner they should speak to him; as that they should speak by way of
admonition, and warn him to take heed to the ministry he had received in
the Lord, (And say to Archippus take heed to the ministry that thou have
received in the Lord.)

In this warning or admonition we have more particularly these things to be
considered.

1 First the matter of the admonition, in these words, take heed to the
ministry that thou have received in the Lord. 2 Then the extent of that duty,
how far forth Archippus should take heed and look to his ministry,
(namely) so far as that he should fulfill it, Take heed to the ministry that
thou have received in the Lord that thou fulfill it. 3 And thirdly, in the
words of this admonition, the Apostle lays down a strong and effectual
argument, to persuade Archippus to take heed to his ministry, taken from the
author of his ministry, that he had that his ministry from the Lord, that
he had received it by his grace, and therefore he should look to it, and
fulfill it; Take heed to the ministry that thou have received in the Lord
that thou fulfill it.
And the occasion of this warning to be given by the Colossians to Archippus in
all likelihood and probability, was this.

Archippus was a minister in the Church of Colosse, and was a colleague, and
fellow-helper in that Church to Epaphras, who was then at Rome with Paul, and
therefore he ought in the absence of Epaphras, to have been diligent in his
ministry, which it seems he was not, and therefore the Apostle would have
him admonished, and put in mind of his duty.

I will therefore briefly lay forth the sense and meaning of this verse. (And
say to Archippus,) that is, Interpretation.
admonish and warn Archippus, on this manner, (take heed to the ministry,)
the original is (see to the ministry,) the meaning is, carefully look to the
office and function, diligently weigh and consider, what it is, the weight of
it, and what belongs to that pastoral duty, (that thou have received in the
Lord) that is, that thou have received from the Lord, which he of his grace and
mercy, has committed unto thee, (that thou fulfill it.) The word fulfill, is
metaphorically borrowed and taken from a vessel, that ought to be full of
liquor, or the like matter, and is not; and the Apostle compares the ministry
of Archippus to such a vessel, which had somewhat put into it, but was not
filled to the brim, as it should have been: and so when he says that thou
fulfill it, it is as much as if he had said, that thou fill up that vessel of
thy ministry, as it ought to be filled, and leave no empty place in it: and
his meaning is, that thou do it not to the halfes, or in some part, and leave
it undone in another, but that thou perform it, in every respect, as it ought
to be performed, that thou accomplish and perform all the parts of that office
and ministry; Thus then briefly conceive the Apostles meaning.

Admonish Archippus on this manner; Look carefully, and diligently consider
with thy self, what is that office and function, the weight of it, and what
belongs to that pastoral duty, which thou have received from the Lord, and
which he of his grace and mercy has committed to thee, that thou perform it
in every respect, as it ought to be performed, that thou leave nothing undone
in that office that ought to be done, but that thou accomplish it in all the
parts of it. Now first, it is not to be passed by without observation, that
howsoever the Apostle in the verse before enjoined the reading of his Epistle,
that it should be read both in the Church of Colosse and of Laodicea, yet here
he adds Archippus should be put in mind of his duty, that he should be
admonished to look to the fulfilling of his ministry, that he should be
stirred up to a diligent teaching of the word amongst the Colossians. Hence we
may gather.

It is not enough to read the word our selves, or to hear it read, but we must
also attend to the preaching of it in the public ministry of it.


For (indeed) the preaching of the word is the ordinance of God, which he has
ordained for the right understanding of the word, as the Eunuch said, Act:
8.31. and for the effectual application of it, to the entering through, even
unto the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints and
the marrow, and to the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart,
Heb. 4.12. In reading there is sometimes no understanding, sometimes
misunderstanding, sometimes mis-applying the word read, and all these wants are
helped and supplied by preaching.

This I note in a word, against that selfe-pleasing conceit of some, who sooth
up themselves in their neglect of the public ministry of the word. Reproof
of such as neglect the public ministry of the word.


Say they we have the Bible, and in the Bible are the most perfect Sermons of
Christ, and of his Apostles,

Indeed it is true, Cor. 14.25 they cannot endure that the sword of the word
should pierce them, and should be used to the cutting, and launcing, and
searching of the festered sores of their souls, by the hand of another: and is
it likely they will so apply it themselves, that they as it were with their
own hands will use the word to the cutting, launcing and searching of their
own festered sores? No, no, there is no likelihood in it, and therefore it is
but a vain excuse to say they have the Bible at home, they can, and do read in
the Bible: this is but a fond shift; and we must know it is not enough for us
to read in the Bible, (though that is our duty to be diligent in reading in it)
yet that will not serve the turn, the application of the word is especially
made in the public ministry and preaching of it, and to that we must
attend, yea though we have knowledge, and (happily) know as much as the
Preacher can teach us, yet still must we attend upon it: for the preaching of
the word, serves, not only for the information of the judgment, but for the
framing of the will and affections to holiness, and for the stirring of us up
to the practice of that we know: and in this respect must every one attend to
the public ministry and preaching of the word.

Note we further, that the Apostle here willed the Colossians to admonish
their minister Archippus, as it may seem somewhat slack in his duty, to be
more diligent in performance of his duty; we see then though Ministers of the
word have great authority over the Church committed unto them by the Lord, yet
notwithstanding if they be negligent in doing their duty, The place of a
Minister does not exempt him from othe^s men's cha^^table ouersig^t and careful
admonition. How such admonition must be used.
they may be stird up to a greater care in doing their duty by the same Church,
and by the governors of it may be put in mind of their duty, and reproved,
if they deserve reproof: their places do not exempt them from other men's
charitable oversight and careful admonition. Yet such admonition must be used
with reverence and due regard, even with regard had to their pastor, as one
sent to them from the Lord for their good: It is the Apostles rule, 1 Timothy: 5.1.
Rebuke not an Elder, but reprove him as a Father; the reproof of an Elder
must be a submissiue and reverent exhortation of him, but I will not further
insist on that.

Come we to the admonition it self, which the Apostle willed the Colossians to
use to Archippus their Minister: say to him (says the Apostle) take heed to
the ministry thou have received in the Lord that thou fulfill it. Where first
we are to mark, the Apostle bids the Colossians, not barely to say to
Archippus, fulfill thy ministry, but that they should say to him, take heed to
it, that thou fulfill it diligently, consider thy ministry, what it is, the
weight of it, and that thou fulfill it; where in the first place we are given
to understand,

That a Minister of the word ought diligently and carefully to consider his
ministry: A Minister of the word ought diligently and carefully to consider
his ministry.
there must be in the Minister of the word, a diligent and due consideration of
his office and calling, what it is, and the weight of it: a Minister must duly
and seriously consider, what he is called unto, even to be the messenger and
ambassador of the Lord, to carry his message, and his embassage to his people,
and to entreat of conditions of peace between God and his people, and to stand
in Christ his stead, 2 Cor. 5.20. to be Gods interpreter to the people, and the
peoples to God, Ierem: 33.23. and he is to consider the weight of his calling,
that he is put in trust with the souls of men, yea the souls of men purchased
with so great a price, as the most precious blood of the only begotten son of
God, Acts 20.28. and that he is put in trust with the holy worship of God, and
with his holy name (as it were) with his crown and dignity, and with the
dispensation and disposing of his secrets, 1 Cor. 4.1. and that it belongs to
him, to teach, to improoue, to correct, to instruct, to exhort, to comfort, to
watch, to pray, to go in and our before Gods people unblameably; these and many
other like, are the things that every Minister of the word ought to think on,
to consider and to have an eye to, at all times.

A duty wherein many Ministers are far short and much defective; some
Ministers full little think on it, that they are called to be the messengers of
God, Reproof of such ministers as consider not the weight of their calling.
to deliver his message to his people, if they did, they would not then deliver
their own inven ions unto them: and many have little consideration of it, that
they are put in trust with Gods people, and that the weight of their souls
does lie upon them, their idleness, their negligence, their frothy and
unprofitable teaching, plainly shows it.

I might insist in many other particulars; but for more general use of the
point, consider we, what the Apostle says, Romans 13.4.6. that even such as are
deputed of the Lord to a place of civil government, are called Ministers of
God, they have an office and a ministry. Now then, as there must be in a
Minister of the word a due consideration of his office and function, what it
is, and the the weight of it: so doubtless ought there to be in civil
governors, in public or in private, Civil governors in public or in
private, are to consider the weight of their office and calling.
be it but a master of a family, even such persons ought to see to their
ministry and office, and to consider what it is, what belongs to it, and what
is the weight of it, they are seriously to consider with themselves, that they
are deputed of the Lord to that office, and that they are in his place, and
stand in his stead, to those that are under them, and that it belongs to their
office, according to their power, to protect the innocent, to punish the
offender, to encourage the well-doer, and to discountenance and censure the
evil doer, and so to guide and govern those under them, as may before the good
of their bodies and souls: yea men that have any office or function, are to
consider what belongs to that office in particular: as, a master of a family
is seriously to consider, that it belongs to him to command things lawful, to
such as be under him, and proportionable to their strength, to provide for them
(as he is able) meat, drink and all, things needful, to yield them
moderate rest and recreation, to teach, to admonish, to correct them as just
occasion is offered, to pray with them, to pray for them, and the like; and
every one that has an office, either public or private, is to consider the
weight of that office, how much and how deeply it concerns him, to do the
duties that belong to that office, and that the doing of them so nearly
concerns him, as if he neglect them, and any under him offend, and sin,
through his default; that sin of the inferior shall increase the judgment of
the superior in the day of account. Exodus 16.27. It is said that some of the
people went out on the seventh day to gather Manna, but found none, whereupon
it is said, verse 28. that the Lord reproved Moses, and said unto him, How long
refuse ye to keep my Commandments and my Laws? Now Moses had not profaned
the Sabbath, but the people, and not all, but some of the people, yet the Lord
reproved Moses because the people that were under his charge had sinned: so
weighty a burden lies on those that have any way the oversight of others, that
they must give account in regard of their sins, if they offend through their
default, and neglect of duty; and thus ought such as have any office or
function public or private, diligently to weigh and consider with themselves,
what that office is, what belongs, unto the weight of it. Thus no doubt, did
Solomon when he made that prayer to the Lord, 1 King. 3.9. Give to thy servant
an understanding heart, that I may discern between good and bad: and he does
express as much in the last words of the verse, For who is able to judge this
thy mighty people, as if he said, I consider the weight of mine office, and I
find it great and weighty; therefore Oh Lord I beseech thee strengthen me,
and enable me to do my dutic; and to this purpose (no doubt) was that
wholesome admonition of Iehoshaphat to his Judges, 2. Chron. 19.6.7. Take heed
what ye do: for yes execute not the judgments of man, but of the Lord, and
he will be with you, in the cause and judgment. Wherefore now let the fear
of the Lord be upon you, take heed, and do it: for there is no iniquity with
the Lord our God, nether respect of persons, nor reciuing of reward. As if he
had said, diligently consider with your selves, what offiice you are called to,
what is the charge that lies upon you, what belongs to your office, you execute
not the judgments of man, but of the Lord, and he will be with you in the
cause and judgment. And consider with your selves, your charge is is so
weighty, that you must one day give account of it before the judge of all the
world, with whom is neither respect of persons nor receiving reward.

Thu are such as have any office or charge over others, be it public, or
private, duly to consider that office and change what it is, Civil governors
justly reproved for not considering the weight o^ their office and calling.
what belongs unto it, and the weight of it. Now do men that have charge over
others consider these things? Do they (as they ought) think on it, what the
office and place is which they are called to, what belongs unto it, and the
weight of it? Few there be that do so, many men are altogether careless, they
set all at six and seven, have no manner of consideration what their office
and charge is, and what belongs unto it; and most men have an eye, not to their
office and charge, and what belongs to that, but to the example of others, they
consider what other men of like place do, and they do the like, such and such
masters, (says one that is a master of a family) neither teach their
families, nor pray with them, and they thrive well enough, and therefore
thinks he, I may do the like; others again, consider only what is to be
done in their place and calling, standing best with their ease, their profit,
and their credit in the world, thus and many other ways do men fail in this
duty. Well know thou whosoever thou art, thou art to take heed and to see to
thine office, and to consider seriously what it is, what belongs unto it, and
the weight of it. And that thou may so do, learn thy duty what belongs to
thine office and calling out of the word of God. Deuteronomy. 17.19. the King is
enioined to read the word of God, all the days of his life, that thence he
may learn his duty and in the word of God the Lord has laid down, the
offices and duties of all sorts of callings, of Magistrates, Ministers,
Masters, particularly, to that end (without question) that they should learn,
know, and consider them; do thou therefore thence learn the things that
concern thine office, and knowing those things, consider them, and have an eye
to them at all times.

And to that purpose remember these two things.

1 First, Two things are to be thought upon by such as be civil gouernoure.
it is for want of taking heed to the duties of men's callings, and want of
consideration of them, that men transgress their callings, and go beyond the
bounds of their callings, and so lay themselves open to the plagues and
judgments of God, no doubt it was so with Vzziah in putting his hand to the
Arc, 2. Sam. 6.6. and the Lord smote him for it. And it was for want of
consideration of his calling, that Peter would warm himself at the High
Priests fire, Luke 22.15. It cost him the breach of his conscience, and as one
says well, if we mark the time when the judgments of God befall men, Note.
we shall find they are cast upon them when they are out of their callings.

2 Again, remember this that the want of consideration of their callings, and
the weight of them, is that which makes men careless and unconscionable in
doing their duties, for what is it that makes men, either neglect the duties of
their callings, or to do them only for fashion? Surely this, they pull away
their eyes from their callings, they look not (as they ought) to the duties of
them, and on the weight of them, but they cast their eyes to the example of
others, on their own ease, profit, or estimation in the world, and thence it
comes that they are careless and unconscionable in doing the duties of their
callings.

If then thou would not go beyond the limits of thy calling, and so lay thy
self naked and open to the judgments of God, if thou would not be
careless and unconscionable in doing the duties of thy calling, but rather do
them with care, and good conscience, and with comfort to thine own soul, then
do thou consider thine of fice, and calling, take thou heed and have an eye
to the duties of it, and to the weight of it: ever meditate and think thus
with thy self, this is mine office and calling, these are the duties that
belong to it, and they are of this weight, and consequence, that the neglect or
careless doing of them will bring down Gods judgments upon me, and I shall
one day answer for the same. Let this be thy meditation and consideration in
respect of thy place and calling whatsoever it is.

In the next place we are to mark that the Apostle bids the Colossians say to
Archippus, take heed to the ministry that thou have received in the Lord that
thou fulfill it, using as we showed, a word taken from a vessel that ought to
be full and is not, meaning this, that Archippus should (as it were) fill up
the vessel of his ministry, that he should as he had begun to do
something in his ministry, to accomplish it to the full in every respect, and
leave no part or duty of it unfulfilled, unperformed.

Where we may easily see thus much laid before us.

It is not enough for a minister of the Gospel to perform one part of his
office alone, but he must execute and fulfill all and every part of his office.
That it is not enough for a Minister of the word to begin and to continue
doing some thing that belongs to him in his place and calling, but he must
accomplish and perform all things that pertain to him in the same, it is not
sufficient for a Minister of the Gospel to take pains in one part of his
office alone, as in teaching only, exhorting only, or that he live free from
any special scandal or offense, but he must execute and fulfill all and every
part of his office and ministry, he must teach, improoue, correct, instruct,
exhort, comfort, etc. as any occasion is offered unto him; and he must watch
over his people, and go in and out before them unblameably, and so carry
himself in the discharge of his ministry; as it may truly be said of him
that he filles up the vessel of his ministry, and so performs his duty in
every respect as there can be no further duty required of him, as he is a
Minister.

And this is further taught plainly, 2 Timothy 4. Where the Apostle having laid
down the special duties that belong to a Minister of the word, with a weighty
charge pressing Timothy to the practice of them, I charge thee before God, and
before the Lord Jesus Christ, which shall judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing, and in his kingdom preach the word, be instant in season and out of
season, improve, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine: he adds
verse 5. Do the work of an Evangelist: make thy Ministry fully known: as if
he had said, these are the duties that belong to thee in thy ministry, and
think it not sufficient to do some of them, and leave the rest undone, but
do them all and every one, fulfill thy ministry, and make it fully known.

I might easily insist further on this point, Repr^fe of Ministers altogether
careless of their duty, and of such also as do their duty but in part.
and for the use of it I might hereby tax and reprove many ministers of the
word, some being altogether careless, such as labor not in any part of their
ministry, either in teaching or living unblameably, and so are far from
laboring in every part of it.

Some again, laboring in some duties of the Ministry, and not in all, as
(happily) teaching, but not exhorting, or exhorting without ground of
doctrine, or teaching and exhorting well, but living ill, and giving just cause
of scandal and offense, or living in good order without touch of any notorious
crime, yea (happily) showing forth some virtues, as mercy, love, pity toward
the poor, and such as want help, but not able to teach and to do the most
needful duty of their place and calling: these and many other ways I might
show, how some Ministers of the word fail in not fulfilling their ministry,
they leave as it were an emptiness in that vessel, they fill it not up, as it
ought to be filled, they perform it not in every respect as it ought to be
performed, but to extend the point a little further and that upon the ground
before delivered, To. 13. That such as be in place of civil government,
public or private, have a ministry given them of God, as therefore the
Minister of the word must not hold it enough for him to labor in some duties
of his ministry, and leave the rest undone, that is to fill his ministry but
in part, and not to fulfill it, and if he will fulfill his Ministry, it must
be by doing all the duties that belong to that office.

So (doubtless) ought it to be with such as have any other place or office in
public or in private, Such as be in any place of civil government must
fulfill their office, executing and doing all and every part and duty of the
same.
they must not content themselves in doing of some duties that belong to that
place, and leave the rest undone, that is to leave a gap, and an empty place
in their office, and place but they must fill it up in the execution and
performance of all and every part and duty of the same, for why? Every man in
his place and lawful calling whatsoever it be, is to be faithful; we find it
given to Moses by the Lord himself in way of commendation Number. 12.7. That he
was faithful in his office: and to Christ himself, Heb. 3.2. and it is the
Apostle rule, Romans 12.7. Let him that has an office attend on it with
diligence, and faithfulness. Now a man is not faithful, if he do some duties
that belong to his place and calling though he do them with great diligence
and pains, and leave other duties of it undone; and therefore in every place
and calling, there must be a performance of all and every duty belonging to
the same.

Again, all and every duty of every lawful calling are inioined by the
commandment of the Lord, and men are as strictly bound by the commandment of
God, to the doing of one part of their office, as another, successively and at
times fit for the doing of it, and therefore men must not content themselves
with the doing of some duties that belong to their place and calling, but they
must perform and do all and every duty of it, that is the fulfilling of their
office, and their ministry.

Reproof of such as rest in the doing of some of the duties of their place and
calling, and neglect others.
Now this is a thing little thought on by most men in the world, most men content
themselves in the doing of some duties that belong to them in their place and
calling, though they neglect others: yea some exceedingly please, themselves in
this, that they are diligent and painful in doing only some things that
concern them in their particular office and calling.

To instance but in one or two particulars. Some Parents (it may be) suffer
their children to want nothing belonging to their bodies, they give them meat,
drink and clothing, and provide all outward things needful for them: yea
sometimes they make themselves drudges to scrape up abundance of wealth for
them against aftertimes, and yet all this while neglect that duty laid upon
them, Ephesians. 6.4. of bringing up their children in instruction and information
of the Lord, that duty they perform not; and so some masters (happily) lay no
more on their servants than they are able to do, they provide for them wholesome
and sufficient meat and drink, and in season, and they give them leave to
refresh themselves at times convenient, but as for the duty of teaching and
instructing them, and praying for them, those things are not thought upon: and
yet such Parents and such Masters please themselves in that which they do, and
think they have done that which concerns them toward their children and
servants: yea sometimes they stick not to say it, they have done the part of
Parents and Masters: sometimes such Parents say to their children, we have
spared from our own backs and bellies for you, we have fared hardly, and
gone thinly clad, for you, and we have labored night and day for your good,
etc. and such Masters say to their servants, what can you complain of? have
you not had your meat and drink wholesome and good, and your wages paid you?
have we laid too much upon you, etc. thus many Parents and Masters content
themselves in doing only some things that concern them as they are Parents and
Masters, and think that in so doing they have discharged their office: but
know thou whosoever thou art, thou being a Father or a Master, it is not enough
for thee to do some duties, but thou must do all that concerns thee in that
place and calling, thou must fulfill thine office, and leave nothing undone in
it, that ought to be done.

And to this purpose,

A motive to stir up men to fulfill their office in any place or calling.
Consider that every duty in thy place and calling more nearly concerns thy
self, then those to whom it ought to be performed, for the doing of it may
bring good to them, but much more good and comfort to thy self, in testifying
thy faith, and sealing up comfort to thine own conscience: and the neglect of
it may hinder their good, but it makes thee liable to the judgment of God and
deeper condemnation, and therefore look thou fulfill thine office. Alas will some
say, I am not able to fulfill it, and to do all the duties that belong to mine
office, I am not able to teach my family. Art thou not? that is thy shame,
labor that thou may be able, and according to that ability thou have,
perform that duty, and know for thy comfort, the Lord requires not the
fulfilling of thine office, in doing the duties of it in perfect measure, that
is impossible, it is but a conceit of the Papists, that men regenerate may
fulfill the law of God in the time of this life, and may do more than they are
commanded, even works of supererrogation: that is but a fancy: do thou
therefore all and every duty of thy place and calling, and though thou do some
of them in weakness and much infirmity, yet the Lord will not cast away those
duties so performed, if thou do them in truth and sincerity of heart, but
will accept them in Christ, and let that be thy comfort.

Now touching the argument the Apostle would have to be used to persuade
Archippus to take heed to his ministry, and to the fulfilling of it, in that
he would have him stirred up thereunto, because he had received it from the
Lord, that the Lord of his grace and goodness had committed that office to
him, it is easy to be concluded from hence.

In that a minister of the gospel has received his ministry from the Lord, it
is of great weight to persuade him to a careful performance of his duty.
in that the Lord of his grace and mercy has reputed him faithful, and put
him in that office, as the Apostle says, 1 Timothy 1.12. it is a very powerful
and preuayling argument to stir up a minister of the gospel, to be diligent,
careful, faithful, and zealous in fulfilling his ministry, yea it serue^
notably to comfort him against the storms and persecutions that are or may be
raised against him in doing his duty.

For he having received his ministry from the Lord he knows the Lords arm is
long and strong enough both to sustain and uphold him,

How shall a minister of the word,

Answ.

First, if the Lord have given him a competent measure

Secondly, if he upon trial and examination being

Thirdly, if (he exercising those gifts bestowed upon

By these shall a minister know that he has received his ministry from the
Lord. They of the separation, in men, make void the calling of God? grant
this that there is some defect in the manner of their calling by men, for that
is all they stand upon, yet they having a competent measure of gifts fit for
the ministry, and exercising those gifts by allowance from men that are in
place and authority, and the Lord vouchsafing a blessing upon their labors,
it is a sufficient approbation of their calling. oh but they would have the
consent of the people in calling of ministers:



No surely, if this were true, then the argument of the Apostle was not good,
Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are
ye not my work in the Lord? If I be not an Apostle unto others, yet doubtless
I am unto you, for y^e are the seal of mine Apostleship in the Lord. The
question was whether he were a true Apostle or no: how does he prove it?
surely thus. That he was the instrument and means of their conversion, and
therefore a true Apostle; Now if it were so, that a false teacher might convert
souls, they might have said, this is no good argument, but the Apostle knew
well they could not so reply, he knew his argument to be sound and good, and if
it was a good argument to prove Paul a true Apostle, then much more is it a
good argument to prove an ordinary minister, a true minister, and called of
God, that the Lord gives a blessing to his labors for the conversion of
souls. From this argument (thou have received in the Lord) we may further
gather.

the Lord, In every lawful calling, wherein men are, they must remember that
they have received it from the lord.
and to remember that they have received it from him, that the Lord of his
grace and goodness has vouchsafed to set them in that place and calling, be
it never so mean, and if it be a place of greater eminency and dignity, men
are the more to look up to the Lord, and to consider the greatness of Gods
grace in that their advancement.

Thus did Paul, Rom: 12.3. I say through the grace that is given unto me. and 1
Cor: 15.10. by the grace of God I am that I am. and hence it is that the Lord
is wont to set out the greatness of the sin of men in high place, with the
advancement he had vouchsafed them. Thus he set out the sin of Jeroboam, of
Saul, yea of David himself, 2 Samuel: 12 17. I have anointed thee King over
Israel, and delivered thee out of the hand of Saul, etc. And this is of
excellent use and special consequence: if men in any place and calling, to
which they are lawfully called, ever look up to the Lord, and remember that
he of his grace and goodness has brought them to that place, doubtless, it
will make men content with it, be it never so mean, and if it be a place of
greater eminency, Men having an eye to the Lord, from whom they have received
their places and callings, it makes them contented and thankful, and humble,
and faithful, and conscionable, in discharging their duties.
and it will make them walk humbly in that place, yea faithful and
conscionable in doing the duties of it, knowing that as they have received it
from the Lord, so one day an account of it, is to be made to him. Kings and
other great men, may make their under officers, but we must remember that the
offices themselves are from the Lord, and though the Prince may give thee an
office, yet he cannot give thee a quietus est for thy unfaithfulness in that
office, that is above his power, therefore ever look thou to the Lord, from
whom thou have received thine office, and thus think with thy self: surely
the Lord of his goodness and grace has brought me to this office, he
ordained it before all times, that I should have this office, he has chosen
out my Fathers house, (happily) base and obscure, and me the meanest of my
brethren, he has prepared a way and means for me, to come to this place, in
my judgment, weak and unlikely, and he has prevailed over many great letts
and impediments, that stood up against me, and has put me into this place and
office. Thus think with thy self, and thus consider the grace and goodness
of the Lord in bringing thee to that place thou now hold, and thou shall
find it will be a notable means to make thee contented with thy place, and
thankful to God for it, and humble in thy self, and faithful and
conscionable in doing the duties of it.

VER. 18. The salvation by the hand of me Paul: Remember my bands. Grace be
with you, Amen.
In this Verse we have the closing or shutting up of this Epistle, The shutting
up of this Epistle.
and the Apostle shuts it up both with his own salutation to the Colossians,
and that not written by the hand of his Secretary (as the other were) but with
his own hand, The salutation by the hand of me Paul. and with his prayer to God
for them, that the grace of God might be with them, (Grace be with you) to
which is added the usual word commonly subioyned to petitions made to the Lord
(Amen.) and between these two, between the Apostles salutation and prayer, is
inserted and interlaced a short precept, that they should be mindful of him,
and remember his bands. I will first clear the words of this verse, touching
the sense and meaning of them; The salutation by the hand of me Paul:
Interpretation.
that is I Paul salute you under mine own hand; or, I Paul send salutations to
you written with mine own hand. (Remember my bands.) By bands, we are to
understand his imprisonment, which he suffered for the gospel of Christ: and
the Apostle would have the Colossians mindful of his imprisonment in praying
for him, and in making use of his sufferings for the gospel to themselves,
that they should both commend him to God in their prayers, and pray to the Lord
to give him patience, strength, and constancy in his troubles, to stand fast
in defense of the gospel, and to give him whatsoever his prisoners estate
might stand in need of, and that they should make use of his patient and
constant suffering for the truth of the Gospel to themselves, and thereby
themselves be more confirmed in the truth of the gospel, and encouraged to
bear the like troubles for it, if they should be called unto it. (Grace be
with you.) that is, the free and undeserved love and favor of God in Christ,
with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with you. (Amen.) The word Amen being
here added to the Apostles petition, it signifies his wish and desire of that
he prayed for, and it is also a testifying of his assurance to obtain that
which he prayed for; for that is the use of the word (amen) at the end and
shutting up of prayer, and so it is as much as if he had said, so be it, I wish
it so, yea I do fully believe it shall be so, I assure my self that the Lord
in his good time will grant my request. Thus then are we to conceive the
apostles mening in the words of this verse as if he had said.

I Paul send salutations to you written with mine own hand, and I would have
you mindful of my imprisonment, both in praying to God for me, that he would
give me patience, strength, and constancy in my troubles, to stand fast in the
defense of the Gospel, and that he would give me whatsoever my prisoners
estate stands in need of, and in making use of my suffering for the truth,
thereby the more to confirm you in the truth of the gospel, and to encourage
you to bear the like troubles, if you be called unto them. And the free and
undeserved love of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with
you; so I wish and desire, and do fully believe and assure my self it shall be
so. Come we now to speak of the things here laid before us, in that order
they are propounded by the holy ghost, and first of the Apostles own
salutation sent to the Colossians: he sent salutations from himself to the
Colossians, (no doubt) as a token of his true and unfeigned love to them, the
point from hence offered.

That we in like sort may salute others, and thereby testify our love unto
them.

I have already handled, and therefore I pass by it, and the thing we are
especially to mark in these words is this, that the Apostle sent his own
salutations to the Colossians, written not by the hand of his Secretary, as
the foregoing salutations were, but with his own hand. Now what might be the
reason of this? (for thence we shall gather the doctrine,) the reason of it is
given by the Apostle himself, 2 Thessalonians. 3.17. where he thus writes, The
salutation of me Paul, with mine own hand, which is the token in every
Epistle, so I write: as if he had said, I send salutations unto you written
with mine own hand, and in this manner of writing, written in these
characters, and after this form of leters (so I write) as a token and certain
mark that I use in every Epistle of mine, whereby men may know them to be
(indeed) my Epistles, and that they come from me, and are not counterfeit. We
see then the reason why the It is an old sleight of Satan and his instrument*
(if they can to thrust upon the Church forged and cou^terfet writings in stead
of true, to corru t religion and to deceive Gods people.
it was this to prevent the danger of counterfeit Epistles that might pass
under his name, that all might know by that his handwriting, that it was Paul's
own Epistle, and not one foisted, and thrust in instead of his.

Hence we may easily gather thus much.

That it is an ancient sleight of Satan, and his instruments, to thrust upon
the Church (if possibly he may) forged and counterfeit writings in stead of
true, thereby to corrupt religion, and to deceive the people of God, it is an
old stratageme, and trick of the Devil (if he can) to foist into the Church,
bastardly writings, under the names of Apostles, and other Ancient writers,
thereby to spread many errors, and for the corrupting of sound and wholesome
doctrine.

Thus it was in the Apostles time, and therefore he writ salutations with his
own hand, to prevent the danger of such counterfeit writings; yea this further
appears 2 These. 2.2. Where he does beseech them of that Church, by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by their assembling unto him, that they
should not be suddenly moved from their mind, nor troubled, neither by Spirit,
nor by word, nor by letter, as from him and the other Apostles, as if he had
said, there be some that carry about counterfeit letters under my name, but be
not you suddenly moved from your mind by such letters, bearing my name, or the
name of some other Apostle.

And this being so in ancient times, even in the time of We are not to be
troubled at this that many Popish Canons, Decrees and determinations are
fathered upon Apostles, Fathers, and Councels.
and when he was in his ruff, we are not then to think it strange, that
then many counterfeit writings were thrust upon the Church, and we must know it
is of no force, and nothing worth, which is commonly in the mouths of our
adversaries the Papists: these are the Canons of the Apostles, these are the
Decrees of the Fathers, these are the determinations of Councels; for many
times such Canons, Decrees, and determinations, carrying the names of Apostles,
Fathers, and Councels, if they be duly examined, prove no better then the
idle dreams of fat-bellied Monckes; we find many counterfeit writings fathered
on men of ancient times, which (indeed) were never known to them, yea from
this sleight of the Devil came those forged Gospels of Nichodemus, of Thomas,
of Bartholmew, the Acts of Abdias, and many counterfeit Epistles, as that to
Laodicea, etc.

Now then for further use of this to our selves.

It is needful ^here should be some infallible works by which men should know
Scripture to be Canonical
there must needs be some infallible notes by which the writings of the
Prophets and Apostles, may be discerned, and distinguished from all other
writings of men whatsoever, and whereby men may be certified and assured that
they are the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, and so indeed the true word
of God.

Now what be these marks may somy say? If the Papists answer this question,
they will tell you, the mark by which we may know Scripture to be true
Canonical Scripture, The Popish note and mark of Canonical Scripture.
is the testimony and tradition of the Church, because the Church says so,
and it is the tradition of the Church, that these and these are the Prophets
and Apostles; and therefore we know them to be so; but this cannot be an
infallible note and mark whereby we may know Scripture to be Scripture,
because the authority of the Church is inferior to the Scripture, the
excellency and authority of Scripture being above all men and Angels, as
appears Gal. 1.8. Therefore the Church cannot authorize the word of God, and
certainly assure men, this is Scripture, this is not; The Ministry of the
Church may induce and move men to assent to the Scripture, Note.
but it cannot authorize it in the mind and conscience of any; no, True and
infallible marks and notes of Canonical Scripture.
no, there be other infallible notes and marks, by which we may know
Scripture to be Scripture, and those perpetual, as namely.

1 The evidence of the Spirit imprinted in the Scripture, and showing it self
in every line of it. 2 The purity and perfection of Scripture. 3 The consent of
one part with another. 4 The antiquity of it. 5 The majesty of it in
plainness of speech. 6 The power of it over the conscience. and 7 The
wonderful effect of it; the Gospel being contrary to man's corrupt nature,
yet has it in all ages won men to it. 8 The certain prophesies of things to
come, which none but God could foretell. 9 The admirable preservation of it
against time and tyrants. 10 The Devils rage against them that follow it. 11
The judgments of God, that have befallen such as opposed it. 12 The constant
sufferings of many millions that have shed their blood for the Gospel of
Christ.
These, and many other like, are notes and marks whereby we may discern, and
certainly know the writings of the Prophets and Apostles to be their writings,
and may distinguish them from al other writings whatsoever.

And touching these, and the like infallible notes of Scripture, we must find
them so to our selves, they must be means to settle our consciences, and to
assure us that the Canonical books of the old and new testament, are (indeed)
the word of God.

It is to be feared, We are to be persuaded that the books of the old and new
Testament are the word of God.
if the Lord should suffer Religion to be altered with the time, that many
amongst us would be found unsettled touching this point, and would be ready to
yield consent to any counterset writings in stead of the Scripture, time of
trial may come we know not how soon; therefore labor thou to be settled in
this assurance, that the Canonical writings of the Prophets and Apostles are
indeed the word of the eternal God, and never rest till thou be thereunto
persuaded by the evidence of the Spirit imprinted in them, and by the purity,
perfection, majesty, power, and spiritual grace, appearing in them, yea,
never rest till thou find that Spirit and grace powerful in thine own heart,
and then undoubtedly, Note.
though never a man in the world acknowledge Scripture to be Scripture, yet thy
heart seasoned with grace, will make thy mouth confess it.

And so much of the Apostles salutation written with his own hand.

Now to his precept (Remember my bands) be mindful of my imprisonment in
praying for me, and in making use of it to yourselues.

Where first we may observe, that the Apostle did not dissolutely cast off the
care of his own estate, he was not secure, as presuming upon his strength in
time of his trouble, but himsefe begged of God continually, and he requested
the Church also to beg for him, whatsoever should be needful for him in that
estate.

Whence we learn thus much, I will but name it.

Gods children should be far from carnal security and confidence in their
strength and wisdom in time of their affliction
Gods children should be far from presuming and lifting up themselves in
regard of their strength in time of trial, by sickness, imprisonment or the
like, they should then be instant with the Lord in prayer themselves, for
strength, patience, and comfort, and all graces needful, and also entreat
others to be mindful of them in their prayers to that purpose in time of
trouble and trial, even the best and dearest of Gods children have need of
other men's help by their prayers to recommend them to God, craving for them
strength, and patience, and comfort.

It is an easy matter to see and acknowledge Gods mercy, Gods children are to
seek to God for strength, power, and comfort in time of their trouble.
and to rest contented therewith. But it is hard to the best to do it in time
of trouble, and affliction, and to quiet themselves with Gods disposing hand in
the day of trouble, sickness, or any other distress, is no easy matter for
the best of Gods children: and therefore then they are to call upon God for
strength, patience, and comfort themselves, and to entreat others to do the
like for them.

This point I further handled, verse the 3. and therefore I pass by it and
come to consider the precept it self, (Remember my bands.)

Where we are plainly taught this duty.

That we are to take knowledge of the afflictions of our brethren, and to be
mindful of them, We are to take notice of the afflictions of our brethren,
and to be so mindful of them as that we help and relieve them what we are
able.
yea so mindful of them, as that we reach out our helping hand to them by
prayer, by comfort, or otherwise, as occasion shall be offered unto us.

And this is further most plainly taught, Heb. 13.3. Remember (says the
author of that Epistle) them that are in bonds, as though ye were bound with
them: and them that are in affliction, as if ye were also afflicted in the
body. If our selves were in prison, or any way afflicted, without question, we
would be so mindful of our selves, as we would earnestly call upon God for
ease, comfort, release, and deliverance, and we would use all good means we
were able to relieve our selves, so ought we to do to our brethren in time of
their affliction, even to pray for their ease, comfort and deliverance, and to
comfort and help them, as if we were in their stead.

The reason and ground of this we find, 1. Cor. 12.26. We are members of one
body, and therefore should have a feeling of the hurt one of another, and be
touched with it: yea so touched, as that we should be careful for the good of
one another. We have often had occasion to speak of this point, yet it cannot
to often be remembered, it is a duty wherein we are much defective: it was the
complaint of the Prophet Amos 6.4.5.6. that men in his time did lie on their
beds, and stretch themselves on their beds, and eat the lambs of the flock,
and calves out of the stall; they sing to the sound of the Violl, they invent
to themselves instruments of music like David. They drink wine in bowls,
and anointed themselves with the chief ointment, but no man was sorry for the
affliction of Joseph, Just reproof of those who enjoying many good things
pass their time in iollity, and forget the affliction of their poor brethren.
well know thou whosoever thou art, this is thy duty, thou enjoying health and
prosperity, thou art to have in thee a feeling remembrance of the miseries of
others, we have a notable example in Daniell, though he himself was in great
honor preferred above all the Princes of Persia, and second to the King, yet
when he saw the captivity of Gods people still continued, and the people of
God still oppressed by the heathen, his heart was heavy, his soul melted
within him, and he humbled his soul with fasting, Daniel. 9.3. so if thou see
or hear that the people of God, or any one of Gods children are in bonds, or
any way afflicted, thy self enjoying liberty and freedom from the like
affliction, and having cause of rejoicing for thy prosperity, thy heart ought
to be resolved into sorrow, for their affliction, and to be touched with a
feeling of it, and thou art to express thy sorrow by prayers and tears, and
to reach out thy helping hand unto them as occasion shall be offered unto thee,
and know thus much, that if thine heart be so taken up with the consideration
of thine own prosperity that sorrow for the affliction of others cannot enter
into it, yea such sorrow as will break out into prayers and tears, certainly
thy heart is not right within thee.

One thing yet remains which is offered unto us from this precept (remember my
bonds,) the Apostle would have the Colossians remember his bonds by making use
of them to themselves for their own confirmation in the truth of the Gospel,
the point from hence is this.

Other men's sufferings for the Gospel seen or heard of by us should become
profitable to us, they should make us more firmly cleave to the truth of the
Gospel, We are to profit by the afflictions of others that are known to us.

How we are to profit by them.


more soundly to profess it, yea thereby we should be the more moved to
renounce the vanities of the world, from which we are called by the voice of
the Gospel.

And consider we but thus much, have and do the Saints of God suffer much for
the profession of the Gospel; yea have holy martyrs endured extreme torments,
and shed their blood for the truth of the Gospel? and cannot or do not these
things seen or heard of move thee to leave the vanities of the world, and more
soundly and sincerely to profess the truth of the Gospel? surely then thou
have not profited by the consideration of their sufferings as thou ought,
and one day the suffering of the Saints, and the blood of the Martyrs shall
rise up in judgment against thee: see more of this chap. 1.24.

Come we to the Apostles prayer, with which he shuts up his Epistle it being
(indeed) the last words of his Epistle (grace be with you) his meaning (as
before we showed) in this prayer is thus much, the free and undeserved love and
favor of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it be with you, so I
wish, and I do fully believe it shall be so, it may be some may desire for the
better understanding of this prayer, to be informed more particularly what be
those fruits, and what be those tokens of Gods free and undeserved love in
Christ, The fruits of Gods free love and favor in Christ.
let them know in a word, that the fruits of it are all spiritual blessings as
the Apostle calls them Ephesians. 1.3. wherewith the Lord does bless his chosen in
Christ, belonging to their eternal life and salvation, as (namely) remission
of sins, Justification, adoption, sanctification, etc. and the tokens of that
free and undeserved love of God in Christ are these, The tokens of Gods free
love and savor in Christ.
the holy means of salvation vouchsafed and made effectual to Gods chosen by
the operation of his Spirit, the sense and feeling of Grace in their hearts,
temporal good things rightly and purely used. One grace or good thing taken
away from them, and supplied by an other vouchsafed unto them, affliction
sanctified and made profitable to them and the like, and so this prayer of the
Apostle (grace be with you) comprehends a desire of much good to the
Colossians. And thus more fully understanding the words, come we to the matter
of instruction hence offered; and first in that the Apostle concludes with this
petition only, (Grace be with you) in that he wishes to the Colossians no
other good thing but this, that Gods free grace and love might be with them, we
may easily gather thus much

That nothing is more excellent, or more to be wished Nothing is more to be
desired and sought after then the free grace and favor of God in Christ.
with the fruits and tokens of it, is to be desired and sought after as the
chiefest good thing and above all things whatsoever.

We have a notable example to this purpose in David, Psalm. 4.6.7. there be
many that say who will show us any good? but Lord lift up the light of thy
countenance upon us. Thou have given me more joy of heart, then they have had,
when their wheat and wine did abound, as if he had said, let others in the
world desire, and seek after what they will, as riches, pleasures, honors,
and the like, my chief desire is of the grace and favor of the Lord, Lord
lift up the light of thy countenance upon me, therein stands my chief joy
and comfort, yea I find more true joy and comfort in that, then in the
increase of corn and wine, and in all the riches of the world. Thus also stood
Paul affected, Philip. 3.8. he counted all things but loss, for the excellent
knowledge sake of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have counted all things
loss, and do judge them to be doung, that I might win Christ, verse. 9. and
that he might be found in Christ, and so in the favor of God thorough him, and
there be many reasons of this why the grace and favor of God in Christ should
be desired and sought after above all other things.

are common to them with the wicked.

Secondly the grace and favor of God in Christ is the root and ground of all
good things profitable and comfortable in this life, and in the life to come,
it does entitle us to all the comforts and good things of this life, and of the
life to come, there is no good thing belonging to this life or the life to
come, that comes from any other cause or ground but from the grace and favor
of God in Christ, without that we have no title to the least blessing or good
thing whatsoever, no not the least crumme of bread: and

Thirdly, the grace and favor of God in Christ, is that alone which does
season and sweeten all the outward things of this life, and makes them truly
comfortable, and indeed blessings unto us, without which, they are but an heap
of miseries, and (as the Preacher speaks in the book of Ecclesiastes)
accursed vanities and bitter vexations of spirit, given to make men more
inexcusable, and to plunge them into deeper condemnation.

These reasons do sufficiently clear it, that the grace and favor of God in
Christ is to be desired and sought after above all other things, and let not
this be a matter of speculation, a matter of knowledge only. Our hearts are to
be affected with the excellency of Gods grace and favor in Christ, that we may
seek after it above all other things.
it is the common course of the most in the world, to toil and moyle, to
trudge up and down night and day, far and near, seeking after wealth,
honor, pleasures, preferment, etc. but as for the favor of God in Christ,
they regard it not, they have little or no care to find any assurance of that
at all. Well, we must not only be able to speak of the grace and favor of
God in Christ, and to commend it, and say, oh it is better worth then all the
riches in the world, but the excellency of it must stir us up to desire it,
and to spend both time and strength in seeking after it above all other things,
and this we shall never do till we find our selves to stand in need of it,
we must find our selves to stand in extreme need of Gods grace and favor in
Christ. We must find our selves to stand in extreme need of Gods grace and
favor in Christ.


Happily some will say, is there any that thinks he stands not in need of Gods
grace and favor in Christ?

Indeed every one in general terms will say he is a sinner, and will
confess that he stands in need of Gods grace in Christ, but yet many find not
themselves to stand in extreme need of it, and that may thus appear: do not
many in the world account great sins, little sins, and little sins no
sins at all? do they not esteem Sabbath breaking, customary swearing, idle
and foolish talking, petty trifling sins? and if they be reproved for these
sins, be not their answers ready? do you make this so great a matter, a
little working in the morning on the Sabbath, selling of a triflle on that day,
now and then swearing and jesting a little? why, this is nothing, I pray God I
never do worse, and then I hope I shall do well enough, and as for such as
make conscience of these things, and carefully seek after assurance of Gods
grace and favor in Christ, do they not load them with odious and reproachful
nicknames, calling them puritanes, hypocrites, dissemblers and the like? Now
what be these things (I beseech you) but plain evidences, and demonstrations,
that howsoever many say they are sinners, and they stand in need of Gods grace
in Christ, yet they think they stand not in so great need of it as indeed they
do? Labor we therefore to find our selves to stand in extreme need of the
grace of God in Christ, and to find our selves without that in a most miserable
case, in respect of the least of our sins, and finding our great need of Gods
grace in Christ, let us hunger and thirst after it above all things in the
world, and be stirred up carefully to use the means that serve to work and
increase assurance of Gods grace and favor toward us, and to seal it up in
our hearts, as namely, frequent and diligent hearing, reading and meditating in
the word of God, prayer, use of the Sacraments and the like, and yet further
to stir us up to affect the grace of God in Christ, and to seek after it
above all other things, consider these things.

1 First, if a man be as wealthy as ever was Solomon, Two motives to stir us
up to affect Gods grace in Christ, and to seek after it above al other things.
so that gold be as plentiful with him as chips or stones in the street, and
he enioyes that wealth all his life, which is very uncertain, as Job says
18.15. Brimstome is scattered on the house of the wicked, it is fit matter for
Gods vengeance, if the fire of Gods wrath but touch it, it kindles presently
and consumes all, but suppose he enjoy his wealth for the space of four score
years, or an hundred years, yet if he want the grace of God in Christ, he is
sure to have hell for ever, and he that loses his soul for the gain of all
the world, has but a miserable bargain.

2 Again, consider we that it is not all the wealth in the world that can do
us any good in time of distress of conscience, and in the pangs of death; no,
no, when a man is galled with the gripes of a guilty conscience, it is not all
the world (if it were his) that could purchase the least dram of that comfort
Gods children find in their sealed apprehension of Gods favor toward them,
and it is only that that will minister comfort in time of distress of mind,
and in the hour of death, and therefore learn thou to prize the grace of God
in Christ as it ought to be prized, and let thy heart be set on it as the
most excellent thing in the world. Labor to see thy self stand in extreme
need of it, hunger and thirst after it, and seek for it above all things, and
never rest seeking till thou find some assurance that it belongs to thee.

And that thou be not deceived remember the tokens of it before spoken of.
Never rest till thou find the holy means of salvation powerful unto thee to
thy true conversion, and to the working of grace in thee, and that thou have
some feeling of grace in thine heart, and that if the Lord give thee temporal
good things, thou have also power to use them aright, and do use them purely,
with prayer, and to right ends; not to riot, pride, and to wantonness, but to
the glory of God, and to the good of thy self, and others, and that if the
Lord take away some good things from thee, he supplies it another way; as if
he take from thee health, wealth, or the like, yet he makes supply, by giving
thee patience, and contentment, and that if thou be afflicted, thy afflictions
are sanctified unto thee, and thou art made better by them, and if thou find
these and the like tokens, comfort thy self, and assure thy self, Gods grace
and favor in Christ belongs to thee; and howsoever these, Note.
and the like tokens and signs of Gods grace, and the sense of it in thine
heart, may be lost for a time, yet Gods favor it self can never be lost,
but when all other things fail thee, that will stand by thee, and continue
with thee for ever.

In the next place note we in a word, that our Apostle begun with his wish of
grace, to the Colossians, Cap. 1.2 Grace be with you and peace from God our
Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ: and here he ends with the same wish,
Grace be with you.



That the free grace of God is the beginning and the end of all, it is all in
all in the matter of our salvation. Gods free grace is all in all in the matter
of salvation.
And this may be easily further confirmed, for why? Election is of grace, Romans
11.5. Vocation is of grace, 2 Timothy 1.9. Justification is freely by grace, Romans
3.24. Faith is of grace, Phil. 2.13. Eternal life and salvation is of grace,
Romans 6.23. Man's merit has no place in that matter of salvation.
that our adversaries, the Papists, hold and maintain? Certainly Gods free
grace and man's merit cannot stand together; if all be of grace, there can be
no works of preparation, meriting ex congruo (as they speak) not any work
meriting ex condigno, these be but dreams, and devices of idle brains.

I leave them, and come to the last word, (Amen) In which the Apostle, as we
showed) signifies his desire of the things he prayed for, and testifies his
assurance to obtain them. Touching desire in prayer, I have heretofore spoken.
Now concerning assurance of obtaining things prayed for, signified in this word
(Amen) know thus much.

That we must come to the Lord in prayer with assurance We must pray to the
Lord with assurance to be heard.
we must be able to say Amen to our prayers: assent and affiance of heart must
go with the request of our lips made to the Lord, we must by faith rest on
God, for the accomplishment of the things we have heartily dersied. Mark
11.24. Says Christ, whatsoever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye
shall have it, and it shall be done unto you. Iam. 1.6. But let him ask in
faith, and waver not.

And that we err not touching this point, know that our faith in prayer must
rest on the promise of God, Faith in prayer must rest on Gods promise.
and must believe the Lord will grant the things we pray for, as he has
promised them, the good things of this life, if the giving of them be for his
glory, and our good, and spiritual good things absolutely. Thus must our faith
in prayer ever have relation to Gods promise.

Some may object, Psalm. 107. David shows at large, that when men are in
distress and misery, both believers, and unbelievers, they cry unto the Lord,
and he delivers them out of their distress; he gives there many instances,
therefore it may seem that faith is not always necessary in prayer, to make
it acceptable to God?

Answer: Iam. 5.4. Behold the hire of the laborers which have reaped your
fields (which is of you kept back by fraud) cries, and the cries of them
which have reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of hoasts. It is
thence clear, that oppression, and defrauding of the poor, be crying sins,
and the cries of the oppressed bring down Gods vengeance on their oppressors,
God does sometimes hear the cries and complaints of unbelievers, Two causes
why God sometimes hears the cries of unbelievers.
regarding their cause (namely) their wrongs, and oppressions, not their
persons, or prayers: and this he does for two causes.

1 First, to set forth the greatness of his mercy, that reaches even to
unbelievers, as he suffers the Sun to shine, and the rain to fall on the
just and on the unjust, Math. 5.45. so he does not contemn the tears of them
whose cause is just, and calls for judgment, though themselves be wicked.

2 Secondly, God sometimes hears the complaints of unbelievers, regarding
their cause, not their persons, or prayers, thereby to stir up true believers
to call on him more earnestly, when they see that even the cries and the tears
of the wicked are not fruitless, it is a notable inducemcement to stir up
true believers to be earnest in prayer.

And let the consideration of it stir thee up that art a true believer, even to
come to the Lord in the prayer of faith. Gods mercy to unbelievers considered
must stir up true believers to come to the Lord in the prayer of faith.
Does the Lord sometimes hear the cries and complaints of unbelievers, which
have no promise made unto them? Then do thou remember the promise of God made
to thee, and rest upon it by faith, according to the tenor of it, say Amen to
thy prayers. Let the assent and affiance of thine heart go together with thy
voice, and then undoubtedly the Lord according to his promise, will hear and
grant thy request.

From the word Amen, some object on this manner.

unknown tongue, and a whole prayer in an unknown tongue?

Answer: (Amen) be a word of an unknown tongue, yet by use it is become as
familiar as any other English word, and therefore this makes nothing for the
defense of Popish prayer in an unknown tongue.

Soli Deo gloria.
FINIS.
