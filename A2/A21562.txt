Here begins a little treatise shortly compyled and called ars moriendi.
that is to say the craft for to deye for the health of man's soul.
When any of lyklyhode shall deye / then is most necessary to have a
special friend / the which will hertly help and pray for him / and therewith
counsel the syke for the we will of his soul / and more over to se that all
other so do about him / or else quyckly for to make him depart. Then is to
be remembered the great benefaytes of god done for him unto that time / and
specially of the passion of our lord and then is to be read some storye of
saints or the vij. psalms with the letanye / of our lady sawter in part or
hoole with other. And ever the image of the crucyfixe is to be had in his sight
with other. And holy water is oftymes to be cast upon and about hy^ for
avoiding of evil spyrytes ye which then^e be full ready to take their
auau^tage of the soul if they may. And then and ever make him cry for mercy
and grace and for the help of our blessed lady and of other saints in whom
before he had a synguler trust and love / and thereupon to make his prayers if he
may. When death comes or any grievous panges other great sykenes / then prayer
or deuocy on asswageth / wherefore it is wisdom for one to pray before any
sykenesse come / and also when one may in his sykenesse if he will not be
deccyued. So he is happy and may be glad that such a time of most need has a
faithful friend and yt will say beside the prayers before rehearsed and cause /
other also to say devoutly in remembrance of the charity of Ihesu Christ and
of his passion / and for to have the rather his mercy and help.iij. Pr^nr^
and.iij. Auees with a Credo / and therewith to exhort him by a priest or for
need by an other in the manner as it follows.

Brother or sister remember well yt god says by his prophet and euangelyst.
Blessed be tho that deye and depart in our lord / yt is to say from the
world and his pleasures / and deye in the true faith of the church and
repentance for his sins. Sir ye have great cause to be glad for to depart
from this wretched world and fall of all mysery / and think that ye needs
must depart / and desire hertly to be with Ihesu Christ your maker / redemer /
and lord god / for he shall give to you now your enherytau^ce that he did bye
for you with his precious passion and blood / wherefore this time of your
departing shall be better to you than the time of your birth / for now all
sykenesse sorrow and trouble shall depart now from you for ever. Therefore be
not agreued with your sykenesse and take it not with grutchynge but take it
rather by all gladness. Se at all times that ye be stable in your faith and
believe / and say your Credo if that ye may or else desire an other hertly to
do it for you here before us openly. And arm you ever with the sign of the
cross as a christian man for your defense against your ghostly enemies / in ye
which doing / god will be greatly pleased and the rather take you for one of
his folk by proteccyon and grace and as his child of salvation. have ever a
good and true believe / and no thing may be Impossyble unto you. And ever
beware that ye fall not in dyspeyre for that gretely would dysplease god / and
can not be remedyed. And remember the sins done before time shall never hurt
you as to dampnacyon / if they please you not now and that ye be sorry for them.
Saint Jerome says / if one should take his sykenesse or his death with
grutchynge / it is a token yt he loves not god suffycyently / all is ryghtwyse
that we snffre. Desire with saint Austen of our lord here to be cut with
trybulacyon and to be brenned with sickness and sorrow / so that ye may be
saved herafter for ever. Now meke your self and he sorry that ye have been so
unkind to please and to keep his commandments and presume not as of your
self any goodness / and say with all mekenes thus. Good lord Ihesu Christ I
knowleche that I have sinned grievously / and by thy grace I will gladdely
amend me if I should live / have mercy now of me for thy bitter passion. Than
ask him these questyons following before his death.

BE ye glad that ye shall deye in christian believe. Let him answer / ye / know
ye that ye have not so well lived as ye should / ye / have ye will to amend if
that ye should live / ye / believe ye that Ihesu Christ gods sone of heaven was
born of the blessed virgyn Marye / ye / believe ye also that Ihesu Christ deyed
upon the cross to bye man's soul on good frydaye / ye / do ye thank god
therefore / ye / Believe ye that ye may not be saved but by his passion and death
/ ye / As long as the soul is in your body thank god for his death / and have
a sure trust by it and his passion to be saved. And counseyll him to say if
that he may these following words of great virtue.

I Put Crystis passion betwix me and mine evil works / and betwix me and his
wrath. Now lord god be mercyful to me a sinner. The pease of our lord Ihesu
Christ and the virtue of his passion with the sign of the holy cross and the
vndefoyled virgynyte of the blessed Mary his mother / and the blessing of all
saints / and the proteccy on of all holy angels with the help and prayer of
all saints be betwix me and all mine enemies now and in the hour of my death
and departing Amen. Also these verses following be of great virtue in the time
of death / and to be said of the syke if he may or by an other for him.
Disrupisti dn^e vincula mea tibi sacrificabo hostia^ laudis. et nomen dm^
inuocabo. Deus propicius esto michi peccatori. Dn^e thu xp^e ego cognosco me
grauiter peccasse. et libenter volo me emendare per gra^m tua^. Miserere mei
propter amara^ passione^ tua^. Dn^e thu redemisti nos in sanguine tuo. laus sit
tibi pro amara passione tua Largire claru^ vespe. quo vita nusquam decidat. sed
premiu^ mortis sacre perennis instet gloria. Also to our Lady.Maria plena
gracie matter misericordie. tu nos ab host protege.et in hora mortis suscipe.
And at last. In manus tuas dn^e co^mendo spiritu^ meu^. In noie patris et
filij and spiritus sancti Amen

here follows a short and sweet remembrance of the sacrament of ye awter or
yt it be reccyued of the syke person or of any other before there comunynge
WElcome blessed Ihu my lord god and savior to whom is apropryed all mercy
and pity. Remember good lord how freyll my nature and substance is / and have
mercy and pity on me great sinner / after thy great mercyes and for thy bitter
passion for I knowleche and believe faithfully as a christian child of thyn /
that thou here in form of bread / is the same my lord god that of thy
goodness come down from heaven and was born and took my nature of the blessed
virgyne Mary / and deyed for me and rose the third day and after ascended in
to heaven / and there reygneth with the fader and the holy ghost and all saints
for ever Immortal / the which for our great health freylte and daily
transgressyon and in remembrance of thy great love and passion haste ordained
this thy blessed body in this wise to be taken of me and of all other willing
to be saved. I know well that I am far unworthy to be called thy child or
servant for the great multitude of my sins / how be it you may make me
ryghtfull and able the which oonly of sinners have made great saints of
heaven. By the thy great power and might grant me now to take the mekely in
all fere and in waylynge for my sins and with spyrytuall gladness. Come now
good lord in to my heart and cleanse it of all sin / enter in to my soul and
make it hole / and therewith sanctyfye me within and without / and be my defense
for body and soul rebukynge and putting a side all mine enmyes far from the
presence of thy power / that I then so defended by the may have a free and
sure passage to thy kingdom where I shall not se the in this form by mystery
but I shall se the face to face where I shall never hungre ne thirst / but
ever be in Joy with the and thine / there to glorefye the and to worship ye to
laud and to pray the world withouten end Amen.

By these following aren venyall sins taken away if they be done devoutly.
IN taking holy water holy bread / also by saying of the Pater nr^ / and
spyrytually for this clause and petycyon. Dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et
nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. And also by knocking of the breast for ones
sins and also for saying of Deus propicius esto michi pcco^ri / and by
saying the common Confyteor at mass or at other time. Also by receyuynge of
any of the sacraments of the church / and specially of the body of our lord.
Also by herynge of mass / and by the sight of the sacrament of the awter there
or else where. By the blessing of a bishop or of a preeste at his mass. By
any of the deeds of mercy / by pardons / by martyrdom / and penance / by
forgeuenes to a trespasour / by good ensample geuynge / or for converting of
other to good life / by pacyence thanking in trouble / and by contrycyon of
sins with dyspleasure of hem. And for every good deed doing with good intent
and devotion Amen.

The famous doctor John Gerson Chau^seler of Paris taking his ground of holy
scripture and according with holy doctors says thus.
Ovre most merciful fader lord god / knowing our freylte and redynesse to
al sin / is ever ready during this wretchyd and mortal life by many and
diverse ways to forgive us ever our trespace and to grant and give us his
grace / if so be that truly we do ordeyne unto him these.iij. virtues so
lowynge / so that they be said and done with all the heart devoutly. The
first is that thou shall say. Blessed lord I knowleche that I have sinned
grievously against thy goodness thus and thus rehersynge thy sins / and I am
dyspleased therewith by reason of the which I do penance and will do / for I
know well that I have grieved the merciful lord and broken thy
commandments in the which thou oonly ought to be worshypped. The second /
say this. Good lord I have a good purpose and desire with thy help / to be
right ware hereafter that I fall not in to sin / and I entende to flee the
occasyons after the possybylyte of my power. The third is this. Gracyous lord
I have good will to make an hole confession of all my sins / when place and
time co^uenyent may be had according to thy commandments and al holy
church. These.iij. verytees or true these who so ever says with his heart
vnfaynyngly in what place yt ever he be / he may be sure yt he is in the state
of grace and saluaco^n and yt he shall have ever lasting life though all he had
done all the sins of the world. And if he decessed without any other
confession for lack of a priest as slepynge or sodeyne death / he should be save
suffryng before hard pain in purgatory / wherefore it is good cou^seyl yt every
christian man ones or twyes on ye day erly or late or else at lest on holy
days examen his conscience / and remember if yt he may with all his heart
vnfaynyngly this said.iij. trewthes / and if he can so do / he may be sure yt
he is in the state of grace / and if he may not / but is in will to sin again
/ and to have his delectaco^n with deed / and will not flee the occasyons of
mortal ly^nes / and so drowned in sin will not arise / such one may be
certain yt the Pope may not assoyle hy^ not for thy good it is yt such one
use much prayer and give alms and do other good deeds after their power /
that god the rather may lyghten their hertes and the sooner torn to goodness
Amen.

Here follows a synguler prayer to be said in the fest of the dedycacyon of
any church or at any other time.
O Myghtyfull and most pyteuous lord god Ihesu Christ which of thy great
goodness has ordained all things that been in heaven and in earth for the use
and we will of man / to the entente and end that they shall serve him / and he
the allone. And how be it that in each place thou ought to be served and
worshypped / yet it pleases the much more such service and prayer in a place
or church that is dedyfyed / enueyled and hallowed by a bishop and his
mynystres with ympnes / psalms / and letanyes / and other suffragyes with
their mysteryall obseruantes ordained therefore / and for by cause thy precious
body and blood is there daily offered up unto thy fader in heaven in knowleche of
thy great love and passion that thou had for man. And if it pleased the in
the old testament with thyn angels night and day to be assystent and to here
the prayers of thy servants in the temple / where was but flesh and blood of
unreasonable beestes offered in sacrefyce / much more we trust that thou wylt
vysyte and be assystent to us night and day with thyn angels in this thy new
temple and church / where thyn own body and very blood daily is offered up
unto thy fader of heaven / and therewith received according to thy desire and
will of us thy servants though sinners for our salvation and thereto here the
prayers of us and other that entende to love worship and thank the in the best
manner we can or may. Now then blessed lord full of all mercy and pity / that
will that we call upon the and has promised to here the prayers of thy
servants grant now and at all times to us and to all other of thy
superhabundant mercy and grace / that who so ever come unto this church or to
any other with deuoco^n and pray in what caas that ever they be / prosperyte
temptacyon / trouble / or aduersyte / that their petycyon behouefull and
necessary prayer may be herd / and that the pardone granted to them may in
her souls and bodies with all other things apperteynynge unto them may take
effect in every part gracyously. And over this grant us of thy pity / pease
and accord in thy church and realm / and to our fou^ders faders and moders /
friends / benefactours / and to all christian souls / forgeuenes of their sins
with relesse of their pains and Joye perpetual. And finally we desire of thy
bounteuous goodness seasonable weder with fruytes and to exclude from us
pestylence hungre moreyne and sickness and all enemies ghostly and bodily and
therewith grant us of thy grace good life and endelesse bliss. Amen.

Here folowen the.xij. degrees of humylyte.
Cast thy sight donewarde / and show meekness both in thy heart and body.
Beware of high speech and clamorous / and se that thy words be few / well
set / and reasonable. Be not light for to laughe / but use ever sadness Be
stylle and keep silence / to need require that answer must be had. Keep
well the common rule as the holy place has used. Think the most vylest of all
other and so pronounce thy self. Knowleche the unworthy and not prouffytable
to any thing / and so believe in deed. Make often confession of thy sins / and
that with great contrycyon. Keep pacyence in thyn obedyence / at all thy pains
and trouble. To all people be you subget for thy masters sake Thyn own will
forsake it / and love it in no wise And ever keep the from sin for fere of
him above.
The.vij. degrees of obedyence.
The first is to do that is commanded of thy sovereign without grutchynge.
The second is to make none excepco^n / neither of the time neither of the deed
yt is to be done. The third is to be glad and cherefull in thy heart to do
such deeds commanded without any compulsyon setting a side all beestly
condycyons. The.iiij. is to be quycke in such deed doing leuynge all other
occupacyons for that time or any manner of excuse. The.v. is to do such things
with all thy might and power / thinking yt thy reward shall be great. The.vi. is
to do hem also with all meekness both in spyryte and gesture. The.vij. is to
continue such obedyence to the end of thy life ever following thy master Ihu
christ that was made obedyent for thy sin unto death.
The.xij. degrees of pacyence.
The.xij. degrees of pacyence thou may behold here. To evil done to the or
aduersyte make no resystence. Do not evil for evil ne give an evil answer
Love thyn enemy and do good for evil to him in recompense. Grutche not
against aduersyte / but take it as sweet encence. Account it for best medycyne
/ and be glad in thy pain. Thank god therefore / and look for more with all
benyuolence. And when you have no grutchynge in these then may thou be
feign.
The.xv. degrees of charity.
These make perfyte charity after Pouls epistle Be pacyence contynuell for any
aduersyte. Lyberall to the nedy / and good do for evil. Of other men's
welfare envy not ne by heavy Let not by thy crokednesse good works to
multyplye. Swelle not Inward by malice if thy neighbor prospere. Love to be
in low degree and loathe to be high. To labor for other as thy self do thy
utter deuoyre. Be not moeuyd for any cause to vengeance or to Ire. Think none
evil to an other for any prouocacyon. Joy thou not in wickedness but sorrow
thou rather. Be glad in truth and ryghtwysnesse and hate symulacyon. For
such right bear aduersyte or any trybulaco^n To yt the church techeth the put
full credulyte. That god has promised trust it well without defallacyon. In
hope abiding his reward and everlasting glory. Amen.
