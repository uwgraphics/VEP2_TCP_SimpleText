justices shall do the king to wit thereof / and the king shall take him in
his grace if it please him. It is provided also that no appeal shall be abated so
sone as they have been / but if the appellour declare the deed the year / the
day / the hour / the time of the king / and the town / where the deed was

shall not be abated for defaute of fresh suit whereby the party shall sue
within the year and the day after the deed done.

moved his plee upon good right that he had the judgment shall be given forth
with / and if it be found by inquest that he impleded him by fraud to make

youen at Gloucestre the.iiii. day of Octobre ye.vi. year of the reygne of
king Edward sone of king Henry.
Here ends the statute of Gloucestre.
Exposycyons upon the statute of Gloucestre.
Afterward by the king our soueraygne lord and his justices certain expo
sycyons were made upon some of the artycles about mencyoned / and as to the
first article / that for entrees by dysseson damages shall run from the time
of the statute publyshed / likewise of wryttes of enter upon dysseson of
damages in all wryttes of mortdauncetour / cosynage / ayel / and besayel / of
intrusyon by a man's own act by any manner of writ* damages shall ^u^ne after
the writ purchased against that held by statute / all be it that their
auncetours dyed seized thereof. Of inquerye to be made touching such as be
within age the statute shall run without lymytacyon of time / of the
alyenacyon of lands holden by the law of England the statute shall run for
such lands being alyened after the time of the statute publyshed. In like
manner the statute shall extend and run upon the lands of a wife alyened by
her husband / where as no fine was leuyed / and also upon lands being let in
fee ferme / upon condycyon to pay therefore yearly the fourth part of the very
value thereof the statute shall run and extend as well un to lands that were
lessed before the making of the statute as after / so that the tenant has
witholde^ then by the space of two years and more that he should have paid
unto his lessour verily acordyng unto the form of his covenant. And as to
the ponyshement of waste it shall be understood in all cases (except it be of
dowers and wardshyp) and of such wastes as were made syns the publyshyng of ye
statute. And as concerning them which do alyene their dowers it shall be always
understood after the publyshynge of the statute.

Given at Gloucestre the sunday next after the feast of sayncte Peter ad
vincula ye.vi. year of ye reign of king Edward the first.
Here endyth the exposycyons upon the statute of Gloucestre
The secounde statute of west: mynster / made the.xiii. year of king Edward
the first.
WHere as of late our soueraygne lord the king in the quynzieme of sayncte
Johan Baptyste the.vi. year of his ^eygne / calling to gyther the prelates /
earls / barous / and his council at Gloucestre / and co^syderyng that many of
this realm were dysheryted (by reason that in many cases where remedy should
have been had / there was none provided by him nor his predecessors) ordained
certain statutes necessary and profitable for his people / whereby the people
of England and Irelande being subjects unto his power have obtained more
spedye justice in their oppressyons then they had before / and certain cases
wherein the law failed did remain vndetermyned / and some remained to be
inacted that were for the reformacyon of the oppressyo^s of his people / our
soueraygne lord the king in his parlyamente / after the feast of Easter /
holden the.xiii. year of his reygne at westmynster caused many oppressions of
the people / cases where the law failed / for the accomplyshment of the said
statutes of Gloucestre to be rehearsed and thereupon did provide certain acts /
as it shall appear more plainly here following.

First concerning lands that many The. I. Chapitre.
times are given upon condycyon that is / where a man gives his land to
another and his wife / and to the heirs begotten of the bodies of yt same man
and wife with such condition expressed / if that the man and his wife dye
without heirs of their bodies between them begotten / the land so given should
reuerte to ye gyuer or his heir. In case also where lands be given in fre
marriage which gift has a co^dicyon auuered though it be not expressed in the
deed / as thus. That if the same husband and wife dye without heir of their
bodies begotten / the land so give shall reuerte to the gyuer or his heir. In
case also where a man gives land to another and to the heirs of his body
issuyng / it seemed very hard and yet seems to the gyuers and their heirs /
yt their wylbeyng expressed in the gift / was not / nor yet is not observed. In
all the cases before said after issue borne and begotten between them to whom
the lands were given under such condicyon / heretofore such feffees had power
to make alyenacyon of the land so given / and to dysheryte their issue /
contrary to the minds of the gyuers / and contrary to the form expressed in
the deed. And further where (the issue faylyng) the land so given ought to
return to the gyuer or his heir by form of the gift expressed in the deed
/ though the issue if any were / by the deed and feffement of them to whom the
lands were given under such condycyon / were barred of their reuercyon which
was dyrectely repugnau^t to the form of the gift / wherefore our soueraygne
lord the king consyderyng how necessary and expedyent it should be to
provide remedy in the foresaid cases has ordained that fromhensforthe that the
will of the gyuer according to the form expressed in the deed of gift shall be
observed so that they to whom the land was given under such condycyon shall
have no power to alyene the land so given / but that it shall remain unto
their issue after their death or shall reuerte to the gyuer or his heirs (if
issue fail) so that there be no issue at all / or if any issue be and fail by
death / or heir of the body of such issue faylynge. Nor the s^cou^d husband
of such a woman shall fromhensforthe have any thing in the land so given after
the death of his wife by the law of England / nor the issue of the secounde
husband and wife shall succeed in the inherytaunce / but immedyatly after the
death of the husband and wife to whom the land was so given / it shall
return to their issue / or to the gyuer or his heir as before is said. And
forasmuch as in a new case / new remedy must be provided / this manner of
writ shall be given to him that will purchase it. Precipe A. quam just etc.
reddat. B. tale manerium cum pertinen^ quam C. dedit tali viro et tali mulieri
et heredibus de ipsis viro et muliere exeunt / vel quam. C. dedit tali viro in
liberum maritagium cum tali muliere / et quam post mortem predictor^ viri et
mulieris predicto B. filio corundem viri et mulieris descend^^e debeat per
formam donacionis predicte vt dicit / ^el quod. C. dedit tali et heredibus de
corpore suo exeunt / et quod post mortem illius talis predicto. B. filio
predicti talis descendere debeat per formam. etc. The writ whereby the gyuer
shall recover (when issue fails) is comen enough in the chauncery. And it is
to wit / that this statute touching alyenacyon of land contrary to the
fourm^ of the gift hereafter to be made shall hold place / and shall not
extend to gifts made before. And if a five beleuyed hereafter upon such lands
/ it shall be of no effect in the law. Nor such as the reuercyon belongs unto
/ though they be of full age within England / and out of prysone shall not need
to make their claim.

The.ii. Chapitre.
FOr as much as lords of fees dystraynyng their tenauntes for seruyces and
customs due unto them / are many ^ymes greuyd / because their tenauntes do
repledge the dystresby wryt or without writ. And when the lords at the
complaynte of their tenauntes do come by attachemente into the shyre* court*
or unto another court having power to hold plees of whythernam / and do
abuowe the taking good and lawful / in that the ^^naun^^s dysauowe and do
dysclayme to hold awght of him which took the dystres and aduowed it / he that
dystrayned shall be amerced / and the tenauntes shall be quyte to whom ponyshment
can not be assygned for the dysad^owynge by record of the court / or of other
courts having no record. It is provided and ordained from hensforthe that
where such lords can not obtain justice in such manner of courts against
their tenauntes / as soon as they shall be a^tached at the suit of their
^enaun^es / a writ shall be granted them to remove the matter before the
justices by whom justice may be given to such lords / and before none other and
the cause shall be put in the writ (because such a man dystrayned^^ his fee
for seruyces and customs to him due) nor this act shall not be pre^udycy all
to the law commonly used whereby ^^ is prohybytte that no ple shall be remo^ed
before justices at the suit of the defendaunt / for though it appear at the
first that the tenant is playntyf / and the lord defendant / nevertheless
having respect to that / that the lord has dystrayned and suyth for
seruyces and customs being behynd / he aperyth in deed to be rather playntyf
than defenbant / and that the justices may know upon what fresh season the
lords may aduowe the dystres good and lawful upon their tenantes. From
hensforth it is agreyd and enacted / that a dystres may be aduowed reasonable
upon the season of any auncetour or predecessor syns the time that a writ of
novel dysseson has run / and because it chances many times that the
tenant / after he had repledged his beasts / doyth sell the^ whereby return
can not be made to ye lord yt dystrayned / if it be adjudged.

It is provided that the sheryfes or bayllyfes from hensforthe shall not
receive of the playntyfes only suretyes for ye suit before they make
delyuerau^ce of the dystres / but also for the return of the beasts if
return be awarded. And if any man take sureties otherwise he shall answer
for the price of the beasts / and the lord that dystrayueth shall have his
recouerye by writ that he shall restore unto him so many beasts or catell.
And if the bayllyf be not able to restore / his lord shall restore. And for
as much as it happens sometime that af^^r the return of the beasts is
awarded unto the dystraynour / and the party so dystrayned after that the
beasts be returned doyth repledge them again / and when he seyth the
dystraynour appearyng in the court ready to answer him do make defaute whereby
return of the beasts is awarded again to the dystraynour. And so the
beasts be repledged twyse or thryse / and infynytely and the judgments in
the kings cou^^e take no effect in this c^.se / whereupon no temedye has been
yet provided. In this case such process shall be awarded yt as soon as the
return shall be awarded to the dystrayner by wryt of judgment / the sheryf
shall be commanded so make return of ye beasts unto the dystrayner in which
wryt it shall be mencyoned that the sheryf should not deliver them without writ
in which it shall be mencyoned of the judgment given by the justices that can
not be without a writ issuyng out of the rolls of the justices be fore whom
the matter was brought. Therefore when he comes unto the justices and desires
repleuyn of his beasts / he shall have a writ of judgment yt the sheryf
taking suretye for the suit and also of the beasts or catell to be returned /
or for the price of them / if return be awarded / shall deliver unto him the
beasts or catell before returned / and the distraynour shall be attached to
come at a certain day before the justices / before who^ the plee shall be brough^
in presence of the parties / and if he that repledged make defaute again / or
for another cause return of the dystres being now twyse repledged be
awarded / the dystres shall remain vnrepleuyabl^ / but if a dystres be taken
of new and for a new cause / the process abouesayde shall be observed in the
same new dystres.

The.iii. Chapter.
IN case when a man had lost by defaute the land yt he held in right of his
wife* it was very hard that the wife after the death of her husband had none
other recouerye but by a writ of right wherefore our soueraygne lord the king
has ordained that a woman after the death of her husband shall recover by a
wryt of enter (whereto she could not dysagre during his life) which shall be
pleded in form vnderwryten / if the tenant do except against the demand of
the wife that he entered by judgment. And it be found that his enter was by
defaute * whereto the tenant might be bound to answer if it were demanded of
him * then he shall be compelled to make further answer and to show his rygh^
according to the form of the writ that he purchased before against the
husband and the wife. And if he can be ryfye that he has or had right in the
land demanded / the woman shall gain nothing by her writ. And if he can
not show the woman shall recover the land being in demand (this being
always observed) that if the husband absented himself / and would not defend
his wyfes right / or otherwise i^ his life would not answer / if the wife did
com in before judgment ready to answer the demaundant and to defend her
right / the wife shall be admytted. Likewise if tenant in dower / tenant by the
law of the land / or otherwise for term of life / or by gift wheruppon a
reuercyon is reserved / do make defaute / or will surrendre their estate the
heirs / or they to whom the reuercyon belongs shall be admytted to their
answer if they com in before judgment. And if upon such defaute or surrendre
judgment hap to be given then the heirs or they to who^ the reuercyon
belongs after the death of such tenauntes shall recover by a writ of enter
/ in which writ of enter like process shall be observed / as is aforesaid in
case where the husband lesyth his wives land by defaute. And so in the cases
aforesaid two accyons do concure one between the demaundant and tenant and an
other between the tenant showing his right and the demaundant.

The.iiii. Chapter.
IN case when a man being impleded for land gives up the land demanded
unto his aduersarye by collusyon after the death of the husband the justices
shall awarde the wife her dower if she demand it by a writ / but in case
when a man ^^syth by defaute the land being in demand / if the wife after
the death of her husband demand to be endowed / and it is found that by some
justices dower was awarded to the demaundant / notwithstanding the defaute
which her husband made before the other justices being of the contrary
opinion / and awardyng the contrary / to the entente that from hens for the
such doutes or ambyguytes shall be taken away and put in certain. It is
provided that in both cases the woman demaundyng her dower shall be herd / and
if it be alleged against her that her husband lost the land (whereof the
dower is demanded) by judgment / whereby she ought not to have dower. And if
it be inquyred by what judgment / and it be found that it was by defaute /
whereunto the tenant must answer / then it behouyth him to answer further /
and to show that he had right and has in the fore said land according to
the form of the writ that the tenant before purchased against the husband
/ and if he can prove that that the husband of such wife had no right in the
lands / nor none other but he / the tenant shall go quyte / and the wife shall
recover naught of her dower / which thing if he can not show the wife shall
recover her dower. And so in these cases and in certain other following / that
is to say / when the wife being endowed lesyth her dower by defaute / and
tenantes in fre marriage / by the law of England / or for term of life / or
in fee taylle diverse accyons do concur / for such tenantes when they
demand the land lost by defaute / and when it is come to that point that
the tenant must be compelled to show his right / in as much as the law will
not compel them to make answer with them to whom the reuercyou belongs and
therefore they are suffered to voucheor call to warrauntye according to the
tenor of the writ as if they were tenauntes / and if they have a warrantye
when the warrantour has warranted / the plee shall pass between him that is
sesyd and the warrantour according to the tenor of the writ that the tenant
purchased before and by which he recovered by defaute / and so from many
accyo^s at length they shall resort to one judgment which is this / that
either the demau^dantes shall recover their demand or that the tenantes shall
go quyte. And if the accyon of such a tenant which is compelled to show his
right be moved by a writ of right / though that the great assyse or battle
can not be joined by the words accustomed / nevertheless it may be joined by
words conuenyent and used / for when the tenant in that yt he shewyth his
right which agreyth with ye writ that he before purchased is instead of a
demaundaunt / the warrantour may well defend the right of the tenant which
comes in place of the demaundant as before is said / and to allege the season
of his auncetour / and to defend it by the body of a frema^ / or pu^ himself
in the great assyse and pray recognysaunce thereof / whyther he has more right
to the land being in demand / or else the party before named or it may be
joined otherwise by the great assyse / and so the warr^^our may defend the
right / and knowledge the season of his auncetour and put himself in the
great assyse. etc. and pray recognysaunce to be made / whyther he has more
right in the foresaid land as in that whereof he infeffed such a man / or that
such a one relessyd and quyte clay med. etc. or else the foresaid party. etc.
And where sometimes it chau^cyth that a wife / which is not endowed of the
land of an heir being within age / doythe purchase a writ of dower against
the kepar^ the kepar indowyth the wife by favor or makyth defaute / or
defendyth such manner of feigned plee by collusyon / whereby the wife is a warded
her dower in preiudyce of the heir.

It is provided also and enacted that when the heir comyth to full age / he
shall have an accyon to demand the season of his au^ccTour against the wife
like as he should have against any other deforceour / provided always that that
the wife shall have excepcyon against the demaundant to show that she had
right ^o her dower / which if she ca^shew she shall go quyte and retain her
dower and the heir shall be grievously amerced according to the dyscrecyon of the
justices / but if the heir do recover his demand. etc. likewise the wife
shall be aided if the heir or any other do implede her for her dower / or if
she lose her dower by defaute in which case the defaute shall not preiudyce
her / but that she shall recover her dower if she have right thereto / and she
shall have this writ. Precipe. A. quod just. etc. reddat tali que fuit vxor
talis tantam ^e^^am cum pertu^ in. C. quam clamat esse rationabilem do^em suam
/ vel de rationababili do^e sua* et quam predictus talis et deforceat. And to
this writ the ^^^^aunt shall have his excepcio^ for to show that she had no
right to be endowed / which if he can veryfye / he shall go quyte and if not the
wife shall recover the land / whereof she was endowed before / and where as
before time if a man had lost his land by defaute he had none other recovery
then by a wryt of right / which was not granted to any that could not claim
of mere right / neither to tenauntes for term of life / in fre marriage / nor
in taylle / in which estates a reuercyon is reserved. It is provided yt
fromhensforthe their defaute shall not be so preiudycyall / but that they may
recover their estate (if they have right) though it be not by a wryt of right.
For land in free marriage lost by defaute such a writ shall be made. Precipe
A. quam just. etc. reddat B. manerium de C. cum pertin^ / quam clamat esse ius
et maritagium suum quod predictus A. et deforceat / Likewise of land for term
of life lost by defaute / this writ shall be made. Precipe A. quod just. etc.
reddat B. maneriu^ de C. cum pertin^ quod clamat ^ener^ ad terminum vite sue et
quod predictus A. e^ deforceat. Likewise / quam clamat tenere sibi et heredibus
de corpore suo legittime procreatis / e^ quam predictus A. e^ deforceat.

The.v. Chapitre. UUhere as for aduouzons of churches there be but three
orygynall wryttes / that is to say / one writ of right / and two of
possession / yt is (darreyn presentment and Quare impedit) and hitherto it has been used in ye rea^me that when any having no title to presen^e did present to
any church and his (...) was admytted / he yt was very pa^ro^e could not
recover his aduouzon / bu^ ^^ a writ of right which should be (...) by
bataylle or by great assyse / w^^^by heirs w^^hin age either by fraud / or
else by ne^glygence of their wardeyns and heirs both of high and mean estate
either by ne^glygence / or else by fraud of tenantes by the curtezye / tenantes
in dower / or for term of life / or for years / or in see tay^^e were many
times dysheryted of their aduouzo^s / or at the least were driven to their
w^ytte of right / in which case hitherto they were without remedy. It is
provided that such presentmentes shall not be so preiudycyall to ye right
heirs or to them unto who^ such aduouzo^s shall reuerte after the death of
other persons. For as often as any having no right do present (during the time
that such heirs at in ward) or during the estate of tena^tes in dower by the
(...) / or otherwise for term of life or of years / or in ^aylle at the next
auoydaunce when the heir is come to full age / or when the auoydau^ce falls
after the death of the tenantes before named / unto the heir being of full
age / he shall have like accyon and receyte by writ of abuouson possessorye /
as the auncetour of him should have had at the last aduoydaunce happenynge in
his time before his death / or before the l^^s was made for term of life / or
in taylle / as before is said. In like manner it shall be observed in
presentemen^es made unto churches being of the inherytau^ce of wymm^^ (what
time they were in the power of their husbands) which must be aided by this
estatute i form aforesaid. Also relygyons men as byshopes / archede^cons /
persons of churches / and other spiritual men shall be aided by this estatute. If
any having no title do present unto churches belongyng to prelacyes /
spiritual dygnites / personages / or to houses of relygyo^ (what time such
houses / prelacyes / spirytuall dignytes / and personages be vacaunt) this act
shall not be so largely understood that such persons (for whose remedy
statute was made) shall have the recovery aforesaid / saying yt kepers of
heirs / tena^tes i taylle / by ye curtezye / tena^tes in dower / for term of
life or for years / or persons which fayntly have defended plces moved by
them or against them / because ye judgments given in the kings courts
should be utterly adnulled / but the judgment shall stand in his force until
it be reuersed in the court of ye king as erronyous (if error be found) or by
assyse of darreyn presentme^t / or by inqueste in Quare impedit / if it pass
by attaynte / or be adnulled by certificacion which shall be freely granted. And
fromhensforth one form of pledyng shall be kept in wryttes of darreyn
presentment and Quare impedit / so that where the defendaunt alleges
plenartye in the church of his own present acio^ / the plee shall not fall by
reason of the plenartye (so that the writ be purchased within the.vi.
months) though he can not recover his presentacyon within.vi. months. And
sometimes where peace is made between many claymyng one aduouzon and enrolled
before the justices in the roll / or by fine in this form / that one shall
present the first time / and at the next aduoydaunce another / and the.iii.
time another / and so of many. And when one has presented for his time
according to the form of their agremente and fine / and at the next
aduoyda^unce he to whom the secounde presentacyo^ belongs is dystourbed by
any that was party to the said fine or in his stead. It is provided that
fromhensforthe he that is so dystourbed shall not be driven to sue a Quare
impedit / but shall resort to the roll or fine. And if the said fine or
agreement be found in the roll / then the sheryf shall be commanded that he give
knowledge unto the distourbour that he be ready at a certain day conteynyng the
space of.xv. days or.iii. wekes (as the place happeth to be nere or far) for
to show if he can allege any thing / wherefore the party that is dystourbed
owght not to present. And if he come not / or peradventure doyth command can
nothing allege to bar the party of his presentacyon by reason of any deed
made or written syns the fine was enrolled / he shall recover his presentacio^
with damages. And where it chauncyth that after the death of his auncetour yt
presented his clerk to a church / the same aduouzon is assygned in dower to a
wife / or to tenant by ye curtezye / which do present and after the death of
such tenantes the very heir is dystourbed to present when the church is void.
It is provided that fromhensforthe it shall be in choice of ^he party dystourbed
whythe^ he w^ll s^e a Quare impedit / or a dar^^y^ pr^s^ntm^nt. Like law
shall be obs^r^^d in ad^o^^ons ^^assed for term of ly^e / or years / or in
taylle. And fromhensforth in wryttes of Quare impedit and da^r^y^ pr^s^ntment
damag^s shall be aw^^^^d if the ^^^^ co^tynue above. v^. m^n^^h^^* so that if the
bishop do presen^^ / and the v^^y pa^^une l^se his presentacyon for that time
damages shall be awa^^^d for the.ii. years value of ^^^ (...). And if the. v^

UUhen any demands land against another / and the party that is impleded
vouchyth to warrauntye / and the warrantour denies his warrauntye and the plee
hangyth long between the tenant and the warrauntour / and at length when it is
tried yt the vouche is bound to warra^tye by the law and custom of the realm
hitherto used there was none other ponyshme^t assygned for the vouche yt denied
his warra^tye / but only that he should warrantyze and be amerced for denyeng
his warrauntye / which was preiudicyall to the demandant / because he suffered
oftentimes great delays by collusyon between the tenant and the warrauntor /
wherefore our soueraygne lord the king has ordained that like as the tenant
should lose the land being in demand in case where he vouched / and the
vouche could dyscharge himself of the warrauntye. In like manner shall the
warrantour lose / in case where he denies his warrauntye / and it be found
and tried against him that he is bounden to warrantyze. And in case that an
inqueste be dependyng between the ^enant and the warrantor / and the demaundant
doyth pray a writ for to cause a ^urye to com it shall be granted him.

The.vii. Chapitre.
A writ of admesureme^t of dower shall be fromhensforth granted to a wardeyn
nor ye heir when he comes to full age shall be barred by the suit of such
wardeyn that suyth against the tenant in dower faynedly and by collusyon / but
that he may admesure the dower after as it ought to be admesured by the law
of the land. And as well in this writ as in a writ of admesurement of
pasture more spedy process shall be awarded than has been used hitherto / so
that when it is passed unto the great dystres / days shall be given within which
two shyrecourtes may be holden / at the which open proclamacion shall be made
that the defendant shall comin at the day contained in the writ to answer
unto the playntyf / at which day if he come in / the plee shall pass between
them. And if he do not come and the proclamacion be testefyed by the sheryf in
manner abouesayd / upon his defaute they shall make admesurement.

The.viii. Chapter.
UUhere as by a plee moved upon a writ of admesureme^t of pasture the pasture
was sometime admesured be fore the justices / sometime before the sheryf in the
countye. And it chanced many times that after such admesureme^t made / the
pasture to be ouercharged again by him that first did it / with ^o beasts
then he ought to keep / whereupon no remedy has been yet provided It is
provided that upon the secounde ouerchargynge the playntyfe shall have remedy
in this manner / if the admesuremente were before the justices he shall have a
writ iudycyall / that the sheryf in presence of the parties being somoned
(if they will come) shall inquere upon the secounde ouerchage / which if ^^ be
found it shall be returned before the justices under the seals of the sheryf
and of the iurrours / and the justices shall awarde the playntyf damages and
(...) put in the extreates the value of the beasts which were put in to
the pasture after such admesurement above the due noumbre / and shall d^lyuer
the extreates unto the barons of the eschequer / whereof they shall au^swer unto
the king. If such admesurement be made in the coun^ye then at the request of
the playntyf a w^^^ shall go out of the chauncery * that the sheryffe shall
inquere upon the ouerchargynge and for the bea^^es b^y^g put in ^boue the d^e
noumbre / and for the value of them he shall answer to the king at the
eschequer. And lest the sheryf might defra^de the king in th^s case ^^ is
agreyd that a^ such wryttes of secound ouerchargyng that pass out of the
cha^nc^ry shall be enrolled / and at the years end the transcryptes shall be
returned in to the eschequer under the chauncellours seal / that the
treasourer and barons may see how the sheryf shall answer of the issues of
such wryttes / likewise wryttes of reddysseson shall be enrolled and sent into
the eschequer at years end.

The.ix. Chapitre.
UUhen chyef lords do dystreyne in their fee for customs and seruyces to them
due / and one of them is mean which ought to acquyte the tenaunte where it
lies not in the mouth of the ^^nant after that he has repleuyzed the dystres
to deny the demand of the chyef lord / which a^oweth in the kings court that
the dystres is lawfully taken upon his tenant which is the mean / and many
have been sore grieved by such dystresses / ^nsomuche as the mean
(notwithstanding that he have suffycyent whereby he may be dystrayned) doyth
make long delays / before he will come into the court to answer for his
tenant unto the writ of mean / and most hard of al when the mean had
nothyng^. In case also when the tenant was ready to do his struyces and customs
unto his lord / and the chyef lord would refuse to take such seruyces and
customs by the hands of any man but only for his next tenant / and so such
tena^tes in demean lost somwhyles the profytes of their lands for a time and
somewhyles for their hole time / and hitherto no remedy has been provided in
this case. A remedy is provided in this form / that so sone as the tenant in
demean (having a mean between him and the chyef lord) is dystrayned /
incontyne^t the tenant shall purchase his writ of mean / and if the mean
having land in the same countye absent himself until the great dystres be
awarded / the playntyfe shall have such day given him in his writ of great
dystresse / within which.ii. shyrecourtes may be holden / and the sheryf
shall be commanded to dystrayne the mean by the great dystres like as it is
contained in the writ / and nevertheless the sheryf at two full shyrecourtes
shall cause to be proclaimed solempnly / that the mean do come at a day
contained in the writ for to answer his tenant at which day if he come / the
plee shall pass between them after the comen usage / and if he do not come the
mean shall lose the seruyces of his tenant / and after that / the tenant shall
not answer him in any thing / but (the menaltye being gone) he shall
answer unto the chyef lord for such seruyces and customs as the mean used
to do before that time / nor the chyef lord shall have no power to dystrayne so
long as the aforesaid tenant does offer him the seruyces and customs due. And
if the chyef lord exact more of him then the mean was wont to do / the tenant
in such case hall have against him all such excepcyons as the mean should. And
if the mean have nothing within the kings domynyon / nevertheless the tenant
shall purchase his writ of mean of the sheryf of the same shyre where he is
dystrayned. And if the sheryf return yt he has nothing whereby he may be
somoned / then shall the renant sue his writ of attachme^t. And if the sheryf
return / that he has nothing for to be attached by / he shall sue nevertheless
his writ of great dystres / and proclamacion shall be made in form abouesayd.
And if the mean have no land in the shyre where the dystres is taken / but
has land in some other shyre / then a writ oryginal shall issue to somone
the mean before the sheryf of the same shyre (where ye distres is taken) and
when it is testefyed by the sheryf that he has nothing in his shyre a writ
iudy^y all shall issue to someone the mean before the sheryf of the same shyre
/ where it was testefyed yt he had land / and suit shall be made in the same
shyre / until they have passed unto the great dystres / and proclamacyon as
above is said where the mean has laud in ye same shyre in which the dystres is
taken And nevertheless sule shall be made in the same shyre where he has
nothing* as above is said of the mean that has nothing / until the process
come to the great dystres and proclamacyon and after proclamacyon made in both
countyes / the mean shall be for judged of his fee and service. And where it
happens many times that the tenant in demean is infected to hold by less
service then the mean ought to do unto the chyef lord when after such
proclamacion the tenant has attorned unto the chyef lord / and the mean
put out / the tenant must of necessyte answer unto the chyef lord for all
such seruyces and customs as the mean was wont to do to him. And after that
the mean is come into the court and has confessed that he ought to acquyte
his tenant / or he is compelled by judgment to acquyte / if after such
confession or judgment / it is complained / that the mean doyth not acquyte
his tenant / then shall issue a writ iudycyall / that the sheryf shall
dystrayne the mean to acquyte the tenant and to be at a certain day before
the justices / for to show why he has not acquyted him before / and when
they have proceeded unto the great dystres the playntyf shall be hard / and if
the playntyfe can prove that he has not acquyted him / be shall yield damages
/ and by awarde of the court the tenant shall go quyte from the mean / and
shall atturne unto the chyef lord. And if he come not at the first dystres /
a writ shall go forth to dystrayne him again / and proclamacyon shall be made
/ and as soon as it is testefyed / they shall proceed to judgment as before is
said.

And it is to be understood / that by this ^statute tenantes are not
forebarted but they shall have warrauntye of the means and their heirs / if
they be unpleded / as they have had before / nor also the tenauntes be not
forebarred but that they may sue against their means as they used heretofore
/ if they see that their advantage may be more by the old custom then by
this estatute And it is to wit / that by this estatute no remedy is provided
to any means / but only in case when there is but one mean between the lord
that dystrayneth and the tenant. And but in such case only where the mean is
of full age / and but in such case where the tenant may astorne unto the chyef
lord without preiudyce of another then of his mean / which is spoken for women
holdyng in dower / and tenantes by the curtezye / or otherwise for term / of
life / or in fee taylle unto whom for certain causes remedy is not yet
provided / but (god willing) there shall be.

The. x Chapitre.
UUhere as in the circuyte of the justices it was proclaimed that all such as
would deliver wryttes should deliver them within a certain time after which no
writ should be received / many trustyng upon the same and taryeng until the
said time and no writ setued upon them / departed by lycense of ye justices /
after whose departure their adversaries perceiving them absente deliver their
wryttes in wax / which many times by favor and sometimes for rewards be
received of the sheryf / and they yt thought to have departed quyte lose their
lands. For the remedy of such fraud / from hensforth the king has
ordained that the justices in their cyrcuytes shall appoyute a time of.xv.
days / or of a monethe / or a time more or less (after as the countye shall
happen to be more or less) within which time it shall be openly proclaimed that
all such as will deliver their wryttes shall deliver them before the same
term. And when the time comyth the sheryf shall certefye the chapitres before
ye justices errau^t / how many wryttes he has and what / and that no writ be
received after the same time / and if it be received the process issuynge
thereupon shall be of none effect / but only that a writ abated any time
during the circuyte shall be amended. Also wryttes of dower of men that dyed
within the somons of the circuyte / assyses of darreyn presentment / Quare
impedit of churches vacant after the foresaid somons at any time before the
departure of the justices shall be received in the circuyte / also wryttes of
novel dysseson shall be received in the circuyte of justices. The king of his
special grace grants that such as have land in diverse shyres / where the
justices make their circuyte / and that have land in shyres where the justices
have no circuyte / that fear to be impleded / and are impleded of other lands
in shyres / where they have no circuyte / as before the justices at westmynster
or in ye kings benche / or before justices assygned to take assyses / or in
any shyre before sheryfes or in any court baron / may make their general
attorney to sue for them in all plees in the circuyte of justices moved or to
be moved for the^ or against them / during the circuyte / which attorneys shall
have full power in all plees being moved during the circuyte until the ple be
determined / or that his master do dyscharge him / nor they shall be excused
thereby / but that they shall be put in iuryes and assyses before the same
justices.

The.xi. Chapter.
Concerning servants / bayllyfes / chaumberlaynes / and all manner of
receyuers / it is agreyd and ordained that when the masters of such receyuours
/ do assygne audytours to take their accounte / and they be found in arrerages
upon their accou^te all things allowed and to be allowed / their bodies shall be
arrested and by awarde of the audytors of the same account shall be sent unto the
next gayle of the kings in those parties / and shall be received of the sheryf
or gaylor and imprisoned in iron and under saufe keeping / and shall remain at
their own cost / until they have satysfyed their masters clearly of the
arrerages / nevertheless if any person being so committed to prison do
conplayne that the audytours of his account have grieved him unjustly chargynge
him with receytes that he has not received or not allowyng him expenses
reasonable and do find friends that will undertake to bring him before the
barons of the eschequer / the party shall be delivered to them. And the sheryf
in whose prison he is kept shall give knowledge unto his master / that he
apere before the barons of the eschequer at a certain day with the rolls and
taylles that the accounte was given by and in the presence of the barons or the
audytors / that they shall assygne him the accounte shall be rehearsed and justice
shall be done to the parties / so that if he be found in arrerages he shall be
committed to the flete / as above is said / and if he fle and will not give
accounte / as is contained in the other statutes / he shall be dystrayned to come
before the justices to make his accou^te / if he have whereof to be dystrayned /
and when he comes into the court / audytors shall be assygned to take his
accounte before whom if he be found in arrerages / and can not pay the
arrerages forthwith / he shall be committed to the gayle in manner aforesaid. And
if he fle / and it be returned by the sheryf that he can not be found /
exigentes shall go against him from countye to countye / until he be outlawed
/ and the prisoner shall not be repleuysable / and let the sheryf or gaylour
take heed / if it be within a fraunchyze or without that he do / not suffer him
to goo at large by the common writ called Replegia^e or other wise without
assent of his master. And if he do and thereof be conuyet / he shall be
aunswerable to the party grieved of the damages done to him by such his
servant after as it may be found by the count / and shall have his
recouerye by a writ of debt. And if the gaylour have not wherewith he may
pay his superior that committed the custodye of the gayle unto him shall be
aunswerable by the same writ.

The.xii. Chapitre.
FOr as much as many through malice inte^dyng to grieve other men do procure
false appeals of murder and felony to be sued by appellours having nothing to
satisfye our soueraygne lord the king / nor the parties appealed for the
damages sustained by their false appealle. It is ordained that when any being
appealed of felonye do acquyte himself in due manner / either at the suit of the
appellour / or the kings / the justices before whom the appeall was hard and
tried shall ponyshe the appeallour by a years imprysonment and a day / and the
appeallours shall nevertheless restore to the parties appealed their damages
according to the dyscrecyon of the justices having respect to the prysonyng or
arrestyng that the party has sustained by reason of the appeall / and to the
sclaunder and infamye that they have suffered by imprysonment or otherwise and
shall nevertheless be grievously raunsomed unto the king. And if the appealours
be not able to recompense the damages it shall be inquered by whose procuring or
abbettement the appeall was comme^sed / or by whose malice if the party
appealled desire it. And if it be found by inquest that any man is abbe^^our
upon malice / at the suit of the party appealled he shall be dystrayned by a
iudycyall writ to come before the justices. And if he be lawfully conuyete of
such abbettement malycyous / he shall be ponyshed by imprysonment / and shall
pay damages / as before is said of the appeallour. And fromhensforth in
appeall of murdre there shall no essoyn lie for any cause in what so ever court
the appeall shall hap to be determined.

The.xiii. Chapitre.
FOr as much also as sheryfes faynyng many times certain persons to be
indyted before them in their turns of felonyes and other trespasses / do take
diverse persons that are not gylte / and such as are not indyted lawfully / and
imprysone them to the intent that they might extorte money from them / where as
they were not lawfully indyted by.xii. me^: It is ordained that sheryfes in
their turns and in other place where they have to inquyre of trespassers by
the kings precepte / or by office / shall cause such inquestes to be taken by
lawful men / and by.xii. at the least / which shall put their seals to
such inquisycyons / and such as shall be found culpaple by such inquestes they
shall take and imprysone as they have used before times to do / and if they do
imprysone other the^ such as has been indyted by inquest / the parties
imprisoned shall have their accyo^ by a writ of false imprysonme^t against the
sheryfes / as they should have against any other person that should impryson
them without warrau^te. And as it has been said by sheryfes / so shall it be
observed against the bayllyffes of any fraunchyse.

The.xiiii. Chap.
UUhere as for waste done in the inherytaunce of any person / by gardeyns /
tenantes in dower / tenantes by the curtezye / or otherwise for ^e^me of life /
or years / a writ of prohybicyon of waste has been used to be granted / by
which writ many were in doubt / thinking that such as had done the waste
should not need to answer / but only for waste done after the prohibycion to
them directed. Our soueraygne lord the king to put this case out of doubt
from this time forth / has ordained that of all manner of waste done to ye
hurt of any person there shall be fromhensforth no writ of prohybucio^ / but
only of somons / so that he of whom the complaynt is / shall answer for
waste done at any time / and if he come not after the somons / he shall be
attached / and after the attachement he shall be dystrayned / and if he come not
after the dystres the sheryf shall be commanded that in propre person he shall
take with him.xii. etc. and shall go to the place wasted / and shall inquere of
the waste done and shall return an inqueste / and after the inqueste
returned / they shall pass to iudgem^t / like as it is contained in the
statute made at Gloucestre.

IN case where any land descendyth to one being within age of the fathers side
that held of one lord / and of the mothers side that held of another lord /
there has been hitherto great dout for the marriage of such heir / to which of
the two lords it should belong. It is agreyd / that the same lord shall
from*he^sforth have the marriage / whose auncetour was first infeffed / not
having respect to the gendre / nor to the quantyte of the land / but only
to the more auncyente feffement by knights service.

The.xvii. Chapitre
IN the circuyte of the justices an essoyne de malo lec^^ / shall not be
fromhensforth allowed for lands in the same / shyre oneles he that caused
himself to be essoyned be syke in deed / for if the demaundant except / that
the tenant is not syke nor in such plyte / but that he may come before the
justices / his challenge shall be admytted. And if it can be so proved by
inqueste / the essoyne shall be turned to a defaute. And fro^hensforth such
essoyne shall not lie in a writ of right between two claymynge by one
dyscente.

The.xviii. Chapter.
UUhere debt is recovered or knowledged in the kings court / or damages
awarded it shall be fro^hensforthe in the eleccyo^ of him that suyth for such
debt or damages to have a writ of Fieri facias unto the sheryf for to leuye
the debt upon the lands and goods of the dettour / or that the sheryf shall
deliver to him all the lands and goods of the dettor / saving only his oxen
and beasts for his ploughe and the one half of his land until the debt be
leuyed or upon a reasnable price extended. And if he be put out of the land
/ he shall recover by a writ of novel dysseson* and after that by a writ
of redysseson if need be.

UUhere as the justices in a plee of mortdauncetour have used to admytte the
answer of the tenant / that the playntyfe is not next heir of the same
auncetor by whose death he demasideth the land / and is ready to inquyre the
same by assyse / it is agreyd that in wryttes of cosynage / ayel / and besayel
/ which be of like nature / his answer shall be admytted and inquered / and
according to the same inquerye the judgment shall pass.

The.xxi. Chapter.
UUheras in a statute made at Gloucestre it is contained / that if any less
his land to another to pay the value of the.iiii. part of the land or more /
the lessor or his heir (after that the payment has ceased by two years)
shall have an accyon to demand the land so lessed in demean. In like manner
it is agreyd that if any witholde from his lord his due and accustomed service
by ye space of two years / the lord shall have an accyo^ to demand the land
in demean by such a writ. Prec. A. quam just. etc. reddat B. tale ten^ quod
A. de eo tenuit per tale seruiciu^ / et quam ad prectt^ B. reuerti debet / eo
quam p^dictus A. in faciendu^ predictu^ seruiciu^ per bienniu^ cessauit / vt
dicit. And not only in this case / but also whereas any mencyon is made of the
said statute of Gloutestre / wryttes of enter shall be made to the heir of the
demaunda^t against the heir of the tenant / and against them to Who^ such
land is alyened.

The.xxii.
UUheras two or mo do hold wood / turfelande / or fysheponde in commune wherein
none knows his several / and some of them do waste against the minds of the
other / they shall have accyon by a writ of waste. And when it is passed unto
the judgment / the defendaunt shall choose either to take his part in a* place
certain by assygneme^t of the sheryf / and by the view and oath of his
neighbors sworn and tried for the same intent / or else he shall be content to
take nothing fromthe^sforth / but as his fellows will / and if he do choose to
take his part in a place certain / the place wasted shall be assygned for his
part after as it was before the waste made. And there is such a writ in this
case / that is to say. Cum A. et B. teneant boscum pro indiuiso B. fecit
vastum. etc.

The.xxiii. Chapitre.
Executors fromhensforth shall have a writ of accounte / and like accyon and
process in the same writ as their testatour had and should have if he had

The.xxiiii. Chapter.
IN cases whereas a writ is granted out of the chau^cery for the deed of any
man the playntyfes fromhensforthe shall not pass from the kings court without
remedy / because the land is alyened from one to another. And in the regystre
of the chauncery there is no specyal writ found in this case / as of a house
/ a wall / a mercatt / a writ is granted against him that leuyed it to the
nusaunce. And if the house / wall or such like be alyened to another / the
writ shall not be denied / but fromhensforth where in one case a writ is
granted in like case when like remedy fails / as is before the writ shall be
made. Questus est nobis A. quod B. unjust. etc. le^auit domum / murum /
mercatum / et alia que sunt ad nocumentum liberi tenementi sui. And if the
things leuyed be alyened from one to another / the wryt shall be thus. Questus
est nobis A. quod B. et C. leuauerunt. etc. In like manner is a person of a
church may recover common of pasture by a writ of nouel dysseson / likewise
fromhensforth his successor shall have a Quod permittat against the dyssesour
of his heir though a like writ were never granted out of the chauncery
before. In like manner as a writ is granted to try whyther land be the fre
alms of such a church / orels lay fee / fro^hensforth a like writ shall be
given to try whyther it be the fre alms of this church or of another church
/ if it be alyened to the possession of another church. And fromhensforth as
often as it shall fortune in the chauncery that in one case a writ is found
and in like case falling under like law and nedyng of like remedy is found
none: the clerks of the chau^cery shall agree in making the wryt / or the
plaintyfes may ad iourne it until the next parlyame^t / and let the cases be
wryte^ in which they can not agree / and let the^ refer themselves until the
nert parlyame^t / then by consent of men learned in the law a writ shall be
made / lest it might happen afterward that the kings court might fail to
minystre justice unto the suitors.

The.xxv. Chapitre.
FOr as much as there is no writ in the chauncery whereby playntyfes can have
so spedye remedy / as by a wryt of novel dysseson / our soueraygne lord the
king to the intent that tustyce may be more spedely mynistred and that delays
in plees should be abrydged grau^ teth that a writ of novel dysseson shall
hold place in mo cases then it has used heretofore / and grants that for
estoners of wood profytte to be taken in woods of gatheryng nuttys / acornys
/ and other fruits / for a corrodye for delyuere of corn and other vytaylles
and necessaryes to be received yearly in a place certain / toll / tronage /
passage / pontage / pannage / and such like to be taken in places certain /
keeping of woods / parkes / forestes / chacys / warrens / yates and other
baylewyke / and offices in fee / fromhensforth an assyse of novel dysseson
shall lie / and in all the cases before rehearsed the writ shall be (de libero
tenemento) and as before times it has lain and holden place commune of
pasture / so shall it fromhensforthe hold place for common of turfeland /
fyshyng / and such like commons which any man has appendant to his frehold /
or without freholde by special deed at the least for term of life. In case
also when any holdyng for term of years / or in ward ^lyeneth the same in fee
and by such aliena^yo^ the frehold is deuested in ye feffee / ye ^^mdye shall be
by a writ of novel dysseson / and as well the feffour as ye feffee shall be had
for dissesors so yt during ye life of any of the^ ye said wryt shall hold place.
And if remedy happen to fail by that writ / remedy shall be optayned by a
writ of enter. And all be it that above mencyon is made of some cases wherein
a wryt of novel dysseson held no place before / let no man think because of
that / but that this writ doyth not now in such cases / as it has lain
before. And though some have doubted whyther a remedy be given in this writ
in case where one commoneth in the several of another / let it be had for
certain that a good and a sure remedy is given by the said writ / let them
that be named dyssesours beware fro^hensforthe that they allege not false
excepcio^s whereby ye taking of ye assyse may be deferred saying that another
time an assyse of the same land passed between the same parties / or saying
and lyeng that a writ of mo^e high nature hangs between the same parties
for the same land / and upon these and like matters do vouche re^^s or
records to warrauntye that by the same vouching they may take away the vesture
of the land / and take the rentes and profytes to the great damage of the
playntyf. And where before no pain was lymytted against him that falsely had
alleged such untrue excepcyons but only that after such false surmyses the
assyse should pass / our soueraygne lord the king to whom such false
excepcyo^s be odyous has ordained / that if any being named dyssesour do
personally allege the excepcyon at the day to him youen / if he fail of the
warrauntye that he has vouched he shall be adiuged for a dyssesor without taking
of the assyse / and shall restore the damages before inquered / or to be
inquered after to the double / and shall nevertheless have a yetes imprysonment
for his falshod. And if the excepcyon be showed forth by a vayllyf / the taking
of the assyse shall not be delayed therefore / nor the judgment upon the
restytucyon of the lands and damages / yet if the master of such a vayllyf
that was absent come afterward before the same justices that took the assyse /
and offer to auerre by the record and rolls that another time an assyse
passed between ye same parties for the same land / or that the playntyf at
another time did withdraw his suit in a like writ / or that a plee hangs
by a wryt of more high nature / a writ of venire facias shall be made to him
upon the same record / and when he has the writ and the iutyees do perceive
that the record so showed by him before judgment should be so auaylable that
the playntyfe by force of the same should be barred of his accyon / the
justices shall awarde immedyatly a Scire facias against him that first
r^couered that he be at a certain day at the which the defendant shall
recover his season and damages / if that he ought to have paid any by the
first judgment with the damages also that he had after the first judgment
given which he shall recover to the double as before is said / and he that
first recovered shall be ponyshed by imprysomen^ after the dyscreyon of the
justices.

In like manner if the defendant against whom the assyse passed in his absence
show any deeds or dysclaymeth upon making whereof the iurye were not examyned
nor could be examyned / in so much as no mencyon was made of them in pledynge
and peradventure might be ignorant of the making of those wryttynges. The
justices upon the sight of these wrytynges shall awarde a Scire facias to the
party that recovered that he apere before them at a certain day / and shall
cause the turrours of the same assyse to come / and if they find those
wrytynges true by their verdytte / or by in^ollyng / he that obtained the
assyse contrary to his own deed shall be ponyshed by the pain aforesaid. And
the sheryfe fromhensforthe shall not take of the dyssesye an ore / but of the
byss^sour only / and if there be many dyssesours named in one writ / he
shall be nevertheless contented with one ore / nor shall not a^e any ore but of
v. ^. pry^e or the price.

IN wryttes of redysseson fromhensforth double damages shall be awarded / and the
reddyssesours shall not be re^lcuysable fromhensforth by the como^wrytte / and
like as in ye statute of Merton the same writ was pro^yded for such as were
dyssesed after they had recovered by assyse of novel dysseson / of
mortdauncetour / or other iuryes.

Further fromhensforth ye same writ shall hold place to them that have
recovered by defa^te / surrendre or otherwise without recognysaunce of astyses
or iuryes.

day gyu^an essoyne shall not be allowed at the desire of the parts / in case
where the parties do consent to come without essoyne.

The.xxviii. Chapitre.
UUhere as by the first statute of Westmynster it was provided that after the

A writ of (...) (to here and determyne) fromhensforth shall not be graun^ed

the king of his special grace has granted this / and fromhensforth a writ
(ad audiendum et terminandum appella) shall not be granted before justices
assygned / but in a specyal case and for a cause certain when the king
commands / but lest the parties appea^^d or indyted be kept long in prison
they shall have a writ of Odio et A^^a / like as it is said in magna carta
and other statutes.

The.xxx. Chapitre.
FRo^hensforth two justices sworn shall be assygned before whom and none other
assyses of novel dysseson mort dauncetour / and attayntes shall be taken / and
accompanye with them two or one of the dyseretyste knights of the shyre where
they come / and shall take the foresaid assyses and attayntes no more the^ thryes
yearly / that is to say between the quynzyeme of saynct Johan Baptyst and the
gule of August. And again between the feast of the exaltacyon of the cross and
the vtas of sa^nct Myghell. And thyrdly between the feast of the Epyphanye and
the feast of the purificacion / and in every shyre at the taking of assyses
before they shall appoint the day of their return / so that every one of the
shyre may know of their contynge / and shall aiourne the assyses from term to
term / if the taking of them be declared at any day by vowchyng to
warrauntye / by ^ssoyne / or by defaute of iurrours / and if they see that for
any cause assyses of mortdauncetour being respyted by essoyne or voucher ought
to be adiourned into the benche / it shall be lefull for them to do it / and
then they shall send the record with the original writ before the justices
of the benche. And when the matter is passed to the ^akynge of the assyse / the
justices of the benche shall remytte the matter to the frysie justices before
whom the assyse shall be taken but fromhensforth the justices of the benche
shall give in such assyses.iiii. days at the least in the year before the
said justices assygned for to spare expens^ and labor. Inquysicyons of
trespass shall be aiourned before the justices of both benches / except the
trespass be so heyghnous that it shall require great examynacyons. Inquysycyons
also of other plees pleded in both benches shall be determined before them
wherein small examynacyon is required that when the enter or season of any is
denied / or in case when one article is to be inquered. But inquysycyons of
many and great artycles that require great examynacyon shall be taken before
justices of the benche / except that both parties desire that the inquysicyon
be taken before some of the justices / when they happen to com into those
parties / that fromhensforthe it shall not be done but by two justices or one /
upon whom the parties can agree. And such inquysycyons shall not be determined
before any justices of the benche except a day and a place certain be
appointed in the shyre in presence of the parties and the day and place be
mencyoned in the writ by these words.

Precipimus tibi quod venire factas coram iusticiarus nostris apud
westmonasterium in octauis sancti Michaelis nisi talis et talis tali die et
loco ad parts illas venerint duodecim. etc.

And when such inquestes be taken they shall be returned into the benche and
there shall judgment be given and enrolled. And if any inquysicyons be taken
(other wise then after this form) they shall be of no effect / except yt
assyses of darreyn presentme^t and inquysicyons of Quare impedyt in their own
shyre before one justice of the benche and one knight at a day and place
certain assygned / whyther the defendant consent or not / and there the
judgment shall be given immedyatly All justices of the benches fro^hensforth
shall have in their cyrcuytes clerks to inrolle all plees pleded before them /
like as they have had in time passed. Also it is ordained that the justices
assygned to take assyses shall not compel the iurrors to say precysely if it
be dysseson or not / so that they do show the truth of the deed and desire
help of the justices. But if they of their own h^d will say that it is
dysseson / their verdy^ shall be admytted at their own peril. And from
hensforth the justices shall not put in assyses or iuryes any other then were
at the first somoned to the same.

The.xxxi. Chapitre.
UUhen any that is impleded before the justices doyth allege an excepcyon
prayeng that the justices will allow it / which if they will not allow / if
he that alleged the excepcyon do write it prayeng the justices to put to
their seals for a witness. And if one will not another of the company shall.
And if the king upon co^playnte made against the justices cause the record to
come before him / and the same excepcyon be not found in the roll / and the
playntyf show the excepcyon written under the seal of a justice / the justice
shall be commanded to be ready at a certain day other to confess or deny his
seal. And if his justice can not deny his seal they shall proceed to
judgment according to the same excepcyon / and after as it ought to be
admytted or avoided.

The.xxxii. Chapitre.
UUhen relygyous men or any spyrytuall persons do implede any and the party
impleded makes defaute / whereby he ought to lose the land / forasmuch as the
justices have thought hitherto yt if the party impleded make defaute by
collusyon / that when the demaundant by occasyon of the statute could not
obtain seasyn of the land by title of gift or other alyenacyon / he shall
now by reason of the defaute. And so fraud is to the statute. It is ordained
by our soueraygne lord the king in this case / that after the defaute made it
shall be inquered by the country whyther the demand a^t had right or no / and if
it be found yt the demand at had right let the judgment pass with him and so
recover season / and if he had no right the land shall go to the ne^^e lord
of the fee if he demand it within a year after the inquest taken. And if he
do not demand it within the year it shall be inquered for the nerte lord above
if he demand it within half a year after the same yer^. And so every lord
after the ne^t lord immedyate shall have the space of half a year for to
demand it successyuely until it come to the king / for whom at length by
defaute of the lords the land shall be inquered / and to challenge the
iurrors every of the chyef lords shall be admitted. And like wise for the king
they that will challenge / and after the judgment given / the land shall
remain in the kings hands / until the land be gotten by the demaundant or
some other chyef lord / and the sheryf shall be charged to answer therefore at
the eschequer.

The.xxxiii. Chapter.
FOr as much as many tenauntes set up crosses or cause to be set up in
their hands in preiudyce of their lords / so that the tenauntes should
defend themselves against their lords / by the pryuylege of templars and
hospytelers. It is ordained that such lands shall be inquered upon for the
king and the chyef lords / in like manner as is provided for lands alyened in
mortmayne.

The.xxxiiii. cha. pytre.
IT is provided that if any man fro^hensforth do rauyshe any woman married /
maid / or other where she did not consent / nether before nor after / he
shall have judgment of life and membre. And like wise where a man rauyssheth a
woman married / lady / damoysell / or other with force / although she consent
afterward / he shall have such judgment as before is said / if he be attaynte
at the kings suit / for the king shall have the suit / and for wymmen carried
awry with the goods of their husbands the king shall have the suit for the
goods taken away / and if the wife wylfully forsake her husband and go away
and co^tynue with her aduouter / she shall be barred for ever of accyon to
demand her dower that she ought to have of her husbands lands / if it be
proved against her / e^cept that her husband wyllyngly and without cohercyon
of the church reconcyle her and suffer her to dwell with him / in which case
she shall be restored to her accyon / he that caryeth away a non^e from her
house although she consent / he shall be p^nished by three years imprysonment /
and shall make conuenyent satysfaccyon to the house / from whens she was taken
/ and nevertheless shall be raunsomed at the kings will.

Concerning children malys or femalys (whose marriage belongs to another)
taken and carried away / if the taker have no right in the marriage though
afterward he restore the child unmarried or else pay the marriage / he shall
nevertheless be ponyshed by two years imprysonment / and if he do not restore /
or do marye the child after the years of consent / and be not able to satysfye
for the marriage / he shall abjure the realm / or have perpetual imprysonme^t
and thereupon the playntyf shall have such a writ. St A. fecerit ^esecurum de
clamore suo. etc. tunc pone per vadium. etc. B. quod sit cora^ iusticiariis

same country / then this clause must be added. Et diligenter inquiras vbi ille
here is sit in balliua tua Et ipsum vbicunque inuenius fuerit capias / et saluo
et secure custodias / ita quod cum habeas cora^ pre^atis iusticiatus nostris ad
prefa^um terminum ad reddendum cui predictorum A. et B. reddi debeat. And suit
shall be made against the party defendant / until he come in by dys / tresse /
if he have whereof he may be dystrayned And if he will not be iustefyed / he
shall be outlawed for his contumacye. And if the heir ^e married or carried in
another countye / then a writ shall be directed ^o th sheryt of the same
shyre in this form, Questus est nobis A. quod B. nuper talem heredem infra et
atem et in custodia sua existen^ tali loco in comitatu tali rapuit / et de
comitatu illo ad talem locum in comitatu tuo abduxit contra voluntatem ipsius

And if the heir happen to dye before he be restored or before he can be found
/ the plee shall pass between them / nevertheless until it be tried who ought
to have had it / if it had been lyuenge. And the rauyshour shall neither be
eased nor excused of the ponyshement aforesaid / by the death of the heir
whom he did witholde by wrong during his life. And if the playntyfe dye
before the plee tried if the right belong to him by reason of his propre fee /
the plee shall be resomoned at the suit of the heir of the playntyfe / and the
plee shall pass in due order / but if the right belonged to him by another
title / as by a title of gift / sale / or other like / then the ple shall be
resomoned at the suit of the executours of the playntyf / and the plee shall
pass / as before is said. In like manner if the defendaunt dye before the plee
be tried / or the heir be restored / the plee shall pass by resomons between
the playntyf his heirs or executours / and the executours of the defendaunt or
his heir / if the executours be not suffycyent to satysfye for the value of
the marriage after as it is contained in other statutes / but not as to the
pain of imprysonme^t for none ought to be ponyshed for the offense of another.
In like manner when a plee hangs between parties for the ward of land or of
an heir by the common writ that begins. Precipetall. etc. quod reddat.
etc. resomons shall be made between the heirs and executors of the playntyf* and
likewise the heirs or executours of the defendaunt / if death preuente any of
the parties before the plee be determined / and when they have passed unto the
great dystres / a day shall be given within which.iii. shyre courts may be
holden at the least in every of which open proclamacyon shall be made that the
deforceour shall come into the benche at a day contained in the writ to
answer the playntyf / at which day if he come not and the proclamacyon be so
testefyed ones / twyse / or thryse / the judgment shall pass for the playntyf
saving the right of the defendant if afterward he will claim it. In like
manner it shall be done in a writ of trespass when any complayneth himself to
be put from such wardshypes.

FOr as much as lords of courts and other that keep courts and stewardes
intending to grieve th^yr tenauntes where they have no lawful mean so to do /
procure other to move matters against them and to put in suretye and other
pledges / or to purchase wryttes / and at the suit of such playntyfes compel
them to sue at shyrecourtes / hundredes / wape^takes / and other like until
they have feigned with them at their will. It is ordained that it shall not be
so used hereafter. And if any be attached upon such false complayntes he shall
repleuye his dystres so taken / and shall cause ye matter to be brought before
justices before whom if the sheryf / bayllyf / or other lord (after that the
party dystrayned had so formed his playnte) will anowe the dystresse lawfully
taken by reason of such complayntes made unto them / and it be replied that
such playntes were moved malycyously against the party by the means or
procuryng of the sheryf / bayllyf / or lord the replycacyon shall be admytted /
and if they be co^nycte hereupon they shall be raunsomed unto the king / and
shall nevertheless restore treble damages to the parties grieved.

The.xxxvii. Chapitre.
FOr as much also as bayllyfes to whose office it belongs to take dystresses
/ intending to grieve their tenantes / and to exact money of them do send
straungyers to take dystresses to the intent that thy would grieve the tenantes
in so much as the parties so dystrayned not knowing such persons will not suffer
the dystresses to be taken. It is provided that no dystresse shall be taken but
by bayllyfes sworn and known And if they take dystresses otherwise and
thereupon be conuycte if the parties grieved will purchase their wryttes of
trespass they shall be restored unto their damages and grievously ponyshed toward
the king.

The.xxxviii. chapitre.
FOr as much also as sheryfes / hundredars / and bayllyfes of lybertes have used
to grieve their tenauntes putting in assyses and iuryes men lyeke and decrep^te
and men having contynuall or so^ayne dyscase / and men also that dwelled not
in the country at the time of the somons / and somon also a great multitude of
iurrors for to polle money from some of them / because they would be in peace /
and so the assyses and iuryes pass many times by pore men / and the rich men
abide at home by reason of their brybes. It is ordained that from hensforth in
one assyse no mo shall be somoned then.xxiiii. And old men above.lxx. years
being contynually sick / or being sick at the time of the somons / or not
dwelling in the country shall not be put in iuryes or pety assyses / nor also
shall be put in assyses and iuryes / though some ought to be taken in their own
shyre / that may dispend ^esse then.xx. ^. yearly. And if such assyses and
iuryes be taken out of the shyre * none shall pass in them but that may
dyspend.xl. ^. yearly at the lest* except such as be witnesses in deeds or
other wrytynges / whose presence is necessary / so they be able to trauayll.
And this statute shall not extend to great assyses in which it behooves many
times knyghies to pass (not resyde^t in the country) for the scarsyte of
knights / so that they have land in the shyres And if the sheryf or his
vnderbayllyfes / or bayllyfes of lybertees / offend in any point of this
statute and thereupon be conuyete / damages shall be awarded to the parties grieved
/ and shall nevertheless be amerced to the king. And justices assygned to take
assyses / when they come into the shy^e shall have power to here all playn^es
as to the artycles contained in this statute / and to mynistre justice in
form aforesaid.

The.xxxix. Chapitre.
FOr as much as justices to whose office it belongs to minystre justice to
all that sue before them / are many times dystourbed in due execucyon of their
office / for that sheryfes do not return wryttes oryginall and judicial and
for that they make false retournes unto the kings wryttes.

Our soueraygne lord the king has provided and ordained that such as do
fear the falshod of sheryfes shall deliver their wryttes orygynall and
indicyall in the open cou^tye / or again in the shyre where as the gatherynge
of the kings money is / and may take of the sheryf or vndersheryf being
present a byll wherein the names of the demaundantes and tenauntes mencyoned in
the writ / shall be contained / and the request of him that delivered the
writ / the seal of the sheryf or vndersheryf shall be put to the byll for a
testymonye / and mencyon shall be made of the day of the delyueraunce of the
writ / and if the sheryf or vndersheryf will not put his seal to the byll
the wytnes of knights and other credyble persons being in presence shall be
taken that have put their seals to such byll / and if the sheryf will not
return wryttes delivered unto him / and a complaynt thereof be made unto the
justices / a writ of judgment shall go unto the justices assygned to take
assyses / that they inquere by such as were present at the delyuerau^ce of the
writ to the sheryf / if they knew of the delyueraunce / and the inqueste
shall be returned / and if it be found by the inquest that the wryt was
delivered to him / damages shall be awarded to the playntyf or demaundant having
respect to the qualy^e and qua^tyte of the accyo^ / and to the harm that
might have come to him by reason of the delay that he sustained / and by this
mean there is remedy when the sheryf retorneth that the writ came to late /
whereby he could not execute the kings commandment. Oftentimes also plees be
delayed when the sheryf retorneth that he has commanded the bayllyfes of some
lyberte / that did nothing therein doyth name lybertes that never had the
return of wryttes / whereupon out soueraygne lord the king has ordained /
that the treasourer and barons of the eschequer shall deliver in a roll all
the lybertes of every shyre yt have return of wryttes / and if the sheryfe
answer that he has made return to a bayllyf of another lyberte then is
contained in the said roll / ye sheryf shall be forthwith ponyshed as a
dysherytour of the king and his crown / and if peradventure he return yt he
has delivered the writ to a bayllyf of some lyberte that in deed has
return the sheryf shall be commanded that he shall not spare for no lyberte
but to execute the kings precept and that he do the baylyfes to wit to whom
he returned the writ that they be ready at a day contained in the writ to
answer why they did not execute the kings precept. And if they come at the
day and acquyte themselves that no return was made to them the sheryf shall be
forth with condeyned to the lord of the same lyberte / and likewise to the
party grieved by the delay for to render damages And if the bayllyfes come not
in at the day*or do not acquyte themselves in manner aforesaid in every
iudycyall writ / so long as the plee hangs the sheryf shall be commands
to spare for no lyberte. etc. Many times also sheryses make false return upon
the point of issues. etc. retournyng sometime and lyeng that there be no
issues / sometime that there are small issues when they may return great /
and sometime do make mencyon of no issues * wherefore it is ordained and agreyd
* that if the playntyf d^mau^d^ heryng of the sheryfes return ^^ shalb(...)
him. And if he offce to au^^^^ that the sheryf might have returned g^^^^er
issues unto the king / he shall ^^^^ a wr^tte iudicyall unto the iusticies
assygned to take assyses yt they shall inquere in presence of the sheryf (if
they wylbe there) of what and how great issues the sheryf might have made
return from the day of the writ purchased unto the day contained in the
writ. And when the inqueste is returned / if he have not before answered for
the hole he shall be charged with the over plus by the extre^es of the justices
dely uered in the eschequer / and nevertheless shall be grievously amerced for the
concelement. And let the sheryf know that rentes corn in the graunge and all
mouables (except horse / ha^neys / and household stuff) be contained within the
name of (issues) And the king has commanded that sheryfes shall be ponyshed by
the justices ones or twyse if need be for such false retournes. And if they
offend the. i^. time none shall have to do therewith but ye king / they make
also many times false aunsweres retournynge that they could not execute the
kings precept for fear of some great man / wherefore let the sheryfes beware
fro^hensforth / for such manner of aunsweres sound much to the shame of the
king and of his crown. And as soon as his vnderbayllyfes do testefye that
they found such resystence / forthwith all things set a part taking with
him the power of the shyre he shall go in propre person to do execucyon / and
if he do find his vnderbayllyfes false he shall ponyshe them by imprysonment /
so that other by their example might be reformed / and if he do find them true
he shall ponyshe the resysters by imprysonment / from whens they shall not be
delivered without the kings special commandment / and if the sheryf when he
comes do find resystence he shall certefye to the court the names of the
resysters / ayders / consenters / commanders / and favors / and by a writ
indi^yall they shall be attached by the bodies to apiere in the kings court /
and if they be conuy^te upon such resystence / they shall be ponyshed at the
kings pleasure / nor any offycer of the kings shall meddle in assygnyng the
ponyshement / for the king has reserved it specially for himself / because
that resysters are had as dystourbours of his peace and realm.

by his progenitors / the land shall be taken into the kings hands / and
holden at his will / and the purchaser shall lose his recouerye as well of the
lands as of the money that he paid. And if the house were founded by an earl

chaunterye / or a light in a church / or chapel / or other alms to be
maynteyned / if the land so given be alyened / and if the land so given for a
chauntery / light / sustena^ce of pore people / or other alms to be
maynteyned or done be not alyened / but such alms is withdrawn by the space
of two years / an accyon shall lie for the donour of his heir to demand the
land so given in d^m^an / as it is ordained in the statute of Gloucestre for
lands lessed to do or to yield the.iiii. par^e of the value of the land or

Concerning the kings marshalles of fee / chau^berlaynes / porters in the
circuyte of justices and seriauntes bearing the v^erge before justices at
westmynster that have ye same office by fee and that are more by reason of
their fee then they have used to are / wherefore many do complain on them /
that have known and seen the order of the court of long time / our
soueraygne lord the king has caused it to be inquered what the said officers
of fee have used to have in times passed by an inquest and has ordained and
comau^deth that the marshal of fee which of due aryth a palfroy of earls /
barons / and other holdyng by a part of a baronye when they have made homage /
and another palfroye also when they are made knights / and of some that ought
not to give any they are a palfroye / has ordained that the said marshal of
every earl and baron holdyng by an entyer baronye shall be contented with one
palfroy or with the price of it such as he has uses to have of old / so
that if he took a palfroye or the price of one at the doing of his homage in
form aforesaid he shall take nothing when he is made knight / and if he took
nothing at ye doing of his homage / when he is made knight / he shall take. Of
abbottes and priours / holdyng an hole barony when they do homage or fealte for
their baronyes he shall take one palfroye or ye price as before is said / and
this shall also be observed against archbyshops and bishops of such as hold but
a part of a baronye whyther they be religyous or secular / he shall take
according to the portion of the baronye that they hold / of religious men yt
hold i free alms and not by a baronye nor part of a baronnye the marshall from
hensforth shall demand nothing. And our soueraygne lord the king has

IT is prohybytte from hensforth to hospytelers and templars that from
hensforth they shall implede no man before the kepars of their pryuyleges for
any matter the knowledge whereof belongs to the kings court / and if they do
first they shall yield damages to the party grieved and shall be grievously

that from hensforth at the instau^ce of hospytelers / templars / or other
persons pryuileged they grant no citacyo^s before it be expressed upon what
matter the citacyon ought to be made. And if the kepars do see that a citacyon
is required upon any matter the knowledge whereof belongs to the kings court
/ the kepars shall neither make no knowledge the citacyon / and if the kepars
do otherwise they shall yield damages to the party grieved / and nevertheless
shall be grievously ponyshed by the king. And forasmuch as such persons
pryuyleged depute relygyous men as their kepars / subpryours / presentours /

more bold to offend the kings dignyte then their superyours which can not be

UUheras in a statute made at Merton it was granted that lords of Merto^.iiii.
Chap.
waste woods and pastures might approwe the said waste woods and pastures
notwithstanding the gain saying of the tena^tes / so that the tenantes have
suffycient pasture to their hold with free enter and reentre to the same. And
for as much as no mencyo^ was made between neighbor and neighbor many lords
of waste woods and pastures have been troubled heretofore by the contradiccyon
of neighbors having suffycyent pasture. And for because foreyne tenantes
having no more right to commune in the waste woods or pastures of any lord /
then the lords own tenau^tes. It is ordained that the statute of Merton
provided between the lord and his tenantes / fromhensforth shall hold place
between lords of waste woods / and pastures / and neighbors / saving
sufficyent pasture to his servants and neighbors / so that the lords of
such waste woods / and pastures / may make approwement of the resydue / and
this shall be observed for such as claim pasture as apportenant to their land.
But if any do claim commune of pasture by special feffement or grant for a
certain noumbre of beasts / or otherwise that is due by the comen law /
where as couenaunte barreth the law / he shall have such recouere as ought to
be had by form of the grant made unto him by occasyon of a mylle / wyndmyll
/ berkarye / deyerye / inlargyng of a court or curtylage / fromhensforth no
man shall be grieved by assyse of novel dysseson for commune of pasture. And
where sometime it chances yt one having right to approwe doyth leuye a dyke
or an hedge and sometime by night or at another season that they suppose not to
be espied do overthrow the hedge or dyke / and it can not be known by
verdytte of the assyse or iurye who did overthrow the hedge or dyke. And men
of the towns nere will not indyte such as be gylte thereof / the towns nere and
adioynyng shall be dystrayned to leuye the hedge or dyke at their own custe and
to yield damages. And where one having no right to commune vsurpyth common
what time the heir is within age / or what time a woman is covert or the
pasture be in the hands of tenantes in dower / by the curtesye / or otherwise
for term of life / or years / or in fee tail / and the pasture be long used
/ many hold opynion that such pastures ought to be called appurtenant unto
frehold / and that the owner ought to have accyon by a wryt^e of nouel dysseson
/ if he be deforced of such pasture / but fromhensforth this order shall be kept
that such as have entered within the time that an assyse of mortdauncetour lies
/ if they had no common before a wryt of nouel disseson shall not lie for them
/ if they be deforced.

Here begins the statute of west^ third / made the.xviii. year of Ed. the.i.
FOr as much as purchasers of lands and tenementes of the fees of great men
and other lords / have many times in times passed entered into their fees to
the preiudyce of the lords / where upon the freholders of such great men have
sold their lands to such purchasers in fee to be holden of the feffours and
not of the chyef lords of the sea / whereby the chyef lords have many times
lost their escheates / maryages / wardshyps of lands and teneme^tes being of
their fees / which thing semyth very hard and extreme unto such lords /
and moreover in this case manifest disherytaunce. Our soueraygne lord the king
in his parlyament at westmynster after Easter the.xviii. year of his raygne
that is to wit in the quynzyeme of S. Joha^ Bap. at the instaunce of the great
men of the realm has provided and ordained / that fro^hensforth it shall be
lefull to every free man to sell at his own pleasure his lands and tenementes
or part of them / so that the feffee do hold the same land or teneme^t of
the chyef lord of the fee by such seeuyces and customs as his feffour held
before.

The.ii. Chap.
ANd if he sell any part of such lands or teneme^tes to any / the feffee
shall immedyatly hold it of the chyef lord and shall be forthwith charged with
the seruyces / as much as pertayneth / or ought to pertayne to the said chyef
lord for the same parcel according to the quantyte of the land or teneme^t
so sold / And so in this case the lord shall take the same part of the service
by the hands of the feffee / whereby he ought to be attendaunt and aunswerable
to the same chyef lord according to the quantyte of the land or teneme^t
sold for the parcel of the service so due.

The.iii. Chapter.
ANd it is to be understood that by the said sales or purchases of lands or
teneme^tes or parcelles of the^ / lands nor tenementes shall in no wise come
into mortmnayne neither by pollecye / ne craft contrary to the form of the
statute made thereupon of late. And it is to w^te that this statute extends
but only to lands hold in fee simple. And that it extends only to the
time coming / and it shall begin to take effect at the feast of sayncte
Andrew apostle next coming /

youen the.xviii. year of the reygne of king Edward / son of king Henry.
Here ends the statute of westmynster third.
Here begins the statute of wynchestre made the.xiii. year of Edward the
first.
FOr as much as from day to day robboryes / murders / burning and theft be
more often used tha^ they have been heretofore / and felons can not be attaynted
by the oath of iurrours which had rather suffer straungyers to be robbed / and
so to pass without pain then to indyte the offenders / of whom great part
be folk of the same country / or at the lest if the offenders be of another
country / the receyuours be of places nere. And they do the same because the
oath is not put unto iurrours of the same country where such felonyes were
done / and to the restitutyon of damages hitherto no pain has been lymytted
for their co^c^lement and latches. Our soueraygne lord the king for to abate
the power of felons has establyshed a pain in this case / so that
fromhensforth for fear of the pain more then for fear of any oath they shall
not spare any / nor concele no felonyes. And fromhensforth cries shall be made
in all countyes / hundredes / markettes / fayres / and all other places where
great resort of people is / so that none shall excuse himself by ignorance /
that fromhensforth every country be so well kept that immedyatly upon such
robboryes and felonyes committed fresh suit be made from town to town / and
from country to country.

The.i. Chapitre.
Likewise when need requires inquestes shall be made in towns by him that is
lord of the town / and after in the hundred / and after in the fraunchyse and
in the shyre / and sometime in two / three / or four shyres in case where
felonyes be committed in the marches of shyres / so that the trespasours may be
attaynted. And if the country will not answer for the bodies of such
trespasours the pain shall be such / that is to wit / that the people dwelling
in the country shall be aunswerable for the robboryes done and also the damages /
so that the hole hundred where the robborye happenyth to be done / or the
fraunchyses being within the precynet of the same hundred shall be aunswerable
for the robboryes done. And if the robborye chance to be done in the diuysio^
of two hundredes / in such case both hundredes and also the fraunchyses
which be within the precync^es of them shall be aunswerable. And after that
the felonye or robborye is done the country shall have no longer space then
half a year within which half year it shall behoue them to agree for the
robborye or trespass / or else that they will answer for the bodies of the
offenders.

The.ii. Chapitre.
ANd for as much as ye king wylnot yt his people should be suddenly im poueryshed
by reason of this penaltye that semyth very hard to many / the king grants
that they shall not incur it ymmedyatly / but it shall be respyted until the
Easter next following / within which time the king may see how the country
will order themselves / and whyther such felonyes and robboryes do cease.
After which term let them all be assured that the foresaid penaltye shall
run generally / that is to wit that the people of the country shall be
aunswerable for felonyes and robboryes done among them.

The.iii. Chapter.
ANd for the more suretye of the country the king has commanded that in great
towns being walled the gates shall be closed from the son restyng until the
son rysynge / and that no man do lodge in the suburbs nor in any place out
of the town from.ix. of the clock until day / without his host will
answer for him / and the bayllytes of towns every weke or at the least
every.xv. day shall make inquerye of all persons being lodged in the suburbs
or places out of the towns. And if they do find any that have lodged or
received any straungyers or suspycyous persons contrary to this / they shall do
right therein. And the king comaundeth that from hensforth all towns be kept
as it has been used in times passed / that is to wit from the feast of
Ascensyon unto Myghelmas in every cite.vi. men shall keep at every gate / in
every borugh.xii. men / in every town.vi. or.iiii. acordyng to the noumbre of
the inhabitauntes of the town / and shall watch the town all night from the
son resting unto the son rysyng. And if any strau^gyers do pass by them
he shall be arrested unto morning. And if no suspicion be found they shall go
quyte / and if they find cause of suspeccyon / they shall forth with deliver
him to the sheryf / and ye sheryf may receive him without damage and shall keep
him saufely until he be acquyted in due manner / and if they will not obey the
arreste they shall leuye hue and cry upon them / and such as keep the town
shall follow with hue and cry with all the town and the towns nere / and so
front town to town / until that they be taken and delivered to the sheryf /
as before is said and for the arrestementes of such straungyers none shall be
ponysshed.

The.iiii. Chapitre.
ANd further it is commanded that high ways ledyng from one merchaunte town
to another shall be fromhensforthe enlarged where as bushes / woods / or dykes
be / so that there be ney there dyke / tree / nor bushe / whereby any trespaser
may eskape within. CC. foot of each side the way / so that this statute shall
not extend unto ashes nor unto great trees / for that it shall be understood
clearly out of this. And if by the defaute of the lord that will not avoid
the dyke / underwood / or bushes in the manner aforesaid and robboryes be done
therein / the lord shall be aunswerable for the felonye. And if murdre be done /
the lord shall be raunsomed at the kings pleasure. And if the lord be not able
to sell the vnderwoodes / the country shall aid him therein. And the king
wylleth that in his demean lands and woods within his forest and without ye
ways shall be enlarged (as before is said) And if percase a park be taken from
the high way / it is requysyte that the lord shall set his park the space
of. CC. foot from the high way as before is said / or that he make such a wall
/ dyke / or wood that the yuell doers may not pass ne return for to do
yuell.

And further it is commanded that every man have in his house harnes for to
keep the peace after the auncyen assyse / that is for to say every man
betwyxte.xv. years of age and.xl. years shall be assessyd and sworn to armor
according to the quantyte of their lands and goods / that is to wit /
from.xv. li. lands and goods.xl. marks / that is to wit an hawberke / a
breast plate of iron / aswerde a knyfe / and an horse. And from.x. li. of lands

shall be sworn to keep gysar* mes / knyues / and other less weapons. And he
that has less then.xx. marks in goods shall have swerdes / knyues / and
other less weapons / and all other that may shall have bows and arrows out
of the foreste and in the forest bows and arrows. And that vyewe of armor be
made every year two times. And in all hundredes and fraunchyses two co^stables
shall be chosen to make the vyewe of armor and the co^stables aforesaid shall
present before justices assygned such defautes as they do see in the country
about armor / and of the suits of towns and of high ways / and also shall
present all such as do lodge straungyers in vplandyshe towns / for whom they
will not answer. And the justices shall present also at every parlyamente
unto the king such defautes as they have found / and the king shall provide
remedy therein. And from hensforth let sheryfes take good head and bayllyfes
within their fraunchyses and without / be they higher or lower that have any
baylewyke or forestrye in fee or otherwise that they shall follow the cry with
the country / and after as they are bounden to keep horses and armor so to do
/ and if there be any that do not / the defautes shall be presented to the
justices assygned and after by them to the king / as before is said / and the
king shall provide remedy / and the king comaundeth and forbyddeth that
fromhensforth neither fayres nor markettes be kept in churchyardes / for the
honor of the church / youen at wynchestre the.viii. day of Octobre the.xiii.
year of king Edwardes reygne.

Here begins the statute of merchauntes made the.xiii. year of king Edward
the first.
FOr as much as merchauntes which heretofor have lent their goods to diverse
persons be now fallen in pouerte / because there is no spedy remedy provided /
whereby they may shortly recover their debt at the day of payment assessyd.
And for this myschyef many merchants are loathe to come into the realm with
their merchaundyse to the great damage of such merchaunees and of all the
realm. The king and his counsel at his parlyament holden at Acton Burnell
after ye feast of saint Myghel the.xl. year of his raygne has ordained these
establyshementes thereupon for the remedy of such merchauntes / which
ordynaunces and establyshementes the king commands that they shall be firmly
kept and observed through out his realm / whereby merchauntes may have remedy
and less trouble and busynes to recover their dettes then they have had
heretofore. But for as much as merchau^tes afterward complained un to the king
that sheryfes mysinterpreted his statutes / and sometime by malice and false
interpretacyon delayed the execucyon of the statute to the great damage of
merchauntes. The king at his parlyament holden at westmynster after Easter
the.xiii. year of his reygne caused the said statute made at Acton Burnell to
be rehearsed. And for the declaracion of certain artycles in the statute
aforesaid has ordained and establyshed / that a merchaunte for the assurance
of his debt shall cause his dettour to come before the mayer of London or
before some chyef wardcyn of the cite / or of another good town / where the
king shall appoint / and before the mayer chyef wardeyn / or other suffycyent
men chosen and sworn thereto / when the mayer or chyef wardeyne can not attend
there to / and before one of the clerks that the king shall thereto assygne
when both can not be attendant / he shall knowledge the debt and the day of
payment / and the recognysau^ce shall be enrolled by one of the clerks hands
being known / and the roll shall be double / whereof one shall remain with the
mayer or chyef wardeyne and the other with the clerks that thereto shall be
first named. And further one of the said clerks with his own hand shall write an oblygacyon where unto the seal of the dettour shall be put with the
kings seal / provided for the same intent which seal shall be of two pecys /
whereof ye greater piece shall remayn with the mayer or the chyef wardeyne / and
the other in the keeping of the foresaid clerks. And if ye dettour do not pay
the debt at the day lymyted unto him / then shall the merchau^t com before the
mayer and clerk with his obligacyon / and if it be found by the roll or
writing that the debt was knowledged and the day of payment expyred the mayer
or chyef wardeyne shall cause the body of the dettour to be taken / if he be
lay when so ever be happyth to come in their power / and shall committee him to
the prison of the town if there be any / and shall remain there at his own
costs / until he has agreyd for the det / and it is comau^ded yt the kepar
of the town prison shall reteygne him upon the delyuere of the mayer or chyef
wardeyn / and if the kepar will not receive him / he shall be aunswerable for the
debt if he have whereof / and if he have not whereof / he that committed the
prison to his keeping shall answer. And if the dettour can not be found by
the mayer or chyef wardeyne then shall they or any of the^ return into ye
chau^cery under the kings seal the recognysaunce of the debt / and the
chancellor shall dyrecte a writ unto the sheryf in whose shyre the dettour
happyth to be for to take his body / if he be lay and saufely to keep him in
prison until he has agreyd for the debt. And within a quarter of a year
after that he be taken his lands shall be delivered him so that by the profyttes
he may leuye and pay the debt. And it shall be lefull unto him during the same
quarter to sell his lands and tenementes for the dyscharge his dettes and his
sale shall be good and effectual. And if he do not agree within the quarter next
after the quarter expyred all the lands and goods of the dettour shall be
delivered unto the merchaunt by a reasonable extent / to hold them until
such time as the debt is holly leuyed. And nevertheless the body shall
remain in prison / as before is said. And the merchau^t shall find him bread
and water / and the merchaunt shall have such season in the lands and
teneme^tes delivered unto him that be may maynteyne writ of nouel dysseson /
if he be put out and reddysseson also as of freholde to hold to him and his
assygnes until the d^tte be paid. And as soon as the debt is leuyed the body
of the dettour shall be delivered with his lands / and in such wryttes as the
chancellor doyth awarde mencyon shall be made that the sheryf shall certefye
the justices of either benche how he has performed the kings commandment
at a certayned day at which day the merchaunt shall be before the justices if
agreement be not made / and if the sheryfes do not return the writ / or do
return that the writ came to late or that they have dyrected it to the
bayllyfes of some frauuchyse / the justices shall do as it is contained in the
statute of westmynster. And if ye sheryf return that the bettour can not be
found / or yt he be clerk / the merchauntes shall have wryttes to all ye
sheryfes / or he shall have the land / and that they shall deliver all the
goods and lands of the dettour by a reasonable extent / to hold unto him and
his assygnes in the form aforesaid / and at the least he shall have a wryt to
what sheryf that he will to take his body if he be lay / and to retain i^
manner before said / and the kepar of the prison ought to take heed that he must
answer for the body / or for the debt / and after that the dettours lands
be delivered to the merchau^t / the dettour may lawfully sell his land / so
that the merchaunt have no damage of the approweme^tes / and the merchauntes
shall always be allowed for their damages and all costs / labors / suits /
delays / and expenses reasonable. And if the dettour find suretyes which
knowledge themselves to be pryncypall dettours after ye day passed / the sure
ties shall be ordered in all things as is said of the pryncypal dettour / as to
the arrest of body / delyuere of lands and other things. And when the lands
of the dettours be delivered unto the merchau^te / he shall have season of all
the lands that were in the hand of the dettour the day of the recognysau^ce
made / in whose hands so ever that they com afterward either by feffement or
otherwise / and after the debt paid / the dettours lands and the issues
thereof by feffement shall return again as well to the feffee as the other
lands unto the dettours. And if the dettour or his suretyes dye / ye merchau^t
shall have none authoryte to take the body of his heir / but he shall have his
lands as before is said / if he be of age / or when that he is of full age /
until such time as he has leuyed of the lands the amounta^ce and value of

Here endyth the statute of merchauntes.
The statute of relygyous men.
WHereas of late it was provided that relygyous me^ should not enter into other
men's fees without special lycense of the chyef lords of whom such fees be
holden immedyatly. And afterward relygyous men have entered as well in to their
own fees as in the fees of other men appropryeng and byeng them / and sometime
receyuyng of the gift of other men / whereby the seruyces that are due of such
fees / and which at the beginning were provided for defense of the realm are
wrongfully withdrawn. And the chyef lords do lose their eschetes of the same
/ we therefore intendyng to provide convenient remedy in the premysses by the
advise of our prelates / ^ries / barons and other our subjects being of our
counsel / have provided made and ordained that no person relygyous or other
what so ever he be that will bye or sell any lands or teneme^tes / or under
the color of gift or less / or that will receive by reason of any other
title / what so ever it be lands or tenementes / or by any other craft or
engyn will presume to appropre to himself under pain of fortayture of the same
whereby such lands or tenementes may any wise come into mortmayne. we have
provided also that if any person relygyous or other do presume either by
craft or engyn to offend against this statute / it shall be leful to us and
other chyef lords of the fee ymmedyate to enter in the land so alyened within
a year from the time of the alyenacyon and to hold it in fee and as
inherytau^ce. And if the chyef lord ymmediate be necglygent and will not enter
within the year / then it shall be lefull to the next chyef lord immedyate of
the fee / to enter in the same land within half a year next following / and to
hold it as before is said. And so every chyef lord ymmedyate may enter in
such lands / if the next lord ymmedyate be necglygent to enter in such
lands as before is said. And if all the chyef lords of such fees being of
full age / within the.iiii. sees / and out of prison be necglygent or slack in
this behalf / we ymmedyatly after the year accomplyshed from the time that
such purchases / gifts / or appropriacyo^s hap to be made shall take such
lands and tenementes into our hand / and shall infesse other therein by
certain seruyces to be done to us for the defense of our realm / saving the
chyef lords of the fees wards / and eschetes / and other seruyces due
thereunto due and accustomed. And therefore we comaund you / that ye cause the
foresaid statute to be read before you / and fromhensforthe to be kept firmly
and observed. Witness of myself at westmynster the.xiiii. day of Nouembre
the.vii. year of our raygne.

Artycles for the clergy made the ix. year of Edward the secou^d.
Edward by the grace of God king of England. etc. Unto all to whom these our
present lettres shall come / greatyng. Understand ye that where as of late in
the times of our progenytours sometimes kings of England in diverse their
parliamentes. And likewise after that we had undertaken the governance of the
realm in our parlyame^tes many artycles co^teynyng diverse gree^es committed
against the church of England the prelates and the clergy were purposed and
further great instaunce was made that remedy might be provided therein. And of
late in our parlyament holden at Lyncolne the.ix. year of our raygne the
artycles vnderwryten / with certain aunsweres made to some of them heretofore
/ were rehearsed before our counsel / and have made certain aunsweres to be
corrected and to the resydue of the artycles vnderwrytten aunsweres have been
made by us and our counsel / of which said artycles with the aunsweres to the
same the tenors here do follow. First where lay men do purchase prohybicyons
generally upon tithes / obuencyons / oblacyons / mortuaryes / redemynge of
penance / vyolent layenge hand on clerks or bygomes / and in causes of
dyffamacyon / in which cases spiritual penance ought to be enjoined. Our
soueraygne lord the king has answered to this article / that in tithes /
oblacyons / obuencyons / mortuaryes (when they are purposed under these names)
the kings prohybicyon shall hold no place / although for the long
witholdyng of the same the money may be esteemed at a sum certain. But if a
clerk or a relygyous man do sell his tithes being in his barn or other where
to any man for money / if the money be demanded before a spiritual judge the
kings prohybicyon shall lie / for by the sale the spiritual good are made
temporal / and the rythes turn into catelles. Also if the debate do arise
upon the right of tithes having his original of the right of the patronage
and qua^tyte of the same tithes do pass the.iiii. part of the goods of the
church / the kings prohibicyon shall hold place / if the cause com before a
judge spiritual. Also if a prelate enjoin a penance pecunyarye to any man for
his offense and it be demanded / the kings prohybicyo^ shall hold place /
Nothwithstandyng if prelates enjoin a penance corporal and the party will
redeem such penaunces by money / if money be demanded before a judge spiritual
/ the kings prohybicyon shall hold no place. Moreover if any lay vyolent
hands on a clerk / the amends for the vyolence done shall be made in the
kings cour^e. And for excommunicacyon before a prelate where penance
corporal is enjoined / if the defendour will redeem his penance by gyuynge
money to the prelate or to the party grieved / it shall be required before the
prelate / and the kings prohybicyon shall not lie. In dyffamacyons also
prelates shall correct in manner above said / the kings prohybicyon
notwithstanding / first enioynynge a penance corporal which if the offendour
will redeem / the prelate may freely receive the money / though the kings
prohybicyon be showed. Also if any do arere in his ground a mylle of new. And
after the person of the same prelate demaundyth tithe for the same / the
kings prohybicyon does issue in this form. The answer. Quia de tali
molendino hactenus decime non fuerunt solute prohibemus. etc. Et sententiam
excommunicationis / si quam hac occasion promulgaueritis / re^^^e^is omnino.

In such case the kings writ or prohybicyon was never yet granted by the
kings assente / nor never shall which has decreyd that it shall not
hereafter in such cases. Also if any cause or mattyer the knowledge whereof
belongyth to a court spiritual / and be dyffynytyfly determined before a
spyrytuall judge / so that it pass into a judgment / nor was not in suspens
by reason of any appeall / and afterward upon the same thing a case is moved
before ^ temporal judge and between the same parties / and it be prouyd by
wytnes or instruments. The excepcyon shall not be admytted in a temporal
court. The answer / when any one case is debated before judges spiritual and
temporal / as above aperyth upon the case of layenge violent h^des on a
clerk. It is thought that notwithstanding the spiritual judgment / the
kings court shall dyscusse y^ same matter / as the party shall thynk most
expedye^^ for himself. Also the kings lettre dyrected unto ordinaryes that
have wrapped their clyentes in the sentence of ^xcommunicacyon / that they
should asseyle them by a certain day / or else that they do appyere / and
show wherefore they have excommunicated the^. The answer. The king decreyth
that hereafter no such lettre shall be suffered to go forth / but in case where
it is found that the kings lyberte is preiudyced by the excommunicacyon. Also
barons of the kings eschequer challengyng by their pryuylege yt they ought to
make answer to n^ma^ out of the same place extend the same pryuylege unto the
clerks abydyng there being called to ordres or unto resyde^ce / and inhybytte
the ordynary^s that in any wise or for any cause (so long as he is of the
eschequer) they shall not call them to their courts. The answer. It pleasyth
our soueraygne lord the king that such clerks as attend in his service shall be
corrected by their ordynaryes like as other / but so long as they are occupied
about his busynes they shall not be bounde^ to keep resydence in their churches.
This is put to of new by the kings counsel. The king and his auncetours syns
time out of mind have used that clerks during such time as they are in his
service shall not be compelled unto keep resydence at their benefyces. And such
things as be thought necessary for the king and the common wealth / ought not
to be called preiudicyall to the lyberte of the church. Also the kings
officers as sheryfes and other do enter spiritual fees to take distresses /
and sometime they take the persons bestes in the kings high way / where they
have nothing but their glebe land. The answer. The kings pleasure is that
from hensforth such dystresses shall neither be taken in the kings high way /
nor in the fees wherewith churches have been endowed / never thelesse he wylleth
dystresses to be taken in possessions of the church newly purchased by the
person. Also when any that fly unto the church do abjure the realm
according to the custom of the land / and lay men or their enemies do
pursue them and pluck them from the kings high way / and are hanged or heded
and whylst they be in the church are kept in the churchyard with armed men /
and sometime in the church so straytly that they can not depart from the
hallowed ground to emptye their belie / and can not be suffered to have
necessaryes for their living. Thaunswer. They that abjure the realm so long as
they be in the comen way shall be in the kings peace / nor shall be dystourbed of
any man / and when they be in the church their kepars ought not to abide in
the churchyard / except necessyte or peril of escape do require so. And so
long as they be in the church / they shall not be compelled to avoid / but
that they shall have necessaryes for their living / and may go forth to emptye
their belie. Also the kings pleasure is that thieves or appellours (when so
ever they will) may confess their offenses unto prestes / but let the
confessors beware that they infourme not such appeallours unawarely. Also it is
desired / that our soueraygne lord the king and the great men of the realm
do not charge relygyous houses and spiritual persons for corrodyes pensyons /
or soiournynge in relygyous houses and other places of the church / or with
taking up horse and carts whereby such houses are impoueryshed and god service
dymynished / and by reason of such charges / prestes / and other mynistres of
the church deputed unto divine service are oftentimes compelled to depart from
ye places above said. The answer. The kings pleasure is yt upon the
co^tentes in their peticyon fro^hensforth they shall not be unduly charged.
And if the contrary be done by great men or other / they shall have remedy
after the form of the statutes made in the time of king Edward father to the
king that now is. And like remedy shall be done for corrodyes and pensyons
eracted by compulsyon / whereof mencyo^ is made in the said statutes. Also if
any of the kings tenure be called before their ordynaryes out of the paryshe /
where they dwell / if they be excommunicate for their manyfeste contumacye /
and after.xl. days a wryt goyth out to take them / and they pretend their
priuylege that they ought not to be cyted out of the town and paryshe where
their dwelling is. And so the kings writ that went out for to take them is
denied The answer. It was never yet denyed^ nor shall be hereafter. Also it is
desired ye spiritual persons whom the king doyth present unto benefyces /
if the bishop would not admytte them either for lack of science or for other
cause reasonable / they shall incur the excommunicacion of lay persons in
the cases before said / as for a thing contrary to the decreys canonycall
attempted / but they shall sue unto a spiritual judge for remedy as right
shall require. The answer. Of the ablenes of a person presented unto a
benefice of the church the examynacyo^ belongs to a spiritual judge and so it
has been used heretofore and shall be hereafter. Also if any dygnite be vacaunt
where eleccyon is to be made / it is moved that the electours or chosers may
freely make their eleccyon without fear of any power temporal and that all
prayers and oppressyons shall in this behalf. The answer. They shall be made
free according to the form of statutes and ordynaunces. Moreover though a
clerk ought not to be judged by a temporal judge nor any thing may be done
against him that concernyth life or membre / nevertheless temporal judges
cause that clerks fleing unto the church and confessyng their offense / do
abjure the realm / and for the same cause admit they abiuracio^s although
here upon they can not be their judges / and so power is wrongfully given to
lay persons in the ponyshement of such clerks. And if such chance to return
after into the realm / the prelates and clergy desire such remedy to be
provided herein that the immunyte or pryuylege of the church and spiritual
persons may be said vnbroke^. The answer. A clerk fleyng to the church upon
^^^^nye for to obtain the pryuylege of the church / if he affirm himself to
be a clerk / he shall not be compelled to abjure the realm / but yeldyng
himself to the law of the realm shall inioye the pryuylege of the church
according to the laudable custom of the realm heretofore used. Also
notwithstanding that a confessyo^ made before him that is not lawful judge
thereof / be not suffycye^t whereon process may be awarded or sentence given /
yet some te^porall judges (though they have been instauntly desired thereto) do
not deliver to the ordynaryes acordyng to the premysses such clerks as
confess before them their most heyghnous offenses as theft / robborye / and
murdre / but admyt their accusacion which commonly they call an appeall / all be
it to this respect they be not of their court / nor can be judged or condemned
before them upon their own confession without breakyng of the churches
pryuylege.

The answer.
The pryuylege of the church being demanded in due form by the ordynarye
shall not be denied unto the appeallour as to a clerk. We desiring to provide
for the state of holy church of England and for the tranquyllyte and quyete of
the prelates and clergy aforesaid / as ferforthe as we may lawfully do to the
honor of god and emendacyon of the church / prelates / and clergy of ye same.
Ratefyeng / confermyng / and approuynge all and every of the artycles
aforesaid / with all and every of the aunswers made and contained in the same /
do grant and commau^de them to be kept firmly and observed for evermore /
wyllyng and granting for us and our heirs that the foresaid prelates and
clergy and their successors shall use / execu^e / and practyse for ever more
the iurisdiccyon of the church in the premises / after the tenor of the
aunswers aforesaid without quarrel / inquyetyng / or vexacyo^ / our heirs or
any of our officers what so ever they be.

In testimony whereof. etc. wytnes. etc.

said that shall pass out of their propre countyes / any of their bayllyfes /
except they have lands and tenementes to the yearly value of an. C. s^. at the least And the king intendyth not by this statute to restrain the last statute
of westmynster wherein mencyon is made of recognysoues to be put in iuryes and
assyses / but of such only as ought to pass in assyses / i^^yes / and
recognysaunces try able out of their propre coun^yes / so that within the
countye before justices or our soueraygne lord the king assygned to the taking
of any such inquestes / iuryes / or other recognysaunces none shall be

oblacyons / obuencyons / redemyng of penaunces mortuaryes / vyolent hands
layenge on a clerk or lay brother / and in causes of dystamacyon / in which
cases spiritual penance must be enjoined. The king answered to these
artycles that in ththes / oblacyons / obuencyons / and mortuaryes when they be
pleded / as before is said the kings prohybicyon doyth not lie. And if a
clerk or a person relygyous do sell his corn being in his barn or
otherwhere to any man for money / if the price thereof be demanded before a
spiritual judge the kings prohibycio^ doyth lie / for by the sale the
spiritual are become temporal / and so tithes pass into catelles. Also if
debate hang in a spiritual court for the right of tithes having his origynal
from the right of the patronage / and the quantyte of the same tithes do pass
the.iiii. part of the value of the benefyce a prohibycion shall lie. Also if a
prelate enjoined penance pecunyarye to any man for his sin / if the money be
demanded before prelates a prohibycion shall lie. Also if any lay vyolente
hands on a clerk or lay brother / for the peace broken amends shall be made /
before the king / and for the exco^muny cacy on before a bishop or prelate.
And if a corporal penance be enjoined which the offendour will redeem by
gyuyng money to the prelate or the party grieved a prohibycio^ shall not lie.
In causes of diffamacyon prelates may freely correct / the kings prohibycyon
notwithstanding / first enioynyng a corporal penance which if the party will
redeem / the prelate may lawfully receive the money / though a prohibycion be
showed.

The statute of dystresses of theschequer made the. ^^ year of king Ed.i.
FOr as much as the comynalte of the realm has sustained great loss and
damage by wrongful taking of dystresses / which have ^en made by sheryfes and
by other the kings vayllyfes for ye kings det / or for any other cause. It is
therefore provided and ordained that when a sheryf or any other man doyth take
the beasts of other / they to whom the beasts do belong may give them their
fedyng without disturbau^ce (so long as they be impou^ded) without gyuynge any
thing for their keeping. And that the beasts nor no another dystres taken for
the kings debt / nor for any other cause be given ne sold within xv. days
after the taking / and if any bring a taylle of a payment made in the
eschequer / the dystres shall cease. And if he bring the taylle of any sheryf
or bay life of payment made to them of the thing demanded and will find
pledges that he appear in the eschequer upon the next account to do as right
shall require / then the dystres shall cease. And the shery for bayllyf shall
cause him to be attached that ought to have acquyted him that he appear upon
the same accounte to do as right shall require / and there shall have the names
of the pledges / yet it is provided that no man of relygion / nor other shall be
dystrayned by his beasts that gain his land / nor by his shept for the
kings debt / nor for any other man / but until they can find another
dystres or catelles suffycyent / whereof they may leuye the debt / or that is
suffy cyent for the demand / except impoundynge of beasts that a man fyndeth
in his ground damage fesaunt after the use and custom of the realm. And that
such dystresses be reasonable after the value of the debt or demand and
after conuenyent estymacyon and not outrageous / how be it the king wylleth
and commands that sheryfes or their bayl lyfes that have received the kings
d^^ of the somo^s of theschequer / and have not acquyted the dettours thereof at
the next account shall be ponyshed after ye statutes made thereupon / and the
king wylleth that all dettes of somons of theschequer that the sheryf or
bayllyf confessyth receyte shall be allowed him forth with / so that whyther he
received all the det or part / it shall never come more in demand nor somons
after the sheryf has confessed the payment.

Here endyth the dystresses of the eschequer.
A dyffynicyon of conspiratours made the.xxxiii. year of king Edward the
first.
COnspiratours be they ye do co^federe or bind the^ selves by oath / covenant
or other alyaunce / that every of them shall aid and bear the other
falsely.......... and malycyously to indyte or falsely to move or maynteyne
plees / and also such as cause children within age to appeall men of felonye
whereby they are imprisoned and sore grieved / and such as reteygue men in the
country with lyuerays or fees for to maynteyne their malycyous interpryses /
and this doyth extend as well to the takers as to the gyuers. And stewardes and
bayllyfes of great lords that by their seignourye office or power do
undertake to bear or maynteygne quarrels plees or debates that concern other
parties then such as towchen the estate of their lords or themselves. This
ordinance and fynall dyffynycyo^ of co^spyratours was made by the king and his
counsel in his parley ament the.xxxiii. year of his raygne.

The statute of fynes leuyed made the.xxvii. year of king Ed. 1.
FOr as much as fynes leuyed in our court ought and do make an end of all
matters and by cause thereof are called fynes / where after wagyng of battle or
the great assyse in their cases evermore they hold the last and fynall place.
And now by a certain time passed as well in the time of king Henry of famous
memory our graundfather / as ^^ our time the parties of such fynes and their
heirs contrary to the laws of our realm of ancient time used were admytted
to adnulle and defeat such fynes / adlledgyng that before the fine leuyed and
at the leuyeng thereof and syns the demaundauntes or playntyfes or their
auncetours were always sesyd of the lands contained in the fine or of some
parcel thereof. And so fynes lawfully leuyed were many times unjustly defeted
and adnulled by turours of the country falsely and malycyously procured* we
therefore intendyng to provide a remedy in the premysses in our parlyame^t at
west mynster have ordained that such excepcyons / aunswers / or inquysicyons
of the country shall fromhensforth in no wise be admytted contrary to such
recognysaunces or fynes. And further we will that this statute shall as well
extend unto fynes heretofore leuyed as to them that shall be leuyed here after.
And let the justices see that such notes and fynes as hereafter shall be leuyed
in our court be read openly and solempnly / and that in the mean time all
plees shall cease. And this must be at two certain days in the weke
according to the discrecyon of the justices.

The.i. Cha.
WE have also ordained by thaduyse of our counsel / that from hensforth
sheryfes shall not be charged of any issues to be leuyed nor shall leuye any
before they pass out of the eschequer there to be delivered by the extreates
of the iustyes. And that in the estreates of justices every head shall be charged
for issues forfay^ed / like as of amercyme^tes / and if peradventure any sheryf
will answer for the issues of any recognysour / pledge or maynpernour by him
assygned and returned into our cour^e / which at the time of the return is
not able to pay such issues or amercymentes / the sheryf shall be charged and
shall answer therefore in our eschequer. And let ye sheryfes beware under pain
of great forfayture that from hensforth they do make taylles of all such money
as they or their officers have received by our commandment. And that they do
not return any where the names of any maynpernours or suretyes / jurors / or
any other except such suretyes / maynpernours / or other according to the
tenor of our wryttes being dyrected to the sheryfes for the same cause / be
lawfully and manyfestly impanelled thereupon. And they shall not return the
names of any free men as pledges / without that they will plainly consent and
agree to the same. And hereupo^ we have enacted yt at one time certain every
year one baron and one clerk of our said eschequer shall be sent through out
every shyre of England to inrolle the names of all such as have paid that
year dettes exacted of them by a grene were. And the same baron and clerk
shall vyewe all such taylles and inrolle them. And shall here and determyne
complayntes made against sheryfes and their clerks / and bayllyfes that have
done contrary to the premysses / and the offenders shall be grievously ponyshed.

The.ii. Chapter.
FOr as much as sheryfes and other heretofore have let out by pleuyn common
felo^s and openly defamed being taken and imprisoned for murdre and felonye and
such as be not repleuysable contrary to the form of our statute made at
westmynster of persons repleuysable and not repleuysable / whereby such
tra^sgressours not repleuisable be let out / and for to deliver them
deceytfully before ye coming to the justices erraunt or other assigned for
their delyuerau^ce / they procure by themselves and by their friends jurors of
the country / and some they threate whereby as well for fear of the sheryfes and
other yr let thym at large by such pleuyn as for fear of the thieves being so
delivered before justices assygned for gayle delyuerees such felonyes and
murdres are conceled and so being conceled remain still vnponyshed. We for
v^^^re of our realm / and for the more assured conseruacion of our peace have
provided and ordained that iustyees assigned to take assyses in all shyres
where they take assyses / as it is ordained inco^tyne^t after the assyses taken
in the shyres / shall remain both together if they be lay. And if one of the^
be a clerk / then one of the more discrete knights of the shyre being
assocyate to him that is a lay man / by our wryt^e shall deliver the gayles of
ye shyres as well within the lybertes as without of al manner of pryso^s after
the form of the gayle delyueres of those shyres before times used. And the
same justices shall inquere then ^^ sheryfes or any other have let out by a
pleuyn prisoners not repleuyable / or have offended in any other thing
contrary to the form of the foresaid statute lately made at westmynster /
and they shall refourme and ^onyshe them in all things according to the form
of the statute aforesaid.

The.iii. Chap^.
ALso where we have provided that none shall be impanelled any where out of the
shyre where he is dwelling in recognysaunces / inquestes / and iuryes / that
has less then. C. s^. of land or rent whereby as well they that have more
lands by to often apperynge as well in our eschequer as before our justices of
either benche / are much impoueryshed / we therefore consyderyng the
intolerable damage of our people / not only for the dyscharge of such jurors
/ but also for the more spedye mynistracion of justice to all parties suyng in
our court / have provided and ordained that inquestes and recognysau^ces
determynable before justices of either benche fromhensforthe shall be taken in
time of vacacyon before any of the justices before whom the plee is brought
being assocyate to one knight of the same shyre where such inquestes shall
pass / oneles it be an inqueste that requires great examinacio^. And so from
hensforth in taking such inquestes the justices shall do as to them shall seem
most expedyent for the common v(...)e of our realm / not withstandyng the
statute lately made at westmynster / upon the taking of such inquestes /
contaynyng that if any inquestes be taken contrary to the form of the said
statute they should be of none effect And therefore we command straytly
chargynge the that incontinent without further delay thou shall cause to be
read and publysshed in cytes / borughes / merchaunt towns / and other
solepmne places through out thy lyberte where thou shall think most
necessary / all the artycles about said / the which we have granted / wyllyng
them to be kept and observed stedfastely and without contradiccyon / and that
thou notefye and declare all and synguler the premysses to all our lyege people
without delay / witness. etc^.

Here endyth the statute of leuyeng fynes.
The statute of Carlyll made the xv. year of Edward the secounde.
THe king unto the justices of his bench / greatynge. Where as of late we have
ordained that all such fynes as are to be leuyed in our court be lawfully
leuyed which we will in no wise to be broken or to be adnulled of their power
/ we have sent unto you our mind in writing firmly to be observed / that is
to wit / that as well the parties demaundant or plain tyf as the tenantes or
defendantes that wylyelde or knowledge right / of lands or teneme^tes unto
other in plees of warrauntye of chartour covenant and other whereupon fynes are
to be leuyed before you / before such fynes do pass / the parties shall appear
personally so that their age / idyocye / or any other defaute being in them
may be judged and dyscerned by you / provided always that if any person agyd
or decrepyte / or impotent by casualtye be so oppressed and holden that by no
mean he is able to com before you in our court then in such case we will that
two or one of you by assent of the resydue of the benche shall vysyte the
party so dyseased and shall receive his recognysaunce upon the plee and form
of plee that he has in our court whereupon the same fine ought to be leuyed /
and if there go but one he shall take with him an abbotte / a pryour / or a
knight / a man of good fame and credence / and shall certefye you thereof by
record / so that all things incydente to the same fine being eramyned by him
or them / the same fynes / according to our former ordinance may be lawfully
leuyed / yet we will not that any of our barons of theschequer / or our
justices shall admy^ any attorneys / but only in plees and matters that pass
before them in the benches and in places where they be assygned by us. And the
same power of admyttynge attornes we prohybytte and deny to the clerks and
servants of the said barons and justices. And do ordeyne that if any
attourneys be admitted here after by any of the persons aforesaid / their
admyssyon shall be of none effect. Reserved always in the chancellor for the
time being his authoryte in admy^tyng attorneys according to whose discrecyon
they shall be admytted / and to out those justices as heretofore has been
obuerued in the admyssyon of attorneys we will also that this our ordinance
shall take effect and beginning at the vtas of the Trinite next insuyng.

Given in our parliament at Carlyll the.xv. year of our reygne.

The statute of defendyng right made the.xx. year of Ed.i.
When that any purchases a writ against the tenauntes by the curtesye / in
taylle / in dower / for term of life / or of years / and ye demaunda^t suyth
so far yt the lands be in manner recovered / whereupon another comyth in
before judgment given and says yt he has fee and right in those lands / and
prays ye court that in as much as he is com before judgment he may be
received to defend his right and to make answer unto the demaundant thereof by
force of a certain statute lately made by the king yt now is at westminster /
whereby as well such as had no right as they that had right oftentimes in the
case before mencyoned / falsely and in deceyte of the court did ^om in and pray
to be received to make answer to the intent that their admyssyon might
prolonge the demaundant from the attaynyng unto judgment and season of his
land and for to cause those demaundantes to replede of new / where by such
demaundantes are greatly deferred in the case aforesaid / for to recover their
right in the kings court by reason of such malice / as well by mystakyng of the
said statute of for any other cause just and reasonable. And this is vsed^
found daily before our justices / in consyderacyon whereof our soueraygne lord
the king for to withstand all such malice in the foresaid case / and
intendyng to provide a remedy therein in his full parlyament has ordained and
fro^hensforth commaundyth straytly to be observed / that is to wit / the
moneday next after the feast of the purificacyon of our lady the.xx. year of
his raygne that if any before judgment in the aforesaid case comes in by a
colleraterall tytle*and desires to be received / before his receyte he shall
find suffycient suretye*(as the court will awarde) to satysfy^ the demaunda^t
of the value of the issue^ of the lands so to be recovered from the day that
he is received to make answer until the time that fynall judgment be given
upon the peticyon of the demaundant. And if the demau^dant recover his demand
/ the defendour shall be grievously amerced / if he have whereof And if he have
not / he shall be imprisoned at ye kings pleasure. And if he can prove his right
to be as good as he af^^r at such time as he was received he shall med go quyte.

The statute of vouchers made the.xx. year of Edward the first.
WHere as the tenant in a plee real heretofore had vouched one to warrauntye
/ and thereupon the demau^dant will auerre that he nor none of his auncetours
(syns the time that the auncetour of the demaundant was seasyd) was in
possession of the said lands / another in demean nor in service / if the party
that is vouched be present and will warrau^*tyse the land freely unto the
tenant / such aucrreme^t of the demaundant has not ben used to be admytted /
except the party vouched had been absent / and that by reason of a certain
statute of the kings lately made amongst other statutes of westmynster first
/ wherefore our soueraygne lord the king consyderyng the fraud / deceyte / and
malice / and also his own damage and dysherytynge of his crown that in ye
said case has many times happened in his court and daily doyth / where as
some holding of the king in chyef by an hole baronye in a ple hangyng before
the justices of the benche upon their demand do vouch partycularly knaves
unknown and strau^gyers which they will brenge forth / of whom neither they
nor their auncetours had never any thing in the lands that they have
warraunted / nor in any other lands or tenementes within his realm / neither
in demean nor in service as has been testefied by diverse of the kings
subjects / so that by such cautell / fraud / and malice the same tenauntes
holdyng by an entyer baronye do defraude the king of the amercyme^t that they
should incur if the demaundant should recover against them. And likewise when
such persons have warraunted / that is to wit / every one for his portion that
he ought to warraunt / he may defend himself by the body of his servant
procured and hired by them that hold baronyes / and so upon one writ and one
demaunnde there were two or three wagers of batay^l^s / the which was a right
hard and a peryllous example for pore men in time coming that shall be
demau^dantes against great and rich men that will defend themselfes by the
malice aforesaid / and the demau^dant can not have his auerrement against such
warrauntours when they be vouched in form aforesaid because the warrauntours
be present / and will warrantyse freely / by his comen counsel has ordained /
and fromhensforth that is to say from the feast of S Hyllarye the.xx. year of
his raygne he has straytly commaudded that who so ever tenant do vouche and

The statute of york made the.xxi. year of king Edward the first.
FOr as much as much people of the realm of England and Irelande hau
heretofore many times suffered great myschyef damage and dysherytaunce by
reason that i diverse cases where the law failed no remedy was purueyd. And
also for as much as some points of the statutes heretofore made had need of
exposycyon our soueraygne lord the king desiring that right be done to his
people at his parlyament holden at york the.iii. weke after the feast of S.
Myghell / the.xiii. year of his raygne by the assent of the prelates / earls /
barons / and the comynalte of his realm there assembled has made these acts
and statutes here following / the which he wylleth to be straytly observed in
his said realm and land. First for diverse myschyefes that where tenauntes in
an assyse of novel dysseson might not make attorneys heretofore / it is agreyd
that the tenauntes in assyses of novel dysseson from hensforthe may make
attourneys / yet the king intendyth not hereby that the tenauntes and
defendauntes in assyses of novel dysseson shall plede by bayllyfes at their
own pleasure as they have done heretofore / and it is agreyd that when a deed
/ re^lesse / acquytaunce / or other writing be denied in the kings court
wherein witnesses be named / process shall be awarded for to cause such witnesses
to appear as before has been used / so that if none of them come in at the
great dystresse returned / or if it be returned that they have nothing / or
that they can not be found / yet the taking of the inqueste shall not be
deferred by the absence of such witnesses. And if the witnesses do come in at
the great dystresse / and the inquest for some cause remains untaken / the
witnesses that come in shall have like day given them as is assygned for the
taking of the inqueste / at which day if the witnesses do not appear / the
issues that were first returned* upon them shall be forfayte. And the taking of
the inquest shall not be deferred because of their absence. And for absence of
witnesses dwelling within fraunchyses where the kings writ origynall does
not lie the taking of an inqueste shall not be deferred. And where it is
contained in a statute made at westmynster the secound day of Apryll the.
xxvii. year of the reygne of the kings father that now is / that inquestes
and recognysaunces taken before the justices of each benche should be taken
before any justice of the places accompanied with some knight of ye shyre where
such inquestes hap to be taken if they have not need of great examinacion.
And that in such inquestes the justices shall do as they shall think most
expedyent for the weal of the realm / the which statuteth a bettar
declaration. It is agreyd that inquestes and iuryes that hap to be taken
hereafter in plees of land that require not great examynacyon shall be fallen in
the cuntre before a justice of the place where the plee is acco^panyed with a
substanciall man of the cuntre knight or other / so that a certain day be
given in the bench / and a certain day and place in the cuntre in presence of
the parties demaundyng the same. And also inquestes and iuries in plees of
land that require great examynacion shall be taken in the cuntre (in the manner
abouesayd) before two justices of the benche. And the justices or justice shall
have power to record nonsuytes and defautes in the cuntre at the days and
places assygned as before is said. And that they shall do in the things above
mentioned shall be reported in the benche at a day certain there to be enrolled
and thereupon judgment shall be given. And the king intendyth not that the said
inquestes and iuries should not be taken in the benche / if they come / nor
that this statute should extend unto great assyses / and also a justice of the
one place and of the other being associate with a dyscrete man of the cuntre
knight or other at ye request of the playntyf shall take inquestes upon plees
pledyd and to be pledyd that be mouyd by attachement and dystres and shall have
power to record nonsuytes / as above is said / and to take inquestes upon
defautes there made. And as to such inquestes as are to be taken upon wryttes
of Quare impedit the form contained in the statute of westmynster secounde
shall be kept / and the justices shall have power to record nonsutys and
defautes in the cuntre and to give judgment thereupon as they do in the bench
and there to report that that they have done there to be enrolled. And if it
happen the justice or justices that shall be assygned to take such inquestes in
the country do not come / or if they come into the country at the day assygned
/ yet the parties and persons of such inquestes shall keep their day in the
bench. And because it is many times co^playned in the kings court upon
retournes that bayllyfes of fraunchyses (having full power to return the
kings wryttes) have delivered to sheryfes have been afterward changed and
otherwise returned in the kings court to the damage of the parties and the
delay of right. It is agreyd that for such retournes as hereafter be delivered
to sheryfes by such bayllyfes of fraunchy^es an inden^ure shall be made
between the bayllyf of the fraunchyse by his proper name / and the sheryf by
his propre name. And if the sheryf change the return so delyueryd to him by
indenture and be thereof conuycte at the suit of the lord of the fraunchyse of
whom he received the return / if the lord have had any damage or if his
fraunchyse be dystayned / or at the suit of the lord of the party that has
sustained loss through that occasyon he shall be ponyshed by the king for his
false return and shall yield unto the lord and to the party double damages.
Also it is agreyd that fromhensforth sheryfes and other bayllyfes that receive
the kings wryttes retournable in his court shall send their own names with
the retournes / so that the court may know of whom they took such retournes
if need be. And if any sheryf or other bayllyf leave out his name in his
retournes he shall be grievously amerced to the kings use. Also for the common
profytte of the people it is agreyd that no offycer in cite or town that by
reason of his office ought to keep assyses of wynes and vytaylles in as much as
he is attendaunt to his office / shall not by wynes nor vytaylles neither in
gross / nor by retaylle. And if any do and be thereof conuyct the merchaundyse
wherefore he is conuyct shall be forfayte to the king / and the.iii. part thereof
shall be delivered to the party that suyd the offendour as the kings gift /
and in such case h^ that will sue for a thing so forfayted shall be received.
And the chancellor / treasourer / barons of the eschequer / justices of
either benche / and justices assygned to take assyses shall admytte such
playntes by wryttes and without wryttes / and shall determyne them and shall
perform all things contained in these articles in form abouesayd / and
nevertheless the king may assygne his iustyees to execute this thing in cytes
and boroughes when and where it pleases him.

ALso the king shall have escheates of the lands of Normans / to whose fee

discendyth to any that is borne ^n the parties beyond the sea / whose
^^ncetours were from the time of king Johan under thalligeaunce of the kings
of France / and not of the kings ^^ England / as late it happened by the
baronye of Monmouth after the death of Johan of Monmouth / whose heirs were of
Brytayne and other places. King Henry by the foresaid occasyon recovered many
eschetes of Normans lands out of the fees of other men / and gave them to be

daughter to the earl of Herforde wife of Maunsell the marshall / which after
the death of wyllyam Marshall of England his brother took his season of the
castle and manner of Scrogoyll / and dyed in the same castle before he had
entryd by the king and before he had done homage to him. Whereupon it was agreyd
that his wife should not be endowed / because that her husband had not his

shall hold his hands together between the hands of his lord and shall say
thus. I become your from this day forth for life / for member / and for
worldly honor / and shall owe you my faith for the lands that I hold of you

the land that I hold of you / and lawfully shall do such customs and seruyces
as my duty is to you at the terms assygned / so help me god and all his

The statute of wards and relyefes made the.xxviii. year of Edward the first.
IT is to wit that when any relyef is gyueu / thereto wardshyp belongs and
contrary wise. And such as hold by sertaunte to go with the king in his host
there ward and relyef are incyde^t And such as hold by pety sertauntye as to
bear shield or spear in ye kings host to bear or to carye there lies nether
ward / marriage / nor relyef. Also a fre sokeman shall not give ward nor relyef
but he shall double his rent after the death of his auncetour according as he
has used to pay / and shall not be unmeasurable grieved. Now some what is to be
said of the nature of having wards There be.ii. manners of wryttes to have
awardes / one is where lands be holde^ in knights service / the other is
where lands be holden in s^cage. The ward of land that is holden in knights
service belongs to the chyefe lord / and the marriage which ought to be
without disp^ragement as the great chartourly my tyth / until he comyth to the
age of.xxi. years. The ward of an heir that holds in socage / if the
inherytaunce dyscende of his mothers side then it belongyth to the next friend
of the fathers side / and contrary wise. And a writ to recover ward may be
brought in.iii. manners / one is when a man demau^dyth ward of the land and of
his heir / and that is in case when a man holds land of another by knights
service and the tenant dies / then may the chyef lord (if he be deforced)
demand the ward of his land and heir and shall have both ward and
marriage. Another manner is when a man is infeffed of a rode of land by one man
/ and by another of another rode / the secounde lord may not bring a writ
of ward to recover either the land or the heir / for the ward belongs to
the lord of whom he was first infeffed. The.iii. manner is where a man has
land in his hands by reason of a ward / and has not the heir / then he may
bring a writ to demand the heir and not the land.

Here endyth the statute of wards and relyefes made the.xxviii. year of
Edward.i.

The statute of Ioyntenauntes made the.xxxiiii. year of king Edward the first.
THe king our sovereign lord unto all to whom these. etc. greatyng. It is
well known that among diverse establysshementes of laws which we have
ordained in our own time upon the great and heyghnous myschyef that happen in
wryttes of novel dysseson ^^y^fly above other / we have devised more spedye
remedy in those wryttes / then was before. And for as much as it ^haunseth
many times in assyses of no^ell that the tenant doyth plede against the
playntyfe that he holds the lands being in demand jointly with his wife
not only named in the wryt / and sometime with a strau^gyer not named in the
writ / and shewyth forth a deed testefyeng the same / and demands
judgment of the writ. It is agreyd and ordained that if the playntyf will
offer to auerre by assyse that the day of his wryt purchased he that alleged
the excepcio^ was sole tenant / so that nether his wife nor any other had any
thing in the said lands / then the justices before whom the assyse is
arrayned shall retain the same deed saufely in their keeping until the assyse
be tried between the^ thereupon. And they shall let the party absente to
understand by our writ under their wytnessyng and also to the ioyntenant
that is present / of whom the deed makes mention / that he be present at a
certain day with the other tenant for to answer unto the part playntyf
as well upon the excepcyon alleged / as of the lands demanded and put in vyewe
/ if it seem expedyent for him / at which day if both that are named tenantes
do comin / and do iustefye the same feffement they shall answer and maynteyne
the excepcyon alleged by one of them / and further shall answer unto the
assyse as though the oryginall had been purchased agynst both of them ioyntely.
And if it be proved by assyse that the excepcyon was alleged malycyously for
to delay ye playntyfe of his right / so that they held not the same land
jointly the day of the writ purchased / then all be it the same assyse do
pass for the tena^tes and against the playntyfe / yet they that alleged the
excepcyon shall be ponyshed by one years unprysonment / whens they shall not be
delivered without a grievous ransom And let the justices be well aduysed that
fromhensforth they do not allow an excepcyo^ alleged by the bayllyfes of any
such tenauntes / and if he that alleged the excepcio^ absent himself at his
day / and the other that is named ioyntenant do apere / although he iustefye
the same deed and say that he has nothing in the foresaid lands. and^.
nevertheless the assyse shall pass against him that is absent by defaute. And
if it be found by assyse that they were not jointly seized the day of the
writ purchased / and likewise that the tenant against whom the writ was
purchased / or another named in the wryt did dyssese the playntyfe / then
having regard to them that was falsely and malycyously alleged to the hurt of
the party and to the dysseson that they made / the playntyf shall recover his
season and double damage^ and they that alleged the false excepcyon shall have
the ponyshement aforesaid. But if neither of the tenauntes do come in at the
day / then upon their defaute the assyse shall pass against them. And if it be
found that the same excepcyon was lawfully and truly alleged and that they
yt alleged it were jointly seized before the playntyf purchased his wryt
against them / the assyse shall pass^ no further / but the writ shall be abated
The same shall be observed if both or ou^ do appear if it be found by assyse
that the excepcion was truly alleged as before is said. The same order shall be
observed in assyses of mortdauncetour and wryttes of iuris vtrum that the
first day that the parties appear in court / if the tenant allege the said
excepcion against the demaundant showing a deed thereupon / and the demaundant
will offer to aucrre by the assyse or iurye that the day of his wryt purchased
he that alleged the excepcion was sole tenant / hereafter the same manner of
process shall be used in assyses of mortdauncetour and wryttes of iuris vtru^ as
before is ordained in assyses of novel dysseson. And like ponyshement shall be
awarded to the offenders. But in other wryttes whereby lands at demanded such
process shall be made at the first day that the parties appear in court if the
tenant do allege the foresaid excepcio^ of a ioynte feffeme^t / and the
dema^daunt will offer to auerre by the cuntre shall the day of the writ
purchased he that alleged the excepcyon was sole tenant / then the same manner
of process shall be observed betwyxt the parties until a iurye have passed
between the^ ther*upon / and if it be founden by the iurye that the same
excepcyon was truly alleged then the writ of the demaunda^t shall abate /
and if it be founden by the iurye that the same excepcion was falsely and
malycyously alleged to the hynderaunce of the party / then the demanda^t
shall recover his seson of the lands in demand / and the tenant shall be
ponyshed by the pain abouesayd in a writ of novel dysseson ^s to the
imprysonme^t and as to the damages according to the discrecio^ of the ius^yces.
And we will and grant that this sta^ute shall take his effect the morrow after ye
feast of S. Petre ad vincula next coming / for as much also as plees in court
spiritual and unreasonable delays many times in so much as our writ that is
called / was many times brought before the iuges of such matters when they were
begone. And thereupon our chyefe justices could not proceed lawfully nor in due
manner to awarde a writ of consultacion upon such manner of process. It is
agreyd that such a writ of indycauit shall not be granted fromhensforth to
any man / before the matter hanging in the spiritual court between the
parties be recorded / and that our chau^cellour shall be certefyed thereupon upon
the sight and inspeccyon of a lybell. In witness of which thing we have
caused these our lettres to be patent. I myself being witness at
westmynster. Given the.xxvii. day of the month of May. The.xxxiiii. year of

inquest and seasyd into the kings hands ought not to remain unto the king /
then the escheton^ shall be commanded forthwith to dyscharge his hands thereof

vnsuffycient sheryfes and hundredats have been before this time in the realm

The statute of Irelande.
HEnry by the grace of God king of England lord of Irelande / duke of Guyan
and Norma^die / earl of Angeo to his trustye and well-beloved Gerarde sone of
Mauryce justice of Irelande / greatynge. Where as certain knights of the
parties of Irelande have lately infourmed us that when any land doyth descend
unto susters within our bominy o^ of Irelande / the justices ^^raunt in those
parties are uncertain whyther the younger susters ought to hold of the eldyste
suster and do homage unto her or not. And for as much as the said knights have
made instaunce to be certefyed how it has been used heretofore within our
realm of England in like case / whereupon at their instaunce we do you to wit
that such a law and custom is in England in this case / that if any holdyng
of us in chyef hap to dye having daughters to his heirs our au^cetours and we
have had always after the death of the father / and received homage of all the
daughters and every of them in this case did hold of us in chyef. And if they
happened to be within age we have always had the ward and marriage of them if
he were tenant to another lord (the susters being within age) the lord shall
have the ward and marriage of them all / and the eldyste shall do homage only
for herself and all her susters. And when the other susters come to full age /
they shall do their service to the lords of the fee by the hands of the
eldyst suster. And the eldyst upon this occasyon may not exact of her younger
susters homage ward or any other subieccyon / for when they be al susters and
in manner as one heir to one inherytaunce / if the eldyste should have homage
of the other susters or demand ward then the inherytaunce should seem to be
divided / so that the eldyst suster should be segniores and tenant of one
inherytaunce simul et semel / that is to say heyer of her own part and
segniores to her susters / which could not stand well to gyther in this case
/ for the eldyst can demand no more then her susters / but the chyefe mease by
reason of her auncienty. Moreover if the elder suster should take homage of the

his justices at westmynster after the foresaid Easter for the king himself /
if the parties greuyd will come again before the king / he of his grace shall
give them such remedy / as before is mencyoned. Also our soueraygne lord

wherefore such solempnyte ought to be done in a fine / is because a fine is so
high a bar / of so great force and of so strong nature in him self / that
it concludes not only such as be parties and preueys thereto and their heirs
/ but all other people of the world being of full age / out of prison / of good

waste and dystruccyon made in lands and tenementes of his own inherytaunce
and as well in the times of his au^cetours as at any other time that the fee and

intends that all his demea^ lands where so ever they be / that have been of

escheate of fre chase and fre warren / and in such manner shall be saved and
kept to his use for all manner of eschetes and for all manner of things that
pleases him. And i^ right of them that have lands and tenementes disaforested
for the said purlyew and such as demand to have comen within the bounds of
forestes. The intent and will of our soueraygne lord the king is that
fromhensforth (where purlyew is) they may claim to be quyte of porture of ye
forestes / and where as the kings beasts can not have their haunte and
repair upon the foreste ground as they had so long as they were within the
forestes / that such folk shall not have common nor other easement within the
bounds of the woods nor of the lands the which remain in foreste / but if
any of them that be dysaforested by ye purlyew would rather be within the forest
/ as they were before / then to be out of the foreste / as they be now. It
pleasyth the king very well that they shall be received thereunto / so that they
may remain in their ancient estate / and shall have comen and other easement
as well as they had before. Whereupon our soueraygne lord the king wylleth and
comaundeth that his justices of ye forestes on this side Trent and beyond
Trent in like manner shall keep and hold and cause to be kept and holden

Here follows the statute of Acton Burnell made the.xiii. year of K. Ed.i.
FOrasmuch as merchauntes which hertofore have lent their goods to diverse
persons be greatly impoueryshed / because there is no spedy law provided for
them to have recovery of their dettes at the day of payment assygned. And by
reason hereof many merchauntes have withdrawn to com into this royalme with
their merchaundyses to the great damage as well of the merchu^tes as of the hole
royalme. The king himself and his counsayll has ordained and establyshed
that every merchaunt which wylbe sure of his debt / shall cause his dettour to
come before the mayer of London or of york or of Brystow / or before the mayer
and a clerk (which the king shall appoynte for the same) for to knowledge the
debt and the day of payment / and the recognysaunce shall be entryd into a roll
with the hand of the said clerk / which shall be known. Moreover the said
clerk shall make with his own hand a byll obligatorye whereunto the seal of
the dettour shall be put / with the kings seal that shall be provided for the
same purpose the which seal shall remain in ye keeping of the mayer and clerk
abouesayd. And if the dettour does not pay at the day of him lymyted / the
creditor shall come before the said mayer and clerk with his byll obligatorye.
And if it be found by the roll and by the byll that the debt was knowledged
and that the day of payment is expyred the mayer shall incontinent cause the
mouables of the dettour to be sold as far as the debt does amounte at the
preysyng of honest men / after the manner of borugh goods deuysable until the
hole sum of the debt and the money be fully paid to the creditour. And if
the mayer can find no byer / he shall cause the mouables to be delivered to the
creditour at a reasonable price / as much as does amounte to the sum of the
debt. And the kings seal shall be put unto the sale and delyueraunce of
the goods deuysable for a perpetual witness. And if the dettour have no
mouables within the iurisdiccyon of the mayer whereupon the debt may be leuyed
/ but peradventure has some otherwhere within the reyalme / then shall the
mayer return the recognysaunce made before him and the clerk aforesaid unto
the chancellor under the kings seal. And the chancellor shall dyrecte a
writ unto the sheryfe in whose baylewyke that the mouables of the dettour hap
to be / and the sheryfe shall cause him to agree with his creditor in such
form as the mayer should have done / in case that the mouables of the dettour
had been within his power. And let them that have preysed the mouable goods to
be delivered unto the creditour / take good head / that they do set a
reasonable price upon them / for if they do set an over high price for
favor borne to the dettour to the damage of the creditor / then shall the
thing so preysed be delivered unto themselfes at such price as they hauely
mytted / and shall be forth with aunswerable unto the creditour / and if the
dettour will say that the mouable goods were delivered or sold for less
then they were worth / yet shall he have small remedy thereby / for when the
mayer or the sheryf have sold the mouable goods lawfully to him that offered
most / he may account it his own folly that he did not sell his own mouable
goods himself before the day of ye suyte (when he might well enough) and so
have leuyed ye money with (his own hendes. And if the dettour have no mouables
whereupon the debt may be leuyed then shall his body be taken where it may be
founden and kept in prison until that he has made agreement / or his fre^des
for him. And if he have not where with he may sustain himself in prison / the
creditor shall find him bread and water to the end that he dye not in prison
for defaute of sustenaunce / the which costs the dettour shall recompense him
with his de^^e / before that he be let out of prison. And if the creditour be a
merchaunt straungyer he shall remain at the costs of the dettour for so long
time as he taryeth about the suyte of his det / and until the mouable goods
of the dettour be sold or delivered unto him. And if the creditour do not take
the deltour alone for the suretye of his payment by reason whereof pledges or
maynpernours be founden / then those pledges or maynpernours shall come before
the mayer and clerk abouesayd / and shall bind themselves by wrytynges and
recognysauncec^ / in like manner as the pryn cypall dettour. And in like manner
if the debt be not paid at the day lymytted / such execucyon shall be awarded
against the pledges or maynpernours as before is appointed for the dettour.
Provided nevertheless that so long as the debt may be fully taken and leuyed
of the goods mouable of the dettour in form above mencyoned the maynpernours
or pledges / shall be without damage / notwithstanding for defaute of mouable
goods of the dettour / the creditour shall have execucyon of his recognysaunce
upon the maynpernours or pledges in such manner and form as before is lympted
against the pryucypall dettour.

Artycles upon the chartours made the.xxviii. year of king Edward the first.


FOr-asmuche as the artycles of the great chartour of the lybertes of England
and of the chartour of forest / the which king Henry father to our soueraygne
lord the king granted to his people for the weal of his royalme / have not
ben heretofore observed ne kept / and all because there was no ponyshement
executed upon them which offendyd against the points of the chartours before
mencyoned. Our soueraygne raygne lord the king has again granted /
renewed / and co^fermed them / at the requests of his prelates / earls / and
barons assembled in his parlyame^t holden at westmynster the xxviii. year of
his reygne. And has ordained / enacted / and establyshed certain artycles
against al them that offend contrary to the points of the said chartours or
any part of them / or that in any wise transgress them in the form that
ensuyth.

1. First of all that fromhensforth the great chartour of the lybertes of
England granted to all the comynalte of the royalme and the chartour of
foreste in like manner granted to be observed / kept / and maynteyned in every
point / in as ample wise as ye king has granted / renewed / and co^fermed
them by his chartour. And that the chartours be delivered to every sheryfe of
England under the kings seal so be red four times in the year before the
people in the full conntie / that is to wit the next cou^tie day after the
feast of S. Myghell and the next county day after the feast of the
circumcisyon and after Easter / and after the feast of saint Johan Babtyste.
And for these two chartours to be fermely observed in every point and article
(where before no remedy was at the common law) there shall be chosen in every
shyre court by the cominaltie of the same shyre three substancyall men /
knights / or other lawful wise and well dysposed persons to be justices /
which shall be assygned by the kings lettres patentes under the great seal to
here and determyne (without any other writ but only their co^missyon) such
playnte as shall be made upon all those that commytte or offend against any
point contained in the foresaid chartours / in the shyres where they be
assygned as well within fraunchyses as without. And as well for the kings
servants out of their places as for other / and to here ye playntes from day
to day without any delay / and to determyne them without allowyng the delays
which be at the common law. And that the same knights shall have power to
ponyshe all such as shall be attaynted of any trespass done contrary to any
point of the foresaid chartours (where no remedy was before at the common law)
as before is said by imprysonment / or by fine / or by amercyment according to
the trespass. ^^ll be it the king nor none of his counsel that made this
ordinance entende that by virtue hereof any of the foresaid knights shall
hold any manner of plee by power for to admytte any suyte in such cases wherein
there has been remedy provided in times passed after the course of the comou
law by writ. Nor also that the common law should be pre^udyced nor the
chartours aforesaid in any point. And the king wylleth that if all three be
not present / or can not at all times attend to do their office in form
aforesaid the king comaundeth that two of them shall do it. And it is ordained
that the kings sheryfes and baylyfes shall be attendant to do the
commandments of the foresaid justices as ferforth as appertains unto their
offices. And besides these things granted upon the Artycles of the chartours
aforesaid. The king of his specy all grace for redress of the greuaunces that
his people has sustained by reason of his wars and for the amendment of
their estate / and to the intent that they may be the more ready to do him
service / and the more willing to assyste and aid him in time of need / has
granted certain artycles the which he supposes / shall not only be observed
of his lyege people / but also shall be as much profitable or more then any of
the artycles here tofore granted.

2. Secondarely forasmuch as there is a common greuau^ce through out the hole
realm and damage without measure for that the king and his minystres exact
great pryses as well of alyens as of denyzens where as they pass through the
royalme / and take the goods as well of clerks as of lay people / which
either pay nothing at al / orels much less then the value. It is ordained that
fromhensforth none do take any such pryses with in the royalme / but only the
kings takers and the purueyours for his householde / and that the takers and
purueyours of his house shall take nothing / but only for his household. And
touching such things as they shall take in the country of meat and drink
and such other mean things necessary for the household / they shall pay or
make agreement with them of whom the things were taken. And that all the
kings takers purueyours / or catours fro^hensforthe shall have their warrante
with them under the kings great or petye seal declarynge their auctorite and
the things whereof they have power to make pryse or purueyaunce the which
warrante they shall show to them whose goods they take before that they take
any thing. And that those takers / purueyours / or catours for the king shall
take no more then is nedeful for ye king his household / and his children. And
that they shall not take any thing for them yt be in wages / nor for any
other. And that they shall make full answer in the court or in the warderobe
for all things taken by them / without making their larges any other where /
or lyueres of such things as they have taken for the king. And if any taker
for the kings house by reason of his warraunte make any pryse or syuere
otherwise then before is mencyoned / upon co^playnte made to the steward and
to the treasourer of the house / the truth shall be inquered. And if he be
attaynted thereof / he shall forth with make agreement with the party / and
shall avoid the court for evermore / and shall remain in prison at the
kings pleasure. And if any make pryse without warrante and carye it away
against the will of the owner / he shall immedyatly be arrested by ye town
where the pryse was made and shall be had unto the next gayle / and if he be
attaynted thereupon / it shall be done to him as unto a thief / if the qua^tite of
ye goods do so require. And concerning pryses made infayres / good towns /
and in ports for the kings warderobe / the takers shall have their common
warrant under the great seal. And for the things that they shall take / it
shall be testefyed under the seal of ^he keeper of the warderobe / and the nombre
of the things taken / the quantite and the value / whereof there shall be a
d^uydende made between the ^akers and the kepars of fayres / mayers / or
^hyef^ayllyfes of towns and ports by the vyew of merchaun^es whose goods
shall be so taken / and they shall not be suffered to take any more then is
contained in their dy^ydende / which dyuydende shall be had into the warde^o^e
under the seal of the wardey^ / mayer / or chyef^ayllyf aforesaid / and there
shall remain ^^tyl the accou^te of the warde^obe unto the king / and if it be
found that any has taken other wise the^ he ought to do / upon his account he
shall be ponyshed by the kepars of the kings warderobe after his deserte / and
if any make such pryses without war^a^^e and be attaynted thereupon / he shall
inc^rr^ the same pain / as they which take pryses without warrante as before is
said. Nevertheless the king and his counsel do not intend by reason of this
estetute to dymynyshe the kings right for ancient pryses due and accustomed
as of wynes and other goods but that his right shall be saved to him hole in
all points.

3. Concerning ye authoritete of stewardes and marshalles / and of such plees
as they may hold and in what manner. It is ordained that fromhensforth they
shall not keep plee of freholde / neither of det / covenant / nor of any
contracte made between the kings people / but only of trespass done within yt
house / or within the vierge / and of such contractes and couenauntes yt one
of the house makyth with another within the house and none other where. And
they shall plede no plee of traspas / except the party were attached by them
/ before the king departed from the place where the trespass was committed /
and shall plede them spedely from day to day / so that they may be pleded and
determined before that the king depart out of the lymytes of the same vierge
where ye trespass was done. And if it so chance that they can not be determined
within the lymytes of the same vierge / then shall the same plees c^ase before
the steward / and be matters determynable at the common law. And fro^hen^forth
the steward shall not take conusance of dettes nor of other things but of
such only as concern them of the kings house / nor shall hold none other
plee by oblygacyon at the determinacio^ of the steward or the marshall. And if
they attempt any thing contrary to this ordinance / it shall be holden as
void. And forasmuch as heretofore many felonyes that have been committed within
ye vierge have been vnponished / and all because the coroners of the coun^re
have not ben authorysed to inquere of felonyes done within the vierge / but
only the coroner of ye kings house / which never co^tynueth in one place / by
reason whereof there can be no trial made in due manner / nor the felons put in
exigent nor outlawed / nor no thing presented in ye circuyte / the which has been as well to the great damage of the king / as to the dysturbaunce of his
peace. It is ordained that fromhensforthe in cases of the death of men / whereof
the coroners office is to make vyew and inquest / it shall be comau^ded to the
coroner of the country that he with the coroner of the kings house shall do as
belongyth to his office and enrolle it. And that thing that can not be
determined before the steward (where the felo^s can not be attached) or for
other like cause / shall be remytted to the common law) so that ex^gendes /
ontlawryes / and presentmentes shall be made thereupon in the ^^rcuyte by the
coroner of the ^tu^re as well as of other felonyes done out of the v^erge /
nevertheless they shall not omyt by reason hereof to make attachmentes freshe^y
upon the felonyes done.

4. Moreover no common plee shall be fro^hensforth holde^ in theschequer contrary
to the form of the great chartour.

5. And on the other party the king will that the chau^cellour and the
justices of his bench shall follow him / so that he may have at all times nere
unto him s^^e that be learned in the laws which be able d^^^y ^^ order all
such matters as shall com unto the court at all times when ^^d^ (...)quyre.

6. (...) shall no writ fro^hensforth that (...) common law go forth under
any of the p^^y seals.

7. The constable of the castle of Dover shall not fro^hensforth hold any plee
of a foreyn cou^tie / within the castle gate / except it towche the keeping of
the castle / nor the said constable shall not dystray^ the inhaby^auntes of the
five ports to plede any otherwhere nor otherwise / then they ought after ye
form of their chartours obtained of kings for their old frau^chyses
co^fermed by the great chartours. 8. The king has granted unto his people /
that they shall have eleccyon of their sheryfe in every shyre (where the
shryualte is not of fee) if they West^^. ^, Capt. 58,
list. 9. The king wylleth and comaundeth that no sheryfe nor bayllyfe shall
impanell in inquestes and iuryes over many persons / nor otherwise then it is
ordained by the estatute / and that they shall put in inqueste such as be
next neighbors / most sufficyent / and lest suspicyous. And he yt otherwise
doyth and be attaynted thereupon / shall pay unto the playntyfe his damages
double / and shall be grievously amerced unto the king.

10. In right of co^spiratours / false infourmours / and imbraceous of assyses
/ inquestes and iuryes / the king has provided remedy for the playntyfes by a
wryt out of the chauncery.

And fromhensforth the king woll that the justices of either benche assygned to
take assyses / when they come into the cuntre to do their office / shall upon
every playnte made unto them awarde inquestes thereupon without writ / and
shall do right unto the playntyfes without further delay.

11. And for because the king has heretofore ordained by estatute that none of
his mynistres shall take no ple for mayntenau^ce by which estatute other
officers were not bounde^ before this time. The king will that no offycer nor
any other (for to obtain part of ye thing in plee) shall bear any matter that
is in suyte. Nor none upon any such covenant shall give up his right to
another / and if any do / and be attaynted thereof / the taker shall forfayte
unto the king so much of his lands and goods as does amount to the value of
the part that he has purchased for such mayntenaunce. And for this atteynd^e /
who so ever will sue for the king before the justices before who^ the plee
hangs shall be admytted thereto * and the judgment shall be given by them. But it
may not be understood hereby / that any person shall be prohybytte to have
counsel of pleders or of learned men in the law for his fee / or of his next
friends.

12. Fromhensforth the king will that such dystresses as are to be taken for his
dettes shall not be made upon horses of the ploughe so long as they may find
any other upon the same pain that is ordained by the estatute. And will not
that to great dystresses be taken for his dettes / nor driven to far / and if
the dettour can find able and convenient suretye for a day within which a man
may purchase remedy ^or to agree with the demand / the dystres shall be
relessed in the mean time / and he that otherwise does shall be grievously
ponyshed.

13. And for as much as the king has granted the eleccyon of sheryfes unto
the commons of the shyre the king will that they shall choose such sheryfes /
that shall not charge them / and that they shall not put any offycer in
authoryte for rewards or brybes. And that they shall not lodge to often in one
place nor with pore persons / or men of relygion.

14. Fromhensforthe the king will that his bayllewykes and hundredes nor of
other great lords of the land be not let to ferme at two great soms / whereby
the people is ouercharged by making contribucyon to such fermes.

15. In somons and attacheme^tes in plee of land / the wryttes fro^hensforth
shall conteyne.xv. days full at the least after the common law / if it be not
an attahcme^t of assyses taken in the kings presence / or of plees before
justices i^ air during the air. 16. Such execucion shall be done of them
that make false retournes of wryttes (whereby right is deferred) as is ordained
in the secound statute of westmynster / with like pain at the kings
comaundemente. 17. And for as much as there is more increase of malefactors in
the realm then is expedient for the common wealth / and that robboryes / murdres
/ and ma^^laughters are comytted out of measure / and ye peace little observed /
by reason yt the statute which the king not long past made at wynchestre is not
observed. The king will that the same statute be sent again into every
county to be red and publyshed four times in the year / and kept in every
point as straytly as the two great chartours / upon the pains therein lymytted.
And for the obseruyng and mayntenau^ce of this statute / the knights yt be
assygned in ye shyres for to redress things ^one against the said great
chartours / shall be charged / and shall have their warrante therefore.

18. For redress of wastes and distruccio^s done by eschetours / or
subeschetours in the lands of wards / as of houses / woods / parkes /
warrens / and of all other things that fall into the kings hands. The king
will that he which has sustained damage shall have a writ of waste out of the
chauncery against the eschetour for his act and the subeschetour for his act
(if he have whereof) and if he have not / his master shall be aunswerable by like
pain concerning damages as is ordained by the statute for them that do wast in
wardshyps. 19. Fro^hensforth where the eschetour or the sheryfe sease lands
into the kings hands (where there is no cause of seyser. And after when it is
found no cause / the profytes taken in the mean time have been still retained
and not restored / when the king has his oustre ie main.

The king will that if hereafter any lands be so scasyd / and after it be out
of his hands by reason that he has no cause to cease nor to hold it / the
issues shall be fully restored to him / to whom the land shall remain / and
which has sustained the damage.

20. It is ordained that no goldesmyth of England nor none otherwhere with in
the kings dominyon shall not fromhensforth gylde nor cause to be gylded no
manner of vessel / jewel / or any other thing of gold or silver / except it
be of the very best alaye / that is to wit gold of a certain alaye / and
silver of the sterlyng alaye / or of better after the discrecyon of him to
whom the gold belongs / and that none gylde worse silver then sterlyng. And
that he suffer no manner of vessel of gold or silver to depart out of his
hands / until it be assayed by the wardeyns of the craft / and further that
it be marked with the lybardes head. And that they work no worse gold the^ of
the towch of paris. And that the wardeyns of the craft shall go from shop to
shop among the goldesmythes to assaye if their gold be of the same towche that
is spoken of before. And if they find any other then of the towche aforesaid /
the gold shall be forfayte to the king. And that none shall make rings /
crosses / nor locks. And that none shall set any stone in gold / except it be
natural. And that grauers or cutters of stones and of seals shall* give to
each their wheyght of silver (as ferforth as they can) upon their fidelite. And
the iewelles of base gold which they have in their hands / they shall utter
as fast as they can. And from hensforth if they bye any of the same work /
they shall bye it for to work upon and not to sell again. And that all the
good towns of England where any goldesmythes be dwelling shall be ordered
according to this estatute / as they of London be. And that one shall come
from every good town for all the resydue that be dwelling in the same / unto
London for to be assertayned of their towche. And if any goldsmyth be attaynted
hereafter because that he has done otherwise then before is ordained / he
shall be ponyshed by imprysonment and shall make fine at the kings pleasure. And
nothwithstandyng al these things before me^cioned or any point of the^ / both
the king and his counsel / and all they yt were present at the making of this
ordinance will and intend that the right / and prerogatyue of his crown
shall be saved to him in all things.
