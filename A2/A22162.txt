royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Examiner and Register to the Commissioners assigned and to be assigned
for the execution of the Statutes against BANKRVPTS.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, whose princely care and study is and
always has been to ease and relieve his loving Subjects in all their
necessities, and to prevent all mischiefs and inconveniences which may befall
unto them: being certified by the right honorable Francis Lord Verulam Lord
Chancellor of England, the right honorable Sir Henry Mountague Knight, Lord
chief Justice of his Majesty's Bench, Sir Anthony Benn Recorder of the City
of LONDON, and Sargeants and others learned in the Laws:

That in respect the Commissioners appointed for the execution of the Statutes
against Bankrupts have power to sell the lands, goods, chatels, debts and
estates of all such as shall become Bankrupt, and are not bound to make any
return of their Commissions, nor of any of their doings, into any of his
Majesty's Courts of Record, as all other Commissioners do, but all their
proceedings do remain in scattred papers, some with the Commissioners
themselves, some with a Clerk of their own appointment, and some with the
Creditors, in such sort as those which do buy the lands, goods, chattels,
debts, and estates of such Bankrupts, being oftentimes called in question for
them again by the Bankrupt or his friends, have no means to furnish
themselves with the Copies of the arts and proceedings of the Commissioners,
whereby they should defend their titles and interests to the same, neither are
the copies thereof, as they have been used and made, so authentike as may be
given in evidence at trials, or pleaded.

And that diverse other his Majesty's loving Subjects, who are often grieved and
prejudiced by the decrees and orders of the Commissioners, and yet cannot see
them in respect no record nor memorial certain has been kept of them.

In regard whereof, it has been by the said Lord Chancellor, Lord chief
Justice, and the rest, thought very necessary and fit that there should be an
Officer made and appointed who shall be known by the name or title of Examiner
and Register to the Commissioners for Bankrupts, and be sworn and enjoined
faithfully to register all the proceedings upon such Commissions, and keep
them together in some convenient place or Office, where any of his Majesty's
loving Subjects that shall have occassion may repair to search and take copies
thereof.

Upon which certificate made unto his Majesty as aforesaid, his Highness was
most graciously pleased to give and grant his Highness Letters Patent under
the great Seal of England, bearing date the sixth day of May in the sixteenth
year of his Highness reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland
the one and fiftieth, the said Office of Examiner and Register to the
Commissioners for Bankrupts, unto Edward Hawkins Gent. to be executed by
himself, his sufficient Deputy or Deputies, and none other whatsoever after
the date of his Highness said Letters Patent, to entermeddle with taking any
examination, setting down, writing, drawing, or engrossing of any order or
orders, decree or decrees, deed or deeds, of gift, assignement, bargain and
sale, or any other of the proceedings of, from, by, or before the
Commissioners, as by his Highness said Letters Patent it does and may more at
large appear.

Now these are therefore to give notice to all whom it may concern, that the
said Office of Examiner and Register to the Commissioners for Bankrupts is kept
by the said Edward Hawkins in Iuie Lane, over against M. Osbornes Office, near
S. Paul's Church in London.

God save the King.
