BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the calling home of all such His Majesty's Subjects as are
now employed either by Sea, or Land, in the services of the Emperor, the King
of Spain, or the Archduches.
HIS most Excellent Majesty having received certain information, that very
many of the natural borne Subjects, of, and in His Highness own Realm and
Dominions, have in these many years of peace at home, under the Reign of His
most dear Father, of ever blessed memory, deceased, travailed abroad, and
betaken themselves to the service of the Emperor, the King of Spain, and the
Archduches of the Low Countries, some by Sea, and some by Land, and in, or
under their service yet continue: And in his Royal wisdom and providence
foreseeing, that if his Majesty Himself should have occasion to employ His
own Subjects in his Service in any war, either defensive, or offensive, by
Land or by Sea, it will be most proper for such his Subjects to be recalled
home, and to be employed under their own. Sovereign, and that it should be
most improper and unnatural, that His own natural borne Subjects should upon
any occasion or any accident draw their swords one against the other, or any of
them against their own Liege Lord and King: His Majesty therefore, by the
advice of His Privy Council, does hereby straightly charge and command all his
natural borne Subjects, of what Nation, quality, or degree soever, who are now
in service or under the pay of the Emperor, the King of Spain, or the
Archduches of the Low Countries, in any place wheresoever, that within forty
days after the publishing of this Proclamation, if possibly they may, or
within as short time after as possibly they can, they and every of them,
return and retire themselves into their native Countries, and there Register
their names, with one of the Secretaries of Estate, in such of His Majesty's
Realms and Dominions respectively, whither they are returned; where they shall
be received as good and dutiful Subjects ought to be, and be employed as there
shall be occasion, according to their several qualities; and that they, nor
any of them fail herein, upon pain of His Majesty's Highness displeasure,
and to be reputed enemies to His Majesty, and to the State, and upon pain of
the uttermost penalties, and forfeitures, which by Law they may incur, for
contemning or neglecting his Majesty's Royal pleasure and command in this
behalf.

Given at the Court at Tichfeld the eleventh day of September, and in the first
year of his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
