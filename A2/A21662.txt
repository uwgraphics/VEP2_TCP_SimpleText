By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty being sundry ways enfourmed, that many marchaunts,
as well of her own subjects as strangers, seeking their own singular game and
advantage, contrary to all reason and the common wealth of her Majesty's good
and natural subjects, and directly against thauncient laws and Statutes of
this Realm, have of late gathered into their hands great quantities of Hoppes,
making such a monopoly of the same Hoppes. as the hundredth weight of Hops which
has been usually sold within these few years at xiii. s. iiii. d. or xx. s.
at the most for every hundredth, be now sold for six pounds and more. The ill
example whereof, might bring the like monopolies of other wares and
marchaundizes, to the great loss of the multitude of marchaunts vsyng the
trade of marchaundize, and to the great decay of the common wealth of this her
Majesty's Realm:

Does therefore straightly charge and command, that from and after the first
day of February next, no Merchant be he her Majesty's natural subject, or
stranger, shall put to sale any Hoppes, directly or indirectly, in gross or
by retayle, at any greater or more price then forty shillings for every
hundredth at the most, upon pain of incurring such penalties, as ben provided
by her Majesty's laws, and upon her Majesty's high displeasure and
imprisonment. Straightly chargyng and commanding all manner her Majesty's
officers and ministers, to whom it shall appertain, to fee that the premises
be effectually put in execution, and the offenders therein duly punished.

Yeuen at her Majesty's Castle of Wyndsor, the xxx. of January, the syxt year
of her highness reign.
God save the Queen.
