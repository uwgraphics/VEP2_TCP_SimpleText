SIR, Plymouth, June the 4th. 1693.
YEsterday came into this Sound a Dutch Privateer, called the Hannibal of
Middleborough, Capt. Kerman, Commander, carrying Thirty Guns; she brought in
with her two French Prizes; one called the Two Brothers, of 22 Guns, 350 Tuns,
and 35 Men, who came from the Island of Martinego; the other the Hope, of 20
Guns, and 250 Tuns, who came in from Gardialoope. The Captain of the Two
Brothers give an Account, That the English Fleet, under the Command of Sir
Francis Wheeler, consisting of 60 Sail, with the Forces on Board, came before
the Island of Martinego; on the 11th. of April, New-Stile; that on the 14th.
they all Landed at St. Lucia-side: They found little or no Opposition at their
Landing, but immediately fell to Plundering the Island; that the French
Governor had Notice of their coming Three Days before their Arrival, upon
which he had ordered all the old Men, with the Women and Children, immediately
to repair to the Mountains; that there lay under the Castle of Martinego Two
French Frigates, ready to take in all Persons that are willing to go on Board.

The Merchants on Board the Hope Prize declare, That when they left
Guardialoope, the People were so dispirited there, upon the News they had of
the Arrival of the English Forces at Martinego; that he was sure they would
Surrender the Place on the first Approach of the English, the chief Planters
having already left the Place, they having 60 of the Inhabitants on Board them,
who are all here; that they verily believed, that not only the Town or Island,
but likewise the Castle were in the Hands of the English.
