A right pleasant and merye History, of the Mylner of Abyngton, with his
Wife, and his fair Daughter: and of two poor scholars of Cambridge.

Whereunto is adjoined another merye Jest, of a Sargeaunt that would have
learned to be a Friar.

Imprinted at London, by Richard Ihones.

A very merry History, of the Milner of Abington,
Fair Lordings if you list to here
A merry Jest your minds to cheer,
Then harken to this merry tale
Was never meryer set to sale
At Abyngton it so befell
Thereby a widow late did dwell
She had two sons that she loved well
For father had they none
At Cambrige are they set I wene
Five mile is them between
Their spendinge was full mean,
To the scole there did they go
Some learning for to get you know
By good men's help they were kept so
Other finding none they had
This life long they led
The mother found them at board and bed
And by these means were they fed
More than seven year
Their mother then upon a day
To Cambridhe she took the way
And to her sons began she say
With a heavy chere
Sons I will be here anon
And than I wot ye will come home
But corn nor bread can I get none,
The country is so dear.
Mother then they said anon
we will into the country gone
To goo^d men and make our moan
If we may any thing get,
So long they went from town to town
In the country up and down
That they gate in short season
A large met of wheat
Than anon when they it had
Unto their mother they it lad
And she thereof was full glad
But long they ne let
But at their neighbors house on the morn
They borrowed a horse to carry their corn
To the mill them beforne
For nothing would they let
The mylner was ioly in his works all
He had a daughter fair and small
The clerk of the town loved her above all
Iankyn was his name
The mylner was so true and feel
Of each man's corn would he steal
More than his Toledish by a deal
He let for no shame
He was so subtle and so slye
He would it take before their eye
And make them a proper lie
And put himself out of blame*
To the mylner they were sand
In the mylle door did he stand
They tied their horse with a band
They had hard of his name
That one clerk to that other swear
Of the thief we will beware
Have he never so mykell care
Of our corn gets he bu^ small
Though he go out of his wit
Thou shalt by the spoute sit
Till the poke fast be knyt
And the meal in all
Though he be never so woe
And I will up unto the stones go
And he begyle us both two
Foul might him befall:
The corn up the Milner wan
And than the clerk fast up ran
By the stones still stood he than
Till it was ground infere
The mylners house is nere
Not the length of a land
In a valey can it stand
Two mile from Abyngton
In his heart had he care
For the clerks were so ware
He might not do as he ^yd are
But to his son began run
Boy look thou let for no dread
The clerks horse home thou led
Also fast as thou may speed
Or the meal be done
Behind my backhouse door him set
For they shall fail of their men
Tho the poke fast be knet
I swear by my crown
The litell boy stint naught
Till the horse was home brought
Thereof wiste the clerks naught
Forsothe as I you say
The clerks their meal up hent
And out at the door they went
Alas they said we be shent
By god than the milner swear
Than get you him no mare
For some thief was of him ware
And has had him away
The one clerk said to the other
Go we seek him self brother
Thou one way and I another
Find him if we may,
But ever they dread of the meal
That the milner would thereof steal
The poke they bound, and set on a seal
And their horse than sought they.
The mylner laughed them to scorn
And great oaths has he sworn
If he might have none of their corn
He would have of their meal,
His daughter to the mill can fare
And his diner to him bare
And also fast he told her yare
All every deal:
How two clerks in the morn
Brought with them a met of corn
And ever they warned me beforne
That I should none steal
But do now daughter as I thee say
Go fet me a shete I the pray
And in faith I will do say
To get of the meal
For nothing would let
On a white shete he it set
And much flower he out bet
And hole was the seal
With two staves in the stoure
They dange thereon whiles they might doure
Till they had a pecke of flower
Forsothe as I you say
They gathered it up than anon
And put it in a poke full soon
And bade his daughter bear it home
Even the right way
Then the clerks had mykell thought
For their horse they sought
That they him find might naught*
Of all that long day
And when the night drew nere
At the mylle they met in fere
And both they made a simple chere
For their goodly hackeny
That one clerk said by god of might
Me think our poke is waxen light
I think it be not all a right
That lyketh me full ill
My heed thereto dare I lay
That he has stolen some away
That other clarke said* nay nay,
The seal stands on still:
They both did to the milner say
Herberowe us to night we thee pray
And we will therefore well pay
What so ever thou will
For we dare not to the town gone
Till we bring our horse hoine
If we do by sweet saint John
We mon like it ill
The mylner said by gods might
I shall barborowe you to night
And your supper shall be dight
Right well if we may
There they bare their meal bitwene them two
And home with the mylner did they go
His wife welcomed them tho
So did his daughter gay
About a fire they were set
And good ale was there fet
And therewith they their mouths wet
And soon souped they
At their supper as they made them glad
That one clerk nyce countenance made
And privily on the maidens foot he tread
And she turned away
When they had eaten and made them glad
The Milner his daughter bade
Soon that a bed were made
Also fast as you may,
And make it by the side binke
That the clerks may therein wink
And sleep till it be day:
For I will to my bed win
And if you here any din
It is my man does come in
Forsothe as I you say,
For he is in the town at his warke
When he does come in the hounde will bark
This meant the milner by the clarke
That held his daughter gay
By one side the clarke lay
By the other side his wife and he I say
And for his daughter so gay
An other bed was dyght,
In a chamber as I ween
Was a wall them between
And a cake she made so clean
Thereof the clerks had a sight:
Of their own meal it was
Her lemman befell such a case
Harken sirs how it was
That he might not come that night,
For to a fair was there beside
On his masters erande for to ride
Erly in the morrow tide
Before any day light.
This one clarke still he lay
And thought on this Dam^ell gay
And to his brother can he say
What is me best to do,
For by god and by saint Mighell
I think so on the damsel
I had much lever than I can tell
That I might win her to:
His brother said this is naught
Of my horse I have more thought
By Jesus that me dear bought
How we may win him to.
Yet lie still brother I the pray
For come there what come may
At the door I will assaie
If it will undo,
This one clarke to the door can fare
She said Iankin be ye there
Ye forsothe he did answer
And in there did he go,
Against a form he hurt his shin
Or he might to the bed win
Therefore the clarke was woe.
Iankin she said for Mary dear
Why ^o ye make such cheer
Your way should you better leere
So often as you come here
As that word the clarke loughe
And by the voice to her he drough
Of her he had his will enough
And plaide them togy^her,
When the (...) ^^d done his will
By the damsel he (...)
^
How two clerks came thither,
Upon the monday at morn
And brought with them a met of of corn
On a horse them beforne
And both they were full lither.
For the one clarke stood at the spoute
There as the meal should come out
That other went ever about
And let us of our pray,
My father did see it might be none other
He rowned unto my brother
And bade it should be none other
But led their horse away.
My litell brother blinned naught
Ere their horse was home brought
Like two fools they have him sought
All this long day,
As we at our supper sat
That one clarke nice countenance made
And priuelie on my foot he trade
But ever I turned a^aie.
Upon the poke he set the seal
For my father should none steal
yet we had of their meal
And of their whitest flower,
For nothing would he let
On a shete we it set
And with two staves it bet
As long as we might doure.
And into our backhouse their horse is brought
Thereof wotte the clerks naught
The clarke laughed and made good cheer
When he of that might hear
That was well done my derling dear,
By God my savior:
Both together a sleep they fell,
Of the other clarke I will you tell
And of the Milners wife how it befell
A while if you will abide,
All waking still he lay
And in his heart he thought aye
My fellow has a merry play
In this even tide.
The Mylners wife did rise water to make
Stilly for the milner should not wake
The right way again could she not take,
For the house was so wide.
But a child in a cradell lay
At the beds feet as I you say
Thereby she knew the right way
Unto her beds side,
The clarke lay and hard ylke dele
And of the cradell he wist well
And if thou rise by saint Michaell
The cradell shall away:
Again he rose or she did sleep
The clarke thereof took good keep
Out of his bed soon he can creep
As fast as ever he may,
For nothing would he let
The cradell away he fet
At his beds side he it set,
Forsothe as I you say,
The good wife came anon
And till her husband can she gone
But cradell found she there none,
She did seek full fast alwaie.
All about she groped fast
The cradell found she at the last
The Milner did sleep full fast
And wist not of this warke,
By the cradell that she there fande,
She had went it had been her husband
She lift up the clothes with her hand
And laid her down by the clarke,
Thus that one clarke lay by the wife
That other by the daughter by my life
Had the milner wist there had been strife
For that nights warke,
That one clarke waked and he did say
That by the Milners daughter lay
I must to a fair gone or it be day,
And on he did his sarke.
Now I pray you my hind Le^man free
A gown cloth then buie you me
And I swear so mote I thee,
I will pay therefore:
By Jesus he said my sweeting
I have but three shylling
That is but a little thing
But if I had more,
Thus the clarke he made it towe
The Damsel her forcer to her draw
By God ye shall have inowe
For to pay therefore.
The key by the cofer did hang
Forth she drew thirty shillinge
Forsothe every farthinge
And neither less nor more.
The thirty shillinge she began him take
This made I sir for your sake
Take it now with you all,
Now have good day mine own swetinge
For long or any day does spring
The ^^cke full merely his note will singe
And my master will me call
Full merry chere the clarke can make
With thirty shillinge and his cake
The right way can he take
Down by the wall,
Till he came at his brothers bed
Than from the cradell away he yedde
And anon away he fled
On the further side of the hall:
Of his silver he took good keep
Down by the milner can he creep
And wakened him out of his sleep
And said will thou hear a good game,
For I have had a merry night
With the milners daughter bright
Me likes well by gods might
That we wend not home,
For I have thirty shillinge and a cake
That the false thief fro our corn did take
With that the milner did wake
By god and by saint Ihon,
And also she has me told
How he has our horse in hold
In his backhouse he has him bold
I pray god give him shame
The milner starte up redely
Thou lie he said with great envy
And that shalt thou full dear abye
Thief what have thou done,
He sterte up in a great teene
And stout strokes was them between
The milner was the more keen
And gate the clarke down.
His wife waked anon right
Out sir she said the clerks do fight
The one will slay the other to night
But if you part them soon*
The clarke wakened and had great wonder
But he durst them not sunder
Full well he saw his fellow under
By the light of the moon.
The milners wife hent a staff tite
Sir she said who shall I smite
Dame said the clarke, him in the white
Hit him if thou may,
The milner befell a foul hap
He had on his night cappe
His wife lent him such a rappe
That still on ground he lay.
Thus the milners heed was broken
The backhouse fast was broken
Believe me the clerks braste it open
And in than went ^hey,
The meal on the horse they cast
And away they hyed them fast
With all their things home they paste
Long or any day.
Forth they went by M^^ne light,
To Abington they came right
Before it was day light
Home unto their Dame,
Than was her heartfull light
When she saw her son in sight
She thanked God with all her might
That they were comen home,
All their meal and thirty shylling
They gave their mother without leasing
And sense they told her of that thing
They let for no blame,
Their mother said if ye do right
Keep ye well out of his sight
For if he may get you by gods might
He will do you shaine.
Of that silver the clerks were feign
The one clarke hied with all his maine
And led their horse home again
Upon the same morn,
The mother them a Lapon slew
And of the cake they eat inowe
And soon to Cambridge they drew,
There as they were beforne.
^wentie shylling with them they bare
Unto the schole began they fare
The Mylner gate of them no mare,
If he had it sworn.
When they were gone these scollers both
I tell you plain this milner was loathe
And to his bed again he gothe
For he was full of pain,
His wife before had given him
Vengeable strypes by sweet saint Sim
She had almost broken both lithe and lim
Of the Milner I tell you plain.
And so the milner and his wife
For this folishe deed they had great strife
All the days of their life
That he had been so mad,
And the daughter that was young
Did often singe a sorry song
And wisshed for the clarke that was so long
With her gown clothe to make her gl^^.
And also for his merry play
She longed for him full sore in fay
That he should come again that way
Though she should never the clothe see,
The wenche she was full proper and nyce
Among all other she bare great price
For she could trick it point device
But few like her in that country.
At the last the milner vn^rewe
That had been beaten both black and blewe
His own deed he began to rewe
And though he had been false,
For many a trewer thank
Was judged without pite
Upon a dreadful gallowe tree
To be hanged by the halse
But sore sick in his bed
All his life he led
That he was feign to be fed
Of his wife withouten mis
Thus with short conclusion
This milner through his abusion
Was brought to confusion
For all his falsehed iwis
And ended his life full wretchedly
In pain, care, and misery
Wherefore he did bear an horn
For steeling of meal this only
His wife and his daughter were lain by
Of two poor scolers full merely
That often did laugh him to scorn
In patience he must take it al
In chamber, in bower, and eke in hall
What so ever the folk than did him call
Contented must he be:
Thus ends this merry jest iwis
And Christ that is king of eternal blis
Bring us all there when his will is,
Amen for charity.
FINIS.
A merry gest, how a Sergeaunt would learn to be a Friar.
WIse men always, affirm and say,
the best is for each man.
Diligently, for to apply,
such business as he can,
And in no wise, to enterprise,
another faculte:
For he that will, and can no skill,
is never like to thee.
He that has left, the hosiers craft,
and fall to making shone.
The smith that shall, to painting fall,
his thrifte is well nigh done.
A black draper, with white paper,
to go to writing scole.
An old butteler, become a cutteler,
I wene shall prove a fool.
An old trotte, that can (God wotte,)
nothing but kis the cup.
With her physic, will keep one sick,
till she have sowsed him up.
A man of law, that never saw,
the ways to buie and sell.
Weninge to arise, by marchaundyse,
I pray God speed him well.
A merchant eke; that will go seek,
all the means he may.
To fall in suit, till he dispute,
his money clean away.
Pleading the law, for every straw,
shall prove a thriftie man.
With bate and strife, but by my life,
I can not tell you when
When an hatter, will go smatter,
in phylosophie.
Or a peddler, wax a medlar,
in theologye.
All that ensewe, such crafts new,
they drive so far a cast.
That evermore, they do therefore,
beshrewe themself at last.
This thing was tried, and verefied,
here by a sergeaunt late.
That rufully was, or he could pas,
rapped about the pa^e.
While that he would, see how he could,
in Gods name play the friat.
Now if ye will, know how it fyl,
take heed and ye shall hear.
It happed so, not long ago,
a thriftie man there did.
An hundred pound of nobles round,
(...) had he laid a side.
His (...) he would, should have this gold
so* to begin withal.
But to suffice, his child well thryues,
(...)y were to small.
yet o^ this day, I have herd say,
that many a man certesse,
Has with good cast, be ritche at the last,
that begone with less.
But this young man, so well he can,
his money to imp(...)
That certainly, his (...),
to see it was a joy(...)*
For least some blast might ouercast,
his ship or by mischaunce.
Men with some wyle, might him beguile,
and minishe his substance.
For to put out, al manner dout,
he made a good puruaie.
For every whit, by his own wit,
and took another way.
First fair and well, a pretty deal,
he hyd it in a pot.
But than him thought, that way was naught
and there he left it not.
So was he feign, from thence again,
to put it in a cup.
And by and by, as couetouslie,
he supped it fair up.
In his own breast* he thought it best,
his money to enclose,
Then wist he well, what ever fell,
he could it never lose.
He borrowed than, of another man,
money and marchaundice:
Never paid it, up he laid it,
in like manner wise.
Yet on the gear, that he would wear,
he taught not what he spent:
So it were nice, as for the price.
could him not myscontent.
With lusty sport, and with resort,
of ioly company.
In mirth and play, (...) a day,
he lived merrily.
And men had sworn, some man is borne,
to dignite and power.
And so was he, for such degree*
he gate and such honowre,
That without doubt, when he went out,
a sergeaunt well and fair.
Was ready straight, on him to weight,
as soon as on the maire,
But he doutlesse, of his mekenes,
hated such pomp and pride.
And would not go, accompanied so,
but drew himself aside.
To saint Katherine, straight as a line,
he gate him at a tide
For promotion, or devotion,
there would he needs bide.
There spent he fast, till all was past*
and to him came there many.
To ask their debt, but none could get,
the valor of a penie.
With visage stout, he bare it out,
unto the hard hedge,
A month or twain till he was feign,
to lay his gown to pledge.
Than was he there, in greater fear,
than or that he came thither.
And would as feign, depart again,
but that he wist not whither.
Than after this, to a friend of his.
he went and ther^ (...).
Where as he lay, (...) ^lwaie,
he might not come (...)e.
It happed than, a merchant man
that he ought money to,
Of an officer, that began enquire,
what him was best to do.
And he aunswerd, be not a ferde,
take an action therefore,
I you behest, I shall him rest,
and than care for no more.
I fear quod he, it will not be,
for he will not come out.
The sergeaunt said, be not afraid,
it shall be brought about,
In many a game, like to the same,
have I been well in ure,
And for your sake, let me be bake,
but if I do this cure.
Thus part they both, and to him goth,
a pace this officer,
And for a day, all his araie,
he changed with a friar.
So was he dight, that no man might,
him for a friar deny.
He dopped and douked, he spoke and looked,
so religiously.
Yet in a glass, or he would pass,
he toted and he pored.
His heart for pride, lept in his side,
to see how well he fryred.
Then forth a pace, unto the place,
he goes in Gods (...)*
To do this deed, (...) take heed,
for here begins (...)gain.
He drew him nie, and then softly,
at the door he knocked.
A Damsel, that heard him well,
there came and it unlocked.
The Friar said, God speed fair maid,
here lodges such a man:
It is told me, well sir quoth she,
and if he do? what than?
Quod he, maistresse, no harm doutlesse,
it longs for our order.
To hurt no man, but as we can,
every wight to forder.
With him truly, feign speak would I,
sir quod she, by my faye:
He is so sick, ye be not like,
to speak with him to day.
Quoth he fair may, yet I you pray,
thus much at my desyer:
Vouchsafe to do, as go him too,
and say an Austen Friar,
Would with him speak, and matters break,
for his avail certain.
Quod she I will, stand ye here still,
till I come down again.
Up is she go, and told him so:
as she was bode to say.
He mistrustinge, no manner thing,
said maiden go thy way.
And fetch him hither, that we to gither:
may talk a down she goth,
And up him brought, no harm she thought,
but it made some folk wroth.
But this officer, this fained friar,
when he was come a lofte,
He dopped than, and greet this man,
religiously and often.
And he again, right glad and feign,
took him thereby the hand:
The friere than said, ye be dismaide*
with trouble I understand.
In deed quod he, it has with me,
been better than it is.
Sir quod the friar, be of good chere,
ye shall yet after this.
For christ's sake, look that ye take,
no thought into your breast,
God may turn all, and so he shall,
I trust unto the best.
But I would now, common with you,
in counsel if you please,
Or else not, of matters that,
shall set your heart at ease.
Down went the maid the merchant said
now say on gentill friar,
Of this tidinge, that ye me bring,
I long full sore to hear.
When there was none, but they alone,
the friar with evil grace*
Said I rest thee, come on with me,
and out he took his mace:
Thou shalt obey, come on thy way,
I have thee in my clouche*
Thou go not hence, for all the pence,
the mayre has in his pouche.
This merchant there, for wrath and fear.
waringe well nighe wood:
Said horeson the^e, with a very mischefe,
who has taught thee thy good?
And with his fist, upon the list.
he gave him such a blow,
That backewarde down, almost in swoune,
the friar is overthrow.
Yet was this man, well fearder than,
lest he the friar had slain:
Till with good rappes, and heavy clappes,
he dawed him up again.
The friar took heart, and up he starte,
and well he laid about,
And so there gothe, between them both,
many a lusty cloute.
They rent and tere, each other here,
and claue togider fast:
Till with lugginge, halinge and tugginge,
they fell down both at last.
Than on the ground, to gether round,
with many a heavy stroke.
They roll and romble, they turn and tumble,
like pigs do in a poke.
So long above, they heave and shoue,
together that at the last,
The maid and the wife, to break the strife,
hied them upward fast.
And when they see, the captains lie,
waltringe in the place,
The friars hood, they pulled a good,
a down about his face.
While he was blind, the wenche behind,
lent him on the flore.
Many a iole, about the nole,
with a great battill door.
The wife came to it, and with her feet*
she help to keep him down:
And with her rock, many a knock,
she gave him on the crown.
They laid his mace, about his face,
that he was wode for pain,
The friar frap, gate many a swap,
till he was well nighe slain.
Up they him lift, and with evil thrifte,
hedlong all the staire:
Down they him threw, and said a dew*
recommaunde us to the mayre.
The friar arose, but I suppose,
amassed was his hedde:
He shoke his here is, and from great teres*
he thought him well a fled.
Quod he now lost is all this cost,
we be never the nere:
Ill mot he thee, that caused me,
to make my self a friar.
Now masters all, an end I shall,
make there as I began.
In any wise, I would auyse,
and council every man.
His own craft use, all new refuse,
and utterly let them gone.
Play not the friar, now make good cheer,
and welcome euerychone.
FINIS.
