A Proclamation set forth by the kings Majesty, for the abstinence from
flesh, in the time of Lent, and other days prohibited, the.xiiii. day of
February, in the seventh year of his Majesty's most prosperous Reign.
WHereas in the Parliament holden at Westminster the second year of the kings
majesty's reign, one act, emo^ges diverse others, was made, that no person, or
persons should after a certain time willingly, and wittingly eat any kind
of flesh upon any Fridaie, Saterdaie, any day within the time of Lent, nor at
any such other day, as was at that time, or should be at any time
afterward, commonly accepted, and reputed as a fish day within this realm
of England, under diverse and great penalties, as in thesaid act more largely
does appear. Forasmuch as thesaied act founded upon sondrie and wholesome
considerations contained in the same, has sithen been by diverse and many
fearelesse subjects, most disobediently and stubbernely, infringed, broken and
neglected, to the great contempt of his majesty's laws, and the notable
offense also of almighty god, who has commanded princes ordinances, to be
observed, not only for fear of their indignation, but also for conscience
sake. His majesty having due consideration of the great scarcetie of victual,
and specially of flesh, that is grown within this realm, and that by
thabstinence of eating of flesh in times prohibited, much flesh is bred and
increased, to the continual and more plentiful sustenaunce of his subjects,
most straightly charge and commands, that from and after the making of
this his highness present Proclamation, and publishyng of the same, no manner
of person, or persons, dwelling, inhabityng, resiaunt, or abidyng, within
this his realm of England, or any other his Dominions, or territories, having
no license of his highness to eat flesh in the times prohibited by the said
act, ne being provided, forprised, or excepted by thesaied act, do
willingly, or wittyngly, eat any manner of flesh in the times of Lent, or in,
or upon any other days prohibited by thesaied act, contrary to the effect,
purporte, and tenor of the same, upon the peines, and penalties contained in
thesaied Estatute, and as they will besides that, avoid his highness
indignation, and displeasure.

And that no manner of person, or persons, keeping, or that shall keep, any
tavern, inn, hostrie, alehouses, victuallyng house, common, or usual table,
for any gestes, within his said Realm, or dominions, from, and after the
making of this his highness proclamation, utter any flesh in any kind of
manner, in their houses, or elsewhere, in any the times prohibited by thesaied
act, or statute, to be eaten by any person, not licenced or provided for, as
is aforesaied, upon theselfe same penalties, as against the eaters thereof, in
thesaid act is provided.

And that no Butcher, ne other person, after the making of this proclamation
(except he shall be specially licenced by his highness, under the great seal of
England) shall sell any flesh, being dead, within his said Realm, or
Dominions, to be eaten in, or upon, any the days, or times prohibited by
thesaied act, upon like peine, and peines, as is before last expressed, and
limited.

And for the better example to be given by them which have any license, his
majesty's pleasure is, that no manner of person, or persons, having any
license by his majesty's lettres patentes, or priuileged by thesaied estatute
to eat flesh, do in any wise eat the same flesh, upon any days prohibited,
in any open place of his, or their house, or in any such assembly, as they
use on other days accustomed, for eating of flesh, but that he and they
having license, use the same secretly, and modestly.

And that as well the Mayor of London for the time being, as all Justices of
peace, and all other Majors, sherifes, bailefes, constables, and head Officers,
of al and every, city, county, borough, Town, and Village, within this his
realm of England, and all other his highness dominions, and territories as
they will avoid his highness displeasure, and indignation, and will further
answer at their peril, do from time to time after the making of this his
highness proclamation, within their rules, jurisdictions, aucthorities,
precinctes, and circuites, truly, and diligently, with all speed from time to
time, search and try out, al manner thoffences, contemptes, and inobediences
aforesaid, and for the due execution of the aforesaied Estatute, and the
tenor of this proclamation, do devise some weekly search, so as by their
diligence, the Law may have some fruict, and profit, as it is very nedeful:
and upon knowledge, and due proof thereof made, that they and every of them
furthwith commit al and every such offendour and offenders, to emprisonment,
there safe, and surely to be kept, and remain, and farther to be punished,
according unto the penalties by degrees, contained in the foresaied act, and in
case any be found upon thesaied punishementes, not amended, then such to be
as notable and incorrigible persons, certified to his majesty, or his
counsel, that some grievous open punishment of such, may be example to al
others.

And that al and every his loving and true subjects, be from time to time,
aidyng, helpyng, and assistyng to all and every such Mayor and Majors,
Justices, and other officers aforesaied, in the doing, and executyng of
theffect and purport of this his highness proclamation, as they will answer
to his Majesty upon their uttermost peril, and as they will avoid his
highness grievous indignation, and displeasure. For certainly, such is the
kings determinate purpose, to have this thoroughly executed.

God save the king.
