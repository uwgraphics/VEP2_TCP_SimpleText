royal blazon of the House of Stuart
By the King.
AS often as We call to mind the most joyful and just Recognition made by the
whole body of our Realm, in the first Session of our High Court of Parliament,
of that blessing which it has pleased God to reserve many years in his
Providence to our Person, and now in the fullness of the time of his
Disposition, to bestow upon Us; Namely the blessed Union, or rather Reuniting
of these two mighty, famous, and ancient Kingdoms of England and Scotland,
under one Imperial Crown: So often do We think, that it is our duty, to
do our uttermost endeavor, for the advancement and perfection of that work,
which is of his beginning, and whereof he has given so many palpable signs
and Arguments, as he that sees them not, is blind, and he that impugneth
them, does but endeavor to separate that, which God has put together. For, to
omit those things which are evident to sense, That the Isle within it self
has almost none but imaginary bounds of separation without, but one common
limit or rather Guard of the Ocean Sea, making the whole a little world within
it self, the Nations an uniformity of constitutions both of body and mind,
especially in Martial prowesses, A community of Language, the principal
means of Civil society, An unity of Religion, the chiefest band of hearty
Union, and the surest knot of lasting Peace: What can be a more express
Testimony of Gods authority of this work, then that two mighty Nations,
having been ever from their first separation continually in blood each against
other, should for so many years immediately before our Succession, be at peace
together, as it were to this end, That their memory being free from sense of
the smart of former injuries, their minds might, in the time of Gods
appointment, more willingly come together, That it has pleased him so to
dispose, that this Union is not enforced by Conquest and violence, nor
contracted by doubtful and deceiuable points of transaction, but naturally
derived from the Right and Title of the precedent Princes of both Kingdoms,
concurring in our Person, alike lineally descended from the blood of both
through the Sacred conjunction of Wedlock, An Union which is the work of God
and Nature, and whereunto the works of Force or Policy cannot attain? We
may addehereunto that which We have received from those that be skillful in the
Laws of this Land, That immediately upon our Succession, diverse of the ancient
Laws of this Realm are Ipso facto expired, As namely, that of Escuage, and of
the Naturalization of the Subjects, And that there is a greater affinity and
concurrence between most of the ancient Laws of both Kingdoms, then is to be
found between those of any other two Nations, As namely, in states of
Inheritance and Freehold, as Fee-simple, Fee-taile, Tenant for life, by
Courtesy, Dower, and such like, In Cases of descents of Inheritance, In
Tenures of Lands, as of Knights service, Socage, Frank Almoigne, Burgage,
Villenage, and such like, In Writts and forms of Process, In cases of Trial
by Iuries, Grand Iuries; And lastly in Officers and Ministers of Justice, As
Sheriffs, Coroners, and such like, which We leave to be further considered by
the Commissioners of both Realms.

All which being matter prepared only by the Providence of Almighty God, and
which by humane Industry could not have been so ordered; We, and all our
Subjects ought first with reverence to acknowledge his Handie-worke therein,
and to give him our most humble thanks for the same, and then to further by
our endeavors that, which his Wisdom does by so many signs point out to be
his Will: Whereof many particularities depending upon the determinations of the
States and Parliaments of both Realms, We leave them there to be discussed,
according to the Commissions granted by the several Acts of both
Parliaments. And some other things resting in Our own Imperial Power, as the
Head of both, We are purposed toward the building of this excellent work, to
do by Our self that, which justly and safely We may by Our absolute power
do. And for a first stone of this work, whereupon the rest may be laid,
seeing there is undoubtedly but one Head to both Peoples, which is Our self;
And that unfeignedly We have but one Heart and Mind to communicate equally to
both States, as Lines issuing from one Center, Our Justice, our Favors, and
whatsoever else depends upon the Unity of Our Supreme power over both, (God
having ministered to Us so just cause to embrace them both with equal and
indifferent Love, in as much as Our Birth, and the first part of Our life has
been in the one, and the later part thereof is like to be for the most part in
the other:) We think it unreasonable, that the thing, which is by the work
of God and Nature so much in effect one, should not be one in name; Unity in
name being so fit a means to imprint in the hearts of people, a Character and
memorial of that Unity, which ought to be amongst them indeed.

Wherefore We have thought good to discontinue the divided names of England
and Scotland out of our Regal Style, and do intend and resolve to take and
assume unto Us in manner and form hereafter expressed, The Name and Style of
KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, including therein according to the truth, the whole
Island. Wherein no man can imagine Us to be led by an humor of Vaineglory or
Ambition, because we should in that case, rather delight in a long enumeration
of many Kingdoms and Seigniories, (whereof in Our Inheritance We have plenty
enough, if We thought there were glory in that kind of Style) but only that
We use it as a signification of that, which in part is already done, and a
significant Prefiguration of that, which is to be done hereafter; Nor that We
covet any new affected Name devised at Our pleasure, but out of undoubted
knowledge do use the true and ancient Name, which God and Time have imposed
upon this Isle, extant, and received in Histories, in all Mappes and Carts,
wherein this Isle is described, and in ordinary Letters to Our self from
diverse Foreign Princes, warranted also by Authentical Charters,
Exemplifications under Seals, and other Records of great Antiquity, giving Us
president for our doing, not borrowed out of Foreign Nations, but from the
Acts of our Progenitors, Kings of this Realm of England, both before and
since the Conquest, having not had so just and great cause as We have.

Upon all which considerations We do by these Presents, by force of our Kingly
Power and Prerogative, assume to Our self by the cleerenesse of our Right, The
Name and Style of KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND, DEFENDER OF THE
FAITH, etc. as follows in Our just and lawful Style, And do hereby publish,
promulge and declare the same, to the end that in all Proclamations, Missiues
foreign, and Domestical, Treaties, Leagues, Dedicatories, Impressions, and in
all other cases of like nature, the same may be used and observed. And to the
end the same may be the sooner and more universally diuulged both at Home and
abroad: Our will and pleasure is, That the same Style be from henceforth used
upon all Inscriptions upon our current Moneys and Coins of Gold and Silver
hereafter to be Minted. And for that We do not Innouate or assume to Us any
new thing, but declare that which is and has been evident to all; Our will and
pleasure is, That in such Appellations or Nominations, as shall be hereafter
made by force of these presents, the same shall be expressed in such and the
same manner and form, and after such computation, as if we had assumed and
declared the same the first day of our Reign of our Realm of England;
Forbearing only for the present that any thing herein contained do extend to
any Legal proceeding, Instrument, or Assurance, until further Order be taken
in that behalf.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the twentieth day of October, in the
second year of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the
eight and thirtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
