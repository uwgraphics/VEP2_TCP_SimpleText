AN ANSWER TO THE Dragon and Grasshopper, In a Dialogue between an Old Monkey
AND A Young Weazel At the Three Cranes Tavern in the Poultry, where they are
daily to be seen.

AS ALSO Some Remarks upon the Amsterdam and London AESOP's.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, School.

ANSWER TO THE Dragon and Grasshopper, etc.
THE repeated Rumors of so many Aesop's (...) Amrstrdam, Tunbridge, Bath,
White Hall, (...) speaking through the feigned Mouths of Asses Wo^^ Foxes, Dogs,
Owls, etc. And last of all dead D^^^ons and Grasshoppers, has so animated an
Old Monkey (...) a Young Weazel, at the Three-Crain-Tavern in the P^^try, that
they are resolved to speak as well as the (...) and thereupon last Saturday
began a serious Confere^^ which is not yet ended, where any Person who has
(...) curiosity, may there be further satisfied by occular ^^monstration.
However, what has hitherto passed ^^tween them, I have here inserted, which for
diver^^ sake, I hope will be accepted.

MONKEY. How now little Animal; why so bold to enter (...) Cabin without
asking my leave?


WEAZEL. Most Reverend Sir, I have been lately surprised in a (...) therefore
pray pardon my Silence, for oftentimes Traps are (...) for Words, us well us
Wolves and Weazles.


MONKEY. It Is very true; But that is not the Answer to my Que^^on: I ask you
once more, why you came here, and (...) what cause? for it is not ordinary for
a Weazel an^^ Monkey to be Associates, especially in a Tavern.


WEAZEL. Sir, with submission to your grave Worship, I am (...) up an
Extranordinary Message, no less than in the Quality of ^^bassador from that
High and Mighty Strte-Animal Menheer ^^^ashopper, on the Royal Exchange in
Cornhill.


MONKEY. Oh, high Preferment indeed! But Cousin, you mi^e the Person and Place
too, your business, I suppose, with the Dragon on Bow-Steeple, for you Master
and he ^e had a great Controversy of late; but I fear thou art (...) humble a
Creature to approach his Prefence, he is ^^ud and lofty.


WAEZEL. I know his Disposition well enough; however my business present is not
with him, but to acquaint thee that there is a ^^aty of Peace on Foot between
them, therefore I leave thee approach his presence; for my part, I have not the
are on so much as to think of it.


MONKEY Hey, hey, what is it come to that, to make choice a Monkey for
Mediator? Sure the Bear that beat the ^^um, might have been thought more worthy
of that ^^nour, for he speaks their Language better than I can.


WEAZEL. (...) is true, Monsieue Dragon gave that Creaturea favour^^e Character
at their last Conference, but Menheer Grashop^^^^ rejected him as a
Counterfeiter, and not as a true Imitator of ^^^ir Speech and Actions, and made
choice of thee, a wise, so (...) Creature, every way qualified for such a
mighty un-dertaking.


MONKEY. So, so, Cousion, I find the Old Proverb true with a ^^^ness, viz, Like
Master, like Man. I see thou have learn their Art of Flattery to a
Hairs-breadth; but no wond^^ when Grasshoppers are advanced, if VVeazels Chatter
(...) Authority. However, to be plain with thee, I don^^ care to meddle with
two such lofty Figures, for they a^^ both Damnable brazen-sac'd, and will stand
to nothing long, let their Promises be never so fair, they being (...) Nature
unsteady and mutable; and indeed it is in vain (...) expect any other from two
Weather-Cocks, who are su^^ect to be turned by every shuft of Wind.


WEAZEL. Most grave Sir, pray be not Angry with me, for (...) charging my
Office; though they be mutuble, let us be fixed; If t^^ are lofty, we are lowly;
If they are proud, let us be humble If they quarrel, let us agree; If they
contend we'll conform; (...) them hate, we'll love one another; If they he
Hypocrites, we'll (...) Honest; Therefore by my Consent, let us (now we are thus
luc^^net) diverse our selves only with some private (the innoce^^ discourse,
laugh at their Folly, and leave them to thems^ver.


MONKEY. With all my Heart; but before we proceed, tell (...) your Opinion,
(for I know you are Cunning enoug^ what People will say, if it should be known
that the M^^key and VVeazel have been Discoursing together, beca^^^ 'twill not
be believed that beast have the Gift of Speaking.


WEAZEL, Why, if it comes to that, I Will speak through the Lang^^^ of Balaam's
Ass, in the very Face of them: Nay and more (...) that, if some should be so
Atheistically obstinate, and account (...) Fictious and too far fetched, I Will
come nearer home, and (...) themseveral Speaking Asses under their own Roofs;
though per^^ far short of Balaam's Ass for understanding; for she never (...) but
when she had occasion, but those do it when they have (...) therefore why not
thee and I for our Diversion?


MONKEY. Hah, hah, ha! thou art a Creature of a very pleas^^ ^nversation; thou
have now hit the Nail on the Head (...) since I have avoided that troublesome
Task of being ^^diator between those who are never like to agree, let ^eave off
this Ass-like talk, and return again to them that think thou of this high
advanced spungy Animal (...) Insect, the Grasshopper?


WEAZEL. You or I may think of him what we will; I am sure the People (...)
gone after him, and he now plainly tell you in what Gor(...) the VVind stands.


MONKEY. How? the People gone after him! I hope not so far, ^t they may find
the way back again, notwithstanding ^^ists, Fogs, and Bad VVeather, which have
lately hap^^ned; and as for his Directing where the winds sits, (...)-Steeple
Dragon will perform that, if not better; (...) in my Opinion it goes much
Truer, though not so well as (...) should do.


WEAZEL. No wonder if they Err in their true Course, when they conti^ually Jar
one against another; for though they are turned both with ^^e Wind, yet one Wind
does not always turn them. I remember (...) other Day at their Dispute, the
Grasshopper boastingly told ^he Dragon to his Face, that she and her Sons had
Outwitted ^im, by leaping over his Stumbling Blocks, meaning Oaths,
^acraments, etc. or indeed any thing else that lies in their way ^o Greatness.


MONKEY. Well, and it is not yet forgotten since they both took Hands, (but now
farther assunder) and leaped over a Dreadful Stumbling Block by one Consent,
though I believe one of them (but I will not say which) Repents the Bargain. I
suppose you understand my meaning.


WEAZEL. Yaw, Menheer Monkey; but Divines tell us that late R^pentance is very
Dangerous, especially when the Sinner's case (...) desperate and deplorable:
But I have no skill in Divinity therefore leave your Worship to make the
Application


MONKEY. All that I shall say (...) it, is, that though late Repentance^ not
commendable, nor to be trusted too, yet it is bette^ than never, though many
times (...) proves a great O^stacle to it, aad sometimes (...) it: But what is
it (...) thee and I, let them look to that.


WEAZEL Nay, for my part, it shall not troubl^ (...), nor I (...) will (...) some
of them much; However, out of (...), I (...) but pity their wilful Rashness, (I
was going ^o say Ignorance (...) but considering that some (nay^ many) of (...)
so plent^^fully endowed with the Gifts of Natural as (...) Qua^^fications, they
may justly be acquitted from all manner of Suspiti^^ of being guilty of the
latter, though not altogether from the former^


MONKEY. Why, prethe^ no Body accuses them either of th^^ one or the other,
unless it be their own Conscience, an^^ perhaps many of them are Pistol-proof
against that to^^ for having assumed the Nature of weather-Cocks, a Stor^^^ can
but turn them, and a Calm finds them as the last win^^ left 'em; therefore
here is (seeming) Safety enough, o^^ would think, notwithstanding the many
Scare-Crow^^ which often hover over (nay, and sometimes light upon (...) their
Heads, to theirs as well as others Amazement.


WEAZEL. Pray Mr. Monkey, let us leave these Weather-C^ck Storie^ and Discourse
a little of the Times: Pray what News is n^^^ on foot?


MONKEY. Truly none at all, as I hear of, for the Discourse (...) turned into
Fables and Fictions; all the Talk is, that O^^^ Aesop that Fablemonger, was
lately seized at Tunbridge, his ^^dget rifled, and all his Papers exposed;
a-mong which ^ere found (as some say) both Truth and Treason, but so ^^nningly
Interwoven, as they could scarcely be discerned ^^om one another. However, the
Old Blade was so Criti^^^ upon his Examination, that he was judged Lunatic,
and so committed to Bedlam (not Newgate) since which, ^^ree more Aesop's have
starced up from Bath, White Hall, and Amsterdam, who all speak through the
Ass, Lion, Dog, ^Volf; Fox, Grasshopper, Ant, Owl, Bat, etc. forcing these
^armless and senseless Beasts and Animals speak those Truths which themselves
dare not own. This is all the ^ews which I hear.


WEAZEL. But among all these Brutes, I hear neither of the Monkey (...) Weazel
so much as mentioned; therefore to put a stop to the ^urther Rise of any of
these perilous bold Fellows, we'll speak for ^^r selves, otherwise they will have
a fling at us, by laying Magical ^harms upon us, to speak Treason when we think
none, which ^ill bring us into Scandal, and downright Contempt.


MONKEY. Ay, but we'll keep out of their reach, for while they ^se their
Slanderous Tongues, we'll use our Wits to a^oid them. However by the by, I Will
tell thee a Secret which ^ne of these Aesop's discovered the other Day to a
Friend of ^ine, that a -- of the Grasshoppers Gang, was to have his ^eeth drawn
very shortly, which if true, (which I don't ^uch doubt of) the poor straggling
half starved Sheep will ^ettle again, and feed upon their Old Common without
^ear; for though he may still hunt them, he cannot hurt them, and indeed he may
Bark, but not Bite 'em.


WEAZEL. This is brave News indeed; but some Aesop's say that another ^ill come
in his Room, who has Teeth as big as the former, which if so, he may bite too,
if he pleases.


MONKEY. Ay, but he is quite of another Nature, (as I am inform^^ being Mild,
Wise, Peaceable, Prudent and Charitab^^ besides, he is a great Friend to the
Dragon, therefore con^^quently of different temper from any of the Grashop^^
Society.


WEAZEL. I am glad to hear of it with all my Heart, for it is not (...)
unreasonable, but quite opposite to the order of Nature for Grasshoppers to
insult over Dragons. Well, Reverend Mr. Monk^^ since such pleasant and
desirable News as this has reached (...) Ears, (if it seems agreeable to your
Gravity) now we are (...) Tavern, we'll shake off our Beastly Nature, and
rejoice ou^ Glass of Sack, like human Creatures; for we are Branche^^ the
Creation as well as they.


MONKEY. Why, truly though I am not naturally given to Excess, (...) I was never
so precisely Nice, as to deny any Inno^^^ Diversion, especially on such a happy
occasion as thi^^ But methinks, to complete our Joy, a Loyal Drink^^ Song,
commonly called a Health, would be very seasonab^^ but I Will leave you to that,
for my Voice is very unplea^^^


WEAZEL. Indeed, Sir, I cannot boast neither, of making any Harm^^^ Sound, yet
rather than we'll lose this favorable Opportu^^ I Will do the best I can for a
Conclusion.

Here Is a Health to those Boys
That are Loyal t'th' King,
To the Dragon advancing,
Whose Praise 's we'll Sing:
He our Church now revives,
Drink about by Consent,
We shall Lead happy Lives
Can we be but Content.
Then the Glass to the Bri^^
Fill it up with all have, (...)
And in Sack let us swim; (...)
For the time it will wast, (...)
And while Grasshopper Ze^^^
Do with Envy repine, (...)
We will Cheer up our (...)
With the Juice of the V^^^

FINIS.
