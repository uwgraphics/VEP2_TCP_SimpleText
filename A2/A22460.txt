CHARLES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith, etc.
To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting.
WHEREAS We have received certain information, as well by the Ministers and
Elders of the Dutch Churches, both in parts beyond the Seas, and in Our City
of London, as by the special and earnest recommendation of Our dearest Sister,
and her Royal Consort, Our dear Brother the Prince Elector Palatine, of the
most distressed and lamentable estate of the poor exiled Ministers of the
Palatinate, their Wives and Children, who falling into the power of their
cruel enemies, have been spoiled of all their Temporal estates, and exposed
unto inexpressible miseries, and are now enforced, as Exiles, to retire and
hide themselves from the violence of their adversaries, in several Cities,
Towns, and other places, where they live in very great penury and want, most of
them having formerly had plentiful and liberal means to sustain their own
charge, and to be helpefull to others, whose cases are the more to be deplored,
for that this extremity is fallen upon them for their sincerity and constancy
in the true Religion, which We, together with them, do profess, and which
We are all bound in conscience to maintain, to the uttermost of Our powers,
whereas these religious and godly persons, being inuolued amongst many others
their Contrymen in the common calamitity, might have enjoyed their estates
and fortunes, if with other backesliders, in the times of trial, they would
have submitted themselves to the Antichristian yoke, and have renounced or
dissembled the profession of the true Religion: WE taking these things in Our
Princely consideration, and being moved with the bowels of compassion toward
them, as feeling members of the same body, whereof Christ alone is the head,
and being certainly informed, that those of the United Provinces, and diverse
other Protestants in other places, have bountifully contributed toward their
necessities, and being well assured, that all Our loving Subjects of this Our
Kingdom, who have long enjoyed the freedom of the Gospel, and have tasted
largely of the comfort thereof, will not be inferior to any, in work so full
of piety and charity toward their distressed brethren, have resolved to
commend the distressed estates of these poor souls unto charities of all the
people of this Our Realm. KNOW ye therefore, That We, of Our Princely grace,
do order and grant, that a general Collection the made of the charitable
devotions, and liberalities of all Our loving Subjects throughtout this Our
Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, in all places whatsoever, as well
within liberties as without, toward the relief and succor of the said poor
Exiles, living now dispersed and distressed in such sort, as aforesaid, which
Collection We will and command, shall be made and ordered in manner and form
following: That is to say, We first will and grant, that by the discretion of
the Lord Bishop of London, Our own Printer at Our own charge, shall
forthwith print so many Briefes of these Our Letters Patents, as shall be
sufficient to disperse them into every Church and Chapel, where public and
Divine Service is usually celebrated, in, and throughout this Our whole
Kingdom and Dominion: And that the Letters Patents themselves under Our great
Seal, be left with the said Bishop of London; that the Lord Bishop of London
do receive all these Briefes from Our Printer, that said Lord Bishop of London
shall withal speed send so many of them unto every Archbishop and Bishop
within this Realm and Dominion, as shall be requisite for every Church and
Chapel within their several Diocese to have one of them; that every
Archbishop and Bishop in every Diocese, do disperse them into every Parish
Church and Chapel, to be delivered to the Minister of that place, that the
Minister and Curate in every Church and Chapel receive them, and in the time
of Divine Service on some Sunday publish them, with an exhortation to the
stirring up of their Christian devotion to a work so full of charity, that the
Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor make diligent collection of all the
Parishioners, and persons present, that after the money shall be collected, the
sum collected be indorsed on the back of the Brief, and that it be
publicly declared unto the Congregation what that sum does amount unto,
which is there collected, that every Archbishop and Bishop do nominate in every
Deanery within his Diocese, one able and fit Minister to be the Receiver of
all the money collected within that Deanery, to whom the Churchwardens and
Ourseers, of every Parish being within that Deanery, shall within three days
after the Collection, pay over the money collected, and deliver the Brief
indorsed, receiving from him a Note under his hand of the sum so paid, that
every such Minister within six days after the receipt of the moneys within
that Deanery, pay the over to the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, or his Official,
that the Bishop of Diocese deliver or pay the same over to the hands of the
Bishop of London, within fourteen days after, that the Bishop of London, as
he shall receive any sum of one hundred pounds, or above, forthwith send
and deliver the same to the Ministers and Elders of the Dutch Congregation in
London, at their meeting in their Consistory, and receive from them a Note in
writing, under the hands of four of them at the least; that the Ministers and
Elders of the Dutch Congregation in London, on whose fidelities and honesties
in this behalf We will trust, do with all convenient speed send, or by
exchange make over the same into the parts beyond the Seas, and divide and
distribute the same unto, and amongst these poor distressed souls for their
relief and sustenance, in such manner as for their cares, faithfulness and
discretions, they will be answerable to Us for the same: And to that end, that
they keep a perfect account in writing of all their receipts, paiments, and
distributions of the said moneys, to be showed unto Us, whenever, for Our
satisfaction We shall call for the same. In witness whereof We have caused
these Our Letters to be made Patents for the space two years now next ensuing
the date hereof to continue.

Witness Our Self at Westminster, the nine and twentieth day of January, in
the third year of Our Reign.

most Excellent MAJESTY. M.DC.XXVII.
