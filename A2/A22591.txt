A Proclamation for the better ordering of those who repair to the Court for
their cure of the Disease, called, The Kings Evil.
WHereas by the grace and blessing of God, the Kings and Queens of this
Realm, by many ages past, have had the happiness, by their sacred touch and
invocation of the name of God, to cure those who are afflicted with the disease
called The Kings Evil: And his now Maiestly, in no less measure then any of
His Royal Predecessors, has bad good success therein: and in His most
gracious and pious disposition, is as ready and willing as any King or Queen
of this Realm ever was, in any thing to relieve the distresses and necessities
of His Subjects, Yet in His Princely wisdom, foreseeing that in this, (as in
all other things) Order is to be observed, and fit times are necessary to be
appointed for performing of this great work of charity; His most Excellent
Majesty does hereby publish and declare his Royal will and Pleasure to be,
That whereas herefore the usual times of presenting such persons to His
Majesty for this purpose, were Easter and Whitsontide, That from henceforth
the time shall be Easter and Michaelmas, as times more convenient, both for the
temperature of the season, and in respect of any contagion which may happen in
this near access to His Majesty's sacred Person. And His Majesty does
accordingly will and Command, that from the time of publishing this
Proclamation, none presume to repair to His Majesty's Royal Court, to be
healed of that Disease, before that Feast of Saint Maichael now next coming:
And His Majesty does further Will and Command, That all such as hereafter
shall come or repair to the Court for this purpose, shall bring with them
Certificates under the hands of the Parson, Vicar or Minister, and
Churchwardens of these several Parishes where they dwell, and under the hands
and seals of one or more Justices of the Peace for that County from whence
they come, testifying according to the truth, That they have not at any time
before been touched by the King, to the intent to be healed of that Disease.
And His Majesty does straightly charge all Justices of the Peace, Constables,
and other Officers, That they do not suffer any to pass, but such as have
such Certificates, upon pain of His Majesty's displeasure. And to the end that
all His loving Subjects may the better take knowledge of this His Majesty's
Pleasure and Command, His Will is, That this Proclamation be published and
affixed in some open place in every Market Town of this Realm, and be read in
every Church twice a year, that is to say, at Shrouetide and Bartholomewtide,
whereby the people may not pretend ignorance of His Maiefties pleasure.

Given at Our Court at Oatlands, the eight and twentieth day of July, in the
eluenth year of Our Reign.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN Bill. 1635.
