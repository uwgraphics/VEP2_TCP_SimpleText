Hastings, An ancient Port Town in Sussex. JAMES By the Grace God, King of
England* Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
TO all people to whom these our Letters Patents shall come, greeting.
WHEREAS We are credibly given to understand as well by the humble Supplication
and Petition of our true and Loyal Subjects the Mayor and Iurats of our Town
and Port of Hastings within our County of Sussex, being subscribed by our right
trusty and well beloved Counselor Edward Lord Zouch Lord Warden of our Cinque
Ports; As also by a Certificate under the hands of our right trusty and well
beloved Henry Lord Hunsdon, Sir Thomas Pelham Knight and Baronet, sir Nicholas
Parker, and sir John Wildegos Knights, Nicholas Eversfield Esquior, High
Sheriff of our Counties of Surrey and Sussex, Thomas Aynscombe, and Anthony
Apsley Esquiors, Justices of the Peace within our foresaid County of Sussex:
That our said Town of Hastinges has been and yet is the ancient Port Town of
the Cinque Ports, the which standing and being right over against the Kingdom
of France upon the maine Sea, has heretofore not only been well inhabited
with warlike people that have manfully defended themselves against the sundry
invasions and attempts of the Enemy, but also it has been plentifully
furnished with Fishermen and good Maryners, and other serviceable Seamen, and
well stored with Shipping, Barques, and Boats for service and for shipping,
from whence not only our own Household, and our City of London, with diverse
other places from time to time are plentifully furnished with Fish, but also
Our Navy Royal upon any occasion is the better appointed, by reason of the
skillful Mar^ners and cunning Seamen; But the same Town is lately very much
decayed and ympouerished for want of a Peer there to succor and defend their
shipping in foul weather, whereby has happened unto them of late years
infinite great losses both of shipping and men, and many Strangers from time to
time that sail that way have been and daily are cast away, to the undoing of
many our Subjects, and the loss of many good Seamen. For prevention whereof,
our poor subjects the Inhabitants of our said Town and Port to t^eir great
charge and ympouerishing made out a Peeere into the Sea with Timber and Rocks,
that their Ships in any storms might ride safe under the Peer, but the cost
and charge of making and repairing the same from time to time has been so
great and burdensome, that it has in a manner undone the said Town, and
driven away many of the best and wealthiest men, to seat themselves elsewhere,
so that to this day not only the said Peer for want of reparations is fallen
down and quite destroyed, but also the said Town that is seated in a place of
danger from invasion of Foreign Enemies, which heretofore has defended it
self in many assaults, is now relinquished, and for the most part unpeopled,
and the trade of fishing there decayed, all passengers that way distressed and
left destitute in stormy and tempestuous weather, and undefended against Pirates
and other Enemies. Upon Our Princely consideration whereof, and minding to
provide for the preservation of the lives of Our people, the maintenance of
shipping, and the continuance of our Towns upon the Sea coast, the in^rease of
Fishermen and Mariners, and that the provision of our Howshold, our City of
London, and Country be not diminished: And taking also into Our Princely
consideration, that our said Subjects the poor Inhabitants of Hastings, by
reason of their great charge alre^dy from time to time bestowed in repairing
the said Peer, are not able any longer, howbeit most willing, to contribute
thereto, The effecting whereof by the opinion of men experienced in those
affairs, will amount unto the Sum of Two Thousand Pounds and upwards, We have
thought good as well upon the humble Peti^ion of the said Inhabitants, as also
upon the recommendation of our foresaid right trusty and wel-beloued
Counselor, together with the humble request of all our foresaid Justices made
unto Us on their behalfes, to commend the furtherance of so needful and
laudable a work, unto the charitable and serious consideration of all our
loving and wel-disposed Subjects within certain Counties and Cities of this
our Realm hereafter mentioned: Not doubting, but that all good subjects (well
weighing with themselves the public good ensuing by this work) will be ready
and willing *and the rather for our good conmendation hereof) to extend their
liberal contributions more then in ordinary Collections, toward the finishing
of the said Peer, wherein they will declare their willingness to augment the
good and prosperity of this our Realm.

KNOW Ye therefore, that of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion, we
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents toe give and grant

sHastings for the time being, and to every other person or persons that shall
