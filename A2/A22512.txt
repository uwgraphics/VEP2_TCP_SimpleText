WHereas several Troops and Companies of Our Subjects, English and Scottish
Soldiers, lately employed in the Service of the States General of the United
Provinces, having done the duty of honest men during their said employment,
are now licenced, and return daily home; To the end they may not remain
unprofitable to themselves, and a burden to Our Cities of London and
Westminster, and other good Towns, where many of them are already arrived. We
have thought fit, and do hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure in
that behalf, strictly charging all the said Soldiers so returning, that
forthwith after the publishing of this Our Proclamation, or after their
arrival, as they shall come hereafter, they repair to their dwelling places,
if they have any, or otherwise to the Towns, Parishes, and places where they
were borne, there to bestow and employ themselves in their wonted and lawful
vocations, or in some lawful Trade or course of life, until We shall have
occasion to call them to Our Service: And to that purpose, We do charge all
Majors, Sherifes, Justices of Peace, Constables, Head-Boroughs, and all other
Our Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects, as well to assist the said
Soldiers in their Passing and Journey homewards, so long as they shall well
and peaceably behave themselves, without offense to Our Laws, or disturbance
to the rest of Our people, as also being returned to their said several
Countries, and abodes, to treat them with all charitable respects due to men,
who have faithfully served the Allies of their Prince and Country. But on the
other part, We do also make known hereby unto the said Soldiers, that if any
of them, contrary to this Proclamation, shall be found lingering and staying in
or about Our said Cities of London and Westminster, or other good Towns, not
being the place of their birth or abode, after such time as they may well take
knowledge of the publication thereof, or remain upon the way into their
several Countries or otherwise, either in Company or single, longer then is
fit for trauelling-men; Our express command is, such person or persons so
offending, shall be punished according to the Laws and Statutes in that case
provided: Whereof We do straightly charge every one, whom it does or may
concern in their several places, to take notice, and duly to observe and
perform Our Royal pleasure in the premises, at their peril.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster, the twenty seventh day of December, in
the Fifth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
