By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty upon consyderations very great, and presently importyng
the mayntenaunce of her people in peace with her neighbors, and the
conservation at home of great multitudes to be in redynesse, as naturally they
are bound to serve the state of their native country, as well in the necessary
trades of marchaundise, by sea faryng and fyshing, as in all other services
upon the seas, both with her own navy, and the rest of the navy of her
Realm, for defense of her kingdoms, countries, and good subjects: does most
strayghtly charge and command, upon pain of her high indignation and
extreme punishment, that no person of any manner of estate, shall from
henceforth either arm, victuel, or otherwise prepare with any kind of
furniture, any ship or vessel to pass to the seas, but only for manifest use
of marchaundise, or fyshing, or for usual passage of persons departing lefully
over the seas in places accustomed, neither that any Maryner, sea farying man,
or soldier, or any person under color thereof, do go, or prepare himself to
go out of the Realm, to serve in any ship or vessel of war, belongyng
either to any of her Majesty's dominions, or to any other prince, state, town,
or country foreign, except in such of her Majesty's own ships, as
already are, or shall be upon the seas, or such other as have, or shall have
authority from her Majesty, testified by her own warraunt, or by testimony
of the Lord Admiral of England in writing. And to the intent that this her
commandment may be duly kept her Majesty has wylled and charged the said
Lord Admiral, to give special commandment to al his Viceadmirals, and so her
Majesty does charge al other, enjoying lefully any particular jurisdiction
admiral in any Port or Creekes of her Realm, and all head officers of any
Ports Corporate, and likewise all officers of her custom houses, that have to
deal with viewing and searching of any ships and vessels employed for
marchaundise, that every one of these will from time to time carefully and
earnestly see to their utter most, that no pretext or color be used, in
armyng, or victuellying, or going to the seas with any furniture, but only
plainly and directly for trade of marchaundise and fishing, except it shall be
directly for her Majesty's own Navy, or for services upon the seas by the
sight of her special warraunt, or otherwise duly testifted by the Lord
Admiral of England. And as her Majesty means most sharply to punish the
offenders against this ordinance: so will she not fail, but make an example
of punishment of any officers that either wylfully or negligently shall suffer
this her commandment to be violated or deluded.

Given at her Majesty's Castle of Wyndsor, the xxviii. day of October, the
xvii. year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by Richard Judge, Printer to the Queens Maistie.
