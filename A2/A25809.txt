PLUTUS: A COMEDY Written in Greek By ARISTOPHANES, Translated by H. H. B.
Together with his Notes, and A Short Discourse upon it.

More in one hour than some in ten can preach.

Argument out of ARISTOPHANES.
CRamulus a Just man, but now grown low,
Consults the Oracle his life to mend;
Follow him first, that does before you go,
The answer is, and he your Woes shall end.
He hasts this happy guide to overtake,
Who Plutus proves, a man long blind;
He strives at home this Friend his Guest to make,
And that this common joy the World may find:
Of Esculapius he by Sacrifice
Obtains his long lost sight for to restore;
That so the Fools and Knaves, and not the Wise,
And Virtuous, hereafter should be poor.

Enter Carrion. O Jupiter! what a hard age is this to be a Servant in,
Especially to a foolish Master; if a servant shall
Give never so good Counsel, his word will not
Be taken, his Master thinks himself wiser, and so
His Family is bound to suffer with him; for it is the mischief
We are not Masters of our own bodies,
But they that buy us; and not much unlike
This Case of ours, and slavery, is that my Master is in now

Who though he be counted a great Prophet and a Physician,
Yet he has sent my Master from him sick,
And I think half mad with Melancholy,

I have heard of seeing men leading the blind,
But never of blind men leading those that can see before:

For it is that only conduces to living well.


Car. And what said Phoebus to this?


Cram. That you shall hear; he plainly told me,
That whosoever I met first, I should never
Leave him 'till I had got him into my house,
If it were possible.

Car. And this I warrant was he.


Cram. The very same.

You would use me cruelly, and not
Let me go neither.

Cram. We Will promise you the contratry, if you will speak.


Plu. Lay your hands off me then first.


Cram. Well said, it is done.


Plu. Observe me well then, since I am forced
To reveal what I thought to have kept
Secret, I am Plutus.

Cram. Then thou art the basest sordid thing alive:

Cram. But if you had your sight again, would you
Hereafter fly such base company?

Plu. For certain.


Cram. And live amongst honest men?


Plu. Without doubt, for it is a long time since I saw
Any such.

Cram. That Is no wonder, for I that have my eyesight
Scarce ever saw any.

Plu. Well, now let me go, for you know all
I can tell you.

Cram. No, by Jove, we will now rather embrace you
More Earnestly then ever.

Plu. Did not I tell you what trouble you would give me?


Cram. Let me entreat you to give your self into my hands For ever, and when
you know me, though I say it, you will Not find an honester man.


Plu. Yes, so you all say, but when you have enjoyed me And grown rich, then
you mind nothing but mischief and Malice.

Cram. And with what do men sacrifice to Jove with?
Is it not with this fellow?

Car. And what do they sacrifice for, but to get him?
For all their prayers are to be rich.

Cram. Are not you all in all then, and if you say but
The word, all this will be at an end.

Plu. How can that be?


Cram. Because no body can sacrifice Oxen or Sheep if You forbid them.


Plu. Wherefore?


Cram. Why, how can he buy any thing to sacrifice Without thee, so that you
see, if Jove be troublesome, You know what to do with him.


Plu. Is it with me and for me, say you then, that men Sacrifice?


Cram. I say so by Jove, and moreover, whatever is famous Or esteemed amongst

Plu. Gentlemen, me thinks you discourse well,
I fear but one thing.

Cram. What I prithee.


Plu. That I shall not be able to exercise all this power You give me.


Cram. I see, it is a good saying, that money is a Coward.


Plu. Nothing so, but a thief that came into my house,
Because he could carry nothing away, reported I locked
My self up, and hid my self for fear, which I did for Providence.

Cram. Well, take you no care, if you be but willing,
I Will take order you shall see as well as Lynceus.

Plu. How can you do this, being but a mortal man?


Cram. Hope well from what I haebus but now said to me, And shook his Laurel at

Plu. Have thou him of thy Counsel also.


Cram. For certain?


Plu. Have a care what you do?


Cram. Trouble not your self, I Will pawn my head, I
Know how to bring this about.

Car. And I mine too.


Cram. We will have help enough too of all those, who Because they are honest
men, scarce have bread to eat.


Plu. Those are but pitiful friends though me thinks.


Cram. They will not be so thought when we have made Them rich again; but
Carrion make have, run.


Car. What to do?


Cram. Call all my neighbors, you will find them
Perhaps busy at Plow, bid them leave off and be here
Presently, tell them every one shall have a part
Of Plutus with us.

Car. I am gone; but who will take care of this victuals Here, which I have
bought for Dinner.


Cram. Leave that to me, and now Plutus the most excellent Amongst all the
Gods, enter here with me, this is my House, which this day thou shall make rich.


Plu. I beseech you excuse me, it is very troublesome to Me to go into another
man's house, especially one that I am Not acquainted with; for I never have any
good by it; if I happen into a man's house, why then I am thrust presently Under
ground, and stifled, and if any of his friends come In necessity, and ask for
me to help him, he denies me, and Swears he saw me not of I know not how long,
And if I fall into a prodigal man's hands, why then I am Divided amongst Whores,
or lost at Dice in a moment, And so we are both turned naked out of doors.


Cram. You have not met with moderate men, I am one That on occasion can spend,
and then again spare, but pray You enter, I long till my Wife and my Son see
you, who Are two, next to thee, I love best of all the World.


Plu. That I easily believe.

Blap. What Is the danger?


Cram. It Is thus.


Blap. Speak On freely as you have begun.


Cram. If the matter hit right, we are all Made; if not, all Undone.


Blap. That Is sad, and pleases me not by no means, For to be so mavelous
rich, and so mavellously afraid is Not the custom of those that get it
honestly.


Cram. How, not honestly?


Blap. I fear. you have robbed Apollo's Temple, And now repent you.


Cram. Apollo forbid! I never did such a trick yet.


Blap. Come, never triffle with me, it is so I know.

design is to make all honest frugal men Richer then they are.


Blap. Say you so, have you stole such abundance indeed?


Cram. Will you destroy me with talking thus.


Blap. Nay, it seems you will destroy your self.


Cram. With what, I tell thee I have Plutus himself at My house.


Blap. You Plutus, what Plutus?


Cram. Why, the very god Himself.


Blap. Where is he?


Cram. Why, within there.


Blap. Where?


Cram. Why, I tell thee at my house.


Blap. Plutus in thy house, go hang thy self, I Will never Believe it.


Cram. By the gods it is true.


Blap. Will thou swear by Vesta?


Cram. And by Neptune too.


Blap. What Neptune, of the Seas?


Cram. Yes, and by the other too, if there be one.


Blap. And will you lend him now and then
To some of your friends?

Cram. Soft, yea, it is not come to that yet.


Blap. Say you so, must he not stir out of your house?


Cram. Somewhat is first to be done.


Blap. What is that?


Cram. Why, he must be helped to his sight before
He can go abroad.

Blap. Is he then blind for certain?


Cram. Nothing so Sure.


Blap. Somewhat I thought was in it, that he never
Could find the way into my house.

Cram. All in good time, he will be there now godwilling Shortly.


Blap. Were we not best get a Physician to him?


Cram. What Physician is here in this City? here is no art Understood here,

Pover. What good will it bring to men think you?


Cram. First of all, we shall throw you out of Greece.


Pover. Throw me out? why, what greater hurt can you do In the World.


Cram. Why, it would be a greater to let it alone
And not do it.

Pov. Do what you can invent.

Pov. Yet you disprove it not methinks, but wrangle, Jest and talk Idly.


Cram. Why, tell us then if thou be so excellent; Does every body fly from
thee so?


Pov. Why? because I would make them better Honester, as Children do that avoid
their Parents, because They give them good Counsel and Correction; it is a hard
Thing for any body to distinguish good from bad.


Cram. Do you think then that Jove does not distinguish? You see he is rich,
and gives it to us too as a blessing.


Pov. O ye dull Saturnine wits! why Jove himself is A beggar, and that I Will
prove to you; For if he were rich, when he institutes his Olimpick Games in
Greece, sure he would never reward the Conquerors with an Olive branch and a
large oration, But he would give them Gold.


Cram. This shows rather how Jupiter loves Gold, by his Parting with it so
sparingly; he gives away things of less Value, and keeps that for himself.


Pov. If it be so, you lay a worse fault to him then Poverty Gives any body,
having so much wealth notwithstanding To be still so greedy.


Cram. I think Jove will have cause to crown you with That Olive brance you

Car. Come Mistress, fetch some wine quickly, for I know First it is that you

Wife. Where is it?


Car. I am about to tell it you.


Wife. Dispatch in few words.


Car. Hearken well, and I will tell you all from head to foot


Wife. So it do not trouble my head, I care not.


Car. As soon as we came to the God Esculapius Carrying with us (then the most
unhappy, and now most happy) Plutus if any one were ever so, first of all threw
him into the sea Hejests here with the custom in use then for any pollution or
disease to wash in the Sea. Plato reports of Eutipides his companion in his
journey to Egypt cured so of the Falling Sickness.
and washed him well.


Wife. Would that make an old man as he is happy?
To put him into cold water?

Car. Afterward when he came before Esculapius, And had laid our Sacrifices on
the Altar, with several Musicks playing, we made Plutus lie down every one
assisting in the Ceremony.


Wife. Were there any more that sought help from Esculapius?


Car. There was one A Rhetorician in Athens, who was troubled with rheum in his
eyes.

eating behind me; At which I crept toward her, to see if I could steal some:
And at length, lifting my head a little up, I saw a Priest go round every Altar
in order, and take all the fruit and nuts, and things that was good, and put
them in his wallet; Thought I, sure there is some great Sanctity in this kind
of Theft, so I fell faster on upon the Pudding.


Wife. Thou wretched fellow, wast not thou afraid Of the God when thou did
this?


Car. Yes, I was afraid he would have come with his Robe and his (...)
Garland and gravely have stole my Pudding from me; for that his Priest had
taught me: But when the old Woman heard the noise of my chops Going, she began
to reach out her hand as she lay and feel For her Pudding, the which I had now
almost made an End off, but she feeling the pot there, thought her Pudding
Safe, and I crept away as silent as a Snake, and with my Belly full laid my
self to sleep.


Wife. And did not Esculapius yet appear to you?


Car. Not yet: but when he did come, it was my ill luck, my belly growing now
burdened with pudding to fall into such a fit of farting.


Wife. Was not that enough to make him destroy thee?

sleep any longer for joy; I all the while magnified the God that had made
Plutus see perfectly, and Neoclide's quite blind.


Wife. What a power this Esculapius has, but where is Plutus?


Car. He is coming this way with a number of honest People about him, that
formerly lived very poorly, But now Mistress Plutus shakes them all by the
hands, but Those that had got wealth unjustly he looks awry upon; But it is a
wonder to see how he makes the old fools Leap and frisk before him that can

Wom. You must know, there was a young fellow with an honest good face, but

Cram. What were they?


Wom. Why, truly he was not very importunate, only sometimes he wanted money to
buy him a Cloak, and sometimes a pair of Shoes, and sometimes his Sister and
his Mother wanted clothes, and sometimes bread.


Cram. Call you this nothing, this was love indeed.


Wom. Yes indeed, for he said he asked these things not for their value, but as
they were mine, and so wore my very shoes for my sake, and to put him in mind
of me.


Cram. This was a wonderful lover.


Wom. But now alas, his love is quite vanished, for but now I sent him
Cheescakes, and bad the messenger tell him I would see him to night.

Cram. What, is it such a long time since he saw you?


Wom. How long think you? he was with me but yesterday.


Cram. Then this man differs from all others, for the More drunk he is, the

Young. Alas, I defy you for that, I love her so it is impossible.


Cram. She accuses you though.


Young. Me, of what?


Cram. Of all manner of reproaches, and that you hit her in the teeth with that
proverb, that once the Milesii were strong.


Young. Well, you strive to win my girl from me, I see, But I will not contend
with you for her.


Cram You slight her, I see.


Young. No, I reverence her age, or else no man should carry her from me, and
so I give you joy Sir, and farewell.

ACTUS QUINTUS.
Scene I.
Enter Carrion and Mercury. Car. Who is this that makes such a noise and
knocking at door, I can see no body neither, sure the doors do not make this
noise themselves.


Mer. Stay Carrion, I say I must speak with you.


Car. O! is it you that have made all this stir?


Mer. I could have come in whither you had opened the doors or no; go take your
heels and run and call your Master and your Mistress hither presently, and all
the Servants, nay the very dog and the hog too.


Car. What Is the matter?


Mer. Jupiter has given command you should be all tied together and thrown
into the Dungeon.


Car. A blister upon thy tongue for this news, why does Jupiter threaten us so
horribly?


Mer. You have committed the greatest of all wickedness; For since Plutus began
to see, men have quite left to offer frankincense, laurel, bread, flesh, or
indeed any kind of Sacrifice.


Car. Nor never shall any more by my consent, for before this day you never
made any provision for us, or gave us a word of true Counsel.


Mer. I know not what the rest of the gods will do, but for my part I am sure I
am almost starved.


Car. Why, now you will begin to grow wise, and know the world.


Mer. Heretofore, so soon as I was up in a morning all the bawds and whores
used to bring me presents of all manner of good things, nothing was too good
for Mercury, and now I am so ill maintained I can scarce go upon my legs.


Car. Ye are right enough served, for returning evil still to those that you
have received good from.


Mer. Alas! what is now become of all those custards that used to be made
against my feast.


Car. It Is in vain to let your mouth water at those things now they are gone
and past.


Mer. O the troops of Victimes that used to be brought to my Altars!


Car. Now how will you do to dance upon the It seems it was a play at Bacchus

Mer. O the warm bowels and entrails I used to devour heretofore.


Car. You have a pain in your own guts to think on it.


Mer. What pleasantly compounded draughts I have had.


Car. If thou should taste once again of them, we should never be rid of
thee.


Mer. Stand my friend then, and help me, I am one that loves thee.


Car. If I knew how, I would.


Mer. Help me but to a little of that victuals that you are sacrificing within

Car. I dare not carry any thing out of the house.


Mer. If you steal a little out of your Masters cup their's no hurt, I Will cast
a cloud over you, that no body shall see you.


Car. You have been used ye villain I see to pardon and conceal the theft of
all those that would sacrifice half of it when they had done to you, this trick
has got you all you have.


Mer. Is not that fair to devide?


Car. Yes, but you would be loath to take part of the blows I shall have for
stealing it; if I am taken playing the thief there, you all leave us.


Mer. O do not torment me thus! now you are hapy your self, you should rather
help me to some place in the house amongst you.


Car. What, would you leave the gods for such company as ours?


Mer. Yes, for it is much a happier being.


Car. But to run away from them and your Country methinks is not so handsome.


Mer. That Is a man's Country where he can live happilest.

Mer. Any thing, I would be porter to look to the gates.

Mer. Make me a Merchant then.

Mer. Do you want a subtle man to manage your affairs?


Car. We have no need of craft neither,

FINIS.
A Short Discourse on the preceding Comedy.
THE wisdom of the world in all ages, and their precepts of life, lies wrapped
up in their Muthology, even as ours at this present is contained in the Holy
Scriptures; except that God in his mercy to us has delivered us those truths
of which they had but the the Tipes and Figures: But yet of such efficacy we
find their Fables to be, that even in the darkest Times we cannot but say, that
the soul of man had light enough to understand the bounds and rules we ought to
live within, and the end we live for: so that we may truly say, since God made
man, he never left him without such a sufficient Conduct as might well serve
his turn, till in his great grace and bounty he shall think fit to send him a
better; nor was it less then divine wisdom in him at the first to send the
weakest lights to prepare the soul of man for those great ones since delivered
unto them, and to let Gentilisme as it were usher in Christianity, that Mankind
might be prepared with the weight, form, and matter thereof, and want nothing
but the stamp of his Messiah upon him for his everlasting perfection. Now
amongst the ancient Fables, I find none that better unfolds the nature and
state of Mankind then this, which Aristophanus takes for the subject of his
Comedy; not perhaps any that comes nearer to our own sacred Scriptures Plutus,
the Tipe of Wealth and Plenty, is said by Jupiter to be deprived of his Eyes,
for aspiring to enthrone himself in his power and wisdom, that which at the
first we read threw down the Angels, and next to them him, and in him that
posterity that was created almost as happy as those Angels; so that Plutus with
his eyes open may allude to us Adam in his Innocence, his blindness our falt;
and his being brought to Esculapius his Temple to receive his sight again, may
not unfitly emble to us our seeing of a Savior to bring us into that State
again we fell from: But yet further then in this consideration, which I hope
will offend no body; we will not use comparisons, but proceed to our
intentions, which are to consider the World as it stood with Plutus his eyes
open, and as it now stands with his eyes out. The law of Nature is, that which
in all ages Philosophy has aimed to find out; for though the world stands now
upon another bottom, and we live so wholly by our own agreements, that it is
impossible to bring it into the practice of life any more, yet were it of
wonderful importance to every single man, his business in this world being
only to know himself, and his own being, to know what he was before he made
any bargains with other numbers of men, to take what principles they thought
fit to impose upon him; but certainly to find this law of our natures, which
like an old Record has lain so long in the dust, till the letters are worn
out, and the language forgot, is a thing of great difficulty, especially
considering that our senses and the faculties of the mind that flow from them,
are given us for the use of Life, and not to examine what that Life is; they
can look forth and distinguish of objects abroad, but cannot look back, and
reflect upon themselves: My Eyes teach me to see, but show me not what Seeing
is; and I Hear with my Ears, but cannot hear what Hearing is, nor indeed is
there any thing in this world can teach us by it self what it is; for if it
were not so, I cannot find what bounds could be put to Humane knowledge, the
which both by the failings in our selves, the Muthology of the Ancients, and
even our own sacred Stories, we still find for aspiring beyond its terms has
been cast into chains: The best way therefore for man to make discovery of his
own simple estate and condition, as it stood before he brought himself into
slavery, will be first to rank himself again with the rest of his fellow
creatures, in their manner of enjoying the benefits of this life, and as they
do, to reckon that divine providence out of that same earth, whence their
generation came, has likewise without their care provided nutrition to lead
our natural lives on to those terms and limits nature has set them; and hence
we see the Gospel, that was the second Covenant made with Mankind, for the
restoring him again to his simplicity of life, for illustration of the
excellency of a natural state and condition, brings the Lilly of the field,
that neither toiles or spins, to exceed Solomon in all in his glory; and
further argues that the Fowls of the Air neither sow nor reap, nor gather into
barns, and yet your heavenly Father provideth for them; and do not you much
exceed them? that is, are not you much more capable of living contentedly in
common, according to the Law of Nature, upon the fruits and benefits of the
earth, then they; for the truth is, though those words did generally relate to
the casting of Mankind upon the providence of God, and not to rely upon his own
care, yet I doubt not but all his precepts of that kind had also a respect to
that day when Christ shall come and finish the work of a second Adam, when (as
the Text says) he shall have put down all rule, and power, and authority; that
is, what ever we now call Propriety and Right, except the common natural right
of other creatures; for to the same peace that Mankind at first enjoyed we can
only be restored by being put into the same state and habit of life. Now we
find in Genesis, that the dominion given to man over the world, did not extend
further then the making of food of that which has sensitive life; I have given
you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth, and every Tree
in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for meat:
Neither was this deed of gift of the fruits of the earth more particularly to
man then his fellow creatures for in the following verse, to every Beast of all
the Earth, and to every Fowl of the Air, and to every thing that creeps upon
the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat:
Neither was this first natural estate of man unknown to many where the Holy
Scriptures never came, for the foundation of Pythagoras Philosophy we find is
the same, and has had the fortune to continue in the Eastern parts to this
day, when it could not do so with those that had it immediately from heaven;
likewise Haesiod, with a kind of divine spirit tells us, that Humane
sustenance, if there were any Humane temperance, might lie in so narrow a
compass that he should not need to put his Oxen and Mules into the yoke of
slavery, if it were not a curse that Jupiter had laid upon him for Prometheus
bold theft of fire from heaven, the knowledge of good and evil, that is, the
stating of it himself as he thought fit; for we find not that God put any
confinement to the thoughts and soul of man, to the matter of seeking good and
evil in the natural speculation into himself, or any of the creatures, that
were his companions, but on the contrary gave encouragement toward it; for we
see he had leave to call the creatures before him, and give names to them
proper to their natures and habits, and by that means to propogate the art of
Etimology in the world, that being the first principle upon which all Humane
science is built; but so soon as he came to establish his Morals, it was that
unhappy Philosophy that caused both all his own sorrow, and that of other
creatures, for our pride and self opinion first taught us to practice Tyranny
and bloodshedding over other creatures, the next thing that followed was
persecution and slavery of one another; neither did man then only learn to
destroy man, but by his example other creatures learned the same cruelty over
one another; for in the image of the state of innocence, we find it received,
that man did not fall alone, but the whole world fell with him; Cain gave an
example of murder to the next Bird or Beast that was stronger then his Brother;
and I remember it to be an observation of the ever renowned Doctor Hernii, that
those creatures that are most in society with us, learn our lust and habits of
life of us, even to such a degree that we see Dogs and Swine vary from the
appointed times of generation set by other creatures, and are at any time (as
Man is) capable of it; now when man, or a few men, by Strength or Eloquence had
subdued many, the next thing that followed, was that unhappy thing we call
Propriety, to such a part of the world as they could maintain; and here it was
the soul of man, that was born to know only the opposites of pain and
pleasure, as they were confined to his bodily Estate, grew to fix them most
unhappily upon all things without him, until his life became capable to afford
him nothing that was simple, nor is he able to enjoy any thing for fear of its
opposite, that like a terrible shadow (much longer then the substance) walks
still along with his happiness; for so soon as the names of Wealth and Poverty
were defined in the world, all manner of Appetites, like a Sea, when a Sluice is
plucked up, came in upon Mankind: True it is, one would think that the
intentions of Propriety were to keep away the notions of Poverty, till upon
second thoughts we find it impossible that men (having such unequal souls)
should ever be satisfied that they have equal parts in any division, and so
consequently desire to encroach till some where there falls out to be scarcity;
whereas in the life of man, in common right, there is no subjects; for such
passions, or if it were so, that precincts were able to preserve us from one
another, yet Ambition we see teaches us where we cannot enlarge the quantity of
our Territories, to seek still some way to improve the quality thereof, that by
that means when we cannot excel our neighbors in the extent of power, we may
make them stoop to us for ingenuity, the most dangerous and certain rule of
making slaves of one another; and this is not a little evident in the invention
of Tillage, a thing which as the state of the world now stands, is questionless
the greatest of its policies, though if we look back to the first estate of
Mankind, nothing perhaps is a greater mischief to it, for we find not bread to
be such an essential sustenance to the body of man, but that by experience it
can subsist without it; and moreover, we find not by Herodotus and Diodorus
Siculus, that in Egypt, from whence they suppose Mankind at first to have come,
but that it was of late in Custom; nor which is more, do we at this day find
that any of the most Southern Climates have a soil that will bear any of those
grains which we count our life in these Septentrion climates, subsists upon;
and therefore rather for the satisfying of the mind, then other necessity,
those that make voyages thither make some thing as like it as they can of any
thing that comes next. So that I often with my self consider it as the greatest
of our infelicities, when for this thing, and for many more that are of no
greater importance then it is, man has brought toil and labor and
consequently slavery upon his posterity, and all for the want or foresight
what necessities the scarsity of the contents of our proprieties would cast us
upon; men when they grew too many for the spot of earth they were upon having
no other way but by forcing it with seed to feed themselves; and by the eternal
providence of revolution, to turn that food again into nutriment to keep the
womb of the earth still open and prolifick to them, so that one in a homely
phrase made a good expression of Humane life, when he said, Our business was
only eating to shite, and shiting to eat. Now though we ought to receive those
curses, that it pleases God to lay upon us for our rebellions, with patience
and submission, yet sure it is a great mistake to call them Blessings, and by
that means exalt our selves from those very means that are given us for our
humiliation; for so is it with us when we admire our selves for our Arts and
Inventions, which at the best are but supports to our infirmities, dispising
innocent life wherever we hear of it with the title of Barbarism; insomuch
that I have often thought with my self, that had we now a vision of the garden
of Eden, and Adam feared in it again with all his felicity, we should, for the
poor wretch his good, desire to teach him some of our good manners and good
husbandry: But to cure our selves of this pride of spirit, I know no better an
example then the History of the Reabites Jer. chap. 35. who were Sons, or as
some interpret, Followers of Jonadab and his Philosophy; these people, as is
there expressed, lived in Tents, and by their particular laws were both
forbidden the use of Wine and Tillage; and denied so much as to come into
society with the Jews, when the Prophet pressed them to it, and yet so great a
reward God Almighty thought fit to give to their obedience to their Fathers,
and the temperance of their lives, that he promises them in the end of the
Chapter, Jonadab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. Neither is
this all the evil consequence that has followed for the altering and
dejecting the mind and soul of man from its first estate, for if we take
Tillage in its larger sense, for what ever is an unnatural and forced use of
the earth, we may then involve almost all the nutriment to which now the body
of man is habituated, and not only its nutriment, but its luxuries. And having
changed the fruits of the earth, I cannot doubt but we have therein also
changed our own bodies, and consequently making a new digestion, we have now no
longer our first natural thoughts and speculations: I think it therefore no
wonder, that in stead of a natural way of arguing and concluding, men should
take the rule of their lives from Phanatique thoughts: I wonder not at all how
I have got the notion of a Spirit, a thing that is nothing that has place, and
no dimentions, that is obvious to my sense, and yet is insensible; I wonder not
that my Faith is my greatest certainty, and that the price upon which my Soul
depends, is as the Apostle says, the evidence of things unseen; though all
this be against sense; for all this I will allow the habits of my new education
may have now made to be my nature and constitution; nor do I for this pay a
less reverence and respect to the truths of what I now am bound to believe,
that I come thus to think of them; for the truth it self of these things did
but begin with the change of Humane nature in Paradise; for the truth of our
immortality after death could not commence before we knew we should die, and
therefore not unaptly (in my opinion) have some of the best Philosophers
thought it demonstration enough for supernatural things, that we are able to
think of them, it is evidence enough that the soul is immortal, that the Soul
it self thinks so, its self; and the knowledge of it self were created
together. I know it will be urged here, Is every thing so, because I think it
so? my conception then can give reality to any thing, that has no being. I
answer to that with another question, Do I believe what I think? I believe, if
I do, I doubt not of the truth of it, for I question not to be able to remove
mountains, when I have faith enough to believe I can; but the difference in
matter of Faith, as I suppose, lies, in that it is one thing to believe a
thing, and another only to believe that we believe it, and a third only to
say we believe it for private cause or interest best known to our selves; and
for the nature of Humane Faith, we have no one more pregnant example then of
the Father in the Gospel, who saw a miracle done by our Savior upon his own
Son, and moreover received a promise that all other things that concerned his
good should as easily be effected as that, if his faith were perfect, and yet
he confessed in tears that he had belief and unbelief upon him at one time;
Lord I believe, help my unbelief. And the truth is, the state of Faith, even
amongst the most Holy, since the fall of man, has been much after this manner,
and so until the finisher of our Faith shall come, it is likely to continue:
for we see St. John, even in the midst of his sufferings for Christ in prison,
sent yet two of his Disciples with this message, Art thou he that should come,
or do we look for another? so that it is hard to say whether men themselves
know what they believe. But now to return from this little digression, with an
explanation of my self in these arguments that went before, and sought to
prove, that from natural causes or changes of food and education, man may have
fallen from his first estate and happiness; I would not from hence be thought
to disappoint God of his eternal degree, by which he has ordained through
several estates and trials to bring us to himself; but on the contrary, I do
conceive those ordinary means to have been the instruments of that decree; nor
do I doubt, but when his will and pleasure is, he may again by ordinary means,
restoring us to our first habits of life, and the Earth to her first Airs and
nutrition, bring the same Mankind back to innocense, and make the same garden
of Eden again Paradise; and an Apple from the same tree, cure the desease that
the first Apple brought into the world. The most learned Physicians of these
late times, are many of them of opinion that the venereal disease that came not
many hundred years since by contagion into the blood, and has since been
propagated with our posterity, not being a thing inherent to the fabric and
constitution of man, shall in time wear out, and the humor being spent, vanish
at length quite away, with as much wonder as it came at the first; and since
the time that I have lived in the world, which is but a short measure of a slow
revolution, I have observed a sensible decay of it, both in regard that I have
heard many say, It is not so suddenly gotten as it was, and also in that when
it is taken, the Malignity of it is now grown so weak, that every remedy that
before used to fail, is now a certain cure. Now I know no reason nor
contradiction to Holy Writ, that if a disease, that is, a piece of dissolution,
shall have this natural course and termination, why sin and mortality it self
should not have the like: nor can I, when I see the wonderful and various
effects of nutrition in our bodies, but believe the same nutrition as powerful
in our souls; when I put a piece of bread in my mouth, how many several
commissions has divine providence given unto it? there is not a part in my
little world, but it has a message to deliver to it, it not only takes care
to support my vitals and limbs, but even my excresences, my hair and nails;
and sometimes again the same morsel (like the Prophet Jonah, against its will)
is sent to destroy the City: Now, if such be the force of digestion upon the
body, how shall I think it less upon the mind of man? and though the world have
been subject to believe the stars to be the ministers of the divine spirit, in
governing of the world, yet I confess I cannot look over my head but under my
feet for those dispensations; whatever comes not imediately from the throne of
God to me, I expect to receive from his footstool the earth: And hence
methinks, by the way, we may find that it has not been altogether without
ground or reason, that some have thought that after the temporal kingdom which
our Savior shall hereafter have in this world, man's immortality shall again
begin in the same world where it first failed; St. Paul says, we shall all be
changed, and changed in a moment; or rather indeed, as it is more conformable
to the original, we shall be all reconciled; and these words do not only go
down to our graves with comfort, but likewise to those who at that day shall be
found upon the earth, for these corruptible bodies of ours are certainly as
easily reconciled to the divine will whilst they are in this world, as raised
again to glory hereafter. And here I think it is time to return again to that
which gave the occasion of this discourse, where Man in his own first nature
and his fall from it, is represented in Esculapius his restoring Plutus to his
eyes, where we with great ingenuity find expressed by Aristophanus the sudden
reconciliation of the world, insomuch that the just man changes those rags he
has so long worn with the Sycophant, for that rich attire his flattery and
lies had got him; and likewise, that after that day there was no possibility of
any longer counterfeiting the passions of the Soul, to give sorrow and pain to
our lives, and bring deceit and a false self-opinion upon others: For we see
the Old Woman in the same minute was put out of countenance, that she should at
her years expect a lover; and likewise concerning Arts, both Speculative and
Mechanic, that Want was the Inventer of them, nothing arising from the mind of
man from any principles of truth, but to make himself acceptable to those to
whom he is now become slave to so high a degree, that like dogs we are fain to
take our bread from the hands of others, and that perhaps such only as they
cannot eat themselves, either through their abundance or curiosity; and, this
men are fain to deserve, either as they can find out something for their
Masters to govern and grow powerful by, or something to entertain and pass idle
hours, when their tyranny and ambition cannot; men have not only Hands of
several Professions, but even their Souls are also of several Trades; some are
Compilers of that they call Law, some Compounders of Medicines, or rather
poison; and, which is worst of all, some are Divinity-makers, and turn often the
sacred Scripture into all fashions, the which certainly, though it be one of
the best Callings in the world, is yet one of the worst Trades; and accordingly
we find in this Comedy, when Plutus had his eyes again, how soon it was
starved: and the sport of all is, that all this which the Great ones first
invented to govern by, is now by long succession wrought into such a subtilty,
that it is grown to govern them that thought to govern by it; and sometimes
too, not only by necessity, but through real opinion of the thing it self: so
natural is it for men, first to make lies, and afterward come to believe them
themselves; the which Mountain excellently compares to Boys, that dress up one
of their companions, and black his face, to represent the Devil, to make
themselves sport; and when they have done, run away for fear of him, and forget
that it was the Idol of their own hands: Now notwithstanding that it appears
that men are so wholly cast down from their first natural estate, that our best
friends (our Senses) are no longer to be trusted, a worse condition than which
for a living creature is, sure, not to be imagined: It is wonderful to see for
all that, how that part of the world whose natures are under the bondage of
education, do despise the rest who stand free, with the title of Barbarous;
some out of an intention of charity, and others with scorn and vanity praying
for them as a lost people, wishing to have them brought home to their own
condition; not unlike to a friend of mine who^ I went to see in the Fleet once,
with intention either to devise a remedy with him, to bring him out, or at
least to comfort him against the misfortunes that had brought him thither; but,
contrary to both those intentions, he began with me, and the many conveniences
and safeties of that life, and by what arts and difficulties I was to get
thither for my everlasting preferment; And certainly, not unlike to this
confidence is that of those who would have us change the principles of Nature
for those of Education, to change our bodies when they are hardened against
wind and weather by the natural armor of our own skins, and reduce them to
such a tenderness, that the robbing of other creatures of all their clothes is
at length scarce sufficient to defend us from the cold; to bring our sensual
pleasures and appetites to such a niceness of food and diet, till it be harder
to supply their luxury for that short time of life we now enjoy, then it was in
the first age to sustain that nature which for its continuance got the name at
least of Immortality. Neither indeed, since the coming in of Propriety, the
first thing that brought want, and consequently traffic, and then war into the
world, do I find that the courages of men have been more tried to supply
necessities than they are in the ventures they have made for their luxuries:
What shall I think of him that first set upon an Oyster, and put the living
fish into his belly, scarce killing it so much as with his teeth? or, that will
eat Frogs, and trust to his judgment in knowing them from their nearest kindred
Toads, or Mushroomes whilst they are called Toad-stools; and for such
inventions as these is it for the most part that men account themselves more
civilized then others; and what is this but to set up our depraved natures to
judge and condemn that truth and simplicity we were first created in? And in
like manner, if that part of men who excel in Arts and Manufacture, shall from
thence extol themselves, and (which is now a common thing) seek conquest over
those who live happy without such inventions, because they feel no such wants,
the very argument they seek to prove their excellence by, discovers their
misery, by so much as it is a happier state of mind not to want, than to have
minds still working how to supply our wants; and therefore here with wonderful
ingenuity Aristophanus, when Plutus is restored to his eyes, finds no office
for Mercury, that before was instrumental to so many actions of Humane life: It
was proverbial in Greece of old, (...), Humane Arts brought in Humane Sorrrow.
And last of all, the strongest argument that men fetch to make conquests over
other nations, is from the necessity of communicating their speculative
Philosophy delivered by their teachers, bringing their Authority from men for
the most part both against nature and experiment, until Humane ratiocination
became nothing but agreement; not much unlike the Art of a Fencing-School,
where the Master teaches both the offensive and defensive part, so that the
Scholars are able to make a good show of learning amongst themselves, their
weapons, and their guards and motions being agreed upon; but if a Country
fellow happen to come in with a Flail, the vanity of that Art is soon
discovered, and he drives the whole School before him; and such (in my opinion)
is the end of the Schools of the Professors of Learning, when men examine their
confidence, as it were step by step, by the grounds of nature, and true
experiments, and not by their own terms and principles, except it be in such
matters as are delivered by a higher Authority than Reason, the which admits of
no discourse, but what is both to the prejudice of the things themselves, and
the destruction of Humane reason, by letting it take a habit in doubtful
principles and false conclusions: the which once got, like an ill disease that
follows us through all Aires and Climates, so does it go along with us in the
resolution of all the most important questions of our lives to our absolute
destruction: How ungodly a thing then is it for one nation or one man to press
such questions upon another as have no answer, and to impose what we our selves
have received by faith upon the reasons of such as yet by the divine assistance
are not brought further then the degree of natural men? And of this, what cruel
examples have those that are followers of the two eminent Prophets for truth
and falsehood, Christ and Mahumet, brought into the world; so unchristian-like
have been the means of late for the bringing in of Christ, that it is more then
to be feared that those that have brought salvation to others, by it have
brought perdition to themselves; so that, in the conquest over the Moors and
Indians, it is a question whether the Heathens that are saved, or the
Christians that are damned, are most in number; for what can man deserve worse
from God Almighty than in seeking for self-interest to bring in his Prophet, by
means both contrary to the Doctrine of that Prophet, and the example of the
Prophet himself: Ought we to raise war in the behalf of him who to save his own
life might have had legions of Angels to have fought for him, if he would have
prayed to his Father for them? the which, that he might not destroy the
temporal peace of a nation, he refused to do. How slow therefore ought men to
be, till they have certain revelation that they are the instruments chosen for
that purpose, in pressing the conversion of others to the doctrine of their own
Prophet! how fully convinced soever they themselves are that there is no
felicity in the life to come, but what is built and founded upon that Faith;
since, though it be fit for every true believer to have that assurance in
himself, yet is it ill done of them to make desperate conclusions of such whom
God himself sees it not yet time perhaps to require more than an universal
worship from. For, such we see his mercy has been to the ages past, that we
find in Hebrews 11. where there is a large account of all the degrees and
measures of Faith in the world, both before the Flood and a long time after,
there was a kind of faith rewarded then in such who had not received the
promises; and these were Saints of no less magnitude then Abel and Enoch: the
chief substance of whose Faith, as it is expressed in that Chapter, was, that
the world was framed by the word of God, and that things which are seen were
not made of things which do appear: Now with this Faith the Ancients, whom we
commonly call Philosophers, (and I hope were Divines, and are now Saints,) did
almost in the very words all of them concur; Antiphanus, a Disciple of
Socrates, (...), God is like to no substance, and therefore no man can express
him by any similitude or effigies. Xenophon, (...): He that with such wonder
and, terror moves the world, is notwithstanding himself, how mighty soever,
comprised within no form or substance. Dion. Cassius, (...), not within the
compass of words or eyes. Menander, (...), The knowledge of mortal man lies in
mortal, not immortal things. Act. 17.13. The inscription upon the Altar at
Athens was (...), To the unknown God; the which the Apostle thought so good a
beginning toward the true Faith, that he did not deny even those to be
worshippers of the divine Essence, offering him (whom unknown they worshipped,)
to declare to them: And many more examples of this kind might be brought, if
there were not one most pregnant example both to show the secret mercy of
Almighty God to such who heard not of the Prophets coming into the world; and
likewise to show how great a measure of Faith was possible to be in that Age;
and this is in the example of Job, who is confessed to have lived long before
there was a Jew in the world, whose faith was so great, that he not only knew
the Spirit by the which the world was made and preserved, but he likewise knew
the Spirit who intended the subversion again of it, and of that picture the
Soul, who the Almighty himself had drawn after his own original, and this so
perfectly, that he is chosen as the first example given to Mankind, how to bear
temporal losses for the glories to come. Now if there be any (as very well they
may) who think it possible that the foregoing Patriarchs had a light of the
Prophets to come, notwithstanding we cannot see they had so, let that
possibility serve for the using of those now mercifully, who live yet in the
world without them; and much more let those who are under the Faith of the same
Prophets not be so exact (as in our late days they have been) to prosecute all
the points of their faith with such confidence that every circumstace is now
thought a good ground to invade a neighbor nation, till they are reduced to
that extremity that they have no choice left but either to deliver up their
lives or their consciences; so that such a scandal is brought upon religion,
that it is thought only now to be maintained in the world for self-interest,
especially having such daily example how the Clergy (either to please the
people or the prince, and for preferment) preach up almost any thing, till the
men of sober judgment have great cause to complain that our days are like
those in the days of Moses and Aaron, and the great Idol of the world is still
the Golden Calfe. And here our Author Aristophanus, with his accustomed
excellency of fancy, concludes, that when the Priest's made is so well locked
into that they can no longer get their bread by it, he advises them to use the
same (...) and (...), and assist in the (...) (...) in stead of the Temple of
Jove, and the (...) will be as good as they were before.

FINIS.
