Somer spekyth first EVery thing of my coming is desirous
For I cause the true lovers hartis to be amerous
All birds by me / renew their songs glorious
In the shadow / under my bows grene and copious

winter Friend what be ye / that makes so great boste
Saying that you have all at will on your cost
Be you so valiau^t as ye say / and of so great bownte
That so great joy demeaneth of what contre be ye

Somer Friend why demand you of my hye estate
Of god and his mother / I am very puysant create
In so much that all the world does me great honor
I am time of somer to all creatures great pleasure

winter Somer thou do great wrong / to boste so as I trow
If thou can no answer make / to that that I would know
wherefore should the world / to the do such honor here
Fro death to life / can not thou reise the ded leyd on bear

Somer Friend and what art thou to whom I should answer
Thou art very old as thinks me go shave thy here
I trow thou art very cold for frosen is thy cote
As great a fire nedfull is for the as would make an iron hot

winter Somer / I am named winter that in to many contres
Send forth of my goods / rain frost and snowes
where so ever that I am / is found often great cold
I make rich men were furred gowns / and spend some of their gold

Somer winter loved as I am / can thou in no wise be
Through me comes good wine / and corn and good fruits great ple^te
But through the all these goodis be wasted and destroyed
Thou causest the people / suffer much woe / it can not be denied

Winter Somer if that I were not / thou sholdest be made full lene
By many a best venymus / of the which I make the clean
Of snakes / adders / and stynkynge worms and of mamy a fly
From the I make clear delyueraunce by my great curtesye

Somer Winter this that thou say / is not worth a drope of rain
Every thing reioyseth my coming and thereof is right feign
Thou causest all things to be kept in mewe
Bestis birdis and flowers / by the lose all their Joy and hew

Winter Somer thou art not beloved but of the pore and nedy
That with great pain get their living / and thereto be not spedy
They have no will to labor / in field nor in garysone
But only to spoyll of their clothes / and lowse them at thy son

Somer Winter all thy saying / is not worth a here of wull
I have the sweet nyghtyngale / that syngeth with notes full
Prayng every lover / that he to love do his pain
Who can than hold him self fro love / another fre nor vilayne

Winter Somer these plesures thou spekist of / be not profitable
I love better the good wynes / and good sweet metes upon my table
That is to me more plesaunt / agreeable and more Joyous delyght
Than songs of birds / and these lovers Joy that often be light

Somer winter I have young damsels that have their breasts white
That go to gader the fair flowers with their lovers bryghte
The which swetely kyseth them laughing merely
And than go they thens glad and gay singing Joyfully

winter I have more of my ease than thou have of delyghtes
I have my chambres made plesaunte and painted for all syghtes
There is no people in the world great nor small
Bestys and birds without nombre but be painted on the wall

Somer Wyntyr all thy desire is the belly to fill
Bett were to be in a grene herbre where one may have his will
His true love to enbrace and to kiss sweet
Than to be at the fire in chafynge of his fete

Winter Somer in this good time I have great assembles
I have burgeses and marchantes with well furred robes
Futred hose and good mantles and good cheynes of gold
For me they make a great fire to chere my bonys old

Somer Winter thou say true of god by thou accursed
Thou sellyst in to exyle my goods and moan ymburssed
All that thou lyuyst by? comes fro me wherefore I am sorry
And of thine have I nothing it makes my heart heavy

Wyntyr Somer thou vnderstondest not my deed and my reason
Thou haste good potage made with flesh of my season
As the hogs that I slay that makes the good bakon
The good brawne of my time is etyn before thy venyson

Somer Winter god send the an evil desteny
For all that comes in thy time is not worth a penny
No More than a man scholde sail over the salt flode
And ware should bring over with him nouther holsom nor good

Winter Somer men make great Joy what time I com in
For co^panyes gadareth together on the eve of saint martyn
There is another great not small but than they will drink wine
If they should lay their cote to gage to drink yt or it fine

Somer winter in the month of may when thou lurkyst in bower
I have prymeroses and dayses and the wyolet slowre
The which be for the true lover and his sweet leman
That go home syngyng and make good chere as merely as they can

Winter Somer entend what I say it is of veryte
The highest day in the year is the Natiuyte
Than be capons on the table bred wyn and clare
Many a boat is slain against that time much Joy is made and gle

Somer Winter in this time he that has naught him self for to clouth
When it rayneth and blows cold freseth and sore snouth
All the pore comyns they live in great displeser
The pore me^bres of god that have so great pain to suffer

Winter Somer thou say troth a bide we the adventure
Praynge that king / sone of the virgyn pure
That he will give us such hete after this great cold
That the pore comonalte may live in ease ever him to behold

Somer Winter by one assent / our great strife let us ceas
And togeder agree we / and make a fynall peace
God that create this world / and made both the and me
Let us pray to him to send us a good end / Amen for charity

The time present of man
The more health he has / the more he compleyneth
The more hardy he is / the more he feyneth
The more he loves / the more he payneth
The more he is believed / the more he lies
The more he has wherewith / the less he contenteth
The more he is reproved / the more he murmureth
The more hye of price / the less time abides
The more money he has / the less him sufyseth
The more vnderstonynge / the less he well shows
The more he has done amiss / the less he feryth
The more he contynueth the worsse he lives
What shall god say to him that this does
In a prince loyalete
In a clarke humylite
In a prelate sapience
In an advocate eloquence
In (...) cloth good color
In wine good sauoure
In a marchante to keep his faith
In a subject when he obeith
In a woman good countenans
This is a very good ordynans
Larges of the french men
Loyalte of the scottish men
Clenlynes of the alman
Swerynge of the norman
Cursynge of the pickarde
Hardynes of the lombarde
Sapyence of the brytton
Consyens of the burgonyon
Great boste of the beggar
All is not worth a point of lether
To tyse betymes / him self to recreate
To look well to his own / and to keep a sobre estate
Long or he ete / and not to soupe late
To ley hye with his head / and to sleep moderate
Makes man rich / long life and fortunate.
Finis
Cum priuilegio.
