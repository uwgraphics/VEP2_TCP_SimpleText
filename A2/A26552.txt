REFORMATION, According to the written Word of GOD.

Phil. 3.15, 16. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And
if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the SAME RULE,
let us mind the same thing.

A Declaration of the Elders etc. at the Savoy, October. 12. 1658. p. 27. XXIX.
Such Reforming Churches as consist of persons sound in the faith, and of
conversation becoming the Gospel, ought not to despise the Communion of each
other, so far as may consist with their own Principles respectively, though
they walk not in all things according to the same Rules of Church Order.

above the top of our joy Ps. 137.5, 6. and 122.6, 7, 8, 9.

above the other, but are one and the same, both 1. According to
Scripture-Testimonie, compare Acts 20.17. with Verse 28. and 1 Timothy 3.1, 2.
etc. Tit. 1.5. with Verse 7. And 2. According to the judgment of ancient and
learned Writers: as Ambrose, Theodoret, Hierome. Ambrose to this effect says
thus; Primi Presbyteri appellabantur Episcopi, ut recedente uno sequens
succederet, sed quia coeperant sequentes Presbyteri inveniri indigni ad
Primatus tenendos, immutata est ratio prospiciente Concilio; ut non Ordo sed
meritum crearet Episcopum, multorum sacerdotum judicio constitutum, ne indignus
temere usurparet, and esset multis scandalum. Ambr. Com. in cap. 4. ad Ephesians.
Theodoret; Presbyterum ab Episcopo (...) and (...) non d^sserre: Sed qui
Presbyter est, Episcopum dici, quatenus in uno aliquo actu, in quo a
Presbyterio electus est, praeest coetui, quia in Ecclesia nihil (...) fi^ri
debet. Theodor. lib. 4. de Fab. Haeret. Aerian. Hierome; Apud veteres iidem

unusquisque quos baptizaverat, suos esse non Christi putabat: in toto orb
decretum est ut unus de Presbyteris el^ctus caeteris superponeretur, ad quem
omnis cura Ecclesiae pertineret, ut schismatum semina tollerentur. -- Ut ergo
Presbyteri sciunt se Ecclesiae consuetudine Episcopo sibi Praeposi^o subjectos
esse: ita Episcopi noverint se, consuetudine magis quam Dominicae dispositionis
veritate, Presbyteris esse majores, and in commune debere Ecclesiam regere.

, That whereunto We have already attained, We shall walk by the same Rule, and
mind the same thing Phil. 3.16.
, both in our Preaching and practice in the Church-Assemblyes: That, so far as

IV. To give diligence (through the Lords gracious Assistance) to promote, in
every FAMILY under our spiritual care and inspection respectively, The
Exercise of Gods worship and Christian Religion in the Course of these too
much neglected FAMILY-DUTYES; (viz.) Reading of the Holy Scriptures Deuteronomy. 6.4.
to 10. and 11.18, 19. 2 Timothy 3.14, 15.

and Oversight, in all the things of Christ Rev. 2. and 3. Chapters, throughout.
Mat 2^.18, 19. Act. 20.18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27.
. Accounting all such Congregations True VISIBLE CHVRCHES of Christ, As consist
of a sufficient number of Persons, who are visible Saints, or Saints by Calling
1 Cor. 1.2. Romans 1.7. 2 Cor. 1.1. Phil. 1.1. Ephesians. 1.1. Psalm. 50.5.
, Sound in the Faith 2 Timothy 1.13. Ephesians. 4.12. to 17. Tit. 1.13. Col. 2.18, 19. 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. Tit. 3.10.
, and walking together in the fellowship of the Gospel Phil. 1.5. Acts 2.41,

8.15, 16.
Now this REFORMATION and prosperity of all such respective Congregations We
shall endeavor as follows, (viz.)

1 By Catechizing the younger and weaker sort (as we may with best convenience)
on the LORDS-DAYES Publicly in the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ Heb.
5.12, 13, 14. and 6.1, 2. 1 Cor. 3.1, 2. (...) etc. Gal. 6.6. Joh. 21.15.
,according to the Shorter or Larger Catechism, Advised by the ASSEMBLY of
DIVINES (unless some particular Brother shall think some other Catechism more
convenient for his Congregation.) That so the Fundamentals of true Christian
Religion, by one and the same Form of Sound Words 2 Timothy 1.13.
throughout the whole City and Province, may be rendered familiar both to young
and old, yea to all the members of the Congregations; May be more easily
Received, Firmly Retained, and advantagiously improved for their spiritual
benefit.

2 By encouraging the Elder sort, even all that have good knowledge and
understanding in the Mysteryes of the Gospel, together with Our selves,
Explicitly to Profess 1 Pet. 3.15. Romans 10.9, 10. Acts 24.14, 15, 16. 1 Timothy
3.15.
and declare, as occasion shall require, in some convenient way; 1. That they
acknowledge and receive all the Holy Scriptures in the Books of the Old and New
Testament, As inspired of God, and of infallible Authority, Resolving (by Gods
Grace) to Submit themselves to be ordered and guided by them, as the perfect
Rule of Faith and Life, in all things concerning their Persons, Families, and
the Church of God 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1.19, 20, 21. Psalm. 19.7. Gal.
6.10. Romans 15.4.
. 2. That they still retain that brief, but Ancient Profession, or Sum of
Christian Faith, called the APOSTLES CREED The Apostles Creed is of very
ancient use in the Churches under the N. Testament. Augustine expounds it 7
times, viz. 1. De Tempore, Sermon. 115. De traditione Symboli, p. 849. Tom. 10
Basil. 1569. 2. De Tempore Sermon. 129 p. 869 etc. Tom. 10 3. Et Sermon. 125 page
872 etc. ibid. 4. S rm. 131 De Exposit. Symboli ad C mpetentes, p. 887, 888.
Tom. 10. 5. Et de Temp. Sermon. 181, De Expositione Symboli, p. 989. Tom. 10, 6.
In Lib. de Fide and Symbolo, p. 139, ad 151, Tom. 3. 7. In Lib. 4 De Symb. ad
Catechumenos, p. 1094, ad 1139, Tom. 9. Others before Augustine also recite and
mention it etc. As Origin (...) Lib. ad init. Ruffinus Aquileiensis Presbyter,
in Exposit. apud Hieronym. in T^. 4 p. 101, ad 116. Basil. 1553 Et etiam apud
Cyprian. Tom. 3, p. 570. Sect. 20 Preux. 1593. Tertullian. de V^rginib.

p. 494. Irenaeus Advers. Haereses, Lib. 1. Cap. 2. p. 50, 51, 52. Colon. 1596.

This is called the APOSTLES CREED, 1 More Conjecturally, by some of the
Ancients, who say, It is a Tradition of the Elders; That after Christ's
Ascension, when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Apostles, enabling them to speak
all manner of Languages, that they might Preach the Gospel to all Nations,
before they departed one from another, to this work, They jointly agreed upon a
Rule of Faith, or Sum of true Doctrine, which they would Preach, and so being
altogether, and full of the Holy Ghost, they composed this Rule of Faith to be
given unto Believers. August. Sermon. 181. de Tempore, Tom. 10. and Ruffinus in
Exposit. Symbol. apud Cyprian. page 564. etc Tom 3. 2 More certainly, by Modern
writers, accounting it The APOSTLES CREED, because it is very consonant unto,
and may evidently be confirmed by the Apostles Doctrine, recorded by them in
the N. Testament.


; As being agreeable to the word of God: which Creed they have long since
Received. 3. And, That they receive and hold fast that excellent CONFESSION of
FAITH, comprised in thirty and three Chapters, and compiled by the Assembly of
Divines for these three Nations, As their own confession of Faith in all the
said Congregations, (Reserving only to some of us our liberty of Judgment
about a few expressions touching Discipline laid down in that confession): It
being, A Form of Sound Words very consonant to the Holy Scriptures; And of
special use, Both for Preserving of the Purity and Unity of the Faith amongst
us, and for Obviating of both Old and Novel Errors.

3. By manageing all the Ordinances of Gods Public Worship in the
Church-Assemblyes, As; 1. Reading of the Holy Scriptures, though Exposition be
not always added Deuteronomy. 31.9, 10, 11. Neh. 9.3. Acts 13.27. and 15 21. Rev 1.3.
; 2. Expounding, or giving the Sense of the Scriptures Read Neh 8.1, 2, 3, 4,
8, 13. Luke 4.17. to 22, etc. Acts 8.32. to 36.
; 3. Preaching the Word 2 Timothy 4.1, 2. 1 Cor. 1.17. Luke 9.2. Ephesians. 3.8. 1 Timothy
3.2. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Tit. 3.9.
; 4. Catechizing in the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ Heb. 5.12, 13, 14.
and 6.1, 2. 1 Cor. 3.1, 2. Gal. 6.6. Joh 21.15.
; 5. Prayer Acts 6 2, 4. and 20.36. 1 Timothy 2.1, 2, 3. Jam. 5.14, 15. 1 Cor 11
4, 5.
; 6. Singing of Psalms Matthew. 26.20, 30 Col. 3.16. Ephesians. 5.19 (1 Cor. 11.4, 5
Prophesying, by some is interpreted to intend Singing of Psalms; compare 1 Chronicles. 25 1, 2, 3) 1 Cor. 14.15.
; 7. Administration of Baptism, and of the Lords Supper Matthew. 28 18 19 Acts
2.38, 39 and 8.36, 37, 38, 39. and 10.47, 48. and 16.30, 31, 32, 33 1 Cor. 1.16
Col 2 11, 12. Romans 4 11, 12. 1 Cor. 11 17. to the end of the Chap. and 10.15,
16, 17. Acts 20.7. and 2 41.42.
; 8 And Blessing of the People in the name of the LORD Numb. 6.23, 24, 25, 26.
and Deuteronomy. 10.8. compared with Rev. 1.4, 5. 2. Cor. 13.14. Ephesians. 1.2.
; As near as possibly we can to the unerring Standard of Gods Word 2 Timothy 3.16,
17. 1 Cor. 11.23.
. Baptizing the Children Compare Genesis 7.7. to 15. with Acts 2.38, 39 Col. 2.11,
12. Matthew. 28.18, 19 Acts 16 30, 31, 32, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16. Mark 10.13, 14
of all such as are Members of true visible Churches of Christ, above
described. And taking an especial heed to the due and Regular Dispensation of
the Lord's Supper, which the Apostle sufficiently intimates to be a Barred
Ordinance 1 Cor. 11.28, 29, 30. and 10 21.
: whence Unbelievers and Unregenerate persons, so remaining, can reap no saving
Benefit, but Judgment to themselves 1 Cor. 10.1. to 12. and 11.27, 28, 29, 30.
; And whereunto Persons grossly Ignorant and Scandalous, either by customary or
ordinary Omission of those known Duties of Christianity, Sanctification of the
Lords-Dayes, and Religious courses in Families; Or by Commission of any
Scandalous Sin, Ought not to be admitted 1 Cor. 11.27. to the end, compared
with Matthew. 7.6. and 1 Cor. 5. throughout, and Jude 23. 1 Timothy 5.22.
. But only such visible Saints, as having a competent knowledge of the
misteryes of Christian Religion, and making an Holy profession of Repentance
from dead Works, Faith in Christ, and Obedience to him, according to the
Gospel-Rule of Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, do (in the Judgment of
charity) walk answerably 1 Cor. 11.29, 21, 21. compared with 2 Cor. 2.7.
. And in order hereunto, We consent and agree, That the knowledge and
conversations of all such as desire admission to the Lord's Supper be first duly
enquired into, and found suitable to that Ordinance Compare 1 Cor. 11.29 with
Gal 6.6 Matthew. 28.29. Compare also 1 Cor. 11 27. to the end, with Matthew. 7.6.
and 1 Cor. 5. throughout, and Jude 23. and 1 Timothy 5 22 and Ephesians. 5.11. and Acts
9.26. to 32.
. And if any person or persons after such Admission shall break out into
Scandalous Sin, and thereof be convicted by 2 or 3 witnesses, or their own
confession; That in this case, such shall by due Censure be secluded from the
Lord's Supper Matthew. 18.15. to 21. 1 Cor. 5. throughout. Ezekiel. 22.26. and 44.23.
Matt. 7.6
: Unless the Offense be discovered so immediately before the Lord's Supper, that
the Minister dissatisfyed in conscience can, for the present, only suspend his
own Act. And utterly laying aside the Antiquated Service Book for the many
Evils and Inexpediencyes thereof See, The Preface to the DIRECTORY for Gods
public Worship. Read also, The Anatomy of the Service Book.
, We shall have an eye to the Substance, Sense, and Scope of the DIRECTORY for
Gods Public Worship Published for the use and benefit of these three Nations,
January, 3. Anno Dom. 1644.
.

4. By Exciting Christians to the frequent and fruitful Exercise of the more
Private COMMUNION of SAINTS in all the mutual duties thereof Mal. 3.16, 17.
Psalm 55.14. Heb. 10.24, 25. and 3.12, 13. Phil. 2.1, 2, 3, 4.
; upon all occasions: And more especially at their Private meetings and
conferences, managed in the most prudent, orderly, and profitable way 1 Cor.
14.26, 40.
, for their mutual Edification in Faith and Love, and Provocation to all good
Works Romans 14.19. 1 These. 5.11. Jude v. 20. Ephesians 4.16. Heb. 10.24.
.

5. By Endeavoring to restore into all the respective Congregations under our
spiritual charge within this City and Province that CHVRCH-GOVERNMENT and
Discipline, which Jesus Christ has appointed in his Holy Scriptures. And
herein we declare our consent and agreement, as follows;

(1.) That the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Head of the Church, and is
Faithful in the House of God as Moses was, has declared and Revealed the whole
Pattern of his House, by setting down and leaving upon Record in the Scriptures,
a complete and perfect Platform of Church Discipline in all the Essential parts
thereof Isa. 9.6. Mat 28.18, etc. Ephesians. 5.23. and 1.22, 23. Heb 3.5, 6. Exodus 25
40. 1 Timothy 3 14, 15.
, Which is to be observed and kept inviolably till the second coming and
Appearing of Christ 1 Timothy 6.13.
, without any Additions or Inventions of men Matthew. 15 9.
.

(2) That the holy Government and Discipline, which Christ has appointed in
his Church Requires not only Christian watchfulness over the Walking of
Brethren Acts 20.28.
, but also, 1. That such as Sin and go astray be Admonished and Reprooved Gal.
6 1. Mat. 5 23, 24. and 18 15 to 21.
; 2. And impenitent Sinners cast forth and Excommunicated Mat. 18.15, 16, 17
etc. 1 Cor 5. throughout ^ These 3.6, 14.
3. Who ought a so upon R pentance to be Restored and Received again into
communion with the Church 2 Cor. 2 6. to 12 Matthew. 18 18 19, 20.
.

(3.) That the End and use of Church Di cipline and Censures, is, 1. For the
Reclaiming and Gaining of Offending Brethren Matthew. 18.15 16, 17. 1 Cor. 5.5.
Tim. 1.20.
; 2. For the Preventing and Deterring of others from the like Offenses 1 Timothy
5.20.
; 3. For Purging out of that Leaven which migh infect the wh le Lump 1 Cor.
5.6, 7.8, 13.
; 4. For vindicating the Honor of Christ, and the Holy Profession of the
Gospel 1 Cor. 5 7* 8. Jude ver 23. Matthew. 7 6.
; And 5. For Preventing the Wrath of God which might justly fall upon the
Church, if they should suffer his Covenant and the Seals thereof to be Profaned
by notorious and obstinate Offenders 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. This
whole Paragraph is borrowed from the Assembly's Confession of Faith, Chap. 30.
111.
.

(4) That the Ordinary and standing Officers, which Christ has appointed in
his Church, for the Edifying and perfecting of his Body, are; Pastors and
Teachers Ephesians. 4.11. Romans 12.7, 8.
, Ruling-Elders Romans 12.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Timothy 5.17.
and Deacons Acts 6 1. to 7. Phil. 1.1. 1 Timothy 3.8 to 13


(5.) That the Work and Duty of the Pastor and Teacher, is; To attend upon the
Ministry of the Word and Prayer Acts 6.1, 2.
, To Preach the Gospel 1 Cor. 1.17. 2 Timothy 4. 1, 2. Tit: 2.7, 8.
. To Teach and to Exhort Romans 12.6, 7, 8. Matthew. 28.19, 20 1 Timothy 4 11 2 Timothy
4.2.
, and thence they are called Ministers of the Gospel Rom 15.16. 2 Cor. 3.6.
; And To Administer the Seals of the Covenant Matthew 28.19, 20 Mark 16.15, 16. 1
Cor. 11 23 24 25 with 10 16.
; As also To Rule the Flock over which the Holy Ghost has made them Overseers
1 Timothy 5.17. 1 These. 5.12. Heb. 13.7, 17 Acts 20.28.
.

(6.) That the Work of the Ruling-Elders is to join with the Pastor and Teacher
in Governing the Church Rom 12 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12 28. 1 Timothy 5 17.
. The Work of the Deacons is, concerning the Temporal good things of the
Church, To receive the Church Treasury, and therewith to serve Tables, and
particularly to Relieve the Poor Acts 6.1, 2, 3, 4. Romans 12.8 1 Cor. 12.28
.

(7.) That these Officers are called by Christ himself Heb. 5.14.
, though not immediately Gal 1.1.
But by Men Acts 13.1, 2, 3. 1 Timothy 4.14. Acts 14.23 and 6.3, 4, 5, 6.
. Neither are any to be chosen and approved, but such as are judged to be
fitted and furnished by Christ with suitable Qualifications for the faithful
discharge of the Work and Office committed to them 1 Timothy 3.1. to 14. with
5.22. Tit. 1.5. to 10. Acts 6.3. 1 Romans 13.1,
.

(8.) That the Solemn admission and Separation of Persons to the work of the
Ministry, is to be performed by the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery
with Fasting and Prayer 3. 1 Timothy 4.14. Acts 14.23. and 6.3, 6.
. And it seems to us most fit (where it may conveniently be) that such persons
be Ordained in the presence, and with the consent of the Congregation, where
they are to Minister Acts 14.23. Tit. 1.5.
.

(9.) That it is the duty of all the Churches and Ministers of Christ to Assist,
Own, and Strengthen the Hands of each other in the ways of the LORD Gal. 1.18,
21, 22, 23, 24. and 2 9.
, And to Receive each other in the LORD to Christian and Church Communion Romans
16.1, 2.
; And to meet together in SYNODS and Assemblyes of the Officers and Delegates
of the Churches, if need require Acts 15.1. to 36.
: Where they have power to Determine Difficulties and Controversies according
to the word of God Acts 16.6. to 36. Especially see ver. 24, 28. and 16.4, 5.
.

(10.) That there be many gracious Promises of the special Blessing and
Presence of Christ in his Ordinances among his People, who walk together, in
the Faith, Love, and Order of the Gospel Exodus 20.24. 1 Kin. 8.28, 29, 30. with
9.3. Isa. 4.5, 6. Matthew. 18.18, 19, 20. and 28.19, 20.
. And therefore those, that pretend to be above Ordinances; Or that live
without Ordinances, when they have opportunity of Enjoying them; Or that pick
and choose among the Ordinances of Christ, (As, to desire Baptism for their
Children, but never to desire the Lord's Supper for themselves; Or to desire the
Sacraments, but to refuse and cast off the Yoke of Christ in
Church Discipline,) they do exceedingly wrong their own Souls, and Sin against
their own comforts, by depriving themselves of that special Blessed Presence
and Sweet communion with Christ, which is to be had in the communion of Saints
Song. 1.7, 8. and 4 16. and 5 1. 2 Cor. 6.16, 17. 1 Cor. 10.16, 17.
.

VI. To enter into and walk together in a Brotherly ASSOCIATION one with
another, Giving one to another the right hands of Fellowship, in a constant
course of Mutual Advice, Encouragement and Assistance, for the more Effectual
accomplishing of these excellent Necessary and Difficult things Gal. 2.9. Luke
10.1. Acts 2.1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and 3.1. etc. and 5.29. and 6.2. etc. and 8.14.
etc. and 13.1, 2, 3, 4. and 15.6. to 36.
: That all our ways in Christ may be for Substance the same within all these
Churches 1 Cor. 4.17. Jer. 32.39.
. For a much as the mystical Body, the Church of Christ, is but one 1 Cor.
12.12, 13, to the end. Romans 15.4, 5. Ephesians. 2.16. and 4.4. Col. 3.15. Song. 6.9.
: therefore we ought to maintain all possible oneness together, Dispatching
our work, as much as may be, in joint Union and Communion, in all the Public
Affairs of Christian Religion; Thus endeavoring to keep the Unity of the
Spirit in the Bond of Peace in that one Church-Body Ephesians. 4.1. to 6. 1 Cor. 1.10
Phil. 2.1. to 5
, Now to this end We consent and Agree,

1. That We shall diligently frequent certain Meetings; More General, of the
Brethren in this whole Province; And more Particular, of those in some
Countyes and parts of this Province, As often, and in such Places as We shall
from time to time judge needful and expedient. And We shall endeavor so to
make known the Times and Places of our Meetings, that all the Godly Brethren of
the Ministry within the said Precincts may have Opportunity of Convening, and
(which we earnestly desire) of Associating with us.

2. That We shall readily Receive into this Fellowship, as Members, All the
Brethren within the said City and Province, who are duly called into the
Ministry by Ordination 1 Timothy 4 14. and 5.22. Acts 13.1, 2, 3. and 14.23. Titus

Jer. 23.28. 2 Cor. 2.17. 2 Timothy 4.1, 2. Tit. 2.7, 8.
: They first tendering to the Moderator for the time being, At some General
Meeting, or at some Particular Meeting according to Direction from the General,
A TESTIMONIAL of Their Soundness in the Faith, Blamelesness of Life, and
Laboriousness in the Ministry, under the Hands of two Ministers of known
integrity, especially of those that are Associated; And of two or three Godly
Christians of the same Congregation, or of the vicinity, well known to some of
the Associated Brethren. And all that shall be Ordained PRESBYTERS by this
Association for any Ministerial charge within this Province, shall thereupon be
Received as Members of this Association: Both these, and the former Sub cribing
to this our Agreement. Nevertheless the Associated Brethren still Reserve to
themselves a Liberty for Admitting any Orthodox Godly Brother, Declaring his in

Prayer, for the LORD'S Assistance, Blessing and Acceptance 1 Timothy 2.8. and
4.4.5 1 These. 5.17, 18. Ephesians 6.18, 19, 20. Acts 6.2.
. And at the close of that, and every such Conference, General or Particular,
We shall still determine upon the Subject Matter, Time, Place, and another
Moderator for the next Meeting.

4. That also at our first General Meeting one of the Brethren Associated,
which shall be deemed fittest, shall be chosen Scribe or Register. Who shall
enter this Our Agreement into a Book forthwith, that it may be Subscribed;

, Keeping safe their Testimonials, and Providing all such Instruments in
Writing as are requisite thereunto: That any of these may be produced before
the Brethren upon all just Occasions.

5. That no discourses about Admission or Non-Admission of any Minister into
this Society shall be blazed abroad by any Brother to the Prejudice of the
Association, or of any Member thereof.

6 Th t all Disputes about lesser Points in difference, held by any Brethren
Agreeing in the Main, be wholly declined in all our Meetings Acts 15.37, 38, 39.
Phil. 2.1.2, 3, 4. and 3.16
. Unless some Brother shall Conscientiously desire satisfaction from the
Association in any such Particular: which shall be endeavored with all
cleerness of Argument and sweetness of Spirit Acts 15.7. to 22. Ephesians. 4.1, 2, 3,
etc. 1 Pet. 3.8. Phil. 2 1, 2, 3, 4.

Association be utterly disclaimed, abandoned and abhorred Mat. 23.11, 12. Mark
9.33. to 38. Luke 9.46.47, 48. and 22 24. to 28. 1 Pet. 5.3. 3 John v. 9, 10.


8. That All giving of just Offense to those that are in Power and Authority
over us in the Commonwealth, by our intermedling beyond the Duty and limits of
our calling with civil and Commonwealth-Affairs, be most studiously avoided in
all our Transactions Matt. 17.27. 1 Cor. 10.32. 2 Cor. 6.3. Acts 24 16. 1 Cor.
7.20.
.

9. And finally, That We shall none of us withdraw ourselves from this
Brotherly Fellowship, without great and weighty causes: Nor shall We at any
time Neglect or forbear to come to the General or Particular Meetings, which
shall be from time to time appointed, without very urgent occasions.

And in all these things, We whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, have
Unanimously agreed, To walk by the same Rule, and to mind the same thing Phil.

improvement of each others Advice and Assistance, that our Hearts may be
comforted being knit together in Love, whilst we are following the things which
make for Peace and wherewith We may Edify one another in Our most Holy Faith 1
These. 3.2. Philem. 24. Col. 2.2. Romans 14.19. Jude, verse. 20.
