By the Queen,
Whereas the Queen's Majesty upon the earnest intention that she always had and
yet has, to mainteyne the good and ancient amity betwixt her Majesty and
the king of Spain her good brother, their countries and subjects, did by her
proclamation in September last past, strayghtly command all her Subjects,
tradyng the Seas either for fyshyng or marchaundize, to use their accustomed
manner without any trouble of the said king of Spaynes subjects, and also in
cases needful, to defend them against the French, whereof did follow specially
during the time of the herryng fishing, great quietness and singular commodity
to the subjects of the said king, specially to them of the low countries, as
her Majesty has been certaynlye enfourmed, and is thereof glad. Yet since
that time, sundry of the said kings subjects for private lucre, abusyng her
Majesty's good intention notified in the said proclamation, have sought to
color the goods and marchaundize of the French, being her Majesty's enemies,
both coming out, and passing into France, as apparently has been proved in
sundry causes duelye examined and tried, and remaynyng to be showed. In respect
whereof certain of her Majesty's subjects, which according to their duties be
armed upon the Seas, to offend the French being enemies, have been more
curious toward some of the said king of Spaynes subjects, in searchyng of
the said deceiptes of coloring of the French goods, and thereupon of late,
sundry complayntes have been made by certain of the said Kings subjects,
that certain English men of war, being upon the Seas, have molested them,
and in some part spoiled them. Whereof her Majesty has upon continuance of
her former intention toward the mainteinance of good amity with her said
good brother the king of Spain and his subjects, appointed special
commissioners of trust, to have an extraordinary power and authority, to
hear, and spedely to determine and redress all such complaints, without
delay of process, and with more celeritie then is administered to any of her
own natural subjects. In which proceeding, although her Majesty
understands, that her said good brothers subjects receive much
satisfaction: yet for that the number of her subjects and ships of war,
that are presently upon the Seas, and are lykely to go to the Seas this spryng,
to the offense of the French, are so great and many, and of so diverse port
towns and countries, as it appears very hard, how a good account may be
made, of every of them being so many, specially considering the daily coloring
of the French wares by the said kings subjects increases manifestly.
Therefore her Majesty still persistyng in her former favor toward her said
good brothers subjects, and to withstand all disorders against her other
friends, has for some more surety toward them, thought meet by advise of
her counsel, to provide as follows, which is as much as can be devised.
First, her Majesty strayghtly charge and commands all manner her
subjects, that shall perceive either on the Seas, or in any Port, Haven, or
Creke of this Realm, or in the Realm of Irelande, any person that may be
suspected by any lykely mean, to have hurt or endamaged any subject of the
king of Spaynes, or that shall have any goods or marchaundize, that shall seem
to have been taken from any of the said kings subjects, during these wars
with France, that they and every of them, shall employe them selves to the
best of their power, to apprehende, or cause to be apprehended, the persons so
suspected to have offended: for the which their doings, they shall have
convenient reward. And if any ship shall come into any Port, whereof there
shall be any suspicion, that the owners or occupyers thereof have dammaged any of
the said kings subjects: the Uiseadmirall of that coast, or the Mayor, or
other head officer there, in the absence of the Uiseadmirall, shall cause the
said vessel, and the persons therein suspected, to be stayed, upon pain if
they shall be therein negligent, to be punyshed as abbettours to the offenders,
and thereof, and of the proves or causes of suspicion, shall immediatlye give
knowledge to the Commissioners appointed for those causes of depredations, that
immediate order be taken for trial of the fact, according to the tenor of
their commission.

Furthermore her Majesty wylleth and commands, that no ship or vessel
armed for the war, that shall come into any Port or Creke of this Realm,
after the publication hereof, shall be suffered to depart or return to the Seas,
until the owner, captain, master, or such persons as have to command the
said ship or vessel, shall give good assurance by sufficient sureties to the
Uiseadmirall of the coast, or if he shall not be redyly found, then to the
principal officer of the Port, where the ship or vessel shall be, or otherwise
as the court of thadmiraltie shall prescribe, and think meet in those cases,
that they shall be aunswerable in form of Justice, to satisfy such complayntes
and informations, as be, or shall be exhibited against them, for spoylyng and
offendyng the subjects of the said King of Spain, or of any other nation
being in amity with her Majesty. And if the parties can not, or will not give
such assurance: then the ships shall not be suffered to depart to the Seas,
but knowledge shall be given thereof to the foresaid Commissioners. And if the
parties refusyng to give assurance of sufficient sureties, shall seem to be
suspected that they have not behaved them selves well toward her Majesty's
friends, they shall also be stayed, until the foresaid Commissioners shall
determine thereof.

And because of late some complayntes have been made by certain Scottysh men in
generality, against some English men of war, for evil vsyng of them upon
the Seas, wherein particular orders are already given for trial and redress of
the same: Her Majesty wylleth, that such care be had of the well vsyng of the
subjects of her good sister the Queen of Scotes, as the great amity betwixt
their two Majesty's, and their countries and people, does necessaryly require.
For that her Majesty would have nothing omitted on her part, that might
conserve, and increase the same.

Yeuen at her Majesty's Castle of Windsor the.xviii. day of February, in the
sixth year of her highness reign. 1563.

God save the Queen.
