SIR,
I Have not thus long forborne to invite you with these under your command to a
submission to his Majesty's authority in me, and a conjunction with me in the
ways of his service out of any the least aversion I had to you or any of them,
or out of any dis-esteem I had to your power to advance or impede the same, but
out of my fear, whiles those that have of late usurped power over the Subjects
of England held forth the least colorable shadow of moderation in their
intentions toward the settlement of Church or State, and that in some
tolerable way with relation to Religion, the interest of the King and Crown,
the freedom of Parliament, the Liberties of the subject, any addresses from me
proposing the withdrawing of that party from those thus professing, from whom
they have received some, and expected further support, would have been but
coldly received, and any determination thereupon deferred in hope and
expectation of the forementioned settlement, or that you your self, who
certainly have not wanted aforesight of the sad confusion now covering the face
of England, would have declared with me, the Lord Inchequeen, and the
Protestant Army in Munster in prevention thereof, yet my fear was it would have
been as difficult for you to have carried with you the main body of of the
Army under your command (not so clear sighted as your self) as it would have
been dangerous to you, and those with you well inclined, to have attempted it
without them, but now that the mask of hypocrisy, by which the Independent
Army has ensnared and enslaved all estates and degrees of men is laid aside,
now that barefaced, they evidently appear to be the subverters of true
religion, and to be the protectors and inviters, not only of all false ones,
but of irreligion and Atheism, now that they have barbarously and inhumanely
laid violent, sacrilegious hands upon, and murdered Gods anointed, and our
King, not as heretofore some Patricides have done to make room for some
usurper, but in a way plainly manifesting their intentions to change the
Monarchy of England into Anarchy, unless their aim be first to constitute an
elective Kingdom, and Crumwell or some such John of Leiden being elected, then
by the same force, by which they have thus far compassed their ends to
establish a perfect Turklsh tyranny; now that of the three estates of King,
Lords and Commons, whereof in all ages, Parliaments have consisted, there
remains only a small number, and they the dregs and scum of the House of
Commons, picked and awed by the Army, a wicked remnant left for no other end;
then yet further, if it be possible to delude the people with the name of a
Parliament: The King being murdered, the Lords and the rest of the Commons,
being by unheard of violence, at several times forced from the Houses and some
imprisoned. And now that there remains no other liberty in the subject but to
profess blasphemous opinions, to revile and tread underfoot Magistracy, to
murder Magistrates, and oppress and undo all that are not like minded with
them. Now I say, that I cannot doubt but that you, and all with you under your
command will take this opportunity to act and declare against so monstrous and
unparaleld a rebellion, and that you and they will cheerfully acknowledge, and
faithfully serve and obey our gracious King Charles the second undoubted heir
of his Father Crown and Virtues; under whose right and conduct we may by Gods
assistance restore Protestant Religion to purity, and therein settle it,
Parliaments to their freedom, good laws to their force, and our
fellow subjects to their just liberties, wherein how glorious and blessed a
thing it will be, to be so considerablie isntrumental, as you may now make
your self, I leave to you now to consider. And though I conceive there are not
any motives relating to some particular interest to be mentioned after these so
weighty considerations, which are such as the world has not been at any time
furnished with, yet I hold it my part to assure you, that as there is nothing
you can reasonably propose for the safety, satisfaction or advantage of your
self, or of any that shall adhear to you in what I desire, that I shall not to
the uttermost of my power provide for, so there is nothing I would, nor shall
more industriously avoid, then those necessities arising from my duty to God
and man, that may by your rejecting this offer force me to be a sad instrument
of shedding English blood, which in such case must on both sides happen. If
their overture find place with you, as I earnestly wish it may, let me know
with what possible speed you can, and if you please by the bearer in what way
you desire, it should be drawn on to a conclusion. For in that, as well as in
the substance you shall find all ready compliance from me that desire to be

Your affectionate friend to serve you, ORMOND.
Carrick March 9. 1648. For Colonel Michael Jones Governor of Dublin.

My Lord,
YOur Lordships of the ninth, I received the twelfth instant, and therein have
I your Lordships invitation to a conjunction with your self (I suppose) as Lord
lieutenant of Ireland, and with others now united with the Irish, and with the
Irish themselves also.

As I understand not how your Lordship should be invested with that power
pretended, so am I very well assured, That it is not in the power of any
without the Parliament of England to give and assure pardon to those bloody
Rebels, as by the Act to that end passed may appear more fully. I am also well
assured that the Parliament of England would never assent to such a Peace (such
as is that your Lordships with the Rebels) wherein is little or no provision
made either for the Protestants or the Protestant Religion Nor can I understand
how the Protestant Religion should be settled and restored to its purity by an
Army of Papists, or the Protestant interests maintained by those very enemies
by whom they have been spoiled and there slaughtered: And very evident it is
that both the Protestants and Protestant Religion are in that your Lordships
Treaty, left as in the power of the Rebels to be by them born down, and rooted
out at pleasure.

As for that consideration by your Lordship offered of the present and late
proceedings in England, I see not how it may be a sufficient motive to me (or
any other in like trust for the Parliament of England in the service of this
Kingdom) to join with those Rebels upon any the pretenses in that your
Lordships letter mentioned, for therein were there a manifest betraying that
trust reposed in me in disserting the service and work committed to me in
joining with those I should oppose, and in opposing whom I am obliged to serve.

Neither conceive I it any part of my work and care to take notice of any
whatsoever proceedings of State foreign, to my charge and trust here,
especially, they being found hereunto apparently destructive.

Most certain it is, and former ages have approved it, that the intermedling of
Governors and parties in this Kingdom, with sidings and parties in England,
have been the very betraying of this kingdom to the Irish, whiles the British
forces here had bin thereupon called off, and the place therein laid open, and
as it were given up to the common enemy.

It is what your Lordship might have observed in your former Treaty with the
Rebels, that upon your Lordships thereupon withdrawing, and sending hence into
England the most considerable part of the English army then commanded by you;
thereby was the remaining British party, not long after over-poured, and your
quarters by the Irish overrun to the gates of Dublin, your self also reduced
to that low condition, as to be besieged in this very City (the Metropolis and
princpall cittadell of the Kingdom) and that by those very Rebels, who till
then could never stand before you; and what the end has bin of that party,
also, so sent by your Lordship into England, (although the flower and strength
of the English army here both officers and soldiers) has bin very observable.

And how much the dangers are at present (more then in former ages) of
hazarding the English interest in this Kingdom, by sending any parties hence
into any other Kingdom upon any pretenses whatsoever is very apparent, as in
the generality of the Rebellion, now more then formerly; So considering your
Lordships present conclusions with, and concessions to the Rebels, wherein they
are allowed the continued possession of all the cities, forts, and places of
strength, whereof they stood possessed at the time of their Treaty with your
Lordship, and that theyare to have a standing force (if I well remember of
15000 foot, and 2500 horse (all of their own party officers and soldiers) and
they (with the whole kingdom) to be regulated by a Major party of Irish
Trustees chosen by the Rebels themselves, as persons for their interests and
ends to be by them confided in, without whom nothing is to be acted. Therein I
cannot but mind your Lordship of what has been sometimes by your self
delivered, as your sense in this particular; that the English interest in
Ireland must be preserved by the English, and not by Irish, and upon that
ground (if I be not deceived) did your Lordship then capitulate with the
Parliament of England, from which clear principle I am sorry to see your
Lordship now receding.

As to that by your Lordship menaced us here, of blood and force, if dissenting
from your Lordships ways and designs, for my particular I shall (my Lord)
much rather choose to suffer in so doing (for therein shall I do what is
becoming and answerable to my trust) then to purchase my self on the contrary
the ignominious brand of perfidie, by any allurements of whatsoever advantages
offered me.

But very confident I am, of the same divine power which has still followed me
in this work, and will still folllow me; and in that trust doubt I nothing of
thus giving your Lordship plainly this my resolution in that particular, So I
remain,

Dublin March 14. 1648. Your Lordships humble servant, Signed Mic: Jones.
For the Lord of Ormond these.

By the Lord Lieutenant General of Ireland.
Ormond,

WHereas our late Sovereign King Charles of happy memory has bin lately by a
party of his rebellious Subjects of England most traitorously, maliciously, and
inhumanely put to death and murdered; and forasmuch as his Majesty that now
is, Charles by the grace of God King of England, Scotlana, France and Ireland,
is son and heir of his said late Majesty, and therefore by the Laws of the
Land, of force, and practiced in all ages, is to inherit. We therefore in
discharge of the duty we owe unto God, our allegiance and loyalty to our
Sovereign, holding it fit him so to proclaim in and through this his Majesty's
Kingdom, do by this our present proclamation declare and manifest to the
world, that Charles the second, son and heir of our late Sovereign King Charles
the first of happy memory, is, by the grace of God the undoubted King of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.

Given at Carrick Febr. 26. 1648. God save the King.

A NECESSARY REPRESENTATION of the present evils, and eminent dangers to
Religion, Laws, and Liberties, arising from the late, and present practices of
the Sectarian party in England: together with an Exhortation to duties relating
to the Covenant, unto all within our Charge; and to all the well-affected
within this Kingdom, by the Presbytery at Belfast, February 15th 1649.
WHen we do seriously consider the great, and many duties which we owe unto
God, and his people, over whom he has made us Overseers; and for whom we must
give an account; and when we behold the laudable Examples of the worthy
Ministers of the Province of London, and of the Commissioners of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in their free and faithful testimonies
against the insolences of the Sectarian party in England. Considering also the
dependency of this Kingdom upon the Kingdom of England, and remembering how
against strong oppositions we were assisted by the Lord the last year in
discharge of the like duty, and how he punished the Contempt of our warning
upon the despisers thereof: We find our selves as necessitated; so the more
encouraged to cast in our Mite in the treasury, least our silence should
involve us in the guilt of unfaithfulness, and our People in security, and
neglect of duties.

In this discharge of the trust put upon us by God, we would not be looked upon
as sowers of sedition, or broachers of National and divisive motions, our
record is in heaven, that nothing is more hateful unto us, nor less intended
by us, and therefore we shall not fear the malicious, and wicked aspersions,
which we know Satan by his Instruments is ready to cast, not only upon us, but
on all who sincerely endeavor the advancement of Reformation.

What of late have been, and now are the insolent, and presumptuous practices
of the Sectaries in England, is not unknown to the world: For, first,
notwithstanding their specious pretenses for Religion, and Liberties, yet their
late, and present actings, being therewith compared, do clearly evidence that
they love a rough garment to deceive; since they have with a high hand despised
the Oath in breaking the Covenant, which is so strong a foundation to both,
whilst they laden it with slighting reproaches, calling it a Bundle of
particular and contrary Interests, and a Snare to the people; and likewise
labor to establish by Laws an Universal Toleration of all Religions, which
is an Innovation over-turning of Unity in Religion, and so directly repugnant
to the word of God, the two first Articles of our Solemn Covenant, which is
the greatest wickedness in them to violate, since many of the chiefest of
themselves, have with their hands testified to the most high God, sworn, and
sealed it.

Moreover; their great dis-affection to the Settlement of Religion, and so
their future breach of Covenant does more fully appear by their strong
oppositions to Presbyteriall Government (the hedge, and Bulwark of Religion)
whilst they express their hatred to it, more then to the worst of errors, by
excluding it under the name of Compulsion; when they embrace, even Paganism,
and Judaisme in the Arms of Toleration. Not to speak of their Aspersions upon
it, and the Assertors thereof, as Antichristian, and Popish, though they have
deeply sworn to maintain the same Government in the first Article of the
Covenant, as it is established in the Church of Scotland, which they now so
despite, and fully blaspheme.

Again, It is more then manifest that they seek not the vindication, but the
extirpation of Laws, and Liberties, as appears by their seizing on the person
of the King, and at their pleasures removing him from place to place, not only
without the consent, but (if we mis-take not) against a direct Ordinance of
Parliament: their violent surprising, imprisoning, and secluding many of the
most worthy Members of the Honorable House of Commons, directly against a
declared Privilege of Parliament (an Action certainly without parallel in any
age) and their purposes of abolishing Parliamentary power for the future, and
establishing of a Representative (as they call it) in stead thereof. Neither
has their fury stayed here, but without all rule, or example, being but
private men, they have proceeded to the trial of the King, against both the
Interest, and Protestation of the Kingdom of Scotland, and the former public
Declarations of both Kingdoms (besides the violent have, rejecting the hearing
of any defenses) with cruel hands have put him to death; an act so horrible,
as no history, divine or humane, has laid a President of the like.

These, and many other their detestable insolences, may abundantly convince
every unbyassed Judgment, that the present practice of the Sectaries, and
their Abettors, do directly over-turne the Laws and Liberties of the
Kingdoms, root out lawful, and supreme Magistracy (the just privileges
whereof we have sworn to maintain) and introduce a fearful confusion, and
lawless Anarchie.

The Spirit of God by Solomon tells us, Pro. 30. 21. That a servant to reign
is one of the four things for which the earth is disquieted, and which is
cannot hear: We wonder nothing that the earth is disquieted for these things;
but we wonder greatly, if the earth can bear them, and albeit the Lord so
permit, that folly be set in great dignity, and they which sit in low place;
That servants ride upon horses, and Princes walk as servants upon the Earth,
Eccles. 10. ver. 6, 7. Yet the same Wise man says, Pro. 19. 10. Delight is not
seemly for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule ever Princes.

When we consider these things, we cannot but declare and manifest our utter
dislike and detestation of such unwarrantable practices, directly subverting
our Covenant, Religion, Laws, and Liberties. And as Watchmen in Sion warn all
the Lovers of truth, and well-affected to the Covenant, carefully to avoyde
compliance with, or not bearing witness against horrid Insolences, least
partaking with them in their sins, they also be partakers of their plagues.
Therefore in the Spirit of meekness, we earnestly entreat, and in the
authority of Jesus Christ, (whose servants we are) Charge, and obtest all who
resolve to adhere unto truth, and the Covenant, diligently to observe, and
conscientiously to perform these following duties.

1. First, That according to our solemn Covenant, every one study more to the
power of godliness, and personal reformation of themselves, and families,
because for the great breach of this part of the Covenant, God is highly
offended with these Lands, and justly provoked to permit men to be the
Instruments of our misery and afflictions.

2. Secondly, That every one in their station and calling earnestly contend for
the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, Jude 3. And seek to have
their hearts established with grace, that they be not unstable, and wavering,
carried about with every wind of doctrine; but that they receive the truth in
love, avoiding the company of such, as withdraw from, and vilify the public
Ordinances; speak evil of Church Government; invent damnable errors, under
the specious pretense of a Gospel-way, and new Light; and highly extol the
persons and courses of notorious Sectaries, least God give them over to strong
delusions (the plague of these times) that they may believe lies, and be damned.

3. Thirdly, That they would not be drawn by Council, Command, or Example, to
shake off the ancient, and fundamental Government of these Kingdoms by King
and Parliament, which we are so deeply engaged to preserve by our solemn
Covenant, as they would not be found guilty of the great evil of these times
(condemned by the Holy Ghost) the despising of Dominion, and speaking evil of
Dignities.

4. Fourthly, That they do cordially endeavor the preservation of the Union
amongst the well-affected in the Kingdoms, not being swayed by any National
respect: remembering that part of the Covenant; That we shall not suffer our
selves directly, nor indirectly, by whatsoever Combination, persuasion, or
terror, to be divided, or withdrawn from this blessed Union, and Conjunction.

And finally, albeit there be more present hazard from the power of Sectaries,
(as were from Malignants the last year) yet we are not ignorant of the evil
purposes of Malignants, even at this time in all the Kingdoms; and
particularly in this; and for this cause we exhort every one with equal
watchfulness to keep themselves free from associating with such, or from
swerving in their judgments to Malignant principles; and to avoid all such
persons as have been from the beginning known opposers of Reformation,
refusers of the Covenant, combining themselves with Papists, and other
notorious Malignants, especially such who have been chief Promotors of the
late Engagement against England, Calumniators of the work of Reformation, in
reputing the miseries of the present times unto the advancers thereof, and that
their just hatred to Sectaries, incline not their minds to favor Malignants,
or to think that because of the power of Sectaries, the cause of God needs the
more to fear the Enmity, or to stand in need of the help of Malignants.

OBSERVATIONS UPON the Articles of Peace with the Irish Rebels, on the Letter
of Ormond to Col. Jones, and the Representation of the Presbytery at Belfast.
ALthough it be a Maxim much agreeable to wisdom, that just deeds are the best
answer to injurious words, and actions of what ever sort, their own plainest
Interpreters; yet since our enemies can find the leisure both ways to offend
us, it will be requisite we should be found in neither of those ways
neglectfull of our just defense. To let them know, that sincere and upright
intentions can certainly with as much ease deliver themselves into words as into
deeds.

Having therefore seen of late those Articles of Peace granted to the Papist
Rebels of Ireland, as special graces and favors from the late King, in
reward, most likely, of their work don, and in his name and authority confirmed
and ratified by James Earl of Ormond; together with his Letter to Col. Jones,
Governor of Dublin, full of contumely and dishonor, both to the Parliament
and Army. And on the other side, an Insolent and seditious Representation from
the Scotch Presbytery at Belfast in the North of Ireland; no less
dishonorable to the State; and much about the same time brought hither; there
will be needful as to the same slanderous aspersions but one and the same
Vindication against them both. Nor can we sever them in our notice and
resentment, though one part intitl'd a Presbytery, and would be thou ghta
Protestant Assembly, since their own unexampl'd virulence has wrapped them into
the same guilt, made them accomplices and assistants to the abhorred Irish
Rebels, and with them at present to advance the same interest: if we consider
both their calumnies, their hatred, and the pretended Reasons of their hatred
to be the same; the time also, and the place concurring, as that there lacks
nothing but a few formal words, which may be easily dissembled, to make the
perfetest conjunction; and between them to divide that Island,

As for these Articles of Peace made with those inhumane Rebels and Papists of
Ireland by the late King, as one of his last Masterpieces. We may be
confidently persuaded, that no true borne Englishman, can so much as barely
read them without indignation and disdain, that those bloody Rebels, and so
proclaimed and judged of by the King himself, after the merciless and
barbarous Massacre of so many thousand English, (who had used their right and
title to that Country with such tenderness and moderation, and might
otherwise have secured themselves with ease against their Treachery) should be
now graced and rewarded with such freedoms and enlargements, as none of their
Ancestors could ever merit by their best obedience, which at best was always
treacherous, to be infranchiz'd with full liberty equal to their Conquerours,
whom the just revenge of ancient Pyracies, cruel Captivities, and the
causlesse infestation of our Coast, had warrantably called over, and the long
prescription of many hundred years; besides what other titles are acknowledged
by their own Irish Parlaments, had fixed and seated in that soil with as good a
right as the meerest Natives.

These therefore by their own foregoing demerits and provocations justly made
our vassalls, are by the first Article of this peace advanced to a Condition of
freedom superior to what any English Protestants durst have demanded. For what
else can be the meaning to discharge them the Common Oath of Supremacy,
especially being Papists (for whom principally that oath was intended) but
either to resign them the more into their own power, or to set a mark of
dishonor upon the British Loyalty; by trusting Irish Rebels for one single
Oath of Allegiance, as much as all his Subjects of Britain for the double
swearing both of Allegiance and Supremacy.

The second Article puts it into the hands of an Irish Parliament to repeal, or
to suspend, if they think convenient, that act usually called Poynings Act,
which was the maine, and yet the civillest and most moderate acknowledgement
imposed of their dependence on the Crown of England; whereby no Parliament could
be summond there, no Bill be past, but what was first to be transmitted and
allowd under the great seal of England. The recalling of which Act, tends
openly to invest them with a law-giving power of their own, enables them by
degrees to throw off all subjection to this Realm, and renders them who by
their endless treasons and revolts have deserved to hold no Parliament at all,
but to be governed by Edicts and Garrisons, as absolute and supreme in that
Assembly as the People of England in their own Land. And the 12th Article
grants them in express words, that the Irish Parliament shall be no more
dependent on the Parliament of England, then the Irish themselves shall declare
agreeable to the Laws of Ireland.

The two and twentieth Article more ridiculous then dangerous, coming
especially from such a serious knot of Lords and Politicians, obtaines that
those Acts prohibiting to plow with horses by the Tail, and burn oats in the
Straw, be repeald; anough if nothing else, to declare in them a disposition not
only sottish but indocible and averse from all Civility and amendment, and
what hopes they give for the future, who rejecting the ingenuity of all other
Nations to improve and wax more civil by a civilizing Conquest, though all
these many years better shown and taught, prefer their own absurd and savage
Customs before the most convincing evidence of reason and demonstration: a
testimony of their true Barbarism and obdurate wilfulness to be expected no
less in other matters of greatest moment.

Yet such as these and thus affected, the ninth Article entrusts with the
Militia; a Trust which the King swore by God at New Market, he would not commit
to his Parliament of England, no not for an hour. And well declares the
confidence he had in Irish Rebels, more then in his Loyaliest Subjects. He
grants them moreover till the performance of all these Articles, that 15000
foot and 2500 horse, shall remain a standing Army of Papists at the beck and
Command of Dillon, Muskery, and other arch Rebels, with power also of adding to
that number as they shall see cause. And by other Articles allows them the
constituting of Magistrates and Judges in all Causes, whom they think fie: and
till a settlement to their own minds, the possession of all those Towns and
Countries within their now Quarters being little less then all the Island,
besides what their Cruelty has dispeopl'd and laid wast. And lastly, the
whole managing both of peace and war is committed to Papists, and the chief
Leaders of that Rebellion.

Now let all men judge what this wants of utter alienating and acquitting the
whole Province of Ireland from all true fealty and obedience to the
Commonwealth of England. Which act of any King against the Consent of his
Parliament, though no other Crime were laid against him, might of it self
strongly conduce to the dis-inthrowning him of all. In France Henry the third
demanding leave in greatest exigencies to make Sale of some Crown Lands only,
and that to his Subjects, was answered by the Parliament then at Blois, that a
King in no case, though of extremest necessity, might alienate the Patrimony
of his Crown, whereof he is but only Usu-fructuary, as Civilians term it, the
propriety remaining ever to the Kingdom, not to the King. And in our own
Nation, King John, for resigning though unwillingly his Crown to the Popes
Legate, with little more hazard to his Kingdom then the payment of 1000 Marks,
and the unsightlinesse of such a Ceremony, was deposed by his Barons, and Lewis
the French Kings Son elected in his room. And to have carried only the
Jewels, Plate, and Treasure into Ireland without consent of the Nobility, was
one of those impeachments that condemned Richard the second to lose his Crown.

But how petty a Crime this will seem to the alienating of a whole Kingdom,
which in these Articles of Peace we see as good as done by the late King, not
to friends, but to mortal Enemies, to the accomplishment of his own interests
and ends, wholly separate from the Peoples good, may without aggravation be
easily conceived. Nay by the Covenant it self, since that so cavillously is
urged against us, we are enjoined in the fourth Article, with all
faithfulness to endeavor the bringing all such to public Trial and condign
Punishment, as shall divide one Kingdom from another. And what greater
dividing then by a pernicious and hostile Peace, to disalliege a whole Feudary
Kingdom from the ancient Dominion of England? Exception we find there of no
person whatsoever; and if the King who has actually done this, or any for him
claim a Privilege above Justice, it is again demanded by what express Law,
either of God or man, and why he whose office is to execute Law and Justice
upon all others, should sit himself like a demigod in lawless and unbunded
anarchy; refusing to be accountable for that authority over men naturally his
equals, which God himself without a reason givn is not wont to exercise over
his creatures? And if God the nearer to be acquainted with mankind and his
frailties, and to become our Priest, made himself a man, and subject to the
Law, we gladly would be instructed why any mortal man for the good and welfare
of his brethren being made a King, should by a clean contrary motion make
himself a God, exalted above Law; the readiest way to become utterly
unsensible, both of his human condition, and his own duty.

And how securely, how smoothly, with how little touch or sense of any
commiseration, either Princely or so much as human, he has sold away that
justice so often demanded, and so often by himself acknowledged to be due for the
blood of more then 200000. of his Subjects, that never hurt him, never disobeyd
him, assassinated and cut in pieces by those Irish Barbarians, to give the
first promoting, as is more then thought, to his own tyrannical designs in
England, will appear by the 18th Article of his peace; wherein without the
least regard of Justice to avenge the dead, while he thirsts to be avenged upon
the living, to all the Murders, Massacres, Treasons, Pyracies, from the very
fatal day wherein that Rebellion first broke out, he grants an act of
Oblivion. If this can be justified, or not punished in whomsoever, while there
is any faith, any Religion, any Justice upon Earth, there can no reason be
alleged why all things are not list to confusion. And thus much be observd in
brief concerning these Articles of peace made by the late King withhie Irish
Rebels.

The Letter of Ormond sent to Col. Jones Governor of Dublin, attempting his
fidelity, which the discretion and true worth of that Gentleman has so well
answered and repulst, had passed here with out mention, but that the other part
of it not content to do the errand of Treason, roves into a long digression of
evil and reproachful language to the Parliament and Army of England. Which
though not worth their notice, as from a Crew of Rebels whose inhumanities are
long since become the hornour and execration of all that hear them, yet in the
pursuance of a good endeavor, to give the world all due satisfaction of the
present doings, no fit opportunity shall be omitted.

He accuses first that we are the Subveters of true Religion, the protectors
and inviters not only of all false ones, but of irreligion and atheism. An
accusation that no man living could more unjustly use then our accuser himself;
and which without a strange besottednesse, he could not expect but to be
retorted upon his own head. All men who are true Protestants, of which number
he gives out to be one, know not a more immediate and killing Subverter of all
true Religion then Antichrist, whom they generally believe to be the Pope and
Church of Rome, he therefore who makes peace with this grand Enemy and
perscutor of the true Church, he who joins with him, strengthens him, gives
him root to grow up and spread his poison, removing all opposition against him,
granting him Schools, Abbeyes, and Revenues, Garrisons, Fortresses, Towns, as
in so many of those Articles may be seen, he of all Protestants may be called
most justly the Subverter of true Religion, the Protector and inviter of
irreligion and atheism, whether it be Ormond or his Master. And if it can be
no way proved, that the Parliament has countenac'd Popery or Papists, but have
every where brok'n their Temporal power, thrown down their public
Superstitions, and confined them to the bare enjoyment of that which is not in
our reach, their Consciences, if they have encouragd all true Ministers of the
Gospel, that is to say, afforded them favor and protection in all places where
they preached; and although they think not money or Stipend to be the best
encouragement of a true Pastor, yet therein also have not been wanting nor
intend to be, they doubt not then to affirm themselves, not the Subverters, but
the maintainers and defenders of true Religion; which of it self and by
Consequence is the surest and the strongest Subversion, not only of all false
ones, but of irreligion and atheism. For the Weapons of that Warfare, as the
Apostle testifies who best knew, are not carnal, but mighty through God to the
pulling down of Strong Holds, and all reasonings, and every high thing exalted
against the knowledge of God, surprising every thought unto the obedience of
Christ, and easily revenging all disobedience, 2 Cor. 10. What Minister or
Clergyman that either understood his high calling, or sought not to erect a
secular and carnal Tyranny over spiritual things, would neglect this ample
and sublime power conferrd upon him, and come a begging to the weak hand of
Magistracy for that kind of aid which both the Magistrate has no Commission to
afford him, and in the way he seeks it has been always found helpless and
unprofitable. Neither is it unknown, or by wisest men unobserved, that the
Church began then most apparently to degenerate, and go to ruin, when she
borrowed of the Civil power more then fair encouragement and protection; more
then which Christ himself and his Apostles never required. To say therefore
that We protect and invite all false Religions, with irreligion also and
atheism, because we lend not or rather missapply not the temporal power to
help out, though in vain, the sloth, the spleen, the insufficiency of
Churchmen, in the execution of spiritual discipline, over those within their
Charge, or those without, is an imputation that may be laid as well upon the
best regulated States and Governments through the World. Who have been so
prudent as never to employ the Civil sword further then the edge of it could
reach; that is, to Civil offenses only; proving always against objects that
were spiritual a ridiculous weapon. Our protection therefore to men in Civil
matters unoffensive we cannot deny; their Consciences we leave, as not within
our Cognizance, to the proper cure of instruction, praying for them.
Nevertheless, if any be found among us declared atheists, malicious enemies of
God, and of Christ; The Parliament, I think, professes not to tolerate such, but
with all befitting endeavors to suppress them. Otherways to protect none
that in a larger sense may be taxed of irreligion or atheism, may perhaps be
the ready way to exclude none sooner out of protection, then those themselves
that most accuse it to be so general to others. Lastly, that we invite such as
these, or encourage them, is a mere slander without proof.

He tells us next that they have murderd the King. And they deny not to have
justly and undauntedly, as became the Parliament of England, for more bloodshed
and other heinous Crimes then ever King of this Land was guilty of, after open
trial, punished him with death. A matter which to men whose serious
consideration thereof has left no certain precept, or example undebated, is so
far from giving offense, that we implore and beseech the Divine Majesty so to
uphold and support their spirits with like fortitude and Magnanimity, that all
their ensuing actions may correspond and prove worthy that impartial and noble
piece of Justice, wherein the hand of God appeared so evidently on our side.
We shall not then need to fear what all the rout and faction of men basely
principl'd can do against us.

The end of our proceedings, which he takes upon him to have discovered; The
changing forsooth of Monarchy into Anarchy, sounds so like the smattering of
some raw Politician, and the overworne objection of every trivial talker, that
we leave him in the number. But seeing in that which follows he contains not
himself, but contrary to what a Gentleman should know of Civility, proceeds to
the contemptuous naming of a person, whose valor and high merit many enemies
more noble then himself have both honored and feared, to assert his good name
and reputation, of whose service the Commonwealth receaves so ample
satisfaction, it is answered in his behalf, that Cromwell whom he couples with a
name of scorn, has done in few years more eminent and remarkable Deeds
whereon to found Nobility in his house, though it were wanting, and perpetual
Renown to posterity, then Ormond and all his Ancestors put together can show
from any record of their Irish exploits, the widest scene of their glory.

He passes on in his groundless conjectures, that the aim of this Parliament
may be perhaps to set up first an elective Kingdom, and after that a perfet
Turkish tyranny. Of the former we suppose the late act against Monarchy will
suffice to acquitt them. Of the latter certainly there needed no other pattern
then that Tyranny which was so long modelling by the late King himself, with
Strafford, and that arch Prelat of Canterbury, his chief Instruments; whose
designs God has dissipated. Neither is it any new project of the Monarchs,
and their Courtiers in these days, though Christians they would be thought, to
endeavor the introducing of a plain Turkish Tyranny. Witness that
Consultation had in the Court of France under Charles the ninth at Blois,
wherein Poncet, a certain Court projector, brought in secretly by the
Chancellor Biragha, after many praises of the Otteman Government; proposes
means and ways at large in presence of the King, the Queen Regent, and Anjou
the Kings Brother, how with best expedition, and least noise the Turkish
Tyranny might be set up in France. It appears therefore that the design of
bringing in that Tyranny, is a Monarchical design, and not of those who have
dissolvd Monarchy.

As for Parlaments by three Estates, we know that a Parliament signifies no
more then the Supreme and general Council of a Nation, consisting of
whomsoever chos'n and assembld for the public good; which was ever practiced,
and in all sorts of Government, before the word Parliament, or the formality, or
the possibility of those three Estates, or such a thing as a Titular Marquess
had either name or being in the World. The Original of all which we could
produce to be far newer then those all Ages which he vaunts of, and by such
first invented and contrived, whose authority, though it were Charles Martell,
stands not so high in our repute, either for himself, or the age he lived in,
but that with as good warrant we may recede from what he ordained, as he
ordain what before was not.

But whereas besides he is bold to allege that of the three Estates there
remains only a small number, and they the Dreggs and Scum of the House of
Commons, this reproach and in the mouth of an Irish Man concerns not them
only, but redounds to apparent dishonor of the whole English Nation.
Doubtless there must be thought a great scarcity in England of persons
honorable and deserving, or else of Judgment, or so much as honesty in the
People, if those whom they esteem worthy to sit in Parliament be no better then
Scum and Dreggs in the Irish Dialect. But of such like stuff we meet not any
where with more excrescence then in his own lavish pen; which feeling it self
loose without the reins of discretion, rambles for the most part beyond all
Soberness and Civility. In which Torrent he goes on negotiating and cheapning
the Loyalty of our Faithful Governor of Dublin, as if the known and Tried
Constancy of that valiant Gentleman were to be bought with Court fumes.

He lays before him that there remains now no other liberty in the Subject
but to profess blasphemous opinions, to revile and tread underfoot Magistracy,
to murder Magistrates, to oppress and undo all that are not like minded with
us. Forgetting in the mean while himself to be in the head of a mixed Rabble,
part Papists, part Fugitives, and part Savages, guilty in the highest degree of
all these Crimes. What more blasphemous not opinion but whole Religion then
Popery, plunged into Idolatrous and Ceremonial Superstition, the very death of
all true Religion; figured to us by the Scripture it self in the shape of that
Beast, full of the names of Blasphemy, which we mention to him as to one that
would be counted Protestant, and had his breeding in the house of a Bishop. And
who are those that have trod under foot Magistracy, murdered Magistrates,
oppressed and undone all that syded not with them, but the Irish Rebels, in
that horrible Conspiracy, for which Ormond himself has either been or seemed
to be their enemy; though now their Ringleader. And let him ask the Jesuitea
about him whether it be not their known Doctrine and also practice, not by
fair and due process of Justice to punish Kings and Magistrates, which we
disavow not, but to murder them in the basest and most assassinous manner, if
their Church-Interest so require. There will not need more words to this Windy
Railer, convicted opnly of all those Crimes which he so confidently and yet
falsely charges upon others.

We have now to deal, though in the same Country, with another sort of
Adversaries, in show far different, in substance much what the same. These
write themselves the Presbytery of Belfast, a place better known by the name of
a late Barony, then by the same of these men's Doctrine or Ecclesiastical
Deeds; whose obscurity till now never came to our hearing. And surely we
should think this their Representment far beneath considerable, who have
neglected and past over the like unadvizednesse of their fellows in other
places more near us, were it not to observe in some particulars the Sympathy,
good Intelligence, and joint pace which they go in the North of Ireland, with
their Copartning Rebels in the South, driving on the same Interest to loose us
that Kingdom, that they may gain it themselves, or at least share in the
spoil: though the other be open enemies, these pretended Brethren

The Introduction of their Manifest out of doubt must be Zealous; Their Duty,
they say, to God and his people, over whom he has made them Overseers, and for
whom they must give account. What mean these men? is the Presbytery of
Belfast, a small Town in Ulster, of so large extent that their voices cannot
serve to teach duties in the Congregation which they oversee, without spreading
and divulging to all parts far beyond the Diocese of Patrick, or Columba,
their writt'n Representation, under the subtle pretense of Feeding their own
Flock? Or do they think to oversee or undertake to give an accomht for all to
whom their paper sends greeting? St. Paul to the Elders of Ephesus thinks it
sufficient to give charge that they take heed to themselves and to the Flock,
over which they were made overseers; beyond those bounds he inlarges not their
Commission. And surely when we put down Bishops, and put up Presbyters, which
the most of them have made use of to enrich and exalt themselvee, and turn the
first heel against their Benefactors, we did not think that one Classick
Fraternity so obscure and so remote, should involve us and all State affairs
within the Censure and Jurisdiction of Belfast, upon pretense of overseeing
their own charge.

We very well know that Church Censures are limited to Church matters, and
these within the compass of their own Province, or to say more truly of their
own Congregation: that affairs of State are not for their Meddling, as we could
urge even from their own Invectives and Protestations against the Bishops,
wherein they tell them with much fervency, that Ministers of the Gospel,
neither by that function nor by any other which they ought accept, have the
least Warrant to be Pragmaticall in the State.

And surely in vain were Bishops for these and other Causes forbid to fit and
vote in the House, if these men out of the house, and without vote shall claim
and be permitted more license on their Presbyteriall stools, to breed
continual disturbance by interposing in the Common Wealth. But seeing that
now, since their heaving out the Prelates to heave in themselves, they devise
new ways to bring both ends together which will never meet, that is to say
their former Doctrine with their present doings, as that they cannot else teach
Magistrates and Subjects their duty, and that they have besides a Right
themselves to speak as Members of the Common Wealth, Let them know that there
is a wide difference between the general exhortation to Justice and Obedience,
which in this point is the utmost of their Duty, and the State disputes wherein
they are now grown such busy Bodies, to preach of Titles, Interests, and
alterations in government: more then our Savior himself, or any of his
Apostles ever took upon them, though the Title both of Caesar and of Herod, and
what they did in matters of State might have then admitted controversy anough.

Next for their Civil Capacities, we are sure that Pulpits and
Church Assemblies, whether Classical or Provincial, never were intended or
allowd by wise Magistrates, no nor by him that sent them, to advance such
purposes; but that as Members of the Common Wealth they ought to mix with
other Commoners, and in that temporal Body to assume nothing above other
Private persons, or otherwise then in a usual and legal manner: not by
distinct Remonstrances and representments, as if they were a Tribe and party by
themselves, which is the next immediate way to make the Church lift a Horn
against the State, and claim an absolute and undepending Jurisdiction, as from
like advantage and occasion (to the trouble of all Christ'ndome) the Pope has
for many Ages done; and not only our Bishops were climing after him, but our
Presbyters also, as by late experiment we find. Of this Representation
therefore we can esteem and judge no other then of a slandrous and seditious
libell, sent abroad by a fort of Incendiaries, to delude and make the better
way under the cunning and plausible name of a Presbytery.

A second Reason of their Representing is, that they consider the dependence of
that Kingdom upon England, which is another shameless untruth that ever they
considered; as their own Actions will declare, by conniving, and in their
silence partaking with those in Ulster, whose obedience by what we have yet
heard, stands dubious, and with an eye of Conformity rather to the North, then
to that part where they owe their subjection; and this in all likelihood by the
inducement and instigation of these Representers: who are so far from
considering their dependence on England, as to presume at every word to term
proceedings of Parliament, the Insolences of a Sectarian party, and of private
men. Despising Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities, which hypocritically
they would seem to dissuade others from; and not fearing the due correction of
their Superiors, that may in fit season overtake them. When as the least
consideration of their Dependence on England would have kept them better in
their Duty.

The third Reason which they use, makes against them; The remembrance how God
punished the contempt of their warning last year upon the Breakers of Covenant,
whenas the next year after they forget the warning of that punishment hanging
over their own heads for the very same transgression, their manifest breach of
Covenant by this seditious Representation accompanied with the doubtful
obedience of that Province which represents it.

And thus we have their preface supported with three Reasons; two of them
notorious falsities, and the third against themselves; and two examples, the
Province of London, and the Commissioners of the Kirk Assembly. But certain, if
Canonical examples bind not, much less do Apocryphal.

Proceeding to avouch the Trust put upon them by God, which is plainly proved
to be none of this Nature, They would not be lookd upon as sowers of Sedition,
or authors of divisive motions, their Record, they say, is in heaven, and their
Truth and honesty no man knows where. For is not this a shameless hypocrisy,
and of mere wolves in sheeps clothing, to sow sedition in the Ears of all
men, and to face us down in the very Act, that they are Authors of no such
matter. But let the sequel both of their paper, and the obedience of the place
wherein they are, determine.

Nay while we are yet writing these things, and foretelling all men the
rebellion which was eevn then designed in the close purpose of these unhallowed
Priestlings, at the very time when with their lips they disclaimed all sowing of
sedition, news is brought, and too true, that the Scottish Inhabitants of that
Province are actually revolted, and have not only besieged in Londonderry
those Forces which were to have fought against Ormond, and the Irish Rebels;
but have in a manner declared with them, and begun open war against the
Parliament; and all this by the incitement and illusions of that unchristian
Synagogue at Belfast, who yet dare charge the Parliament, that notwithstanding
specious pretenses, yet their actings do evidence that they love a rough
garment to deceive. The Deceit we own not, but the Comparison, by what at first
sight may seem alluded, we accept: For that hairy roughness assumed won Jacob
the Birthright both Temporal and Eternal; and God we trust has so disposed
the mouth of these Balaams, that coming to Curse, they have stumbled into a
kind of Blessing, and compared our actings to the faithful Act of that
Patriarch.

But if they mean, as more probably their meaning was, that rough garment spok'n
of Zach. 13. 4. We may then behold the pitiful store of learning, and
theology, which these deceivers have thought sufficient to uphold their credit
with the people, who, though the rancour that levens them have somewhat
quickn'd the common drawling of their Pulpit elocution, yet for want of stock
anough in Scripture Phrase to serve the necessary uses of their malice, they are
become so liberal, as to part freely with their own budge gowns from off
their backs, and bestow them on the Magistrate as a rough garment to deceive;
rather then not be furnished with a reproach though never so improper, never so
obvious to be turned upon themselves. For but with half an eye cast upon that
text, any man will soon discern that rough garment to be their own coat, their
own livery, the very badge and cognizance of such false prophets as themselves.
Who, when they understand, or ever seriously mind the beginning of that 4th.
verse, may be ashamed every one of his lying vision, and may justly fear that
foregoing denouncement to such as speak lies in the name of the Lord, verse. 3.
lurking under the rough garment of outward rigor and formality, whereby they
cheat the simple. So that this rough garment to deceiv we bring ye once again,
Grave Sirs, into your own Vestry; or with Zachary shall not think much to fit
it to your own shoulders. To bestow ought in good earnest on the Magistrate, we
know your classic Priestship is too gripple, for ye are always begging: and
for this rough gown to deceav, we are confident ye cannot spare it; it is your
Sundays gown, your every day gown, your only gown, the gown of your faculty;
your divining gown; to take it from ye were sacrilege. Wear it therefore, and
possess it your selves, most grave and reverend Carmelites, that all men both
young and old, as we hope they will shortly, may yet better know ye and
distinguish ye by it; and give to your rough gown where ever they meet it,
whether in Pulpit, Classis, or Provincial Synod, the precedence, and the
pre-eminence of deceaving.

They charge us next that we have brokn the Covenant, and load'n it with
slighting Reproaches. For the reproaching, let them answer that are guilty,
whereof the State we are sure cannot be accused. For the breaking, let us hear
wherein. In laboring say they, to establish by Law a universal tolleration of
all Religions, This touches not the State; for certainly were they so minded,
they need not labor it, but do it, having power in their hands; and we know of
no act as yet past to that purpose. But suppose it done, wherein is the Covenant
broken. The Covenant enjoins us to endeavor the extirpation first of Popery and
Prelacy, then of Heresy, Schism, and profaneness, and whatsoever shall be found
contrary to sound Doctrine and the power of godliness. And this we ceas not to
do by all effectual and proper means: But these Divines might know, that to
extirpat all these things can be no work of the Civil sword, but of the
spiritual which is the Word of God.

No man well in his wits endeavoring to root up weeds out of his ground,
instead of using the spade will take a Mallet or a Beetle. Nor does the Covenant
any way engage us to extirpate, or to prosecute the men, but the heresies and
errors in them, which we tell these Divines and the rest that understand not,
belongs chiefly to their own Function, in the diligent preaching and insisting
upon sound Doctrine, in the confuting not the railing down errors, encountering
both in public and private Conference, and by the power of truth, not of
persecution, subduing those authors of heretical opinions, and lastly in the
spiritual execution of Church discipline within their own congregations. In all
these ways we shall assist them, favor them, and as far as appertains to us
join with them, and moreover not tolerate the free exercise of any Religion,
which shall be found absolutely contrary to sound Doctrine or the power of
godliness; for the conscience we must have patience till it be within our
verge. And thus doing we shall believ to have kept exactly all that is requird
from us by the Covenant. Whilst they by their seditious practices against us,
then which nothing for the present can add more assistance or advantage to
those bloody Rebels and Papists in the South, will be found most pernicious
Covenant breakers themselves, and as deep in that guilt as those of their own
Nation the last year; the warning of whose ill success like men hardn'd for
the same judgment, they miserably pervert to an encouragement in the same
offense, if not a fat worse; For now they have joined interest with the Irish
Rebels, who have ever fought against the Covenant, whereas their Countrymen the
year before made the Covenant their plea. But as it is a peculiar mercy of God to
his people, while they remain his, to preserve them from wicked confederations:
so it is a mark and punishment of hypocrites to be drivn at length to mix their
cause, and the interest of their Covenant with Gods enemies.

And whereas they affirm that the tolerating of all Religions in the manner that
we tolerat them, is an innovation, we must acquaint them that we are able to
make it good if need be, both by Scripture and the Primitive Fathers, and the
frequent assertion of whole Churches and Protestant States in their
Remonstrances and expostulations against the Popish tyranny over souls. And
what force of argument do these Doctors bring to the contrary? But we have long
observed to what pass the bold ignorance and sloth of our Clergy tends no less
now then in the Bishops days, to make their bare sayings and censures authentic
with the People, though destitute of any proof or argument. But thanks be to
God they are discerned.

Their next impeachment is, that we oppose the Presbyteriall government, the
hedge and bulwark of Religion. Which all the Land knows to be a most impudent
falsehood, having establishd it with all freedom, wherever it has been desired.
Nevertheless as we perceave it aspiring to be a compulsive power upon all
without exception in Parochial, Classical, and Provincial Hierarchies, or to
require the fleshly arm of Magistracy in the execution of a spiritual
Discipline, to punish and amerce by any corporal infliction those whose
consciences cannot be edifi'd by what authority they are compelled, we hold it
no more to be the hedge and bulwark of Religion, than the Popish and Prelaticall
Courts, or the Spanish Inquisition.

But we are told, We embrace Paganism and Judaism in the arms of toleration. A
most audacious calumny. And yet while we detest Judaism, we know our selves
commanded by St. Paul, Romans 11. to respect the Jews, and by all means to
endeavor their conversion.

Neither was it ever sworn in the Covenant to maintain a universal Presbytery in
England, as they falsely allege, but in Scotland against the Common Enemy, if
our aid were called for: being left free to reform our own Country according to
the Word of God, and the example of best reformed Churches; from which rule we
are not yet departed.

But here utterly forgetting to be Ministers of the Gospel, they presume to
open their mouths not in the spirit of meekness, as like dissemblers they
pretend, but with as much devilish malice, impudence and falsehood as any Irish
Rebel could have uttered; and from a barbarous ^ook of Ireland brand us with
the extirpation of laws and liberties; things which they seem as little to
understand as ought that belongs to good letters or humanity.

That we seisd on the person of the King. Who was surrendered into our hands an
Enemy and Captive by our own subordinate and paid Army of Scots in England.
Next our imprisoning many Members of the House. As if it were impossible they
should deserve it, conspiring and banding against the public good; which to the
other part appearing, and, with the power they had, not resisting, had bin a
manifest desertion of their trust and duty. No question but it is as good and
necessary to expel rott'n Members out of the House, as to banish Delinquents
out of the Land: and the reason holds as well in forty as in five. And if they
be yet more, the more dangerous is their number. They had no privilege to fit
there and vote home the author, the impenitent author of all our miseries to
freedom, honor, and royalty, for a few fraudulent if not destructive
concessions. Which that they went about to do, how much more clear it was to
all men, so much the more expedient, and important to the Commonwealth was
their speedy seizure and exclusion; and no breach of any just privilege, but a
breach of their knotted faction. And here they cry out, An action without
parallel in any age. So heartily we wish all men were unprejudiced in all our
actions, as these illiterat denouncers never parallelld so much of any age as
would contribute to the tithe of a Century. That we abolish Parlamentary
power, and establish a representative instead thereof. Now we have the hight of
them; these profound Instructors in the midst of their Representation, would
know the English of a Representative, and were perhaps of that Classis, who
heretofore were as much staggerd at Trienniall.

Their grand accusation is our Justice don on the King, which that they may
prove to be without rule or example, they venture all the credit they have in
divine and human history; and by the same desperate boldness detect themselves
to be egregious liars and impostors, seeking to abuse the multitude with a show
of that gravity and learning which never was their portion. Had their knowledge
bin equal to the knowledge of any stupid Monk, or Abbot, they would have known
at least, though ignorant of all things else, the life and acts of him, who
first instituted their order: but these blockish Presbyters of Clandeboy know
not that John Knox, who was the first founder of Presbytery in Scotland, taught
professedly the doctrine of deposing, and of killing Kings. And thus while they
deny that any such rule can be found, the rule is found in their own Country,
givn them by their own first presbyterian institutor; and they themselves like
irregular Friars walking contrary to the rule of their own foundation, deserv
for so gross an ignorance and transgression to be disciplined upon their own
stools. Or had their reading in history bin any, which by this we may be
confident is none at all, or their malice not highth'n'd to a blind rage, they
never would so rashly have thrown the dice to a palpable discovery of their
ignorance and want of shame. But wherefore spend we two such precious things as
time and reason upon Priests, the most prodigal mis-spenders of time, and the
scarsest owners of reason? It Is sufficient we have publishd our defenses, given
reasons, given examples of our Justice don; books also have bin writt'n to the
same purpose for men to look on that will; that no Nation under heaven but in
one age or other has don the like. The difference only is, which rather
seems to us matter of glory, that they for the most part have without form of
Law don the deed by a kind of martial Justice; we by the deliberate and
well-weighd Sentence of a legal Judicature.

But they tell us, It was against the interest and protestation of the Kingdom
of Scotland. And did exceeding well to join those two together: heerby
informing us what credit or regard need be givn in England to a Scotch
Protestation; usherd in by a Scotch interest: certainly no more then we see is
givn in Scotland to an English Declaration, declaring the interest of England.
If then our interest move not them, why should theirs move us? If they say, we
are not all England; we reply they are not all Scotland: nay, were the last
year so inconsiderable a part of Scotland as were beholding to this which they
now term the Sectarian Army, to defend and rescue them at the charges of
England from a stronger party of their own Countrymen, in whose esteem they were
no better then Sectarians themselves. But they add, It was against the former
Declarations of both Kingdoms, to seize, or proceed against the King. We are
certain that no such Declarations of both Kingdoms as derive not their full
force from the sense and meaning of the Covenant, can be produced.

And if they plead against us the Covenant, To preserve and defend his person;
we ask them briefly whether they take the Covenant to be absolute or
conditional? If absolute, then suppose the King to have committed all
prodigious crimes and impieties against God, or nature, or whole Nations, he
must nevertheless be sacred from all violent touch. Which absurd opinion, how
it can live in any man's reason, either natural or rectified, we much marvel:
Since God declard his anger as impetuous for the saving of King Benhadad,
though surrendering himself at mercy, as for the killing of Naboth. If it be
conditional, in the preservation and defense of Religion, and the peoples
liberty, then certainly to take away his life being dangerous, and pernicious
to both these, was no more a breach of the Covenant, then for the same reason at
Edinburrow to behead Gordon the Marquess Huntley. By the same Covenant we made
vow to assist and to defend all those that should enter with us into this
league: not absolutely but in the maintenance and pursuing thereof. If
therefore no man else ever were so madd as to claim from hence an impunitie
from all Justice, why should any for the King? Whose life by other Articles of
the same Covenant was forfet. Nay if common sense had not led us to such a clear
interpretation, the Scotch Commissioners themselves might boast to have bin our
first teachers: who when they drew to the malignance which brought forth that
perfidious last years irruption against all the bands of Covenant or Christian
neighborhood, making their hollow plea the defense of his Majesty's person,
they were constraind by their own guiltiness to leave out that following
morsel that would have choakd them, the preservation and defense of true
Religion, and our liberties. And questionless in the preservation of these, we
are bound as well, both by the Covenant, and before the Covenant, to preserve and
defend the person of any private man, and the person and authority of any
inferior Magistrate: So that this Article objected with such vehemence against
us, contains not an exception of the Kings person, and authority to do by
privilege what wickedness he list, and be defended, as some fancy, but an
express testification of our Loyalty, and the plain words without wresting
will bear as much, that we had no thoughts against his person, or just power,
provided they might confist with the preservation and defense of true Religion
and our liberties. But to these how hazardous his life was, will be needless to
repeat so oftn. It may suffice that while he was in custody, where we expected
his repentance, his remorse at last and compassion of all the innocent blood
shed already and hereafter likely to be shed for his mere wilfulness, he made
no other use of our continual forbearance, our humblest Petitions and
obtestations at his feet, but to sit contriving and somenting new plots against
us, and as his own phrase was, playing his own game, upon the miseries of his
people: Of which we desire no other view at present then these Articles of
peace with the Rebels, and the rare game likely to ensue from such a cast of
his Cards. And then let men reflect a little upon the slanders and reviles of
these wretched Priests, and judge what modesty, what truth, what conscience,
what any thing fit for Ministers, or we might say reasonable men can harbor
in them. For what they began in shamelesness and malice, they conclude in
frenzy: throwing out a sudden rapsody of Proverbs quite from the purpose; and
with as much comeliness as when Saul propheci'd. For casting off, as he did his
garments, all modesty and meekness wherewith the language of Ministers ought
to be clothed, speaking especially to their supreme Magistrate, they talk at
random of servants reigning, servants riding, and wonder how the Earth can
bear them. Either those men imagine themselves to be marvellously high set and
exalied in the chair of Belfast, to voutsafe the Parliament of England no
better style then servants, or else their high notion, which we rather believe,
falls as low as Court parasitism; supposing all men to be servants, but the
King. And then all their pains taken to seem so wise in proverbing, serves but
to conclude them down right slaves: and the edge of their own proverb falls
reverse upon themselves. For as Delight is not seemly for fools, much less
high words to come from base minds. What they are for Ministers, or how they
crept into the fould, whether at the window, or through the wall, or who set
them there so haughty in the Pontifical See of Belfast, we know not. But
this we rather have cause to wonder if the Earth can bear this unsufferable
insolency of upstarts; who from a ground which is not their own dare send such
defiance to the sovran Magistracy of England, by whose authority and in whose
right they inhabit there. By their actions we might rather judge them to be a
generation of High-land thieves and Red-shanks, who being neighbourly admitted,
not as the Saxons by merit of their warfare against our enemies, but by the
courtesy of England to hold possessions in our Province, a Country better
then their own, have, with worse faith then those Heathen, proved ungrateful
and treacherous guests to their best friends and entertainers. And let them take
heed, lest while their Glence, as to these matters, might have kept them
blameless and secure under those proceedings which they so feared to partake in,
that these their treasonous attempts and practices, have not involved them in a
far worse guilt of rebellion; and (notwithstanding that fair dehortatory from
joining with Malignants) in the appearance of a co-interest and partaking with
the Irish Rebels. Against whom, though by themselves pronouncd to be the
enemies of God, they go not out to battle, as they ought, but rather by these
their doings assist and become associats.

The End.
