HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty being given to understand, that sundry lewd and sedicious
bruites have been lately spread and carried abroad in many Shires of the Realm
by some unquiet and factious spirits, who, under diverse false and colorable
suggestions, put into simple Billettes in writing, and tending to the
disturbance of common peace, have trauayled her good and loving subjects in
diverse parts of her said Realm, by Huies and cries followed from place to
place, without warrant or direction from any Justice of peace, or name of any
special Officer resident within the said Shires, who in such cases ought to
have been informed thereof. Albeit her Majesty do greatly commend the love,
care and affection of her good subjects, who have showed so great a readiness
to employ their trauayles upon this occasion in the respect of her service,
pretended by such writings and bruites: yet finding the same to proceed
originally from the mere practice of some sedicious instruments, disposed to
lay hold upon any pretexte that may be offered them to trouble the peace of her
said Realm, by stirring up such of their own humors as are apt to tumult and
alteration, Her Majesty has thought good to notify and declare to all her
loving subjects, that as she does most ^^^ly hold the inuentors thereof
worthy of extreme punishment, so does she also condemn the spreading and
carrying of the said bruites in the next degree, both tending to the disquiet
and trouble of her said realm and subjects. And therefore by this her
proclamation, her Majesty does expressly command all Lieutenants of Shires,
Sherifs, Justices, and other her Majesty's, Offices and Ministers, both in
towns corporate and all other places whatsoever, to whom in this case it may
appertarne, that they do not only take present order for the speedy ceassing
of all such bruites and rumors, with the hewes and cries, and the
extraordinary watches growing thereof, within the Countries and circuites
under their several charges, but also cause forthwith diligent inquiry to be
made of the Authors of the same: and if any such be found, severely to punish
them as seditious perturbers of the common quiet. And that all Constables
hereafter that shall first receive any such report or charge for making of such
hew and cry, or for setting of such extraordinary watches, take care to stay
the first author to be answerable thereto as there shall be cause, upon pain of
being otherwise punished himself, as the first author and inuentor thereof.

Given at our Manor of Greenewich, the vi. day of of February, 1586. in the
nine and twentieth year of our reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
