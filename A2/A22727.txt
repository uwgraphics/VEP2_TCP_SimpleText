Remonstrances made by his Majesty's Ambassador of Great BRITAIN, to the
French King, and the Queen his Mother, June 1615.
SIr, the title of your good Brother, and ancient Friend, wherewith the King my
Master is truly styled, does assuredly persuade him that you also on your part
have the like impression of sincere affection, which is infused and ingrafted
in him by the successiue and perpetual continuance of that united amity and
alliance, which his Predecessors the Kings of Scotland have had at all times
with your Crown, has been testified also in these latter days, by the Kings
of England, in their worthy and effectual assistance often performed unto your
State, chiefly unto your Father, the late King of worthy memory, in the time of
his most difficult affairs; so that you cannot impute any thing proceeding
from him, but unto that same entire affection, which his Majesty, on his part,
desires (if it may be) to continue, and perpetuate in his Successors, both to
you and yours.

Whereupon, his Majesty by express command has charged me, seriously to
remonstrate unto your Majesty, for the good of your Person and State, and all
Christendom in general; and as he assures himself, that all his actions and
proceedings since his reign, which began with his life, will justify him
before you and the world, that he never through practicality, or curiosity
intruded himself into foreign affairs, so has he this testimony of his
conscience, and does protest before God, that the only end and cause of his
enter-meddling in this action, is the aforesaid welfare of your State, and
discharge of his own conscience.

Sir, his Majesty has been advertised, that your Majesty is resolved
speedily to take your Journey, to make an exchange of Princes with Spain:
whereupon he finds himself obliged (as well by the affection he bears unto
you in particular, as by the care he owes unto the public of Christendom,
faithfully to represent unto you the great and imminent danger, wherinto, by
this your resolution, you will plunge both the State of your own Kingdom, and
also of your nearest neighbors, and best allios, not that he does counsel
your Majesty to depart from tho contract which is already past touching these
marriages. For his Majesty knows well, that the greatness and dignity of Kings
does in good reason require, that they should seek the amity one of the other,
and combine themselves by such alliances and leagues of friendship, but only to
present unto your view, how expedient and necessary it is, (both for the
consideration and welfare of your person in particular, as also in respect of
all Christendom in general, in this doubtful uncertainty, wherein the
affairs of these times now stand, to remit the accomplishing of the said
marriages unto a time more mature and opportune.

Besides this ancient affection, and bond of amity between your Crowns, his
Majesty takes himself obliged in Conscience to perform unto you this office,
by reason of that faithful promise passed between the late King your Father of
happy memory and him; by the secret Ministry of some certain of your
servants, and namely, the deceased Monss. de Vitry, which was, that when either
of the two departed this life, the suruiuour should take into his care and
protection, the Estate and posterity of the deceased. Which, his Majesty,
presently after that unfortunate accident of the late Kings death, made known
(by the Baron of Hales) unto Mons. de la Borderie, who was then with him,
offering himself to the utmost of his power for the accomplishing of this
promise, whereof since the bond yet remains in his person toward your
Majesty, he cannot, for the discharge of his conscience, but show unto you,
and the Queen your Mother, the great wrong, which he supposes, is done unto
you, if, before you have attained to that maturitie of years and judgment,
requisite and necessary for your direction in the choice of your Wife and
associate, be it for the content of your affection, or welfare of your State,
you should be precipitated into the yoke of marriage, to the manifest prejudice
of your health, and (may be) of your contentment and affairs; for, as touching
this last point, his Majesty weighing that which publicly appears of the
co^stitution of your present estate, the diverse iealousies and discontentments
of the greatest of your Court, the ill treating of your Parliament, which
without doubt has caused much discontent in the minds of your Subjects, in
respect of the great credit and reputation, which this body, and principal
member of your State has with the people, besides the grieua^ces which those
of the reformed Religion pretend, he knows not how in the midst of these
agitations and disorders, your Majesty's may absent your selves from the heart
and center of your Kingdom, as you should do by this voyage; besides, the
leaving of your affairs here exposed to a great deal of confusion, and danger
of disorder.

But besides these considerations which merely concern your Person and
Kingdom in particular, the generaltie of Christendom does find it self
greatly interessed in the precipitation of this voyage, for if in the doubtful
and unsettled estate of the affairs of these times, the accomplishing of the
same were for a certain time suspended, there would be hope, that by the
common and joint intercession of all their friends and allies, the differences
which now molest and menace the quiet of Christendom, might be ordered; whereas
if in this doubtful and dangerous Conjunction, these marriages be suddenly
perfected, it cannot be in all likelihood, but there must ensue a general
combustion throughout all Christendom.

For first, what jealousy and discontent will the States of the united
Provinces receive, when they shall see France and Spain so jointly united? can
they hope that France will then labor to cause the Archduke to make
restitution of those places kept, and detayned in Cleues and Iuilliers, by the
Marquis Spinola, for the which they are now in controversy with him; yea
rather, will they not suspect all counsels and resolutions, to be enterprised
to oppugn them? yes, without doubt they will believe, that in this
Conjunction, the ill will of Spain toward them, will surmount the good will
of France, and that it will not cease, until it has engaged this State in
open enmity against them. And this with great grief his Majesty is forced to
say, that if the same will and resolution had been brought from hence, as was
taken by him, for the ordering of the affairs of Wesell, those points and
puntillioes whereon so long time the Spaniards have dwelt, to prolong this
affair, might have been long ago cut off: but now on the contrary, he has
cause to grieve, that having as much labored to solicit the interuention of
this State in this affair, as to draw the Spaniard to some reason;
notwithstanding all this importunity, he could never procure any other answer
from hence (neither touching this point, or the other affairs) but in general
terms, witness that weak satisfactorie answer presented unto his Majesty,
by Mons. de Buisseaux, as also all the other answers to the solicitations of
the Princes of Germany.

Moreover, these Princes of the Union, knowing that Spain is the Favorer and
Protector of their Enemies, will receive no less damage and displeasure by the
accomplishing of these marriages, thus prosecuted without any necessity, and so
out of season, that they will not only weaken them by the loss of France, but
also strengthen their Enemies by the advantage of this Conjunction. And who can
secure them from fear, (if the troubles of Sauoy can be appeased) that the
Army of Spain, which now threatens Italic, does not come expressly by the
forbearance of this State, to fall upon them, and in particular, the Elector of
Brandenbourg, who has so long timerelyed upon France, cannot hereafter expect
any favor from hence for the deciding of his controversy, seeing that the
King of Spain has taken the Duke of Newenbourg, his Competitor, into his
protection?

As for the Duke of Sauoy, who is descended from this Crown, and whose
preservation does much concern it, as well for the neerenesse, as for the
situation of his Country; if before the accomplishing of these marriages, he
has found France so violent and discourteous toward him, as well by the harsh
and peremptory messages, which have been sent him from hence, as by the
rigorous inhibitions published in disfavor of him, declaring all such as go
to aid or assist him, offenders of his Majesty, and so using them, by
confiscation and razing of their houses, (a thing never heard of, nor
practiced, especially by France, toward a Prince and Friend, so vexed and
oppressed by the Arms of one stronger then himself) how may he hope, after
the consummation of the said marriages, that this State will remain an
impartial Arbitrator betwixt Spain and him, or that these Ministers which
shall be employed in his business, will deal faithfully and sincerely for the
good of his affairs, his Majesty protesting for his own part that his desire
has and ever shall be, firmly to unite himself with your Majesty's, to
incite the said Duke unto peace, howbeit he judges it fit to have an equal
care, lest by such disfavor, he might be enforced to accept of conditions
unsafe and prejudicial?

And since that the greatest Honor of France, during the wise government of
the late King, was the authority and trust which it had, prudently and
profitably to provide (as it has done upon diverse great and important
occasions) for the accommodating of differences between foreign Princes and
States, to the conservation of the public peace of Christendom, and seeing
that it is already apparent, that the shadow of these double alliances does
minister cause of fear to your ancient friends, that together with them the
interests also of Spain will be espoused, it is most certain, that the
precipitation of these marriages will much augment this fear in them, causing
France to lose that authority and trust which their Councels have had always
heretofore on their part, turning their confidence into distrust, and their
love into discontent.

If therefore, notwithstanding all these weighty and urgent considerations,
which concern so nearly the person of your Majesty, and the Weal public,
as well of your own State, as of your Neighbors and Allies, you shall hastily
proceed to the co^summation of this voyage; what may they imagine, who in this
State, and also among your Neighbors do clearly perceive, weigh and
apprehend these pregnant considerations, but that thereby there is some hidden
design tending to their prejudice?

Lastly, the King my Master shall have just cause of regret in his own
particular, if having lived so many years in love, and correspondency so firm
with this Crown, insomuch that these two States (having had almost one and the
self same to will, and not to will, the same Friends and Enemies) have always
joined their Counsels, and guided their actions in all affairs and
occurrances, tending to the Weal public, after one and the same manner: Now
France diuerting it self from him, by the precipitation of these Marriages
with Spain, shall leave unto him alone the burden and charge of all such
affairs and differences, as yet remain in Christendom undecided; howsoever
notwithstanding his Majesty is not ignorant of the advantage, which elsewhere
is offered unto him by this alienation, if he were a Prince ambitious to win
unto him self alone the good will and friendship of all those ancient Allies,
which by this action seem abandoned, if he alone should not enterprise the
managing of their affairs, as he will never be wanting either by assistance
or counsel, to effect the same, when necessity shall require. But being not
able on his part so slightly to forget and renounce the ancient correspondence
and Conjunction, which he has hitherto maintained with this Crown, he is
willing to use all care and means for the preservation of it in its own
estate, before he change his course, or address himself to new counsels, if
he be not thereunto constrained by this sudden alteration.

And this is it that his Majesty has charged me, thus freely to represent
these foresaid considerations unto your Majesty, beseeching you to accept and
embrace this his advice, even as he presents it unto you, that is to say, with
his true and ancient affection for the good of your Person and State, and the
zeal he bears unto the weal public of Christendom, that you would be
pleased so to dispose of your resolutions hereupon, in this most weighty
occasion, that his Majesty may enjoy the contentment, and you the fruit which
he earnestly desires.

A Declaration made by his Majesty's Ambassador of Great Britain unto the
French King, and the Queen his Mother, concerning an Oration made by the
Cardinal of Perron, in the late general Assembly of the Estates at Paris.
SIr, the King my Master, (having seen a certain Oration, made in the
Assembly of your States General, held lately in this City, and since published
by Mons. the Cardinal of Perron, whereof he himself has sent a Copy unto his
Majesty) cannot sufficiently wonder at the licentiousness, and deprauation of
this age, animated with such audacity by the speeches and writings of a person
of that quality, who, to overthrow a wholesome proposition, made in the third
Chamber of the said States, for preservation of the life and authority of
Kings, under pretense of maintaining the interest and rights of the Pope, does
not only expose and lay open as a prey, the life and States of Princes, by the
doctrine maintained in the said Oration, but also does unworthily subject the
Crown of his own King, to the tutelage and authority of the Sea of Rome; and
thirdly, does send forth, without any respect, diverse reproaches and injurious
inuectiues against the Person and Government of the King my Master.

First therefore, his Majesty complains, and takes in ill part, that the said
Cardinal, in diverse places of this speech, publicly maintains, that a King
by the Law of God may fall from his Right, and cease to be acknowledged as a
King. That a Pope or Council has authority, particularly in cases of Heresy
or Apostafy, to depose Kings, and absolve Subjects of their oath of
Allegiance, and that consequently their Subjects may enterprise against them.
Which were not only to put the State and Temporal dignity of Kings, into the
hands and disposing of the Pope, but also disobedience into the hearts of their
Subjects, and a knife into the hands of Assassines, to execute upon their
Sacred persons, the decrees of a will transported either by error or malice
unto their ruin; whereof, within these five and twenty years, this Kingdom
has felt too too lamentable and remarkable effects.

Secondly, the said Cardinal, applying this execrable Maxim, in particular
unto France, maintains, that it has always been received and authorized
here, yea, sometimes for crimes of Religion, less weighty then Heresy or
Apostafie: And if any hold the contrary, the Popes do but tolerate the same for
the good of the Churches peace, conditionally that they hold it as doubtful,
and Problematicall, and not affirm it contradictorie to the word of God; by
which means, your Majesty's Life remains continually exposed to the same
danger and enterprises, that your two Predecessors felt.

Thirdly, his Majesty finds himself greatly offended in particular, by the
language, that the said Cardinal uses of him and his actions, chiefly, that
under pretense of gratifying his person, he ranks him (as much as in him
lies) in the number of Pagans, commending him only for his virtues, Moral
and Natural, without attributing unto him any Christianity at all; wherein his
Majesty glories principally.

Secondly, he accuses him of malice and faction, affirming that he has
enterprised to sow Schism and division in this assembly of the Estates, and in
the States of this Kingdom, endeavoring thereby, to bring in the same Article
and oath, which himself imposes on his own subjects, and which is worst of
all, describes him in his Government, as if he were a bloody Tyrant, and as if
no sort of torments could be devised, which he inflicteth not upon his
Catholic Subjects, whom he presents sighing, and as it were, breathles under
the yoke of persecution; and at the end of this discourse (by way of
Antithesis) says, that, God be thanked, the French are not under a King that
makes Martyrs. Inferring thereby, that the King of great Britain is so
cruel and unmerciful, as he takes pleasure in the effusion of the blood of
Innocents.

But his Majesty being content to trample under his feet, all these
opprobries and injuries, which concern but his own particular, stands not
upon any reparation with the Cardinal, but only esteems himself obliged,
and should think himself defective and wanting in that, which God and nature
has made him to be, if he did not testify unto the full, the sensible
apprehension, which he herein has, touching the honor, safety, and dignity
of Kings in general; which the said Cardinal by this Maxim and pernicious
speech of his, does abase and subject to the disposing of another.

This is that which his Majesty has commanded me lively, and seriously to
remonstrate unto this State, to the end, that your Majesty's, and my Lords of
your Counsel, opening your eyes to see and apprehend (as is requisite) the
scandal, danger, and pernicious consequence of this doctrine, as well in
general to all Christendom, as to the State of France in particular, may
speedily provide a forcible remedy for the choking of the seed hereof. And
more particularly, his Majesty out of the impression of that hearty and
sincere amity, which was between him and the late King, whose loss he daily
deplores, and whose memory he honors with all respect in his heart, has
charged me to show and call to your Majesty's remembrance, that during the life
of the said King, they contracted this amiable accord, and brotherly agreement,
between them in such sort, that when it should please God to take unto him one
of the two, the Suruiuor should undertake as Father and Protector of the
children of the predeceased.

And for this cause, his Majesty (desiring to acquit himself of this
obligation and duty, which he bears to the remembrance of him, whom he so
faithfully loved during his life) cannot but declare the lively feeling and
commiseration, which he has of the miserable and perilous estate of your
Majesty his most dear Brother, which is continually in danger, if the
doctrine of the Cardinal be received and allowed in France.

And therefore his Majesty, for the discharage of his conscience, and duty of
his quality, desires, and requires this state, openly to manifest to the view
and knowledge of all the world, (by public and rigorous suppression of the
oration of the said Cardinal, and by a solemn decree touching the same) their
disauowing and condemning of this new and accursed doctrine, to the end, that
by this declaration, the licentious Spirits of your subjects may the better be
kept in the duty of their fidelity and obedience

A Letter from the French KING, to the Prince of CONDE.
COVSIN; I have oftentimes given you to understand the desire which I had, that
you should accompany me in my voyage which I intend to make into Guyenne, for
the accomplishing of my Marriage, and have invited you to prepare ^our self
for the same, and to repair unto me for that purpose: I have also made known
unto you my good meaning touching some points, whereof you desired, before your
return, to be informed, as well concerning the affairs general, as others,
having to that effect sent diverse times unto you Mons. de Villeroy, who is with
you at this present, by whom also you might have been certified, and assured,
of my affection and good will, as also of the Queens my Mother, toward you.
Notwithstanding hitherto, I cannot know your intent in this business, having
yet had nothing but delays on your part. In the mean time being forced to
take my iourny, I send Mons. de Pont Chartrain my Counselor and Secretary of
State in those parts, with the said Mons. de Villeroy, ^o^signifie unto you,
that my resolution is to begin my said voyage upon Saturday, the first of the
next Month, without any further delay, and to desire you again in my behalf,
to come and accompany me, and there to take the place which is due to your
quality and birth; or to declare your mind in the presence of the said Mons.
de Pont Chartrain, if (contrary to that hope I have ever had of you) you intend
to make refusal, or difficulty, and deny me this content, to the end that he
may bring me certain intelligence of your intentions, being the principal
cause of his voyage: referring my self therefore unto that, which the said
Mons. de Villeroy, and he, shall say unto you in my behalf, Cousin, I pray to
God to have you in his blessed protection.

Written from Paris the 26. of July, 1615. Signed LOVIS, and underneath, de
Lomenye.

The Prince of CONDE his answer unto the KING.
SIR, having understood by your Letters, which your Majesty vouchsafed to
write unto me, by Mons. de Pont Chartrain, the 26. of this Month, the speedy
resolution which you have to undertake your voyage into Guyenne, and the
command it pleases your Majesty to impose on me, to go and accompany you in
the same, I judged that this departure so hasty (without order first given to
the affairs of your State, and provision for the disorders which have been
represented unto you, both by your States general, as also your Court of
Parliament of Paris) was but a co^tinuation of the ill counsel of those, which
are the Authors thereof, whom heretofore I have forborne to name in my most
humble Remonstrances, being not willing to displease you, Sir, nor the Queen
your Mother, hoping that they would at length have ceased to abuse your
Majesty's goodness. But seeing that they continue to make use of your
authority, for pretext and covert of their own pernicious designs, and
violent counsels too manifest to be now doubted of, and too public to be
tolerated and suffered any longer, seeing they tend to the subversion of your
State, the weakening of your Crown, and the ruin of those of your Blood and
other Princes, and Officers of your Crown, and principal Lords of your
Kingdom. I am constrained, Sir, after long patience, to present unto your
Majesty (in all humility and respect which a most humble Subject owes unto his
Prince) the just reasons which detayne and hinder me, from rendering obedience
to your command. I will declare therefore unto your Majesty, that when I
withdrew my self to Chreil, you being pleased to send thither unto me Mons. de
Villeroy, to command me on your behalf to come unto you, with promise made
unto me, that your Majesty would give good order unto the public affairs of
your Kingdom: I made answer, that (having been eight Months at Paris, where
I saw the beginning, proceeding, and issue of the Assembly of the States, such
as it was, the course which was taken to suborne and pervert the Deputies, and
frustrate their Counsels and resolutions, the Parliament abused, and unworthily
handled, for endeavoring the service of your Majesty; my life, and the life of
diverse other Princes and Lords of quality endangered, because I freely with
them declared my advice in your Council, touching your service and the welfare
of your State;) I say, my answer was, that I could not return either with
dignity or safety, until it had pleased your Majesty to provide for the
reformation of your Council, and those public disorders, contained in the
Declarations of your Parliament. Whereupon, your Majesty being pleased to send
again unto me the said Mons. de Villeroy to Clermont, with more ample
authority then he had the first voyage, we conferred together of the
reformation of your foresaid Council, and of those Orders which he had in
charge to show unto me; and as touching the aduices of the Parliament, I
reserved to make known unto him my intent, until that I had conferred with,
and taken the advice of other Princes, Officers of your Crown, and Lords, who
concur and agree in the same opinion with me, and stand no less affected to
your service, the good of your State, and the establishment of your Crown,
even as the said Mons. de Villeroy has showed unto your Majesty, who taking in
good part that, which he had begun to treat of, thought good yet again to
send him back to the same place, where the same morning of his arrival, we
were already entered into conference concerning the foresaid Remonstra^ces, in
such sort, that the affairs seemed to be brought to a good point, when the
said Mons. de Pont Chartrain arrived, who delivered unto me your Majesty's
Letters, and declared unto me your speedy departure, which depriues the
Co^monaltie of that fruit they expected by the issue of this Conference, and
makes the affairs (which we were in hope to have compassed) impossible to be
effected before the same, by reason of the suddenness thereof, and by this
means increases the disorders that are in your State; the Authors whereof, I
am forced to name unto your Maiestic, viz. the Marquess d'Ancre, and his Wife,
the Chancellor, the Cheualier of Silleny, Dole, and Bulion, who only were
dessigned in the remonstrances of the Parliament; upon whom I most humbly
beseech your Majesty publicly to execute justice, and to ordain, that the
complaints made against their actions and behauiours, may be verified and
admitted; and also, that it may be proceeded against them, according to the
ordinary and accustomed manner, as also concerning the murder committed upon
the person of Mons. de Prouuille, Sergeant Mayor of the Town of Amiens, by an
Italian soldier of the Garrison of the Cittadell, appointing that he be
delivered into the hands of the ordinary Judges, to draw his Indictment,
according as so wicked a fact does deserve: And until that order for the
reformation of your Counsel be taken and effected, the Declarations of the
Court examined, the disorders of the same prevented, and punishment inflicted
upon the persons therein denoted, whom at this present I name unto your
Majesty, as also upon the Italian soldier; I most humbly beseech you to
excuse me, if I attend you not in this your voyage; which otherwise I would
do, and readily will do, if it please your Majesty, before your departure,
to provide for these things; being always willing to testify by my obedience
unto your Majesty, that I am

Sir, Your most humble, and most obedient subject and servant, H. DE BOVRBON.
