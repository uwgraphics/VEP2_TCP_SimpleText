By the Queen
THe Queen's Majesty understanding, that where of late the piece of gold
called the Pistolet was made Current at five shyllynges and ten pence, and
not above: Since that time diverse of her subjects of ignorance have and be
daily much deceived, taking and receiving certain other pieces of strange
Coins in stead of Pistolettes for five shyllynges and ten pence, which in
deed were never taken ne used for Pistolettes, nor do hold in value so much
as the very Pistolettes do, whereby all persons receauyng the same in that
value, are deceived, and sustain evident loss: Does therefore by this
Proclamation notify to all manner of persons, that by the name or value of
Pistolettes, none shall be current within her dominions, but only four several
pieces and Coins hereafter pourtraicted and stamped. That is to say: The
first and second being of the king of Spaynes Coin, the third of Venize, and
the fourth of Florence: Which several pieces of gold being not
counterfaicted, her Majesty does only allow to be current as Pistolettes, and
at the value of five shyllynges and ten pence, and not above.

And for that many persons have received of late time diverse other strange
Coins upon ignorance as Pistolettes: Her Majesty is pleased to give to every
person that shall bring any of the same into her myntes at London, the just
value that the same shall hold in gold.

Anno. 1560. 2. Nouembris. The second year of her Majesty's reign. God save
the Queen.
