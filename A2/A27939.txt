An Advertisement.
THese are to assure the Reader, That that this Paraphrastical Translation of
the Psalms is the genuine Work and Product of the late Reverend Mr. Richard
Baxter, and left (together with the Preface and the annexed Hymns) completed
by him, and written with his own hand fairly and accurately for the Press. The
Author was well known to multitudes, and famed deservedly for his eminent
Knowledge, Judgment, Godliness, and Utterance, and for all things constituent
of an exemplary Christian, and for the extraordinariness of his Ministerial
Unction, Diligence, Faithfulness, and Success. Singing of Psalms he called, and
used as his Recreation. When his sleep was intermitted or removed in the Night,
he then sang much, and relished this course and practice greatly well: And on
the Lord's days (whilst with me in the free will Offerings of his Ministerial
assistance in Charter-house-Yard for betwixt four and five Years, where at my
House he preached his last Sermon, and in his own House near to mine, he
breathed his last breath) he thought the Lord's-day's Service very defective
without some considerable time's being spent in this Divine Melodious Exercise
of singing Psalms, wherein his heart was warm and cheerful. And I have heard
him say in sense equivalent unto the import of these words, That he believingly
expected that his Angelical Convoy would conduct him through all the
intermediate Regions to his determined Mansion in his Heavenly Father's House
with most melodious Hallelujahs, or with something equally delightful. For what
Angels are, how they appear to separated Souls, and after what manner they
express their Joys and Praises, are things as yet beyond our reach and
knowledge. But that there are such things as Public, Solemn, and Harmonious
Praises offered unto the Great Jehovah and the enthroned Lamb by the whole
Heavenly Chorus, I see no cause to doubt. But at the manner of this great
Performance I have not confidence enough to guess, much less dare I
dogmatically or magisterially determine: For I forget not what Mr. B. said
repeatedly to me, and with great accents of a pathetical concern upon his
heart, We know nothing. We know nothing. And this when near his end.

As to the Work it self, when I pressed him to the Publication of it, he
modestly replied, that others had done so well, as that he thought his own Work
thence less needful and acceptable. But after that, he committed it to my
perusal, telling me, that his great solicitousness was about reaching and
representing David's inspired sense aright. And he told me, that he was most
for that wherein there was least of Man, and most of God: So that if he be
outdone in Poetry by others, yet perhaps none will be found in an Essay of
this kind more genuinely breathing David's sense and spirit, nor any thing more
fitted to the genuine gravity and decorum of this chearing and edifying
Ordinance than what here is offered. And I hope it will not fare the worse for
being a part of that useful Mantle which he left, when God remomoved him hence.

As to (his other Works, and particularly) his Life; did those who earnestly
expect it, know its bulk and worth as I do, as on the one hand their Appetites
would be sharper, because of the Rational and Judicious Accounts he gives of
God's gracious dealing with his Soul, with the stupendous instances and
methods of his peculiar Providence toward that, with much more that I could
pertinently hint: So on the other hand, none would severely censure me as
delatory or neglectful, that knew my pressing hindrances, and the greatness of
the Work. But I assure the Reader, that all meet care, and have, and
faithfulness in this Affair, and in the seasonable production of his other
Works, in all observance of his own Orders and Directions communicated to me by
his own word and writing, shall be pursued by

London, August 2. 1692. Matthew Sylvester.

THE PREFACE.
1. POetry (as all inferior things) has its conveniences and its
inconveniences. The inconveniences are, that matter is often forced too much to
stoop to words and syllables; and that conciseness keeps the matter from a full
perception with any but well-prepared understandings. The conveniences are,
that is spares words, avoiding the redundancies and repetitions which Oratory
is usually guilty of; and teaches exactness of expression. And that the
delight of Harmony (except in persons whose fantasy is herein impotent and
maimed, or minds diseased by Prejudice or Melancholy) does make the fantasy
helpful to the mind; and as it expresses affections, so does it raise them.

2. The Tempter knowing this, has made great use of lascivitus, vain, and
foolish Poetry, yea, and malignant, to corrupt more the minds that are already
corrupt and vain, and to prepossess them against better things. And God knowing
it, has by his Spirit indicted sacred Hymns and Psalms, both for his public
and private Worship, and excitation of holy desires and delights: Which of old
was done with the greatest helps that the Musical and Vocal melody could give.

The singing of Morning Hymns to Christ was the Note by which Pliny describes
to Trajan the persecuted Christians in his time, in their Houses and their
Meetings (then called Conventicles;) of which see the Apology of the Church of
England, Chap. 1. (and specially Justin's and Tertullian's Apologies.)

And Godly Families have still been differenced from the ungodly by open
singing the Praises of God, when the other sing wanton and idle Songs. Good
Christians will not (among Christians at least) be ashamed, that such Psalms of
Praise be heard by their Neighbors into the Streets, when Players, or
Ballad-singers are not ashamed* more openly to sing amorous, foolish, ungodly,
or abusive Songs. Our Psalms in Meter were set forth by Authority, to be used
both in Church and House, laying apart all ungodly Songs and Ballads, etc.

3. Some stumble at the singing of David's Psalms, because there are many words
not suited to their case. But, 1. May they not as well scruple reading or
saying them in Prose? Singing them in Meter, is no more an owning of all we
say, as our case, than saying or reading them is. And by that reason they must
not say, the Songs of Moses, the Book of Job, Canticles, Lamentations, or the
Gospel-Hymns, or Scripture-Prayers. 2. That may be recited as the common case
of the Church, yea, or as a Narration of his case that wrote them, which is not
spoken as of our selves. 3. And if this satisfy not, such may choose at home
Psalms suitable to them, and in the Church be silent at the words which they
dare not speak.

4. Some are stumbled that David's Psalms have so little about the Life to
come, and speak with so great concernedness about Prosperity and Adversity
here, and especially that he says so much through almost all the Book against
his Enemies, and the Oppression and Cruelties of wicked men, and his great
danger of them, and sufferings by them, even cursing them and their Posterity.

Answ. As to this, it must be considered, 1. That it is most certain that not
only David, but the Jews generally, except the Sadducees, believed the
Immortality of the Soul, and the Rewards and Punishments of the other Life: And
many passages in the Psalms prove it. And so do the Histories of Enoch and
Elias, and Readiness seeking to dead Samuel, and the raising of diverse dead men;
and Herod thought that John was risen, and others that Christ was one of the
old Prophets. All which had been impossible, had not the soul survived. He that
asked Christ, what he should do to inherit eternal Life* spoke but on the
Principle of the Jews Faith.

2. But the future state of souls being not near so fully revealed under the
Law, as it was after by Christ, who brought life and immortality more to light
by the Gospel; God saw it meet to give men under the Law more motives to
Obedience and against Sin (both by his word and works) from outward Mercies and
Punishments, than under the Gospel, which much more teaches us the Doctrine of
the Cross.

3. And David was a King, whose concerns therefore were public, even the
Churches and Kingdoms as well as his own. And all Christians must be greatly
affected with public Church concerns. And as he was a Type of Christ, his
Enemies are cursed as Christ's Enemies; which yet he seems often to do but
Prophetically.

4. And it must be noted, that it is not their damnation that is his usual
curse and wish, (though he foretell it of the impenitent) but their destruction
on earth, for the Churches deliverance by the utter extirpation of them and
their Posterity.

5. And though Christ teach us to love our enemies, and bless them that curse
us, and pray for them that hate and persecute us, yet he forbids us not to
desire deliverance from them, nor to hate their Diabolical Lying, Malignity and
Cruelty, and Enmity to the Gospel, and to Obedience to God It Is a great Duty to
note the universal War in all Lands and Ages between the Serpent's and the
Woman's seed, and to know that Brutishness first, and Cainism and Diabolism
next, are the Serpent's Progency, as naturally prospering in corrupted
graceless men, as Maggots in a Carcass. And they that live in an Age and Land
where these prevail, and are in power, will have a sensible Commentary of
David's Psalms: And in Prisons, and in Wars and Fields of Blood, and Torments,
many have confessed, that now they understood the Psalms of David, which they
never soundly understood before.

6. Lastly, Though David say not so much of the Life to come as we could wish,
he says very much of the way to it, and the necessary means. He knew that
Heaven is ready for us, if we be but ready for it: And all that must be done
for it by us is in this short hasty life: And as a Traveller does not all the
way talk and think so much of his Journeys end, as of all passages in his way,
and yet does all this for the end; so a good Christian that lays out his care
and labor in obeying God's Word, and avoiding sin, and doing all the good he
can in the World, and this in faith and hope of Heavenly Felicity, does better
than be that neglects present means on pretense of only contemplating the end.

We are all in our Baptism listed in Christ's Army as Cross-bearers, against
the Devil, World, and Flesh: And he that lamenteth not the successes of Satan,
and the greatness of his Kingdom, the vastness of the Dominions of Heathens and
Infidels, the fewness of Christians, the greater paucity of those that are
Christians indeed, sincere and serious, that are more for Heaven than for
Earth, and mortify the Lusts of the Flesh by the Spirit, and how woefully Satan
has prevailed to make Hypocritical, Nominal Christians, more false, malignant,
and bloodthirsty than many Turks and Heathens, and how lamentably in many
Christian Nations he has so far got Power and Ministry on his side, as to be
the most effectual hinderers of the serious Practice of that Christian Religion
which themselves profess. I say, he that is not sensible of this, is not a
genuine Disciple of Christ, and a skilful Soldier in his Army. And he that is,
will understand David's Psalms; but yet Christ will teach him, that it is by
Faith and Patience that Christians must be more than Conquerours, while they
are killed all the day long, and counted as sheep to the slaughter, while
nothing can separate them from the love of God.

5. Quest. But are not the Psalms sufficiently by Translation and Meter,
already fitted to the Churches use? What need any more help of yours?

Answ. I am not so vain as to expect that my Version should be of public
Church-use: Others have done well in several respects; I delight to read them,
and love and honor all the Authors. I wrote for my own use, not intending any
Publication, and that in my Restraint, when my soul's great Concerns made it my
chief and necessary Employment: When it was my interest and daily work to speak
to God. And I found the Psalms so fitted to my use, as if they had been
purposely made for me. When I used not to sleep one minute is many Nights,
through pain and disturbance, these Psalms were my recreation: And when
Meditations of the same things still grow customary and dull, Psalms,
especially of Praise, revived and exhilerated my Soul, both Night and Day. And
we are bound while we we have time to do good to all men, and Grace as well as
Nature is communicative: And Charity to Souls is more excellent than to Bodies.
I have no hope of reaching the Seraphick strain of Mr. George Sandys,
(especially on Job.) But he has not fitted his Metres to the usual Tunes, so
that to the Vulgar they are almost useless. Bishop King's are very good, but
the unusual-way of making the Rythme of the next Verse meet, makes it by
disuse unpleasant to the most. Mr. White's, the Scots, and Mr. Row's his
Second, are an excellent Translation of the Hebrew Text: But the ear desires
greater melody, than their strict Versions will allow. Mr. William Barton has
done excellently, of whom I have made much use: But his great labor for
Rythmes has made it (though more excellent to some, yet) less grave, and less
taking to many others. Mr. Woodford's, and Sandy's, and Patrick's, and
Davision's, and some others, that have taken a larger Paraphrastical liberty
than I have done, are much more pleasant, and useful to many. But when I
perused all these and others for my own daily devotion and delight, I found
none of them that wholly answered my expectations. I could not rest in the
unpleasant harshness of the strictest Versions; seeing Psalms lose their ends
that lose their affecting pleasure. I durst not venture on the Paraphrastical
great liberty of others; I durst make Hymns of my own, or explain the
Apocryphal; but I feared adding to God's Word, and making my own to-pass for
God's. Yet I scrupled not giving the sense of the Hebrew Text more fully than
our strict Translation has done, by the addition of Adjectives and Adverbs;
because oft-times a Hebrew word does signify more than one Greek, Latin, or
English word can open, without such an Explicatory Adjective or Adverb. So that
my labor has been both to avoid the harshness and unpleasantness of strict
Versions, and the boldness of copious Paraphrases. And as I did it for my own
use* under my constant dying pains, and solitude, so I leave it for the secret
or Family-use of those with whose Condition and spirits it best suiteth,
without disparaging the more excellent Labors of any others. That is best for
some (in private) that is not so for others.

6. I have in the end showed why I have done that which no man ever did before
me, to fit the same Psalms to various Tunes and Measures, longer and shorter,
specially to gratify them by variety, that are used to be dulled with
Customariness in the same; and to give them Expository Notes, who use but
Obscure Abbreviation and Conciseness in words. And I hope the Printer will make
so visible a difference in the Characters, that the additional words shall
stumble none.

7. I have added the Apocryphal Hymns, 1. For their Excellency and Usefulness.
2. To confute them that think that no forms of Worship but those found in
Scripture may be used, or imposed. 3. To confute the Casuists, that tell the
World that we are against all such Liturgick Forms.

Those that published the Old Church-Psalms, added many useful Hymns, that are
still printed with the Psalms in Meter. And doubtless Paul means not only
David's Psalms, when he bids men sing with grace in their hearts, Psalms, and
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs: Yea, it is past doubt, that Hymns more suitable to
Gospel Times, may and ought to be now used: And if used, they must be
premeditated; how else* shall Congregations sing them? And if premeditated,
they must be some way imposed; How else shall the Congregations all join in the
same? I plead not for Imposing by cruel Penalties, nor laying the Churches Love
and Communion on a Tune or Meter. There are three sorts of Imposing such
Liturgick Forms; of Psalms, Praise, or Prayer. 1. One is, when the Pastor is
left free to his own discretion, but yet his words of Prayer or Praise are a
Form to the Congregation, which he imposes on them by the Authority of his
Office, obliging them to concur. For if every one speak there his own words, it
will be liker a Bedlam than a Church. 2. A Second way of Imposing, is, when the
United Churches of a Nation, for Edification and amiableness of Concord, agree
all on one Translation, Version, Meter, or form of Words: Which is useful,
First, when Heresies are abroad to keep them out of the public Worship. And
Secondly, that people may know beforehand what the Worship of the Church is in
which they are to join, and may not say, We know not what Worship you will
offer to God, till the Minister have spoken, and the words be past; And so
there may be as many sorts of Worship as there are speakers. And Thirdly,
Foreknowledge may make amiable Concord easy to them. And no doubt such an
Agreement of Churches is good and amiable.

3. And the Third way of Imposing is by the Laws of Christian Magistrates. And
who can say that they may not Command that amiable Concord, which the Churches
might of themselves agree in, should the Magistrate leave them to their choice.
I do not say, that Rulers should hang, burn, or ruin all persons that by
weakness are against a commanded Version, Meter, or Tune, or Form. But good
Christians should abhor all such vain scruples, and self-conceits, and affected
singularity and disobedience, as are against the sweet Concord of the Church.

8. It is a doleful case that Satan by subtilty has so far prevailed with many
honest Christians, as to place their Religion in Negative Superstition, that
they may avoid Positive Superstition. Touch not, taste not, handle not, kneel
not, stand not up, bow not, use not those Forms which the common Congregations
use, etc. And many by this are tempted to think that they are holyer than
others, because they avoid by erroneous singularity the lawful words and
actions of others. And they think men Profane and Carnal, that are not as
superstitiously singular as they: Not comparing the Men, but the Cause, I think
it much less blameable to say with the Pharisee, God, I thank thee that I am
not as other men, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican:
Than to say, God, I thank thee that I am not as other Christians, that pray in
a prescribed Form, or use Responses, or Communicate in the Parish-Churches, or
kneel at the Lord's Table, or stand up at the Creed or Gospel, etc. The
difference between these two cases is very notable. The first sort are proud of
that which is good. The second take conceited erroneous Singularity for a mark
of Piety. Not that we should commit the least sin for compliance with any, but
as Augustine resolved in Lawful Customs to do as the Church does where he
comes, so should all the lovers of Peace and Concord. But (as the late Lord
Chief Justice, Sir Matthew Hale* in his Judgment of Religion and its
corruptions (who was no Schismatic, and whose M.S. I keep) says) The
Christian Religion is a plain and holy thing, fit for the Salvation and the
Concord of all that sincerely own it: But men's Additions have proved the
Corrupters and Dividers: And while one sort make a Religion of their own
Inventions, and think that it is no good Church Government that makes not some
new Religion, fitter for men's Consciences: And another sort thinks that it is
sin to do any thing that is not in Scripture, which men command us; and so all
Sects are turned superstitious, and make Duties and Sins which God never made:
Instead of God's Religion, which is plain, saving, and uniting, the World is
torn by men's Dividing Engines, supposed by ignorance to be the means to heal
it; even by the Positive Superstition of one Party, and the Negative
Superstition of the other. The sense of their Error that refuse David's Psalms,
and separate from all Churches that have any Imposed Forms of Liturgy, has
occasioned this digression.

I confess my Meter, and Tunes, and Apocryphal Hymns are not in words found in
the Scriptures, nor are the words of my ordinary Preaching and Prayers there.
But they are commanded by the general Precepts of the Scripture: Let all be
done to Edification, and Exhort one another in Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual
Songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, Col. 3.16. What sweeter
foretaste of the Heavenly Everlasting Praises? There is no Exercise that I had
rather live and dye in, than singing Praises to our Redeemer and Jehovah, while
I might in the Holy Assemblies, and now when I may not, as Paul and Silas in my
Bonds, and my dying pains, which are far heavier than my Bonds. Lord Jesus
receive my Praise and Supplications first, and lastly, my departing Soul. Amen.

What is the sum of my desires?
To KNOW and LOVE and LIVE TO GOD,
To PLEASE HIM, and BE PLEASED IN HIM
To long for Heaven, and bear his Rod.

PSALM I.
To the Tune of Old 100.
1 Blessed is the man who does avoid
The Counsel of ungodly mates;
Who stands not in the sinners way,
Nor sits in the scorners seats.
2 But in the holy Law of God
Does choose and place his chief delight;
And (with sincere obedient heart)
Meditates in it day and night.
3 We shall be like the prosp'ring tree
That planted by a rivers side,
In season yields plenteous fruit,
Whose leaf does always green abide.
4 The Lord will prosper this man's work,
But the ungodly are not so,
But like rejected worthless chaff,
Which every wind drives to and fro.
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand,
But fall, when judgment gives their doom;
Nor sinners in the righteous men's
Blessed assembly ever come.
6 Because the way of righteous men,
The Lord with approbation knows;
But the way of ungodly men
To their own just destruction goes.
PSALM II.
1 WHy do the rebel Nations rage,
And [People] hatch a vain design?
2 The Kings of Earth do set themselves,
And [wicked] Rulers do combine,
Against God and his Christ they say,
Let us cast off [and break] the bands,
3 And cast away those cords (his Laws)
Which tie up hearts [and tongues] and hands*
4 But he whose Glory is in Heaven,
Their [Rebel] Counsels shall deride,
Their purposes the Lord will scorn,
Their [boasting] tongues he will divide.
5 Then shall he speak in wrath to those
His [gentle] yoke who could not bear;
His sore displeasure shall them vex
When they this [Divine] Sentence hear.
6 Yet have I set my chosen King
On Sion's [Sacred] Hill to reign.
His Kingdom's Glory I Will declare,
And God's decree [I will] proclaim.
7 The Lord Almighty uttered it,
And he [himself] thus said to me,
Thou art my Son, and this same day
Have I [rais'd and] begotten thee.
8 Ask me, and I Will the Heathen give
For thy [enlarg'd] Inheritance;
And to possess the utmost parts
Of [all the] earth I Will thee advance.
9 The Rebels with an Iron rod
Thou shall [bruise and] asunder shake,
Like brittle earthen vessels them
Thou shall [dash and] in pieces break.
10 Be wise now, O ye mortal Kings;
Learn [all ye] Judges of the earth.
11 Serve God with true Religious fear,
Join [awful] trembling with your mirth.
12 Now kiss the Son, left in his wrath
You [die and] perish from the way,
If once his anger kindled be,
[Then all] who trust him, blessed are they.
PSALM III.
1 LOrd, how are they increased
That are mine enemies,
Many there be that trouble me,
And do against me rise.
2 Many say of my soul,
He has no help in God;
3 But thou my shield and glory art,
And liftest up my head.
4 I with my mournful voice
Unto the Lord did cry,
And he out of his holy place
Did hear me graciously.
5 I laid me down and slept;
I waked and rose again,
For it is God in whom I trust
That does me still sustain.
6 And though ten thousand foes
Were round about me laid,
(While God is for me, and my help)
Why should I be afraid.
7 Arise and save me, Lord,
My God the Cheek-bone struck
Of all my foes; and wicked men's
Devouring teeth did break.
8 To save his chosen does
Belong to God alone;
Thy blessing shall for evermore
Thy people rest upon.
PSALM IV.
1 O Hear me when to thee I call,
God of my [help and] righteousness:
Have mercy on me, hear my prayer,
Thou sav'dst me in [my great] distress.
2 O sons of men, how long will ye
[The great] God's glory vilify?
How long will ye love vanity,
And seek and trust a [flatt'ring] lie?
3 But know that God does for himself
The Godly [choose and] set apart;
The Lord will hear when I to him
Do call [in faith] with fervent heart.
4 Fear God therefore: Take heed of sin:
[Use to] consider with your hearts:
In secret silence of the night
In bed, when sleep [from you] departs.
5 Offer to God the sacrifice
Of Love and [sincere] righteousness,
And then put all your trust in him
To save [and help] you in distress.
6 Deceived men enquire for good,
[But where] to find it cannot tell:
Lord, let the glory of thy face
Shine forth [on us] and we are well.
7 Thy Love and Grace into my heart
Has put more joy and [solid] peace,
Then all their wealth will them afford,
When Corn and Wine [do most] increase.
8 I will both lay me down in peace,
And hope for [quiet] rest and sleep,
Trusting alone that thou Lord wilt
Me and my dwelling [safely] keep.
PSALM V.
1 GIve ear unto my words, O Lord,
My [doleful] meditation weigh,
2 And hear my voice, my King, my God,
For unto thee I [cry and] pray.
3 At Morning thou shall hear my voice,
My [Morning] Prayer I Will direct
To thee, O Lord; and looking up
Thy [gracious] answer will expect.
4 For thou, the Holy God, do not
In [any] wickedness delight,
Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
5 Or [wicked] fools stand in thy sight.
6 Thou hate wicked workers all,
[And] Liars [all] thou will subvert;
The Lord abhors men of blood,
And the deceitful [tongue and] heart.
7 In thine abundant mercies I
Will in thy [sacred] house appear,
And towered thy holy temple I
Will worship thee in [holy] fear.
8 Lead me, Lord, in thy righteousness,
Before my watchful [envious] foe;
Before my face do thou make strait
The way wherein I [ought to] go.
9 Their mouth no credit does deserve,
[Their] inward [part] is wickedness,
Their throat is like an open grave,
Their tongues do [flattering] lies express.
10 By their own Counsels let them fall;
Destroy them [Lord, and] them expel
In their abundant sins; for they
Against thee [madly] did rebel.
11 Let all rejoice and shout for joy,
Who [firmly] put their trust in thee,
For them thou keep. Let them that love
Thy [Holy] Name still joyful be.
12 For thou, Lord, wilt the righteous bless,
And with thy [special] favor own;
Thou as a shield wilt him defend,
And with thy [loving-] kindness crown.
PSALM VI.
1 LOrd in thy wrath rebuke me not
I earnestly [do thee] desire,
(Though my great sin do it deserve)
Correct me not in [burning] ire.
2 Lord pity me a feeble wretch,
Whom [sin and] dolor weakened has;
O heal my pained flesh and bones,
Vexed by sin, and [by thy] wrath.
3 My guilty soul does bear its part
With [pained] flesh in sin and grief;
Lord do not overlong delay
To ease them [both] with [thy] relief.
4 Return, O Lord, deliver me;
Do not this [sinful] soul forsake,
Pity and save a humbled wretch,
For thy own [tender] mercies sake.
5 The lifeless Corpse in silent dust
Remember not thy [holy] name;
In darksome graves who give thee thanks*
Or do thy [glorious] praise proclaim.
6 My flesh and soul are tired out
With painful groans and [sinful] fears,
The night I spend in woeful moans,
And wash my bed [and Touch] with tears.
7 My feeble eyes do fail with grief,
Consumed by my [daily] woes,
Untimely dimness closes them,
Increased by my [cruel] foes.
8 But workers of iniquity
Shall all [with shame] from me depart;
For God does hear my tears and cries,
And will relieve my [grieved] heart.
9 He has, and will receive my suit;
Lord tame thy [servant's] enemies,
Turn them with humbling grief and shame,
Who [Truth and] Righteousness despise*
PSALM VII.
1 O Lord my God, in thee I trust,
[Me] from [my] persecutors save;
2 Deliver me, lest they me tear
Like Lions, and [there's] none [to] save.
3 Lord* if this ill deed I have done,
[And] guilty [be] of wickedness;
4 If I with hurt did him reward,
Who lived by me in [quiet] peace,
(Yea, Lord, thou know that I have
[Vs'd] kindly [and] delivered those
Who now are causelessly become
My [cruel] persecuting foes.)
5 Then let me foes me persecute,
And take my life; and [let them] thrust,
And tread me down on earth, and lay
My [name and] honor in the dust.
6 Rise, Lord, in wrath, lift up thy self,
Because of [all mine] enemies rage;
And for that right which thou command'st
Do thou thy [wakened] power engage.
7 So shall the peoples lovely crowd
[About] with praise encompass thee,
For their sakes therefore take thy seat
On high to [judge and] succor me.
8 The Lord shall all the people judge,
Do thou, O [Righteous] Lord, judge me;
According to my righteousness,
And [after] mine integrity.
9 O let the heinous wickedness
Of wicked [men] come to [an] end;
Thou, Lord, who try'st the hearts and reins,
The just do thou [stay and] defend.
10 Of God is my defense, who saves
Men upright in their [heart and] way;
11 As God does judge the just, so he
[With sin] is angry every day.
12 If men turn not, he will whet his sword;
The bow is [vent and] ready made,
The executing instruments
Of death he [also] has prepared.
13 Against the Persecutors he
His [sharpned] Arrows does ordain
For such as with iniquity
Do travel as [it were] in pain.
14 Mischief in secret they conceived,
And brought forth falls- [hood and] deceit;
15 They made a pit, and dug a ditch,
And are [themselves] fallen into it.
16 His mischief upon his own head
[In time] shall be returned home;
His violent dealing at the last,
[Down up-] on his own pate shall come.
17 I Will praise the Lord according to
His truth and [all his] righteous ways,
And to the name of God most high,
Sing joyful songs of [thanks and] praise.
PSALM VIII.
1 O Lord our Lord through all the earth,
How excellent is thy [Great] name,
Who have thy Glory high advanced
Above the [Heavens and] starry frame.
2 From Infants and from Childrens mouths
Thou [Wisdomes] power did ordain
For thy foes sake; that so thou might
The [cruel] wrath of them restrain.
3 When I consider well the Heavens,
Which thy own [hand and] power framed;
The Moon and the bright shining Stars,
All which [were by] thy word ordained.
4 Then say I, what is man, that thou
Of him have [daily] mindful been?
And what is the son of man, that thou
[So much] regard'st and visit'st him?
5 Thou made him little lower than
The [blessed] Angels in degree,
And have with honor crowned him,
And [with some] rays of Majesty.
6 Thou gave him dominion
Over [all] these [great] works of thy hand;
Thou have subjected all to him
To be at this [ruling] command.
7 The Pasture Flocks, the Oxen strong,
[Do all] to him obedience yield;
And thou subjectest unto him
The [very] wild beasts of the field;
8 The fowl that flies in the air,
[The] fish that in [the] seas do play,
And whatsoever through the deeps
Of the [great] Ocean makes its way.
9 Our Owner and our Governor
[Art thou] the Lord of this great frame,
How excellent through all the earth
Is thy most [Holy] Glorious name.
PSALM IX.
1 I Will praise the Lord with my whole heart,
Thy wonders I Will [abroad] proclaim:
2 With gladness I Will rejoice in thee,
[Most High] and sing unto thy name.
3 Mine enemies do turn their back,
They [fall and] perish at thy sight.
4 Thou sat'st a just Judge on thy Throne.
And have maintained my [Cause and] right.
5 The Heathen thou rebuked have,
The wicked [thou hast] overthrown;
Their very names thou have put out,
[Only] to be as odious known.
6 O Enemy, thy destroying work
Is now [at last] come to an end:
They ruined Cities, but to death
Their memory did [with them] descend.
7 But God for ever shall endure,
For Judgment [he hath] set his Throne:
8 He Will judge the world in righteousness,
In uprightness [he'll judge] each one.
9 The Lord will be a high defense
For those that are [by men] oppressed:
In times of trouble he will be
A refuge and a [secure] Rest.
10 And they that know thy Name, in Thee
Their confidence will [wholly] place,
For thou did never them forsake,
Who truly sought thy [saving] grace.
11 Sing Praises to the Lord most high,
Who does in [holy] Sion dwell;
The wondrous things which he has done,
Among the people [daily] tell.
12 He will at last enquire for blood,
And then [he will] remember them;
And surely he does not forget
The [mournful] cry of humble men.
13 Have mercy, Lord, think on my grief
[And wrong] which I from them sustain
Who hate me: Thou that liftest me
[Vp] from [the] gates of death again.
14 That in the gates of Sion's seed
I may show forth thy [Glorious] praise;
And in thy great salvation
I will [trust and] rejoice always.
15 The Heathen are sunk in the pit
Which they [themselves] for us had made;
And in the net which they had hid
[Justly] their own foot is ensnared.
16 The Lord is by the Judgment known,
Which he in wisdom [justly] wrought;
The wicked's hands did make the snare,
In which [at last] themselves are caught.
17 To be cast off and turned to Hell,
This is the wicked's [final] lot,
And all the Nations of the world
That God [with fear] remember not.
18 The needy (though a while distressed)
Shall not [by thee] be still forgot;
The expectations of the poor,
[Though long] deferred, yet perish not.
19 Rise, Lord, and let not men prevail,
Who trust in fraud or [worldly] might;
Let heathens and ungodly men
Be [even here] judged in thy sight.
20 Put senseless ones in fear, O Lord,
That the ungodly [Nations] then
May humbled be, and know themselves
To be but [feeble] dying men.
PSALM X.
1 WHy stand thou, Lord, as far off,
And seem [from us] thy self to hide,
2 In troublous times when wicked men
Do persecute [the poor] in pride.
But let these proud and wicked men
[Themselves] be taken and surpised,
Even in the same destructive trap
Which they [in craft] for us devised.
3 The wicked of his hearts desire
Does boast, in prosperous [worldly] state
The covetous worldling he does praise,
Whom yet the [righteous] Lord does hate.
4 The wicked puffed up with pride,
Is to such [sottish] folly brought,
That he disdains to seek the Lord,
God is not in his [bruitish] thought.
5 Hurtfulness is in all his ways,
[For] thine are [all] above his sight;
All that he takes for enemies
He puffs at with [scorn and] despite.
6 He says in his self-flattering heart,
[Surely] I never moved shall be;
My prosperous state shall not decay,
Nor shall I [ever] trouble see.
7 His mouth's with rage and cursing full,
And with deceit and [guileful] lies,
Under his wicked tongue is hatched
Mischief [falshood] and vanities.
8 He lurks in Towns and Villages
To [catch and] kill the innocent;
In secret his malicious eyes
Against the [helpless] poor are ben^.
9 He Lion-like lurks in his den,
And waits the [humbled] poor to take,
And drawn into his own made net,
Him as his [lawful] prey does make.
10 He crowcheth low, that so the poor
In his strong [cruel] paws may fall:
11 His heart says, God does not regard,
But [winks and] will not see at all.
12 Forget not humble men, O Lord;
Lift up thy hand, [for them] arise,
13 Because they think thou wilt not them judge,
[Therefore] the wicked thee despise.
14 Mischief and spite thou do behold,
[And with] thy hand wilt it repay.
The poor commits himself to thee,
Thou art the Orphans [help and] stay.
15 Break thou the arm of wicked men,
And [take down] those that evil be;
Seek out their wickedness, until
[Thou find] none's unrevenged by thee.
16 The Lord is King for evermore,
The heathen by his [mighty] hand
And wicked all are perished.
And cast out of his [holy] land.
17 The humble man's righteous desires
[O Lord] thou graciously did hear;
Thou will prepare and fix their hearts,
And [thou wilt] yield a hearing ear.
18 To judge and help the fatherless,
And the oppressed and [humble] poor,
That so these men of earth may vex
And terrify [the just] no more.
PSALM XI.
1 IN God I put my trust,
Why then in scorn say ye,
To God for help as silly birds,
Unto your mountain flee?
2 The wicked bend their bow,
Their arrows they prepare,
That in the dark they may them shoot
At those that upright are.
3 If by their violence
Foundations be destroyed,
What can the grieved righteous do
The ruins to avoid?
4 God in his Temple is;
The Lord's Throne is in Heaven;
His eyes behold, his eyelids try
The sons of mortal men.
5 The Lord the just man tries,
But he the wicked hates;
And him that loves violence
His soul abominates.
6 Snares, fire and brimstone he
On wicked men will rain:
This is the portion and the cup
That does for them remain.
7 For the just Lord does love
Just things as his delight,
And with a pleased countenance
Beholds the upright.
PSALM XII.
1 HElp, Lord, for upright godly men
[from us] are taken hence away;
And from among the sons of men
The faithful [daily] do decay.
2 Unto his neighbor every one
Don't speak with [lies and] vanity;
With a false double heart they talk,
And lips of [fraud and] flattery.
3 God will cut off all flattering lips,
[And] the [proud] tongue that speaks thus,
4 Our word shall stand; our tongue is ours,
What Lord is [Ruler] over us?
5 For the oppression of the poor,
And needy's sighs, I Will [now a-] rise,
And them in safety set, says God,
From those that them [with scorn] despise.
6 The words of God are words most pure;
Like [purest] silver fully tried
In earthen furnace, many times
Refined and [throughly] purified.
7 Lord, thou will thine save and preserve
For ever from this [wicked] race.
8 The wicked then are bold and brisk,
When vile men get in highest place.
PSALM XIII.
1 HOw long will thou forget me, Lord?
[O] shall it thus [for] ever be?
How long will thou displeasedly
Thus hide thy [pleased] face from me?
2 How long shall thoughts disturb my soul,
And [daily] grief my heart assail?
How long shall cruel enemies
[By pow'r] thus over me prevail?
3 Pity my case, O Lord my God,
[Hear me] and lighten thou mine eyes,
Left me as by fatal sleep,
Untimely [feared] death surprise.
4 Left my triumphing foes should say
We have prevailed [our work] it is done:
And those that trouble me rejoice,
[And boast] when I am overthrown.
5 But in thy tender mercy, Lord,
My [troubled] soul her trust does place;
O Let my raised hearty rejoice
In thy defense and [saving] grace.
6 Because the Lord has bounteously
Dealt well [with me] in every thing,
To him my saved thankful soul
Shall joyful [endless] praises sing.
PSALM XIV.
1 THe hearts and lives of wicked fools
Tell us they no God [truly] own:
Corrupt are they; their works are vile,
[Of them] that do good there is none.
2 Upon the worldly sons of men
From Heaven God looked [and searcht] abroad,
To see if any understood,
And seriously sought [after] God.
3 They wholly filthy are become,
They all [from him] aside are gone;
None of them lives to do good,
Of all these [wordly] men, not one.
4 Have all these men of wicked works
No [wit or] knowledge left at all?
Who eat my people up as bread,
On God they never [truly] call.
5 Yet often in sin they have great fear;
For God's among [and for] the just.
6 They shame the counsels of poor Saints,
Because to God they [seek and] trust.
7 O that our help from God were come!
When God brings back the [Captives] sad,
Then Jacob shall therein rejoice,
And Israel shall [in him] be glad.
PSALM XV.
1 LOrd, in thy Tabernacle
Who shall inhabit still?
And whom will thou receive to dwell
In thy most holy hill?
2 He that walks uprightly,
And works righteousness,
And the truth which is in his heart,
Does with his tongue express.
3 He that backbiteth not,
Nor does his neighbor hurt,
Nor yet against his neighbor does
Receive an ill report.
4 In whose discerning eyes
Vile persons are contemned,
But those that truly fear the Lord,
Does honor and commend.
His righteous oath and word
That keeps faithfully,
Although he made his covenant so,
That he does lose thereby.
5 On hurtful Usury
His money has not lent;
Nor takes a reward or brib.
Against the innocent.
He that these things observes,
Which God would have be done,
Shall never be by fraud or force
Moved and overthrown.
PSALM XVI.
1 LOrd keep me, for I trust in thee,
My refuge and my [chosen] part.
2 My soul by thy command has said
That thou my [Lord and] Savior art.
3 My goodness cannot profit thee,
But it may reach [to men] on earth;
To such as are my great delight,
Thy [precious] Saints of heavenly birth.
4 They that in any other trust
Do [their own] sorrows multiply;
Their Idols service I detest,
Their names I [hate and] vilify.
5 The Lord my part and portion is,
He bounteously [for me] provides;
Thou doft maintain my happy lot,
[Thou art] my hope, and none besides.
6 The place which mercy for me chose,
[To me] has good and pleasant been;
The heritage by grace assigned,
Excels all that [by eyes] is seen.
7 I thankfully do bless the Lord,
[Who was] my Counselor and Light,
Whereby my reins and secret thoughts
Instruct me in the [silent] night.
8 I set the Lord before me still,
[Because] he is at my right hand
In all assaults, in lowest state
[I hope] I shall unmoved stand.
9 Therefore my heart in me is glad;
Joy's by my [Glorying] tongue expressed,
In hope and confidence on God
[My pain'd] my dying flesh shall rest.
10 Thou will not cast my soul to hell,
Nor [shall the] grave my life detain;
My Lord Corruption did not see,
Nor shall I there [in still] remain.
11 Thou will show me the path of life,
Full- [ness of] Joy thy presence gives;
At thy right hand the blessed Church
In [ever-] lasting pleasures lives.
PSALM XVII.
1 LOrd hear the right, attend my cry;
Unto my [humble] suit give heed,
Which does not from hypocrisy
Or [false and] feigned lips proceed.
2 And let my sentence in Judgment
Come [forth] from thy [own] righteous mouth;
And let thine eye behold and judge
[All things] in equity and truth.
3 My heart thou many ways have proved
And visited in [waking] night;
Thou have tried me, and nothing found
[I hope] but what is in men upright.
To keep my mouth, left it transgress,
My [watchful] soul resolved has;
4 Thy word kept me from bad men's works,
And the destroyers [hurtful] path.
5 Hold up my goings in thy paths,
Left that my [sliding] foot offend.
6 I called on thee, for thou will hear;
[O God] to my request attend.
7 Show me thy loving kindness great,
[O thou] that sav'st by thy right hand
Those that do trust thee, from the men
That do against them [rise and] stand*
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye*
Hide me under thy [shady] wing,
9 From wicked men that me oppress,
And [deadly] foes encompassing.
10 They are enclosed in their own fat;
Their [boasting] mouth does speak proudly:
11 Us they have compassed in our steps,
[Down-lookt] to earth they set their eye.
12 Like Lions greedy of their prey,
And like the [lurking] Lion's whelp;
13 Rise, Lord, and disappoint these men,
Cast them down; [and] be [thou] my help*
14 Deliver thou my threatened life
From those [ill men] that are thy sword;
Men of the world, who are thy hand,
And [can but] do thy will, O Lord.
They have their portion in this life,
And seem with [many] Children blessed;
Their bellies thy provision fills,
[Dying] their Children have the rest.
15 But as for me, in righteousness
Thy [pleased] face I hope to see;
And with thy likeness when I wake
I [fully] satisfied shall be.
PSALM XVIII.
1 THee will I love, O Lord, my strength.
2 The Lord is my strong Rock and Fort,
My God, my Savior, and my Strength,
To whom by trust I will resort.
He is a buckler unto me;
It is alone by his great power
That I am saved from all ill,
He is my high defending tower.
3 Unto the Lord, who worthy is
Of all our praises, I will cry;
And then I shall preserved be
From every hurtful enemy.
4 Floods of bad men made me afraid,
The pangs of death about me went:
5 The fears of hell encompassed me,
The snares of death did me prevent.
6 In my distress I called on God,
I cried, and he my voice did hear
Out of his Temple, and my cry
Before him came into his ear.
7 The earth then as affrighted shook,
And trembling great upon it seized;
The hills foundations shook as moved,
Because he was wroth and displeased.
8 Up from his nostrils went a smoke,
And from his dreadful mouth there came
Devouring fire, and coals by it
Were kindled into burning flame.
9 He bowed the Heavens, and did come down;
Under his feet thick darkness was.
10 He flying on a Cherub rode,
On the wind's wings did flying pass.
11 He made darkness his secret place,
Even his Pavilion: round about
Were waters dark and thickened clouds,
Which passed all the skies throughout.
12 At the bright lightnings which brake forth,
And on before his presence went,
His thick clouds also passed on,
Hailstones and coals of fire were sent.
13 The Lord also from Heaven above
Frightfully thundered, as in ire;
The Highest gave his dreadful voice,
Hailstones and burning coals of fire.
14 His piercing arrows he sent out,
And speedily them scattered;
His Lightnings he shot abroad,
And quickly them discomfited.
15 The water's Channels then were seen,
The world's foundations opened were;
At thy rebuke, Lord, at thy blast
Of nostrils breath they were laid bare.
16 But from above he did send down,
And took me from these storms below;
From many waters great and deep,
That me they might not overflow.
17 And from my potent enemy
He saved me, and set me free;
And from all them which did me hate,
Because they were too strong for me.
18 They me prevented by their speed,
Unfurnisht in my troublous day:
But God (who always is at hand)
Was my defense and constant stay.
19 He brought me forth into a place
That very spacious is, and free;
Because in me he did delight,
He saved and delivered me.
20 According to my righteousness,
The righteous Lord did me regard;
After the cleanness of my hands
His recompense did me reward.
21 For I have kept the ways of God,
And turned not from him wickedly;
22 His judgments all before me were,
His Statutes I did not cast by.
23 I uprightly before him walked,
Kept me from mine iniquity;
24 He judged me as my cause was just,
And innocent before his eye.
25 Thou gracious to the gracious art;
To upright men thou wilt upright be:
26 Pure to the pure; but striv'st with them
That froward are, and strive with thee.
27 For thou will the afflicted save,
But bring down him that looks high:
28 My candle thou will light; God will
By light my darkness clarify.
29 By thee through armed troops I brake,
And have discomfited them all;
And by the strength of Thee, my God,
I scaled and leapt over the wall.
30 Most perfect is the way of God,
His Word is as refined and tried;
He is a buckler to all those
Who faithfully in him confide.
31 For who is God except the Lord?
Who but our God's a rock and stay?
32 He Is God that girdeth me with strength,
And guides, and perfecteth my way.
33 He makes my feet as swift as Hinds,
And sets me up on high from harms,
34 My hands he does instruct for war,
A steel bow's broken by my arms.
35 The shield of thy salvation
Thou freely did on me bestow;
And thy right hand has held me up,
Thy gentleness has made me grow.
36 My steps enlarged, my feet confirmed.
37 I have parsu'd mine enemies,
Them overtook, nor did turn back,
Till they were fallen, and could not rise.
38 They wounded are fallen at my feet;
With strength thou girdest me for war:
39 And those that up against me rose,
To me by thee subdued are.
40 Mine enemies necks thou gave me,
That I my haters might cut down:
41 They cried, but there was none to save,
To God, but he would not them own.
42 I beat them then in pieces small,
As dust before the wind that flies;
And I did cast them out as dirt
Which in the street despised lies
43 Thou sav'st me from the peoples strife,
Made'st me the heathens head to be;
A people whom I have not known
Shall subject servants be to me.
44 At the first hearing they will obey;
The strangers shall to me submit:
45 And they through fear shall fade away,
Who now in their close places sit.
46 The Lord still lives: Blessed be my Rock;
Let God my help exalted be:
47 God does avenge me, and he does
Subdue the people under me.
48 He saves me from mine enemies;
Above all those thou liftest me
That rise against me: from the man
Of violence thou set'st me free.
49 Therefore among the heathen, Lord,
I will with praise my thanks proclaim;
And unto thee I publicly
Will sing the praises of thy name.
50 He great deliverance gives his King,
And mercy to him does extend;
To David his anointed one,
And to his seed even without end.
PSALM XIX.
1 THe Glory of Almighty God
The [vast and] glorious Heavens declare:
Behold the starry Firmament,
And see what his [sublime] works are.
2 Day unto day does utter speech:
Night unto night [doth teach] God's fear;
All Nations of whatever tongue,
These [Publick] Teachers words may hear.
3 Their teaching Character and Line
Does through- [out all] the earth extend;
4 Their visible convincing words
Go forth the world's [utmost] end.
A tabernacle there he set
[In them] for the great glorious Sun;
5 Which as a Bridegroom-and strong man,
Comes forth [with joy] his race to run.
6 From end to end of the vast Heaven,
Its rise [progress] and circuit is;
Nothing's hid fron its lively heat,
Nor [potent] influence does miss.
7 The Law of God most perfect is,
Turns [sinful] souls from vanities:
God's testimony is most sure,
And makes [simple] sinners wise.
8 The Statutes of the Lord are right,
And do rejoice the [upright] heart:
The Lord's Commandments are pure,
And light to [darkned] eyes impart.
9 The fear of God is pure and clean,
And does [in force] endure for ever.
The judgments of the Lord are true,
[Holy] and righteous altogether.
10 Much more desirable than gold,
Than [much and] finest gold they are;
Than honey and the honeycomb,
Sweeter to [holy] souls by far.
11 In all his doubts and dangers here,
They are thy servants [guide and] guard;
They that sincerely them observe,
Shall have a great [and sure] reward.
12 Who can his errors understand?
O cleanse my [life and] soul within
From secret faults: Thy servant, Lord,
13 Keep [thou] from [all] presumptuous sin.
Let them not have dominion,
[Consent] and conquest over me;
And then from great and damning sin
I shall [by grace] delivered be.
14 Lord let the service of my mouth,
The [thoughts and] studies of my heart,
Be acceptable in thy sight,
Who my [Strength and] Redeemer art.
PSALM XX.
1 Lord hear thee in the day
When trouble he does send;
And let the name of Jacob's God,
Thy keeper, thee defend.
2 From his high Sanctuary
Let him thy keeeper be;
And out of Sion let the Lord
Support and strengthen thee.
3 Thy gifts and offerings
Let him remember still,
And let thy sacrifices find
His kind accepting will.
4 After thy just desire*
Let him grant unto thee:
Let all thy righteous Counsels still
By him fulfilled be.
5 In thy salvation we
Rejoice in the God's name will:
Our banners we'll set up: The Lord
All thy requests fulfill.
6 Now know I that the Lord
His own anointed saves;
And with his saving strength from heaven
Will grant him what he craves.
7 In Chariots some do trust,
Some Horses trust upon;
But we remember will the name
Of our Lord God alone.
8 We raised stand upright,
They are brought down and fall:
9 Save, Lord, and let our blessed King
Hear us when we do call.
PSALM XXI.
1 THe King shall joyful be,
Lord, in thy strength alone:
How greatly shall his heart rejoice
In thy salvation?
2 For thou have given him
His own heart's whole desire;
And nothing have from him withheld
Of what he did require.
3 With good thou him prevent'st
With blessings manifold;
And thou upon his head have set
A Crown of purest Gold.
4 He asked life of thee,
Thou it to him did give;
Even such a length of days, that he
For evermore shall live.
5 In thy salvation
His Glory is made great;
Honor and Royal Majesty
Have thou upon him set.
6 For thou for evermore
Most blessed have him made;
And with thy gracious countenance
Made him exceeding glad.
7 Because upon the Lord
The King his trust does lay;
He through the grace of the most High,
Shall not be moved away.
8 Thy hand shall find out all
Thine enemies that be:
Yea, thy right hand shall find out those
That haters are of thee.
9 Make them like hearths of fire,
In thy revenging hour;
The Lord shall swallow them in wrath,
The fire shall them devour:
10 Their fruit shall thou destroy,
From earth their wicked race;
Among the sons of men their seed
Shall find no resting place.
11 For they against thee did
Mischief plot, and intend
A wicked purpose, which yet they
Could not bring to an end.
12 Therefore thou shall make them
To turn their backs in chase;
And make thine arrows on the strings,
Ready against their face.
13 In thine own strength, O Lord,
Thy matchless Glory raise;
So shall our joyful songs rehearse
Thy Power's deserved praise.
PSALM XXII.
1 MY God, my God, O why
Have thou forsaken me?
Why from my roaring voice so far
Help and salvation be?
2 Thou hear'st me not, though I
Call to thee day by day;
And in the seasons of the night
I do not cease to pray.
3 But thou art holy, who
Inhabit'st Israel's praise:
4 Of old our Fathers trusted thee,
And thou did help always.
5 They trusted unto thee,
From thee deliverance came:
They wholly put their trust in thee,
And were not put to shame.
6 But I am a poor worm,
Not worth the name of man;
Even men's reproach, and much despised
I of the people am.
7 All they that look on me
Laugh me to scorn; and they
Shoot out the lip, and shake the head,
And thus against me say:
8 This man did trust in God
To save him: In our sight
Now let his God deliver him,
If he in him delight.
9 Thou took'st me from the womb;
Thou wast my hope and rest
When I a seeble Infant hanged
Upon my mother's breast.
10 I was cast on thy care,
Even from my birth till now;
And from the womb that did me bear
My God and Guide art thou.
11 Be not far off, for grief
Is near, and no help found.
12 Many Bulls compass me; fat Bulls
Of Bashan me surround.
13 Their mouth they opened wide,
Upon me gaped they,
Like to a Lion's ravening,
And roaring for his prey.
14 My bones are out of joint,
Like water I am spilt;
Among my pained Intestines
My heart like wax does melt.
15 Like a potsherd my strength
Is dried: My tongue cleaves
Unto my jaws, and thou have brought
Me to the dust of death.
16 For dogs have compassed me,
And the assembled bands
Of wicked men enclosed me;
They pierced my feet and hands.
17 I may count all my bones,
On me they look and stare.
18 Upon my Vesture they cast lots,
My Clothes among them share.
19 Be not far from me, Lord,
My strength, to help me have:
20 My soul deliver from the sword,
Do not to Dogs me cast.
21 Save me from lying mouths,
For thou have often heard me;
Even from the horns of Unicorns
I have been saved by thee.
22 Unto my brethren I
Will yet declare thy name;
And with the Congregation great
I Will join to praise the same.
23 Ye that fear God, praise him,
His great name glorify
All Jacob's seed; and fear ye him
Israel's posterity.
24 For he has not despised
The afflicted's misery;
Nor hid his face from him, but heard
When he to him did cry.
25 In the Assemblies great
My praise shall be of thee;
And before them that do thee fear,
My Vows performed shall be.
26 The meek shall be sufficed
With food: All praise shall give
To God, who him do truly seek,
Your hearts shall ever live.
27 All lands remember shall,
And turn unto the Lord;
And by all kindreds of the earth
Our God shall be adored.
28 The Kingdom is the Lord's,
He governs Nations all;
All that on earth by him are fed,
Before him down shall fall.
29 All shall before him bow,
That down to dust descend;
None can of all the sons of men
His life from death defend.
30 But still a holy seed
The Lord shall truly serve;
And God will them his chosen flock
Account and still preserve.
31 They shall come, and his work
Of righteousness make known
Unto a people yet unborn,
That this the Lord has done.
PSALM XXIII.
1 THe Lord himself my shepherd is,
Who does me feed and [safely] keep;
What can I want that is truly good,
While I am [one of] his own sheep?
2 He makes me to lie down and rest
In [pleasant] pastures, tender grass;
He keeps and gently leads me
Near [the sweet] streams of quietness.
3 My failing soul he does restore,
And lead in [safe and] righteous ways;
And all this freely, that his grace
And [holy] Name may have the praise.
4 And though my daily walk do lie
Through death's [dark] vale [yet] thou art there;
All being managed by thee,
[Therefore] no evil will I fear.
For in my lowest darkest state
The Lord [of Love] is with me still:
Thy Rod and Staff shall comfort me,
And keep me from all [deadly] ill.
5 Thy bounty does my Table spread
In presence of my [envious] foes;
My head refreshing Oil anoints;
My [plenteous] cup still overflows.
6 Goodness and mercy all my days
Shall [surely] keep and follow me;
And in the house of God always
My [joyful] dewlling place shall be.
The same by Mr. George Herbert.
1 THe God of Love my Shepherd is,
And he that does me feed;
While he is mine, and I am his,
What can I want or need?
2 He leads me to the tender grass,
Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass,
In both I have the best.
3 And if I stray, he does convert
And bring my mind in frame,
And all this not for my desert,
But for his holy name.
4 And in death's shady black abode
Well may I walk, not fear;
For thou art with me, and thy rod
To guide, thy staff to bear.
5 Thou make me to sit and dine
Even in mine enemies fight;
My head with Oil, my cup with Wine
Flows over day and night.
6 Surely thy sweet and wondrous love
Shall measure all my days;
And as it never shall remove,
So neither shall my praise.
PSALM XXIV.
1 THe earth is all the Lord's,
Its fullness all is his;
The world, with all that are therein,
His own creation is.
2 For he the liquid Seas
Has its foundation made,
And it upon the water-floods
Has stablished and staid.
3 Into God's sacred mount
Who Is he that shall ascend?
And in his place of holiness
Who shall accepted stand?
4 Whose heart's pure, and hands clean,
And unto vanity,
He who has not lift up his soul,
Nor sworn deceitfully.
5 This man a blessing great
From God shall surely have:
Righteous and gracious usage from
The God that will him save.
6 Of them that seek the Lord,
This is the holy race;
Such are the men of Jacob's God,
Who seek thy pleased face.
7 Lift up your heads, ye gates,
You lasting doors make way,
That so the great desired King
Of Glory enter may.
8 Who is this Glorious King?
Who may this Monarch be?
The strong and mighty God; the Lord
Mighty in war is he.
9 Lift up your heads* ye gates;
You lasting doors make way,
That so the great and mighty King
Of Glory enter may.
10 Who is he that is King
Of Glory? Who is this?
The Lord of Hosts, and he alone
The King of Glory is.
PSALM XXV.
1 I Lift my heart to thee,
My God and guide most just;
2 O let me never be ashamed,
For in thee do I trust.
Let not my foes rejoice
And triumph over me:
3 And let not any be ashamed
That trust and wait on thee.
But let them shamed be
Who causelessly transgress.
4 Show me thy ways; Lord teach thou me
Thy paths of Righteousness.
5 Direct me in thy truth,
And teach me, I thee pray;
Thou art my God and Savior,
On thee I wait always.
6 Remember, O my God,
Thy mercies manifold;
And thy great loving kindnesses,
For they have been of old.
7 My sins and faults of youth,
O keep not on record:
In mercy for thy goodness sake,
Remember me O Lord.
8 Perfectly good is God,
A sure and upright guide;
Therefore he will teach sinners his way,
That they go not aside.
9 The humble he will guide,
Who do his Counsels seek;
And he will teach his way unto
The lowly and the meek.
10 For all the paths of God
Are truth and mercy sure
To them that do his Covenant keep,
And Testimonies pure.
11 For thy names-sake, O Lord,
I humbly thee entreat
To pardon my iniquity,
For it is very great.
12 Whosoever does fear the Lord,
The Lord will him direct
To choose that way, and walk therein,
Where God will him accept.
13 His soul preserved by God
Shall dwell in holy peace:
His Covenant keeping seed shall here
On earth enough possess.
14 To such as fear the Lord
He will his secret show;
And his true saving Covenant
The Lord will make them know.
15 Mine eyes upon the Lord
Continually are set,
For it is he who shall bring forth
My feet out of the net.
16 Lord, turn thee unto me;
On me thy mercy show:
For I in grief am desolate,
And brought exceeding low.
17 The troubles of my heart
Are great, and do increase:
O pity and deliver me
Out of my sore distress.
18 On my affliction look,
And on my grief and pain;
O Lord forgive me all my sins,
And make me whole again.
19 Consider thou my foes,
That great and many are;
And what a causeless cruel hate
They do against me bear.
20 O safely keep my soul,
And still deliver me:
And let me never be ashamed,
Because I trust in thee.
21 Let my integrity
And uprightness defend
And keep me; for in faith and hope
I do on thee depend.
22 O gracious Lord, redeem
And bring thy people out
Of all the dangers and distress
That compass them about.
PSALM XXVI.
1 JUdge me, O Lord, for I
In uprightness abide,
And I have trusted in the Lord,
Therefore I shall not slide.
2 Examine me, O Lord,
My case now prove and try;
My reins and heart (well known to thee)
Unto my self descry.
3 Thy loving kindness is
Ever before mine eyes;
Thy Truth and Righteousness have been
My most beloved ways.
4 With vain false persons I
Have no Companion been;
With liars and dissemblers
I never will go in.
5 Ill-doers company
I have and still do hate;
With wicked and ungodly men
I have not gone or sat.
6 Guiltles of reigning sin,
I Will wash my hands, and so
Unto thy sacred Altar, Lord,
I then will boldly go.
7 That I may publish there,
With voice of joy and praise
The glory and the fame of all
Thy wondrous works and ways.
8 Thy worship in the house,
Lord, I have loved well;
I much delighted in the place
Where does thine honor dwell.
9 Crop not my life with men's
Of wickedness and blood,
10 Whose hands are filled with bribes, and with
Mischief against the good.
11 But as for me, I Will walk
In my integrity;
Be merciful, and me redeem,
And set at liberty.
12 My foot in an even place
Does stand with stedfastness;
And in the Congregations I
The Lord will praise and bless.
PSALM XXVII.
1 THe Lord my Light and Savior is,
Whom [therefore] shall I need to dread?
The Lord is of my life the strength,
[Of man] why should I be afraid?
2 When wicked men that are my foes
Did all [in rage] against me come,
To eat my flesh, they stumbled then,
And fell, and were [themselves] overthrown.
3 Though Hosts encampt against me lie,
[Yet this] my heart shall not much fear:
Though wars against me raised be,
I Will confident be [also] there.
4 One thing of God I have desired,
And that I will still [seek and] crave;
That in the Lord's house all my days
I may a [quiet] dwelling have.
That there God's beauteous holiness
I may [with joy] see and admire:
And for direction in my doubts,
May [humbly] of his will enquire.
5 For he in times of trouble will
Secure me by his [saving] grace;
In his own Tent and Tabernacle,
And on a Rock [he shall] me place.
6 And now (by him who is my strength)
My head shall [highly] lifted be
Above my cruel enemies,
Who do [about] encompass me.
The sacrifice of joy will I
Into his [holy] Temple bring;
I Will sing aloud unto the Lord,
Yea, I will [joyful] praises sing.
7 Hear me, O Lord, when with my voice
I mournfully [to thee] do cry;
Have mercy also upon me,
And [grant thine] answer graciously.
8 When thou command'st, seek ye my face,
My [willing] heart said unto thee,
Thy pleased face, Lord, I will seek,
9 Hide not thy [pleased] face from me.
O put me not away in wrath,
Thou wast [thou art] my help alone;
Forsake not me, who art the God
Of my [health] and salvation.
10 When my Father and Mother both
Do me in [greatest] straits forsake,
Even then the Lord will gather me,
And up my fainting soul will take.
11 Teach me thy righteous way, O Lord,
[And] in a plain path lead [thou] me,
Because of those who are my foes,
And my [watchful] observers be.
12 Leave me not to mine enemies will,
[Many] false witnesses arise
Against me, and malicious men,
Who breath out [wrath and] cruelties.
13 My heart had failed, unless I had
[Hope't and] believed for to see
Thy Goodness manifested yet
[On earth] to them that living be.
14 Wait on the Lord: Courageous be,
And he shall [help and] and strength afford
Unto thy heart: I say again,
Still [trust and] wait upon the Lord.
PSALM XXVIII.
1 TO thee I cry, O Lord, my Rock;
Let me thy [speedy] answer have,
Lest by thy silence I become
Like dead men [buried] in the grave.
2 My earnest supplications hear
When I to thee [for help] do cry;
When I my hands lift up toward
Thy [sacred] Oracle on high.
3 O draw me not away with those
Who [falsly] act this wicked part;
Who speak unto their neighbor's peace,
While mischief's in their [treacherous] heart.
4 Give them according to their deeds,
[After] the evil which they meant;
According to their handy work,
Render [to them] their punishment.
5 Since they regarded not God's works,
Nor what [great things] his hands have wrought,
He shall not build, but pull them down,
[Destroy] and bring them all to naught.
6 Blessed be the Lord, because he heard
The [earnest] voice of my request:
7 The Lord's my strength, my shield, and help,
My heart on him [alone] shall rest.
Because he saves me, therefore
My heart [in him] does much rejoice;
And with the songs of thanks and praise
[To him] I will lift up my voice.
8 The Lord is the defense and strength
Of those that be [indeed] his own;
And his anointed's Savior
And strength is he, [and he] alone.
9 Lord save thy people, and still bless
Thy own [chosen] inheritance;
Them as their Shepherd rule and feed,
[Save and] for ever them advance.
PSALM XXIX.
1 ALL ye that mighty are on earth,
Give [all the] glory to the Lord;
To God the glory and the strength
Ascribe [ye all] with one accord.
2 The glory due to God's great name
Give to him, and [to all] confess;
Publicly worship ye the Lord
In [solemn] beauteous holiness.
3 The Lord's voice on the waters is,
The God of [strength and] majesty
Does thunder, and on waters great
Does [sit and] rule them all on high.
4 The thundering dreadful voice of God
[Full of] prevailing power is,
And full of Royal Majesty
Is that great [frightful] voice of his.
5 This voice of the Almighty does
The [great tall] Cedars break and tear;
The Lord does thus the Cedars break,
Which [the Mount] Lebanon does bear.
6 Yea, he does make the trembling hills
Like a young Calf [about] to skip;
And Lebanon, and Sirion
Like [the young] Unicorns to leap.
7 God's voice casts out the flames of fire;
[This voice] it makes the deserts quake:
8 The Lord the great dry Wilderness
Of Kadesh makes [as mov'd] to shake.
9 God's voice does make the Hinds to calve,
And makes the [cover'd] Forests bare;
And in his holy Temple all
His glory do [by praise] declare.
10 The Lord sits King on swelling floods,
His [Rule and] Kingdom never cease:
The Lord will give his people strength,
And [he will] bless them all with peace.
PSALM XXX.
1 ALL thankful praise with heart and voice,
O [gracious] Lord I give to thee,
Who have not made my foes rejoice,
But have [sav'd and] exalted me.
2 O Lord my God, to thee I cried
In all my pain [my fears] and grief;
Thou soon did hear and help provide,
And heal me with [speedy] relief.
3 Lord, thy great mercy did bring up
My soul from death [and hell] to save;
Till now thou have kept me alive
From an untimely [feared] grave.
4 O ye that are his holy ones,
Sing [joyful] praises to the Lord;
In memory of his holiness,
Give thanks [to him] with one accord.
5 There Is but a moment in his wrath:
[Endless] life in his favor lies:
Though weeping be our evening's work,
Joy [with us] in the morn shall rise.
6 In health and sweet prosperity
My [careless] heart affected was,
As if I never should be moved,
And see what [after] came to pass.
7 For thy great savor, Lord, did seem
To make my [present] state secure;
My mountain of prosperity
Did seem so [setled] strong and sure.
But when (offended by my sin)
Thou hid'st from me thy [pleased] face,
My painful flesh and troubled soul
Did [quickly] feel a changed case.
8 Then did I cry to thee, O Lord,
When [pain and] danger bid me pray;
I poured out before the Lord
My [earnest] suit both night and day.
9 I said, what gain is in my blood,
If to the [feared] grave I go:
Does silent dust there speak thy praise?
Does it thy [truth and] mercy show?
10 Hear, gracious Lord, a sinner's cries,
Who does thy [needful] mercy crave;
Lord help me in this deep distress,
And from this [feared] danger save.
11 Then did thou turn my grief and moans
Into a pleasant [thankful] voice:
My mourning garments thou took'st off,
And taught'st me to [sing and] rejoice.
12 That so my tongue may sing thy praise,
And never [henceforth] silent be.
O Lord my God, for evermore
I will give thanks [and praise] to thee.
The Old Meter lengthened.
1 ALL laud and praise with heart and voice,
O Lord [my God] I give to thee;
Who did not make my foes rejoice,
But have [sav'd and] exalted me.
2 O Lord my God, to thee I cried
In all my [woful] pain and grief;
Thou gav'st an ear, and did provide
To ease me with [timely] relief.
3 Of thy good will thou have called back
My soul from [death and] hell to save;
Thou did revive when strength did lack,
And sav'dst me from the [feared] grave.
4 Sing praise, ye Saints, who prove and see
The [love and] goodness of the Lord;
In memory of his Majesty
[Sing and] rejoice with one accord.
5 For why, his anger but a space
Does last, and [quickly] slack again:
But in his favor and his grace
Always does [blessed] life remain.
6 Though gripes, and grief, and pangs full sore
Shall lodge with us all [the dark] night;
The Lord to joy shall us restore
[Betimes] before the day be light.
7 When I enjoyed the Word at will,
Thus [vainly] would I boast and say,
Tush, I am sure to feel no ill,
This [health and] wealth shall not decay*
8 For thou, O Lord, of thy good grace,
Had sent me [present] strength and aid;
But when thou turn'dst away thy face,
My [troubled] mind was sore dismayed.
9 Wherefore again yet did I cry
To thee O [gracious] Lord of might,
My God with plaints I did apply,
And prayed [to him] both day and night.
What gain is in my blood, said I,
If [hasty] death destroy my days?
Does dust declare thy Majesty,
Or yet thy [grace and] truth does praise?
10 Wherefore, my God, some pity take,
O Lord, I [humbly] thee desire;
Do not this simple soul forsake,
[My God] of help I thee require.
11 Then did thou turn my grief and woe
Into a [glad and] cheerful voice;
The mournful weeds thou took'st me fro,
And made me to [sing and] rejoice.
12 Wherefore my soul uncessantly
Shall sing unto thy [holy] praise:
My Lord, my God, to thee will I
Give laud and [joyful] thanks always.
PSALM XXXI.
1 IN thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
[Therefore] let me not shamed be;
But in thy constant righteousness
Do thou [save and] deliver me.
2 Bow down thine ear to me with speed,
Vouchsafe [me thy] deliverance,
To save me by my Rock of strength,
My [Fort and] Castle of defense.
3 For thou art in my strong Rock, and thee
I for my [secure] Fortress take;
Lead me therefore, and keep me safe,
For thy own [name and] glory sake.
4 Pull me out of the net which they
For me [in craft] have closely laid,
Because thou only art my strength,
To which I [trust and] fly for aid.
5 Into thy hand I do commit
My spirit; for thou [alone] art he,
Jehovah, God of truth and grace,
Who have [in love] redeemed me.
6 Them that deceitful vanities
Regard I [shun and] have abhorred,
But my firm hope and confidence
Is in my [great and] gracious Lord.
7 I in thy mercies will rejoice,
Because my [many] miseries
Thou weighest; and have known my soul
In all [my great] adversities.
8 Thou have not left and shut me up
Into my [wrathful] enemies hand:
Thou set'st my feet at liberty,
In a large [and free] room to stand.
9 Have mercy on me, O my God,
In [my great] trouble send relief;
Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,
Consumed are with [pain and] grief.
10 My life is spent in grief, my years
In [mournful] sighs away do fly;
My strength does fail, my bones consume,
[And this] for mine iniquity.
11 Among my foes I was a scorn,
[And] to [my] neighbors specially;
A fear to friends: They that saw me
Without [away] did from me fly.
12 I am forgotten as a man
That [now a] long time has been dead;
And like a broken vessel cast
Aside [I am] as perished.
13 Many men's slanders I have heard,
Fear compassed me [about] while they
Against me did consult and plot
[By fraud] to take my life away.
14 But I did trust in thee, O Lord,
When I [by foes] was under-trod;
This was my soul's support and rest,
I said, Thou art my [gracious] God.
15 My times are in thy hand and will:
[Do thou] save and deliver me
From their hands who mine enemies
And [causeless] persecutors be.
16 On thine afflicted servant, Lord,
Make thou thy [pleased] face to shine;
And save me for that mercies sake
Which thou do [freely] show to thine.
17 Let me not be ashamed, O Lord,
For I did [trust and] call on thee:
Let wicked men be shamed, cut off,
In their graves [silent] let them be.
18 To silence put the lying lips,
Which grievous things [and false] do say;
And hard reports in pride and scorn
On righteous men do [falsly] lay.
19 O how great is the goodness which
Thou have laid up [and wrought] for the^
Who fear thee, and who trust in thee,
[Even here] before the sons of men?
20 Thou in thy secret presence do
Hide them from [cruel] pride and wrongs,
Kept in thy close Pavilion,
From all the strife of [lying] tongues.
21 All thanks and praise be to the Lord,
For he has [shewn and] magnified
His wondrous love to me within
A City [strong and] fortified.
22 I said in have I am cut off,
[And put] even from before thine eyes;
Yet did thou hear my praying voice,
And did regard my [mournful] cries.
23 O love the Lord, all ye his Saints,
[For still] the Lord the faithful guards;
And proud Oppressors, tho secure,
[In time] he plenteously rewards.
24 Be of good courage, and more strength
He to your [fainting] hearts will send,
All ye whose hope and confidence
Does [truly] on the Lord depend.
PSALM XXXII.
1 HE (though a sinner) blessed is,
Whose [guilt and] loathed transgression
God freely does to him forgive,
Covering what he has [been and] done.
2 He Is blessed to whom the Lord does not
Impute [and charge] iniquity;
And in whose spirit reigns not
Guile [Falshood] or Hypocrisy.
3 While I in silence hid my sin,
And had not [duly] it confessed,
My bones waxed old; and roaring pains
[All day] allowed me no rest.
4 Through painful weary days and nights
I bare thy [just and] heavy hand;
My strength and moisture are consumed
Like [Summers] drought on scorched land.
5 My sin I then acknowleding,
With [humbling] grief my self did blame;
I did confess it all to thee,
And did bewail my [guilt and] shame,
When my repenting soul resolved
All to confess [with grief] to God,
Thou mercifully did forgive,
And often lay by thy [chastening] rod.
6 Such mercy shall encourage all
The godly still [in hope] to pray,
And seek to thee in their distress,
In an accepted [finding] day.
Surely when waters great do swell,
And [threatning] floods cause me to fear;
Him (that thus seeks and trusts in thee)
They shall not [hurt or] once come near.
7 Thou art my help and hiding place,
Against all [trouble] fears and wrongs;
And thy deliverances shall cause
[Mine and] thy peoples thankful songs.
8 Says God, I Will thee instruct and teach
The [righteous] way where thou shall go;
Mine eye shall always on thee be,
My [guiding] Counsels I Will thee show.
9 Be not like brutish Horse and Mule,
Which [ruling] understanding want,
But must be ruled by bridling force,
And kept [from hurt] by man's restraint.
10 To all self-flattering wicked men,
Their [self-made] sorrows do abound;
But him that trusts in the Lord,
Mercy shall [save and] compass round.
11 Ye righteous in the Lord be glad,
With thankful hearts [in him] rejoice:
All ye that are of upright hearts,
[Aloud] sing praise with joyful voice.
PSALM XXXIII.
1 YE righteous in the Lord, rejoice*
For [chearful] praise becomes Saints:
2 Praise God with Psaltery, Harp, and Voice,
And [with sweet] ten-string'd Instruments.
3 Play skilfully with a loud noise,
And sing [to him] a song that is new:
4 For all the Word of God is right,
And all his works are [sure and] true.
5 God greatly loves righteousness,
And judgment [well ad-] ministered;
And with the goodness of the Lord
The earth's [richly] replenished.
6 By the Almighty Word of God
The [vast and] glorious Heavens were made;
And by the spirit of his mouth
Their whole host [all their] being had.
7 The waters of the Sea he keeps
[On heaps] confined by the shore:
He lays up the liquid deeps
As [Treasures] in a house of store.
8 Let all the people of the earth
The Lord Almighty [serve with] fear;
And all the world's inhabitants
To him due [awe and] reverence bear.
9 He spoke but the creating word,
And it was done and [all things] made;
He did but potently command,
And it stood faft as [firmly] stayed.
10 The Counsels of the Nations rude,
The [Ruling] Lord does bring to naught;
He does defeat the multitude
Of their device and wicked thought.
11 But all the counsels of the Lord
Do stand [unchang'd] for ever sure*
And all the purposes of God
[Beyond] all ages do endure.
12 That Nation blessed is, to whom
The Lord as [their own] God is known:
And those whom as an heritage
He [loves and] chooses for his own.
13 The Lord looks down from Heaven and sees
All [done by] men of humane birth;
14 And from his habitation views
[Even] all [the] dwellers of the earth.
15 He fashioneth their hearts alike,
[And all] their doings he observes.
16 No King is saved by an Host,
Much strength no [Mighty] man preserves.
17 A horse of war is a valn thing
To save a man in [time of] fight,
Nor shall deliver any man
[Either] by swiftness or by might.
18 But upon those that do him fear,
The Lord does set his [gracious] eye,
On those that on his mercy do
With [hope and] confidence rely.
19 To save them from a pining death,
In Famine [food and] life to yield.
20 Our soul still waits for the Lord,
He is our help and [only] shield.
21 Because his holy name we trust,
Our hearts [in him] shall joyful be.
22 Lord let thy mercy be on us,
As we do [place our] hope in thee.
PSALM XXXIV.
1 AT all times I will magnify
[And bless] the Lord with tongue and heart*
His joyful praises never shall
Out of my [thankful] mouth depart.
2 My soul in her preserving Lord,
Her boasting [boldly] shall express,
And humble men shall hear thereof,
And join [therein] with joyfulness.
3 O magnify the Lord with me,
We'll [joyntly] all exalt his name:
4 In all my fears I sought the Lord,
He [heard and] saved me from the same.
5 They that to him did look for help,
Of [light and] comfort did partake;
Their confidence in him did not
Their face [at all] ashamed make.
6 This poor man cried in distress,
The Lord [to him] a hearing gave;
And him from all his troubles did
Effectually [help and] save.
7 About all them that fear the Lord,
Encamped Angels [always] lie
To save and to deliver them
From every [hurtful] enemy.
8 O taste and see that God is good!
Blessed [are all] they that in him trust.
9 Fear God, ye Saints, no hurtful want
Befalls the upright [walking] just.
10 Even Lion's young ones hungry are,
And [often] want desired food;
But they that seek the Lord, shall not
Want any thing that is [truly] good.
11 Teachable Children, come to me,
My [sure and] tried Counsel hear;
And I will teach you faithfully
The true way of God's [holy] fear.
12 What man desires length of life,
And his own good does [wisely] seek?
13 From evil keep thy tongue and lips,
That they no [quite or] falsehood speak.
14 Depart from evil, and do good,
[Seek and] pursue peace faithfully;
15 The eyes of God are on the just,
His ears attend their [plaint and] cry.
16 The face of God is set against
[All] them that [do] live wickedly;
That he may cut off from the earth
Their [very] name and memory.
17 The righteous cry unto the Lord,
[And them] in mercy he does hear;
And them deliver out of all
The troubles which they [feel or] fear.
18 To them that are of broken hearts,
The Lord with [healing] grace is near;
And surely saves such whose spirits
Are contrlte, and him [truly] fear.
19 The just men's sufferings many are,
But God [in time] does out of all
20 Deliver them: He keeps their bones,
None [of them]'s broken by their fall.
21 As for the wicked enemies,
Who do God's [righteous] servants hate,
Their sin by its own dire effects,
Shall [stay and] make them desolate.
22 But the Lord does his servants souls
Redeem, and [fully] set them free;
And of all them that trust in him,
None [cast off] desolate shall be.
PSALM XXXV.
1 LOrd plead my righteous cause with them
Who trouble me with [envious] strife,
Fight against them that causelessly
Do fight to take [away] my life.
2 Of shield and buckler take thou hold,
Stand up [defend] and help thou me;
3 Draw out the spear, and stop their way
That [causeless] persecutors be.
Say to my soul, I will thee save.
4 Let them to [utter] shame be brought*
Who seek my life, and plot my hurt,
Them foil [confound] and bring to naught.
5 Make them like chaff before the wind,
[And let] God's Angel chase them all:
6 Make their way dark and slippery,
God's Angel [hunt and] make them fall.
7 They hid for me a snaring net,
In malice without [a just] cause;
They dig'd a pit to take my soul,
In [cruel] craft against thy Laws.
8 Let him be ruined unawares,
And caught in his own [hidden] net;
Let him fall in that pit and snare
Which his own hands have [dig'd and] set.
9 In God and his salvation then
My soul shall [glad and] joyful be;
10 My very flesh and bones shall say,
Lord, who [or what] is like to thee?
Who sav'st the poor and weak from them
That for him are too [great and] strong;
The poor and needy from the men
Who him oppress by [spoil and] wrong.
11 False witness rose; they to my charge
Things [false of] which I knew not laid.
12 To spoil my soul unthankful men,
Evil for good [to me] repaid.
13 But as for me, when they were sick,
In sackcloth clad [for them] I mourned;
With fasting I humbled my soul,
My prayer home to me returned.
14 For him I sadly walked, as for
A real friend or [loving] brother,
I heavily bowed down, as one
That mourns for his [dying] mother.
15 But they rejoiced in my woe,
[Combin'd] vile abjects met to plot;
Unknown to me they gathered were,
[And they] to tear me ceased not.
16 And not unlike Stage-hypocrites
My [cruel] adversaries be;
And in their feasts with scoffing jeasts,
They [grind and] gnash their teeth on me.
17 But Lord, how long will thou look on?
From [contriv'd] ruin rescue me;
And let my soul, my darling be
From [greedy] Lions kept by thee.
18 Then I will render thanks to thee,
[Even] in [the] Congregations great;
And I will celebrate thy praise
Where [the strong] multitudes do meet.
19 Let not them over me rejoice,
Who hate [and hurt] me wrongfully;
Let not my causeless foes triumph,
And wink with scornful [scoffing] eye.
20 Their heart and talk is not for peace,
They [false and] crafty plots prepare
Against all those that in the land
Hurt none, but [to all] quite are.
21 Yea* their malicious [lying] mouths
They [widely] opened against me,
And with triumphing scorn did say,
[His crime] his fall our eyes did see.
22 All this, O Lord, thine eye has seen,
O do not [longer] silent stand;
Against these false malicious men
[For help] be thou still near at hand.
23 Stir up thy self, and show thy power,
To judge my cause [do thou] awake;
My righteous cause, well known to thee,
[My Lord] my God, do not forsake.
24 O Lord my God, do thou me judge
After thy [perfect] righteousness;
And suffer not them over me
Their [boasting] triumph to express.
25 Let them not say insultingly,
[Aha] so we would have it be.
Let them not proudly boast and say
That they have [wholly] swallowed me.
26 Shame and confusion come to them
Who at my hurt [and fall] are glad;
They that against me vaunt themselves,
With shame [cast down] let them be clad.
27 Let all that love my righteous cause,
[Gladly] their joy with shouts express,
And say, The Lord be magnified,
Who loves his [faithful] servants peace.
28 To speak thy righteousness shall be
The [glad] employment of my tongue;
And thy high praises to set forth
With [joy and] gladness all day long.
PSALM XXXVI.
1 BY wicked men's ungodly lives
My heart has [surely] understood,
What ere he says, before his eyes
There is no [serious] fear of God.
2 By flattery he deceives himself,
As [safe and] just in his own eyes,
Till God make known how hateful are
His [many] foul iniquities.
3 His profane mouth in his discourse
Does [daily] speak deceit and sin;
For to be wise, and to do good,
[This shews] he wants a heart within.
4 Even on his bed iniquity
Is his device and [busie] thought;
He sets himself in ways not good,
And hates not what is [vain and] naught.
5 Thy mercies, Lord, are very great,
And do the [highest] heavens transcend;
Thy truth and constant faithfulness
Do to the [rowring] clouds extend.
6 Thy Justice is like mountains great,
Thy judgments [are like] a great deep;
Thy bounty and good providence
Both man and beast does [feed and] keep.
7 O God, how precious is thy love?
Because that thou art [good and] just,
Under the shadow of thy wings
The sons of men do [put their] trust.
8 With the rich fatness of thy house
They [sweetly] nourished shall be,
And of thy streams of holy joys,
[They shall] be made to drink by thee.
9 For of desired endless life,
The [flowing] fountain is with thee;
And in thy light thy holy ones
The [true and] glorious light shall see.
10 Thy loving kindness still draw out
To [faithful] men that do thee know;
And unto men of upright heart,
Thy [love and] righteousness still show.
11 Stop thou the foot of furious pride,
That would [in rage] against me come;
Let not the hand of wicked men
[Thee and] my safety move me from.
12 Dreadfully there are thy all fallen
[The men] that work iniquities;
Cast down by God, and never shall
[Henceforth] be able more to rise.
PSALM XXXVII.
1 FRet not thy self at wicked men,
For their [present] prosperity:
Not be thou envious at those
That [now do] work iniquity.
2 For like the grass which flourished,
Quickly cut down [and gone] are they;
And like the green and tender herb
[They] wither and [must] die away.
3 Trust in the Lord, and set thy self
[Wholly] to please him and do good*
And so thou shall dwell in the land,
And [surely] have sufficient food.
4 Make thou the Lord thy chief delight,
(To know and do his [holy] will)
And thy (thus guided) just desires,
Be sure [that then] he will fulfill.
5 Commit thy way unto the Lord;
[Wholly] by trust on him depend,
And he shall bring thy just designs
[In time] unto a happy end.
6 And like the shining light he shall
Thy righteousness [to men] display;
And he thy judgment shall bring forth,
Clear like the noontide [of the] day.
7 In silence rest thou on the Lord,
Waint patiently [on him] and stay:
Fret not thy self because of them
Who prosper in their [evil] way.
Because of wicked men, who bring
Their [plots and] ill designs to pass*
8 Shun wrath and anger: To do ill
Fret not [thy self] in any case:
9 For those that evil doers be,
God will cut off in [his just] wrath;
But those that trust and wait on God,
[Their time] inherit shall the earth.
10 For yet wait but a little while,
The wicked [on earth] shall not be;
His place thou shall observe and view,
But him [therein] thou shall not see.
11 But meek and humble men the earth
Shall quietly [their time] possess,
And they shall here delight themselves
In plenty and in [holy] peace.
12 The wicked plots against the just,
And at him grinds his [bloody] teeth.
13 The Lord derideth him, because
His [dreadful] day he coming sees.
14 The wicked have drawn out the sword,
And bent their bow to [wound] and slay
The poor and weak; and to cast down
Men [that are] upright in their way.
15 But their own sword which they have drawn,
Shall enter their own [guilty] hearts;
And their strong bow which they have bent,
Shall broak- [en in-] to pieces part.
16 A little that the righteous has
[With grace] is better to him far
Then unto many wicked men
Their [worldly] wealth and riches are.
17 The wicked's arms shall broken be,
But God the just [by grace] sustains:
18 God knows the upright's days, and still
Their heritage [surely] remains.
19 They shall not need to be ashamed
When evil times [the land] betide,
And in the days of scarcity
They shall [with food] be satisfied.
20 But wicked men shall perish all,
[Even all] God's foes that him provoke,
As fat of Lambs they shall consume,
And [away] vanish into smoke.
21 The wicked borrows in need,
But pays not [again] his debt;
The righteous gives to the poor,
His heart's on [works of] mercy set.
22 For such as blessed be of him,
[Good on] the earth inherit shall;
And they that cursed be of him,
[Cut off] shall be destroyed all.
23 The steps of good men by the Lord
Are [fixt and] ordered aright;
And in their good and upright way
He pleased [is, and] does delight.
24 And though he fall, yet shall he not
[Sink and] be utterly cast down,
For God by his Almighty hand
[Keeps and] upholds him as his own.
25 I have been young, and now am old,
Yet have I [hereto] never seen
The just forsaken, nor his seed,
[That they] for bread have beggars been.
26 He Is always merciful, and lends;
His seed is blessed [of God] therefore
27 Depart from evil, and do good,
And [you shall] dwell for evermore.
28 For God loves judgment, and his Saints
[Though low] forsakes not utterly;
They are preserved, but he cuts off
Sinner's [unblest] posterity.
29 The just inherit shall the land,
And [they shall] ever in it dwell.
30 The just man's mouth does wisdom speak,
His tongue does [truth and] judgment tell.
31 The Law of God is in his heart,
None of his goings [slide and] stray.
(...) wicked man does watch the just,
(...) seeks him to [hurt and] slay.
^ut the Lord will not him forsake,
^or leave him in their [cruel] hands;
(...) righteous he will not condemn
When he [with him] in judgment stands
34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,
Thou shall [by him] exalted be
To dwell on earth, when as cut off
The wicked [doers] thou shall see.
35 I saw the wicked in great power,
Spread like a [prospering] green bay tree:
36 He past and was not; Him I sought,
But found [on earth] he could not be.
37 Mark well the perfect, and observe
The man of [sincere] uprightness,
And thou shall see that of this man
The [later] end is blessed peace.
38 But the transgressors in (in God's time)
Shall [surely] be destroyed together;
This is the end of wicked men,
To be cut off [and lost] for ever.
39 But the salvation of the just
Is of the [righteous] Lord always;
In time of trouble and distress
He is their [present] strength and stay.
40 The Lord shall help and save them still
From [all the] wicked and unjust;
He surely shall deliver them,
Because in him they [put their] trust.
PSALM XXXVIII.
1 IN thy unsufferable wrath,
O [gracious] Lord rebuke me not:
O chasten not this sinful wretch
In thy [deserved] displeasure hot.
2 Thine arrows sharp stick fast in me,
And me thy hand does [sorely] press:
3 Because of thy deserved wrath,
My flesh has no [health and] soundness.
My pained bones have little rest,
For [the great] sins that I have done:
4 My manifold iniquities
Over my [guilty] head are gone.
They as a weighty burden be
Too heavy for [my soul] to bear:
5 And for my foolishness my wounds
[And sores] stink and corrupted are.
6 Trouble does greatly bow me down;
All [the] day [long] I mourning go.
7 My loins with loathsome sores are filled,
My flesh no [ease or] health does know.
8 I so infirm and feeble am,
Cast down and broken [very] sore;
That in disquietness of heart
I have been put to [groan and] roar.
9 Lord, all my wants and my desires
Are [ever] open unto thee;
None of my groans and bitter moans
[To thee] unknown and hidden be.
10 My troubled fainting heart does pant,
My [failing] strength does much decay;
As for my weakened eyes, their sight
Is almost [from me] gone away.
11 My (grieved and my changed) friends
And lovers stand [from me] aloof;
And from my painful stroke and sore
My [oblig'd] kinsmen stand far off.
12 And they that seek my hurt and life,
Cease not their [cruel] snares to lay;
False and mischievous things they speak,
And plot [their vile] deceits all day.
13 But I was as a man that is deaf,
And none of this [reproach] did hear;
And as a dumb man silent was,
And their false [cruel] speeches bear.
14 I was as one that hears not,
That could [to them] no answer make:
15 For in thee, Lord, I hope, and thou Will [hear and] answer undertake.
16 I said, hear, lest they over me
Should triumph [prospering] in their pride,
And against me lift up themselves,
When overwhelmed I [fall or] slide.
17 For I am in a halting case,
Through grief which I am [always] in:
18 I Will mine iniquity declare,
As [truly] sorry for my sin.
19 But still mine enemies do live,
They prosper, and are [great and] strong;
And they are multiplied much
Who hate [and hurt] me to my wrong.
20 And they that render ill for good,
[Daily] as enemies me use,
(Not that I wrong them, but) because
The thing that is good I [do and] choose.
21 Forsake me not, O gracious Lord,
[My God] O be not far from me.
22 Lord, to my needful help make have,
[For my] salvation is of thee.
PSALM XXXIX.
1 I Said I will look to my ways,
Lest with my [hasty] words I sin;
While wicked men stand by, my tongue
I Will bridle, and [with care] keep in.
2 With silence I became as dumb,
[Resolv'd] restraint did hold my peace;
Even from good talk and just defense,
Till [stirred] sorrows did increase.
3 My heart within me then grew hot,
While [troubled] thus I mused long,
Till the restrained fire broke out,
Then thus I loosed my [bridled] tongue.
4 Lord make me to foreknow my end,
The shortness of my [hastning] days,
That I may know how frail I am,
(And [do my] work without delays.)
5 Experience tells us, Thou have made
Man's days [to be] but as a span;
Even as mere nothing before thee
Is the short age of [Mortal] man.
Surely, not one, but every man
Here in his [setled] fastest state,
Is altogether vanity,
His life is of [so] short [a] date.
6 The worldling walks in a vain show,
Turmoils himself [for wealth] in vain;
He heapeth up, but does not know
To whom it [after] will remain.
7 And now, O Lord, what wait I for?
My [trust and] hope is all on thee;
8 Save me from all my sins, lest I
To [wicked] fools a scorn should be.
9 As dumb I opened not my mouth,
Because [I knew] the scourge was thine.
10 Remove from me thy heavy hand,
Under thy [chastening] stroke I pine.
11 When with rebukes thou chastenest man
[Justly] for his iniquity,
His strength dissolveth like a moth;
Thus [every] man is vanity.
12 Lord hear my prayer, regard my cries,
[And be] not silent at my tears,
I sojourn and a stranger am
[On earth] as all my fathers were.
13 O spare me yet; prolong my days,
My strength and peace [do thou] restore,
Before I go from hence by death,
And shall be seen [on earth] no more.
PSALM XL.
1 I Waited long, seeking the Lord,
And patiently [his hand] did bear;
And he inclined unto me,
And did my [cry and] prayer hear.
2 He took me from an horrid pit,
Out of the [sordid] miry clay,
And set my feet upon a Rock,
And [safely] stablished my way.
3 He put a new song in my mouth,
Our God to [praise and] magnify;
Many shall see, and fear the Lord,
And shall [by faith] on him rely.
4 O blessed is that man, whose trust
Upon the Lord [alone] relies!
Respecting not the proud, nor such
As turn aside [from truth] to lies.
5 O Lord my God, how many are
The wonders thou [for us] have wrought?
By which thou have made known to us
The measures of thy [gracious] thoughts.
They cannot all be reckoned up
[By-us] in order unto thee;
If I would mention them, they are more
Than numbered by man can be.
6 Thou do no bloody sacrifice,
Or offering [of us] desire;
Burnt-offering, and sin-offering,
Thou do not now [of man] require.
Mine ear thou openedst to thy call;
7 Then said I [to thee] Lo, I come,
For so of me it written is
Even in thy [sacred] book's Volumne.
8 My God, I come to do thy will,
It is my [work and] great delight;
My heart within the Tables is
Where thou thy [holy] Law did write.
9 In the great Congregation I
Thy [truth and] righteousness did preach;
Thou know, Lord, I did not refrain
By [sinful] silence holy speech.
10 I have not in my heart concealed
Thy [sacred] truth and righteousness,
But openly I have declared
Thy [saving] grace and faithfulness.
Thy loving kindness I declared,
I did it not [from men] conceal;
To thy great Congregations
Thy [holy] truth I did reveal.
11 Thy tender saving mercies, Lord,
With hold not, nor [to me] deny;
Let thy benignity and truth
Keep me [from ill] continually.
12 For I am compassed about
With evils [great and] manifold;
I am not able to look up,
My sins [on me] do take such hold.
More than hairs on my head they are,
Therefore my [failing] heart's dismayed;
Be pleased, Lord, to deliver me,
[O Lord] make have to be my aid.
14 Shame and confusion be to all
That seek my [guiltless] blood to spill;
Let them be driven back, and shamed,
Who wish [in heart] my wrongful ill.
15 For a reward of this their shame,
[Then] desolate let them [all] be,
Who in my hurt do cry Aha,
[With scorn] and triumph over me.
16 Let all that truly seek thy face,
Joy and be [ever] glad in thee;
Let such a love thy grace still say,
[Our] God [shall] magnified be.
17 I weak, and poor, and needy am,
But [yet am] not of God forgot:
Thou art my help and savior,
My God, O [too long] tarry not.
PSALM XLI.
1 Blessed is he who with mercy does
The [poor and] needy's case consider,
For in the troublous evil day
The Lord will him [keep and] deliver.
2 The Lord will him preserve alive,
And [he will] bless him in the land;
And thou will not deliver him
Into his enemies [will and] hand.
3 Upon his bed of languishing,
He shall [by thee] be strengthened;
And in his painful sickness thou
[For ease] wilt make and turn his bed.
4 I prayed and said to thee my God,
[O] be [thou] merciful to me,
And heal my soul of guilt and woe,
That has [by sin] offended thee.
5 Mine enemies speak and wish me ill,
And say, [How long] when will he dye?
That so his name may be forgot,
Or [buried] under slanders lie.
6 Or if he come to visit me,
He speaks [lies and] vanity,
His heart, to tell it all abroad,
Gathers [it self] iniquity.
7 Against me they whisper and plot,
[Then all] that are mine enemies;
Together they some hurt or ill
Against me [daily] do devise.
8 There cleaves to him, say they with joy,
Some ill disease or [mortal] sore;
And now that he does keep his bed,
[Off it] he shall rise up no more.
9 Yea, he with whom I lived in peace,
[Who was] my friend and confident;
Who of my bread did eat, even he
His [scornful] heel against me bent.
10 But thou, O Lord, be merciful
[To me] and raise me up again,
That I in justice may requite
The doings of these [wicked[ men.
11 And by this I may know that I
Am [own'd and] favored by thee,
Because mine enemies do not still
Thus [boast and] triumph over me.
12 Thou me in mine integrity
Upholdest by thy [saving] grace,
And wilt me set for evermore
Before thy [pleased] glorious face.
13 The Lord, the God of Israel,
For ever [prais'd and] blessed be;
From age to age for evermore,
[All Saints] Amen, Amen, say ye.
PSALM XLII.
1 AS the dry Heart for waterbrooks,
In thirst does [fainting] pant and bray,
So after thee, my gracious God,
My [thirsty] soul does pant and pray.
2 My soul for God, the living God
Does thirst, [O when] when shall I come,
And in his house before my God
Appear [with joy] as I have done.
3 My flowing tears have been to me
As [bitter] food both night and day,
While with reproach continually,
[To me] where is thy God, they say?
4 My soul is poured out in me,
When this I [sadly] think upon,
How I with the glad multitude
Unto God's [sacred] house have gone.
I went with them to worship God
With [joyned] voice of joy and praise,
Even with the multitude that kept
[In peace] God's solemn holy days.
5 Why art thou so cast down, my soul,
[And why] so troubled and dismayed?
Trust God, for I shall yet praise him,
Whose [face and] favor is my aid.
6 My God, my soul's cast down in me,
[But yet] remember thee I will;
From Jordan's land, and Hermonites,
And from the [place of] Mizar hill.
7 At thy great water-spout's loud noise,
[Dreadful] deep unto deep does call;
Frightfully over me have gone
Thy [rowling] waves and billows all.
8 Yet will the Lord command for me
His kindest love by [lightsome] day;
By night his song shall be with me:
To God my life [in faith] I Will pray.
9 I Will say to God, My Rock, O why
Am I [of thee] forgotten so?
Why by my foes oppression
Thus mourning do I [daily] go?
10 It Is as a sword within my bones,
When thus my foes do me upbraid;
When in reproach, Where is thy God,
[To me] I hear it daily said?
11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
And why with grief [so much] oppressed?
Why so disquieted in me?
In God still place thy [hope and] rest.
Yet surely I shall speak his praise,
Who [is and] still has been to me
My heart's, my countenances health;
My [ever] gracious God is he.
PSALM XLIII.
1 O God, be thou the Judge,
And plead my righteous cause,
Against a Nation of bad men,
Who violate thy Laws.
From false men of deceit,
Men of Iniquity,
Do thou, the great and righteous God,
Save and deliver me.
2 Thou, Lord, art all my strength,
Why do I mourning go,
As if I were cast off by thee,
Oppressed by my foe?
3 Send out thy Light and Truth,
Let them conduct me still;
And bring me to thy Tabernacles
Upon thy holy hill.
4 I Will to God's Altar go,
To God my greatest joy;
O God my God, to sing thy praise
My harp will I employ.
5 Why art thou, O my soul,
Cast down? what grieveth thee?
Why art thou with distrustful thoughts
Disquieted in me?
Still trust and hope in God,
For him I shall yet praise,
He Is the health of my countenance,
He Will be my God always.
PSALM XLIV.
1 WE with our ears have heard, O God,
Our [ancient] fathers have us told
What work thou in their days have done,
Even in the [famous] times of old.
2 How thou did drive the heathen out,
And plant them in their [pleasant] land
By thy own gift; but did afflict
The [heathen] people with thy hand.
3 Their own sword got not them the land,
Nor their own arm [and strength] them save;
But thy hand and light countenance,
All this thy [love and] favor gave.
4 Thou art my King, for Jacob, Lord,
Deliverance [do thou] command:
5 Through thee we shall push down our foes,
[Even those] that do against us stand.
We through thy name will tread them down,
Who rose [and fought] against us have;
6 For in my bow I will not trust,
Nor shall my sword [or strength] me save.
7 But thou have saved us from our foes,
[And all] our haters put to shame;
8 In God we all the day do boast,
And [we will] ever praise thy name.
9 But now even thou have cast us off,
And us to [open] shame have put;
And when our armies have gone forth,
With them [to war] thou go not out.
10 Thou make us from the enemy
To fly [in fear] and turn our back;
And they who hate us, for themselves,
Our wealth as spoil [away] do take.
11 Thou scatterest us in heathen lands,
And give us [to them] for meat:
12 And sellest us for naught, and do
No [wealth or] increase for us get.
13 Thou make us a mere reproach
To all our neighbors [that are] near;
Derision and a scorn to them
That round about us [dwelling] are.
14 Among the heathen thou do us
A jest and [very] byword make;
The people in contempt and spite,
At us [cast down] their heads do shake.
15 My great confusion and disgrace
I as before me [always] see;
Of my reproached countenance
The shame has [daily] covered me.
16 Because of the reproachers voice,
Which [of thee] speaks blasphemy,
Because of the revenging rage
Of this our [cruel] enemy.
17 All this is come on us, yet we
[O God] have not forgotten thee,
Nor falsely from thy Covenant
Apostatized [and gone] have we.
18 Our heart's not turned back, nor have
Our [going] steps from thy ways strayed;
19 Though thou us among Dragons break'st,
And in death's [covering] shade have laid.
20 If we the Lord's name have forgot,
Or [any] help from Idols sought;
21 Would not God search this out, who knows
The [very] secrets of our thought?
22 We for thy sake are killed all day,
[And] counted [but] as slaughter-sheep*
23 Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off;
Awake [ for us;] why do thou sleep?
24 Wherefore thus hidest thou thy face,
Forgetting [this] our [great] distress;
25 And look not on our miseries,
[Nor them] that do our souls oppress.
26 Our soul is bowed down to dust,
To earth our [very] bellies cleave:
Arise, Lord, for thy mercies sake,
And us [do thou] redeem and save.
PSALM XLV.
1 THe good things of the King I speak,
My [fervent] heart does it indite;
My tongue is as the pen of one
That [very] readily does write.
2 Thou fairer art than sons of men,
[Plenteous] grace to thy lips does flow;
Therefore great blessings evermore
God [doth and] will on thee bestow.
3 O thou that art the mighty one,
Thy [warlike] sword gird on thy thigh,
4 In all thy glory excellent,
And in thy [splendid] majesty.
In state do thou ride prosperously,
For [meekness] truth and righteousness,
And dreadful things thy strong right hand
Shall [do and] reach thee by success.
5 Thine arrows are sharp in the hearts
Of the King's [hateful] enemies,
Whereby the people under thee
[Shall] fall that [do] against thee rise.
6 For ever and for ever, Lord,
Abides thy [Royal] Throne of might;
The Scepter of thy Kingdom is
A Scepter that is [just and] right.
7 Thou love the right, and hate ill,
Therefore thy God [doth and] still shall
With Oil of gladness thee anoint,
[Even much] above thy fellows all.
8 Of Aloes, Myrrh, and Cassia
A [pleasant] smell thy garments had,
Out of the Ivory palaces,
Whereby they [greatly] made thee glad.
9 Among thy women honorable,
Kings daughters [waiting] were at hand;
And on thy right hand did the Queen
In [precious] gold of Ophir stand.
10 Hearken, O daughter, and advise;
To me incline [and bow] thine ear;
Thy people and thy father's house
Forget [thou must] and count not dear.
11 And then thy beauty to the King
Shall always [very] pleasant be;
And do thou humbly worship him,
Seeing thy [rightful] Lord is he.
12 The daughter there of wealthy Tire
With a rich gift shall [waiting] be;
And all the rich throughout the land
Shall [humbly] make their suit to thee.
13 Within does the King's daughter sit,
[And is] all glorious to behold;
And all her clothes and ornaments
Are [richly] wrought of purest gold.
14 She shall be brought unto the King
In [splendid] robes by needle wrought;
The Virgins which do follow her,
[With her] shall unto thee be brought.
15 With gladness great shall they be brought,
And [signs of] joy on every side,
Into the presence of the King,
The Court where he does [use to] bide.
16 And thou shall in thy father's stead
Thy numerous [blessed] offspring take,
And in all Countries of the earth
Thou shall them [honoured] Princes make.
17 I will to generations all
Thy [name and] memory extend;
The peoples joyful praise of thee
Shall [last and] never have an end.
PSALM XLVI.
1 GOd is our refuge, and our strength,
A present help, and [always] near
In all our dangers and distress,
Therefore we will not [need not] fear.
2 Though the whole earth removed were,
And though the mountains [high and] steep
Be moved and carried from their place,
And cast into the [Ocean] deep.
3 And though the Seas tempestuous waves
Disturbed, a [hideous] roaring make;
And though the waters swelling rage
Do make the [neighbour] mountains quake.
4 There is a River, whose pure streams
God's [blessed] City do make glad;
The holy place, where the most high
His dwelling [hath and] long has had.
5 The Lord is in the midst of her,
Nothing shall her [shake and] remove:
The Lord himself right early will
[To] her [a] faithful helper prove.
6 The heathens raged tumultuously,
The [neighbour] Kingdoms moved were;
He uttered his powerful voice,
The earth did melt [as if] for fear.
7 The Lord himself does take our part,
Who does all hosts [and powers] command;
For our sure refuge Jacob's God,
As our high place does [alway] stand.
8 Come and behold what wondrous works
The Lord [himself] has for us wrought;
What desolations on the earth
His [dreadful] executions brought.
9 Through all the earth he makes war cease,
And into [wished] peace it turns;
He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear,
With fire the [warlike] chariot burns.
10 Be still, and know that I am God*
And will [o're all] exalted be;
The heathen shall exalt my name,
[And all] the earth shall honor me.
11 The Lord who does all hosts command,
Is [ever] on his peoples side;
And our sure refuge Jacob's God
[Is and] for ever will abide.
PSALM XLVII.
By W. Barton.
1 LEt all with sweet accord
Applaud and voices raise
In honor of the Lord,
And loudly sing his praise.
2 For God most high
Is King of Kings, And rules all things
With majesty.
3 Whole nations of our foes
He throws beneath our feet.
4 A happy lot he chose
For us as he thought meet:
The dignity
Of Israel, Beloved well
By the most High.
5 God is gone up on high,
With shouts and trumpets sound,
Ascending gloriously
Unto the Lord renowned.
6 His praises sing,
And loudly raise Your voice to praise
Our heavenly King.
7 For God is sovereign King,
And Lord of all the earth;
With understanding sing,
And set his praises forth.
8 God reigns alone
Over heathen men, Sitting upon
His holy throne.
9 The Princes gather there,
The Princes of all lands;
The people far and near,
Whom Abraham's God commands.
The shields are his,
Of all the earth, God's name and worth
Exalted is.
PSALM XLVIII.
1 GReat is the Lord, and greatly he
[By all] is to be praised still,
Within the City of our God,
Upon his holy [Sion] hill.
2 Mount Sion's situate beauteously,
[It is] the joy of all the earth;
The City of the great King stands
On her side [which is] toward the North.
3 God in her palaces is known
[To be] a refuge and defense;
4 The Kings against her gathered were,
But past [away] together thence.
5 When viewing it, they saw its strength,
They wondering [at it] would not stay,
But being troubled at the sight,
They [quickly] thence did have away.
6 Even like a laboring woman's pain,
Fear seized [on them] and drove them back;
7 As the East Wind does Tarshish Ships
In pieces break and [bring to] wrack.
8 As we have heard, so have we seen,
That God's own [chosen] Sion's hill,
And City of the Lord of Hosts,
God [surely] will establish still*
9 All thy great loving kindness, Lord,
We [gladly] did commemorate;
When with thy worshippers we did
Within thy Temple [daily] wait.
10 According to thy Name, O Lord,
So [great and] famous is thy praise
To the earth's ends: Thy right hand's full
Of [perfect] righteousness always.
11 Because of all thy judgments just,
Let [thy own] Sion Mount rejoice;
Let Judah's daughters gladness show
With [thanks and] cheerful heart and voice.
12 Walk about Sion, view her round,
Her [many] stately Towers tell:
13 Consider her fair Palaces,
And mark her [Forts and] Bulwarks well.
That you may tell posterity:
14 For this God [is and] will abide
Our God for ever: He will be
Even unto death our [strength and] guide.
PSALM XLIX.
1 HEar this, all people, and give ear
[All you] that in the world do dwell;
2 Both low and high, both rich and poor,
My mouth [to you] shall wisdom tell.
3 My heart shall knowledge meditate;
I will [also] incline mine ear
4 To parables: And on the harp
My sayings dark [I will] declare.
5 Why should I fear in evil days,
When [fruits of] mine iniquities
Of my own he will surround me with
[Many] deserved calamities.
6 As for those men, who in their wealth
And [worldly] treasure put their trust;
And in their riches multitude,
And great estates do [make their] boast.
7 None of them can his brother's life
Redeem by any [means or] way;
Nor can he for him unto God
[Any] sufficient ransom pay.
8 To redeem life's impossible,
And [therefore] it can never be,
9 That he should always live on earth,
And not [common] corruption see.
10 For that both wise and fools do die,
They [daily] see and must perceive;
And wordly brutish men at death
Their [loved] wealth to others leave.
11 Their inward thought is that their house
And [stately] dwelling-places shall
Stand through all ages; they their lands
[Therefore] by their own names do call.
12 Nevertheless none of them all
[On earth] abide in honor must;
Their flesh must perish as the beasts,
That dies and turns to [common] dust.
13 Thus brutish folly plainly is
Their [boast and] chosen worldly way;
Yet their deceived posterity
Do [like and] follow what they say.
14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave,
And [hungry] death shall them devour;
And in the morning upright men
Shall over them have [ruling] power.
Their strength and beauty shall consume,
And [it shall] perish in the grave;
When carried from their houses, they
Shall their [in dust] their dwelling have.
15 But God will sure redeem my soul
From the hand of [death and] the grave;
For he my hope savior is,
And he [himself] will me receive.
16 Be not discouraged by fear,
When wicked men grow [great and] rich;
And when the glory of their house,
[Their pomp] and power increases much.
17 For he shall carry nothing hence,
When [certain] death his days shall end;
Nor shall his glory after him
Into the [loathsome] grave descend.
18 Though he his flattered soul did bless,
Whilst he on earth [in wealth] did live;
And when thy courses prosperous are,
[Worldly] men will thee praises give.
19 Yet shall he to his fathers go,
Who lived here [on earth] before;
And shall be laid among the dead,
Who [here shall] see the light no more*
20 Man that in worldly honor lives,
And [God's Word] understands not,
Is nothing better than the beasts
That [die and] in the grave do rot*
PSALM L.
1 THe Lord the mighty God
Spoke, and the earth did call
From the Sunrising to the place
Of its descent and fall.
2 Out of holy Sion,
Beauty's perfection,
The Lord has shined unto man.
3 Our God shall surely come.
He shall not silent be;
Before him fire does burn,
And round about he dreadful is,
By his tempestuous storm.
4 And from the heavens above
His powerful voice shall call;
And to the earth below, that he
May judge his people all.
5 Together let my Saints
To me assembled be;
Those that by sacrifice have made
A Covenant with me.
6 The heavens themselves then shall
His righteousness declare,
For it is the great God himself
By whom all judged are.
7 My people, hear my words,
And what I testify
Against thee, sinful Israel,
God, even thy God am I.
8 For want of sacrifice
To me I judge thee not;
Nor because thy burnt-offerings were
Neglected or forgot.
9 I Will take no calf or goats
From house or fold of thine;
10 The forest-beasts, and cattle all
On thousand hills are mine.
11 The fowls on mountains high
Are all to me well known;
Wild beasts which in the fields abide,
Are all of them my own.
12 And if I hungry were,
I would not tell it thee;
For the whole world, and Its fullness
Does all belong to me.
13 I Will not eat flesh of bulls,
Nor goats blood drink will I.
14 Offer true thanks to God, and pay
Thy vows to the most high.
15 And call thou upon me
In thy most troublous days,
And then will I deliver thee,
And thou shall give me praise.
16 But to the wicked man,
God says, My word of truth
Should thou declare? how dare thou take
My Covenant in thy mouth?
17 Since thou instruction hat'st,
which should thy life direct,
And my commands behind thy back
Do cast, and them reject.
18 When thou a thief did see,
With him thou then consent'st;
And with the foul adulterer
Thou a partaker went.
19 Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,
Thy tongue deceit does frame;
20 Against thy brother thou do speak,
Thy mothers son defame.
21 Because I silence kept,
Whilst thou these things have wrought,
That I was such a one as thou,
Was thine ungodly thought.
But I will thee reprove,
And set before thine eyes
In order all thy sinful deeds,
And thine iniquities.
22 Now you that God forget,
In time this well consider,
Lest I in pieces tear you all,
And none can you deliver.
23 Whosoever does offer praise,
Does rightly honor me;
And he that orders well his ways,
Shall God's salvation see.
PSALM LI.
1 AFter thy loving kindness, Lord,
Some pity on a sinner take,
Blot out my heinous trespasses,
Good Lord, for thy great mercies sake*
2 O wash me thoroughly from my sin,
Cleanse me from mine iniquities;
3 For my transgressions I confess,
My sin is still before mine eyes.
4 Against thee, O my God, I sinned,
And did this evil in thy sight;
And if I were therefore condemned,
Yet were thy judgments just and right.
5 Thou know that in iniquity
My shape and nature I received;
As guilty and defiled by sin
My sinful mother me conceived.
6 I know that which thou do desire
Is truth within the secret heart;
And wisdom thou will make me know
Even in the hidden inward part.
7 With sacred Hyssop purge thou me,
And then I shall be cleansed so:
Wash thou me (in my Savior's blood)
And I shall whiter be than snow.
8 Of joy and gladness make thou me
To hear again the welcome voice,
That so the bones which thou for sin
Have justly broken, may rejoice.
9 From the beholding of my sin,
O turn away thy angry face;
And all my great iniquity
Blot out, and utterly deface.
10 O God, create in me a heart
Clean and unspotted in thy sight;
And by thy grace in me renew
A spirit sincere and upright.
11 And from thy gracious presence, Lord,
Do not this sinner cast away;
And of thy holy quickening spirit
Deprive me not, I humbly pray.
12 Let the joy of thy saving grace
To my sad soul restored be;
And with thy free enlarging spirit
Uphold, confirm, and comfort me.
13 Then I will teach thy holy ways
To those that now transgressors be*
And so ungodly sinful men
Shall be converted unto thee.
14 O thou the God of all my hopes,
Deliver me from guilt of blood;
Then of thy saving righteousness
My joyful tongue shall sing aloud.
15 Open my lips, which by my sin
Now silenced and closed are;
And then shall my enlarged mouth
Thy praises publicly declare.
16 I know it is not sacrifice
Which thou requirest I should bring,
Else would I give it: Nor art thou
Delighted with burnt-offering.
17 The sacrifice which pleases God,
Is a repenting broken spirit;
O God, thou never wilt despise
A heart that is broken and contrite.
18 In thy good pleasure, Lord, do good
To Sion and thy people all;
Of thy beloved Jerusalem
Do thou build up the broken wall.
19 The sacrifice of righteousness
Shall then be pleasing unto thee;
Better than whole burnt-offerings then
Shall on thine Altar offered be.
PSALM LII.
1 O Mighty man in wickedness,
Why boastest thou [thy self] with pride?
God's goodness to his people will
[Surely] for evermore abide.
2 Thy tongue speaks mischief, which thy heart
[Plots and] devises wickedly;
And like a sharpened rasor cuts,
And works [by lies] deceitfully.
3 Thou love evil more than good,
And lying more than [to speak] right;
Thou false tongue all devouring words
Thou love with [cruel] delight.
4 God shall for ever cut thee down,
And [he shall] take thee quite away;
And pluck thee from thy dewlling place,
And from [among] the living slay.
PSALM LIII.
1 THe lives of fools do tell us that
Their hearts no God do [truly] own:
Corrupt are they; odious their works,
[Of them] that do good there is none.
2 Upon the wicked sons of men,
From heaven God looked [on earth] abroad,
To see if any understood
And seriously sought [after] God.
3 But they all filthy are become,
They all [from God] are backward gone;
None of them lives in doing good,
Of all these [wicked] men not one.
4 Have all these men of wicked works
No [wit or] knowledge left at all?
Who eat my people up as bread,
On God they never [truly] call.
5 By guilt and God's affrighting hand,
With fear they were [greatly] dismayed;
And fled in terror, when no cause
Was seen [for them] to be afraid.
For God their bones that thee besieged,
Has [justly] scattered all abroad;
To shame thou have put them, because
Despised they were [and are] of God.
6 Let Israel's help from Sion come;
When God brings back the [Captives] sad,
His saved people shall rejoice,
And [his true] Israel be glad.
PSALM LIVE.
1 SAve me, O God, by thy great name,
And judge me by thy [mighty] strength.
2 My prayer hear, O God, give ear
Unto my [suit and] words at length.
3 0ppressors seek after my life,
Strangers against me [joyntly] rise,
Because they have not set the Lord
[At all] with fear before their eyes.
4 But yet the Lord my helper is,
[Therefore] in him my soul is bold,
And with the just he takes part,
Who do my soul [help and] uphold.
5 He shall repay hurt to my foes,
Who me with hate [watch and] observe;
According to thy truth cut off
These [wicked] men as they deserve.
6 Then I Will bring sacrifice to thee,
O Lord, with [chearful] willingness;
And praise thy name: for it is good
Thy [holy] praises to express.
7 When he has me delivered
Out of [my great] adversities;
And when my eyes his justice see
On all my [wicked] enemies.
PSALM LV.
1 LOrd hear my suit, hide not thy self
From my entreating [earnest] voice.
2 Attend and hear me in my plaint;
Regard my [sad and] mournful noise.
3 Because of enemies slandrous voice,
And [wicked] men's oppression great;
On me they cast iniquity,
And me in [cruel] wrath they hate.
4 My heart in me sore pained is,
Death's [shaking] terrors on me fall.
5 On me come trembling fear; and dread
Has covered me [o're whelm'd] withal.
6 O that I had wings like a dove,
Said I, [away] then would I flee;
And seek out some retiring place,
Where I in [quiet] rest might be.
7 Lo then would I wander far off,
And in the [remote] desert stay.
8 From windy storms and tempests I
Would [for peace] have to escape away.
9 Destroy thou them, O Lord, and let
Their [combin'd] tongues divided be;
10 For violence and hurtful strife
I in the [envious] City see.
Day and night on the walls thereof,
They [fiercely] go about it round;
Contrived mischief and hurtfulness
[There] in [the] midst of it are found.
11 Even in the midst and chiefest part
There [dwells and] reigns wickedness;
And from her streets do not depart
Guile [falshood] and deceitfulness.
12 It was no foe that me reproached,
For this [from such] I could endure;
No known foe did against me rise,
Else hid [from him] I Would me secure.
13 But he mine equal and my guide,
And my familiar [neighbour] was;
14 Together we sweet counsel took,
And to God's house [conjoyn'd] did pass.
15 Let death seize on them; let them go
Down quick into the [wicked's] grave;
For in their dwellings wickedness
They for their [chosen] business have.
16 I Will call on God, he will me save;
I Will pray [to him] aloud I Will cry,
17 Evening and morning, and at noon;
My [craving] voice he will not deny.
18 Against me when they raised war,
He did my soul [keep and] set free;
And he preserved me as in peace,
For [through him] many were with me.
19 My God shall hear, and them afflict,
[Even God] who is the same of old.
They fear not God, because they have
No changes, but [in sin] are bold.
20 Against them that with him had peace
He has put forth his treacherous hand;
The Covenant which he has made,
By breaking [falsly] he profaned.
21 Smoother than butter were his words,
While in his heart [design'd] was war;
His speeches were softer than Oil,
But [hurtful] as drawn swords they are.
22 Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,
And he shall [surely] thee sustain:
And by his grace the righteous men
Unmoved [ever] shall remain.
23 But thou, Lord, wilt these wicked men,
In justice [judge and] overthrow;
And in destruction's dismal pit
Wilt [shortly] cast and lay them low.
The bloody and deceitful men
Shall not live [out one] half their days;
But upon thee with confidence
[My God] I will rely always.
PSALM LVI.
By W. Barton.
1 HAve mercy, Lord, on me,
Whom man would make a prey;
Behold how he oppresses me,
Contending every day.
2 They that mine enemies be,
Would daily me devour;
For multitudes against me fight,
O thou of highest power.
3 What time soever, Lord,
I am of such afraid,
Even then will I trust faithfully
On thy assured aid.
4 In God I Will praise his word,
In God my trust shall be;
And secure there, I will not fear
What flesh can do to me.
5 My words they utter wrong,
And wrest them every day;
Their thoughts are still to work me ill
In whatsoever they say.
6 They altogether throng,
They hide themselves likewise;
They lie at catch, my steps they watch,
My life for to surprise.
7 Thall they escape so well
In this their wicked path?
Upon them frown, and, Lord cast down
This people in thy wrath.
8 Thou do my wanderings tell,
Let down thy bottle, Lord,
And put in there each briny tear,
Are they not on record?
9 When I shall cry to thee,
It puts to sudden flight
My daunted foe; and this I know,
For God defends my right.
10 In God enabling me,
I will his word proclaim;
Yea, in the Lord will I record
His word's due praise and fame.
11 In God alone have I
Reposed my trust for aid;
Let mortal man do what he can,
I will not be afraid.
12 Thy Vows upon me lie;
Lord, I must pay the same:
And I always will render praise
To thy most holy name.
13 For thou my soul have freed
From death so near at had;
And wilt not thou uphold me now,
And make my feet to stand?
That I may still proceed
To walk as in thy sight;
And spend my days unto thy praise
With them that live in light.
PSALM LVII.
1 BE merciful to me, O God,
For mercy I [in thee] do trust;
Under thy wings I refuge seek,
Till this distress be [over] past.
2 My cry I will cause to ascend
Unto the Lord [who is] most high;
To God who does all things for me
[Ever] perform most faithfully.
3 He shall send down from Heaven, and me
From his [unjust] reproach defend
That would devour me: God his truth
And [saving] mercy sorth shall send.
4 My soul among fierce Lions is,
I [burning] firebrarnds lie among;
Even men whose teeth are spears and darts,
A [cutting] sharp sword is their tongue.
5 Above the highest Heavens, O God,
Be thou [in might] exalted high;
And over all the earth below
Show forth thy [Glorious] Majesty.
6 They for my steps prepared a net,
My soul [by them] is bowed down;
They dig'd a pit for me, in which
Themselves are [fallen and] overthrown.
7 My heart is fixed, my heart is fixed,
O God, I Will sing thy joyful praise.
8 My glory wake: Psaltery and Harp,
My self [for this] I Will early raise.
9 Among the people I Will thee praise,
With [publick] songs thee magnify.
10 Thy mercies great unto the heavens,
Thy truth unto the [cloudy] sky.
11 Exalted be thy glorious name,
[O God] above the heavens high;
And over all the earth advance
Thy glorious [pow'r and] majesty.
PSALM LVIII.
1 DO you that are in Council met,
[Speak and] determine what is just;
And justly judge, ye sons of men,
[Indeed] according to your trust?
2 Yea, in your hearts you wickedness
Contrive, [plot, and] promote, and then
Out of the Judgment-seats your hands
Weigh violence [on earth] to men.
3 Bad men are from the womb estranged,
From every just and holy way;
As soon as they are born, they are
Inclined [by lies] to go astray.
4 To serpent's poison very like,
Their [hurtful] poison does appear;
And like the adder deaf they are,
That fast does [close and] stop her ear.
5 Lest she should hear the charmer's voice
[At all] although the man should charm
Never so wisely, to inchant
Her, that she do no [deadly] harm.
6 Break thou their poisonous teeth, O God,
[Yea] from their mouth [quite] break them out;
Yea, break the sharp devouring teeth.
Of Lions [even the] young and stout.
7 Let them like waters melt away,
Which downward still do [slide and] flow;
In pieces cut his arrows all
When he does bend his [unjust] bow.
8 Like to a snail that melts away,
Let them all [pass and] hence be gone;
That like the womb's untimely birth,
They never see the [shining] sun.
9 Before your pots can feel the thorns,
Away [in wrath] he shall them drive;
And with his whirlwind's angry storms
Sweep them away [from hence] alive.
10 The righteous shall rejoice, when he
[This just] revenge from God shall see;
And in the blood of wicked men
Even wash his [conquering] feet shall he.
11 Then men shall say, Truly there is
For righteous men [a great] reward:
Surely there is a God that does
The earth judge, and [mens works] regard.
PSALM LIX.
1 DEliver me, O God,
From all mine enemies;
Set me in safety from all them
That do against me rise.
2 Deliver me from them
That work-iniquity;
Save me from men of blood, who for
My life in wait do lie.
3 Against me the great men
Have jointly gathered bin,
But not for my transgression, Lord,
Nor real guilt of sin.
4 They run and do prepare
Themselves without any crime;
Behold their course, and now awake,
And help thou me betime.
5 Awake to visit such,
Lord God of Israel;
And spare not those, who against thee
Do wickedly rebel.
6 At evening they return,
Like dogs they make a noise,
And round about the City go
With dogged snarling voice.
7 Their mouths do belch out rage,
And in their lips are swords;
For still they do persuade themselves
Thou hear not their words.
8 Thou, Lord, wilt them despise,
And all the heathen mock:
9 His strength shall make me wait on thee,
Thou art my help and rock.
10 The God of my mercies
With help shall me prevent,
And let me see on these my foes
His righteous punishment.
11 Lest it should be forgot,
Scatter them all abroad,
And bring them down, but slay them not,
O thou our shield and God.
12 For the sin of their words,
Take thou them in their pride;
And for the curses and the lies
Which from their lips do slide.
13 In wrath consume them all,
That so they may not be;
That Jacob's God rules through the earth,
Let them all know and see.
14 At even let them return,
And make, like dogs, a noise;
And round about the City go
With discontented voice.
Let them wander about,
As wanting food to eat;
And pine and grudge through emptiness,
Not satisfied with meat.
16 I of thy power will sing,
Early thy mercy praise;
Thou my defense and refuge wast
In all my troublous days.
17 Unto thee I will sing,
Who art my strength and power;
The God of all my mercies, and
My sure defense and tower.
PSALM LX.
1 LOrd, thou of late have cast us off,
And [thou hast] scattered us abroad;
Thou justly have displeased been,
O turn [again] to us, O God.
2 Thou made the earth it self to quake,
Thine [heavy] anger did it break:
O heal thou now its grievous breach,
For it as yet does [sorely] shake.
3 Unto thy people thou hard things
Have showed, and [sharply] on them sent;
And thou have caused them to drink
[The] wine of [great] astonishment.
4 And yet a banner thou have given
To them that do thee [humbly] fear,
That it by them because of truth,
Displayed may [to all] appear.
5 That thy dearly beloved flock
[Sav'd and] delivered may be:
Help, O our God with thy right hand,
In mercy [do thou] answer me.
6 I will rejoice, because the Lord
Spoke from his [high and] holy seat,
Sechem I will divide, and will
The [fruitful] Vale of Succoth mete.
7 Gilead belongs unto me,
Manasseh [also] mine shall be;
Ephraim is the strength of my head,
Judah [rules and] gives Laws for me.
8 Moab my servile wash-pot is,
On Edom I will [freely] tread;
And the Philistine nation all
I will in [warlike] triumph lead.
9 Who is he that will bring me in
The City [strong and] fortified?
And who will into Edom's land
[Me and] my conquering armies guide?
10 Even he that seemed to cast us off,
And wilt not thou [again] O God,
Go forth before our warlike hosts,
When they [to fight] do march abroad?
11 From trouble give us thy sure help,
For [meerly] vain is all men's aid:
12 Through God we shall do valiantly,
Our foes God down [for us] will tread.
PSALM LXI.
1 HEar thou my cries, O God,
Unto my prayer attend:
2 Even from the ends of all the earth
My cry to thee I send.
When my heart's overwhelmed
With my perplexity,
Lead me to the defensive Rock
That higher is than I.
3 For thou have been to me
A shelter by thy power;
And from the rage of enemies
A strong defensive tower.
4 I in thy Tabernacle
For ever will abide,
Under the covert of thy wings
With trust will I reside.
5 For thou my solemn vows
To thee, my God, did hear;
And gave me the heritage
Of those thy name that fear.
6 A life by thee prolonged,
Thou to the King wilt give,
As many generations are
The life that he shall live.
7 For ever before God
His dwelling he shall have;
Prepare thy mercy and thy truth,
Which him may ever save.
8 So will I evermore
Sing praises to thy name,
That having made my vows, I may
Daily perform the same.
PSALM LXII.
1 MY soul in silence waits on God,
My only help [and rock] is he.
2 My Savior and my strong high place,
I shall not [greatly] moved be.
3 How long will ye mischief devise?
You by the sword [at last] shall fall:
You stand but like a tottering fence,
And like a [crazed] bowing wall.
4 Their consult is to cast him down
That Is set [by God] in dignity.
They love to lie; with mouth they bless*
But they [hate and] curse inwardly.
5 My soul wait thou only on God,
[For all] my hope's on him alone;
6 He Is all my strength, help, and defense,
I shall not be [mov'd and] overthrown.
7 All my salvation is in God,
My glory and [my] dignity;
He is the Rock of all my strength,
God is my refuge [always] nigh.
8 At all times put your trust in him,
Ye people that [indeed] are his;
Pour out your hearts before him still,
For God our [certain] refuge is.
9 Surely low men are vanity,
And [high and] great men are a lie;
Together in the balance put,
[They] lighter [are] than vanity.
10 Trust ye not in oppression then,
In theft [and wrong] become not vain:
Set not your hearts on wealth, and on
The increase of your [worldly] gain.
11 This God has spoken once, and twice
This [certain] truth I heard again;
That all disposing Ruling Power
To God [alone] does appertain.
12 And to distribute Mercy does
Belong to thee [O Lord] alone;
For thou according to his work
Rendrest [in time] to every one.
PSALM LXIII.
1 O God, thou art my God, therefore
[Early] I Will seek near thee to be;
In an unwater'd weary land
My [heart and] flesh does thirst for thee.
2 That I thy power may behold,
And [see the] glory of thy face,
As I have seen thee heretofore
Within thy [house and] holy place.
3 Because thy loving kindness is
Better than [life and]- length of days;
My joyful soul which thou have saved,
And lips shall [ever] give thee praise.
4 While thou continuest me in life,
Thus will I [daily] speak thy praise;
In worshipping thy holy name
My [heart and] hands I will up raise.
5 With thy fat-sweet delights my soul
Shall [fed and] satisfied be;
My cheerful heart with joyful lips
Shall offer [daily] praise to thee.
6 When on my quiet bed I thee
[Seek and] remember with delight;
And when on thee I meditate
In [silent] watches of the night.
7 Because to me in all distress
Thy [helping] hand still succor brings,
Therefore my soul shall still rejoice
Under thy [safe and] covering wings.
8 My soul (encouraged by thy love)
Thus [closely] follows after thee;
In all my dangers and distress
Thy [right] hand [still] upholdeth me.
9 But they that seek my life shall go
Into earth's [dark and] lowest room;
10 The sword let out their guilty souls,
[And they] the foxes prey become.
11 But let the King rejoice in God;
His [faithful] servants glory shall,
Who swear by him: But God will stop
The mouth of [perjur'd] liars all.
PSALM LXIV.
1 THe Prayer which to thee I make,
O God [do thou] vouchsafe to hear;
My life save thou from enemies,
And from [all their] perplexing fear.
2 Hide me from their secret designs,
Who do live [and plot] wickedly;
From insurrection of those men
That [still do] work iniquity.
3 Who do their tongues with malice whet,
That they may cut like [sharpned] swords;
In whose bent bows are arrows set,
[To shoot] even false and bitter words.
4 That they may at the perfect man
In secret aim their [cruel] shot;
Suddenly do they shoot at him,
Hardened [in sin] they fear it not.
5 In ill encourage they themselves,
And commune how [closely] to lay
Their snares for to entrap the just,
For who [our plots] shall see, say they?
6 They study for iniquity,
For it they use their [greatest] art;
Deep is their inward plotting thought,
And unknown is their [wicked] heart.
7 God shall an arrow at them shoot,
And wound them [deep and] suddenly.
8 Their tongues shall fall upon themselves,
All that see them [away] shall fly.
9 And seeing this, all men shall fear,
And shall God's [dreadful] works declare;
For wisely then they shall perceive
That these his [righteous] doings are.
10 The righteous shall rejoice in God,
And in him [wholly] put their trust;
And all that be of upright heart,
In him shall [boldly] make their boast.
PSALM LXV.
1 LOrd, praise in Sion waits for thee,
The Vows made [by us] we'll perform.
O thou that hear sincere prayer,
To thee all flesh [for help] shall come.
Injuries and iniquities
Against me have [had much] success,
^ut thou will purge away the sin
[And guilt] of us who did transgress.
4 Blessed is he whom thou do choose
To approach [nigh to] thee his God;
That in thy holy pleasant Courts
He may have his [constant] abode.
Our souls shall satisfied be
With the goodness and [Divine] grace
Which in thy blessed house abounds,
Even in thy chosen [holy] place.
5 Thy Justice will by dreadful things
An answer to us [waiting] give;
God of our help, the trust of all
On earth or [on the] sea that live.
6 The God of Power, who by strength
Set'st fast the [great and] massy hills.
7 Who the great noise of sea and waves,
And [raging] people's tumult stills.
8 Those that in utmost parts do dwell,
Are at thy [dreadful] signs afraid;
Mornings and evenings outgoings
By thee [sing and] are joyful made.
9 The earth thou visit'st, watering it,
Enriched [by thee] with fruit to grow;
By God's full streams: Thou Corn prepar'st,
Having [for it] provided so.
10 Her ridges thou do water well,
Her [plowed] surrows settlest;
With showers thou do make it soft,
Her [springing] fruit by thee is blessed.
11 Thus thou the year from time to time
Do with thy [bounteous] goodness crown,
And thy high paths do from above
On earth drop [plenteous] fatness down.
12 They drop upon the pasture-grounds
That lie [even] in [the] desert wide,
The little hills thereby refreshed,
Rejoice [with fruit] on every side.
13 The pastures clothed are with Flocks,
The valleys [also] covered be
With Corn: Thy blessing is their joy,
Their fruits sing [praises] unto thee.
PSALM LXVI.
1 MAke ye a joyful noise to God
All people of the [spacious] earth.
2 Sing to the honor of his name,
His glorious praise [do ye] set forth.
3 Say unto God, How-terrible
In all thy [mighty] works art thou?
Through thy great power thy foes to thee
Shall be constrained to [crouch and] bow.
4 All men on earth shall worship thee,
Thy praise in songs [shall they] proclaim;
They shall sing Psalms of praise unto
The honor of thy [holy] name.
5 Come, and the works which God has wrought,
With [fear and] admiration see;
His doings toward the sons of men
All great and [very] dreadful be.
6 He turned the Sea into dry land,
And they [thereby] safe passage had;
All marching through the flood on foot,
There [singing] we in him were glad.
7 He ever rules by his power;
His eyes [do all] the Nations see:
The Rebels that exalt themselves,
By him [full low] shall humbled be.
8 Ye people sound forth of our God
Aloud the voice of [his high] praise;
9 Who puts and holds our soul in life,
Our feet from [hurtful] sliding stays.
10 For thou did prove and try us, Lord,
As men [by fire] do silver try;
11 Brought us into the net, and layd'st
[Bonds of] grief on our loins to lie.
12 Over our heads thou made men ride,
Through fire and [water] floods to pass;
But thou through all have brought us out
Into a [water'd] wealthy place.
13 I Will bring burnt-offerings to thy house,
[And all] my vows to thee I Will pay,
14 Which my lips uttered, and mouth spoke,
When I in [grievous] trouble lay.
15 Burnt sacrifices of fat Rams,
With Incense I [to thee] will bring;
Of Bullocks, and of Goats, I will*
Present [to thee] an offering.
16 Come now and hearken to my words,
All you that have God's [holy] fear,
And what he for my soul has done,
To you I will [forthwith] declare.
17 In my distress my mouth to him
Sent forth my [humble] earnest cry;
And his great name I with my tongue
[With praise] extolled fervently.
18 I know if I do in my heart
Iniquity [love and] regard,
When I to him my prayer make,
I shall not then [by him] be heard.
19 But God did hear me readily,
And [he did] graciously attend
Unto my praying voice and cry,
Which I to him did [humbly] send.
20 And blessed be the Lord my God,
Who has not [from me] turned away
His mercy; not denied my suit
When I to him did [seek and] pray.
PSALM LXVII. The old Meter, Corrected
by W. Barton*
1 HAve mercy on us, Lord,
And grant to us thy grace,
And unto us do thou afford
The brightness of thy face.
2 That all the earth may know
The way to godly wealth,
And all the people here below
May see thy saving health.
3 Let all the world, O God,
Give praise unto thy name;
O let the people all abroad
Extol and laud the same.
4 Throughout the world so wide,
Let all rejoice with mirth;
For thou shall justly judge and guide
The nations of the earth.
5 Let all the world, O God,
Give praise unto thy name,
And let the people all abroad
Extol and laud the same.
6 Then shall the earth increase,
Great store of fruit shall fall,
And God our God shall grant us peace,
And greatly bless us all.
7 Yea, God shall bless us all,
And earth both far and near;
And people all in general
Of him shall stand in fear.
The same by the Scots.
1 LOrd, unto us be merciful,
Do thou us also bless,
And graciously make shine on us
The brightness of thy face.
2 That so thy way upon the earth
To all men may be known,
Also among the nations all
Thy saving health be known.
3 O Let the people praise thee, Lord,
Let people all thee praise:
4 And let the nations all be glad,
And sing for joy always.
For rightly thou shall people judge,
And nations rule on earth:
5 Let people praise thee, Lord, let all
The folk praise thee with mirth.
6 Then shall the earth yield her increase,
God, our God, bless us shall.
7 God shall us bless, and of the earth
The ends shall fear him all.
PSALM LXVIII.
1 LEt God arise, and scattered
Let all his [daring] enemies be;
And let all those that do him hate,
From his just [face and] presence flee.
2 Drive them away as smoke is driven,
As wax melts at the [burning] fire,
Let wicked men before God's face
So perish by his [righteous] ire.
3 But let the righteous all be glad,
[Greatly] rejoicing in God's sight;
Let them addict themselves to joy,
And this [express] with all their might.
4 Sing unto God, his praises sing,
Extol him with your [chearful] voice,
That rides on Heaven: By his name JAH,
Before his [gracious] face rejoice.
5 A father of the fatherless,
And judge of [helpless] widows case
Is God, whom we adore and praise,
Even in his holy [dwelling] place.
6 The barren, God in families
Does set: I, he from [iron] bands
The bound sets free; while Rebels dwell
[In want] in dry and barren lands.
7 O God of old when thou went forth
Before thy [ransom'd] peoples face,
And through the barren wilderness
[Thou] did [as] their Conductor pass.
8 At God's presence the earth did shake,
From heaven the [dropping] showers fell;
Sinai was at God's presence moved.
[Before] the God of Israel.
9 O God, thou healed'st the desart's drought,
Sending [to it] a plenteous rain,
Whereby thy weary heritage
Thou did confirm [and own] again.
10 Thy Congregation then did make
Their [setled] habitation there,
And of thy goodness for the poor,
O God, thou did [relief] prepare
11 The public word of joy to us
Was given out by [thee, O] God;
Great was the company of them
That [quickly] published it abroad.
12 Kings of great armies terrified,
Were forced [apare] to flee away;
And she that tarryed at home
Did [share and] distribute the prey.
13 Though you have lien among the pots,
Like [beauteous] doves you shall appear,
Whose wings with silver and with gold
Their [yellow] feathers covered are.
14 When the Almighty scattered Kings,
As Salmon snow 'twas [over] white.
15 The hill of God's as Bashan hill,
As Bashan hill [it is] for height.
16 Why leap ye you high hills? This is
The [holy] mount chosen by God,
Where he delights to dwell; on which
He Will [ever] settle his abode.
17 God's Chariots twenty thousand are,
His Angels [many] thousands be;
Among them as in Sinai mount,
So in his [holy] Temple's he.
18 Thou have triumphing gloriously.
Ascended up [to dwell] on high,
And conquering in triumph led
Captive [even our] Captivity.
Thou have received gifts in Man,
[And that] for them that did rebel;
That as their reconciled God
Among them thou [in love] might dwell.
19 Blessed be the Lord, who with his gifts
Of mercy does us [daily] load;
Even he who ever was and is
Of our defense [and help] the God.
20 Our God is he that is the God
Of all [health and] salvation;
The issues and defense from death
Belong to [none but] him alone.
21 But God shall surely wound the head
Of all his [harden'd] enemies,
Their hairy scalp, who shall go on
In their [belov'd] iniquities.
22 God said, I Will bring them back, as I
From Bashan did [for them] before;
And as from the depths of the sea
I brought them safely to the shore.
23 That thy feet may be dipped in blood
Of these thy [stain and] bleeding foes;
And even thy dogs may dip their tongue
In blood which from the [wounded] flows.
24 Thy goings they have seen, O God,
In all thy [glorious] majesty;
The goings of my God and King
In his [sublime] Sanctuary.
25 First went the fingers; next to them
Musicians [follow'd] in array;
Among them all the damsels were
That do on [sounding] Timbrels play.
26 Bless God in your Assemblies all,
Unto him [joyful] praises sing,
All you that of the blessed race
From Israel's [ancient] fountain spring.
27 Benjamin and his Ruler's there,
And Juda's [Ruling] Companies;
And with his Princes Zebulon:
And with them [also] Naphtali's.
28 Thy God commands thy strength; O God,
Confirm what thou [for us] have wrought.
29 For thy house at Jerusalem,
King's Presents shall [to thee] be brought*
30 Spear-men and people rude rebuke,
Till all [of them] submissive are,
And tribute pay: scatter thou them
That do delight in [strife and] war.
31 Princes shall then submit to thee,
And [hither] come from Egypt lands,
And Ethiopia to God
Shall soon stretch out her [subject] hands.
32 Sing unto God adoring praise,
[O] all [ye] people of the earth
Sing praises to the Lord our God
With reverence and [holy] mirth.
33 To him that on the heaven of heavens,
[Which was] of old, does ride, rejoice:
His voice he sends all abroad,
It is a mighty [dreadful] voice.
34 Ascribe ye power unto God,
Who reigns [on high] over Israel;
And his great strength and excellence
Does in the heavens [in glory] dwell.
35 Dreadful out of his holy place
Is [Israel's] God, who does afford
Unto his people strength and power;
Blessed [therefore] be God our Lord.
PSALM LXIX.
1 SAve me, O God, for rising floods
Unto my fearful soul are come.
2 I sink in deep unstable mire,
Deep waters have me overflown.
3 I of my crying weary am,
My voice is hoarse, my throat is dried,
My eyes also do fall, while I
Do waiting for my God abide.
4 More than my hairs of head they be,
Who causeless hatred to me bear,
And my injurious enemies
That would destroy me mighty are.
Then I restored that to them
Which never taken was by me.
5 O God, thou know my foolishness,
And my sins are not hid from thee.
6 Let not them for my sake be shamed,
O Lord of Hosts, that wait on thee;
Nor those that seek thee, Israel's God,
For my own cause confounded be.
7 For thy sake I have born reproach,
And shame has covered my face;
8 I to my brethren strange am grown,
An Alien to my mother's race.
9 Because the zeal did eat me up
Which to thy sacred house I bear,
And the reproaches cast on thee,
Upon me fallen for thy cause are.
10 When I in tears with fasting lay,
This to my own reproach was turned;
A Proverb to them I became
11 When I in sackcloth clothed mourned.
12 The great men that sit in the gate,
Spoke of me all the ill they think;
And I was made the song of them
That are the drinkers of strong drink.
13 But, Lord, in an accepted time
My Prayer I send up to thee;
Lord, in thy mercies multitude,
And in thy saving truth hear me.
14 Deliver me out of the mire,
And me from sinking in it keep;
Save me from them that do me hate,
And out of all these waters deep.
15 Let not the floods me overflow,
Nor let the deeps up swallow me,
And let not the pit's mouth below
Upon me buried closed be.
16 Hear me, O Lord, for thy sure love
And kindness is exceeding good;
Turn thou to me, according to
Thy tender mercies multitude.
17 From thy servant hide not thy face,
In this my trouble soon attend;
18 Draw nigh my soul, and it redeem,
And from mine enemies me defend.
19 To thee is my reproach well known,
My shame and my causeless disgrace;
My adversaries and their ways
Are open all before thy face.
20 Reproach has broke my heart, and grief
Abounds in me: I looked for some
To pity me, but there was none,
True comforters I found not one.
21 They gave me also bitter gall
For food, which they would have me eat;
They gave me vinegar to drink
In scorn, when as my thirst was great.
22 Let their own Table be their snare,
Do thou to them in justice make
Their welfare and posterity
Become a trap themselves to take.
23 And let their eyes so darkened be,
That pleasant light do them forsake;
And let their weakened Ioyns by thee
Be made continually to shake.
24 Thy dreadful indignation
Pour out upon these wicked men;
And let thy hot displeasure, and
Thy heavy wrath take hold on them.
25 And let their stately palaces
Be left as desolate; within
Their tents without inhabitants,
Where these ill men have dwellers bin.
26 Because him whom thou did correct,
Yet they have persecuted more;
They talk unto the grief of those
Whom thou did strike and wound before.
27 Add thou deserved punishment
Unto their heinous wilful sin;
And to thy saying righteousness
Let them not have admission in.
28 Out of the book of living men
Let them by death be blotted quite;
And with the just that blessed are,
Do not their names number and write.
29 But I am poor and sorrowful,
Because of my adversity;
But let thy saving grace, O Lord,
Yet raise and set me up on high.
30 The Name of God I with a song
Will praise and honor joyfully,
And with thanksgiving for his grace,
The Lord's name I will magnify.
31 This also shall a sacrifice
More acceptable to him be
Than Bull or Ox with hoof and horns,
If they were offered by me.
32 The meek and humble shall be glad,
And greatly joy when this they see:
Your hearts shall live that seek the Lord,
And ever comfortable be.
33 Because the Lord does hear the poor
When they to him do cry and pray;
And does not neglect or despise
Those that for him in prison lay.
34 Let the high heavens and spacious earth
Unto Jehovah praises give;
The Ocean deep, and every thing
Which therein does but creep and live.
35 For God will surely Sion save,
And Judah's Cities again build;
That men may them possess, and dwell
In houses plentifully filled.
36 And they that are his servants seed,
Shall be possessors of the same;
And they shall have their dwelling there,
Who do sincerely love his name.
PSALM LXX.
1 O God, from my distress and fear
[Do thou] vouchsafe to set me free;
Make have, O Lord, do thou afford
Thy [speedy] saving help to me.
2 Let them confounded be and shamed,
Who do my death [seek and] conspire;
Confound them all, and turn them back
That do my hurt [in heart] desire.
3 Let shame be their reward: Let them
[Fly and] be turned back by thee,
Who triumphing in my distress,
Do say [in scorn] Aha, to me.
4 Let all that truly seek thy face,
With joy be [ever] glad in thee;
Let all that thy salvation love,
Say still [the Lord] God praised be.
5 But I am poor and weak, O God,
Make have [to me] and do not stay;
Thou art my Savior and help,
Help, Lord, [and] make no [more] delay.
PSALM LXXI.
1 IN thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
Let me no [hurtful] shame befall.
2 In justice save me from my foes,
[By thee] let me escape them all.
Incline thine ear, and save thou me;
3 Be thou my strength [my rock] and fort,
My dwelling, unto which I may
For [help and] refuge still resort.
My safety is thy own Command,
My [rock and] fortress thou will be,
4 From wicked, unjust, cruel men
[Do thou] my God, deliver me.
5 For upon thee, my God alone,
My trust and hope [do all] depend;
Even from my raw and feeble youth,
[It's] thou [that] did me still defend.
6 Thou have sustained me from the womb,
It Is thou that [safely] did take me
From mother's bowels: All my thanks
[And praise] shall always be to thee.
7 A wonder I to many am,
[But] thou art [still] my refuge strong;
8 With thy praise let my mouth be filled,
And [with thy] honor all day long.
9 Cast me not off now when old age
And feebleness [on me] is come;
O do not me forsake at last
When [failing] strength is almost gone.
10 For those that are mine enemies,
Against me speak with [bitter] hate;
And they together counsel take
Who for my life lay [daily] wait.
11 They say, His God, in whom he trusts,
Does [wholly] now this man forsake;
There Is none to save him; now let us
Him persecute and [boldly] take.
12 O God, in time of my distress,
Be not thou far [from me] away,
My God, who art my only help,
[Now] help [thou] me without delay.
13 Confound, consume them all that are
To my soul [causeless] enemies;
Let them be clothed all with shame
Who do my hurt [seek and] devise.
14 But I will wholly trust in thee,
And hope [in thee] continually;
And yet with praises more and more,
Thy [great] name [I] will magnify.
15 Thy righteousness and saving help
My mouth [abroad] shall daily show,
For I of all thy mercies great
The numbers do not [cannot] know.
16 In all my duty I Will go on
In thy strength [only] O my Lord;
And only thy own righteousness
[To men] I Will mention and record.
17 Even from my tender youth, O God,
By thee [it is] I have been taught;
And hitherto I have declared
The wonders [all which] thou have wrought.
18 Now, Lord, forsake me not, when I
Old [feeble] and grey-headed grow;
Till to this age, and all to come,
I shall thy [strength and] power show.
19 High is thy righteousness O God,
And [very] great things thou have done;
Lord, who may be compared with thee?
Surely there is not [any] one.
20 Thou, Lord who troubles great and sore
Did bring [on me] and make me know,
Shall quicken and bring me again
[Even] from [the] depth of earth below.
21 Yea, thou my greatness shall increase,
Thy blessings [on me] shall abound;
And with thy comforts and sweet peace
Thou [safely] wilt enclose me round.
22 I Will use the pleasant Psaltery
To make thy praises [further] known;
And with the Harp I Will sing to thee,
O Israel's [most] Holy One.
23 My lips shall my great joy express,
When [singing] I thy praises sound;
My soul which thou redeemed have,
Shall with her [holy] joy abound.
24 And of thy righteousness my tongue
Shall talk [with joy] all the day long,
For they confounded are with shame
Who sought my hurt [and-death] with wrong.
PSALM LXXII.
1 LOrd, give thy judgments to the King,
[And to] his son thy righteousness:
2 With right he shall thy people judge,
Thy poor with [truth and] uprightness.
3 Then shall the mountains great and firm
Bring to the [neighbour] people peace;
So also shall the little hills
By [pleasant] fruits of righteousness.
4 The poorest people he shall judge,
And [he shall] save the poor and weak;
And those that their oppressors are,
[Cast down] he shall in pieces break.
5 And even from age to age shall they
Reverence thy name, and [fear thy] might*
As long as Sun does shine by day,
Or [as the] Moon does shine by night.
6 He shall come down like fruitful rain
Upon the [grounds of] late mown grass;
And as for watering the dry earth,
Refreshing showers [from heav'n] do pass.
7 Just men shall flourish in his days,
And [all shall] have abundant peace;
And this continued shall be
Until the Moon [to shine] does cease.
8 His great and blessed dominion shall
[Widely] from Sea to Sea extend;
And from the River it shall reach
To the earth's [remote] utmost end.
9 Those that dwell in the wilderness,
[Humbly] bow down before him must;
And they that are his enemies
Must crowch and lick the [very] dust.
10 The Kings of Tarshish and the Isles
To him shall [costly] Presents bring;
The King of Sheba and Seba
[Shall send] their gifts and offering.
11 Yea* all the greatest Kings on earth
Shall [prostrate] down before him fall;
The many nations of the world
Shall [also] humbly serve him all.
12 The weak and needy he will save,
When they [for help] to him do call;
Also the poor and forlorn man,
That has no [humane] help at all.
13 Those that are low and indigent
He shall in [tender] mercy spare,
And (not oppress, but) save the souls
Of them that [weak and] needy are.
14 Their souls from fraud and violence
His [pow'r and] mercy shall redeem;
Their blood he shall not vilify,
But [it as] precious shall esteem.
15 He shall live, and to him shall be
Presented Sheba's [finest] gold;
He shall be prayed, for constantly
And daily be [his praise] extolled,
16 The corn that grows on mountain tops
[Prosp'ring] the reaper's hand shall fill;
The fruit thereof shall wave and shake
Like trees on [woody] Lebanon hill.
His City shall be flourishing,
With [store of] Citizens abound;
Even as the green and plenteous grass
Does flourish on the [fertile] ground.
17 His name shall last: His father's name
By him [his son] continue shall;
And men in him shall blessed be,
All nations [him shall] blessed call.
18 And blessed be his holy name
For ever by all [living] men:
19 And with his glory let the earth
Be [wholly] filled: Amen, Amen.
PSALM LXXIII.
1 YEt surely God is ever good
To [all his] Israel, and to them
Whose hearts are purified and clean,
And that are upright [hearted] men.
2 But yet my weakness was so great
In my [time of] temptation,
That my footsteps had well-nigh slipped,
My [stumbling] feet were almost gone.
3 For at the fools who flourished,
I [grudg'd and] looked enviously,
When as I saw how wicked men
[Do] live in [great] prosperity.
4 For there are no bands in their death,
Their strength shows they are [fully] fed.
5 Other men's troubles they escape,
[And are] not like them chastened.
6 Therefore with pride as with a chain,
[About] they all encompassed are:
And covered with violence,
It as a garment [they do] wear.
7 Their eyes stand out with fat: they have
More than their [very] hearts can wish.
8 They are corrupt; their wicked speech
Oppressing, [lofty] and p^oud is.
9 They set their mouth against the Heavens
In their [prophane] blaspheming talk;
And their reviling lavish tongue
[At large] throughout the earth does walk.
10 And hereupon his people do
Hither [themselves] return again,
And waters of a vessel full
Are [drawn and] wrung out unto them.
11 And thus they say, How can it be
That God all this does [note and] know;
And that there is in the most high
Knowledge of things [done here] below?
12 Behold, these the ungodly are,
Who live in health and [fleshly] ease,
Who prosper in the present world,
In [wealth and] riches do increase.
13 Then surely I have cleans'd my heart,
And washed my hands [from sin] in vain:
14 For all day long have I been plagued,
And thy sharp rod [each day] sustain.
15 But if these tempted sinful thoughts
I [own and] utter with my tongue*
Thy Childrens generation all
I should offend and [greatly] wrong.
16 When this I thought to understand,
It was too [high and] hard for me:
17 Till to God's holy place I went,
Then I their [later] end did see.
18 Surely it is a slippery place
In which these [worldly] men are set,
From whence thy hand does cast them down
[At last] into destruction great.
19 How in a moment suddenly
To [utter] ruin brought are they,
And with just terrors utterly
[From earth] they are consumed away.
20 Even as a transient dream of men,
Who [waking] do from sleep arise;
So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
Their [lifeless] Image wilt despise.
21 Thus grieved was my tempted heart,
And me my [pierced] Reins oppressed.
22 So rude and ignorant was I,
And in thy sight [too like] a beast.
22 Nevertheless continually
[O Lord] with thee I do remain,
And the support of thy right hand
Does me always [help and] sustain.
24 Thou with thy Counsel in thy way
Wilt me direct and [surely] guide,
And unto Glory afterward
[Thou wilt] receive me to abide.
25 Whom have I in the heavens above
[To trust] but thee my God alone?
And whom on earth do I desire
[And seek?] besides thee there is none.
26 My flesh and heart do faint and fail;
But God upholds my [sinking] heart;
God is my Rock of strength, and he
For ever is my [chosen] part.
27 For they shall surely perish all
That are gone far [away] from thee:
They that from thee a whoring go,
Shall all [at last] destroyed be.
28 I know that it is best for me
My God still to draw [and dwell] near;
I trust in thee, Lord God, that I
May all thy [wondrous] works declare.
PSALM LXXIV.
1 O God, why have thou cast us off?
Shall it be [thus for] evermore?
Against thy pasture-sheep why does
Thy [heavy] anger smoke so sore?
2 Think on thine ancient flock, which thou
Have purchased for thy [chosen] lot,
Mount Sion, where thou dwelled'st so long,
[By thee] redeemed, forsake thou not.
3 The desolations long repair,
Arise, and do not [longer] tarry,
All that thy wicked foes have done
Within thy [chosen] sanctuary.
4 Amidst the Congregations
[Cruel] foes roar outragiously;
And their Ensigns they have set up
As signs of [prophane] Victory.
5 This sacred building formerly
Did [skilful] workmen famous make:
6 But now with axes and hammers
The carved work they [down do] break.
7 Thy Temple they have burnt with fire,
[And it] defiled by casting down
Unto the ground the dwelling place
Where thy great Name [and praise] was known.
8 They said, Now let us break them all
With our destroying [potent] hand;
They burn up all the Synagogues
Of God [that were] throughout the Land.
9 Our signs, and all our Prophets cease,
[Now] there is none left us among
That can the end of this foresee,
And tell thy [suffering] flock how long.
10 How long, Lord, shall the enemy
Thee by reproach [scorn and] profane,
And shall the adversaries thus
Always blaspheme thy [holy] name?
11 Pluck out and show forth thy right hand,
Why do thou it [so long] withold?
12 Salvation in the earth was wrought
By God our [glorious] King of old.
13 The flowing Sea divided was
By force of thy [potent]-command;
The heads of Dragons in the floods
Thou [also] brakest by thy hand.
14 The heads thou did in pieces break
Of the Leviathan [so] great;
To them that in the desert dwell
Thou gav'st him [also] to be meat.
15 Fountains out of the cloven rocks
Thou brought forth [for us] plenteously;
The mighty stream of Jordon flood,
[For us] thou caused'st to be dry.
16 Thine, and in thy hand only is
The day, and [so is] the dark night;
It Is thou alone that have prepared
The Sun and its clear [daily] light.
17 Thou all the borders of the earth
Have set by thy [potent] decree:
The Summer and the Winter's course
[Made and] distinguished are by thee.
18 O Lord, let it remembered be
How great [prophane] reproach and shame
Thy foes have dared to cast on thee,
And fools blaspheme thy [holy] name.
19 Thy turtle-dove's soul do not thou
Unto the [wicked] crowd deliver;
The Congregation of thy poor
[O] do not [thou] forget for ever.
20 Unto thy Covenant have respect,
[For now] the earth's dark places be
Full of the habitations
Of [wicked] men's great cruelty.
21 O let not those that are oppressed,
Return [again] with grief and shame;
But let the poor, and men distressed
Give praises to thy [holy] name.
22 Arise, O Lord, plead and maintain
The Cause that is [indeed] thine own;
Remember how thou art reproached,
Even [daily] by the foolish one.
23 Forget not thou the voice of those
That are thy [wicked] enemies;
Their rage and tumults do increase
Who do [as foes] against thee rise.
PSALM LXXV.
1 ACcept, O God, the thanks we give,
To thee we [truly] thankful are;
For that thy name to us is near,
Thy wondrous works [do all] declare.
2 When I the Assembly do receive,
An upright Judge [to all] I Will be.
3 The earth and dwellers are dissolved,
Her [shaken] Pillars rest on me.
4 To the unquiet fools I said,
Deal not [stilt thus] so foolshly,
And to malignant wicked men,
Lift not your [threatning] horn on high.
5 Do not presumptuous horns advance,
Speak not [stiff-neck'd] with haughty mouth;
6 Promotion does not come by chance
From East or West, or [from the] South.
7 But God is judge; he puts down one,
And [he doth] set another up.
8 In the revenging hand of God
Of [blood-red] wine there is a cup.
It Is full of mixture: he pours out
[The same] and makes the wicked all
Wring out the bitter dregs thereof,
[And] they [all] surely drink it shall.
9 But I for ever will declare,
[With Psalms] I Jacob's God will praise:
10 The wicked's horns will I cut off,
But just men's heads [and power] will raise.
PSALM LXXVI.
1 IN Judah God is known: his name
In [his own] Israel is great;
In Salem is his Tabernacle:
[In] Sion [is] his dwelling seat.
3 There he the hurtful arrows brake;
The shield, the sword, and [bloody] war.
4 More glorious than the hills of prey,
And excellent [art thou] by far.
5 The stout and valiant men are spoiled,
[And] by [the] sleep of death they fall;
No men of might could find their hands
[In need] to help themselves withal.
6 When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
Had once against them [spoke and] past,
With them both Horse and Chariot were
Into a [fatal] dead sleep cast.
7 Thou, and thou only, glorious God,
Art he that all should [greatly] fear;
And who can stand before thy face,
If [once but] angry thou appear?
8 Thou did make Judgment heard from heaven,
The [subject] earth was still with fear.
9 When God arose to judge and save
All those that humble [and meek] were.
10 The furious wrath of cruel men
Shall [surely] to thy praise redound;
And the remainder of their wrath
Thou will restrain, and [strictly] bound.
11 Vow to the Lord your God, and pay
[All] you that are [un-] to him near;
And bring your Presents unto him
That ought to be your [chiefest] fear.
12 The greatest Princes spirits all
[Quickly] by him cut off shall be;
And to the Kings that Rule on earth,
[At last] most terrible is he.
PSALM LXXVII.
1 I With my fervent voice did cry
To God in all my [grief and] fear;
Even to my God with mournful voice,
And he to me [in time] gave ear.
2 I sought God in my woeful day,
My [constant] sore did run all night;
My grieved soul did put away
All [offer'd] comfort and delight.
3 I did remember God, but yet
My [grief and] trouble did remain;
My spirit overwhelmed was,
And did [in me] too much complain.
4 Mine eyes, deprived of quiet sleep,
[By night] thou keep still awake;
My trouble is so great and sore,
That I can [very] hardly speak.
5 Thy dealings in the days of old
I then did [mind and] think upon,
What thou in former ancient times
Have for [me and] thy people done.
6 My songs by night I called to mind;
I [search'd and] commun'd with my heart;
My spirit diligently fought
The cause [and cure] of all my smart.
7 For ever will the Lord cast off?
And [will he] gracious be no more?
8 For ever is his mercy gone?
Fails his [good] word [for] evermore?
9 Can it be that his graciousness
[To us] the Lord forgotten has?
And that his tender mercies he
Has shut up now in [endless] wrath?
10 Then said I, These are but the thoughts
Of my [faulty] infirmity;
I Will look back to the years past gone,
And [the right] hand of the most high.
11 I will yet meditate upon
The [former] great works of the Lord
Of those great wonders I will think
Of old, [which are] upon record.
12 Thy great and gracious works I will
My [frequent] meditation make;
And of thy doings to discourse,
My [daily] work and pleasure take.
13 Thy holy way, O God, is in
Thy [sacred] house, and there made known;
There is no other God of might
But our [God, the] Almighty One.
14 Thou only art the God of Power,
Whose doings [all great] wonders are;
And thou among the people all
Thy [strength and] greatness did declare.
15 Thou have with thine Almighty arm
From bonds thy [chosen] people freed,
Redeeming from Captivity
Jacob's and Joseph's [numerous] seed.
16 The waters deep saw thee, O God;
They saw thee, and [backward] they fled,
As if afraid: The depths also
Retired as [by fear] troubled.
17 The clouds their waters poured out,
A [dreadful] sound came from the sky,
And then unto the frightened earth
Abroad thy [hurtful] arrows fly.
18 Thy Thunder's voice was in the heavens,
Thy Lightning [flashed] from the sky,
Lightning the world: The trembling earth
Did quake as [it were] feared thereby.
19 Thy way is in the rolling seas,
The [unseen] paths where thou have gone
In the great waters; and thy steps
To [earthly] mortals are unknown.
20 Thy people thou did keep and lead
Even like a shepherd's flock of sheep;
By Moses and by Aaron's hand
Thou did them guide and [safely] keep.
PSALM LXXVIII.
1 GIve ear, you that my people are,
Unto my Law and word of truth;
Incline your ear to all the words
Which I shall utter with my mouth.
2 In Parables I Will open my mouth,
And utter dark sayings of old,
3 Which we our selves have heard and known,
And which our fathers have us told.
4 We will not hide them from their seed,
But show unto the age to come
God's praises, and his strength, and all
The wondrous works that he has done.
5 A Testimony and a Law
He made and gave to Israel,
Which he our fathers charged, that they
Should after to their children tell.
6 That so the children yet unborn,
And ages coming might them know,
Who should arise, and them likewise
In time unto their children show.
7 That they might not forge^ God's works,
But on him set their hope and heart;
And keep all his commandments,
And never more from them depart.
8 And might not as their ancestors,
Be stubborn and rebellious found;
A race whose heart was not set right,
Whose spirit was not with God found.
9 For then the sons of Ephraim
Being in arms, and carrying bows,
Yet in the day of battle they
Turned their backs upon their foes.
10 They brake God's Covenant, and refused
In his commanded way to go;
11 And did forget his works, and all
The wonders he to them did show.
12 Mavelous things did he perform,
Which all their fathers then beheld;
Both in the land of Egypt first,
And afterward in Zoan field.
13 He did divide for them the sea,
And caused them through it to pass;
And made the waters on each side
To stand; even like a heap it was.
14 With cloud by day, by light of fire
In the dark night he did them guide.
15 In the desert he clave the rock,
And drink as from the deeps supplied.
16 He from the rock brought flowing streams,
And made the waters to run down:
17 Yet in the desert sinning more,
They did provoke the Highest One.
18 For in their heart they tempted God,
And speaking with sinful distrust,
They greedily did call for meat
To satisfy their fleshly lust.
19 Yea, even against the Lord himself
They grudging spoke profanely thus:
Can God here in this wilderness
A furnished table spread for us?
20 Indeed he smote the rock, and thence
There flowed streams of waters great;
And can he give his people bread,
And provide flesh for them to eat?
21 This the Lord heard, and then his wrath
Did kindle a consuming flame,
Which against Jacob did come up,
His anger against Israel came.
22 Because they did not God believe,
Nor trust in his salvation had.
23 Though clouds above he did command,
And he heavens doors had open made;
24 And rained down Manna upon them,
And gave them corn from heaven to eat.
25 So that Man did eat Angels food,
And to the full he gave them meat.
26 From heaven he made the East Wind blow,
Brought the South Wind by his command:
27 He rained flesh on them as dust,
And feathered fowl as the sea-sand.
28 Even in their Camp, and round about
Their habitation it did fall;
29 So they did eat and were well filled,
Their own desire he gave them all.
30 They were not from their lusts estranged,
The meat yet in their mouths, even then
31 God's wrath the fattest of them slew,
And smote down Israel's choicest men.
32 Yet for all this they sinned still,
Believed not for his wonders wrought;
33 Their days he then consumed in vain,
Their years in trouble on them brought.
34 But earnestly they sought to him
When he them slew, and used his rod;
And then they seemed to return,
Enquiring early after God.
35 Then they remembered that the Lord
Was their strong Rock that did them save;
And their Redeemer the high God,
Who unto them deliverance gave.
36 Yet with their mouth they flattered him,
And spoke all this deceitfully;
And they unto the God of truth
With their unfaithful tongues did lie.
37 For all this while their hearts within
Were not found upright and sincere;
Nor in his holy Covenant
Unchangeable and steadfast were.
38 But full of pity, he forgave
Their sin, and did not them destroy;
And did not stir up all his wrath,
But often turned it away.
39 For he remembered that they were
But flesh, whose time is short and vain,
And like a wind, which passing by,
Is gone, and comes not again.
They often in the desert him provoked*
Displeased with what they had done.
41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
Limiting Israel's Holy One.
42 And they remembered not his hand,
Nor yet the former days, when he
From their oppressing enemy
Had saved them, and set them free.
43 How he in Egypt wrought his signs,
And wonders great in Zoan field;
44 And turned their Rivers into blood,
And floods, that they no drink could yield.
45 Among them he sent diverse sorts
Of flies, which did them much annoy,
And did devour their fruits; and frogs
He sent to vex them, and destroy.
46 Their increase by the caterpiller;
Their labor was by locusts lost:
47 Their vines he did destroy with hail,
And their Sycamore trees with frost.
48 He gave their cattle to the hail,
Their flocks by thunderbolts were spent;
49 Fierce wrath and trouble cast on them
By evil Angels to them sent.
50 He to his anger did make way,
And spared not their souls from death,
But to the wasting Pestilence
He did give up their vital breath.
51 All Egypt's firstborn he smote down,
And in Ham's land their chiefest strength:
52 He made them let his people go,
Like sheep he led them out at length.
He in the desert did them guide,
53 And like a flock them safely led,
So that they were secured from fear,
But their foes the sea covered.
54 He brought them to the borders, where
His sanctuary now does stand;
Even to the sacred mountain, which
He purchased with his right hand.
55 Before them cast the heathen out,
Their land to them he did divide,
And made the tribes of Israel
In their tents to dwell and abide.
56 Yet did they tempt the most high God,
Him by their sin provoked they,
And did not his commandments
Unfeignedly keep and obey.
57 But like their fathers turned back,
And dealt with God unfaithfully;
Like a deceitful warping bow,
Which turned aside, does shoot awry.
58 They to displeasure him provoked*
With Altars set in places high;
And with their graven Images
They moved him to jealousy.
59 When God heard this he was displeased,
And abhorred Israel greatly then;
60 So that he Shilo's place forsook,
The tent he placed among men.
61 His peoples strength he captive gave;
His glory to the enemies hand.
62 He gave his people to the sword,
And was wroth with his chosen land.
63 The fire consumed their young men,
And their maidens no marriage had.
64 Their Priests also fell by the sword,
Their wives no lamentation made.
65 But then the Lord arose like one
That does from silent sleep awake;
And like a Giant, that by wine
Exhilerate a shout does make.
66 And on his enemies hinder parts
He made his heavy strokes to fall,
And so upon them all he cast
Reproach and shame perpetual.
67 Moreover Joseph's Tabernacle,
And Ephraim's Tribe he did refuse.
68 But the Mount Sion, which he loved,
And Judah's Ruling Tribe did choose.
69 His Sanctuary there he built,
Like to a Palace fair and high;
And like the earth which his hand has
Founded for perpetuity.
70 His servant David he did choose,
And him his peoples Ruler make;
And from the governing of sheep
To dignity he did him take.
71 From following Ewes great with young*
He called and brought him up to feed
Israel his own inheritance,
His servant Jacob's chosen seed.
72 So after the integrity
Of his heart they by him were fed;
And by his hands great skilfulness
By him they were well governed.
PSALM LXXIX.
1 O God, the heathen do invade
Thy heritage, [and now] by them
Thy Temple is defiled: On heaps
They lay [thy dear] Jerusalem.
2 The bodies of thy servants they
[Cast forth] have given to be meat
For ravenous fowls, and thy Saints flesh
Unto the beasts [of the earth] to eat.
3 Their blood about Jerusalem
Like [common] water they have shed,
And there was none to bury them,
When they [by them] were cast out dead.
4 To all our neighbors that hear this,
A [jeast and] mere reproach are we;
A s^orn and mocking-stock to those
That [dwelling] round about us be.
5 How long, Lord, (O not evermore)
Shall this thine anger [towards us] last?
Shall thy provoked jealousy
Like fire thus always [burn and] wast?
6 Upon the heathen pour thy wrath,
That have not known thee [and thy] fame;
And on the Kingdoms which have not
Adored thy [great and] holy name.
7 For these are they that Jacob have
[Slain and] devoured cruelly;
And made his famous dewlling place
As ruinous [and wast] to lie.
8 O charge not on us former sins,
Thy tender [pardoning] mercies show;
Let them prevent us speedily,
For we are now brought [very] low.
9 For thy name's glory help us, Lord,
Who [art and] have our Savior bin;
For thy names-sake deliver us,
And purge away our [guilt and] sin.
10 Why say the heathen, Where Is their God?
Let him to them be [better] known;
When these that shed thy servants blood
Are in our sight [judg'd and] overthrown,
11 O let the prisoners sighs ascend
Before thy [righteous] sight on high;
Preserve those by thy sovereign power,
That are [by men] designed to dye.
12 And to our neighbors let seven fold
[Reward] in Judgment rendered be;
Even that reproach wherewith they have
[Falsly] O God, reproached thee.
13 So we thy folk and pasture-sheep
Will give thee [joyful] thanks always;
And to all ages yet to come
We will show forth thy [glorious] praise.
PSALM LXXX.
1 O Israel's shepherd, hear, who do
Like a flock Joseph [feed and] guide;
Shine forth O thou that do between
The [sacred] Cherubims abide.
2 In Ephraim's and Benjamin's,
And [also] in Manasseh's sight,
For our speedy salvation come,
Stir up [and shew] thy saving might.
3 Turn us again, and bring us home,
And upon us [do thou] vouchsafe,
O God, to make thy face to shine,
And then we shall [again] be safe.
4 Lord God of Hosts, how long will thou
Thus in thy [burning] anger smoke?
Against thy peoples humble prayer
Who do thy [sacred] Name invoke?
5 Instead of bread, tears are their food,
[Which now] thou give them to eat;
And tears thou give them to drink,
And that in measure [very] great.
6 Thou make us a strife unto
Our [envious] neighbors round about;
Our enemies among themselves
At us do [daily] laugh and flout.
7 Turn us again, O Lord of Hosts,
And upon us [do thou] vouchsafe
To make thy pleased face to shine,
And then we shall [again] be safe.
8 Thou have a Vine from Egypt brought
By thy outstretched [mighty] hand;
And thou the heathen did cast out,
And plant it in their [promis'd] land.
9 Before it thou prepared'st room,
And made it [therein] take deep root,
Till it did spread and multiply,
And [so did] fill the land throughout.
10 Through its increase the hills about
Were [cloath'd and] covered with its shade,
And like the lofty Cedar trees,
Her [spreading] branches were displayed.
11 And she as far as to the sea
Her [prosperous] fruitful boughs did send;
And to the bounding river's side
Her [out-spread] branches did extend.
12 Why have thou then her fencing hedge
Thus [greatly] broken and cast down,
So that all passengers her fruit
Do pluck [and take] even as their own.
13 It rooted up and wasted is
By the [unclean] boar of the wood*
And all the wild beasts of the field
Devour it as their [proper] food.
14 O God of Hosts, we thee beseech,
[With help] return yet unto thine;
With mercy look from heaven, behold
And visit this thy [wasted] Vine.
15 The Vineyard which enclosed by thee,
Thy right hand [set and] planted young,
And that chief branch which for thy self
[In it] thou made so high and strong.
16 It is as fuel now cut down,
And burnt up by the [raging] fire;
They perish when thy countenance
Rebukes them with [burning] ire.
17 Let thy defending hand be on
The [chosen] man of thy right hand;
The son of man, whom for thy self
Thou made strong to [Rule and] stand.
18 So will we not go back from thee,
Nor from our [promis'd duty] fall;
Quicken and raise us up, and we
Upon thy Name will [trust and] call.
19 Turn us again, Lord God of Hosts,
And upon us [do thou] vouchsafe
To make thy pleased face to shine,
And then we shall be [ever] safe.
PSALM LXXXI.
1 UNto the glorious God, our strength,
Sing all [aloud] with raised voice;
And unto Jacob's mighty God,
[In praise] make all a joyful noise.
2 Take ye a Psalm, the Timbrel bring
To help our [joyful] melody;
The pleasant Harp, and every string
We'll use with [the sweet] Psaltery.
3 In the new Moon the Trumpet blow,
[The time] which God, whom we obey,
Appointed us this use to keep,
[Even] on our solemn feast- [ing] day.
4 A statute this for Israel was,
A Law which [Jacob's] God had sent;
5 To Joseph made a testimony,
When he from Egypt [saved] went.
He heard a speech not understood,
6 The [heavy] burdens he did bear
I from his shoulders took, his hands
From [making] pots delivered were.
7 Thou call'dst in fear: I saved thee,
And from the [secret] thundering sky
I answered; and at Meribah
Thy [wavering] trust in me did try.
8 Hear, O my people, and my mind
I Will [shew and] testify to thee;
O Israel, if thou will obey,
And [truly] hearken unto me.
9 Then know that no strange God at all,
In thee I [ever] will allow;
Nor shall thou to any strange God
By way of worship [kneel and] bow.
10 For I the Lord thy God am he
Who thee from Egypt's [bondage] led,
Open thy mouth wide, and thou shall
[By me] be plentifully fed.
11 But this my people would not hear
This statute which [to them] I spoke;
And Israel would have none of me,
But [this] my [great] Commandment brake.
12 So to their hardened hearts and lusts
I left them, and [so far] forsook;
And in their own wrong way they walked,
And their own [foolish] counsel took.
13 O that my people had received
My [Word and] Law which I thus made,
And Israel had walked in
My [righteous] Laws, and me obeyed.
14 I should then quickly have subdued
[To them] their feared enemies,
And turned my hand against all those
That did [as foes] against them rise.
15 The haters of the Lord to him
Should have submission [made or] feigned;
But as for them, their prosperous time
Should [surely] ever have remained.
16 He should have fed them with the fat,
And [finest] flower of the Wheat;
And made the Rock with honey flow,
That thou [thereof] thy fill might eat.
PSALM LXXXII.
1 IN the Assembly of the great'st
The Lord [o're all] himself does stand
As Judge among those called Gods,
The [mortal] Rulers of the land.
2 How long will ye unjustly judge,
And favor [unjust] wicked men?
Accepting their persons (to show
That you [your selves] are like to them.)
3 Defend the poor and fatherless,
To [all the] poor oppressed do right:
4 The poor and needy ones set free,
Rid them from bad men's [hand and] might.
5 They know not, nor will understand;
In [wilful] darkness they walk on:
All the foundations of the earth
Are moved and [almost] overthrown.
6 I called you Gods for ruling power,
[Honour'd] sons of the Highest all;
7 But you shall die like men, and like
To other [mortal] Princes fall.
8 Arise, O Lord, and judge the earth,
And bring [unjust] oppressors down,
For thou all nations shall possess,
And rule them [justly] as thine own.
PSALM LXXXIII.
1 LOrd, do not silence keep,
Nor longer hold thy peace;
Seem not these doings to neglect,
And bear with wickedness.
2 For now thine enemies
Do rage tumultuously;
And they that hate thee are set up,
And lift their heads on high.
3 They crafty Counsel take
Against thy people all;
And against thine own hidden ones,
They plot and seek their fall.
4 They say, Let Us cut them off,
That they no Nation be,
And that the name of Israel come
No more in memory.
5 Together they consult
With one consenting hate;
Even against thee thy peoples strength
They are confederate.
6 Edom and Ishmaelites,
Moab and Hagarens;
7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
Tire, and the Philistines.
8 Assure is with them joined,
Lot's Children to assist;
9 Do them as the Midianites,
And as to Sisera's host.
And as at Kison brook,
To Jabin, who did fall
10 At Endor, who became as dung
To soil the earth withal.
11 Make thou their Nobles all
Like Oreb and Zeeb;
Let their Princes as Zeba be,
And as Zalmunna, dead.
12 Who said, Let Us to our selves
The houses of God take:
13 My God, like rolling wheels or chaff
Before the wind them make.
14 As fire burns wood, and flame
The mountains sets on fire,
15 Chase and affright them with the storms
And tempests of thine ire.
16 With shame their faces fill,
That they may seek thy name:
17 Let them confounded be, and vexed,
And perish in their shame.
18 That men may know that thou,
Whom we Jehovah call,
In all the earth art supreme Lord,
And highest over all.
PSALM LXXXIV.
1 HOw lovely is thy dewlling place,
O Lord of Hosts, to me!
The tabernacles of thy grace,
How pleasant, Lord, they be!
2 My thirsty soul does long and faint
The Courts of God to see;
My heart, and even my flesh cry out,
O living God, for thee.
3 The sparrow has found out a house,
The swallow found a nest,
Where she may lay her young, and where
Her self and they may rest.
Even near thy holy Altars they
May make their safe abode;
And why not I, seeing thou art
My King and only God?
4 Blessed are they in thy house that dwell,
They always give thee praise.
5 Blessed is he whose strength's in thee,
In whose heart are thy ways.
6 Who passing as through Bala's vale,
Make it a place of wells,
And the descending plenteous rain
The pools with water fills.
7 Unwearied they forward go,
Marching from strength to strength,
Till all in Sion do appear
Before the Lord at length.
8 Lord God of Hosts, my prayer hear,
O Jacob's God give ear:
9 O God, our shield, look on the face
Of thine anointed dear.
10 Because one day within thy house
Is better to abide,
Than in another place to stay
A thousand days beside.
Much rather would I keep a door
In the house of my God,
Than in the tents of wickedness
To take up mine abode.
11 For the Lord God, our Sun and Shield,
Will grace and glory give,
And no good thing from them withold
Who uprightly do live.
12 O thou that art the Lord of Hosts,
That man is surely blessed,
Who by a steadfast confidence
On thee alone does rest.
PSALM LXXXV.
1 THou have been favorable,
O Lord, unto thy land;
And Israel's sad Captivity
Thou brought back by thy hand.
2 Thy people thou forgav'st
The guilt that they were in;
And by thy free and plenteous grace
Did cover all their sin.
3 Thy wrath thou took'st away,
And did to mercy turn;
Even from thine anger terrible,
That did against us burn.
4 O God, our Savior,
Turn us unto thy peace,
And cause thine anger that is gone forth
Against us, for to cease.
5 Shall thy displeasure last
Against us without end?
And to all generations
Will thou thy wrath extend?
6 Will thou not us restore,
And quicken us, that we
Who are thy people, evermore
In thee may joyful be?
7 Show us thy mercy, Lord,
Which may thy flock relieve;
And thy salvation unto us
In season freely give.
8 I Will hear what God to us
Will speak; It will be peace
To all his Saints; But let not them
Return to foolishness.
9 Surely to all those who
In fear of God do stand,
His help is nigh, that Glory may
Dwell always in our land.
10 Mercy and truth shall meet,
And no more parted be;
And Peace with Righteousness shall greet,
And blessedly agree.
11 Truth here, even on this earth,
Shall spring and prosper well;
And righteousness from heaven descend,
And here among us dwell.
12 The Lord shall give what is good,
Our land shall yield increase;
13 Justice, to set us in his way,
Shall go before his face.
PSALM LXXXVI.
1 BOw down thine ear, O Lord,
Hear me, for I am poor
2 And in distress: Yet I am thine,
Preserve my soul therefore.
My God, thy servant save,
Who does on thee rely;
3 Be merciful to me, O Lord,
Who daily to thee cry.
4 Rejoice thy servant's soul,
For unto thee, O Lord,
Do I lift up my soul, in hope
That thou will help afford.
5 For thou, O Lord, art good,
And ready to forgive:
And rich in mercy; and all those
That seek thee, do relieve.
6 Give ear to my request,
My praying voice attend;
7 I Will call on thee when troubles come,
For thou will answer send.
8 Among the Gods, O Lord,
None may with thee compare;
Neither among the works they do,
Any like thy works are.
9 All nations made by thee,
Shall come and reverently
Worship before thee, our great God,
And thy name magnify.
10 For thou art high and great,
And wondrous things have done;
Besides thee there is no other God,
For thou art God alone.
11 Teach me thy truth and way,
And I Will walk in the same;
Unite my heart, Lord, unto thee,
To fear thy holy name.
12 My God, with all my heart
To thee will I give praise,
And I the glory will ascribe
Unto thy name always.
13 For thy mercy to me
In greatness does excel;
Thou have delivered my soul
Both from the Grave and Hell.
14 The proud against me rise,
Terrible men are met
In troops, that seek my life; but thee
Before them have not set.
15 But full of pity, Lord,
And gracious thou art found;
Thou art long-suffering, and in truth
And mercy do abound.
16 O turn thee unto me,
And mercy on me have;
Strengthen thy servant, and the Son
Of thine own handmaid save.
17 Show me some sign for good,
That all my foes may see,
And be ashamed, because thou, Lord,
Do help and comfort me.
PSALM LXXXVII.
1 UPon the sacred hills
He his foundation sets:
2 More than all Jacob's dwellings else
God loves Sion gates.
3 Great things are said of thee,
O City of the Lord.
4 Rahab's and Babel's case to those
That know me I Will record.
It Is said of famous Tire,
And land of Palestine;
And of the Ethiopian land,
This man was born therein.
5 Of Sion't shall be said,
This man, and that man there
Was born; and he that highest is,
Himself shall stablish her.
6 When God recites their names,
Who his own people are;
To their great honor he shall count,
That this man was born there.
7 Singers, and those that play
On music, there shall be;
Yea, all my springs of holy peace
And comfort, are in thee.
PSALM LXXXVIII.
1 O God, who art my hope and help,
To thee I cried night and day.
2 Let my cries have access to thee,
Incline thine ear when I do pray.
3 My soul with troubles does abound,
My life draws nigh unto the grave.
4 Like one that to be buried goes,
I am as those that no strength have.
5 As a companion of the dead,
Like those that slain in grave do lie;
Whom thou have cut off by thy hand,
And do put out their memory.
6 Thou lay'st me in the lowest pit,
And as in deep and darksom caves;
7 Thy wrath lies hard on me, and thou
Afflictest me with all thy waves.
8 My friends thou have put far from me,
To them as burdensome I grow;
In sorrows I am so shut up,
That forth from thence I cannot go.
9 My eye through my affliction mourns,
I call on thee from day to day;
To thee, O Lord, I have stretched out
My craving hands; to thee I pray.
10 Will thou show wonders to the dead?
Shall the dead rise and praise thee here?
11 Is thy love praised in the grave?
Does death thy faithfulness declare?
12 Are thy great works known in the dark?
Or is thy truth and righteousness
Remembered and mentioned in
The land of deep forgetfulness?
13 But unto thee, O Lord, I cry,
My morning's prayer shall thee prevent.
14 Lord why do thou cast off my soul?
Why is thy face against me bent?
15 Even from my early youth I was
Afflicted, and as near to die;
While I thy terrors do endure
I almost as distracted lie.
16 Thy fierce wrath goes over me,
Thy terrors kill and cast me out:
17 Like floods they daily on me come,
Gather and compass me about.
18 My dearest friends that did me love,
Thou have removed far from me;
Those that my old acquaintance were
Into the dark are cast by thee.
PSALM LXXXIX.
1 OF the great mercies of the Lord
I will perpetually sing;
The notice of thy faithfulness
To ages all my mouth shall bring.
2 For I have said that mercy shall
Be built for ever to endure;
And in the very heavens thou will
Thy faithfulness establish sure.
3 I to my chosen servant have
My self by my own Covenant tied;
Even unto David, and to him
By oath I have it ratified.
4 That I thy seed establish will,
That it for evermore endure;
And to all generations
Thy throne will build and settle sure.
5 The praises of thy wonders, Lord,
The heavens shall gloriously express;
The Congregations of thy Saints
Shall praise thy truth and faithfulness.
6 For in the heavens themselves who may
With thee, the only Lord, compare?
Who may be liken'd to the Lord,
Of all their sons that mighty are?
7 God greatly to be feared is
The assemblies of the Saints throughout;
And to be had in reverence
Of all that him attend about.
8 O thou that art the Lord of Hosts,
What Lord like thee with strength is crowned?
Who Is like to thee in faithfulness,
Which does thy Throne encompass round?
9 When as the swelling Sea does rage,
Thou over it do rule and reign;
And when the waves thereof arise,
Thou quickly stillest them again.
10 Rahab in pieces thou did break,
As one that slain on the earth lies;
And with thy own Almighty arm
Thou scattered have thine enemies.
11 The heaven and earth, the world is thine,
Their fullness all; Thou foundest them.
12 Thou made the North and South, Tabor
And Hermon glory in thy name.
13 Strong is thine arm, high thy right hand;
14 Justice and Judgment are the place
Where thy Throne dwells; Mercy and Truth
Shall ever go before thy face.
15 That people truly blessed is,
The joyful sound and call that know;
In the light of thy countenance,
O Lord, they onward still shall go.
16 In thy great name that people shall
Rejoice all day exceedingly;
And in thy perfect righteousness
Shall they exalted be on high.
17 Thou art the glory of their strength,
Thy love does exaltation bring.
18 Thou, Lord, alone art our defense,
And Israel's Holy One, our King.
19 In vision to thy Holy One,
Thou said, I have laid help upon
One that is strong; and out of all
I did exalt a chosen one.
20 David my servant I have found,
With holy Oil did him anoint;
21 With whom my hand shall stablish'd be,
My arm shall strength to him appoint.
22 His foes shall not exact on him;
Wicked men shall not him afflict:
23 His foes before him I Will beat down,
His haters I Will with plagues correct.
24 My mercy and my faithfulness
Shall keep him, and be with him still;
And while he trusts in my name,
His horn of Power exalt I will.
25 I Will set his hand upon the sea,
And on the rivers his right hand:
26 He Will cry, My Father, and my God;
The Rock on which my help does stand.
27 Also I Will make him my firstborn,
Higher than Kings of any land;
28 Mercy I Will ever keep for him,
With him my Covenant fast shall stand.
29 His seed I Will make still to endure;
And as the days of heaven his Throne.
30 If his Children my Law forsake,
My Judgments do not keep and own.
31 If they my statutes do profane,
And keep not my Commandments;
32 Their sins I Will visit with the rod,
And their misdeeds with chastisements.
33 Yet I Will not take from him my love,
Nor will my faithful promise break;
34 My Covenant I Will not violate,
Nor alter what of him I spoke.
35 Once by my Holiness I swear,
And unto David will not lie;
36 His seed and throne shall as the Sun
Before me last perpetually.
37 And it shall be established
For ever, and like to the Moon,
Which as a witness in the heavens
My steady faithfulness makes known.
38 But now thou do him so forsake,
As if cast down, thou do him loath;
And with this thine anointed one
Thou dealest as in heavy wrath.
39 Thy servant's Covenant have made void,
And on the ground profaned his Crown;
40 His strong holds thou to ruin brought,
And have broke all his hedges down.
41 All spoil him that pass by the way,
To neighbors a reproach is he;
42 And thou have set up their right hand
That his great adversaries be.
Thou have made all his foes rejoice,
43 The edge of his sword in his hand
Thou turned have; and have not him
Made able in the fight to stand.
44 His glory thou have made to cease,
His Throne down to the ground have cast;
45 His days of youth have shortened,
And him with shame thou covered have.
46 How long, Lord, shall it ever be
That thou will hide thy self in ire?
And shall thy wrath unreconcil'd
Consume and burn us up as fire?
47 Remember how short is the time
That I must here on earth remain;
Wherefore have thou all mortal men
Made to live here as merely vain?
48 What man is he that lives here,
And fatal Death shall never see?
And who is he that from the grave
Can his own life save and set free?
49 The former loving kindnesses
Which thou, O Lord, to him did bear,
Where are they now? Which in thy truth
Thou unto David then did swear?
50 Remember, Lord, the great reproach
Which we thy servants daily bear;
How in my bosom I receive
The scorn of them that mighty are.
51 The scorn wherewith thine enemies
Have thee reproached, Lord, think upon;
Even that wherewith they have reproached
The steps of thine anointed One.
52 Blessed and magnified be
For evermore our glorious Lord;
Let all thy Church resound with me
Amen, Amen, with one accord.
PSALM XC.
1 LOrd, thou have been our dewlling place
In all the Changes [we have] past;
Unto thy wandering people thou
A [certain] guide and safety wast.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth,
And thou the [earth and] world did frame,
In and to all Eternity
Thou art [true] God, [and] still the same.
3 Thou do dissolve this frame of MAN,
By wasting age, and [chastning] pain;
And say unto them, Now return,
You [mortal] sons of men again.
4 The long time of a thousand years
Appears in thy [boundless] sight;
As yesterday when it is past,
And as a [hasty] watch by night.
5 From whence thou carryest them away
As things a [speedy] torrent does:
They are asleep; and like the grass
[Which is] but of one morning's growth.
6 In that morning it flourishes;
It quickly grows up [and is] green;
And in the evening it is cut down,
[And dead] and withered is seen.
7 For by thine anger for our sin
We are [from earth] consumed and spent;
In grief and trouble pass our days,
Through thy [severe] just punishment.
8 For thou before thy dreadful face
Sett'st our [guilt and] iniquities;
Our secret sins are opened all
In [clearest] light before thine eyes.
9 Thus while thy righteous wrath we bear,
Our days do pass [away] and fail;
The years of this vain life we spend
As a short [transient] thought or tale.
10 Our age is threescore years and ten,
If [by strength] lengthened to fourscore,
That strength our labor does prolong,
And [doth but] make our sorrows more.
11 It Is soon cut off, and we are gone,
Who knows [aright] thy powerful wrath?
Thy anger we fear not in vain,
All sin some [penal] sorrow has.
12 Lord teach us this most needful work,
[Aright] to number all our days;
That we to wisdom may apply
Our hearts without [secure] delays.
13 How long, Lord, shall we feel thy wrath?
[Return] revive us by thy grace;
Let it repent thee of our pains,
[And] pity thy [poor] servants case.
14 O let thy early mercy us
[Comfort] restore and satisfy,
That we may serve thee all our days
With gladness, and with [holy] joy.
15 According to the days wherein
[Thy sharp] affliction we have had;
As years of sorrow we have seen,
Let mercy [longer] make us glad.
16 O let thy work and power be shown
Unto thy [humbled] servants now;
And let their Children by those works
Thy [saving] grace and glory know.
17 Adorn us with the beauty of
The [shining] glory of thy face;
Let our just works established be,
[Bless and] maintain them by thy grace.
PSALM XCI.
1 THe man that in the secret place
Of the most High [in heart] does dwell,
He under the Almighty's shade
Shall lodge [abide] and prosper well.
2 I of the Lord will boast and say,
Thou art my [Refuge] Rock and Tower;
(Whoever threats, whatever comes)
I Will [boldly] trust his Love and Power.
3 Surely he will deliver thee
From the entrapping [Fowler's] snare;
And he will safely thee preserve
From [noysome] Pestilential air.
4 His wings of love shall cover thee,
There thou art safe; there [boldly] trust
He will thy shield and buckler be,
His Word is true and [he is] just.
5 Though the night's darkness be the time
Of [fears and] dangers, yet you may
Rest quietly without such fears,
And from [your foes] assaults by day.
6 Though Plagues and many sudden harms
[Do oft] surprise men in the night,
Trust God, and fear them not; Nor those
Which do destroy in [Noon-day] light.
7 A thousand at thy side shall fall,
[And ten] thousands at thy right hand,
When nigh thee there it shall not come,
But God shall [safely] thee defend.
8 Only this dreadful spectacle,
[When] that day [comes] thine eyes shall see
How those who now live wickedly,
Shall then [by God] rewarded be.
9 Because the blessed God most high,
[Who is] my refuge, thou have made
The dwelling where thy faithful soul
Its [daily] conversation had.
10 Therefore no great and deadly harm,
No [plotted] ill shall thee befall;
Nor any penal hurtful plague
Come nigh thy [guarded] dwelling shall.
11 Of thee he will give his Angels charge,
[That] whether thou [dost] wake or sleep;
In all thy good and righteous ways
They shall thee guard and [safely] keep.
12 As tender nurses bear weak babes,
These [lead and] bear thee in their arms;
Lest feeble frailty cause thy fall,
They keep thee from all [deadly] harms.
13 The Lions fierce, the poysnous Asp
Thy feet shall [safely] trample on;
The Lions whelps, the Dragons rage,
By [conquering] grace thou shall tread down.
14 Because on me he set his love,
I Will save him from all [deadly] woe;
I Will him advance, because my name
With [fear and] honor he did know.
15 He upon this my name shall call
In all his [troubles] wants and fear;
His moans and suit I Will not despise,
His [earnest] prayer I will hear.
Though here of trouble he partake,
[In it] I will be with him still;
I Will him deliver out of all,
And [truest] honor give him will.
16 And with sufficient length of days
I Will grant his [sober] just request;
And my salvation he shall see
[Here and] in everlasting rest.
PSALM XCII. A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day.
1 TO render thanks to God, it is
A good and [very] pleasant thing;
And to thy name, O thou most high,
[Joyntly] thy praises for to sing.
2 Thy loving kindness to show forth
[Early] in the first morning's light;
And to declare thy faithfulness
With [evening] songs, even in the night.
3 On a ten-stringed instrument,
And on the [pleasant] Psaltery;
And on the sweet and warbling Harp,
With solemn [sound and] melody.
For thou, Lord, by thy wondrous works
Have made thy servant's [heart most] glad;
And I will triumph in the works
Which thy own hand has [done and] made.
5 How great, O Lord, are all thy works?
And [very] deep thy counsels be:
6 Brutish men understand not this;
[Carnal] fools cannot these things see.
7 That when the wicked spring as grass,
And [a while] sinners flourish all;
It is that they for ever may
Into [deserv'd] destruction fall.
8 But thou, O Lord, who do them judge,
In glory do [the same] remain;
And thou on high in Majesty
[O're all] for evermore do reign.
9 For lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
Thy [wicked] enemies perish shall;
The workers of iniquity
[By thee] shall be dispersed all.
10 But like the horns of Unicorns
My head [and power] will thou exalt;
And me thy chosen one anoint
With [fresh and] holy Oil thou shall.
11 Mine eyes also shall see the fall
Of all my [wicked] enemies;
Mine ears shall hear of their defeat,
Who [falsly] did against me rise.
12 As Palm Trees flourish full of fruit,
The just shall [likewise] flourish so;
Like the Cedars of Lebanon
They shall increase and [prosperous] grow.
13 Those who in God's most holy house
Are [firmly] planted by his grace,
Shall flourish in the Courts of God,
By the beams of his [pleased] face.
14 Their old age shall not fruitless be,
But [good and] plenteous fruit shall bring;
When flesh decays they shall be fat,
And [ever] green and flourishing.
15 To show us that our faithful Lord,
Who my sure rock [and hope] has bin,
Is upright; and unrighteousness
None is, or [ever] was in him.
PSALM XCIII.
1 THe Lord does reign in Majesty,
Clothed [about] with glorious light;
The Lord has clothed and girt himself
With [strength and] unresisted might.
2 The world is so established,
That none [but God] can it remove;
From everlasting thou art God,
Thy Throne is [firmly] fixed above.
3 The floods, O Lord, have lifted up,
The [raging] floods lift up their voice:
The floods do still lift up their waves,
And make a [great and] dreadful noise.
4 The Lord on high more mighty is
Than all these waters [hideous] noise;
He can rebuke and quiet all
The Ocean's roaring [frightful] voice.
5 Thy testimonies are most sure;
And [devout] holiness always
Becomes thy house, and all that there
Assemble for thy [holy] praise.
PSALM XCIV.
1 RIghteous Lord God, to whom alone
[Final] revenging does belong;
Show men that Justice is thy work,
And [surely] God avengeth wrong.
2 Lift up thy self, thou Judge of all,
The proud do thou [check and] reward:
3 How long shall wicked men triumph,
[Even they] that do not God regard?
4 Shall they still speak false and hard things,
And [their tongues] utter cruelty?
How low shall they triumph and boast,
Who [plot and] work iniquity?
5 Thy people they in pieces break;
Thy heritage [do they] afflict.
6 Widows, strangers, and fatherless,
They murder, or [by wrong] deject.
7 Yet say they, God does not this see;
Nor [doth he] it regard and know.
8 Ye brutish people understand,
[Ye fools] when will ye wiser grow?
9 Shall he not hear who made the ear?
Nor [all things] see, that formed the eye?
10 He that the heathen does chastise,
Shall [judge and] correct righteously.
He that all knowledge teaches man,
What can [from him] concealed be?
11 The Lord knows all the thoughts of man,
[He sees] that they are vanity.
12 O blessed is the man who is
[In love] chastis'd by thee, O Lord:
And thou effectually do teach
[Withal] out of thy holy Word.
13 That thou may give him rest from times
Of [sad and] sharp adversity;
Until the pit be dig'd for them
That [still do] work iniquity.
14 God who corrects, will not cast off
[His flock,] nor his sure Covenant break;
Nor his beloved inheritance
Will [ever] utterly forsake.
15 Judgment shall Righteousness restore,
And Truth [^^ earth] return again;
And all shall foll^w after it
Who upright [hearted] do remain.
16 Who will rise up for me against
The wicked doer's [cruel] band?
The workers of iniquity,
Who will against them [for me] stand?
17 Unless the Lord had been my help,
I had dwelt [quickly] in the grave:
18 But wh^^ I said, My foot does slip,
[O Lord] my mercy did me save.
19 And in the crowd and multitude
Of [troubling] thoughts that in me roll,
Within me thy sweet comforts dwell,
And do delight my [troubled] soul.
20 Shall the Throne of iniquity
Have [any] fellowship with thee?
Which frames mischief by a Law,
And pleads its own [unjust] decree.
21 They all conspire against the lives
Of [the most] righteous men and good;
And by their Law ujustly do
Condemn [and shed] the guiltless blood.
22 But God alone against them all
Is my [secure] defense and stay;
The Lord my God my refuge is,
My rock of strength [and trust] always.
23 The Lord our God shall bring on them
Their own [works of] iniquity;
In their own sin he will cut them off:
[The Lord] he will do it certainly.
PSALM XCV.
1 O Come let us unto the Lord
Lift up [aloud] our singing voice;
And to our Rock and Savior
Make a triumphant [joyful] noise.
2 Before his presence let us all
Appear with [joy and] thankfulness;
And with the joyful noise of Psalms
The praise of [our great] God express.
3 Great is the Lord, a mighty King,
Above all [pow'rs and] Gods alone;
4 The earth's great depths are in his hands,
The mountains strength [is all] his own.
5 The Sea and all therein is his;
[It's] he [that] did it make and form:
The dry land also he did make,
[And it] replenish and adorn.
6 O come and let us worship him,
And to him [let us] bow down all;
And on our knees before the Lord
Our maker let us [humbly] fall.
7 He only is our God, and we
[The] sheep of his [own] pasture are;
The flock which his own hand does lead,
Of whom he takes [special] care.
8 To day, if you will hear his voice,
Then [longer] harden not your hearts;
As you did tempt and strive with God,
When [led and] tried in the desert.
9 Your fathers did me tempt and prove,
When they my [wondrous] works did see:
10 Even forty years that sinful race
[Often] provoked and grieved me.
11 I said, This peoples hearts do err,
My [will and] ways they will not know;
To whom in wrath I swear, that to
My [promis'd] Rest they should not go.
PSALM XCVI.
1 O Sing ye now unto the Lord
New [framed] songs with joy and mirth*
Sing praises to the Lord our God,
All people of the [spacious] earth.
2 Sing to the Lord, and bless his name,
And [daily] his salvation show:
3 His Glory to the heathen tell,
Make all [the world] his wonders know.
4 For great and glorious is our God,
And greatly [to be] praised is he;
And he above all Gods and Powers,
[By all] must feared and praised be.
5 The feigned Gods are Idols all,
Which [the blind] heathen Nations fear;
It is our God alone, by whom
The heavens [and all] created were.
6 In honor, and in majesty
His [holy] presence does excel;
And strength with glorious beauty in
His Sanctuary [always] dwell.
7 All nations that on earth do dwell,
Ye people of each [land and] tribe,
Give glory to our glorious Lord,
[Glory] and strength to him ascribe.
8 Give to God's Name the glory due;
To's Courts [come and] your offering bring:
9 In splendid beauteous holiness
Worship the Lord our [supream] King.
Fear ye before him all the earth;
10 Tell [heathens] all the Lord does reign:
The world shall be established,
And [shall] not [be] removed again.
He all men righteously shall judge;
11 Let earth [be glad] and heaven rejoice:
The great sea, and its fullness all,
Praise God [even] with [its] roaring noise.
12 Let the fields prosper and rejoice,
And all that is [on and] from the earth;
The woods and all the trees shall sing,
And flourish as [it were] with mirth
13 Before the Lord; For lo, he comes,
He comes the earth to [judge and] try;
The world he will judge with righteousness,
And [people] all with equity.
PSALM XCVII.
1 GOd reigns: Let the earth be glad,
And [let the] Isles rejoice each one;
2 Darkness and clouds encompass him,
In [truth and] judgment dwells his throne.
3 Fire goes before him, and his foes
It [wasts and] burns up round about.
4 His Lightnings lightened the world,
[The] earth [it] saw, and shook throughout.
5 And at the presence of the Lord
The [mighty] hills like wax did melt;
When of the Lord of all the earth
The [dreadful] presence they had felt.
6 The glorious heavens his righteousness
[To all] do manifestly show;
His Glory so resplendent is,
That all men [willing] may it know.
7 They that serve graven Images,
[Sham'd and] confounded all shall be;
And they that of their Idols boast,
All [called] Gods, him worship ye.
8 Sion heard this, and did rejoice,
[And] Judah's daughters [all] were glad
For all thy judgments, Lord, of which
The [sight or] notice they have had.
9 For thou the glorious Lord art high
[Extoll'd] above the earth by far;
All that are called Gods by men,
[Thy] creatures and [thy] subjects are.
10 Hate evil ye that fear the Lord,
The [souls of] Saints that do him serve
He keeps out of wicked hands,
And will them all [save and] preserve.
11 For righteous men (though now in grief)
[Future] light is prepared and sown;
And gladness is by God designed
For [every] upright hearted one.
12 Ye righteous, in the Lord your God
Rejoice with [hearty] thankfulness;
The honorable memory
Keep of his [perfect] holiness.
PSALM XCVIII.
1 SIng a new song to God,
The things which he has done
Are great and mavelous,
And make his Greatness known.
His right hand high,
And holy arm, Did well perform
His victory.
2 His great salvation
The Lord has well made known,
And in the heathens sight
His righteousness has shown.
3 Toward Israel
He mercy has, And his firm truth
Remembered well.
All the ends of the earth
God's saving works and ways
Have with their eyes beheld.
4 With joy sound forth his praise.
Let all men raise
Their loudest voice, In him rejoice,
And sing his praise.
5 Sing to God with the Harp,
With Psalms and Musick's voice;
6 Trumpets and Cornets sound,
Make ye a joyful noise.
Before the Lord,
The World's great King, With praises sing
With sweet concord.
7 Let the great Ocean roar,
Its waves and fullness swell:
8 Let all the world praise God,
And they that therein dwell.
Let floods applaud,
And hills rejoice, As with one voice
The Lord to laud.
9 God's presence all attend,
For he is coming forth
With truth and righteousness,
To judge all men on earth.
The world will he
To judgment call, And judge men all
With equity.
PSALM XCIX.
1 TRemble ye people of the world,
The [righteous] Lord does reign above;
He sits between the Cherubims,
The earth [below] shall quake and move.
2 The Lord in Sion is extolled,
[He is] above all people high.
3 His holy, great, and dreadful name
Let all men [fear and] magnify.
4 Judgment loved is the strength of Kings;
Thou settlest [truth and] equity:
Just judgment thou do execute,
And rulest [Jacob] righteously.
5 Exalt the Name of God the Lord,
And at his footstool [humbly] fall:
He Is holy; in true holiness
Worship him [O ye] people all.
6 Moses and Aaron, with his Priests,
Samuel and [other] such as have
Called on him when to him they prayed,
He heard and [gracious] answer gave.
7 Within the cloudy Pillar he
Spoke unto them his [word and] will;
His testimony they received,
And kept his [holy] precepts still.
8 Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God,
And [often] did their sins forgive;
Though often also thou took'st revenge
Of what they did [amiss] contrive.
9 Exalt the name of our Lord God,
And at his [chosen] holy hill
Worship him in true holiness,
For God [our Lord] is holy still.
PSALM C.
1 ALL people that do dwell
Abroad on all the earth,
Make to the Lord a joyful noise,
Praise him with holy mirth.
2 O serve our glorious Lord
With gladness and with joys;
Before his holy presence come
With cheerful singing voice.
3 Know that the Lord is God,
It Is he that did us make,
Not we our selves; us as his flock
And people he does take.
4 Enter his gates with thanks,
Into his courts with praise;
Be truly thankful unto him,
And bless his name always.
5 For God our Lord is good,
His mercies ever sure;
And to all generations
His truth shall still endure.
The Old Meter.
1 ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
2 Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell*
Come ye before him and rejoice.
3 The Lord ye know is God indeed,
Without our aid he did us make;
We are his flock, he does us feed,
And for his sheep he does us take.
4 O enter then his gates with praise,
Approach with joy his courts unto;
Praise, laud, and bless his name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
5 For why, the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
PSALM CI.
1 MErcy and Judgment are my song,
Of these [O Lord] I Will sing to thee.
2 I Will wisely walk in perfect way;
[O Lord] when will thou come to me?
I Will walk within my house and place
With a just [mind and] perfect heart.
3 All that is wicked and profane
Shall from [before] my eyes depart.
I hate their works that turn aside,
To me it shall not [come or] cleave;
4 I will not know a wicked man,
A froward heart I Will [shun and] leave.
5 I Will cut him off who slandereth
His [righteous] neighbor secretly;
I Will not endure men of proud hearts,
Nor him that [scorns and] looks high.
6 Mine eyes shall look to faithful men,
That they may [always] dwell with me;
He that walks in a perfect way,
My [welcome] servant he shall be.
7 He that is bent to use deceit,
In my house shall not [with me] dwell;
Nor shall he tarry in my sight
Who lies does use [himself] to tell.
8 The wicked of the land I will
Soon root out, and [their works] deface;
That from the City of the Lord
I may cut off their [wicked] race.
PSALM CII. A Prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, And pours out
his complaint before the Lord.
1 LOrd hearken to my fervent prayer,
[And] let my cry come [un-] to thee.
2 And now when I in trouble am,
Hide not thy [gracious] face from me.
Bow thine ear to me when I call;
[Hear me] and answer speedily:
3 My days consumed are like smoke,
My [very] bones are burnt and dry.
4 My heart within me smitten is,
[And] like [to] grass it is withered;
So swallowed up with grief, that I
[Do even] forget to eat my bread.
5 By reason of my groaning voice,
My bones cleave to my [withered] skin:
6 I like mournful Pelican
Of [the sad] wilderness have bin.
I like an Owl in desert am,
Who nightly there does [streech and] moan.
7 I watch, and like a sparrow am
[That sits] on the housetop alone.
8 My persecuting enemies
All day [do me] reproach and scorn;
And they that mad against me are,
Are all against me [set and] sworn.
9 Ashes I eaten have like bread,
[And] mingled [have] my drink with tears;
10 Because thine indignation hot
And wrath does cause my [pains and] fears.
In mercy thou did lift me up*
But thou have cast me [very] low;
11 My days like shadows do decline,
[And] like [the] withered grass I grow.
12 But thou art the eternal God,
And [ever] do endure the same;
Beyond all generations is
The memory of thy [glorious] name.
13 Thou will arise; On Sion thou Will [timely] show thy mercy great;
The time to favor her is come,
The time [foretold] which thou have set.
14 For in her very ruined stones
Thy [faithful] servants pleasure take;
They love the very dust thereof,
And [therefore] for her prayers make.
15 So shall the very heathens fear
The [mighty] Lord's most holy name;
And all the Kings on earth shall dread
Thy [glorious] Majesty and fame.
16 When God his Sion shall build up,
In glory he will [to us] appear:
17 Distressed men's prayers he will regard,
And not despise; but [gently] hear.
18 This for the ages yet to come
Shall [written] be left on record;
They that hereafter shall be made,
Shall [gladly] serve and praise the Lord.
19 The Lord looked down on all below,
Even from his [high and] holy place;
The earth unto the Lord of Heaven
Is [ever] seen before his face.
20 To hear the prisoners doleful groans,
And save men [falsly] judg'd-to die:
21 God's name in Sion to declare,
Him there to [praise and] magnify.
22 When many people far and nigh,
Meet there [to pray] with one accord;
And when the Kingdoms shall consent
To [fear and] serve the highest Lord.
23 My strength he weakened in the way,
As shortning my [Life's short] day;
24 I said, By an untimely death,
Lord take me not [in wrath] away.
Through Ages all thou art the same,
25 The [solid] Earth's Foundations laid
Thou have of old: Heavens are the Work
Which thy own [Power and] Hands have made
26 They perish shall, but thou shall stand,
As garments they [shall all] wax old;
Thou shall them change, as Men their Clothes,
And as a Vesture [them up] fold.
27 But thou art endlesly the same;
28 Thy Servants [Off-spring] shall survive,
Their Seed established by thee,
Shall in thy [blessed] presence live.
PSALM CIII.
1 MY Soul, bless thou the glorious God,
[Praise him] and celebrate his Fame;
Let all my inward Powers concur
To [praise and] bless his holy Name.
2 Still bless the living Lord my Soul,
Never do thou [sleight or] forget
Unthankfully his benefits,
So [many] undeserved and great:
3 Thy many great provoking sins,
His Mercy [freely] does forgive:
He thy Diseases and thy Pains
Does heal [or ease] and thee relieve.
4 He did redeem thy forfeit Life,
And it from [threatned] death did free;
And with his loving kindness great,
And [tender] Mercies crowned thee.
5 What have thou wanted that is good,
To satisfy [thy just] desire?
Thy strength like Eagles he renewed,
Reviving nature's [languid] fire.
6 God will just Judgment execute
For them [by man] oppressed that are.
7 To Moses and to Israel's seed
His ways [and acts] he did declare.
8 Gracious and merciful is God,
[Great is] his mercy high and deep:
9 He Is slow to wrath; he chides not still,
Nor does his anger [ever] keep.
10 He has not dealt with us in wrath,
According to our [hainous] sin;
Nor strictly us rewarded has
As our [guilt and] deserts have bin.
11 But as the great and glorious heavens
Than [this low] earth far higher are;
God's mercy so transcendent is
To all that do him [truly] fear.
12 As far as East is from the West,
So far [from us] removed has he
Our hated and forsaken sin,
And our [bewail'd] iniquity.
13 As loving Parents (taught of God)
Pity to their [dear] Children bear;
The Lord of Love will pity them
That serve him with true [child-like] fear.
14 For he remembers flesh is dust;
Our [frail and] mortal frame he knows:
15 And that the days of man on earth
Are like the grass [in field] that grows.
16 There flowers flourish, but sharp winds
Blast them, and they are [quickly] gone;
And to the place which they persum'd
And beautified [they are] unknown.
17 But unto such as do him fear,
God's [boundless] mercy has no end;
And his sure love and righteousness
To [Childrens] Children does extend.
18 To such as keep his Covenant,
And his Commandments [keep in] mind;
And them sincerely do obey,
And therein [their chief] pleasure find.
19 The Lord his Throne prepared has
[In heaven] where Saints his glory see;
And all the world his Kingdom is,
And [Ruler] over all is he.
20 You mighty Angels, great in strength,
Must bless the Lord with [highest] praise;
Your holiness fulfils his will,
And readily [his voice] obeys.
21 All ye his great and glorious Hosts,
For ever [bless and] praise the Lord;
You serve the pleasure of his will,
And all [as one] obey his word.
22 Let all his works through all the world
To praise their [glorious] Lord, accord;
And O my soul, bear thou thy part,
And [ever] bless and praise the Lord.
PSALM CIV.
1 MY soul, bless thou the living Lord;
Thou Lord [my God] art very great:
With honor and with majesty
Thou clothed art in [glorious] state.
2 The fulgent light thy covering is,
Appearing [in it] as thy robes
Thou like a curtain do stretch out
The Heavens with all their [splendid] globes.
3 The beams of his great Chambers he
Does in the [liquid] waters lay;
The Clouds he makes his Chariots,
On [winged] Winds he takes his way:
4 Blessed Spirits he his Angels makes,
His Ministers a [flaming] fire.
5 The Earth's Foundations firm he laid,
That nothing shall them [ever] stir,
6 Like to a Garment with the deep,
The Earth [by thee] was covered:
The Waters stood above the Hills,
7 [But soon] at thy rebuke they fled.
Thy thunders voice hasts them away,
8 [They go] up by the mountain ground,
Down by the Valleys they go to
The place which thou [for them] did found.
9 Thou unto them a bound have set,
That [over] it they may not pass:
That the Earth again may not be drowned
By them, as once [for sin] it was.
10 He sends the Springs into the Vales,
They [sweetly] run between the Hills;
11 They Are drink for all beasts of the Fields,
[There] his [great] thirst the wild Ass fills.
12 By these sweet Streams the Fowls of Heaven,
Do [use to] make their dwelling house
For them and theirs: They chirp and sing
Among the [pleasant] shady Boughs.
13 And from his cloudy Chambers he
Does water [even the] highest Hills,
And by his satisfying Works,
The Earth with [plenteous] fruit he fills.
14 He for the Food of Cattle makes
The tender Grass [spring and] suit forth:
And for Man's service various Herbs,
And [so he] brings food from the Earth.
15 And Wine which does exhilerate,
And Oil which does [smooth and] refresh,
And Bread which strengthens Man's, Heart,
And does repair his [wasting] flesh.
16 The Trees of God are full of Sap,
The [stately] Cedars which do stand
In Lebanon, and planted were
[Even] by his [own] Almighty hand.
17 The beauteous Birds among these Trees*
By [Nature's] skill their Nests do make,
As for the Stork, the Firr-trees she
Does for her [lofty] dwelling take.
18 The Mountains high for the wild Goats,
A place of [secure] refuge be,
The Conies in the craggy Rocks
Dwell, and for safety [thither] flee.
19 The changing Moon he does appoint,
The Seasons change [to Man] to show
The glorious Sun, as taught by God,
Its time to [rise and] set does know.
20 The dismal darkness thou do make,
[And then] the day gives place to night,
And in the Forests then come forth,
Wild beasts that shun [Man and] the Light.
21 The hungry Lions with their whelps
[Do then] go roaring all abroad
After their prey, and fiercely seek
Their sustenance [assign'd] from God.
22 But when the shining Sun does rise,
They get [away] together then
For fear of Man; and lay them down
For [rest and] safety in their den:
23 Then Man goes forth unto his work,
[When he] enjoys desired light,
His proper labor he pursues,
Till the approach of [resting] night.
24 How manifold and numberless
Are thy great [wondrous] works, O Lord,
In wisdom thou have made them all,
Earth's with thy [plenteous] riches stored.
25 So is this great and spacious sea,
Numberless things there [swim or] creep;
Some small, some of vast magnitude,
Made [by thee] to dwell in the deep.
26 The Ships by man for Commerce made,
Go there, and make [the deep] their way;
There is the great Leviathan,
Which thou have made [therein] to play.
27 On thee the bounteous Lord of life,
All things do [daily] wait that live;
That thou sufficing sustenance
In season due [to them] may give.
28 They gladly gather and receive
That which thou giv'st [to them] for food;
Thou openest thy liberal hand,
And they are filled [by thee] with good.
29 Thou hid'st thy lightsome quickening face,
Then [sick or] troubled they decay;
They die, and to their dust return,
[When as] thou take their breath away.
30 Thou sendest forth thy vital spirit,
And they are as [it were] new made;
With beauteous verdure thou renew'st
The face of earth [which seem'd] decayed.
31 But God's own Glory endless is,
It never [fades or] waxes old;
The Lord with joy and pleasure does
His own great [perfect] works behold.
32 His very looks do make the earth,
As [a thing] frightened, to quake;
His touch does make the steadfast hills
[Forthwith] as moved to smoke and shake.
33 I will sing praise unto the Lord
The longest day I [have to] live;
And while I any being have,
To God I Will [joyful] praises give.
34 My meditation of him shall
Sweeten my thoughts when [they are] sad;
And in the way to endless joy
In God [alone] I will be glad.
35 Let sinners be consumed from earth,
[And let] the wicked no more be;
My soul, bless thou the blessed God,
All Saints the [glorious] Lord praise ye.
PSALM CV.
1 O Give ye thanks unto the Lord,
[Trust ye] and call upon his name*
And that all people may them know,
His deeds [do you] to them proclaim.
2 Sing unto him, to him sing Psalms;
Of all his [wondrous] works talk ye:
And let his great and holy name
Your [joyful] glorying still be.
3 Let all their hearts that seek the Lord
Be [ever] joyful in his grace:
4 Seek ye the Lord, and his great strength,
Evermore seek his [pleased] face.
5 Keep ye in constant memory
The [strange and] great works he has done,
His wonders, and the judgments which
His mouth to us has [truly] shown.
6 O ye his servant, Abraham's seed,
His [chosen] Israel's Offspring;
7 His judgments are in all the earth,
He is the Lord our [God and] King.
8 He keeps in faithful memory
His Covenant: it shall ever stand,
To thousand generations,
His word [to keep] he did command.
9 Which Covenant he with Abraham made,
[And he] to Isaac gave his oath:
10 This Law and endless Covenant
[He un-] to Israel sealed has.
11 Saying, I Will give thee Canaan's Land,
Your [lot of] heritage is there;
12 When they but few, yea, very few
In it, and [utter] strangers were.
13 When they from land to land did go,
Through [divers] Kingdoms often removed;
14 He suffered none to do them wrong.
But [mighty] Kings for them reproved.
15 Saying to those that sit on Thrones,
Let no [proud or] presumptuous arm
Touch my anointed holy Ones,
Nor do my [sacred] Prophets harm.
16 He called for Famine on the land,
And brake their [vital] staff of bread;
17 But did before them send a man,
By whom they [after] should be fed.
18 Joseph was for a servant sold,
His feet with [hurtful] fetters bound;
19 In Irons laid, till God's Word came,
And [tryed] he was blameless found.
20 The King then sent and loosed him,
The [People's] Ruler set him free;
21 He made him Lord of all his house,
And [Ruler] of his Land to be.
22 To bind his Princes at his will,
[Wisdom] his Senators to teach.
23 Then Israel into-Egypt came,
And [Jacob] to Ham's Land did reach.
24 His people he did much increase,
[Made] stronger than [their] enemies;
25 Whose hearts he turned to hate his flock,
[By craft] they did their hurt devise.
26 He sent his servant Moses then,
And Aaron [chosen] did command:
27 Among them they his signs did show,
And [many] wonders in Ham's land.
28 He darkness sent, and made it dark,
[And] all things [did] his word obey:
29 He turned their waters into blood,
And he [thereby] their fish did slay
30 Their land in swarms did bring forth frogs,
[Even] in [the] Chambers of their Kings;
31 His word all sorts of flies and lice
In all their Country [quickly] brings.
32 For rain he gave them hurtful hail,
And [flaming] fire was in their land;
33 Their Vines and their Fig Trees he smote,
Their [other] trees brake by his hand.
34 He spoke the word, the Locusts came,
[And] Caterpillars [did] abound;
35 Herbs of the land they eat up all,
[Devour'd] the fruits of all the ground.
36 He smote the firstborn of the land,
[Till all] their chiefest strength was gone;
37 With gold and silver brought them forth,
[And] weak in [all] their Tribes were none.
38 Egypt was glad when they were gone,
[For] their [great] fear did on them light;
39 For covering he did spread a cloud,
And fire to lead [them all] by night.
40 The people asked, and he brought Quails,
With bread [of heav'n] he filled them.
41 Waters gusht from the opened Rocks,
[And ran] in deserts like a stream.
42 For on his holy promise he,
And [on his] servant Abraham thought;
43 With joy his people, his Elect
With singing [gladness] forth he brought.
44 And he (the Lord of all) them gave
The [wicked] heathens fruitful lands;
And they thenceforth inherited
The labor of their [neighbours] hands.
45 That (hating heathen wickedness)
They might observe his [holy] Word;
And his just statutes might obey:
[All men] give praise unto the Lord.
PSALM CVI.
1 PRaise ye the Lord, to him give thanks;
He Is good; his mercy is endless:
2 Who can describe his mighty acts?
Who can all his due praise express?
3 Blessed are they that judgment keep,
Who justice practice constantly:
4 Lord mind me as thou do thine own,
With thy salvation visit me.
5 That I may see thy chosen's good,
And in thy nation's joy rejoice;
And with thy blessed inheritance
May praise thee with a glorying voice.
6 We with our sinful ancestors,
By sin from thy just Laws have gone;
Iniquity we did commit,
And very wickedly have done.
7 Our fathers did not understand
Thy wondrous plagues which Egypt struck;
Thy many mercies they forgot,
At the Red Sea did thee provoke.
8 Nevertheless he saved them,
Even for his own supreme Names-sake;
And that his own Almighty power
He known and manifest might make.
9 The Red Sea also he rebuked,
And it was dried up and fled;
And he them through the dried depths,
As after through the desert led.
10 From the pursuing hand of him
That hated them he did them save;
And he did from the enemies hand
Redeem them, and deliverance gave.
11 The waters overwhelmed their foes,
Not one of them was left alive:
12 And then they did believe his word,
And praise in joyful songs did give.
13 They soon forgot his works, and for
His Counsels did not wait with trust;
14 But in the desert tempted God,
And there provokingly did lust.
15 He granted them their own request,
But to their souls he leanness sent:
16 They envied Moses in the Camp,
And Aaron the Lord's chosen Saint
17 The opened earth Dathan devoured,
Covered Abiram's company;
18 A fire among them kindled was,
The wicked were burnt up thereby.
19 In Horeb they did form a Cal^,
The molten Image worshipped:
20 To the shape of a grazing Ox
Their God, their Glory they changed.
21 Their God and Savior, who had done
Great things in Egypt, they forgot
22 Wondrous works in the land Ham,
By the Red Sea dreadful and great.
23 Therefore he said, he would them cut off,
Had not (lest he should them destroy)
His chosen Moses in the breach
Stood for to turn his wrath away.
24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
And did not yet believe his word,
25 But often murmured in their Tents,
And heard not the voice of the Lord.
26 In desert them to overthrow
He therefore did lift up his hand;
27 Abroad to make their seed to fall,
And scatter them in every land.
28 They joined themselves to Baal-Peor,
Sacrifice of the dead they eat;
29 Thus they provoked him to wrath,
Their vile-inventions were so great.
30 Then did the plague upon them break,
But Phinehas stood up to slay
And execute Judgment on some,
And so the wasting Plague did stay.
31 This so pleased God, that he to him
Imputed it for righteousness;
And all his generations
For this he promised to bless.
32 And at the waters where they strove,
God into just displeasure brake;
So that even Moses felt his part,
And was rebuked for their sake.
33 Because their provocations great
His patient spirit so much stirred,
That he in passion with his lips
Did speak an unadvised word.
34 Nor as the Lord commanded them,
Did they the wicked Nations slay;
35 But with the heathen mingled were,
And learnt their wicked works and way.
36 And they the heathen's Idols served,
Which were to them a deadly snare:
37 By them their sons and daughters then
To Devils sacrificed were.
38 In their own Childrens guiltless blood
Their guilty hands they did embrew,
Whom unto Canaan's Idols they
For bloody Sacrifices slew.
So was the land defiled with blood,
39 And they with their own sinful way;
And with their own inventions thus
From God a whoring went astray.
40 Therefore against his people then
God's wrath was justly kindled more;
So that his own inheritance
He loathed, and did it abhor.
41 He gave them to the heathen's power,
Their wicked foes did them command;
42 Their enemies them oppressed, who were
Before subjected to their hand.
43 Many times he delivered them,
But they again provoked him so
By their own Counsels and their crimes,
That they were brought exceeding low.
44 Yet he regarded their distress,
And heard when they to him did cry:
45 His ancient Covenant also he
For them did call to memory.
And he repenting, pitied them
After his mercies manifold,
46 And made them pityed be of those
Who did them as their Captives hold.
47 Save us, O Lord, and gather us
The wicked heathens from among,
To give thanks to thy holy name,
And praise thee with triumphing song.
48 Blessed be Jehovah, Israel's God,
Henceforth to all eternity;
Let all the people jointly say,
Amen. Praise ye the Lord most high.
PSALM CVII.
1 GIve thanks to God, for he is good,
His mercies everlasting be:
2 Let God's redeemed ones say so,
Whom from their foes hands he set free.
3 And gathered them out of the lands,
From North and South, from East and West,
4 In pathless desert wandered they,
And found no City where to rest.
5 Hungry and thirsty, their souls saint
When want and streights do them oppress,
6 They in their trouble cry to God,
He saves them out of their distress.
7 He led them forth by the right way,
And in the desert did them guide;
That they might to a City go,
Where quietly they might abide.
8 O that all men would praise the Lord
For his great goodness to us shown,
And for the wondrous works which he
For us, the sons of men, has done.
9 He satisfies the longing soul,
The hungry soul with good is filled:
10 Such as in darkness and death's shade
Do sit, in painful Irons held.
11 Because against the words of God
They often sinned rebelliously;
And the just Counsels did contemn
Of him that is over all most high.
12 Their hearts with labor he brought down,
And they from man no help could have;
13 They in their trouble cried to God,
From their distress he did them save.
14 From darkness and the shade of death
He in compassion did them take;
And their afflicting Captive bonds
In pity he asunder brake.
15 O that all men would praise the Lord
For his great goodness to us shown;
And for the wondrous works which he
For us, the sons of men, has done.
16 For the enthralling gates of brass
In pieces he for them did tear*
And by his hands the Iron bands
Asunder also broken were.
17 Fools for their own transgressions,
And for their sins afflicted are:
18 Their soul abhors all sorts of meat,
They to the gates of death draw near.
19 They in their trouble cry to God,
From their distress he does them save;
20 He sent his Word, and healed them,
From danger he deliverance gave.
21 O that all men would praise the Lord
For his great goodness to us shown!
And for the wondrous works which he
For us, the sons of men, has done.
22 And let them sacrifice to him
The sacrifice of thankfulness;
And his great works declare to all,
And with singing their joy express.
23 They that in ships go to the Sea,
And in great waters business do;
24 These see the dreadful works of God,
And in the deep his wonders view.
25 He does but give out his Command,
And powerful stormy winds do rise;
Which makes the Sea in waves to rage,
And to mount up toward the skies.
26 Passengers tossed up as to heaven,
And to the deep cast down again;
Their troubled Soul in them does melt,
While fear does keep their hearts in pain.
27 They reel and stagger to and fro,
Tossed about like to drunken men,
And in this their distress and fear,
All their own wit does fail them then:
28 They in their trouble cry to God,
And he from their distress them saves,
29 He makes the storm become a calm,
And presently does still the waves.
30 Then they with gladness do rejoice,
Because their danger seems past;
And unto their desired port,
He safely brings them at last.
31 O that all men would praise the Lord,
For the great goodness he has shown;
And for the wondrous works which he
For us the Sons of Men has done.
32 And when the people congregate,
Let them his Name in triumph raise;
And in the Elders assemblies,
Let all there celebrate his praise.
33 To Deserts he the Rivers turns,
And water springs into dry ground,
34 A fruitful land to barrenness,
When wickedness does there abound.
35 He deserts turns to water-pools,
And dry ground into water springs:
36 And there he makes the hungry dwell,
And them to build a City brings:
37 To sow the fields and plant vineyards*
Which may yield them fruit of increase.
38 He blesses them; they multiply
Their flocks preserves from decrease.
39 But yet in this unconstant state
They are diminished again;
And for their sins they are brought low;
Oppressed, afflicted, and in pain.
40 On Princes he does pour contempt;
And wandering causes them to stay
In desert places for their sin,
Where desolate they find no way:
41 Yet sets he the poor on high,
From their contempt and miseries;
And like to great increasing flocks,
Gives them prosperous families.
42 All this the righteous shall perceive;
And shall rejoice these things to see,
And the mouth of iniquity,
Shall ever stopped and silent be.
Who so is wise, and will these things
Observe, and in their minds record,
They shall well understand and taste
The loving kindness of the Lord.
PSALM CVIII.
1 O God my heart is fixed;
I will sing and give praise,
2 My Glory, Psaltery, Harp and self,
For this I Will early raise.
3 Among the people all
I Will praise thy name, O God,
Thy praises I will sing among
The Nations all abroad.
4 For great thy mercy is,
Above the Heavens high,
Thy truth and faithfulness does reach
Above the cloudy Sky.
5 Above the Heavens, O God,
Be thou exalted high,
And over all the spacious earth,
Thy Glory magnify;
6 That thy beloved Ones
Delivered may be.
O save them with thine own right hand,
And hear and answer me.
7 I will rejoice, for God
Spoke from his holy Seat,
Shechem I will divide, and will
The Vale of Succoth mete.
8 Gilead is only mine,
Manasseh mine shall be:
Ephraim is the strength of my Head;
Juda gives Laws for me.
9 Moab my washpot is;
On Edom I will tread,
And the Philistine-Nation all
In triumph I will lead.
10 Who will bring me into
The City fortified?
And who will into Edom's Land
My conquering Army guide?
11 Even he that cast us off;
And wilt not thou, O God,
Again go forth before our Hosts,
When ^hey do march abroad?
12 From trouble give us help;
For vain is all Men's aid:
13 Through God, we shall do valiantly,
Our Foes he down will tread.
PSALM CIX.
1 O Thou that art God of my praise,
Neglect me not; hold not thy peace:
2 For Mouths of wicked lying Men,
To speak against me do not cease.
The Mouths of false deceitful Men
Against me widely opened be;
And with a false and lying Tongue,
Thou know they have accused me.
3 They did beset me round about,
With bitter words of hateful spite:
And though I gave to them no Cause,
Against me they did speak and fight.
4 They for my love became my foes;
But I did give my self to pray.
5 They me with ill for good reward,
And hatred for my love repay.
6 Set over him a wicked Man,
Let Satan stand at his right hand.
7 And let his Prayer become sin,
Let him when judged be condemned;
8 Let his days be but few and short,
His Office let another take;
9 Let his Children be Fatherless,
His Wife do thou a Widow make.
10 Let his Children wander and beg,
And seek their Bread in Desert soil.
11 The Extortioner ca^ch all he has;
Let Strangers all his Labors spoil:
12 Let none to him Mercy extend;
Nor pity to his Orphans show;
13 Let his Offspring be quite cut off,
And the next Age his name not know.
14 Let God his Father's Wickedness
In Justice to remembrance call.
Let unto him his Mother's sin
Be never blotted out at all;
15 But let their sins and them be seen
Before the Lord continually,
That he may cut off from the Earth
Their very Name and Memory:
16 Because he did not Mercy show,
But persecute the Weak and Poor,
That such as were of broken heart
He might destroy, or break yet more:
17 As he in cursing did delight
Upon himself so let it come;
In blessing he delighted not,
So him let it be still far from.
18 As he with cursing clothed himself,
As garments cloth adorned ones,
As water let it on him come,
And like to oil into his bones:
19 As garments to him let it be,
Even as his covering and array;
And as a girdle on his loins,
Wherewith he girded is always.
20 From God let this be the reward,
To him that is mine enemy;
And of them that against my Soul
Do evil speak maliciously.
21 But for thy own name sake, O Lord,
Do thou in mercy deal with me,
Thy mercies good, therefore, O Lord,
By it let me delivered be.
22 I poor and needy am, my heart
Wounded in me has comfort lost:
23 Like the declining shadow sunk,
And like the flitting Locust tossed.
24 My knees with fasting are grown weak,
My fatness and my flesh are worn;
25 To them that see me a reproach,
They shake their heads, at me in scorn.
26 Help me, O Lord my God, and let
Thy mercy my deliverance bring,
27 That they may know it is thy hand,
And that the Lord has done the thing:
28 Bless thou whenever they do curse,
When they rise let them shamed be;
But let thy faithful Servants all
Be glad and still rejoice in thee.
29 And let my causless enemies
Be clothed with shame and disgrace,
And let confusion mantle like,
Become the covering of their face.
30 But with my mouth I daily will
Declare the praises of the Lord,
And among the great multitude
His praises I Will speak and record.
31 For he shall stand at the right hand
Of the oppressed to control
Their foes, and save them from those Men
who do condemn the guiltless Soul.
PSALM CX.
1 THE Lord to my Lord said,
Sit thou at my right hand
Till I thy foes a foot stool make,
Subject to thy command.
2 God will from Sion send
The rod of thy great power,
In midst of all thine enemies;
Be thou the Governor.
3 A willing people in
Thy reign shall come to thee
In holy joys from mourning's womb:
Thy youth like dew shall be.
4 The Lord himself has sworn,
And will repent it never,
Of the order of Melchizedeck
Thou art a Priest for ever.
5 The great and glorious Lord,
Who is at thy right hand,
Shall in his day of wrath strike through,
Kings who do thee withstand:
6 The heathen he shall judge,
And graves fill with the dead;
And over many Countries he
Shall wound their proudest head.
7 He shall drink of the brook
That runs in the way;
Therefore shall he lift up the head
In his triumphing day.
PSALM CXI.
1 PRaise ye the Lord: with my whole heart
[With joy] I will God's praise declare;
Where upright men assembled be,
And [holy] Congregations are.
2 The works of God are very great.
And manifest his [glorious] might;
The fruitful study of all them
Who do therein [place their] delight.
3 All his work honorable is,
All glorious [steadfast] and sure;
His truth and perfect righteousness,
[Unchang'd] for ever do endure.
4 His wondrous works he made for man,
To [mind and] meditate upon;
The Lord is very gracious,
Full [he is] of compassion.
5 To all that do him fear and serve
He [daily] gives convenient food;
He always true and mindful is
His [holy] Covenant to make good.
6 The power of his wondrous works
He did [unto] his people show;
That heathens land and heritage,
[As his] he might on them bestow.
7 His hand-work Truth and Judgment are,
All his Commands are [just and] sure:
8 All done in truth and uprightness,
[They shall] from age to age endure.
9 His people he redemption sent,
His Covenant [ever] is the same,
Which he commanded; which declares
[To us] his holy reverend Name.
10 God's fear Wisdom's beginning is,
Their understanding's [sound and] sure
Who his Commandments truly keep;
His [glorious] praise does still endure.
PSALM CXII.
1 PRaise ye the Lord: Blessed is that man
Who lives [in fear] as in God's sight;
To know and practice his Commands
Who [always] greatly does delight.
2 His seed on earth shall be advanced;
The upright [Off-spring] God will bless:
3 His house shall have sufficient store,
Endless [shall be] his righteousness.
4 In their dark state rejoicing light
God to just [upright] men will raise;
Gracious and pitiful are such,
Righteous [and true] in all their ways.
5 A good man's ready to do good,
And [kindly] lends to him that needs;
And he with wise discretion does
Manage affairs, and [guide his] deeds.
6 His standing's sure: He never shall
Be [mov'd and] brought to misery;
His precious name shall be preserved
In [sweet and] endless memory.
7 Whatever evil tidings come,
He shall not [greatly] be afraid;
His steadfast heart by fixed trust
Upon the [mighty] Lord is slay'd.
8 His heart is firmly stablished,
And shall not [sink and] be dismayed;
Till his malignant enemies
[He sees] God's Justice has repaid.
9 He has abroad dispersed his seed,
And [largely] given to the poor;
God shall with honor him advance,
His righteousness shall [ever] dure.
10 This shall the wicked see, and grieve,
Gnash with his teeth [for grief] he shall;
His wealth and he shall melt away,
His [flat'ring] hopes shall perish all.
PSALM CXIII.
1 PRaise ye the Lord his servants all,
Praise [our great] God with one acoord;
(With joyful hearts, and cheerful voice)
Praise the name of the [world's great] Lord.
2 Blessed be the Lord's renowned name,
[Ever] his praise continue shall;
3 From East to West, through all the world,
God's Name [is to] be praised of all.
4 The Lord in Glory dwells on high,
[And] over [all] the Nations reigns;
His glory is above the heavens,
[No place] no limits him contains.
5 O who is like to our great God?
Who from high [Glory] looks forth
6 To heaven and its inhabitants,
And minds what is done [below] on earth.
7 He from the dust does raise the poor,
And [needy] from the dunghill brings;
8 That he like Princes may them make,
Even [Princes] with his people's Kings.
9 He to the barren woman does
A [numerous] family afford;
A joyful mother makes her
Of [many] Children: Praise the Lord.
PSALM CXIV.
1 WHen Israel out of Egypt went,
And Jacob's House by God's strong hand
From under those strange Taskmasters,
Whose speech they did not understand.
2 Judah he did his Sanctuary,
And Israel his Dominion make;
3 The Sea did see, and fled away,
And Jordan's stream was driven back.
4 Like Rams the mountains, and like Lambs
The little hills skipt to and fro:
5 O Sea, what made thee thus to flee?
Jordan, why did thou backward go?
6 Ye mountains great, what was the cause
That made you thus to skip like Rams?
Ye little hills, wherefore was it,
That you did skip like playing Lambs?
7 Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,
When Jacob's God his presence shows;
8 Which turned the Rock to water-pools,
By whom the flint like fountains flows.
PSALM CXV.
1 NOt unto us, Lord, not to us,
But do thou [all the] glory take
To thy great name, for thy own truth,
And for thy [saving] mercies sake.
2 Why should the heathen people say
To us, where is their [mighty] God?
3 But our God is in heaven, and does
What [ever] to him seems good.
4 Their Idols are silver and gold,
The work of [workmen's] hands they be;
5 They have mouths, but they do not speak,
6 And eyes [have they] but do not see.
Ears have they, but they do not hear,
Noses, but [smell or] savor not;
7 Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk;
Nor speak they through their [mouth or] throat.
8 Their makers are like them, and all
Their trust [for help] on them that build.
9 O Israel trust in the Lord,
He is their [only] help and shield.
10 O house of Aaron, trust in God,
He [only] is their help and shield:
11 You that fear God trust in the Lord,
[Your shield] who certain help will yield.
12 The Lord has mindful been of us,
And he will [surely] bless us still;
The house of Israel he will bless,
Aaron's house [also] bless he will.
13 Both small and great, that fear the Lord,
The Lord will [always] surely bless;
14 You and your Children more and more
The Lord will [bless and] still increase.
15 You are the blessed of the Lord,
Who made [both all] the earth and heaven:
16 The heaven of heavens is his, but earth
[He] to [the] sons of men has given.
17 The dead, who down to silence go,
Do not [in dust] God's praise record;
18 But we henceforth for ever will
Bless [our great] God: Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXVI.
1 I Love the Lord, who did my voice
And [earnest] supplication hear:
2 While I have life I Will call on him.
Who bowed to me his [gracious] ear.
3 The sorrows of expected death
My [flesh and] heart did compass round;
The pains of Hell took hold on me,
Trouble and [grievous] pain I found.
4 Upon the name of God, my help,
Then did I [daily] call, and say,
Deliver thou my grieved soul,
O Lord, I do thee [humbly] pray.
5 Our God is merciful and just,
Yea [very] gracious is the Lord;
6 He saves the meek: I was brought low,
And he did [speedy] help afford.
7 My soul, distrust thy God no more,
Return [by faith] to him thy Rest;
Who largely in thy great distress
[To thee] his bounty has expressed.
8 For my afflicted soul from death
[Safely] delivered was by thee;
Thou did mine eyes from mourning tears,
My feet from [dangerous] falling free.
9 Among the living I will walk,
[By faith] as still before the Lord;
10 When greatly I afflicted was,
I did believe [and spake] this word.
11 Now have I found, and therefore say
All men untrusty [lyars] be.
12 What shall I render to the Lord
For all his [bounteous] gifts to me?
13 The joyful cup of saving health
I [oft and] thankfully will take;
In God I Will trust, on him I Will call,
When I my [daily] prayer make.
14 The Vows which I did make to thee,
[My God] I thankfully will pay
Before thy Church and people all,
[Even now] without fraud or delay.
15 The death and sufferings of his Saints
The Lord does not [slight or] despise;
Whatever tempted men may think,
Their blood the Lord does [highly] prize.
16 Lord, I thy willing servant am,
[Truly] thy service I profess:
Son of thine handmaid; thou have loosed
The [heavy] bonds of my distress.
17 To thee my offering shall be
The sacrifice of [thanks and] praise;
And (as my duty and my hope)
I Will call on thee [my God] always.
18 The Vows which I did make to thee
[My God] I thankfully will pay,
Before thy Church and people all,
[Even now] without fraud or delay.
19 Even in the Courts of God's own house,
And in the [sight and] midst of thee,
O glorious Jerusalem;
[O all] his Saints, the Lord praise ye.
PSALM CXVII.
1 O All ye Nations of the world
Praise ye the Lord always;
And all ye people every where
Set forth his glorious praise.
2 For great his love and mercy is
Which he does us afford;
The Lord's Truth everlasting is,
Praise ye this glorious Lord.
PSALM CXVIII.
1 GIve thanks to God, for he is good,
His mercy [ever] does endure.
2 Let all his Israel now say
His mercy [ever] is most sure.
3 Let all the house of Aaron say
His mercy [to us] is for ever:
4 Let them all say that fear the Lord*
[That] his [great] mercy fails never.
5 I called on the name of God
In [all my] danger and distress;
The Lord did hear, and brought me forth
Into a [free and] spacious place.
6 The mighty Lord is on my side,
[Of men] I will not be afraid;
Whatever mortal man can do,
[At it] why should I be dismayed?
7 The Lord himself does take my part,
With them that [help and] succor me;
Therefore on those that do me hate,
His justice I shall [shortly] see.
8 It Is better to trust in the Lord,
Than [for to] trust to man's defense:
9 Better to trust in God, than put
In Princes [any] confidence.
10 The nations did against me rise,
And [did en-] compass me about;
But in the name of God I shall
Destroy [them all] and root them out.
11 Numbers did compass me about;
[I say] they compassed me about:
But in the name of God I shall
Cut [them all] down, and cast them out.
12 They compas'd me about like Bees,
But like a [hasty] thorny flame
They quenched are; for I shall them
Cut down in God's own [strength and] name.
13 They have thrust sore to make me fall,
But God [my help] did me relieve:
14 The Lord is all my strength and song,
And will [to me] salvation give.
15 In righteous men's dwellings there is
The voice of [health and] melody;
For God's delivering right hand
Does [always] for them valiantly.
16 The Lord's right hand exalted is,
And valiantly [for us] it does.
17 I shall not die, but live, that so
God's [mighty] works I may show forth.
18 The righteous God, for my own sin
Has me chastised [very] sore;
But yet he did not me forsake,
But me from [threatened] death restore.
19 Now set ye open unto me
The [beauteous] gates of holiness,
And I will enter in by them,
God's [publick] praises to express.
20 This is the gate of God, by which
The just [with me] shall enter in;
21 I Will praise thee, for thou have heard me,
And my [help and] salvation bin.
22 That the head cornerstone is made,
Which [foolish] builders did despise;
23 And this the Lord's own doing is,
And [it is] wondrous in our eyes.
24 This is the great and blessed day,
Which God himself [for us] has made;
And in it we together will
Rejoice, as made [by him] full glad.
25 To save us now, to thee we pray,
We thee beseech, O [gracious] Lord,
That to thy humbled flock thou will
[Peace and] prosperity afford.
26 Blessed is he that in God's name
Does come to us with [his sweet] peace;
Out of the sacred house of God
We do his [faithful] people bless.
27 God is the Lord, who has to us
Made his [Divine] light to arise;
Bind ye unto the Altar's horns
With cords our [offer'd] sacrifice.
28 Thou art my God, I Will thee exalt;
[Thou art] my God, I will thee praise:
29 Give thanks to God, for he is good,
His mercy [to us] lasts always.
PSALM CXIX.
ALEPH 1.
1 BLessed are they that are sincere,
And pure in life and heart;
Who walk according to God's Law,
And not from it depart.
2 Blessed are they that give themselves
His statutes to observe;
Seeking the Lord with all their heart,
And never from him swerve.
3 Such men go not so far astray,
As wickedly to live;
But to walk in God's holy way
Themselves sincerely give.
4 It is thy will and just command,
That with attentive heed,
Thy holy and divine Precepts
We learn and keep indeed.
5 O that my ways were so reformed
And guided all by thee;
That wholly thy statutes to keep
I might addicted be.
6 Then shall I not ashamed be,
Or lose my hoped reward,
When to all thy Commands I have
Obedient regard.
7 Then will I praise with upright heart,
And magnify thy name,
When I have learnt thy judgments just,
So as to keep the same.
Thy statutes I resolve to keep,
My Rule I will them make:
But I am weak, let not thy grace
Thy servant's soul forsake.
BETH. 2.
9 By what means may a young man best
His life learn to amend?
If he well mark and keep thy Word,
And do thereto attend.
10 Unfeignedly I have thee sought
With a devoted heart;
O let me not from the right way
Of thy Commands depart.
11 Within my heart and secret thoughts
Thy Word I have hid still;
That I might not at any time
Offend thy holy will.
12 Blessed art thou, most glorious God,
We magnify thy name;
Teach me thy statutes, that I may
Love and observe the same.
13 All the pure judgments of thy mouth
I have abroad declared;
My lips to publish thy true Word
To others have not spared.
14 In thy pure testimony's ways
I have rejoiced more,
Than if of all the wealth on earth
I had the greatest store.
15 On thy Precepts I never will
To meditate neglect;
And ever to thy holy ways,
I will have chief respect.
16 And in thy statutes true and just,
My great delight I Will set;
I hope, O Lord, thy holy Word,
I never shall forget.
GIMEL. 3.
17 According to thy bounty great,
Deal with thy servant, Lord;
That I may live to do thy work,
And keep thy holy Word.
18 Open the eyes of my dark mind,
By thy revealing light;
That thy Law's wondrous mysteries,
May be as in my sight.
19 I am a stranger in this earth,
And need a certain guide;
Thy true and just commandments
Let nothing from me hide.
20 The daily longings of my soul
Do make it pant and break;
That thy just judgments I may know,
And of their light partake.
21 Proud wicked men thou have rebuked;
They justly cursed are,
Who from thy true and righteous Laws,
Maliciously do err.
22 Contempt and false reproach of men,
Do thou from me remove,
Because thy Testimonies pure
I do observe and love.
23 Princes against me falsely spoke,
When they in Counsel sat;
But I thy servant did upon
Thy statutes meditate.
24 My comfort and my great delight
Thy Testimonies be;
And they in all my doubts and streights
Are Counselors to me.
DALETH. 4.
25 My life down to the dust declines,
So that I scarcely live;
According to thy holy Word,
Do thou my strength revive.
26 I opened all my ways to thee,
Thou did to me attend;
Teach me thy statutes, that I may
My sinful ways amend.
27 The way of thy divine Precepts
Make me to understand;
That all thy great and wondrous works
May my discourse command.
28 My soul with grief and heaviness
Does melt and drop away;
Be thou according to thy word,
My strength, support, and stay.
29 The way of lying and deceit
Lord far from me remove;
Graciously grant that thy true Law
I may believe and love.
30 The way of undeceiving truth
My fixed choice I made;
Thy judgments sure to be my guide,
Before me I have laid.
31 It is to thy just Testimonies
That constantly I cleave;
To wicked men's unjust reproach
Do not thy servant leave.
32 The way of thy Commandments
I Will ^^n with cheerful speed;
When my restrained streighten'd heart
Thou have enlarged and freed.
HE. 5.
33 Instruct me, Lord, to understand
Thy Precept's righteous ways;
That through thy grace I may observe
And keep them all my days.
34 Give me an understanding heart
To keep thy Law aright;
And I shall strictly it observe
With all my heart and might.
35 In the right paths of thy Precepts
Thy conduct I require;
They are the pleasure of my soul,
Which I do most desire.
36 Incline my heart thy testimonies
To love and still observe;
From wordly covetous desires
Turn it, and me preserve.
37 Govern and turn away mine eyes
From sights of vanity;
And quicken thou my backward heart
In thy most holy way.
38 Stablish that blessed word of thine,
Which thou have bid me hear,
Unto thy servant, who is fast
Devoted to thy fear.
39 Turn by the slanders and reproach
Of which I am afraid;
For thou will justly judge for them
Who on thy Word are stayed.
40 Thou know how greatly I have longed
Thy judgments to enjoy;
Quicken me in thy righteousness,
That I may them obey.
VAU. 6.
41 Thy mercies great and manifold
Let me obtain, O Lord;
Thy saving health let me enjoy,
According to thy word.
42 So shall I stop the slandrous mouths
Of lewd men and unjust;
For in thy sure and sacred Word,
I place my hope and trust.
43 And never let the word of Truth,
Out of my mouth depart;
For in thy judgments I have set,
My only hope and heart.
44 And while it pleases thee on earth,
My frail life to preserve;
Even while I have a day to live,
Thy Law will I observe.
45 Enlarged from restraints and fears,
I Will walk at liberty;
Because to know and keep thy Laws,
My heart I do apply.
46 Thy Testimonies I will plead,
And daily them proclaim,
Unto the face of mortal Kings,
Without all fear or shame.
47 Thy sure and just Commandments,
Guiding my ways aright;
Which I have dearly loved and kept,
Shall be my great delight.
48 To thy beloved Commandments,
My hands I Will elevate,
And in thy sacred Status I,
Will daily meditate.
ZAIN 7.
49 Thy promise to thy Servant made,
O never do forget,
For upon it thou caused'st me,
My hope and trust to set:
50 In all my various sufferings,
My comfort this shall be,
Thy holy Spirit by this word,
Renewed and quickened me.
51 The proud, and such as God contemn
Have made me long their scorn;
Yet did I not thy Law forsake,
Nor service have forborne.
52 I looked back on the days of old,
Thy judgments I did mind;
In this review of former things,
I did great comfort find.
53 Horror has taken hold on me,
When I men's evil saw;
How obstinately wicked men,
Hate and forsake thy Law.
54 The World has been my pilgrimage;
And as I past along,
Thy sure conducting Statutes were,
My guide, my joy and song.
55 Thy name I have remembered Lord,
By night instead of sleep,
And meditated in thy Law,
Which I resolve to keep.
56 This sweet employment and delight,
By thee I did enjoy,
Because to mind and keep thy Laws,
I did my Soul employ.
CHETH. 8.
57 My chosen portion and my lot,
Thou only art, O Lord;
I have resolved and professed,
That I will keep thy word.
58 My Soul did earnestly entreat
Thy face to shine on me:
Give me according to thy word,
Thy mercies great and free.
59 I did consider seriously
My ways I thought upon;
I to thy testimonies turned,
In which I since have gone;
60 When once convinced I did make haste,
And did no longer stay,
To keep all thy Commandments,
I did no more delay.
61 The troops of wicked militants
Did rob me at their will;
But thy supporting holy love
I did remember still.
62 At midnight I will wake and rise,
To render thanks to thee,
Because thy word and judgments all
So good and righteous be.
63 I choose the company of such
As fear thee in their heart,
Who neither will for love or fear
From thy Commands depart.
64 O Lord, thy mercies rich and great,
The earth throughout do fill;
O teach me to believe and do,
Thy statutes and thy will.
TETH 9.
65 Thy dealings with thy servant have
Been always good, O Lord;
For all have proved good to me,
And have made good thy word.
66 Teach me with skill and jugdment how
My ways I order must,
For I in thy Commandments
Place my belief and trust.
67 Before affliction called me back
I erred and went astray,
But now I keep thy holy word,
And by it guide my way;
68 Thou art essential Love and Good,
All good proceeds from thee,
Thy Statutes to believe and keep;
O thoroughly teach thou me.
69 The proud and wicked men have forged
Against me many a lie,
But I with my whole heart will keep
Thy Precepts constantly.
70 Their hearts are fat with pride and wealth;
They live in mirth and ease,
But in thy Law do I delight,
And thee my God to please.
71 It proved very good for me,
That thou did me correct,
To understand and keep thy Law
Thy rod did me direct:
72 The good word of thy mouth to me
Is better manifold.
Then Worldlings wealth and thousands be
Of Silver and of Gold.
JOD 10.
73 Thy hands have made and fashioned me,
It Is thee by whom I live,
That thy Commandments I may learn,
Me understanding give;
74 They that thy mercy to me see,
Who fear thee, will be glad,
Encouraged, because thy word
My hope and trust I made.
75 I know, O Lord, that thy judgments,
All good and righteous be,
And that in love and faithfulness,
Thou have afflicted me;
76 To me thy merciful kindness,
I pray thee now afford,
To comfort this thy Servant's Soul,
According to thy word.
77 Thy tender mercies pour on me,
That I to thee may live,
For holy comfort and delight,
Thy Law to me does give.
78 Confound the proud, who dealt with me
Perversely without cause;
But still I Will meditate upon,
And keep thy holy Laws.
79 Let those that fear thee come to me,
And see what thou have done,
And let them join in thanks that have,
Thy testimonies known.
80 And in thy righteous Statutes all
Let my heart still be sound,
And then no guilt or Men's reproach,
With shame shall me confound.
CAPH 11.
81 My Soul for thy Salvation faints,
Till I do it obtain;
But still thy sure and faithful word,
With hope does me sustain:
82 Mine eyes do fail, while on thy word,
I wait and daily say,
When will thou comfort me, O Lord?
O make no more delay.
83 Like a dried bottle in the smoke,
With grief I am become;
Yet do I not thy sacred word
Forget to think upon.
84 How many are thy Servant's days?
O might I live to see,
That thou will judgment do on them,
That persecutors be.
85 The proud malicious sort of men,
Who do oppose thy Law,
Have dug pits and laid their snares,
As if they thought none saw.
86 Thy holy Laws (which they oppose)
All faithful are and just,
They persecute me wrongfully,
Be thou my help and trust.
87 Hunting and wasting me on earth,
They scarce alive me leave;
Yet I forsake not thy Precepts,
But ever to them cleave.
88 After thy loving kindness yet,
Revive me and restore,
So shall I keep thy holy word,
And trust it more and more.
LAMED 12.
89 Thy word and thy decree, O Lord,
For ever shall endure;
Its settled in the Heavens above,
Established and sure.
90 Thy faithfulness to ages all
Does certainly extend;
Thou have established the earth,
And it does firmly stand.
91 According to thine ordinance
They all remain this day;
For all thy Works and Servants are,
And do thy will obey;
92 Unless thy good and faithful word
Had been my Soul's delight,
In my affliction I had sunk,
Despaired and perished quite.
93 Thy holy Precepts never shall
By me forgotten be,
For thou in my dejected state
By them did quicken me;
94 By holy Covenant I am thine;
Therefore thy Servant save,
For with desire and diligence
Thy Precepts sought I have.
95 Ungodly men have lain in wait
My Life for to destroy;
But I thy testimonies all
Will think upon with joy.
96 Of all that earth perfection calls
I have perceived an end;
But thy Commandments to all time
And places do extend.
MEM 13.
97 How greatly do I love thy Law;
It has been all the day.
My serious Meditation,
And my delight and joy.
98 Through thy Commandments thou did make
Me wiser than my foes;
Where ere I am, what ere I do,
It ever with me goes.
99 I greater understanding have
Than all my Teachers far,
Because thy testimonies still
My meditation are:
100 In understanding I exceed
Them that did older live,
Because in keeping thy Precepts
Thou did more Wisdom give.
101 And I my feet refrained have
From every evil way,
That I may keep thy holy word,
And ever it obey.
102 From thy sure word and judgments just
I never will depart;
For thou art he that teach me,
And speak to the Heart.
103 How sweet unto my relish are
Thy words of saving truth!
The sweetest honey never was
So pleasant to my mouth.
104 By serious study of thy word,
I understanding gat,
Which made me turn from Vanity,
And every false way hate.
NUN 14.
105 Thy Word is unto me a Lamp,
And unto me a Light,
Through this dark and deceitful world.
To guide my way aright
106 I covenanted and vowed to thee,
And it perform I will,
That I will keep thy righteous Laws,
And strive them to fulfill.
107 My various afflictions,
Are very sharp and sore,
According to thy faithful word,
Revive and me restore.
108 The free will offering of my mouth,
Accept I thee beseech,
And unto me thy Servant Lord,
Thy judgments clearly teach.
109 My mortal life continually
I carry in my hands;
Yet do I not in dangers great,
Forget thy just Commands.
110 The wicked for my envied life,
Have laid a secret snare,
But I will not for fear or hope,
From thy Commandments err.
111 Thy Statutes are the heritage,
Of which I have made choice
To my last day; for it is they,
That make my heart rejoice;
112 My heart inclined by thy grace,
Does fixedly intend,
Thy sacred Statutes to obey,
And keep unto the end.
SAMECH 15.
113 False thoughts and vanity I hate,
But love thy Statutes just;
114 Thou art my shield and hiding place,
Upon thy word I trust.
115 All ye that evil doers are,
Depart from me away,
For the Commandments of my God,
I purpose to obey.
116 According to thy faithful word,
Uphold and stablish me,
That I may live and of my hope,
Never ashamed be.
117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be,
In peace and safety kept,
And to thy perfect guiding word,
I Will ever have respect.
118 All those who from thy Statutes err,
Thou treadest down as vile,
Their false deceits do but themselves,
And other men beguile.
Lewd men like dross thou casts away,
Therefore I love thy word;
120 For fear of thee my flesh does quake,
I dread thy judgments Lord.
AIN 16.
121 I faithfully have practiced
Judgment and righteousness;
O leave me not to those men's wrath,
Who me by might oppress:
122 Be surety for thy Servants good,
Let not the proud oppress,
123 Mine eyes for thy Salvation fail,
And word of righteousness.
124 According to thy Mercy great,
With me thy Servant deal,
And thy instructing Statutes all,
Clearly to me reveal.
125 I am thy Servant; Wisdom give,
That I thy Laws may know,
126 Its time for thee, O Lord, to work,
For men make void thy Law.
127 Therefore I love thy word, and it
In estimation hold
Better than Gold and worldly Wealth,
Yea than the finest Gold:
128 All that thy Law determines
I judge to be most right;
And all men's false deceiving ways
Are hateful in my sight.
PE 17.
129 Wonderful are thy Testimonies;
My Soul keeps them with care:
130 The entrance of thy word gives light
To them that simple are.
131 My thirsty Soul with strong desire,
Does pant with open mouth,
Because I longed to know and keep
Thy words of saving Truth.
132 Look on me, and be merciful,
Bestow on me the same,
Which thou accustomed art to give
To those that love thy Name;
133 Let all my steps by thy just word
Exactly ordered be,
That no iniquity may have
Dominion over me.
134 Save me from mine oppressors all,
And I will keep thy word;
135 O let thy face upon me shine,
Thy Statutes teach me Lord.
136 Rivers of water from mine eyes
Ran down when as I saw,
How wicked men go on in sin,
And will not keep thy Law.
TZADDI 18.
137 Righteous art thou, O Lord, and all
Thy judgments upright be,
138 Righteous and faithful are thy Laws,
Which thou command me.
139 My zeal has even consumed me,
Because mine enemies
Thy holy Word forgotten have,
And thy just Laws despise.
140 Because thy word is tried and pure,
Thy Servant loves it;
141 Small and despised I am, but yet
Thy Laws do not forget.
142 Thy righteousness most steadfast is,
And ever does endure;
Thy holy Law is truth it self,
Confirmed truth and sure.
143 Trouble and anguish have me found,
And taken hold on me;
Yet in this trouble my delight,
Thy just Commandments be;
144 Thy testimonies righteousness
Even everlasting is,
Cause me to know them that they may
Bring me to life and bliss.
KOPH 19.
145 With my whole heart I poured forth
My cries to thee, O Lord;
Hear and deliver me, that I
May keep thy holy word.
146 In trouble I do cry to thee,
Thy Servant hear and save,
And then to keep thy testimonies,
Fully resolved I have.
147 The dawning of the morning I,
Prevented with my cry;
For on thy true and faithful word,
My hope did all rely.
148 My waking eyes betime prevent,
The watches of the night,
That in thy comfortable word,
Then meditate I might.
149 After thy loving kindness hear,
My voice and answer give;
In mercy great with quickening grace
Do thou my Soul revive.
150 The wicked hunters do draw nigh
Who after mischief run;
Thy holy Law they do forsake,
And far from it are gone.
151 But thou, O Lord, art always nigh,
Their mischiefs to repel,
And all thy word thou will make good,
Which does in truth excel.
152 As for thy testimonies all,
Of old I know full sure,
That thou have firmly founded them,
For ever to endure.
RESH 20.
153 Consider my affliction great,
And me in safety set,
By thy deliverance, for I
Thy Law do not forget.
154 Plead my just cause, and it defend,
Deliver me, O Lord;
Revive and comfort me again,
According to thy word.
155 Salvation's far from wicked men,
It Is far from their intents,
To seek it in the only way
Of thy Commandments.
156 Many and very great, O Lord,
Thy tender mercies be;
According to thy Judgments just,
Restore and quicken me.
157 Many my persecutors are,
And foes who do combine;
Yet from thy testimonies pure,
My soul does not decline.
158 When I beheld transgressors ways
I grieved; and abhorred
Their opposition to thy Laws,
Who would not keep thy word.
159 Consider how on thy Precepts
My heart with love is set;
Quicken me, Lord, according to
Thy loving kindness great.
160 From the beginning all thy word
Has been most true and sure;
And all thy righteous judgments shall
For evermore endure.
SCHIN. 21.
161 Princes have persecuted me
Unjustly without cause;
But thy authority and word
My heart and Conscience awes.
162 I in thy word rejoice as one
That finds riches great;
163 I love thy Laws, but Lying all
I do abhor and hate.
164 Seven times a day in holy praise
My Soul ascends to thee,
Because thy judgments and thy ways
All good and righteous be.
165 Great peace have these confirmed Souls,
Thy Laws who truly love,
No fears or scandal shall these men
From God and Truth remove.
166 For thy Salvation I have hoped,
And thy Commandments done;
167 My Soul thy Testimonies kept,
And loved them every one;
168 Thy Testimonies and Commands
I kept with constant care,
For all my ways and works I know
Before thee open are.
TAU 22.
169 O Let my daily suit and cry
Before thee come, O Lord,
To me sound understanding give
According to thy word.
170 And let my supplication
Before thee daily come,
My fears according to thy word
Deliver thou me from.
171 From a full heart my thankful lips
Shall utter joyful praise,
When thou have made me know and keep
Thy statutes and thy ways.
172 My tongue shall of thy word discourse,
Its goodness I Will express,
Because all thy Commandments
Are truth and righteousness.
173 In all streights let thy mighty hand
With succor me relieve;
For I by choice have made thy Laws
The Rule by which I live.
174 Lord, for thy sure salvation
My soul does daily long;
Thy Law is still my heart's delight,
Its praises are my song.
175 O let my drooping soul yet live,
And it shall give thee praise;
And let thy judgments succor me,
And be my help always*
176 I like a lost sheep went astray,
Thy servant seek and find;
I yet forget not thy Commands,
Still print them on my mind.
PSALM CXX.
1 IN my distress unto the Lord
I poured out my [mournful] cry;
His ear attended my request,
He heard [and help'd] me speedily.
2 From lying lips deliver me,
[Lord, and] from the deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given and done to thee,
False mouth, that causes [others] wrong?
4 Sharp arrows from a mighty hand,
With [burning] coals of Juniper.
5 Woe's me, that I in Meshech stay,
And [dwell in] the Tents of Kedar.
6 My soul has too long dwelt with them
That haters are of [quiet] peace:
7 I am for peace; but when I speak,
To war they soon [themselves] address.
PSALM CXXI.
1 UNto the hills, from whence my help
Does come, I [will] lift [up] mine eyes.
2 In God, who made both heaven and earth,
My only [help and] succor lies.
3 He will not let thy foot be moved,
Nor slumbers who thee [always] keeps.
4 Behold, he that keeps Israel,
He slumbers not, nor [ever] sleeps.
5 The mighty Lord thy keeper is,
And he does [always] by thee stand;
To be a shade and a defense
[Daily] to thee at thy right hand.
6 The scorching Sun in Summer heat,
Shall not by day thee [hurt or] smite;
Nor the Moon's hurtful influence
Annoy thee in the [darksome] night.
7 The Lord shall keep thee from all ill,
Thy soul he shall keep [safe and] sure;
8 Thy going out, and coming in
The Lord shall still [to thee] secure.
PSALM CXXII.
1 WHen in the willing crouding flock
I heard that [pleasant] welcome voice,
Come, let us go up to God's house,
It made my [longing] heart rejoice.
2 Our feet in God's Jerusalem
Shall stand, even in her [Gates and] Courts,
When those who were dispersed by men,
Shall [thither] flock in great resorts.
3 God's City is (not a rude heap,
But) built in [comely] form exact;
In great diversity of parts,
In order all [are well] compact.
4 Thither the several Tribes go up,
[The Tribes] in Covenant with the Lord;
With thanks to celebrate his Name,
His Mysteries and [holy] Word.
5 There God has placed Thrones of Power,
To judge [his flock] in righteousness;
The promised Thrones of David's house,
[Which] God's [own] Government express.
6 Pray for Jerusalem's true peace,
Lord prosper all her [faithful] friends;
7 Her Courts bless with prosperity,
Let Peace [within] her walls defend.
8 For my dear holy brethrens sake,
Who have my [faithful] comforts bin;
I Will daily beg of God for thee,
Safety [without] and Peace within.
9 And for the sake of God's own house,
Where we his name must [praise and] bless;
With all the powers of my soul
I Will seek thy [real] happiness.
PSALM CXXIII.
1 LOrd, in my lowest state
To thee I lift mine eye;
Whose glorious dwelling is above,
Even in the heavens high.
2 As servants eyes do look
Unto their Master's hands;
And as a maiden does expect
Her Mistresses Commands.
So on the Lord our God
Our eyes do still attend;
Until to our relief and help
His mercy condescend.
3 Have mercy on us, Lord,
On us thy mercy show;
For we are filled with contempt,
From the insulting foe.
4 Our souls filled with the scorn
Of those that are at ease;
Are overwhelmed with the contempt
Of the proud foes of peace.
PSALM CXXIV.
1 HAd not the Lord been on our side,
His Israel must [now] confess:
2 Had not the Lord been on our side,
When men [of blood] sought our distress.
3 Then they had swallowed us alive,
When [their hot] wrath against us flamed;
4 The waters of their furious rage
Over our [sinking] souls had streamed.
5 Then had these proud insulting waves
Overwhelmed us with their [cruel] Laws:
6 Blessed be the Lord, who made us not
A prey unto their [greedy] jaws.
7 Our soul like an entangled bird
Escaped out of the [Fowler's] snare;
The snare our powerful Lord has broke,
Our [trembling] souls escaped are.
8 Our only help we find does stand
In the [great] name of our [great] Lord,
Whose power made the glorious heavens,
[The earth] and all things by his word.
PSALM CXXV.
1 THey that in God put all their trust
Shall firmly stand like Sion hill,
Which by no changes is removed,
But [is] the same [and] stands still.
2 And as about Jerusalem
Mountains enclose that [holy] ground;
So will the Lord for evermore
[Himself] his people compass round.
3 For just men's rights and heritage
[Wicked] men shall not still possess,
Lest righteous men should then put forth
Their [tempted] hand to wickedness.
4 Do good, Lord, to those that are good,
To men [that are] of upright heart;
But as for such as turn aside,
In crooked ways [by sin] pervert.
5 The Lord shall lead them forth with those
Who [love and] work iniquity;
But everlasting blessed peace
On [God's true] Israel shall be.
PSALM CXXVI.
1 WHen God did lay aside his wrath,
And [Captive] Sion did redeem,
The great surprisal of our joy
Made us like men that [do but] dream.
2 Our mouth then filled with laughter did
[By] singing our [great] joy express;
That God has done great things for us,
The heathen [enemies] did confess.
3 That God has done great things for us,
We speak with [glad and] thankful mouth:
4 Fully restore thy Captives, Lord,
As streams refresh the [scorched] South.
5 They that do sow in mournful tears,
Their [water'd] seed's not cast away;
But they a multiplied crop
Shall [shortly] reap with endless joy.
6 He that in tears does now go forth,
And cast his [precious] seed on earth;
With great increase in plenteous sheaves
Shall come again with [endless] mirth.
PSALM CXXVII.
1 EXcept the Lord do build house,
[It's but] vain pains the builders take:
Except the Lord the City keep,
[It's but] in vain the Watchmen wake.
2 It Is vain for you betime to rise,
And late [your selves] from rest to keep;
To eat the bread of grief and care,
While God's beloved [rest and] sleep.
3 Good Children are God's heritage,
The womb's [blest] fruit [is] his reward:
4 Children of youth like arrows are,
For Parents strength [and joy] prepared.
5 Happy therein is he that has
[His house] his Quiver full of those;
For he unshamed in the gate
Shall [boldly] speak unto his foes.
PSALM CXXVIII.
1 Blessed is each one that fears the Lord,
And walks in his [holy] ways:
2 For thou shall of thy labor eat,
And happy [shalt thou] be always.
3 As fruitful Vines by thy house-side,
So shall thy wife [with fruit] spring out;
Thy children like to Olive Plants,
[Shall stand] thy table round about.
4 Behold, the man that fears God,
Blessed visibly [by him] shall be:
5 The Lord shall out of Sion give
A [plenteous] blessing unto thee:
Jerusalem's good thou shall see,
Whilst thou [in life] on earth do dwell;
Thy Children's Children thou shall see,
And [promis'd] peace on Israel.
PSALM CXXIX.
1 MAny a time, may Israel say,
With thankfulness [to God] in truth,
Have wicked men afflicted me,
Even from my [prime and] early youth.
2 Many a time, even from my youth,
Their [cruel] hands have me assailed;
But for my wished overthrow
They have not yet [by rage] prevailed.
3 The plowers plowing on my back,
Did [long and] bloody furrows make.
4 But God is just, and me preserved,
Their strongest cords he [always] brake.
5 Let wicked men, who Sion hate,
And [all their] plots confounded be;
Let them with shame be turned back,
And not [their hop'd] successes fee.
6 Let them be like the rootless grass,
Which grows [a while] on the house-tops,
And quickly withers away,
Before they reach their [wicked] hopes.
7 This grass fills not the mower's hand,
The binder finds no [fruitful] sheaves;
8 Nor God nor man on such cursed weeds,
A blessing [either] finds or leaves.
PSALM CXXX.
1 OUt of the horrid woeful deeps,
Where sin [and wrath] had cast me down,
To thee, O Lord, I poured forth
My earnest suit and [daily] moan.
2 O thou the Prayer-hearing God,
This [humbled] sinner's voice now hear;
To my loud cries and sad complaints,
Let pity grant a [hearing] ear.
3 If in strict Justice thou should mark,
And charge [on man] iniquity;
Lord, who shall stand at thy just bar?
Or [who] himself [can] justify?
4 But with thee there forgiveness is,
Thy word [of grace] does this declare;
That sinful man may worship thee
In [joyful] hope without despair.
5 Therefore for thee, O Lord, I wait,
My soul does [daily] wait on thee;
And on thy sure and faithful word
My [constant] hope shall placed be.
6 My soul more waits on the Lord
Than they that watch for [morning] light;
More than the watchful man does long
To see a [pleasant] morning bright.
7 O Israel still hope in the Lord,
Though [low and] broken be thy case;
For with the Lord still mercy is,
And we shall see his [pleased] face.
8 Plenteous redemption with him is;
The Lord his [chosen] flock will bless:
He will redeem them from their sins
And from their [felt and] feared distress.
PSALM CXXXI.
1 LOrd, I disclaim a haughty mind,
And an ambitious [lofty] eye;
I do not exercise my self
In things for me too [great and] high.
2 Thou know I have behaved my self
In quietness, as [low and] mild;
As a child weaned from the breast,
[My soul's] even as a weaned child.
3 Upon the Lord let Israel,
With [fullest] trust and hope rely;
Not only now, but from henceforth,
Even [un-] to [all] Eternity.
PSALM CXXXII.
1 REmember David's troubles, Lord;
2 Who vowed to Jacob's [mighty] God,
3 And swear, I Will not come to my house,
Nor go [for rest] unto my bed.
4 I Will give mine eyes no sleep, until
5 I find a [holy] place to dwell;
A habitation for the Lord,
The [mighty] God of Israel.
6 At Shiloh's place in Ephraim,
We heard God's [holy] Ark once stood;
We found it also in the fields,
And [in the] City of the wood.
7 We'll go into his Tabernacle,
And [humbly] at his footstool bow;
8 Arise, O Lord, unto thy rest*
Thy [holy] Ark of strength and Thou.
9 Let righteousness be to thy Priests,
Their clothing and their [comely] dress;
And let thy Saints that worship thee,
Even shout [aloud] for joyfulness.
10 And for thy servant David's sake,
[With shame] turn not away the face
Of him, whom thou anointed have,
And chosen [freely] by thy grace.
11 The Lord to David swear in truth,
And [surely] will not turn from it;
Upon the Throne of Majesty,
Thy [body's] Offspring I will set*
12 My Covenant if thy sons will keep,
And Laws which I [to them] make known;
Their Children also then shall sit
For ever on thy [Royal] Throne.
13 For Sion the Lord chosen has,
[And] there to dwell [he] likes best.
14 This is my chosen dewlling place,
This is my [worship's] fixed rest.
15 I her provisions will maintain,
And [it will] bless abundantly;
And I her poor and needy ones,
With [daily] bread will satisfy.
16 And I her sacred Priests will cloth
With my preserving [saving] grace;
Her Saints shall shout aloud for joy
Before my shining [pleased] face.
17 There I Will make David's horn of Power
To bud forth, and [afresh] to spring;
And there I have ordained a lamp
For my anointed [sacred] King.
18 His enemies I will subdue,
[And] with [just] shame I Will cloth them all;
But on him and his faithful seed,
His [Royal] Crown still flourish shall.
PSALM CXXXIII.
1 BEhold and try how good it is,
What [holy] pleasure it does give,
When holy brethren serving God,
In [love and] unity do live.
2 It perfumes like the precious Oil,
[Which] poured [was] on Aarons head;
Which down his beard and garments all,
Its [sacred] fragrant odor spread.
3 As fruitful dews from Hermon hill,
[Which] waters [all] the lower ground;
And streaming showers from Sion's Mount
Make [the low] Vales with fruit abound.
So on his flock by Love and Peace,
God does his [fruitful] grace entail;
Even the fore-ta^^e of that blessed life,
Where Love [and Peace] shall never fail.
PSALM CXXXIV.
1 SEe that ye bless the Lord,
Ye that his servants are;
Who in his house by night do stand,
To serve and praise him there.
2 Lift up your hearts and hands
To him with one accord;
In his appointed holy place,
There glorify the Lord.
3 The Lord that made the heavens,
The earth, and all that live;
His blessing out of Sion shall
Plenteously to you give*
PSALM CXXXV.
1 PRaise ye the Lord: Praise his great name;
All ye his servants, Praise your God.
2 All you that in the Lord's house stand,
And in his Courts have your abode.
3 Praise ye the Lord, for he is good,
Sing praises to his holy name;
For it is sweet to be employed.
His holy praises to proclaim:
4 He to himself has Jacob chose,
And Israel his own treasure made;
5 I know the Lord our God is great,
Above all Gods in honor had.
6 In heaven and earth the Lord has done
Whatever his own will did please;
And also in the deeps below,
And in the great and swelling Seas.
7 From the earth's ends it is he that makes
The vapors upward to ascend;
He does make Lightnings for the rain,
And Winds out of his treasure send.
8 Egypt's firstborn, both man and beast,
He smote, and wondrous tokens he
9 On Pharaoh and his servants sent,
O Egypt, in the midst of thee.
10 He smote great Nations, slew great Kings;
11 Sihon, who was of Heshbon King,
And Og of Bashan; and to naught
All Canaan's Kingdoms he did bring.
12 And gave their Land a heritage
Unto his people Israel:
13 Thy name, Lord, everlasting is,
For ever's thy memorial.
14 For God for his own people will,
To judge and save them, yet arise;
And will turn and repent himself
Of all his servants miseries.
15 The Idols which are worshipped
Abroad in all the Heathen lands;
They are of gold and silver made,
The mere work of the Craftsmens hands.
16 A mouth they have, but do not speak;
Eyes have they, but they never saw.
17 They have ears, but they do not hear;
And mouths, which never breath did draw.
18 Their makers are even like to them,
And all that do on them rely.
19 Bless ye the Lord, O Israel's house;
Bless God, O Aaron's family.
20 His servants all of Levi's house,
Continually bless ye the Lord;
All every where that do him fear,
Daily bless God with one accord.
21 In Sion God's own chosen place,
Bless him, and there his praise record;
Who dwells at Jerusalem
In holiness, praise ye the Lord.

PSALM CXXXVII.
1 IN Babylon's Captivity
We [sadly] by their rivers sat;
When Sion we remembered there,
We wept [as men] disconsolate.
2 On Willows in the midst thereof
We hanged our [silent] Harps unstrung;
For they who had us Captives made,
[In scorn] required of us a Song.
3 They that had made our Country wast,
To make sport [of us] talked thus,
Now sing us one of Sion's songs,
[Said they] insulting over us.
4 How shall we sing God's sacred songs,
Thus [Captives] in a foreign land?
5 If I Jerusalem forget,
Let [Musick] skill forsake my hand.
6 Let my tongue dumb cleave to my jaws
If [belov'd] Sion I forget;
And if above my chiefest joy
I do not Sion [always] set.
7 Remember Edom's Offspring, Lord,
Who in thy peoples [woful] day,
Cried, Raze it, Raze it to the ground,
This [hated] City level lay.
8 O Babylon, to destruction judged,
That [conquering] hand shall honored be,
Which just as thou have used us,
[A just] reward shall give to thee.
9 That Victor's hand shall honored be,
That [fiercely] takes thy little ones;
(Not we, but foes in bloody war)
Will dash them [dead] against [the] stones.
PSALM CXXXVIII.
1 WIth my whole heart I will thee praise,
Before the Gods [thy praise] I Will sing:
2 I Will towered thy holy Temple bow,
And praise thy name, O [glorious] King.
Even for thy loving kindness great,
And for thy [holy] truth, O Lord;
Above all thy instructing name
Thou have advanced thy [sacred] word.
3 In my sad days thou answered'st me,
When I to thee did [pray and] cry;
And thou my feeble soul with strength
Did [kindly] strenghthen inwardly.
4 All Kings on earth shall praise the Lord,
When they shall hear [and know] thy word;
And singing shall walk in thy ways,
So great's thy [fame and] glory, Lord.
5 The God that is infinitely high,
The lowly [men he] does respect;
But knows the proud as afar off,
And with disdain [doth them] reject.
6 Though I in midst of trouble walk,
[Thou wilt] revive me, and extend
Thy hand against mine enemies wrath,
[And] thy [right] hand shall me defend.
7 All that my welfare does concern,
The Lord [at last] will perfect make;
O Lord, thy mercy endless is,
Do not thy [handy] work forsake.
PSALM CXXXIX.
1 O Lord, thou have me searched and known:
2 Thou know my [daily] sitting down,
And mine uprising: All my thoughts,
[Even a-] far off to thee are known.
3 Thou fift'st and compassest my path,
[And] see [me] when down I lie;
And art with all my works and ways
[Always] acquainted perfectly.
4 No word is in my tongue, O Lord,
But it is [fully] known to thee;
5 Thou have beset me round about,
And [thou hast] laid thy hand on me.
6 This knowledge high's above my reach,
[It is] too wonderful for me:
7 Whither shall I go from thy face?
Or [whither] from thy spirit flee?
8 If into heaven I could ascend,
Yet [surely] thou art present there;
Or if in hell I make my bed,
Or [in the] grave, there thou art near.
9 If on the morning's wings I fled,
[And d'well] the utmost Seas beyond;
10 There by thy hand I shall be led,
And [safely] held by thy right hand.
11 Or if I say, The darkness sure
Shall hide me from thy [piercing] sight;
The darkness, even the most obscure,
About me shall be [as the] light.
12 Yea, darkness hides not from thee,
But night does shine as [bright as] day;
To thee the darkness and the light
[Indeed] are both alike always.
13 For thou possessed have my reins,
And thou did form and cover me,
When I within my mother's womb
Enclosed was [and shap'd] by thee.
14 I Will praise the Lord, for fearfully
And strangely made [by thee] I am;
Thy works are all unsearchable,
My soul [convinc'd] does know the same.
15 My substance was not hid from thee,
Though [formed] in a secret place;
In the low sordid earthly parts,
[By thee] I wisely fashioned was.
16 Thine eyes my unshap'd substance saw,
My parts were [written] in thy book;
And in continuance formed were,
When none [as yet] had fashion took.
17 How precious also are the thoughts
Of thee, O [gracious] God, to me!
How great their sum? more than the sand
18 In number [they if] counted be.
I when I wake am still with thee;
19 [Surely] thou will the wicked slay,
O God! Therefore to men of blood,
Depart [ye far] from me, I Will say.
20 For they against thee wickedly
[Do] speak with [much] profane disdain;
Thy enemies blasphemously
Do take thy [holy] Name in vain.
21 Do I not hate them all, O Lord,
Who are thy [hating] enemies?
And am not I grived with those
That [madly] up against thee rise?
22 I hate them with a perfect hate,
I count them for my [chiefest] foes:
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;
Try me [and] my [hid] thoughts disclose.
24 And see if any hurtful way
Of [wilful] sin be found in me;
And in thy everlasting way
Let me [always] be led by thee.
PSALM CXL.
1 LOrd, from perverse and evil men
[Do thou] grant me deliverance;
And let me be by thee preserved
From [cruel] men of violence.
2 Who in their hearts continually
Contriving [some great] mischief are;
And altogether are combined
[In Plots] for hurtfulness and war.
3 Like Serpents their pernicious tongues
[Have they] with venom sharpened;
The Adder's poison and his sting
Under their [wicked] lips is bred.
4 Keep me, O Lord, from wicked hands,
And from the [envious] violent man,
Who have resolved to overthrow
My [blameless] goings if they can.
5 The proud for me have hid a snare,
[With cords] and they have spread a net,
By the way side, where I must go,
They [traps and] grins for me have set.
6 I went unto the Lord, and said,
Thou art my God [and help] alone;
Lord hear my voice, in mercy grant
My [humble] supplication.
7 O God, thou only art the strength
Which ever [safely] keeps me;
My head in days of bloody war
Was covered [and sav'd] by thee.
8 The wicked men's hurtful desires,
Lord, prosper not, nor [ever] grant;
And further not their bad designs.
Lest of themselves they [proudly] vaunt.
9 As for the leading head of those
That [fiercely] compass me about,
Let the mischief of their own lips
Cover [them all] and find them out.
10 Let burning coals upon them fall,
Cast them into the [wasting] fire;
Into deep pits, that they rise not
[Again] to pursue their desire.
11 Let not the false ill speaker be
[On earth] fixed in prosperity;
Let evil hunting violent men
[Reach and] overthrow them utterly.
12 I know that God will yet maintain
The cause of men [that are] distressed;
And will defend the poor men's right,
And such as are [by men] oppressed.
13 Surely the just shall to thy name
Give thanks, and [of thy] mercies tell;
And men of upright hearts and lives
Shall [ever] in thy presence dwell.
PSALM CXLI.
1 LOrd, unto thee I cry,
O make thou have to me;
Give ear unto my mournful voice
When I cry unto thee.
2 As incense let my prayer
Be set before thine eyes;
And the up-lifting of my hands,
As evening sacrifice.
3 O Lord, a constant watch
Set thou my mouth before;
And of my lips, left they offend,
Do thou still keep the door.
4 To any evil thing
Let not my heart incline,
To join in sin with wicked men,
Or of their pleasures dine.
5 Let righteous men in love
Smite me, and me reprove;
This shall not break my head, but as
A precious Oil shall prove.
In their distress I Will pray,
6 When in the stony street
Their Judges are cast down, they will hear,
My words will then be sweet.
7 Our bones at the grave's mouth
Are cast and scattered round;
As wood which men do cut and cleave,
Lies scattered on the ground.
8 But, Lord my God, mine eyes
Still look up unto thee;
In thee is all my trust; Let not
My soul forsaken be.
9 Keep thou me from the snare
Which they have laid for me;
And the entrapping grins of men,
That wicked workers be.
10 Let men of ill designs
Fall into their own trap,
Whilst from all their malicious plots
Thy flock and I escape.
PSALM CXLII.
1 I To the Lord in my distress
With [sad and] mournful voice did cry;
My supplication I sent up
[Aloud] unto the Lord most high.
2 To him I poured out my complaint,
My trouble I [to him] did show;
3 My spirit in me was overwhelmed,
[And all] my danger thou did know.
That in the way wherein I walked
They [closely] laid for me a snare;
4 I looked on my right hand, but none
To know [and help] me did appear.
All humane refuge failed me,
None for my [trembling] soul did care;
5 But then I cried to the Lord,
That he my [humble] suit would hear.
I said, Lord, thou my refuge art,
The portion of my [hope and] choice;
While I am in the land of life,
Where living men in thee rejoice.
6 I am brought very low on earth,
[O Lord] attend unto my cry;
Me from my persecutors save,
Who stronger are [by far] than I.
7 And out of prison bring my soul,
Thy [blessed] name to magnify;
The just shall flock to me, because
[With me] thou dealest bounteously.
PSALM CXLIII.
1 LOrd hear my Prayer, and unto
My [humble] suit attentive be;
Thy justice and thy faithfulness
[Do thou] employ to answer me.
2 Thy sinful servant bring not thou
In- [to strict] judgment to be tried;
For so no living man can stand
Before thee [clear and] justified.
3 The enemy does hunt my soul,
My life to ground [cast down] does tread;
In darkness he has made me dwell,
Like those that have [some time] been dead.
4 Therefore my spirit's overwhelmed,
My heart [in me] is desolate;
5 Yet I think on the days of old,
Thy [ancient] works I meditate
I muse on all thy handy works,
To thee I stretch my [craving] hands;
6 My humbled soul thirsts after thee,
As do [for rain] the thirsty lands.
7 Hear me with speed, my spirit fails,
Lord, do not hide [from me] thy face,
Lest I untimely, as the dead,
Go to the [dreaded] burying-place.
8 O let me with the morning light
Thy loving kindness [hear and] see;
For in my lowest state I place
My confidence [alone] in thee.
The way which thou would have me go,
[Clearly] do thou make known to me;
For I for thy conduct and help
Lift up my [craving] soul to thee.
9 Lord save me from mine enemies,
[For still] with thee my self I hide;
10 Teach me to do thy holy will,
Thou art my God and [surest] guide.
Thy spirit and his work is good,
[Safely] lead thou my soul in peace
(Through this false wicked world) into
The land of [truth and] uprightness.
11 Revive and quicken me, O Lord,
For thy great [name and] mercies sake*
And for thy truth and righteousness,
My [humbled] soul from trouble take.
12 And of thy mercy let those foes
[Cut off] subdued and humbled be,
Who do afflict and persecute
[Me and] thy flock for serving thee.
PSALM CXLIV.
1 FOr ever blessed be the Lord,
He is my [only] Rock and might;
Which taught my hands the skill of war,
And [taught my] fingers how to fight.
2 My Goodness, Fortress, my high Tower,
[My] Savior and [my[ shield is he;
In whom I trust, who does subdue
My [foes and] people under me.
3 Lord, what is man, that thou of him
Do so much [mindful] notice take?
Or what is the son of man, that thou
Of him [so much] account do make?
4 Man is like vanity; his days
Away like [passing] shadows fly.
5 Lord, bow the heavens, come down and show
To man thy [awful] Majesty.
The mountains touch, and they will smoke,
6 Cast forth thy [frightful] Lightening;
Scatter them, shoot thine arrows out,
Them to [deserv'd] destruction bring.
7 Send from above thy powerful hand,
[Do thou] rid and deliver me;
From waters great, and from the hands
Of [envious] strangers set me free.
8 Such whose deceitful mouth does speak
[Hurtful] untruth and vanity;
And their right hand does execute
Falsehood and [cruel] treachery.
9 A new song I to thee will sing,
Lord, on the [pleasant] Psaltery;
On a ten-stringed instrument
I will sing [joyful] praise to thee.
10 It Is he that Victory to Kings,
And their [desir'd] salvation sends;
His servant David he preserves,
And from the [hurtful) sword defends.
11 Save me from wicked strangers hands,
Whose [faithless] mouth speaks vanity;
And their right hand does execute
Falsehood and [their own] treachery.
12 That grown up in their youth like plants
Sons be [that are] unto us born;
Our daughters like to polished stones,
[May be] that Palaces adorn.
13 That to afford all kind of store,
Our garners may be [alway] filled;
That thousands, and ten thousands more
Sheep in our streets [increas'd] store yield.
14 That strong our Oxen be to work,
That [on us] no Invasion come;
No flying out, that in our streets
[With us] be no complaining moan.
15 Those are a happy people here,
[Who are] in such a case as this;
Happy indeed those people are
Whose God [our great] Jehovah is.
PSALM CXLV.
1 MY God and King, I Will thee extol,
And bless thy [holy] name always:
2 I Will magnify thee every day,
And thy name [will for] ever praise.
3 Great is the Lord, and greatest praise
Is due [from all] to him alone;
His greatness is unsearchable,
And to [us] men [but] little known.
4 One age of mortals shall transmit
His praise to that [which next] succeeds;
They shall declare thy famous works,
And celebrate thy [mighty] deeds.
5 The glory of thy Majesty
And honor I will [daily] speak;
And of thy great and wondrous works
My tongue shall frequent mention make.
6 It shall be men's delight to tell
How [great and] dreadful thy works are;
And my employment it shall be
Thy [boundless] greatness to declare.
7 The mention of thy goodness great
Shall [largely] exercise their tongues;
Thy Truth and Righteousness shall be
The matter of their [daily] songs.
8 The Lord is very gracious,
[Tender] compassions in him flow;
His mercy is exceeding great,
He Is unto anger [very] slow.
9 That unto all the Lord is good,
His [common] mercies do declare;
And over all his other works
His [great and] tender mercies are.
10 Lord, all thy works show forth thy praise,
Thy Saints thy [holy] name shall bless;
11 Thy Kingdom's glory they shall speak,
Their tongues [shall] thy [great] power express.
12 To make known to the sons of men
His [many] strange and mighty deeds;
And that in glorious Majesty
His Kingdom [all our] praise exceeds.
13 Thy Kingdom everlasting is,
A Kingdom firm [unchang'd] and sure;
Thine absolute Dominion
Does through each age [the same] endure.
14 The Lord of mercy them upholds,
Who [sink and] fall into distress;
And rises those that are cast down,
And does their wrongs [and griefs] redress.
15 The eyes of all do wait on thee,
Thy [bounteous] hand does them relieve;
And unto all sufficient food
In [time and] measure thou do give.
16 Thou openest thy liberal hand,
To [maintain] all enough it gives;
To satisfy the just desire
Of every thing [by food] that lives.
17 The Lord is just in all his ways,
Holy in all [the works] he does;
18 He Is nigh to all that call on him,
That [humbly] call on him in truth.
19 He will fulfill the just desire
Of those who do him [fear and] serve;
He Will hear their cry in their distress,
And them from [threatned] hurt preserve.
20 The God of Love will safely keep
All those that do him [truly] love;
But all the hateful wicked race
[Dreadful] destruction shall remove.
21 With thankful heart my mouth shall speak
The praises of the [glorious] Lord;
And let all flesh from age to age,
To bless his [holy] name accord.
PSALM CXLVI.
1 PRaise ye the Lord most high,
My soul speak thou his praise;
I Will praise him constantly,
And bless him all my days.
2 Even whilst I live,
And being have, God who this gave,
I Will praises give.
3 In Princes put no trust,
Nor any son of man;
Impotent and unjust,
None of them help us can.
4 He life resigns,
Returns to dust, And then he must
Cease his designs.
5 He is the happy man,
Whom God does help afford;
Who own and trust God can,
Whose hope is in the Lord.
6 Who all things made,
Heaven, Earth, and Sea, His truth and they
Do never fade.
7 God food to the hungry gives,
Judgment does execute;
The oppressed loose, and relieves
Prisoners and destitute.
8 To blind gives sight,
Dejected men, He raises them,
Loves the upright.
9 God strangers does defend,
Orphans and widows knows;
Ways which to mischief tend,
Utterly overthrows.
10 God King shall be;
Sion's God shall Still reign over all.
The Lord praise ye.
PSALM CXLVII.
1 PRaise ye the Lord, for it is good
Praise to our [glorious] God to sing;
It is a sweet and pleasant work,
And praise [to God] a comely thing.
2 God builds his Jerusalem,
Where he as God is [truly] known;
He the dispersed of Israel,
[In time] does gather into one.
3 The brokenhearted he does heal,
Their wounds up he does [gently] bind:
4 He tells the number of the stars,
Calls all things by their [names and] kind.
5 Great is our God, and of great power,
His knowledge has no [end or] bound:
6 The meek he lifts up, but casts
The [proud and] wicked to the ground.
7 Sing forth the praises of the Lord
With thankful heart and [chearful] tongue;
Let Harp and pleasant melody
Be joined with your [praising] song.
8 He covers the heavens with clouds,
[And] for [the] earth prepares rain;
The barren mountains does refresh,
That grass [on them] may grow again.
9 He gives the beasts their food, and feeds
Young Ravens, which [for food] do cry;
10 His pleasure not in horses strength,
Nor in [the strong] man's legs do lie.
11 But in all those who do him fear,
The Lord [himself] does pleasure take;
And those that in his mercy hope,
His [love] and grace will not forsake.
12 Jerusalem shall praise the Lord,
Sion, thy God [with praise] confess;
13 Thy bars and gates he strengthens,
Thy Children [in thee] he does bless.
14 Thy borders he with peace does bless,
And fills thee with Wheat's [finest] flower;
15 His word goes forth through all the earth,
And [swiftly] prospers by his power.
16 Hoar frost like ashes scatters he,
[On earth] like wool he snow does give:
17 Like morsels he casts forth his ice,
Who in his [extream] cold can live?
18 He sends out his word of power,
And [quickly] melts them again;
He makes his wind to blow, and then
The waters flow with [plenteous] rain.
19 The Doctrine of his Holy Word
To Jacob he does [clearly] show;
His statutes and his judgments he
Makes [his own] Israel to know.
20 He with no nation thus has dealt,
His judgments and his [holy] word
To none of them are thus made known;
Ye therefore praise the [glorious] Lord.
PSALM CXLVIII.
1 PRaise ye our glorious Lord,
Who dwells in heaven on high;
Let him be still adored
Above the starry sky.
2 Ye Angels bright,
And all his host, Throughout heavens coasts
In praise delight.
3 Praise him both Sun and Moon,
And every shining Star;
4 Ye Heavens which are his Throne,
His glorious praise declare.
His praise forth show,
Ye waters high, In clouds that fly,
And fall below.
5 Let all these praise the Lord,
And magnify his name;
He did but speak* the word,
And thereby all things frame.
He placed them fast,
6 By his decree They fixed be,
And ever lasts.
7 Praise God on earth below
Ye Dragons and all deeps,
8 Fire, hail, clouds, wind, and snow,
Which in command he keeps.
9 Mountain and hill,
Fruitful trees all, And Cedars tall,
Praise ye him still.
10 All beasts, both wild and tame,
And every creeping thing,
Praise ye God's glorious name,
And every bird of wing.
All men on earth,
11 Kings and Judges, Greatest Princes
Of highest birth.
12 Young men and maidens all,
Praise ye the Lord's great name;
Old men and children small,
Let all his praise proclaim.
Over all the world
13 God's Name alone, And Glory known,
Shall be extolled.
14 His people he will raise,
And them exalt on high,
All his Saints shall him praise
And bless continually.
He is adored
By Israel, Who near him dwell:
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXLIX.
1 PRaise ye the Lord, and sing
A new rejoicing song;
Praise ye our glorious King
His holy ones among.
Where they do meet
In holy throngs, To sing these songs
Sacred and sweet.
2 Let Israel rejoice
In him that did them make;
With cheerful heart and voice
Let Sion's sons partake.
And to their King,
Who them directs, And still protects,
This offering bring.
3 And let them praise his name
With dances grave and meet;
Yea, let them praise the same
With Harp and Music sweet.
For the upright,
4 His people true, Whom he fore-knew,
Are his delight.
With his salvation he
The meek will beautify:
5 Let them all joyful be
In his and their Glory.
To their great King,
Their resting head, Shall on their bed
His praises sing.
6 Let the high praise of God
Be ever in their mouth;
And let them wield abroad
The two-edg'd-sword (with truth.)
7 On heathens all,
And wicked men, God's Judgments then
Shall surely fall.
8 With chains to bind their Kings,
Their Lords with iron bands;
9 To execute the things
On them which God commands.
God by his Word,
This honor grants To all his Saints.
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CL.
1 PRaise God: Prise him where faithful men
Do in his holy place draw near.
Praise him in the high firmament,
Where his great power does appear.
2 Praise him for all his mighty acts,
Their glory in his praises tell;
His Greatness and Perfection praise,
Which does all creatures reach excel.
3 With Trumpets and shrill Cornet's noise,
Sound forth his glorious praise on high;
Praise him with the melodious harp,
And with the pleasant Psaltery.
4 Praise him with Timbrel and with Flute,
With Organs and string'd Harpsicals,
(With joyful and well-tuned hearts)
5 Praise him upon the loud Cymbals.
On the loud Cymbals praise ye him:
6 Let every living thing accord
That breath enjoys, to give God praise.
All join to praise our glorious Lord.
Chap. 3. Lamentations,
1 I Am the miserable man,
Selected by my [righteous] God
To see days of calamity,
And feel his [wrath and] chastening Rod.
2 He has me led and brought into
The [dismal] darkness of the night;
He does deny my grieved soul
The comforts of the [pleasant] light.
3 Surely against me he is turned,
[All day] his hand wrings out my groans;
4 My wasted flesh, my skin made old,
By [tiring] pain he breaks my bones.
5 His batteries he against me built,
With [gall and] travel compassed me;
6 In darkness he has shut me up,
Like those that [dead and] buried be.
7 His chastening hand does hedge me in,
And my escape [by flight] restrains;
My feeble flesh, and galled limbs
He fetters with his [heavy] chains.
8 And when thus pressed with pain and grief,
To him I [daily] cry and shout,
He seems to turn away his ear,
And shut my [fervent] prayer out.
9 With hewn stone he has me enclosed,
Led me [into] a crooked way;
10 And he has used me in his wrath
As [Bears and] Lions do their prey.
11 He turned me from the pleasant way,
[Tore me] and made me desolate:
12 He bends his bow, makes me the mark
Which [piercing] arrows level at.
13 The shafts which from his quiver come,
Enter [into] and pierce my reins;
14 I daily am the peoples song
Which me with [mocks and] scorn disdains.
15 With bitterness he filled me,
With wormwood [he hath] made me drunk;
16 With gravel-stones he brake my teeth,
My flesh's in ashes [roll'd and] shrunk.
17 Thou set'st my soul so far from peace,
That I [almost] all good forgot;
18 I said, My strength and hope in God
Has [fail'd and] left me desolate.
19 But my affliction's not forgot,
The [bitter] wormwood and the gall;
20 My soul does still remember these,
And's humbled [in me] under all.
The Second Part.
21 Yet this considered, stays my grief;
It Is mercy that we [yet do] live,
22 And that we are not all consumed;
But God does [Hope and] Being give.
23 Mercies are every morning new,
God's [love and] faithfulness is great.
24 The Lord's my portion, says my soul,
[Therefore] my hope on him is set.
25 Surely to all that wait for him,
The Lord is [ever] good and kind;
The soul that truly seeks him,
[At last] shall his compassion find.
26 It is man's only way to good,
Whatever be his [grief and] straight;
For the salvation of the Lord,
In [hope and] quietness to wait.
27 Surely it is for man's own good,
In youth to bear the [taming] yoke;
28 He sits alone, and silence keeps,
Instructed by God's [teaching] stroke.
29 His mouth he puts in the dust,
Submits to [any] terms of hope:
30 He gives his cheeks to him that smites,
With [lying] railers will not cope.
31 God will not ever cast us off,
Nor from his [chosen] people go;
32 Though he cause grief, his mercies great
[In time] will his compassion show.
33 He does not willingly afflict,
[Nor love] the sons of men to grieve;
34 To crush earth's prisoners under feet,
Whom mercy [rather] would relieve.
35 That Judges should deny men right,
In men [of power] God does not love:
36 To subvert just men in their cause,
The [righteous] Lord does not approve.
The Third Part.
37 Whose word can stand, when God gain-says?
Who can overthrow his [potent] will?
38 The good or ill that us befalls,
His [word and] counsel do fulfill.
39 Why should a man, chastis'd for sin,
Who Is yet alive [grudge and] complain?
40 It Is better search and try our ways,
[Repent] and turn to God again.
41 O let us lift up hearts and hands,
For help [and hope] to God in heaven;
42 We all have sinned and rebelled,
And thou [our sin] have not forgiven.
43 From us poor persecuted men
[With wrath] thou coverest thy face;
Thy just displeasure has us slain,
Not pitying our [doleful] case.
44 Covered thou art from our access,
Enclosed in a [darksome] cloud,
Which prayers do not penetrate,
Though suffering make them [long and] loud.
45 Among the people we are made
The [refuse] scorn and offscouring:
46 Our enemies mouths wide opened are,
Thy flock's [to them] a scorned thing.
47 Fear and a snare on us are come,
[Anguish] and ruin is our state;
48 Mine eyes with streaming tears bemoan.
Thy [broken] flock that is desolate.
49 My heart still feeds my trickling eyes,
My [grief and] weeping cease not;
50 Till God in mercy look from heaven
On those that [now do] seem forgot.
51 Mine eye affects my soul with grief,
To see my City's [woful] case;
52 Mine enemies hunt me causelessly,
As Fowler's [harmless] birds do chase.
53 To prison they condemned me,
And shut me up [sentenc'd] for death;
54 The waters overflowed my head,
Seeming to stop my [vital] breath.
The Fourth Part.
55 I called on thy name, O Lord,
In [the low] dungeon like to die;
56 Thou heard'st my voice, hide not thine ear
Now from my [doleful] sighs and cry.
57 In that day when I called on thee,
To [succour] me thou did draw near;
Encouraging my fainting soul,
Thou [kindly] bidst me, Do not fear.
58 Thou, Lord, against oppressing men
Did undertake [and plead] my cause;
Thou have redeemed my threatened life
From [wicked] men's devouring jaws.
59 O Lord, thou have seen all my wrong,
Judge thou [my cause] whose word I speak;
60 Their plots and vengeance thou have seen
Me and thy [righteous] Laws to break.
61 Lord, thou their false reproach have heard,
The plots which they [for me] did lay;
62 The words of those that me accused,
[Their plots] against me all the day.
63 When to their ease, their feasts, their play,
In [pride and] pleasure they refort,
Thou see (though they fear not thee)
I am their [musick] scorn and sport.
64 Render to them a recompense
According to their [unjust] deed;
65 Through thy just curse, upon their hearts
Let [deserv'd] grief and sorrow feed.
66 Persecute thou these men in wrath,
Who persecute [me and] thy word;
Destroy them, let them not abide
Under thy Heavens, O [righteous] Lord.
Gospel-Hymns.
Zachary's Song, Luke 1.68.
Blessed be the Lord, even Israel's God,
For he has visited his flock,
And them redeemed; and raised up
A Savior out of David's stock.
As by his holy Prophets mouths
He our Redemption had foretold;
Who ever since the world began
Were sent unto his Church of old.
That by him we should saved be
From our destructive enemies all;
And of all them that do us hate,
Be saved from the servile thrall.
Thus the great mercies to perform,
Which to our fathers promised were;
His holy Covenant to make good,
The Oath which he to Abraham swear.
That this deliverance he would grant
To us, that now enthralled are;
That saved from our enemies hands,
We may serve him without their fear.
In holiness and righteousness,
Even all the days that we shall live;
And thou the Prophet shall be called,
Which the most High to us does give.
For thou his ways for to prepare,
Shall go before the Lord's own face;
To call his people to repent,
And make them know his saving grace.
For the remission of their sin,
Through the great mercy of our God;
Whereby the dayspring from on high
With us does take up his abode.
To give his saving light to them
Who sit enthralled in darkness,
And in death's shadow: And to guide
Our feet into the way of Peace.
Mary's Song, Luke 1.46.
MY soul does magnify the Lord,
My spirit [in me] does rejoice
In God, who is my Savior,
Expressed by this my [thankful] voice.
For greatly he regarded has
His handmaid's [mean and] low estate;
Henceforth all ages shall my name
As [great and] blessed celebrate.
For he who the Almighty is,
Great things [indeed] has to me done;
Holy's his Name, his mercy is
To them that fear him [largely] shown,
He with his arm has showed strength,
He them that [great] and mighty be
Has put down, and exalted them
Who are of [mean and] low degree.
The poor and hungry he has filled
With what for them is [truly] good,
And the rich he has sent away
Empty, through want of [needful] food.
His servant Israel he has helped,
For his own [ancient] mercies (...);
As to our fathers, to Abraham,
And to his seed [of old] he spoke.
Simeon's Song, Luke 2.29.
LOrd, let thy servant now
In peace to thee depart,
According to the gracious word
Of thee who faithful art.
For him mine eyes have seen,
Who brings thy saving grace;
Which thou prepared have to show
Before all peoples face.
To the Gentiles a Light
Them to illuminate;
And to thy people Israel,
The glory of their state.
The Angels Doxologie, Luke 2.14.
GLory be to the glorious God,
Whose [dwelling's] in the heavens high;
Let Peace abound on earth below,
To men [Divine] benignity.
Or,
Glory be to our glorious God,
Whose [dwelling's] in the highest heaven;
Let Peace come down on earth below,
[Love and] good will to men be given.
Or,
Glory to the Eternal God
In heaven [which is] his glorious place;
Let Peace on earth make her abode,
Let men receive his [love and] grace.

1 MOst Glorious God, we here present
Our joyful praise to thee;
The only God, the Lord of all,
Confessing thee to be.
2 The eternal Father, Lord of all,
Thy works do thee proclaim,
For all are made to honor thee,
And glorify thy name.
3 Thee the blessed Angels magnify,
The Heavens and Powers thee praise;
Cherubs and all the glorious spirits
Do cry to thee always
4 Most Holy, Holy, Holy God,
The universal Lord,
Thy present glorious Majesty
Fills heaven and all the world.
5 The glorified Apostles there
Praise thee continually;
With them the blessed Prophets join
Thy name to magnify.
6 There are the Martyrs noble hosts
Employed in thy praise;
Thy holy Church in heaven and earth
Acknowledge thee always.
7 Father in greatness infinite,
Thy One, True, Glorious Son;
The Holy Ghost the Comforter,
Christ's Advocate with Man.
8 O Christ, thou art of Glory King,
And thee we all confess
The Father's everlasting Son,
His Image most express.
9 When to save lost and sinful man,
Man's Nature thou would choose,
To take flesh in a Virgin's womb
Thy love did not refuse.
10 When thou for sinners suffered'st death,
Conquered'st and rose again,
Heaven's Kingdom thou did open set
To all true faithful men.
11 Into the heaven's ascended, now
Thou sit'st at God's right hand,
And in the Father's Glory do
Both Heaven and Earth command.
12 With all the faithful we believe
Thou will in Glory come
To be our Judge, and on all men
To pass the final doom.
13 Now therefore help thy servants, Lord,
Whom thou redeemed have
So dearly with thy precious blood,
And let them not be lost.
14 O let us with the blessed Saints
In Glory numbered be;
And with them everlastingly
Sing praises unto thee.
15 Save thou thy chosen people, Lord,
Bless thine inheritance;
Rule and preserve them, and with thee
In glory them advance.
16 It is our daily sacred work
Thy Name to glorify;
World without end we would thee praise
And ever magnify.
17 Vouchsafe us, Lord, thy grace this day
Our souls from sin to save;
Have mercy on us, sinners, Lord,
It Is mercy which we crave.
18 Lord, let thy mercy fall on us,
In it confide we must;
Lord, let not me confounded be,
For in thee do I trust.

Directions for the Use and Tuning of the Psalms, etc.
I. THese Psalms are set to the commonest Measures and Tunes of the Old Meter
of the Psalms. Psalm. 84.117.119. Te Deum.

II. To The Tune of the Old 100 Psalm, or the Old 51, are
1.18.78.89.100.106.107.109.114.135.150.57.69.88.

Note, That the Tune of the Old 51st. best agreeeth with the sadder sort of
Psalms; and the Tune of the Old 100. with the laudatory Psalms.

III. To the Tune of the Old 25, are set Psalm. 3.15.20, 21, 22.24,
25.28.43.50.56.59.61.65.67.70.83.85, 86, 87.100.110.123.136.141.

IV. To the Tune of the Old 148, are set these laudatory Psalms,
47.98.136.146.148, 149. and the Benedicite, etc.

V. All the rest are set to the longer and shorter Measures and Tunes
indifferently: That is, If you leave out the words written in a different
Character, they are fitted to any of the commonest shorter Tunes (which are
very many:) But if you take in the words of different Character, they are
fitted to the longer Tunes, of the Old 51st. or 100th. As for instance, Psalm 2.

Why do the Rebel-Nations rage,
And [People] hatch a vain design?
The Kings of earth do set themselves,
And [wicked] Rulers do combine.
But if you leave out the words of a different Character in Crotchets thus []
then you may use any of the Common Tunes. As for Instance of the same Psalm.

Why do the Rebel-Nations rage,
And hatch a vain design?
The Kings of earth do set themselves,
And Rulers do combine.
The reason why I so-ordered them, is, 1. Because Nature, weary of the same, is
recreated with variety of Tunes: And some are more for one, and some for
another. 2. Because when brevity causes obscurity, the additional words are
seen by them that use the Books, as explicatory of the rest, when they be not
spoken: And the great difference of the Letters makes it no stop to the
Readers. Though this was never done by any other that I know of, and though it
sometime make the Verse more rough, I hope the benefit will compensate all this.

Note, That some few select Psalms, most fitted to men's ordinary state,
Humbling, Deprecatory, Supplicatory, or Gratulatory and Laudatory, should by
most be learnt without Book, to be ready night and day, as various Occasions
make them useful.

And times of Calamity, Danger, Oppression, and Persecution, will render men
capable of a sensible understanding of the greatest part of the Psalms,
otherwise hardly understood; which aggravate the furious Rage, Malignity,
Violence, Bloodiness, and Diabolical Nature, Designs, and Attempts of the
wicked enemies of Truth, Piety, and Holy Peace* and teach us to fly to God only
for help from these wicked and unreasonable men.

And it will thereby confute our offense at David's so much aggravating his and
the Churches Enemies wickedness and bloody cruelty; If we consider that it is
not their eternal damnation that he prays for, but public Justice by God,
the universal Sovereign, who has made Justice a necessary part of Government,
Divine and Humane, and the ordinary means of repressing Wickedness, encouraging
Obedience, and protecting and delivering the Church and State.

FINIS.
