HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Queen.
WHereas an untrue and flaunderous report has of late been raised by some
evil disposed and malicious Persons against the Lord Mayor of this City, as
if by his means the price of grain that began to fall should be enhaunced
to an higher rate, which untrue report that it might have some couller, it was
likewise given out that his Lordship had brought into the River of Thames from
beyond the Seas certain Corn, and to that end kept up the Market, that he
might sell his own Grain at an higher rate: Whereas it is found that he
never used that trade of buying Corn either within this Realm or without
(save only so much as might serve for provision of his own householde) but
contrariwise has endeavored to discharge his duty on that behalf by
providing of Grain to be brought hither out of Foreign parts, with as great
providence as any other of his Predicessors heretofore have done, whereby the
great numbers of poor people within this City have been sustained this time
of death: It has pleased the Queens most excellent Majesty being truly
informed of the great wrong done to his Lordship, by such an untrue and
slanderous report being her Highness Liestenant within this City, to give
order that public notice be made hereof in the open Markets, as well to
testify his Lordshippes innocence, as to make known to her loving subjects
how much her Highuesse is offended, and does mislike such false reports devised
by malicious Persons aganist such Magistrates as under her Highness are
appointed to supply the place of public government. Giving knowledge
withal, that if any Person shall hereafter be found to disperse this or any
other untrue report to the like effect, upon information and complaint made
to the Right Honorable the Lords and others of her Majesty's privy Council,
some severe punishment shall be inflicted upon such offenders, to the example
of all others, who for private malice and without just cause shall presume to
defame any public Person who shall be appointed under her Majesty for the
good government of her Highness people.

Queens most Excellent Majesty.
