The SCOOL-MASTER disciplined* OR, A Reply to a lying Paper, entitulled, The
gadding tribe reproved, etc.
WHereas there is a paper lately put forth, intitul'd, The gadding Tribe
reproved by the light of the Scriptures, by one who writes himself George
VVillington, Schoolmaster in the City of Bristol, whose book is very filly and
vain; but that sools love to be meddling: and in it there is much railing,
lying, and false accusing, against those people called by the scorners Quakers:
I shall say something as to it, for the truths sake, that the lies may rest upon
his own head, from whence they came: Whereas thou say, A word from the
Word, to the Serpent-generation called Quakers, especially to the conniving
seducer, John Andland* and the rest of his brethren in iniquity, who have of
late set forth a malicious Pamphlet against our godly Magistrates, and saithful
Ministers, entitled, The innocent delivered out of the snare, and the blind
guide sallen into the pit.

Reply, The innocent delivered out of the snare is not malicious, and in this
thou art a false accuser; and in saying I am a seducer, thou art a slanderer, I
charge thee to prove it, and in what, which thou have not yet done, though thou
rail upon me; and I did not write maliciously against any, much less against
Godly Magistrates, and faithful Ministers; but godly Magistrates I own, and
honor in the Lord, and faithful Ministers I have unity withal, and brethren in
iniquity is denied; thesefore thee I do deny, who a worker of iniquity art
found, and from the presence of the Lord shut among the serpent-generation, who
in scorn calls us Quakers; and the word is against thee, who art feeding upon
dust, and going upon thy belly, and the word of the Lord, even the word of
truth is against thee, who art an accuser of the brethren, and rewarded must
thou be according to thy deeds; and though thou have named that book, the
innocent delivered, yet let all take notice who reads thy filthy paper, that
thou have not answered any one thing there demanded, neither confuted any one
answer in that Book; so the snare remains broken, and the innocent is
delivered, and he that dug a pit into it himself falls, and the Scripturo is
fulfilled, they that help, and he that is helped, hoth falls together

And whereas thou s^ts down many Scriptures, as of blind guides, Serpents,
scribes, Pharisces, Hypocrites, whited Sepulchers, and writest, Ye serpents,
ye vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? ye are they that justify
your selves before men, but that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is an
abomination to the Lord.

Reply, In that which is an abomination to the Lord thou art, which is
eesteemed amongst men, and these Scriptures were spoken to thy Generation; and
upon thy own head they are returned, for we seek not the praise of men, neither
have we the praise of men, and therefore it is that the ^linde guides, Vipers,
Serpents gather themselves together against the truth, which hy the power of
God is now spreading a witness against all deceit, and deceivers.

Thou say thou writest directly to thee, John Audland, and usest these
words, thou hypocrite, why has satan filled thy heart to lie against the Holy
Ghost, why b^astest thou thy self in mischief, O mighty man! thy tongue
devises mischief like a sharp Rasor, thou love evil more then good; thou
love all devouring words: O thou deceitsul tongue! God shall destroy thee for
ever: And say Paul set his eyes on Elimas the sorcerer, and said (as I may
say to thee John Audland) O full of subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the
Devil; and say* repent of this thy wickedness, for I perceive thou art in
the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity, and many such words thou
writest.

Reply, Take it to thy self who art of the Generation to which it was spoken,
for home to thee do I return it, who art in the bitterness, and in the gall,
loving all devouring words, these things comes not near me, but over thy head
do I rejoice, the misery will fall upon thy self, and thy unclean* spirit the
Lord rebuke, a false accuser thou art, and a slanderer; I do not love evil more
than good, if I had, I should not have become thine enemy: neither am I the
gall of bitterness, or bond of iniquity, thou have uttered that which thou
know not, for if thou had known what this means (I will have mercy and not
sacrifice) thou would not have condemned the innocent.

And whereas thou say, judge not that thou he not judged, and judge nothing
before the time; and with what measure thou meetest, it shall be measured to
thee again, and writest against others for railing and judging.

Reply. Thou art inexcusable, who judge another and do the same thing, thy
mouth is full of railing, lying, false accusing, which proceeds out of the
abundance of thy heart, as in thy book appears, and out of thy own mouth thou
art condemned; and this I demand, whether calling others Serpents, Vipers, full
of all mischief, children of the devil, be not judging? and if this be not,
then show the difference between this and judging; thou have gone about to
confute that the Saints is not to judge, and that confutes thee, who yet knows
not a Saints life, and art so blind thou cannot behold that thou allows thy
self in the thing which thou condemns, and with what measure thou measurest,
it shall be measured to thee again; good weight shall thou receive from the hand
of the Lord, who art weighed, and found as chaff which the wind drives to and
fro.

In thy 7 page, thou beseeches all who shall read thy book, upon consideration
of the premises (which is these things before mentioned) to avoid, and abandon
the meetings, books, erroneous doctrines, and hellish blasphemies, of this new
upstart impious Generation.

Reply, All who knows the Lord, and reads thy book, will avoid thee and it, and
have no fellowship, with such unfruitful workers, and works of Darkness, thou
have forgotten judge not; and thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam, thy
envious Spirit which fomes like the sea, casting up filth, swells beyond its
bounds, but thou art limited, as all thy impious generation have been; and by
the power of the Lord are we preserved from thy errors, and hellish blasphemy;
and thy railing and slandering return upon thy felt, fruitless tree, upon which
no grapes is gathered,

Thou say, what Paul said to the Galatians, the same thou will say to the
giddy headed people of the Church of England.

Reply. The true Church is in God, builded upon the true rock, and is not
giddy-headded, here thou manifests the fruits of the Teachers, who so long has
taught, and had so much for teaching, and the Church of England yet
giddy-headded; but the Lord is coming to gather his people into the true Fold,
from the mouths of all Idol Shepherds, and to teach his people himself, that
they may be established in righteousness,

Thou say Paul taught the Romans, and in them us; first, that it is the
imputed Righteousness of Christ only, that makes us just in the sight of God.
Secondly, that our election is of Gods free Grace. Thirdly, that we are
justified only by faith in the sight of God, without good works: fourthly, that
the scriptures is of divine authority

Reply, Silence flesh before the Lord, upon the children of disobedience, shall
the wrath of God be revealed; own thy Portion what Paul said to such as thee,
thou must witness a change before that which Paul wrote to the Romans be to
thy condition; the Lord is our righteousness, and our justification, and by his
grace we are saved, who has elected us, and chosen us in Christ Jesus, who
has all power and authority committed unto him, and upon whose shoulders the
government is laid, but from thy earthly wisdom is the election and the faith
hid, who art without good works, and belyes the Apostle, and ignorant art of
the Letter which kills.

Fifthly, Thou say no man since the fall of Adam can perfectly fulfill the Law
of God in this Life, and therefore cannot merit, except it be wrath.

Reply. For meriting the wrath, its thy own, but Christ Jesus since the fall of
Adam has perfectly fulfilled the Law of God, and there is Salvation in no
other, and the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after
the flesh but after the spirit, but by the works of the Law no flesh shall be
justified for the Commandment which was ordained unto life, wrought death, if
thou can hear thou may.

In thy sixth and seventh thou say, that he that has received a Ministry
should wait on his Ministry, and take heed to fulfill it, and that every soul
must be subject to the higher power, and yield obedience to every Ordinance of
theirs, if not contrary to Gods word. Reply. Thou slanders us, and rails upon
us who has received a Ministry from God, and waits to fulfill it, and thou
receives such as come in their own name, who are made by the will of man, and
against such do we bear witness by the power of God, unto which our souls is
subject for conscience sake, and to every ordinance for the Lords sake, which
is not contrary to Gods word. Thou say thou art afraid that the Lord has a
controversy with the Church of England.

Reply, Fearfulness surprizeth the heart of the hypocrite, and a controversy
has the Lord with you, because of your iniquities; misery is coming upon you
fearful ones, and unbelievers, who are no Church of Christ, but a Synagogue of
Satan, who say, they are Jews and are not, but are a giddy-headed Church, as
thou confessest.

Thou say, Make not the light within a rule to walk by, and yet says,
sollow the light within, and teacher within; what else?

Reply, The light discovers thee to be in confusion, they that walk in the
light stumbles not, and they who love the Light bring their deeds to it, and
believes in the light; but their deeds are evil who have it, and walk not in
it, and there is thy condemnation.

Thou say, He that enters not in by the door, (to wit, a true and lawful
call) but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber, and
such are the quakers; but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the
Sheep, and such are your ancient Divine^.

Reply, Here thou (as in other places) art a false accuser, and a perverter of
the Scriptures, your Divines is not the Shepherd, there thou art a blasphemer,
who would set up fal^e Christ's; the true Shepherd laid down his life for the
sheep, and he is the door, and them whom thou slanderest, enters in at the door
where no thief, nor no diviner can enter, nor no hireling, which the true
Shepherd cried against.

And as thou say, Thou will speak something to our principles; first, for
judging.

Reply, Thou have judged us to be deceivers and seducers, and false accusations
against the truth thou have brought, and against some in particular, naming,
that John Audland was a child of the Devil, and yet thou have confessed thou
never saw me, nor heard me, but thou have not proved wherein, which I charge
thee to do publicly, or own thy condemnation for thy slandring, lying, and
backbiting, thy laying that it is so, does not make it to be so, and that which
thou calls a confutation, confutes thyself, but proves nothing against the
Saints judging them whom they saw and discerned to be unlearned* for when an
unbeliever came in, or one that was unlearned, he was judged of all, and the
thoughts of his heart made manifest, and this honor have all the Saints, to
bind Kings in chains, and to execute upon the heathen all the judgments
written* and the Scripture we own, and the Saints life, by which thou art
judged, and with the light condemned, who judge and acts against the Saints
with that mind that is for judgment.

The second is, that they are not true Ministers, which are called by man's
Ministry, or by a mediate call from man, and this thou go about to confute,
by saying that Christ ordained apostles and disciples: And the Holy Ghost said,
Separate me Barnabas, and Saul, for the work of the Ministry, and that there
was Elders ordained in the Church and the like.

Reply. These things proves nothing to thy mediate call, or man's Ministry;
Christ is not born by the will of man, and holy men spoke as they were moved by
the Holy Ghost, and no prophecy came by the will of man; Paul a Minister and
Apostle, not by the will of man; and that which is highly esteemed amongst men
is abomination in the sight of God: and there is thy mediate call, and man's
ministry, which the Scriptures speaks not of; what Christ did, and the Saints
did, was by the power of God, and the Holy Ghost spoke to them, no voice of
that is heard in thy mediate call, or man's ministry, therefore denied by them
who are guided by the Spirit o^ the Lord, who receives not the ministry of man,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and that is not man's ministry.

The third is, that we are to salute no man.

Reply. This is thy own, and in thy confutation thou answerest thy self; for
the Saints Salvation we own, and honors all men in the Lord, which is more than
the heathen do; but we have learned not to fashion our selves according to the
world, and to deny the customs of the heathen and their flattering titles, and
vain fashions, which is without the fear of God, who have men's persons in
admiration because of advantage, and respects men's persons, and commits sin;
and a difference do we put betwixt the Saints salvation, and the vain fashions
and customs of the heathen, which Israel was not to observe.

The fourth is, that the Scripture ought not to be expounded, and that
expounding of Scripture is an adding to Scripture, and if we add, then God will
add to us all the plagues that are written therein, and in thy confutation,
says, Christ expounded Scriptures.

Reply. He that adds, the plagues is to be added to him, as it is written; but
thy other words is false, and thy own, it is your own imagination of the
Scripture which we deny, wresting it as thou have done, and adding with thy
Envious spirit against the truth; but that Christ expounded the Scriptures was
never denied by us; and that he opened their understandings to understand the
Scriptures, we own and witness; and the Spirit of Christ is one in all his
Saints; and for the ly let it return upon thy own head.

Thy Fifth is, that it is not lawful to use the title of Master to any, and in
thy confutation thou says, Christ was called Master; and where it is said, Be
ye not called Master, for one is your Master even Christ, thou say, the
meaning is not that it is unlawful to be called Master.

Reply, thou shows thy self to be none of Christ's servant, who pleads against
his command, and says, he bad them avoid a thing which was not unlawful, if it
be not unlawful, its lawful; thou have forgotten now to make Scripture thy
rule, as for Christ being called Master, he was and is so, and whom he made
Ministers, he made them not Masters, for they had one Master, and him we own to
be master; and in this thou art a Liar, and of the Devil, who says, we say it
is not lawful to use the title of Master to any; and we likewise say, and
exhort thereto, that servants should be obedient to their own Masters, not as
men-pleasers with eye-service, but serving the Lord.

Thy sixth is, that Infant Baptism is no Ordinance of Christ, and therefore of
no use in the Church of God; and thou says, an express command thou grants is
not to be found; but thou says infants were circumcised, and Baptism is
ordained in the room of that.

Reply. We deny it to be an Ordinance of Christ, or that it came in the room
of Circumcision; the Scripture speaks of no such thing as Infant Baptism, and
til thou prove it came in the room of Circumcision, thy saying proves nothing:
the male-children were circumcised, in room of what came in your female
children to be sprinkled? thou speaks thou knows not what, he is a Jew who is
one inwardly, and Baptism is by the spirit, and circumcision is that of the
heart, he that is in Christ is a new creature, born again of water, and not of
the spirit, such are partakers of the Ordinance, and are members of the Church,
and that which is no Ordinance of Christ is of no use in the Church of God, but
is by the children of light denied.

Thy seventh head is, That we say, that the Lords supper is of no use in the
Church of God, since the resurrection of Christ.

Reply. This is an absolute lie, never spoken or owned by us; I charge thee to
prove it either by our words, or writings, or let shame cover thy lips, liar
for the lake, and own thy condemnation for thy slandring, lying, and false
accusing:

Thou says, it was not thy purpose to have writ a treatise of this subject
till of late, finding that none answered the book before mentioned.

Reply. Thy treatise is lies and railing language against the servants of God,
but the book is yet unanswered; thy filthy, silly, lying paper is not taken for
an answer to that book; and of late thou beginnest to vent out thy mischief and
thy ignorance, old rotten dull stuff, it is like the evil treasure it proceeded
from, and they who reads thy paper, whose understanding is opened, will discern
thy ignorance and malice, and deny thy unclean spirit, for among the children
of light thy unfruitful works of darkness is denied and cast out, and thy
formed weapon cannot prosper; but the Lord will wound the head of the wicked,
he will bruise thee as with a rod of Iron, and dash thee in pieces like a
potters vessel: this is answered, not because it was particularly against me,
but for the truths sake, that the lies which he had raised against it, may
return upon his own head.

An answer to a Scandalous Paper, Entitu^ed, The quakers unmasked Put sorth by
William Prynne, wherein his slanders are made to appear, and he is found with a
lie in his mouth.
I Meeting with a Paper, Entitled, The quakers unmasked and clearly Detected:
Put sorth by William Prynne, wherein he slanders and falsely accuses those
people scornfully called quakers, and says they are sent from Rome to seduce
the intoxicated, giddy headded English Nation; his ground being an information
(he says) taken upon oath in the City of Bristol, which he sets down, as
follows; The Information of George Cowlishaw of the City of Bristol
aforesaid, Iron-monger, taken the two and twentieth day of January, 1654. who
informs upon his oath, that in the Month of September last, this Informant
had some discourse in Bristol, with one he calls Mr. Coppinger an Irish man,
formerly a School-fellow of his, that came thither purposely for his passage
into Ireland, who told this Informant that he had lived in Rome and Italy eight
or nine years, and had taken upon him the order of a Friar of the Franciscan
Company; and he told this Informant that he had been at London lately, for some
months, and whilst he was there he had been at all the Churches and meetings
public and private that he could hear of, and that none came so near him as
the quakers, and being at a meeting of the quakers, he there met with two of
his acquaintance in Rome, the which two persons were of the same Franciscan
order and company that were now become chief Speakers amongst the quakers; and
he himself had spoken amongst the quakers in London, about thirty times and was
well approved of amongst them; and this Informant further says, that the said
Coppinger asked him what kinds of Opinions in Religion there was in Bristol,
and this Informant told him that there were several opinions and judgments,
and not naming any Opinions of the quakers; the said Coppinger asked him
whether there had been any quakers in Bristol; and the said Informant answered
him no; whereupon the said Coppinger told him (the said Informant) two or three
times, that if he did love his religion and his soul, he should not hear them,
whereupon this informant told him that he thought none of them would come to
Bristol, who expressly replied that if this Informant would give him five pound,
he would make it five hundred pounds if some quakers did not come to Bristol
within three weeks or a month then following; and on the morrow following, the
said Coppinger departed from this Cifor Ireland, his Native place, and about
eighteen days after, there came to this City two persons, that bare the name
of quakers: This is a true Copy of the information taken upon oath at Bristol.

This Being the ground of that scandalous Paper, put forth by thee William
Prynne, to it I shall answer, and clearly make appear, that these scandalls are
false and sul of confusion: First, that they are false, it will appear two of us
(whom the World reproachfully calls quakers, came from the North (being moved
of the Lord to come to the City of Bristol) our both and being according to
the flesh, was in VVestmoreland, not far from Kendal, and there at this
present, is our outward habitations and families: we came from thence in the
Month called June, and we came into the City of Bristoll the 12. day of the
month, called July, and on the morrow (being the 13* day) we were at two
meetings, the one was with the people called Anabaptists, the other with the
people called Independants, and we were moved by the Lord to speak at both
their meetings, which we did, and this was the thirteenth day of the month,
called July, which was a little before the Fair at Bristol, called Iames-Fat^e,
as several of those people can bear witness. Then further thou says, it being
in September, George Cowlishaw, being asked by the said Coppinger, if there had
been none of those people called quakers at Bristol, he answered no: now this
is false, some of us (who is so called) was then at Bristol, and here I shall
take many people to witness against thee, for we had meetings then in Bristol,
the tenth day of the month called September, we had a meeting at the Fort, the
thirteenth day of the same month, a meeting at the Red-Lodge in Bristol, and at
both meetings there were several hundreds of people: and likewise a meeting at
F^eltin, the fifteenth day of the same month and the seventeenth day we had a
meeting at Bishford, and hundreds went out of the City of Bristol to that
meeting: the nineteenth day we had a anomeeting at the Red-Lodge, and several
other meetings we had in about Bristol, in the same Month, called September,
which will all bear witness against thee, that thy slander is false, and thy
oath false, who says we were not at Bristol in September, which he has said
on his oath we were not; and here I have proved thy information false; again it
is full of confusion, who says that Coppinger said that none came so near him
as the quakers, and that he met with two in London of his own order, and yet he
says to the informant, if that he loved his religion and his soul, he should
not hear them, and yet says they came near him, and was of his own order,
which is false, we deny such liars, and their order, and here he is proved to
be in confusion, let all that can discern judge.

Again, the man that took the oath (as thou say) said that Coppinger was one
of the Franciscan company, and had taken upon him the order at Rome or Italy,
here the informant has made himself guilty of, and liable to the Law in such
cases, provided, who was privy to him, who said he had taken up that order, and
did not discover him (but let him go) and then accuses those that are
innocent, which bears the name of quakers. Now here thou art made manifest, to
be a false accuser, and a slanderer; I have proved that we came to the City of
Bristol in the month called July, before the fair, and likewise that we were at
those meetings before mentioned and several other meetngs we were at, in and
about Bristol, in the Month, called September, and this oath before mentioned,
being the ground of a warrant given forth by the Magistrates of Bristol, and
several of our names therein expressed, we who had been at Bristol, whose names
were there mentioned, came all forth of VVestmoreland, near unto Kendal, none
of us having never been out of the Nation, but we lived and walked in and at
our own habitations, excepting at the time of the wars, when we were in the
service of the Commonwealth^ and several of the commanders and magistrates, in
that country can bear witness to our places, and beings, and here your lies
and slanders are made to appear and utterly denied; and William Prynne, here
thou art clearly detected, who slanderest the innocent, living in the spawn
thou speaks of, the Poison of asps being under thy tongue, and spuing out thy
venom against the harmless, and thy informant is proved to be guilty, in not
discovering the man he speak of, which he has on his oath said that he
confessed to him he had been at Rome, and taken upon him the order of a Friar
of the Franciscan company. Now here let all people take notice of the dealings
of the magistrates, who gave out a warrant against the innocent, whom they
cannot justly prove any thing against whereof they do accuse them, and yet lets
him go free who concealed the said Coppinger, which on his oath declared, that
the said Coppinger confessed himself to be one of that order, and we deny all
of his Order, who lives in lying and confusion, or any* such to speak amongst
us, for we know the voice of Christ from the voice of the stranger, so the
devil being the father of lies, and a lie being thy foundation, thou art taken
with a lie in thy mouth, and so ads lie unto lie, and builds one lie upon
another; and then thou cries against thy own lies, for thou can prove no such
thing by us, as thou accuses us of, saying that the quakers use enchanted
Potion, Bracelets, Ribbands, Sorcery, and witchcrafe, which is false, and thou
like the raging Sea casts up thy mire and dirt; O thou full of all mischief,
and enemy to all righteousness, I charge thee, or any of thy companions of the
same order, who lives in lying, to prove any such thing by us, and make it
appear publicly as thou have accused us, or let thy mouth be stopped, and own
thy condemnation, and confess thy deceit, and call in thy filthy paper, and
take shame to thy self, for know this, that the Lord God will plead with thee
for all thy hard speeches, and justly by him shall thou be rewarded; and we
utterly deny, and do bear witness against all such filthy ways and practices
of all such Frogs as thou mentions, and against thee who prints lies, as I have
already proved, and liars must be cast into the Lake; and here I have found
thee, and proved thee in the intoxicated, giddy headed condition thou speaks
of, who art already deceived, and need be deceived no farther, and thou art
fallen into the pit thou dug, and they for whom thy not was spread (being
innocent) are escaped, and thy folly is unmasked, and thou art clearly
betected, and proved to be in error in thy very foundation, and so all thy
building is made void, and if thou cannot begin upon better evidence, let thy
mouth for ever be stoyyd, and let shame cover thy lips, and repent of the evil
of thy ways, lest the wrath of the Lord break out against thee, and there be
no remedy; to the Light in thy conscience I speak, and remember that thou art
warned.

Friend, thy Spirit is savoured and tried, and now this is the end of thy zeal,
who art become a persecutor of the life which thou have professed in words, and
now thy zeal appears without the knowledge of God, for the Jesuits, Romish
Friars, and Frogs (as thou calls them, are in the same nature as thou art in,
against that people whom thou scornfully calls quakers; and so there is many
unfavoury speeches in thy Paper, putforth by thee William Prynne, which (worth
the mentioning) are not; but thou have manifested the end of thy P^o^ession,
who appears now to be one of those giddy headded English men thou speaks of:
and as touching leading silly women Captive laden with sin, and led away with
diverse lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth, to thee th^s home shall return who appears to be in this state, learning
always, and silly, for how many years have thou been learning, and now do
resist the truth with thy unclean Spirit, as Iannes and Iambers did the
Children of Israel, which was coming out of Egypt, with their corrupt Spirits,
so with what Measure thou measurest, it shall be measured to thee again, good
weight, running over, pressed down: and friend, in the day of thy calamity,
remember whom thou have despised in the day of thy prosperity, and what thou
have rejected with thy full Stomach, and now loathes the Honny-Comb, and the
precious, and the vile chus^th, and so one with the Harlot art become, the
light does thee comprehend; thou say there was trembling or quaking in the
host in the field, and among all the people, the garrisons and the spoylers,
they also trembled, so it was a very great trembling, or quaking: this for thy
self shall stand, when thou thy self can read a spoyler, and see thy self in
the field, the strong man that must bow himself, and thy fenced Cities must be
broken down, and thy Garr^son, with all thy carnal weopons, then the host
shall thee fail, and then trembling and quaking will not be despised, which
stands with a put full compassion to all souls, and quaking and trembling does
not despise, for thou unmasked thy self in this paper have, to be a scorner and
scoffer at Gods righteous seed, which he upholds with his arm, for which thou
shall give an account* to the light in thy conscience, which changes not, is it
spoken.

And whereas thou, William Prynne, says that Coppinger confessed that he spoke
about thirty times at London, among them called quakers; it is false* he did
not speak amongst us who are so called, but them that have spoken amongst us,
their names we know, and so we (whose names are subscribed) bear witness
against that untruth thou have published in print, Amors Toddert, Simon Dring,
John Bolton; William Creake, Gervase Roberts, Henry Clerk, Robert Dring;
William Kaymond, Richard Davies, William West.

A Reply to an Additional Paper, put forth by William Prynne, in his Lying
Enlarged Edition.
FRiend, thou pretending a reply to that which is before printed, in a paper
put forth by thee, bearing the same title, which thou says is the second
Edition, enlarged; to thee I shall reply, that the things which I proved stands
good, and not detected by thee, but thou art clearly detected; and proved to
make a lie thy foundation, and now in thy lying enlarged Edition, thou have
gathered up more lies; and sent them abroad into the world, and full of venom
thou art, spawned from the Serpent, crawling in the mire like the frogs thou
peaks of, casting up thy filth, and foming like the Sea, and when thou have
gathered up a heap of lies together, thou would cast them upon the children
of light, wwo in scorn are called quakers, who denies thee among the rest of
the Roman^ vermin, and giddy-headded, brainsick generation, and were thou not
blind thou would not utter forth such confusion, Babylon is thy habitation,
the destruction of thy City is ha tningapace, Misery and lamentation from the
Lord God, is coming upon you, the burdensome stone will grind you to pieces.

Thou says the chief exception is against Cowlishaw, his Oath is untrue, for,
say thou, though we were in Bristol, and went to two meetings, yet that was
unknown to Cowlishaw.

Reply. Here thou have confessed that the oath is untrue, in that he swear the
thing he knew not, which thing proves contrary to what he swear, and and this
again p^oves thy foundation false, who faith we had not been at Bristol, and
swear the thing he knew not, as is before expressed.

Thou say, we spoke to those people then, not under the notion of quakers,
but only of Anabaptists, and Independants.

Reply. This is false, lie to lie thou ads, take them away, and thy refuge is
gone, we did not speak to them as Anaba^tists, or as Independants, and this
many of the people will witness for us, and against thee, and there was several
in that City that knew us to be of those people that were called quakers, which
proves another lie upon thee.

Thou say, when the meetings was in September, we began to take upon us the
name and title of quakers, and that those meetings was after Cowlishaws
conference with Coppinger, who adds that about eighteen days after.

Reply. Thy covering is too narrow, by the Light thou art discovered, for the
information faith it was in September, and then were we in Bristol, and the
words about eighteen days after, which (...) proves the thing false, we being
at Bristol then at those public meetings before mentioned, and that we began
to take upon us the title of quakers then is false; and with such filthy stuff
thou makes up thy enlarged Edition.

Thou says this convinces Audland of a slander, and doube ly: First, in
accusing Cowl^shaw for making a false oath, which his own answer to it
justifies it to be true.

Reply. This is a double ly, for plainness of speech I use, and gives a lie the
name of a lie: first, I am not convinced that he is slandered, for the oath is
proved to be false, in affirming that which he knew not, and that which was
not; and that the answer justifies it to be true, is false again, for the
Answer proves it absolutely untrue. S^condly, thou says in averring, that he
(and his Companions) were moved by the Lord, and his eternal Spirit, to leave
their own Habitations and Callings in the North, to come to seduce the People
of Bristol.

Reply. Let shame cover thy lips (if thy heart be not hardened) thou will blush,
are these my words, or thy own? I charge thee to be a slanderer, and a false
accuser of the Brethren, these words was never uttered by me, all seducers and
seducing by the Spirit of God is denied, and witnessed against, and thou art
witnessed against by the Spirit of God, that thou art full of venom, froth, and
filth, which is not worth raking up after thee; thy Heart is overcome with it,
let it return into the Pit from whence it came, where the Frogs lodges, who are
thy companions. Again, that which is spoken, as touching the breach of the Law
in not discovering Coppinger, but concealing him, and letting him depart, is
true according to the Law and thy evading it, by seeming to cover it, by
Coppingers hasty departure, and the suspension of the Laws, thou says, to
that purpose, does no whit prove the contrary, and had not your envy
transported you beyond the bounds of equity, you would be ashamed to publish
such a thing, but it is clearly seen whom you shout at, and whom you would
devour, though you pretend the Jusuits, they are so near of kin to you, you can
let them go, and after conference with them (as thou says Cowlishaw had with
Coppinger) who confess themselves to be such, thou concealest them, and bring
in their words to slander the innocent, and truth ever suffered under
reproachful names and tongues, in which thou have not a little share, thou fills
up thy measure, and accordingly shall thou be rewarded.

Thou says, I except against thee for averring that the quakers are but the
spawn of Romish frogs, Jesuits, and Franciscan Friars, and to deny this is
alleged that they came out of the North, and thou says to come out of the
North is a shrewd sign of their badness, for the Scriptures speaks, that out
of the North an evil shall break forth.

Reply. To prove that we came out of the Nort, and had never been out of
Nation, and of our birth and habitations, does sufficiently confute thee, who
made that thy ground to have proved by the information, that we were Coppingers
acquaintance in Rome, for say thou, those two persons which came to Bristol,
was most likely his two fellow Franciscan Friars, and here thy likeness is
another lie, and the Scripture does not prove thy shrewd sign, neither does
it cover thee, nor hide thee, but upon thee will evil break forth, who the
evil have committed, a grievour storm and whitlwind will fall upon the wicked,
and sweep away the refuge of lies and liars into the Lake, read thy portion*
and put it not from thee.

Secondly, Thou says for affirming that the quakers use enchanted potions,
Bracelets, Ribban^s* Sorcery, and witchcraft to intoxicate their disciples; and
thou say, this is evidenced in the Pr^mises, and apparent in most places
where they ramble, and thou shall prove it no farther, but close up all with
two Scripture exhortations.

Reply. I demanded of thee before to prove any such thing by us, or let thy
mouth be stopped, and as touching proving any such thing, thy mouth is stopped, and
thy premises proves it not by us, but is made up of lies and slanders, and
false reports, which thou have gathered where thou have rambled up and down in
thy imaginations, sending out a pack of filthy lies, spawned out from the old
Serpent the Devil, and Satan, out of whose mouth proceeds the frogs and there
may thou read thy self apparently, his disciple intoxicated, and thee with all
the rest of the spawn of Romish Frogs, Jesuits, and Franciscan Friars is
denied, and cast out from amongst the people of God, scorn-called quakers, and
if thou can prove no better then to close up as thou does, the lies will rest
upon thy own head; but will thou turn back a little, and take one exhortation
where thou art giving two, if there be any spark of honesty in thee, or any
remembrance of thy latter end, or any consideration that liars must be cast
into the Lake, repent of the evil of thy doings, and cease lying and slandering
the innocent, which thou can not prove to be offenders, and lay thy mouth in
the dust, if so be there may be hope* so here in plainness thy lies is turned
upon thy own head, and the former answer is just, and stands a witness against
thee, and thou art more unmasked, and clearly detected, and til thou can begin
upon better evidence, silence best becomes thee: Remember again thou art
warned, cease thy gainsaying, lest ton perish in thy rebellion, and go down
alive into the Pit.
