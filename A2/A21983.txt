By the King.
We have since our entry into this Realm of England, had special care to make
all our Subjects know, with how equal affection we resolved to proceed in all
things which should concern the safety or honor of our Kingdoms, for both
which we know we are to make one and the self-same account to Almighty God,
under whom we hold all earthly things, In which respect, we were very curious
to prevent at our first coming all manner of offenses or affronts, which
naturally do arise between several Nations at their first joining in
society and conversation, never ceasing to lay severe commandment upon our
greatest Subjects that came in with us, to suppress any injurious Actions of
any of their Servants or Train, toward the meanest Subjects of English birth,
in whom from the highest to the lowest we have observed so great love and
general obedience to us and our Cammandements: And whenever it has come to
our ears that any Offense has been done by any of them, We have made them
know how much it has displeased us. Notwithstanding, because we do hear of
many Insoelncies reported to be committed by our Nation of Scotland to our
English Subjects, with this addition further, That the Magistrates and Justices
are thought to be remiss toward such, in doubt lest the same should be
offensiuely reported to us: We have thought it convenient as well for the
satisfaction of the one sort, as for admonition to the others, to publish by
open signification, That seeing it has pleased Almighty God to call us to the
Supreme power over both, We are purposed to be an universal and equal
Sovereign to them both, and to administer Justice where there shall be
occasion, without any worldly respect to either of them. And therefore do
hereby enjoin all Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, and all
other our Officers and Ministers of this Kingdom, that whenever complaint
shall be made to any of them, that breach of Peace is committed by those of our
Nation of Scotland, upon the Subjects of England, or by the Subjects of England
upon those of the Nation of Scotland, In both which kinds we hear of many
great abuses, though sometimes aggrauated according to the humor of the
Reporters, they shall carefully upon every complaint, examine with all
indifferency the particulars of every such Action, and cause punishment to be
inflicted upon the party offending, without respect of Nation, according to
the Laws of this Realm.

And to the end they may not doubt ot proceed to the execution thereof: As we
do hereby not only assure them that we will strengthen and maintain all
Officers and Magistrates in the execution of their Officers, for the
preservation of the public Peace of this Realm: So if we shall see at any
time that any Magistrate shall be slow to redress such grieuances, or punish
the Offenders, We shall have cause to think, that they are willing to nourish
some cause of such rumors, the rather to serve for color or cause of further
alienantion, and so by consequence of sedition amongst our people, and an
hinderance to that union between both States, which is one of the greatest
benefits that We bring with us to our people for their strength and safety; in
governing of whom, though We must use, as all other Princes do, the ministry
of subodinate Ministers, yet God Almighty knows, that in our own mind there
is not a thought of partiality toward either of them, but an internal desire
and resolution to afford indifferent Grace and Justice to all: For
demonstration whereof We have been forced to publish thus much, lest the
iniquity of Faction and unruly spirits might blemish the innocence and
intergritie of our heart toward all our Subjects, whom We hold dearer then
our own life.

Given at our Castle of Windsore the eight day of July, 1603. in the first
year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, And of Scotland the six
and thirtieth.
Imprinted at Lodon by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
