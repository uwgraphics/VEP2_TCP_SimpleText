AN ACCOUNT Of the Produce of The Glass-Duty.
BY the Commissioners Account for Receiving the said Duties, the Gross Duty
appears, from Michaelmas, 1695, to the Seventeenth of November, 1696, to be l.
17642 s. 1 d. 5 Out of which must be Deducted, For Charges of Collecting the
Duty as by their own Account -- l. 2766 s. 3 d. 4 For Debentures at London,
according to the Commissioners of the Customhouse's Account l. 840 s. 5 d. 8
For Debentures at Bristol, according to the said Commissioners Account -- l.
2976 s. 0 d. 0 For Debentures at New Castle and Sheels -- l. 1020 s. 0 d. 0 For
prompt Payment allowed by the Commissioners of Glass-Duties Account l. 167 s. 4
d. 1 l. 7769 s. 13 d. 1 l. 9872 s. 8 d. 4

And out of the abovesaid Sum will be drawn back for Glass that will be
Exported out of the Stock now on the Makers Hands, which has paid the Duty,
and is included in the abovesaid Sum at least 700 l. and with an Addition of
10000 dozen of Bottles more to be made, which will pay but 500 l. to the Crown,
will answer all Demands for Glass until Lady Day next; so that adding the 500
l. to the above 9872 l. 8 s. 4 d. and then deducting 700 l. for the Glass that
will be Shipped off; and also 1000 l.for the Charge of Collecting from the 17 of
November last, to Lady Day next, there will remain but 8672 l. 8 s. 4 d. for a
Year and a half.

Which for One Year is but 5781 l. 12 s. 3 d.

Which Sum of 5781 l. 12 s. 3 d. is more then any following year can be
supposed to produce.

In as much as it had not been possible for the Glass Masters to have worked so
long as they have, had it not been, that they had the opportunity of Old Cliped
Money to carry on their Works, pay Servants Wages, and the Duty.

And that putting out their Fires is Contrivance, as the Commissioners
Insinuate, will appear only Contrivance in them and other Officers to continue
their Salaries; when considered that the Masters have continued their Works so
long, that want of Demand for Goods, forced them to put out their Fires; having
such a Stock by them, as with a small Addition, will serve all demands to
Lady Day next, as by account.
