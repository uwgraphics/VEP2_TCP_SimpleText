A Proclamation for putting off this next Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, and
our Lady Fair in Southwarke.
WHereas His MAJESTY has taken special care, and given several directions,
that the usual Assemblies and concourse of people might be omitted and
forborne, the better to prevent the Danger and Increase of the Infection: Yet
finding that the Plague is dispersed in sundry places in and near about the
City of London, His Majesty in pursuance of those directions, and out of His
continual care of the safety of His Subjects in general, and of the said City
in particular, and to cut off all occasions that may conduce to the further
spreading of the sickness, Does hereby declare his Royal will and pleasure
for the putting off this next Bartholomew Fair, usually keptin Smithfield, and
of a Fair kept in Southwarke, called our Lady Fair.

And therefore his Majesty does admonish and command all His loving Subjects to
forbear to resort this year to the said Faires or either of them; And does
also require and enjoin the Lords, and others interessed in the same Faires,
that they shall not hold this now next Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, nor our
Lady Fair in Southwarke nor elsewhere; Upon pain of such punishment, as for a
Contempt so much concerning the general safety of His Majesty's Subjects they
shall be adjudged to deserve.

Given at Our Court at Oatelands, the three and twentieth day of July in the
thirteenth year of Our Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1637.
