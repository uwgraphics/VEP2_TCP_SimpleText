By the King.
A Proclamation against transportation of Corn and Grain.
FOrasmuch as We see apparently, that there is already great scarsitie of
Corn and Grain of all sorts, and the same grown to very high rates and
prices; And the weather also has long been, and still continues so strange
and unseasonable, as it gives no hope of amedment, But rather is like much to
impair the Fruits of the earth that are to be expected of the next year; So
as the poor must needs suffer extreme want, and the better sort also find it
heavy and chargeable unto them, except it please GOD to deal mercifully with
us; And therefore Wisdom requires, That all meants be used to prevent as well
Exportation of Corn and Grain out of the Kingdom, as unnecessary waste and
consumption thereof at home. We threfore (whose cares watch over Our people to
preserve them from all inconveniences, Although We are not ignorant that this
height of price grows more out of the greedy covetousness of Buyers and
Hourders of Corn, then out of the want or dearth thereof;) And though also the
price of all kind of Grains be, and for some good time past has been such,
as no Transportation thereof can lawfully be made by the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm; Yet to the end that the world may take knowledge of Our
extraordinary care in this behalf, and that no man have hope to escape
punishment, if he offend from henceforth in this case; WE do by this Our
Proclamation straightly charge and command all and singular Our Subjects, and
other persons whatsoever, That they nor any of them presume to carry or convey
out of this Realm, directly or indirectly, and Wheat, Rye, Barley, Malt, Dates,
Pease, Beans, Fetches, Bucke, or any Corn or Grain whatsoever, or the Meal
or Flower thereof, upon pain of Our heavy displeasure, and of such
imprisonment, and other punishments, as upon the contemners of Our Royal
commandment in so weighty and important causes, are and ought to be inflicted.

And We do likewise hereby as straightly charge and command all Our Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers, Waitours, and other the Ministers of Our ports, And
the Farmours of Our Customs and Subsidies, and all other persons whatsoever,
That they suffer no such Corn, Grain, Meal or Flower, as aforesaid, to be
conveyed or carried out of this Realm; But shall hinder and stop the same, if
they have means so to do; Or else shall presently upon knowledge thereof,
complain and give knowledge of it to some principal Officers, to the end it
be prevented, Upon pain likewise of such punishments as are due to them that
neglect Our Royal Commandment.

Given at Newmarket the xix. of January, in the tenth year of Our Reign of
Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
