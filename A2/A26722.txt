122. 128. 130. 131. 146. 149.

Choice parts of these are put in and amended. 7. 9. 17. 18. 19. 22. 27. 31.
33. 34. 35. 37. 40. 41. 42. 49. 50. 55. 56, 57. 60. 61 62. 65. 66. 68. 69. 71.

is truly good; To which above thirty new ones are now added, viz. 5. 6. 14.

Father.

And there is not one bald phrase or ill-favored hysteron proteron in all the
book but either sense in each line, or the grammatical ^ order of words, the
most acceptable and (...) structure of English poesy.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Sr. JOHN WOLLASTON, Knight and Alderman of the
Honorable City of London.
Right worshipful,
SVch are my known engagements to your self, and your worthy and virtuous Lady,
that all men may justly expect (if God put any thing into my hands) I should
not defraud you of the honor and acknowledgements which I owe to you both, but
rejoice to express my gratitude to God almighty, in raising up to me such
special and precious friends, to so great advantage and increase of my
long-despaired health, as has made me of late to omit complaints, and many to
wonder at the change.

Besides, Sir, your own cost and kindness has been, by Gods blessing, the
only Sunshine to ripen these my labors, and produce them to the public, and
that (breaking through so may difficulties) I should be able to bring them to
this perfection, that at least they are useful while the old ones are in use,
for 35. whole ones of these and many parts and pieces of the rest (which call
Collects) are (verse for verse) of the sam^ quantity with the old, and may be
sung in public, while some (wedded to custom) sing the old without any
incongruity at all: so that n^ne can possibly point out any considerable psalm,
or part of a psalm, that is well done of the old, but her^ it is to be found,
and the absurdities removed neither is any thing left out, which is not so poor
and imperfect, or far off the words and sense, a^ that it is requisite to be
made wholly new, or i^ not already taken into the new.

Wherefore I humbly present it as a token of my thankfulness, praising the
Lord for you, and praying the Lord to enrich you, and my much Honored Lady
with abundance of heavenly forwardness, faithfulness, and fruitfulness,
which may be summed up to the glory of God, and furtherance of our account in
the day of Jesus Christ our Lord,

Your worships fervent and faithful Minister, to his utmost, WILLIAM BARTON.
Upon Mr. WILLIAM BARTONS elaborate Translation of the sacred Book of PSALMS.
GO book, and servethy Master, none so great,
His gift alone did make thee so complete:
Polish the fabric of reformed times,
Fresh, fair and fine, to flourish as thy rimes.
Lo, thou have art, the Learned to content;
To please the curious thou art eloquent:
Quicknes thou giv'st to them that quicknes want,
And do interpret to the ignorant.
The scrupulous thy skill does satisfy,
And captious carpers are convinced thereby.
Thy price is little, but thy worth is such,
That every leaf deserves twice as much.

PSALM. 1. The first Meter.
To any general tune.**
THat man is blessed and blessed again,
that does not walk astray,
By counsels of ungodly men,
nor stands in sinners way:
2
Much less sits down in scorners seat,
but here is his delight,
Upon the Law of God the Lord
to study day and night.
3
He shall be like a tree that grows
fast by the rivers side:
That brings forth ripe and timely fruit,
which still is fresh supplied.
Whose leaf does never fade nor fall,
but flourish still and stand:
Even so shall all things prosper well,
that this man takes in hand.
4
So shall not the ungodly men,
they shall be nothing so:
But as the dust, which, from the earth,
the wind drives to and fro.
5
Therefore shall not the wicked men
in judgment stand upright:
Nor in the assembly of the just
shall sinners come in sight.
6
For why, the way of godly men,
unto the Lord is known:
Whereas the way of wicked men
shall quite be overthrown.
PSALM. 3. The first Meter.
O Lord how are my foes encreast
that vex me more and more?
They kill my heart, when as they say,
God can him not restore.
2
But thou, O Lord, art my defense
when I am hard bestead;
3
My worship and my honor both,
and thou holdst up my head.
4
Then with my voice unto the Lord,
I did both call and cry:
And he out of his holy hill,
did hear me by and by.
5
I laid me down most quietly,
I slept and rose again;
For why, I knew assuredly
the Lord did me sustain.
6
Although ten thousand hemmed me in,
I would not be afraid:
For thou art still my Lord and God,
my Savior and mine aid.
7
Rise up therefore, save me, O Lord,
for now to thee I call:
For thou have broke the cheeks and teeth
of these transgressors all.
8
Salvation only does belong
to thee O Lord above:
Thou do bestow upon thy folk
thy blessing and thy love.
PSALM. 4. The first Meter, *
O God that art my righteousness,
Lord hear me when I call:
Thou have set me at liberty,
when I was bound in thrall.
2
Have mercy Lord therefore on me,
and grant me my request:
For unto thee uncessantly,
to cry I will not rest.
3
O mortal men how long will ye
my glory thus despise?
Why wander ye in vanity,
and follow after lies?
4
Know ye that good and godly men,
the Lord does take and choose:
And when to him I make my plaint,
he does me not refuse.
5
Sin not, but stand in aw therefore,
examine well your heart:
And in your chamber quietly,
see ye your selves convert.
6
Offer to God the sacrifice
of righteousness, I say:
And see that in the living Lord
you put your trust always.
7
The greater sort crave worldly goods,
and riches do embrace:
But, Lord, grant us thy countenance,
thy favor and thy grace.
8
For thou, O Lord, have made my heart
more joyful and more glad,
Then when they brought in corn and wine,
and great increase was had.
9
In peace therefore lie down will I,
taking my rest and sleep:
For only thou alone, O Lord,
Wilt me in safety keep.
PSALM. 5. The second Meter.
O Lord consider my complaint,
incline thine ear to me;
2
And hear my voice, my King, my God,
I make my prayer to thee.
3
Hear me betimes, Lord tarry not,
for I will have respect,
My prayer, early in the morn,
to thee for to direct.
4
And I will wait with patience,
on thee my ^od alone:
Thou art not pleased with wickedness,
and ill with thee dwells none.
5
And in thy sight shall never stand,
these wicked fools, O Lord:
Vain workers of iniquity,
thou always have abhorred.
6
Thou shall destroy the flatterers,
and them that utter lies:
Bloodthirsty and deceitful men,
will God abhor likewise;
7
Therefore will I come to thy house,
trusting upon thy grace:
And reverently will worship thee,
toward thy holy place.
8
Lord, lead me in thy righteousness,
for to confound my foes;
And in what way I ought to walk,
before my face disclose.
9
For in their mouth there is no truth,
their hearts are foul and vain;
10
Their throat's an open sepulcher,
their tongues do fawn and feign.
11
Destroy their false conspiracies,
that they may come to naught:
Subvert them in their heaps of sin,
which have rebellion wrought.
12
But they that put their trust in thee,
let them be glad always:
And render thanks for thy defense,
and give thy Name the praise.
13
For thou will bless and magnify
the righteous man no doubt,
And with thy grace as with a shield,
wilt compass him about.
PSALM. 7. The Collect.*
O Lord my God I put my trust
and confidence in thee,
Save me from them that seek my soul,
and fully set me free.
2
Lest like a lion fierce and fell,
he tear and rend my soul,
While there is no deliverer,
his fury to control.
3
O Lord my God, if I have done
the thing that is not right;
Or else if I be found in fault,
or guilty in thy sight:
4
And to my friend rewarded ill,
or left him in distress,
Which has pursued me wrongfully,
and did my soul oppress:
5
Then let my so pursue my soul,
and let him take, and tread
My life even down unto the ground,
and lay mine honor dead.
6
O thou that art of all men judge,
now judge my righteous cause;
According to my righteousness,
and thy most righteous laws.
11
I take my help to come of God,
in all my pain and grief:
He does preserve the pure in heart,
and sends them sweet relief.
15
Behold, the wicked travelleth,
with mischief in his mind;
Conceiving sin and wickedness,
and brings forth the wind.
16
He digs a ditch and del^es it deep,
in hope to catch his brother;
But he shall fall into the pit,
that he dig'd up for other.
17
Thus wrong returns to the hurt,
of him in whom it bred;
And all the mischief that he wrought,
shall fall upon his head.
18
I will give thanks to God therefore,
that judges righteously:
And with a song will praise the Name
of him that is most high.
PSALM. 8. The first Meter.**
O Lord our Lord, how wonderful
is thy Name every where?
Whose fame surmounts in dignity
above the starrie sphere.
2
Even by the mouths of sucking babes,
thou will confound thy foes;
For in these babes thy might is seen,
thy graces they disclose.
3
And when I see the heavens high,
the works of thine own hand:
The Sun, and Moon, and all the stars,
in order as they stand.
4
What thing is man, Lord, think I then,
that he should be in mind?
Or what is man's posterity,
to whom thou art so kind?
5
For thou have made him little less,
then Angels in degree;
And thou have also crowned him,
with highest dignity.
6
Thou have prefer^'d him to be Lord,
of all thy works of wonder:
And have set all things at his feet,
that he should keep them under,
7
As oxen, sheep, and all beasts else,
that in the fields do feed,
8
Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
and all that therein breed.
9
Therefore, O Lord, that art out Lord,
must I repeat the same:
How excellent in all the earth,
is thy most glorious Name!
PSALM. 9. The Collect. ***
With heart and mouth unto the Lord
will I sing laud and praise:
And speak of all his wondrous works,
and them declare always.
2
I will be glad and much rejoice,
in thee O Lord most high:
And with my songs extol thy Name
above the starrie sky.
3
Because my foes are driven back,
and put to shameful flight:
They fall down flat, and are destroyed
by thy great power and might.
7
Know then that he which is above
for evermore shall reign,
And in the seat of equity
true judgment will maintain,
9
He is protector of the poor,
what time they be oppressed:
He is their succor in distress,
their refuge and their rest.
11
Sing Psalms therefore unto the Lord,
that dwells in Sion hill.
Publish among the nations all,
his noble acts and will.
12
For he is mindful of the blood
of poor oppressed (...):
Forgetting not the afflicted heart,
but hea^s their sighs and groans.
15
He lets the heathen fall into
the pit that they prepared:
And in the net that they did set,
are they themselves ensnared.
18
But sure the Lord will not forget
the poor man's grief and pain:
The patient people never look
for help of God in vain.
19
O Lord arise, lest men prevail,
that be of worldly might:
And let the heathen folk receive
their judgment in thy sight.
20
Lord strike such terror, fear and dread
into the hearts of them:
That they may know assuredly,
they be but mortal men.
PSALM. 10. The first Meter. *
What is the cause that thou, O Lord,
art now so far from thine?
And keep close thy countenance
from us this troublous time?
2
The poor do perish by the proud
and wicked men's desire:
Let them be taken in the craft
that they themselves conspire.
3
For in the lust of his own heart
the ungodly does delight:
And he does bl^^se the covetous
abhorred in thy sight:
4
He is so proud, that right and Wrong
he sets all apart:
There is not any God, says he,
for thus he thinks in heart.
5
Because his ways do prosper still,
he does thy laws contem':
He puffs at all his enemies,
sets light by thee and them.
6
Tush, tush, says he, I have no dread
that mine estate should change:
Because that all adversity
to him is very strange.
7
His mouth is full of cursednesse,
of fraud, deceit and guile:
Under his tongue does mischief fit,
and works all the while.
8
He lies hid in ways and holes,
the innocent to slay:
Against the poor his eyes are ben^,
that pass along the way.
9
And, like a Lion, privily
lies lurking in his den,
If he may snare them in his net,
to spoil poor simple men.
10
And for the nonce full craftily
he croucheth down, I say:
So are great heaps of poor men made,
by his strong power, his prey.
The second part.*
11
TUsh, God forgets this, says he,
therefore I may be bold:
His countenance is cast aside,
he does it not behold.
12
Arise, O Lord, O God, in whom
the poor man's hope does rest:
Lift up thy hand, forget not, Lord,
the poor that be oppressed.
13
What blasphemy is this to thee?
Lord, do thou not abhor it?
To hear the wicked in their hearts
say, tush, thou car'st not for it?
14
But thou see all their wickedness,
and well do understand,
That friendlesse and poor fatherless
are l^ft unto thy hand.
15
Of wicked and malicious men
then break the power for ever:
That they with their iniquity
may perish altogether.
16
The Lord shall reign for evermore,
as King and God alone:
And he will chase the heathen folk
out of his land, each one.
17
Unto the poors complaint and cry,
thou giv'st a gracious ear:
Thou will prepare their patient heart,
and cause thine ears to hear.
18
To judge the poor and fatherless,
and help them to their right:
That they may be no more oppressed
by men of worldly might.
PSALM. 11. The first Meter.
Sing this to any general tune. *
I Put my confidence in God,
why therefore do you say,
That as a bird unto her hill,
my ^^ul should flee away?
2
For lo, the wicked bend their bows,
their arrows they prepare,
To shoot in secret, and to hurt
the souls that upright are.
3
Of worldly help all stays were shrunk,
and clearly brought to naught:
As for the good and righteous man,
what has the righteous wrought?
4
But he that in his Temple is,
most holy and most high,
And in the heavens has his seat
of royal Majesty:
The poor and simple man's estate
considers in his mind:
And searches out full narrowly
the manners of mankind:
5
And with a cheerful countenance
the righteous man will use:
But in his heart he does abhor
all such as mischief muse:
6
And on the sinners casts snares,
as thick as any rain:
Brimstone and fire, and whirl-windes thick,
appointed for their pain.
7
Ye see then how a righteous God
does righteousness embrace:
And to the just and upright men
shows forth his pleasant face.
PSALM. 12. The first Meter.*
HElp Lord, for good and godly men
do perish and decay:
And faith and truth from worldly men
is parted clean away.
2
Who so does with his neighbor talk,
his talk is all but vain:
For every man bethinketh how
to flatter, lie, and fain.
3
But flattering and deceitful lips,
and tongues that be so stout,
To speak proud words, and make great brags,
the Lord soon cuts them out.
4
For they say still, we will prevail,
our tongues shall us extol:
Our tongues are ours, we ought to speak,
what Lord shall us control?
4
But for the great complaint and cry
of poor, and men oppressed:
I will arise now, says the Lord,
and them restore to rest.
6
Gods Word is like to silver pure,
that from the earth is tried:
And has no less then seven times
in fire been purified.
7
Now since thy promise is to help,
Lord, keep thy promise then:
And save us now and evermore,
from this ill kind of men.
8
For now the wicked world is full
of mischiefs manifold:
When wicked men do bear the sway,
and vice goes uncontrol'd.
WIthin thy Tabernacle, Lord,
who shall continue still?
And whom will thou receive to dwell
in thy most holy hill?
2
The man whose life is incorrupt,
whose works are just and straight:
Whose heart does think the very truth,
whose tongue speaks no deceit.
3
That to his neighbor does none ill,
in body, goods, or name:
Nor willingly does move false tales,
which might empair the same.
4
The man in whose impartial eyes,
vile persons are abhorred;
But he does greatly honor those
that truly fear the Lord.
5
His oath and all his promises
that keeps faithfully:
Although he make his conenant so,
that he does lose thereby:
6
That puts not to usury
the money that he lent;
Nor will he take reward at all
against the innocent.
7
Who so does all things as you see,
that here is to be done:
Shall never perish in this world,
nor in the world to come.
PSALM. 17. The first Collect. *
O Lord give ear to my just cause,
attend when I complain:
And hear the prayer that I put forth,
with lips that do not fain.
3
Thou have well tried me in the night,
and yet could nothing find:
For, that my mouth should not transgress
I purposed in my mind.
4
As for the works of wicked men,
and paths perverse and ill,
For love of thy most holy Name,
I have refrained still.
5
Then in thy paths that be most pure,
do thou my soul preserve,
That from the way wherein I walk,
my st^ps may never swerve.
6
For I do call to thee O Lord,
surely thou will me aid:
Then hear my prayer, and weigh right well
the words that I have said.
14
Lord save me by thy mighty power,
out of these tyrants hands:
Which now so long a time have reigned,
and kept us in their bands.
15
I mean, from worldlings, unto whom
all worldly goods are rife:
That have no hope nor part of joy,
but in this present life.
16
Thou giv'st them store of thy hid treasure
and children to their mind;
They spend thereof, and leave the rest
unto their babes behind.
17
But I shall see thy blessed face
with purest conscience viewed:
And waking shall be satisfied
with thy similitude.
PSALM. 18. The Collect. *
O God my strength and fortitude,
I love thee vehemently:
Thou art my castle and defense
in my necessity.
2
My God my rock, in whom I trust,
the worker of my wealth:
My refuge, buckler, and my shield,
and horn of saving health.
4
The pangs of death did compass me,
and held me every where:
The flowing waves of wickedness,
did put me in great fear.
5
The sly and subtle snares of hell
were round about me set:
And for my feet there was prepared
a deadly trapping net.
6
I thus beset with pain and grief,
did pray to God for grace:
And he forthwith did hear my plaint
out of his holy place.
15
And from above the Lord sent down
to fetch me from below:
And plucked me from the waters deep,
about to overflow.
20
Because I walked in his ways,
and in his paths have trod:
And have not wandered wickedly,
departing from my God.
21
But evermore I had respect
to his entire decree:
His statutes and commandments
I cast not out from me.
22
But pure, and clean, and incorrupt,
appeared before his face:
And did abstain from wickedness,
and sin in any case.
23
The Lord therefore will me reward,
as I have done aright:
As is the cleanness of my hands.
appearing in his sight.
PSALM. 19. The Collect.*
HOw perfect is the Law of God,
how is his covenant sure?
Converting souls, and making wise
the simple and obscure.
8
Just are the Lords commandments,
and glad both heart and mind:
His precepts pure, and do give light
to eyes that be full blind.
9
The fear of God is excellent,
and does endure for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true,
and righteous altogether:
10
And more to be embraced always,
then fined gold, I say:
The honey and the honeycomb
are not so sweet as they.
11
By them thy servant is fore-warned
to have God in regard:
And in performance of the same,
there shall be great reward.
12
But, Lord, what earthly man does know
the errors of his life:
Then cleanse my soul from secret sins
which are in me most rife:
13
And keep me that presumptuous sins
prevail not over me:
And so shall I be innocent,
and great offenses flee.
14
Accept my mouth, accept my heart,
my words and thoughts each one:
For my redeemer and my strength,
O Lord thou art alone.
PSALM. XXII. Col.*
O God my God, wherefore do thou
forsake me utterly?
And do not hear when I complain,
nor hearken to my cry?
2
To thee, my God, even all day long,
I do both cry and call,
And all the night I do not cease,
yet hear'st thou not at all.
6
Behold, I am become a worm
more liker then a man,
An outcast, whom the people spurn
with all the spite they can.
11
O Lord depart not now from me,
in all my pain and grief;
Since I have none my help to be,
none else to send relief.
20
Lord, save me from the cruel sword,
by thy almighty power;
And keep my dear and darling soul,
from dogs that would devour.
25
Among the folk that fear the Lord
will I thy praise proclaim;
And keep my vow and promise made
for setting forth thy Name.
26
The poor shall eat and be sufficed,
and you that seek the Lord,
Your heart shall live for evermore,
his praises to record.
28
The kingdoms of the heathen folk
shall worship and adore,
For God shall be their governor,
and King for evermore.
PSALM. XXV. 1. M. 1. part.
Have mercy, etc.
I Lift my heart to thee,
My God and guide most just:
Now suffer me to take no shame,
for in thee do I trust.
2
Let not my foes rejoice,
nor make a scorn of me:
And let them not be overthrown,
that put their trust in thee.
3
But shame shall them befall,
which harm them wrongfully:
Therefore thy paths and thy right ways
unto me, Lord, descry:
4
Direct me in thy truth,
and teach me in thy way:
Thou art my God and Savior,
on thee I wait all day.
5
I pray thee, Lord, remember,
thy mercies manifold,
And thy compassions plentiful,
for they have been of old.
6
Remember not the faults,
and frailty of my youth:
Remember not how I have sinned
against thy blessed truth.
Nor after my deserts
let me thy mercy find:
But of thine own benignity
Lord, have me in thy mind.
7
His mercy is full sweet
his truth a perfect guide:
Therefore the Lord will sinners teach,
and such as go aside.
8
The humble he will teach
his precepts for to keep;
He will direct in all his ways,
the lowly and the meek.
9
For all the ways of God
are mercy, truth and grace:
To them that keep his Covenant,
and do his laws embrace.
PSALM. XXV. 2. P. I. M.
10
NOw for thy holy Name
O Lord I thee entreat,
To grant me pardon for my sin,
for it is wondrous great.
11
Who so does fear the Lord,
the Lord will him direct,
To lead his life in such a way
as he does best accept.
12
His soul shall evermore
in goodness dwell and stand:
His seed and his posterity
inheriting the land.
13
All those that fear the Lord,
his secret will shall know:
And unto them the Lord is pleased
his testaments to show.
14
Mine eyes continually
upon the Lord are set:
For he has plucked my fettred feet
out of the snare and net.
15
With mercy me behold,
to thee I make my moan:
For I am poor and desolate,
and comfortless alone.
16
The troubles of my heart,
are multiplied indeed:
Bring me out of this misery,
necessity and need.
17
Behold my anguish, Lord,
my poverty, my pain:
Remit my sin and mine offense,
and make me clean again.
18
O Lord, behold my foes,
how they do still increase:
Pursuing me with deadly hate,
that fain would live in peace.
19
Preserve and keep my soul,
and still deliver me:
And let me not be overthrown,
because I trust in thee.
20
Let my simplicity,
defend me from my foes,
Because I trust in thy defense,
from enemies that oppose.
21
Deliver, Lord, thy folk,
and send them sweet relief:
And ease thy chosen Israel,
of all his pain and grief.
PSALM. XXVI. I. M.
To any general tune. **
LOrd be my judge, and thou shall see,
my paths be pure and plain:
I trust in God to strengthen me,
that so I may remain.
2
Prove me, my God, by any means,
search out my secret heart;
Examine me and try my reins,
and every inward part.
3
Thy goodness laid before my face,
I do behold always:
For of thy truth I tread the trace,
and will do all my days.
4
I do not hold society,
with men whose deeds are vile;
I will not come in company,
with them that practice guile.
5
I much abhor the wicked sort,
their doing I despise:
I do not once to them resort,
that hurtful things devise.
6
My hands I wash, and do proceed,
in works to walk upright,
Then to thine altar I make speed,
to offer in thy sight.
7
That I may speak and preach the praise
that does belong to thee:
And so declare how wondrous ways
thou have been good to me.
8
O God, thy house I love most dear,
to me it does excel:
I have delight, and would be near
where, Lord, thy grace does dwell.
9
O shut not up my soul with them
in sin that take their fill:
Nor yet my life among those men
that seek much blood to spill,
10
Whose hands are heapt with craft and guile
wherewith their lives abound;
And their right hand do bribes defile,
and baseness there I found.
11
But I in righteousness intend
my time and days to serve:
Have mercy Lord, and me defend,
so that I do not swerve:
12
My foot is staid for all assaies,
it stands well and right:
Wherefore to God will I give praise
in all the peoples sight.
PSALM. XXVII. the C.
THe Lord is both my life and light,
shall man make me dismayed?
Since God does give me strength and mig^^
why should I be afraid?
4
One thing of God I do desire,
that he would not deny:
For which I ask and do inquire,
and that continually:
5
That I within his holy place
my life throughout may dwell:
To see the beauty of his face,
and view his Temple well.
7
Lord, hear the voice of my request,
for which to thee I call;
Have mercy, Lord, on me oppressed,
and send me aid withal.
10
My heart does echo unto thee,
I sue to have thy grace;
Then seek my face, said thou to me,
Lord, I will seek thy face.
11
In wrath turn not away thy face,
nor suffer me to slide:
Thou art my God unto this day,
be still my God and guide.
12
My parents both forsook their son,
and cast me off together;
But God took care when they had done,
a better friend then either.
Wait on the Lord courageously,
he is thy strength and stay,
Thy heart with faith to fortify,
wait on the Lord, I say.
PSALM. XXVIII. I. M. *
THou art O, Lord, my strength and stay,
the succor which I crave:
Neglect me not, lest I be like
to them that go to grave.
2
The supplications of my heart,
O Lord attend and mark;
When I lift up my humble hands,
unto thy holy Ark.
3
With wicked doers of wickedness
O give me not my part:
That speak right fair unto their friends,
while mischief fills their heart,
4
According to their handy work,
as they deserve indeed;
And after their inventions vile,
so let these sinners speed.
5
For nothing they regard Gods works,
nor what his hands have wrought;
Therefore will he destroy them quite,
and bring them all to naught.
6
To render thanks un to the Lord,
how great a cause have I:
My voice, my prayer and my complaint
that heard so lovingly?
7
He is my shield and fortitude,
my buckler in distress:
My hope, my help, my hearts desire,
my song shall so confess.
8
He is our strength and our defense,
our enemies to repel:
The saving health of his elect,
the anointed Israel.
9
Thy people and thine heritage,
Lord, bless, guide and preserve:
Increase them, Lord, and rule their hearts,
that they may never swerve.
PSALM. XXX. 1. M. ***
ALl laud and praise with heart and voice,
O Lord, I give to thee:
Thou have not made my foes rejoice,
but have exalted me.
2
O Lord my God to thee I cride,
in all my pain and grief:
Thou gav'st an ear, and did provide,
to ease me with relief.
3
Of thy good will thou have called back
my soul from hell to save:
Thou did revive when strength did lack,
and keptst me from the grave.
4
Sing praise, ye Saints, that prove and see
the goodness of the Lord:
In memory of his Majesty
rejoice with one accord.
5
His anger lasts but a space,
and quickly slakes again:
But in his favor and his grace
does constant life remain.
Though gripes of grief and pangs of pain
shall lodge with us all night;
The Lord shall bring us joy again,
before the morning light.
6
When I enjoyed the world at will,
thus would I boast and say,
Tush, I am sure to feel no ill,
this wealth shall not decay:
7
For thou, O Lord, of thy good grace
had sent me strength and aid:
But when thou turn'dst away thy face,
my mind was sore dismayed.
8
Wherefore again yet did I cry
to thee, O Lord, of might:
My God with plaints I did apply,
and prayed both day and night.
9
What gain is in my blood (said I)
if death destroy my days?
Does dust declare thy Majesty?
does dust thy justice praise?
10
Wherefore, my God, some pity take,
O Lord, I pray to thee:
Do not this simple soul forsake,
but help and succor me.
11
Then did thou turn my misery
into a cheerful voice:
The mourning weed thou took'st from me,
and made me to rejoice.
12
Wherefore my soul uncessantly
shall sing unto thy praise:
My Lord my God, to thee will I
give laud and thanks always.
PSALM. XXXI. 1. ^ *
O Lord, I put my trust in thee,
let nothing work me shame;
As thou art just deliver me,
and quit me, Lord, from blame.
2
Hear me, O Lord, and that anon,
to help me make good speed:
Be thou my rock and house of stone,
my fence in time of need.
3
For lo, O Lord, thy strength is tried,
thou art my fort and tower:
For thy Names sake be thou my guide,
and lead me in thy power.
4
Pluck thou my feet out of the snare,
which they for me have laid:
Thou art my strength, and all my care
is for thy only aid.
5
Into thy hands, Lord, I commit
my spirit, which is thy due:
Thou only have redeemed it,
O Lord my God most true.
6
I hate such folk as will not part
from things to be abhorred:
When they on trifles set their heart,
my trust is in the Lord.
7
And in the mercy I will joy,
I see it does excel:
Thou see when ought would me anoy,
and know my foul full well.
15
The length of all my life and age
O Lord, is in thy hand:
Defend me from the wrathful rage
of them that me withstand.
16
To me thy servant (Lord) express,
and show thy joyful face:
And save me for thy righteousness:
thy mercy and thy grace.
PSALM. XXXI. 2. Coll. ***
16
O Lord, how great felicity
have thou laid up for them,
That fear thy Name, and trust in thee
before the sons of men?
20
Thy presence shall them fence and guide,
from all proud brags and wrongs:
Within thy house thou shall them hide,
from all the strife of tongues.
21
Thanks to the Lord that has declared
on me his grace so far,
Me to defend with watch and ward,
as in a town of war.
22
Thus did I say both day and night,
when I was sore oppressed:
Lo, I am clean cast out of sight,
yet heardst thou my request.
23
Ye saints, love ye the Lord, I say,
the faithful he does guide:
And to the proud he does repay
according to their pride.
24
Be strong, and God shall stay your heart,
be confident, ye just:
For sure the Lord will take your part,
since ye on him do trust.
PSALM. XXXII. 2. M. *
THe man is blessed whose wickedness
is covered and hid.
The man is blessed whom God forgives
what ever sins he did.
2
And blessed is he to whom the Lord
imputes not offense;
Which in his heart has hid no guile,
nor hardened impudence.
3
For whilst that I kept silence still,
and sought to hide my sin,
My bones did wear and waste away
with pain that I was in.
4
For night and day thy hand on me,
did so oppress my heart,
That all my blood and humors moist
to dryness did convert.
5
I did therefore confess my faults,
and all my sins discover:
Then thou, O Lord, did me forgive,
and all my sins pass over.
6
The humble man shall pray therefore,
to thee in happiest hour;
So that the floods of waters great,
on him shall have no power.
7
When trouble and adversity,
do compass me about;
Thou art my refuge and my joy,
and thou do help me out.
8
Come hither, I will teach to thee
the paths of piety;
And I will guide thee carefully,
with mine observant eye.
9
Be not so rude and ignorant
as is the horse and mule,
Whose mouth without a rain or bit
from harm thou can not rule.
10
The wicked man shall wail in woe,
and greatest griefs sustain;
But unto him that trusts in God,
much mercy shall remain.
11
Be joyful therefore in the Lord,
ye just lift up your voice;
And ye of pure and perfect heart,
be glad and much rejoice.
PSALM. XXXIII. 1. Col. *
YE righteous in the Lord rejoice,
it is a seemly sight;
That upright men with thankful voice,
should praise the Lord of might.
3
Sing to the Lord, and give him praise
with joyful songs and new,
For lo, his word, his works and ways
are perfect, just and true.
5
To judgment, equity and right
he has a great good will;
And with his gifts he does delight,
the spacious earth to fill.
7
The waters of the seas he keeps,
confined within the shore;
He lays up the liquid deeps
as in an house of store.
10
The counsels of the nations rude,
the Lord does bring to naught:
He does defeat the multitude
of their device and thought.
11
But his decrees continue still,
they never slack nor swage;
The motions of his mind and will,
take place from age to age.
The second Collect. **
12
BLessed are they to whom the Lord,
as God and guide is known;
Whom he does choose of mere accord,
to take them as his own.
13
The Lord from heaven cast his eye,
on men of mortal birth;
Considering from his seat on high,
all dwellers on the earth.
16
A King that trusts in his host,
thereby shall not prevail;
The mighty man, whose strength is most,
for all his strength shall fail.
17
An horse for safety of a man,
is to be reckoned vain;
By strength of horse none ever can
deliverance obtain.
18
But lo, the eyes of God attend,
to shield and save the just,
And all that fear for to offend,
and in his mercy trust.
20
Wherefore our souls have confidence
in God our strength and stay:
He is our shield and our defense,
to drive all darts away.
22
Now therefore let thy goodness, Lord,
still present with us be,
As we do still with one accord
repose our trust in thee.
PSALM. XXXIIII. 1. C. ***
I Will give laud and honor both
unto the Lord always:
My moving tongue for evermore,
shall speak unto his praise.
2
I do delight to laud the Lord
in heart, in soul, and voice:
That mortified and humble men
may hear, and so rejoice.
3
Therefore see that ye magnify,
with me, the living Lord:
And let us now exalt his Name,
and all with one accord.
4
For I my self besought the Lord,
he answered me again:
And graciously delivered me
from all my fear and pain.
5
Who so they be that him behold,
shall see his light most clear,
Their countenance shall not be dashed,
they never need to fear.
6
Poor David cried unto the Lord,
the Lord did hear his call;
The Lord did hear and help him too
out of his troubles all.
7
The Angel of the Lord does pitch
his tents about them round:
To save all such as fear the Lord,
and keep them safe and sound.
8
Taste and consider well therefore,
that God's a gracious one:
O happy man that trusts in him,
and even in him alone.
PSALM. XXXIIII. 2. C. **
14
TUrn back thy face from doing ill,
and do the godly deed:
Inquire for peace and quietness,
and follow it with speed.
15
For lo, the eyes of God above
upon the just are bent:
His ears likewise do hear the plaint
of all the innocent.
16
But he does frown and bend his brows
upon the wicked train:
And cuts from earth their memory,
that none of them remain.
17
But when the just do call and cry,
the Lord does hear them so,
That out of pain and misery
he lets them timely go.
18
The Lord is kind and straight at hand
to such as are contrite:
He also saves the sorrowful,
and humbled in his sight.
19
Full many be the miseries
of just and righteous men:
But out of all adversities
the Lord delivers them.
21
But sin shall slay the wicked man,
which he himself has wrought;
And such as hate the righteous man,
shall soon be brought to naught.
22
But them that fear the living Lord,
he keeps safe and sound:
And such as put their trust in him,
no malice shall confound.
PSALM. XXXV. the C. **
LOrd plead my cause against my foes,
confound their force and might:
Fight on my part against all those,
that seek with me to fight.
2
Lay hold upon the spear and shield,
thy self in armor dress:
Stand up for me, and fight the field,
to help me from distress.
3
Gird on thy sword, and stop the way,
mine enemies to withstand:
Unto my soul be pleased to say,
I am thy help at hand.
4
Confound them with rebuke and blame,
that seek my soul to kill:
Let them turn back and flee with shame,
that seek to work me ill.
9
Let all their ways be void of light,
and slippery like to fall,
And send thine Angel with thy might,
to persecute them all.
7
And then my bones shall speak and say,
my parts shall all agree:
O Lord, what power do thou display,
what man is like to thee?
PSALM. XXXVI. 1. M. ***
THe wicked with his works unjust,
does thus persuade my heart.
He serves not God, he serves his lust,
and sets Gods fear apart.
2
Yet does he joy in his estate,
to walk as he began:
So long till he deserves the hate,
the hate of God and man.
3
His words are wicked, vile, and naught,
his tongue no truth does tell:
Yet at no hand will he be taught
which way he may do well.
4
When he should sleep, then does he muse
his mischiefs to fulfill:
No wicked ways does he refuse,
nor nothing that is ill,
5
But Lord thy goodness does ascend
above the heavens hie,
So does thy truth it self extend
unto the starry sky.
6
Much more then hills so high and steep,
thy justice is expressed:
Thy judgments like to seas most deep,
thou sav'st both man and beast.
7
Thy mercy is above all things,
O God, it does excel:
In trust whereof, as in thy wings,
the sons of men shall dwell.
8
Within thy house they shall be fed
with plenty at their will:
Of all delights they shall be sped,
and take thereof their fill.
9
For lo, the well of life so pure
does ever flow from thee:
And in thy light we shall be sure
the lasting light to see.
10
From such as thee desire to know,
let not thy grace depart:
Thy righteousness declare and show
to men of upright heart.
11
Let not the proud on me prevail,
O Lord, of thy good grace:
Nor let the wicked me assail,
to throw me out of place.
12
But they in their device shall fall,
that wicked works maintain:
They shall be overthrown withal,
and never rise again.
PSALM. XXXVII. the Coll. **
34
VVAit thou on God and keep his way,
he shall preserve thee then
The earth to rule, and thou shall see
destroyed these wicked men.
35
The wicked have I seen most strong,
and placed in high degree:
Flourishing in all wealth and store,
as does the Lawrell-tree.
36
But suddenly he past away,
and lo, he was quite gone:
I sought him then, but could not find
the place where dwelt such one.
37
Mark and behold the perfect man,
how God does him increase:
For righteous men shall have at length
great joy, with rest and peace.
38
As for transgressors, woe to them,
together they shall fall;
God will cut off ungodly men,
and judge them once for all.
39
But the salvation of the just
does come from God above:
Who in their trouble sends them aid,
of his mere grace and love.
40
But sure the Lord will bless and keep,
the righteous and the just,
From hands of lewd and wicked men,
because in him they trust.
PSALM. XXXIX. 1. M. 1. part. *
I Said I will look to my ways,
for fear I should go wrong:
I will take thee, lest I offend
with rashness of my tongue.
2
As with a bridle I will keep
my mouth with all my might:
Not once to whisper all the while,
the wicked are in sight.
3
I held my tongue, and spoke no word,
but kept me close and still:
Yea, from good talk I did refrain,
but sore against my will.
4
My heart waxt hot within my breast,
with musing, thought, and doubt:
Which did increase and stir the fire,
at last these words burst out,
5
Lord, number out my life and days
which yet I have not past:
So that I may be certifi'd
how long my life shall last.
6
Lord, thou have pointed out my life,
in length much like a span:
Mine age is nothing unto thee,
so vain is every man.
7
Man, surely, walks in vainest show,
and does himself anoy
In getting goods, and cannot tell
who shall the same enjoy.
8
Now, Lord, since things this wise do frame,
what help do I desire?
In truth my help does hang on thee,
I nothing else require.
M. 1. The second part. *
9
FRom all the sins that I have done,
Lord, quit me out of hand:
And make me not a scorn to fools
that nothing understand.
10
I was as dumb, and to complain
no trouble might me move:
Because I knew it was thy work,
my patience for to prove.
11
Lord, take from me thy scourge and plague,
I can them not withstand:
I faint and pine away for fear
of thy most heavy hand.
12
When thou for sin do man rebuke,
he waxes pale and wan?
And like a cloth that moths have fret:
so vain a thing is man.
13
Lord, hear my suit, and give good heed,
regard my tears that fall:
I sojourn like a stranger here,
as did my fathers all.
14
O spare a little, give me space
my strength for to restore:
Before I go away from hence,
and shall be seen no more.
PSALM. XL. 1. Col. ***
I Waited long and sought the Lord,
and patiently did bear:
At length to me he did accord,
my voice and cry to hear.
2
He plucked me from the lake so deep,
out of the mire and clay:
And on a rock he set my feet,
and he did guide my way.
3
To me he taught a Psalm of praise,
which I must show abroad:
And sing new songs of thanks always
unto the Lord our God.
4
When all the folk these things shall see,
they shall be much afraid:
And fearing, to the Lord will flee,
and trust upon his aid.
5
O blessed is he, whose hope and heart
does in the Lord remain:
That with the proud does take no part,
nor such as lie and fain.
6
For Lord my God, thy wondrous deeds
in greatness far surmount:
Thy favor toward us exceeds
all things that we can count.
7
When I intend and do devise
thy works abroad to show:
To such a reckning they do rise,
thereof no end I know.
8
Burnt-offrings thou delightest not in,
it is not thy desire:
With sacrifice to purge his sin,
thou do of none require.
9
Offerings likewise and sacrifice
thou would not have at all:
But thou have boar'd mine ears (O Lord)
to hearken to thy call.
The second Collect. *
12
THy justice and thy righteousness
in great resorts I tell:
Behold, my tongue no time does cease,
O Lord, thou know full well.
14
I kept not close thy loving mind,
that no man should it know:
The trust that in thy truth I find,
to all the Church I show.
15
Thy tender mercy (Lord) from me
withdraw thou not away,
But let thy love and verity
preserve me day by day.
16
For O, with mischiefs many a one
full sore beset am I:
My sins increase, and so come on,
I even droop and die.
18
With speed send help and set me free,
O Lord, to thee I pray:
Make haste to aid and succor me,
and do not say me nay.
19
Let them sustain rebuke and shame,
that seek my soul to kill:
Drive back my foes, and blast their fame,
whoever wish me ill.
23
For, Lord, thou art my hope and trust,
my refuge, help and stay:
Wherefore, my God, as thou art just,
with me no time delay.
PSALM. XLI. the Col. *
THe man is blessed that minds the poor
and is a cheerful giver:
For in the season perilous
the Lord will him deliver.
2
The Lord will make him safe and sound,
and happy in the land:
And he will not deliver him
into his enemies hand.
3
And, in his bed when he lies sick,
the Lord will him restore:
And thou, O Lord, wilt turn to health
his sickness and his sore.
4
Then in my sickness thus say I,
have mercy, Lord, on me:
And heal my sick and sinful soul,
that has offended thee.
PSALM. XLII. the Col. *
LIke as the Heart does breathe and bray,
the well-springs to obtain:
So does my soul desire, and pray
to see Gods house again.
2
My soul does thirst, and would draw near
the living God to see:
O when, my God, shall I appear,
and in thy presence be?
5
The tears all times are my repast,
which from mine eyes to slide,
While wicked men cry out so fast,
where now is God thy guide?
4
Alas^ what grief is it to think
what freedom once I had?
Therefore my soul begins to sink,
and is exceeding sad.
When I did march in good array,
and furnished with my train:
Unto the Temple was our way,
With many a pleasant strain.
5
Now then my soul; why art thou sad,
and fre^st so in my breast?
Hope still for help that may be had,
and grace from God expressed.
12
And trust thou in the Lord always,
and thou the time shalt^ see
To give him honor, thanks and praise,
for health restored to thee.
PSALM. XLIII. 2. M. *
Judge and revenge my cause, O Lord,
from them that evil be:
From wicked and deceitful men,
O Lord, deliver me.
2
For of my strength thou art the God,
why do thou leave me so?
And why walk I so heavily
oppressed with my so?
3
Send out thy light and blessed truth,
and lead me with thy grace:
And so conduct me to thy hill,
and to thy dwelling place.
4
Then shall I to the Altar go,
of God my joy of heart:
And on my harp give thanks to thee,
O God, my God that art.
5
Why art thou then so sad my soul,
and fretst thus in my breast?
Still trust in God, for him to praise,
I hold it always best.
6
By him I have deliverance,
against all pain and grief:
He is my God, which does always
at need send me relief.
PSALM. XLV. 1. M. 1. p. Have mercy,
MY heart does take in hand,
a godly song to sing,
The praise that I shall show therein,
pertains to the King^
2
My tongue shall be as quick,
his honor to indite,
As is the pen of any scribe,
that uses fast to write.
3
O fairest of all men,
thy speech is pleasant pure:
For God has blessed thee with gifts,
for ever to endure.
4
About thee gird thy sword,
O prince of might elect:
With glory, honor, and renown
thy person pure is decked.
5
Go forth with prospr'ous speed,
with meekness, truth and right:
And thy right hand shall teach thee things,
that are of dreadful might.
6
T^ine arrows sharp, and keen
their hearts so sore shall sting:
That folk shall come and kneel to thee,
yea, all thy foes, O King.
6
Thy royal seat, O Lord,
for ever shall remain:
Because the Scepter of thy might
does righteousness maintain,
8
Because thou love the right,
and do the ill detest,
Has God thy God anointed thee
with joy, above the rest.
9
With myrrh and savours sweet
thou art perfumed and clad,
When thou do from thy palace pass,
thereby to make thee glad.
10
Kings Daughters are among,
thy noble concubines:
At thy right hand the Queen her self,
in gold of Ophir shines.
The second part. ***
11
O Daughter take good heed,
incline and give good ear:
Thou must forsake thy kindred all,
and fathers house most dear.
12
Then shall the King desire
thy beauty fair and trim:
For lo, he is the Lord thy God,
and thou must worship him.
13
The daughters then of Tire,
with gifts full rich to see,
And all the wealthy of the land^
shall make their suit to thee.
14
The daughter of the King^
is glorious to behold:
With inward glory glittering,
and decked in beaten gold.
15
In robes of needle work,
and many a pleasant thing:
With virgins fair on her to wait,
she comes to the King.
16
Thus are they brought with joy,
and mirth on every side:
Into the palace of King,
and there they do abide.
17
In stead of parents left,
(O Queen, the case so stands)
Thou shall have sons, whom thou may set
as Princes in the lands.
18
Wherefore thy holy Name,
all ages shall record:
The people shall give thanks to thee,
for evermore, O Lord.
PSALM. XLVI. 1. M. *
THe Lord is our defense and aid,
the strength whereby we stand:
When we with woe are much dismayed
he is our help at hand.
2
Though the earth remove we will not fear,
though hills so high and steep
Be tumbled headlong here and there,
within the sea so deep.
3
No, though the waves do rage so sore,
that all the banks it drown:
And though it overflow the shore,
and beat the mountains down:
4
For Shilohs river sends abroad
his pleasant streams apace:
To glad the City of our God,
and wash his holy place.
5
In midst of her the Lord does dwell,
she can no whit decay:
All things against her that rebel,
the Lord will take away.
6
The heathen folk the kingdoms fear,
the people make a noise;
The earth does melt, and not appear,
when God puts forth his voice.
7
The Lord of hosts does take our part,
to us he has an eye:
Our hope of health with all our heart
on Jacobs God does lie.
8
^^ome see, and let your eyes be taught
the working of our God:
What wonders he himself has wrought
in all the world abroad.
9
By him all wars are hus^^t and gone,
which countries did conspire:
Their bows he brake, and spears each one,
their chariots burnt with fire.
10
Leave off therefore (says he) and know
that I am God and guide:
Among the heathen high and low
will I be magnified.
11
The Lord of hosts does us defend,
he is our strength and tower:
On Jacobs God we do depend,
and on his mighty power.
PSALM. XLIX. the Coll. **
ALl people hearken and give ear,
to that, that I shall tell:
2
Both high and low, both rich and poor,
that in the world do dwell.
5
Why should I fear affliction,
or any careful toil:
Or else my foes that follow me,
and seek my soul to spoil?
6
For as for such as riches have,
wherein their trust is most;
And they which of their treasures great,
themselves do brag and boast:
7
There is not one of them that can,
his brothers soul redeem:
Or that can give a price to God,
sufficient in esteem.
8
It is too great a price to pay,
none can thereto attain:
Or that he might his life prolong,
or not in grave remain.
10
Their care is to build houses fair,
and so determine sure,
To make their name right great on earth,
for ever to endure.
13
But tho they speak their foolish thoughts,
which are most lewd and vain;
Their children yet approve their talk,
and in like sin remain.
14
As sheep are brought into the fold,
so shall they go to grave:
Devoured by death, till day shall dawn,
and just men lordship have.
Their image and their royal port
shall fade and soon decay:
When as from house to grave they go^
with mourning all the way.
15
But surely God will me preserve
from death and endless pain;
Because he will receive my soul,
and I shall live again.
17
If any man wax wondrous rich,
fear not, I say, therefore;
Although the glory of his house,
increases more and more.
18
For when he dies and sleeps in dust,
no good shall he receive;
His glory will not follow him,
his pomp will take her leave.
19
Yet in this life he takes himself
the happiest under Sun:
And others flatter him, and say,
that all was bravely done.
20
And presuppose he live as long,
as did his fathers old,
Yet must he needs at length be brought
to deaths devouring fold.
Thus man to honor God has called,
yet he considers not;
But is compared to the beasts,
which quickly die and rot.
PSALM. L. the Col. Have mercy. **
14
GIve to the Lord his praise,
with thanks to him apply:
And see thou pay thy vows always
to God that is most hie,
15
Then seek and sue to me,
in any dangerous days,
And I will sure deliver thee,
and thou shall give me praise.
16
But to the wicked train,
which talk of God each day:
And yet their works are foul and vain,
to them the Lord will say,
17
With what face dare thou
my word once speak or name?
Why does thy talk my law allow?
thy deeds deny the same.
18
Whereas thy life to mend
thou art so slow and slack:
My word, the which thou do pretend,
is cast behind thy back:
19
When thou a thief do see,
by theft to live in wealth:
With him thou runn'st, and do agree
likewise to thrive by stealth.
20
When thou do them behold,
that wives and maids defile:
Thou like it well, and waxest bold,
to use that life most vile.
21
Thy lips thou do apply
to stander and defame:
Thy tongue is taught, and learns to lie,
and still does use the same.
22
Thou studiest to revile
thy friends to thee so near:
Thy tongue with slander does defile
thy mothers son most dear.
23
Hereat while I do wink,
as though I did not see:
Thou go on still, and so do think
that I am like to thee.
24
But sure I will not let
to strike when I begin:
Thy faults in order I will set,
and open all thy sin.
25
Mark this I you require,
that have not God in mind:
Left when I plague you in mine ire,
your help be far to find.
26
But he that gives me praise,
he glorifieth me:
And he that walks in godly ways,
shall Gods salvation see.
PSALM. LI. 1. M. 1. part.
O Lord consider my distress,
And now with speed some pity take,
My sins remit, my woes redress,
Good Lord, for thy great mercies sake.
2
Wash me, O Lord, and make me clean
From this unjust and sinful act:
And purify yet once again
My heinous crime and bloody fact.
3
Remorse and sorrow do constrain,
And force me to confess my sin:
Before my face they still remain
As fresh as first they did begin.
4
For thee alone I have contem'd,
Committing evil in thy sight:
And if I were therefore condemned,
Yet were thy judgments just and right.
5
Behold, O Lord, for thou do know,
That I was bred and born in sin:
My mother has conceived me so,
Yet I vile wretch remain therein,
6
Also behold, Lord, thou do love
The inward truth of hearts sincere:
And grace and wisdom from above,
Thou have revealed within me there.
7
If thou with hysop purge this blot,
I shall be clearer then the glass:
And if thou wash away my spot,
The snow in whiteness shall I pass.
8
Therefore, O Lord, such succor send,
That I may feel some joy within:
And that my strength may now amend,
Which thou have weakened for my sin.
9
Turn back thy face and frowning ire,
For I have felt enough thy hand:
And purge my sins, I thee desire,
Which do in number pass the sand.
10
Make new my heart within my breast,
And frame it to thy holy will:
And let me have a constant guest,
Of thy sweet Spirit in me still.
1. M. The second part.
11
CAst me not, Lord, out from thy face,
But speedily my torments end:
Take not from me thy Spirit of grace,
Which may from dangers me defend.
12
Restore me to those joys again,
Which I was wont in thee to find:
And thy free Spirit let me retain,
To stablish much my heart and mind.
13
Thus when I shall thy mercies know,
I shall admonish those that sin:
And men that are likewise brought low,
By mine example shall come in.
14
O God, that of my health art Lord,
Forgive me this my bloody crime:
My heart and tongue shall then accord
To sing thy righteousness divine.
15
Touch thou my lips, my tongue untie,
O Lord, that have the only key:
And then my mouth shall testify
Thy wondrous works and praise always.
16
And as for outward sacrifice,
I would have offered many a one:
Had they been valued in thine eyes,
But therein pleasure take thou none.
17
The heavy heart, the mind oppressed,
O Lord, thou never do despise:
And verily it is the best,
The best of all the sacrifice.
18
Lord, unto Sion turn thy face,
Pour down thy mercies on thy hill:
And on Jerusalem thy grace,
Build up the walls, and love it still.
19
Our offerings then thou shall accept,
And whole burnt^ offerings shall be pai'd;
In righteousness observed and kept,
And on thy holy altars laid.
PSALM. LII. 1. M. *
Why do thou, tyrant, boast abroad,
thy wicked works to praise?
Do thou not know there is a God,
whose mercies last always?
2
Why does thy mind yet still devise,
such wicked wiles to warp?
Thy tongue untrue in forging lies,
is like a razour sharp.
3
On mischief why setst thou thy mind,
and wilt not walk upright?
Thou have more mind false tales to find,
then bring the truth to light.
4
Thou do delight in fraud and guile,
in mischief, blood and wrong:
Thy lips have learned the flattering style,
O false deceitful tongue.
5
Therefore shall God for aye confound,
and pluck thee from thy place:
Root out thy seed even from the ground,
and ruin all thy race.
6
The just, when they behold thy fall,
with fear will praise the Lord,
And in reproach of thee withal,
cry out with one accord,
7
Behold the man that would not take
the Lord for his defense:
But of his goods his god did make,
and sin his confidence.
8
But I an Olive fresh and green,
shall spring and spread abroad:
Because my trust all times has been
upon the living God.
9
For this therefore will I give praise
to thee with heart and voice:
I will set forth thy Name always,
wherein thy Saints rejoice.
PSALM. LV. the Col. *
O Lord my God, give ear to me,
and hear when I do pray:
And when to thee I call and cry,
hide not thy self away.
2
Take heed to me, grant my request,
and answer me again:
With plaints I pray full sore oppressed,
great grief does me constrain.
3
Because my foes with threats and cries,
oppress me through despite:
The workers of iniquities,
to vex me have delight.
4
My heart does faint for want of breath,
it pants in my breast:
The terrors and the dread of death,
do take away my rest.
5
Divide them, Lord, and from them pull
their devilish double tongue;
For I have spide their city full
of rapine, strife and wrong.
6
If that my foes did seek my shame,
I might it well abide:
From open enemies check and blame,
some where I could me hide.
7
But thou it wast, my fellow dear,
which friendship did pretend,
And did my secret counsel hear,
as my familiar friend.
8
But I unto my God will cry,
to him for help I flee:
The Lord will help me by and by,
and he will succor me.
9
At morning, noon, and evening tide,
unto the Lord I pray:
When I so instantly have cride,
he does not say me nay.
PSALM. LVI. the Col. *
HAve mercy, Lord, on me I pray,
for man would me devour:
He fights with me day by day,
and troubles me each hour.
3
When they would make me most afraid
with boasts and brags of pride,
I trust in thee alone for aid,
therefore I shall not slide.
4
Gods promise I do mind, and praise,
O Lord I stick to thee:
I care not what proud flesh assaies,
what man can do to me.
6
What things I either did or spoke,
they wrested at their will;
And all the counsel that they take,
is how to work me ill.
6
Shall they escape by mischief still:
thou, God, upon them frown;
And, in thine anger terrible,
Lord, cast their Kingdom down.
8
Thou see how often they made me flee,
and on my tears do look;
Reserve them in a glass by thee,
and write them in thy book.
9
When I do call upon thy Name
my foes do faint and fly:
God takes my part, I know the same,
I know it, Lord, thereby.
11
I trust in God, and therefore say,
as I before began,
The Lord is my defense and stay,
I do not care for man.
12
I will perform, with heart so free,
to God, my vows always:
And I, O Lord, will offer thee,
perpetual thanks and praise.
PSALM. LVII. the Col. **
TAke pity for thy promise sake,
have mercy, Lord, on me:
Now does my soul it self betake
to seek for help from thee.
2
I call upon the Lord most hie,
to whom I stick and stand:
I mean the God that will stand by
the cause I have in hand.
4
I lead my life with lions fell,
enraged with rash desire:
And with such wicked men I dwell,
that fret like flames of fire.
6
They lay their net, and do prepare
a privy cave and pit,
Wherein they think my soul to snare,
but they are fallen in it.
8
Awake my joy, awake, I say,
my harp and every string,
For I will rise before the day
Gods praises for to sing^
10
His mercy^doth extend as far
as heaven it self is hie:
His truth as high as any Star,
that stands in the sky.
11
Set forth and show thy self, O God,
above the heavens bright:
Extol thy praise on earth abroad,
thy Majesty and might,
The Collect. *
O Lord thou did us clean forsake,
and scatteredst us abroad:
Such great displeasure thou did take,
return to us, O God.
2
Thy might did move the earth so sore,
that it in sunder brake:
The hurt thereof, O Lord, restore,
for it does bow and quake.
3
With heavy wrath thou plaguest thus
the people that are thine:
And thou have given unto us^
a drink of giddy wine.
4
But yet to such as fear thy Name,
a banner thou did show,
That truth may triumph in the same,
because thy word is so.
11
Give aid, O Lord, and help us then
from wrongs that we sustain;
For sure the help of mortal men
is altogether vain.
12
But through our God we shall have might
to take great things in hand:
He will tread down and put to flight
our enemies that withstand.
The Collect.
REgard O Lord, when I complain,
and make my moan to thee,
Let not my prayer ascend in vain:
but give good ear to me.
2
From earths unknown and utmost part,
even where no paths are trod,
In grief and anguish of my heart,
I cry to thee, O God.
3
Upon the rock of thy great power,
my woeful mind repose:
Thou art my hope, my fort and tower,
my fence against my foes.
4
Within thy tents I choose to dwell,
and (dwelling) to endure,
Beneath thy wings I know right well,
I shall be sa^e and sure.
5
The vows that do my soul engage
the Lord was pleased to hear,
Thou gav'st to me the heritage
of them that do thee fear.
8
So I shall sing for ever still,
the praises of thy Name,
That all my vows I may fulfill,
and daily pay the same.
The Collect.
MY soul to God shall give good heed^
and him ^lone attend:
For why, my health and hope to speed
does whole on him depend.
6
He is my rock, my fort and tower,
my health is of his grace:
He does support me, that no power
can move me out of place.
8
O have your hope in him always,
ye folk with one accord:
Pour out your hearts to him, and say,
our trust is in the Lord.
9
The sons of men are vanity,
so found, if they be waigh'd,
Mean men a toy, great men a lie,
if in the balance laid.
10
Trust not in robbery, wrong, and steal
let vain desires be gone:
Though goods well got flow in with weal
set not your hearts thereon.
11
The Lord long since one thing did tell
which here to mind I call:
He spoke it often, I heard it well,
that God alone does all.
12
And that thou, Lord, art good and kind,
thy mercy does exceed.
So that all sorts with thee shall find,
according to their deed.
PSALM. LXIII. 1. M.*
O God my God, I wake betime,
to come to thee in haste:
For sure, my soul and body both
do thirst of thee to taste.
And in this barren wilderness,
where waters there are none:
My flesh is parched for want of thee,
for thee I wish alone.
2
That I might see yet once again,
thy glory, strength and might,
As I was wont to see the same
within thy Temple bright.
3
For sure, thy mercies far surmount
this life and wretched days:
My lips therefore shall give to thee
due honor, laud and praise.
4
I will not fail to worship thee,
while I may live a day,
And in thy Name lift up my hands
devoutly when I pray.
5
My soul is filled and satisfied,
with marrow fat and sweet,
My mouth shall join with joyful lip,
in both thy praise shall meet,
6
When as in bed I think on thee,
and meditate all night:
7
For under covert of thy wings
I hide me with delight.
8
My soul does press hard after thee,
thy right hand is my power.
9
And them that seek my soul to slay,
shall death and hell devour.
10
The sword shall slay them every one,
their carcases shall feed
The hungry fox^s, which do run
their prey to seek at need.
11
The king and all men shall rejoice,
that do Gods word profess:
And liars mouths shall then be stop^,
for their unrighteousness.
PSALM. LXIIII. 1. M. *
O Lord unto my voice give ear,
with plaints when I do pray:
And rid my life and soul from fear
of foes that threat to slay.
2
Defend me from that sort of men,
which in deceit do lurk;
And from the frowning face of them
that all ill things do work.
3
Who whet their tongues, as we have seen
men whet and sharp their swords:
They shoot abroad their arrows keen,
I mean most bitter words.
4
With secret fleight they shoot their shaft,
the upright man to hit:
The just unwares they strike by craft,
and do not fear a whit.
5
By wickedness encouraged,
in counsel thus they cry,
To use deceit let us not dread,
for who can it epsy?
6
What way to hurt they talk and muse,
all times within their heart:
They all consult what wiles to use,
each does invent his part.
7
But yet all this shall not avail,
when they think least upon,
God with his dart shall sure assail,
and wound them every one.
8
Their crafts, and evil tongues and all,
shall work themselves such shame,
That they which then behold their fall,
shall tremble at the same.
9
Then all that see, shall weigh right well
what works the Lord has wrought,
And joyfully declare and tell
what he to pass has brought.
10
Yet shall the just in God rejoice,
still trusting in his might:
So shall they joy with mind and voice,
whose heart is pure and right.
PSALM. LXV. 1. Col. ***
THy praise alone, O Lord, does reign,
in Sion thine own hill:
Their vows to thee they do maintain,
and readily fulfill.
2
Thou art the God that hear prayers,
And there is none but thou:
Therefore all flesh to thee repairs,
and every knee does bow.
3
Our wicked life so far exceeds,
that we should fall therein:
But, Lord, forgive our great misdeeds,
and purge us from our sin.
4
The man is blessed, whom thou do choose
within thy courts to dwell;
Thy house and temple he shall use,
with pleasures that excel.
7
The swelling seas thou do assuage,
and make their streams full still;
Thou do restrain the peoples rage,
and rule them at thy will.
8
The folk that dwell full far on earth,
shall dread thy signs to see;
The day begins and ends with mirth,
and both with praise to thee.
The second Collect. ***
WHen that the earth is chapt and dry,
and thirsts more and more:
Then store of rain thou do apply,
and much increase her store.
9
The flood of God does overflow,
and causes corn to spring,
The seed, I say, which men do sow,
for he does guide the thing.
10
With wet thou do her furrows fill,
whereby her clod^ do fall:
Thy drops on her thou do distill,
and bless her fruit withal.
11
Thou deckst the earth, of thy good grace,
with fair and pleasant crop:
The clouds distill their dews apace,
great plenty they do drop:
12
Whereby the desert shall begin,
full great increase to bring:
The little hills shall joy therein,
much fruit in them shall spring.
13
In places plain the flocks do feed,
and cover all the earth:
The vales with corn do so exceed,
they sing and shout for mirth.
PSALM. LXVI. 1. Col. ***
YE men on earth in God rejoice,
set forth his power and same;
Extol his might with heart and voice,
and glorify his Name.
2
How wonderful, O Lord, say ye,
in all thy works thou art?
Thy foes for fear shall seek to thee,
tho with a feigning heart.
3
All folk come forth, behold and see
what things the Lord has wrought and
Mark well the wondrous works that he
for man to pass has brought.
5
He laid the Seas as heaps on high,
therein a way they had,
To pass on foot both fair and dry,
whereof our hearts were glad.
6
His might does rule the world always,
his eyes do all behold:
And all that dare to disobey,
by him shall be controlled.
7
Ye people give unto our God
due laud and thanks always:
With joyful voice declare abroad,
and sing unto his praise.
PSALM. LXVI. Col. 2.*
9
THe Lord does prove our deeds with fire,
if that they will abide,
As workmen do, when they desire
to have their silver tried.
10
Thou broughtst us, Lord, into the snare,
and in the snare we stick:
Our loins did great afflictions bear,
thou lay'st them on so thick.
11
And thou did also suffer men.
on us to ride and reign:
We went through fire and water then
with danger, dread and pain.
12
Yet sure thou do of thy good grace
dispose it to the best:
To bring us out into a place
to live in wealth and rest.
PSALM. LXVI. Col. 3.***
13
Unto thine house resort will I,
to offer and to pray:
And there I will my self apply
my solemn vows to pay.
14
The vows that with my mouth I spoke,
in all my grief and smart:
The vows (I say) that I did make
in dolor of mine heart.
15
Burnt-offerings I will give to thee,
of incense and fat rams:
Yea, this my sacrifice shall be
of bullocks, goats and lambs.
16
Come forth and hearken every one,
that fears the living Lord:
What he for my poor soul hath-done,
to you I will record.
17
Full often I called upon his grace,
this mouth to him did cry,
My tongue likewise made speed apace,
his Name to magnify.
18
But if I feel mine heart within,
in wicked works rejoice;
Or if I have delight to sin,
God will not hear my voice.
19
But surely God my voice has heard,
and what I did require:
My prayer he did well regard,
and granted my desire.
20
All praise to him, to him, I say,
that always had regard,
And never put my prayer away,
nor sent me home unheard.
PSALM. LXVII. 2. Meter. ***
HAve mercy on us, Lord,
and grant to us thy grace:
And show us of thine own accord,
the brightness of thy face:
That all the earth may know
the way to godly wealth:
And all that live on earth below,
may see thy saving health.
3
Let all the world, O God,
give praise unto thy Name:
O let the people all abroad
extol and laud the same.
4
Throughout the world so wide,
let all rejoice with mirth:
For thou do justly judge and guide,
the nations of the earth.
5
Let all the world, O God,
give praise unto thy Name:
O let the people all abroad,
extol and laud the same.
6
Then shall the earth increase,
great store of fruit shall fall,
And then our God, the God of peace,
shall greatly bless us all.
7
Yea God shall bless us all,
and earth both far and near,
And people all in general,
of him shall stand in fear.
PSALM. LXVIII. the Col. ***
LEt God arise, and let his foes
betake themselves to flight,
And let his hateful enemies
be scattered in his sight.
2
And as the fire does melt the wax,
and wind blows smoke away:
So in the presence of the Lord,
the wicked shall decay.
3
But righteous men, before the Lord,
shall heartily rejoice:
They shall be most exceeding glad,
and cheerful in their voice.
4
Sing praise, sing praise unto the Lord,
who rides on the sky:
Extol the Name of Jah our God,
his greatenesse magnify,
5
The same is he that is above,
within his holy place:
The father of the fatherless,
and judge of widows case.
6
He gives both house and family,
unto the comfortless:
He brings bondmen out of thrall,
and rebels to distress.
PSALM. LXIX. the Collect. **
13
THey tear me with their sland'rous tongues,
who in the gate did sit:
On me the drunkards made their songs,
with wicked scoffing wit.
20
Thou know all my reproach and shame^
thou see my great disgrace:
Mine enemies, which procure the same,
are all before thy face.
28
Add sin to sin, in all they do,
heapt up in great excess:
And let them never come into
thy kingdoms righteousness.
30
But I am poor, and full of grief,
Lord, to my soul draw nigh:
Let thy salvation give relief,
and set me up on high.
31
Then will I sing, and praise, and bless,
and magnify his Name:
And with exceeding thankfulness,
will I extol his fame.
32
Which is more pleasing unto thee,
(such grace thy mind has born)
Then either Ox or Bull can be,
that has both hoof and horn.
35
Therefore let heaven his praises sing,
let heaven and earth begin:
Praise him, ye Seas, and every thing,
that lives and moves therein.
36
For God will Sion mountain save,
and Judahs Cities build,
Thus men may here possession have,
and all the streets be filled.
PSALM. LXXI. the Collect.***
MY Lord my God, in all distress
my hope is whole in thee:
Then let no shame my soul oppress,
nor once take hold of me.
3
Be thou my rock, to whom I may
for aid all times resort,
Thy promise is to help always,
thou art my fence and sort.
4
Save me, my God, from wicked men,
and from their strength and power:
From folk unrighteous, and from them
that cruelly devour.
19
O Lord, thy justice does exceed,
as by thy works we see:
Thy works are wonderful indeed,
Lord, who is like to thee?
20
Thou made me feel affliction sore,
and yet thou did me save:
Yea, thou did succor and restore,
and took'st me from the grave.
21
And thou mine honor do increase,
my dignity maintain:
Yea, thou do make all grief to cease,
and comfort'st me again.
22
Therefore thy faithfulness to praise,
I will with violl sing,
My harp shall sound thy fame always,
O Isreal's holy King.
23
My mouth will joy with pleasant voice,
when I shall sing to thee:
My soul shall in thy Name rejoice,
for thou have made me free.
25
My tongue thy uprightness shall found,
and speak it daily still:
For grief and shame do them confound,
that seek to work me ill.
PSALM. LXXIII. the Col.*
HOwever it be yet God is good,
and kind to Israel:
To every one that is clean of heart,
and keeps his conscience well.
2
But as for me, I almost slipped,
my feet began to slide:
And, through temptation unawares,
my steps were turned aside.
12
For we may see how wicked men,
in riches still increase,
Provided well of worldly goods,
and live in rest and peace.
13
Then why do I from wickedness,
my fantasy refrain:
And wash my hands in innocence,
and cleanse my heart in vain?
16
Then I bethought me how I might
this matter understand:
But lo, the labor was too great,
for me to take in hand:
17
Until I went into thy house,
and there, O Lord, and then
I understood the wretched end,
of these ungodly men:
18
And namely how thou set them,
upon a slippery seat:
And at thy pleasure casts them down,
and make their ruin great.
19
Then all men wonder at the sight,
to see how soon they change:
They are destroyed and quite consumed,
with terrors great and strange.
27
For lo, all such as thee forsake,
shall perish every one;
And all desiring any thing,
except in thee alone.
28
Therefore will I draw nigh to God,
and in the Lord I trust:
That I may set forth all his works
to be both good and just.
PSALM. LXXIIII. the Col.
WHy art thou, Lord, so far from us,
in all this danger deep:
Why does thine anger kindle thus,
against thy pasture sheep?
2
Lord, call thy people to thy thought,
which have been thine so long:
And which thou have redeemed and bought,
and brought from bondage strong.
3
Remember, Lord, remember still,
where thy possessions fell:
Thy purchased place of Sions hill,
where thou wast wont to dwell,
4
Lift up thy feet and come in haste,
and help our helpless case:
Confound thy foes, that rob and waste,
within thy holy place.
5
The curious carving of the boards,
and goodly graven stones:
With axes, hammers, bills and swords,
they now break down at once.
6
Regard thy Covenant, rid and cleanse
dark corners of our land,
So full of cruel robbers dens,
as now our realm does stand.
7
Arise, O Lord, and still maintain,
thy cause that is thine own:
Remember well how fools disdain,
and daily scorns are thrown.
8
Forget not, Lord, how great it grows,
how insolent, how high:
The tumults of thy rebel-foes,
increase continually.
PSALM. LXXIX. 1. Met. 1. p.*
O Lord, our God, thine heritage,
the Heathen now invade:
Jerus'lem, through their barbarous rage,
a ruinous heap is made.
2
Thy holy Temple they defiled,
and thy Saints bodies given:
Some to the beasts, some to the wild
and ravenous fowls of Heaven.
3
Their blood throughout Jerusalem,
as water spilt they have:
So that there is not one of them
to lay their dead in grave.
4
Thus are we made a laughing stock,
almost the world throughout:
The enemies at us jest and mock,
which dwell our coasts about.
5
Will thou (O Lord) thus in thine ire,
against us ever fume,
And keep thy wrath as hot as fire,
thy people to consume?
6
Upon those Heathen pour the same,
which did thee never know:
All Realms which call not on thy Name,
consume and overthrow.
7
For they have got the upper hand,
and Jacobs seed destroyed:
His habitation and his land,
they have laid waste and void.
8
Bear not in mind our former faults,
with speed some pity show:
And aid us, Lord, in all assaults,
for we are weak and low.
The second part.
O God that giv'st all health and grace,
on us declare the same:
Weigh not our works, our sins deface,
for honor of thy Name.
10
Why shall the Heathen folk always,
to us, as people dumb,
In thy reproach insult, and say,
where is their God become?
Require (O Lord) as thou see good,
before our eyes and sight,
Of all these folk, thy servants blood,
which they have spilt in spite.
11
And let thy Name be known thereby,
and now receive and take
The heavy sighs, complaint and cry,
which mournful prisoners make.
As is the greatness of thy power,
do thou accordingly,
Preserve, and be their Savior,
whom they condemned to die.
12
Into their bosoms sevenfold,
O recompense the shame;
Wherewith our neighbors have been bold,
to vilify thy Name.
13
So we thy flock and pasture sheep
will praise thee evermore:
And teach all ages for to keep
for thee like praise in store.
PSALM. LXXX. the Col. *
5
LOrd God of hosts of Israel,
how long will thou, I say,
Against thy folk in anger swell,
even all the while they pray?
6
Thou feedest them with sorrows deep,
their bread with tears they eat:
And drink the tears that they do weep,
in measure full and great.
7
Thou have us made a very strife,
to those that dwell about:
And that our foes do love alife,
they laugh and jest it out.
8
O take us, Lord, unto thy grace,
convert our minds to thee:
Show forth to us thy joyful face,
and we full safe shall be.
18
And so when thou have set us free,
and saved us from shame:
Then will we never fall from thee,
but call upon thy Name.
19
O Lord of hosts of thy good grace,
convert us unto thee:
Behold us with a pleasant face,
and then full safe are we.
PSALM. LXXXI. the Col. *
10
HEar, O my people Israel,
and I assure it thee:
Regard and mark my words full well,
if thou will cleave to me;
11
Thou shall no God in thee reserve,
of any land abroad,
Nor in no wise bow to, or serve
a strange or foreign god.
12
I am the Lord thy God, and I
from Egypt set thee free:
Then ask of me abundantly,
and I will give it thee.
13
And yet my people would not hear
my voice, when that I spoke:
And Israel would not obey,
but did me quite forsake.
14
Then did I leave them to their will,
in hardness of their heart:
To walk in their own counsels still,
themselves for to pervert.
15
O that my people would have heard
the words that I did say:
And oh that Israel would regard
to walk within my way.
16
How soon would I confound their foes,
and bring them down full low:
And turn my hand upon all those
that seek their overthrow!
But Israel should have had the crop,
and finest of the wheat:
And honey dropping from the rock,
that they their fill might eat.
PSALM. LXXXIIII. the Col. **
HOw pleasant is thy dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts to me!
The Tabernacles of thy grace,
how lovely, Lord, they be?
5
Oh happy, happy sure are they,
whose stay and strength thou art,
Which to thy house do mind the way,
and seek it in their heart.
8
From strength to strength they walk full fast,
no faintnes there shall be:
Until the God of gods, at last,
in Sion they do see.
9
O Lord of hosts to me give heed,
and hear when do pray:
And let it through thine ears proceed,
O Jacobs God, I say.
11
For in thy Courts, thy Name to praise,
Lord, one days being there,
Is better then a thousand days,
a thousand days elsewhere.
13
For God the Lord is Sun and shield,
and grace and glory gives:
And no good thing shall be withheld
from him that purely lives.
14
O Lord of hosts, that man is blessed,
and happy sure is he,
That is persuaded in his breast,
all times to trust in thee.
PSALM. LXXXV. the Col. **
THou have been merciful indeed,
O Lord, unto thy land:
Thou has redeemed Jacobs feed,
out of their enemies hand.
2
The wicked ways that they were in,
thou did them clean remit,
And thou did hide thy peoples sin,
full close thou coveredst it.
3
Thine anger, Lord, thou did assuage,
that all thy wrath was gone:
And so did turn thee from thy rage,
with them to be at one.
4
O God our Savior now convert
thy people unto thee:
Put all thy wrath from us apart,
and angry cease to be.
5
Why, shall thine anger never end,
but still proceed on us?
And shall thy wrath it self extend,
upon all ages thus?
6
Will thou not rather turn therefore,
and quicken us, that we,
And all thy people evermore,
may much rejoice in thee?
7
O Lord, on us do thou declare
thy goodness to our wealth:
Show forth to us, and do not spare,
but show thy saving health.
PSALM. LXXXVI. the Col.
LOrd how thine ear to my request,
and hear me by and by:
With grievous pain and grief oppressed,
full poor and weak am I.
2
Preserve my soul, because my ways
and doings holy be:
And save thy servant, O my Lord,
that puts his trust in thee.
3
Thy mercy (Lord) to me express,
defend me therewithal,
For through the day I do not cease
on thee to cry and call.
4
Comfort (O Lord) thy servants soul,
that now with pain is pined:
For unto thee (Lord) I extol,
and lift my soul and mind.
5
For thou art good and bountiful,
thy gifts of grace are free:
And thy compassions plentiful,
to all that call to thee.
6
O Lord, likewise when I do pray,
regard and give good ear:
Mark well the words that I do say,
and all my prayers hear.
7
In time when trouble does me move,
to thee I do complain:
Because I know and well do prove,
thou answerest me again.
13
For, Lord, thy mercy showed to me,
is great, and does excel:
Thou setst my soul at liberty,
out from the lowest hell.
PSALM. LXXXVIII. the Coll. *
LOrd God of health, my hope and stay,
and all in one to me,
I call and cry throughout the day,
and all the night to thee.
2
O let my prayer soon ascend,
unto thy sight on hie:
Incline thine ear, O Lord attend,
and hearken to my cry.
3
For why, with woe my heart is filled,
and does in trouble dwell:
My life and breath almost do yield,
and sink as low as hell.
4
I am esteemed as one of them,
that in the pit do fall:
And made as one amongst those men
that have no strength at all.
5
Yea, like to one shut up full sure,
within the lower pit,
In places dark and all obscure,
and in the depth of it.
6
Do thou unto the dead declare,
those wondrous works of thine?
Shall they again to life repair,
to preach thy power divine?
7
I cry to thee, Lord, I condole
my miserable case:
8
Why do thou then abhor my soul,
and hide away thy face?
9
I am afflicted like to die,
from youth still suffering so,
I am distracted, whilst that I
thy terrors undergo.
PSALM. XC. the Collect.
13
INstruct us, Lord, to know and try,
how long our days remain:
That then we may our hearts apply,
true wisdom to attain.
14
Return, O Lord, how long will thou
forth on in wrath proceed?
Show favor to thy servants now,
and help them at their need.
16
As thou have plagued us before,
now also make us glad:
And for the years, wherein full sore
affliction we have had,
17
O let thy works and power appear,
and on thy servants light:
And show unto thy children dear,
thy glory and thy might.
18
Lord, let thy grace and glory stand,
on us thy servants thus:
Confirm the works we take in hand,
and prosper them to us.
PSALM. XCIII. 1. Met. ***
THe Lord as King aloft does reign,
with glory shining bright:
His strength and power appears plain,
for he is girt with might.
2
The Lord likewise the earth has made,
and settled it so sure:
No might can make it move or fade,
it ever does endure.
3
Ere that the world was made or wrought
thy seat was set on hie:
Beyond all times that can be thought,
thou art eternally.
4
The floods, O Lord, the floods do rise,
they swell against the shore:
And raise the waves in such a wise,
they make the waters rore.
5
Yet though the storms appear in sight,
though seas do rage and swell:
The Lord is strong and more of might,
for he on high does dwell.
6
And look what promise he does make,
his household to defend,
For just and true they shall it take,
all times without an end.
OR,

THy testimonies precious,
are kept on sure record:
And holiness becomes thy house,
for evermore, O Lord.
PSALM. XCIIII. 1. M. 1 p. *
O Lord, thou do revenge all wrongs,
that power belongs to thee:
Since vengeance then to thee belongs,
declare that all may see.
2
Set up thy self, for thou of right
the earth do judge and guide:
Reward the proud and men of might,
according to their pride.
3
How long shall wicked men bear sway,
by lifting up their voice?
How long shall wicked men, I say,
thus triumph and rejoice?
4
How long shall they with brags burst out,
and proudly prate their fill?
Shall they rejoice and be so stout,
whose works are ever ill?
5
Thy flock, O Lord, thine heritage
they spoil, and vex full sore:
Against thy people they do rage,
still daily more and more.
6
The widows which are comfortless,
and strangers they destroy:
They slay the children fatherless,
and none does put them by.
7
And when they take these things in hand
this talk they have of thee,
Can Jacobs God this understand?
tush no, he cannot see.
8
O folk unwise, and people rude,
some knowledge now discern:
Ye fools among the multitude,
at length begin to learn.
9
Shall not the Lord that made the ear,
the Lord that made the eye,
What, shall not he both see and hear
even all things perfectly?
10
The Lord does all the world correct,
and makes them understand:
Shall he not then your deeds detect?
how can ye escape his hand?
The second part. I. M.**
11
THe Lord does know the thoughts of man,
his heart he sees plain:
The Lord (I say) men's thoughts does scan,
and finds them but vain.
12
But, Lord, that man is happy sure,
whom thou do keep in aw,
And through correction do procure,
to teach him in thy Law.
13
Whereby he shall in quiet rest,
when times of trouble are:
When wicked men shall be suppressed,
and fall into the snare.
14
For sure the Lord will not refuse,
his people for to take:
His heritage, whom he did choose,
he will no time forsake:
15
Until that judgment be decreed,
and justice play her part:
That all may follow her with speed,
that are of upright heart.
16
But now on my side who shall stand,
against the cursed train?
Or who shall rid me from their hand,
that wicked works maintain?
17
Except the Lord had been mine aid,
mine enemies to repel:
My soul and life had now been laid,
almost as low as hell.
18
When I did say, my foot does slide,
I now am like to fall:
Thy goodness, Lord, thou did provide,
to stay me up withal.
19
When with my self I mused much,
and could no comfort find:
Then, Lord, thy goodness did me touch,
and that did ease my mind:
20
Lord, shall the thrones of wickedness
have fellowship with thee:
Which make a Law for to oppress,
and plead, its thy decree?
21
Lo, they consult against the life
of righteous men and good:
And in their counsels they are rife,
to shed the guiltless blood.
22
But yet the Lord he is to me
a place of sure defense:
He is my God, to him I flee,
my strength and confidence.
23
Their mischiefs on themselves shall fall,
and (taken in their crimes)
The Lord our God shall slay them all,
and cut them off betimes.
PSALM. XCV. the Col.*
6
COme let us bow and praise the Lord,
before him let us fall,
And kneel to him with one accord,
the which has made us all.
7
For why, he is the Lord our God,
for us he does provide:
We are his flock, he does us feed,
his sheep, and he our guide.
8
To day if ye his voice will hear,
then harden not your heart:
As ye provoked him many a year,
within the desert part.
9
Whereas your fathers tempted me,
my power for to prove:
My wondrous works when they did see,
yet still they would me move.
10
Twice twenty years they did me grieve,
and I to them did say:
They err in heart and not believe,
they have not known my way.
11
Wherefore I swear, when that my wrath
was kindled in my breast:
That they should never tread the path,
to enter in my rest.
PSALM. XCVI. the Col. ***
SIng ye with praise unto the Lord,
new songs of joy and mirth:
Sing unto him with one accord,
all people on the earth.
2
Among the heathen folk declare
his honor round about:
To show his wonders do not spare,
even all the world throughout.
3
Tell all the world, from first to last,
the Lord does reign above:
Yea, he has set the earth to fast,
that it can never move:
4
And that it is the Lord alone,
that rules with princely might,
To judge the nations every one,
with equity and right.
PSALM. C. 1. M.
ALl people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
2
Him serve with fear, his praise forth-tell,
Come ye before him and rejoice.
3
The Lord ye know is God indeed,
Without our aid he did us make:
We are his flock, he does us feed.
And for his sheep he does us take.
4
O enter then his gates with praise,
Approach with joy his courts unto:
Praise, laud, and bless his Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
5
For why, the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure:
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
PSALM. CIII. 1. Coll. ***
MY soul does magnify the Lord,
my spirit do the same:
And all the secrets of my heart,
praise ye his holy Name.
2
Give thanks to God for all his gifts,
show not thy self unkind,
And suffer not his benefits,
to slip out of thy mind.
3
Who gave thee pardon for thy fault,
and thee restored again:
And healed thy infirmity,
and eased thee of thy pain.
4
That did redeem thy life from death
from which thou could not flee:
His mercy and compassion both
he did extend to thee.
5
That filled with goodness thy desire,
and did prolong thy youth:
Like as the eagle casts her bill,
whereby her age renu'th.
6
The Lord with justice dothrepay,
all such as be oppressed:
So that their sufferings and their wrongs
are turned to the best.
7
His ways and his commandments
to Moses he did show:
His counsels and his valiant acts
the Israelites did know.
8
The Lord is kind and merciful,
when sinners do him grieve:
The slowest to conceive a wrath,
and readiest to relieve.
PSALM. CIII. 2. Coll. ***
THe Lord our God deals not by us
according to our sin,
Nor after the iniquities
that we have lived in.
11
But as the space is wondrous great
twixt earth and heaven above:
So is his goodness much more large
to them that do him love.
12
God does remove our sins from us,
and our offenses all:
As far as is the Sunrising
full distant from his fall.
13
And look what pity parents dear,
unto their children bear:
Like pity bears the Lord to such
as worship him fear.
14
The Lord that made us knows our shape
our mould and fashion just,
How weak and frail our nature is,
and how we are but dust.
15
And how the time of mortal men,
is like the withering hay:
Or like the flower right fair in field,
that fades full soon away.
16
But yet the goodness of the Lord
with his shall ever stand:
Their childrens children do receive
much goodness at his hand.
17
I mean, which keep his covenant,
with all their whole desire:
And not forget to do the thing,
that he does them require.
PSALM. CVIII. the Col. **
O God my heart is now prepared,
so also is my tongue:
I will advance my voice, O Lord,
and praise thee with my song.
2
A wake my viol and my harp,
sweet melody to make:
And in the morning I my self
right early will awake.
3
Among the people gen'rally,
thou shall be praised by me:
Among the heathen folk, O Lord,
will I sing praise to thee.
4
Because thy mercy, Lord, is great,
above the heavens hie:
Also thy truth does pierce the clouds,
and reaches to the sky.
5
^Above the starrie firmament
extol thy self, O God:
And, Lord, display upon the earth
thy glory all abroad.
6
And that thy dear beloved one
delivered may be,
Help, O my God, with thy right hand,
and hearken unto me.
12
And grant us, Lord, thy saving health,
when troubles do assail:
For all the help of man is vain,
and nothing can avail.
13
Through God we shall do valiant acts,
and worthy of renown;
He shall subdue our enemies,
yea, he shall tread them down.
PSALM. CXIII. 1. M.
YE children which do serve the Lord,
Praise ye his Name with one accord:
2 And ever blessed be his Name.
3
Who from the rising of the Sun,
Till it return where it begun,
is to to be praised with great same.
4
The Lord all people does surmount,
As for his glory we may count,
above the heavens high to be.
5
With God the Lord who may compare
Whose dwellings in the heavens are?
of such great power and force is he.
6
He does abase himself (we know)
Things to behold both here below,
and also in the heavens high.
7
The poor and needy sort he brings
Even from the dust to sit with Kings,
in thrones of princely Majesty.
8
Among his people thus does he,
As Princes, place in high degree
even those that from the dunghill came.
9
The barren he does make to bear,
And with great joy her fruit to rear,
therefore praise ye his holy Name.
PSALM. CXVI. the Col. ***
I Love the Lord, because he heard
my earnest suit and cry:
2
And call upon him while I live,
that heard me formerly.
3
Even when the snares of cruel death,
on every side I found:
When pains of hell laid hold on me,
and sorrow did surround:
4
Upon the Name of God my Lord
then did I call, and say,
Deliver thou my soul, O Lord,
I do most humbly pray.
5
The Lord is very merciful,
and just he is also:
And in our God compassion
does plentifully flow.
6
The Lord in safety does preserve
all those that simple be:
I was in woeful misery,
and he delivered me.
7
And now, my soul, since thou art safe,
return unto thy rest:
For largely, lo, the Lord to thee,
his bounty has expressed.
8
Because thou have delivered
my soul from deadly thrall,
My moistened eyes from mournful tears,
my sliding feet from fall.
9
Before the Lord in land of life,
now will I walk therefore:
10
I did believe, therefore I spoke,
for I was troubled sore.
PSALM. CXVIII. the Coll. ***
THe Lord himself is on my side,
I will not stand in doubt:
Nor fear what flesh can do to me,
for God will help me out.
2
The Lord does take my part with them
to help me that arise,
Therefore I shall see my desire
upon mine enemies.
3
Better it is to trust in God,
then in man's mortal seed,
4
Or to put confidence in Kings,
or Princes in our need.
5
All nations have enclosed me,
and compassed me round:
But in the Name of God shall I
mine enemies confound.
6
My fo, thou have thrust sore at me,
that I indeed might fall:
But through the Lord I found such help,
that they were vanquished all.
7
Now help us, Lord, and prosper us,
we humbly crave the same:
8
Blessed is he that comes to us
in Gods most holy Name.
9
O give ye thanks unto the Lord,
for very good is he,
Because his mercies do endure:
to all eternity.
PSALM. CXIX. 1. Col. **
BLessed are they that perfect are,
and pure in mind and heart:
That from the Law of God the Lord,
do not at all depart.
2
Blessed are they that give themselves,
his Statutes to observe:
Seeking the Lord with all their hearts,
and never from him swerve.
4
It is thy just and strict command,
that with attentive heed,
Thy noble and divine precepts,
we learn and keep indeed.
5
O thou that giv'st us this command,
give grace to do the same:
6
Then shall I keep thy statutes all,
and never shrink for shame.
8
And wholly will I give my self,
to keep thy laws most right:
Forsake me not for ever, Lord,
but show thy grace and might.
The second Collect. **
Unfeignedly I have thee sought,
and seeking so abide:
Let me not wander from thy ways,
nor ever turn aside.
11
Within my heart and secret thoughts
thy words have I hid still,
That I might not at any time
offend thy holy will.
13
My lips have never ceased to preach,
and publish day and night
The judgments all, which did proceed
from thy mouth full of might,
15
Of thy precepts I will still muse,
and thereto frame my talk:
As at a mark so will I aim,
thy ways how I may walk.
16
My only joy shall be so fixed,
and on thy laws so set:
That nothing can me so far blind,
that I thy words forget.
The third Collect. **
20
MY soul is ravished with desire,
and never is at rest:
But seeks to know thy judgments, Lord,
and what may please thee best.
22
Lord, turn from me rebuke and shame
which wicked men conspire:
For I have kept thy covenants,
with zeal as hot as fire.
28
My soul I feel so sore oppressed,
that it does melt for grief:
According to thy word therefore,
Lord, haste to send relief.
35
In righteous paths of thy precepts,
Lord, guide me, I require:
None other pleasure do I wish,
nor greater thing desire.
36
Incline my heart thy laws to keep,
and covenants to embrace:
And from all filthy avarice,
Lord, shield me with thy grace.
37
From vain desires and worldly lusts,
turn back mine eyes and sight:
Give me the spirit of life and power,
to walk thy ways aright.
39
Reproach and shame which I so fear,
from me, O Lord, expel:
For thou do judge with equity,
and therein does excel.
40
Behold! my hearts desire is bent,
thy laws to keep for aye:
Lord strengthen me so with thy grace,
that it perform I may.
The fourth Collect.**
41
THy mercies that are manifold,
let me obtain, O Lord:
Thy saving health let me enjoy,
according to thy Word.
42
So shall I stop the standrous mouths
of lewd men and unjust,
That have so much reproached me:
for in thy word I trust.
60
I did not stay, nor linger long,
as those that slothful are;
But hastily thy laws to keep
I did my self prepare.
61
The cruel bands of wicked men,
have made of me their prey:
Yet did not I thy laws forget,
nor from thee go astray.
62
Thy righteous judgments are so great,
so holy, and so high,
That even at midnight I will rise,
thy Name to magnify.
The fifth Collect. **
ERe thou did touch me with thy rod,
I erred and went astray:
But now I keep thy word, O God,
and by it guide, my way.
71
O happy time, well may I say,
that thou did me correct:
For, like a guide, thy Law to learn,
thy rod did me direct.
76
Thy judgments very righteous are,
O Lord I do confess:
I know thou have afflicted me,
of very faithfulness.
107
I am afflicted very much,
but quicken me, O Lord:
And raise me to an holy life,
according to thy word.
114
Thou art my hid and secret place,
my shield and strong defense:
And on thy Word I fix my faith,
my hope and confidence.
PSALM. CXXII. 1. M. Ye children, etc.
I Did exceedingly rejoice,
To hear the loving peoples voice,
in offering of their own accord:
For in this manner did they say,
Come, let us up, and take our way,
unto the temple of the Lord.
Within thy gates, Jerusalem,
Our feet shall come, and stand in them,
to worship, and to offer there.
Jerusalem is built so neat,
Compact together and complete,
the like there is not any where.
2.
The holy tribes, with one accord,
The tribes, I say, of God the Lord,
to Isreal's testimony came.
Thither they went, on solemn days,
To worship and to offer praise,
unto the Lords most holy Name.
For there are stately thrones erect,
Erected there, for this respect,
for justice and for equity:
Which thrones of right do appertain
To David's house, which there must reign,
to judge his folk accordingly.
3.
O pray therefore, and do not cease,
But pray for our Jerus'lems peace.
lo, they shall prosper that love thee:
Peace be within thy walls, say I,
I wish as much prosperity
within thy palaces to be.
My brethren and companions dear,
Make me now say, let peace be here,
I wish it heartily to thee.
The temple of our God no less,
Makes me to seek thy happiness,
as much as ever lies in me.
PSALM. CXXVIII. 1. M. ***
BLessed art thou that fear God,
and walk in his way:
2
For of thy labor thou shall eat,
happy art thou, I say.
3
Like fruitful vines on thy house side,
so does thy wife spring out.
Thy children stand like olive plants,
thy table round about.
4
Thus art thou blessed that fear God,
and he shall let thee see
5
The promised Jerusalem,
and her felicity.
6
Thou shall thy childrens children see,
to thy great joys increase:
And likewise grace on Israel,
prosperity and peace.
PSALM. CXXX. 1. M. **
TO thee, O Lord, I make my moan,
in these my depths of grief:
I call, I cry, I sigh, I groan,
trusting to find relief.
2
Hear then, O Lord, my just request,
for it is full due time:
And let thy ears be now possessed,
with these desires of mine.
3
O Lord our God, if thou should weigh^
the sins that we have done:
Who can escape, or who can say,
I can excuse for one?
4
But thou, O Lord, art rather bent
to tenderness and grace:
That we, with hearts most penitent,
should fear before thy face.
5
In God I put my confidence,
my soul waits on his will:
His promise is a sure defense,
and I hope therein still.
6
My soul to God has due regard,
wishing for him always:
Yea, more then they that watch and ward
desire the dawning day.
7
Let Israel boldly trust upon
the Lords free grace and love,
And plentiful redemption
that comes from God above.
8
And he shall now and evermore
redeem us on this wise,
Quite blotting out the heavy score
of our iniquities.
PSALM. CXXXI. 1. Col. *
O Lord, I am not puffed in mind,
I have no scornful eye:
I do not exercise my self
in things that be too high.
2
But as the child that weaned is,
even from his mothers breast:
So have I, Lord, behaved my self
in silence and in rest.
3
O Israel trust in the Lord,
let him be all thy stay:
From this time forth for evermore,
from age to age, for ay.
PSALM. CXXXII. 1. Col. ***
RRemember David's troubles, Lord,
how to the Lord he swear,
And vowed a vow to Jacobs God,
the greatest of his care.
2
I will not come within my house.
nor climb up to my bed:
Nor let my temples take their rest,
nor the eyes within thy head:
5
Till I have found out for the Lord
a Temple for his grace:
An house for Jacobs mighty God
to be a dwelling place.
7
We will assay, and go into
his Tabernacle there:
Before his footstool falling down,
to worship him in fear.
9
O Lord, let all thy Priests be clothed
with truth and righteousness;
Let all thy Saints and holy men,
sing out with joyfulnesse.
The second Collect. ***
13
THe Lord has chosen Sion hill,
and loves therein to dwell:
Saying, this is my resting place,
I love and like it well.
14
And I will bless with great increase
her victuals every where:
And I will satisfy with bread,
the needy that be there.
15
Yea, I will deck and clothe her Priests,
with saving health throughout,
And all the Saints of Sion hill,
for joy shall sing and shout.
16
There will I surely make the horn
of David for to bud:
For there I have ordained for mine
a lantern bright and good.
17
As for his enemies, I will clothe
with shame for evermore:
But I will cause his crown to shine
more fresh then heretofore.
PSALM. CXXXV. the Col. ***
O Praise the Lord, praise him, praise him,
praise him with one accord:
O praise him still, all ye that be
the servants of the Lord.
2
O praise him ye that stand within
the Temple of the Lord:
Ye of his Court, and of his house,
praise him with one accord.
3
Praise ye the Lord, for he is good,
sing praises to his Name:
It is a good and comely thing,
always to do the same.
4
For God has chosen Jacobs seed,
even of his own good pleasure:
And he has chosen Israel,
for his peculiar treasure.
5
For this I know undoubtedly,
the Lord is very great:
He is indeed above all gods,
and has the highest seat.
15
The Idols which the Heathen have
in all their coasts and lands,
Of silver and of gold they be,
the work of workmens hands.
16
They have a mouth, and cannot speak,
and eyes that have no sight:
17
They have an ear, and do not hear,
their mouths are breathless quite.
19
O all ye house of Israel,
see that ye praise the Lord:
And ye that be of Aarons house,
praise him with one accord.
20
And ye that be of Levies house,
praise ye, likewise, the Lord:
And ye that stand in aw of him,
praise him with one accord.
PSALM. CXXXIX. the Collect. **
21
HAte I not them that hate thee, Lord?
and that in earnest wise,
Contend I not against them all,
against thee that arise?
22
I hate them with unfeigned hate,
even as my utter foes:
23
Try me (O God) and know my heart,
my inward thoughts disclose.
24
See, Lord, if any secret sin,
do in my soul abide:
And in the everlasting way,
be thou my God and guide.
PSALM. CXLIII. the Col. ***
LOrd hear my prayer and complaint,
which I put forth to thee,
And in thy truth and righteousness,
Lord, hear and answer me.
2
Against thy servant let not, Lord,
thy judgment to be tried,
For in thy sight can none alive
be ever justified.
8
Thy loving kindenes in the morn,
let me both hear and see:
Teach me the way that I should go,
for, Lord, I trust in thee.
12
And of thy mercy slay my foes,
that vex my soul so sore:
For lo, I am thy servant, Lord,
destroy them all therefore.
PSALM. CXLVI. 2. Met. ***
MY soul praise thou the Lord always,
his praise will I declare:
2
While breath and life prolong my days,
my tongue shall never spare.
3
Trust not in worldly Princes then,
though they abound in wealth:
Nor in the sons of mortal men,
in whom there is no health.
4
For why? their breath does soon depart,
they fall to earth anon;
And then the counsels of their heart,
do perish, every one.
5
O happy is that man, I say,
whom Jacobs God does aid;
And he, whose hope does not decay,
but on the Lord is staid.
6
Which made the earth and waters deep,
the heavens high withal:
Which does his word and promise keep,
and so for ever shall.
7
With right always does he proceed,
for such as suffer wrong:
The poor and hungry he does feed,
and loose the fetters strong.
8
The Lord does send the blind their sight,
the lame to limbs restore:
The Lord does in his Saints delight,
and loves them evermore.
9
He helps the widow in distress,
and stranger sad in heart:
He does defend the fatherless,
and ill men's ways subvert.
10
The Lord thy God, O Sion hill,
shall reign eternally,
From age to age, for ever still,
O praise the Lord most high.
PSALM. CXLIX. 1. M. ***
SIng ye a new song to the Lord,
his praises to declare:
And let his Name be magnified,
where Saints assembled are.
2
Let Israel rejoice in God,
their maker and their King:
And let the sons of Sion hill
for joy triumph and sing.
3
Let them sound praise with voice of flute
unto his holy Name:
And with the timbrell and the harp,
sing forth his praise and fame.
4
For, lo, the Lord, his dear delight
does in his people place:
And he will beautify the meek
with saving health and grace.
5
With glory and with honor now
let all the Saints rejoice,
And sing aloud upon their beds,
with glad and pleasant voice.
6
And in their mouths let be the acts
of God the mighty Lord:
And let them take into their hands
a double edged sword.
7
To plague the Heathen, and correct
the people with their hands:
8
To bind their stately Kings in chains,
their Lords in iron bands.
9
To execute on them the doom,
recorded long before:
This honor all his Saints shall have,
praise God for evermore.
FINIS.
NOte that all the Psalms that are put in whole, m^ readily be sung in
Churches, while others sing the old, for the verses are neither more nor fewer,
then the^^ were before.

So also may the Collects, if the Clark read them, or d^ point out and declare
the verses beforehand.

Note also that one single star points a doleful tune two stars a solemn, or
middle tune, three stars a joyfu^ tune; and they are set only (or for the most
part) to Psalms that go in a general tune ( i.e.) such as serve for all eights
and sixes generally.

Lastly, note that every new beginning of fresh matter is marked with a
Paragraph thus which is placed between the verse and the line, which is devised
to make short parts, and to discern suddenly where to begin.

Note this amendment of Psalm. 146. v. 3. 2. Met. if thou think it needs,

TRust not in worldly Princes then,
put not your trust in Kings,
Nor any of the sons of men,
for they are helpless things.
Here follow the rest of the new-made Psalms, that are not extant in the first
Impression.
Psalm V. 1. Met. Our Father which, etc.
LOrd, weigh my thoughts, my voice attend,
My King, my God, to me give ear:
To thee my prayers and cries I send,
My voice in the morning thou shall hear:
In The morning, Lord, will I direct,
My prayer to thee, and will expect.
2.
For thou in sin have no delight,
No ill shall dwell with thee, O Lord:
The fool abides not in thy sight;
All wicked works thou have abhorred,
Falsehood, deceit and cruelty,
Thou do detest, and wilt destroy.
3.
But I in thy abounding grace,
Thy house will visit in thy fear;
And worship in thy holy place,
O teach me, Lord, thy justice there:
Make straight thy paths before mine eyes,
Because of all mine enemies.
4.
A wicked heart within they have,
A faithless mouth, a flattering tongue:
Their throat is like a gaping grave,
Let their own counsels lead them vvrong:
Destroy them, cast them out therein,
And in their multitudes of sin:
5.
For thee they have rebelled against:
But let believers joy in thee,
And shout for joy in thy defense,
And all thy lovers joyful be:
For thou will bless the just, O Lord,
And make thy grace his shield and guard.
Psalm. VI. 1. Met. O Lord consider, etc.
IN anger, Lord, rebuke me not,
For I am very weak and low,
Chastise not when thy wrath is hot,
But, Lord, to me thy mercy show:
Lord heal me, for my bones are vexed,
But thou, O Lord, how long a space?
My soul is also sore perplexed,
Return and save me of thy grace.
My soul, O Lord, preserve and save,
For none in death remembers thee,
Nor any thanks thee in the grave;
Thou see my groaning wearieth me:
All night I make my bed to swim,
Watering my couch with weeping eyes,
Mine eye with grief grows old and dim,
Because of all mine enemies.
Ye workers of iniquity,
Depart from me, depart ye all;
For lo the Lord has heard my cry,
My weeping voice and tears that fall.
The Lord will hear the prayer I frame,
The Lord has heard, and has relieved;
Let all my foes return with shame,
With sudden shame sore vexed and grieved.
Psalm. XIIII. 1. Met. Give laud unto, etc.
THe fool has said in heart
There is no God at all;
They are in every part
Corrupted by the fall:
There Is none does good,
But they have wrought things vile and naught, even all the brood.
2
The Lord did cast his eye,
From heaven his holy throne,
On man's posterity;
To see if any one
He might discern,
That understood the things of God, or sought to learn.
3
They all are gone aside,
They do themselves defile,
They all are wandered wide,
Become exceeding vile:
And there is none
Of all mankind to good inclined, no sure not one.
4
Have wicked workers all,
No knowledge generally?
Who have not grace to call,
Upon the Lord most hie:
Lo they are fed,
^vouring here my people dear, even like to bread.
5
But yet they were in fear,
And great the fear must be,
For God does still appear
In good men's company;
And keeps them,
^ every place, I mean the race of righteous men.
6
But ye have put to shame,
The counsel of the poor,
Because the Lord became
His refuge to secure.
O that there were
^ Israel some salvation come from Sion there.
7
When as the Lord brings back
Our hard captivity,
And lets not Israel lack
So great a cause of joy:
Then surely shall
Jacob rejoice with heart and voice, and Israel all.
Psalm. XVII. 2. Col. O praise the Lord, etc.
KEep me as the apple of thine eye,
And make thy wings my Canopy,
From wickedness,
And deadly foes that me enclose, and much oppress.
2
They are enclosed in their own fat,
And proudly prate they care not what,
They hemme us round
In our steps now; Their eyes they bow down to the ground.
3
Like greedy Lions seeking prey,
Or Lions whelp in secret way;
O Lord arise,
Defeat my foe, and overthrow his enterprise.
4
From wicked men that are thy sword,
From men that are thy hand, O Lord,
My soul o save,
From worldlings mere, that only here their portion have.
5
Whose bellies filled with thy hid treasure,
They spend their substance at their pleasure;
And leave unto
Their babes the rest, for they are blessed with babes enough.
6
But as for me, I have access
To see thy face in righteousness.
And waking, shall
Thy vision see, and I shall be filled therewithal.
Psalm. XXIII. 1. Met. ***
THe living Lord my shepherd is,
and he that does me feed;
Since he is mine, and I am his,
what comfort can I need?
^ He leads me to the tender grass,
where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass,
in both I have the best.
Or if I stray, thou do convert
and bring my mind in frame;
And all this not for my desert;
but for thy holy Name.
^ Yea, tho I walk in shade of death,
yet I will fear no ill,
Thy rod, thy staff so comfort,
and thou art with me still.
Yea, thou do make me sit and dine,
even in mine enemies sight;
^^y head with oil, my cup with wine,
runs over day and night.
Thy grace and mercy certainly,
shall measure out my days,
And in the house of God will I
for ever give thee praise.
Psalm. LIII. 1. Met. Give laud unto, etc.
THe fool has said in heart,
There is not any God:
Corrupt in every part,
And none of them does good,
Such Atheism lurks
^n every one, that they have done most odious works.
2
The Lord from Heaven hie,
Looked down on earth below,
On man's posterity:
That he might see and know,
What paths men trod,
If any man did understand, and seek for God.
3
But all are gone astray,
Become most base and vilde,
And wandered from the way,
And filthily defiled:
So that they can,
No good thing do, nor move thereto, no, not a man.
4
What have they knowledge none,
That work iniquity?
They have not called upon:
The Lord that is most hie,
But they devour
My folk like bread, and on them fed, with tyrant-power.
5
They were in fear and dread,
Where was no cause of fear,
For God has scattered,
Their quarters here and there,
That have encampt,
Against our cause. And hence it was they were so dampt.
6
Lo, thou have put to shame,
Thy hateful enemies,
In God's Almighty Name,
That did thy foes despise.
O that there might,
Salvation still, from Sion hill, on Israel light.
7
When as the Lord shall please,
To bring our bondage back,
And gives his folk the eaten
And gives his folk the ease,
And liberty they lack:
Glad news shall we
In Jacob tell, and Israel full glad shall be.
Psalm. LVIII. 1. Met. Ye children which, etc.
DO ye speak righteousness indeed,
O ye that are of mortal seed?
O Congregation judge ye right?
2
Yea, ye in heart work wickedness,
Your hands with violence oppress,
the earth can scarcely bear your weight.
3
They are estranged from the way,
And from the womb they go astray;
no sooner born then speaking lies,
4
As serpents poison, such is theirs;
Deaf adder-like they stop their ears,
and will not hear in any wise.
She will not hear the charmers voice,
Although his charms be wise and choice,
she will not hearken to a word.
6
Lord, break their keen and cruel fangs,
The eager tooth and tusk that hangs
in these young lions mouths, O Lord.
7
As waters let them melt away,
Which constant run, and have no stay;
and let his aimed arrows fail:
8
And when he bends his bow to shoot,
Let them drop broken at his foot,
and let them melt as does a snail.
9
So let them pass away on earth,
As woman-kindes untimely birth,
that they may never see the Sun,
10
Before your pots can feel the thorns,
He Will blast them as with whirlwinde storms:
Alive, in living wrath begun.
11
The righteous shall rejoice to see
Vengeance on them that wicked be,
and he shall wash his feet in blood:
12
So that a man shall sure confess,
Sure there is reward for righteousness,
sure there is a just earth-judging God.
Psalm. LXVII, 1. Met. Give laud, etc.
LOrd bless us of thy grace,
Be merciful to thine:
And let thy pleased face
Upon thy servants shine.
That all may see,
The heavenly wealth, and saving health that comes from thee.
2
Let all thy praise rehearse
With one united voice:
Sing in melodious verse,
Eternally rejoice;
Thy power obey:
Whose justice shall dispose of all, and bear the sway.
3
Let all extol thy worth,
Then store of fruit shall fall:
The earth shall bring it forth,
And God shall bless us all:
God shall us bless,
Earth far and near his Name shall fear with awfulnes.
Psalm. LXX. 1. M. All people.
MAke haste, O Lord, and set me free,
Make haste, O God, and succor me:
Confound them with confounding shame,
That seek my soul to hurt the same.
2
Let them be turned backward still,
Turned back with shame, that wish me ill:
Reward their shame, that say, Aha,
And let confusion be their pay.
3
All that seek thee, and all that love
Salvation coming from above,
Let them in thee be glad and joy'd,
Still saying, God be magnified.
But I am needy, weak and poor,
Make haste, to help me, Lord, therefore:
My help and my deliverer,
Thou art, O Lord, do not defer.
OR,

THou art my hope, my help and stay,
Come, Lord, and make no more delay.
Psalm LXX. 2. Meter. *
DEfer not, Lord, defer not long,
but bring my foes to shame;
2
And them that seek my soul to wrong,
let them bear all the blame.
3
On them that sc^ff and slout at me
bestow the scorners hire:
4
But make them glad, full glad in thee,
that after thee inquire.
Still, God be praised, let all men say,
that on his aid rely:
And make, O Lord, no more delay,
for in great want am I.
5
O Lord, I am exceeding poor,
mine only and art thou:
Make haste to help me, Lord, therefore,
and make no tarrying now.
Psalm LXXXII. ^. M. O praise the Lord, etc.
GOD sits upon the throne of Kings,
And Judges unto judgment brings,
Why warp you then,
And, so long space, accept the face of wicked men?
2
Defend the poor and fatherless,
The needies injuries redress,
As God commands:
And vindicate the desolate, from winked hands.
3
But neither do, nor will they know,
In wilful blindness on they go:
Earths pillars fail,
All out of course, and worse and worse, no laws prevail.
4
I called you gods, all you, said I,
Are sons of him that is most hi^,
But ye shall die,
As vulgar things, or tyrant Kings did formerly.
5
A^ise, O God, thy power set forth,
Judge all the Nations of the earth:
They are thine own;
Thine heritage from age to age, and thine alone.
Psalm. LXXXVII. 1. M. Our Father, etc.
IN holy hills is Sions floor,
Which God with grace and glory crowns:
God loves the gates of Sion more,
Then all the rest of Jacobs town^,
Most glorious things are fim'd abroad,
Of thee, O city loved of God.
2
For I will mention born in thee,
Egyptians, Babylonians, Moors:
Philistians, Tyrians there shall be,
Told to my friends among my stores:
For God has said, that all on earth,
In Sion may renew their birth.
3
For God most high will st^blish her,
And shall record each faithful soul:
When he is pleased to register,
And Sions converts to inroll,
There Is he that plays, there is that sings,
And there are all spiritual springs.
Psalm. LXXXVIII. 1. M. O Lord consider, etc.
LOrd God of my salvation dear,
I cried before thee day and night:
2
Unto my cry ^^^line thine ear,
And let my prayer come in thy sight.
3
For, Lord, my soul is filled with woe,
My life draws ^igh unto the grave.
4
Reckned with them that sink so low,
And very little strength I have.
5
A freeman in this dead estate,
As slain, and buried and forgot:
As whom thy hand has separate,
And such as thou regardest not.
Thou lay'st me in the lowest ward,
Where darkest, deepest dungeons are:
5
Thy wrath upon me lies hard,
And all thy bitter storms I bear.
3
My friends from me thou have restrain'^,
And made me loathed in lovers eyes:
9
In prison I am fast detained,
Mine eye laments my miseries.
O Lord, I daily called on thee,
My humble hands I meekly raise:
10
Shall dead men, Lord, thy wonders see?
Shall dead men rise to give thee praise?
11
Lord, can the grave thy grace express,
Thy faithful truth destruction teach?
12
Thy wonders and thy righteousness,
Can dark and dumb oblivion preach?
13
Betimes, O Lord, will I direct,
My humble suits and cries to thee:
14
Why do thou, Lord, my soul reject,
Why do thou hide thy face from me?
15
My tortured soul is pained to death,
While from my youth I always bear
16
The heavy burdens of thy wrath,
Thy terrors and distracting fear:
17
They closed me round as waters deep,
They compass me at once, I say:
18
From me my lovers thou do keep,
And mine acquaintance hid'st away.
Psalm. LXXXIX. The Col. All people.
NOw in a song of endless praise,
Thy mercies I will sing, O Lord:
And unto all succeeding days,
Thy faithfulness will I record.
For I have said that thy great love,
And mercy shall be raised hie:
And that thou shall in Heaven above,
Confirm thy truth eternally.
2
Thou have both vowed and decreed,
To David thine elected one,
To multiply his faithful seed,
And build him up an endless throne.
Which Heaven shall to thy praise declare
In works to be admired at:
And where thy Saints assembled are,
Shall tell thy truth, and treat of that.
3
For whom, like thee does Heaven afford,
What earthly Kings thy equals be?
Who art among the Saints adored,
And feared of all that wait on thee:
O Lord of hosts, what Lord is found,
So faithful or so strong as thou?
Who sets the seas their certain bound,
And tam'st their rage, for thou know how.
4
Thou did afflict all Egypt land,
As one made weak by wounds and woes:
And, by the power of thy strong hand,
Thou have dispersed all thy foes.
Thine, Heaven and earth, and all things be,
For thou alone did all things frame:
The North and South were made by thee,
And East and West extol thy Name.
Psalm. XCII. The Collect. ***
RIght good it is, O Lord, most high,
thy praises to recite:
2
Thy truth and love to magnify,
at morning and at night.
3
With ten-st^ing'd instruments to sing
the praises of thy Name:
And that we harps and psalt'ries bring
to solemnize the same.
4
For, Lord, thy works rejoice my heart,
thy doings cheer my mind:
5
How wonderful in them thou art,
thy thoughts how deep we find!
6
The fool and worldling neither know,
nor heed such things at all:
7
For, when like flowers the wicked show,
their prospering proves their fall.
Psalm. XCVII. 1. Met. Give laud unto, etc.
GOd reigns and rules on high,
With clouds and darkness clad,
Let earth be filled with joy,
And all the Isles be glad,
His truth is known,
And judgment pure the station sure of his high throne,
2
Fire goes before his face,
And flaming round about
Burns up his foes apace,
His lightning glanceth out:
And these do make
The world shine bright, and at the sight the earth did quake.
3
At presence of the Lord,
Like wax the mountains thawd:
At presence of the Lord,
By whom the earth is awd:
The Heavens express
How just is he; and all men see his gloriousnes^
4
Confusion on them all,
Who serve an image carved:
That to dumb idols fall,
And boast what gods they served:
O all ye gods
See that ye do how down unto the God of gods.
5
O Lord, thy judgments voice,
Made Sion hear and joy,
And Judahs towns rejoice:
For, Lord, thou art most high,
Thou have the ods
Of all the earth, and art set forth above all gods.
6
Ye lovers of the Lord,
Hate all that evil is:
For he the souls does guard,
Of all dear Saints of his,
And saves them
From cruel spite and crushing might of wicked men.
7
For just men light is sown,
And gladness is upstor'd:
For each true-hearted one;
Ye just joy in the Lord,
Him praise and bless,
At memory of his so high pure holiness.
Psalm. CX. 1. Met. All people, etc.
THe Lord unto my Lord thus said,
Sit thou at my right hand, on hie:
Until thine enemies be made,
A foo^-stool for thy Majesty.
2
The Lord shall send from Sion hill,
The scepter of thy sovereign might:
Rule thou amidst thine enemies still,
Thy people yielding to thy right,
3
In sacred beauties yielding thee,
(When first thy powr'full Gospel calls)
As fruitful births, as dews can be,
That from the womb of morning falls.
4
The Lord has sworn and wist not break,
Ne^ change the word the which he swore,
By the order of Melchized^k,
Thou art a Priest for evermore.
5
The Lord that stands at thy right hand,
In day of wrath shall Kings confound:
6
Judging in many a Heathen land,
And heads of many countries wound,
And he shall fill in that same day,
Each place with bodies of the s^ain,
7
And drink the torrent in the way,
And then lift up the head again.
Psalm. CXI. 1. Met. ***
PRaise ye the Lord, whom I will praise,
with all my heart and might:
In congregation of the just,
and in the Churches sight.
2
Great are the works of our great God,
and they are sought into,
Of all that take content therein,
delighting ^o to do.
3
Most honorable is h^s work,
and shines gloriously:
His righteousness does still endure
to all eternity.
4
And he has made his wondrous works
to be retained in mind:
Full of compassion is the Lord,
and graciously inclined.
5
The Lord has given meat to them
that fear before his face:
He will be ever mindful of
his covenant of grace.
6
The power of his works has he,
in Isreal's sight ex rest:
To give to them the heritage.
which Heathen men possessed.
7
Lo, righteousn^^s^ and judgment are,
the works of Gods own hands:
And sure are his cemmandements,
what ever he commands.
8
Yea, they stand fast for evermore,
and everlastingly:
And they are done in righteousness,
in truth and equity.
9
He sent redemption to his own,
to make his people free:
And did command his covenant,
for evermore to be.
10
Holy and reverend is the Name
of our almighty king:
And only from the fear of God,
does all true wisdom spring.

To practice his commandments,
his praise endure for ever.
Psalm. CXII. 1. M. Our Father, etc. OR, O all ye, etc.
THe man is blessed that fears the Lord,
Delighting greatly in his word:
Mighty on earth his seed shall be,
And blessed his posterity:
Riches and wealth his house shall fill,
His righteousness continuing still.
2
Unto the man that is upright,
In darkness there arises light:
He is a gracious righteous one,
And full of kind compassion,
A good man's kind, he ^ends and sparc^^
Discretion guiding his aff^rs.
3
He shall not sure be moved for ever,
Nor his name perish now, nor never,
His stablisht heart on God is staid,
Of evil tidings not afraid.
His faith is fixed, his pain is past,
Until he see his enemies cast.
4
He has dispersed of his store,
And given plenty to the poor:
His righteousness remains sure,
And shall for evermore endure:
His horn shall be exalted high,
With honor and with dignity.
5
The wicked man this thing shall see,
And very greatly grieved shall be:
Yea, he shall g^ash his teeth for spite,
And pine away, and perish quite.
Thus wicked men's desires shall die:
The Lord then praise and magni^ie.
Psalm. CXIII. 2. M. Give laud unto the Lord,
YE servants of the Lord,
With praise Gods name adore,

2.
All nations fear his powers,
His glory mounts the sky:
There is no God like ours,
No other Lord so high:
Yet stoops, we know,
All things to see, in heaven that be, or earth below.
The n^edy poor and bass,
From dust and dung he brings,
To sit in Princes place,
Even with his peoples Kings:
And her, that had
A barren womb, he made become a mother glad. Hallelujah
Psalm. CXVII. 1. Meter.
O Praise the Lord all men, all lands,
Great kindness have we at his hands,
His praise record,
His truth is sure still to endure. Praise ye the Lord.

So shall I have thy wondrous works

Good judgment, Lord, to me reveal,

67
For I believed thy word, O God,
although I went astray:
While unchastised with thy rod:
but since have kept thy way.
68
Thy works and nature both are good,
teach me thy laws thereby:
69
The proud, (to hurt me what they could)
against me forged a lie.
My whole heart notwithstanding that,
shall keep thy precepts right.
70
Their heart like grease is waxen fat,
thy law is my delight.
71
'Twas good for me to be chastised,
that I might learn thy pleasure:
72
Whose law revealed I more have prized
then store of earthly treasure.
Psa^ CXIX. 18. p. a, M. Have mercy
137
RIghteous art thou, O Lord,
thy judgments righteous too,
138
The testimonies thou have set,
are very just and true.
139
My zeal has me consumed,
because my wicked foes,
Forgot thy words, which are so pure,
so very pure are those.
140
But therefore on that word,
thy servants love is set;
141
Small, and despised, yet do not I
thy testaments forget.
142
Thy righteousness remains,
and so it ever does,
An everlasting righteousness,
thy law is very truth.
143
Trouble and anguish great,
have taken hold on me:
But yet, Lord, thy commandments,
my joy and comfort be.

Do thou, O Lord, my prayers attend:
Thy Statutes I will keep entire,

And I shall keep thy testament,
For I have made thy word my stay:
With earnest cries did I prevent
The early dawning of the day.
2
The watches of the night so late.
With wakefull eyes do I prevent:
That I might duly meditate
Upon thy sweet commandment,
Thy loving kindness now record,
And hear my voice that calls on thee,
According to thy judgments Lord,
Vouchsafe to come, and quicken me.
3
Lo, they that follow wickedness
Draw nigh, but far from thy command:
All thy commands are righteousness,
But thou, O Lord, art near at hand.
Concerning thy approved decrees,
Lo, I have known the same of old,
That thou, O Lord, have founded these,
Eternally to keep and hold.
Psalm. CXXI, 1. M. Ye children which, etc.
I Lift mine eyes to Sion hill,
From whence my help proceeds still,
and where I always do attend,
My help does come from God most high,
The Lord that made both earth and sky,
and he to me shall succor send.
He will not suffer thee to swerve,
For God thy keeper will preserve
and stay thy feet: He slumbers not,
Behold! the Lord that keeps thee well,
He never sleeps, O Israel,
he never slumbers any jot.
2
Behold! the Lord thy keeper is,
And shades thee with that shade of his:
At thy right hand he is thy defense;
So that the Sun that burns so bright,
Nor yet the Moon in sharpest night,
shall hurt thee with their influence,
The Lord will save thee sound and whole^
He shall preserve, and keep thy soul,
from every hurt and every sore,
Both going out and coming in,
The Lord shall keep thee safe herein,
from this time forth for evermore.
Psalm. CXXI. 2. M. O praise the Lord, etc.

Nor lets thy foot be moved a jot:
He that does keep
His Israel all, he neither shall
slumber nor sleep.

The Lord's thy shade on thy right hand,
The Lord thy keeper there does stand.
That neither may
The moon, by night, his Israel smite,

And save thy soul, and keep thee still:
He shall, no doubt,
Each time and tide, thy goings guide,
both in and out.
Psalm. CXXIIII. 1. M. Ye children, etc.
Unless the Lord had been our stay,
And took our part, this present day,
now Israel may truly say.
But that the Lord did thus dispose,
And took our part against our foes,
when cruel men against us rose:
Then had they swallowed us alive,
When they in bitter wrath let drive,
and did for our destruction strive.
The waters then that did abound,
With swelling streams and deeps profound,
our souls had overwhelmed and drowned.
2
The floods did rise, the waves did roll,
The swelling streams, without control,
had overtopt and drowned our soul.
O Blessed be the Lord always,
That has not given us, as a prey
into their teeth this very day.
Our souls escaped, very fair,
As bird from fowlers broken snare,
it is broke, and we delivered are.
Our help is in that blessed name,
The Lord our God, the very same,
that did both earth and heaven frame,
PSALM. CXXXI. The second Meter.
O Lord, I have no scornful eye,
nor proud, nor haughty mind:

And Israel so (to be sustained)
on God should always rest.

From Sion bless thee plenteously,

And feel, as foes, thy fiery flame,
For envying our felicity.

In all the earth, in any kind;
Nor have the inhabitants of the earth,
Fallen by the power that we put forth;
But by thy strength are undertrod;
For Lord thou will ordain (at last)
True peace for us, because thou have
Wrought all our works in us, O God.

O come my people, enter thou
Into thy secret chambers now,
And shut the doors about thee fast:
And hide thy self now, as it were,
But for a little moment there,
Until the wrath be over past:
For lo the Lord comes from his place,
To punish this malignant race,
For wickedness that they maintain;
The earth shall also now disclose,
The bloodshed of our barbarous foes,
And shall no more conceal her slain:

And let the very heart rejoice

Let not the judgments of his mouth,
out of your minds depart.
Ye seed of faithful Abraham,
his servant, and his friend,
Ye children that do lineally
from Jacobs loins descend.
For lo he is the Lord our God,
even he, and he alone.
And every where throughout the earth
his judgments are made known.
His promise and his Covenant,
which he has made to his,
Has been remembered evermore,
and still remembered is.

out the parenthesis, will be sung in any Genesis Tune, if you put them in, then,
to All people.)
Luke 1. from ver. 68 to the 76.
THe Lord the God of Israel,
(Now do) we praise, with one accord:
For visiting and redeeming us,
The (chosen) people of the Lord,
For he has raised up for us
Salvations (strong and) surest horn,
Which in his servants David's house,
Is for his people (Israel) born,
As by his holy Prophets all,
(Speaking) since first the world began,
And, by their mouth he has foretold,
(That it) should come to pass for man.
That from our foes we should be freed,
And (saved from) all our haters hands:
To snew that he remembers how,
(how) his (most) holy Covenant stands.
To pay the gracious promises,
Which to our (ancient) fathers came:
The oath which he had sworn unto,
Our father Abraham (by Name)
That he would give and grant to us
That we (his folk) whom he has chose,
Now being thus delivered,
From (cruel) hand of all our foes,
Might serve him, free from slavish fear,
Walking in (all the) perfect ways,
Of holiness and Righteousness,
Before him (even) all our days.

LO Christ is sacrificed for us,

Because they want a spiritual eye

Our hearts with care examined,
let us be stirred up,
To eat of this celestial bread

As often as we eat this bread.

Or

We show our blessed Saviors death

Be glory, blessing, strength renown,

That gives life unto the World,
Is he that down from heaven came:
And with this sweet celestial bread,
Lord let us be replenished,
And give us ever of the same.

Lays hold on Christ by lively faith.
Shall never thirst nor hunger more
For by that faith, and feeding so,
Out of his belly there shall flow,
Of living waters plenteous store.

Reply the same and say so too,
Come every one that is athirst.

Take without price, take without strife,
Take freely, whosoever pleases:
Behold the Judge at door does stand,
His coming is so near at hand,
Amen, Amen, so come Lord Jesus.
FINIS.
Courteous Reader.
BE pleased to take notice that this book, in bigger Print, differs not greatly
from my smaller printed Psalm-book, but only in order, which thou may
reconcile by observing these rules.

1. In the first place are bound up my own composed Psalms, and in the little
print, they are commonly the second metres.

2. In the second place are bound up all the old Psalms, by me amended, and in
the little print they are commonly the first meter, but whither so or no, they
are referred unto, and the title tells what meter they are.

3. In the last place follow the Psalms composed by my self and others, and
they are commonly of choicer tunes, viz. Ye children, etc. O Lord consider,
etc. and in the little print are always the first meter, as the title does
also refer.

4. The Collects must be always looked for after the meters.

Note also that all the Psalms may be sung in one of these 5 well known tunes.
viz. the 119 the 67 the 100 the 113 the 148 but only such as the fifth ps. I. m.
and the 17. 2 Coll. which go sweetly in a part of the 113. and 148 as the first
and second metres of the 117 Ps. in the smaller print do show by music notes,
Only remember, in those of my first impression in this book, to read two lines
into one. wherever you meet with but 4 syllables in a line, as in the eight
Psalm.

Note also that the old Psalms done by me, are printed in greater letter then
the rest, and those for the present I specially commend for the public use, of
which, those that are entire Psalms, or entire parts, may be sung without
offense, while others keep to their old Mumpsimus; Do you not know, that
somewhere, the Dutch, French, and English sing one and the same Psalm in their
several languages, because the measures and tunes differ not?

Lastly, know that there are ready to be added to these impressions, at least
40 more of the old Psalms, (whereof the 119 is one) and in the old tunes, and
diverse hymns are also ready to be added, when it shall please God to give the
Author encouragement by the Houses allowance of them in public.

And here follows a taste of each, to incite thee to desire them. Accept this
staff to make up the 10 part of the 119 Psalm. and doubt not but all the rest
shall be done as well.

Psalm. 119. ver. 79. 80.
Let all that fear thee turn to me
And all that understand
How just and good the precepts be,
the which thou do command.
My heart unto thy Statutes frame,
even so sincere and sound,
That Sin may never bring me shame,
Nor shame my soul confound,
Psalm. LXXII. 2. Meter. ***
Lord give thy judgments to the King,
That justice may be done:
And give the rule of governing
Unto his princely Son.
2
Then shall he govern uprightly,
And do thy people right:
Then shall he judge, with equity,
The poor that have no might.
3
And then, by means of righteousness,
There shall be great increase:
In every corner fruitfullnesse,
Prosperity, and peace.
4
Then shall he help the poor, and weak,
And them that suffer wrong;
And, by his power, in pieces break
Oppressors great, and strong.
5
And then, from age to age, shall they,
Regard and fear his might,
So long as Sun does shine by day,
Or else the moon by night.
6
He shall descend as showrs of rain,
On mowen grass do drop,
Which make the ground to spring again,
And bear a second crop.
7
The just shall flourish in his days,
And all shall be at peace,
Until the very Moon decaies,
And all its motions cease.
8
He shall be Lord of Sea and Land,
From shore to shore, throughout:
From Sea to Sea, on either hand,
And all the Earth about.
To answer suffer for us all.

A man of sorrows, sure he was,
And he has born our grief:
Mean while, we hid our face from him,
And gave him no releif.
Jh. 10. 11, and 15. 13.
Lo, this is that good shepherd then,
That Good shepherd indeed,
That lost his life to save his sheep,
That they might never bleed.
or

That laid his life down for the sheep,
which he does watch and feed.
Agreater love then this has none,
Nor none can comprehend,
Then that a man should stake his life,
And loose it for his friend.
Romans 5. 7. 8.
For scarce will any die for him,
That lives most righteously.
Yet happ'ly, for a special friend
Some one might dare to die.
But God commends his love to us,
And he commends it thus,
In that, when we were enemies,
Christ freely di'd for us.
Heb. 13. 15.
By him therefore let us give to God
The sacrifice of praise.
Fruit of our li^s in giving thanks,
Unto his Name always.
FINIS.
