By the Queen.
A Proclamation against the despisers or breakers of the orders prescribed in
the book of Common prayer.
THE Queens Majesty being right sorry to understand that the order of common
prayer, set forth by the common consent of the Realm, and by authority of
the Parliament in the first year of her reign, wherein is nothing contained
but the scripture of God, and that which is consonant unto it, is now of late
of some men despised, and spoken against, both by open preachynges, and
wrytynges, and of some bold and vain curious men, new and other rytes found
out and frequented, whereupon contentions, sects, and disquietnesse does arise
among her people: and for one godly and uniform order, diversity of ryghtes
and ceremonies, disputations, and contentions, scismes, and divisions already
risen, and more like to ensue. The cause of which disorders, her Majesty does
plainly understand to be the negligence of the Bishops and other
Magistrates, who should cause the good laws and acts of Parliament made in
this behalf to be better executed, and not so dissembled and wynked at, as
hitherto (it may appear) that they have been.

For speedy remedy whereof, her Majesty straightly charge and commands al
Archbyshoppes and Bishops, and all Justices of Assizes, and Oyer, and
Termyner, and all Majors, head officers of Cities and Towns corporate, and all
other who have any authority to put in execution the Act for the
uniformity of common prayer and the administration of Sacraments made in the
first year of her gracious reign, with all diligence and severity, neither
fauouryng, nor dissemblying with one person nor other, who does neglect,
despise, or seek to alter the godly orders and ryghtes set forth in the said
book: But if any person shall by public preaching, writing, or pryntyng,
contemn, despise, or disprayse the orders contained in the said book, they
shall immediately apprehend him, and cause him to be imprisoned, until he have
aunsweared to the law, upon pain that the chief officers, being present at
any such preaching, and the whole Parish, do aunsweare for their contempt and
negligence. Likewise, if any shall forbear to come to the common prayer, and
receive the Sacraments of the Church, according to the order in the said
book allowed, upon no just and l^full cause: all such persons they shall
inquire of, present, and see punished, and ordered according as is prescribed
in the said Act, with more care and diligence then heretofore has been done:
the which negligence has been cause why such disorders has of late now so
much and in so many places increased and grown.

And if any person shall either in private houses, or in public places, make
assemblies, and therein use other rytes of common prayer and administration of
the Sacraments then is prescribed in the said book, or shall maynteyne in
their houses any persons being notoriously charged by books or preachynges to
attempt the alteration of the said orders, they shall see such persons punished
with all severity, according to the laws of this Realm, by pains appointed
in the said Act.

And because these matters do principally apparteyne to the cure of persons
Ecclesiastical, and to the Ecclesasticall government, her Majesty gives a
most special and earnest charge to all Archbyshoppes, Bishops, Archdeacons,
and Deanes, and all such as have ordinary jurisdiction, in such causes to
have a vigilant eye and care to the observation of the orders and rytes in the
said book prescribed, throughout their cures and Diocese, and to proceed
from time to time by ordinary and Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as is granted
them in the said Act, with all celeritie and severity, against all persons
who shall offend against any of the orders in the said book prescribed, upon
pain of her Majesty's high displeasure for their negligence, and deprivation
from their dignities and benefices, or other censures to follow, according to
their demerites.

Given at Grenewiche the.xx. day of October, 1573. in the fyfteenth year of the
Queens Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by Newgate Market, next unto Christ's Church, by Richard
Judge, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
