A Proclamation for the ordering of Tobacco.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, and His Royal Father of blessed memory,
having at several times and upon several occasions, published their
Proclamations concerning Tobacco, as well that which has been indeauoured to
be planted within this Realm, as that which is of the growth of Virginia and
the Summer Islands, and other English Colonies and Plantations, and also
concerning Spanish and other foreign Tobacco; And finding that the inordinate
desire of taking Tobacco, and the unmoderate thirst of gain, by the planting
and selling of Tobacco, cannot otherwise be allayed or moderated; Has at the
last, by the advice of His Privy Counsel, determined upon this final
resolution touching all sorts of Tobacco, in manner following.

First, His Majesty does hereby declare His Royal Pleasure to be, and does
hereby Will and Command, that no person whatsoever do at any time hereafter,
plant, cherish, or preserve any Tobacco, within these His Realms of England or
Ireland, or Dominion of Wales, or any the Isles, parts, or places, of, or
belonging to them or any of them, and if any be now planted or growing there,
that the same be presently plucked up and utterly destroyed, by the Owners,
Planters, Tenders, or Dressers thereof, and lest they or any of them, should
adventure to neglect the performance hereof, His Majesty does further
straightly charge and command all Constables, Tything-men, Headboroughs, and
other Officers within their several limits and Jurisdictions, carefully and
effectually to see the same executed and performed accordingly. And His
Majesty does further Will and Command all Justices of Peace, Majors,
Sheriffs, and other principal Officers in their several places, within the
compass of their several Jurisdictions and authorities, upon complaint to
them made, to cause the same to be duly performed and executed without
partiality, as they and every of them will answer their contempts in that
behalf at their uttermost perils.

And that the Tobacco of His Majesty's own Plantations and Colonies may not
be planted and imported hither without limitation or measure, or under color
thereof, the Tobacco of the growth of Spain and other foreign parts, may not
be brought into these His Realms, or sold or uttered here, to the overthrow
of His Colonies abroad, and to the wasting of the wealth and treasure of His
Kingdoms at home. His Majesty does further Will and straightly Command, that
no person whatsoever do at any time hereafter import any Tobacco of the
growth of Spain, and other foreign parts out of His own Dominions, nor
sell, utter, or offer to sell, or utter, or otherwise dispose or keep any such
Tobacco, to the intent to sell or utter the same without His Majesty's special
Commission in that behalf, upon pain of confiscation and forfeiture thereof,
in whose hands soever the same shall be found, and upon such further pains and
penalties, as by the Laws of these His Realms, or by His Prerogative Royal
which in this case He will not admit to be disputed, may be inflicted upon the
offenders.

And because such foreign Tobacco, may not be received and uttered, under the
pretense of the Tobacco of the growth of Virginia, the Summer-Ilands, and other
Colonies and Plantations, under, and within His Majesty's own Dominions, nor
the Planters, Owners, or Adventurers, of, and in these Plantations, give
themselves over to the planting of Tobacco only, to make a present return of
profit, and neglect to apply themselves to solid Commodities fit for the
establishing of Colonies, which will utterly destroy these and all other
Plantations; His Majesty does further will and command, that from henceforth
no Tobacco of the growth of Virginia, the Summer-Ilands, or any other
Plantations, or Colonies, of, or within His own Dominions, be imported into
these his Realms or Dominions, or any the Ports, Havens, Creekes, or places
thereof, without His Majesty's especial license in that behalf, under the
great Seal of England, and that upon the importation thereof, the same be
delivered into the hands of such Commissioners, for his Majesty's own
immediate use, as His Majesty under His great Seal of England shall appoint,
at, and for such Prices and Rates to be paid for the same, as shall be
reasonably agreed upon, between the Owners or Factors of the same, and the
Kings Commissioners on His Majesty's behalf, or if they shall not agree
thereon, then to be transported again, and sold elsewhere, upon pain of
confiscation and forfeiture thereof, and upon such further pains and
penalties, as by the Law, or His Majesty's Prerogative Royal may be inflicted
upon them.

And further His Majesty does straightly charge and command, that no person
whatsoever presume to buy any sort of Tobacco, within these Realms or
Dominions, or any Haven, Port, Creek, or place thereof, of any other person,
then of His Majesty's Commissioners only to be authorized under the great
Seal of England, as aforesaid, and after the same shall be sealed with a
Seal to that purpose appointed, and that they, upon the buying thereof, do
express the true time when the same was bought, the quantity and quality
thereof, in and by a note in writing indented between the Buyer and Seller,
testifying the same upon the pains and penalties aforesaid,

And if during these times of Hostility, and Tobacco shall be imported by any
of his Majesty's own Ships, or by the Ships of any of his Subjects, by way
of Prize, or Letters of Marque, his further will and pleasure is, that all such
Tobacco shall be delivered unto his Majesty's Commissioners, at, and for
reasonable prices, to be accomptable therefore to his Majesty's use.

And his Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command, all Customers,
Controllers, Searchers, Wayters, and all other Officers, Ministers, of, or
belonging to His Customs, And also all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Constables, and other Our Officers, Ministers and loving Subjects, in their
several places and degrees, to take knowledge of this his Royal pleasure and
Commandment, and to be ayding, helping and assisting to His Majesty's
Commissioners, and their Deputies, Factors and servants, in all things touching
and concerning this His Service, whereof his Majesty is resolved to require a
due and strict account.

Given at His Majesty's Court at Windsore, the ninth day of August in the third
year of His Reign of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. God save the
King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVII.
