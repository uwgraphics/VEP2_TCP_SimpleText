A Proclamation declaring the Kings Royal pleasure for the Assembling of the
Parliament.
WHereas, for many most important Causes, We have resolved to assemble Our
high Court of Parliament, and to that purpose have already sent forth Our
Writs to summon the same, and have appointed the day of that great Assembly, to
be upon the seventeenth day of March now next coming; And whereas for the
timely preparing and setting to Sea of a powerful Navy, We had directed Our
Letters to be sent unto all the Counties, Cities, and Corporate towns of this
Our Realm, and Our Privy Seals to diuer particular persons, thereby
acquainting them with the necessities of those preparations for Our just
defense against Our Potent enemies, who have strongly combined themselves
against Us and Our friends and Allies, and therefore requiring their cheerful
and speedy aid in a case of such infinite importance: We, having seriously
weighed these things with all the due circumstances thereof, knowing that delay
in matters of this quality and consequence might destroy the work, and that
the opportunity of time once lost is irrecouerable, have therefore determined
to stay the execution and sending forth of those Letters, and also of the privy
Seals, except to Strangers only, and wholly to rely upon the love of Our peope
in Parliament, and not to defer their assembling for this, or any other
occasion, beyond the said first day for that purpose appointed. And because
there may be no mistaking or misunderstanding of Us, or of Our resolutions
herein, We have thought fit, by the advice of Our Privy Council by this Our
Royal Proclamation to publish the same, hereby requiring the members of both
the Houses of Parliament, who are to be the great Council of Us and Our
Kingdom, not to fail of their attendance upon the said seventeenth day of
March now next ensuing, lest being misled by rumors of Proroguing of the
Parliament unto a further day, or for any other respect, the public service of
the Kingdom, wherein We and Our people have so great an interest, might
suffer by their neglect.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the sixteenth day of February, in the third
year of Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVII.
