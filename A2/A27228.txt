Crumbs of Comfort for the Mournful Babe of hope; from one that condoleth the
distress of the Daughter of Sion, that had been healed deceitfully, which
caused her wound again to break out, for which she has suffered reproach; but
the root of the matter being thoroughly searched into, she is now come and
invited to the day of a perfect Cure.
Wherein the ground of all apostasy and backsliding from the Spirit of Truth,
is discovered, and Objections answered, concerning the one Offering, that for
ever has perfected them that are sanctified; how it can be but one Offering,
or offered once for all, and yet he crucified afresh; who in that he dyed once,
dies no more, death has no more dominion; and also how and when the apostasy
came in first?
OH that my voice might be hearkened unto! that it might rend the Clouds, and
that my tender compassions might reach the highest thought of him that has
been exalted in the Seat and Throne of dignity [in the Heavens], and there has
been found accusing the just, provoking God against the Inhabitant of the
Earth; unto whom the woe is come, in what has overtaken him in the way of his
sojourning and traveling [onward] toward the Land of Rest, and City of
everlasting content; and thou poor distressed Babe of hope (in a better life
and state, than this world could afford thee) that art ready at all times to
cry out, What sorrow is like unto my sorrow? and what affliction like unto my
grief? This being a day wherein the Sons of God has come and appeared before
him, and Satan also has come with them; that God could no sooner say, Have
thou considered these? and how they have walked before me with a perfect heart?
[mark that;] but the Devil (that goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom
he may devour, that says, I come from walking up and down in the earth, and
compassing about the same) is ready to reply, Does these serve God for naught?
have thou not done thus and thus for them?

What shall I say unto thee, and for thee? thou art distressed and tossed up
and down, but not forsaken, and thou do not sorrow as one without hope; for
thou have yet a little strength remaining; and sure thy afflictions are come up
before the Lord; but what am I, that I should comfort thee? Only this is my
hearts desire, that my sorrowful complaints might find a place for its
yearnings to rest, and that I might condole thy grief (in a fellow-feeling of
the same;) yea, and that the moan of my pierced, grieved, wounded soul (that I
am sure has entered the highest Heavens, and is come up before the Lord of
Sabbaths;) might congratulate thy sense [with me,] as a rebounding Echo, and
by the rebellious [in heart,] and stiff-necked [in ear,] might no more be
slighted and dis-regarded (as such that cannot hear the voice of the Charmer,
though he charm never so wisely:) but like the deaf Adder, are closed and shut
up (against the breathings of the poor and needy, that dare not despise the day
of small things, but has been thankful for a crum:) And then their Heavens
shall be no more like Brass, nor their Earth as Iron, nor shall an Iron finew
be found on the neck (the place she is to put on the harness;) but the Heavens
will hear the Earth, and the Earth will hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the
Oil, and they will hear Jezerel: that my words may drop toward the four winds
of the Firmaments glory, where stars remain fixed to constellate matter of
praise to him, that di^^^^ (...) ^^cellency of what is lustrous; where I seek
entertainment [only] in the meek and lowly heart, whereby the worker of glory
is endless) has his due and right in me, and all that wait on the power, that
keeps and preserves fixed, and from wandering out of, and above the place and
sphere we are serviceable [in] to the glory of the body, shall never dye, nor
wax old;) Therefore

Consider with me [thou unpityed Babe] though thou art ready to say, None in
all the earth like me; for I see the wicked flourish on every hand, and all
things goes well and are prosperous [with them;] but I am utterly unstript of
all earthly glorying and rejoicing (in any fleshly and selfish confidence;) and
though I fly from the enemy, as one beset with the terrors of the night; yet
how does he follow and surround me? and lays snares for my seer, and a Ginne
and Trap to catch me in my way; so that my besetments are even more than I am
able to bear; and my roarings are all the day long, as one crying out of the
belly of Hell, and out of the grave of sorrow my moan ascends, as he that the
great Leviathan has made to be his prey, and the Net of every Fowler has been
spread in my way, and the cunning Hunter has pursued me [with Dogs;] that as a
Partridge on the Mountains of Israel, I have been hunted for my life, and had
no place of safety, until I came into the low valleys; though my soul panted
after the Lord, more than the Heart for the water brooks: Alas for thee! I know
thy day, and the night of thy sorrow has not been hid from mine eyes, but as
one touched with the feeling of thy infirmity, I can condole with thee, being
satisfied that thou can never sit down and make an agreement with Hell and
the Grave; nor is it possible [in this feeling] any contract should be made
with the wicked, to strengthen the power and dominion of death, or enlarge the
mouth of Tophet, and borders of destruction; yea, and though opportunities of
returning back to thy wooted course, (in which was a seeming pleasure and
content) are daily presented before thee, and instruments are suffered to be
stirred up to that purpose, yet the very thoughts thereof, are a defiance to
thy soul; neither dare thou look back on the pleasures of Egypt, as one
longing for the Onions and Garlic [thereof,] and its Fleshpots (as did, and
does those that were, and are found murmuring and repining, and complaining [by
the way,] at the leadings of the Prophet, (whose carcasses fell in the
Wilderness,) that said, Were there not Graves enough there?) Neither art thou
again to be enchanted with the gluttony of Sodom, that looking back thou
should lose thy shape.

Oh dear heart! Look not out, for there is the Fools eye wandering abroad,
neither look back, least thou be an example [to savor and tincture the
remaining part,] for concerning all such that draw back, Gods Soul has no
pleasure [in them,] because their love grows cold, and such are not fit for the
Kingdom of God (that once had set their hand to the plough and now draws
back;) look not out at the prosperity of the wicked (I say,) either within or
without, nor at thy besettings and huntings up and down, least thy foot almost
slide; but to God (that delivers out of all) let be thy eye of respect; and
what then though thou see the Pharisee making his loud acclamations; Lord, I
thank thee, I am not thus and thus, nor a^ this Publican, but pay tithe of all
that I possess, and fast often; (and the outside of the Cup and Platter, made
very clean) whereas thou art found daily smiting thy hand on thy breast, and
art crying, Lord have mercy on me, etc. and though his cry be stand off, I am
holyer than thou; so that as Joshua [the High Priest] has been found standing
before the Lord (in his filthy vile raiment,) the Devil has been ready to
resist him, until a voice came from the Angel, take away his vile garment, and
give him change of raiment, and thou in like manner see nothing in (in thy
self) but vileness, that (is) in thy flesh, and if thou have ought to boast and
rejoice in (as of thy self;) it must be in that (only) and thy glorying (in thy
infirmities;) which rather humbles thee, and is a Thorn in the flesh, Satan to
buffer, least thou should be exalted above measure (through the abundance of
the Revelations of the Spirit,) that makes thee cry out, O wretched man that I
am! who shall deliver me? and who shall change this vile body?

I say, Is this thy state? and are thy sins and transgressions brought always
before thee? that something seems yet to be imputed and laid to thy charge, and
not all blotted out, and carried into the Land of forgetfulness, especially
when thou look among men of upbraiding minds, and corruptly bent (that are gone
from the Spirit of God, that is liberal and upbraideth no man with things
bypast, as does the world, in the worldly nature, and spirit of mischief, in
their tatlings, tale-bearings, whisperings, backbitings, and false accusations,
and reportings (of evil) in a mind delighted therein, and therewith;) yet let
not this any way trouble thee, as that thou should be led into despondancy
and doubtings, concerning the love, and mercy, and pity, and forgiveness of
God; for Gods way is not like unto man's, not his thoughts like unto his, that
is thus gone out of the life of God, out of the life of forgiveness, and mercy,
and pity, and now would devour and destroy (at once;) but this is the voice of
his Spirit (in the hearts of such,) let not wickedness be so much as once more
mentioned amongst you; for these things are but the shame of thy youth, and the
reproach of thy widow hood, which no more shall be remembered, nor charged
against thee (by God,) since thy return has been (indeed and in truth,) to
him, and he is returned to thee, and will blot out thy iniquities (bypast) and
thy sins will remember no more; because these things were done in a state and
time of ignorance (in which God has winked at thy faults, or corrected thee
lightly (with Rods) and they are transgressions against the first Covenant,
which the one offering has made the atonement for, and a way of
reconciliation for thee (therein) in the flesh of his body, that put an end to
the many offerings under the Law, and also blots out all the infirmities (both
of thy actings and offerings) in that state; unto whom thou coming, (as unto a
stone (indeed) disallowed of by all the master builders of the earth, he is
precious (in thy lively faith) as the head of the Corner: that was once offered
up for all (in the eternal spirit of the Fathers good pleasure) and is offered
up no more, in that he has for ever perfected them that are sanctified.

For in that spirit thou art come and returned to (that thou see sin a burden
to thee, in, and of which thou art weary and heavy laden) God will freely blot
out, and do all for thee, that have an offering brought before thee that is
everlasting, and so is the Covenant (thereof) in the eternal spirit (of him
that sanctifies) and not as was, and is the offerings and Covenants under the
Law, that were confirmed by strength of words, and declarations of a Testament
(in which a better good was shadowed out,) and the promises therein, and
thereof, confirmed by an Oath, and strong Protestations; but this is finished
(to and for all that can believe (therein,) whose Maker is their Husband, the
Lord of Hosts is his name; and the betrothment (here) is in righteousness, and
in faithfulness, and in loving kindness (for ever;) and all that thou have to
do, is to believe perfectly and fully, and wholly (in him, and the goodness of
his salvation;) and he will do all (for thee, and in thee,) without thy
workings, and actings, and strivings, and buslings (in a mind cumbred with the
cares and sorrow of a life below, wherein thy soul has been pierced through
with many darts, and it has been, and proved the worldly sorrow that works
death;) yea, and by it all thou could not add a cubit to thy stature, but
by believing in him that has wrought, and done the work, it is finished (to
thee) in thy faith; for the questionings and reasonings (thereof) with all the
doubtings, and fear, and distrust of God, are but the enemies work (of
darkness and clouding thoughts, that has veiled the extent of Gods goodness,
and love, and pity, and mercy [to the souls necessity;] that the largeness
thereof (in the unspeakable, and unalterable bounty of his liberallity) has
not been apprehended and seen into; and all this continues by reason of
unbelief, which the Son of God is come to destroy, and to that end is he
manifest; and he thou must believe in [that is already come,] to work all thy
works (in thee and for thee,) er'e it can be the work of the eternal spirit [in
God,] and all to continue and remain eternally [with thee,] that of thy joy and
rejoicing, there be no end, and the comfort everlasting [that abides with
thee,] that art comforted in the eternal Spirit of God, and what it works
(Without thy help, as a Creature in the old man and state;) but in the new man,
as new created after God; in which thou art a meet help unto thy Maker, and
fellow-worker together [with him,] to bring forth his works into manifestation
and appearance; and then thou can say [truly,] that to destroy the works of
the Devil is Gods work, and the end for which he was made manifest [in thy
mortal flesh,] and because of that part (mortality, in which he has wrought,
and works,) thou have felt the work of mortification to be [also] the work of
God, and so is sanctification, and justification; for it is God that must kill
and make alive, and to all the works of the enemy, must make thee dead, and
then holy and just [after himself;] which thou art on him waiting [to do for
thee,] knowing that of thy self thou art able to do nothing; and when thou have
done all that thou can (as of thy self) art but an unprofitable servant; yet
that little strength thou have [in God,] thou art ready and willing to put
forth; because thy faith [in God,] works by the Love of God shed abroad in thy
heart, and so thou can show thy faith by its work, the work of love; that is
the ground and foundation of it (in thy heart;) in that of those three, Faith,
Hope, and Charity, that is the greatest, as being the bond of perfection: And
this is it thou art differenced (by,) from the worst of men, even by the love
of God, and his grace, and favor (therein,) and flowing forth therefrom, that
thereby thou have a Christians mark, and by all men art known to be a Disciple
and Follower of Christ, because of thy love, by which thou art translated from
death to life, or that thou can not see any thing hurtful (to thee,) in the
first death, even of the body (in, and under the enemies power fallen.)

Object. But in that thou art further reasoning; yes this I believe, that God
has blotted out all my former transgressions, (now I am come to lay hold on
him (by faith) and my sins (in the time of ignorance) I believe are winked at,
(by God,) but since that day I have sinned, and come short of the glory of God
(who never did evil,) and this appears (to me) to be a sin of wilfulness, and
a falling away after I have tasted of the Heavenly gift, and of the power of
the world to come; and so being against the grace and favor of God (though I
cannot say it was, and is in despite to the spirit of grace, but is through the
weakness of the flesh, that wars and lusts against the spirit (that is
willing to obey and follow God (in the regeneration,) wherever he goes, yet
there remains nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery
indignation from Heaven (on that part and nature in me,) that thus has
betrayed the Just under sufferance (again) and has crucified the Son of God
afresh; who in that he dyed once for all, dies no more (for me,) in that death
has no more dominion over him (but by and through me,) and there remains no
more offering for sin; therefore what have I to offer up to make a second
atonement?

Answ. The atonement is already made for thee ( in thy faith,) though not in
the doubting and unbelieving mind and part, for that was it that betrayed the
Just under sufferance (again,) and is the unrepenting part and nature (of
Esau,) that has been hunting abroad for its prey, and so has lost the
blessing and birthright, and cannot again be renewed by any worldly sorrow (in
the daily and hourly repentings of the worldly mind, that may seek a place of
acceptance (thereof,) which cannot be found;) but in the Godly sorrow is the
repentance never to be repented of; and so Judgment witnessed and born (again)
on that mind, and part, and nature, that has went out to the burdening and
crucifying of the Just (afresh;) and thus is Sion redeemed, even through the
Spirit of judgment, and of burning, where the house of Esau is as stubble, and
the house of Joseph for a flame, that leaves it neither root nor branch; and so
the root of the matter (that was once within,) a bitter root of envy, and that
has lusted to vanity, and in which thou have used the liberty (of what had the
beginning of its work in thee,) as an occasion to the flesh, and cloak of
maliciousness; (that thy joy and content has not continued, and the
satisfaction thou once began to take (in God,) when thy Castle seemed to be
strong, and thou to say in thy heart, I shall never be moved, is not lasting,
but in the hiding of Gods face to thee (in that state,) thou art presently
troubled, this being removed by the Ax that is laid to the root of the tree (as
those hidden things of Esau are sought out) the matter is clearly seen, that
has caused the wound of the Daughter of Gods people to be healed deceitfully;
and while the Core of corruption wrought (thus hiddenly and secretly) needs
must there be the breakings out of the botches and boils, of that imposterous
infection of depraved nature, that has contracted guilt on the soul, and made
thee like a Tree that cumbers the good ground of God (in which his mercy, and
pity, and grace, and forbearance has wrought, for any honesty of heart God
has beheld,) that being wearied out, and weary to bear thee [any longer,] the
Angel Mowers are seen come forth to reap the earth; and a voice comes, Cut it
down, so: it has a curse, because of unfruitfulnesse [to him that looked for
fruit, but beheld none,] no Figs for his taste; and then why cumbers it the
ground?

So that that part in which the enemy has wrought, after the grace, and love,
and favor of God, is or has been manifest (to a condition thy souls peace,
and good is concerned in,) is that which the Judgment is to, that is to be
laid to the Line, and Righteousness to the Plummet, and so comes Sion [again]
the Daughter of God, to be healed and cured perfectly, that is redeemed by
Judgment, and her Converts with Righteousness; and though the sinner in Sion
be afraid, and fear does surprise the heart of the hypocrite [whose hope is
perished and perishing,) yet is not this [thee] that art again returned unto
God, and do love his Judgments, and can truly say, O how I love thy Law!
that is sweeter to me than the honey, and the honeycomb; and thy Commandments
are not grievous, and burdensome [to me;] no; though thou have felt a part, was
afraid of Judgment, to which, and in which the fear of death wrought, and
wherein was received the spirit of bondage, that it was made subject [to,] that
feared death (on a part and mind, it delights [in] in the world;) where was the
fearful looking for of judgment, and a spirit of bondage [received] again to
fear, that concerning the coming of Christ [to judgment,] and his day of
vengeance [on the world,] might be terrified with Letters and Epistles, because
of the falling away; for else that day had not come, 2 Thessalonians. 1.

And yet let this comfort thee, though many may be upbraiding thee, and thou
may be made sad, that God has not made sad; yea, though many may say, I am
not so, and it has not been so with me; but they have left thee smiting thy
hand on thy breast, etc. thou art rather justified [in this state] than the
other (he that thinks his standing is, and has been so sure; (that is like a
Rock) concerning whom it may be said, his confidence is strong, and on that
Rock God will build his Church;) but being held in the wrong mind and part, and
the confidence of, and in the flesh, and selfs work (for see presently, when
the sufferings are foretold of [to and in that part,] Master save thy self, and
then, Get thee behind me Satan;) Oh was not this the part to which the Corn,
and Wine, and Oil increased! and that would say, It is good to be here, and
would erect and build a Tabernacle in the transfiguring glory of his raiment
[shining,] and to hear a voice from the glorious Majesty, this was strength and
confidence enough (what never be moved?) but it was but the Lions day yet, and
he was not brought to lie down with the Lamb; but Moses and Elias was seen to
be talking with the Lord of that glory, that by the roaring of the Lion, made
the Beasts of the field to tremble; but see, the thing being come to be
effected, that was foreseen and talked of, the Cock did but crow, and the Lion
trembles; this was self-denial indeed; for the way was making and preparing for
the Lambs day, and all the self-confidence proved but a Christ denial, that he
might see himself, that by the Cock-crow had that foretold of, brought to
remembrance, and then he went forth and wept bitterly; and after repentance
aright, came to conversion (Peter, when thou art converted, strengthen thy
Brethren; but this might seem a strange saying, after he had been his Follower
and Disciple;) and then could he tell of the more sure word of prophecy,
whereunto they did well to take heed, as unto a Light that shined in a dark
place, until the day dawned, and the day star to arise in the heart; here the
Cock had crew, and the day had dawned, the Lambs day, and the day star had
arisen in the heart, and so no need of counsel from the wise men of the world
concerning his birth; for he is come to feed his Lambs, his Sheep, and such a
Shepherd sees his star; for God who commanded the light to shine out of
darkness, has shined in the dark heart, to give the knowledge of God in the
face of Jesus.

Thus spoke I comfortably to thee that have a sense of these things; for while
Gods face was hid, thou were troubled; but now his countenance is lifted up,
thou art more glad than when Corn, and Wine, and Oil increased [mark thee, more
glad;] for there was gladness then, and a face of the love of God, his
countenance seemed to shine, and his favor to be on the dwelling place; but
this was but the array of Solom^n in his glory, and the life was yet subdued in
hope (that gloryed in an endless joy and rejoicing;) yet was shut up under the
Law, until a faith afterward to be revealed; and then all the care is cast on
God, and the more sure word heeded [that is that faiths begetter,] that leads
out of the world, and to consider the Lillyes glory, and for raiment and food
is no care [in the worlds mind and spirit,] and Solomon in all his glory was
not thus arrayed; where the life comes to be seen, more than meat, and the
body, than raiment; and then see thou all the things after which the Gentiles
seek; and here is the faith of the elect of God, of Christ the Son of God: and
the life I now live is by the faith of the Son of God (thou may truly say,)
yet not thee, but Christ that lives in thee; and because he lives, thou live
also; and he being revealed [in thee,] thou can say, Christ in me, the hope
of glory; and so there is no glorying in the flesh, and any fleshly appearance,
but in him in whom is hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and then
the fear in, and of the worldly mind, and all therein held and retained, comes
to dye to thee, and in thee, and thee to, and in it, (as thou art found dead to
the Law, which when it came, revived sin, and thou dyed; for by it thou were
slain,) and then death has no more dominion, but the Babe of salvation is lift
up, and thou can say, Now let thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation, etc. And here the child dies a hundred years old, and the
sinner a hundred years old, dies accursed; for the old man, that has been
waiting for the salvation of God, sees the end of its expectation, and the
servant [in the House of God] that has been faithful in all his House, as
Moses was faithful therein [as a servant,] delivers up all to the Son, as the
Builder of the House (that is more worthy of honor than Moses;) and so the old
man and his deeds (that was, and is the transgressor, and is accursed under the
Law of its works,) comes to be judged and condemned [by Moses in whom he has
seemed to trust,] because he was got into Moses's Seat, and Choice, and thou
come to dye, and be dead to him, and he to thee, and the daily dying is known
and witnessed, and the daily living [to God] felt; and the cost and charge of
the building is considered of, and counted; and all reckoned on to be given up,
and the life lost for its souls salvation sake; and what is here to lose or be
afraid of? seeing thou art resolved to trust God with all, both soul, body,
and spirit, and the work of thy souls salvation; which thou can not any
longer reason and dispute, or question and distrust; but believe in the
salvation, and goodness, and love, and mercy, and pity, and free grace (of
God) thou do; and if thou perish, thou concludest it shall be in the hands of
God (having nothing else to trust in, nor no where else to fly; but as one
which is stripped of all earthly, and creaturely dependence, art resolved there
to lie and remain, even at the foot of mercy; and in it to rest, and trust, and
confide, until help and deliverance come, and spring up, and arise over all,
beneath that which is eternal.

And then thou see, whatever work is in thee, and for thee wrought, is by
the Spirit of God, through thy faith therein, and not thine own work; but is
Gods own work, in and by the Spirit of his Son; that only does praise God, and
so does not at all praise and glorify self, and boast in the flesh, as that
thou art this and this, and he is that; alas! no, of this thou art ashamed,
and to meddle of, and with controversies about different opinions and
judgments, or anoy and upbraid such with any sin and wickedness, that thou
may get the victory and mastery, is not thy work (in that Spirit of God thou
art returned unto;) but readily say, How can we boast in those things,
whereof we are now ashamed? and God that knows my secrets, knows how it has
been with me, and what I have been; so that I find no cause to insult and boast
over any, nor to upbraid the worst of men; for that does but provoke unto
mischief, and stir up strife and contention; and at best can but bring the
creature to look at himself, and what he has been and done, that may cause a
looking back again (if the forgiveness of God be not seen into;) and thus to
bring off the mind from looking at God and his work [again,] that in love, and
pity, and mercy, and salvation [to the soul of the creature,] had let him see
himself, and a way to escape the snares, and baits, and temptation of Satan
(through a sense of forgiveness that came up in the manifesting cause) to look
at men's hardness, and ruggedness, and want of love and mercy, and pity, and
forgiveness, is not at all my work, but is beneath me, and out of my way [I
walk in;] for it is not as I would be done by; in that God who has healed my
backsliding freely [for his own name sake,] has made me of the same mind to
others; knowing that he is blessed that covers and hides sin and
transgression, by converting a sinner to God (where a multitude of fauls are
blotted out;) and for me to uncover what God has hid, and reveal, and di^close
another shame, and nakedness, would get me but an ill name, (that cannot
delight in the destruction of any, as God does not;) neither have I any joy to
hear and see any ones backslidings, but must pity them with my heart, and pray
for, and wish their return [again,] unto God, else I should degenerate from
what God has made me, and change from my natural disposition: And this is

Because God has proved the good Physician, and does heal perfectly; he is the
good Samaritan that binds up the wound; and in the day that I was cast out in
the open fields, when no eye pityed me, but I was naked, as in the day that I
was born, neither salted nor swadled at all, neither was I washed in water to
supple me, nor any garment put on, and over me, to cover and hide my deformity;
but I was in my blood, then did God pity me, and in my blood, said, Live; and
has done all these things for me, though the Priest and Levite passed by, and
there was no bowels among men [of that spirit,] and he being come to the lost
sheep of the House of Israel, and to gather a remnant of the outcasts of such;
and to call the sinner to repentance, and not the righteous; and to the sick,
and poor, and needy, and weary, and maimed, having lift up his voice, and
stretched out his hand; what shall I turn my back against such a work? shall I
be offended because he talks with the Samaritan woman (because she has no
fellowship with the Jews?) and that because he asks her for water? or that
he has entered the house of a Pharisee, and there has been found eating with
the Publicans? Oh! no; such work is not the work of God [in me,] but Gods work
has confounded it all of this nature; and the upbraider cannot stand here; in
that I am come to the liberality of God, to the inlargednesse of heart to him,
and to be upheld and sustained, and supported by his free spirit; by the work
of the Spirit of Truth, that makes free indeed; and to use my liberty as an
occasion to the flesh, or cloak of maliciousness, I cannot, nor dare, I be so
imbondaged to Jew or Greek, Barbarian, or Scythian, bond or free, male or
female, Samaritan, or Pharisee, that I should forget that love that would do
good to all, and thinks well of the work of God toward all.

So that concerning the Apostate, and Back-slider, and Prodigal; I dare not
accuse any particular sect, or opinion, or persuasion, or person of men (in
such persuasions,) as that you or thou art the only Apostate, and Backslider;
but I do see a part (in all,) as it has been and is wrongly persuaded and
opinionated, that until the creature be again returned (in it, and from the
cause of its digression, degeneration, and depravation,) is that Apostate,
Back-slider, from the Commandments of God, and prodigal from the Spirit of
truth, the Fathers house and dwelling place; to wit, the flesh; and it was and
is the cause of the breach between God and his creature, which no upbraidings
can heal, neither is the Spirit of God (even it and him that God was in before
the world began, reconciling it to himself;) but that all might be laid wast of
this nature, (...) (in and over all) these things has b^^^ suffered, even
breach upon breach, and devotion upon devotion, and in the midst of heaps of
confusion, is God come to and bringing up order; who must be, and himself (is)
come to be, the healer, and repairer, and restorer thereof, ere the healing can
be perfect; and by his Spirit that many are come to, they see into the cause
and ground of all these things, and of all botches, and boyles, and putrified
sores, and breakings out (in the particulars of persons, or in any particular
people, gathered into a body (infected with the deadly wound of an imposterous
nature) under men's daubings with untempered mortar, that cry peace while their
mouths are put into;) and such patched up health, could never long continue in
a commonwealths body; but since God is come to do the work, and has
undertaken the cure, that will be the teacher of his people himself, their
Counselor, Judge, Lawgiver, Instructor, Correcter, Physician, and All in
all, I question not a perfect cure of all that is amiss, that such are
witnesses of, that come unto him through faith, in the life of forgivness, the
Sons life, that is the repairer of all breaches, and the restorer again of a
path to dwell in; and then out of all the self-boastings and confidence in and
of the world.

And thus, though sin has abounded, yet grace has much more abounded; but not
that we should continue in sin, God forbid; but all having sinned and come
short of the glory of God, thou that art brought into the sense hereof, art not
in the worst state, neither is there any ground of despondency and doubtings
(to thee) of Gods favor (of thee) thus returned into a sense of the work of
God, and into faith in the workers will and good pleasure; whatever hard
judgment and usage thou meet with among men of different judgments and
opinions; for thou art not left alone, and let them upbraid and mock on, be
thou still and wait in patience, out of the grumbling, murmuring, complaining
nature, and thou will come over it all, and grow through all reproach of this
nature, until thou come to leave such works withering and dying, as untimely
fruit; but look thou at God in the midst of all, and let them taunt on; they
cannot hurt and stop thy glorying in a life that is out of the worlds reach to
hurt, though in this life (of the ^^^sh, and (...) ^^^yings,) they may think
they hurt thee; but thou art as willing to dye from that, as all things else,
and thy repute is not a creaturely esteem, but through bad reports have learned
to pass, as well as good reports; and can say, If my hope was in this life,
I was of all men most miserable; but Christ in me is the hope of my glory, with
whom my life is hid, and in him is hid all my treasure, etc. And when he my
life appears, I shall appear with him in glory. And that which has been done
in secret shall be manifest openly, and what spoken in the ear, preached on the
house top; but until he appear to be my life, I must suffer with him, waiting
for a further manifestation of his glory, and the appearance of the Son of God
therein.

And so for reports, alas! thou can not but know more of thy self (in the
root and ground of things, and that to the light and heart-searching spirit art
come,) than men can have to accuse thee; and now being come to know nothing by
thy self, yet thou art not thereby justified; what therefore is in this, more
than to manifest the frame and temper of such spirits? that yet have a root of
the same hidden (that in thee has broken forth,) and thou art therefore like
to come first to the day of healing; for their covering, and false healing, is
the same that was thine; and thus have they been daubing, and are daubed (with
untempered mortar,) as thou were; in that the same that has been upbraiding
(when it is displeased) will flatter when it is pleased, and is it that is
flattered; deceiving; and being deceived: Therefore whatever they threaten, and
wait to see concerning thee, wish not the same to them, (no not in thy heart,
because of him that sees its secrets,) but wait on the Lord for preservation,
and the end of that spirits wo^k thou shall see manifest before thee, and shall
be made able to judge of it: And then, as to thy state, thou will see, there is
no need of a second offering or atonement, for the offering is through the
eternal Spirit, once for all, and the atonement for ever perfecting, in the
sanctified life, and in thy going from that Spirit, and the sense therein and
thereof begotten, the life of God has been brought into a suffering state, and
to be afresh crucified, which thou being again returned to, and with the Spirit
(that manifests the cause thereof) come into unity, feel the atonement
make^, and the atonement making to be for ever; and then what the many
offerings (under the Law of works, where was the blood of Bulls, and Goats of a
year old, and sprinklings of an Heifer,) could not do, in that they make
nothing perfect, ^s pertaining to the Conscience, thou being come to that which
manifests the nature that the Bull was a figure of, and also the Goat [at
left hand;] that being offered up and slain on the Cross, all sufferance to
the Lamb, (that went before for a peace offering, and is the atonement maker,)
cease, and so the offering is but one, and once for all; that being offered
to God, which his Spirit has begotten and wrought; and the kindling and
inflaming being of that nature; and so no false fire put into thy Sensure.

Object. 2. All this I confess very true to my condition, (concerning the
cause and ground of the apostasy and backsliding, and falling away [from the
truth of God] in the prodigality of that mind (a part and nature in the
creature,) that could not be content to trust the Father withal, and to have
the portion in his hands;) and now I plainly see that the Apostate and
Backslider, and Prodigal, is not so much such a Sect, or Opinion, and
Persuasion, and People of such a different Judgment from me (though I confess
in these different Persuasions, some are more deeply tainted with this
apostatizing spirit, than other-some;) as the spirit and nature of a part (in
all,) that has backsliden from the Law and Commandments of God, and in the
adulteration of that mind has been caused the breach that is yet standing,
between God and his Creture, until the spirit of atonement and reconciliation,
be so received and adhered to, that it make up all again: And seeing thou art
not in Paul's state (of unconversion, from the ignorance of a blind zeal, that
persecuted, and spoke evil of that he knew not,) when concerning the Law, he
could say, he was blameless, yet was one at whose feet was laid the garments
of the witnesses; neither art crying, Lo here, or Lo there; or, I am of Paul,
or Apollo, etc. but art found comforting the Babe, and partaking with the
afflicted in (their way,) and as one that has passed through the state and
condition I am in, and that would not have sin and wickedness countenanced
(under any pretense whatever,) but the creature of God pityed in every state
(betrayed under the enemies power,) and yet the Axe of God laid to the root of
the tree, and the root of the matter (relating to the cause and ground of the
apostasy and backsliding from the truth of God,) seen into, that it may be
removed and taken out of the way of God utterly; the conditions of many being
concerned herein, I further query, how and when it came in? and how it may be
removed again (perfectly?) seeing it is generally the voice and cry of the
world, it came in but just now, and that the deceiver entered but as in their
days (and yet excuse themselves of his entering of them, that they may lay the
burden heavy on others.)

Answ. The first Apostate was old Adam, that went from the guidance and
government of the Spirit of God; and as all have taken a nature and part from
him (who was of the earth earthly, and as was the earthly, so are they that are
earthly,) though he was made a living soul, nevertheless, the soul that sinned
having dyed (in the day he eat of the forbidden fruit,) and so death having
past over all from Adam, etc. all are to wait (again) for, and in the power of
the second Adam, a quickening spirit; and yet as to the first man (as he was,
and is a natural man,) he was betrayed under, and into this state, and is not
properly reckoned for the sinner and offender and transgress^r (as to the
natural part;) further than creatures (in it,) are so joined and united to the
cause (thereof,) that they neglect the work of that, and him, who gives the
sight of the misery (of such state,) and so in the end comes to slight and
dis-regard the remedy out of it; for the mystery of iniquity (that has
wrought, and yet works in the hearts of many opp^sers of the work of the Spirit
of Truth there,) is spiritual wickedness in high places; so that though death
came on the bodies of all, as by one man that sinned (they have taken a nature
and part from,) for the souls sake, that is immortal, whom the tribulation and
anguish has rested on; as a death that came by reason and means of sin; yet
the feeling of a remedy to the one (to wit, the soul, once relapsed and fallen
under the power of a second death,) is through the begettings and working up of
a faith in the spirit of him that endured the one, for the conquering the
dominion and power of both.

Thus is there a man of sin, or man by whom came sin, whom God will destroy by
the breath of his lips and nostrils, and brightness of his appearance (with an
everlasting destruction,) and yet not properly the first man Adam, and natural
body (of elements,) the creature of God was betrayed (in) under the enemies
power; but he in all the world is to be redeemed and restored (to wit the
creature of God,) and nothing lost [of him,] that comes into his hands, who is
the Redeemer and Restorer: yet as the Elements are not properly the creature of
God, but that which the creature embodyed a being [in,] to and for self; for
redemption sake (from a state it was fallen in under, and of the body that
suffered, and which he suffered [in,] through the fall;) as self comes thus to
be destroyed [by a destruction that is everlasting,] the body thereby coming to
suffer under the power of a death and destruction [in time and place,] is
restoring in time and place, and restored out of time and place (in the end
thereof, that was the beginning;) and then the first beauty is known, which God
created all things beautiful in, (when he set the world in their hearts, that
no man can find out the works of God, from the beginning to the end;) which is
all the work of the Spirit of God, and attained by a faith therein, where is
[only] everlasting safety, in a feeling of the spirit of the world, and the way
and course thereof (it has led into, and under,) that has made the body vile
(in the oldnesse of that state, self has made miserable and wretched,) and
then are the groanings and sighings felt, of that and him that has begotten
into a sense of the Spirits sufferance (that makes intercession with that which
cannot be uttered,) and so a fellow-feeling of the sufferers glory dwelt in (in
a hope that keeps waiting [for,] and faith that believes [in,] the perfect, and
through redemption and restoration [again,] of the creature (into a state it is
fallen from.) Therefore

The first Apostate being described [in his place,] with the ground and cause
thereof [to wit of the apostasy,] this I have further to say to the remaining
root (of what continues undestroyed of the part and nature that was, and is
found in the cause;) Though the cause of the first breach was found in the
first Adam (in a nature he became embodyed [in] male and female:) where the
woman was most properly seen and found in the cause of the first transgression
against, and erring and straying from the Spirit of God; yet that being not so
much the cause and ground of the apostasy, as the deceitful healing [is,]
after the breach has been made; wherein Adam has been found hunting about the
Garden, and running among the Trees [for shelter,] as one afraid because of
transgression, and making to them aprons and coverings of Fig Leaves; let this
be thoroughly searched into; and then all false coverings must off, and the root
will come to be removed (from whence the cause of all complaints has
proceeded,) until which time the daubings will be still, but with untempered
mortar, and the false gloss will remain over every work of fallen man; and
here you will find the cause to be the nature of what was first degenerated
[from God,] and still is generated [in,] the cause and ground of the man's fall
and backsliding; in which came up a Law, which sin and the man of sin took
occasion [by,] and offerings under the Law, which made nothing perfect, as
pertaining to the Conscience; but served for the bringing in of a better hope,
a hope in a better life (then that of the fall and transgression from God,
which all creatures live, and move, and have their being (in) under the
sufferance of Gods Spirit, as that which came and was taken from him, but abode
not in his will and good pleasure;) so that as far forth as any man's hope of
glory is in this life, the Law is not at an end, nor the one offering rested
and trusted (in,) that makes a perfect-atonement, but the remembrance is
tinctured with the first Priest-hoods work (whose lips was to preserve
knowledge,) and so sin again is brought to the remembrance, after there has
been a coming to the one offering, that was offered up once for all; and the
Law can never be put an end to (here,) the bringing up of which declared the
everlasting High Priest to be come, and an everlasting Priesthood, the
atonement maker for all; but since the Watchmen has been hunted after, and
there has been a going down into Egypt for help (as if there was no Balm in
Gilead, or no Physician there,) it is seen what they have done, and what is the
most that the many Pastors can do? even smite, and wound, or take away thy
vail; so that thou must get thee out besides the Shepherds Tents, to find the
place he makes his flock to lie down in, and rest at noonday, even in him that
is a shadow from the heat, and refuge from the storm; experience being my best
Teacher, in this condition, I see no trusting in man, but vain is the hope of
all such confidence; and now being returned to God, I find a place of safety,
something of bread in my own house, and water in my own Cistern; and it being
my own, and not a strangers; here I come to set down under my own vine, and
under my own fig tree, and none can rise up to make me afraid; but God is to me
all that I want or stand in need of, both Husband, Teacher, Physician, and all
in all, and what need can I have [here,] either of fruit of my body to rejoice
in? or substance of and for my souls content; of cure for my wounds, or health
to my disease; since in him is both health to my soul, and counsel and advice
[is] in him, to answer all my disquietness: oh I have enough! since I have
again found him whom my soul loves, this is my first beloved, whom I will hold,
and never more will let him go; when he meets me without, he satisfies me with
kisses, and this is he I have longed for all my life long.

And now I am over-joyed at his coming, at our meeting again, to find his
Arms so open, and feel his embraces so near; though I had put him off with
delays, and had wandered after other lovers, until I saw my way hedged up with
thorns, that I could no longer pass on, and that I was among the swine, (in a
prodigality of the Harlots love,) and there longed for my belly full of husks,
but there was found none to give them me; I had a yoke of oxen to try, and a
wife to marry, and father to bury; and having put off my coat, said, how shall
I put it on? and having washed my feet, how shall I defile them? yet he never
has me denied (in what ever I have been found asking [in faith;]) and this
breaks my heart more than all, his love, notwithstanding my ingratitude; but
being thus returned, I find in the house, a home-born son, that is elder by
birth, than I; and he has the name of a Jew, but is only one outwardly, for
inwardly he is ravening, though his begrutchings and grumblings [at me,] are
always with this exclamation, Thou know I never went out of the house, as
has this prodigal, and played such pranks as he, but have abode always at
home, and now must the best robe be fetched down for him? and must there be the
music for him, and the fatted calf killed? when did thou ever thus for me?
Thus is the repiner (at the Fathers will and good pleasure) a daily burden to
my soul; for it came into my heart to return to my father, and to say, Father I
have sinned against heaven, and against thee, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants (considering that in my
fathers house was many servants, and they had bread enough, and I a son did
want;) and finding his love and forgiveness beyond compare, as much was
forgiven me, so I cannot but love much, and therefore the father being found
falling on my neck and kissing me, and crying out, This my son was lost, and he
is found, he was dead and he is alive; the whole earth is disquieted at the
matter; And he that was a Jew [outwardly] and was broken off, for the
reconciling of the world, whose receiving in again should be as life from the
dead, has been found nothing at all differing from the Gentile that had the
outward Court given into his hands to trample on, and now has been found
exercising authority and Lordship over the flock and heritage of God, that
would boast it self against the branches, as though he bare the root, and not
the root him; for the Lion being come forth of the thickets, and the destroyer
of the Gentile on his way, one is found that has again persuaded Japhet to
dwell in the Tents of Shem, though once it was said, Who shall? And this has
broken down the wall, and here is neither Jew nor Greek, etc. but the Lion lies
down with the Lamb, and gives up the day to him, as he has had his day; so
that while the wrath is kindled but a little, there is a trusting in him, and a
kissing the Son, least he be angry, and the Sun go down in wrath; and because
of this blessed, the whole earth is amazed, as such that call to the rocks and
mountains to fall on them, and hide and cover them from the wrath of the Lamb;
in that flying from a Lion that was in their way, a Bare has met them, and
laying their hands, and leaning on a wall, a Cockatrice has bitten them; and
that which might have been killed and trampled on [in the Egg] is now become a
fiery flying Serpent.

And what now shall I sing? but, oh the Lambs day! here is no need of Sun by
day, nor Moon by night, but the Lamb is the light of the glorious City, which
is as the light of seven days, and is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and
the Government is on his shoulders, that has brought on a mountain where none
can hurt and destroy, so that greater is the glory of the latter house, then
the glory of the first (in which the grumbler is found, as that which (...)
never went out of, but is the outward Court [only] the Gentile has trodden
under foot;) And how does my soul sing, to see this day? in that greater is he
that is in us, than he that is in the world, that does hate and persecute us,
and has spoken all manner of evil against us, for the namesake of God, though
once we were our own, and went whither we would; but now we are bought with a
price, and another girds us, and carries us where we would not, and all the
ways of sin and wickedness, we hate with a perfect hatred, and count it worse
than poison to the body, (whatever we have been) and fly from it more than from
a Lion; And this is my living testimony before a heart-searching God, that I
would rather presently and immediately dye and be stricken with the wound of a
bitter enemy, than in my self or any one else (wittingly and willingly)
countenance any thing a known sin against the Spirit of God, it being my burden
to look back on what I have offended him in.

Therefore now will I sing a song of my well beloved, of the salvation of my
God, from his own work that does praise him [in my heart,] who is to me my all,
my King, that in a time of need [to me] deliverance did bring, that from all
hurt my soul redeemed, and from the sting, of death, of grave, of hell, of
bitter pangs; when enemies without and within did hunt, to catch my feet in
snares, and sought to wound, the precious life of what in love rebounds to God
in thanks, above all mortals reach; Oh he does still support! that keeps me
fresh, to live to love, and love to praise his name, that does surround, while
I abound, and still its he, is my enough, that fills my cup, that sweetens all,
he is my Physician, my stay, my staff of bread, of water, my rock, my song,
that empties, that fills, that makes poor, that makes rich, that kills, that
makes alive, that is to me a Garden enclosed, a watered bank, a fountain
sealed, from the robbers reach; I am lost, and again am found; in him, I mourn,
and then I sing, because I am full, and yet cannot have too much of him; and
this I seal with life, with blood, with cross, that has a Crown, because my
crown is lost, it is cast down; in that which frontils high, did never deny,
could never withstand; for it is in breast, and not in tongue, nor yet a hand,
an empty hand, oh, no! it is that which can command, and yet I choose, that I may
refuse, what love would abuse; and make that grow cold, which makes me so bold,
in what does withold; in boasting above, the measure of love, that purely
does move, to kiss and embrace, the lips of that face, whose heart does grace,
the virgins eye, that can espy, who is so nigh; to bless a Troop, that now can
stoop, to hear my voice, that does rejoice, The Babe.

Postscript.
IF curious eyes, or subtle wits, would judge what here I write,
They first must lose, what I have done, and that will give them sight
Into the order I behold, that is not graced with art,
But does be fool, and then make wise, to learn another part;
Then that which leaves a road for fools, to taunt in verse or rhyme,
As though to voice they seet would make, that he may go betime;
That coming forth so soon, is lamed, and then its hard to find,
The minds right way, to be received, in what its made thus blind.
First crossed, then lost, till up in view all is brought,
That blinds the mind, that seeks to find out such a work is wrought,
Which shows the cause, why peace is lost, with God, and then with man,
And while its loved, cannot be removed, let wit do what it can;
For who can say, that this I was, but I can yet say more,
That once was courted for my wit, which each Sects did adore;
Both high and low, both poor and rich, the small and eke the great,
In many cases made me Judge, when I refused the seat;
But I seek [now] a servants place, and yet am often controlled,
Because through love, I choose a life, that durst not self imbold;
As sure do those, that once I thought, possessed a better place,
Than I can see them keep or hold, to make their name a grace;
And therefore since, I this have los^, what more have I to lose,
That once was clipped about, in arms, of such that me did choose;
Before the Nobles of the earth, that sure were left behind,
To choose what I had chosen first, which they could never find;
Yea in the lap of favor was a knee, where I was dandled,
How ever roughly I am used, and coursely I am handled;
But now cast down, I has my Crown, and count it all but dross,
That once seemed gold, for to behold; though dung, its made my cross;
Crossed, crowned, renowned, and all in one, and in that one is all,
That keeps me safe, on ground to walk, while climbers take a fall;
Ah blessed God! be thou my guide, and keep me to thy praise,
And thou shall have both heart and mind, given up to thee always.
R. B.
