A Proclamation, set forth by the kings Majesty, with thassent of his detest
uncle, Edward Duke of Somerset, Governor of his most royal person, and of
his realms, dominions and subjects Protector, and others of his most
honorable Counsel, touching tale talers and sedicious runnagates.
THe kings most excellent Majesty has certain knowledge given as well to his
own majesty, as to his most dear Uncle Edward duke of Somerset, governor of
his person, and Protector of all his Realms, dominions and subjects, and to
the rest of his highness counsel, that in diverse his Majesty's Counties of this
his Realm, there be dispersed and severed abroad, sundry light, lewed, idle,
sedicious, busy, and disordred persons, whereof the most part have neither
place to inhabit in, neither seeks any stay to live by, but having been
either condemned of felonies and prison breakers, run from the wars, and
sea rouers, departed from the kings Guarrisons and loyterers, whereby they
become desperate persons, and now enploy and labor themselfes, runnyng and
postyng from place to place, county to county, town to town, by day to day,
to stir up rumors, raise up tales, imagyn news, whereby they seek to stir,
gather together and assemble, the kings true subjects of simplicity and
ignorance deceived, and by that pretense, such lewed ruffyans, tale tellers,
and unruly vacabondes, become ryngleders and masters of the kings people,
sekyng to spoil, rob, and rauin, where and whom they list or may, and so to
live, wax rich, and feed of other men's labors, money and fode, they
themselves another willing to serve where they might, neither abidyng when they
be well entertained: And being thus in several places of this his realm, at ye
last not hable long to continue together with their assembles, according to
their mischiuous purposes, the same assembles being in substance, of such the
kings poor subjects, as though by ignorance and enticeme^tes of those
foresaid tale tellers they offend, yet shortly by the goodness of God
acknowledge their faults, and return themselfes to their duties, most
sorowfully repent, receiuyng for the same, the kings Majesty's great mercy by
his pardon, and by the reason of the quiet order, the falling, cessyng and
appealyng of such assembles, the said runnagates, tale tellers, and sedicious
persons, fail and lack their purposes and mischeuous intentes, so that they
accustomyng their evil nature and escapyng from the places of their first
attemptes, have and do daily resort to new places, and so from place to place,
Shere to Shere, never quietyng themself, but deuisyng slanderous tales, and
diuulgyng to the people such kind of news, as they think may most readely
move them to vprores and tumultes, and for the further deceit also, pretend to
them they seek to redress the commen wealth: Therefore his Majesty by thaduise
of his said dear uncle the lord Protector and the rest of his Majesty's
preuie counsel, to the aduoidyng of the great inconveniences. which of the
sufferaunce hereof daily does ensue, and to admonish his good subjects,
which hitherto have not felt the peril of these poisoned evil people, most
straightly charge and commands all manner and every his Justices, Shiriffes,
Constables, Bayliffes, Hedboroughes and all other his Majesty's ministers and
