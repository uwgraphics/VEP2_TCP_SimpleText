A Proclamation for the further adiourning of Michaelmas Term.
WHereas the Kings most Excellent MAJESTY, out of His Princely care of the
health and safety of His Subjects, and to prevent the danger that might arise
to them by their resort to London or Westminster, about the occasions of the
Term, in times of Infection of the plague there, did therefore by His
Proclamation dated the sixth day of September last, signify His pleasure, that
part of the Term of Saint Michael then next coming, should be adiourned in
and from the Vtas thereof, unto the fourth Return of the same Term called
Mense Michaelis next: Now His Majesty finding that the sickness does still
continue and increase in those Cities and parts adjoining, and foreseeing that
the danger thereof would be very great to His whole Kingdom, in dispersing the
Infection, and would longer continue the peril thereof in those places already
infected, by the concourse of so many from all parts of the Realm, whom the
businesses of the Term must necessarily draw together, does therefore hereby
declare His Royal pleasure to be, That at the said Return called Mense, the
said Term be again adiourned until Quindena Martini, being the last Return
of the same, and that to be for such causes only, and for such intents and
purposes, as hereafter is expressed; And the same adiournement to be made from
the last day of the said Return of Mense Michaelis, called the day of
appearance. And His Majesty to avoid the damage that may happen to His
Subjects in their causes and suits, if the Term should be wholly adiourned;
Has by advice of his Council determined to have some part thereof to be
holden and continued, that is to say, for and during the several Returns of
Octabis Michaelis, Mense Michaelis, and Quindena Martini only, and for none
other days or time whatsoever: And to that end His Majesty's will and
Commandment is, that Writs of Adiournement shall be awarded by the Lord Keeper
of the great Seal of England, directed to the Justices of either Bench, and to
the Judges of all other His Majesty's Courts, to whom like Writs have been
usually directed, Giving them power to adiourne the said Term again, from
Mense Michaelis next, unto Quindena Martini, as aforesaid: wherein
nevertheless His Majesty's intention is, that the same days may be held by
one of the Judges of each Court, only for the better expediting and continuing
of Causes and Suits, and returning and suing out of Process, and for such other
like things, as may be performed and done, in the absence of the parties by
their Attourneys.

And therefore His Majesty does hereby declare His pleasure to be, that in the
said several Returns of Octabis Michaelis, Mense Michaelis, and Quindena
Martini next coming, there shall be no trialls by Iuries, or any Judgments
upon Demurrers, or special Verdicts, or such like, in any of His Courts of
Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer: And also that there shall be no
Judicial hearing or determining of any causes or matters in any of His Courts
of Star Chamber, Chancery, Exchequer-Chamber, Court of Wards, Dutchy-Chamber,
or Court of Requests, during the said Returns of Octabis Michaelis, Mense
Michaelis, and Quindena Martini, respectively as aforesaid; And that no party
shall need to be present in person for any such Causes or Suits, but the same
may be attended and done by their Attourneys. And His Majesty does hereby
further notify and declare, that no party shall be compelled, or need to
appear in person in any of His Majesty's said Courts, at any time during the
said Term, but may make their appearance by their Attourneies, saving only in
Cases of Outlawry, and other the Cases mentioned in the Prouiso hereafter
following: And also that no Iuries, or any whom the same may concern, shall be
compelled, or need to appear in any of His Highness Courts at Westminster at
any time during the said Term, for any Cause or matter whatsoever, unless it
be for some special and important Cause, for His Majesty's service only.
Provided nevertheless, and His Majesty's pleasure and Commandment is, That all
Collectours, Sheriffs, and other Accomptants, and all other persons that
should or ought to account, or pay any sum or sums of money in any of His
Majesty's Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, or of His Duchy of
Lancaster, or in any of them, or enter into any account in any of the said
Courts, shall repair to the accustomed places at Westminster, and there to
pay, and do in every behalf, as though no such Proclamations or Adiournments
had been had or made.

And His Majesty's further pleasure and Commandment is, that all Sheriffs
shall return into His Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Court of Wards and
Liueries, and Duchy of Lancaster, all manner of Writs and Process issued out of
the same Courts, and returnable in Michaelmas Term, which in any sort concern
His Majesty's Revenues, Debts, or Duties, at, or before the days of Returns
thereof, into such Offices from whence the said Writs and Process did issue: And
that all Commissioners likewise return all manner of Commissions and
Inquisitions returnable the same Michaelmas Term, and from the said Court
sent, whereby His Majesty is to receive profit and commodity: And all
Sheriffs, Collectours, and all manner of Accomptants, and every person that is
to pay any kind of Debt or Duty unto the Kings Majesty in any of the said
Courts; do either by themselves, their Deputies or Attourneys, pay the same,
in such sort as they ought to have done, if no such Proclamations or
Adiournements had been made; or else to sustain such damage of Issues,
Seizure, Fine, Amerciament and Penalty be imposed upon them, as has been
accustomed, without any hope to be discharged thereof: And that all Sheriffs,
by themselves, or their sufficient Deputies, shall give their attendance at the
days appointed for their opposall in the Court of Exchequer, to answer their
Returns before His said Barons, as has been heretofore accustomed: And if
any default shall be made by any of the persons aforesaid, that then (in
respect of the Kings necessary and extraordinary charges) Sergeants at Arms,
and Pursueuants shall be sent to bring them up, to answer their Contempt and
slacknes in payment.

And for such of His Majesty's Subjects, as have Cause to attend the Master and
Council of His Court of Wards and Liueries, to make their Compositions for
Wardships, and suing out of Liueries, and other the businesses of that Court;
His Majesty's pleasure is, that all such persons shall give their attendance on
the Master and Council of the said Court at Acton, in the County of Middlesex,
on Monday, being the fourteenth day of November next; And so from time to time
as that Court shall direct for dispatch of the business of the same Court.

And His Majesty does especially charge and require, as well the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen of the City of London, as the Justices of Peace, and all other
Officers and Ministers within Westminster, Middlesex, Surrey and Kent, to take
especial care, that as well the Orders lately published by His Majesty's
direction, as such others as shall be found necessary for preventing the
spreading of the Infection, be from time to time strictly put in execution;
And also, that all other the Justices of Peace in all other Counties, Majors,
Bailiffes, and chief Officers of Cities and Towns Corporate, and other places
within their several Jurisdictions, be careful to do the like, as there shall
be occasion; As they tender His Majesty's Royal pleasure, and the common
safety of His Kingdom and People in these times of danger.

Given at Our Castle of Winsore, the second day of October, in the twelfth
year of Our Reign. 1636.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1636.
