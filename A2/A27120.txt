The blood of righteous ABEL, Crying from the ground, being a lamentation for,
and a warning too, all that have a hand against the innocent people of God,
especially intended for the Rulers and Priests in Hamshire, who have hardened
their hearts against the day of slaughter, wherein they shall feel Cains
punishment which he was not able to bear, who have been often warned by the
servants of the Lord, yet have they not done that which is just in his sight,
but have imprisoned several of his servants this many months, without just
cause, and does increase their bondage upon us, where 9 of us are kept close
prisoners, in an unwholesome stinking hoale, not fit for beasts, whose cry is
not only gone through the Nation, but is also entered into the ears of the Lord
God of rest, who will plead our cause in righteousness.

Also the decree of the Lord sealed and made manifest to his servant, that all
the plottings, snares and persecutions, which the powers of the earth and
darkness, and the gates of hell, can invent and rise up with, shall never
prevail against his power that is now brake forth and made manifest, in his
dear children, who in scorn are called Quakers.

By W. B.

MY heart within me is broken because of the false Prophets and persecuting
rulers, who are found fighting against the Lamb of God and his followers. Alas,
alas! woe is me because of the misery that is coming upon you, my heart is
filled with sorrow, and mine eyes with tears, and my bowels are turned within
me, to consider the day of your desolation and destruction, which is coming
upon you, from the Almighty God of heaven and earth: Oh what shall be done for
you, ye hard hearted and rebellious children, who shall entreat for you, or take
pity on you in the day of your calamity, which is coming as a whirlwind of
terrors, and you shall not escape, and woe be to him that strive with his
maker: do you think to stop or limit the mighty power of the Creator of heaven
and earth, which is now broke forth and made manifest in his dear children,
(who have waited for him in the way of his judgments) by your blood thirsty
persecution; and by your false accusations and wicked consultations and
unrighteous decrees and laws, nay you shall never prevail nor prosper in these
your intents, your vain hopes will perish, and your contrivances will be swept
with you into the bottomless pit, from whence your counsel is, and no weapon
that is formed against us, (who love not our lives for the son of Gods sake
unto the death) shall ever prosper, and woe to the rebellious children that
take counsel but not of me, and that cover with a covering, but not of my
spirit says the Lord.

Is your councels, plottings and persecution to hinder the powerful work of the
Lord, which he has begun among the children of men, and has blessed and will
bless, and to frey people from embraceing the precious truth (which is the
everlasting foundation of God) without which all men will be found miserable in
their latter end, is this your end, and to keep up your earthly honor, deceit
and flattering titles, and vain glory, which will wither and be laid in the
dust, and to satisfy the pride of life, which is not of the father but of the
world: Is this your end, for fear of loseing these things that puffs up the
fleshly mind out of Gods fear, and that wars against your souls, for which you
persecute, imprison, and draw before the judgment seats, and make a prey and a
spoil of a harmless and innocent people, whose glory and kingdom, and peace is
not of the world, but follows the lamb that was slain whither soever he goes;
if this be your end, (and to keep off the trouble and torment that is coming
upon you, by reason of your wickedness and rebellion against the Lord) you will
miss of it, and your expectation will perish, and do you think to avenge your
selves on his dear children, and get ease by aflicting them, and grieving them,
and tormenting them with your plottings and snares of inhumane cruelty, is this
your way? is the time that was spoken of, come to be fulfilled upon you? that
whosever kills us (who are the followers of Christ) shall think he does God
service, and will not their vain thoughts deceive them, who are found in the
envy against the meek spirit, that is come to judge the world, and do not they
rise up against the Lord of life; who rise up against him that is meek and
lowly: surely this is a wrong way you have entered into, the way of the ungodly
which will perish, and not the way to peace, for in these things you heap up
wrath to your selves against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgments of God, in this way you shall never prosper nor prevail, the Lord
God has spoken it.

For this is the way of the wicked, which is as darkness (where the stumbling
is) and leads into the chambers of death and destruction, this is the sword of
the wicked which you have drawn, it shall enter into your own bowels, and if
you thirst for our blood, you may have it to drink, for a body is prepared, and
we fear not him that is able only to kill it, but the Lord our God alone, he
is our fear, and he is our dread, and our refuge in time of trouble, who is
taking vengeance on you unawares, in a way you know not, nor will you believe
though a man declare it unto you, for did you believe it, and were the eye open
to see these things, you would fear and dread and tremble at the presence of
the pure powerful God, whose swift witness is coming upon you as a thief in the
night, and will wound your hairy scalp, who proceed in your wickedness, and
will smite the head of his enemies, and strike through Kings in the day of his
wrath, whose fury you cannot escape; and all your high mountains by him will be
overturned, who think to rule and reign over the meek of the earth, by your
hight of pride and cruelty: alas for you! ye tall Cedars, a fierce wind from
the Lord God shall shake you, the axe is laid to your root, and you will be
hewn down for the fire, ye raging waves of the sea, you some out your own
shame, and cast up mire and dirt, our King (that rides meekly) is on the top of
you all, and on your head does he trample, and he will calm this storm to his
own praise and glory, and to your utter confusion who rebel against him.

Christ Jesus the light of the world, the man of sorrows, who seek not honor
from men, whom you despise, against whom you are risen up and have turned your
sword, he is our King, here this ye rebels, ye traitors, the Lord God will
stain the pride of your glory, and lay your earthly honor in the dust, and
bring you into contempt, who are seeking honor and glory to your selves in the
earth, whose peace is your life, who love the praise of men, and pleasures more
then God: a sword is coming upon you all, and you are for the slaughter of the
great King who is our lawgiver, and Savior, and our peace, who is come a light
into the world, and is the true light that lighteneth every man that comes
into the world, meek and lowely upon the wild asses coalt, hear this ye deaf,
and see ye blind, and be still and hearken, ye floods of ungodly men who
compass the Saints about and the beloved city, with lies and plottings of
falsehood, whereby you think to weary out the dear children of the most high:
fire is coming down from God out of heaven to devour you, and you shall not be
able to quench it, ye are the pricking briars to the house of Israel, ye are
the thorns, the dross, and the stubble, the Lord God Almighty of power, will
you consume the decree is sealed against you, a witness I am for the eternal
God of life against you all, in all your deeds of darkness, and hard speeches;
my outward life is not deer unto me, ye devouring beasts of the field, I have
given it up, and you may take it, for he that departs from iniquity is become
your prey.

But the Lord God will plead our cause in righteousness, and his eternal
witness (the light in your consciences) will answer your condemnation to be
just, and your destruction to be of your selves; for you have been warned from
time to time, by the servants of the Lord without you, and reproved by the
light, his true prophet within you, that you might escape and flee from the
wrath to come, which if you proceed in the harness of your hearts, in
afflicting his dear children, it will over take you: and because of these
things, my soul is moved, knowing the terrors of the Lord against you, and a
doleful lamentation is on me, and my very bones are pained, and my heart is hot
within me, the whole earth is moved with the fierce indignation of the Lord,
his vengeance plagues, and eternal judgments (without mercy) do I proclaim
against you all, from the mouth of the Lord God of hosts, except you speedily
repent; for you have greived his spirit, and you have afflicted his dear
children these many months, yet have you been entreated by them with many
tears, and often warned, and the Lord have we even entreated for you, as
Abraham did for Sodom, and Moses for Pharaoh, that you might not wholly be
condemned, with an utter overthrow, but rather that you might repent and live;
but our righteous souls are vexed and grieved with your pride, rebellion, and
filthy conversation from day to day, and no answer from the Lord have we
concerning you, but the red sea of his wrath wherein you will be utterly
swallowed and drowned, and not one will be left, and fire from heaven as snares
upon you, will be rained, for every tree that brings not forth good fruit,
shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, and every plant which my heavenly
father has not planted shall be rooted up. Consider this ye that forget God,
ye that forget mercy, whose bowels are shut up, whose hearts are hardened, from
his righteous dreadful fear, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to
deliver you, for our God is a consuming fire, and is terrible to the heathen
that know him not, whose fire is in Sion, and his furnace in Jerusalem, and
from thence our deliverer comes, who turns away ungodliness from Jacob.

But is not envy, persecution, and oppression, ungodliness, and wrath, pride,
and injustice, are not these things ungodliness and unrighteousness? consider
and weigh it in the even balance the light in your consciences, to which I
speak, which will answer the truth without covering, and is my witness in you
all, for the Lord God, and hears my voice, therefore stop not the ear, lest
you are shut out for ever; then shall you cry but he will not hear you: and is
not the wrath of God to be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, or is envy, pride, cruelty, oppression, tyranny, and
persecution, and laying snares for the innocent and harmeless without cause, is
this good fruit, or the fruit of the spirit of God, (who among the saints in
these things is your example,) or does the heavenly plant bring forth such
fruit, nay verily will Gods witness answer me, and are any the sons and
children of God, but who are joined to the heavenly plant, or led by his
spirit, which guides unto all truth, (out of unrighteousness) into soberness,
quietness, love, peace, patience, long-suffering, humility, and gentleness,
etc. and are not the children of God in these things manifest? and are not the
children of the devil, (in the other ground bringing forth other fruit of the
curse) also manifest? But if you will not hear, nor lay these things to heart,
and give over afflicting, oppressing, and grieving my dear children, and tender
babes that cry unto me night and day, and give glory to my great and dreaful
name, by returning from the evil that is in your hands, I will destroy you and
your seed from off the face of the whole earth, and blot out your name from
under heaven, and your remembrance shall stinck (and be a grief) to my chosen,
yet shall they rejoice over you, when the smoke of your torment shall ascend up
for ever and ever, says the Lord God Almighty,

For thus says the Lord God, these people whom you hate (and seek many ways
to ensnare and take counsel together against, and abuse and persecute, and
imprison, whip, stone, revile and reproach by the name QUAKERS, who abide
faithful to my son the light of the world, that lights every man that comes
into the world; they are dear unto me, my chosen, my dear children, my beloved
ones, and he that touches them, touches the apple of mine eye, whose cry is
entered into my ears, and my pity is toward them, and my bowels are moved for
them, for whose sake I will reprove Kings, and kingdoms shall be overthrown
that rise up against them, and every tongue that rise up in judgment against
them, will I condemn, for I the Lord search the heart, and try the reins, and
will reward every man according to his deeds.

Therefore consider these things, ye proud and scornful men, who are of the
birth born after the flesh, persecuting the birth of the spirit, being moved
with envy and wrath (which is of the Devil) against an innocent people, whom
the Lord God will preserve and does, though out of your sight, whom the God of
this world has blinded, and all you false teachers, deceitful workers, who use
your tongues both to pray and also to lie, flander, and revile; whose hearts
are exercised in covetous practices, and yet sometime (for a cloak) will speak
against it, as if one fountain can yield salt water and fresh, but your skirts
are discovered upon your face, and you shall be made manifest to them that yet
see you not, and shall be a by word to nations, ye proud profane hirelings, ye
treacherous priests of England, from you profaneness is gone forth into all the
land, who by your lies and by your lightness has caused many to err, the Lord
God will root you out without hand, and the very savor of your root shall
become loathsome to the earth, (which is weary to bare you) and your foundation
shall be utterly swept away, and no place for it shall be found, for you have
been founded upon (and upheld by) the beastly nature and seed of enmity, within
and without, of which now the Lord God of endless strength, is making an utter
end, and none shall be able to deliver out of his hand, therefore is a cry
heard among you, to the hills and to the mountains of the earth, to hide and
cover you from the wrath of the lamb, against whom you make war, (who is the
light of the world and your condemnation whose deeds are evil) but the
mountains shall be overturned with the fierce indignation of the Lord, and cast
into the sea of confusion and torment with you, who strive to hide you from the
day that makes manifest, and from the stroke of his righteous judgments, and
the fury of the Lord God Almighty will sweep the land of evil doers, and no
place shall be found for the worker of iniquity, but shame and confusion of
faces shall come upon you, and you shall gnaw your tongues for pain, and shall
curse your God and your King, for a dreadful and bitter day is fastening upon
you all, who are in the enmity against the meek spirit (in Cains nature)
vagabond from God in the earth where your names are written, and not in the
Lambs book of life that was slain from the foundation of the world, (the
foundation of transgression) when envy, and pride, and vain glory had a (...)
spirit was slain by it, hear this ye that have an ear to hear, for he shall
reign and get the victory, that was dead and is alive for evermore, and has
the key of David, and shall overcome and have the dominion, and rule and
authority over all the kingdoms of men: o ye foolish and without
understanding, I have ye not read, that the lamb that was slain is worthy to
receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and blessing, and that
he shall prevail though ten Kings make war with him; consider this ye that
strive with your maker, by whom you will be broken in pieces like a potters
vessel, and was it not the Dragon (which is cast out of heaven) that makes war
with the lamb, and was it not the Devil which had great wrath, when he saw he
had but a short time, and was it not the great red Dragon, the old serpent,
that made war with the woman, and the remnant of her seed, who kept the
Commandments of God, and had the testimony of Jesus, these are them, the
devil, the serpent, and his seed makes war against, against them that keep the
commands of God, and have the testimony of Jesus, who says believe in the
light, and how can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and says
swear not at all, and they shall hale you out of their Sinagogues and bring you
before rulers and governors for my namesake, and this shall turn to you for a
testimony, (mark) for his sake that says, swear not at all for his namesake,
that respects not the person of any man, for his namesake that says, how can
ye believe, that receive honor one of another, for his namesake that testify
against the works of the world that are evil, haled out of the Synagogues,
brought before rulers, persecuted and despitefully used for his sake, for
keeping his commandments, and bearing his testimony against whom the serpent
and his seed makes war, here is the testimony, but the woman that brings forth
the man child, (against whom the dragon cast out his floods of reproach and
persecution) (...) hid from the face of the serpent, glory to the Lord for ever.

And is not the lamb, the light of the holy city, where the dogs that bite and
the unclean devouring beasts shall not enter, but are shut out, and all liars,
and unbelieving, who believe not in the light of the world, in the lamb of God
that takes away the sin, whose Kingdom and glory is hid from the wise and
prudent of the world, whose face to them is marred, and his form more then the
sons of men, who know not the bride the lambs wife, for the glory of the kings
daughter is within, and not of the visible world, therefore the world knows
her not, and the Princes of this world never knew the Lord of glory, who
lights every man that comes into the world: hearken ye bitter spirits, ye
hasty, rash, and high minded men, whose wrath and pride blinds your
understandings that you cannot perceive the invisible and eternal things of
God, but are tossed in the sea of confusion, and darkness and cannot rest;
consider these things, are not we whom you hate and persecure, and make a great
stir and noise about, as a city set on a hill which cannot be hid, and unknown
to you, yea verily we are, and are not we whom you grievously afflict without
cause, as the light of the world, and the salt of the earth now, and can you
endure the savor of them that fear the living God, and worship him in the
spirit and in the truth amongst you, are you not like the horse that smells the
battle afar off, and rages when he hears the sound of a trumpet: but the
trumpet of the Lord God is sounded out of Sion, and you shall tremble, and your
whole foundation shall be shaken, the Lord has spoken it.

Come let us try you, ye that cry peace, and cry for peace, can you endure to
be tried by the light of the son of God, who seek not honor from men, but is
meek and without guile, and says swear not at all, and says, I came not to
send peace on earth but a sword; come how do you feel his life and words, that
respects not the person of any man, and denies the glory of the world, and
testifies against the evil thereof without respect of persons, whether in
rulers, priests or people, and says how can you believe that receive honor
one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only, are his
words peace to your life, and do you savor them well as a joy to you, or are
they as a sword in your bowels, and cuts you to the heart as Stephens did, when
he spoke to the Council Scribes, Priests and Elders, and people who gnashed on
him with their teeth, and stoned him for the testimony of Jesus, come try your
peace whether it be in the earth, upon which the sword is to come, or whether
he is your peace that brings the sword upon the earth, who seeks not honor
from men, who is the condemnation of them whose deeds are evil. And see if you
can endure the salting with fire, and the day of trial and the hour of
temptation that will come upon all them that dwell on the earth to try them,
and do you not dwell on the earth, who are seeking earthly honor and
imprisoning for it, and will not the sword of Gods righteous judgments come
upon you for these things, see how you exceed your father, who did but tempt,
and not imprison the son of God, when he would not bow down nor worship him,
think on this and tremble, ye seed of evil doers, and consider your ways and
the whole course of your life, and the end thereof, and see if you can dvvell
with devouring fire, and with the everlasting burnings, for a fire the Lord
God of our life is kindling among you, and the thickets of the forest and the
ravenous beasts, and the false Prophets shall be consumed by it, and the day is
at hand, that a sword shall be upon your right arm, and it shall be dried up,
and your right eye shall be utterly darkened, and you shall look for light but
behold darkness, and dimness and blindness, and anguish and vexation of spirit,
with bitter lamentation, and for a comforter, but there will be none because
you have despised reproof, and did not choose the fear of the Lord, but have
said in your hearts there is no God, and what Lord shall control us, therefore
Gods righteous witness (the light in your consciences, which makes manifest the
hidden things of dishonesty) will judge and condemn you for all your ungodly
deeds and hard speeches, that you ungodly have committed, and spoken against
him and his dear children, and that is nigh you wh ch will tell the matter, and
he that sees in secret will reward you openly, according to the works of your
hands, and will let you see all that ever you have acted, in whose living
power and life I now vvarn you to consider your ways, and repent while you
have yet time, and prise this your visitation, lest it stand a dreadful
vvitness for the Lord God against you, and the thing that belong to your
eternal peace, be for ever hid from your eyes, and your house left unto you
desolate.

This is a warning from the spirit of the living God in his servant, who
suffers (in the spirit of meekness) for his precious truths sake who desires
not the death of a sinner, but rather that he might turn from his wickedness
and live, and am in the house of correction at Winchester, where I have freely
given up my life in the will of God, if it be to the finishing my testimony
against a sinful and adulterous generatition; to which prison I was sent as a
wanderer from the town in which I was born, (and which is in the same county)
and have been kept near 12. months because I cannot promise to go home, against
whom no evil or breach of law has been charged, though too Assizes and four
Sessions have past in the time of my imprisonment, who am of the world called,

William Bayley.

A voice and visitation of God to the Inhabitants of the Isle of Wight.
THe Lord God Almighty of heaven and earth (who is the God of Abraham, of
Isaac, and of Jacob) is risen with his eternal dreadful power, to gather and to
scatter, and no people powers or nations shall be able to stop his way, for he
in whose presence all the nations of the earth, are but as a drop of a bucket,
is risen as a Giant to the battlel, and he who makes war in righteousness is
gone forth conquering and to conquer, out of whose mouth goes a sharp two
edged sword, with which he will slay the wicked, and cut the heathen, that rage
asunder, for the Lord God of life and terrible Majesty, is now risen to judge
for the meek of the earth, and to plead the cause of the poor, against him that
is too strong for him, and is now making inquisition for blood, and he
remembers the cry of the humble, for the year of his redeemed is come, and the
day of vengeance is in his heart, he proclaims liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound, who hears the groanings
of his precious seed, and for its sake is come down to deliver.

Therefore woe, thick darkness and dreadful plagues will come upon Pharaoh and
all his host, who oppresses the righteous seed (the born of God) in the land
of your darkness and house of bondage; for the Prophet of the Lord God like
unto Moses (who sets before man good and evil, life and death, the blessing
and the curse) which God has raised up in the midst of his brethren which
all are to hear, he is now trying Pharaoh, or the sons and daughters of men
who are hardened, from his fear, who loves the darkness rather then the light
because their deeds are evil, and refuses to let that go which groaneth, and
does sigh and cry for deliverance, and hungers and thirsts after righteousness,
which being desolate and trodden under foot in many, it mourns unto him, and
the cry of it is entered into the ears of the Lord God of rest, and this is the
seed which the Lord is gathering into his gardner, of eternal dominion and
peace, and all the chafe which about it oppresses (though in a profession
without the life and power of the seed) will the Lord God consume with the
unquench able fire.

Therefore take heed, and be you warned of the Lord God of heaven, all ye
rulers, governers and people of the earth, and all you of this isle, and whom
the Lord God Almighty has moved many of his dear servants in the dreadful pure
power of his might, and in the bowels of love to visit your souls: I say take
heed of striving to hinder this the great mighty and powerful work of Gods love
amongst the Children of men, as you will answer it before the throne of God and
of the Lamb, who is the light of the world, and lights every man that comes
into the world, to whom all judgment and power is committed, who is now come
to judge the world in righteousness and the people with his truth, and he must
reign till all his enemies are brought under his feet, the Lord God of
everlasting strength has spoken it: for he is now coming in ten thousands of
his saints to convince all that are ungodly among you of their ungodly deeds,
which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which
ungodly sinners have spoken against him, who is the true light, that lights
every man that comes into the world, who upon them will execute the judgment
written, for now is the Lord of life fulfilling his promise, which he has
spoken by his former Prophets, that in the last days the mountain of the Lords
house shall be established upon the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted
above the hills, and many people shall flow unto it, and shall go and say,
come ye and let us go up unto the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God
of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths, and
let us walk in the light of the Lord; so that the head stone (the mountain of
the Lords house (which the wise master builders have rejected and refused, (who
is the light of the world the eternal wisdom and power of God) is he
establishing upon the top of all your dark mountains, of pride, envy and
ambition, and exalting above your lofty hills of oppression and rage, and his
day (who is the light) shall be upon every one that is proud, and upon every
one that is high and lifted up, and he shall be brought low, and the Lord God
alone shall be exalted on that day; for the decree is gone forth, and the
consuming fire is kindled among the thickets of the forest, and his eternal
love is streaming forth toward the meek in the earth, and against this his
mighty and powerful work, the gates of hell, and all the ru lars of the
darkness of this world, shall never prevail, the eternal Lord God of heaven and
earth has spoken it, Therefore in vain do all the potsheards of the earth
strive with their maker, and they that resists, resists not man, but God,
(who is the higher power that lights every man that comes into the world)
and such receives to themselves damnation, for to him we are subject who rides
meekly upon the foal of an ass, the wild asses colt, (he that reads let him
understand) and he is our peace, in whose mouth is found no guile, therefore
let none be high minded but fear; for thou o man (who art lifted up above the
Stem of Jesse, and the offspring of David,) bear not the root but the root
thee, therefore thou art to fear and dread the presence of the living God, and
depart from evil, and this is the beginning of the eternal wisdom (which is
justified of her children) which is from above, pure, peaceable meek, gentle
sober, and easy to be entreated, whose voice is to you (in the power of its
love) ye people of this Island, and this will lead you if you embrace it, into
its own paths which is eternal peace, and this leads out of rashness,
crookedness and perverseness, and out of headiness and high mindedness, and out
of all the lusts and pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, and this
brings to be just merciful and tender hearted, and to speak truth every man to
his neighbor, and this will lead to entertain strangers, when by it you come
to see your selves have been strangers to the life of God, (which is holy just
and righteous and full of good (...) and this will let you soldiers see that
you ought not to do violence, or accuse any man falsely, and that you ought to
live soberly and righteously in this present world: for all men shall know that
the Captain of our salvation (which was made perfect through sufferings, who
is the true light that is gone forth conquering and to conquer with his
eternal arm of power) that he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and must
reign over the world, and all its enmity and haughty powers of darkness,
(which is but as a vapor) for by him the world was made, and he is the heir
that is now come to take peace from the earth, and to call and gather into his
Vineyard of eternal life, and those that are vvilling and obedient shall eat
the good of the land, but those that refuse and rebel shall be devoured with
his svvord, the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

This of the Lord of life was I moved in this Island to speak forth as a
visitation and warning from him, unto you the inhabitants thereof, both
governernours, soldiers, priests and people, on the 8th. of the 11th. month,
58. By me who am a servant of the living God of Abraham, called Will. Bailey.
