THE BLACK BOX OF ROME OR, A True and short Discourse, showing the blasphemous
Treacheries and Conjurations of the wicked Jesuits, when they intend and
encourage any of their impious Disciples to murder a King, and overthrow a
Kingdom.



Printed in the Year, 1641.

THE JESUITS BLASPHEMOVS CONIVRATIONS TO ENCOVrage their Proselytes to
King-killing-treacheries.
SUch is the most bloody, and most blasphemous impudency of these Romish
Incendiaries, that when they put on a divellish and desperate resolution, to
murder any Emperor, King, or Prince whom they have once pronounced to be an
Heretic, and excommunicate person; and thereupon intend to murder him by
some Raviliack, whom they make choice of for the execution of the said Treason;
that after such an unfortunate and wretched person, is once allured, and entered
into their place of consultation, or chamber of (Philonicall) prayers, (for
sooth) as they call them: These infernal firebrands kneel all down, who in
their prayers observe their time; and put before the intended Traitor, a knife
folded up in a scarf; shut up in a little Box, covered with an Agnus Dei;
written about with black letters of perfumes, odorifirous Characters: and when
they draw it out themselves, they cast or sprinckle some drops of holy water
upon it, and which done, they hang at the hafte of the said knife, five or six
grains of Corrall, which are blessed by them, who blaspheamously they give him
to understand, and make him believe that so many blows, as shall be given by
him with the said knife; so many souls shall be released out of Purgatory.

Afterward, putting the knife into the intended Murderers hand, they
pronounce these words saying:

Go now like Iephte, with the Sword of Sampson in thy hand, the Sword with
which David did cut off Golia's head, the Sword of Gedion; yea, the Sword with
which Judith did cut off Holophernes head, the sword of the valiant Machabees,
and the same with which Saint Peter did cut off Malcas his ear, yea I say, the
sword of Pope Julius the second, with the which (breaking the forces of
oppugning Princes) he took out of their hands with great effusion of blood,
the Cities of Sezza, Imola, Fayance, Bologna, and many other Cities: go thus
I say, thou magnanimous Champion of the chair of Rome, and be valiant, and God
strengthen thine arm for the great work now intended by thee. After which,
this infernal kennell of Romish bloodhounds kneel all down, and the most
wretchedly renowned and cursedly quallified amongst them, with a cauterized
conscience and immarbled heart, pronounces the bloody Conjuration, impiously
and impudently saying as follows.

Come Cherabims, come Seraphinns, and highest Thrones that rule, come blessed
Angels: yea, blessed Angels of charity, come and fill this holy Vessel with
glory and eternity, and bring him presently the Crown of the Virgin Mary, of
the Patriarchs, and of the Martirs, for he belongs no longer to us, but to
you.

And thou Oh dreadful and terrible God, who have revealed to him in these our
Prayers and meditations; that he ought to murder a Tyrant, and confound a
Heretic, and to give the Crown to a Catholike-King. And being by us disposed
to this meritorious Murder, vouchsafe to fortify his senses, and increase his
forces: to the end that he may accomplish this thy great will; and vouchsafe to
arm and furnish him with the Harness of thy powerful providence, that he may
valiantly perform the worthy work he has piously undertaken, and may happily
escape from those, who would apprehend him: give him Eagles wings, that the
spite and malice of those Barbarians whom he goes against, may not once touch
his sanctified members. Extend also the beams of thy joy and celestial
felicity upon his sacred soul, to the end that by the blessed influence
thereof, the parts and members of his body also; may be encouraged and enabled
to this great work, and that it may chearefully dispose it self to this holy
Combat without fear or shrinking pusillanimity.

This accursed Conjuration being thus audaciously and gracelessely uttered,
they carry the thus enchanted bloody Regicide, and set him before an Altar,
where they show him a Picture wherein the angels are seen and shown to have
lifted up and elevated long since James Clement, a bloody Iacobine Friar, and
represented him (as it were) before the Throne of God, saying:

Lord behold thy Pupil, behold thy well-instructed Champion, and the
accomplisher of thy justice: Whereupon all the Saints rise out of their seats
to make him room, and give him place among them. And when all these things are
thus done and finished, there are no more but four Jesuits only left with
him, who when they come near him; they with diabolical impudency and lying
flattery, say unto him: that they seem to perceive that there is some Diety
infused into him, and that they are so astonished with the radiant
light-shining and glistering in him, that they hold it their honor to kiss
his hands and feet, and make him madly to believe that they account him not a
mere man any longer; but that they esteem themselves (as it were) as they
say, half unworthy of the happiness and glory which he has already obtained
by his Catholic resolution, and sighting deeply before him: they say unto
him; we would that God had chosen us, and called us to your estate: since we
should be truly assured, that we should go really, and directly into Paradise
without coming at Purgatory. And thus having intoxicated and bewitched the
miserable wretch, they thus leave him to his intended bloody design.

The end of the Conjuration.
FINIS.
O Lord preserve our Noble King Charles, and all his posterity, from the power
of all such Romish regicides and bloody Traitors, who thus plot and practice to
build up their Romish Synagogue with blood. And grant good God, that our
gracious King Charles, may with his posterity, long continue a happy and
prosperous reign over this Kingdom, for the maintenance and propagation of
Christ's Gospel in despite of Antichrist, and all his bold and bloody
adherents: and let every good, and loyal subject and true hearted English
Christian say,

Amen, and Amen.
