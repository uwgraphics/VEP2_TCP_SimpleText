A Proclamation concerning New Buildings, in and about the City of London, and
against the dividing of houses into several dwellings, and receiving and
harboring of Inmates.
WHereas in the first year of Our Reign, as soon as the more important
affairs of Our State would give Us leave, taking into Our Princely
consideration the state of Our City of London, being Our Royal Chamber, and
the Imperial seat of Our Kingdoms, renowned over all the parts of
Christendom, both in respect of the usual residence of Our Royal Person and
Court near unto it, the confluence of Foreign Ambassadors and Strangers
thither, the ordinary place for Our Courts of Justice, and resort of our
Nobility and Gentry there for these occasions;

And foreseeing that the honor, government, health and safety of this City,
was of great consequence unto Us, and that Our Royal Progenitors in former
times (especially Our most Royal Father of blessed memory, King JAMES, and the
most Excellent Princess Queen ELIZABETH, in their times) by their Royal
Proclamations had carefully provided for the same, We, according to those
worthy examples, by Our Royal Proclamation did straightly provide against the
erecting of Houses and Buildings upon new Foundations, and the entertaining of
Inmates, in and about this City, which would multiple the Inhabitants to such
an excessive number, that they could neither be governed nor fedd; And did also
thereby give Rules for the Repairing and new Building of ancient houses
decayed, in such a comely manner, with Brick or Stone, as might be for the
honor and safety of the City; And for the putting of this Our Commandment
into due execution, We did make, and several times renew Our Commission
directed to the Lord Mayor of Our said City, and diverse other persons of
honor and worth, grounding the same upon rules of Law and Justice, as against
public and common Nusances, as well as upon reason of State and Government,
all tending to the public good of Our people: But that taking not so full
effect hitherto as We expected, We have now again resolved to renew that Our
Commission to diverse Honorable persons, and others of worth and understanding;
And therefore We do hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure and
Command, That Our said Commissioners for that service, shall forthwith as well
by taking a view in their own persons from time to time, as by all other good
ways and means, enquire and find out the offenders and offenses done against
the several Proclamations made heretofore by Our said Father, and by Our
Self, as against this present Proclamation, and the same being so found out,
to make certificate thereof under their hands, or under the hands of two, or
more of them, to Our Self, as against this present Proclamation, and the same
being so found out, to make certificate thereof under their hands, or under
the hands of two, or more them, to Our Counsel Board, or to bind them over to
answer their contempts, either before the Lords of Our Privy Council, or in
Our Court of Starchamber, to the end that such proceeding may be had against
them, as may stand with Our Honor and with Our Laws.

And for stay and prevention of the like offenses hereafter, Our express will
and pleasure is, That where any person shall presume after the publication of
this Proclamation, to erect, or set up in any kind whatsoever, any Building
upon new Foundation within the limits of three miles, from any of the Gates of
the City of London or Palace of Westminster; That the Owners of the Building
so begun, and all the workmen therein employed, shall forthwith by force and
virtue of Our Royal commandment (without expecting any other or further
Warrant) be attached, and brought before some of Our said Commssioners and
Justices of Peace, whom We also hereby require and command, to commit them to
Prison, until they shall find sufficient sureties for stay of their said
Building, as also for their appearance before the Lords of Our Privy Council,
or in Our high Court of Starchamber, to answer such their contempts, and to
undergo such Sentence, as by that Court shall be given against them.

And for such as shall hereafter Reedifie or build upon did Foundations in any
other sort then is prescribed in Our former Proclamations, and by the
Insructions herein expressed; That as well all such Builders, as the workmen
therein employed, shall be attached likewise and proceeded withal as
aforesaid.

And whereas by Our former Proclamation we charged and commanded the Aldermen
of the City of London, and their Deputies, in their several Wards and
Precincts, as likewise the Justices of Peace, High and Petie Constables, and
all other inferior Officers within their several limits and Jurisdictions,
happening within the several Counties of Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Surrey,
That they and every of them in their several places and Offices respectively,
should diligently and duly attend to give their uttermost aid, help, and
assistance according to their duties, for the due observance to see this Our
Royal pleasure (so much concerning the public good) to be duly executed
and performed; And where they or any of them should find any offense to be
committed against any Branch or Article of the said Proclamation, to make stay
thereof, and certify the Commissioners or the Lords of Our Privy Council of
the said offenses and offenders, it being now manifest, that many of the said
offenses have been committed and done by the negligence or conniuencie of some
of the Aldermens Deputies within the City of London, and other inferior
Officers in the Counties adjacent, in not attending Our Commandment by timely
staying the proceeding of such new buildings.

We therefore do hereby declare Our will and pleasure to be, That where any
Building shall be begun contrary to this Our Proclamation, We will take a
strict account thereof, as well from the said Aldermen, as the Justices of Peace
aforesaid, happening within their several limits and Jurisdictions.

And further Our will and pleasure is, That as well the Aldermens Deputies in
their several Precincts, as the High and Petie Constables, and Headboroughs,
and other inferior Officers in their several Parishes, and dwelling in or
near to the place where any such new Building shall happen to be begun,
contrary to the Tenor of this Our Proclamation; And they or some of them not
attaching the person or persons so offending, and not bringing them before some
of Our Commissioners as aforesaid, That every such Aldermans Deputy, high
Constable, petie Constable and Headborough, or other inferior Officers, shall
be not only removed from their several Places and Offices, but be committed
to the common Jail of the City of London, and Counties of Middlesex, Essex,
Kent, and Surry, respectively where such offense or offenses shall be
committed; and every of them to be bound with good sureties for his and their
good behavior for one whole year then after, to the end that by such their
punishment, others may learn the better to perform their duties in this Our
Service.

And to the end that such as do conform in their building to the order and
form prescribed by Us, may receive due encouragement by having their Materials
at reasonable Rates and Prices, which We are informed is much inhanced and
raised from the Prices formerly set by Our Commissioners: It is therefore Our
will and pleasure, That Our Commissioners for Buildings do call before them
all and every the Brickmakers, and Lime-burners within three miles distant of
London, as also such as do bring any of the said Materials by land or water to
the City of London, or the places near adjoining, and do take order from
time to time as well for the reducing of the Prices thereof to former, usual
and reasonable Rates, or otherwise according to their good discretions to be
by them set, as also for the present and speedy suppressing of all and every
the Nusances by them daily committed in their several professions of Brick
making and Lime-burning so near the City of London, and the parts and places
adjoining thereunto, and for the selling of those Materials at and for
reasonable Rates and Prices, according to the Articles hereafter following.

FIrst, We do strictly charge and command, That no dwelling Houses, Stables,
Shops, Stalles, or any other Building whatsoever, be from henceforth erected,
or attempted to be erected within the City of London, or the Suburbs thereof,
or within the distance of three miles to be taken from any Gate of the said
City, or from Our Palace at Westminster, except it be upon the Foundation of
a former dwelling house, or such like Building; And if any such Building
contrary to this Prohibition shall hereafter happen to be begun, that the
same be forthwith stayed from further proceeding, by the Alderman of the
Ward, or by two of the next Justices of Peace, and as well such Builder, as the
Workmen employed therein, committed to Prison, until they shall enter into
sufficient Bond, either to demolish, and pull down that which is built, or to
answer their contempt in our high Court of Starchamber, or before the Lords of
the Privy Council at the Council Board, And the Constable of the Parish or
Place, shall from time to time in the first beginning of any such Work or
building, give notice to the Alderman of the Ward, or two next Justices of
Peace, of any such offense, and of the offenders therein, that this
Proclamation may be speedily and freshly put in execution, All Houses,
Sheddes, Shoppes, and other Buildings, which have been builded or set up
within the limits aforesaid, at any time sithence the thirteenth year of the
Reign of Our said late Father King JAMES of blessed memory, contrary to any
Proclamation published in His time, shall be forthwith pulled down, as is
before directed touching other Buildings to be stayed or pulled down, and no
Cellars erected within the time last mentioned, to be used for Lodgings or
Victualling Houses, but the Occupiers thereof to be suppressed, and so to be
kept by the Justices of Peace.

THat no person or persons do Erect, Reedifie, or set up any House, or
Building in London, or within the distance of three miles from any the Gates of
the said City of London, or from Our said Palace at Westminster, unless he
do make all the vtter-Walles of the same of Brick, or Brick and Stone; And
that all Houses and Buildings to be erected within the said City, or in, or
adjoining to any open Street of any Town or Village out of the said City,
within the limits of three miles aforesaid, shall be built according to the
form and proportion hereafter in these presents expressed: (viz.) Every whole
Story of and in such Houses and Buildings, and all and every the Rooms of such
whole Story, shall be of the height of ten foot of Assize at the least, and
every half Story of and in such Houses and Buildings, shall be of the height
of seven foot and a half at the least; And that in the forefront, and all
outward and division Walls betwixt house and house, and the Iambes, Heads and
soyles of the Windows shall be of Brick, or of Brick and Stone, and the
Windows (being of Timber) not to be put in until the Iambes and Heads
aforesaid be finished, and bear of themselves.

ANd if the said buildings do not exceed two Stories in height, then the
Walls thereof shall be of the thickness of one Brick and half a Brickes
length according to the assize of Brickes hereunder mentioned, from the ground
unto the uppermost part of the said Walls; And where the building shall be of
the height of three Stories, the Walls of the first Story shall be of the
thickness of two Brickes length, and from thence unto the uppermost part of
the Wall of the thickness of one Brick and half a brickes length, and so
proportionably, if there shall be more Stories.

THat, in building of said Houses there shall be no Iusties or Iutting, or
Cantwindowes, either upon Timber Ioistes, or otherwise, but the walls to go
direct and straight upwards, and at the setting of, a water table to be made;
Also the lights of the windows of every whole Story to be of more height then
breadth, to the end the Rooms may receive air for health, and there may be
sufficient Peers of Brick, not less then half the breadth of the Windows
between them for strength; And likewise the Windows of every half Story to
be made square every way, or near thereabouts.

THat all Shops and Street doors be made with Pillasters of Stone or Brick,
to be in breadth fifteen inches at the least, and as thick as the wall of the
Story, and the heads of the Shop-windowes cut in wedges, with Arches over them
to sustain the wall above; And that none do raise their first floor to gain
height in their Cellars, so as they are thereby forced to make steps into the
street: Provided always, that for so much as concerns the building with
Brick or Stone, shall not extend to any Buildings upon London Bridge, which by
reason of the situation thereof cannot with conueniencie be so built.

ANd for the better encouragement of Our loving Subjects in their Buildings,
according to the direction of this Proclamation: We have thought fit to set
down these orders following concerning the true making and rating of the price
of Brick, which is one of the principal Materials requisite for the said
buildings: (viz.)

THat the earth whereof the Brick shall be made, be good and fit for that
purpose, The first digging thereof to be between the Feasts of S. Michael the
Archangel, and S. Thomas the Apostle, and the second digging, casting, or
turning up of the said earth, to be at or before the last day of February then
following; And that no person whatsoever do presume to dig or make any
Brick in any place within one mile of the Gates of the said City of London,
or within one mile of Our Palace of Westminster.

THat the said earth be sufficiently and well wrought and tempered before it
be molded, and the Brickmakers cause no earth to be molded for Brick, but
only between the Feast of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary, and
the last day of August yearly, and at no other time or season of the year.

THat in the moulding of the said Brick, the Moulds be thoroughly and well
filled, and not set in the Moulds in the laying down; And that they be
sufficiently and well dried before they be put into the Kilne, and then
carefully and thoroughly well burned, so as for the assize every Brick being
burned contain in length nine inches, in breadth four inches one quarter and
half a quarter of an inch, and in thickness two inches and one quarter of an
inch.

THat the price of Brickes (being thus wrought and made in goodness, size, and
manner as aforesaid) shall not exceed the rate of eight shillings the thousand
at the Kilne; And if any excessive rate be demanded for the carriage of the
said Brickes from the Kilne to the place where they shall be to be used, the
Commissioners for buildings to moderate the same, according to equity in their
good discretions; And that no person or persons shall make, or cause to be
made, within five miles of any of the Gates of the City of London, nor bring
by water or land, or utter, sell, or put to sale within the said City, or any
place or places within five miles thereof, as aforesaid, any Brickes made or
wrought contrary to the directions aforesaid, nor sell the same at any higher
rate then is before mentioned.

THat no person or persons within the said City of London, or within three
miles from any the Gates thereof, or from Our Palace of Westminster, shall in
defrauding the intent of this Proclamation, support or strengthen any Buildings
so ruinous and old, as are unfit to be continued, by digging of Cellars, and
bringing up new brick walls, by erecting new Chimneys and Staire-cases, by
placing of pieces of Timber, by setting on new Roofes or Rafters, and thrusting
out of Dormers, knitting and fastening together the said new additions unto the
old Timber, by Bars and Crampes of Iron, or other like devices, unless he
or they shall be thereunto licenced and allowed by Our Commissioners for
Buildings.

THat no person or persons within the limits last aforesaid, do at any time or
times hereafter presume or attempt, to erect, cover, ouerlay, or enclose any
Houels, or others Sheds of Timber, with Reeds, Faggots, Hay, Straw, Boards, or
other Materials, or do raise up any Wall, Pale, or bank of earth, to which
Sheds may be added, or do repair or new make into the Streets, any manner of
bulkes, stalles, windows, doors, or other offensive issues, or do alter or
change the use of any dwelling house, or other building, to any more noisome or
offensive use, end, or purpose then the same was employed before the time of
the demolishing or altering the same, without the special license and
allowance of the said Commissioners for buildings. And for that the dividing of
houses into several tenements and habitations, and the letting part of houses
and chambers to Inmates and vndersitters, is no less inconvenient then
excessive buildings, as well in regard of surcharge of people, especially of the
worst sort, and for breeding and spreading of infection, as otherwise, We do
also command these Articles following to be duly observed.

THat no person or persons within the City of London, or three miles from any
the Gates thereof, do divide any dwelling house by Lease, sufferance, or
otherwise, into, or for any more tenements or dwellings then are at this
present, or have been heretofore used within the same by the space of thirty
years last past.

THat no person do hereafter receive into any house, any Inmates or
vndersitters, or any more Families then one.

That no person or persons who shall erect a new house upon, or within the
precincts of an old foundation, shall divide the same into more Tenements, or
several dwellings then were used in the said former houses.

BY the due observation of which several Articles, as the uniformity of the
buildings will bring much honor to the City, and grace and ornament, both to
the streets thereof, and to the neighbor towns; so the building with Brick
or Stone will be more durable, and more safe from the danger and casualty of
fire: and withal the reducing of all sorts of houses to this order, and the
present removing of Inmates and Vndersitters according to this direction, will
in short time discontinue, and take away the many Cottages, Sheds, and base
places of habitations in By lanes, and back Streets, whereby the City,
Suburbs, and Confines will become more suitable, and less subject to that
danger of sickness and infection, which by the unwholesome pestering of
multitudes of poor people together, is now threatened against the same. And
therefore We upon mature, and deliberate consideration taken of the premises,
do straightly charge and command, all and every person and persons, of
whatsoever degree, quality, or condition he or they be: That he, they, and
every of them, do well and truly observe and keep, all and singular the
Articles before specified, in all things to them respectively belonging, as
they will avoid Our high displeasure, and such further penalties and
punishments, as their contempts and neglects herein shall demerit, and by Our
Prerogative royal, or otherwise may be inflicted upon them.

Given at Our Court at Nonsuch: the sixteenth day of July, in the sixth year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXX.
