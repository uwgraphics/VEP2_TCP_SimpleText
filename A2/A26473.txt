ADVICE To the WOMEN and MAIDENS OF LONDON.

Showing, that instead of their usual Pastime; and education in Needle Work,
Lace, and Point-making, it were far more Necessary and Profitable to apply
themselves to the right Understanding and Practice of the method of keeping
books of account: whereby, either single, or married, they may know their
Estates, carry on their Trades, and avoid the Danger of a helpless and forlorn
Condition, incident to Widows.

With some Essays, or rudiments for young beginners; in twelve Articles.

By one of that Sex.

LONDON, Printed for Benjamin Billingssley at the Printing press in Cornhill,
1678.

ADVICE To the WOMEN and MAIDENS OF LONDON.
Ladies and Gentlewomen,
PErmit one of your Sex to give you, as far as her small knowledge will reach
some hints to the right understanding and use of Accounts: an Art so useful for
all sorts, sexes and degrees of persons, especially for such as ever think to
have to do in the world in any sort of Trade or Commerce, that next to a stock
of Money, Wares and Credit, this is the most necessary thing.

Nor let us be discouraged, or put by the inspection thereof by being bid
meddle with our distaff, for I have heard it affirmed by those who have lived
in foreign part, that Merchants and other trades men have no other
Book-keepers then their Wives: who by this means (the Husband dying) are well
acquainted with the nature and manner of the trade, and are so certain how, and
where their stock is; that they need not be beholden to servants or friends for
guidance.

And for telling us that the government of the House appertains to us, and the
trades to our Fathers or Husbands; (under favor) the one is to be minded, and
the other not neglected, for there is not that danger of a families overthrow
by the sause wanting it is right relish, or the Table or Stools misplac't, as
by a widows ignorance of her concern as to her estate, and I hope husbands will
not oppose this when help and ease is intended to them whilst living; and
safety to their name and posterity after death: except they have private trades
(too much in mode) whereof they would have their wives wholly ignorant. In such
a case indeed, one that knows not that one and two make three suits best. And
let us not fear we shall want time and opportunity to manage the decencies of
our house; for what is an hour in a day, or half a day in a week, to make
inspection into that, that is to keep me and mine from ruin and poverty.

Methinks now the objection may be that this art is too high and mysterious for
the weaker Sex it will make them proud: Women had better keep to their
Needle Work, point laces, etc. and if they come to poverty, those small Crafts
may give them some mean releif.

To which I answer, That having in some measure practiced both Needle Work and
Accounts I can averr, that I never found this Masculine Art harder or more
difficult then the effeminate achievements of Lace-makeing, gum-work or the
like, the attainment whereof need not make us proud: And God forbid that the
practice of an useful Virtue should prompt us to a contrary Vice.

Therefore if I might advise you, you should let the poor serve you with these
mean things, whilst by gaining or saving an estate you shall never be out of
capacity to store your selves more abundantly with those trifles, then your own
industry in such matters could have ever blessed ye

And now Gentlewomen I give you those rudiments of Accounts which are the
subject of this little pamphlet and transmit this learning to you the best I
can, in the self same manner as it came to me.

Know then that my Parents were very careful to cause me to learn writing and
Arithmetic, and in that I proceeded as far as Reduction, the Rule of Three and
Practice, with other Rules, for without the knowledge of these I was told I
should not be capable of Trade and Book-keeping and in these I found no
discouragement for though Arithmetic set my brains at work, Yet there was much
delight in seeing the end, and how each question produced a fair answer and
informed me of things I knew not.

Afterward I was put to keep an exact account of the expense of Housekeeping,
and other petty Charges, my Father made it my office to call all persons to an
account every night what they had laid out, and to reimburse it them, and set
all down in a book, and this is the way to make one a Cashier as they are
termed, and one that can keep a fair account of receipts and payments of Money
or Cash-book, is in a good way toward the understanding of Book-keeping: She
that is so well versed in this as to keep the accounts of her Cash right and
daily entered in a book fair without blotting, will soon be fit for greater
undertakings.

Now in regard that other learnings do depend upon this petty Cash account; I
find it therefore convenient to give you an example of a months expense, and
you will thereby see what further use may be made of it afterward.

Therefore to begin, my Father gives me at several times in the month of
January, the sum of 21 l. 17 s. 11 d. the account of the expenses whereof is as
follows.

Thus much for the particular Account of the Expenses in January, amounting to
21 l. 17 s. 11 d. Which (being past and allowed) I am required to draw out in
another form, and to make out, in particulars, how much thereof is Expended in
Meat, how much in Bread and Meal, how much in Fish, etc. And so to subdivide,
and branch out this Account into as many parcels as is convenient, to show
which way my Money goes, and put me upon Considering how I may lessen my
Expenses for the time to come. The Form of this Account, is as follows.

I know not any thing that wants Explanation in these two several Accounts,
except the Reason of the Figures preceding each Sum of Money: The Use thereof
is this. In the first Account, page 4. The first Article is 4 d. paid for a
Book; and the note of Reference thereto is 12. To show that you have that Sum,
and that parcel past to Account in page 12. And in page 12, under the Title of
Books and Schooling, I find the number of Reference to be 4, showing that the
said Entry of 4 d. for a Book, was there Originally Entered, viz. in page 4.

Now, why all this, you will say?

I Answer, were there no other reason than that, I might (from the second
Account, wherein I do only set the Sum, and not recite for what) turn the
readilier to the first Account, and see what it is for; this would recompense
the trouble: But there is a further and great use thereof to be made in the
keeping an Account of Trade, as shall be shown in due place.

And I do not doubt, but, that if Parents and Superiors employ their Children
or Servants (one at a time, That is, one in one Year, and another in another)
in this or the like way of keeping the Accounts of House Expenses, or other
petty Charges (besides the satisfaction they will have to see how, and which
way their Money goes.) They will also train up their Children to be regular and
handy in Accounts of greater Moment.

I have not further to say, concerning this Account of House-Expences, but,
(that at the Years end, when the Account is past and approved) there should be
a Scheme thereof drawn out of the said Account, in manner following, viz.

The several Gradations how the aforesaid Years Expenses did arise.

-- 4 39 1 5 26 6 4 21 -- 11 33 11 11 334 7 3

This foregoing Scheme has two principal Aspects: First, you see the Total
Expense of each Month at the bottom thereof, viz. January 21 l. 17 s. 11.
Febr. 30 l. 1 s. 6 d. etc. Secondly, you see the Total Years Expense of each
Commodity in the last Collumn; and so the Years Expense for Flesh-meat is 62 l.
5 s. 1 d. And for Fish 9 l 17 s. 10. etc. And the Total of the whole Years
Charge, at the foot of all, to be 334 l. 7 s. 3.

Note, That the Account of Promiscuous Incident Charges (amounting in the Year
to 16 l. 9 s. 3 d.) may be, if you will, distinguished into other several
heads, as Port of Letters, Boat and Coach-hire, Travelling-charges, and the
like.

And thus much may serve to be spoken concerning this petty-charge Account: In
the Practice whereof two things are to be minded, viz. Exactness and Neatness;
without Exactness it is an insignificant thing, a labor in vain. And without
Neatness, the Accountant does but manifest her unaptness, and unreadiness.
Therefore, if one Year do not render the Accountants exact and neat, let them
Practice it two Years: For if a true Account be not kept without blots, it will
never commend the Artist.

I should now, in performance of my Promise in the Title Page, present you with
some Essays or Rudiments of Accounts in the way of a Trade; but what can be
expected in these few sheets? Or why should I here Copy the Works of others?
The best Service I can do you, is to refer you to that Book lately Printed,
whence I derive all my small stock of Learning in Accounts. The Title of the
Book is, Debtor and Creditor made Easy; and is to be had of the Bookseller
whose Name is affixed to the Front of this.

But that I may do something, to acquit my self of this Engagement, I shall
here Present you with some short Precepts, and a few useful Examples for a
beginner, in the wat of Trade; and leave you to Reap the Harvest of this
Learning from better Authors.

The General Precept therefore is this, That when any Goods are bought or sold,
when any Money is received or paid; in short, when any Bargain is made, each
Action or Contract is to be Entered in your Leiger, or Book of Accounts twice,
viz. Debtor and Creditor. For you must consider, that every Receipt or Payment,
every Buying and Selling, or other Contract is a transferring of Property from
one to another; so that the Person, or thing, who is the Receiver or Borrower,
is intended here for the Debtor; and the Person who pays, or the thing
delivered or lent, is the Creditor. But I cannot more aptly Explain my meaning,
than in referring you to the Petty-charge Account before going; wherein you
have this Rule of a double Entry plainly Demonstrated. For in the Month of
January I Receive 21 l. 17 s. 11 d. This I disburse, as has been shown. In
Flesh 3 l. 6 s. -- In Fish 16 s. 7 d. etc. Here now the Account of Flesh is
Debtor, 3 l. 6 s. and the Account of Fish is Debtor 16 s. 7 d. etc. and that of
Money or Cash is Creditor for all those Sums; and thus one answers the other,
and Balances the Account.



The first thing she is to do is to draw an Inventory of her Estate, as
follows, viz.

In Ready Money -- 60 l. --. --

A Piece of black A-la-mode, Containing 55 Else, cost 3 s. per. Ell. 0^ l. 05
s. --

20 Dozen of Women's Gloves, cost 16 s. per Dozen -- 16 l. --

Due to her by Mrs. Martha Thorpe -- 20 l. --

So her whole Estate is -- 104 l. 5 s. --

These four Branches of her Stock are to be kept in so many several Heads of
Accounts, as in the former Rules of House Accounts: So that first Money or Cash
is to be made Debtor, and an Account of Stock, Creditor: Turn over to the
Leiger, which begins at page 28, and you will see this done; the Debtor is always
on the left hand, and the Creditor on the right. There you will find it so
entered, viz. Cash in page 28, is Debtor to Stock, in page 29. And Stock, in
page 29. is Creditor by Cash, in page 28. And in the like manner you will find
the other three Parcels entered in page 30, 31.

Having thus Posted your Account of Stock, and set open your shop, you begin
your Trade after some such manner as this: And here I desire the Reader or
Learner, as she reads these following Instructions, to cast her eye upon the
Leiger where the Parcels are entered.

s. per dozen -- 5 l. --

For this (having Received Money) your Cash is Debtor, Debtor 28. Creditor 31.
and Account of Gloves is Creditor; as you see it done in page 28.31. -- 5 l.
--

Thorp five dozen of Gloves, at 22 s. per dozen -- 5 l. 10 s. --

To Enter this, Mrs. Thorp (not yet having paid) is Debtor, Debtor 30. Creditor
31.
and Account of Gloves Creditor, as will appear by the Figures of Reference in
the Margin. 5 l. 10 s.

2 s. 6 d. each Hood in stuff only, which is equivalent to 3 s. per Ell. -- 3
l. 15 s. --

For this, make in your Leiger an Account of Hoods, and let that be Debtor, and
Allamode Creditor. 3 l. 15 s.

Paid your Sempstress for Silk and making the said Hoods, Debtor 32. Creditor
31.
at 6 d. a piece. -- l. -- 15 s. --

l. -- 15 s. --

Note, Debtor 32. Creditor 29
when I say Debtor to Cash, it is in short to express, that Hoods is Debtor,
and Cash is Creditor. And here also Observe all along in your Leiger, that
every Debtors Parcel begins [To] and then mentions the Creditor; and every
Creditor begins [By] and then mentions the Debtor. The first tells whither you
are going, the second whence you come.

Thorp, in part of her Debt -- 15 l. --

Make Cash Debtor, Debtor 28. Creditor 31.
and Mrs. Thorp Creditor. 15 l. --

Henry Garstang 20 dozen of Gloves, at 15 s. per dozen. -- 15 l. --

Here Gloves are Debtor, Debtor 30. Creditor 33
and you must state an Account for Henry Garstang, and make that Creditor. 15 l.

You pay the said Garstang in Money 10 l. and by 30 Hoods, at 3 s. 4 d. per
Hood. -- 5 l. --

1. Henry Garstang is Debtor to Cash for the 10 l. paid him. Debtor 32.
Creditor 29. Debtor 32. Creditor 33.
-- 10 l. --

2. The said Garstang is Debtor to Hoods 5 l. for 30 sold him.

James Jones two Pieces of Bag-Holland, containing 60 Else, at 5 s. per Ell. --
15 l. --

Four Pieces of Cambrick, at 40 s. per Piece. 8 l. --

23 l. --

Make an Account of Linen Debtor, Debtor 32. Creditor 33
and James Jones, Creditor. -- 23 l. --

Both these must be new opened in the Leiger.

Jones in Money -- 12 l. 10 s. -- And he is willing to accept of the Assignment
upon Mrs. Thorp for the Debt she owes, being -- 10 l. 10. --

So he is paid in full -- 23 l. --

By this time I hope it is easy to be understood that Jones is Debtor, Debtor
32. Creditor 29. Debtor 32. Creditor 31.
and Cash Creditor for the 12 l. 10 s. paid.

And he is Debtor, and Mrs. Thorp Creditor for the Assignment of -- 10 l. 10 s.
--

etc. the charge thereof, as by the Sempstress's Bill, amounts to, and you paid
her -- 2 l. 10 s. --

This is easily put in Order thus. Debtor 32. Creditor 29.


Linen Debtor, and Cash Creditor -- 2 l. 10 s. --

Barbados, who has occasion for about half of your Linen, and the parcel is
made out, proportionable to his pay, which is not to be in Money, but in two
Hogsheads of Sugar, weighing Nett 14 C. 3 q. 14 l. The price 26 s. per C.
amounting to 19 l. 6 s. 9 d.

The Goods being Bartered and interchanged, you need only make an Account of
Sugar, Debtor 34. Creditor 33.
Debtor, and Linen Creditor -- 19 l 6 s 9 d

l 6 s 8 d.

Make an Account in your Leiger of Housekeeping, Debtor 34. Creditor 29.
and let that be Debtor to Cash -- 3 l 6 s 8 d

And thus I have done, as to carrying on a Trade, for I dare not swell this
into a farther progress; this may suffice to give you a relish of an Art, which
the more known, will yield the pleasanter taste.

But all this will signify but little, unless you bring your Accounts to a
certain conclusion or Balance, whereby to see how your new Stock differs from
your Old.

To accomplish this, there are two Accounts more to be stated in your Leiger,
which have not yet been opened; that is, the Account of Profit and Loss, and
the Account of Balance. The first of these you could not have been without, if
this Trade had been a little farther carried on. That of Balance is ever the
last Account in the old Leiger, and the first in the new, as experience will
demonstrate.

To effect this, look over your Leiger from first to last, and single out the
Accounts which remain open; I mean, such which are not even on both sides, as
Thorps, Garstangs, and Jones's are. Then consider what may be the reason that
the open Accounts are not closed as those last mentioned. And you will find two
main Reasons; first, for that there are still diverse goods undisposed of.
Secondly, in regard of a surplusage by Profit, or a diminution by Loss: In both
these cases these two Accounts of Profit and Loss, and Balance will set all
right.

Begin therefore with the Account of Cash, and you will find that there is
still remaining in your hands 50 l. 18 s. 4 d.

To even therefore this Account, Debtor 34. Creditor 29.
make Balance Debtor Cash 50 l. 18 s. 4. so close up that.

The next is the Account of Alamode, wherein you see is remaining unsold 30
Else, which at 3 s. an Ell is -- 4 l. 10 s. --

Make also Balance Debtor to Alamode 4 l. 10 s. and that is evened. Debtor 34.
Creditor 31


The next Account is that of Gloves, which is not to be closed up without twice
the Labor, as the former, for, in this, you have reference both to Profit and
loss, and Balance. First, value the Gloves you have remaining, reckoning half
of the first parcel 8 l. and all the last 15 l. both which being 23 l. carry to
Account of Balance, as you did the two former, viz.

Balance is Debtor to Gloves for 360 pair resting unsold -- 23 l. -- Debtor 34.
Creditor 31.


Then you will find 50 s. wanting to make up the Debtor side, and that is clear
Profit; for which, say,

Gloves Debtor to Profit and Loss, Debtor 30. Creditor 35.
2 l. 10 s. gained upon that Account.

The next is the Account of Hoods, which is to be closed up with Profit and
Loss, Debtor 32. Creditor 35.
10 s. being so much gained upon that Account.

The next is that of Linen, which must be evened just as the Account of Gloves
was; therefore value the Linen remaining, at -- 12 l. 15 s. --

For this, Balance is Debtor, Debtor 34. Creditor 33
and Linen is Creditor -- 12 l. 15 s. --

And then you will find 6 l. 11 s. 9 d. Profit: Then say,

Linen is Debtor to Profit and Loss -- 6 l. 11 s. 9 d.

Afterward you come to your Account of Sugar, Debtor 32. Creditor 35 Debtor
34. Creditor 35
and that is all remaining; therefore say,

Balance Debtor to Sugar -- 19 l. 6 s. 9 d.

Then your Housekeeping Account, and that is to be placed on the losing side
of Profit and Loss, thus,

Profit and Loss Debtor to House-keep. Debtor 34. Creditor 35.
-- 3 l. 6, 8 d.

And then compare your Account of Profit and Loss, and see which side weighs
heaviest, and that is the Creditor side, amounting to 9 l. 11 s. 9 d. which is
the Sum Total of this weeks gain, out of which deduct the charges of
Housekeeping, which is on the Debtor side, and the clear Profit is -- 6 l. 5
s. 1 d.

Carry this 6 l. 5 s. 1 d. to your Account of Stock, at page 29. being an
apparent increase to that Account, which before was 104 l. 5. and now by this
additon, is 110 l. 10 s. 1 d. thus,

Profit and Loss Debtor to Account of Stock 6 l. 5 s. 1 d. Debtor 34. Creditor
29


Lastly, carry over the Account of Stock to Balance, thus,

Stock is Debtor to Balance -- 110 l. 10 s. 1 d. Debtor 28. Creditor 35


When this is done, if Balance Balances it self, and be alike on both sides, as
you see it is, then you may conclude your Leiger is right posted; else you must
never cease till you find out the Error. And this Account of Balance (being
that which demonstrates where your Estate lies) is all you need carry over to
your new Book. The Reader is not to imagine that it is intended she should
Balance her Accounts and have new Books every week, once a Year is often enough.

And in this manner ought a Merchants Leiger appear, every Account therein
Balanced to one Farthing, which will be both a Credit and a Delight to her.

If a Retailing Shopkeeper Objects, That it were too painful to enter every
pair of Gloves, etc. which he sells, in his Leiger after the aforesaid
manner. I Answer, There is a ready way to comprise a weeks Retail, though
consisting of many particulars, into a very short Method. But this and other
difficulties are all removed in that forementioned Book, whence I derive my
Learning.

I Advise the Practitioners to take the pains, as they Read the Propositions
and Instructions, not to satisfy themselves by looking in the Leiger; but as
they understand each Parcel, to post it themselves in a Paper Book till the
whole be finished.
