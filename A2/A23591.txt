Here begi^nith the secunde aage of the world duri^g to habr^ham

This Noe wos a ryghtwys man and fond grace a ne^dys god. When Noe wos vC. year
of age he had gettyn Chaam Sem and Iaphet that time by the cumandment off god
he be gone to make a schyp. and he made it parfite in a hundyrth year. And
the.C. yer completyt our lord god apperyt again to him. and comma^dyt him. that
he with his wyffe and^ his chyldyrn and the wyfes of them should entyr the schyp
with all manner of bestys. and all manner of folis all so. etc.

And a noon the flod came. and stood a bown all hillis xv. cubittis. vide plura
gen.7. Aftyr the flode. a great drunki^nes betyd un to Noe. and through the
occasion of that drunkynnes he blessit his ij so^is. Sem and Iaphet. for the
fadyrs honor that they haad to him. and^ for the honest shame that they couyrt
meekly there fadyr membyrs when that he wos droyng. and his son Cham for his
skornnyng and his vnreuerens he cursed. And here aft^r sent Austyn: is mad the
first mention of bondage. And of nobulnes contrary to hit. for Noe said that
Cham should be seruand in bondage to Sem and^ Iaphet. for his vnreuerens. Nerye
shall not trow that all that desce^dit of Cham war vnnobull men. and of no
power. for they began first to be mighty men oon the earth as it is opyn of
Nemroth and^ the kings of Chanaon and ascorum. Nerall of Sem and Iaphet war
vertuus and nobull and mighty men when almost euerych oon fell in to the crime
of ydolatry. and war often times oppressit of odyr men. Bot this blessing and
this cursyng has a respec to virtue and vice. for the whe^cch a man is called
truli a nobull man or a vnnobull man. for he that is vertuus is a nobull man.
and he that is vnuertuus is not nobull. The same manner of wyese. tho that
foloyt the faith of Abrahe rather war called his chyldyr then the Iues the which
carnally descendit from him. Never the leesse they had a spiritual preualeg of

Incipit regnum britanie nunc dict anglia.

Afor yt I will speak of Brute it shall be showed how ye lord of england wos
first namd albio^ and^ by what c^cheso^ it vos so namit IN the nobull land of
Sirrie there wos a nobull king and mighty and^ a man of great reno^e that wos
called Dieclisian yt well and^ wortheli him governed and^ ruled through his noble
chiualri So that he conquered all the lands about him so that almost all the
kings of the world to him were ente^da^t. Hit be fell thus that this
Dioclisian spoused a ge^till damisell that wos wonder fair that was his emes
daughter labana: and she loved him as reason would so that he gat upon her
xxxiij. doughtres: of the which the eldest wos called Albine and^ thees
damiselles when they come^ un to age bicomen so fair that it wos vo^der. where
of Dioclisian ano^e let make asompnyng and^ commanded by his lettres that all
the kings that helden of him should cum at a certain day as in his letters were
contained to make a riall fest At which day thider they co^en and^ brought with
hem amirallis princes and^ dukes: and nobull chivalry. The fest wos rialy
arrayed and there they leued in Joy and^ myrthe enough: that it wos wonder to
wit. And it befeell thus that this Dioclisian thought to marie his doughtres
among although kings that tho were at that solempnite. and^ so they spakene and^
ded that albine his eldest daughter and^ all her sustres richely were married un
to xxxiij. kings that were lords of great honor and^ of pouer at this
solempnyte And when the solempnite wos done every king took his wife and lad
them in there own co^tre and^ there maad hem queen's. and it befell thus afterward
that this dame albine bicome so stout and so stern that she told little pris
of her lord and of him had scorn and desspyt and would not done his will butt
she would have her own will in diverse matres and all her other sustres
euerychone bear them so euel against there lords: that it was wondyr to wytt and
for as much as them thought that there husbondes were naught of so hy perage
comen as there fadre. But tho kings that were there lords would have chastized
them with fair manner upon all love and frendshipp that they should amend there
lith er condycions: but all wos for naught for they diden there own will i^ all
thing that them liked: and had of poer where for tho. xxxiij kings upon a time
and often times beten there wyfes for they wened that they would amended there
tatches and there wilkednes bot of soche co^dicions they were that for fair
speech and warnyng they didden all the wors and for betynges eft sons mochel
wers where for the king that had wedded Albine wrote the taches and conditions
off his wyf^ albin and the letter sent to Dioclision her fadre. and when the
other kings herd that Albines lord had sent a letter to Dioclisian. anon they
sent lettres enseled with there seals the conditions and taches of there wyfes.
When the king dioclisian saw and herd so many playntes of his doughtres he wos
sore ashamed and become wonder anger and wroth toward his doughtres and thought
both night and day if he tho might a mend it: that they so misded and anon
sent his lettres un to the xxxiij. kings that they should cu^ to him and bring
with hem their wyfes euerychone at a certane day: for he would there chastise hem
of there wikkednesse if he might in any manner of wise So that the kings comen
all at that time and day that tho wos set bitwene him and the kings.
Dioclisian them under song with much honor and^ maad a sole^pne feste to all that were under his lordshipp. and^ the third day after that sole^pnite the
king Dioclisian sent after his xxxiij. doughtres that they should cum and^ speak
with him i^ his chamber and^ when they war come he spoke un to them of there
wikkednes and^ of there cruelte and^ spituesly hem reproved and vndernam and^ to
hem he said that if they would not be chastised they should his love lose for
ever more. And when the ladies herden all this they be come^ abashed and
gretli aschamed and to there fadre they said that they would make all amends and
so they deperted out from there fadres chamber. and dame Albine that wos the
eldest suster lad hem all to her chamber and tho made void all that were theryn
so that no lefe wos among hem but she and her sustres yfere: Tho said this
Albine my fair sustres well we know that the king our fadre us has reproved
shamed and despyseed for enchesone to make us obedient un to owr housbandes.
but certes that shall I never whiles that I leave since that I am come of a more
hier kings blod then mine housbond is. and^ when she had thus said. all her
sustres said the same. and^ tho said Albine full well I wot fair sustres that
owr housbandes has plened un to our fader upon us wherefore he has us thus soul
reproved and^ despised. wherefore sustres my counsel is that this night when our
housbandes been a bed all we with one assent: cutten her throtes and^ than we
may been in pees of hem and^ better we moo do this thing under our fadres
power than ower where else. And anon all the ladis consented and^ granted to
this co^sell. and^ when night wos co^yn the lordd and^ ladies went to bed
and^ anon as there lords were in sleep: they cut all heir housbondes
throtes. and^ so they flow them all. when at Dioclisian the king her fadre herd
of this thing. he bicome hugeli wroth against his doughtres and^ ano^e would hem
all have brenet But all the barons and^ lords of sirrie: cou^ceilled not so for
to do such stretnes to his own doughtres: bot only should void the land of
them: for ever more: so that they never should com ayene. and so he did And
Dioclisian that wos there fadre ano^e commanded them to gone in to shypp: and^
delivered to hem vitailles for half a year. And when this wos done: all the
sustren went in to the ship and^ sailed forth i^ the sea: and bitoke all there
friends to Appolyn that wos there god^ And so long thee sailed in the sea till
at the last they come and^ arreued i^ an isle that wos all wilderness. and^
when dame Albion wos come to that land and^ all her sustres this Albine went
frest forth out of the shypp: and said to her other sustres: for as much quod
she as I am the oldest suster of all this company and^ first this land have
taken: and^ for as much os my nam is Albine I will that this land be called
albio^ after mine own name and^ ano^e al her sustres granted to her with a good
will Tho ve^t out al ye sustres of ye ship: and toke^ the land albion as her
suster called it And there they went up and^ down and fond nether man ne woman
ne child but wyld bestes of diverse kinds. and when there vitalles war
dispended and they failled: they fed them with herbs: and^ fruits in seson
of the year. and so they leued as they best might and aftee that they token
flessh of diverse bestes and bycame wonder fat and so they desired mannys
compane: and ma^nys kind that hem failled. and for hete they woxen wonder
coragious of kind so that they desired more ma^nys company then any othyr
solace or myrthe when the deuel that perceuyd and went by diverse contreys and
no^me bodi of the eir: and likyng natures shad off men: and come in to the
land of Albion. and lay by thoo wyme^ and shad tho natures upon them: and they
consaued after and^ they brought forth Geantys of the which one wos called
Gogmagog. and an other Langherigan. and so they were named by diverse names. and
in this manner they come forth: and were borne horrible geantes in Albion. and
they duelled in caves: and i^ hills at there will: and had the land of Albion
as them lyked: un to the time that Brut arrived: and come to Totnes that wos in
the isle of Albion. and there this brute conquered: and skomfited these geantes
above said.

Here be geneth now how Brut was gotten: and how he slew first his mother. and
after his fader: and how he conquered Albion that after he named Bretan after
his own name that now is called England: after the name of Engist of saxony.
This Brute came in to Bretan a bowte the.xviij. year of Hely
BE it know that in the nobull cite of greet Troy: theer wos a nobull Knight
and a man of great pouer: that wos called Eneas and when the cite of Troy was
lost and destroed through them of Greece: this Eneas with all his meyne fled
thens: and comei^ to Lumbardy: that tho wos lord and governor of that land a
king that wos called Latyne. and a another king there wos that wos called
Turocelyne that strongli wered upon this king latyne that often times did him
much harm And when this king latyne herd that Eneas was comen he vnderfeng
him with mochel honor and him with held for as much as he had herd of him
and wist well that he wos a nobull knight and a worthy of his body and^ of hiy
deeds: this Eneas helpet king Latyne i^ his were and^ shortly for to tell so
well and so worthily he did: that he slew Turocelyne and^ discomfited him and^
all his pepull. And when all this wos done: king latyne yaf all that land that
wos turocelinis to this noble man Eneas in marriage with Lauyne his daughter the
most fair creature that any man wist: and so they lived to geder in joy and
myrthe all the days of their lyfes time. and after Asconyus son to Eneas
wedded a wife and upon her he begat a son that wos called Silueyn and^ this
silueyn when he cold sum resun of man un wittyng his fadre and a yenst his
will acquentyd him with a damysell that wos cosyn to Lauyne that wos king
latynes dougter the queen that wos eneas wife and brought the damysell with
child. and whon Ascanius his fader it wist anon let enquere of the wisest
masters and of the grettest klerkes what child the damisey should bring forth
and they ansuered and^ said that she should bring ofrth a son that should kill
both his fadre and also his modre: and so he did: For his mother dyed in beryng
of him. And when this child wos borne: his fader let call him Brute: and the
masters siyd that he should do much harm and^ sorrow in money diverse places:
and after he should come to great honor and worship: This king ascanius dyed
when god would and Silueyn his son resaued the land and made him wonderly well
beloved among his pepull. and when Brute thatt wos Siluenus son wos xv. year
old he went upon a day with his fadre for to play and^ solace and^ as Brute
should a shote un to an heart his harew myshapped and glaced and so there Brutkel
led his fader.

How Brute wos dreuen out of the land and how he held him in Greece.
And when this myschance befell: all the pepull of the land made sorrow ynowgh
and war sore an angreyd and for encheson thereof they driven Brute out of the
land and would not suffer him among them: and he saugh that he might not there
a bide and he went from thens in to greece: and^ there he fond vij.M. men that
were of the lynage and^ kynred of Troy that worcester come^ of great blood as the
stori tells as of men and women and^ child the which were all holden in
thraldom and^ bondage of the king Pandras of greece for the death of Achilles
that wos bitrayed and^ slain at troy. this Brute wos a wonder fair man and a
strong and huge of his age and of glad cheyr and sembland and^ also worthy of
body and wos wellbeloued emonges his pepule. This king Pandras herd speak of
his goodness and his conditions and anon made him duel with him so that Brute
bicome wonder prive and^ much beloved with the king: so that long time brute
duelled with the king: so at the last they of troy and brute spakyn to gedre of
kynred and of lynage and^ of acquantance and there plened them un to brute of
there sorrow and of there bondage and of money other sh^mes that ye king Pandros
had them done: and^ to brute they sayn upon a time ye ben a lord of our lineage
and^ a strong man and a mighty be ye ou^ captayn and lord and^ governor and^
we will be cume your me^ and your commandmentes done in all manner of things
and bring ye us out of this wrecchitnes and bandage and^ we will fight with the
king for troth with ye grace of the great god we shall him overcome and we shall
make you king of the land and to you done homage and^ of you we shall hold
evermore. Brute had tho great pite of there bondage that they were brought in:
and preuely went hem from the kings court: and tho that were of Troy we^ and^
put them in to wodis and in to montaygens and them the held and sent un to
king Pandros that he should give them leu sauely for to wend out of the land for
they would no longer duelle in his bondage: The king Pandras wax tho sore annoyd
and tho swore that he would slae them euerychone and ordeneyd a grett pouer and
went toward them all for to feght but Brute and his men manli them defended
and fersly foughten and killed all the kings men that none of them ascaped and
token the king and^ him held in prison and ordained counsel by tweyn them
what they mygth done: and^ su^ said that he should be put to death and su^ said
that he should be exiled out of the land and su^ said that he should be brent And
tho spoke a wise knight that was called Mempris and said to Brute and to all
tho of Troy if king Pa^dras would yield him and have his life I council that he
give un to brute that is our duke and our soferayne his daughter Gennogen to a
wife and in marriage with her an hondreth ships well araied and all his tresour
of gold and silver of corn and of wine and as much as os needs to have of o
thing and other and than go we out of his land and^ ordayn we us a land else
where for we ne none of our kynred that comen after us shall never have pees in
this land among them of greece: for we have slain so money of there kynghtes and
of other friends that evermore were and contake should be among us: brut tho
and all his folk consented well to that counsel and this things they tolden
to king Pa^dras and he for to have his life granted as much as they axid: and

How Coryn beco^e brutes man and^ how king goffar wos disco^fid
WHen Brute hade this ansuere of diane the goddess ano^e he let the ancres
wynd up and sailed i^ to the high see and^ when he and^ his men had sailed xx.
days and mo they fond fast beside a cost of the sea a thousand me^ of the
lynage and kynred of Troy and there sovereign and^ there master of all was called
Corin. and when Brute wist whennes they weer he tho took them with much Joy i^
to his shippis and^ led them forth with him. this Corin there beco^e brutes man
and to him did homage and^ so long they sailled forth i^ yt se till they come^
i^ to Gascoyne and ano^e they arrived i^ the haven of liegers and there they
duellid viij. days them for to rest and^ there sails to amend there that it
wos need: tidings sone come to king Goffar that was lord of the land how yt
much pepill of strange land were arreuid in to his land in the haven of liegers
wherefore he was sore angreyd and anoyde that they come and arrived in his land
with out his lysens and his leave. And anon he ordained him a great pouer for to
drive out Brute and to shend him and all his pepull: bout it was so that king
Goffar wos discomfited and all his pepull: and him self flede in to France:
there to seek help and socour. And in that time reigned in france xij. kings:
and a xi. of them assemaled a great pouer for to help Goffar and for to fight
ayenes Brute: this Goffar duelle with them of france half a year and more.
And in the mean time when goffar was in france. Brute and his company
destruyed all the land of Gascoyne and let take all tresour that king goffar
had and there let bring it all in to his ships And this Brute founden in that
land a fair place and couenabull and their brute made a fair Castle and a
strong. When that this wos done king Goffar come fro france and xi. kings
with him and brought with them.xx: M. men for to fight with Brute and his compani
and brute had but vijM. and iijC. men: and neuerthelees when the ij. hosts
met to gedre: brutes folk thorgh help of him self and of Turyn his cosyn
and^ of Corin that well and manly him defended and fought so tell that little
tym they had killed of the fraunshemen ijM. and mo. anon all tho that were
alive fled a way And in this batell Turin brutes cosyn was slain and brute let
enteer him worthily when he had space and^ leyser in the Castle that he had
made: and tho let call that same castle Tours for be cause of the name of
Turin that there wos entyred and yet in to this day there is a nobull Cite that
is c^lled Tours. And when king goffar wist that Turin wos deyd he co^ ayene
with his men and after yaf a strong batell un to brute. bot brute and his men
were so weary for fighttyng that they might no longer endure bot to meegre him
and all his. and than Brute went i^ to his castle with all his men and^ made
the yates fast for to save them and for to take consell among them what were
for to do Brute and Corin yaf counsel and ordained that corin priualy should
goo out and bussh him in a wod til the morn So that in the morning when brute
should fight with his enymys Corin should cum with his folk in one side and sla
and do all the harm that he might And in amornyng in the dauyng of the day
Brute went out of the castle and^ faught with his enmys and they fersly
defendid bot with i^ a litell time brute and his folk slew viijC. of gofears
men. and then come Corin with the busshement and smot to ground he and his
compani all that would stond or a byed so that that king goffar and his comp^nye
war descomfited and fast they gun to fle. And Brute and Corin with there
company fersly them persoed and killed moo of them in the fleyng than they did
in batell And in this manner Brut had the victory and nertheles brute made much
sorrow for his cosyn Turin that there wos slain and other also that he had lost
of his men that is to say vijC. and xv. the which nobulli he let entier in the
some castle of Tours there where that he had entyred Turin his cosyn.

How Brute arrived at Totnesse in the I Will of Albion. and of the batell that wos
by tuix Corin and Gogmagog.
WHen all this wos done Brute would no longer there duel for to fight nor for to
lose no mo of his pepull For king Goffarus pepull mygth every day encresse mo
and mo And bruttes lassenned and therefore he took all his men and went un to the sea and had wynd and weder at there will. And the fyfte day afterwaard they
arrived in an haven at Totnesse and comen in to the I Will of Albion and there
nether man nor woman as the stori tells the fond: but Geautes and they woned in
hillis and in caves. and^ Brut saw the land wos fair and at his likyng and wos
good also for him and for all his pepull as Diane the goddess had him behight.
And there wos brute wonder glad and late assemble upon a day all his folk to
make a solempnie sacrifice and a great fest in honor and reuerens of Diane the
goddess of the which he had counsel first for to cu^ in to this land And when
that they had thar solempnite done: as they upon a day sat at there mete there
come in upon them sodanly xxx. geantes and killed of brutes men xxx. Brute and
his men anon sturten up and fought with the geantes and killed them euerychone:
bot one that was called Gogmagog: and he was master of all the geantes and he
wos stronger and heyr than any of the other. And brute keped him for encheson
that he should wrestyll with Corin that was brutes man: for he wos gretter and
hyer than any of Brutes men from thee gredyl sted upward Gogmagog and Corin
under took there for to wrestyll: and so to gedre they went and wrestilled a
long time but at the last gogmagog held Corin so fast that he brake ij. ribbbes
of his side wherefore Corin wos sore angri and there he took gogmagog betwix his
arms and kest him down upon a roche so that gogmagog brak all to pieces and^
so he died an evil death and therefore the place is called yet un to this day the
faut of gogmagog And then after brute yaf all that cuntre un to Corin and there
corin called it after his name Cornwalle: and his men be called Cornwailles and
so should men of that contre be called for evermore And in that contre duelled
corin and his me^ and thee made tounes and^ houses and^ inhabited the land by
there own will.

How Brute made London and called this land britane and scotland Albyne and
Walis Cambir.
BRute and his me^ went forth and^ saw about in diverse places where yt they
might find a good place and couenabull yt they might make a Cite for him and
for his folk So at the last they come by a fair River that is called temys
and there Brute biganne a fair Cite and let call it new Trey in mind and
remembrance of the great Troy from the which place all theer lineage was comin And
this brute let fell down wodes and let erye and saw lands and let maw down
medoys for sustena^ce of him and also of his pepull: and he departed the land
to them so that euerychon haad a part and a certain place for to duel in And
then Brute let call all this land Bretene after his own name and his folk he
let call bretons And this Brut had gote^ on his wife Gennogen iij. sonnys that
war worthy of deeds the first wos called Lotrin ye secund Albanac and the thread
kambar And brute bore croune in the cite of new Troy.xx. year after ye time
that the cite was made: and there he made the laws that ye bretons holden And
this brut wos wonderly well beloved among all men: And brute sonnys also loved
wonderly well to gedeer And when brute had sought all the land in length and^
also i^ breyd he found a land that Iuned to bretane yt wos in the north and
that land brute yaf to albanac his son and let call it Albanie after his name
yt now is called Scotland And brute fond an other contre toward the west and
yaf yt to Cambar his other son and let call it Camber after his name and now it
is called walys. and when brute had reigned.xx. year as be for is said then he
died in the cite of new Troy.

How Lotrin that wos brute son entroed with much honor and governed the land
well and worthily
AFter Brute reigned Lotrin his son that wos the secund king in bretane the which
be gane to regne the secund year of Samuel. and this lotrin wos croned king
with much solemnite of all the land of bretane and after when he wos croned
king Albanac and Cambar his.ij. brether went a gayn i^ to there own contre and
there they lived with mekyll honor and worship. and Lotrin there brother reigned
and was king and governed it well and wyseli: for he wos a good man and
wonderly well beloved of all his land And it be fell so that Albanac duelled in
his own land with mekell hoonour and worshipe: and then come king Humbar of
Hunlond with a grett pouer and arrived in albine and would have conquered the
land and by gone to were upon king Albanac and him killed in batell. when
albanac wos slain the pepull of yt land fled un to Lotrin and told him for he
wos king of bretan how that his brother wos slain and prayed him of his help
and of his socour for to a venge his brother death.

Lotrin there anon let assemble all the bretans of kent of dover in to derewent
of Norfolk and Southfolke of keftefen and lyndessey and when they war all
ensembled they sped them fast to ward there enmys for to yef them batell. and
lotrin had sent to Camber his brother that he should come un to him with all
thee pouer that he might make him for to help. and so he did with a good will
and so they come to gedres and took there way preualy for to go and seche Humbar
where they might him find.

And so it befell yt this Humbar wos by side a water yt wos a great reuer with
his folk him for to disport and there come Lotrin and Cambir his brother with
all there folk sodanly or that any of that other wist And when Humber saw them
cu^ he wos sore adrad For as much as his men wist it not before: and also they
were un arrayed And anon Humber for dread he lepyd i^ to the water and drenched
him self and so he died and his men were all slain that none of them ascaped:
And thefor is that water called Humbar and evermore shall be for be cause that
this king Humbar there in was drenched.

And after that Lotrin went to his shippis and took there gold and silver and os
much as he fand un to him self and all that other pylfre he gaf un to other
folk of the host and they fond in one of the shippis a fair damysell that wos
king humbars daughter and she wos called Estrild And when Lotrin saw her he
took her with him for her fayrnes* and for her wos over taken with love and^
would have wedded her. This tidi^ges come to Corin and anon he thought to
aueuge him upon lotrin Far os much as Lotrin had made counand for to spouse
Corins douhhter that was called Guentolen And corin in have went to him un to
new Troy and thus he said to Lotrin. now certes quod he ye reward me full
evil for all the pains that I have suffered and had money times for Brute your
fadre: and therefore sen that it is so I will a uenge me now upon you and he drew
his fauchon an hight and would have slain this Lotrin the king but the damisell
went by tweyn them and made them acorded i^ this manner: that Lotrin should
spouse guendolen that wos Corins daughter And so Lotryn did And nertheles when
that he had spoused Guentolen Corins daughter preualy he come to Estrilde and
brought her which child and^ gate upon her a daughter the wych was called Abren
And hit befell so that anon after that Corin dyed: and after when he was deid
Lotrine for soke Guendolen that wos his wife. and made Estrilde queen. And there
guentolen that was his wyffe went from thens all in great ire and wroth un to
Cornwaill and there seized all the land in to her own hond: for as much as she
was her fadres eyr: she under took feautes and homages of all the men of the
land and afterward assembled a great host and a great pouer of men for to be a
venged upon Lotrin that was her lord: and to him come and yaf him a strong
batell: and there wos Lotrin her hosband slain and his men discomfited in the v.
year of his regne. Guentolen let take Estrile and Abram her daughter and bynd
them b^the h^nd and^ fete and^ kest them both in to a water and so they
drenched wherefore that water was ever more called after Abram after thee name of
the damysell that was Estrildis daughter: and englyssh men calls that water
seuern and walsh men callis it Abram un to this day And when this was done
Guentolen let croune her queen of all the land: and^ governed the land full
well and wisely un to the time that Madan her son that Lotrin had gotten upon
her were of xx. year of age that he might be king: and so the queen reigned xv.
year: and tho let she croune her son king and he reigned and governed the land
well and worthily And she went in to Cornwall and there she duelled all her
life's time.

How Madan reigned in pees all his life.
This Madan son to Lotrin reigned on the bretans xl. year The which be gone regne
the xv. year of Saull. And this Madan liffed in pees all his days. and got ij.
sonnys Me^pris and^ Maulyn. Then he dyed and lies at new Troy.

soke his own wife and used the sin of sodomye wherfo: almyghti god wos
greatly displesyd and wroth with him and vpan him took vengeance for be cause
of his wikkednes. For on a day as he went forth on huntyng in a forest there he
lost all his men that wos with him and wist not what he should done: and so he
went up and down him self alone and cried after his men bot they war gone and
there come wolfes anon and all to dreu him in pieces when he had rened xxiiij.

hem loved him most and^ best: for she that loved him best should best be married
and he axed of the first daughter how well she him loved. and she aunsuerd and^
said better then her own lyffe Now certes quod her fadre that is a great love
Then axed he of ye secu^d daughter how much she him loved and she said more
and passing all the creaturs in the world per ma foy quod her fader I ma no

tell you troth For I love you os I aught to love my fader and for to bring you
more in certain how I love you I shall you tell: as much as ye been worth so

done Leir by gone for to make much sorrow for encheson that his estate wos
empeired. and^ men had of him more scorn and despiet then ever they had before
wherefore he not wist for to done. and at the last thought that he would weind in
to Cornwaill to Rigan his other daughter And when he was come the Earl and his
wife that wos Leirs daughter him welcomed and with him made much Joy and the

xij. month that his daughter of him was weri and his company and her lord and
she: of him had great scorn and despitte: so thatt from xxx. knights they
brought un to.x. and afterward had he but.v. and so they left him nomo Than
made he sorrow ynouh: and said sore weeping Allas that ever he come in to yt
land and said yet had me better to have duelled with my first daughter And
anon he went thens to his first daughter a g^ne: bot ano^e as she saw him come
she suore by god and by his holy name and by as much as she might that he should
have nomo with him but one knight if he would there a bied Then begone Leir ayene
to weep and made much sorrow and^ said tho alas now to long have I leued that
this sorrow and myschefe is to me now fallen. for now am I pooer that su^ time
wos rich: bot now have I no friend ne kyn that me will do any good But when I
was rich all me^ me honored and worshipped and now every man has of me
scorn and^ d^spite. and now I wot well that Cordeill my youngest daughter said
me trought when she said as much as i had so much should i beloueid and all the
while that i had good so long wos i loved and honored for my riches: but my
two doughtres glosed me tho. and now of me they set litell pris and soth told
me Cordeill bot i would not believe it ne vndiyrstond and therefore i let her go
fro me as a thing that i set litell pris of: and now wot i never what for to
done since my ij. doughtre have me thus dissaiued that i so much loved: and now
most i needs seche her that is in an other land that lyghly i let her gone fro
me with out any reward or yeftes and she said that she loved me as mich os she
aght to love her fader by all manner of reason and tho i should have axed her
no more: and tho that me other wise behightyn through tber falls speech now have
me desauid: in this manner Leir long time began to make his moan and at the last
he shop him to the sea and passed over in to france and asked and aspied where
the Queen might be fond and men told him where she was And when he come to the
Cite that she was in preualy he sent his squire un to the queen to tell her
that her fadre wos comen to her for great neides And when the squire come to the
queen he told her every dele of her sustres from the beginning un to ye end^
Cordeill the queen anon took gold and silver plente and took it to the squire
in counsel that he should go and bear it un to her fadre and that he should go
in to a certan Cite and him array and wasshen and than cum ayene to her and^
bring with him an honest company of knights xl. at the leyst with there menye:
and than he should send to her lord the king and said that he were comen for to

to seek Claudius caesar the Emprour of Rome and there Armager him took: and
Claudius the emprour through concel of his romans that with him left a live made
pees with armager in this manner as ye shall here that is to say how that
Claudius the Emprour should give un to armager Gennen his fair daughter for to
have to wife so that this land fro that time forward should be in the empreurs
poer of rome upon such conueant that never afterward no Emprour of Rome should
take none other tribute of this land bot only feaulte and they were acorded And

wos martired under Damician the emprour. Titus son to vaspasianus wos emperor
this time. and reigned iij. year and he a bode still at jerusalem after the
aleccion of his fadre. and distrued the cite and killed there as the stori
says with batall and hungyr xiC.M. Iues and an C.M. he took. and sold xxx
for a penny. be cause they sold crist for xxx penys: and brought thens althing
that wos precious. and put them in his house at Rome which wos called Templum
pacis. bot now is that place fall down for the most perty: and all these great
Iuels be distributit to certa^ cherchis in Rome. This Titus was so full of
uertu that al men louyd him. so ferforth that they clepit him the most
delectabull of men. he wosfull liberal to all men in so much that he said
ofti^ times: that there should no man go fro an emperor with a heavy heart. bot he
should sumwhat have of his peticion. he would be sori that day in the which he had
granted no man ne no benefit. when that he wos deid eueri man that wos in Rome
weppyd for him as that they had lost there fadre.

Domycian brother to Titus reigned after hi^ xiiij year and v. months. first

persecucion after Nero against cristyn men: In the which persecucion John^ the
Euangeliste was exiled in to Pathius after the Emprour had put him in to an tun
of oil brinnyng and hurt him not. So this man was not the follower of his fadir
vaspasian ne his brother Titus. bot rather like Nero and his kynred. And for
these wicked conditions he wos slain in his own palace at Rome in xxvij. year of
his age Clemens a martyr wos pope ix. year and he succedid Cletus This Clemens

made the life of Martirs to be wreten be regions. and he made money bokys: he
ordant that a child should be confirmed as soon os it might manerly after it
was cristyned. and at thee last he was martired under Traian.

Nerua wos Emprour after Domician on year and ij. months. and when he was

to be keped. should be brokyn. by which mean sent John^ Evangelist wos lowsit
out of his exile and suffered to cum again to Ephase This man did a another thing
right commendabull. that he assined so wise a man as Traian wos to govern the
pepull after him Nota Traianus hyspanicus was Emprour xix. xere This Traia^

tidings come to Constantine the Emprour he was wonder wroth toward the earl

How Maximian that was the Emprours cosyn of Rome spoused Octauians daughter
and wos made king of this land
THis Octauian governed the land well and nobully but he had none heir saufe a
daughter that was a young child that he loved as much as his life: and for as
much thatt he waxed seek and wos i^ point of death and might no longer regne he
would have made one of his nepheus to have been king the which was a nobull knight
and a strong man yt wos called Conan meriedoke and^ he should have keped the
kings doghter and^ have married her when time had been but the lords of the
land would not suffer it but yaf her council to be married to sum high man of
great honor and than might she have all her lust And the co^sell of thee
Emprour Constantyne her lord. and at this counsel they accorded and chose tho
Cador of cornwaill for to wend to ye emperor for to do this message and^ he
took the way and^ went to rome and told the emprour this tydyng well and^
wisely and^ the emperor sent in to this land with him his own cosyn yt wos his
vnkyll son a nobull knight and a strong that wos called Maximian and he spoused
Octauians daughter and wos crouned king of this land.

How Maximian that wos the emprours cosyn conquered the land of Amorican and
yaf it to Conan meriedok.
THis king Maxmian become so riall that he thought to conquer the land of
Amarican for the great riches that he herd tell that wos in that land so that he
ne left man that wos of worthiness knight squire ne none other man that he ne
took with him to great damage to all the land for he left at home behind him no
man to keep the land bot took them with him fro this land xxxM knights that
were doughty menys bodies and went over i^ to the land of Amorican and thor slew
the king yt was called Imball and conquered all the land And when he had so
done he called Conan and^ said for as mich os king Octauian have made you king of
breto^ and through me ye werlett and distrobled yt ye were not king I give you
this land of amorican and you there of makes the king And for as much as ye
ben a Breton I will that this land have the same name and no more be called
Amorican but by called litell bretan. and the land fro whens we ben comen shall
be called much bretan And so shall men know that on bretan fro that other.
Conan meridok thanked him hendely and so wos he made king of little bretan. And
when all this was done Maximian went fro thens un to Rome and was tho made
Emprour after constantine and Conan meriedok duelled in little bretan with much
honor and there let ordand ij.M. plough men of the land for to erie the land to
harow it and for to sow it and ^effed hem richely after that they were. And for
as miche os king Conan and none of his knights ne none of his other pepull
would not take wyfes of the nation of france he tho sent in to great breten to
the Earl of cornwaill that men called Dionothe yt he should che^e through out all
this land xiM. of madens that is to say viijM. for the mean pepull and iijM.
for thee grettest lords that should them spouse. And when Dionoth under stood
this he made aco^mandement through out all the land of bretan and as money os the
no^bro come to he assemled to geder of maidens: for there wos no man that durst
withstonde his commandme^tes for as mich that all the land was take him to
ward and to keep to done all thing that him good liked And when these maidens
were assemled he let them cum be fore iym at London and let ordan for them
ships hasteli and^ os mich as the^ neded to that vyage and took his own
daughter that wos called vrsula: that wos the fairest creature thot any man
wyft and he would have sent her to king Conan that should have spoused her and^
made her queen of the land. but she had made preuali to god a vow of chastyte
that her fadre not wist ne no other man else that wos leuyng upon ethr.

How vrsula and xi.M. maidens that were in her company went toward litell bretan
and all they were martired at Coloyn
THis vrsula chose un to her company xi.M. maidens that of all other she wos
lady and mastresse and all they went in to shipp at on time in the water that
is called thamse and commanded her kyn and all her frendis to almighty god. and
sailed toward litele breton. bot when they were comen in to the high see a
strange tempaste arose as it wos goddis will. and vrsula with her ships and her
company were driven to Hundland through tempast and arrived in the haven of the
cite of Colonie. and the king of the land that wos called Gowan was tho in the
cite: and when he wist the tyding that so money faier maidens were there arrived.
he took Elga his brother and other of his household with hi^ and went to the
shippis to se that fair company and when he saw the^ so fair he and his
company would have ouerlayne them and^ a take fro them there maydenhod but
vrsula that good maid concelled prayed warned and taught them that were her
fellows that the should defend them with all there might and rather suffer death
than suffren there bodi to be diffoylled So that all tho maidens become so
steadfast in god that they defended them through his grace so that no^e of them
had pouer to do them shame Wherfer the king Gawan wax sore anoyed yt he for
wroth slew them euericho^ ano^e right and^ sower all tho maidens martred for
the love of god and lies at coloyn

How king Gowan come for to destruy this land and how a man of great power thot
wos called Gracian defended the land.
WHen all this wos done king Gowan that wos a Sarazen called his brother Elga
and said to him that he should go to conquer the land that all tho fair maidens
were in borne. And he ordened tho a great pouer of Pehites of denmark of orkenay
and of norway and they come in to this land and brenttounes and^ slew folk
and^ cast a down chirches and houses and^ relegio^ and robed the land in
length and^ breed and^ put to death all tho that would not forsake the right
believe and cristyndom For as mich os there wos no souerayn that moght them
help. For the king Maximian had taken with him all the worthi men when he went
to conquer litell kretan And in the same time that ye here now tell was sent
Albone martired through the woed tyrant Dioclician in the same place where is now
an abbaye made of sent Albone whiles yt he wos apaynem But he converted hi^ to
god through the predicacio^ of a clarke and a wise man yt was called ancibell
that wos herbored a night in his house And this was after the Incarnacion of
Ihu^ crist. ijC.xxvi. year: and me^ should understand that sent albone suffered
his martirdo^ be fore that sent Edmu^de wos martired. and therefore is sent
albone called the first marter of England. This Gowans brother and^ his folk yt
were sarazenes went through out the land and^ destrued all thing yt they found
and^ no thing they spayred. when this tydyng come to rome how that king Gowan
had begone for to stroye this land the Emperor and tho of rome sent a strong
man and^ of great pouer yt wos called gracia^ with xxiiijM. men well fighti^g
for to cast out those sarezenes of this land. and all they arrived at ports
mothe. Maximian might not cu^ him self for as much os he wos chosen Emperor
after the death of Constantine that wos sent Elene son When this gracian wos
arrived with his host he let a spi preueli where the king gowan might befounde and
he upon him sodanli as they lain there beds and descomfited hi^ and^ slew them
i^ there beddis euerichone that none of them ascaped safe gowan that fled with
much sorrow in to his co^tre Sone after it befell yt Maximian wos slain at Rome
through treson And when Gracian wist that tydyng he let croune him king of this
land.

How gracian made him king when Maximian was slai^ and afterward the bretons
killed him for his wikkednesse.
THis Gracian when he begone to regne he become so wikked and so stern and so
much sorrow did to the bretons yt they slew hi^ among them Tho king gowan had
understand that gracian was slain and done to death he assembled a great pouer
and^ come ayene i^ to this land. and if he had first done harm tho did he much
more: for tho destrued he all this land and ye criste^ pepull yt wos i^ much
bretan so yt no man wos so hardi for to nempne god and^ he yt so did ano^e he
was put to strange death But the bishop of london that wos tho yt was called
gosselin escaped and went thens to them of Rome to sech socour to help to destru
the sarazenis yt had destruyed this land And ye romans said yt they had be so
often annoyed for there sendyng after folk i^ to bretan all for to help the
bretens and they would no more so do And so the bishop gosseline went the^s with
out any socour or help And tho went he to the king of litell bretan yt was
called Aldroie and^ this was the third king after gowan meriedok as be for is
said The bishop prayed this king Aldroie of help and socour And the king had
pit in his heart when he herd how the bishop fled and^ how that the cristyn
men were so slain in great Bretan through the paynems and sarazenes he granted
him Constantine his brother him for to help with pouer of folk and them did
array horse armur and ships and all thing that them neded to that viage And
when all thing was ready he called the bisshope and^ to him said I take you
heir to help and^ socour Constantine my brother upon this couenaut that if god
yef hi^ grace ye paynems and^ ye sarazenes to shend and discomfited that than
ye make him king: And the bishop it grauntid with good will Constantine and^
the bishop took lefe of the king Aldroye and^ betoke him to god and took there
men xijM. and went to there ships and sailed toward great bretan and arrived at
totnesse When the Bretans herd the tidings yt to them come socour they were
strongly helped and^ ordained them a huge nombre of pepull and come to them and
vnderfenge hem with mekyll honor. Gowan anon as he wist of this things he
asemled all the sarezenes and come ayenest them and yaf them batal and
Constantine slew him with his own hondes and all tho other sarazenes were
discomfited and slain that no^e of them asscaped but tho that were converted un
to god.

How Constantine that was the kings brother of litell briton wos crouned king
of myche breton for his worthenes.
Anon after the bataill they went to london and crouned there constantine and
made him king of this land and the bishop Goselin set the croune on his
heed and annoyntid him os it befalls for a king to been and tho bigan
cristyndom ayene i^ this land and ano^e this king constantine when he wos
creuned anon after he spoused his wife through counsel off the bretons and he
begat iij. sonnys on her The frist wos called Constance and that other
Aurilambros and the third vter: this Constance the Elder brother when he come
to age he made him a monk at wynchestre. This Constantin there fadre through
tresone wos slain For it befell on a time that a Pehite come to him upon a day
in message as it were. and said that he would speak with the king preuali in
council The king let voied his chamber of the men that there were withyn and
there a bode no mo bot the king and the Pehite and^ he made a countinance as tho
he would have spoken with ye king i^ his ere and there he killed him with a long
knyfe and after that he went quai^teli out of the chamber in to an oder chamber
so at the last no man wist where he wos bicomen When the kings men wist that
there lord wos so deid they made so much sorrow they not wist what to done For as
myche as his.ij. sons Aurilombros and vter were so young that no^e of them
might be king and the third brother wos monk at wenchestre as is said befoor
But vortiger that wos Earl of westsexe thought priuyly in his heart through
que^tance to be king and went to wynchestre there that Constance was monk and^
to him said Constans quod he your fadre is deid and your ij. brethren that been with Gosseline the bisshope of london to norissh: ben so young that none of
them may be king Wherefore I council you that ye forsake your habit and come
with me and^ I shall make sych a meyn un to the bretons that ye shall be made
king.

Of Constans yt wos king Constantine son that was monk at wynchestre and how
he wos made king after his fadres death through consell of vortiger that wos Earl
of westsexe for as mich as Aurilambros and vter his ij. brether were but young of
age: And vortiger let sle him to be king him self.
THis vortig^r consceled this Constance so much till he forsook his Abbot and
went with him: and anon after he wos crouned king by assent of the Bretons.

This king Constance when he wos crouned and made king he wist ne knew bot
litell of the world na could no thing wat knyghthod axed. and he made vortiger
his chief mastir and conceller and yaf him all his pouer for to ordeyne and to
do as much as to the reame apertened So that him self no thing entermelled but
only bare the name of king When vortiger saw that he had all the land in his

sore anoyd. And i^ an other place also tidings come to hi^ that Aurilambros
and vter his brother ordined and assembled a great host for to cum in to mekell
bretan yt is to say in to this land to be avenged upon Constance there brothers
death So that i^ on half and in that other he was brought in to so much sorrow
that he ne wist whider to wend.

How Engist and.xi. thousand men come in to this land to the whom vortiger yafe
a place that is called Thongcastell
ANd sone after this sorrow tydyng come to vortiger yt a great nauye of
strangers were arrived i^ the cu^tre of kent he wylt not whens they were ne
wherefore they were come in to this land The king sent anon a messenger thider
that sum of them should cum and speak with him for to wit what folk they were and
what they axed and i^ to what cu^tre they would goo There were ij. brether masters
and^ princes of yt strong company yt on wos called Engist and yt other Horse
Engist went to the king and told him the encheson wherefore they were comen i^ to
his land And said sir we be of a cuntre that is called Saxony that is the
land of Eermayne where in is so much sorrow that of the pepull be so money that
the land may not them sustain And the masters and princes that have the land

And so they shul them yef horse and hernes armuri and^ all thing that them

king if ye have ought to do with our company we be come in to your land and^
with good will you will serve and your land keep help and defend from your enmys
if that ye needs. When vortiger herd this tydyng he said he would gladly them
withold upon sich covenant if they might dalyuer his land of his emnys he would
yef them resenable lands where they should duel for ever more Engist thonked
goodly and^ in this manner he and his company xiM. should duel with the king
vortiger and much they did through there boldness they delivered the land clean of
his emnys Tho prayed Engist the king of so mo^h land that he might make to him
a cite and^ for his meny The king ansuerd. it wos not to done with out conceill
of his bretons. Engist prayed him eftsoon of as much place os he might compass
so with a thonge of a skyn where upon he myhht maake a manner for him to duel
on. And the king him granted freely Tho took engist a bull skyn and cut it as
small as he might all in to on thuong all a round and there with compassed he os
much land as he had upon a fair castle and when this castle was made he let
call it Thwong castle For as much as the place wos marked with a thwong.

Of Ronewen that was Engistes daughter and how the king vortiger spoused her
for her bowte.
WHen this castle was made and full well arrayed Engist preualy did send by
letter in to the cuntre where he come fro after an hondreth ships fyllid with
men that wos strong and bold and also well fightyng in all batellis. and that
they should also bring with them Ronewen his daughter that wos the fairest
creature that a man might se And when those pepull wos come^ that he had sent
after he took them in to the castle with much Joy And him self upon a dey went
un to the king and prayed him there worthily that he would cum and see his new
manner that he had made in the place that he had compassed with a thuong of the
skyn The king anon granted him freely and with him went thider and^ wos well a
paid with the castle and^ with the fair work. and to geders there they eten
and dronk with much joy And when night come that the king vortiger should go i^ to
his chamare for to take there his nyghtes rest: Ronewen that wos Engist daughter
come with a cup of gold i^ her hand and kneled be fore the king and said to
him wassaill. and the king wystnot what it wos to mean ne what he should ansuer
for as much as him self ne none of his bretons coud no english speak ne under
stond it: but spekyn in the same longage that bretons done yet. Neutheles a
latimer told the king the full understanding thereof wassale: and that other
should ansuer drynk haill. And that wos the first time that wassaill and drink
haill come up in this land. and from that tym un to this time it is well used
in this land.

The king vortiger saw the fairnes of Ronewen and his arms laid a bowt her nec
and iij. swetly kytsed her. and anon right he wos a namered vpan her: that he
desired to have her to wif and asked of Engist her fadre And Engist granted him
upon this covenant that the king should yef him all the cu^tre of kent that thhe
er might duele in and his pepull The king him granted preuely with a good will
and anon after he spoused ye damysell. and yt wos much confusion to him self.
And therefore all the bretons become so wroth for be cause he spoused a woman of
mysbeleue. wherefore they went all from hi^ and^ nothing to him took keep ne help
him in thing that he had to done.

How vortimer that wos vortigers son was made king and^ Engist wos driven out.
and how vortimer wos slain.
THis Engist went in to kent and seized all the land in to his hond for him and
for his men and by come in a lityl while of so great pouer and so much pepull
had that men wist not in little time which were the kings men and wych were
Engist men wherefore all Bretons had of him dred and said among them bot if
that they ne took other counsel be twen he^ all ye land should be betrayed
through Engist and his pepull vortiger ye king had be gotten on his first wife
iij. sonnys the first wos called vortimer yt secu^d Catagren and the third
Passent. The britons euerychon by on asse^t chose vortimer to be there lord and
sovereign and counceller i^ every bataill and crouned hi^ and^ made hi^ king
and^ would suffer vortiger no longer to regne for encheso^ of the aliance bituix
engist and^ hi^. The brito^s ordined a great host to drive out engist and his
company of the land and^ yaf hi^ iij. batallis yt first wos i^ Kent there he
wos lord The secu^d wos at Tetford. and^ the third i^ a shire athis half Cooll
i^ a more. And i^ this botell them met Catagren and^ horn Engistes brother so
that ych of them slew other. Bott for as much os the cu^tre wos yef long by for
to horn through vortiger. tho he spoused his cousin there he made a fair castle
that is called horncastel after his own name And vortimer wos so annoyed for
his bred death catagre^ yt he wos deid i^ sich a manner. Wherefore ano^e he let
fell ye castle to gronde And after yt he ne left night ne day till he had
driven out engist and all his pepull of ye la^d and^ when Engist wos driven a
way Ronewen his daughter made sorrow y now and quentely spek to them yt were
next ye king vortimer and priueyst with hi^. and so much she yaf hi^ of yeftes yt
he wos enpoisened and^ died at london the iiij. year of his regne and there he
lies.

How the breto^s chose an other time vortiger to be there king and^ Engist come
in to this land and they fouhten to gedre.
AFter vortimers death the. Britons by her commune asse^t eft sons made
vortiger her king upon this convenient that he should never after suffer Engist
ne none of his. eftsoon to come i^ to this land And when all this wos done
Ronewen the queen preuely sent by letter to Enegist that she had enpoisend
vortimer and^ that vortiger her lord ayene bare the croune and^ rened and that
he should come in to this land well arraied with much pepull for to a venge hi^
upon the britons and to win this land ayein: And when Engist herd this
tidings he made great Joy and apparelled him hastily with xv. thousand men yt
were doughty in every bataill and come in to this land And when vortiger herd
tell that engist was come ayene with a grett pouer in to this lond^ he assemled
his bretons and tho went ayens engist for to have yef him bataill and his
folk. Butt Engist drad him sore of the Bretons For they had driven him beforne
and discomfited him with strength wherefore this engist prayed him a love day.
and^ said he wos not cu^yn in to this la^d for to fight. but for to have his
land again if he might accord with the bretons and of them to have luffe and grace
The king vortiger through counsel of his bretons granted a love day and thus
it wos ordained through the bretons. that the saame day should be holdin fast be
side Salisberi upon an hill. And engitt should come thidre with iiij. hundredth
knyghtys with out mo: And the king with as money of the wisest men of his land
And at yt day the king come with his counsel as it wos ordined but Engist had
warned his knyghtys preualy and them commanded that every of them should put a
long knyfe in his hosyn. and when he said fair sers now is time to speak of
love and pees every man a none should draw out his knyfe and sle a breton and so
they killed a thousand lxi. of knights and with much sorrow money of them
ascaped And the king vortiger there him self tho wos taken and lad to
Thongcastell and put in to prison: and sum of Engistes men would that the king
had been brent all quyke. And vortiger tho for to have his life granted them as
much as the would axe and yaf up all the land tounes Castelles cites and
brughes to Engist and to his folk And all the bretons fled thens in to wales
and^ there they held them still. And Engist went through the land and seysed all
the land with fraunchisos and i^ every place let cast a down chirches and^
houses of religione and^ destruid cristi^dom through out all this land and^ let
change the name of the land: that no man of his were so hardy after yt tym to
call this land britan but call it Engist land and^ he deperted all the land to
his men and there made vij. kings for to strenght the la^d that the bretons
should never cu^ after there i^ The first kingdom wos kent there that Engist him
self reigned and wos lord and^ master over all the other The other king had
southsexe that now is chichestre. The third king had westsexe. The iiij. king
had Estsexe The v. king Estangill that now is called Northfolk Southfolk
Merchemerich that is to say the Erldom of Nicholl The vi. had Lecestre shiere
Northhamto^ shiere. Hertford and Huntyngdon The vij. had Oxunford Gloucestre
Wynchestre Warwik and Derbyshire.

How vortiger went in to wales and bigan there a castle that would not stond
with out mortar tempred with blod.
WHen Engist had deperted all the land in this manner between his men and
delivered vortiger out of prison and suffered him freely to gone whidre that he
would and he took his way and went in to wales there that is bretons dulled for
as much as that land was strong an wekked to win And Engist never come there ne
never know it before yt land. vortiger held him there with his breta^s and axed
concell what hi^ wos best to do And they yaf hi^ concell to make a strong
castle yt he might hi^ self there i^ keep and^ defend if need were Maso^s i^ have
tho were fet and^ bigan the werk upon ye hill of Breigh. but certes thus it be
fell all the werk yt ye maso^s made a day down it fell the night and^ they wist
not what it might be there of the king wos soro anoyed of that chance and wist
not what to done Wherefore he let send after the wisest clerkis and also learned
me^ yt were through out wales that might be found. for they should him tell what
wos best to done. For they should tell wharfor the foundment so failed under the
work and that they should him tell what wos best for to done And the wisest men
long time had studied they said to the king that he should done seek a child
borne of a woman that never had with man to done and that child he should sle
and temper with his blod the mort of the werk and so should the work ever
endure with out end.

How the king let sech Merlin through out all wales for to speak with him.
WHen the king herd this he commanded his mesangeres anon to wend through out
all wales to seek that child if he might him find. and that they should him
bring forth with the^ un to him and in record and in witness of this thing he
had tak them his lettres that they ne were destrobled of no man ne let. And
tho the messangeres went thens and sped so fast thatt they come in to a town
that was called Karmardine and os they passed forth there way they funden ij.
child of xxiiij. year age chydi^g yf^re with hasty words. and on of them said
to that other Donebat quod he ye do all wrong to chide or strife with me. For
ye have no wit ne no reso^ as I have. Certes Merli^ quod he of your wit ne your
reason I make no force for me^ tell conminly that ye have no thing of god
almygfty since ye had never fadre but every mau knaweth well who was your mother
The messingers of the kings vortiger when they herd this strife be tuix the
tow gromes they axed of them that stood besides them whens that Marlyn wos
borne and also who him norisshed and the folk hem told that a great gentle
woman him bare in Karmardi^e that wos called Adhan. but never might man wit who
was his fadre When the kings messangeris herd this tydyng they went anon to
him that wos wardayne of the town and toold him the kings will and his letter
showed him wherefore they were comen theder. Merlyn and his mother anon were sent
be fore the wardayne of the town and he commanded them that they should gone to
the king as it wos ordand by his massengers Merlyn and his mother went thens
and^ come un to the king and^ there they were vnderfonge with much honor and the
king axed of that lady if that child were her son and who hi^ begat The lady
ansuered full tendirly weeping and said she had never company of man worldly
But sir quod she os I wos a young maiden i^ my faders chamber and other of great
lineage were in my company: yt often times wont to play and solace. I beleft
allone in my chamber and would not gone forth for byrnyng of the sone And on a
time there come a fair bachelar and^ entrid in my chamber there that I was
allone. but how he come in to me: and where I wist it never ne yet wot it not
For the doors were fast barred and with me he did game of love For I ne had
might ne pauer him to defend fro me. and^ often he come un to me in the fore
said manner so that he begot this child: but never might I wit what he was

Of the ansuere of merlin wherefore the king axed whi his castille might not
stond that he had be gonne ner prove.
WHen Merlin had herd all that his mother had said he spoke to the king in this
manner. Sir how I wos begoten ax ye no more. for it falls not to you ne to
no^e other to wit but tells me the encheson wherefore I am to you brought and
wherefore ye have sent after me. Certis quod the king my wise cowncelers have
done me to understand that the mort of a work that i have be gone behooves to
be tempred with your blod or the foundame^t shall faill for ever more^ Sir quod
Merlin will ye sle me for my blod to temper with your mort. ye quod the king or
else shall never my castle stand as my councelars done me to understand Tho
ansuerd merlyn to the king Sir he said let them cum by fore me tho wise
concelers and I will preue that they say not well ne trewly. And when the wise
me^ were com Marli^ axed if his blod were the encheson to make the work stand
and endure All those wise were abashed and coud not ansuer Merlyn tho said to
the king Sir I shall you tell the encheso^ wherefore your work thus faleth and^
may not thand. There is under the montayn there that ye have belden your tour a
great pond of water and in ye botom of ye pond under the water there is.ij.
drago^s yt on is white that other reed yt fighten to gods ayens your work Do
ye mine deep till your men come to the pond and does your men take a way the
water all out and then ye shall se the dragons as I have you told that to geder
fighte^ ayens your work And this is the encheson where fore the fundament
faleth The king anon let dig under til yt me^ come to yt pond and^ let done
a way all yt water and there they fond ij: dragons as Marlyn had them told that
egorly foughten to geders. The white dragon egrely assailed the reed and^ laid
on hi^ so strongly yt he might not endure bot with drew him and rested i^ ye
same cave. And when he had a while restyd him he went before and^ assailed ye
reed dragon angrely and held hi^ so sore yt he might not ayens hi^ endure but
with drew hi^ and restid And after come again ye white dragon and strongly
fought with the reed dragon and bote him evil and him overcome that he fled from
thens and no more come again.

Off the syngnificacion of thas.ij. dragons thot were in thee bottom of the
ponde that foughten to gedre.
THis king vortiger and his men that saugh this battle had great meruell and
prayed Merlyn to tell him what it might betoken Sir quod Merlin I shall you
tell. The reed dragon betokens yourself and the white betokens the folk of
Saxony that first ye took and held in your land thatt fightten ayens you and
you have driven and enchaced. But bretons of your lineage over comen them and
driven them a way and sithen at the coming ayene of the saxons they recovered
this land and held it for ever more and driven out the britons and did with
this land all there will and destruyed cristi^do^ thurght out this land. Ye had
first joy with there cu^mynge but now it is turned to you great damage and sorrow
For tho. ij brethern of Constance that wos king the which ye let sla. Shall cum
by for a quinzeme passed with a great pouer from litell breto^ and shul a venge
the death of there brother and^ they shall brin you first with sarow And
afterward they shall sle a great part of Saxons and^ shall drive out all the
remenant of the land and^ therefore abyed ye here no longer to make castle ne
none other work bot anon go else where your life all for to save. to god I you
by take treuth I have said to you of things that shall be fall. And
understand ye well that Aurilanbros shall be king bot he shall be enpoysened
and litell time shale he regne.

Of king Aurilambros how that he pursued vortiger and Engist and how they diden.
MErlen and his modre deperted from the king and turned again to Karmardine. And
sone after tidings come to the bretons that Aurilambros and^ vter his brother
were arrived at Tottenesse with a great host. And anon thee Bretons assemled them
and went to vnderfonge Aurilambros and^ vter with great nobulnes and had them un
to london and croned aurilambros and made him king and did un to him humage And
anon he axed where vortiger that was king might be founden for he would be
avenged of his brother death and after he would were upon paynems And they told
him that vortiger was in wales and so they lade him thiderward. vortiger wist
well that tho brether come hi^ to conquer and fled thens i^ to a castle that
wos called Gerneth that stood upon an high mantayn and there him held^.
Aurilambros and vter his brother and there folk had beseged the^ castle full
long time for the castle was strong and well arrayed So at the last they kest
wildfyre and brent houses and men and all there array and os much os was with in
the castle. So that vortiger was brent among all other and so he died with
much sorrow. Tho was Engist in Kent and reigned there and hard this tydyng and
anon fled and^ would have gone in to Scotland for to have had socour. But
aurilambros and his men met with him i^ the northcuntre and yaf him bataill and
Engist and his men defended whiles that they might. but he and^ his folk were
discomfited and^ slain. and O^ta his son fled un to york. and Aurilambros him
foloed egrely and Otta a litell while ayens him stod. but afterward he put him
to his merci. And arilambros vnderfeng hi^ and^ to him and to his men yaf the
cuntre of galeway i^ Scotlond and there they duelled The king arilambros went
through out ye land and put away the name of Engistland that engist after his
name had called it before Tho let he it call again great bretan and let make again
chirches houses of relegion Castelis cites and burghes and^ tounes that the
Saxons had destruyed and come to london and let make the walls of the cite
which Engist and his folk had casten down. The bretons lad him to the mount of
Anbrian some time was an house of religion that tho wos destruyed through
paynyms. Where of a knight that was called Anbry that some time wos found of the
house and therefore the hill wos called the mount of brian and after it wos
called Ambresbury and shall so be for evermore.

How Aurilambros did redress the land of great Bretan that was destrayed through
the Saxons.
HOw the king aurilambros let a me^d and^ redress the house of Amlesburi and
there in put monks but now there bennonnys a littell from the plaace that wos
called Salisburi there that the Saxons killed the Bretans where Engist and he
should have made a love day i^ which time there were slain a.M.lxi. knights through
treson of engist. The king thereof had great pit. and th^ught to make i^ mind
of them a monument of ston that might endure to ye words end. and of this
thing they took there counsel what there of wos best for to done. Tho spoke to
the king the bishop of london that wos called Ternekyn that he should enquere
after Marlyn. for he coud best tell how this thing might best be made^ and
merlin after wos sought and^ found and^ come to ye king And the king toold hi^
his will of the monument yt he would have made Tho ansuerd Merlin to the king
and^ said there been great stonys i^ Irland and^ long upon ye hill of kyan yt
me^ called Gea^ts karoll and^ if they were i^ this place as they be there. they
would endure for ever more i^ remembrance of thoo knights yt heir be entered
Per ma^oy quod the king as hard stones be i^ my land as i^ Irland Soth quoth
merlin But i^ all your land there be none soch For geantes set them for great
good of them self.

For at every time that they were woundet or i^ any manner hurt they wesshen the
stones with hot water and than they wesshe them there with and anoon they were
hole.

How the bretons went for to sech the great stons i^ Irland.
WHen these bretons had herd of this thing they went and swore among them that
they would gonne seche tho stonnes and took with them vter the kings brother to
be there cheftayn and. vM men and Merlin counseled them for to go un to Irland
and. so they diden. And when the king of Irland that wos called Guillomer herd
tell that strangers were arrived i^ his land he assembled a great pouer and^
fought ayens them. but he and his folk was discomfited The bretans went be for
till they come to the mount of Kylian and climed up un to the mount. But when
they saw the stones and the manner how they stood they had great meruell and
said bitwyn them self that no man should hem remeue for no strength ne engyne
so huge they were and so long But merlin through his craft he remeued them and^
brought them i^ to there ships and^ come ayene in to this land And merlin set
the stones there that the king would have them and set them in the same manner
that they stoden in Irland And when the king saugh that it was made he thanked
Merlyn and richeli him rewarded at his own will and that place let call
stonhenge for ever more

How Passent that wos vortigers sone and the king Guillomer come in to this
land and how a tratour that was called Cappa enpuysened the king Aurilambros.
ANd men shall under stand stat Passent that was vortigers sone leued in the
same time and come in to this land with a great pouer and arrived in the north
cuntre and would ben a venged of his faders death vortiger. And strongly trusted
upon the componye that he had brought with him out of the land of Germayne and
had conquered all the north cuntre un to york. And when king Aurilambros herd
this he assembled a great pouer of Bretons and went for to fight with passent.
and he wos discomfited and all his pepull. but passent ascapped the^s with sum of
his men and fled thens in to Irland and come to king Guillomer and prayed him
of help and socour. The king granted him with good will. and said that he would
help him upon yt covenant that I my self must gone with you with all my pouer
in to breton. and I would me a venge upon the Bretons rather for they cum in to
my land. and token the stones with strength that is called Geantes karoll. The
king guillomer let orde^ his ships and went to the sea with xv.M. men and
arrived in wales and be gone to rob and much sorrow did. Hit befell so that king
arilombros lay seek at wynchster and might not help him self So that he sent
in his name vter his brother with a pouer to help wales and thederward he went
as much os he might The king of Irland and Passent had herd tell that
Aurilambros was seek and to him there come a Sarizen that was called Coppa and
said Sir duel ye her all in pees with your host and^ I be hight you through my
quentize that I shall sle the king aurilambros that is seek. Then said Passent
if ye do so I shall you richely auaunce This ttoraur Coppa put upon him an
abbyt of Relegion and let shave him a brod croune and come un to the kings
court and said that he would help the king of his maladie^ Tho said the
tretour Coppa un to the king Sir ben of good comforth for I shall yef you sich
a medicin that ye shall sweet anon right and lusten to sleep and have good
rest and^ thee tratour yaf him sich poysin to slep anon right and died in his
slepyng. and ye trator said that he would gone out in to the feld till he were a
waked. and so scapped he a way. for no man had to him suspeccion for be cause
of his habbit that he wos in clothed and also for his brood shauynne croune.
but when the kings men it wist that he wos deid they become wondir sori and
fast sought the tratour But they might not find him. for that Coppa turned
ayene to the host fro whens that he come.

When Aurilambros was deid a sterre in the morn wos sei^ with a clear light
and at the bught of the beme wos seyne the head of an horribull dragon.

WHen the king Aurilambros wos thus deid and^ enpoysened at wynchester. on the
morn after that he wos deid a bowt the time of prime there was seyne a stere
great and clear and the beme of that stern wos brighter then the son and at the
bought of the beem a pered a drago^s heed and^ out of his mouth come ij. huge
lights that were as bright as any fire brennyng And that one beme toward france
and stryght over the sea thiderward. And out of that beym rome vij. bemes full
clear and long as it were the light fire This stern was seyn of money a man but
none of them wist wat it betokened vter that wos the kings brother yt wos i^
wales with his host of breto^s saw yt sterre and^ ye great light yt it yaf. he
wo^dred there of gretli what it might betoke^ and^ let call Merli^ and prayed
hi^ for to tell what it might betoken.

Of the betokenyng of the stere.
MErlin saw that star and^ beheld him long time and sithen he quoke and weped
tendirli And said alas alas that so nobull a king and worthy is deid. And I
do you to under stand that Aurilambros your brother is enpeysened and that I
se well i^ this sterre. and^ yourself is betoke^d by the heed of the dragon
that is sei^ at the bought of the beem. that is yourself that shall be king and^
regne And by the beem that stands toward the est is understood yt ye shall
get a son that shall conquer al france and all the lands yt belongs to the
croune of france that shall be a worthier king and^ of more honor than ever
wos any of his auncetours And by the beem that strechys toward Irland is
betokened that ye shall get a daughter that shall be queen of Irland. And the
vij. bemes betokene that ye shall have vij: sonnis and euerichon of them shall
be king and regne with much honor and abide ye no longer heir but goth and yef
bataill to your enmys and^ fight with them bodily for ye shall over cu^ them and
have the victori vter thanked hertely Merlyn and took his men and went toward
his enmy and^ they foughten to gedre mortali and so he discomfited his enmy and
them distroyed. And him self killed Passent that wos vortiger son And his
bretons killed Guillomer yt wos king of Irland and^ all his men. And vter anon
after that bataill took his way toward winchester for to done entere
Aurilambros king that wos his brother: But tho was the body borne to stonhe^ge
with much honor that he had done made in remembrance of the bretons that there
were slai^ through treson of Engist. that sam day that they should have been

host and come in to Cornwaill for to distruy the Earl if that he might. but he
had put him i^ sich a castle that was strong and well arrayed of Tyntagell and
would not yield him to the king. and the king anon beseged ye castle and there
duelled xv. days yt never might sped and ever thought upon Igerne and upon her

MErlyn through craft that he coud changed the kings figure i^ to the liknesse
of the Earl and^ vlfyn garlois his cha^berlayn in to the figure of jordan that
wos the Earls chambirlayn So that yche of them wos transfigured to oder
lekenesse. And when Merlyn had so done he said to the king Sir quoth he now may
ye go suddenly to the castle of Tyntagell and axen enter there and have your

he mich loved and took his way toward the castle and with hi^ took vlfy^ his

in bed yt wos the Earls wife. the kings men yaf a great assaut un to the
castle and the Earl and his men manli them defended But at the last it befell
so that in the same assaut the Earl him self wos slain and the castle taken.
And the king a none turned again to Tyntagell and spoused Igerne with much honor

How king vter chese Aloth to keep the land of breton whiles that he wos seek.
for as much as he might not for his seknes
ANd for as much as king vter wos seek and might not help him self he ordined
Aloth son of Eleyn that tho was chosen for to be wardeyn and cheftayn of all
his folk and so he anon and his bretans assemled a great host and yaf batell
to Otta and to his folk. but Otta at the last wos discomfitid Hitt befell thus
afterward that these bretons had dedignacion of Aloth and would not to hi^ be

cu^ out and^ yef batall to the king and so they did and^ i^ yt batall were both
Otta and Ossa slain. and all tho other yt ascapped a live fled i^ to scotland
and made Colegu^ there chyftayn. and^ the saxons that were on live and^ ascaped
fro the bataill brought ayan a great strength and emo^ges them they said. yt if
king vter were deid they should well co^quere ye land and among them they
thought to enposin the king and ordained me^ for to do this deed. and yaf them
of yeftes great plente this thing to done and they ordined hem thiderward there
yt the king was duelli^g and clothed hem i^ pouer wede the better all for to
sped therlyd purpose but nevertheless for all there falsnes and qua^tize they
might never cu^ to nyghthe king: But so at the last they aspied yt ye king

falls tratours upon a day preuali went to ye well and put theri^ poison so yt all
ye water was enpoysened. and ano^e after os the king had dronkyn of ye water he

brother and after turned again tho euerychone and send after Arthur his son and^
they made him king of the land with much reverence after his fadres death xvij.
year of his regne.

How Arthur that wos the son of vter was crouned after his fadre death and how
he drofe Colegrin and the Saxons and Cheldrik of almayne out of this land
WHen Arthur wos made king of ye land he wos bot young of age of xv. year. but
he wos fair and bold and doughty of body and to meke folk he wos good and
curtas and large off spendyng and made him wonderly well beloved among all men
there that it wos need. And when he begone to regne he swore that ye saxons
never should have pees ne rest till that he had driven them out of the land. and
assembled a great host and faught with Colegri^ the which after the time that Otta
wos deid the saxons mayntened. and this Colegrin wos discomfited and fled un to
york and took the town and there him held. And the king beseged hi^ there but
he might nothing sped. for the cite wos so strong. and they with in the town
kepped the cite well and orpedly. And in the meyn time Colegrin let the town
to Bladulf and fled him self to Cheldrik that wos king of Almayne for to have
of him socour and^ the king assemblid agret pouer and^ come and arrived in
scotlond with.v.C. shippis. and when arthur wist of this tidi^g that he had not
pouer and^ strength y nough to fight ayens Cheldk he let be the sege and went
to london and sent anon his letters to the king of litill bretan that was
called Hoel his nepheu his sustres son that he should cu^ to hi^ with all the
pouer yt he might and he assemblid a great host and arrived at southinton. And
when king arthur it wist he wos glad i nough and^ went ayens them and them
resaued with much honor so that those ij. hosts met and assembled them and
took there way even un to Nichol that Cheldrik had beseged but it wos not taken
And they come upon cheldrik and his pepull or they wist were yt they were and^
them egrely asseilled. The king cheldrik and^ his meny defe^did them ma^ly by
there pouer. but king arthur and his me^ killed so mo^ny saxons that never wos
seyne sich slaughter. And Cheldrik and^ his men yt were left a live fled a way.
And arthur them pursued and drove out them in to a wod that they might no
ferther pass Cheldrik and his men saw well that they were brought in to much
disese and^ them yold to arthur in this manner wise that he should take there horse
and there armur and all that they had they must only gone o^ foot in to there
shippis. and so they would gone home in to there own land and never cu^ again in
to this land. And upon assurance of this thing they yeuen him good hostag^s.
And arthur by counsel of his men granted this thing and resaued the hostages
and there upon the other went to there ships: And when they were in the hy see
the wynd changed as the deuell it would and they turned there navy and come a yen
to this land and arrived at Totnesse and went out of the ships and took the
land and clen robbed it and much pepull slew and taken all the armur that they
might find and so they went forth till they come un to Bathe. but the men of
the town shitte^ fast there yates and nold not suffer them to cum with in the
town and they defendit them well and orpedly ayens them.

How Arthur yaf bataill un to the Saxons when they com again i^ to this land
and^ beseged the town of bathe and^ them over come.
WHen arthur herd this tydyng he let hong anon the hostages and left Hoel of
bretan his nepheu for to keep the march toward Scotlond with half his pepull.
and him self went to help and rescu the town of Bathe and when he come theder
he yaf a strong bataill to Childrik and killed almost all the people that he
had^ for no man might him withstond ne endure under thee stroke of his swerd.
And there both were slain Colegrin and^ Bladud his brether And Cheldrik fled
thens and would have gone to his shippis. But when arthur it wist he took.x.M
knyghtis to Cador that was Earl of Cornwaill for to let and^ stop his cumming.
And arthur him self went toward the march of scotland. for messingers told hi^
yt the scottys had beseged Hoil of bretan there that he lay seek and therefore he
hasted him thederward And Cador pursued after Cheldrik and took him er he might
come un to his shyppis and killed Cheldrik and his pepull. And when Cador had
done this viage: he hasted hi^ again as fast os he myhht toward Arthur. and
fond him in Scotland there that he had rescued Hoel of britan. But the scottys
were fer with in Mounref. And there they held them a while but arthur them pursued
and^ they fled thens in to Lymoigne that were in thatt cu^tre lx. isles and great
plente of briddis and^ great plente of Egels that were woned to cry and fight to
geders and make great noise when folk come to rob that land and weren as much
os they might and so they did for the Scottis were so great rauenours yt they
took al yt they might fi^d i^ ye la^d of Lymoign with out any spari^g and there
with charged again the folk in to Scotland for to wend.

fast by there that king Arthur wos with his host and anon as he wist there of.
he went toward him. and yaf him bataill. and over come him anon right. and
guyllomer fled with his men again in to irland. And when this was done and^ he
discomfited Arth^ turned him again there that he wos in to the place there that he
had left the Scotys and would have them all slain. But the bisshoppes abbotes
and other folk of the cuntre and ladies open heed co^ before king arthur and
cried him mercy and said sir gentill king and mighty have mercy and pytte upon
us. And os your self be of the right law to hold and maynten cristindom. for
full great dishonor it should be to kill them that believes in al^ mighty god as
ye done and for goddis love have mercy and pytte of us: and suffer us for we
have had much sorrow and pyne for the Saxones has money time passed through our
land. bot that is not enough to you for often times they have us done serow and
disese. For our casteles they have taken and our bestes slain and eten. and
much harm they have us done: and if ye would us now kill hit were no honor to a
king to kill them that cries him mercy. For enough ye have done to us and has
us ouercu^myn and for the love of god that ye will suffer us for to life and^
haueth merci of criste^ people yt beleuen i^ crist os ye do when king arthur
herd this sorrow he had pytte of them. and yaf them liyfe and lym with out any
more harm. and they fell down to his fete and^ than kyd him and become his

And tho yaf he all loegers to Aloth that had spoused his sustre and other
yeftes great plente and tho was Gawen his cousin bot of young age and to all his
other men that him had seruid in his were he yaf rich yeftes. and he thanked

WHen Arthur had brought his land in pees and rest and in good state and all
wos well in every cuntre. tho took he and^ wedded a wife that was called Gu^nor
and^ made hirquene a fair lady and a gentill that Cador the earl of Cornwaill
had norisshid in his chamber that wos his own cousin but never they had child to

winter was passed he let assemble agret host and all his barons. and said that
he would wend in to Irland for to conqure the land: and^ he tarried not long that
he ne passed over in to Irland And Guillomer the king let assemble a great host
and yaf bataill to king arthur. But Guillom wos discomfited and yield him to the
king and become his man and to hi^ did feaulte and homage and of him held all

conquered Gutland and Island and took homages of folk and of ye land and^ there
duelled xij: year in pees and reigned with joy and myrthe and there wered no man
ne woman upon hi^. And he become so curtas and large and honorabull that the
Emprours court of Rome ne none oder through out all the world wos not accounted
to king Arth^ that any man wist of: ne none so well pr^sed. And therefore the
best knyghtis of all manner lands come un to him there for to duel^. and he them
ressaued with good will and reverence. And all the knyghtys weren so good: that
noma^ knew the werst: And therefore king Arthur made a round table that when they
should sit to there mete: all should be elike hie and euenly served at the tabull:
yt none of them should make a vau^ce yt on werhier than an other And king arthur
had at thatt table Britons and^ Frenshme^ Normans and^ Flemynges Burgo^s

to paris he pursued after and come theder and^ hi^ beseged: but the Cite was so
strong and wel^ araied and tho yt were therein defended them well and manli King
arthr duelled thermore the^ a month and there wos so much people i^ the cite
and^ dispe^did al^ there vitails yt were with i^. and^ so great hunger bicom
among them yt they died wonder thikke within the cite for hunger and come ^on
to Frol and prayed him to be accorded with king arthur for to have pees and
they would yield them un to him and the town also. Froll saw that no longer he
might hold the town ayens there will and trust gretli upon his own strength
and^ sent to king arthur that he should cum fight with him body for body. and
so should they deperte france between them two. King arthur anon granted it
and^ would not that none of his people undertook the bataill for hi^ And upon the
morn both come well araied with out paris there that they should fight and anon
they smyten to geders so fersly and so well they foughten in both sidis that no
man coud deem the better of them And so it befell that Froll yaf Arthur such a
stroke that he kneled to the ground would he nold he. and os frol^ withdrew his
sword he wounded king Arthur in the forhed that the blood fell down by his
eyn and his face: Arthur anon stert up hertely when he felt him hurt as a man
that seemed almost wo^d: and he took Tabourne his good suerd and^ drow it up an
high. and^ yaf Froll such a stroke that there with he clafe his head down to the
sholdres so that his helm might not be his warent. and so he fell down deid
in the place. And the^ tho of the cite made great sorrow for froll. and euerichon

humage and feaulte. and^ he vnderfenge them and took of them good hostages.
and^ king Arthur after that. went forth with his host and conquered Augien and

sesar conquered all the land of Bretan and took there of truage and our folk
have it long y had. and now through thy pride thou witholdes it: Wherefore we of
rome command the that thou it yield again. and yet have you more folly done:
that thou have slain Froll that wos our ba^on of france all with wrong. And
therefore all the communs of Rome warns the and commands the upon life and
lymme: that thou in have be at rome amendis for to make of thy mysdedis that
thou have done And it be so that thou cum not. we shall pass the hill of Joy
with strength: and we shall the sech where ever thou may be found and thou
shall not have a foot of land of thyn own that we ne shatt destruy it. and
afterward with thy bode we shall do all our will: When this letter was red:
and al^ men it herd: they were annoied all at were at that solemn fest. and^ ye
breto^s would have slai^ the messangers: but the king would not suffer them. and^

Rome and of all the honor that there to belongs. And Maximian king: conquered
all france and Almayn: and mount joy passed. and conquered all lumbardie. and
these ij. were mine auncestres and that they held and had. I shall have through

How kynh Arthur yaf bataill to the Emhrour in the which bataill the Emprour him
self was slain.
ARthur and his pepull had tidings that the Emprour had assembled a great pouer
as well of sarasyns as of payny^s and cristi^ men. where of the nombre wos
lxxx.M. horse men: with for men Arthur and his pepull ordined fast forth in there
way toward the Emprour and passed Normandye and france: un to Burgoyne and
would have gone to the host. for men told him yt the Empronis host would cum to
Lucie. The Emprour and his host in the beginning of August remeued from Rome
and came forth right the way toward the host. Tho come king Arthurs espies and
said if that Arthur would he should find the Emprour there fast by. But they
said that the Emprour had so great pouer with him of kings of the land and of
paynyms and also cristyn pepull: that it were bot folly to king Arthur to mete^
with them: for the espies told that the emprour had.v. men or vi ayenest on of
his. King arthur wos bold and hardy and for no thing him dismade and said. go
we bodile in goddis name ayens the Romans that with them led sarasens and
paynyms that no manner trust they have in god: but only upon there strength Go we
now and sech them sharply in the name of almighty god. and sle we the paynyms
and cristyn men that be ayenes us with them: for to distruy cristyn men. And
god shall us help them to ouercum. For we have the right oppynyon. and therefore
have we trust in god. and do we so that the enmys that be to cristi^dom and to
god. may be destruyd and over cu^myn. and that men may record the worthiness of
knyghthod When king Arthur had thus said: they cried all with an high vois.
God that is fadre almighty worsshipped be thy name with out end amen. And
grante us greece well for to do and to destru our enmys yt be ayens cristi^do^.
In ye name of the fader the son and ye holy ghost ame^. and god yef him never
grace ne worship i^ the world ne m^ci of hi^ to have that this day shall feynt
well for to smyt and^ egreli and^ so they riden softeli and ordyned his wings
well and wisely. The Emprour herd tell that king Arthur and his folk were ready
araied for to fight with him and theder they come and he ordined his wings i^
ye best manner that he might and more trust upon his strength than in god
almighty and that wos seyn afterward For when tho ij. hostis meten the Emprour
lost iiij. of his folk against on of Arthur. and so money were slain what in that
on parti and in that other that it was great pit to wit and be hold. In this
bataill were slain through king Arthur v. kings of the paynyms and of other
wonder much pepull And king Arthurs men foughten so well that the romans and
paynyms had no more strength to withstond them then xx. sheep ayens v. wolfes
And so it befell that in this bataill i^ the shower that wos wonder hard and^
long during in that on side and i^ that other the Emprour among them there wos
slain. but there wos no man that wist for very sothe who him slew.

How king Arthur let entere his knights that he had lost there in bataill and
how he sent the Emprours body to Rome that there wos slain in bataill.
WHen the Romans wist that the Emprour wos deid they forsook the feld and the
paynems also. And king arthr after them chased till it wos night: and so money
of them killed that it wos wonder to tell And tho turned king Arthur again wen
it wos night. and thanked god of his victori. And in the morrow he let look and
see all the feld for his knyghtys that he there lost that is to say Borel earl of
maunt Bedewer and Key and Ligiers earl of Boloyne vrgeti earl of baac Aloth
earl of wi^chestre Cursael earl of chestre and after holden earl of flaunders
these were the great lords that king arthur lost in that batail with other worthy
knights them among. And su^ he let entire in abbeis by the cuntre su^ he let
be borne i^ to there own cu^tre And the Emperors body he let take and put upon
a bear and sent it to rom and sent to say the romans that for briton and france
which thatt he held: other truage would he none pay And if they axed hi^ any
other truages. right soch truage he would them pay The king let ber Key to kenen
his own castle and^ there him entired. and^ Ligier wos borne to Boloyn there he
wos lord And Holden wos borne to flaundres and there he was entered And all the
other he let entere with much honor in abbais and^ in houses of relegion in
thee cuntre there that they werdeid. And arthur him self soiourned that same
year in Burgon with his host. and^ thought the same year f^loyng to pas the
mount of Joy: and^ have gone to Rome al for to take the cite and have put the
romans in subieccio^ but thee wykked tirand Mordred him let as after ye shall

Castelles. and he held hem ayens him
WHen king Arthur had taken to Mordred his Reame to keep and was gone ayens the
Emprour of Rome and^ was passed the sea. Mordred anon took homages and^
feautes of all them that were i^ this land. and would have had the land to his
own use. and^ took castles about and let them be araied And after this
falsnesse he did an other great wrong. for a yens the law of cristi^te he took
his own emes wife os a tratour should and ordined hi^ a great host ayens arthurs
co^yng to hold the land ayens hi^ with strongth for evermore And to slay king
arthur if he might and^ sent by ye see and be land and let assemble panyms and
cristi^ pepul. and he sent to saxons and^ to Danys for to help him And also
Mordred sent to Childrik to done men to cu^ to him out of saxoyne: yt was a
worthy duke and hight hi^ if that he brought with hi^ mich pepull he would grante
hi^ in heritage for evermore all the land from beyond hu^ber to scotland And
all the land that Engist had of vortigers yeft: when that he spoused his
daughter And Cheldrik come with a great strength and pouer of pepull. and^ Mordred
had assembled also i^ his half that they had xlM. of strong knights when that
they had need.

How Arthur enchased Mordred the tratour and how he wos slain and also king
Arthur wounded to death
WHen this tidings come to king Arthur there that he w^ as in Burgoyne he was
full sore anoyed and took all france to hoel for to keep with halfuendel of

were comen to land Mordred might not ayens them endure. but anon wos
discomfited and fled thens the same night with his men and upon the morn come
to london bot tho of the cite would not suffer him to cum in. and from thens he
fled to winchestre and^ there he him held with his pepull that come with him
King Arthur let take the body of Gawen his cosyn and the body of Augnissell and
let them be borne in to Scotland in to there own cuntre and there they were
entired. And after anon king Arthur took his way to distruy Mordred. and he
fled thens in to Cornewail And the queen Gu^nor that wos king arthurs wife
thatt tho sogerned at york and herd that Mordred wos fled thens and that he
might not endure ayens king Arthur. she wos soradrad and had great dout and wist
not what wos best all for to done. For she wist well that her lord king Arthur
would never of her have mercy For the great shame that she had him done. and took
h^^ way preuali with iiij. men with out mo and come to Karlion and there she
duelled all her life's time and never was seyn among folk her life during.
Arthur wist that Mordred wos fled in to Cornwaill and let send after his men in
to scotland and northhu^berland un to humber and let assemble folk with out
number and come fro thens in to Cornwaill to sech and pursue after Mordred And

had gadred and norishid of diverse landis and also the nobull knyghtis of the
round tabull that so much was prased through out all the world werther slain.
and arthur him self was wounded to the death. but he let him be borne in a
litter to a vyoun to be heled of his wounds and yet the bretons supposen that
he lives in an other land. and that he shall cum yet and conquer all breton.
But certis this is the prophesi of Merlin he said that his death shall be
dowtous: and said sothe for there of yet me^ have dout and shul have for ever
more as me^ sayen For men wot not wheder that he is on live or deid. Arthur was
borne to Auyon the xxij. year of his regne after th^e Incarnacion of our lord

he should take Argentill his daughter and the land: and yt he keped her well
and^ norisshe her in his chamber. And when she were of age she should be married
to the strongest and worthiest man that he might find and than he should yield up

delbright was deid and entered: Edell took ye damisell argentill: and norisshed
her i^ his chamber. and^ she become ye fairest creatr yt might live or any man

How king Edell married ye damisell to a knave of his kiche^
THis king Edell that wos uncle to the damisell Arge^til^ bethought how that he
might falsli have the land from his nece for ever more and falseli ayenest his
oath thought to dissaue thee damisell and to marie her to a knave of his kichen

Edell that wos his wifes uncle: and had all her land: os in an other place it
tells more openli and he ne reigned bot iij. year for saxons and danys hi^

Stonkenge and there they him entered with much honor.

Of king Conan that wos Curan cousin.
AFter this curan reigned Conan yt was his cosi^ that wos a wonder proud knight
and reigned and coud have no manner of love but ever he was medelyng with his
pepull. and took his un kill with were and killed his ij. children. The saxons
wered ayens him often times but he them over come. And so he wos in pees all
his life's time: and he reigned xiiij. year and after he died and lies at London.

Of king Cortif and of Gurmond that come through thee paynyms in to briton.
AFter this conan reigned his cousin Cortif yt was bihated of all his pepull and
nothing beloved. And this cortef lost all Britan through were. and in his time
fell that great myschef in breton that cristyndom wos destroyed and all the
britons were driven out of the land. and the land lost with out any recover. but
afterward left the lo^d to saxons. as ye afterward shall heir For in that time
there wos a paynyme yt was called Gurmond that wos the kings son Daufrikes of
the paynymys folk that had the reame after his fadre: and wos king sauf he
bequaeth and yaf it to his brother. and said that he nold never be king but if
he might get and conquer a reame i^ a strong cu^tre. For he wos bold and
strong of bodi: and^ of him prophesied Merly^ and said that he should be a
wolf of the sea. and he let assemle paynyms with out nombre and let a perell
shippis and^ went by mo^y landdis and took homages and^ feautes of money: and^
so he went by the sea and conquered money diverse londis So that he come to
Irland and conquered yt land. that often times wered upon bretons: and bretons
upon them. and^ often wonen and often losten: And yef hostages to bretons. and so
they sent to Gurmond there that he was in Irlond that he should come in to Briton
and help them ayens the britons. to help them to deliver that land of them.
and^ they would him hold gladly for there lord. for he wos a paynym and the were
paynims and the bretons were cristin. well ought he them for to help so as they
were all of on law: When Gurmond herd this prayer he hasted hi^ as much as he
might and arrived i^ scotland and come i^ to Northhu^berland there yt the saxons
were duelli^g. and they confirmed ye co^nauntes by twen them yt were made by
oaths and be hostages for to beir him true fay and hold him for lord and^ pay
to him truage by year. Tho began the saxons and the affricans to destruy rob
and^ brenne tounes and destru all thing i^ as much os they might. and spared
nether man ne woman ne child lered ne lewed. bot al^ they killed and cast down
tounes castles and chirches. And so put they all the land i^ great destruction.
and^ as sone os they might fleyn they fled thens as well poer as rich
bisshoppis abbotes chanons^ and^ all other great and small su^ in to litell
briton and sum in to Cornewaill. all tho that shippis might have.

How kyns Gurmond drofe the king Cortif to Chechestre and killed the bretons:
and through quentise get the town
COrtif the king sled thens in to Chechestre that tho was a good cite and a
strong: and^ there held him xx. days. And this Gurmond come and it beseged. but
the cite was so strong yt he might not get it by no manner of wise ne engyn that
he might done. Tho bythought they upon a great que^tise for to brenne the
town. they made engynes with glue of nets and took pieces of tunder and of
fire and bond it to the sparous fete and afterward let them fle. And they anon
right flow and logged them in the town there that there nestis were. and in
stakkes and i^ euyssinges of houses. and the fire began to tend and^ brend all
ye town And when the britans saw that. i^ every side they hied the^ out and
faught bot anon they were slain and^ discomfited and whiles the bataill dured
the king priueli hid hi^ and^ stale a way i^ to wales and me^ wiste never where
he become. and so was the town of chechistre taken and destruied: And after
Gurmond went and destruied cities and tounes that never were afterward made a
yene as it is seyn yet in this land in money places

How this land was called England for the name of Engist: and how money kenges
were made after in the land.
WHen Gurmond had destroyed all the land through out he yaf the land to the
Saxons. and anon they took it with good will For the saxons long time had
desiered it for as much as they were of Engistes kynred that first had all the
land of Breton: and let them be called Englissh men for be cause of Engistes
name And the land they let call England in there langage and the folk been
called englisshmen for os much os i^ his time it wos called Engist land when he
had conquered it of vortiger that spoused his daughter. but from the time that
Brut come first i^ to England this lo^d was called Breton and the folk britons
But since the time that this Gurmond eftsons conquered it and yaf it un to the
saxons. and they anon right changed the name os by fore is said. And when this
wos done Gurmond passed over in to france. and there conquered money landis and
destruyed all christian pepull there that he come. and the saxons duelled i^ this
land and^ bigane fast it to inhabit at there own will. and they would have made

in to a great sickness. and than wos there a great descorde by twen the lordis of
the land. that every on of hem wered upon other And yet in that time there fell
so great derth and scarcite of corn and other vitailles i^ this land yt a man
might go iij. days or iiij. fro tou^e to town yt he should not fi^d to bie for
gold ne salu bred wine ne none other vitaill: wherewith a man might leave. but
only the pepull leued by rotes of herbis. for other living had they no^e so
mich wos it faillid all a bout. fisshis wildbestes and all other thing. so that
yet to this missaue^tur there fell so great mortalyte and^ pestilence among the

beri the deid bodies: for they died so sodenli both great and small. lord and
sarnand: os they ^ten and going and^ spekyng they fell down and^ died: so that
never wos herd of more soden death emonge the pepull. for he yt went for to beri
the deid bodi: with the same deid bodi wos beried And so they that might fle fled
and^ for soke there lands and^ houses as well for the great hunger derth and^
scarcite of corn and^ other vital: as for the horibull mortalite and^
pestilence i^ the land. and went i^ to other landis for to save there lives: and
left the land all desert and wast so that there wos not any man to travel and

How Cadwaldre went out of this land i^ to lytel^ britan.
CAdwaldre saw great hunger mortalite and pestilence and the land all poer. and
failyng corns and other vitales and his folk perysshid and saw also the most
pert^ of his land all wasted and voed of pepull He apparailled him and his
folk that were left on live. and passed over in to little Breton with a little
nauye un to king Aleyn that he much loved that wos his cousin. and that his
fadre had much loved in his time And as they saled in the sea. he made great
lametacion. and so did all tho that were with him. and said. Dedisti nos domine
tanquam oues escarum et in gentibus dispersisti nos. ANd than began Cadwaldre
to complayn him to his folk pytuusly and said Alas said he. to us wrecches and
Caytyfes is sorrow: for owr grett synnys of the wych we would not amend us while
we had space. and now repentance is comt upon us: thoro myssauentur which
chaceth us out of our own reame and propre soil fro. and^ out of the which some
time Romans Scottis Saxons ne Danys might not exile us Bot what a vailleth it
now to us that before time of tsythes have gote^ money other lands since it is
not the will of god that we abide and duel in our own land. God that is very
Judge that all things knaweth before they be done or made. he seith that we would
not ^esse of our synnys: and that our enmys might not us ne our lineage exile
fro: and out of ye reame. he would that we amended us of our folies and that we
seen our proper defaultes: And there for has showed to us wrath and will
chastise us of our mysdedys Since that he does us without batalll or strength of
our enmys by great companyes wricchedly to leave our own reame and proper land
Turn ayene ye Romans. turn ayene ye Scottis. turn ayene ye Saxons: turn
ayene ye Fraunsois: now sh^eweth to you Bretan all desert: the which your pouer
might never make desert ne yet your pouer has not put us now in exile. but
only the pouer of ye king almighty whom we have often offendid by our folies the
which we would not leven un till he chastised us by his divine pouer Among the
words and^ lametacion that the king Cadewaldre made to his folk they arrived
in litell Briton and come to king Alyne beforsayed And the king resaued him
with Joy. and made him to be served wonder nobully. and there he duelled long
time after The englissh pepull that were left on live and were ascaped the great
hunger and mortalite lived in the best wise that they might. and much pepull
sprung and come of them. And they sent in to Saxony where they were borne to
therfrendes for men women and children to restore the cites with pepull. and
the towns that were all voyed of pepull and for to labor travel and till the
earth When the saxons had herd this tydyng they come in to this land
wondirthykke in great companyes. and he^berd them self in the cuntre all a boute
where that they would: for they found no man them to let ne with stond And so
they waxen and multiplied gretli and used the customs of the cuntre where of
they were comen and the lawys and the langage of there own land And they changed
the names of citeis tounes castelles and burghis and yaf them names and called
them os they now be called. And they held the Countees the Baronages
lordshippis and trees in manner as thee Brotons be fore time had compassed them.
And among other great conpanies yt com from Germayn in to this land come the
noble queen that was called Sexburga with men and women without nombre. and
arrived in the cuntre of Northhumberlond and took the land from Albio^ un to
Cornwaill: for her and for her folk For there was none that might them let^ for
all wos desilat and wid of pepull: but it were a few pouer Bretonis that were
laft on mountans and wedes un till that time And fro that time forth lost the
bretons this reame for all there days. and the Englissh pepull begone to regne
and deperted the land bitwen them and they made money kings about by diverse
parts of the land os heir been devised the first of westsex the secund
Merchenrich: thee third Estangle the fourth kent: the fifth southsex All those
reigned in this land after Cadwaldre wos passed out of this land and^ duellid in
litell breton with king Aliyn his cousin and true friend And when he had long
dulled there and had knawynge that the mortalite and pestilence wos over passed
and that the land wos replenysshed of alyen pepull he thought to turn again in
to his land. and prayed king Alyen his cousin of socour and helpee that he might
be rastored again to his own proper reame and first dyngnyte and king Aleyne
granted him his askyng. Then did he apparel him to take his way and viage in
to this land and prayed god almighty devoutly that he would make to him
demonstracion yef his prayer in to this land were to him plesaunt or none For
ayenes the will of god almyghti he would no thing done. When he had thus
devoutly made his prayer a wis fro heaven to him said: and bad him leave that
Iornay a way in to England. and that he should go to the pope of Rome For it was
not the will of almighty god that bretons regne more in breton ne never recover
the land un to the time that thee prophecy that Merlin said before be
fulfilled. and that should never been un to the time were cummyn that the
relics of his body shall be brought fro Rome and translait in to breton. And
when the relics of other sentis that have been hid for the persecucion of the
paynyme folk shall be funden and openli showed than shall they recover there
land ayene: the which they have so long time lost through there deserts. When
Cadwaldre had herd this ansuere he meruailled gretli and told it to king Aleyne
Than king Aleyne did send for the clarge of his land and made the^ to bring
the stories and prophecies that Merlyn and Sibill had said in there prophecies.
And when he knew that the prophesy that festome had prophesied of the Egle and
other prophecies accorded to the dyuine ansuer that Cadwaldre had herd he
councellid to leave his pepull and his naue. and submit him to the disposicion
of god. and done all that the angel had commanded him. Than Cadwaladre called
Ynor his son: and Yuory his cousin that was his sustres son: and saydd to them:
Takes said he my folk and my naue that his heir all ready and pass ye in to
wales: and be ye lordis of bretons that no dishonor come to them by
interrupcion of the paynyms folk for defaute of lordis. And then he him self
left his reame of Bretan and his folk for ever more. and took his way un to
the pope of Rome Sergius the which worsshipped him much. and so he wos confessed
and took pennaunce for his sins And he had not long duelld there that he ne
died the.xij. Kalend of May the year of grace.v.C.lxxix.

How king Offa wos soueraxn a boue all the kings of England ana how every king
wered upon other.
IT befell so that all the kings in that time that were in ye land as they of
Westsex Merchenrich Esta^gle of ke^t and of southsex and of other costs each
wered upon other and he that was most mighty took the land of him that was most
febel But there was a king among them that wos called Offa that wos sent
Oswaldes brother. This offa conquered all the kings of the land and reigned a
boue them all. And so great wos the were in every cu^tre bitwen kings that no

the lives and^ dedis of kings and how long every of them reigned and in what
cuntre. and in what manner every king died. and^ of bisshoppis also And there of
made great books and let call them the cronicles. And the good king Alured had
that book in his ward and let bring it un to wynchester and let it be fast
tached to an piler that men should it not remeue ne bear it thens. so that eueri
man might it se and there upon look. For there in be the lives of all the Kings
that ever were in England

How the king of Northhumberland Osbright for lay the wife of Buerne bocard
through strength. and after this buerne conquered the king with pouer and
strength.
ANd thus it befell in the same time that there wos a king in Northhumberland
that wos called Osbright and soiorned at York. and this king went hi^ upon a
day in to a wod him for to disporte. and when he come ayene. he went priueli in
to a good man's house that was called Buerne. and^ the good man of that place wos
gone that time to the sea. For often times he wont there to aspie thieves and
robers that often times were wo^t to cum in to the land to rob brene and sle. The
lady yt was buernes wife was a wonder fair woman. and the king com un to her
when that her housbond wos absent. And so she trastid none harm un to the
king: and welcomed him with much honor. and worthily him served in all thing.
When the king had eten. he took the lady by the hand and leed her i^ to a
chamber and said that he would speak with her a council: and^ all the folk
from the chamber he made void saf only the lady and he. but the lady wist not
wherefore he it did till that he had done al his will. And when he had done this
deed he turned ayene to york. and the ladi he left there wonder sore weeping for
the deed that the king to her had done. And when her lord was come^ home and
saw her weep and sich some and morning make he axed of her what she had done and
why she made such sorrow. Sir quoth she queinteli and falseli the king Osbright me
has done shame and velonye ayens my will^ and told hi^ the truth how the king
had her forlayne with strength where for she said she had lever to be deid than
live. Fair leef be still quod he. for ayenes strength febelnesse is litell
worth. and therefore of me shall thou never the less be loved. and namly for
thou have told me ye trewthe. And if almighty god grante me life. I shall the
well avenge. This Buerne was a great man and a mighty lord. and wos well beloved
and great frindis had. and let send for the grettest lordis of ye land and to
them made his conplayn of thee dispite that the king to hi^ had done. and said
yt he would be auengid how so ever yt it were. and all his frendis concelled and
grented to wend un to york there that the king wos: And buerne took his meyne
and come to the king. And when ye king hi^ saw he called hi^ courtasly Buerne
by name. and buerne him ansuerd and to him said. Sir I you defy and yield up
feutes hoomages and londis and os much as I have holden of you. and so fro this
time forward I will never of the nothing hold. and so he depertid from the king
with out more speech or any a bydyng. and took love of his fre^dis and^ went in
to Denmark: and plened to the king Godryne and told hi^ of the dispite that
king Osbright to hi^ had done of his wife: and praid him of socour. and help him
to avenge. When king Godrine of denmark and the danois had herd the complaynt
of this Buerne and of the preier that he had. they were right wonder glad i^
heart. for as much that they might find a cause for to gone in to England for to
were upon the English men. and also for to aue^ge Buerne of the dispite that
the king Osbright had done un to his wife. And for as much os Buerne wos sibbe
to the king of Denmark Anon they let ordeyne a great host of men and let
ordeyne them ships and as much as them need to have to that viage. And when
all the host was ready. the king made his ij: brethren cheftaynes that were
nobull knights of body and also bold. that on was called Hunger and yt other
Hubba.

How the Danys took york and killed the king Osbright and afterward king Elle.
WHen all thing wos ready tho ^ij. bred token leave of the ki^ge Godryn and went
toward the sea. for to wend over in to England as fast as they might speed. Now
is Buerne so well comforthed and fast hyed him with the Danois that they been
arrived in the north cuntre and comen through out Holdernesse. and destruyed all
the cuntre and brenned tounnes and robbyd fol^ke: and killed all that might be
taken till that they comen un to york. And when king Osbright saw them cum. he
took his pepull that he had with him and come out of the cite. and faught with
them. but no foyson he and ayens them and much was the pepyll that there wos
slain in both pertes. and king Osbright him self there wos slain: and the cite
anon wos take. and the danois went in. And there wos also an other king in
northumberland that Buernes fre^des had chosen and held him for king a man that
wos called Elle: for as much as they would not to king Osbright been entendant.
for the dispite that he had done un to buerne there cousin Hit befell thus that
the king Elle was gone to the wode him for disporte and of venison sum he had
take and os he sat in the wode at mete to a knight he said: we have well sped
and much venisan taken. And with that word come in a man. and to him said. if
ye so much of venison had wonnen. an hondreth times so much more there ayens ye
have lost For all this cuntre the Danois have get. and take the cite of york.
and ayens you should it hold that never ye shall not cu^ therein. And for so
much they haven slain king Osbright. When king Elle herd these wordis. he let
assemble all thee folk of the cuntre and ordained all the pouer that he might
have and would have get the town of york with strength but the danois comen
out anon and yaf hi^ a strong bataill and killed the king Elle and the most
part of his pepull that he had brought with him: and the same place there they
were slain shall ever more be called Ellecroft and that place is a litell from
york. And tho rested the danois never till they had conquered all
northhumberland and in that cu^tre they made wardeyns and went ferther in to
the land and took notyngham and there they abyden all thee winter and did the
sorrow that they might And after when somer time come they remeued from

wos chosen duke of that pepull. and when he wos made duke of this pepull of

his prophet sayng on this wisse or on this. Thus by his false menys he dissaued
the pepull. And when his masters and he had made this that wos so delectabull.
He wrotte it in a book with letters of gold. and also he noresshed a mighty
Camel secretly in a preuey place. and alonli with the hondis of machomyte wos
always fed. and there privily he tied this book of the law that he had made:
about the camales neke. and put this camel forth on a time in to the feldes a

And he would suffer no man to cum and toche him. and^ so there wos a great fame of

lykke his handis. and so he did a fore all tho pepull. The pepull then cried
and said that there was a very ensample that he wos the true prophet of god.
Then they y prayed machomyte to opyn that holy book with his holy handis: the
which wos send from heaven. ever more to be kepid. in the which book is showed how
the people shall woyrshyp god. And machomyte said this book wos writtyn with

better what it might be. and^ anon the arow him smot through ye body and^ there
slew the king. for that engyn wos made to kill his own lord tratoursly And
when king edmond wos thus deid and slain he had reigned but x. year and his
pepull for hi^ made much sorrow and his body they bear un to glasti^beri. and
there they hi^ en^ed And this false tratour Edrith anon went to the queen thatt
was king edmondis wife that wist of her lordis dethe^ anon he took from her
ij: sonnys that were fair and young that her lord had upon her gotten. that one
was called Edward and that other Edewyne and lad them with him to london and
took them un to king Knought that he should do with them what his will were and
told him how quently he had killed king Edmond for encheso^ and love of him so
that king knoght all england in his pouer holly might have O thou falls tratour
have thou my true brother that wos so true thus slain for encheson of me a man
yt I most loved in the world. Now be my head I shall for thy trauaill the well
reward as thou have deserueid. and anon let him be take and bond hand and
feet in manner of a tratour and let cast him there in to Thamyse. and in this
manner the false tratour endid his life: The king took the ij. childer and put
them un to the abbot of west mynster to ward and to keep till he wist what that
it was best with them for to done.

How king knoght sent king Edmondis sonnys both in to Denmark for to sle and
how they were saved
AIt befell sone afterward that king knoght had all the land in his hand and
spoused the queen Emma through consent of his Baronage: for she was afarr woman
the which was Eldredis wife and the dukis sustre of Normandy and they leued to
gedre with much love as reason would The king axid upon a day consell of the
queen what was best to done with ye sonnys that were Edmond Irensides Sir quoth she
they be the right theires of the land. and if they lefen they will do you much
sorrow with were. and therefore let send them in to a strange land afer to sum man
that may them defoull and distroy. The king anon let call a danois that was
called Walgar. and commanded him that he should led those ij. childer in to
Denmark and so to do and ordeyn for them yt they should never heir more of
them. Sir said this walgar gladly your commandment shall be done. and anon
tho.ij. child he took and^ led them in to Denmark and for as much os he saw
that the childer were wo^dir fair and also meke. He had of them great pit and
rewth and would not them slay but let them to the king of Hungri for to norrich:
for this walgar wos welbeknowen with the king and well-beloved Anon the king
axed whens the childer were. and walgar told him and said that they were the
right heiris of england and therefore men would them destruye. and therefore sir to
you they be comen merci and help for to sech. and for soth if they may lyuen
your men they shall become. and of you they shall hold all there land: The king
of hu^gri them vnderfo^g with much honor and let them wortheli be keped And thus
it befell afterward yt Edwyne ye yo^ger brother died. and edward the elder
brother lived a fair man and^ a strong and^ a la^ge of bodi and gentill and
courtais of conditions So that all men him loved And this edward in the
croniclis is called emonges englishmen Edward the outlay And when he was made
knight the ky^ges douter of hungeri hi^ much loved for his godnes and^ his
fairness. that she him called her derling The king that was her fader
perceived well the love that wos betuyx them two and^ had none heier bot that
daughter. and^ the king wochedsafe his daughter to no man so well os he did to
him that she loved and he her: And yaf her un to him with good will and edward
her spoused with much honor. The king of hungeri sent after all his baronage
and made a solemn fest and a rich wedding. and^ made all men to understand
that this edward should be king of that lo^d after the decesse of hi^ and
therefore all they made great joy. and^ of that tydinges they were full glad This
edward begat upon this ladi a son yt wos called edgar helyng and afterward a
doghter that was called Margaret that afterward wos queen of scotland^ and by
the king of scotland that was callid Mancolin she had a daughter that was
called maud that wos queen afterward of england through king Henry that wos the
frist son of the co^querour that her weddid And he begat upon her a daughter
that wos called Maude that after wos emperesse of almayn: And of this maude

And yet had this Edward an other daughter by his wife that wos called Cristia^
and she wos a Nonne.

How king knoght that wos a proud man conquered Norway and^ how he become

NOw have ye hard of Edmondis Irendeshed sonnis thatt king Knoght wend they had
been slain as he had co^mandid walgar before. And this Knaght had in his hand
all ye reame of england and denmark: and after that he went un to Norway that
land for to conquer. But the king of the land that was called Elaf come with
his pepull and^ wend his land well to have kepid and defendid. and so there he
faught with him. till at the last he was slain in that bataill. And tho this
knoght took all yt land in to his hond. And when he had conquered Norway and
taken feautes and homages there. he come afterward again in to england and held
him self so great a lord that him thought in all the world his pere no man wos.

day as he had herd mass at westmynster and would have gone in to his palais.
the wawis of the thamyse so swyftely ayens him come. that almost they touched
his fete Tho said the king with a proud heart I co^ma^d the water to turn again

fluwed over in hie more. and more The king wos so proud of heart that he would
not fle the water but abode still in the water. and^ bet it with a yerde yt he

Of king Hardeknoght that wos haroldis brother.
AFter this harold harefote reigned his brother hardeknoghtt a^ nobull knight

Of the velani that the danois did to the english men wherefore from yt time
after wos no danois made king of this land.
AFter the death of this king hardiknoght for as much as he and no thing of his
body begoten. The earls and barons assembled and made a counsel that never
more afrte no man yt wos a danois though he he were never so great a man among
them he should never be king of england for the dispite that the danis had done
to englisme^. For ever more be fore and if it were so yt the englishmen and the
danois hapened for to mete upon a (...) the englishmen sh^old not be so hardi
to meue ne styr a foot. ^^t and still till the dano^is war appassid forth And
more over if ye englishmen had not bowed down there hedis to done reuerens un
to the danois they should have been bet and defouled. and soch manner despites
and velanye diden the danois to our englishmen wherefore they were driven out of
the land after time thet king hardiknoght was deid for they had no lord that
them might maynten. And in this manner avoided the danois england that never
they comen again. The earls and barons by there common assent and consellees sent
un to normandye for to seche tho ij. brether Alured and^ Edward that were
duelling with the duke Richard that was there eme in intent for to croune Alured
the elder brother and him make king of england. and of this thing to make an
end The earls and barons made there oath: But the earl Godwyn of westsex falsely
and tratoursly thought for to sle these two brethren anon as they should cum in
to england i^ intent to make his son harold king the which son he had begoten
upon his wife the which was king knoghtys daughter that wos a danois. And so
this godwyne privily him went un to south hamton. for to mete there the ij.
brethren when that they should come un to land. And thus it befell that the
messingers that went in to Normandy fond not but only Alured that wos the
elder brother. For Edward his brother wos gone to hungry for to speak with his
cousin Edward the owtlaw that was Edmondis son with the Irenside The messingers
told and said to Alured how that the earls and barons of england sent after him
and that he boldly should cum i^ to england and vnderfonge the reame. for king
hardiknoght was deid. and all the danois driven out of the land.

How Godewyn the false tratour took Alured upon Gildesdoune when that he come

there way toward london And when they come upon Gildesdone tho said the tratour
Godwyne un to Alured take keep about you both on the left side and^ on the
right side. And of all ye shall be king: and of such an hundredth more Now for
soth quoth Alured I behight you and^ if I be king I shall ordeyn and^ make such
lauys whereof god and^ man shall be well apayed Now had the tratour commanded

sle all yt were i^ Alured is company yt com with hi^ from Normandy and^ after
yt take alured and led hi^ in to ye I Will of Eli and after put out both his eyn
of his head and afterward bring hi^ un to death And so they did for they killed
all the company that there were. the nombre of xij gentillmen that were come^
with alured from normandy. And after took they alured and in the I Will of Eli
they put out his eyn and^ rent his womb and^ took the chief of his bouels and
put a stake in to the grond and an end of the bouels there to fastined. and with
nedil^les of Iren they prikked the good child and so made hi^ to go about the
stake till that all his bouels werdrawen out of his body. and^ so died Alured
there through treson of the earl godwyn. When tho lordis of england had hard and
wist how alured that should have been there king was put to death through the false
tratour godwin they were wonder wroth and suore bitwin them god and^ by his holy
names yt he should die a more werse death than did Edrith of stratto^ yt had
betrayed his lord Edmond Irenside. and^ they wald have put hi^ to death. bot the
thief tratour fled thens in to denmark and there held him iiij^ year and^ more

sympull letterd man. and there for he chose an other pope to be consecrate with

said to the romans they should never chese pope with out his assent. and so v.
being pope the sex wos put in. But money men says this Gregori was an holy man.

the pope seet: and he died suddenly: And anon the Romans asked to have a pope
and yt the almayns should have none: for they were so herd hertid that they
might not incline to the i^tent of ye emprour. the which said there should be no
pope chosin bot if he would be of counsel of the eleccion. bot for all that
they put in this holy man Leo. and after he had of that conscience. and

England that is for to say xxxv.M: mark. And thus he sent through out all
england un to the monkis of the ordir of Cisteaux that they should help him of
vi.M. mark of silver: And they ansuerd and said yt they durst nothing done with
out there chief abbot of cisteaux wherefore king John^ when he come again from
Irland did them so much sorrow and care that they not wist werfor to abide for
he took so much ransom of every house of them that the sum ammounted to
ix.M.ccc. mark So that they were clean lost and^ destruid and voided there

restore all the goodis again that he had teken of them ayens there will. And else
they should curse him by name and to do this thing and to conferme the pope took
them his letters in bullis patentz. These ij. legatis come in to england and
come to the king to Northamton there that he held his parliament and full

other clerkis and lewd men* that he had exiled out of this land that they
should come again in to England and have again there lands and also there rentis
and that he would make restitucio^ of the gooddis that he had taken of there is
against there will. The king him self tho and Pandolf and earls and barons went
un to wynchestre ayens the Erchebisshopp Stephen and^ when he wos come the king
went against him and fell a down to his fete and thus to him said. fair sir ye
be welcome and I cry you merci for encheson that I have trespassed against you:
The Erchebisshop took him up tho in his armies and cussed him courtasly often
tymys and after lad hi^ to the door of Sent Swythynes church by the hond and
assoyled him of the sentance and^ hi^ reconsiled to god and to holy church and
that was on Sent Mergaretes day and the erchebisshop anon went for to sing
mass and the king offered at the mass a mark of gold. And when the mass was
done all they went to vnderfong all there landis with out any manner gayn sayng:
And that day they made all mirth and^ joy y nowgh. but yet was not the
enterdytyng releced. for encheson the pope had set that the enterditing should
not be undone: till the king had made full restitucion of the goodis that he
had taken of holy church and that him self should done homage to the pope by a
certain legate that he should send in to england Tho took Pandolf his leave of the
king and of the erchebisshop and went again un to Rome. And the erchebisshop
anon let come before him prelatis of holy church at Redyng for to trete and
council how much and whot they should axe of the king for to make restitucion
of the godis that he had take of them And they ordined and said that the king
should yet un to the erchebisshop iij.M. mark for the wrong that the king had

god and of the pope payng to the pope by year as it is above said.

How the enterdityng wos undone i^ england and of the debate that wos bitwen

WHen king John^ had don his homage to the legate that showed him the popes
letter that he should pay to Julian and yield again that was king Richard wife
the iij^ part of the land of england and^ of irland that he had with hold since
that king Richard died* When king john^ herd this he was wonder wroth: for
vtterli the enterditing might not be undone till that he had made gree and
restitucion to the forsaid Iuliane of that she axed The legate went tho again to
the pope after cristemasse. and^ the king sent tho messangers over se to Julian
that wos king Richard wife for to have a relese of that she axed of him: And so
it befell that Ivlian died anon after Estir And in so much the king was quyte
of that thing that she axed. But tho at the fest of sent Johan that come next
after through the popis commandment the enterditing wos frist relesed through
all england the vij. day of Iuyll And vij: year was the land enterdited. and i^
the morn men rong and said mass through out all london and^ so after through
out all england And the next year after there began a great debate bitwene king
John^ and^ the lordis of england for encheson that he would not grant the
laws and hold. the which sent Edward had ordained. and had be used and hold un
to yt time yt he had them broken for he would hold no law bot did all thing that
hi^ likid and desheried money me^ with out consent of lordis and^ peris of the
land. and would desherite the good Earl Randulf of Chestre for encheso^ yt he
undertook hi^ of his wykkidnesse. and for cause that he did so much shame and^
velany to god and holy church And also fer he held and hauntid his own
brothers wife and lay also by money other women great lordis doughtres for he
sparid no woman that him liked for to have. wherefore all the lordis of the land
were with him wonder wroth and went to london and^ took the cite: And for to
cese this debate and sorrow the erchebishop and other great lordis of the land
assembled them before the fest of sent Johan baptist in a meadow besides the
town of stanes yt is called Romnemede. And the king made them there a chertour
of fraunches such as they would axen and^ i^ soch manner they were accordid and
that accordeme^t last not full long. for the king him self sone after did
ayens the pointis of the same chartre that he had made wherefore the most part
of the land of lordis assembled them and began to were upon him again. and
brened his tounes and robbid his folk and did all ye sorrow yt they might and^
made them as strong as they might with all there pouer and thought to drive him

Piccardes and^ of Flemmynges So that the land might not susteyn them but with
much sorrow And among all these pepull there was a man of Normandy that was
called Faukis of brent and this Normand and his conpany spared another church
ne house of religion bot they bri^t and robbed it and^ bare away all that they
might take. so that the land wos all destroyed what on oon side and on other.
The barons and lordis of England ordained among them the best spekers and

he would send lowys his son in to england to be king of england and^ to
vnderfenge the croune.

monk that stood before the king was for this word full sori in heart and thought
rather he would him self suffer death. and thought if he might ordeyn there fore

THe frist year afterward that king Edward was crouned Lewelin prince of wales
sent in to france to the earl mou^fort that through counsel of his frendis the
Earl should wedde his daughter and the earl tho a vised him upon this thing and
sent un to Lewelyne and said that he would send after his daughter And so he
sent Aymer his brother after the damisell and Lewelyn arrayed shippis for his
daughter and for sir aymer and for her fair company that should gone with her.
And this lewelyn did great wrong for it was couenand that he should yef his
daughter to no manner man with out council and consent of king edward And so it
befell that a burgies of Bristow come in the sea with wine laden and met them
and took them with might and pouer. and^ ano^e the burgeis sent them to the
king. And when Lewelyn herd this tydyng he was wonder wroth and^ also sorrowful
and began for to were upon king edward and^ did much harm un to the englisshmen
and bet dou^e the kings castelles and began fast for to distroy king Edwardis
landys: And when tiding come un to king edward of this thing he went in to
wales and so much he did through goddis grace and his great pouer that he drofe
Lewelyn un to much mischief that he fled all manner strength and^ come and yield
him un to the king edward and yaf him.l.M: mark of silver to have pees and^
took the Damisell and^ all his heritage and^ made an obligacion to king edward
to cum to his parliament ij times of the year And in the secund year after that
king edward wos crouned he held a general parlame^t at westmynstre and^ there
he made the statutis for defaute of law by ye conmune assent of all his
baronage And at estre next sewyng the king sent by his letter un to Lewelyn
Prince of wales that he should cum to his parliament for his land and for his
holding in wales as the strength of the letter obligatorye witnessid. Tho
Lewelin had scorn and^ dispite of the kings commandment. and for poer wrath
again began were upon king Edward and distroyed his landis And tho when that
king Edward herd of this tidings he waxed wonder wroth un to Lewelin and in
have assembled his pepull and went him toward wales and werid so upon Lewelin
the prince till that he brought him in much sorrow and disese. And Lewelyn saw
that his defense might him not a vaill and come again and yield him to the
kings grace^ and cried him merci and long time knelid before the kings foot.
The king had of him pit and co^mandid him for to arise. and for his meekness
for yaf him his wroth and to him said. that if he trespassid again him an other
time that he would distroy him for ever more. David that wos lewelins brother
that same time duellid with the king edward and was a fell man and a sotill
and^ enuyous and also far castyng and much treson thought. and^ ever more
held him still for to wit and aspi the kings will. and^ ever more made good
sembland and semid so true yt no man might persaue his falsenesse.

How Lewelin through eggyng of David his brother werid again upon king edward.
IT wos not long after that time that king Edward did yef to David Lewelins
brother the lordship of Frodesha^ and made him a knight. And so much honor did
he never after to no man of wales for encheson of hi^ King edward held his
perlament at london when he had done in wales all that he would and cha^gid his
monay that tho wos fouyll cut and roundid. wherefore the romyn pepull plenyd
them wonder sore. So that the king let enquere of them that such trespoces did.
And.ccc. were atteynt^d of such moner falsenes. wherefore some were honged and^ some
draw and afterward honged. And afterward the king ordained that ye sterling
half pen and ferthyng should gone through out his la^d and commanded that no
man fro that day afteerward yaf ne seffed house of religion with land tenement
with out special leave of the king: and he that did should be ponysshed at the
kings will. and^ the yift should be for naught And it wos not long after that
Lewelin Prince of wales through the ticement of David his brother and by both
there consent they thought to disherite king Edward i^ as much as they might. so
that through them both the kings pees wos broken. And when king edward herd
this: anon he sent his barons in to Northumberland and the furreis also that
they should go and take there viage vpo^n the tratours Leweli^ and David and^
wonder herd it was for to were tho. for it is winter in wales when in other
cu^tres is somer And Lewelin let ordeyn and well array and vitolle his good
castle of Swandon and wos therein an huge nombre of pepull and plente of
vitales so that king edward wyste not wherefore to enter And wen the kings me^

botes and great plankis as money os they might ordeyn and have for to gone to the
forsaid castle of Swando^ with men on foot and eke on horse But the walshmen
had so much people and were so strong yt they driven the englisshmen again so that
there was so much prese of people at the turnyng again that the charge and^ the
burden of them made ye barges and botis to sink. And there wos drenched full
money a good knight that is to say Sir Roger Clifford sir willm of ly^desey that
wos sir John^ son fitz Robert and^ sir Richard Tanny and^ an huge nombre of
other and all wos through there own folly. for if they had had good espies they
had not be harmed When king Edward herd tell that his pepull were so drenched he
made sorrow enough But tho come sir Johan of vessye from the king of Aragon and
brought with him much pepull of bachilars and of Gascoyns and were sowdiours and
duellyng with the forsaid Johan of vessie and vnderfong of him wages and with
him were withold and nobull men they were for to fight and brent money tounes and
killed much pepull of walshmen all that they might take And all tho with
strength and might made assaute un to the Castle of Swandon and get the
castle And when David the prince brother herd this tydyng he ordained him to
flight. And Lewelin the prince saw that his brother was fled. Then he was sore
abassed for he had no pouer to his were for to maynten And so Lewelin began for
to fle and wened well for to have scappid. But in a morrow sir Roger Mortemer
met with him only with x. knyghtis and set him round about and^ to him went and
smoten of his head and presentid it un to the king Edward And in this manner the
prince of wales was taken and his head smyten of and^ al his heiris disherited
for ever more through rightful dome all the landis of the reame.

How David that was Lewelins brother prince of wales wos put to the death.
David that was the Princes brother of wales through pride wened for to have been
prince of wales after his brothers death And upon this he sent after walshmen to
his parliament at Dinbigh and^ folishly made walis for to arise ayens the king
and began to meue were ayens king Edward and^ did all the sorrow and disese
that he might by his pouer When king Edward herd of this thing he ordained men
to pursue upon him. And David fersly him defendid till that he come to the
town of sent Morice and there wos David take as he fled. and lad to the king
And ye king commau^did that he should be honged and^ draw and smite of his head
and quartir him and send his head to london and the iiij quartirs send to the
iiij. chief tou^es of wales. for they should take exampull thereof and^ beware.
And afterward king Edward let cry his pes through out all walis and^ seized all
the land in to his hond. and all the great lordis that were left a live come to
done feaute and^ homage to the king Edward. as to there kind lord. And tho let
king edward amend the lawis of walis yt were defective. And after he sent to all
the lordis of wales by his letter patent. that they should cu^ all to his
perlament. and when they were comen the king said to them full curtesly
Lordynges ye be welcome. and me behooves your counsel and your help for to
wend in to Gascoyn for to amend the trespaces that me wos dene when I wos there

And all the kings liege men Earls and Barons consentid and grauntid thereto:
And tho made him king edward ready and went in to Gascoyn and let amend all the
trespaces that him wos done in gascoyn And of the debate that wos between the
king of Aragon and the prince of Morrey he cesid and made them accordid. And
while good king edward and the queen Elienore his wife were in gascoyn. The
good earl of Cornewaill wos made wardeyn of england till that king Edward come

and each of them all vnderfenge there dome after that they had deserved. But in
the mean time while that the good king edward was beyond the se to done them

tratour that wos called Risap Meridoc began for to make were ayens king Edward
and that wos for encheson of Sir Pain Tiptot wrongfully grieved and disesed the
forsaid Risap Meridoc: And when king edward herd all this he sent by his letter
to Risap meridoc that he should begin for to make no were but that he should be
in pees for his love and when he come again in to england he would under take the
quarrel and amend all that wos mysdone This forsaid risap meridoc despisid the
kings commandment and^ sparid not to do all the sorrow yt he might to ye
kings men of england but anon after he wos takyn and lad to york and there he

Of Merlin prophecies that were declarid of king edward that wos king Henri son.
ANd of this king Edward prophesied Merlin and called him a dragon the secund
of the vi. kings that should be for to regne in england. and said that he
should be medeled with merci and also with strength and sternesse that should
keep england from cold and hete: and that he should open his mouth toward wales
and that he should set his foot in wyke. and that he should closen with walls that
should do much harm to his sede And he said soth for the good king Edward was
meddled with merci and^ with fersenesse with merci ayens his enmys of wales and^
after of Scotland with fersenesse when he put them to death for there falsenesse
and tratori as they had deseruied it. And well keped he england from cold and
hete since he keped it from all manner enmys that run upon him to done him any
wrong: And well he opyned his mouth toward wales and^ made it quake through the
hidour of his mouth when he co^querid it through dynt of swerde^ for the prince
Leuelin and David his brother Ris and Morgan were put to death for there falsenes
and there folly. And he set his foot in to wike and conquered berewyke at the
which conquest were slain xxv. thousand and vij. hondreth out take them that were
brend in the reed hall. And the walls that he let make shall be noyous un to
his sede as me^ shall here after see in the lifee of Sir Edward of Camarauan his
son. And yet said Merlin that he should make riueris ren i^ blod and with brayn.
and that seemed well in his weris there that he had the mastrie. And yet Merlin
said that there should cum a pepull out of the north west during the regne of
the forsaid dragon that should be lad by an ill grehound that should the dragon
croune king that afterward should fle over the sea for dread of the dragon with
out cummyng again. and^ that wos proved by sir Johan Bailloll that king Edward
made for to be king of Scotland that falsely arose ayens him and after he fled
un to his own lands of france and never he come again in to Scotland for dread
of king Edward And yet said Merlin that pepull that should led the forsaid
grehond should be faderles un till a certan time and^ he said soth for the
pepull of scotland greatly were disesed siith yt sir John^ bailloll there king
fled from scotland. And yet said Merlin yt the son should become in his time as
reed as any blood in tokenyng of great mortalite of pepull and yt was well know
when ye scottis were slain. And since said Merlin that ylke dragoij should norish
a fox that should meue great were ayens him that should not i^ his time be endid:
And that seemed well by Robert the Brus yt king Edward norished in his chamber
that sithene stale a way and meued great were against him which were wos not endid
i^ his time And afterward Merlin told that this dragon should been hold the best
body of all the world^ and he said sothe for the good king Edward wos the
worthiest knight of all the world in his time And yet said Merlin yt the dragon
should die in the march of an other land and that his land should be long
without any good keeper and yt me^ should weep for his death from the I Will of
shepei un to the I Will of marcill. Wherefore alas should be there song among the
common pepull fadetlas in the land wasted. And that profecie wos know ouerall
full well For the good king edward died at Burgh up sandis that is upon the
march of scotland wherefore the englisshme^ were discomforted and^ sorowed in
northhu^berland For encheso^ that king Edwardis son set by the scottis no force
for the riot of Perys of Ganaston wherefore Alas wos the song through out all
england for defaute of their good werdeyn. from the I Will of shepey un to the
I Will of marcill ye pepull made much sorrow for good king Edwardis death. For they
wened yt good king edward should have gone i^ to the holy land for yt was holy
his purpose. upon whose soul god for his high grace have inci

Of king Edward that wos king Edwardis son.
ANd after this king Edward reigned Edward his son that was borne in Carnariuan.
and this Edward went him in to france and there he spoused Isabell the kings
daughter of France the xxv. day of Ianiuer at the church of our ladi at
Boloyn in the year of our lord ihesu crist a.M.ccc.vij. And ye xx. day of
Feuyer the next year yt come after he wos crouned solempli at westmynstre of
the Erchebisshop Robert of wynchelse and of the erchebisshop off Cantorburi.
And there wos so great prece of pepull that sir johan bakwell wos deid and
mordred: And anon as the good king Edward was deid sir Edeward his son king of
england sent after Pers of Ganastane in to Gascoyn and so much loved him that
he called him his brother And anon after he yaf un to him the lordship of
walyngforde and it wos not long after that he ne yaf him the erldom of
Cornewaill ayens all the lordis will of the reame of england. And tho brought
he sir Walter of Langton bishop of Chestre in to prison in to the tour of
london with two knaves allone him to serve. For the king was wroth with him for
because yt sir walter made complaynte upon him to his fader. wherefore he was put
in to prison in the time of Troilebaston. And the forsaid Pers of Ganaston made
so great mastries that he went in to the kings tresorie in the abbey of
westmynster and took the table of gold with the tristyls of the same. and money
other rich Jewels that sum time were the nobull and good king Arthurs and^ took
the^ to a marchand that was called Aymeri of Friscombaand. For he should bear
them over see i^ to Gascoyne and so he went thens. and they come never again
after. wherefore it wos a great loose un to this land. And when this Pers wos so
richeli auaunced he be come so proud and so stout. wherefore all the great lordis
of the reame had him i^ dispite for his great bering. wherefore sir He^ri the
laci earl of Nicholl. and sir Guy earl of warrewik the which good lordis the
good king Edward sir Edwardis fader king of England charged that Peris of
Ganaston should not cum in to england for to bring his son Edward in to riot.
And all the lordis of England assemled them a certain day at the freris
prechours at London and there they spekyn of the dishonor that king Edward did
un to his reame and to his croune And so they assentid all both earls and
barons and all the commyns that the foresaid Pers of Ganastone should be exiled
out of England for ever more and so it wos done for he forswore England and
went in to Irlond and there the king made him chiuetayn and governor of the
land by his commission and theer this pers was cheuetayne of all the land. and
did there all that hi^ liked and had pouer what he would and that time were the
templars exiled through all cristinte for encheson that men put upon them that
they should done things ayens the faith and good beleue^ King Edward loved Pers
of Ganastone so much thatt he might not forlet his componye and so much the
king yaf and behight to the pepull of england that the exiling of the foresaid
peris should be revoked at stamford through them that him had exiled wherefore
peers of ganaston come again in to england and when he was come again in to his
land he despised the grettist lordis of this land and called sir Robert of
Clare earl of glocestre horeson And the earl of Nicholl sir henri the Lacy
brustynbely. and sir Guy earl of warwik the blak hound of Arderne. and^ also he
called the nobull earl and Thomas of Lancastre Churl and money oder scorns and
shame them said and money other great lordis of england Wherefore they were toward
hi^ full angri and wroth and right sore annoyed And i^ the same time died the
earl of Nicholl bot he charged or that he wos deid Thomas of Lancastre earl
that was his son in law that he should maynten his quarrel ayens this same Pers
of Ganaston upon his blissing. And so it befell through help of the earl of
Lancastre and also of the erll of werwic that the forsaid sir Pers wos hedid at
Gausich beside werwyk i^ the xix. day of June in the year of grace a.M.ccc.
and.xij. Wkrfor the king was sore annoyed and prayed god that he might se that
day to be a venged upon the death of the forsaid Pers. And so it befell
afteerward as ye shall here. Alas the time for the forsaid earl of Lancastre
and money other great barons were put to pytuus death and martired for encheso^ of
the forsaid quarrel The king wos tho at london and held a perlament and
ordained the laws of sir Symond Mounford wherefore the earl of Lancastre and the
earls and all clerge of england made an oath through counsel of Robert of
wynchelse for to maynten tho ordinances for ever more.

wroth and drew his sword on high and suore by almighty god and by his holy
names but if that he would go with them he should him sle there. The nobull and
gentill earl Thomas of Lancastre was sore adrad. and said fair sirs I will gone
with you whither so ever ye me bid. Tho went they to gedres in to the north
and^ with them they had vij.C. men of arms and come to Burbrugge And when sir
Andrew of herkela that was in the north cu^tre through ordinance of the king
for to keep the cuntre of scotland herd tell how that Thomas of lancastre wos
discomfited and his conpanye at Burton upon trent he ordyned him a strong pouer
and sir Symond ward also. that was tho shereue of york and met the baronnes at
burbrugge and anon they break the brugge that wos made of tree And when sir
thomas of Lancastre herd that sir Andrew of herkela had brought with him such
a pouer he was sore a drad and sent for sir andrew of herkela and with him spake^
and said to him in this manner. Sir andrew quod he ye mow well understand how
that our lord the king is lad and misgouerned by much falls council through sir
hugh the Spenser the fadre and sir hugh his son. and sir John^ earl of Arundell
and through master Robert Baldoke a falls piled clerk that now is in the kings
court duelling. Wherefore I pray you that ye would cum with us with all the pouer
that ye have ordened and help to distro the venym of England and the tratours
that been therein and we will give un to you all the best part of.v. erledoms
that we have and holds: and we will make un to you an oath that we will never
done thing with out your council and so ye shall been eft as well with us as
ever wos Robert of Holand. Tho ansuerd sir Andrew of herkela and said sir
Thomas that would not I done ne consent there to for no manner thing ye might me
yeffe without the will and commandment of our lore the king for than should I
be holden a tratour for ever more. And when that the nobull Earl Thomas of
Lancastre saw that he would not consent un to him for no manner thing. sir Androw
he said will ye not consent for to distroye the venym of the reame as we be
consent now at one word sir Androw I tell the that or this year be gone that
ye shall be take and hold for a traitor and more than any of you hold us now
and in wors death ye shall die than ever did any knight of England And
understand well that ye did never thing that sorer ye shall you repent. and
now goth and^ does what you good likes And I will put me in to the mercy of
god And so went the false traitor tirant and as a falls for sworin maij. for
through the noble Earl Thomas of Lancastre he vnderfenge the arms of chiualri
and through hi^ he wos made a knight Tho might men see archeris draw them in
that one side and in that other. and knights also and foughten tho to gedre
wonder sore and also among other sir Humfrey de Boughon Earl of herford a
worthy knight of renoune through all cristyndome stood and fought with his enmys
upon the bruge and as the nobull lord stood and faught upon the brugge a thief
a ribaude skulked under the brugge and fersly with a spear smote the nobull
knight in to the fou^dement so that his bouell is comen out a bout his fete
there. Alas for sorrow for there was slain the flour of solace and of comforth and
also of courtesy. And sir Roger of Clifford a nobull knight stood ever and
faught and well and worthily him defendid as a nobull baron. But at the last he
was sore wounded in his head and sir willm of Sullay and sir Roger of bernefeld
were slain at that bataill When sir Androw of herkela saw that sir Thomas men of
lancastre lassed and slaked anon he and his compani comen un to the gentill
knight sir Thomas of Lancastre and said un to him in high yield the tratoure
yield the. The gentill Earl ansuerid tho and said. Nay lordis trators be we none
and to you will we never us yield while that our lives last but lever we have to
be slain in our treuth than yield us un to you: And sir Androw again guard upon
sir Thomas componi yollyng as a wode wolf and^ said yield you tratours taken
yield you. And said with an high vois beth war sires that none of you be so
hardy upon life and limme to mysdone Thomas bodi of Lancastre And with that
word the good Earl Thomas went i^ to the chapel and said kneling upon his
knees and^ turned his visage toward the cross and said Almighty god to the I
me yield and holli I put me un to thy merci. And with that the vileyns and
ribaudes leped a boute him on every side as tirantis and wode turme^tours and
dispolid him of his armurie and clothed him in a robe of rey that was of his
squyers liueira and forth lad him un to york by water. Tho might men se much
sorrow and^ care. for thee gentill knyghtis fled in every side and^ the ribaudis
and^ the vileyns egreli them discried and gried an high yield you tratours yield
you. And when they were yolden they were robbed and bound as thefues Alas the
shame and dispite that the gentill ordir of knyghthod there had at that bataill
and the land was tho with out law: for holy church tho had no more reuerance
than it had been a brodell house and in that bataill was the fadre ayens the
sone. and the uncle ayens his nepheu For so much vnkyn denes was never seyn
before in England as wos that time among folk of one nation. For on kynrad had
no more pit of that other than an hungri wolf has of a sheep and it wos no
wonder For the great lordis of england were not all of one nation but were meddled
with other nations that is for to say some Bretans some Saxons some Danys some
Pehites some Frensshemen some Normans some Spanyardis some Romans some Henaudes
some Flemmyng and other diverse nations the which nations accordid not to the
kind blod of england And if so great lordis had been only weddid to english
pepull than should pees have been and rest among them with out any envy. And
at that bataill was roger Clifford take sir John^ monbray sir willm Tuchit sir
willm Fitz willm and^ mo^y other worthy knyghtys there were take at yt bataill
And sir hugh Dandell the next day after wos taken and^ put i^ to prison and
should have be done to death if he had not spoused the kings nece that was earl
Gilbertis sustre of Glocestre And ano^e after wos sir Bartholomew of badelsmere
taken at stowe paarke a manner of the bisshoppis of Lyncolne yt wos his nepheu.
and^ money other barons and^ baner^ttz wherefore wos made much sorrow.

How Thomas of Lancastre wos heded at poun^fret and.v. barons honged and drawn
there.
ANd now I shall tell you of the nobull earl Thomas of Lancastre. when he wos
taken and brought to york mo^y of the Cite were full glad. and upon him cried
with an high vois O sir traitor ye er welcome blissid be god. for now shall ye
have the reward that long time ye have deserved. and cast upon him money snow
balls and money other reproues they did him. bot the gentill earl all suffered
and^ said nothir on word ne other: And in the same time the king herd of this
same scomfiture and wos full glad and^ in have come to Pou^tfret and sir hugh
spenser and sir hugh his son and sir John^ earl of Arundell. and^ sir Edmond of
wodestoke the kings brother earl of Kent: and sir Aymer of valaunce earl of
Penbroke and master Robert Baldoke a falls piled clarke that was prive and
duellid in the kings court. and all come theder with the king. and the king
entered i^ to the castle And sir Andrew of Herkela a falls tirant through the
kings commandment took with him the gentill earl Thomas to Pou^tfret. and^
there he was prisoned in his own castle that he had new made that stood again
the abbey of king Edward. And sir hugh the spenser the fader and his son cast
and^ thought how and in what manner the good earl Thomas of Lancastre should be
deed with out any Judgment of his perys Wherefore it was ordened through the
kings Justices yt the king should put upon him points of treson. And so it
befell yt he was led to bar before the ki^gis Justice barehed as a thef in a
fair hall in his own castle yt he had made there in mo^y a fair fest both to
rich and to poer. And these were his Iustises sir Hugh spenser the father. and
Aymer of valau^ce earl of peenbroke. sir Edmond of wodestoke earl of kent. sir
John^ of Bretan earl of Richemond and sir Robert of Malemethrop Justice. and
sir roberte him a coulpid in this manner. Thomas at the frist. owr lord the king
and this court excludes you of all manner ansuere. Thomas our lord the king
puts upon you that ye have in his land riden with banner displayed ayens his
pes as a tratoure And with that word the gentill earl Thomas with an high vois
said nay lordis forsooth and by sent Thomas I was never traitor The Justice
said again tho. Thomas our lord the king puteth upon you that ye have robbed his
folk and mordred his pepull as a thief. Thomas also the king put upon you that
he discomfited you and your pepull with his folkd in his own reame. wherefore ye
went and fled to the wodde as an outlawe. And also ye were taken as an outlawe.
And Thomas as a traitor ye shall be hanged by reason. but the king has for yef
you that Jews for love of queen Isabell And thomas reason would also that ye
should be hanged but the king has for yef you that Jews for cause and love of
your lineage But Thomas For os much as ye were take fleyng and^ as an outlaw the
king will that your head shall be smite of as ye have well deserved Anon does
him out of prece and anon bring him to his judgment. The gentill knight Thomas
had herd all these wordis with an high vois he cried sore weeping and said alas
sent thomas fair fader Alas shall I be deed thus Grant me now blissidfoll god
ansuer: but all a vailled him nothing: For the cursed Gascoyns put him hither
and thedder and on him cried with an high vois O king Arthur most dreadful well
knawen is now thyn open traitorie an evil death shall thou die has thou have
it well diseruyed And tho they set vpen his head in scorn an hold chapelet that
wos all to rent that wos not worth an half pen. And after that they set him
upon a leave white palfra full un semeli and eke all bare and with an hold
bridell and with an horribul noise they drove him out of the Castle toward his
death and they cast upon him money balls of snow i^ disspite And as the
traitoris lad him out of the Castle tho said he this pytouse wordis and his
hands held up on hight toward the heaven: Now the king of heaven yef us merci.
for the erthely king has us forsakyn. And a friar prechour wenten with him out
of the castle till that he com to the place that he endid his life un to whom
he shrofe him all his life And the gentill earl held the friar wonder fast by
the clothis and said to him fair fadre abide with us till that I be deed. for
my flesh quaketh for dread of death. And the soth for to say the gentill earl
set him upon his knees and turned him toward the est. but a ribaud that was
called Higone of Moston set hand upon the gentill earl and said in despite of
him. Sir traitor turn the toward the scotts thy soul deed to vnderfenge.
and turned him toward the North. The nobull earl Thomas ansuered tho with a
myld vois and said now fair lordis I shall done your will. And with that woide
the friar went from him sore weeping. and anon a ribaude went to him and smote
of his head. the xi. Kal. of Auerell in the year of greece.M.ccc. and xxi. Alas
that ever such a ge^till blod shall be done to death with out cause and reason.
And tratorsly wos the king cou^cellid when he through the false counsel of ye
spe^sers suffered sir Thomas his uncles son to be put to such a death and so been
heded ayens all manner of reason. and great pit it was also that such a nobull
king should be desceiued and mysgouerned through counsel of the fallis
spenseres the which tho he mai^teneyd through loselrie ayens his honor and eke
profit. For afterward there fell great vengeance in england for encheson of the
foresaid Thomas death. When the gentill earl of his life was passid. The priour
and the monkis of Pountfret getten the body of sir Thom^s of the king and they
beried it before the high auter on the right side^ That same day that this
gentill knight was deed. there were honged and draw for the same quarrel at

How king Edward went in to scotland with an hondreth thousand men of arms
and^ might not speed.
ANd when king edward of england had brought the flour of Chivalry un to there
death through council and consent of sir hugh spenser the fadre and sir hugh the
son he become as wode as any Lion And what so ever the Spensers would have it
was done. so well the king loved them that they might done with him all thing
that them liked. Wherefore the king yaf un to sir hugh spenser the fadre. the
erledom of wynchestre and un to sir Andrewe of Herkela the erdom of Cardoill in
prejudice and in harmyng of his croune: And king Edward tho through consell of
the spensers disherited all them that had been ayens him in any quarrel with
Thomas of Lancastre and money oder were disherited also for encheson stat the
spensers couetted for to have there lands and so they had all that they would
desire with wrong and ayens all reason Tho made the king Robert of Baldok a falls
piled clerk Chauncelar of england through caunsell of the forsaid spensers and
he was a falls ribaud and a couetise and^ so they cou^celed the king much that
the king let take to his own ward all the goodis of the lordis that were put
wrongfully to the death in to his own hond and as well they token the goodis
that were in holy church as the goodis that were without. And let them been put
in to his tresorie in london and let them call his forfaittis and by there
council the king wrought for evermore he dysherite them that the goodis
owghten. And through there counsel let a rere a talliage of all the goodis of
england Wherefore he was the richest king that ever wos in england after willm
basterd of Norma^die that conquerid England* And yet through council of them
him seemed that he had not enough. bot made yet every town of England for to
find a man of armies upon there own costages for to gone and were upon the
scottis that were his enmys wherefore the king went in to scotland with an
hondreth thausand me^ of arms at witsontide in the year of our lord Ihu^
crist.M.ccc. and xxij. But the scottis went and hid them in mou^tayns and^ in
woddis and tarried the englishmen fro day to day that the king might for no
manner thing them find in plain feld Wherefore money englismen yt had litell
vitayles died there for hunger wonder fast and suddenly in going and in coming.
and namly tho that had been ayens Thomas of Lancastre and robbed his men upon
his landis: When king Edward saw that vitayles failed him he wos tho wonderfore
discomforted for encheson also that his men died and for he might not speed of
his enmys So at the last he come again in to England. And anon after come James
Douglas and also Thomas Randulph with an hoge host in to England in to
Northumberland and with them the englishmen that were driven out of england and
come and robbed the cu^tre and killed the pepull. and also brend the town that
wos called northallerton and^ money other tou^es to york. And when the king
herd this tidyng he let sompne all manner men that might travel. And so the
englishmen met the scottis at the abbey of Beigheland the xv. day after
Mihelmasse in the same year abouesaid. And the englishmen were there discomfited.
And at yt scomfiture wos took sir Johan of Bretan Earl of Rochemond that held
the cuntre and the Erldom of Lancastre. And after he paid an huge ransom and
wos let go. and after that he went in to france and come never afterward again.

How sir Andrewe of Herkela was take and^ put un to the death that wos earl of
Cardoill.
ANd at that time sir Andrew of herkela that new was made earl of Cardoill for
cause that he had taken the good earl Thomas of Lancastre. he had ordained
through the kings conmandement of england for to bring him all the pouer that
he might for to help him against the scottis at the abbey of Beigheland And when
the false tratour had gadred all the pepull that he might and should have come to
the king un to the abbey of Beigheland The false tratour lad them by an other
cuntre through Copeland and through the erledom of Lancastre. and went through the
cuntre and robbed and^ killed folk all that he might And forther more the false
tratour had taken a great soume of gold and silver of sir James Douglas for to
be ayens the king of england and to been helpyng and holdyng with the scottis
through whose treson the king of england wos discomfited at Beigheland or that he
come theder Wherefore the king wos toward him wonder wroth. and let priueli
enquere by the cuntre about. how that it wos^ And so men enquerid and aspied so
at the last truth was found and sought and he atteynt and take as a falls
tratour. as ye good earl Thoms of Lancastre him told. or that he were put un to
death at his taking at burbrugge: And to him said or that year were done he should
be take and hold a tratour And so it wos as the holy man said. wherefore the king
sent preueli to sir Anthoyn of Lucy a knight of the cuntre of Cardoill that he
should take sir Andrew of Harkela and put him un to the death And to bring this
thing un to the end the king sent his commission. So that this same Andrew was
take at Cardoill and^ led un to the bar in the manner of an earl worthily
arrayed and^ with a sword gurt about hi^ and hosed and^ spored. Tho spak sir
Anthoyn in this manner sir Andrew quod he. the king put upon the for as much as
thou have been orped in thy dedis he ded to the much honor and made the earl
of Cardoill and thou as a traitor to thy lord the king and ladest his pepull
of his cuntre that should have help him at the bataill of Beiland and thou
ladest them a way by the cuntre of Copeland and through the Erledom of of
lancastre. Wherefore our lord the king was discomfited there of the scottis through
thy treson and falsenesse And if thou hadest comen be times he had had the
bataill. and treso^ thou did for the great soume of gold and silver that
thou vnderfenge of James Douglas a scot the kings enmye. And our lord the king
will that the ordir of knyghod by the which thou vnderfeng all thyn honoor and
worship upon thy body be al brought to naught and thy estate undone. that other
knyghttes of lawer degree mow after be war: the which lord has the a vau^ced
hugli in diverse cuntreis in England. and yt all may take exsample by ye there
lord afterward trewly for to serve. Tho commanded he a knave anon to hew of
his spors on his heles And after he let brake the swerd over his head the which
the king yaf him to keep and^ defend his land there with when he had made him
earl of Cardoill. And after he let him be unclothed of his furred tabard and^
of his hode and of his furred cotes and of his gurdel. and when this wos don
sir Antonye said un to him Andrew quod he now art thou no knight bot a knave
and^ for thy treson the king will that thou shall been honged and draw and^
thyn head smyten of. and^ thy bowelels taken out of thy body and^ brent before
the and thy body quartired and thyn he desent to london and there it shall stond
upon london brigge and the.iiij. quarters shall be sent to iiij. tou^es of
england that all other may be war and^ chastised by the. And as Antonye said so
it was done all manner thing in the last day of October. In the year of
grace.M:ccc. and xxij. year. And the sone turned in to blod as the pepull it
saw and that durid from the morn till it was xi: of the cloak of the day.

Of the miracles that god wrought for sent thomas of Lancastre wherefore the
king let close in the church doris of the Priore of pountfret yt no man should
cum therein to the body for to offren.
ANd sone after that the good earl Thomas of Lancastre was martired. there was a
pressed that long time had be blind dremed in his slepyng that he should gone un
to the hill there yt the good earl thomas of lancastre wos done un to death and
he should have his sight again. and so he dremed.iij: nyghtis fewyng. And the
pressed let led him to the same hill. And when he com to that place that he was
martirid on. full devoutly he made there his prayers and^ prayed god and^ sent
Thomas that he might have his sight again. and os he was in his prayers he laid
his right hand upon the same place yt the good man was martired on. and^ a
drope of dry blod and small sand cleued on his hand and there with striked his
eeyn And anon through the might of god and of sent Thomas of Lancastre he had
his sight again. and thanked tho almighty god and sent Thomas And when this
miracle wos known among men. the pepull come thider on every side and knelid
and made there prayers at his toumbe that is in the priorie of pountfret. and
prayed that holy merter of socour and of help and god herd there prayer. Also
there wos a young child drenched in a well in the town of pou^tfret and wos
deed.iij. dais and^ iij. nyghtis and men come and^ laid the deid child upon
sent Thomas tomb the holy marter. and the child arose from death to live: as
money a man it saw. And also much pepull were out of there mind and god has sent
them there mind again through uertu of that holy martyr. And also god has yeuen
there also to crippils there going and^ to crokid there handis and there fete and
to blind also there sight^ and^ to money seek folk there health of diverse
maladies for the love of this good martyr. Also there wos a rich man in Coundom
in gascoyn. and^ such a malady he had that all his right side roted and fell
away from hi^. yt men might se his liver and his heart. and so he stonke that
uneath men might cu^ ny hi^. wherefore his fre^dis were for hi^ wonder sori. bot
at the last as god would they praid to sent Thomas of lancastre yt he would prai
to almighty god for that prisoner and^ behight to go to Pountfret for to done
there pilgrimage he thoht yt the mertir sent Thomas co^ to him and anointed
over all his sike body. And there with the good man awoke and wos all hole. and
his flesh wos restorid again that before wos roted and fallen away. For which
miracle the good man and his fre^dis loved god and sent Thomas ever mere after.
And this good man come i^ to england and^ took with hi^. iiij: fellows and come
to pou^tfret un to yt holy marter and^ did there pilgrimage and^ the good man yt
was seek come theder all naked safe his prive clothis. And when they had done
they turned home again i^ to there own cu^tre and told of the miracle where so
ever that they come. And also ij. me^ have be heled there of the mormale through
help of yt holy marter though yt evil be holde^ incurabull And when ye
spensers herd yt god did such miracles for this holy man and they nold be leave
it i^ no manner wise* bot said ope^li yt it was great heresi such virtue of hi^
to believe. And when sir hugh ye spenser the son saw all this doing ano^e he
sent his messanger from pountfret there that he duellid to ye king Edward that
tho wos at Graven at Scipton for cause that the king should undo that
pilgrimage. And os the ribaud the messi^ger went toward the king for to done
his message he come by the hill there the good marter was don to death. and^ in
the same place he made his ordure. And when he had don he went toward the king.
and a strong flix come upon him or that he come to york. and tho he shed all
his bowels at his fou^dement. And when sir hugh the spenser herd this tydi^g
somedele he was a drad. and^ thought for to un do the pilgrimage if he might by
any manner way. And ano^e to the king he went and said that they should be in
great sklander through out all cristi^dom for the death of Thomas of Lancastre if
that he suffered the people to do there pilgrimage at pountfret. and^ so he
cou^celled the king that he commanded to closse the church doors of pountfret
in the which church the holy marter sent Thomas was entered. and thus they did
again all frau^chises of holy church. so that^ iiij. year after might no
pilgrim cu^ un to yt holy body And for encheson that the monkis suffered men to
cu^ and honor that holy body of sent Thomas the martyr. through co^cell of sir
hugh spenser the son. and through counsel also of master Robert Baldoke the false piled clarke that wos the kings chauncelar the king consentid that they
should be set to there wages and let make wardeyns over there own good long time:
and through co^ma^dement of the forsaid sir hugh the spenser xiiij. Gascoynes
well armed kept the hill there that the good man sent Thomas was done un to his
death so that no pilgrame might cum by that way. Full well went he to have be
take cristis might: and^ his pouer and the great boos of miracles that he showed
for his marter Sent Thomas through all cristyndom And that same time ye king
made Robert of Baldok the false piled clarke through prayer of sir hugh the
spenser the son Chau^celar of england. And in the same time was the castle of
Walynford holde^ ayens the king through the prisoners that were within the

that held with Thomas of lancastre through the traitors were undone and all there
heirs disherred.

there for no manner thing as he had set him self and assigned. And notheles the
barons sent un to him o time and other. And he suore by godis soul that he
nold not cu^ there on foot. Wherefore it wos ordained by all the great lordis of
england yt he should no longer be king but be deposid and said that they would
croune Edward his sone the elder king. yt wos ye duke of Gnyhenne. and sent
tydyng un to the king there yt he was in ward under sir Johan earl of Garen and

Of the prophecy of Merlin declarid of king edward the sone of king edward the
frist.
OF this king Edward prophesied Merlin and said that there should cum a Goot out
of Carre that should have horns of silver and a berd as white as snow* and a
doppe should cum out of his nosethriles that should betoken much harm hounger
and death of the pepull. and^ great loss of his land: and that in the beginning
of his regne should be hau^ted much lechorie. And he said soth alas the time for
king edward that was king edward son was bonre at Carnariuan in wales. for soth
he had horns of silver and a berd as white os snow. when he was made prince of
walis. to much he yaf hi^ to riot and^ to folly. And soth said Merlin in his
prophecy that there should cum out of his nose a doppe. for in his time was
great honger among the poer pepull. and strong death among the rich that died in
strange land with much sorrow and^ i^ were in scotland. and afterward he lost
scotland and gascoyn. and whiles that him self wos king there wos much lechori
hau^ted: And also Merlin told and said that this Goot should seche the flour of
life and of death. And he said soth. for he spoused Isabell the kings sustre of
france. And in his time Merlin said that they should be made brigges of folk
upon diches of the se. And that was well seyn at Banokkes borne in scotland
when he was discomfited there of the scottis And Merlin told also that stones
should fall from castles and money tounes should be made plain. And he said soth
for when king Edward wos discomfited in scotland and come tho southward the
scottis beseged tho castles and did them much harm and brend tounes un to the
herd earth: And afterward Merlin told that an Egle should cum out of Cornwaill
that should have fetherris of gold that of pride should have no peir. and he
should despise lordis of blod. and after he should die through a bear at Gausich:
and that propheci was full well know and found soth. For by the egle is
understand sir Pers of Ganaston that tho wos earl of Cornewaill that was a
wonder proud man that despised the baronage of england. but afterward he was
heded at gausich through the earl of Lancastre and through the earl of werwik.
And Merlin told that i^ his time it should seem that the bear should brenne and
that bataill sh^old be upon an arm of the sea in a feld araied like a sh^eld
where should die money whit hedis. And he said soth for by the brenni^g of the
bear is betokened great dred through cuttyng of swerdis at that bataill of miton
for there come the scottis in manner of a sheld in manner of a wynge and slew upon
swale men of religion prestis and^ seculers wherefore the Scottis called that
bataill in dispite of englismen the white bataill. And after merli^ said yt ye
forsaid bear should do the Goot much harm and that should be upon the southwest
and also upon his blod and said also that the goot should lose mich dele of his
land till the time that shame should him over cum and than he should cloth him in
a Lion skyn and^ should wyn again that he had lost and more through pepull that
should cum out of the northwest that should make him to been adrad and him a
venge upon his enmys through council of ij. Owls that frist sh^old be in
perell to be undone And that tho two Owls should wend over the sea in to a
strange land and there they should duel un till a certan time and^ after they
should cum i^ to england again. And tho two Owls should do much harm un to mo^y
on and^ yt they should co^cell the goot to meue were ayens the foresaid bear.
And ye got and the owls should cu^ to an arm of the sea at borton up Trent
and^ should wend over and^ yt for dread ye bear should fle with a Swan i^ his
company to Buri toward the north through an unkind outpul^ter and that the Swan
than shall be slain with sorrow and the Bear should be slain full ny his own
nest that sh^old stond upon Pou^tfret upon whom the son shall shed his bemes
and money folk him shall seek for virtue and he said soth for the good earl
Thomas of Lancastre was borne in the northwest and^ cousin to the king and his
uncle son. And by law he made the king lose much land the which he had purchesed
wilfulli till at the last the king there of took shame and him self filled with
cruelte And after he gat again yt he had lost and much more through folk that he
let assemble out of the northwest yt made him to be adrad and a venged him of
his barons through counsel of sir hugh the spenser the fadre and of sir hugh
the son that be fore were out lawed of england for there wikkednes Bot afterward
they cume again in to engloed sir hugh spenser the fadre out of france And so
much co^celed the king that he should were upon Thomas of Lancastre So that the
king and the spensers and the earl of Arundell and there pouer met with Thomas
of Lancastre at Burton upon Trent and him there discomfited and sir Humfry Earl
of Herford wos in his company. And after fled the forsaid Thomas and Humfrey
with there company at Burbruge with sir Andrew of erkela that is called the
unkind outpulter And also sir Symondward earl of york they come and mete with
Thomas of lancastre with an huge company and them there discomfited. and^ in
that scomfiture the earl of herford wos slain upon the bruge couherdly with a
spear in the foundement And the earl Thomas wos take and lad un to Pau^tfret.
and tho was heded beside his own castle. But afterward money men him sought for
miracles that god did for him. And in that time Merli^ said for sorrow and harm
should die a pepull of his land. wherefore money other landis should be upon him
the more bolder And he said soth for by encheson of his barons that were done to
death. for sent thomas quarrel of lancastre pepull of money landis become the
bold for to meue were upon the king: for there blod wos turned to mo^y nations
And afterward Merlin told and^ said that the forsaid Owls should do much harm
un to the floor of life and death. and they should bring her to much disese. so
yt she should we^d over se i^ to france for to make pees to ye flour delise.
and^ there should a bide till on a time her sede should cum and sech her. And tho
they should a biden both till the time that they should cloth them with grace:
and^ tho two Owls she should seek and^ put them un to pytuus death. and that
prophecy wos well know and was full soth. For sir Hugh spenser the fadre and
sir hugh the sone did much sorrow and persecucion un to the queen Isabell through
her procurment to her lord the king. So they ordained among that she was put
un to her wages that is to say.xx. sh^ylling in the day. Wherefore the king of
france her brother was sore annoyed and sent in to england by his letters un
to king Edward that he should come un to his perlament to Paris in france. but
king Edward was sore adrade to cum there. for he wened to have been arested till
that he had made amendis for the trespase that sir hugh spenser the fadre and
the sone had done. And for the harm that they had done un to thee queen
Isabell his sustre. Wherefore through her ordeynaunce and^ consent of the spensers
the queen Isabell went over se i^ to france for to make accord bitwen king
Edward and the king of france her brother And there duel^led she in france
till edward her eldest son come her to sech and^ so they duelled there both till
yt aliance was made bitwen them and the gentill earl of Henaud. that if they with
there help might destroi and^ over cu^ the venym and^ the falsenes of the
spensers yt sir edward should spouse Dame Philip the worsshipfull lady and^ the
earls daughter of henaud. Wherefore the queen Isabell and^ sir edward her son and
sir edward of wodstoke the kings brother of England and sir John^ of henaud
and^ sir Roger Mortimer of wigmore and sir Thomas Rocelin and sir John^ of
Cro^well and sir willm Trussell and money other of the a liaunce of the ge^till
earl Thomas of Lancastre that were exiled out of england for his quaril and were
disherited of there landis ordained them a great pouer and arrived at herewich in
southfolke. And sone after they pursued the spensers till that they were takyn
and put un to spitouse death as before is said and there company a^ also for the
great falsenes yt they did to king edward and to his pepull. And Merlin said
also more that the goot should be put i^to great disese and in great anguysh and^
in great sorrow he should led his life. And he said soth for aftir the time that
king edward wos take he was put in to ward till that the spensers were put un to
the death. And also for encheson that he would not cum un to his own perlament at
london as he had ordened and assigned himself and to his baronage and also would
not govern and rule his pepull ne his ream as a king should done: Wherefore sum
of the barons of england come and^ yield up there hamages un to him for them and
all the other of the ream in the day of conversion of sent paul in the year of
his regne xx and^ they put him out of his rialte for ever more and ever he
leued his life afterward in much sorrow and anguyssh.

LOdewicus the fourth wos emprour after Henri iiij. year This Lodewic wos duke

Of king Edward the third after the conquest
ANd after this king Edward Carnariuan reigned sir edward of windesore his son
the which wos crouned king and anointed at westmynstre through council and
consent and will of all the great lordis of the Reame the sunday in Candelmasse
eve in the year of grace.M:CCC.xxvi. that was of age at yt time but xv. year.
and for encheson that his fadre was in ward in the castle of kenilworth and
eke wos put down of his rialte. the reame of england was with out king fromme
the fest of sent Katerin in the year abouesaid un to the fest of Candelmasse
and^ tho were all manner plees of the kings bynch astent. And tho wos commanded
to all the shereues of england through writ to warn the perties to defendau^tis
through somnyng again And also forthermore that all prisoners that were in the
king gail^les yt were attached through shereues should be let gone quyte. The
king Edward after his coronacion at the prayer and besechi^g of his liege of
the reame grau^tid them a chartre of steadfast pees to all them yt would it axe.
And sir john^ of Henaud and^ his company took there leave of ye king and^ of the
lordis of the reame: and turned home to there own co^tre again: and each of them
had full rich yeftes ever ych man as he wos of value and estate And tho wos
england i^ pees and^ i^ rest and^ great love bitwene the king and his lordis:
and comynly english men said among them that the deuell was deed. But the
tresour of the king his fadre and the tresour of spensers both the fadre and of
the son and of the earl of Arundell and^ of master Robert baldok yt wos the
kings chancelar was depertid after the queen Isabellis ordenaunce and Sir
Roger Mortimers of wigmore. so that the king had nothing there of but at her
will and^ her deliverance ne of there landis as afterward ye shall here.

How king Edward went to stanthop for to mete the scottis.
ANd yet in the same time was king Edward in the Castle of Kenilworth under
the keeping of sir Henri that was Earl Thomas brother of Lancastre that tho wos
earl of Leycestre and the king grauntid him the Erledom of Lancastre that the
king his fadre had seized in to his hand and put out Thomas of Lancastre his
brother. And so was he earl of Lancastre and^ of Leicestre and^ eke stiward of
england as his brother wos in his time. but sir Edward that wos king edwardis
fadre made sorrow with out end. for because he might not speak with his wife ne
with his sone wherefore he wos i^ much mischief. for though it were so that he wos
lad and^ ruled by falls council yet he wos king Edwardis so ne called edward
with long schankis and^ come of the worthiest blood of the world And they to
whom he wos woned to give great yeftes and^ large were most p^ue with the king his
own son: and^ they were his enmys both by night and by day and^ procurid to make
debate and co^take bytwen hi^ and his son. and^ Isabell his wife. bot the friar
prechours to hi^ were good fre^dis evermore and cast both by night and^ by day
how they might bring hi^ out of prison And among there company yt the freris had
priueli brought there wos a friar that was called Dunhened and^ he had ordained
and gadred a great company of folk to keep at yt need. but the frer wos take
and put i^ the castle of pou^fret and there he died in prison. And sir henri
earl of Lancastre that had the kings fadre i^ keeping through commandment of
the king delivered Edward the kings fader by ende^tur to sir Thomas of
berkeley. And so sir John^ Mautreus and^ they led him from the castle of
kemlworth to the castyll of Berkeley and kept him there saufly. And at Estren
next after his coronacio^ the king ordyned a huge host for to fight ayens the
scottis. And sir John^ ye Earls brother of heenaud from be yond the se come for
to help king Edward and brought with hi^ vij. houdreth men of arms and arrived
at dover and they had leave for to go forth till they come to york there yt thee
king them abode And the scottis come theder to the king for to make pees and
accorde^ but the accordement lasted not bitwein tham bot a litell time. And at
that time the englisshmen were clothed all in cotes and^ hodes peynted with
lettres and^ with flowers full semeli with long berdes And therefore the scottis
made a bill that wos fastyned upon the chirch doris of sent Petre toward
stangate and thus said the scripture in dispite of englishmen.

Long berde hertles: Painted hod witles. Gay cote gracelas makes england
thriftles.

ANd i^ the Trinite day next after began the contake in the cite of york
bitwen the englisshmen and the Henaudires. and in that debate were killed of the
erledom of Nycholl and mordred lxxx. and after they were buried under a stone in
sent Clementis chirchhawe in fosgate And for encheso^ that the henauders come
to hel^p the king. there pees wos cried on pain of life and^ limme And in that
other half it wos found by an enquest of the cite that the englishmen began
the debate:

How the englishmen stoppid the scottis in the park of stanhope and how they
turned again in to scotland.
ANd at that time the scottis had assembled all there pouer and comen in to
england and killed and robbed all thatt they might take and also brennet and
distroid all the north cuntre through out till that they come un to the park of
stanhope in wyredall and there the Scottis held them in a buschement. But when
the king had herd through certain aspies where the Scottis were anon right with
his host beseged them within the forsaid park so that the scottit wist not
where to gone out but only un to there harmis and they abiden in the park xv.
days and^ vitales them failed in every side so that they were gretli appaired of
there bodies. And since that Brut come first in to bretan un to this tym wos there
never seyn so fair an host what of Englisshmen and of a lyens and of men of
foot the which ordained them for to fight with the scottis through eggyng of sir
Henri earl of Lancastre and of sir Johan henaude that would have gone over the
water of with for to have foughten with the scottis But sir Roger Mortimer
co^sentid not there to. For he had privily takyn mede of the scottis the^ for to
help that they might wend away again in to there own cuntre. And this same
Mortimer councelled so much Thomas of Brotherton the earl marshall that was
king Edwardis uncle that the fersaid Thomas should not assembull at that time un
to the scottis and he assentid. but he wist not the doing bitwene the scottis
and the forsaid Mortimer And for encheson that he was marshall of England and
to him perteyned ever the vauntward he sent hasteli to the earl of Lancastre
and to sir Johan of henaud that they should not fight with the Scottis in
prejudice and harmyng of him and his fee. And if they did that they should stond
to there own perrill And the forsaid earl marshall was al araied with his
bateill at the reredoos of the earl of Lancastre for to have fought with him
and with his folk if he had meued for to fight with the proud scottis And in
this manner he was deceived and wist nothing of this treson. And thus was the
king principalli dissaued. And when it wos night Mortimer that had the wach for
to keep of the host that night distrobled the wach that nothing might be done
And i^ the mei^ while the scottys stole be night toward there own cuntre as fast
as they might And so wos the king falsely betrayed that wened that all the
traitors of his land had been brought to an end as it wos said before Now here
ye lordis how tratoursly king Edward was dissaued and^ how meruelusly and^
boldly the scottis did of were. for Iamys Douglas with.CC. men of arms riden
through aut all the host of gyng Edward the same night the scottis were ascaped
toward there own cuntre as is above said till that they com to the kings
pauilon and^ killed there money men in there beddis and cried some Naward naward.
and an oder time a Douglos a douglas. Wherefore the king that wos in his pauilon
and mech oder folk were wonder sore afraied. but blyssid be almighty god ye
king wos not taken and in great parell was tho the ream of england And yt night
the moon shone full clear and bright. and for all the kings me^ the scottis
ascappid harmeles And i^ ye morrow wha^ ye king wist yt the scottis were a
scappid i^ to there own cuntre. he wos wonder sori and^ full hertely wepid with
his young eyn. and^ yet wist he not who had hi^ done yt treson. bot yt fal^s
tresoun was full well know a good while after as the stori tells Tho king
edward come again to york full sorrowful and his host deperted and every man
went in to his own cuntre with full heavy chere and morning semblant and the
henaudes took there leave and^ went i^ to there own cuntre. and the king for there
travel hugeli them rewardid And for encheson of that viage the king had
dispendid much of his tresour and wasted And in that time were seyn ij: mones in
the firmament that on was clear and that other was derke as men might se through
out the world and a great debate wos yt same time ayens pope Johan the xxij:
after sent petre. and^ the Emprour of Almayn tho made him Emprour ayens the
popis will that tho held his see at Auinion Wherefore the e^pror made his cry at
Rome and ordained an oder pope yt hight Nycholas yt wos a friar mynor. and yt
was ayens the right of holy chirch Wherefore he wos cursed and the pouer of that
oder pope sone wos leid: And for encheso^ that such meruellis were seyn me^
said that the world was nygh at an end.

Of the death of king Edward Carnariuan.
ANd now go we again to sir Edward of Carnariuan yt was king Edward fadre sum
time king of england and put down of his dyngnite: Alas for his tribulacion
and sorrow that him befell through falls council that he loved and triftid upon
to much that afterward were destroyed thugh there falsenesse as god would. And
this Edward of Carnariuan wos in the castle of Berkelay under the keeping of
Sir Moris of Berkeley and sir Johan of Mautreus and to them he made his
complaynt of his sorrow and of his disese and often time he axed of his wardens
what he had trespased ayens Dame Isabell his wife and Sir edward his son yt was
made new king yt they would not viset him And tho ansuerid on of his wardeynes
and said: my worthy lord displese you not that I shall tell you the encheson is
for it is done them to understand that if my lady your wife come any thing ny
you that ye would her strangle and kill and also that ye would do to my lord your
son the same Tho ansuered he with simple chere. Alas alas am I not i^ prison
and all at your own will. now god hit wot I thought it never and now I would
that I were deed so would god if that I were. for than were all my sorrow passed Hit
was not long time after that the king through concell of Roger Mortimer grau^tid
the ward and kepi^g of sir edward his fadre un to sir Thomas Toiourney and^ to
the forsaid sir John^ Mautreuers through the kings lettre and put out holy the
forsaid sir Morice of the ward of the king and they took and^ led the king un
to the castle of Corfe the which castle the king hated as any death and they
keped hi^ there till it come un to sent Mathewes day i^ septe^bre in ye year of
grace.M.ccc.xxvij. yt the forsaid sir Roger Mortimer sent the manner of the death
how and^ in what wise he sh^old be done to death. And anon as the forsaid
Thomas and Johan had seyn the letter and^ commandment they made king Edward
Carnariuan good chere and good so las as they might at that soper and nothing
ye king wist of ye tratorie. And when time wos for to go to bed the king went
un to his bed and^ lay and slept fast and as the king lay and slept ye
tratourys falls for sworn ayens there homage and there feaute come priueli in to
the kings chamber and^ there company with them and laid an huge tabull upon his
womb and with men pressed and held fast dou^e the.iiij: corners of the tabull
upon his body wherewith the good man awoke and^ wos wonder sore a drad to be
deed there and slain and turned his body tho vpsedoune:. Tho took ye falls
traitors and wode tirantis an horn and put it in to his fundement as deep as
they might and took a spit of coper brennyng and put it through the horn in to
his body and often times roulled there with his bowels and so they killed there
lord that nothing wos persaued and^ after he was entered at glocestre.

How king Edward spoused Philip the Earls daughter of Henaud at York:
ANd after Cristemasse tho next swyng sir John^ of henaud brought with hi^ Phelip
his brothers daughter yt was earl of Henaud his nece in to englond^ and^ king
edward spoused her at york with much honor. And sir John^ of Bothum bishop of
Ely and sir wyllm of melton Erchebisshop of york songen thee mass ye sunday
in the eve of conversion of sent Paul In the year of grace a.M.ccc.xxvij. but
for encheson that the king wos bot young and tender of age: when he wos crouned
full money wrongs were done while that his fadre leued. for encheson that he
trowed the councelers that were falls a bout him that counceled him to done other
wise than reason would wherefore great harm was done to the reame and to the king
and all me^ directid it the ki^es deed. and^ it was not so almighty god it
wot. Where fore it wos ordained at the kings crouning yt the king for his
tender age should be governed by xij. of the gretest lordis of england with out
which no thing should be done: that is to sai The erchebisshop of Cantorburi the
erchebishop of york the bishop of wynchestre and^ the bishop of herthforth
the earl of Lancastre the earl marshall. and the earl of Kent yt were the kings
vnches. and the earl of Garenne: sir Thomas wake. sir he^ri of Perci. sir
oliver of yngham and John^ of Roos barons. All these were sworn trewly for to
council the king. And they should ansuer every year in the perlament of yt that
should be don in the time of yt gouernall. bot that ordeynance wos sone undone
and^ yt wos much harm to all englond^ For the king and all ye lordis that
should govern hi^ were governed and^ ruled after the kings mother Dame Isabell:
and by sir Roger Mortimer And as they would all thing wos done both among high
and low. And they token un to them Castles tounes landis and^ rentis in great
harm and loss to the croune and^ of the kings estate out of mesure.

How the pees was made bitwene the english men and thee scottis and^ also of
Justifying of Troylebastone.
THe king Edward at witsontide in the secund year of his ragne through the
council of his modre and sir Roger Mortimer ordained a parliament at
Northamton. And at that perlament the king through her council and none other
of the land with in age granted to be accordid with the Scottis in this manner.
yt all the feautes and homages that the scottis should do un to thee croune of
Enlond for yaf them un to the scottis for ever more by his chartre enseled: And
forthermore an ende^ture wos made of the scottis un to king edward that wos
king Henris son which endenture they called it rageman in the which were contenyd
all thee homagis and feautes Frist of the king of Scotland and of all the
prelatis earls and barons of the reame of scotland with there seals set thereon
and other chartres and remembraunces that king Edward and his barons had of
there right in the foresaid reame of Scotland it wos for give them again holy
church And also with the blake cross of scotland the which the good king
edward conquerid in Scotland and brought it out of the Abbey of Scone that is a
full preciouse relic. And also forthermore he relesid and for yaf all the
landis that thebarons of england had in scotland by old conquest. And this pees
for to be hold and last the scottis were bound un to the king in xxx: thousand
pound of silver to be paid with in.iij. year that is every year x. thousand
pound by evyne porcions. And forthermore above all this they speak bitwen the
perteis above said that David dritonautier that was king Robert the Bruit son
the false tyrant and falls forsworin against his oath that arose ayens his liege
lord the nobull and good king Edward and falsely made him king of Scotland that
was of age of.v. year And so through this cursed council David spoused at
Barewik Dame Iohane of the toure thatt was king Edwardis sustre as the geest
tells. upon mare Magdalene day In the year of grace a ^M.ccc. and xxviij. to
great harm and empeiring to all the kings blod. where of that gentill lady
come. Alas the time For wonder much was that fair damisell disperaged since that
she was married ayens all the commune assent of England And from the time that
Brut had conquered Albion and named the land after his own name Bretan that now
is called England after the name of Engest: And so the reame of Scotland wos
holden of the reame of england and of the croune by feaute and by homage. For
Brut conquered that land and yaf it un to Albanak that wos his secund son and
he called that land Albayn after his own name. So that the heirs yt comen
after him should hold of Brut and of his heirs that is to sai of the kings of
Bretan by feaute and homage and from that time un to this time of king Edward
the reame of scotland wos holden of the reame of Englod by feautes and services
as above is said i^ the crenicles of England and of scotland. and bears
witness more planarly: And acursed be the time that this parliament was
ordained at Northamton. For there through fal^s council the king was there falsely
disherited and yet he was with in age. And yet when that king Edward wos put
out of his rialte of england. Yet men put not him out of the feautes and
services of the Reame of Scotland ne of the fraunchises disherited him fer
evermore. And neuerthelas the great lordis of england were ayens to confirm the
pees and the trew^s abaue said sauf only queen Isabell that tho was the kings
mother Edward and the bishop of Ely and the lord Mortimer. bot reason and law
would not that a final pees should be made by twene them with out the common
assent of england

Of the debate yt was bitwen queen Isabell and sir He^ri earl of Lancastre and
of Leycestre and^ of the ridi^g of Bedford:
WHen the forsaid David had spoused Dame Iohane of the t^ur in the town of
Berrewik as be fore is said the scottis in despite of the Englisshmen called
Dame Iohane the Countess make pees. For the cowardyse pees that tho wos
ordained. but the kings person bare all the wite and the blame with wrong of
the making of the accord. And all wos done through the quen and Roger Mortimer.
And it was not long after that the queen Isabell ne took in to her own hand all
the lordship of Pountfret. almost all the landis that were of any value that
apperteyned to the croune of Englond^ So that the king had not for to dispende
bot of his uses and^ of his Escheker. For the queen Isabell and Mortimer had a
great menye of there retenau^ce yt followed evermore the kings court: And went
and took the kings prises for her penny worthes at good chepe. Wherefore the
contre that they comen i^. were full sore a drad and almost distroid of them Tho
began the comminalte of england for to have envy to Isabell the queen that so
much loved her before. wen she come again for to pursue the false traitors the
spensers from france And in that same time the false traitor Robert of Holand
that betrayed his lord sir Thomas of Lancastre was tho delivered out of prison:
and was wonder prive with the queen Isabell and also with Roger the Mortimer
Bot that auailed not him but litell. for he was taken at myhelmasse that tho
come next sewyng after as he rode toward the queen Isabell to london and sir
Thomas wither smote of his heed besides the town of sent Albons And this sir
Thomas duelled with sir He^ri earl of Lancastre and he put him i^ hidi^g for dred
of the queen for she loved him wonder much and prayed un to the king for him
that the same Thomas might be exiled out of England. And the nobull earl sir
Henri of Lancastre had often tymys herd the comune clamor of the Englismen of
the disese that were done in England and also for diverse wrongs that were done
among the comune pepull. of the which the king bare the blame with wrong. For he
was bot full young and tender of age. And thought as a good man for to done a
way and slake the sklandre of the kings parson if that he might in any manner
of wise: So as the king was there of nothing gylty. wherefore he was in perell of
life and lyme And so he assembled all his retenau^ces and went and spoke un to
them of the kings honor and also for to amend his estate And sir Thomas
brotherton earl Marchall and sir Edmond of wodstoke that were the kings uncles
and also men of london made there oath him for to maynten in that same quarrel.
And there cause wos this that the king should hold his house and his meny as a
king ought for to done and have all his riallti and yt the queen Isabell should
deliver out of her hand in to the kings hand all manner lordshippis rentis
tounes castles that appertened un to the croune of england as other queen's did
her before and meddle with none other thing And also that sir Roger Mortimer
should duel upon his own landis for the which landis he had help to disherited
much pepull so that comune pepull were distroyd through wrongful taking: And
also to enquere how and^ by whom thee king was betrayed and falsely disceyued at
Stanhop and through whois council that the Scottis went a way by night from
thee king. And also how and^ through whose counsel the ordenaunce that was made
at the kings coronacion was put down that is to sai that the king for
amendment and helpyng of the reame and in honor of him should be governed and
ruled by xij. of the gretest and^ wisest lordis of the reame and^ with out them
should no thing ben granted ne done as before is said the which couenantis
maliciusli were put dou^e fro the king. werfor moni harms shames and reproues
have fall to the king and his ream. And that is understand for as much as
Edward sum time king of englon was ordained by assent of the cominalte in plain
perlame^t for to be under the ward and^ governance of Henri earl of Lancastre
his cousin for salvation of his body he was take out of the castle of Kemlworth
there that he was in ward. and through color of queen Isabell and of the
Mortimer with out consent of any perlament they took and lad him there that
never after none of his kynrad might with him speak ne se and after tretoursl^y
took and him mordred. For whose death arose a sclandre through all cristendo^ when
it was done. And also the tresour that sir edward of Carnariuan had left i^
mo^y places in England and in wales were wasted and borne away without the will
of king Edward his son in destruction of him and all his folk Also through whose
council that the king yaf up the ki^gdo^ of scotland For the which reame the
kings ancestres had full sore trauaill and so did money a nobull man for there
right and^ was delivered un to David that wos Robert the Brus son all the right
that no right had to the reame as all the world it wist. And also by whom the
chartres and remembrances yt they had of ye right of Scotland were take out of
the tresorie and taken un to the scottis ye kings enmys to disherityng of him
and of his successors and to great harm un to his lieges and^ great reprove un
to all englisshmen for ever more Also wherefore Dame Iohana of the tour the
kings sustre Edward wos disperaged and marid un to David yt wos Robert the
Brus son yt was a traitor and enmye un to england and^ through whose council
she wos take in to our enmys handis out of england And in the meyn while the
good earl Henri of Lancastre and his company took council how these points
above said might be amendid un to the worsship of the king and^ to his profet
and^ to the profit also of his lieges And the queen Isabell through coniecting
and sotelti and also of the Mortimer let ordeyn a parliament at Salisberi And at
yt same perlame^t the Mortimer was made earl of the march against all the barons
will of england in prejudice of the king and^ of his croune. and^ sir John^ of
Eltham the kings brother was gurt with a swerd of Cornwaill and tho wos called
earl of Cornewaill And ever more queen Isabell so much pracurid ayens her son
the king that she had the ward of the forsaid sir Edward and^ of his landis^
And at that perlament the earl of Lancastre would not cum but ordained al his
pouer ayens queen Isabell and the mortimer and men of london ordened them with
v. hondreth men of arms. When queen Isabell wist of the doing she swore by god
and by his names full angrely that in evil time he thought upon tho points.
Tho sent the queen Isabell and the Mortimer after there retene. and^ after the
kings retenue. so that they had ordained among theem an huge host and they
councelled the king so yt upon a night they riden xxiij mile toward bedford
the^ that the earl of lancastre wos with his conpani and thought to have hi^
destroyed And yt night she rode by side the king her son as a knight armed for
dred of death. And it was done the king to understand yt the earl henri of
lancastre and his company would have distroid the king and his counsel for
ever more wherefore the king wos somdele towardis hi^ heavy and annyed. When the
earl marshall and the earl of kent the kings brother herd of this tyding they
riden so i^ message bitwen them that the king granted him his pees to earl
henri of lancastre for a certan rau^sone of xi.M. pound. but yt wos never paid
afterward. And these were the lordis that held with sir henri of Lancastre. sir
Henri beamo^t sir Fouke fitzwaren: sir Thomas Rocelyn sir willm trussell sir
Thomas wyther. and about an hondreth knyggtis mo yt were to him concentid. and
all tho were exiled through counsel of queen Isabell and^ of the Mortimer. for
the mortimer weited for to have there landis if that he might through any manner
coniecting for he was to covetous and^ had to much his will and^ that wos great
pit.

How king edward went over see for to do his homage un to the king of france
for the duchy of Gnyhen.
IT wos not long after that the king of france through co^cell of his dousepe
is sent to king Edward of england that he should cume to Paris and done his
homage as reason it would for the duchy of Gnyhen And so through counsel of the
lordis of england king edward went over the sea and at the ascencion tide he
come un to Paris the third year of his regne for to do his homage un to the
king of france and the king vnderfenge his homage and made of hi^ much joy
and worsship But when king Edward had made his homage hasteli he was sent for
in to england through the queen Isabell his mother. and^ anon hastily he come
again in to england upon witsonday with out any taking leave of the king of
france wherefore he wos wonder wroth.

How sir Roger Mortimer bare him proudly and^ so hie.
ANd now shall ye here of sir Roger Mortimer of wygmore that dissired and
couyted to be at an high a state so yt the king granted him to be called earl
of march through out all his lordship. And he become so proud and so hauteyne
that he would lose and forsake the name that his ancestres had ever before And
for that encheson he let him call the earl of march and none of the comuns of
england durst call him by name other name for he was called so through the
kings cry that men should call him earl of the march And the Mortimer bare
him so hauteyne and^ so proud that wonder it was for to wit. and also disgised
hi^ with wonder rich clothes out of all manner reason both of shapping and of
wering Where of the englisshmen had great wonder how and^ in whot manner he might
contreue or find such manner pride and they said among them all comenli that
his pride sh^old not long endure: And the same time sir Geffrey Mortimer the
young yt was the mortimer son let him call king of folly and so it befell
afterward in deed for he wos so full of pride and^ of writchednesse that he
held a round tabull in wales to all men that thider come and contrefete the
doi^g and^ the manner of king Arthurs tabull bot openli he failed For the nobull
king Arthur wos the most worthy lord of renoune yt was in all the world in his
time and yet come never none such after. For all the nobull knyghtis in all
cristendome of deed of arms asayed duellid with king Arthur and^ held him for
there lord and soferen. And that wos well sayn for he conquered in bataill a
roman that wos called Froll and^ get of him the reame of france and killed him
with his own handis And also he faught with a geant that wos called Dinabus and
killed him that had rauesshed fair Eleyn that wos king Hocles nece king of
litell bretan. And afterward he killed in bataill the emprour of Rome that wos
called Lucie that had assembled ayens king Arthur for to fight with him so much
pepull of romans and Phethis and sarisens yt no man coud them no^bre and^ he
discomfited them all as the stori tells And in ye same time common loos
sprung in england through coniecting and ordinance of the freres prechours that
sir Edward of Carnariuan that wos king edward fadre of whom the geest tells
said that he was on live in the castle of Corf. wherefore all the co^myns all
most of england were in sorrow and i^ dred wherefore that it were so or not For they
wist not how traitoursly the mortimer had him done mordrid.

How Edmond of wodstok yt wos earl of kent and the kings brother edward of
Carnariuan was heded at wynchestre.
ANd upon a time it befell so that sir edmond of wodstoke earl of Kent spoke un
to the pope Johan the xxij. at Auinion and said that almyght good had often times
done for Thomas love of Lancastre money great miraclls to money men and women that
were through diverse maladies undone as un to the world and through his prayer
they were brought un to there hel^th. And so sir edmond prayed the pope herteli
that he would grant him grace yt the forsaid Thomas might be translatid. But
the pope said nay that he should not be translatid un to the time that he were
better certefied of the clargie of england and seyn by there obede^ce what thing
god had done for the love of Thomas of lancastre after the suggestion that the
forsaid edmond earl of kent had un to him made And when this edmond saw that he
might not speed of his purpose as tochyng the translacion he prayed him of his
counsel as toching sir edward of Carnariuan his brother and said that not long
a gone he wos king of england what thing might best be done as toching his
deliverance since that a comune fame is through england that he his on live and
hole and^ sauf. When the pope herd hi^ tell that sir edward was on live he
commanded the earl upon his benison that he should help with all the pouer yt he
might yt he were delivered out of prisun and s^ue his body i^ all manner yt he
might. and for to bring this thing to an end he assoyled hi^ and his co^pani a
pena and culpa and all tho that holp to his deliverance. Tho took edmond of
wodstoke his leave of the pope and come again i^ to england. And wha^ sir edmond
wos come^ su^ of the friar precheurs come and^ said yt sir edward his brother
yet wos on live i^ the castle of Corf under the kepi^g of Sir Thomas Gurnay.
Tho sped him the forsaid Edmond as fast os he might till he come to the castle
of Corf and^ a queynted hi^ and^ spak so fair with John^ Dauerell yt was
constable of the same castle and yaf him rich yeftes to have acqueyntance of
him and to know of his counsel. And thus it befell that the forsaid sir edmond
prayed specially to tell him privily of his lord his brother sir Edward if that
he leued or were deed. and if he were on live he prayed of him ons to have a
sight And this sir Johan Dauerill was an high herted man and full of curage
and^ ansuerid shortly un to sir Edmond and sad that sir edward his brother was
in health and under his keeping and durst show him un to no man since it was
defended him in the kings half edward that was edwardis son of Carnariuan and
also through commandment of the queen Isabell the kings modre and^ of sir
Roger Mortimer that he should show his body un to no manner man of the world
sauf only un to them upon lesyng life and limme and^ disherityng of his heiris
for ever more. But the false traitor falsely lied for he was not in his ward but
he wos take thens and lad un to the castle of berkeley through sir Thomas
Gurnay through conmau^deme^t of the Mortimer til that he wos deed as before is
said but sir edmond of wodstoke wist nothing that Edward his brother was deed
where upon he took a lettre un to the king edward his brother as to his worthi
lord. And vnderfeng the letter of him and be hight him for to do his message
with out any manner faill and with that sir edmond took leave of the forsaid
John^ and went i^ to his own contre and lordship i^ kent that he had there And
anon as this same john^ wist yt sir edmond wos gone i^ to kent his own
lordship anon he went i^ all the have that he might fro the castle of Corf
and comen un to sir Roger mortimer and took him the letter that sir edmond of
wodstoke earl of kent had taken him closed and^ enseled with his own seal And
we^ sir roger mortimer had vnderfeng the letter he vnclosid it and^ saw what
was contained theri^ and^ began it for to read whereof the beginning wos this
Worshippes and reuerens with brothers legeaunce and subieccion. Sir knight
worsshipfull and dear brother if it you plese I pray you hertely yt ye be in
good co^forth for I shall so ordeyn for you that ye shall cum out of prison and
be delivered of that disese that ye be in. And understands of your great
lordship that I have to me assentant almost all ye great lordis of england with
all there apparaill that is to sai with armure with tresour with out nombre for to
maynten yor quarrel so ferforth that ye shall be king again as ye were before and
that they have suorne to me upon a book and^ as well prelatis as earls and
barons: When sir Roger the Mortimer saw and understood the might and thee
strength of the lettre anon his heart for wroth began boll and euel heart bare
toward sir Edmond of wodstoke that was the earl of kent And with all the have
that he might he went un to Dame Isabell the queen that wos the kings mother
and^ showed her sir edwardes lettre and his will and his purpose. And how that
he had coniected and ordeynde to put down king edward of wyndesore her son of
his rialte and of his kingdom. Now certis sir Roger quoth she has sir edmond done
so now: by my fadre soul quod she I will been thereof avenged if that god
grant me life and that in a short time And with that the queen Isabell went
un to ye king edward her son there he was: at thee perlament at wynchestre for
to have a mende the wrongs and the trespaces that were done among the pepull
in his reame. And tho took she and showed him the letter that sir Edmond of
wodstoke earl of kent had made and enseled with his own seal. And bad him upon
her benyson that he should be a venged upon edmond: as upon his dedely enmye
Tho was the queen so wroth toward sir edmond the earl of kent. and cessid never
to pray un to her son till that he had sent in all the have after him And upon
that the king sent by his lettres after sir Edmond of wodstoke that he should
cum and speak with him at wynchestre all manner thing left And when sir edmond
saw that the king sent after him with his lettres enselid he hasted him in all
that he might till that he come un to wynchestre. but wen the queen wist that
ser edward wos cumyn to wynchestre tho anon she prayed and so fast went un to
the king edward her son that the good earl wos a restid anon and lad un to the
bar before Robert of Hamond that wos coroner of the kings house hold and he
associed un to him sir Roger the Mortimer and^ tho spoke the foresaid Robert
and said. Sir Edmond earl of kent ye shall understand that it is done us to
wit and principally un to our liege lord the kyn Edward of england all mighty
god him save and keep. that ye be his dedely enmye and a tratour: and^ also a
comune enmye un to the reame. and that ye have been a bout money day for to make
prive deliverance of sir edward sum time king of england your brother the which
was put down of his rialte by the comun assent of all the lordis of england in
pesyng of our lord the king estate and also of his reame. Tho ansuerid the good
man and^ said. forsooth sir understands well that I was never traitor to my
king ne to the ream. and that I do me on god and on all the world. and^
therefore be my kings leave I sh^all it p^ue and defend as a man aught for to
do. Tho said Mortimer sir edmond it is so ferforth know that it may not be well
gaynsaid and yt i^ presens of all that here be it shall be well proved. Now had
this false Mortimer the same lettre that sir Edmond had taken un to sir Johan
Dauerill in the castle of Corf for to take to king Edward his brother that sir
edmond wist not of ne supposed no thing that sir John^ Dauerell had been so
falls to deliver his letter in such wise un to the Mortimer and thought no manner
thing of yt letter. tha^ mortimer said to sir edmond and showed a letter seled
and axed him if yt he knew yt letter and the seal. This sir edmond looked there
on and^ a vised him long time on the printe of the seal for he might not se the
letter with in what wos theri^ and wist well that it was his seal and thought
that it had be some letter yt had bore no great charge and thought no thing of
that oder letter and said openly in hering of them all ye forsooth this is my
seall: and I will it not forsake Lo quod the mortimer sires ye hereth all what
he has said and that he knowleches hi^ yt this is his letter and his seal and
now ye shall here all what is conteyued there in And than this mortimer opened
the letter that he had folden before to gedre and red it openli word be word in
hering of them all And when the letter was red he said lo sires ye have herid
all that here is written and^ yt he has knowlecheth that this is his letter
and his seal and^ he may not go there fro And than they cried and yaf dome that
he should be honged and draw and his head smyten of in manner of a trator and he
and his heiris disherited for ever more And so he was lad forth and put in to
prison And when this wos done and the queen wist that he wos dampened by way of
law both of life and limme and his heirs disherited for ever more through opyn
knowle chyng in plain court. Wherefore them thought that it were good that the
forsaid sir edmond were hasteli killed with out witti^g of the king or else the
king lightly would for yef him his death and than it should turn them to much
sorrow so os he wos enpeched. And anon the queen through council of the
Mortimer and with out any other council sent in have to the Balifs of
wynchester that they should smite of sir Edmond head of wodstoke earl of Kent
with out any manner of bydyng or respite up pain of life and lyme and that he
should have none other execucion be cause of tarieng not withstonding the
Judgment. Tho toke^ the balifs sir Edmond out of prison and lad him beside the
castle of wynchestre and there they made a gong fermer smite of his head for
none other durst it done and so died he there Alas the while. that is to sai the
x. day of October the iij. year of king Edwardis regne and when the king wist
there of. he wos wonder sori and^ let entier him at the friar mynors at
wynchestre.

Of the death of sir Roger mortimer earl of march.
ANd so it befell at that time that sir Roger Mortimer earl of the march was
so proud and se hauteyn that he held no lord of the reame his pere. and tho
become he so covetous yt he followed Dame Isabell the queen's court that wos king
Edwardis modre and beset his penyworthis with the offics of the queen's housold in
the same manner that the kings officers did and so he made his taking as
tochyng vitalles and also of cariagis. and all he did for because of spensis
and for to gadre tresur and so he did with out nombre in all yt he might Tho
made he him wonder prive with the queen Isabell and^ so much lorship and^
reteneu had: so yt all the great lordis of england of him were adrad. Wherefore ye
king and his co^cell towardis hi^ were agreued and^ ordained among them to undo
hi^ through pure reso^ and law for cause yt king edward yt was the kings fadre
traitoursly through him was mordred in the castle of Berkeley as bofore is said
more planly i^ ye same part of this book of his death And su^ that were of ye
kings co^cell loved ye martimer: and told him in priuete how that the king
and^ his counsel were about from day to day hi^ for to shend and undone. wherefore
the Mortimer was sore annoyed and^ angri as ye deuell ayens them yt were of the
kings counsel and said he would of tha^ been avenged how so ever he took on.
It was not long afterward that kind Edward and^ Dame Phelip his wife and^ Dame
Isabell the kings modre and sir Roger mortimer ne went un to Notyngham there
for to sodiorne. and so it befell that the queen Isabell through council of the
Mortimer took to her the keys of the yatis of the castle of Notingham so that
no man mygh cum another in ne out by night but through commandment of the
Mortimer ne the king ne none of his council. And that t^me it fell so that the
Mortimer as a deuell for wroth bolled. and also for wrath that he had ayens the
kings men edward and^ principally ayenest them that had him accused to the
king of ye death of sir Edward his fadre And p^uely a counsel was take bitwen
queen isabell and^ the Mortimer and the bissh^op of Lyncoln and sir Symond of
Beford and sir Hugh of Trumpyngton and oder prive of there counsel for to
undone them all that had accused the Mortimer un to the king of his fadres death
of treson and of felony: Wherefore al tho that were of the kings council when
they wyste^ of thee mortimers castyng privily come to king edward and^ said yt
the mortimer would them destroy for cause yt they had him accused of king
edwardis death his fadre. and praid him yt he would maynten them i^ there right.
And these were the lordis to pursue this quarrel sir william of mountagu sir
Humfrey de bo^hun sir william his brother sir Rauf of Stafford sir Robert of
Hereford sir willm of Clinton sir John^ Neuil of hornby and mo^y othre of there
consent and al^l these sworen upon a book to may^ten the quaril in as much as
they might. And it befell so after that sir william mo^tagu ne none of the
kings frendis must not be herbrugged in the Castle for the mortimer^ but went
and took there herbrughe in diverse places in the town of Notyngham. And tho
were they sore adrad lest that mortimer should them destroy And i^ have they
come un to king Edward ser william mountagu tho yt he wos in the castle. and
priueli him told that he ne none of his company should not take the mortimer
with out counsel and help of will^m of Eland constabul of the same Castle. Now
certes quod the king I love you well: and therefore I council you yt ye go to the
forsaid constabull and command him in my name that he be your fiend and your
help for to take the Mortimer all thing I left upon parill of life and limme.
Tho said mountaygu sir my lord grou^t mercy. Tho went forth the forsaid
montaygu and come to the cu^stabull of the castle and^ told him ye kings
will. And he ansurid and^ said ye kings will should be done in as much as he
might. and yt he would not spare fore no manner death and so he swore and made his
oath Tho said sir willm mountagu to the conestabull i^ hering of all them that
were helpyng un to the same quarrel. Now certis dear friend us behooves to worch
and do by your quentyse for to take the mortimer since that ye be keeper of the
castle and haueth the keys in your ward sir quod the constabull will ye
understand that the gates of the castle ben lokked with the lockis that Dame
isabell send hider and be night she has the keys thereof and lies them under
the leuesell of the bed un to the morrow and so ye may not cu^ in to the castle
by ye yates in no manner of wise. But I know an aley that stretches out of the
ward under the earth in to ye forsaid castle that goth in to the west. which
aley Dame Isabell the queen ne none of her men ne the Mortimer ne none of his
company knows it not: And so I shall led you through that aley and so ye
shall cum in to thee castle with out aspieng of oni man yt ben your emnys And
thee same night sir willm mou^tagu and all ye lordis of his quarrel and the same
constabul also went them to horse and^ made sembla^t as it were for to wend out
of the mortimer sight. But anon as ye mortimer herd this tydyng he went yt
they would have gone over see for dred of hi^ and anon he and his company token
council among them for to let there passage and sent lettres anon to thee
ports so that none of ye great lordis should we^d home to there own cu^tre bot if
they were arestid and^ take: And among oder things willm Eland conestable of
ye foresaid castle priueli lad sir william mountagu and his compain by the
foresaid way under the earth so til^ they com i^ to ye castle and went up in to
the toure there that Mortimer was in. But sir hugh of Trumpyngton them ascried
hidously and said. A traitors it is all for naught that ye be comen un to this
castle. ye shall die yet an evil death euerychon. and anon on of them that
was in Mountagu is company up with a mace and smote the same hugh upon the
heed that the brayn breast out and fell on the ground and so was he deed an evil
death. Tho took they the Mortimer as he armed him at the toures door when he
hard the noise of them for dred And when the queen Isabell saw that the
Mortimer was taken she made much sorrow in heart and these words un to them said:
Now fair sires I pray you that ye don no ne harm to his body a worthy knight
our well-beloved friend and our dear cosyn. Tho went they thens and come and
brought the mortimer and presentid him un to the king Edward and he commanded
to bring him in sauf ward But anon as they yt were consent un to the Mortimers
doing herd tell that he was taken they went and hid them and privily by night
went out of the town each in his side with heavy heart and morning and leued
upon there landis as well as they might And so that same year that the Mortimer
was take he had at his retene ix. score knyghtis with out squyers and
sergiauntys of arms and footmen And tho was the mortimer lad to london And
sir Symo^d of Beford was lad with him and was take to the conestabull of the
toure to keep. But afterward wos the mortimers liif examined at westmynstre
before the king and before all the great lordis of england for peril yt might
fall to the reame and to enquere also which were assentyng to sir edwardis death
the kings fader. and also through whom the scottis ascappid from stanhope in to
scotland with out the will of king edward. And also how the chartre of ragman
was delivered un to the scottis wherein the homag and feautes of scotland were
contained: yt the scottis should done ever more to the english^ king for the
reame of scotland wherefore in his abse^s he was dampened to be draw and honged
for his treson: and this myschief come un to him on sent Andrews even in ye
year of incarnacio^ of our lord Ihu^ crist.M.ccc. and xxx.

How king edward get again un to him grociously the homages and feautes of
Scotland where of he was put out through falls counsel of Isabell his modre and
sir Roger Mortimer that was new made earl of march.
NOw ye have hard lordis how sir Johan Bailloll in the time of pees was chosen
to be king of Scotland for encheson that he come of the eldest daughter of the
earl David of Honti^gton thas wos king Alexandre brether of Scotland that died
with out heir of his body begoten. And how this Johan made feaute and homage to
king Edward Henris son the iij. for his land^s of scotland And how he afterward
withsaid his homage through council of the scottis in the year of our lord
a.M.cc: and lxxiiij. and^ sent un to ye pope through a falls suggestion yt he
made his oath un to the forsaid king edward over his astate and^ his will of
which oath the pope him assoilled through his bulsis to hi^ y sent: And a none as
king edward wist there of he ordained ano^e his barons and come un to Berewike
and^ conquerid the tou^e. at which conquest there were sloyn xxvM. and^ vijC. and
the bailloll that was king of scotland co^ and yield hi^ to good king edward.
and^ the king afterward delivered hi^ out of the tour of london. And all the
great lordis of Scotland with him that tho were taken at Berewik and yaf them
sauf condithis to gone in to scotland. And the scottis since through there
falsenesse wered upon good king edward. And when sir Johan bailloll king of
scotland saw all this he went over the sea un to Dunpier and leued there upon
his own landis as well as he might till that the scottis would amend them of
thermisdedis and trespace: and^ lad with him sir edward his son wherefore the
Scot^s in dispite of him called him sir Johan Turnlabard for beca^ that he would
not offend ne trespace ayens the good king edward of england And so he for
soke his Reame of Scotland and set thar of but litell price: And this sir John^
long time duelled in france till that he died there: And sir Edward his son
vnderfeng his heritage and did homage un to the king of france for his landis
of Dunpier and so it fell afterward that Edward yt wos John^ Bailloll son had
with hi^ a squire of england that wos borne in yorkshire that was called John^
of Barnabi and this Edward bailloll loved him much and wos ny him and full
prive. And so this John^ of barnaby was in debate with a frensh man in the
town of Dunpier and^ so he killed him and went in his wai in all the have that
he might in to the Castle for to have socour and help of his lord And ano^e
come ye officers of the tou^e to take johan of Barnaby as a felon and sir
edward his lord holp him and^ rescued him and^ by night made hi^ we^d out of
the castle and so he went his way and come i^ to england with out any harm.
And when the king of france saw that sir Edward had rescued his felon he
become wonder wroth ayens sir Edward and ano^e let him be arestid and took in
to his hand all his landis Tho duelled sir Edwar in prison un to the time that
sir Henri of Beaumont come in to france the which Henri sum time was earl of
angos in scotland through his wife and wos put out of the forsaid erldom when
the accordeme^t was bitwen England and Scotland thurhh the queen isabell and
sir Roger Mortimer and there copani for the marriage that she made bitwen David
that wos Robert the Brus son and Dame Iohana at Toure king Edwardis sustre of
england and well understood this yt at the end he should cum to his right but
if it were through sir edward Bailloll that was right heir of the reame of
Scotland And the king of france Lowys loved much this sir Henri and he was
with him full prive and thought for to make a deliverance of sir Edward
Baillolls body if he migh in any manner of wise. Tho prayed he the king yt he
would grant him of his grace sir Edward Baillolls body un to the next
perlament that he might live with his own rentis in the meyn tym and that he
might stand to be Iuged by his peris at the parlame^t And the king grau^tid him
his prayer and made the forsaid Edward to be delivered out of prison in the
manner above said. And anon as he wos out of prison. sir Henri took him forth
with him and lad him to england and made him duel privily at the manner of
sandhall up onse in yorkshire with the lady vescy and so he ordained him there
an houge retenaunce of pepul of englisshmen and^ also of aliens for to conquer
again his heritage. And so he yaf much silver un to the sowdiours and^ to aliens
for to help hi^: And they behight for to help him in that they might. but they
failed hi^ at his most need. And at that time Donald earl of Morrif herd tell
how that sir Edward bailloll wos privily cum in to england and come to him and
made with him great joy of his comi^g again and said un to him and^ behight him
that all the great lordis of england should be to him entendant and should him
hold for hyng as right heir of scotland and did to him homage and feaute. Tho
come sir Henri of Beaumont to king Edward of england and^ prayed him in way of
charity that he would grant of his grace un to sir Edward bailloll that he
might saufl^y gone by land from Sandhall un to scotlond for to co^quere his
right heritage in scotland: The king ansuerid and said. if that I suffer ye
Bailloll wend through my land in to scotland than the pepull would say that I
should be assentyng un to the compani Now sir I pray you that ye would yef him
leave to tak with hi^ soudiours of englishmen that they might saufly led him
through yowr land un to scotland. And sir upon this covenant that if it so
befall that god it forbide that he be discomfited in batell through the Scottis.
that I and also all the lordis that holden with Bailloll been for evermore out of
your rentis that we have in england And there the king upon this covenant
granted there bone as tochyng him and tho that were of the same quarrel the which
clamed for to have landis or rentis in the ream of England. And these were the
names of the lordis that pursued this matter: that is to say sir Edward the
Bailloll that challenged the reame of Scotland sir Henri Beammont earl of Angos
sir David of Stroboly earl of Atheles sir Geffrey of monbray: Walter Common and^
money oder yt were put out of there heritage in Scotland when the pees wos made
bitwen england and scotland as before is said. And ye shall understand yt these
lordis took with them v. hondreth men of arms and ij. thousand archers and of
footmen and^ tho went i^ to ship at rauenspore and sailed by the se till yt
they come un to scotland and come to land at kynkehorne xij. mile from sent
Iohanes town: and anon sent out there shippis again for they should not be
hurt ne empayrid nether yt no man should go i^ to the shippis again though yt
they had need bot a bide^ all perrillis and not fle but stand and rather suffer
death than flee for to maynten there true quarrel When the Earl of Fiffe a fers
man and a stern herd yt the Bailloll was common for to take the land of
scotland he come i^ have to kynghorn with xij. thousand scottis to destroy hi^
that he should not cum to land. But sir Edward Bailloll and his compani there
him descomfited at ye which discomfiture sir Alesander of seton wos there kyllid
and money oder. The earl of Fiffe was tho sore and full ill a shamed that so
litell a compani had him discomfited and^ shamly put him and al his compani yt
was a live for to flee. Tho come sir Edward bailloll and^ token the cuntre all
about him till he com un to the Abbey of Dunfermilyn and there he found vitallis
for him and for his folk and^ among all other things he fond i^ a chamber a
bout v. hondreth of great stauis of fine oak with long pykis of yren and of
stele: and he took them and delivered them to the most strongest men of his
compani And anon after he went fro thens and logged him i^ a field ij: mile
from sent Iohanes town and when the burgies of the town herd how the Earl of
Fiffe was disco^fited through the Bailloll they were sore adr^d and br^ken there
brugges that they head made over the water of erne so that the Bailloll might
not gone over wherefore he loged hi^ there all that night but litell head he took
of rest and said un to his pepull Now dear lordis ye know full well that we be
now logged bitwen our enmys and if they may us hampre there is no bote but death
wherefore if we abide here still all this night I leave that it shall turn us to
much sorrow and harm. For the pouer of scotland may every day wax and encrece
and we may not so done And we be bot litell pepull as against them. Wherefore I
pray you for the love of almighty god make we us bold and hardy and yt we may
mighteli take the scottis this night and boldly were upon them and let us
pursue them this night and^ if they be traueled through us and se our heidines:
oder scottis yt se them so traueled and weary the sorer will they be adrad with
us for to fight and fersely than we shall fight with them and^ on them pursue
so that through the greece of god almighty all the world shall speak of the
doughtynesse of our chivalry. And sires understands well yt all ye company
yt comen with sir Edward Bailloll granted well un to that council and werther
of right glad: and anon pursued upon the scottis that they becomen wonder
weary. And the Bailloll and his company sore followed them and^ did then much
harm and^ sorrow. through there assaut so that they might not for febull them
help and for litell pepull But tho said the scottis among them what is now
befall that so litell a pepull as the bailloll has in wynge done us so much
travel and sorrow. Now certes it seems us that he wyrketh by grace. for he is
wonder gracious in his quarrel and we certes shall be deed or that we may cum
to hi^ us for to yield since that his fadre set of us no price. And among all
other things the Bail^loll and his pepull passed the water of Erne so that sir
Roger of Swynerton the son wos fers and angri and went forth. and they saw
pepull of arms full well araied and forth they went un to them and with them
faught and kyled or take as money as would abide And nothles at that assaute they
wend it had been the great host of scotland And when it come to the morrow they
gadred them to gedre and restid them a while. but ye while yt the englisshme^
rested the^ the nobull baron Thomas of vescy and the nobull baron of stafford
prikked there horse up and dou^e by the hills for to keep the Estres of the
cu^tre And as they pricked up and dou^e they saw a great ost of good array
ordained in there wings with helmys and^ sheldis shynyng co^i^g upon them And
there come tho two lordis again un to Baillollis folk. and^ said. Now for the
love of god almighty been of good co^: forth. for ye shall have bataill anon
right And tho spak sir Fouk the son of Gareyne a baron of great renown and of
deed of arms Sirris lordinges understood what I will say. I have seyn money
diverse wi^ges as well among sarise^s and^ Iues as among the scottis. And yet
saw I never the fourth perte of the wynge fight and there far if ye will abide
our enmys we be ynow for to fight aye^s them. But if we be not of good heart and
of good will for to fight with them. for certis we been full few ayens this
compani And therefore for the love of god take to us good heart and^ let us been
bold and think we never on our wifes ne on our children. bot only to conquer
our enmys i^ bataill. And through the help of our lord god we shall them over
cum. And with yt come the host of the scottis towardis them full serely and
ayens sir Edward Bailloll i^ iij. batai^les well araied in armure And wonder
fersly they come toward the bailluls compani. But when sir Donald earl of
Marcill yt was with the scottis saw all this he said un to Robert Brus the son
of Robert the brus these wordis: Sir Robert quod he full sore me forthynketh at
my heart yt these pepull yt the bailloll has brought with him should die with dynt
of scottis swerdis since that they be cristyn men as well as we ben. And therefore
me think that it were great charity to send un to them for to yield them un to
our mercy and raunson them through grevos ranson for as much as they have taken
our land and done ill. Now certes quod sir Robert the Brus I have well persaued
yt thou art an enmy and a traitor un to scotland since yt thou will consent to
save our dedeli enmys yt has done us much sorrow and^ shame and now it seems
well that ye been of there assent Now certes Robert quod sir Donald falsely ye
lie: I am not of there co^pani ne of there consent and that hastily ye shall see.
For I will fight with them rather than any of this conpani. And certis sir
Robert said he I shall i^ maugri of thy head assaill them or thou: And with yt
they pricked there stedis fersly upon Caskemore. and^ there wyng them folewed on
a renge. and tho come they and met the bailloll and his co^pani at a hongyng
bough of the more i^ a strat passage and^ so fast they hasted them un to ye
englisshmen: so yt thousandis fell to the ground each over other i^ to an hepe
both horse and man. The bailloll and his men myghtely stood ayens them and fast
killed the scottis to the ground and^ money they sore wounded so long till yt
they stod upon them and^ foyned them with there suerdis and speris through the^
bodies and^ so sore traualed upon the^ till yt they become wonder weri and wist
not what for to do and the scottis that were left an live fled away for to save
them self i^ ye best manner that they might And tho pursued them sir edward
Bailloll and his men and killed of them till it was night. and fro the^s they
went to sent iohanes tou^e and^ took it and held them there and vitailed them
self at there own will for they fou^den enough wherewith to make them meri. Tho
made the bailloll his men yt were wo^did go to ship for to wend i^ to england to
hele there wou^des And i^ yt time there was a flemi^g i^ the sea a strong thief
and a robber that wos caled Crabbe. And this flemmyng was driven out of
flau^dres for his wikkednes. and therefore he come i^ to scotland to hold with
the Scottis and did as much harm un to thee englissh^men as he might: And this
Crabbe met the bailloll men in the se that were wounded before in bataill that
were sent again in to england for to hele there wound^s. and this Crabbe yaf un to
them a great assaute and would have killed them euerychon bot the englishmen
defendid them well and manly and discomfited crab and his company. And tho began
he fle in to scotland and as he come toward sent Iohanes town he fond a great
company of scottis that were comen again to gedre after the discomfiture of
Gaskemore the which beseged Bailloll and his men in the same town of sent John^
and anon told the scottis how that he wos disco^fited of the englisshmen that
were wou^did at gaskemore that went toward england for to hele there wou^des and
said to the scottis that they should have no pouer ne might ne grace a yens
edward Bailloll for encheson that he scomfited and empired all the chiualri of
Scotland with an handful of men as to account as a yens the Scottis that were
slain. Wherefore he cou^celled to remeue the sege from sent Iohanes town and
keep them in the best manner yt they could and might. The scottis understood yt
crab said sothe and forsook ye sege and went thens by night and^ help them
self i^ the best manner yt they might When this thing wos know through scotland
how that the lordis and^ knyghtis were discomfited at gaskemore of scotland
through sir edward the bailloll. Ye shall understand that the lords and ladies
and the gentiles of Scotland com wonder fast to sent Iohanes town and yel^d
them un to the Baillol and to him did homage and feaute for there landis and
yield them to his pees. and he them resaued freely. And fro the^s he went to the
abbey of Scone and there he was crouned king of scotland And after he let cry
his pees through out all the land And at that same time it befell that king
Edward held his perlament among his lieges at the new castle up Tyne for to
amend the trespaces and the wrongs that had be done in his land. and^ sir
edward the bailloll king of scotland come to him thider and did to him feaute
and homage for the reame of scotland. And in this manner king edward of england
gadred again his homages and feautes of scotland where of he was put out through
council and assent of Dame Isabell his modre and of sir Roger Mortimer earl of
the march. Tho took bailloll king of scotland his leave of king Edward of
england and went thens in to his own land of Sotland and set bot litell by them
that had counceled him and helped him in his quarrel. wherefore they went fro
him and went and leued by there lands and rentis in scotland And so it befell
afterward not long that the king of Scotland ne remeued and come to the town
of Anand: and^ there token his duelling and thidder come to him a company of
knights strong men and worthy and yield them un to the king. and bear them so
fair in deed and in countinaunce. so yt he trustid much upon them. And anon as
the traitors saw that he trust much upon them* they ordained among them.l.
in a compani. and would have kyled there lord the king But through the grace of
almighty god he brake^ through a wall an hole in his chamber. and os god would
ascappid their treachery and all his men were killed. and he ascappid with much
dred un to the town of Cardoil and there held him sore anoyed. and this befell
in our ladies eve the concepcion^ Tho sent king Edward the Bailloll to king
Edward of england how falsely and tratoursly he was in litell time put to shame
and sorrow through his liege men. upon whom he trustid wonder much. and praid him
for the love of god yt he would maynten him and^ help him ayens his enmys. The
king of england had of him great pit. and behight to help him and socour him:
and^ sent him word that he should hold him in pees still in the forsaid Cite of
Cardoill till that he had gadred his pouer: Tho ordained king Edward of England
a counsel at london and let gadre his men in diverse shires of england. and
when he wos all redi he went toward thee town of Berewill upon Twede and
thider come un to him king Edward bailloll of Scotland with his pouer and
beseged the town. and made with out the town a fair town of pauilons. and
^iked them all about so that they had no dred of thee scottis: and made money
assaute with gonnys and with other engynes to the town. wherewith they distroid
money fair houses and chirches also were bet down un to the earth with great
stones that spituusly come out of gonnys and of other engynes. And notheles the
scottis kept well the tou^e that tho two kings might not come theri^ long
time. And notheles the kings abide there so long till tho that were in the
town failed vitales. and also they were so weary of wakyng that they wist what
for to done. And ye shall understand thas tho scottis that were in the town of
Berewik through commune counsel and there assent let cry upon the walls of the
town that they might have pees of the englishmen. and there of they prayed the
king of his grace and merci and prayed him of trewes for viij. days upon this
covenant that if they were not rescued in that side of the town toward
scotland of the scottis with in viij days that they would yield them un to the
king and the town also. And to hold this covenant they proferid to ye king xij
hostages out of the town of berewik. When the hostages were delivered un to the
king anon tho of the tou^e send un to the scottis and told them of there sorrow
and mischief. And thee scottis come tho privily over the water of Twed to the
bought of the abbey And sir willm Dyket that wos tho stiward of scotland and
money other yt come with him put them there in great peril of them self at yt
time of there life. For they come over a brugge that wos to broken and the
stones away and money of there co^pani were there drenched but the forsaid willm
went over and other of his company and come by the shippis of england and
killed i^ a barge of hul xvi. men And after they went in to the town of
berrewik by the water side. Wherefore the scottis held tho the town rescued and
asked there hostages again of the king of england. And thee king sent them word
again that they axed the hostages with wrong since that they come in to the town
of england side. for covenant was bitwen them that the town should be rescued
by the half of Scotland And anon king Edward tho commanded to yield the town
or he would have the hostage. And the scottis said the town was rescuyd well
ynowgh and there to they would them hold. When king Edward saw the scottis brek
there covenant that they made he wos wonder wroth and anon let take sir Thomas
fitzwillm and sir Alexander of seton wardeyn of Berewik the which Thomas wos
person of Dunbar and let them be take first a fore that other hostages For
encheson that sir Alexander fadre wos keeper of the tou^e. And tho commanded
every day ij. hostages of the town till that they were all done to death but if
they yield the town. And so he should teache them for to break there couenauntes
And when tho of the town herd these things they becomen wonder sori and sent
to the king of england that he would grant them other viij. dais of respet. so
that bitwe^ tho hondreth men of arms and xx^ men of arms might be strength
gone bytwen them to the town of Berewyk them for to vital that the town must

covenant to be holden they sent to him other xij. of the forsaid town in

hidously ascried the scottis: And tho had every englissh bataill ij. wings of
price Archiers the which at that bataill shot arowes so fast and so sore yt the
scottis might not help them self. and they smyten the scottis thousandis un to
the ground And they gun for to fle fro the englishmen for to save there life's:
And when the english knaves saw the scomfiture and the scottis fall fast to the
ground they priked there mastres horse with the spores for to keep them fro
peril and set there mastres at no force And wen ye englismen saw yt they
lepten on there horse and fast pursued the scottis and all that abyden they

sheep should have ayens v: wolfes and so were the Scottis discomfited. And yet
the Scottis had well: v. men ayens on Englishman. And that bataill was done on

doing lastid the English pages took the pilfry of the Scottis yt were killed
every man that he might take with out any chalengyng of any man. And so after
this gracious victori the king turnyd him again un to the same sege of berewik.
And when they besegid saw and^ herd how king Edward had sped. They yolden to
hi^ the town with the castle on the morn after sent Margaretis day. And than
the king ordained sir Edward Bailloll with other nobull and worthy men to be
kepers and gouerners of Scotland in his absence. and him self turned again and
come in to England after this victori with much joy and worship. And in ye
next year sewyng that is for to say in the year of Incarnacion of our lord Ihu^

his parliament in scotland with moni nobull lords of England that were at yt
same parliament for encheson of there lands and^ also lordshippis that they had

his homage and feaute un to king edward of england for the Reame of Scotland at
the new castle upon Tyne in the presence of money a man worthy lordis and also
of comunes both of the reame of england and also of scotland. and a none after
in the same year king Edward of england resaued of the Duke of Bretan his
homage for the erldom and^ lordship of Richemond And so following in the ix.
year of his rene after Mihelmasse King Edward rode in to scotland and there was

England about sent Clementis tide in winter there arosen such a springyng and
welling up of watres and also of slodis both of the sea and also of fresh
reuerys and springes yt the sea banks walls and^ costs breke^ up yt me^

entered ye scottis se after midsomer and to mo^y of the scottis he yaf bataill

Comata and yt sterre wos seyn in diverse pertes af the firmament. Where after
anon there followed i^ england good chepe and wonder great plente of all cheffar
vitaill and merchandise. and there ayens honger scarcite mischief and need off
monay In so much that a quarter of whete at london was sold for ij. shillyng
and a good fat ox at a nobull and v: good dove briddis for a pene in which year
died sir John^ of eltham earl off Cornewaill yt wos king edwardis brother and

How king Edward made a duchy of the Erldom of Cornwaill and also of vi. other
earls that weer new made and^ of the frist challenge of the kingdom of france.
IN the year of our lord a. thousand CCC. and^ xxxvij. and of king Edward xij.
in the month of march during the perlament at westmynstre in lent tym king
Edward made of the erledom of Cornwaill a duchy and let it call the duchy of
Cornewaill the which duchy he yaf un to Edward his frist son with ye erledom of
Chestre. And also king Edward made at yt same time.vi. other erll: that is for
to say sir Henri earl of Lancaster son earl of Leycestre willm of Boghun earl
of Northhamton villm of Mountagu earl of Salusberi. Hugh of Awdell earl of
Glocestre Robert of vfford earl of Southfolke and willm of Clyton earl of
Huntyngton: And in that same year it wos ordained in the same parliament that no
man should were no clothe that wos wrought out of England as clothe of gold ne
of silk or velvet or Damask or Satin Baudkin ne none such other ne none wild
ware ne Furrure of beyond the se. but such as might spende^.C. pound of rent
by year: But this ordinance and statute wos but of litell effect. For it was
nothing holden. In the.xiij: year of his regne king Edward went over se in to
Braban with queen Philip his wife there bering a child at Andewerp there he
duelled more than a year for to trete with the duke of Braban and^ other allied
un to him of thee chalanging of the kingdom of France to king Edward of
england by right and by heritage after the death of Karoll the great king of
France brother Germayne of queen Isabell king edwardis mother the which was
holden and occupied unrightful by Philip of valoys the emes sone of the king
Karoll the which Duke and all his. i^ the forsaid things and all other longyng
there to with all his men and^ goodis king edward fond ready un to him and made
and beheighten him seurte by good feith and trust. and after that the king
hasted him in to England again and left there the queen still behynd him in
Braban. Than in the xiiij: year of his regne when all the lordis of his ream
and other that fallen to be at his parliament were called and assembled to gedre
in the same parliament holden at london after the fest of sent helarie. The
kings needs were put forth and promoted as touching the ki^gdo^ of france. For
which nedis to be sped the king axed the fifth perte of all the meuable goodis
of england and the wulles and the.ix: sheef of every corn. And all lordis of
every town where sich things should be taxed and gadred. should ansuer to the
king there of. and he had it and held it at his own lust and will. Wherefore if I
shall knowlech the very truth. the ynner love of the pepull was turned in to
hate and the common prayers in to cursing. for cause that the comune pepull were
so strongly grieved. Also the forsaid Phelip valois of france had gadred un te
him a great host and^ destruid there in his perties and kingdom money of the
kings frendis of england with tounes and Castles and money other of there
lordeshippis and money harms shames and dispites did un to thee queen. Wherefore
king Edward when he herd this tdyng wos strongly meued and therewith an angered.
and sent diverse lettres over see to the queen and to other that were his
frendis gladyng them certefieng them that he would be there him self in all the
have that he might And anon after Ester wan he had sped of al things that to
him neded to have. he went over the se again. Of whose coming the queen and all
his frendis were wonder glad and made much joy. And all that were his enmys and
ayens him held. made as much sorrow. In the same time thee king through council
of his true lieges and counsel of his lords that there were present with him
took the king of fraunces name. and took and^ meddled the kings arms of
france quartled with the arms of england. and commaundid forth with his coyen
of gold under descripcion and writi^g of the name of england and^ of france to
be made best that might be and that is to say the floreyn that was called the
nobull pris of vi. shilli^g and viij. pens and the sterli^g and the half nobull
of the value of iij. shilli^ges and^ iiij. pens and the farthynges of value xx.
pens.

How King Edward come un to the scluys and discomfited all the pouer of france
in the haven.
ANd in the next year after. that is to say the xv year of his rene. he
co^mandid and let writ i^ his chartres writtis and other lettres the date of
the regne of france frist. And while that he wos thus doi^g and^ traueling i^
france through his counsel he wrote to al ye p^latis Dukis earls and^ barons.
and the nobull lordis of the cu^tre. and also to diverse of the commune pepull
diverse lettres and mau^dementis bering date at Gandau^e the viij. dai of
februari. And ano^e after with i^ a litell time he come again i^ to england with
the queen and^ her childer And i^ the same year on mydsomer eve he began to
sail toward france again. and ma^ly and stiffly fell upon Phelip of valois thee
which long time lay and^ had gadred to hi^ a full long and boustous menye of
diverse nations i^ the haven of Scluys. and there they foughten to geder the
king of france and he with there hosts fro midday to iij. of the cloak i^ ye
morn. i^ which bataill were slain xxx. thousand men of the kings co^pani of
france and^ mo^y sh^ippis and^ cogges were taken. And so through goddis help he
had there the victori and^ bear thens a glorius chiualri. And i^ the same year
about sent Iamis tide without ye yates of sent Omers Robert of Artheis with me^
of england and flau^dres bitterly faught ayens the duke of burgo^ and ye
frenshmen at which bataill were slain and^ take of the frensshmen xv. barons
lxxx. knyghtis. and sh^ippis and barges were take un to the no^bre of CC: and

of Henaude with Englissh archers made assaute un to the tou^e of sent Ama^d
where they slow.l. knyghtys and money other and also destroyed the town. And in
the xvi. year of his regne following in the winter time the same king duelled
still upon the forsaid sege and sent often time in to England un to his tresorer
and other puru^iours for gold and monay that should be sent un to him there i^
his need. but his proctours and messingers cursedly and full slouli served him
at his need and him deceived on whose defaute and laches the king took trewes be
twen him and^ the king of france And the king Edward full of sorrow and^ shame
i^ his heart withdrow hi^ fro the sege and come in to bretan and there wos so
great strife for vitaill that he lost money of his pepull. And when he had done
there that he come for he dressed him over see in to england ward. And os he
sailed toward england i^ the high see the most myshappis storms and tempests
thundre and lightynynges fell to him in the sea the which wos said that it wos
done and araysed through iuell spretes made by sorsorie and nygromanci of them
of france wherefore the kings heart was full of sorrow and anguyssh wellyng and
sighyng and said un to our lady in this wise. O blissed lady sent Mari what is
the cause that ever more going in to france all things and wethers falen to
me Joyful and lyking and^ gladsum and os I would have them bot al way turnyng
in to England ward all things falen vnprofitabully and ueri harmfull neuerthe
later he scapyng al perrels of the sea as god would come to the tour of london
by night And the same year the king held his criste^masse at Men^es and sent
word to the scottis by his messingers that he wos ready and would fight with them.
bot the scottis would not abide that but fled over the Scottis see and hid the^
as wel^ as they might And i^ the xvij. year of his regne about the fest of
Conversion of sent Paul. king Edward wen he had been in scotland and saw that
the scottis were fled tho he come again in to england And a litell before lent
was the turnement at Dunstabull to the which turnement come all the young
bachelary and chivalry of England with money other Earls and lordis At the which
turnement king Edward him self was there present And the next year folewyng i^
the xviij year of his regne at his perlament holden at westmynstre the auynzeme
of Paske the king Edward the third made Edward his frist son prince of wales
And in the xix. year of his regne anon after in Ianiu by fore lent the same
king edward let make full nobul Iustes and great festis in the place of his
birth at windesore. that there wos never no^e such seyn there a fore. At which
fest and rialte were ij. kings and ij: queen's the prince of wales. the duk of
Cornewaill x. earls ix. Cou^tesses barons and money burgeis the which might not
lightly be nombrid. And of diverse landis beyond the sea weren money strangers
And at the same time when the Justice were done. king Edward made a great soper in
the which he ordained frist and began his rouud tabul and ordained and
stedfasted the day of the round tabull to be holden there at wyndesore in the
witson weke ever more yerly And in this time englismen so much haunted and^
cleued to the wodnesse and^ folly of the strangers That from time of coming of
the Henaudres xviij. year passed* they ordained and changid them every year
diverse shappis and^ disgising of clothing of long large and wide clothis
destitut and disert. from al old honest and good usage. And an other time
short clothis and strayt wasted dagged and kyt and on every side slatered and
botoned with sleues and^ tapitis of surcotes and hodis over long and over much
hangyng. that if I the soth shall say. they were more like to tormentouris and
deuels in there clothing and shoyng and^ other array. than to men. And the women
more nysely yet passid the men in array and^ coriousloker. for they were so
strait clothid that they let hang fox tailles sewed by neth within there clothis
for to hele and hide there arses. the which disgysynges and pride perauentur
afterward brought forth and caused money myshappis and^ myschief in the reame of
england. The xx year of king Edward he went over in to Britan and Gascoyn in
whose company went the earl of warwyk. the earl of Suffolk. the earl of
Hu^tyngton. and the earl of Arundel and^ money other lordis and comune pepull in

fast by with a strong host yet he would not cum no nigh but break all the brugges
by yond the water of seyn fro Royn un to Paris. and him self fled un to the

How king Edward beseged Calays and how it wos wone and yold to him.
IN the xxij. year of king Edwardis regne he went over the sea in the winter
time and lay all the winter at the sege of Calays the which year the while the
sege lasted and endurid Philip the king of france cast and purposed
trechouresly and with fraud to put a way the sege and^ come the xxvij: day of
Iuyll in ye same year with a great host and a strong pouer and^ neyghed to the
sege of Calais The which Philip the last day of Iulij sent to king Edward word
that he would yef him plain bataill the iij: day after that about euensong time
if he durst cum fro the seege and^ abide. And when king edward herd that with
out any long tarieng or long a visement he accept gladly the day and hour of
bataill yt Philip had assigned. And when the king of france herd that the next
night after he set his tentis a fire and^ remeued and^ went away thens
cowardly. Than they that were i^ the town and in the castle beseged seeing all
this how that they had none other help ne socour of the king of france ne of
his men. And also that there vitales within them were spendit and wasted and
forfaut of vitales and of refrishing they eten horse hounds cattes and myce for
to keep there truth as long as they might And when they saw and wos found among
them. at the last that they had no thing among them for to ete ne live by ne no
socour ne rescueng of the frenshmen of that other side they wist well that they
most nedis die for defaut or el^s yield the town. and anon tho they wenten and
token down the baners and the arms of france on eueri side that were hongen
out. and wenten on the walls of the forsaid town on diverse places as naked
as over they were borne sauf only there shertis and there prive clothes and held
there swerdis naked and ye point donward in thi^ hondis and puten ropes and
halters about there nekkis and yelden up the keys of the town and of the Castill
to king Edward of england with great fere and dred of heart And when king Edward
saw this as a marciabul king and lord receued all to grace and a few of the
gretest personers of state and of governance of the town he sent in to
england there to abide there ranson and the kings grace. And all the comminalte
of the town the king let go whider they would in pees. and with out any harm.
and let them bear with them all there things that they might bear and carry
away keeping the town and the Castle to him self. Than through mediacion of
Cardinales that were sent from the pope trews was teke there bitwen france and
england for ix. months than next foloyng. and about mihelmasse king edward
come again in to england with a glorius victory. And in the xxiij. year of his
regne in the est parties of the world there arose and began a pestilence and
death of sarise^s and paynyms that so great a death wos never herd of a fore. And
that wasted away the people so. that uneath the tenth person wos left on live
And in the same year about the south cuntres also in the west contres there fell
so much rayn and so great watres. yt from cristemasse un to midsomer there was
uneaths day ne night but that it rayned sumwhat. through which waters the
pestilence wos so enfecked and so habundand in all cuntres and namli about the
court of rome and other places and see costis. that uneath there were left leuyng
fulke for to beri them that were deed honestly. But made great diches and pittes
that were wonder brod and^ deep. and^ therein beried them. and made a renge of
deed bodis. and^ cast a litell earth to hele them above. and than cast in an
oath regne of deed bodis and an other regne above them. And thus were they
beried and no^e oder wise: but if it were the fewer that were men of great estate
that were beraid as honestly as they might And after all this in the xxiiij
year of king Edwardis regne it was don him to wit and understand of a treson
that wos begun at Calais. and^ ordained for to sell that town for a great sum
of florens un to king Philip of France through the falsenesse and^ ordinance
of a knight that wos called sir Gefferey of Cherney that wos wonder prive with
king Philip of france. And when king Edward herd this he took with hi^ ye
nobles and gentiles lordis. and money other worthy and orped men of arms that
were there present with him for the sole^pnite of that high fest. And well and
wisel^y in all the have that he might and as privily os he might he wenten over
the sea toward calais. And that same year the good king edward held his
cristemasse at Hauering. And the morn after newyeres day the king wos in the
castle of Calays with his men of arms that none of the aliens wist there of. And
that falls conspiratour and traitor Geffri of Charney seth yt he might not
openli have his purpese of the castle. privily and stelynly he com in and held
the town with a great host. And when he with his men were comen in. he paid the
forsaid sum of floreyns as covenant was bitwen them to a Genewey in the
town that was keeper of the castle and consenting to the same geffri in all
this falsenesse and trechorie and bounden the englissh mynstrels and^ seruantis
that were in ye castle that they might not help them self ne let them of there
purpose And than wenyng that they had be siker enough. they speken all there
wikkednes and falsenesse openly an high that all men might here. And now shall
ye here how they were deceived. for they comen in by a prive postterne over a
litell brugge of tree and when they were comen in sotaly and privily the brigge
wos draw up and kept that none of them that comen in might go out ne no mo cu^
in to them And anon our englyshmen went out at prive holes and wyndous and
over the walls of the town and of the castle and went and faughte ma^ly with
the frenshmen that were with out and had the better of them the which when they
were occupied by them sel^f on there side The king that was with in the town
having with him scarsly but xxx. men of arms drew out his swerd and with a
loud vois he cried up an high A sent Edward A sent George. And when folk herd
that. they comen rennyng to him and yaf there to there enmys so great assaut that
there were mo than two hondrith men of arms and money mo other slain and money
fleden away. And so by the grace of god almighty the victory fell un to the
Englishmen. Than the king took with him this Geffry that was finder of this
trechorie: and also money other frensh prisoners. and^ with in a while after he
come again in to england. And in this same year and in the year before and in
thee year next after was so great pestilence of men from the est in to the west
and namli through botches that tho that seki^d on this day died on the iij. day
after to the which men that so died in this pestilence had but litell respite of
liggyng The pope Clement of his goodness and^ grace yaf them full remission
and foryefnesse of all there sins that they were shriuen of. and this
pestilence lasted in london fro Mihelmasse un to August next folewyng almost an
hole year And these days wos death without sorrow weddyngis with out frenship
wilful penance and derth without scarcite and fleyng without refute or
socour. for money fled from place to place be cause of the pestilence. but they
were enfeckid and might not ascap the death: after that the prophet Isae says
who that fleith fro the face of dred he shall fall in to the diche. And he that
windeth him out of the diche he shall be hold and^ tied with a grenne. but when
this pestilence wos cesed as god would. uneaths the tenth part of the pepull
wos left on live. And in the same year began a wonder thing yt all yt ever were
borne after yt pestilence had.ij. chekteth i^ there head las than they had a
fore.

How king Edward had a great bataill with spanyardis in the se fast by
wynchelsee.
ANd in the.xxv. year of his regne about the sent Johannes day in harvest i^
the sea fast by winchelse king Edward had a great bataill with men of spayn
where that there shippis and nauye lay chaned to gedre that other they must fight
or be dre^ched And so when all our worthy men of arms and^ the sea costs fast
by wynchelse and Romeny were gadred to geder and our nauye and shippis all ready
to the were the englisshmen met manly and^ stiffly with there enmys coming fersly
ayens them And when the spanys vessailles and navy were closed i^ all about.
there me^ might se a strong bataill on both sides and long during i^ ye which
bataill wos but few that faught but they were spitously hurt: And after the
batail there were xxiij. shippis of there is take: and^ so the englishmen had the
better. And in the next year following of his regne yt is to say the xxvi. year
ye king thugh his counsel let orden and^ make his new monay yt is to say ye
penny the grot value of iiij pens. and the half grot of ij. pens. bot it wos of
les weight than the old sterli^g wos. be v. shillyng in the pound. And in the
xxvij. year of his regne wos the great derth of vitailles the which was called
thee dear somer And in the xxviij. year of his regne i^ ye perlament holden at
westmi^stre after Ester sir Henri earl of Lancastre wos made duke of lancastre
and i^ this year wos so great a drought that from the month of march to the
mo^eth of Iuyll there fell no rayn on the earth. wherefore all frutis sedis and
herbs for the most pertie were lost in defaute. Whereof there come so great disese
of men and bestes and derthe of vitales in england so that this land that ever
before had been plenteous had need that time to feke his vitalis and refresssyng
of other out Isles and cu^tres: And i^ the xxix year of king edward it was
accordid granted and sworn bytwen the king of france and king Edward of
england that he should houe again all his landis and lordeshippis that longed to
the duchy of Gnyhen of old time the which had been with draw and wro^gfulli
occupied by diverse kings of france before hand to have and to hold to king
Edward and to his heirs and successors for ever more freely pesabully and in
good quiet upon this covenant that the king of England should leave of. and
relesen all his right and claym that he had claymed of the kingdom of france.
and of the titell that he took there of. upon which speech and couenauntis it wos
sent to the court of Rome on both sides of the kings. that the forsaid
covenant should be enbulled. bot god ordained better for the kings worsship
of englo^d^ for what through fraud and discert of the frenshmen and^ what through
lettyng of the pope and^ of ye court of rome the forsaid couenau^tis were
disquat and left of. And i^ the same year the king revoked by his wise and^
discret counsel the stapull of wol^les out of flau^dres i^ to england with all
the libertes frau^ches and^ fre customys yt longed there to^ and^ ordained it in
england in diverse places that is for to say at westmynstre. Cantorberi
Chichestre Bristow Lyncolne and Hull with all the forsaid things that longen
there to. And that this thing that should thus be done the king swore him self
there to And. prince edward his sone with other mo^y great witnesses that there
were present And the xxx. year of his regne anon after witsontide in the
parliament ordained at westmynstre it wos told and certefied to the king that
Philip that tho held the ki^gdo^ of france was deed: And that John^ his son
wos creuned king. and that this John^ had yeuen Karoll his son the Duchy of
Gnyhen^ of thee which thing king Edward when he wist there of had great
indignacion un to him and was wonder wroth and strongly meued. And therefore
before all the worthy lordis yt there were assembulled at that parliament he called
edward his son un to him to whom the duchid of Gnyhen by right heritage should
long to and^ yaf it him there. byddyng and strengthyng him that he should ordene
him for to defend him and a venge him upon his enmys and save maynten his
right. And afterward king edward hi^ self and his eldest son Edward went to
diverse places and^ seintes in england on pilgrimage for to have the more help
and^ grace of god and of his seintes. and ij. Kal^* of Iuyll when all thing wos
ready to that viage and bataill and all his retenue and pouer assembled and his

worsshipfully take received of the most nobull men and lordis of that cu^tre
And anon after king Edward took with him his ij. sonys that is to say sir
Leonell earl of vlton and sir John^ his brother earl of Richemond and sir Henri
duke of Lancastre. with money earls and lordis and^ men of arms and ij.

and afterward the king went with his folk aforsaid and with other soudiours of
beyond the se that there abide the kings coming the secund day of November and
took his journey toward king John^ of france there as he trowed to have founden
him fast by Odomarum as his lettres and covenant made mention that he would a
bide him there with his host. And when king Johan of france herd tell of the
kings conyng of england he went away with his men and cariege cowerdly and
shamfully fleyng and wastyng all vitales that the englishmen should not have
there of. And when king edward herd tell that he fled. he pursued him with all
his host till Hedene. and^ than he beholding the wanting and scarcite of
vitales and^ also the cowerdise of the king of france he turned again wastyng
all the cuntre. And while all these things were a doing the scottis priueli and
by night token the town of Berewike slayng them yt withstode them and no man
else but blissed be god the castle wos saved and kept by englismen yt were
theri^. Than the king persaued all this. he turned again i^ to england as wroth
as he might be. wherefore i^ perlament at westmynstre wos grau^tid to the king of
every sake of wolle.l. shillyng during the term of vi. year that he might the
myghtelyer fight and^ defend the reame ayens the scottis and other misdoers And
so when all things were ready the king hasted hi^ to the sege ward.

yates of the Cite. profering to them that would abide a bataill in the feld
under such condition that if the king of england were over comen there as god
forbede it should that than he should never challenge the kingdom of france And
there he had of them but sh^ort and scornful ansuer and come and told it to the
king and his lordis what he had herd and what they said. And than went forth

Englishmen made them aredy for to be a venged upon thee shame and despite that

better accord and deliberacion the frenshmen besely and with great instaunce
asked trews for there see costs and the king grauntid them. And in the morrow
after the vtas of pasche the king turned him with his host toward Orliau^ce

there fell upon them such a storm and tempast that no^e of our nation herd ne

the which tempastes full much yet fered not the king ne much of his pepull that
they ne went forth in there viage that they had begun. wherefore about the fest of

and there with all a great pestilence in england and i^ other diverse parties of
the world that it distruyd and slew violently and strongly both men and women

perlament he axed of the comynalte of the reame as he had done be fore a great
subsidi to be gr^u^ted to him for defendyng of him and^ of his reame but the
communes ansuerd that they were so often day by day grieved and charged with so
money talages and subsidies that they might no longer suffer no such burthous
and charges. and that they knew and wist well enough that the king had enough
for saui^g of hi^ and of his reame if the reame were well and^ trewly governed.
but that it had be so long evil governed by evil officers^ that the reame
might another ben plenteous of chaffre and^ merchandise ne also with riches. And
in these things they proferd them self. if the king would certanly to preue and
stand by. And if it were founden and priued afterward that the king had need.
they would gladly every man after his pouer and state him help and len. And
after this were publisshid and showed in the perlament money playntes and
defautis of diverse officers of the reame and namly af the lord Latimer thee
kings chambrelayn both to the king and eke to the reame. And also at the last
there wos spoken and treted of Dame Alice Pers for the great wrongs and evil
governance that was done by her counsel in the reame. the which dame Alice
Pers that the king had holdin money day and^ long time to his lema^. wherefore it
wos the las wondir though through the frealte of the wamanys exciting and her
steryng he consentid to her lewdness and evil counsel the which dame Alice
and^ also the lord latimer and other such that meued the king to evil
governance ayens his profet and ye reames also all the comynalte axed and
desirid that they should be meued and put away and in there stedis wise men and
worthy that were true and^ well assayed and proved and of good governance
should be put in there stedis. So among all other there wos on among the communes
that wos a wise knight and a true and an eloquent man whose name wos Pers

perlament And forth is same pers told and publesshed the troth and^ rehearsed
the wrongs ayens the forsaid Dame Alice and other certan persons and^ the
kings council as he was bod by the comuns And also trustyng much for to be
supportid and mayntened in this matter by help and and^ favor of the prince:
anon as the prince wos deid at the instance and request of the forsaid dame
Alice. This Pers delamare wos Iuged to perpetual prison in the castle of

both christian and hethen while that he leued and wos in good point wondered much
and^ drad him wonder sore whose body is worsshipfully buried in Crichirche at

dou^e their perkis and^ there closes and^ breken and slew there wild bestes and
chasid them: brekyng there fish pondis hedes and let the water of their pondis
stews and rivers run out and token the fish and bear it with them And did
them all the sorrow yt they might In so ferforth yt forsooth they had distroid
perpetually yt abbey with all there me^bres and apportenau^s but if the king the
son had helped it and take heed there to. And therefore the king sent his letters
to the earl of warwik chargyng him and co^mau^di^g him yt he should stynt
redress and amend tho evil doers and^ bakers of his pees. And so by menys of
lordis and other frendis of both sides pes and good accord and love was made
bitwen them And for this hurling as it wos said the king would not be governed
at that time by his lordis yt there were in the perlame^t but he took and made
his son the duke of lancastre his governor of the reame the which stood so
still as governor till the time that he died. The same year ano^e after
Candilmasse or the perlame^t wos done ye king asked a subsidy of the clargie

great soumes of monay of the king and his council for men of arms wagis that
he should have paid them. and took it to his own use. and he dred that at the

at Shene and is buried worshipfulli at westmynstre on whois soul god have
merci amen. This king edward was forsothe of a passing goodness and full
grecious among all the worthy men of the world for he passid and shone by virtue
of grace yef to him fro god a boue all his predicessours that were nobull men
and worthy. and he wos a well herted man and a hardy. for he drad never no
mish^ppis ne harms ne evil fortun that might fall a nobull weri our and a

passing glory and joy he had the victory. he was meke and benyngne homeli

to hi^ joyful and liki^g. And he gouned his kingdom gloriously un to his age
he was large i^ yeue^g and wise i^ spe^ces he was fulfilled with all honest of
good manners and^ virtues. under who^ to live it wos as for to regne wherefore his

under heaven had brought forth so nobull a king so gentill and so blessid. or
might raze such an other when he wos deed: Never the latter lechorie and meuyng
of his flesh haunted him in his age. wherefore the rather as it is to suppose for
unmeasurable fulfilli^g of his lust his life shorted the son. And here of take
good head like as his dedis berith witnesse^ for as in his beginning all
things were joyful and likyng to hi^ and^ to all pepull. And i^ his midde age
he passid all pepull in high Joy worship and blissednesse. right so when he
drew in to age drawyng dou^ward through lechori and other sins litell and
litell all tho joyful and blissid things and prosparite decreced and
mishappid and^ infortunat things and^ unprofitable harms with money euels
began for to spring and the more harm is it continued long time after.

lust un to lechery. and the end wos with out honor for he went greatly from the
manners and the vertuus of his nobull fadre And he wos crouned with the
impariall dyodeme and the wisdom of his father passed in to Sygmunde his
brother as after shall apeyr.

Vrbanus was pope after Gregarie vi. year. This vrbane wos chosen in the cite
of Rome by the strength of the Romans. but the Cardinals did that for dred.
and not willengly. where fore they fled un to the Cite of Fundorum. And they
said that he was not Pope. And chose in his place sir Robert of Gebennys the
same year the which was called Clement the vij. Nota And here began the xxij.
striffe in the chirch And it was more wors then ever wos any other before. for
it was so sotell that the wisest men that were and the best conciencied culd not
discern with whom it wos best to say and hold. And this striffe durit xl. year
with a great sclaunder unto all the clargie and great parell un to men sowles for
herisees and other ill things thee which were brought in then. In so much that
there wos no doctrine in the chirch for misdoyng^ And there for from this vrbane
the vij: un to Martine I know not who was pope The fest of the visitacion of
our lady was ordained by vrbane the sext. after the form of the Sacrament of
the auter for a pees and a unite for to be had among them through the merits of

thought to avenge hi^ upon them as soon as god would send him grace and might.
and ano^e let make te^nys balls for the Dolphyn in all the have that might be.
And they were great gonstonys for the Dolphyn to play with all. And than anon
the king sent for all his lordis and held a great counsel at westmynster and

present that he sent to him and to his lordis to play with all And there the

saved them from thees perllous menye. And for to have done this they resaued of
the frenshmen a Million of gold. and that wos there openli pruued And for their
falls treson they were all there Iuggid un to the death and this was the Judgment
that they should be lad through Hampton and without north gate there to be heded.

this wos done the king and all his menye made them ready and went to ship and
sailled forth with xv. hundred shippis and arrived within Seyn at Kydecause upon
our ladies eve the Assumpcion in Normandy with all his ordinance. And so went
him forth to Harflet and he beseged the town all about by la^d and eke by
water. and sent to the capitayn of the town and charged him to deliver the
town. And the capitayn said that he deliuerid him none. ne none he would him

he did un to them and besought him of viij days of respite and trews if any
rescu might cum un to them: and else to yield up the tou^e un to hi^ with all there
goodis. and than the king sent forth the capitayn and kepid the remenau^t still
with him. And the lord Gaucorte that was capitayn of the town went forth to
Royn in all ye have un to the Dolphyn for help and socour bot their was none ne
no man of rescue. for the Dolphyn would not abide And thus this capitayn come
again un to the king and yild up ye town and delivered him the keis. And than
he called his uncle ye earl of Dorset and made him capitayn of ye town of
Harflet and delivered hi^ ye keis. and bad him go and^ put out all the frensh
people both me^ women and child and stuff his tou^e of harflet with english
pepull. And than the king sent in to England and did cry i^ every good town
of England that what crafti man would cum thidder and inhabit him there in that
town he should have house and household to hi^ and to his heiris for ever more
And so theder went money diverse marchantis and crafti men and enhabyted them
there to strength the town And were welcome. And when the king saw that this
town wos well stuffed both of vitaill and of men. this worthy prince took his
leave. and went to Calais ward by land. and the frenshmen herd of his coming
they thought for to stop^e him his way that he should not pass yt way and in
all the have that they might brekyn all the brigges there where any pessage wos
for horse and man in so much that there might no man pass over the Rivers nothir
on horse ne on foot: bot if he should be drenchid. And therefore our king with
all his pepull went and sought his way far up to paris ward. And there wos all
the riall pouer of france assembled and ready to yef him bataill and for to
distroy all his pepull. But almyghti god wos his gyde and saved him and all his

king of abone. yt he would grant him that day the avau^teward in his batall and
the king granted him his askyng. and^ said grant merci cosi^ of york and
prayed him to make him ready And than he had every man to ordeyn him a stake of

there enmys should not over cum them on horse bake. For that wos there falls purpose
and araied them all there for to over ride our menye sodenli at the frist

Of the law of king henri the v. and what he ordained for king Richard and for
him self after his death.
HEre is to be notid that this king Henri the v. wos a nobull prince after he
wos king and crouned. how be it be fore in his yougth he had been wild recheles
and^ sparid no thing of his lust ne desires: but accomplisshed them after hrs
likyng. but as soon as he wos crouned ennoynted and sacred anon sodenli he was
changed in to a new man and set all his intent to live vertuusly in mayntenyng
of holy chirch. destroyng of heritikis. Keeping Justice and^ dofendyng of his
reame and subiettis And for as much as his fadre had deposid by his labor the
good king Richard. and pytously made him to die. and for the ofence done to him
aynest his legeaunce. he had sent to rome to be asoyled thereof. For which
offense the pope our holy fadre enjoined him to make him be prayed fore
perpetually. and^ like as he had done to be taken from him his natural life
there fore he should do found iiij. tapers to brene perpetually about his body.
that for the extinccion of his bodyli life his soul may ever be remembrid and^
live in heaven in spiritual life And also yt he should every weke on the day as
it com about of his death have a solemn mass of requiem and^ on the even

pre^tises: held the maire and sheriues still in ch^pe and would not suffer them
to depart un to the time that there fellow which wos committed to ward were
delivered. and so by force they rescued there fellow from prison. and that done
the maire and sheriues departed and^ the prisoner delivered. which if he had
been put to prison had be in iupardie of his life And than began a romur in the
cite against ye lumbardis and the same euenyng the handcraftimen of the town

wisdom as for the were he much trusted. And when they were^ thus assembled and
made there feld The king sent out his comissions and prive seals un to all the
lordis of his reame to cum and await on him in there most best defensable array.
and so every man come in such wise that the king wos stronger and had much more
pepull than the duke of york and^ the earls of warwik and salisberi. For it is
here to be noted that every lord in england at this time durst not disobey the
queen: for she rewled peasibly all that was done about the king which wos a good
simple and an Innocent man And than when the king wos comen to the place where
as they were. the duke of york and^ his feliship had made there field in the
strongest wise* and had purposid verily to have byden and have foughten. but in
the night Andrew Trollop and^ all the old soudiours of Calais with a great
feliship suddenly deperted out of ye dukis host and^ went streght un to the
