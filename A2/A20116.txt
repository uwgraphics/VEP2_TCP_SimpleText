THE MOST CRVELL and bloody Murder of Anthony James in Hatfield in
Hartford-shire.
HErodotus writes of Sesostris a King of the Egiptians, that be (...)carried
in a Chariot drawn with four Kings, whom he before had conquered, when one of
the four, casting his eyes behind him, looked often upon the wheels of the
Chariot; which Sesostris earnestly noting, at last demanded of him what he
meant by looking back so often, who replied, I see that those things which
were highest in the wheels become lowest, and the lowest as soon become
highest, cogito de mutatione fortunae, I think upon the inconstancy of
things. Sesostris hereupon as in a glass beholding himself, waxed more mild,
and delivered the imprisoned Kings from that slavery.

This History then so lively expressing the mortality of man's life, that to
the highest belongs a grave, as soon as to the lowest, and that man himself is
a witness to himself, how uncertain are his days, (since sin has spread
it self like a leaprosie over all flesh, and iniquity has gotten the upper
hand) that a Spider is able to choke us, a hair to stifle us, and a tile
falling on our heads to extinguish us, and in that moment when we least suspect
so sudden Calamities.

Our life then is so momentarie, that in that minute we breath, if not
defended by our maker, in that minute we are breathless: should any flesh,
endowed with that heavenly reason which God has only given to men and angels,
so forget his uncertainty, as for a little gold which is but the dregs of the
earth, for vanity, (the pleasures of the world) or for the world it self
which is an Hypocrite, because it has exterior appearance of goodness, and
within is full of corruption and vanity, which is but like to reeds, that when
they shoot out first in the spring of the year, do with their fresh green
color delight the eye for a while, but if we break them and look within them,
we find nothing but emptiness and hollownesse* forget his maker and the
dignity of his creation, who made him like to himself, to his own Image and
likeness, to the intent, that as all other creatures of their own proper
natures do love their like, so should man set his affection on God alone,
where contrarily, he being the hand of heaven, made for virtuous dispositions,
conducts himself to vicious actions, whereby it follows certainly, that men
in their lives are like children, who more delight of a horse made of reeds,
and babes formed of clowtes, than in the things themselves, so man gives more
honor to the shadow, than to the truth, and indeed (as in this whole course)
but like birds, who greedily fly to pecke up the corn till they be caught in
the ginne: or like fishes, who earnestly swim to catch the bait, though they
be choakt with the hook: so do many, how indirectly soever, hunt after
riches, til they deface their bodies be the law, and condemn their souls by
their sin, as shall appear by this following discourse.

SOme Four years since near Deuonshey Hundred in Essex lived a Yeoman one
Anthony James, who in repute of the world was counted rich, and by the report
of his Neighbors held credible and honest.

This man in the desire of his youth matched himself to an honest
Countrey-maide, whose virtuous disposition equald his own thoughts, and whose
diligent care was carefully to save what her husband brought home, as his
labor did strive to procure it abroad; so that the providence of the one, and
the care of the other, mixed such a mutual content between them, that they
lived like Abraham and Sara, he loving to her, she obedient to him.

In process of time this couple growing wealthy by their labor, proved to be
as happy by their issue, for it it pleased God to enrich them with two
children, a Boy, and a Girl, that the wishes of the Father might be as well
satisfied, as the desire of the Mother, and both contented in so comfortable a
blessing.

The Mother being (as women use to say) stored first with a Daughter, and
called it by her own name Elizabeth James, so that when time brought the
Father as happy rejoicing of a Son, he christened it by his own name
Anthony James. In the education and bringing up of these two Children, there
was a pretty loving contention between the Goodman and the Wife, which of the
two should prove most happy to the Parents delight, whose love indeed was
alike to them both. So that time passing away in that comfortable strife
between this loving couple, the Daughter had attained to the age of Eight
years, and the Son to Seven, in which passage the mother having no other
issue, was then with child with the third, and the better half of her time
had carried so happy a burden.

About that season of the year a Fair happened in Essex, to which the
Servants they then kept, some for pleasure, the rest about necessary business
were sent, so that the honest Yeoman with his wife and children were only left
at home, when mischief like a bramble that takes hold on whatsoever it
touches, caught this occasion, and wrought in the minds of Nine, I cannot call
them men, but villains, and another not a woman, but a beast to make a prey of
these harmless four, and their increast possessions: but ^s Finis est primum
in intensione,
Vltimum in executione.


So these wretches having fastened on this monstrous intent, made have to the
execution thereof, and so soon had attained to this wealthy Yeomans house,
where finding little or no resistance, they first bound the man and the woman,
and giving the two children to two of their associats to hold, the rest fell
to ransacke, where not contenting themselves with that store of riches they
found, as Gold, Silver, Plate, Rings, and other wealth, having made up their
pack, they consulted with themselves for their further security, to make
spoil of the owners. It was not long in question ere this hellish Jury had
given up as damnable a verdict, for ( suspicion always haunting a guilty
mind,) they determined with themseules they could not be safe from pursuit,
from attachment, nay from shameful death, which they worthily deserved,
without the slaughter of the father and the mother, which they presently
resolved upon, and then two of them stepping to the man, where he lay bound
upon the ground, with their daggers stobbed him in the body: who ere his speech
left him, lifting up his eyes, begged only this of them; take my riches, I cared
for them to bring up my posterity, but now they are yours, I give them you
freely; then pity my wife, be merciful to my children. These his last words
seemed to beget some remorse (seldom seen) in the men which were murderers,
which the more than monstrous woman perceiving (as in a rage thereat) stepped to
his wife, and calling to him with these words; Talkest thou of pity quoth
she, if thy eyes have yet left so much sight to be witness how i will be
pitiful? behold how I Will perform thy peticion. So drawing out her knife, (O
act too terrible to report, but the most damnablest that ever was heard of,
executed by a woman) she ripped her up the belly, making herself a tragical
midwife, or truly a murtheresse, that brought an abortiue babe to the world,
and murdered the mother.

The good woman having not leave to cry, and her husband having not the use of
speech, they both lift up their hands, rowld their eyes one to another, and
with that said, but silent; Farewell ever.

This tragical spectacle enforced all the rest partakers in the robbery, and
actors in the murder to remorce, nay even to a repentance; that done, this
horrible action had a beginning: but sin always seeking securely to shroud
it self in, they began now to question of their safety, and (as villains are
ever one afraid and in distrust of another) they conclude now to share their
purchase, and every Knave to shift for himself.

Some urged let us first kill the children, as we have done their parents,
others and the greater part glutted with the present object, and even ashamed
of themselves and their sinful actions, not only denied, but confidently
resolved they would be no further guilty in the blood of Innocents. In brief
they agreed every party to have an equal portion of this ill purchased booty,
which soon shared amongst them, and as it appeared, having more than they
could tell what to do withal, they gave the remain to three of their
Consorts, of which the woman was one to convey away the children from thence,
and bestow them in what place soever, while they would give their Parents
burial.

This was as soon done as talked of, seven of them carried the dead couple from
the house to a wood near adjoining, and there buried them, and the other three
are gone to travel with the children.

These Monsters thus divided, whether of a determinate before of ancient
acquaintance, or drawn by what means soever, it yet rests undiscovered to the
world. These two men, this woman, and these two children the next day some
three hours before night, came to Bishops Hatfield in Hartford shire seuenteen
miles from London, the children being on a horse in a pair of Panniers, the
woman riding between them, as it had been to visit some of their friends,
then they took up their Inn at one Dels house: and being brought to their
chamber, they called for their Hostess, when after some other parle had
between them, they demanded of her, if she would be secret in a business,
they would unfold unto her, who presently without further pawse, replied, I as
God should judge her would she, when straight they began to discover to her
their whole proceedings, showed her what riches they had got, and told her they
were willing to make her a Partaker therein, only they craved her advise, how
they should dispose of the children, all this was spoken in the hearing of the
Girl. To which Dels wife, as by the sequel appeared soon gave this her
consent and instruction, that the Boy should be murdered, and his sister have
her tongue cut out.

This, thus resolved upon, they fell to drinking, and who so merry as this
devilish company, all this while the girl sat on the frame at the tables end,
and in the mean time, the boy was strayd down the stayres, where being
playing up and down in a lower room, this Dels wife having a labourer at
work in her backside to make her bauins, called Nicholas Dracon, it was his
chance to come in to call for drink, where taking note of it, by the pretines
of the behavior it used; his Hostess passing by him, he demanded of her
whose child it was, who answered it belongs to a guest or two that are now
above, the honest labourer having drunk his drink that he came for, went
back to end his business in the yard, while the child (they being above in the
heat of their cups, and not regarding him) strayd out into the street, where
one Neuey whelpe lay: the tailor taking notice of him, especially by a green
coat with nine skirts about the wast, the fassion then being new for children,
he called the boy to him to take a pattern thereof, and having satisfied his
desire by noting it well and taking measure of the child, the tailor as the
labourer, goes back to his work, and the boy returns to Dels house.

By this time night coming on, as the fit mark for villains to act their
villainies under; these wretches having supt with the children, as if no such
pretense, which inwardly they intended, had lurked in their bosoms outwardly,
bare themselves fair to the little ones, and when they thought it fit time,
went to bed together all in our Chamber, the chamber having three beds in it,
the men together, and the women with the children, who in the dead of the
night, the time created for quiet rest, the ease of labor, and the honest man's
repose; these Homesides rising from their beds, and having a candle ready,
awaked the children* made them ready, and with flattering words told them, they
must go to their father and mother, when they poor hearts (as willing to
obey, as they to demand, little dreading they were going to such a shambles,
as they had prepared for them) came down with them, and at the stairs foot
stood the son to this Hostess called George Dell (who belike the mother had
acquainted herein) and calling to the men bad them come on and doubt nothing,
for he had seen the coast was clear, whereupon opening the back door, they
went into the yard, where this Inkeepers wife used to milk her Kine, and in
which stood a great Stacke of wood, where delivering the Girl to the woman,
and George Dell to stay with, took the boy and leading him behind the pile,
first stopping his mouth with Cow dung that he might make no noise, they slit
up his throat from one ear to another. This inhumane murder thus acted, they
return to the house, told Dels wife and her son the deed was done: quoth Dels
wife, then George thou shall conduct them to bottomless Pond, where for our
more safety, they shall end our cause of mistrust, or fear to be discovered by
throwing him in. When George Dell presently stepping to the Woodstacke, and
choosing out a good big stake, he with the help of the rest bound thereon the
dead child with a hairen rope, and George Dell himself taking a long Pike
staff on his shoulder, lead them the way toward botomelesse Pond, being a
mile from Hatfield, while the 2 thieves upon the stake carried the boy, and the
strumpet led the Girl in her hand.

George Dell thus before leading the way, the 2 thieves in the midst with ye
dead boy, after them comes (I may rightly call her so) the whore with ye sister
in her hand, who (what with drowsinesse, and what with fear) seemnng to lag,
for the night being vnco^fortable to me^, it must needs be to children, the
monstrous femall (for no woman) began to egg her on with fair persuasion,
Come apace sweetheart, thy brother is before, and we are going to thy father
and thy mother.

The poor Girl encoraged with the remembrance of her Parents names, whose
lives they had extinguished from her, as if the names of them (who first gave
her life) could have created a new motion in her, (as far as her childhood and
feeble strength would give her leave) hastened after, and by the way called to
her with these words. Gammer, shall my mother make me ready to morrow morning,
kiss me when I come from school, and hear me say my lesson? The devilish
Devil answered (not having remorse, being remembered of the execrable act she
had done) I. when she sees thee next, she shall do all this.

The men hastening on before with ye pitiful burden of a murdered brother,
when she the diuellisht of all came after with a tender sister, and by the way
began to ask her of several circumstances as where she was borne, who were
her parents, and what her name was? when the child answering to every question
according to her remembrance so pretyly, that if her leader had had left in her
any spark of womanhood, who by nature are kind, flexible, and remorseable,
and not been made up for one to be damned, she would have pitied her.

But who are created to be Murderers, are created to be remorselesse, and so
was she, only beguild the way with these and other such like questions, as
what we walked upon, what she saw withal and what she spoke withal, when the
innocent Child (suspectlesse that her own tongue should be her own betrayer)
according to her discretion answered to every one, directly pointing to her
foot, her eye, and to her tongue, that with those, and by the help of those
she saw, went and spoke. Whereupon this bloody Tygris* to make her self more
monstrous, bad her put out her tongue that she might feel it, (being at this
time come just to a style, where she sat down, and told the Girl that they
would rest themselves a while) when the child, (little dreading it should be
the last time she should make use of it, doing what she bad her) she presently
caught it by the end, and with her thumb wresting open the child's iaws to the
widest she could stretch them, she cut it out even by the root: the Girl
hereat beginning to make her just lamentation, this She-wolfe holding her knife
to her throat, bad her peace, or she would slit that as she had slit her tongue;
so that for her pain enforced by fear (only as the blood exceeded in her
mouth she still spot out that) the woeful child was quiet, when the strumpet bad
her hold up her aperne, and she would give her her tongue again, and look
(quoth she) you loose it not, for you must bear it to your brother. By this
time (with their conductor George Dell) the men had discharged themselves of
their burden by bottomless Pond, throwing the stake and Boy they brought
(and bound him withal) into a Corn field, and the child with her tongue in
her aperne, and in the whores hand had overtaken the^, when presently went to
act this last stratageme which before they had agreed upon, and threw the Boy
(as he was in his clothes) into the pond, giving him for his requie^ farewell,
no other funeral rites and christian burial, but these words; sink there in
stead of a mother-graue, ye dead child thus in the pond, the whore (as if she
had felt her self sick) not being an exercised actor in more villainy, having
forced the child to be sad (beholding first of her brothers untimely murder,
and now of his watery grave) not resting here, made the distressed Infant take
her tongue (the instrument of her speech) out of her aperne, and throw it after
her brother, and as it was thrown from her hand, she uttered these words, Let
it go and spare not, it cannot be better bestowed, they are near a kin
together.

The murdered brother thus bestowed, and his sister speechless, these
vilaines having contented Dels wife for her counsel, and so bountifully that
where it was credibly known, the Lease of her Inn was (at the time of this
action) at pawn for 50 l. she presently fetched it home, and bestowed a 100.
Marks more in building. The next morning before day they parted; yet in their
parting this was resolved upon between them, that the dumb Girl with some
little piece of money should be given unto a beggar to travel with, and she so
disposed of, they were certain never to be discovered.

The next day in Hatfield wood (some 2 miles from Hatfield) this determination
took effect, and a beggar for a piece of money, took the Wench promising to
keep her, as many such Rogues use for one to beg withal. The child
received, and the money paid, the 2 thieves and the whore departed: when the
beggar (whether not liking the bargain least after he should pay too dear for
it, of slight care or self-will, it is yet unknown) he lost the child in
Hatfield wood, where shortly after it was found in a hallow tree, and having
received some little cherishing of some well disposed people about the
wood-side, from thence it strayd to Barnet, from Barnet to London, where
happening in the dumb manner, it used to beg at one Master Allens door a
Barber-surgeon for some relief, the Master coming himself to the door, and
seeing the child make such pitiful signs to the mouth, he took it by the hand
and led it into his shop, and opening her mouth to know the cause of the grief
it complained of, found the tongue to be cut out, and the wound vnheald, who
(pitying the misfortune of the child) of his own charitable disposition,
cured it. The mouth thus healed, for 4 years space together, the Girl has
been known in many countries to beg for her food, sometimes about London,
sometimes in Essex, but most she has been remembered (as is certainly by divine
providence of heaven, that by her these villainies should come to light) to be
resident in Hartford shire, she was never known to speak any sillables tending
to speech, only hoarsly she could mutter when any one spoke to her in stead of
answer Moka, moka, and so near her tongue was cut out to the root, that the
food any charitable persons bestowed on her, she had no tongue to help her to
swalow it, but after she had chawd it in her mouth, she was feign to pull out
the skin of her throat with her fingers, and gulpe it down; in this dumb manner
she continued 4 years. We will leave her begging for her living, and return to
her murdered brother in bottomless pond.

This Child having remained three weeks in the pond, on Saint Peter's day in
the morning (for at that time of the year happened this Tragedy) some
Gentlemen and others (being a hunting for Wild-foule) happened with their dogs to
beat about this Pond; when one of these dogs having scented the child (as
where it was rose up under the weeds at a banke-side) whined and cried, and by
no means could be beat or drawn from thence, which eagerness of the
Spaniels, wrought a desire in the men to know certainly the cause thereof, and
with their long staves turning up the weeds, found there a Boy to be drowned,
as they coniectured; when carrying news thereof to the town, the body was by
the Crowner taken up, and laid openly for the view of all men to take knowledge
of it.

The whole Country near thereabouts coming at the strangeness of the
report, that a child should be murdered and then thrown into a pond, yet
none could challenge in him the right of a son; yet the aforesaid Henry
Whilpley, Nicholas Deacon, and diverse others of Hatfield, made testification
both by apparel* and other signs (for the Boy had a red head) that this was
the child, who three weeks before was seen in Dels house, so many then
signified to the Justice: Dels wife was sent for, for her husband was a blind
man, when being demanded if such a child were not brought to her house, (as
before is spoken) and who they were that brought it thither, when she
constantly denied, she knew of no such, and for certain she could affirm,
that no such child did lodge at her house, and being offered her oath, hereupon
she was as ready to swear as resolute to deny, but who knows not lying and
swearing are partners, and as inseparable companions as a thief and a
receiver, and (as I may say) sworn brethren, that always iumpe together in a
sinful society: her oath being taken (see the just judgment of God, she had
not power to confess that truth which would have wrought her out of all
suspicion, but utterly ^^nying that which was so manifestly proved against
her) the Justices thought it requisite (till further proof could be had on
this presumption) to bind her over to give answer at the next Assizes.

When from assizes to assizes, during the passage of four years she was
compeld to appear, nothing being further found against her, but her own
denial; whereupon the first demand, if she had made but this persuasion and
satisfying answer, as Judge Daniell very worthyly urged against her at ye
trial, that keeping an Inn, she had many guests, and many children lay at
her house, of which number (for ought she knew) that might be one, but who
brougt them, from whence they come, or whether they will, she is not bound to
take notice of. This might have been some instance of her innocence, but so to
deny a question, the truth of which was not of sufficiency to hear her argues,
a suspicion and mistrust of her self, and proves her to be guilty.

But to the former matter, she having made her appearance at so many several
assizes and sessions, and no instance against her, but the former, it was
thought at lent assizes last, she should have been dismissed the Court: but in
ye mean time such is the just judgment of God, to the plague of murderers,
and terror of them that delight in bad, the dumb shall speak ere they shall
escape undiscovered.

For the dumb sister of this murdered child, for when she was in question,
led (no question) four year up and down, from town to town, from country
to country, by the hand of God was at Michaelmas last brought unto Hatfield,
before whose coming thither, though Dels wife was by the grauer judgments held
in some suspicion, yet was her honest carriage such to taruelors, and to all
sorts of people she had to deal withal, that generally the whole country
acquitted her, and held her of honest condition; for since the time of this
murder it is credibly reported, that betwixt that and a hundred mile from
thence, man's meat and horse meat was not to be had so reasonable as then, nor
to a trauailer better usage.

Well the girl is come to Hatfield, and having been there two days straying
from place to place; the third day she happened upon Dels house, where,
whether it were by esspeciall note taken before, but rather truly to be judged
by the divine instinct of heaven, to every one that came by her, she would
make such pitiful action, as would have pitied any reasonable creature to
have beheld her, as tearing of her hair, pointing to her throat, stopping of
her mouth, poynting to the woodstacke, and in the motion hereof, shed tears as
bitter as if her brothers former murder had been in present action.

This strangeness noted through all the town, bred a wonder in the people,
and the rather for that the girl by no means could be drawn from thence; at
last the Bailiffe of Hatfield, taking advise with some of his brethren,
consulted together, how they might try whether the dumb did this, as tending
to the revelation of some concealed suit, or provoked thereunto by ignorance,
and in searching many ways, at last it came in their minds, that their
neighbor Dels wife had of long been in question about a child, taken up in
bottomless Pond (some four year since) or thereabout, whereupon they agreed to
question the girl upon what particulers, they could best think upon to that
purpose, and withal remembering that by command from the Justices of the
shire, they had reserved the murdered childs cote, and purposed to make
trial, if her remembrance could take any knowledge of it, but first resolved
to tempt her memory, by showing her diverse others.

The girl brought into a parlor amongst them, they began first to ask her of
her name, as, is thy name Iohane, Alis, Agnis Frauncis, Besse, and ever as they
spoke her right name which was Elizabeth, she would laughand rejoice; on the
contrary, at the naming her wrong seem discontent.

They having thus a knowledge of her name, began to question her further, if
she never had had a brother; when ^resently she (as she accustomed before) fell
a creeping, ma^ing all the former signs in the former order; then they asked
her what clothes he used to go in, and she to the best declaration she could,
made signs thereof; whereupon they showed her many childrens Coats of several
colors, and ever as she happened upon a green, that she would kiss, and cry,
ever throwing all the rest from her, with so lovely and lively action, that
they were confident the murdered Boy was her brother; at last they brought to
her the right coat, which after she had earnestly taken note of, the poor
child grew to that vehement passion, as if in the sight thereof, she had
seen another brother murdered, when by no persuasion, offerings, gifts, nor
no course that could be taken, to part from the coat, as it for the loss of a
brother, she would keep it as a remembrance of him. All which signified to the
Justices and Knights of the Shire, the town had an especial charge to
provide more carefully for her, and not to suffer her any longer to lie in the
streets, and her brothers coat was given to her to wear out.

This wonder, the only table-talke in the Country, though often brought to
the widow Dels ear, she made slight of it, (persuading her sele belike) that
with her honest report and store of wealth, the Child having not a tongue to
utter any thing in her reproof to wrest out of it, which (no question) she had
done, notwithstanding all the arguments and instances against her. But see the
wonderful works of God, an example able to make all people, that for desire
of riches, honor, promotion, or what titles soever would be a Murderer or
consent thereunto, to loath the thought thereof, even in the creation, and
content themselves with their estate (how mean soever,) rather than seek to
rise by indirect means, knowing that a guilty conscience Salamander-like lives
always in fire, that his days are dreadful, his nights terrible, that he
that admits sin in himself, kills himself, that to dishonest pleasure is
begot a companion repenting, and enrich himself with this saying, Somnia
bonorum meliora quam malorum.


And though I live poor, I live rich in this, that I am virtuous, I am not a
Bondman to my thoughts, nor slave to my affections, Nemo liber qui seruit
cupiditatibus.


This Wench (as before is reported) being by the direction placed where she had
relief; one day, some month before Christmasse last, going to play with the
Goodwifes daughter where she soiourned in a Park joining to Hatfield
(commonly called the Kings Park) as they were in sport together, a Cock hard
by them* fell a crowing, when the other Girl mocking the Cock with these
words, Cocka doodle do, Peggy has lost her shoe, and called to her Besse,
can not thou do so? When presently the Girl in the like manner did so;
which, drawing the other child into amazement, she presently left her, and ran
home crying out as she went, the dumb Girl Besse can speak, the dumb Girl
Besse can speak. The wonder caused all the town to gather in flocks, and ran
to meet her, but the bailiffe and the Constables (more discreet than the rest)
kept the Hurry from her: when she answered them to every question directly, and
forthwith began in order to reveal the former Murders, as before is mentioned.

Speedy news was carried to all the chief men in the Shire, who driven into
astonishment with the report, and the miraculous accident, that a Child
without a tongue should speak both discreetly and distinctly, to the revealing
of so monstrous a Murder, and by the crowing of a Cock (that bird that put
Peter in mind of his great sin in denying our Savior and his Master) was
the Herald to proclaim to this child, when she should speak these things,
that by her the wonderful works of God might be glorified, and the Murders
discovered.

But the lives of the Kings Subjects, and those which til then, had been
reputed honest* being now like to depend on her justification: the Justices
were very careful to sift her by several examinations, to see if they could
find her alter or trippe in any part of her former discourse, as Sir Raph
Conesbye, Sir Henry Butler, Master Auditor, and Master Auditor Curle, to the
number of 14 Knights and grave Gentlemen of note Justices of peace, took her
several examinations, when in the general there could not be one found that
differed in a syllable; nay though some of them threatened her with what
vengeance God would stir up for her in hell, and plagues here upon earth, if
she persisted to be a liar, and a murderer, both which would conclude in her
(by the death of Dels wife and her son) if she perseuered in this testimony.
Others in milder train dealt with her, as by fair persuasions, golden
promises, that from ye state of a beggar, where till then she had lived, she
should now be exalted and maintained by them in the same degree as their own
children, making them stand present objects to alter her, neither of which
could make her distant in any thing, but in brief satisfied the^ with this
answer. I must not lie, I have that within me bids me tell truth.

Notwithstanding this, one of Sir Henry Butlers men (to make a further trial
of her constancy herein, watching her abroad in the same Park, where first her
lost speech was reueald unto her) attired himself in a vizard with horns, and
(as we commonly say) like a Devil, and out of a thicket stepped before her, and
threatened her, that in that place where she first spoke, he would tear her
in pieces for belying George Dell and his Mother; when the Girl though in
common it does appear she should have been frighted from her constancy) only
answered thus. Good Gaffer Devil do not hurt me, I speak nothing but truth,
and what the thing within me instructs me to speak With the wonder of this
Miracle (time passing away) and people coming from all places to be eye and
eare-witnesse thereof, the Assizes were to be held at Hartford, where
(according as they were bound) George Dell and his Mother appeared, and being
called to their trial (as in form of law in such cases are provided) they
pleaded, not guilty; when the Girl (as boldly in accusing, as wonderful in
speaking) gave evidence against them, saying, that since God had lent her a
speech by miracle, she would with that inspired breath, follow the law of
them, and have their bloods lawfully, who stole away her brother. Dels wife
being yet asked by the Judge, whether such lodged in her house or no? who yet
continued her denial; when the aforesaid Henry Whelpley, Nicholas Deacon,
with others, were ready to auow the being there, besides many credible persons
of Hatfield, who in the life of her husband, (being a blind man, and living in
great discontent together) has often heard him say: thou may rise a while,
but a day will come when thy villainies and murders will appear, when thy fall
shall be low enough. Upon this evidence (the Jury going together) they were
found guilty, and a verdict returned: whereupon the Judge according to course
proceeded in sentence against them, where learnedly he instructed them, that
since God had revealed them Murderers (as from the tongues of Babes and
sucklings, that a child spoke by miracle to her discovery, and that accordingly
they were cast by 12 credible men of their own country) they would yet look
into themselves, seeing how near they were unto their graves, and make that
more plain which yet lay somewhat obscure, namely, who were partakers with
the^ in that bloody action: but nothing prevailing to molify their obdurat
hearts, briefly thus they replied: since the law has cast us, we desire to die.
Whereupon the 2 of August being Saturday, having received their sentence, they
were conveyed to the Goal, where being permitted to be together as long as
they had stay in this world; by a prisoner that lay over them, was heard this
conference. Mother (quoth George Dell) the law has cast me, and I am resolved
for death, I pray you (if you can) resolve the world, whether I am guilty or
no? Who answered him, Son be contented, take thy death patiently, it is now
too late, I have spoken what I will. The young ^^n spending the time he had to
live, in prison and prayer, and singing of Psalms, that if the outward
appearance may be a perfect witness in earnest repentance, till Monday the 4 of
August, where being with his mother, by the Iaylor delivered to the Sheriff,
his Mother having by suit obtained, that she might see her Son first suffer
death, they were executed at the common place of execution; the young man
(though the Mother before this was beloved) the most lamented for.

The several practices of Iohane Harrison, and her daughter, condemned and
executed at Hartford for Witchcraft, the 4 of August last, 1606.
AT the Assizes held in the beginning of August last in the County of Hartford,
in the Kings Majesty's behalf for Jail delivery, there were by the verdict
of the Country, Four only Offenders found worthy to have deserved death, of
which 2 (as have been spoken of, the Mother and the Son) for murder, and one
Iohane Harrison, and her daughter for damnable Witchcraft, wrayed time that
offenses should come thus prodigious, that the Offspring borne to be a comfort
to the Parents, and the parents as much to be delighted in the Children, should
be cause of one another untimely death and fatal overthrow.

This I. H. dwelling at Royston in the said County of Hartford, of long time
having been suspected for witchcraft; now (upon just cause) was apprehended,
and her house according to the true course of Justice, being searched, there was
found in a chest of hers, such sufficient instruments, (which she after confessed
were helps to her in her practices) that could there have been no other
proof nor evidence against her, they only had been sufficient to judge her
unworthy of long life. This Chest being opened, there was first taken out by
the Offi^^^^ all the bones due to the Anatomy of man and woman, and under them
hair of all colors that is customarily worn; in the bottom was found a
parchment lapt up in a compass no bigger than a groat, but being open, was in
breadth every way 2 spans; in ye midst of this parchment was colored (in the
purest colors) a heart proportionable to the heart of a man; and round about
fitting even to the very brim of the parchment, were colored in several
colors very curiously divided branches, on which hung dangling things like
ashen keys, and at the ends of them in some places figured, and others
proportioned a mouth, in brief the whole joints and artiers of a man.

This I.H. being upon her examination, and finding such apparent witness induct
against her of her several fellonies and murders, neglected not to confess
her utmost secret therein, that she had power (by the help of that parchment,
man and woman's bones, and man and woman's hair) to inflict (by the help of her
spirits, which she reported to have 2 attending on her, one for men, another
for cattle) in any joint, synnow, or place of the body, by only but pricking
the point of a needle in that place of the parchme^t, where in his or her body
she would have them tortured, which torture of hers once begun in them, their
pain should continue so restless, that a present death had bin more happier,
than so lingering a calamity; and those whom she intended to kill had the same
in effect. If she gave a prick in the middle of ye parchment, where she had
placed the heart, which relation of her may certainly be believed by the
several consequents that she was condemned upon. First a good country Yeoman
(a neighbor of hers) and she falling at some words together, he calling her old
Hagge, or some such like name of reproof: She made him this answer, I will
say little to thee, but thou shall feel more from me hereafter. The honest man
had scarce been departed from her half an hour, but he felt himself, as if
he had been set into your scotch-boote, or spanish strappado, or your Morbus
Gallicus, was nothing to it, sometimes in a pestiferous heat, at others, a
chill cold, but at al times in continual aches, and wracking of his limbs as if
the Devil had set him on his Tentors to make broadcloth of him. In this
perplexity he continued consuming himself, not being able neither to go nor
stand, nor Physic could help him, nor no means be had to ease him. When
one of his neighbors coming in neighborly love to visit him, he began to open
his mind to him, that he persuaded himself, by such a one she was bewitched,
and he was as faithfully persuaded, that if he could but have 2 or 3 good
scratches at her face, whereby he might draw blood of her, he should recover
presently, his neighbor advised him by some wile to send for her home, yet (yt
between them both held inconvenient, for that either suspecting her self, or
for not being friends she would not come) that in the night following his
neighbor would have this sick man carried in a chair, and lodged in his house,
and in the morning his wife, (who^ he knew she was good friends withal) should
by some wile or another draw her theher, wha^ if he of himself were not strong
enough to scratch her, he (as he held charily) would help him. This the next
morning was done accordingly, the Witch comes, and is well scratcht, upon which
within 3 or 4 days (as fast as the man could recover strength) he is up, and
goes abroad; which this A.H. perceiving, arrests him* and by a trial in law
for this battry had 5 s^ damages, and her costs of suit given her, the man
(according as he was condemnd) paid her, which no sooner by her received, but
ye honest man fell into his former passion, languishing a while and died: in
the same manner she served another, who meeting her out of the town in a lane,
took the like revenge upon her, and recovered. Both which blown over (only a
little murmurd against by a neighbor of hers) a young woman being washing
clothes in an outer rowme next ye street where in a wanscot cradle her child
lay a keep; when this A.H. daughter chanced to come by just in the instant as
she was throwing out a little wrinsing water, and by chance some of which
unawares sprinkled upon her, which ye wench seeming moved at, called to her
with these words. Do you throw your water upon me gossip, before it be long I Will
be revenged for it. The woman (sorry for the offense) had done, followed her
business, and thought no further of it, when on the sudde^ (while she was stepped
but into a next rowm to ha^g up some clothes) the cradle wherein her child lay,
was t^rowne over shattered all to pieces, the child upon the face whelmed under
it, and killed. Thus we see the Devil has such power on these his damnable
servants, that neither men nor infants are to be pitied by them. Not long after
she had all bewitched a wealthy man's daughter in the town, who having a good
substantial Yeoman to her brother, in pity of his Sisters grief, rode to
Cambridge, and there acquainting a friend of his with his sisters affliction:
the scholar told him she was bewitched, yet in regard they two had been of an
ancient friendship, and that himself had some acquaintance with his sister, in
spite of her Iucubi, her spirits, and the devil, and al heed help: which
according to promise he performed, and by that time her brother was returned,
his sister was recovered, in revenge of (for that her sorcery was crossed, and
the maid re^uct to health by her brothers carefulnes) she caused such a plague
upon all his cattle, that they all immediately perished, and consumed, not one
of that great store he had being left, to be a remembrance of the rest:
himself shortly after did these, and a number more at her trial were inferd
against, only one more amongst the rest, though but a homely tale, for that it
made all the Bench to laugh, I Will record of her, and conclude.

How the Witch served a Fellow in an Alehouse.
THere was an honest Fellow, and as boon a companion dwelling in Royston, one
that loved the pot with the long neck almost as well as his prayers; for (quoth
he) as I know one is medicinable for the soul, I am sure the other's physic
for ye body. It was this Fuddle caps chance with 3 or 4 as good Malt-wormes as
himself, and as sure, where the best lap was to be found, together as 4 Knaves
in a pair of cards, to be drinking, where this Witch came in, and stood
gloting upon them. Now this Good Fellow (not enduring to look upon a bad face,
but his own, especially when he is Cup-shot) called aloude to her, Do you
hear Witch, look the other ways, I cannot abide a nose of that fashion, or else
turn your face ye wrong side outward, it may look like raw flesh for flies to
blow maggots in. Still as the Witch was ready to reply, he would cross her
with one scuruy Jest, and between every Jest drink to her, yet swear, God dam
him, she should starve ere she should have a drop on it, since the pot was sweet
he would keep it so, for should but her lips once look into the lid on it, her
breath's so strong, and would so stick in the cup, that all the water yt runs by
Ware would not wash it out again. At last the witch got so much time to call to
him, Do thou hear good friend (quoth she?) What say thou ill face (quoth
he?) Mary I say (quoth she) that thou throwst in thy drink apace, but shall not
find it so easy coming out. Nay, as for the coming out (answered the fellow)
I throwd it in above, and it shall come out beneath, and then thou shall have
some of it, if thou will, because I am in hope it will poison thee. Then with
this greeting away goes the Witch in a chafe, and the fellow sits down to
follow his drink, but as the end of all drunkards, is either to ming or to
sleep. So out goes this fellow, and drawing his Gentleman Usher against a pale
side, finds me a top of his nose a red lump as big as a cherry, and in his
belly felt such a rumbling, as if the Tower of Babell had fallen about his
ears: oh the sight thereof drove his heart to an ague, and his tongue to an
alaru^* and out he cries, the Witch, the Witch, I am undone, I am undone: O
God, women of Royston, help, help, the Witch, the Wicth, I am a man spoyld,
help, I am undone. At that word help, the Which, in comes one of his fellows
runs in have, and asked him what they should help, the Witch? Oh (quoth he) to
the gallows, for I am undone by her. Well, yet out he runs, where for that
night she would not be found, but the next morning meeting her in a lane, his
pain rather increased, tha^ lesned, and there fasts his ten commandments upon
her, he almost scratcht out her eyes; nay, left her not till he brought her to
ye town, where for this and the rest, she was apprehended, and she and her
daughter, with George Dell and his Mother, worthily suffered death the 4 of
August.

FINIS.
