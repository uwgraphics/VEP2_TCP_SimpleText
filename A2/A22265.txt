A Proclamation concerning the adiournement of the Parliament.
WHereas by Our Proclamation given at Our Court at Royston the sixth day of
October last past, as well in respect of the season of the year and weather, as
for other considerations therein mentioned, we did publish Our Royal intention
and purpose to adiourne our said Parliament, from the foureteenth day of
November now approaching, unto the eight day of February next coming;
Nevertheless upon certain urgent and important occasions of great weight and
consequence, with the advice of Our Privy Council, We have thought fit and
necessary to alter Our former resolution in that behalf, and to adiourne the
said Parlianment, from the foureteenth to the twentieth day of this instant
November: And therefore We do hereby notify and publish the same to all the
Prelates, Noblemen, and States of this Our Realm, and also to the Knights,
Citizens and Burgesses of the same Parliament, So that they, or any of them,
other then such as shall happen to be in London or Westminster, (who may attend
the making of the said adiournement) shall not be bound or compelled to appear
the said foureteenth day of November, at Our City of Westminster, but shall be
thereof discharged against Us: Nevertheless, We do hereby will, charge, and
command all and every the said Prelates, Noblemen and States, and all the said
Knights, Citizen and Burgesses, and all others, to whom in this case it shall
appertain, That they and every of them do personally appear, and be present
the said twentieth day of November at the City of Westminster aforesaid, to
treat, consent, and conclude upon such matters, as in the said Parliament shall
then and there of the Common Council of the Realm by Gods favor happen to be
ordained, Our said former Proclamation, or any other thing to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the third day of November, in the nineteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
