understand what ships, marchaundizes, or goods belongyng to the subjects
of her good brother the king of Spain, are come to the hands of any of her
subjects: does most strayghtly charge and command all manner of persons her
highness subjects, that every of them unto whose hands any such goods,
marchaundizes, or ships are come, by virtue of the late arrest of such
goods, or otherwise, sense the xxix. of December, which was in the year of our
Lord God 1568. or a month or two before, fail not within xiiii. days after
the publication hereof, to make and bring unto the chief Officer of the next
corporate town, a true and perfect declaration under their hand, of all the
same goods, ships, or other things belongyng to the subjects of the said
king, upon pain of her Majesty's indignation, and such punishment as thereof
may ensue. And her Majesty charge the said chief Officers, to send the
same declarations forth with under their hands and seals, into the Court of
the Admiraltie in the city of London, to be from thence brought to her
Majesty, for further order to be taken therein, as shall be thought meet.

Majesty's reign.

God save the Queen.
