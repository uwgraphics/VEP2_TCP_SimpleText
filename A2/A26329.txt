To his very Worthy and much Respected Friend, Mr. JOHN EVANS, Captain of a
Company of Train'd-bands, under the Right Honorable The Earl of CRAVEN; EDWARD
ADAMS wishes long Health, and everlasting Felicity.
Sir,
ONe of the Duties that belongs unto a Christian, is Charity, and Friendship
is very near a kin unto her; and that proceeds from a good Nature. As the free
and generous Spring, that issues forth it self for the good and refreshment of
all Creatures; so good Nature is never wanting for to help and assist,
especially where it bears friendly Respects. I being sensible of your good
disposition, by reason that I have received from you many Favors; and knowing
your inclination unto the Art of War, am emboldened to dedicate this small Twig
or Branch of Martial Discipline unto your favorable and friendly Protection,
which will be unto it as Varnish is unto dull Painting, a means to make it
beautiful and splendant; and answer the request and desire of your obliged

E. A.

To the DILIGENT READER, AND INDUSTRIOUS PRACTITIONER.
AS it is said of the Sea, that though it branch it self into Gulphs, Creeks,
and other smaller partitions; yet those are not the main Ocean, but a part of
it: So this small Tract is not the Body of Martial Discipline, but a Limb or
part thereof. And as Seamen cannot comprehend the Sea at one or two Voyages,
neither can young Soldiers be Masters of the Military Art by one or two
Exercises: But both Seamen and Soldiers must practice with patience and
diligence, and in time they may attain much to their satisfaction. That you may
thus do, is the hearty desire of him that is willing to serve you to the best
of his power.

The YOUNG SOLDIER'S Desire ANSWERED.
A Leading with 16 Men, containing eight Pikemen and eight Musketeers, as
follows, Viz.

We will suppose that the men are completely armed, and also furnished with
Officers: that is, a Lieutenant, Ensign, and two Sergeants, and also with a
Drum or Drums.

Let the Sergeants draw up the men in this form first:

Observing that they make the best men File-leaders; the second best, Bringers
up; the third, half File-leaders; and the fourth, Bringers up of the Front half
Files: and likewise the best File-leaders place on the right, and the second
best on the left; and so the rest, giving unto them dignity according to their
worth, as well Pikes as Muskets.

The Body being drawn up, it is convenient to have the Colors conveyed to the
Body.

First,

Form the Body as follows.

Command.

Bringers up, double the Front inwards:

The Bringers up of the right half of the Body incline to the Left; and the
Bringers up of the left half of the Body incline to the Right, and pass through
the Interval up into the Front: and the lest of the half Files gratually after
the other, while they have evened the Front and the Body.
And they will be in this form, as follows.



The eldest Sergeant he commands the two inmost Files of Pikes to advance their
Pikes, and he advances his Halberd, and with the Drum or Drums Troops to the
place where the Ensign and the Colors are, as thus: In the mean time the
other Sergeant he closes the Body.


The Colors being furled up, the Ensign he advances them, and commands the
Pikes to open outward, and passes through in the Interval, the Drum in the
rear of him, and commands the Pikes to wheel inwards after him, and so troops
to the Body; the Sergeant brings up the Rear, as thus:

Whilst the Ensign is trooping to the Body, the Sergeant that is with the Body
he commands them to open from the middle to double Distance, to make an
Interval for the Pikes to march into their places.

When the Ensign is come up, he commands the Pikes to wheel outward and march
into their places.

Then the Company will be completed both with Officers and Soldiers, as
follows.

C for Captain. L for Lieutenant. E for Ensign. S for Sergeant. D for Drum. P
for Pike. M for Musket.



Next, reduce them as they were at first; then proceed to Exercise.

Command.

Every even File from both Flanks, double the depth of the odd. Every even
File from both Flanks, face about. That is, those that are faced, the first man
marches into his place, and so the rest successively.




I do use the word Stand in the Exercise very often; for it is very convenient:
For you are not to stand until you perform the Word of Command. And when you
are commanded to perform any thing, either in Distances, or Facings, Doublings,
Countermarches, or in Wheelings, and have performed that, and are commanded to
stand, then you are to stand, and not before. That is, to 3 foot distance
between File and and File.


Files, open from the right to Order.

Stand.

Files, open from the right to open Order. That is, 6 foot distance from File
and File.


That is, to 12 foot distance between File and File.
Stand.

Files, open from the middle to double distance.

Stand.

Ranks, open forward to Order.

Stand.

So you may command both Ranks and Files to Open to Double double Distances,
the which is 24 foot.
Ranks, open backwards to open Order.

Stand.

Ranks, open from the middle to double Distance.

Stand

To reduce the Body.
Files, close to the middle to Order.

Stand.

Ranks, close to the middle to Order.

That is, a Foot and a half between File and File, and Rank and Rank.
Stand.

Both Ranks and Files, close to the middle to your close Order.

Stand.

Face all to the right.

Note, in all Facings eito the right or to the left, to command the Pike-men to

their Bodies with their Arms on their left Heel only.

as there is occasion; and that is called Depth-ways.

The Captain may, if he pleases, before he marches, command the Pikes to
advance their Pikes, and the Musketeers to poise their Muskets, and shoulder
all; and each Officer say to his Division, This Division, march. Having marched
sufficiently, draw them up into a Body again.

When the Captain finds it convenient to have the Company drawn up, he makes a
stand, and commands the Drummer to beat a Troop; and at the same time the
Captain advances his Leadingstaff, or half Pike, as a sign to the Officers for
to draw up their Divisions.

The successive Officer is to draw up his Division on the left of the precedent
Division, either by marching or trooping.
