A CLEAR VOICE OF TRUTH Sounded forth, And as an Ensign lifted up and
displayed, in answer to the proceedings of the Christians by name in Asia, by
way of Controversy and Expostulation; together with Savoury and Wholesome
Admonishments, which may become of good use and profitable to all that read
with a single eye, and understand with an upright heart.

Also the same somewhat tends by way of gentle reproof to their hasty and
unequitable proceedings against the Innocent Servants, Messengers and living
Witnesses of the Living and True God.

Yet with the tenderness of an upright Heart and Spirit (not only of a free
born Englishman, but also of a True Christian) from the same hand its
principally directed to the Lord Ambassador (so called) in Constantinople, and
to the English Company of Merchants and Factors in Smyrna, with somewhat to the
Merchants in Genoa, tendered again by way of Visitation, and that from God, for
them and others in Italy, to consider and not reject to their own hurt.

Blessed are they which are persecuted for Righteousness sake, for theirs is
the Kingd^m of Heaven, Mat. 5.10. Printed in the year, 1662.

AN EPISTLE TO THE READER.
THere is certainly a very Precious, Noble, Royal, Long-Suffering Seed of the
Eternal God of Heaven and Earth, the which in these latter days of our age
since the long night of Apostasy [from Christ and his Holy Apostles and Saints
life] to which the Eternal Arm of the Lord God is manifestly revealed unto
eternal Salvation and perfect Redemption, in and by the Light of the Lord Jesus
(the Immanuel) who as truly lights every man, as he tasted Death for every
man that comes into the World, and this precious Seed which is the Light that
is sown for the Righteous, And the People become perfectly Righteous that
believe in and obey the same light of Jesus, and are thereby made partakers of
the Righteousness, and so of the same nature of God, which comes to be revealed
from faith to says in Male and Female, for which end the light which is the
Seed is sown in the heart, is the Light shines in darkness which comprehends
not that which is the treasure in the earthen Vessel as a pearl hid in a field,
and is the good thing which can give the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 4.2. Pet. 2.19. Romans 1.19. 1 Cor. 6.2 Cor. 11.
the same has been visited from on high as a thing hid in obscurity in many,
under the Region and Shadow of Death and Destruction, so that it has been
quickened and revived mightily to the amazement and astonishment of Kindreds,
Nations, Tongues and peoples because of the arm of the Lords Salvation, with
which he has arisen in his Majesty and shaken terribly the Earth and Heavens
also, and made the Keepers of the strong Man's House to tremble, and by his
power of holiness to bind him and spoil his goods; So that the everlasting
Light has sent his Word (of Power) into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Poor
distressed Israel, in whose house he, the Lord God (that Spirit) has promised
to dwell in the midst for ever, as in the Ancient days, and many of the
Eternal Offspring of Life which is the Light of men, having gladly received
the Word of Life, not from man nor by man that shall dye, but from his mouth,
that was dead and is alive, and behold he lives for evermore, that leads his
Flock like a good Shepherd to Living Springs and Fountains, which are as wells
springing up into everlasting Life, in them that believe, as the Scripture has
said, John 4. John. 7.38.30.

And these as Lambs among Wolves, having the blessed Life and Salvation to
Proclaim in Faithfulness, traveling in their innocent integrity on this wise,
as our Brethren the Prophets and Fathers of old did from one Nation to another
People; Now why are the Nations angry? and why do the Mighty and Potentates of
the Earth combine and take Counsel together against the Lord and his Anointed?
Is it not because the Eternal God is provoking them to jealousy and to anger
with a foolish Nation, with them which are deemed not a People, who are Poor,
Afflicted, Despised, Destressed on every hand, yet not forsaken of the Lord
their Rock, their Strength, Deuteronomy. 32.

Now it came to pass that after the Lord God [who forms the Mountains and
Creates the Wind which obeys him,] Amos. 4. last. had given three more of my
Brethren together with me a good passage from the Land of our Nativity to
Italy, namely, to Legorne, where two of us, (to wit) John Stubs and Henry Fell,
was ordered of the Lord to pass from thence toward Alexandria and they became
obedient; and it came to pass also by the permission of God who suffered the
men of our own Nation to Banish and expel them away from that Region and Coast,
where they gave a sound of the Mighty Day of Gods visitation, and says Christ,
as they have done unto me, so will they do unto you, etc. The Gadarenes loved
their Swine and besought Christ to depart out of their Coast, and them that
Rebel against the Light, says, depart from us (even to the most High) for we
desire not the knowledge of thy ways, Job. 21. Job. 24. 13, 14.

And furthermore my Dear Brother Richard Scostrope my Companion in Tribulation
and in the Power of God, by which we were also ordered (having no imposition
from any mortal man on our Consciences God is witness) was ordained of God to
pass Eastward, toward Asia, namely, to Smyrna, intending also to travel
further (if the Lord suffered not Satan to hinder;) and behold when we came
there, having enjoyed the benefit of a good passage, that the Merchants and
Great men and others of our own Nation did not a little perplex and burden
themselves not only at our bodily presence, but also with our faithful and true
innocent and harmless message of life, and glad tidings of Salvation to the
Nations, and verily they cannot deny but that our behavior and deportment (if
they speak truth) was such as we professed in Words and Doctrine in all good
Conversation whilst we abode among them, as examples in the manifold
Dispensations of the grace of God Almighty, to whom be the Glory over all, Amen.

We being at our first coming sent for before the Consul of the Nation, gave
him a good and sober information of the intent of our hearts as God had ordered
and determined in some measure (to try them) and he said that he must give
account to the Lord Ambassador and send tidings to Constantinople to him, and
he could not suffer us to pass further till he had received information in
answer, etc. Now we saw not of our departure from Smyrna imediately, and seeing
that they did intend to write, many of them being evil affected with prejudice
and such like surmisings against us that loved them, and traveled in the love
and Spirit of Gods Truth for their eternal good freely, albeit they hated us
without cause as it befell our Lord and Master; I also was moved in the fear of
the Lord to write and give the Ambassador an honest and true information of
the intent of our hearts, to the end he might be honestly warned of receiving
any evil and false intelligence that he may not consent with the same, nor with
the ground of it to join or stretch forth his hand therewith against the Lord,
his Truth and innocent People.

THE Copy of the Letter is seen meet to be inserted here following, seeing the
same was made leight of, and rejected as a thing of naught, as many have done
to their own hurt and condemnation, namely, O. C. and the many Parliaments in
their days past, in which the Eternal God tried them (what if I say to the
uttermost) before he smote, and broke and shattered them to pieces as Potters
Vessels, and wherled them up and down as Clouds of Tempests and Darkness, as
it were from one end of the Land to the other in his sore displeasure (in the
sight of the Nations, to the final destruction of many of them that turned the
back; Albeit they seemed to have their face toward the good Day of their
Visitation from on High, which they woefully sinned away, and the just
recompense of reward as a fruit of their own doings, even in the sight of the
Nations, fell upon them as a weight too heavy for them to bear, and as great
judgments from the same Hand of God is reserved in store, and is ready to be
revealed and executed upon the Heads of them that walk in the same ways and
paths of unrighteousness, which provokes the Lord to his Face, I speak not on
this wise to (upbraid without the Fear of the Lord) the generation that's passed
away, and seems to be laid in the dust of the Earth, but rather that the
present generation of men, of what Name or Denomination they were, are or may
be under, that have but somewhat of the Fear and Zeal of the God of Truth in
their Hearts, thereby to be warned in their day, and not to make the evil
example of any to be so to them, as evil to follow it, nay but contrariwise,
which is so far acceptable to God, for Sodom and Gomorah and the old World,
were and are evident examples of the sore displeasure of the Eternal God of
vengeance, to whom it peculiarly and properly belongs, and he will certainly
repay Fury to his Adversaries, and Recompense to his Enemies, when he awakes
and stirs up his strength as a MIGHTY ONE (the KING, the Lord of Hosts is his
Name) to bend his Bow, and whet his glittering Sword, he will cast up, cut down
and overturn, and not spare to spend his Arrows of famine and destruction, and
let them fly with his outstretched Arm of strength, to smite and strike into
the Hearts of the double-minded, so that his anger shall smoke in the fiery
Zeal of his Eternal Majesty against such a one, that being often reproved,
goes on still in his iniquities, he shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
without remedy, as says one in a certain place, Prove. 29. yet the Nations of
men may certainly understand that the most High holds forth his Eternal Name,
as he is the Lord God, long suffering and of great goodness, neither delights
he in the destruction of any, but rather in their return unto the Wisdom of the
Just, unto Eternal Life in it to live for ever, and not to die in their sins,
for as he is the Light of Israel, and his Holy One for a flame, and a consuming
fire to burn up Briars and Thorns against the workers of Iniquity, so is he a
God of Judgment, and blessed are all they that wait for his Salvation, and put
their trust in him, he will show them his Covenant, and establish them in the
same, in which they shall not be confounded, neither be ashamed, nor yet shall
any make them afraid, but quietness and assurance for ever shall be their
reward in Eternal Peace and Blessedness, together with him and the Spirits of
Just men made perfect, on this wise my Soul in life breaths and travels for
the Restoration of all things, into the Glorious Liberty and Freedom of the
harmless Sons of God.

Verily, the Eternal love of my God that's shed abroad within my heart, its much
enlarged to stream forth Universally, even to the whole Creation that travels
in pain under the Bondage of Corruption, over which mine eyes have poured forth
many tears, and in the brokennesse of my very heart have I dolefully Lamented
and Mourned for the same, but at present, I am necessitated to proceed on to
what is before mine eye, as I have began concerning this little Treatise.

The Copy of the Letter.
FRIEND,
THy Everlasting Honor and Wel-being with the Lord and with the Spirits of
just men our soul wishes right well, so peace be unto thee.

This is that thou may [according to the Just, Noble Principle of God in thee]
have a right understanding of somewhat of the Truth, Innocence and Vprightness
of our hearts, who are the Servants of the One True and Living God and Father
of all Truth, and called by his grace of life, which in our hearts we have
received gladly, to Declare to the Nations, even the same grace that has
brought Salvation to us, the same also that appears unto all men without
respect of persons that they may be saved from the wrath to come, by which
grace of life (I say) we are called to peace and good will to all men (as our
Fathers were) in the same to forsake the Pollutions of the World and our Native
Country, Kindred and Fathers House to do and suffer the will of God, and keep
his Commandments which are not grievous to us in the life of our Obedience to
his Blessed Will, who called and sent us into these parts whether the Sons of
men believe us or not, or hear or forbear; And seeing the God of our Life has
blessed and prospered us hitherto in our journey, we have the Living Testimony
of the Spirit of Life witnessing to the same in our Consciences, and to the
Truth of what is here written unto thee.

And forasmuch as we understand from the Consul here that we shall not by him
be admitted to pass further without thy advice or consent, therefore have we
freedom, and in the fear of the Lord seen meet to let thee know somewhat from
our hands, as to the present service of our God, whose Power, Favor and life
in his Covenant of Eternal Light and Peace we possess Glory to his Name, for
which our lives are not dear unto us, which are (also) in our hands to serve
the Lord his Truth and People, and to the end thou may not, in any wise be as
an Instrument to stop or let the work of God from going on, by the hand of his
Messengers and Ambassadors of peace, Wherefore in the fear and tender love of
the God of Heaven is this to be laid before thee (to warn thee) as thou art in
thy place of Authority (which we own, esteem and honor in the Lord, one of us
(being two) having a message from the Lord of Heaven to the Prince (or
Emperor) of the Turks, and well will it be with the men of our own Nation if
they be not found setting themselves against the service of God, his Truth and
People whom he alone will make a blessing to Nations, that shall surely prosper
without Bow, or Sword, or visible Weapons of war, the Lord has spoken it, and
the Prophecy shall as surely be fulfilled in its time or season.

So the Lord give thee wisdom and a Noble understanding according to his
determinate Counsel therewith to honor him in thy place of Judicature; and so
my Spirit says, Amen.

Smyrna, the sixth month of the Year, 1661. I am thy Friend, and so to the
whole Creation of God, Daniel Baker. Richard Scostrope.


NOw it was so that after this was sent, we notwithstanding sought daily for
passage convenient to Constantinople, and at last it presented by way of a
Dutch Ship, and we spoke to the Commander for the same end on board the said
Vessel, but before She sailed away, a Warrant was forthwith given out and sent
from the Kings Ambassador to Smyrna, which men of high degree gladly received
and prosecuted the same against us, to expel us from their Coasts, and
separate us from their company, all be it we were not in any wise chargable
unto them, neither did eat any man's bread for naught.

A Copy of the Warrant which came from the hand of the Kings Ambassador, and
prosecuted by the English Nation in Smyrna in Asia against two servants and
witnesses for God and his Truth and People called Quakers.
WHereas we are informed that there is lately arrived with the Zant Frigot, one
Daniel Baker with his companion, commonly called by the name of Quakers, with
intention to come up to this Port; And because we have had experience that the
carriage of that sort of people is ridiculous and is capable to bring dishonor
to our Nation, besides other inconveniences that may redound to them in
particular, and to the English Nation in general.

We therefore will and require you to give a stop to the said Quakers from
proceeding any further in their journey, either to Constantinople or the
present Court of the Grand Signior or to any other place where our Authority
extends, Shipping them away either directly for England or any other parts
where they shall choose to Imbarque. And we do herely require all Officers and
Members of the Factory, and Masters and Officers of Ships to be ayding and
Assisting to you herein, and for so doing this shall be your Warrent.

Winchelse.
Given under our Hand and Seal at our Court at Pera at Constantinople the 19.
day of July 1661.
For our Loving Friend Anthony Isacson Esquire, Consul for the English Nation
in Smyrna by his Excellencies Command, Paul Kecaut Secretary.
And they sent a Turks Jannesary together with a Drugger-man the Consuls
Officer and Hamalls (Porters) to our lodging, and sent us away as Prisoners.

To the Lord Ambassador (so called) and to the English Nation in
Constantinople and Smyrna.
Friend,
I am honestly persuaded, viz. If that the Nobility of thy understanding were
not veiled or darkened with prejudice, so that thou had a perfect
understanding of what thou have done, and if it were to do again it would be a
hard thing for thee then to do the same, wherefore blame me not, if I tell thee
in truth and plainness, saying, Behold how thou have turned thy hand against
the just Lord, and set thy self also against his Work, his Truth and People,
and the mighty, everlasting, terrible God that lives for ever, (in whose hand
thy breath is) he will certainly plead with thee for the same, [yea and with
them also who with one consent have joynd together with thee herein,] who are
but a man that shall die and come to judgment, as its appointed for all men,
and lo God has given thee a day of visitation, of Salvation, but behold how
thou have put the same far away from thee; and he that lives for ever, so far
has tried thee (together with the English Nation in Asia) in thy place, of of
Authority and Judicature, in giving thee also a plain and certain warning, by
my hand through me. [concerning somewhat of the work and counsel of the
Everlasting Light, who is the Living and true God, and Father of all Truth over
all blessed for ever Amen] before thou did intermeddle or proceed either to
the right hand or to the left, to the end that thou might take heed, and beware
of being instrumental in stopping the work and service of the Everlasting; And
lo thou have rejected and made light of the same (as does appear) and turned
thy hand against the Just, the Harmless and Innocent and guiltless, and also
reproached the Living God, inasmuch as the same is done to his Friends and
Messengers that have drawn so near thee, in peace, good will and uprightness of
heart, and in love unfeigned without selfends but with its denial [according to
the commandment of our Lord and Master, even Christ The light of the World
(which lights every man that comes into the World) in the work and service
of him, who is the Lord God of Judgment, with our precious life also in our
hand have we thus come, not loving our lives to the death for his Names sake,
for his Peoples sake, for his Gospels sake, who freely laid down his precious
life for us, (leaving us an example) who came not in our own name, will or
time, but have herein forsaken Country, Kindred and Fathers House, Wife and
Children and what else [our God that lives for ever knows rightwell] as our
Fathers of old did, God knows the uprightness of our hearts also, concerning
this and much more, which for the Truths sake might be declared, but at this
time it is not convenient, and our message (which from man we received not) of
life and salvation, was and is, to give a certain sound of the great and mighty
day of the Lord at hand, and also of the same life of the holy Prophets, and
Apostles of Christ the Lord of life that's arisen from the dead, with his saving
health in the midst of us, to the Nations that are involved in thick darkness,
and wallowing in obscurity to awaken them, and also that they may assuredly
know, that the mighty, terrible and glorious, and dreadful day of the eternal
God is come and at hand, and that the same has also begun to dawn and to
spread forth its shining beams of eternal brightness in the North parts of the
World, even in England first, the which is manifesting it self, and shining
forth over all Nations, to the condemnation and destruction of wickedness, and
also to the Justification and Salvation of the Righteous which of the Lord is
to turn the sons of men from ungodliness, now after this long night of
Apostasy, and also as it were to awaken the eternal Light of our Lord Jesus)
which is the witness of God in every conscience, (yea and to answer the same
(in all men) which is to guide Nations, the Sons and Daughters of men into all
truth, against which they have rebelled, and from the same they are fallen by
transgression; And behold the Lord God that lives for ever, as in the ancient
days is doing this and much more, and accomplishing his own work, not
according to man's way, will or time in these latter days, but as in the days
of old, is he provoking of Nations to jealousy to anger, and to wrath by those
which are not a people, he is provoking them to anger, and to wrath with a
foolish Nation, forasmuch as they have provoked him the everlasting Lord of
Heaven and Earth, to anger with their vanities, for says the Lord, a fire is
kindled in mine anger, and it shall burn unto the lowest hell, it shall consume
the Earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the Mountains.

Listen ye great Mountains, and inhabitants of the Earth, what will become of
you? where will you hide or sly when your foundations is set on fire? wherefore
give ear ye lofty trees, and strong oaks, the Lords controversy is with you,
for says he, A fire is kindled in mine anger, which will burn unto the lowest
Hell (mark that) I will heap mischiefs upon them, I will spend mine Arrows upon
them, they shall be burnt with hung^^, and destroyed with burning heat and
bitter destruction. And friend as sure as God has given thee breath, know,
that so sure are we his Servants and Messengers freely given up into his hand
to suffer his Will and Pleasure and to do the same in Earth, as it is in Heaven
(as thou thy self prayest, but it would be well if thy actions did not speak
the contrary as certainly they do concerning this matter.

And behold the time will certainly come to pass that the true witness of the
Everlasting Light in thy Conscience will answer to thy understanding, that we
are men of truth, fearing God, and sent of him (and not of or by man) whom thou
have so reproached and defied, together with many more; Alas poor man I pity
thee, and as for my part I am honestly persuaded, that King Charles, whom thou
calls Lord and Master, would not have given forth such a ridiculous, vile and
reproachful Sentence against the guiltless, an innocent harmless people, as
thou have done under thy hand and seal, peradventure in thy have (in a strange
Land) howso ever we pray the Lord, that the same may not be laid to thy charge
(when thou have most need of mercy, if happily repentance unto life thou may
witness, and albeit we may freely forgive thee by what we do or may suffer
because of thee, yet we know that the Lord will not hold you guiltless, after
so clear a warning (from his mouth that lives for ever) as you have had in
your day, that are guilty in the same thing, and God Almighty will be clear of
thee and so also will his Servant, if in your sins you dye; and therefore
behold I yet cease not to cry, Repent, Repent.

And seeing that the Everlasting Lord and King of Eternal Life, laid a
necessity on me more especially to preform this service (if Satan hindered not)
and to try thee also, and the English Nation together in Asia concerning the
same for your good, and not otherwise, but behold how you have joined together
with one consent to reject and defy the same message of life and salvation,
through letting up the dark spirit of prejudice and evil surmisings against the
Lord, the Innocent and guiltless, and thus (to your greater condemnation have
you been permitted by the everlasting God, so far to have your own hearts
desire, and to expel the Friends and Messengers of Christ out of your Coasts
or Borders, once and again, and not only so, but as much as in you concerns,
not to suffer them to come within the extent of your Authority, in the Turks
Dominion, in which you are as says the Warrant; but will you bear with me if I
question with you, saying, what are they contrary to all men? as a rebellious
Generation said to the holy Apostles, And what do they bear Testimony, not for,
but against the World, because the deeds thereof are evil, and can they not
neither receive the Honor and Glory of it, nor give the same to any man,
according to the complete example of their Lord and Master the life of man, the
true Christ, for which end Christ is come in the flesh, as he did many hundred
years since, who has by his grace of life manifest in us freely redeemed us
from the same vanities and pollutions which we witness (and testify against in
others.

And will you blame me if I say, what are not you of the same generation, as
Job saw rebel against the Light who know not the ways thereof, neither abide
in the paths thereof, Job. 24.13. and Job. 21. Alas poor men, are you the men
also that are without a good and noble understanding, and are wise to do evil,
and hate to be reformed, to discern between the precious and the vile; Alas for
you, yea woe and alas for you, what have ye done? cannot you smite upon your
thigh, and say on this wise, how shall we account with the Lord of life, of
eternity for these things and much more, when his mighty hand, and the weight
thereof you feel heavy upon your Consciences in the day that shall burn as an
Oven, according to the Prophecy of the Eternal Spirit by Mallachi, Mal. 3.

Behold and know ye, O ye great men of the Earth, ye high Mountains, Strong
Oaks and lofty Trees, this I with a clean mind declare unto you, if I be no
more, (viz.) that our Consciences are clear in the sight of God, that lives for
ever, who with a pure eternal eye, perfectly beholds the intents and
uprightness of our hearts (though hid from you) concerning this service, and
the living testimony of life answers in us to the same, and therefore have I
bouldness in the Truth to stand, and also to write on this wise; And again I
say, we are clear from the guilt which remains upon your Consciences. And
furthermore know ye that our service is so far accepted and we are also clear
of the same in and by Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master, who moved us hereunto,
and sent us freely to and among you in the Turks Borders and Dominion, the
which by your actions its manifest ye would have stand, but God Almighty has
otherwise determined, with a notwithstanding, and surely it would be well with
you could you witness and savor the answer of a good Conscience, the which in
the truth verily and certainly we do, in the sight of God concerning this our
service (whether you believe the same or not) its even so; And again I say we
are clear of your guilt and condemnation, before the Lord God of Judgment, the
Judge of all; and be it known unto you that he who sent us is true, whose
witnesses we are; Albeit some of you (as the same Generation in the days of
old, contemptuously and maliciously said to him, that he was mad and had a
devil and what else, yet we have in the Lord held fast our integrity in the
Truth, in Life and Conversation, to confess him before men, and bear his
reproaches in the fellowship of his Sufferings, following his harmless and
complete example, as the Sons of God in the midst of a crooked and perverse
Generation, unto which we are called, and are his living witnesses and testify
of his undefiled life manifest in us, and that he also is arisen from the dead
and lives for ever in the everlasting Light, the which is your condemnation
and not salvation (whatsoever you profess in words) whilst you are found
setting your selves against his appearance (now in this second coming a
quickening spirit [who is the Lord from Heaven] without sin unto salvation in
his Friends and Messengers) as who has drawn so near you, with his visitation
of Salvation in such clouds of witnesses, in and with his mighty pure power of
holiness, yet with them eyes (that are Adulterated from his undefiled life, and
truth) which cannot cease from sin (with which you see) therewith cannot you
behold him who is and is to be glorified in his Saints, and also admired in all
them that believe, who will certainly render vengeance (as says the Holy
Scripture) not only on them that know not God, but also on them that obey not
the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Light and Life of men who
tasted death for every man, and as certain he lights every man that comes
into the World, to the end that all men in him who is the Light might believe
and be saved (by the Light, who is the Author of Eternal Salvation) not only
from sin which works guilt and condemnation, but also from the wrath to come,
but woe will be to them that not only withstand his Appearance, his Truth and
People (who are not according, but contrary to the World, its Ways, Worships,
Honors and Glory, Traditions and Lusts, and herein neither enter your selves)
but also as much as in them is hinder others, who are as it were ready to
enter, from going in; but behold Publicant, Harlots are, and come to be
converted, and so to enter the Kingdom, whilst men of high degree themselves
are shut out; And will you bear with me if I ask you, saying, Have you been at
all careful, and not forgetful to entertain strangers? Or have you not wilfully
and despitefully shut the same out of your remembrance? And how have you obeyed
the perfect Doctrine of the Gospel of God? But what has not Christ in his
Friends, in his Lambs and Messengers, been as Strangers and Pilgrims? Yea has
not he been as a Prisoner and Captive, despised in and among you, but how at
all have you visited him, or entertained him, that bears the iniquity and
lives for ever? He right well knows, and in the day of God so shall you, and
it may be well if the same will appear to your justification; Poor men my heart
pitieth you, woe and alas for you, but the Scripture, not to your
justification do we witness fulfilled; And what if I say your unchristian-like
dealing against us, the same turns to us for a Testimony [albeit, we rejoice
not, as your reward will be evil unto your selves, but mourn over you] and if
this we did not witness in our integrity, sure of all men most miserable
should we be, and as he says, who is the Resurrection and the Life (viz) If
they have persecuted me, they also will persecute you; if they had kept my
sayings, they would keep yours also, but these things will they do unto you
(why) because they know not him that sent me, says Jesus, John 15. And have ye
not read these sayings, Now I tell you before it come to pass, that when it is
come to pass you might believe that I am he; Verily, verily, he that receives
whomsoever I send, receives me, and he that receives me, receives him that
sent me, John 13. But consider, have you received him, or do you know what is
the thing, or whom you have rejected and defied in what you have done to them
whom he has assuredly sent, whether you can believe the same or not; And do
you not know that he says on this wise, He that hears you, hears me, and
he that despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him
that sent me, Luke 10.16. And do you think it had not been better your hand had
been laid upon your month, and to have manifested silence in the fear of the
Lord, rather then to have proceeded so far as this to your own hurt? Woe and
alas for you, how can you truly say to the contrary in the Day of God? and is
it not your sins and your iniquities which keeps back good things from you? And
can you say that the words of our Living Testimony have been at any time
against any thing that's of the nature of God that's Equitable and Just? And
what, must all your strength and wisdom with what else you have, be stirred up
to keep up the strong holds of darkness, its Works and Fruits, even of the man
of sin, and Satan's Kingdom, is it not even so? Bear with me if I ask you, what
ye think of such that were to depart from the presence of the King of Eternal
life into everlasting fire, with the Devil and his Angels, who visited no^
Christ though sick and in prison, and when he was a stranger and naked took him
not in, neither clothed him, nor nourished him with either meat or drink, when
hungry and thirsty, cold and naked, but bowels of compassion was shut up, such
took him not in (nay there is no room for the Babe of Glory in the Inn, but a
Manger where the beasts feed over him, there the Virgins first born must lie)
Oh that any of you having ears to hear may hear; but what think you will be the
portion of such that not only dease not to do such things to him in his
Members, but also speak all manner of evil against him, and are not content
therewith, but he must be banished as a Rogue or Vagabond out of their Coasts
and Borders, whose carriage also must be as it is deemed and termed,
Ridiculous, and capable to bring dishonor to a Nation (because his Kingdom,
Honor and Glory is not of this World) as some one says, being possessed with
fear, even as they were, who said of him whom the Nations abhoreth, (viz.) If
we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come
and take away our Place and Nation; And so had they not respect to their
persons and places, and outward vain Honor and Glory of their Nation (which
was and is to be defaced and brought into contempt) more then to Christ the
Light, and saving Truth of all Nations, and true Honor thereof, and therefore
justly condemned, and there houses left desolate, as the Holy Scriptures
witnesses; but will you blame me, yet if I ask you saying, What will you
condemn a hard-hearted Generation, and justify your selves, whilst you are
walking in the steps, and doing the same things (like the Gaderenes and
unbelieving Jews in the days of Christ) put it not far from you, its even so
whether you hear or forbear, wherefore out of your Coasts and Borders and else
where the extent of your Authority or Dominion does reach or extend, must he
(the Lamb) be expelled or banished. Woe and alas for you, woe and alas for you,
that know not what you do, who shall bewail you, when no hiding place will be
found from his Eternal Light and Everlasting Wrath to hide? Behold whether you
hear or forbear how the Scriptures of Truth is fulfilled, not to your
justification, as says Christ our Lord and Master (viz.) in as much as ye did
it not (Concerning Receiving, Visiting, and Communicating) to one of the least
of these, ye did it not unto me, Mat. 23. and these shall go into Everlasting
punishment, but the Righteous into Life Eternal, whom you have wilfully
rejected and unjustly condemned, and think not that this is to justify our
selves, but the Grace of God which is our life and strength, which of a truth
we have gladly received, and its set up in our Hearts, otherwise at this day we
had not been (but Glory, Blessing and Salvation to the Lord our God over all,
Amen.)

And will you bear with me yet a little, if I proceed to query what is the
Crimes that are or tend to be so Rediculous, that's so capable to bring
dishonor to the Nation; Was not Nicodemus [a master in Israel] somewhat Noble,
when he would not have the Law to judge a man before it hear him? Does our Law
Judge a man before it hear him, says he, and says King AGRIPPA, I would hear
the man my self, and its well known what he was (a Heathen termed) who was so
Noble in such a Matter, as to hear the Accused as well as the Accusers.

And if thou O Ambassador (for King Charles of Great Britane in the Turks
Dominion) hadest manifested the Nobility of a good understanding, so Nobly in
the first place, before such a hasty sentence was given forth under thy Hand
and Seal, by thee, to have suffered us to come and appeared before thee, to the
end that thou might have enquired honestly into the Nature and Ground of the
Matter, as a man of God in the place of Judicature, and so according as thou
had found us either Clear or Guilty of unjust Crimes (which indeed are
Ridiculous, and tends to the Dishonor and Destructiveness of a Kingdom or
Nation,) and then to have clered thy Conscience, in laying the Sword in its due
place, as a terror to evil doers, and not upon the head of the Innocent and
Guiltless, to whom he that bears the Sword of the Righteousness as a Minister
of God, should be a praise, and our Bodies would also have been ready either to
do or suffer accordingly; but behold, herein thou also have been wanting, and
the Guiltless Cause thou have not pleaded, but contrariwise condemned the same;
and hereby they have suffered the more, but the reproaches of Christ they
esteem as great Riches, though accounted they be even as the vilest off
scouring of all things; yet what is their Ridiculous Crimes, what is it because
they are scornfully called Quakers, or because they are the Elect of God,
Redeemed from a vain Conversation, and conform not to the Vanities, Traditions,
Lusts and Customs of the World, which are not of the Father of all Truth? or is
it because all men speak not well but evil of them, and separate them from
their Company, as Christ Prophesied should befall them? Luke 6.22. Mat. 10.22.
or is it because they cannot Swear at all, neither Lie nor Dissemble, but speak
the truth from the heart to every man in plainness, without respect of
Persons, Nations or Places? or is it because for Conscience sake (and not in
any evil surmising, or contempt to any man's person) they honestly wear their
Hats, as the rest of their plain and useful Garments, and cannot receive,
neither give the honor that's beneath the Son with flattering Titles, either to
themselves or to any man, which is not contrary, but according to the Perfect
and Complete Example of Christ their Lord and Master, and Captain of Salvation,
who receives not honor from man, and says, How can you believe, which receive
honor one of another, Mat. 5:

But I demand as a Christian, in truth and indeed, as a free born English man,
yet further, what is the evil (these that are so contrary to the World, its
Friendship Honor and Glory) that they have at all done? Or what are they
guilty of, that they are deemed so Ridiculous; and so capable to bring
Dishonor to a Nation? (who shall become a blessing to all Nations, with a
notwithstanding this and that which lets, that's to be taken out of the way)
What must people believe Accusations to be true, without instancing or making
the Cause manifest to their understandings, because its the pleasure of men of
high degree, to say they are so, and so, is this sufficient to stand before the
God of Judgment, and good men of understanding? who have they been chargeable
unto, or who have they defrauded? or have they eaten any man's bread for naught?
or wherein is their carriage Ridiculous? or what is any manner of their Crimes,
or Behavior, or Deportment, otherwise then Peace and Love that works no ill
to its neighbor, but good will to all men, in Truth and Uprightness,
Temperence and Sobriety, in Life and Conversation? (but what is the matter with
the Sons of men, that they so burden themselves with the Sons of Truth, and
blameless Servants of the Living God, who do all things well in the Light,
through Christ the light that strengthens them) let the Lords Witness, the
light in your Consciences arise to answer, either to your Justification or
Condemnation. O ye men of England in Asia, can you justly charge any evil
against them, let the same come forth and be manifest to the whole World, if
Equity and Truth be on your side, but if the savory Fruits of the Life of
Eternal Righteousness, in sound Doctrine, with wholesome Communications that
corrupts not good manners, with long-suffering, meekness and gentleness of
Christ brought forth by them who shine as lights in the world (being redeemed
from the vanities and evils thereof) if these be the fruits and manners, or
things ye call evil, surely in so doing the same tends not to your
justification; and are these the Ridiculous Crimes that will bring dishonor to
a Nation, what will equity, truth and uprightness, and plainness of a heart,
temperance, innocence and sobriety, with savoury and wholesome Communications,
without guile, fraud or deceit in life and good conversation doing the will of
God from the heart in his fear and reverence, and (...) these the things that
are deemed so Ridiculous and capable to bring Dishonor to the Nation, to the
King or his just Government, or is it not the contrary, even the hurtful lusts
which men fulfill and walk after, from whence wars and fightings arises,
together with evil Surmisings, Strife, and Debate, and Violence, and Spoil,
with flatterings and guile arises, double-mindedness, revealings pride of life
and hypocrisy, al arising from one and the same ground of iniquity in the Sons
of men, from whence also comes so much Wasting, Devouring and consuming the
good Blessings and Creatures of God upon the ungodliness and hurtful lusts,
that wars against the Precious and Immortal Soul, and are not only hurtful and
destructive to a man, to his Body, Soul, Mind and Spirit, but also to the
greeving, and provoking, and wounding of the Just, Eternal Lord God of Heaven
and Earth, and so becomes destructive also to a Family, to a City, to a Kingdom
and Nation.

And what are not these and such like, the noysom and unsavory Fruits (which
is a shame to Christianity and utterly contrary to the most Wise, Gentle,
Temperate Life of the Lord Jesus and his Saints upon Earth) so frequently by
the Apostate Christians, and Christians by name only, brought forth day by day,
among the Turks, who excel many of them in uprightness, steadfastness and
temperance in things civil, and in matters of communications and dealing
between man and man, to your condemnation, who are guilty and so below them
herein, so that an ill savor has ascended up to the Lord, from the
unwholesome conversation of the Christians by name and words out of the true
Christians savoury, meek, gentle, long-suffering life, bringing forth contrary
and unsavory fruits, and what are not these the things that is Ridiculous, and
also capable to bring dishonor to a Nation, to God, the King and to their own
bodies and souls oppression [men of clear understanding will not reject but
consent and adhere to my Testimony] by reason of such dishonorable fruits
abounding in a strange Land, among the Nations of men, and thereby give
occasion to them called Turks, Heathens, Jews and Infidels, and what others
among you, not to win them to the most holy Faith of Gods elect, but
contrariwise to abide in their brutishness, hardness of heart and infidelity,
and unbelief, and not only so, but also to blaspheme and dishonor the Lord God
of Eternal Life and his Worthy Name, by which ye are called, and also to reject
and defy both you and your Religion, and Christianity in the general.

Oh how often my very heart has been grieved and my soul oppressed and wounded
in me many a time, from time to time, yea over the men of my own Nation have I
wept, and mourned, [whilst they have magnified themselves in the pleasures of
unrighteousness, against their own souls, and the people of the Lord of hosts,]
my God knows because of these things: And oh our Souls has been wounded,
grieved and vexed from time to time, and pressed down in us day by day even as
truly as the soul of righteous Lot was in Sodom, because of the unsavory and
unfruitful words and works of darkness, brought forth by the Apostate
Christians of all sorts, among the Turks; Oh the pride of life, Oh the
vanities, Oh the excess and superfluites of noughtiness abounding together with
flattery, deceit and double-mindedness that abounds and superabounds, among and
over the false Christians, which keeps back the Heavenly distillings of the
early and latter rain from on high, that the same desends not to reach to the
lower parts of the Earth, where the poor prisoners of hope and exiled captives
are shut up, but have any of you an ear to hear, or eyes to see what is the
matter that hinders, Stops the blessings of eternity, by resisting that which
is holy (which checks and reproves for sin, evil and vanity) in your selves and
others, the same good thing is freely given of God, to guide you and all men
into all truth, and from the contrary in which the false Christians excels the
Turks, even in unrighteousness, and I am as it were constrained to write on
this wise, to their shame, yet in love if happily the same may tend to their
Salvation, from the contrary, effect and ground of oppression with its fruits,
so that they hereby have provoked the Eternal God of mercy and judgment not a
little, and have caused his anger to wax hot, and to burn like a consuming fire
against the root and ground of iniquity reigning in and over the Sons and
Daughters of men, and his wrath and sore displeasure from Heaven, in the
eternal Light is revealed against the same, together with the vessels of wrath
fitted for destruction, and many of you may feel the same, not to your
justification or salvation, who have been such an ill savor to the Lord, and
his Friends, and crucify his meek, sweet and temperate life even of the Lamb,
the Light our Lord Jesus Christ, day by day, as if every day were a day of
slaughter, so that the noisome corrupt fruits which are not meet for
repentance, are a noy some smell even among the Turks as I have truly said, and
many of you will find it so in one day, notwithstanding God eternal time after
time has not been wanting with visitations in visiting you both with judgemens
and mercies, yet may it not be said for all this, will they not learn
righteousness, but rather wax worse and worse, and are ready to say, who shall
reprove or be Lord over us, and to the most high as them that rebel against the
Light did, saying, depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways
but to take pleasure, not in the Truth but in unrighteousnes, whose reward must
be according to the unfruitful works of darkness, and God Almighty may yet
plead with you concerning these things, and happily to try you, yet more
Messengers of Righteousness may he send to visit you [together with the Jews,
Turks and Heathens] that if happily your end may be peace and not otherwise,
which we chiefly seek and travel in love and good will for the same (whether
you will hear or forbear) either to your eternal salvation or condemnation.

But will you not count me your Enemy and despise me, If I in the truth tell
you the truth, saying, misery and destruction, oppression with
hard-heartednesse is yet in your ways, take heed and beware least the same
arise up so high, and at last overcome you to eternal perdition, and if I
should testify, saying, This is a certain warning from the hand of God that
lives for ever: I right well know you can hardly believe the words of my
Living testimony, but I perfectly know from what Spirit and ground they are
brought forth, and I am well satisfied in the life that now is, and was, and
shall for ever be one and the same which is Unchangable, Immortal, Invisible,
Eternal, without variableness or shadow of turning in the least degree into any
contrariaty from its own pure nature or property, and clear substance of its
undefiled nature of true Light and Life, which never fades away, in which I
rest, and in the same my living soul magnifieth the living invisible God of
immortality and eternal life, to whom be living endless praises, with eternal
Dominion over all this and that which lets (which is to be taken out of the
way) now and for ever as in the beginning over all, Amen.

And for so much as you have so far made light of the appearance of the good
day of your visitation of salvation, now the day light of the morning is begun
to dawn over the Nations (the dark night of Apostasy, since the Holy Apostles
days being so far spent) the clouds of obscurity and unfruitful works of the
night of darkn^ss being made manifest by the Light of Eternity, and brought to
the same for judgment and condemnation, but behold how you have been found
Defying, Rejecting, Abhorring and Persecuting the Prophets, and Messengers, and
People of the true and living God, who sent us not in our own name, will or
time, to prove you and to warn you, and to preach repentance, and reformation,
and reconciliation to God among you in Asia, as in other parts of the World,
not in your own way or wisdom that is not from above but from beneath, of the
World, who have been permitted so far as to stop us in the work of our God to
your own hurt, and what if I should say on this wise, Let the Lord require the
same at your hands and of that Generation, that is under the line of
unrighteousness, that runs parallel through the unbelieving, wrathful,
persecuting nature, even from Cain unto this present day, who are uncircumcized
in heart and ears, and stifnecked, always resisting the holy Ghost as did your
Fathers, as the holy man who was filled with the Holy Ghost, says Acts 7. But
I have prayed that what you have done, may not be laid to your Charge, who know
not what you do, ye know I speak truth, and the Light of Christ in you will
answer me, in the day of God, whether yet you hear or forbear, I am and shall
be clear, albeit as much as in you is ye have endeavored to stop and hinder
the work of the everlasting God, and his glorious truth from spreading, yet the
Truth (the Light that is eternal) the same which lighteeth every man that
comes into the World, I say with a notwithstanding, shall it break forth and
shine perfectly bright, and spread its same, glory, and eternal excellency,
through and over all Nations, and prosper according to the most wise Decree,
and eternal Counsel of the everlasting Lord the Light and King of eternal life,
and the same shall awaken and answer the eternal witness that is just in every
Conscience, whether Turks, Jews, Christians or Heathens, under what name or
denomination soever they be called: And behold this my spirit prophecieth
(viz.) that with them eyes you now may see with shall you never behold the
same, neither the Goodness, Riches, Blessings and Mercies which the everlasting
Light has in store to dispense among and over the Nations of men that come to
fear him and his goodness, and also turn from ungodliness.

And behold furthermore I declare that your evil intents and works of
darkness, what if I say the same shall work together for our good unto eternal
life and peace, and so turn to us for a testimony, as it does not to your
justification, but contrariwise, yet our prayer is for you that hate us without
a cause, but the time may come, and it hasteneth, that you may wish you had
never been born to have seen this Age and Generation, whilst we cry woe and alas
for you, in the day in which the burthensom stone though little (as cut out of
the Mountain without hands) it is known and the Nations that burden themselves
with it shall be cut in pieces, and grownd to powder on whom it falls (whose
light is like unto a stone most precious clear as Crystal) according to the
prophecy of the eternal Spirit of holiness, and verily the mercy and goodness
and knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the same shall
fill the Earth and abundantly stream forth, and spread its virtue and excellent
power over all Nations, and flow plentifully even to the ends and uttermost
parts of the Earth from Sea to Sea and to the utmost extent or circumference of
its bounds; the Lord, the Lord of eternity in his own life, and by the
Almightinesse of his own Arm that's revealed and manifest in the midst of his
poor afflicted and despised, yet honorable people, against whom you have
magnified your selves to your own hurt, in and by whom, without visible weapons
of war, will he even our Lord perform the same and much more, and many both on
the right hand and on the left shall break forth as a mighty flood, or as the
Stars of the Firmament of the power of the everlasting Light, and many shall
fear and tremble, because of the abundance of peace and truth, that is, and is
yet to be revealed even in them that turn from ungodliness to the Light of the
Lord who enlighteneth the poor, and deceitful man's eyes, the Lord enlightneth
both their eyes says the wise man, and the poor man is guided in obedience to
the same light which justifies him, and condemns the deceitful man that
hates it, Prove. 29. so he that does evil hates the Light which is not
Salvation but Condemnation to the evil doer, as Christ says, John the 3d. And
blessed shall the man be that believes in, and obeys the Light of the Lord
manifest in him, to guide him into all Truth from all the contrary, and the
Nations shall be asnamed and confounded because of all the goodness that the
eternal God of Judgment will perform unto, and in the blessed and beloved
obedient Seed of his bowels, that's to be gathered from the four winds and ends
of the Earth where they have been (in the dark night of Apostasy) scattered.

Wherefore with my single voice behold I cry unto you, yet by the same Eternal
Spirit of Life and Prophecy, take heed and beware least that therefore come
upon you, which is spoken of in the Prophets, saying, Behold ye dispisers and
Wonder, and Perish, the Lord is working a work in your days, which you will in
no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you; and whether you hear or
forbear, the Scripture do I witness fulfilled in me, in the answer of a Good
Conscience, according to the Complete and Perfect Example of my Lord and
Master, whom I Fear and follow, and serve, in the Fellowship of his Reproaches
and Sufferings in the Gospel Life and Peace, viz. The Lord God has opened mine
ear, (Blessed be his Glory Amen) and I was not Rebellious against him, neither
turned away back; I gave my back to the smiter, and my check to them that
plucked off the Hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting, my God knows
right well, in obedience to his will the same is done, being called to the
Fellowship of the same Sufferings and Glory of Gods Lamb, and to endure the
contradictions of ungodly sinners, as he did, yea, the Lord God will help me,
therefore shall I not be confounded; thou have made my face like a ^line, and I
know that I shall not be ashamed, he is near that justifies, who shall contend
with me?

Behold all ye that kindle a fire, and compass your selves about with sparks of
your own kindling, walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye
have kindled, this shall ye have of my hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.


This following was sent in a Letter, from the English Consul at Grand Caire,
to an English Merchant in Legorne in Italy, concerning Henry Fell and John
Stubs.

SIR,
I Forgot to advise you how that the Quakers at their departure, going down to
the Marine, did throw Pamphlets about the Streets, in ^atine, Hebrew and
Arabique, which might have set them a burning had they stayed a little longer;
Therefore I beseech you, if you hear hereafter of any such people that intend
to come this way, to prevent them what you can, for they may do me a great
prejudice.

Rich. Bendish.
Grand Caire, 20th. Septem. 1661.

A Loving Visitation, tendered to the English Merchants in Genoa, who received
it not.
Friends, Read and Honestly consider with the Spirit of Moderation, for whether
you will hear or forbear, this is that you may well understand, that in the
first place,

THE most Holy Faith of Gods Elect (without which its impossible to please God)
its not of that Nature, to Respect Persons, neither to give flattering Titles
to any man, (which are of the vain inventions of vain man) but to honor, or
well esteem all men in the Truth, Fear and Reverence of God, the which is to
have the Peculiar and Supreme Pre-eminence in every man's Conscience, and so to
rule over the whole Creation of God, that the Eternal Blessing of the Invisible
and Immortal God, by Jesus Christ the True Light of the world, may come upon
all, in the true Seed which is ordained to bruise the Serpents Head, and to
destroy the Devil and his unfruitful works of Darkness in man, the which
captivateth and defiles (and also is destructive to) the Creation, over which
the true Seed is to Rule, who is the True Light which lights every man, and
is the Way, the Life, the Truth, a manifestation of the same is in every man,
in Male and in Female, it shines in darkness (in man) and the same would guide
them out of, and from every unjust way, word, thought and action, yea and from
all unequitableness, into truth and uprightness, wherein the Riches of Eternal
Peace and Felicity may come, and in the same be possessed within the heart of
every particular, even in the midst of the sons of men, to the Glory of the
Everlasting Fountain of Life, from whence the true Property and pure nature of
every good thing receives virtue to subsist according to the excellent and
unsearchable wisdom and decree of the Divine Substance or Eternal Being of the
Majesty of the Heavenly Power of the Everlasting Light, who is the True and
Living God over all, blessed for ever, Amen.

Now to the end that prejudice and evil surmisings (which are not of God the
Father of all Truth) may be removed out of the minds of the men of my own
Nation (viz.) English, or any others that burden themselves because I cannot
give, neither receive the honor of the world, with its Ceremonies and
flattering Titles, either to my self or to any man, and I am willing to
testify, that its not in any contempt to the persons (which are the
workmanship of the Eternal God) of the sons of men, but for Conscience sake,
that I use not the same as in times past, and because I am well persuaded in
the Grace of God, and perfectly satisfied in the same measure in my own
particular; therefore in that love which thinks no evil, I am moved to give
forth some reasonable and true words, to a good end as aforesaid, which are not
contrary to God, neither to the example of just and honorable men, nor to the
Holy Scriptures of Truth, which says to the True Christians, If you respect
persons ye commit sin, and are convinced by the Law as Transgressors, says the
Apostle James, James 2.9. And there is no respect of persons with the Lord, who
will judge righteously according to every man's work says Peter, 1 Pet. 1.17.
And ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, Thou shall not respect the
person of the poor, nor honor the person of the Mighty, (mark that) but in
Righteousness shall thou judge thy Neighbor, says the Lord, Deuteronomy. 19.15. And
I say unto you, that for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
account thereof in the day of judgment, for by thy words thou shall be
justifi^d, and by thy words thou shall be condemned, says Jesus, Mat. 12.36,
37. I testify that the light of Christ Jesus in every man's Conscience, will
clearly show or manifest to man's understanding, what words, thoughts and
intentions are justifiable, and what are also condemnable; wherefore my spirit
of life is ready to say, Blessed is and shall the man be who suffers his mind
to be guided by the pure and true manifestation of the Eternal light, which is
of the Nature of God manifest within, as it is written, Romans 1.19, 20. 1 Cor.
12.7. For the manifestation of the Spirit (which is true) is given to every man
to profit withal, and they that profit not by the same, shall certainly
receive the unprofitable servants portion, not to Salvation, but contrariwise
unto perdition, which is the just reward of them, which not only reject the
Truth and receive it not in the love of the same, but also take pleasure in
unrighteousness, and so provoke the Lord to his Face, and defy and condemn the
just in themselves, and the Generation of the Righteous also in the General,
but ye shall not walk in the manners of the Nations, which I cast out before
you, says God to the true Seed, for they committed all these things, and
therefore I abhorred them, says the Lord, Levit. 20. let not me I pray you
respect the person of any, neither let me give flattering Titles unto men, for
I know not to give flattering Titles, in so doing my Maker would soon take me
away, Job 32. he will surely reprove you if ye secretly respect persons, shall
not his excellency make You afraid, Job 13. but they that are taking pleasure
in diverse lusts and vanities, which makes war against the Immortal soul, and
wounds the spirit of the just, these are they that are of one and the same
Nature and Generation that the holy and perfect man saw in his days (who
feared God and departed from evil) which rebel against the light, they know not
the ways thereof, neither abide in the paths thereof, who also say as they did
to the Most High, depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,
Job. 24.13, 14. Job 21. But God shall wound the Head of his Enemies, and spend
his Arrows of Famine and Destruction upon such as being often reproved, yet
hardneth their necks, and go on still in the way that is not holiness, rushing
mightily into sin and transgression, without fear or amazement, even as the
Horse rusheth into the Battle, and so greedily drink down iniquities even as
the Ox drinks water, yea and hate to be reformed, which is the greatest evil,
which hardneth their impenitent hearts the more unto perdition. Woe and alas
for them that sit in darkness, under the shadow of Death and Destruction,
before their day of Visitation finally pass away over their heads, when they
inexcusably may be left to cry out in the Anguish and Vexation of Spirit,
saying, How have we wilfully and rebelliously despised, and stifneckedly defied
the day of healing and saving health, and then say I, Dives his nature that
fared sumptuously every day in excess and fullness, shall sensibly discern the
nature of poor Lazarus and its reward, and also that which is of the flesh, the
first birth, and the lust thereof which is contrary to, and warreth against the
spirit and its birth, and then the two seeds may be discerned the one from the
other, the seed of God from the seed of the Serpent, Cain and Abels nature and
worship, Esau and Jacobs nature, the profane person, and the plain man, the
hunting nature, and that which is obedient, quiet and dwells within, at home in
his Tent; Isaak and Ismael, the seed of Bondage from beneath, and the free born
from Above, the scoffer which is to be cast out, and the beloved Heir of the
Promise which is to abide within, in the Fathers House for ever, for the seed
of Bondage is not to be heir with the Freeborn, neither to that seed do I
write the words of my living and true Testimony, but to that which is just in
every man's Conscience, in the sight of God do I desire to be manifest, and so I
shall be a sweet savor, not only in them that believe, but also in them that
perish, and if any have an ear to hear let him for his good.

And what if I say in truth on this wise, because the Fear and Reverence of the
Living Eternal Invisible God is set up within my heart, therefore (and not
otherwise) I cannot respect the persons of any, neither give or receive the
Honor and Glory of the world, Christ Jesus my Lord being my Perfect and
Complete Example, also who says, I receive not honor from man, and his very
enemies who came to provoke, and tempt, and ensnare him, they discerned that he
was a Just man, and that he respected not the person of any, as it is written
of him, that said to unbelievers on this wise, How can you believe which
receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor which comes from God
only, John 5. Mark that.

And I am right well and favorably persuaded that as any of the Sons of men
come to be honestly guided by a just, steadfast and equal Principle of God, as
is the Light of Christ within them, to walk thereby in a just path, and
equitable way, and in the same, at all times to speak true, fast, sound,
savoury and uncondemnable words and such like actions to all with whom they
have to do, and not to be hurtful or destructive to the Creation of God, but
also doing in the same light just and equitable things to all even as they
would be done by, according to the perfect doctrine of Christ, the Law and the
Prophets, I say the same will testify for them, and make them truly
honorable, and draw down Blessings, and not the contrary; and so in every
Nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him, and
these things will be acceptable and justificable and not condemnable in the
sight and presence of the everlasting God, and so the true honor comes to be
manifest which comes from God, whose eternal eye, the Light perfectly
discerns, and sees into, and wisely searches every man's heart within, and
God is not divided from his eye, for as God is said to be a spirit, so he is
light, 1 Epist. John 1. from which no secret work of darkness can in any wise
be hid, all be it the same be acted never so secretly. And behold I testify in
his Name that is true, that the sound of his mighty day is come to the Nations,
and the same terrible and glorious day has begun to dawn in England in the
North, and behold his everlasting Light is arising over all Nations even the
Light of the Lord Jesus who lightneth the poor and deceitful man's eyes, yea he
lightneth every man that comes into the world with the Light that is perfect
and true, either to condemn or justify every man's words, thoughts and actions,
and this perfect Light of eternity is manifestly arisen up and has its
pre-eminence that is just in thousands to the glory of the Lord who works
both to will and to do in them that fear him, and have received of the fullness
of his life in the same in which they live, and walk, and rest, and so are
become a blessing to the Nations in the Light of his eternal Countenance, in
whom also they have believed unto Salvation, the transparent brightness of
which through such clouds of living witnesses, is shining forth over the
Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples that have corrupted the Earth, and a^e
degenerated and alienated in obscurity under a thick vail of darkness in the
night of Apostasy since the Holy Apostles days, from the Light and Life of the
Invisible and Immortal God and his Lamb the light who is coming in 10 thousands
of his Saints to convince all of their ungodlike words, Hard-speeches, Thoughts
and Actions, and to lead as many as receive and believe in the same Light with
which they be enlightened from all sin and unrighteousness, and so from the
condemnation of the same and wrath to come, even up to God the Father of all
truth, from whence the Light, Life and every good thing comes, according to
the Prophecy of good old Enoch and the rest of the Prophets, and blessed shall
the Man, the Family, the City, the Kingdom, the Nation be that does not
wilfully and rebelliously reject, but receive and accept of the good day of
their Visitation of Salvation, of which I am one that gives a certain sound,
being saved by the same Grace and Life of God (that brings Salvation, and
appears to all men, to the end that they may be saved by it also, and
redeemed from Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Peoples, for all the Earth was of
one Language before Babel or Nimrods Generation of Builders was, and the Holy
scriptures says, That he was a mighty hunter before the Lord, who did and will
confound their many Languages and Tongues that are out of the Truth and
Plainness, into which the sons of men are to be redeemed from the contrary,
for which my soul in love to the whole Creation travelleth, and my spirit in
the same is ready to say Amen, to the counsel of the Everlasting light in the
truth, for the good and well-being of all the sons of men, under what name or
denomination soever they be called, albeit, I am as a stranger among them, and
as an outcast or vile offscouring of the world, and forsaken, but its not so
with me of the Lord Almighty, whose servant and living witness I am, and his
clean pure spirit of Life within my very Heart and Bowels bears me record to
the same in Peace, whether the sons of men believe me or not, or hear or
forbear, who scornfully call me a Quaker, but in the Power of God do I work out
my salvation with Fear and Trembling, according to the Holy Apostles sound
Doctrine and scriptures of Truth; And my name is known to the world (and to the
saints in light upon the earth.)

Genoa this first month, the tenth day, and of the year, 1662. Daniel Baker.


This was Rejected and not received by them.

THe Holy Apostle Paul as the Scripture says, (in his life) which gives
testimony unto this day on this wise, (to wit) that all Asia had forsaken him,
and what after there has been in these latter days among them called
Christians, not only in Asia, but also in all parts of the World where the
joyful sound has come, but many rebel against the visitation of life and
salvation, so that they have rejected the word of the Lord, and its
Ambassadors of peace and saving health, which the most high has sent to and
among them, and as the hard-hearted Jews in unbelief cried help men of Israel,
against two poor harmless Lambs in those days of the Holy Apostles, that were
deemed by them to be such as turned the World upside down, and contrary to all
men, on such wise the same voice has been sounded ^orth and lifted up unwisely
by the same Spirit in Asia against two plain naked Messengers and Ministers of
Truth; But how is it that wise men seem to be so veiled, or what is the matter
that their understandings are so darkened from the Wisdom and the clear Spirit
of discerning that of the Pure Immortal God, that they cannot see what they do,
many of them whom my heart pitieth: Why should ye be so afraid of the harmless
and guiltless that sounds the Message of undeniable Truth, even the Word of the
Lord which is the Sword of the Spirit, whose weapons are not carnal or visible,
as Cain and Judas's were, but Spiritual, with the same to make war against
Spiritual wickedness, and to destroy and cut down that which rules even in
high places, and in the Power of the Word Eternal to beat down and kill that
which is hurtful and destructive to the Creation of God, in Nations, Kingdoms,
Thrones and Dominions, that the same Power of the gentle Lamb of God may rule
in and over all as in the beginning, to the End that every man that lives
under the name or denomination of a Christian, may clearly and truly say from
his very heart [without mocking or provoking God Eternal to his Face] viz. AS
IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING, SO IT IS NOW, AND EVER SHALL BE, And if the Sons of men
did but suffer the fear of the Lord to possess their hearts, and thereby
honestly consider the weight of these words which so many vainly and unwisely
utter, they would in the first place fear and tremble, and not take the Name of
the Lord so in vain, nor offer the sacrifice of fools. But alas, there is few see
as it was in the beginning, or how it is now, or what shall be in the World
which has no end, which is the same which in the beginning was, in which is
the life which is the light of men, which men hate, because their deeds are
evil, which unfruitful works blinds the eye of a good and noble understanding,
and therefore even a Magestrate, being so veiled, albeit in the place of
Judicature, having a sword in his hand, lifts it up and bears it against the
just and guiltless, and so smites and wounds the Innocent, which should be a
terror to the evil doer, and to them that do well not hurtful, but a praise;
but otherwise it has sadly happened in Ages and Generations even unto this our
day against the Lamb, and his appearance in and through his Members, who has
been wounded and slain since the foundation of the World: And so it comes to
pass through many that are in one and the same nature of transgression, Even
as a blind man, having a sword in his hand, being hasty and as it were mad,
lays it he knows not where, and smites he knows not what; And so he was a wise
man that said on this wise, to wit, Man being in honor and understands it
not, is like the beast that perish.

Now having a necessity in equitablenesse to give forth these writings to
public view to a good end, for the good of all that hear and discern between
the things that are of a good report from what is otherwise condemnable and not
justifiable in the sight of God, neither of good men, and also seeing it is so,
that plain Truth and its Friends, Followers and Messengers among the Nations
(as its their portion to pass through the contradictions and manifold
sufferings and reproaches of Christ their complete example) are daily beset
with the same afflictions, and false reports from multitudes that are saying
with open mouth, as in the days of the Prophets, Report say they, and we will
report, yet we delight not to Retaliate any more then a good necessity from God
Almighty lies on us, to give testimony for his Truth and Name and peoples
sake, for on this wise did the holy Prophets and Apostles as the holy
Scriptures of Truth largely testifies, as in the Books of Jeremy, Psalms and
the New Testament, and the Acts.

This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and
magnified themselves, against the People of the Lord of hosts, the Lord will be
terrible unto them, for he will famish all the gods of the earth, and men shall
worship him, every one from his place, even all the Isles of the Heathen, Zeph.
2.10, 11.
