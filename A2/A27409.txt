TO GEORGE Lord JEFFERIES LATE Lord CHANCELLOR of England.
My LORD,
I Know not to whom I could more properly Dedicate a Treatise of this Nature,
than to your Lordship, who lately was Lord Chief Justice of England, and have
set such remarkable Copies to inferior Magistrates. What is here offered may
serve as a Mirror, in which future Administrators of public Justice would do
well to look; for you may remember, my Lord, (if your Lordships present
Afflictions have not made you forget as much Law as you ever learnt) Common Law
runs much upon Presidents: And if a Man happen to have none of the best
Physiognomies, there is no reason why he should straight grow angry, and fling
stones, to break all the Looking-glasses he meets with, only because they
represent the true Figure of the Object.

My Lord, The following Treatise is a true Account of your Lordships Life and
Actions, (most of which are ready to be attested upon Oath) of your unheard of
Cruelties and barbarous Proceedings in your whole Western Circuit: In which all
may see at what dear rates our Western Martyrs purchased this religion, and how
that it cost those glorious Sufferers that so lately went off the stage (under
your Lordships Sentence) both Whippings and cruel Imprisonments, and the most
exquisite Tortures which none could invent or inflict but your Lordship, (who
is supposed by all to have an Heart of marble, and Entrails of brass) nor any
endure but they whose gallant and noble Souls were born up with heavenly
Cordials, and a Power from on high. But my Lord, rest assured, that their Blood
still cries for Vengeance, and will be a lasting monument of your Lordships
Cruelties, whilst History can speak or transmit to incredulous Posterity the
remarkables of elapsed Ages; for Hang, Draw and Quarter, and Try Men
afterward, (Witness Sir Thomas Armstrong's Death, etc.) has been your peculiar
Talent. But your Lordship will now at last do well to remember that King Alfred
caused forty four Judges in one year to be Hanged as Murderers, for their false
Judgments.

I hope your Lordship will pardon this present Address, seeing it is a
Privilege we modern Authors hold by prescription, to put any great Body's Name
in the front of our Book: Princes have not been able to exempt themselves or
their Families from the Persecution of Dedications; nor ever was there (I
humbly conceive) any Rule made in your Lordships Court to forbid them.

Suffer then, I beseech your Lordship, this Address to remain a Monument to
Posterity, of the sentiments this Age has of your Lordships Conduct and Merits;
and Witness to all the World how much its Author is

Your LORDSHIPS Most Humble Servant, James Bent.

A POEM, TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE Lord JEFFERIES.
I Cannot hold, hot struggling Rage aspires,
And crowds my freeborn breast with noble fires,
Whilst prudent fools squeak Treason through the nose,
And whine a quivering Vote in sneaking Prose,
My Muse soars out of reach, and dares despise
What e're below attempts to Tyrannize.
Tho I by some base Nero should be clad
In such a Gown as the old Christians had,
In clouds of Satyr up to Heaven I*de roll,
For he could burn my shell, but not my Soul.
Tho Nature her auspicious aid refuse,
Revenge and Anger shall inspire my Muse*
Nature has given me a complaining part,
And murdered Protestants a resenting Heart*
Then room for bloody Jefferys or he will swear
By all the Aps from St. Cadwallader;
Prutus hur creat Cranfather, if hur enquire,
And Adam's Cranfather was Prutus sire;
Famous ap Shenkin was hur elder Brother,
Some Caledonian Sycorax hur Mother:
Or some she-De'il more damned than all the rest,
At their black Feast hur lustful Sire comprest:
Thence do I think this Cacademon rose,
Whose wrathful Eyes his inward baseness shows;
His shape is all inhumane and uncouth,
But yet he is chiefly Devil about the MOUTH;
With care this Brat was nursed for fear it should
Grow tame, and so degenerate into good:
With City-charters he was wrapped about,
And Acts of Parliament for swadling-clout:
As he grew up, he won a noble Fame,
For which Squire Ketch has sworn him public shame.
And will not it be a pretty sight to see it,
The Hangman, Rope, and bloody Jefferies meet?
Jefferys who cherisht spite, as all can tell;
Jefferys who was the darling Brat of Hell.
Often with success this mighty Blast did bawl,
Where loudest Lungs, and biggest words win all;
And still his clenched Arguments did end
With that home-thrust, He is not Caesar's Friend.
Sometimes that jaded Ears he might release,
Good Man! he has been fee'd to hold his Peace.
Hear him, but never see him, and you would swear
He was the Crier, not the Counselor:
He roars, as if he only chanced to find
Justice was now grown deaf as well as blind.
This Demy-fiend, this Hurricane of Man
Was sent to butcher all in the West he can:
'Twas him the Popish Party wisely chose
To splutter Law, and the dinn'd Rabble pose:
They have a thousand Tongues, yet he can roar
Far louder, tho they had a thousand more
Unto long-winded Cook he scorns ^o
But Pleads, his Majesly will have it so.
He Is for all Mischief set, by Nature bred;
He rails at all before him, and is fed
Hyaena like, by tearing up the Dead.
The unluckiest Satyrist alive, that still
Writes his own Character in all that is ill.
Of all the World most fit a Vice to expose,
That all its Cause, Effects and Motions knows,
Stranger to none can no advantage lose.
Big with conceit the empty shape looks great,
His own dear self obligingly does treat:
Rewards his Soul in any garb will lap,
His ductile Soul will put on any shape:
Vice has his patronage, and there is no fear
But Hell in time may his protection share,
The rather 'cause the god of gold is there.
He courts loud rumor, but lets truth alone,
Conscious of guilt, he shuns being justly known,
And by's often changing flies a definition.
Learned, but in ill; Ingenious but in spite;
Virtuous by accident, by chance a Wit;
Modest, when beat; in suffering valiant;
Honest, when forced; and moderate when in want:
True, but for Interest; Civil, but for dread;
Devout for Alms; and Loyal but for bread.
Thy mushroom Greatness I dare now arraign,
For all thy Hectoring now will be in vain.
Here, take this Pass, e're we for ever part;
Then run, and then farewell with all my heart.
The Lawyers yelling in their feigned debate,
And the fleeced Clients Wisdom, all too late;
The keeping Cully's Jealousy and Care,
The slighted Lover's Maggots and Despair;
A Woman's Body every day to dress,
A fickle Soul, little as theirs, or less;
The Courtiers business, the Impudence of the Stage,
And the defeated Father Peter's Rage;
A Clock-work Spouse with loud eternal Clack
A Shop in the Change still tied to What do you lack:
Worse than these last, if any Curses more
Ovid e're knew, or fiercer Oldham's store;
'Till not one part in Body or Soul be free,
May all their barbed Vengeance shower on thee:
Pressed with their weight, long may thou raving lie,
Envying an Halter, but not dare to dye:
And when Condemned thou do thy Clergy plead,
Some frightful Fiend deny thee Power to read;
Madness, Despair, Confusion, Rage and Shame
Attend you to the Place from whence you came:
To Tyburn thee let carrion Horses draw,
In jolting Cart, without so much as straw;
Jaded, may they lie down in the road, and tired,
And (worse than one fair hanging, twice bemir'd)
May thou be mauled with Pulchers Sextons Sermon.
'Till thou roar out for Hemp-sake, Drive on Car-man.
Pelted and Cursed in the road by every one,
E'ne to be hanged may thou the Gauntlet run.
Not one good Woman who in Conscience can
Cry out, -- It Is pity, -- Troth, a proper Man.
Stupid and dull, may thou rub off like Hone,
Without an open, or a smothered groan:
May the Knot miss the place, and fitted be
To plague and torture, not deliver thee;
Be half a day a Dying thus, and then
Revive like Savage to be Hanged again.
In Pity now thou shall no longer Live,
For when thus satisfied, I can forgive.
John Carter.

THE Bloody Assizes: OR, A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF GEORGE Lord JEFFERYS.
REader, Think it not strange if I present you with the memorable Life and
Actions of a Person, so well known in this great Kingdom: And peradventure Fame
has not been silent in other Countries, especially since he has been advanced
to be a Chief Minister of State, and sat as it were steering at the Helm of
Government. Various indeed are the Changes of worldly Affairs, and the Actions
of Humane Life, which have been more particularly exemplified in the Rise and
Fall of the Person, the subject of this Discourse; who from almost a mean
obscurity, soared to the lofty Pyramid of Honor; where, for a while, like an
unfixed Starr, he appeared to the Eyes of the wondering Nation, giving an
imperfect luster; 'till by the sudden turn and change of unsteady Fortune, he
dropped headlong from his Sphere, and lost at once his Grandeur and his Power. To
let Mankind see how little trust there is to be given to the smiles of
flattering Greatness, especially when attained by violent and pressing motions:
I now proceed to trace this unfortunate Favorite in the sundry Capacities and
Stations that have hitherto made up the series of his Life.

He was Born at Acton, near Wrexam, in Denbigh-shire, in Wales, about the Year
1648. His Fathers Name was -- Jefferies, being reputed a Gentleman in that
Country, though of no large Fortune or Estate; however he lived very
comfortably on what he had, improving his yearly Income by his Industry; and
gained by his plain and honest Endeavors a good repute amongst the Gentry of
those Parts; insomuch that it was not long before he, upon the recommendation
of some Person of Interest and Ability, gained a Wife of a good House; and they
lived very comfortably together in their rural Habitation, being far from
Ambition, or striving for Court-favour; but contented with what God had blessed
them with, and the fruits of their own Industry, they found a solid Happiness
in that Contentment. Nor had they lived together any considerable time, but
amongst other Children, the fruits of Wedlock, God was pleased to bestow on
them the Person who is intended the subject of this Discourse, who was in due
time Baptized by the Christian Name of George; whether he had Godfathers, etc.
it does not occurr; however he under the care and diligence of his industrious
Parents grew up, and appeared to all that studied him, of a very prompt and
ready Wit, active, and striving for Preeminency, even among his Compeers in his
tender Age, which lively demonstrated that an Air of Ambition was inherent to
his Person.

As soon as he was capable to receive Learning, he was put to a Country
School, where he was furnished with such Education as that afforded, which was
not extraorninary; yet his natural Parts set it off to the best Advantage; and
growing to Years of somewhat a ripe understanding, and not very tractable, his
Father by the Advice of some of his Confidents, caused him to be brought to
London; and finding him not inclinable to any Trade, but rather addicted to
Study, he entered him, or by his Procurement he was entered into the Free School
of Westminster, where he profited much; so that he was by the care of the
worthy Master thereof soon enabled to understand the Languages, or at least so
many of them as were convenient for the study of the Law, which above other
things he aimed at; tho his Father seemed not very pliable to his desires; for
perceiving in his Soul a more than ordinary spark of Ambition, fearing it might
kindle into a flame, and prove one day his ruin, he labored to hinder the
ways he conceived most likely to bring it upon him; and is reported to say
(when he found he could not dissuade him from what he purposed, gently clapping
him on the back,) Ah George, George, I fear thou will dye with thy Shoes and
Stockings on: What he meant by that Expression, I determine not, but leave the
Reader to Interpret.

Upon the Coming in of King Charles the 2d, and the restoring the Face of
Affairs in the Kingdom, the Law revived again, and began to flourish; the
Practitioners lived in much Credit and Reputation, and many of them purchased
large Estates, which served to wing the desire of this Person with Impatience;
and some say he was the rather incited to it by a Dream he had whilst a
Scholar at Westminster School, viz. That he should be the chief Scholar in
that School, and afterward should enrich himself by Study and Industry, and
that he should come to be the second Man in the Kingdom; but in conclusion,
should fall into great disgrace and misery: This is confidently reported; and
some say himself told it to sundry Persons, since when he found the second part
of it was fulfilled, by acquiring the Chancellourship, and standing high in the
Favor of his Prince.

However, we find the latter part did not deterr him from his purpose; for
having entered himself in the Inner Temple House, one of the chief Inns of
Court, after his performing such things as are conformable to the Customs of
the House, we find him called to the Bar, by the Interest he made with the
Benchers and Heads of that learned Society, earlier than had been usual,
leaping over the Heads of elder Graduates.

This happening about the twentieth Year of the Reign of King Charles the 2d.
and the City of London beginning to raise her self out of her ashes, more
stately and magnificent than before she sunk in flames, a Sacrifice to the
Revenge and Malice of the Papists, as by the late Inscription on the Monument,
and upon Record it appears: This great City I say, regaining her Trade, her
Privileges and Customs were kept up with great exactness, so that in the
Courts at Guild Hall there was much business; which being considered by this
Person as more beneficial than that at Westminster, by reason of its frequency,
and being carried on briefer, and with less difficulty; which induced him to
give his Attendance, as also at Hixes-Hall, and other inferior Courts and
Places; insomuch that he being of a bold Presence, and having naturally a
fluent Tongue, an audible Voice, and good Utterance, he had not Pleaded often
before he was very much taken Notice of; and gained so much Credit with the
People, that they preferred him before any of the younger sort of Barristers;
by which means he found his lucky Stars begin to smile upon him; so that he
was in a manner Courted to take Fees, and had Breviates thrust into his Hand
frequently in the middle of a Cause by Persons, when they perceived it went ill
on their sides, and was like to go against them.

Thus flushed with Success, he now thought of nothing more than how he might
climb; nor did he want an Opportunity, for the next Station we find him in, is
that of Common Sergeant, to the great and honorable City of London; and so
much Fortune favored him at this time, that Alderman Jefferys the great
Smoaker, having often observed his Discourse and Actions, took such a liking to
him, that being of the same Name, though not in the least any Relation, he
backed him with his Purse and Interest, which was not inconsiderable; and
thereby not only enabled him to carry on his Grandeur, but to purchase as he
found a convenience or advantage, in order to his keeping it up in the World.

These, I say, being the Degrees by which he was climbing the slippery stair of
Honor, to contract a firmer alliance, he Addressed himself to a brisk young
Widow, Daughter to Sir Tho. Bloodworth, then one of the Aldermen of the City;
and who in the time of the dreadful Conflagration had the Chair, as being then
Lord Mayor; and so far prevailed upon the Lady and her Father, that he gained
both their Consents, and the Contract was made, the Nuptials solemnized; And
soon after he had the pleasure to behold the fruits of his Labor. Sir John
Howel the Recorder of London giving place, the Recordership became vacant,
which made this Person lay* hold of that Opportunity, to use his own and the
Interest of his Friends, to acquire that Place of Trust and Honor; nor did his
Measures fail him, for by the powerful influence he had by this time gained
over sundry Persons, who were best able to promote him to what he so earnestly
labored to arrive at, he was Chosen and Confirmed Recorder of the Honorable
City; taking upon him the Charge and Care of the Writings, Papers, etc. that
belong to so great a Charge and Trust, as that of a Recorder of the City of
London.

By this means being become (as himself declared) The Mouth of the City, and as
we may term him, Capital Judge in the Guild Hall, in Controversies at the
Sessions held there, etc. and the Power of breathing forth Sentences of
Punishment being put into his hands, he found his Ambition enlarged, aiming at
nothing more than to become a Court-Favourite: Nor was it long before an
Opportunity offered it self, to make him to be taken notice of; for so it
happened that some Persons had imprinted a Psalter, and Entitled it (the
better to shadow the Injury they had done to the Company of Stationers, by
invading their Property) The King's Psalter, which occasioning a Dispute, it
was referred to a Hearing before the Council at White Hall, the King being
present, and the Company the better to make out their Title and Claim, carried
with them this Person as their Council; who in the opening of the Case, and
making the Complaint of the apparent Injury done to the Company, in Printing
what was really their Propriety, he had this Expression, viz. They have teemed
with a spurious Brat, which being clandestinely midwiv'd into the World, the
better to cover the Imposture, they ^ay it at your Majesty's door, etc. This,
though the King might have taken it (for sundry Reasons) as a Reflection upon
his Royal Person, yet he was so far from resenting it that way, that he only
turned to one of the Lords that sat next him, and said, This is a bold Fellow
I*le warrant him; and indeed the Stationers had the Matt^r declared by the
Honorable Board in their Favor.

About this time the Popish Plot being discovered by Dr. Oats and others, the
Nation was for a while in a Ferment, and matters run extremely high in Disputes
and Controversies, and he sailed with the Current, declaring with much heat and
violence against the Priests, Jesuits, and others of the Conspirators and
Romish Faction; as appeared not only by his vehement Expressions in pleading
against them, but the alacrity and little Concern that was visible in his
Countenance, when at any time as Recorder of London he passed Sentence of Death
upon any of them; which he frequently did with more or less of Reproach, and
became in a manner the Terror of that Party. But no sooner he perceived the
Wind tacking at Court, and that there was some misunderstanding between K.
Charles II. and his Parliament, but he began to fall off and grow cold in
Prosecuting the Ends of the Government, being frequently at Court, and
laboring as much as in him lay to draw the Magistracy of the City after him,
as appears more especially by one Passage, viz. The King being recovered of an
Indisposition, that had for some time put the Kingdoms in a fear and doubt of
his Life, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen went to Congratulate him upon his going
abroad; after which, and a favorable Reception, it was proposed by this Person
that they should in the like manner wait upon his Royal Highness, then Duke of
York, who was not long before returned from Flanders; but perceiving no
forwardness to be seconded, he only with his Father-in-law stayed behind to
gain that Access: These and other Proceedings created in the City a Jealousy,
that he had espoused an Interest to their Prejudice, which wrought so strongly
in their Conceits, that it was concluded in the Council Chamger at Guild Hall,
that he should resign his Recordership; and accordingly they sent to him to
deliver back the Papers and Writings they had entrusted him with, which
accordingly was done, and Sir George Treby constituted Recorder in his stead.

This so nettled him, that he now openly declared* himself to be what before
was only suspected, indulging his thoughts in nothing more than how he might
revenge it upon the Dissenters, to whose influence on the Court of Aldermen he
attributed his dismission from the Recordership, and used his Endeavors to
blacken them as much as he could: Yet all his Honor was not sunk, for he had
prevailed for the Removal of Sir Job Charleton from the Chief Justiceship of
the County Palatine of Chester, and by the Importunity and Interest of his
Party at Court, gained it for himself; and took the first Possession of that
Charge in much splendor, paying at that time his Father a Visit with a
numerous Train, which put the old Gentleman into such a fret, for the drinking
up his Cider, and devouring his Provisions, that he charged him with the
undertaking to ruin him, by bringing a whole Country at his heels, commanding
him never to attempt the like Prodigality again with hopes of success.

Many Petitions being put up upon the Dissolving the Parliament in 1682. by
most of the Counties, and Buroughs, and Corporations of England, for the
speedy Calling another, to redress the Grievances of the Nation; and the King
showing some dislike of that manner of Proceeding, this Person further to
endear himself to the Interest of the Court, declared in his Station as
vehemently against them, by saying, He abhorred that Petitioning, etc. from
which, and the discountenancing the Petitioners as much as in him lay, he
gained the Name and Epithet of an Abhorrer; and upon the Burning the Pope in
Effigies at Temple-Barr, upon the Birthday of Queen Elizabeth, amongst other
Figures, the Arch-waggs had set one on Horseback with his Face to the Tail,
and a Paper on his back, viz. I am an Abhorrer.

During these Transactions, the Parliament being called, met at Westminster,
and amongst others this Person was called before them, for attempting to
infringe upon the Rights and Privileges of the People, etc. and obliged at the
Bar of the Commons House (after having been heard what he could say in defense
of his Proceedings by his Council) to make his Acknowledgment upon his Knees,
and receive the Reprimand of the Speaker; whereupon, with some sharp Rebukes,
as the Censure of the House, he was discharged.

To comfort him in this Affliction, that was not by a Man of his Haughty Spirit
a little stomacked, this Parliament being Dissolved, and a Call of Sergeants
had at the Kings-Bench-Bar Westminster, he was the First in the Roll, and
consequently the Kings Sergeant; and as it is usual to present the King with a
Ring on that occasion, the Motto he agreed to was, A Deo Rex, a Rege Lex, viz.
The King from God, and the Law from the King. And now the Popish party playing
their Cards with more security, Edward Fitz-Harris who had been Impeached by
the Commons, and stood charged by them of High Treason; being nevertheless,
upon the Dissolution Tried at the Kings Bench-Bar; this Person was the
principal stickler against him, and by his Rhetorical and florid expressions,
wrought so powerfully with the Jury, who were somewhat in doubt what they
should do in this Case, that they found him Guilty, and the Impeachment in
Parliament set aside, he was Executed as a Traitor at Tyburn: and soon after
this, the Dissenters losing of their Esteem in the eyes of the Court-party, and
some Justices of Peace of Midlesex being sharp upon them, this person was
chosen Chairman at the Sessions of Hicks's-Hall, where he had an opportunity
to make them as he found his time, see the resentments of his anger, but this
place being held too low for a Spirit winged with so large an Ambition, he
aimed at higher things, resolving like Icarus to be near the Sun, though at the
hazard of melting his waxen Wings, dropping headlong into the Sea of inevitable
Ruin: whereupon perceiving some hot contests in the City of London, about the
Election of Magistrates and Officers, he turned the Edge of his Fury that way,
insomuch that a Quo-warranto came down against the Charter of the Honorable
City of London, and in fine, after much Pleading and Argument, pro and contra,
the Charter was surrendered, at least in consent, by those that were in Power,
and the King suspending the Execution of the Judgment obtained, caused such
orders to be observed as he thought most convenient, which being so well known
to the Citizens of London, it would appear a presumption in me to enter upon
particulars; yet the chiefest cavil against the City was, taking the Toll of
Markets, collecting Money to build Cheapside Conduit, etc. Nor was it long
after this, and the Trial of several Persons for Rioters, who attended the
Election of Sheriffs and Mayor, and the Fines passing upon many worthy Citizens
as Rioters on that occasion; in promoting which, this Person as a Counselor by
his florid Rhetoric was mainly instrumental, by giving the Court an account of
their respective Abilities, the better to settle the Fines: but the Lord Chief
Justice Sannders dying, he succeeded him as Lord Chief Justice of the
King's Bench; in which station he was scarcely settled, but he admitted the
Popish Lords to Bail, that lay under an impeachment in Parliament, and whose
Bailing had been refused by the Judges his Predecessors; and now it was that he
began more particularly to remember former affronts, an Example of which take
in the Case of Elias Best a Hop-merchant in Thames Street, viz.

It so happened when this Person was Recorder of London, that a Jury, of which
Best was one, having contrary to his mind, Acquitted a party Indicted at the
Sessions of Peace in Guild Hall, for Printing and Publishing a Pamphlet, he in
much heat declared that they had gone contrary to their Consciences, and stuck
not to upbraid them with Perjury; for which, as a high affront put upon the
Juries of London, they prayed the Court at the Old Bailey, that they might
prefer an Indictment against him; and herein Mr. Best was the most active, but
the Lord Chief Justice Scroggs then upon the Bench, after it had been a long
time Argued and debated, told them that the Sessions being almost at an end, it
could not be Tried, and therefore he would desire them to defer it to the next
Sessions, for the Recorder being a person of Quality, he could not suffer him
to lie under the imputation of an Indictment so long; but in the Interim, he
resigning his Recordership, the business fell and came to nothing; but soon
after, it seems, Mr. Best had drank a Health to the pious Memory of Stephen
College departed, meaning the Joyner that was Executed at Oxford, for which he
was Indicted upon an Information, and found Guilty; yet he being at large,
thought fit to withdraw himself to avoid the Rigor of the Fine, etc. when so it
fell out, that this person going the Circuit as Lord Chief Justice, accompanied
with a great many on Horseback, Mr. Best came by, and asked one of the Company
what Judge that was, who replied, the Lord Chief Justice Jefferys, and he
unadvisedly told that party his name was Best, and desired him to remember his
Service to his Lordship; upon notice of which, he immediately caused him to be
fetched back, and committed him to York Gaol, from whence he was brought by
Habeus Corpas to the King's Bench, and Imprisoned for a Fine of 500 l. etc. And
other instances of the Greatness of his Stomach, though in another nature, is
that which so remarkably happened at Kingston upon Thames, at the Midsummer
Assizes held there for the County of Surry, 1679.

At this Assize being Council in a Case upon Nisi prius, before Sir Richard
Weston, one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and desiring to ingrosse all the
questions, without suffering those on the other side to ask the Witness what
was convenient in carrying on, and managing the Cause; he was desired by the
Judge to hold his Tongue, etc. upon which some words passing, this Person told
him he did not use him like a Conncellor, curbing him in the managing his
Breviate, etc. to which the Judge fiercely replied: Ha! since the King has
thrown his favors upon you, in making you Chief Justice of Chester, you think
to run down every body, if you find your self aggrieved make your complaint,
here is no body cares for it: And this Person replying, That he had not been
used to make complaints, but rather stopped those that were made; when being
again Commanded to hold his Tongue, he sat down and wept for anger, etc. And
here by the way it will not be amiss to let the Reader have a taste of some
passages that happened on the public Stage of business, in the Jocular part of
this great Man's Life, and the Repartees he met with, of which I shall instance
a few:

Once it happened upon a Trial, that a plain Country fellow giving Evidence in
the Court, and pressing it home, moved this person who was Council on the other
side, to pick a quarrel with the poor man's Leather Doublet, and amongst other
Interrogations bawled out, You fellow in the Leather Doublet, pray what have
you for Swearing; the Man upon this, looking steadily on him, replied, Truly
Sir, if you have no more for Lying than I have for Swearing, you might wear a
Leather Doublet as well as I: This bluntly retorted, moved at that time much
laughter, and filled the Town with the discourse of it.

Another time it so fell out, that some Musitioners brought an Action against a
person, at whose Wedding they had played, for the Money they were promised or
expected, when in the midst of the Evidence, this Person called to one of them,
viz. You Fiddler, etc. at which the Man seeming to be disgusted, he again, upon
the parties alleging himself to be a Musitioner demanded what difference there
was between a Musitioner and a Fiddler; As much, Sir, said he, as there is
between a pair Bagpipes and a Recorder; and he then being Recorder of London,
it was taken as a suitable Repartee.

Being at a Country Assize as Judge, an old Man with a great Beard, came to
give evidence before him, and not doing it to his mind, he began to cavil with
his Beard, and amongst other expressions told him, that if his Conscience was
as large as his Beard, he might well swear any thing; This so nettled the old
blade, that without any respect to his greatness, he briskly replied, My Lord,
If you go about to measure Consciences by Beards, your Lordship has none: Many
more of this kind might be mentioned, but not being greatly to the purpose,
they are willingly omitted.

But to return to the thread of this Discourse; passing by his vehement and
pressing Discourse to the Jury against William Lord Russel, on his Trial at the
Old Bailey, which some say greatly influenced them to find him Guilty; and add,
that he did it out of a Pique, in remembrance he was one of the Members of the
Parliament before whom he was brought on his Knees. We find him by this time
Trying of Dr. Titus Oats upon two Informations, upon the account of his
Swearing to the White-Horse Consult, and Ireland's being in Town; and after a
long Debate, wherein many sharp Repartees passed, the Jury made a shift to find
him Guilty; as to the Circucumstances, I referr you to the Trial; but the
Sentence was severe, and of its Effects few are ignorant, wherefore I shall
pass it over, as also that of Mr. Tho. Dangerfield, another of the Evidences in
discovering the Contrivances and carrying on of the Popish Plot, which the
Papists by these manner of Proceedings accounted to be damned to the lowest
Erebus. And now before any thing remarkably happened, the Kingdom was allarum'd
by the landing of the late Duke of Monmouth at Lyme in Dorset-shire, and the
Earl of Argyle in Scotland; but however these two unfortunate Gentlemen
miscarrying, and losing their Lives, left a great many of their miserable
Followers to feel the severity of Punishment; and as for the gleanings of the
bloody Field in England, they came to the sifting of this Person, who with
others, going down with a Commission to Try them, all the Indignities the
Dissenters had put upon him came fresh into his remembrance, so that he made
them find the Laws more cruel than the Sword, and wish they had fallen in the
Field, rather than have come to his handling; for he breathed Death like a
destroying Angel, and sanguined his very Ermins in Blood, a large Account of
which you shall have in its proper place.

But by the way, for the sake of the West-Country Reader, I shall here add a
true and impartial Narrative of the late Duke of Monmouth's whole Expedition
whilst in the West; seeing that was the Prologue to that bloody Scene that
you will hear by and by, was acted by George Lord Jefferies (the Subject of our
present Discourse.)

To begin then, May 24. Old Style, We left Amsterdam about two of the Clock,
being Sunday Morning, and in a Lighter Sailed for the Texel, our Vessels being
sent before us thither; but meeting with extreme cross Winds all the way, we
Arrived not till Saturday Night, and then went all on Board. Here our Man of War
with about 32 Guns (where the Dukes Person was) was under an Arrest by order of
the States of Amsterdam, on the Complaint of our Envoy, they presuming we had
been clear, but we broke through our Arrest, and Sunday Morning at break of
Day, set Sail for England. We had in all three Ships, that of 32 Guns carried
most of our Men, the other two were for our Ammunition. We met with exceeding
cross Winds, most part of the time we spent on the Seas, and Arrived not at
Lime till* Thursday, June 11. so that from Amsterdam to Lime, we wanted but two
days of three Weeks.

We Landed without any the least Opposition, and were received with all
Expressions of Joy imaginable; the Duke, as soon as he Jumpt out of his Boat on
Land, called for silence, and then desired we would join with him in returning
God Thanks for that wonderful Preservation we had met with at Sea, and
accordingly fell on his Knees on the Sand, and was the Mouth of us all in a
short Ejaculation, and then immediately well Armed, as many as we were, entered
the Town.

Friday, the whole day was spent in Listing of Men, which flocked to us so
fast, that we could scarce tend them with Arms.

The like, Saturday also; and then about ten of the Clock at Night, 300 of our
Men were sent to Bridport, about six English Miles off, to Storm that Town
betimes in the Morning, which we did accordingly, taking many Prisoners out of
their Lodgings, and had not our Soldiers been a little too eager of Plunder, we
had made a good days work on it; but there lying about a Wood some of the Kings
Forces, we were forced to Retreat, losing three or four Men, and killing
several of theirs, and taking Eight Prisoners; this was the first Action which
he had.

Sunday also was spent in Listing, and Monday Morning; but in the Afternoon we
Marched out of Lime for Axminster, a little Town four Mile off, our Party was
near 2000 Foot, and 300 Horse, though we Landed not full a hundred Men, and all
these in the space of four days: About two Miles from Lime we espied the Duke
of Albermarle, with about 4000 Men, designing that Night to Quarter in the same
Town, which we had News of on the Way; yet we Marched on in good Order, and
came into the Town, lined all Hedges, Planted our Fieldpieces, and expected
nothing more than that we should give them Battle, they being not an English
Mile from the Town; they made toward us as soon as they heard that we were
there; but the Duke of Albemarle finding his Men to be all MILITIA-Men of the
County of Devonshire, and that they had no Stomach to fight against MONMOUTH,
Retreated, when he came within a quarter of an English Mile of the Town. He
came from Exon with these Forces, intending to lay a Siege against Lime,
presuming we could not be ready in so short a time; but finding us so well
prepared to receive him, he wisely Retired his Men, being in great Disorder and
Confusion, supposing we had pursued them, which was Debated; but the Duke said,
It was not his business to fight yet, till his Men had been a little
Disciplined, but rather to make up into the Country as fast as possible, to
meet his Friends, not questioning, but there would have been in several Parts
of the Kingdom some Action, on the News of his Success; but this in the end
proved fatal to us, for had we but followed them, we had had all their Arms,
several more Men, and might have Marched in two days with little or no
Opposition, to the very Gates of Exon, the County-Troops resolving not to fight
us; and several came to us that Night with their Arms. But missing this
Opportunity, we Marched on for Taunton, Lodging at several small Towns by the
way, which still received us as kindly as possible, and all the way met with
the loud Acclamations of the Country, Praying God to succeed our Arms:

Thursday we came to Taunton, about Twenty Mile from Lime. To give a particular
Account of our Reception here, would be too tedious; the Streets thronged with
People we could scarce enter, all endeavoring to manifest their Joy at his
coming, and their Houses, Doors, and Streets garnished with Green Boughs, Herbs
and Flowers, all the Emblems of Prosperity.

The next day, Twenty-six young Gentlewomen, Virgins with Colors ready made at
the charge of the Townsmen, presented them to his Grace; the Captain of them
went before with a Naked-Sword in one Hand, and a small curious Bible in the
other, which she presented also, making a short Speech, at which the Duke was
extremely satisfied, and he assured her, He came now in the Field, with a
Design to Defend the Truths contained therein, and to Seal it with his Blood,
if there should be any Occasion for it. Nothing now could content the Country,
but he must be Proclaimed KING, which he seemed exceeding averse to; and really
I am of Opinion, from his very Heart.

They said, The Reason why the Gentry of England moved not, was because he came
on a Common-Wealth-Principle; This being the Cry of all the Army, he was forced
to yield to it, and accordingly, Saturday Morning he was Proclaimed; In the
Afternoon came out Three PROCLAMATIONS, one setting a Sum of Money on the Kings
Head, as he had done before by the other. The Second, Declaring the Parliament
of England, A Seditious Assembly; and if they did not separate before the End
of June, to give Power and Authority to any that would attempt to lay hold of
them as Rebels and Traitors. The Third, To Declare the Duke of Albemarle a
Traitor, (who now lay within six Miles of us, having had time to Rally his Men)
if he laid not down his Arms; forthwith a Message also was sent to command him,
but he sent Word, That he was a Subject to JAMES the Second, the late King's
Brother, and that he knew no other Lord.

We tarried here till Sunday Morning, and then Marched for Bridge-Water, seven
Miles from thence: We were now between four and five thousand Men, and had we
not wanted Arms, could have made above ten thousand. We were received here as
in other Places, but did little more than Read our Declaration, which we did
also in all other Towns, the Magistrates standing by in their Gowns; and
likewise our Proclamations, and so Marched forward for Glassenbury, from
Glassenbury designed for Bristel, three days March from that place, designing
to Attacque it: Accordingly we Arrived at Canshum* Bridge, a little Town three
Miles English from Bristol, intending to enter next Morning, the Duke of
Beaufort being there with a Garrison of about Four Thousand Men, being here
lodged in the Town, we were on a sudden Alarmed with the Noise of the Approach
of the Enemy, being in no small Confusion on this unsuspected News: The Duke
sent one up the Tower to see whether he could discover them Marching, as soon
as he came up, he saw them at the very Entrance into the Town fighting with our
Men. Here we had a small Skirmish, our Men being in the Fields Adjoining to the
Town refreshing themselves; but it lasted not long, for before he could bring
Word, they were fled, being not above sixty Horsemen; they did us Mischief,
Killed and Wounded above Twenty Men, whereas we killed none of theirs, only
took four Prisoners and their Horses, and Wounded my Lord Newburg, that it was
thought Mortal; they came thither, thinking it had been their own Forces, and
had not our Undisciplined Fellows been a little too eager, and suffered them to
come a little farther on, they would have entered the Town, and we must have had
every Man of them; their Infantry was following, but on their Return came not
forward. These Forces being so near, and Bristol being so well Manned also, the
Duke was loath to pass the Bridge for Bristol, though some Gentlemen that came
over with us, and were Prescribed upon the Account of the former Plot, being
Bristol-Men, and knew the Hearts of the Townsmen, begged him heartily to
proceed toward it, offering themselves to go in the Head of them into the
Town, by some private Ways which they knew, assuring him, They would make no
Resistance, but could not persuade him; which had we been Possessors of, we
could not have wanted Money nor Arms, the only things needful for us in that
Juncture; for had we but had Arms, I am persuaded we had by this time, had in
the least Twenty Thousand Men; and it would not then have been difficult for us
to have Marched to London, with the Recruit of Bristol, the King not being able
to make 7000 Men for the gaining of so many Kingdoms. But God saw it not fit
for us, and overruled our Consultations to our own Ruin, for this was in the
top of our Prosperity; and yet all the while, not a Gentleman more than went
over with us came to our Assistance.

So we Marched on to Bath, we lay before* it in the Afternoon, and sent in our
Trumpeter to demand the Town, but they refused to give us entrance having a
strong Garrison, it being a stout People and a strong place. Having no mind to
spend time in laying Sieges, we marched on that day to a little Town called
Phillips-Norton, and there lay that night, being now Sunday the 26th of June,
Old-Style, Saturday Morning preparing for

From, we were drawing out our baggage for our march, and on a sudden were
alarmed with the appearance of the Enemy, who had entered the Town and had
lined all the Hedges and began to Fire on us; here began the briskest
Rencounter we yet had, and for an hour or more we had a brisk Skirmish, but at
last we beat them back, killing about thirty which lay in the place, and we
lost about ten in all, and a few Wounded; they retreating with their whole
Army, Pitched within a mile of the Town; and we went out also and pitched near
them, but out of Musket Shot, playing Cannon on one another for some hours;
they killed us but one Man all the while, but with ours we did great Execution,
having the advantage of the ground, so at last they Retreated, and I have been
told lost some hundreds of Men in the Battle, both killed and wounded: So we
marched on for From, a Town where we was as well beloved as at Taunton, where
we wanted for nothing but Arms, which were by a stratagem taken from them a few
days before our Entrance. Here came the unexpected News of Argyle's being
Defeated, and likewise of the advance of the King's Force from London with
considerable Bagage, and thirty Fieldpieces. This News, together with our want
of Money and Arms, not seeing which way to avoid these Forces, we were at a
stand, and not a little non-plus'd. 'Twas at last agreed on, that we that came
with the Duke should get good Horses that Night, and so for Pool, a little
Seaport Town not far off, where we were to seize a Ship, and set forth for
Holland again, leaving our Infantry to the Mercy of the Country.

This was much like that Resolution of the Hollanders in the time of the Civil
War with Spain, being as we then were, in despair of making better Terms, and
not daring to enter Salisbury Plain, because their Horse being so much better
then ours, their Men being all Disciplined, ours not, we could not Face them in
so plain and open a Country, so that we retreated backward, in the mean time
resolving to see what London would do, having a good an opportunity offered
them: The Soldiers being called forth, and not two thousand Men to be had for
their defense if they had but attempted any thing; this disheartened our Men,
and several of them coming home to their own Country, having felt by experience
the hardships of War, withdrew from us.

We came well back again to Bridgwater, and were received with wonted Love; we
arrived here on Friday the 3d. of July, and resolved here to Fortify so as to
hold our ground till we heard from London. Saturday in the Afternoon News was
brought of the Approach of the Kings Forces within a Mile and a half of the
Town where they had Encamped, the Duke went up into the Tower and there took a
view of them, and seeing them so careless, and their Horse at some distance
from the Army, in a little Town, the Infantry being in Sedge Moore. He called a
Council on it, and it was concluded on, that we should fall on them in the dead
of the Night, accordingly having a Guide to conduct us on in a private way, we
Marched out about Eleven of the Clock in the Night, and about one fell on them
in their Tents. There was a Ditch between us, and the Guide promised to conduct
them over an easy formable Place, but our Men seeing the Enemy just before
them, ran furiously on and lost the Guide, so that while they endeavored to
recover over that place the Enemy got on their Legs, and put themselves in
Order, and now began as fierce a Battle as perhaps ever was fought in England
in so short a time, our Foot fought as well as ever Foot fought, but not a
Horse came up; had our Horse but assisted, we must have beaten them out of the
Field. But our Horses would not stand at the noise of Drums and Guns, so that
we soon lost two of our Pieces of Ordinance, and we had but four in all, and
then but one more in the Field, our Foot flung most of their shot over, so that
the Men for the most part was killed in the Rear, and that run, but the Front
stood still, and had we done but as much Execution in the Front as we did in
the Rear, the day had been our own, but God would not have it, their time was
not then come: By this time their Horses came up, and having six or eight
hundred good disciplined Men, well Mounted and well Armed, ours neither; our
Foot having shot away all their Ammunition, and our Baggage being not then in
the Field, they were forced to Retreat, being all in Confusion.

Having no Money left, and our Party thus unexpectedly repulsed, the Duke seeing
he could not hold it any longer, Fled with my Lord Gray.

The Dukes Party was said to be about three thousand Foot, and a thousand
Horse; we had more, at least five thousand Men and Horse, but not well Armed,
yet in the Field. It Is said we lost not above three hundred, and they Foot; but
after when we were routed in our retreat lost a vast many more; tho they
pursued not in some hours after.

The most remarkable Persons that were taken in this total Rout, were Colonel
Holmes, Major Perrot, the Constable of Crookhorn, and Mr. Williams, Servant to
the late Duke of Monmouth.

After the Field was clear of the Dukes Men, the Earl of Feversham Marched with
five hundred Foot and a Party of Horse and Dragoons to Bridgwater, where he
found the Dukes Forces that were left there, fled and dispersed into several
Places: When his Lordship having left these Men in the Town, under the Command
of Colonel Kirk, and hearing the late Duke of Monmouth was fled with about
fifty Horse, the greatest number of the Dukes Men that were left together, he
sent out diverse Parties in pursuit of him and others that fled the Field. When
on the 7th of July, about five in the Morning, some of the Lord Lumly's Men
seized the Lord Gray and another Person near Holt-Lodge in Dorsetshire, four
miles from the West of Ringwood; and the said Lord Lumly making further inquiry
among the Cotts, was informed by one Anna Ferrant that two Men went over a
Hedge, proving to be the out bounds of many Enclosures, some of which were over
grown with Fern, others with Pease and Oats; but Guards being set upon the
Avenues, after diverse attempts to escape, the Brandenburgh, one of the Parties
observed to enter the Ground, was taken on the 8th day of July, about five in
the Morning, who confessing he departed from the late Duke of Monmouth about
one of the Clock that morning in the out-bounds, diligent search was made; when
about Eleven of the Clock the same morning he was found, by one Henry Parking,
hid in a Ditch, covered with Fern, who calling others to assist him, the said
late Duke was in the end Taken, and together with the Lord Gray, and the
Brandenburgh, with a strong Guard brought by easy Journeys to White Hall,
where they arrived on the 13th of July, and after some Examination were
committed to the Tower, when on Wednesday the 15th of July, the late Duke of
Monmouth, pursuant to a Warrant Signed for his Execution, upon his Attaindure
of High Treason, was delivered to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, about
Ten in the morning, and conducted to a Scaffold erected on Tower Hill, where
after about half an hours continuance, he laying down his Head, had it stricken
off by the Executioner, the which, together with his Body, being put into a
Coffin covered with Velvet, were carried away in a Velvet-covered Hearse, in
order to his Interment.

After the Duke was Beheaded, many Prisoners taken, and those that fled by
Parcels, taken up and down, were secured in diverse Goals, in order to their
Prosecution, as was said according to Law; which was the Occasion of this great
Man's showing his parts at that Degree as he did, no one else fit to be made a
Tool for such a Bloody Tragedy as he acted.

The Trials were deferred (for some time after the fatal Blow given to the Duke
of Monmouth on Tower Hill, which was the 15th of July following) because of my
Lords being at Tunbridge; but the latter end of August, he with a special
Commission of Oyer and Terminer, assisted with four other Judges, set forward
with a Party of Horse, and made by special Commission their General. The first
place he came at was Winchester, where were diverse Prisoners on Suspicion; but
here began the Tragedy, for the Lady Lisle was there Arraigned for
High Treason, in Harboring Mr. Hicks and Mr. Nelphrope, that had been concerned
with the Duke; the Lady being on Trial, the Jury were dissatisfied once and
again; but my Lords Threats and other Managery, so disposed the Jury, that at
last they brought the Lady in Guilty; on which he pronounced the Sentence of
Death on her, as usual in such Cases; but she had the favor of being Beheaded;
their other Prisoners were carried to Salisbury; and this was the most
remarkable thing at that Assizes.

From thence they set forward for Salisbury, where were many Prisoners that had
been picked up and down the Country, then in the Goal, the which, with those
that were brought from Winton, were ordered to be carried to Dorchester, there
not being Evidence enough to accomplish what was then designed by my Lord; so
that little of moment passed there, but to pursue the Matter proceeds from
thence to Dorchster, where he with his Assistants, Gown-Men and Swordmen,
Arrived on the 3d. of September, on which day being Thursday, the Commission
was Read. Friday Morning was an Excellent Sermon Preached before their
Lordships, by a worthy Divine, Chaplain to a worthy Person of that County, much
tending to Mercy: It was observed, that while my Lord Chief Justice was at
Church in Prayers, as well as at Sermon, he was seen to laugh, which was so
unbecoming a Person in his Character, that ought in so weighty an Affair as he
was then entering upon, to have been more serious, and have craved the Help and
Assistance of God Almighty.

The Sermon being over, their Lordships repaired to the Court, which by Order
of the Lord Chief Justice was hung with Red Cloth, a Color suitable to such a
succeeding bloody Tragedy, being accompanied by a Numerous Company of the
Gentry of that County, as well as the Flower of the Neighboring Counties of
Somerset and Devonshire, and then proceeded to give his Charge; in which
Charge, by reason of the Severity of his Sentiments, and Positions laid down to
make Discoveries of all such as were Abettors, Aidors or Assisters to the late
Duke of Monmouth, on Pain of High Treason, which was a great Surprise to all
the Auditors, and so vehemently Urged, and so passionately Expressed, as seemed
rather the Language of a Romish Inquifitor, than a Protestant Judge; and then
Adjourned until eight of the Clock next Morning, when was a Bill found against
Thirty Persons, charged for High Treason, for Aiding and Assisting the late
Duke of Monmouth; who put themselves on their Trials, notwithstanding my Lord's
threatening, That in Case any did put themselves on Trial, and the Country found
them Guilty, they should have but a little Time to live; and at the same time
Insinuated, That it were better to Plead Guilty, if they expected any Favor.

These Thirty being on Trial, the Evidences being Sworn and Examined before the
JVRY: Upon the whole, by the violent Deportment of the Lord Chief Justice, and
sharpness of the JVRY, they found Twenty-nine GUILTY, though some of them were
very hardly dealt with, and not so Criminal as my Lord and their Country
imagined. Particularly amongst the Twenty-nine, were Mr. Matthew Brag of
Thorncomb, and Joseph Speed of Culliton, in the County of Devonshire, and Mr.
Smith, Constable of Chardstock, in the said County; and George Seward, of
Culliton aforesaid: The Circumstances of each of these, and the severity of
their being found Guilty, etc. shall be showed in its proper place, before we
take leave of this Town, and proceed on in this Western Expedition.

The said Twenty-nine being found (as before) Guilty, my Lord immediately
pronounced Sentence of Death on them all, an usual in Cases of High Treason,
and did the same Night give a Warrant to the Sheriff, for the Execution of
thirteen of the twenty-nine on Monday following; which accordingly was done,
notwithstanding great Application was made to the Lord Chif-Justice by
Gentlemen of the best Quality, in this and the Neighboring Countries, for a
Reprieve of Mr. Bragg, to all which he was Deaf, and not to be prevailed upon;
though he was assured of his Honesty, and true Conformity to the Church of
England, yet it availed nothing. At last, it was only requested for ten days
Respite, yet that had no better Effect; but on Monday, he with twelve more of
that number, were accordingly Executed at Dorchester. The Christian like
Deportment, and other things, relating to the said Mr. Bragg and others, shall
be made out before we leave this Discourse.

In the mean time, this Proceeding was designed to shorten Business, and to
wheedle the rest that were to follow, to a Confession, which without it, the
tenth part of them could not be proved Guilty; a Method was also taken without
President, to entrap many poor Ignorant People, by a couple of Officers that
were sent into the Goal, to call over, and take the Names of the Prisoners; on
Promise, if they confessed, they might expect Mercy, otherwise not; which many
did. And this was Written so, that had they pleaded not Guilty, these two were
designed to have been Evidences against them from their own Confessions, which
so disposed the remaining great Numbers, that all, except a very few, Pleaded
Guilty, which put an end to any further Trial.

The only thing remaining* was the pronouncing of Sentence on them, which were
in Number 292. who received Sentence of Death all at once. One Mr. Laurence put
himself in Trial, but by the Jury found Guilty, whose Case was so hard, his
Circumstances being so small to be condemned to die; and had actually suffered,
had not Application been made to my Lords Favorites, and with the payment and
securing of 400 l. preserved him from Execution; his Case being so remarkable,
his Defense so honest, that we cannot pass it by in Silence: the particulars of
which, you shall have in its proper Place, with others that are most remarkable.

This Matter being Adjusted, and Execution Awarded to about Eighty, which were
Executed, and their Quarters sent up and down the Country to the dread of
their Spectators, as well as the Anoyance of the Travelers; his extraordinary
Whippings, though unmerciful, are not to be taken notice of; so we leave this
place, and proceed toward the City of Exon: In their way thither, lying at an
Honorable Gentleman's House, diverse of the Neighboring Parishes made their
Petitous to the Lord-Chief Justice in behalf of some Relations concerned; it
happened that through some Disorder amongst his Servants, some Pistols were fired
in the Night, which gave him a Suspicion, or at least he took it, of some
design upon him; on which at parting, said, Not a Man of all those Parishes
that were of that Vicinitude, if found Guilty, should escape. And so we proceed
and arrive at Exon, where to the number of 243 Prisoners being in Custody for
assisting the said Duke of Monmouth, one amongst the rest, Mr. Four Acers
Pleading not Guilty, he being found by the Jury, the said Lord Chief Justice
immediately pronounced the Sentence upon him, and immediate Execution, which
was done to terrify the rest, who all Pleaded Guilty; so that these
unfortunate People had not time to have the fairness of Trials allowed them,
which is a right due by the Laws of God and Man. The remaining number he all
condemned, and here was a little sparing; not so many ordered Execution as was
in the other County, but those that were Executed, were hung up and down in
most Towns of the County, and then* Quarters and Heads scattered up and down
their Highways and public places. An extraordinary Sentence of severe
Whipping was pronounced against Mr. Samuel Staple of Thorncomb in the said
County, which in its proper place, you shall have an account of the Crime; but
these are Trifles, and we shall endeavor to pursue our Design and make as
quick Dispatch as we can, that time may not be lost, the King served, and this
Miscreants thirst quenched with Protestant Blood, which is always well pleasing
to Inquisitors, and so proceed to the Town of Taunton. At which place being
Arrived, it was thought fit by the Lord Chief Justice to be as expeditious as
might be; so that late in the Afternoon the Court sat, where the Commission
being Read, he proceeded to give the Charge, which was so very keen and full of
sharp Invectives, as if the Country itself had not been able to make
Expiation to his Lordship, to quench his Thirst in the Blood of those that
ventured their all in Defense of the Protestant Religion; and here we enter
upon the bloodiest part of the Tragedy* In this Town, and at Wells in the said
County, were more than 500 Prisoners.

To begin at Taunton; the next Morning after the Charge given, the Assizes
began, where some few put themselves on Trial, who were found Guilty, and
immediately ordered to be Executed; of which number, one Mr. Simon Hamlin was
one, who was a zealous worthy good Man, and his Case no way dangerous; but on
the contrary, had he had to do with a Judge of another Stamp; his particular
Case you shall have before we conclude. To proceed to the rest, this first
Cruelty caused the rest to Plead Guilty in hopes of Favor, which was only a
few days to live, which those that Pleaded had not. Amongst these at Taunton
were diverse eminent Persons that had been taken in the West, and carried to
London, and brought down there to complete the Bloody Tragedy in those parts:
Mr. Parrot, Mr. Hewling the Elder, Mr. Lisle, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Hucker, and
diverse others were very Eminent. To take notice of every particular in this
Matter, will alter our Design, and swell the Book to too great a Bulk, being
only designed for a Pocket Companion, and useful it may be, to see the Cruelty
of men when in their Power, and how the Devil stirs up his Instruments, to
pursue those that adventure for the Cause of God and Religion. Here were in
this County Executed 239. the rest that were Condemned, were Transported,
except such as were able to furnish Coin, and that not a little, for an account
was taken of men's Abilities, according to which, the purchase for Life must be
managed by two of his Favorites, who had a small share, the rest went into his
Lordships Pocket; according to the Actions of Rome, where Sins of any kind may
be pardoned for money. This indeed was a glorious design in the Eye of Mother
Church, to Root out Heresy by Executions and Transportations, to make room for
a pack; here Expedition must be made to conclude at Wells* for that a great man
being fallen, our great Judge designing his Chair, which in short, he had as
the Reward of so Eminent and extraordinary a piece of Service as he did for
Advancement of the Roman Catholics* Intrest, which is cruel always where it
prevails.

Thus we leave the Town of Taunton, after awarding Execution to many there, and
their Quarters to be scattered up and down the County; and so we proceed to
Wells, where diverse Prisoners that had been carried from Goal to Goal, in
Expectation of Evidence against them, were in Carts removed to Wells; in which
place, to finish this Expedition, the same Method as was at the former Assizes,
was also taken here by a severe Charge, affronting the Gentlemen of this
County, as he had done in all the Counties before, terrifying the Juries (when
any Pleaded to make them to bring in the Persons Guilty; some of which being
overawed, and it is doubted, contrary to their Judgments, which if so, the
Lord forgive them.

Here were many Eminent and Worthy Persons that received the Sentence of Death,
but the Executions of the County being put together, as you have before seen,
we make no particular Division of the Number here, and the number at Taunton,
the whole being Recited before: We shall therefore endeavor to be as brief as
we can, to give you what we think Material, and truly matter of Fact; my Lord
now being come to conclude this extraordinary Commission* and in haste to be
Elevated, makes all manner of Dispatch to repair to the King then at Windsor,
to give an Account of his Transactions, and to receive the Reward of his
merritorious Service in this Butchering of Protestants, which is so acceptable
to his Holiness, and his Bigoted Disciples, as nothing can be more; and indeed
if you will believe them, a Work that merits Heaven at last, besides what
temporal Preferments are thought fit in this World. If this cruel Judge were a
true Protestant, his Case is much the more worse, being made use of as a Tool
to destroy, and carry on Popish Designs? Thus the Affairs being ended, the
Country filled with Heads and Quarters of those that were Executed, the rest
that had not wherewith to purchase their Lives, left in Custody in order to
Transportation; my Lord being come to the King to give an account of his
Affairs in the West, the great Seal being to be disposed of by the Death of the
late Keeper, he kissed the King's Hand for it, and was made Lord Chancellor,
which was only an earnest of his Desert for so eminent and extraordinary a
piece of Service, so now that which remains, is to give an Account of diverse
that had fled, and hid themselves up and down in Holes and Privacies, whose
Friends make all Application to some great Men or other to procure their
Pardons; some to this, and others to such as they thought Favorites of the
King; but the Rewards must be Assertained before any Application could be made:
Diverse Lists being sent up, and the Rewards Assertained, which amongst many of
them put together, did amount to considerable, so that it was now, who could
find a Friend to Relieve his Distressed Relations, which were forced to wander
up and down in Caves and Deserts, for fear of being taken; but this Misfortune
attended the Agents, that unless my Lord Chancellor were used, by his
Creatures, that were allowed by him so to do; other Applications commonly met
with Disappointments, which caused an Emulation amongst the great men; one
supposing to have deserved the Kings Ear as well as the other, which caused
other measures to be taken, though some were whedled out of their Money: At
last came out a general Pardon, with Exceptions, very few, if any of those that
were solicited for, not being Excepted, were of course Pardoned; but however,
diverse Sums of Money having been paid, no Restitution to be had, for from Hell
is no Redemption: A Worthy Western Gentleman, his purchase came to 15 or 16000
Guineas, which my Lord Chancellor had. Amongst the Exceptions, were a parcel
of Taunton Girls, some of which were Children of eight or ten years old,
however something was to be made of them, if these Ladies were Judged Guilty of
Treason for presenting the Duke of Monmouth with Colors, etc. and for to
preserve these from Trials, they were given to the Maids of Honor to make up
their Christmas Box; so that an Agent of theirs was sent down into the Country,
to compound with their Parents, to preserve them from what might after follow,
if taken, so, that some according to Ability, gave 100l. others 50l. all which,
however did not answer the Ladies first Expectations; yet it did satisfy, and
they were accordingly Pardoned: Thus we have given you an Account of what has
happened on this occasion, being in every point Truth: We might have farther
Enlarged, but that would have spoiled the Design, and swollen our Pocket
Companion to a Volumn too big.

We shall only according to our promise, give the particular Cases of some of
those that were Condemned and Executed; as also of some others that were most
eminent, of their Dying Words, and of their Christian-like behavior at the
place of Execution; which may serve as an encouragement to all true Protestants
to go on in their Christian Profession, and not to waver, God Almighty being
able to sweeten the Bitterest Sufferings, and will make good his Promise, Never
to leave nor forsake those that are his.

The Dying Speeches, and the Behavior of some of them, with the Circumstances
of their Cases, take as follows:
WE begin with Mr. Matthew Bragg, who was a Gentleman, and descended from an
Ancient and Good Family; he was bred an Attorney, in which he practiced the
Law, his Case being this; He happened to be upon the Road Riding Home to his
House, being come from a Gentleman's House for whom he kept Courts; he as
before, being met with by a Party of Horse belonging to the Duke of Monmouth,
who were going to search the House of a Roman* Catholic for Arms, who lived
two or three Miles from the place they met him, they required him to go with
them, and show them the way, he knowing the Country better than they did; he
desired to be excused, telling them, It was none of his Business, and besides
had no Arms; but his Excuses signified nothing, they forced him amongst them,
where they went, when being come, a Party entered the House and searched it; Mr.
Bragg never dismounted, they being then satisfied, took him along with them to
Chard, where then the Duke of Monmouth was; being there, after having set up
his Horse where he used to do, often having occasion there, he was much
tampered with to Engage in the Design, but he refused it; but the next Morning
made haste out of Town, not seeing the Duke at all; calling for his Horse, it
was told him, That it was seized for the Dukes Service; so then he took his
Cane and Gloves, and walked to his own House, which was about five or six
Miles, and was no more concerned in the Affair, than that after the Dukes
Defeat at Kings-Sedg-Moore, some busy Person informs and requires a Warrant
from a Justice of Peace for the said Mr. Bragg, who obliged him to enter into a
Recognizance to appear at the next Assizes, the said Justice accounting the
matter in it self but Trivial; and indeed all Men did judge him out of Danger.
At Dorchester he appeared in Court to discharge his Bayl, on which he was
presently Committed, and the next day being Arraigned, Pleading not Guilty, put
himself on the Trial of God and his Country, which found him and 28 more of
30, Guilty; the Lord-Chief-Justice often saying, If any Lawyer or Parson came
under his Inspection, they should not escape; the Evidence against him, was the
Roman Catholic, whose House was searched, and a Woman of Ill Fame, to whom the
Lord-Chief Justice was wonderful kind; but his Evidence which were more than
20, to prove his Innocence, signified nothing; the Jury being well instructed
by my Lord-Chief-Justice. Being thus found Guilty; Sentence was presently
Pronounced, and Execution awarded, notwithstanding all the Interest that was
made for him, as before Recited.

Thus being condemned Saturday, and ordered to be Executed Monday, he spent the
Residue of his little time very devoutly, and much becoming a good Christian
and a true Protestant of the Church of England, all which availed nothing with
this Protestant Judge: he was frequently visited by a worthy Divine of the
Church of England, who spent much time with him and received great Satisfaction
from him, the said Divine told me that his deportment, his behavior and
converse, was so much like an extraordinary Christian; that he could not in the
least doubt but this violent passage would put him into the fruition of
happiness: he wished and desired a little longer time out of no other design,
but thoroughly to repent him of his Sins, and make himself more sensible of and
fit for to receive the Inheritance that is prepared for those that continue in
well doing to the end; when he came to the place of Execution with great
Courage and Resolution, being as he said prepared for Death, he behaved himself
very gravely and devoutly, being asked when he was on the Ladder, whether he
was not sorry for his being concerned in the Rebellion? He replied, that he
knew of none that he was Guilty of, and prayed them not to trouble him, adding
he was not the first that was Martyred, he was so much a Christian as to
forgive his Enemies. And after some private Devotions he suddenly was
Translated, as we have all popes to believe, from Earth to Heaven; the only
savor of this Protestant Judge, was to give his Body to his Friends, in order
to it is Interment amongst his Ancest^^s.

The Behavior of Mr. Smith Constable of Chardstock.
ANother Eminent Person that suffered with him at the same time and place was
on* Mr. Smith, who was Constable of Chardstock, who having some moneys in his
hands that belonged to the Militia, which come to the knowledge of some of the
D's. Friends they obliged him to deliver it to them which he was forced to
deliver and for this was Indicted for High Treason, in assisting the D. of M.
To which he pleaded not Guilty, the Evidence against him were the same with
those that had been against Mr. Bragg, the said Mr. Smith Informed the Court
and the Jury, what little Credit ought to be given to the Evidence; the L. C.
J. thundered at him, saying thou Villain me thinks I see thee, already with a
Halter about thy Neck, thou Impudent Rebel to challenge these Evidences that
are for the King, to which the Prisoner replied very boldly, my Lord, I now see
which way I am going and right or wrong I must dye, but this I comfort my self
with, That Your Lordship can only destroy my Body; It is out of your Power to
touch my Soul. God forgive your Rashness, Pray my Lord, know it is not a small
matter you are about, the blood of Man is more precious than the whole World,
and then was stopped from Saying any more; the Evidences being heardveil strict
charge was given the Jury about him, (...), the Jury brought him in Guilty, so
that he with the rest received the Sentence of Death all together, and were
Executed on Monday; but by Particular order from my Lord he was ordered to be
first Executed, the day being come for Execution being Monday, he with a
Courage undaunted was brought to the Place, where with Christian Exhortations
to his Brethren that suffered with him, he was ordered to prepare, being the
first that was to be Executed, where he speak as follows, Christian Friends,
I am now as you see lanching into Eternity, so that it may be expected I should
speak something, before I leave this miserable World, and pass through those
Sufferings, which are dreadful to Flesh and Blood, which indeed shall be but
little, because I long to be before a just Judge; where I must give an account
not only for the occasion, of my Sufferings now, but for Sins long unrepented
of which indeed has brought me to this dismal place and shameful Death; and
truly dear Country Men having Ransaked my Soul, I cannot find my small concern
with the D. of M. does deserve this heavy Judgment on me, but I know as I said
before; It is for Sins long unrepented of, I dye in Charity with all Men, I
desire all of you to bear me witness, I dye a true Professor of the Church of
England; Beseeching the Lord still to stand up in the Defense of it, God
forgive my Passionate Judges, and cruel and hasty Jury, God forgive them they
know not what they have done, God bless the King; and though his Judges had no
mercy on me, I wish he may find mercy, when he stands most in need of it, make
him O Lord a Nursing Father to the Church, let mercy flow abundantly irom him,
if it be thy will to those poor Prisoners, to be hereafter tried; and Lord, if
it be thy holy will, stop this Issue of Christian Blood, and let my guiltless
Blood be the last spilt on this account. Gentlemen all farewell, farewell all the
things of the World, then Singing some few Verses of a Psalm, and putting up
some private Ejaculations to himself, said, O Lord into thy hands I commend my
Spirit, and so submitted to the Executioner, Sept. 7th. 85.

The Behavior and dying Speech of Mr. Joseph Speed of Culliton.
AT the same time and place, as he came near the place of execution he spying
his Country Man and Friend, called him and said I am glad to see you here now,
because I am not known in these parts; being answered by his Friend, I am sorry
to see you in this condition, he replies, it is the best day I ever saw, I
thank God I have not lead my Life as Unchristian like as many have done, having
since the years of 16 always had the checks of Conscience on me, which made me
to avoid many gross and grievous Sins, my course of Life has been well known
to you, yet I cannot justify my self, all Men err, I have not been the least
of Sinners, therefore cannot excuse my self, but since my confinement I have
received so great comfort, in some assurance of the Pardon of my Sins, that I
can now say, I am willing to dye to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, and
say to Death where is thy Sting, and to the Grave where is thy Victory* Being
asked by some rude Soldiers; whether he was not sorry for the Rebellion, he
was found Guilty of? he Couragosly replied, if you call it Rebellion, I can
assure you I had no sinister ends in being concerned, for my whole design in
taking up Arms under the D. of M* was to fight for the Protestant Religion,
which my own conscience dictated me to, and which the said D. declared for, and
had I think a lawful Call and Warrant for so doing, and do not question that if
I have committed any Sin in it, but that it is pardoned* pray Mr. Sheriff let
me be troubled no farther in answering of questions, but give me leave to
prepare my self, (those few muintes I have left) for another World, and go to
my Jesus; who is ready to receive me, then calling to his Friend who stood very
near him, said my dear Friend you know I have a dear Wife and Children, who
will find me wanting being somewhat encumbered in the World, let me desire you
as a dying Man to see that she be not abused, and as for my poor Children, I
hope the Father of Heaven will take care for them, and give them grace to be
dutiful to their distressed Mother, and so with my dying Love to all my
Friends, when you see them, I take leave of you and them and all the World,
desiring your Christian Prayers for me to the last moment, then repeating some
Sentences of Scripture, as Collossians Chap. 3. verse. 1, 2. If your then, etc.
and Praying very fervently for a quarter of an hour said, I thank God I have
Satisfaction; I am ready and willing to suffer shame for his name, and so
powering forth some private Ejaculations to himself and lifting up his hands,
the Executioner did his Office: The Soldiers then present said they never
before were so taken with a dying Man's Speech, his courage and Christian-like
Resolution, caused many violent Men against the Prisoners, to repent of their
Tyranny, toward them; some of whom in a short time dyed full of horror, and
thus fell this good Man, a true Protestant and one that held out to the end.

An Account of those that suffered at Bridport and Lime.
AT Bridport one John Sprake, who was a very good Man, and behaved himself with
a great deal of Christian-like Courage to the End; His Speech and his
Devotions, etc. must be omitted, not being possible to take them, by reason of
the rudeness, etc. and the shortness of the time allowed them by the Soldiers.

Next Place was Lime, where many of Note dyed: Particularly, Coll. Holmes, who
was the first of those there executed, near the same Place where they Landed,
when they came ashore with the D. of M. being brought to the Place of Execution
after some difficulty; for the Horses that were first put into the Sled would
not stir, which obliged those concerned to get others, which they did from the
Coachman, who had that Morning brought them to Town; when they were put into
the Seld, they broke it in pieces, which caused the Prisoners to go on foot to
the Place of execution; where being come, as I told you before, the Coll. began
thus at the Foot of the Ladder, he sat down with an Aspect altogether void of
Fear; but on the contrary with a kind of a smiling countenance, so began to
speak to the Spectators, to this purpose, That he would give them an Account of
his first Undertaking in the design, which was long before in London, for there
he agreed to stand by and assist the D. of M. when opportunity offered, in
order to which, he went to Holland with him, and there continued, until this
Expedition, in which God had thought fit to frustrate his and other good Men's
Expectations; He believed, the Protestant Religion was bleeding, and in a step
toward Extirpation, and therefore he with these his Brethren, that were to
suffer with him, and Thousands more had adventured their Lives and their All
for to save it; but God Almighty had not appointed them to be the Instruments
in so glorious a Work, yet notwithstanding he did verily believe and doubted
not, but that God would make use of others, that should meet with better
success, though the way or means was not yet visible, but of this he did not
doubt; he also was satisfied of the D's Title, so that matter did not afflict
him on account of this engaging on his Score, and going on further with
Discourse of this Nature, he was asked by a Person, why he did not pray for the
King? He with a smiling countenance, answered, I am sorry you do not yet
understand the difference between Speaking and Praying; and having ended his
Discourse, he then prepared himself by Prayer for his Dissolution, which was
very devout and pious for half an hour; but in it not mentioning the Name of
the King, was charged as before, to which he replied, as he was a man, he
prayed for him in General, praying for All mankind.

After having ended his Prayer, he took occasion to speak to his suffering
Brethren, taking a solemn leave of them, encouraging them to hold out to the
end, and not to waver observing that this being a Glorious Sun Shining day, I
doubt not though our Breakfast be sharp and bitter, it will prepare us, and
make us meet for a comfortable Supper, with our God and Savior, where all Sin
and sorrow shall be wiped away, so embracing each of them, and kissing of them,
told, the Sheriff, you see I am imperfect only one Arm, I shall want Assistance
to help me upon this Tragical Stage, which was presently done, and Execution
suddenly followed, after which followed Mr. Sampson Lark, who was a very
eminent pious Man, and had lived in that Town* but little before* many Years,
he was there well acquainted* and all People that knew him had a value for him,
behaving himself with that Humility and Circumspection as no body could have
any other occasion but, to value him, he designed to have spoken somewhat on a
portion of Scripture, and was beginning, having mentioned the place he intended
to speak upon, but was interrupted and told, the work of the day being great,
they should want time. So then he stopped and replied, he could make application
where he should not meet with interuption, and so applied himself to Prayer,
which he performed with great Devotion and Zeal, for a quarter of an hour to
the great satisfaction of the Auditors, and so taking leave of his suffering
Brethren, he mounted the Stage, which was to be the last Act he made in this
World, being on the Ladder he saw some of his Friends and Neighbors, weeping
and mourning for him, to whom he spoke, pray weep not for me, I am going to a
place of Bliss and Happiness, wherefore pray repair to your Houses, and 'ere
you get thither, I doubt not, but I shall be happy with my God and Savior,
where all tears shall be wiped away, and nothing shall remain but Hallelujahs
to all Eternity.

There was also Mr. William Hewling of London, a young Gentleman under twenty,
who came over with the D. of M. he seemed to be in a calm, and composed frame
of Spirit, and with a great deal of Courage and Seriousness, he behaved
himself; there is already something said of his converse and discourse, which
amongst others is Printed; therefore we shall say nothing more of him, but that
in all manner of Appearance he dyed a good Christian, true Protestant, and
doubtless now enjoys the benefit of it: there were several worthy Men more
there Executed, viz. Mr, Christopher Battiscombe, Dr. Temple, Captain Madders,
Captain Mathews, Captain Kid, etc. in all twelve, who all of them dyed with
that Courage and Resolution as became Christians, and such who eminently had
adventured their Lives and Fortunes, in defense of what was most dear to them,
and namely our Religion, which though God did not think those fit to defend and
secure it yet in his infinite wisdom, we hope it will be in some measure
secured by other Instruments, the Glory of the same being only due to him. So
that now leaving this Place, we proceed to other parts of the Country, where
with the like Butchery were only five Executed, amongst which was one M. Tyler
of Bristol, who had had Command in the Dukes Army, where he behaved himself
very stoutly to the last, after the Army was dispersed, he amongst others were
taken, received Sentence of Death at Dorchester, and here brought for the
Completion of the same, and from hence we hope was Translated to Heaven; -- he
spent his time between the Sentence and Execution very devoutly, in confirming
and strengthening those that were to be his fellow Sufferers. And made it his
business, to bring them to a willingness to submit to, and a preparedness for,
Death; The day being come and he brought to the Place of Execution, he thus
spoke, -- my Friends you see I am now on the brink of Eternity, and in a few
minutes, shall be but Clay, you expect I should say something, as is usual in
such cases; as to the matter of fact I dye for, it does not much trouble me,
knowing to my self the ends for which I engaged with the D. of M. were both
good and honorable; here being stopped, and not suffered to proceed farther; he
then comforted his fellow sufferers, desiring them to join with him in Singing
a Hymn, which he himself composed for the occasion as follows.

1.
O Lord how Glorious is thy Grace,
And wondrous large thy Love;
At such a dreadful time and place,
To such as Faithful prove.
2.
If thou will have thy Glory hence;
Though a shameful death we dye,
We Bless thee for this Providence,
To all Eternity.
3.
Let these Spectators see thy Grace,
In thy Poor Servants shine;
While we by Faith behold thy Face,
In that blessed Son of thine.
4.
Though Men our Bodies may abuse,
Christ take our Souls to rest:
Till he brings forth the joyful news,
Ye are my Fathers blessed.
5.
Appear for those that plead thy Cause,
Preserve them in the way,
Who own King Jesus, and his Laws,
And dare not but obey.
6.
O God confound our cruel Foes,
Let Babylon come down;
Let England's King be one of them,
Shall raze her to the Ground.
7.
Through Christ we yield our Souls to thee,
Accept us on his Score;
That where he is there we may be,
To Praise thee ever more.
After the Hymn Sung* he Prayed devoutly, for half an hour; after Prayer he
gave great satisfaction to all present of his Assurance of Heaven, had many
weeping Eyes for him, and was much lamented in the Town, tho a stranger to the
place, so unbuttoning himself, said to the Executioner, I fear not what Man can
do unto me; I pray thee do thy work in mercy, for I forgive thee with all my
Heart, and I also pray to God for to forgive thee, don't mangle my Body too
much, and so lifting up his hands to Heaven, the Executioner did his Office,
there was also one William Cox, that dyed with him, who also dyed very
courageously despising the shame, in hopes and expectation of a future better
Estate; he and his two Sons were some of the first that came to the D. of M.
and all taken and all condemned together, the Father only suffered, the Sons by
providence were preserved; -- when he was going to Execution he desired leave
to see his Sons, then in another Prison in the Town, to whom he gave his
Blessing, and though he was going to be Executed, yet had that satisfaction to
hope that God would preserve them which was so.

An Account of those Executed at Sherborn.
AT Sherbon, in the same County were Executed twelve, who all dyed
Courageously, especially one Mr. Glisson of Yeovel, in the County of Somerset,
his extraordinary deportment and carriage at the Place of Execution, was so
very considerable, as gave great satisfaction to his Friends, and Amazement to
his Enemies; he declared to the World, that he dyed a true Protestant, and had
not engaged with the D. of M. but Judged it high time to stand up for the
Defense of the same, though God Almighty had thought fit, to frustrate his
designs and to bring him to that Place, to Seal the same with his Blood; also
John Savage and Richard Hall of Culliton, in the County of Devon, suffered at
the same time and Place in their particular Conversation, they valued most
those that they saw most of Piety in, and pittyed others that they saw not so
well prepared, saying that the remembrance of our vanity, may cause compassion
toward such as were in such a Condition, exhorting all to be serious and to
consider their latter end, which deserved the greatest attention of mind, the
way to dye comfortably being to prepare for it seriously, and if God should
miraculously preserve us from this Death now before our Eyes; It should be the
duty of us all to spend the remaining part of our time, in such a manner as now
when we see death just at the Door* At the hour of Execution, their
cheerfulness and comfort was much increased, saying now the will of God will be
done, and he has most certainly chosen that for us which is best, with many
other such like Christian expressions, too tedious here to be inserted, because
we design to keep to our first intentions, and not to swell this Treatise too
big. Upon the whole, after they had with much earnestness, recommended their
Souls to the all wise God by Prayer, they all with much content and
satisfaction, submitted themselves to the Executioner, not doubting of a happy
Translation, and accordingly were Executed and quartered; before the rest of
the Executions in this County, as at Weymouth, Pool* Shafton, Wimborne, etc.
Not being there, we shall pass over, and only give you particular touches,
which we saw to our perfect knowledge, and so we return to Culliton, in the
County of Devon* where John Sprague, and William Clegg, both of that Town were
condemded at Exon, and there brought to be Executed; before thy were brought
into the place, a Messenger came from the Prisoners, with a Request to the
Vicar of the Parish, to desire his company and Assistance in this their
extremity, and to Administer those Spiritual helps, that were suitable to Men,
in their Circumstances; accordingly the said Minister came very readily, and
did demand of them what they had to desire of him, the dying Persons answered,
they desired his Prayers, accordingly he prayed with them a considerable space
of time; And after which he asked of them several questions, for to give him
and the World satisfaction of the prepared condition they were in, in order to
their lanching into Eternity; especially about the Doctrine of non-resistance;
-- John Sprague, very soberly and moderately replied, but whether satisfactory
or not, we leave to the Reader, he believed that no Christian ought to resist a
lawful Power, but the case being between Popery and Protestantism, altered the
matter; and the latter being in danger, he believed that it was lawful for him
to do what he did, though God in his Providence had thought fit to bring him to
this place of Execution. After Reading a Chapter out of the Corinthians, and
Singing a Psalm suitable to the occasion, he very vehemently and fervently
recommended his Soul to the all-wise God by Prayer, for near half an hour to
the great satisfaction of all that heard him; then his Wife and Children coming
to him weeping bitterly, he embraced them in his Arms, saying, weep not for me;
but weep for your selves and for your Sins, for that he had that quiet
satisfaction, that he was only going to be Translated into a state of Bliss and
Happiness; where he should sin and sorrow no more; but that all Tears should be
wiped away, wishing them to be diligent in the Service of God, then recommended
his Wife and Children, to the protection of the Almighty God, who had promised
to be a Husband to the Widow, and a Father to the Fatherless, who was faithful
and able to make up their loss in him, in that which should be better for them,
then he could be, desiring God to be a Refuge for them to fly to for security,
and preservation from the troubles that seemed to threaten this poor Nation;
the which if they did conscientiously perform, though death here made a
separation, he doubted not of meeting them in Heaven at last, and so the
Executioner did his Office, during which time his Brother-sufferer, William
Cleg was all the time on his Knees, Praying to himself, with a seeming Zeal,
suddenly after which his turn being come to follow his Brother, he only told
the People that his fellow-suffer, had spoken what he thought was necessary,
and they were also his sentiments, and so submitted to Execution.

An Account of those Executed at Axminster and Honiton.
AT Axminster one also was Executed, his Name Mr. Rose he was a Gunner, that
Landed with the D. of M. he had a great Resolution, and not at all started with
the fear of Death, he said, that he defied death and all them that were the
occasion of it, He was very courageous and dyed so; he spent some time in
private Prayer, and was not allowed time because there was to be Execution at
Honiton; so that his Execution being over, we past on to Honiton, where were
four Executed, one of which was a Chyrurgeon, his Name if I do not mistake, was
Mr. Pott who behaved himself with that extraordinary Christian Courage, that
all the Spectators were almost astonished: he being but young about twenty, his
Prayers being fervent, his Expressions so pithy, and so becoming a Christian of
greater Age, that drew pity and compassion from all present; a rude Fellow,
just before he was to be Executed, called for a Bottle of Wine, and so began
the Kings health to one of the Guard; which he perceiving, poor Soul said he,
Your Cup seems to be sweet to you, and you think mine is bitter, which indeed
is so to Flesh and Blood, but yet I have that assurance of the fruition of a
future Estate, that I doubt not but this bitter Potion will be sweetn'd with
the Sugar of the loving kindness of my dearest Savior, that I shall be
translated into such a State, where is fullness of Joy and Pleasure for evermore.

Before I conclude one Mr. Evans a Minister ought not to be omitted, who did
all along in the time of his confinement in Prison, behave himself with that
Devotion and Strictness, that became a Christian of great eminency, as indeed
he was; he spent much of his time in Preaching and Praying to his fellow
Prisoners, exhorting them to hold out to the end; he at last by appointment
being Condemned, was Executed by himself, at which time and place he behaved
himself with great Courage and Devotion, and with a great willingness and
cheerfulness, he submitted to Execution, there might have been much more said
of this worthy Man; but because we will keep to our design shall be omitted;
many others, which were also very eminent that suffered in this County for
asserting and endeavoring to secure the Protestant Religion, might deservedly
have a share in this small Treatise, but having resolved this for brevity,
according as it meets with reception, so it may give encouragement for
Addition, else must stand as now it is.

The Case of Mr. Simon Hamling.
THus having finished what we have to say at present shall only add the Case of
one Mr. Simon Hamling at Taunton, to show that sometimes Innocence will not
protect: Mr. Hamling was formerly an Inhabitant of the place, but of late years
had lived 2 or 3 miles from thence; he was a very honest, worthy, good
Christian, but was a Dissenter, and indeed in the Judgment of some fiery Men,
that might be Crime enough, as did too sadly appear in diverse Cases; but to our
purpose; Mr. Hamling living in the Country, hearing of the D. of M. being in
Town, he there came to speak with his Son, who lived in that place, where being
come he gave him advice, which was that as he expected his Blessing and
Countenance, he should not at all concern himself in the matter, but submit to
the Will of God in all things, and having thus advised his Son, he returns
home, and two days after came again to Town, on a Market day, with his Wife to
buy Provisions for his Family, and returned to his house again, and this was
all the times he was in Town, whiles the D. was there but after the business
was over, he was brought in on suspicion, being a Dissenter, that was Crime
enough, except Coin appeared to a Justice of that Town, who usually did commit
or dismiss as that appeared; this Man was arraigned at Taunton, pleaded not
guilty; the matter above is the Truth of this Case, the Evidences were two
proffligate Rascals, that had Encouragement from the Justice, they usually
doing what he put them on; the Prisoner had many to prove this Fact and his
Honesty; but this did not avail, the Jury found him guilty, with two more, who
were presently sentenced, and next Morning executed for to be Examples to
others. It is said that the Justice did make application to our famous
Protestant Judge, and hinted some mistake concerning him; to which as I have
been informed, he should Reply, you have brought him on, if he be innocent, his
blood be upon you, which was a very fine Reply from a merciful Judge, but
nothing else could be expected, as the whole Treatise evinceth. The tender
Mercies of the wicked being cruel; this Man behaved himself very worthily at
the place of execution, and did at the last declare, his crime to be the same
as is above mentioned, and not otherwise, There was one Mr. Gatchett executed
with him, his crime being a Constable of the Hundred, he was surprised by a
Party of the Ds. and showed a Warrant to bring in Provisions and other
necessaries for the use of the Army, which if he had not obeyed, was threatened
to have his House burnt, etc. So that he was obliged to do what he did for his
own preservation, but this was not sufficient; for being found guilty was also
executed at the same time and place.

The Case of Mr. Tho. Lawrence.
MR. Tho. Lawrence at Dorchester had also very hard measure, he had the
managing of an Estate belonging to a Person of Quality, who had a Barn in the
Parish of Lime, where the D. Landed; the day after his Landing a Party came and
took away Three Horses from off this Estate, which he having the Trust and Care
of makes application to the D. for them, adding that he ought not to suffer any
of his Masters Goods to be wanting, but must endeavor to Recover them again,
so moved hard to the D* for the Horses, but all would not prevail, but at last
had one, and was forced to leave two; this was looked on as an abetting, being
judged to be by consent, after the defeat was given, he was had before a
Justice of the Peace, who bound him over to the Assizes, where appearing, he
was committed, pleaded not guilty on his Trial, which he pleaded to very
honestly, yet was found guilty and sentenced to dye; my Lord was excellent at
Improvement, 'twas thought he would, if possible, have brought in the
Gentleman, that owned the Estate, who was very Rich; this honest Mr. Lawrence
was to be sacrificed, and his Execution ordered to be at Warham; but my Lord's
Favorite got a Reprieve for him by the help of 400. l. 200. l. being actually
paid, the other secured by Bond.

I promised before I conclude, to give some Account of the barbarous and cruel
whippings, which were executed on many good, honest and sufficient Persons,
both men and women in the Countries of Dorset. Devon. and Somerset, by the
severe and cruel Sentence of the L. C. J. some for such small Crimes, as an
impartial man may judge, they deserved no punishment at all; more especially
one Mr. Stayle of Thorncomb in Devonshire, his Sufferings were so hard, that it
caused many to pity him, he was a good Liver, well beloved among his
Neighbors, and a true Protestant, also one Mrs. Brown of Lime, suffered very
dear in that nature, she only joykingly said, unto the Officer of the Excise, I
will pay my Excise to K. Monmouth, which being sworn before this severe Judge,
she was found guilty of a misdemeanor, was sentenced to be whipped in several
Market Towns, which accordingly was done, but this Cruelty was not only
extended to those of riper y^ars and able better to endure those painful
Sufferings, but even to Children; A poor boy of Weymouth in the County of
Dorset, having got some Pamplet, relating somewhat to satisfy the People, that
the D. of Monmouth came to secure the Protestant Religion, had the hard fortune
to take his Trial before this harsh Judge, I think he was about ten or twelve
years of Age, had the Flesh of his Back so cut with the whipping, that I heard
he dyed with the same, but whether he is dead or not, never was such cruelty in
all this World: And now we may see how just the Lord is, he that all that time
had no Mercy for any, but those that appeared loose Villains, is pittyed but by
few: Now I come to give you an Account of the Number executed; the Towns and
Places where, and so shall conclude.

Some Remarkable Passages, with the Dving Prayers of many Eminent Persons who
suffered in the West under the cruel Sentence of the late Lord Chancellor, then
Lord Chief Justice Jefferys* and the most remarkable Circumstances that
Attended their Execution, An Account of the behavior of Coll. Holmes in Lyme,
and at the place of his Execution. And his last Prayer.
HE with Eleaven more were brought from Dorchester to Lyme six in a Coach, and
six in a Cart, as he was drawn through the Town, he cheerfully beholding the
People, advised them not to be discouraged, at their severe Deaths, for that
though it was their hard fortunes to loose the day, in so good a Cause, yet he
questioned not but it would be Revived again, and by such means as he nor they
could not imagine, God I hope and trust will never let this Nation to fall into
Popery, being brought to the Inn, where they stoped, near two hours, until the
Butchers had prepared every thing ready for the slaughter, they were visited by
a very worthy Divine, and Vicar of that Town, who offered them those spiritual
helps, usually in those Occasions, which some of them Embraced, and others not;
their Principles being Different from the Church of England: The Jailer
speaking to Coll Holmes to knock off his Irons, he said, Great Men of State
wear Chains, and it is accounted for their honor, but though there is a vast
difference, betwixt those Golden ones and mine, yet I take mine to be more
Honorable, as that good Apostle said, he accounted it an honor to suffer
shame for his Masters Name, the Sledge being in readiness they prepared to
enter it; but Alas! who should draw such Men to Execution though Men were so
bloody, the very Beasts refused to draw them; and instead of going forward they
went backwards, and could by no means, make them do it, which so enraged some
Persons, that they took the Coach Horses out of the Coach* and placed them to
the Sledge; but presently the Sledge broke in pieces; then spoke this worthy
good Man: Pray Gentlemen you see all your strivings will not do, to draw us to
Execution, I verily believe there is more in it then you are aware of, pray
read about the Prophet, that went out of Gods way, his Beast saw that he could
not.

Give us leave and we will walk to the place; Being there come the Coll.
prepared first to mount that Tragical Stage, the heads of his Speech you have
before, therefore his Prayer take as follows,

Coll. Holme's Last Prayer.
MOst Glorious, most great, and most merciful God, there is none in Heaven nor
in Earth that is like unto thee, Heaven is thy Throne, and the Earth is thy
footstool, who shall say unto thee, what do thou? here we are poor
deplorable Creatures come to offer up our last Prayers, and Services unto thee*
we beseech thy favorable Ear to our Prayers, and the comfort of thy holy
Spirit, at this time, we praise and magnify thy name, for all the
dispensations of thy providence toward us, especially for this thy providence,
in bringing us to this place and at this time, to suffer shame for thy Name;
help and assist all of us to submit to thy will patiently. Pardon all our Sins*
remove them out of thy presence as far as the East is from the West, and accept
of us in the merits of thy Son Jesus Christ, thou who art the searcher of
hearts, and tryer of Reins let there not at the moment of death be the least
spark of Sin indwelling in us, nor the strivings of Flesh and Blood, that may
hinder us from a joyful passage unto thee, give us patience also under these
sufferings and a deliverance to all others from undergoing them, and in thy
good time work deliverance for poor England, let thy Gospel yet flourish amongst
them, hasten the downfall of Antichrist, we trust the time is near come;
prevent O Lord this effusion of Christian Blood, and if it be thy will, let
this be the last; Lord bless this Town, let them from the highest to the lowest
set the fear of God before their Eyes; Bless all sorts and Conditions of Men in
all Ranks and Qualities, pardon all their Sins, give them all true Repentance,
and the Grace of thy holy Spirit, fit and prepare us for the cheerful
fulfilling of thy holy will, let the Comforter be still with us, be merciful to
all our Friends and Relations and Acquaintance, forgive our Enemies, accept of
our thankfulness, for all the Mercies and favors afforded us, and hear and
graciously answer us, in these our Requests, and whar else thou know needful
and expedient for us, and all for our Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ his sake;
who Dyed for us, that we might Reign with him for ever and ever, to whom with
thee and thy Blessed Spirit of Grace be ascribed, as is most due, all honor,
glory and Praise both now and for ever, after which, embracing his Fellow
sufferers, and kissing them and giving them some ghostly Comforts, he desired
help of the Sheriff to go up the Ladder, having but one Arm, and the Gallows
higher then ordinary, which was granted: And in a short time after the
Executioner did his Office; thus fell, the valiant and good Christian C^ll*
Holmes, his dying Words, we have now found come to pass, he was much lamented
by all that saw him, except by some, that it is feared, are delivered up to a
feared Conscience.

Mr. Christopher Batiscombe, his last Speech and Prayer imediately before he
suffered at Lyme 12th of September. 168^.
HE was well known to be a Gentleman, and of a good Estate in Dorchester shire,
and a true Protestant, well beloved among the Gentry of that Country; It was
his fortune to be concerned with the D. M. and was very faithful to him to the
last, during the time of the Bloody Assizes at Dorchester, where he received
his Sentence of death, was diverse times sent for to the Chamber of the then L.
C. J. and promoted with offers of Life to betray some Gentlemen, which he
refused saying, he scorned to purchase his Life by such indirect means; and he
accordingly chose death rather then Life; seeing it could not be purchased, but
by such unworthy means. The day being come he prepared himself, and received
the Holy Sacrament, walking down to the Place of Execution, with much
cheerfulness and Christian Courage, when he was mounting the Ladder, smiled,
and said, I am not afraid of this, I am going to a better Place, from a poor
and miserable World, to a Celestial Paradise, a Heavenly Jerusalem; I might
have chosen; whether I would have undergone this Death, if I had hearkened to
the L. C. J. but it was upon such unworthy terms, that should I have accepted
of my Pardon, it would have been troublesome to me; I dye a true Protestant, I
am in Charity with all Men, God preserve this Nation from Popery, the Lord
bless you all; so taking his leave of them, he knew, after Prayer, he lanched
into Eternity.

Some Passages Relating to Mr. Sampson Lark with his Prayer, at the same time
and place when Executed.
IMmediately after Col. Holmes was Executed; this good Man was ordered to
prepare to follow* accordingly going to deliver some few Words to the People,
some whereof were formerly of his Congregation, but being told, he could not
expect much time; because it was so late, and so many to be Executed after him,
so he suddenly concluded, and said, I will now speak a few Words to him which I
am sure will hear me, and so began his Prayer, as follows,

Blessed Lord God, we thine unworthy Creatures, now here before thee cannot but
acknowledge from the bottom of our Hearts our own unworthiness, we must confess
we have been grievous Sinners and have brought forth the Evil Fruit of it in
our Lives, to the great dishonor of thy Name, for which we have deserved thy
heavy wrath and indignation to be powered forth upon us, not only in this Life,
but in that which is to come.

O let us bless God for our Sufferings and Afflictions, as for our Mercies, we
bless thee in particular for this, O sanctify it to us, let us be effectually
convinced of the vanity of the World, and of our own sinfulness by Nature and
Practice, and to see that to be Sin which we never saw before; O Lord make us
sensible of the absolute Necessity of the Righteousness of Christ to justify
us, and let him be now made much more dear and precious to our Souls than ever,
that so we may be wrought into a more* Heavenly Frame, and raised to a higher
degree of Spirituality, and so made more meek and humble, and let us judge
Charitably of others, that differ from us in Opinion and Judgment; and now O
Lord, though by thy most righteous Judgment, we most justly deserve these
sufferings, and such an ignominious death, for our Sins, against thee, not for
Treasons against the Kingdom, let us be in a preparedness for it: Pardon all
our Sins, help us quietly to submit to thy holy will, speak peace to all our
Souls, look in mercy O Lord, on this poor Nation, especially on this Town, and
every particular Person in it, let them all mind those things which concerns
their peace before they are hid from their Eyes, comfort my dear and distressed
Wife, be a Husband unto her, deliver her out of the Paw of the Lion, and the
Paws of the Bear, look upon all thy poor afflicted ones, all Prisoners and
Captives, work deliverance for them if thou see it good, but thy will be done
in Earth as it is in Heaven, and now Lord with humble meekness and submission I
submit to thy will, depending upon the merits of my Savior, to whom with thy
blessed self and Spirit be ascribed all Honor and praise both now and for
ever. Amen.

Then mounting the Ladder, he called to some of the Town who weeped for him,
but were at some distance, go home to your own Houses, pray do not weep for me,
and before you get up yonder Hill, I shall be with my Heavenly Father, in
fullness of Joy and Pleasure for ever more, and so advising those before him to
leave off those cruel Sentiments they had taken of them, besides some Heavenly
discourses with some of his Friends, was turned off to the great grief of the
good People in the Town, especially those of his own Congregation. To give him
nothing but his due, he was a man- mighty charitable, relieving and visiting
the poor and needy, Preached in season and out of season* and made it his
business to no about doing good, and to put poor Souls in a way for Eternal
Life, he was an old Christian, as well as aged in Years* he was a general loss.

Especially to his dear and tender Wife, but all our losses are nothing to be
compared to that Glory that he now enjoys.

FINIS.
Capt. Madders last Prayer at the same time and place.
CApt. Madders at the time of the Duke's Landing was a Constable at Crewkern,
in the County of Somerset; and so diligent and active for the King in his
Office, that when two Gentlemen of Lyme came there, and brought the News of the
Duke's Landing, and desired Horses to ride Post, to acquaint his Majesty
therewith, he immediately secured Horses for them, the Town being generally
otherways bent, and assisted them so far as any called Loyal in those times
could do, which was represented to the Lord Chief Justice, in expectation
thereby to save his Life; but an Enquiry being made about his Religion, and
returned by a very worthy Gentleman of those Parts, That he was a good
Protestant, an honest Man, had a very good Character amongst his Neighbors; O
then, says he, I Will hold a wager with you he is a Presbyterian, I can smell
them forty miles; though moderately I now say, they can smell him two hundred
Miles West; then surely he must dye, because he was, and had the Character of
an honest Man, a good Christian, and a brave Tradesman. But to be short, I
could say a great deal more of him, being intimately acquainted with him, and
was with him to the very last: being brought to the Place of Execution, he was
the last Man except one executed, and he behaved himself, whilst the rest were
Executing, with great Zeal; and lifting up his hands and eyes, would often say,
Lord, make me so willing and ready to the last: And God did hear his Prayers;
for though he seemed to the Spectators to be somewhat unwilling to dye, yet at
the last he dyed with as much Assurance and Christian Resolution as any; for
after his public Prayer, he came once down the Ladder, and Prayed again
privately, then mounted the Ladder again, the Sheriff saying, Mr. Madders, If
you please, you may have more liberty; he answered, No, I thank you Mr.
Sheriff, now I am ready, I am willing, and desire to be dissolved, and to be
with Christ: Oh! you cannot imagine what Comfort and Refreshment I have
received in a few minutes; my Comforts are so great that I cannot contain my
self: So blessing and praising of God, he was translated, as I hope (we have no
grounds to imagine the contrary) from Earth to Heaven, repeating Revel. 20. 6.
Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first Resurrection, on such the
second Death has no power. His public Prayer was as follows.

O Eternal and ever blessed Lord God, look down upon me a miserable Sinner with
an eye of pity and compassion, in and through my dear Redeemer, the Lord Jesus
Christ. O Lord, I acknowledge my self a great and grievous Sinner, I have sinned
against the clearest light and the dearest love; I have deserved to have been
spurned from thy Presence, and from the glory of thy Power, and that thou
should now say unto me, I will have no more to do with such an unworthy
Wretch, such a polluted filthy Creature as thou art and have been: But, O Lord,
there is mercy with thee that thou may be feared; and thou have promised,
that if a Sinner turn from his wickedness thou will have mercy on him; and tho
his sins were as scarlet, thou would make them white as wool: Fulfill, O Lord,
thy gracious Promise unto me, a poor supplicant, in this my last hour of my
life; purge and cleanse me from all sin and filthiness, give me true
Repentance; and if there lies any sin not yet repented of, O Lord bring it to
my Conscience, Mind and Memory: But I hope, O Lord, thou have heard my prayers,
my sighs and groans; I hope and trust thou have pardoned all my sins, and wilt
immediately receive my soul. Look down in Mercy on my dear Wife and Family, be
thou a Comfort and all in all unto them. Now, Lord, I am coming to thee, assist
me to the last moment, Comfort my distressed Soul; do more for me than I am
able to ask for, or think of, but what thou know to be needful and necessary
for me, in and through the Merits of my dear Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ,
to whom with thee and thy blessed Spirit of Grace be ascribed the Kingdom, the
Power and the Glory, for ever and for ever,

Amen.
The Dying Words of Capt. Kidd, Executed at the same Time and Place.
THis Gentleman was the last Executed at that time; as soon as Capt. Madders
was turned off, he began to prepare to follow, and called to his Guards and
those present, Do you see this, (pointing up to eleven that were dead before
him) do you think this is not dreadful to me, that eleven of twelve of us, that
but a few hours since came down together are dead and in Eternity? and I am
just going to follow them, and shall immediately be in the same Condition: Says
one to him, It must be dreadful to flesh and blood; says he, Well, Gentlemen, I
will assure you, I am so far concerned, that methinks I bethink their
Happiness, that they should be so long before me in bliss and happiness, but
I Will make haste to follow; I am satisfied this is the best day that ever I saw:
The day of a Man's death is said to be better than the day of his birth, and
truly so I find it as to my flesh, for I shall be presently free from sin and
sorrow; I am satisfied God has done his best for me: I might have lived and
have forgotten God, but now I am going where I shall sin no more: It Is a
blessed thing to be free from sin, and to be with Christ: O how great were the
sufferings of Christ for us, beyond all that I can undergo! how great is that
Glory to which I am going! Then taking his leave of the People then present, he
prayed some small time very devoutly, and with seeming great Joy and Comfort,
the Executioner did his Office. There was Executed also at the same time diverse
others, as Mr. Will. Hewling, Doct. Temple, Mr. Matthews, with some others.

At Bridport, in the same County of Dorset, there was Executed Twelve, one of
which was John Sprage of Lyme, a Man more fit to dye than he that Condemned him
was fit to live: He was a zealous Christian, and a Man that in a manner lived
in Heaven while on Earth; he was but of an ordinary Estate in this World; but
to be short, his Praise, his Worth, his Fame will never dye in those places
where known; he went about doing good, even in his worldly Employments, as I
have been credibly informed, hardly any thing coming that way but what his
spiritual Meditations were upon. He was Apprehended near Salisbury, brought to
Dorchester, where I saw him several times, and was conversant with him before
his Trial; he carried himself very moderately to all; some of diverse Principles
in matters of Religion he continually Prayed with them, advising and
instructing them to those holy Duties which were necessary to Salvation: Being
asked how he could endure those hardships he had undergone, since his being
taken; says he, If this be all, it is not so much; but my Friend, if you were to
take a Journey in those ways you were not acquainted with, you would (I hope)
desire Advice from those that had formerly used those ways, or lived near by
them: Yes, says he: Then said he, The ways of Affliction which I have lately
traveled in, I had Advice many a time from a Minister, who has often told his
Congregation of the troublesomness of the road, and of the difficulty of
getting through; and has given me and hundreds of others to understand the
pitts and stones in the way, and how to avoid them; he has been a Man used to
those roads many years; I have taken his Advice, I am got thus far on
confortably, and I trust shall do so to the end; I am not afraid to fight a
duel with Death, if so it must be: Now I thank God I can truly say, O Death
where is thy sting? and O Grave where is thy victory? Two or three days after
their Sentence they were drawn to Execution, but were very rudely and
opprobriously dealt with, to the shame of those that then had the charge over
them, their Rigor unto them was more like Turks than Christians. But to
conclude, being come to the Place of Execution, he Prayed very devoutly with
them all, but by the rudeness of the Guards there could be no Copy taken to be
said to be true: All of them dyed very Courageous, especially this stout
Christian Champion, who spoke to them in these words, (looking on the
Soldiers) saying, Little do you think that this very Body of mine, which you
are now come to see cut in pieces, will one day rise up in Judgment against
you, and be your Accuser, for your delight in spilling of Christian Blood; the
Heathens have far more Mercy: O it is sad, when England must outstrip Infidels
and Pagans! but pray take notice, don't think that I am not in Charity with
you; I am so far, that I forgive you and all the World; and do desire the God
of Mercies to forgive you, and open your hearts, and turn you from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan to the Lord Jesus Christ; and so Farewell. I
am going out of the power of you all; I have no dependence but upon my blessed
Redeemer, to whom I commit my dear Wife and Children, and all the World.

The last Speech of Doct. Temple of Nottingham, at the Place of Execution.
DOcter Temple was one of them that Landed with the Duke, and was his chief
Physician and Chyrurgeon; he lived in Nottingham, but minding to see other
Parts of the World, (as I have heard) goes for Holland, where he came
acquainted with the Duke of Monmouth, concerning which he thus spoke, just as
he was going off the Ladder:

Christian Friends, and dear Contrymen,
I Have somewhat to say, and not very much, before I depart from you, and shall
be seen no more: And,

First, As to my Engagement with the Duke of Monmouth.

Secondly, How far I was concerned: And,

Thirdly, I shall leave all of you to be Judges in matter of Fact: And so for
the

First, As a Dying Man I now Declare, that when I entered my self with the Duke
of Monmouth, to be his Chyrurgeon, it was on no other Account but to serve him
in the West Indies; where I knew no other Design whatsoever, but to Possess
himself of some of those Islands, until I had been at Sea two days, wherein one
privately told me, we were absolutely bound for England, and I should take it
from him it was true; it much surprised me, but knowing no way to avoid it, or
to get on shore, though it was at that time contrary to my Inclinations, if I
could have avoided it: I would not let others see that I had that
dissatisfaction within me. After our Landing at Lyme, I knew it was never the
near to attempt my Escape, the Country being so beset; on the other hand, if
the Duke of Monmouth did win the day, I might have raised my Fortunes as high
as I could expect; these were the Arguments that Flesh and Blood did create in
my Breast for self-preservation. While I was with the said Duke, I did him as
much Service as I could, and faithfully: After it pleased God to disperse that
Army under his Command, I endeavored to secure my self, but by Providence was
taken at Honyton, from thence Committed to Exon, and after removed to
Dorchester, where I received my Sentence, and am now as you see just going to
Execution; the Lord prevent all of you from such ignominious Deaths; and I
advise you all, that you never take any great thing in hand, but what you have
a warrant for from the Lord: I assure you I had not satisfaction in this; but
this I am sure, that if I have done any thing amiss in it, it is Pardoned: I
Bless God I have that satisfaction, I dye a Professor of the Church of England.
I desire Pardon of all those I have any ways wronged or abused, as I freely
forgive all those that have wronged or abused me; I am in Charity with all men.
Lord have mercy upon me, give me strength to go through these pains, and give
me full Assurance now at this last moment: Come, Lord Jesus, Come quickly.

Also one Samuel Robbins of Charmouth in the County of Dorset, that was
Executed, or rather Murdered, at Warham, in the said County; I cannot pass him
by in silence, his Case being so extraordinary hard, that to speak moderately
betwixt the King and his Case, I do say this, that I verily believe never Man
suffered innocenter; as I hope you will be satisfied in, after you have heard
his Crime, and on what small grounds he was Guilty, or so supposed by my Lord
Chief Justice.

He used generally in the Summer to use the Craft of Fishing, to get a
competent maintenance for his Family, and happened to be out at Sea a Fishing
before Lyme, that day the Duke came in to land, and was commanded on board of
one of the Duke's Ships, he not knowing who they were, and they bought his Fish
of him; after which they told him that was the Duke of Monmouth, poynting at
him, and that he was just going to Land; he desired to go on shore, which was
refused, and told, that as soon as the Duke was landed he should have his
liberty; so accordingly he came on shore, and never after was with him, or ever
took up Arms under him: I leave the Reader to judge whether this was High
Treason or no. This was all he was Guilty of, except that he was a good honest
Man, a zealous Christian, a Man of a very good Life and Conversation, as I
think his Neighbors will attest it, in most Towns and Parishes near where he
lived; but alas he had a good Book in his House when taken, called, The solemn
League and Covenant; this was the High Treason he must be Guilty of, which was
aggravated to the Lord Chief Justice, by one or two hot Spirits his Neighbors.
But to be short, he received his Sentence of Death with grea Courage, and not
at all dismayed; saying very often in Prison before, If it pleased God to call
him now (to glorify his Name by this Providence of his) to Death, he should be
ready, but (said he) I am as Innocent of any thing I have done against any Man
that may deserve this Punishment, as the Child now unborn. When he came to the
Place of Execution, he very cheerfully declared his Innocence to the
Spectators, as before, and so Praying very devoutly for some time, he was
Executed: His Prayer I have no exact Copy of.

Also one Mr. Charles Speak of London, a Gentleman of good Extraction, being
Son to the Worshipful George Speak Esquire near Ilmister in the County of
Sommerset, where he was Executed; his Case also was extraordinary hard, but
there may be Two great Reasons given why he was Executed; the First was,
Because he came from that good Pious Family, which always have been opposers to
Popery, and suffered deeply for their courage that way. Secondly, The said Mr.
Charles Speak had purchsed some great place in the King's Bench, or
Common Pleas, which was very profitable to him, so that by his fall there being
a forfeiture, much Money may be made of it: all intercession would not avail
with the L. C. J. for his life; he hapened to be at Ilminster at the time of
the Dukes being there, which was the greatest Crime he was guilty of, the
validity of his Evidence I leave to those in the West, which know how far it
was carried that way. He was a fine courteous loving Gentleman, and
notwithstanding his Youth, he acted the part of an old Christian Soldier, at
his Death, preparing himself before to undergo those pains, saying very often,
They were nothing to his deserts from God Almighty, but as for what I am
Accused of, and Sentenced for, I hope you will believe I am not so Guilty, as
my Judge and Accusers have endeavored to make me; if it had pleased God, I
should have been willing to have lived some time longer, but Gods time being
come, I am willing, I will be contented to drink this bitter Cup off. Being at
the place of Execution, the crowd was so great, that I suppose he was shorter
than otherwise he would have been; but alas! how could it be? for on every side
of him, as well as up and down the Town, the Inhabitants weeping and bewailing
him: O it is the worst day that ever we saw in this Town! Must this good
Gentleman dye here? Oh! yet save his life, I am ready to dye for him; and the
like. He Prayed very heartily for near an hour, and Sung a Psalm, and so we
hope was translated to Heaven, there to Sing everlasting Praises and
Hallelujahs. His Father and Mother you may easily judge were not a little
concerned about him, but their Adversaries malice ended not here, but Father
and Mother must be brought in, and how many Thousands of Pounds it cost them, I
think is too well known in London, and most parts of the Kingdom have heard in
the public Letters their Names mentioned. Some may think they were concerned
with the Duke, but I never heard there was so much made appear against them, as
could have made them been brought in guilty of High Misdemeanors; had not the
good Gentleman and his Lady been virtuous People, abhorring the Debaucheries of
the times, and of such a competent Estate, able to spare ten or twelve thousand
Pounds; the hard usage this honest brave Gentleman and his virtuous Lady had,
and their sufferings, to relate them, would be too large; and besides, it is so
well known in most places in the West, that I shall without saying any more
proceed. And next for Mr. Parret, who was Executed at Taunton; if I mistake
not, he said he was a Londoner, and a Brewer; when he came to the place of
Execution, he seemed a Man almost unconcerned at Death; after some time, he
began to deliver himself somewhat low in Voice to the People, and after rising
by degrees, he seemed more like a Minister in a Pulpit preaching devoutly, than
a Prisoner just going to Execution; but I being then not well, could not tarry
to see his end; but the Character I had was, That he desired all, not to be
faint*hearted because of their fall, and to think that there was no hopes
remaining: He said, He verily believed God would yet work out deliverance for
them, and at the time they were in the greatest Extremity, that would be God's
opportunity; put your whole trust and confidence, and dependence on the Lord,
and he will never leave you nor forsake you: and much more; but having no more
exact Coyy, I shall not enlarge, but come to some other.

A Poem on a Lady that came to my Lord Chief Justice, to beg Mr. Bescombs Life,
Sister to one of the Sheriffs in the West, which he denied.
HArder than thine own Native Rocks!
To let the Charming Silvia kneel,
And not one spark of Pity feel:
Harder than senseless Stones and Stocks!
Ye Gods! what showers of Pearls she gave?
What precious Tears; enough to save
A bleeding Monarch from the Grave.
By every hapless Virgin Cursed:
Winter blasts not more unkind;
Deaf as the rugged Northern Wind;
By some Welsh Wolf in Murders nursed.
Have thou Eyes? or have thou none?
Or are they worse than Marble grown?
Since Marbles weep at Silvia's moan.
Rebbels stiff, and supple Slaves,
All the frantic World divide,
One must stoop, and the other ride;
Cringing fools, and Factious Knaves;
Though falling on the losers part,
Gentler Death arrests my Heart,
And has in Honey dipped his Dart.
Life farewell, thou gaudy Dream,
Painted over with griefs and joys,
Which the next kind hour destroys;
And drown them all in Lethes Stream:
What blessed Mortal could not die,
Might he with me Embalmed lie,
In precious Tears from Silvias Eye?
The Last Speech OF HENRY BODDY, Executed at BATH.
WHile he was in Prison, especially after Sentence, he behaved himself mighty
Humble, Meek, and was much in Meditation, which was observed by several
Divines, especially one who attended him to his Last, his name Mr. Simpson; his
poor Wife coming to see him at Wells, and to make her Interest with some
Friends, if possible to save his Life; but finding it lost Labor, and that she
could by no means prevail, she died there for grief, before her Husband was
Executed, to his great grief. When he came to the place of Execution, he
delivered himself to the People in these Words:

Good People, I am come here to pay a Debt due to Nature, which every one* one
time or another, must pay, though not in this manner, or nature. I am Condemned
as a Traitor and Rebel against my King, which were things I always hated and
abhorred, and therefore give me so much time as to Deliver my self to you, and
what I say, I hope you will believe me at this time, being just going to give
an account, not only for every Idle word, but for all things I have done since
I have had a being.

I was Born in Lyme-Regis, in the County of Dorset, and bred up a Seaman from
my Infancy; I have had the Honor to serve His Majesty King Charles the Second,
in his Wars with the Dutch and French, diverse times: I always thought it to be
the Duty of every true Englishman, to stand up in his Countries quarrel with
Foreigners, to maintain our Ancient Privileges and Honor of our Nation. I
served him faithfully; and as for any undertaking now with the late Duke of
Monmouth, for which, I am now come to suffer Death; as for my designs, I am
sure they were good, for I did believe him to be my Soverign's Son and Heir,
but if otherwise, I have done amiss, and am sorry, and hope the Lord has
pardoned it: While I was in Arms, I am sure there is none can say I have
personally wronged them: I desire all your Prayers for me to the last. I am no
Orator, therefore if you please, (speaking to the Minister,) do those last
spiritual Services for me, as for to Pray with me, and for me: The Minister
being much taken with him, desired leave of the Sheriff to ask him some
questions, which being granted; the Minister said unto him, I must make bold
with you, but not to hold you too long before I pray, but to satisfy my self
and the People on what ground you stand; I mean, as concerning your Everlasting
state: Now pray resolve me a few things; First, Whether you do own that
Doctrine of Non-Resistance, owned by the Church; That it is not lawful on any
account whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King? O Sir! as to that I
Answer: Could I have been satisfied he had been my Lawful Prince, I should not
have done it: But said the Minister, He is, and you are not to be judge; except
you own those things, some People will hardly have Charity for you after you
are Dead: What matters that said he? would you have me, now you put me so close
to it, to lie? No I will not. I say, If he was my Lawful King, I was missed in
my judgment, and have committed a great Error; but Lord, I hope thou have
washed away all my sins, in and through the Blood of my dear Redeemer, in whose
alone Merits I hope for Mercy. I desire to be asked no more Questions: Then the
Minister Prayed very devoutly near half an hour; after which, lifting up his
Hands and Eyes to Heaven, quietly submitted to Death.

This Bloody Tragedy in the West being over, our Protestant Judge returns for
London; soon after which Alderman Cornish felt the anger of some body behind
the Curtain; for it is to be Noted, that he was Sheriff when Best prayed an
Indictment might be preferred, and was, as well as Sheriff Bethel, earnest in
promoting it; in alleging, that it was no ways reasonable, that the Juries of
London should lie under such a reproach, etc. But passing this over, we now
find this Person arrived at the Pinnacle of Honor; the Purse and Mace were
reserved for him, vacant by the Death of the Lord Keeper North, and he advanced
to the Lord Chancellourship of England; raised by this means, as one might
think, above the envy of the crowd; and it might be wished, in so dangerous a
height he had looked better to his footsteps; for now being Created Baron of
Wem* we find him in a High Commission, or Ecclesiastical Court, Suspending the
Honorable Lord Bishop of London from performing the Episcopal Office and
Function of that See, and for no other default, than not readily complying with
the King's Letter in Suspending Dr. Sharp, Dean of Norwich, for Preaching a
Sermon in the Parish Church of St. Giles in the Fields, at the request of the
Parishioners, showing the Errors and Fallacies of the Romish Religion; the
better to confirm them in the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of England. Nor
was it this good Bishop alone that was aimed at; for scarce had the Magdalen
College passed the Seal, and in that very Mother of Learning, and Chief
Seminary of our Church, such alterations made, as startled the Kingdom; by
whose Counsel I undertake not to determine; but in the midst of Liberty of
Conscience, as twice declared. The Church of England had a Test put upon her
Sons, which seemed such a Paradox that has been rarely heard of, viz. To Read
the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conscience in the Churches, during the
time of Divine Service, and a Mark, and Penalties threatened to the refusers;
which was evidently demonstrated, by the Imprisonment of those Pious Patriots
of their Country, and Pillars of the Church: His Grace the Lord Arch bishop of
Canterbury, the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, Ely, Peterborough, Chichester,
St. Asaph, and Bristol; who for showing their Reasons, why they could not
comply with this Command, by way of Humble Petition; were sent to the Tower,
and afterward Tried upon Information of High Misdemeanour, at the Court of
King's Bench; where their Innocence appearing in a large manner, they were
Acquitted, to the scandal of their Accusers: yet Orders were sent into all
parts of England, to return an Account to the Lord Chancellor, of those that
refused to Read the Declaration, that they might be proceeded against, for a
contempt of what their Consciences would not permit them to do, and for a time
they were extremely hot upon it: But the News of the great Preparations in
Holland, and that the Prince of Orange was certainly designed for England, the
determined Councils cooled, and then quite ceased* so that the Church of
England*men, whose Cause the Prince had espoused, were restored again to the
Commissions and Trusts they had (by what Justice I know not) been lately
deprived; and amongst other Charters that were on this occasion restored* was
that of the City of London; and that which makes it more memorable, was, that
it was brought to the Guild Hall by this Person* though he was not attended with
the Shouts and Acclamations he expected* nor seemed so florid or frolicksome as
heretofore, which some looked upon as a presaging Omen; and it is reported, soon
after he being asked by a Courtier, What the Heads* of the Princes Declaration
was? he should Answer, He was* sure his was one, whatever the rest was.

The Court by this time beginning to scatter, and the Prince of Orange
approaching, the King thought fit to withdraw himself, upon notice of which,
the Lord Chancellor betook himself to Wapping, disguised like a Seaman, in
order to his Escape to Hamborough, in a Collier; but being discovered* he was
brought before Sir John Chapman, Lord Mayor of the City of London, in a strange
disguise from what he formerly appeared* And by reason of the Lord Mayor's
Indisposition* he not being able to Commit him, he offered to go to the Tower,
to be out of the Hands of the Rabble, who there in great numbers with clubs and
slaves, threatened him with present destruction: But having a Guard of the Train
bands to conduct him, he got thither safe, and soon after was charged in
Custody by a Warrant of Commitment from the Lords at White Hall, where he
continued* under much affliction and indisposition; having since moved for his
Habeas-Corpus to be Bailed, but has hitherto not been able to attain it. He had
not been in the Tower many days, but as it is said (whither true or no, I cannot
affirm) he had a Barrel of Oysters sent him, upon sight of which* he said to
the bearer, Well then* I see I have some Friends left still; but upon opening
the Barrel, he found them to be only Friends that were impatient till he gave
them a prospect of his future destiny, for verily the mighty Present was
nothing but a good able Halter. Now, as I said before, whether this passage be
true or no, I cannot say, but this I am sure, (if we consider his Lordships
Life and Cruelties) the Moral of it is very good* And thus Reader* you have
briefly seen the Rise and Fall of this now unfortunate Person, and so (at
present) we take our Farewell.

FINIS.
