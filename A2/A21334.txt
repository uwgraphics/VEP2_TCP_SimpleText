De cursione Lune.



Here begins the course and disposicion of the days of the Moon in laten
and in English which be good: and which be badde after the influentes of
the Moon drawn out of a book of Aristotiles de Astronomiis.

QUicu^que enim cursionem lune scire volueri^ Sciatis Primo quo modo Sol per
signum vadit. Sol namque in quo libet anno pertransit omnia signa mora^do i^
quo libet me^se / and in omnibus diebus eode^ modo Luna pertra^sit oi^a signa
in quo libet mense.

Vno quoque signo duobus diebus and.xii. horis. Et quando luna iuncta fuerit
cum sole in aliquo signo tunc dicitur esse in combustione ibidem quo perficit
cursione^ suam. Cum aute^ separatur a sole a part occidentali per duo decim
gradus iterim elucere and tu^c dicitur noua que si ista coniunctio sit ante
meridiem dicit luna prima. Sed si post meridiem diei sequentis dicitur luna
secunda. Certum est que luna se^per habet initium ab eodem signo in quo est
tempore coniunctionis. Et ideo prodest scire in quo signo fit luna oi^ die.
Quia luna est aliis planetis terre appro pinquior and rebus mundi plus alijs
prestat effectum secundum naturas et complexiones signorum que discurrit vt
dicit Aristotiles in libro de Astronomijs.

GOd that all this world has wrought
And all ma^kynd has made of naught
and on the cross us bought with payn^ and woe
Send us grace so for to do
That we al sinful mankende
To that great joy we may wend
That he bought us all to
when he to death for us was do
All things that been don and wrety^
As these great clerks wetyn
written they be for over profit
For our solas and our delight
So says saint poule in his saw
That is a techer of gods law
There for friends I will you fond
Some things to do you understand
That may some what glade your chere
And all tho that should it here
For I shall tell you no fable
But things hothe good and able
And that been prouyd be holy wrye
And drawn out by clerkys wit
Therefore lordynges less and more
Ly^ten all to my lore
And I shall read you beforne
what time so that a child should be borne
Of that child what it shall be fall
That his ending in his happys all
And what betokens our dremyng
That we met in our slepyng
Good or evil or vanite
All together here shall ye
And also what time is good
Man or woman to be latin blood
And a^^ thing that is for to done
So seyth the reule of the moon
To tell you I have sowght
what time is good what time is nowght
For by the moon withouten lesyng
Is reuled every erthely thing
Thereof holy wryght beryth witness
And our forefathers as I guess
Adam and Eve and Abraham
And all the kynne that of them came
Beryth witness of this story
For it was made by them truly
And take exampel at them should we
That were our forne fathers and prouyd have be
How we should here heygh and low
Our destenyes and our happys know
Therefore lordynges I pray you
For to lysten this beginning now
The first day.
THe first day of the moon Adam
Our forne father in to this world came
That day is good withouten sin
All things for to be gynne
The child that is borne that day
He shall be nobyl and wise parfay
And of long life withouten fail
But often he shall be in great travail
And who so that day take sickness
He shall langure long as I guess
with great pain skap he shall
And therefore always thank god of all
And what thou metyst in thy sleep
God of his mercy thereof take keep
For it shall turn the to Joy and bliss
whereof god give us grace not to mysse
But that day is no time good
On no manner to be let blood
To let the blood on no vain
who so will ben withotuen pain.
The second day.
THe second day profytabyl is
All things good to do I wys
That day our lord began eve make
Of mannys rybbe she was take
who so will to wife that day old or young take
That day is good weddyng to make
For who so that day wedde his wife
Together they should have long life
And often both myrthe and woe
So had Adam and Eve also
who so do any theft that day
He shall be taken there with perfay
what child so that day be borne
Many virtues lie him beforne
A blessed body shall he be
wise in good and of heart free
Be it maiden be it knave
Joy Enough it shall have
Love of man and of woman
More than this book tell can
And who so that day take sickness
He shall sone be hole as I guess
what so in thy dreme come to the
It shall turn in to vanyte
And who so will that day blede
It will help him if he have need
The.iii. day.
THe.iii. day Cayn was borne
what so thou doste that day is lorne
But thou serve our heaven king
Therefore I read the withouten lesynge
That ye that day no thing begin
For ye should lesynt it your sin
For Caym for his sin full even
Had the curse of god in heaven
And who so that day take sickness
He shall ben holdyn long in distress
That day is not good out to ryd^
He no horse for to stryde
And who so that day borne be
Fase and couetyse be shall he
And loath to give the pore bred
And dey he shall a wicked ded
That thou dremyst it tourneth to naught
To let the blod be not thy thought
For that day is meruylous
And a day full perylous
The.iiii. day.
THe.iiii. day borne was Abell
That day thou may boldly and well
All that thou will boldly begin
Out taken dedys that long to sin

And after hedys of water to dygge
To opyn them and late them ren^e
Both be feld and be fenne
who so be borne that day without fail
He shall have aparty travail
He shall be aparty lechour
But he shall suffer in many a sharp shour
He shall well over escape all
And great richesse him shall be
And great well or that he dey
who so that day do any folly
Or any theft and therefore fle
Hastily found shall he be
who so that day in sickness fall
Son^ ^ey or wast he shall
what thou thynkyst in thy dremynge
It shall amend ne help no thing
That day is good for every man I wys
To pass the sea with marchandys
That day to let the blood
Is neither much euel ne good
The.v. day.
THe.v. day Abel made is offering
For his sins to the heaven king
And Caym made his sacrifyce
That day falssely in all wise
That day is naught to take
Sacrifyce thereon to make
who so that day borne be
Hard destynes have shall he
He shall be ever sorry and mad
In all his live therewith I ladde
In great travail and in sin
And uneath it shall fro him wynn^
That day who so do any trespass
He shall be takyn with that casse
who so that day sickness have
Medecyne ne no leche shall him save
who so that day to the sea fare
Him were better not come their
That thou dremyst shall be certain

For he shall be pynyd with all
But at the la^t skape he shall

That thou shall it sone se
But look thou tell it no man
For nougth that any friend can

And houses to rere and tylle.
The.vii. day.

If sickness that day down the drive
Thou shall live long and turn to live
Thy dreme shall turn joy to the

The.xxviii. day.
THe.xxviii. day was borne S^mps^n
boldly do that day what thou ^ylt don
So thou grieve not god therewyth
Thou shall well speed in town and fryth
what child so that day borne be
In great travail be shall he
And ever besy and sorry
And treue as any s^yle treuly
If thou that day any sickness feel
Thou shall lie long and after have hele
If thou that day s^ele ought
with the to prison it shall be brought
But ^are the ^el of letyng blood
For that day is no time good
That thou me^ys^ in thy dreme that night
It shall the turn to joy full right
The.xxix. day.
THe.xxix. day was borne Solomon
Look thou that day begyn^e thing no^
For if thou do I sey trewly

But who so that day borne is
He shall be of great pryse I wys

And lykyng of women al his fylle
Rich ne pour wernyth him none
All is lykyng with him to done
And if it a maid child be
Meke and mylde and courteyse be shall she
Fair of face and amyable
And to all men delectable
And or she be of any age

If sickness that day do the travail
Thereof thou shall sone be hayle

But blood letyng is naught to blame
All thy dreme to good turned shall be

The.xxx. day.
THe.xxx. day was borne Absalon
That day is good to begin upon
Children to set to scole to lere
To bye and sell and houses to rere
To chafre to wedde to pass the sea
To begin tylth and graffe on tree
That day what woman do lecherye
She shall never leave that folly
But what child that day borne is
He shall be good ware and wise
Be it maiden be it knave
Joy enough shall it have
If it a maiden child be
Sone shall be her destyne
That al men shall desire her than
And also if it should be a man
All women both whyt and blake
will desire him to her make
And thou pyke or stele that day ought
To the treuthe he shall be brought
Thy dreme shall turn to great trauayll
Or thou shall fall to great parayll
That day also is time good
If thou wylt blede vain blood.
Now have ye herd old and young
Discryed many diverse thing
Of chafare / of dremys / of children birth
Of bledyng / of wedyng / and other mirth
And by our formest faders witness
But I warn you both more and less
That ye be never the more bold
For any thing that I have told.
