for the good of all such as during that night of general Error and Apostasy,
2 These. 2. 3. Revel. 3. 10. have been so long misled with Romes hobgoblins.

MYSTERIES DISCOVERED.
CHAP. 1.
BEing so extremely necessitated after so manifold a manner, as first for the
discharge of my conscience to God, and man; that woe is me if like a fearful
or idle servant I should bury that simple talent; Secondly, for the vindication
of my reputation, if I should sitdowne in silence, I might seem to be an
accessory to the false accusation of those that blast we with the most odious
infamy of blaphemy (to deny the heavenly Trinity, and Jesus Christ to be our
blessed Savior,) and the truth of the sacred Canonical Scriptures; Lastly, by
my long and excessive indurance, being that I cannot procure by the best
friends I have, or of those that are appointed by the Parliament, a Petition to
be presented to the Honorable House of Commons in Parliament, to omit, that I
cannot receive that small Annuity due into me out of Yorkshire, besides the
false reports of injurious and ignorant persons, that I am not only a most
debosh'd, and desperate, but a distracted and mad man; which I hope will be a
sufficient plea to indifferent judges for the publishing of my bonds. And I
appeal to my Country and all good Christians, whether or no by so long
imprisonment, without any allowance, or having a determinate hearing,
notwithstanding above 100 Petitions printed and written to the House in
general, and the most eminent (and concerning members) I be not debarred of
Christian, but of the liberty of a Subject contrary to Law, Ordinance of
Parliament: equity and humanity. So that without a speedy remedy of such common
continuate, and unheard of cruelties our ensuing end is like to be worse then
that which we suffered in our late Civil Wars. For it is not the continuance
of our mock-fasts that will excuse, so long as our oppression continues, Isa.
58. 5, 6. etc. yea, of such as conclude their Fasts like that of January 28th.
1645, at Westminster, with a consultation how to murder an innocent, and that
after a most cruel (more then Heathenish manner without any legal hearing)
much less laudable proceeding: (being not allowed of the Divines once to
oppose, or yet to give an advised Answer by writing) Lord, lay not this to
their charge, being but an intent (through ignorance) which by Gods providence,
and the more gracious of the Parliament was prevented.

For my discovery of two grand mysteries, viz. that anomious or lawless
mystery, 2 Thessalonians. 2. from the third to the thirteenth Verse, As also Revel. 17.
1, 5. and its opposite, Revel. 10. 7. the mystery of God, to wit, the Father
and Creator, 14. 17. For the better clearing of which misty mysteries, Imagine
some great King like some of the old Persians, that would seldom or never be
seen of the people, should send his son and heir fully acquainted with his
will and pleasure, as his vicegerent plenipotentiary and prolocutor, whether
the son being equivalent (to use that term) in way of reference, John 14. 9.
as 13. 20. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. be in himself coequall to the King, for that (as)
John 5. 23. is an Adverbe of like quality and not equality; this we know that
God the Father is that invisible and indivisible King, 1 Timothy 1. 17. 6. 15, 16.
John 1. 18. 5. 37. 1 John 4. 12. and that the inauguration or anointing of our
blessed Savior was his baptism, Matthew. 3. 17. 4. 17. Acts 1. 22. 10, 37.
which is therefore termed the beginning, viz. of his Gospel, John 1. 1. 1 John
1. 1. and that new creation, 2 Cor. 5. 17. so that Christ is to us both God and
his Word, as Moses was to Aaron, and Aaron to him, Exodus 4. 16. not that a word
is Christ, or Christ life everlasting, but in a figurative sense after a
Scripture manner and meaning, according to the character of that beloved
Apostle, as Erasmus observes in his argument to his Epistles, and Hierome in
his Preface to his Gospel shows that this Apostle had a special intent to
confute Corinthus and the Ebionites that affirmed Christ to be but an ordinary
man the son of Joseph, etc. this Apostle being the best Commentator of his
own meaning; how Christ is said to be that visible God, as Isa. 40. 7. the
word, John 3. 34. yea, and palpable word, 1 John 1. 1. life eternal, 5. 20.
that Lamb of God, John 1. 36. our Passover, 1 Cor. 5. 7. the the rock 10. 4.
David our King, Ezekiel. 34. 23. Hosea 3. 5. in them typical predications, and
the like, John 15. 1. Matthew. 17. 12. Is. 1. 10. Revel. 11. 8. by a Metaphor, or
Metonymy, as Perkins and Alsted in their Tracts of sacred Tropes; where Alsted
expounds that 1 Cor. 15. 28. then shall the son also himself be subject, that
is acknowledged to be.

CHAP. 2.
TO come to the Question whether Christ (after the doctrine of Athanasius in
his Symbol) be coequal with the father? We know what charge the Apostle
gives, Gal. 1. 10. against such setters up of new Creeds without warranty,
contrary to the first and great Commandment set forth by proclamation of the
great King, expressly testifying not only his unity, Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Psalm. 83. 18.
86. 10. Isa. 37. 16. etc. etc. etc. but also his supremacy and majority, Psalm.
13. 5, 5. Joh. 10. 29. 14. 28. Ephesians. 1. 17. 4. 6. Luke 1. 32. John 17. 3. Mark
13. 32. in exclusive and superlative expressions: Of which see more, Mat 20.
23. 27, 46. John 20. 17. Heb. 1. 9. 1 Cor. 15. 28. the son being tenant in
Capite, to God the Father, 1 Cor. 11. 3. both for his words, works, and
honors, John 3. 34. 5. 19. 2 Pet. 1. 17. and therefore not coequall, for
without contradiction the less is dignified by the greater. Also God and
Christ are distinguished, John 14. 1. 1 Thessalonians. 3. 11. it being an observation
of the learned Erasmus, that where God is put absolutely the Father is
understood, as John 8. 54. To come to the offices of Christ our Mediator, 1 Timothy 2. 5. as a King, Acts 17. 31. Matthew. 25. 34. as a Priest, Heb. 7. 24. of a
Prophet, Deuteronomy, 18. 18. according to that most usual epithet of his
sanctification, the Son of man, denominations, being for the most part taken
from the more worthy, so John 8. 40. Acts 2. 23. 13. 38. Romans 5. 15. 1 Cor. 15.
21. Col. 1 15. Heb. 2. 16. 4. 15. 2. Esdras 13. 25, 32. which were to no
purpose if the better part of his person were not man: there being but a
graduall difference betwixt him and Moses and us, Heb. 3. 5, 6. 4. 15. Romans 8.
17. there being not one such word, or any one text tending to that purpose in
the whole holy Scriptures, but many to the contrary: If we have respect to the
scope, coherence, analogy, and the originalls, in discerning figurative forms
and phrases according to the sense and meaning, which is the spirit and life of
the two Testaments, Revel. 11. 11. whereas the letter is but the corpse common
as the highway throughout Christendom. Wherefore to speak definitively of the
heavenly Trinity. I believe the Father to be God himself, as 1 Thessalonians. 3. 11.
expressed by these adjuncts, the God of heaven, Revel. 11. 13. the living God
and Father, Joh. 6. 57. 69. and that the Son is our Messiah, 4. 26. whom God
made Lord and Christ, Acts 2. 36. Prince and Savior, 5. 31. And that the holy
spirit is the very power of God, Luke 1. 35. 24, 49. as 1 Cor. 2. 11. or the
Father God essentially, the Son vicentially, the holy Spirit potentially, or
the Father God above all, Ephesians. 4. 6. the Son of God with us, Matthew. 1. 23.
the holy Spirit God within us, 1 Cor. 2. 16. but for the Son to be coequall to
the Father, or the holy Spirit a distinct coequall person I cannot find; and I
believe that these three are one, or agree and conspire in the substance of the
same truth to salvation. See 1 Cor. 13. 13. 1 John 5. 8. of two Trinities
without coequalls, or yet persons. Purchase Pilgrimage. Covert's Travels.
And that of three coequall persons to be but the Chapel of Rome, for the
Church of Christ, and that which keeps the rest of the World in the Popes
pownd forth of his fold, both the Jews that believe the Old Testament, the
Turk, and the Great Mogoll, etc. according to the dictate of common
intelligence, not corrupt in this kind by a contrary habit, who cannot be
brought to believe in a Trinity implying Polytheosie, or Apotheosie, i. e. many
gods or a man-god. So that the denying of a second Deity or Godhead is not
destructive of faith, but only removes it from false foundation to a true,
that is God the Father by Christ Jesus, 2 Cor. 5. 19. 1 Pet. 5. 10. for that
John 5. 18. was a misprision of the Jews proceeding from their ignorance, as
may appear, 10. 34, 35, 36, 37. by our Savior his own Comment.

CHAP. 3.
TO answer objections of Scriptures wrested by that Genesis 1. 26. Let us make
man, which in the next verse, also 5. 1, 2. six several times; and Matthew. 19.
4. Mark. 10. 6. is expounded in the singular number like that, Genesis 11. 7, 8.
which were a contradiction, not an exposition, and that Elohim bara, the Gods
made in the first Verse, a solecisme and not an Hebraisme, being a figurative
consultation with his wisdom, or communication with the holy Angels by way of
approbation, as 1 Kings 22. 19. Job 1. 6. or enallage of the plural number for
the singular, for the more honor, Buxtorsii thesaur. 2. 10.
as Job 18. 2. Dan. 2. 36. John 3. 11. as Kings write in the style of Majesty
after the manner of the holy tongue, Drusius uno Elohim.
see Genesis 24. 9. of Abraham his Masters, Josh. 24. 19. he is holy Gods, Is.
19. 4. 54. 5. etc* but to infer three coequal persons from thence, the person
of Christ (according to the flesh) nor then existing is altogether
inconsequent; of the like sort seems that to be, Eccles. 12. 1. if parents be
not employed.

Isa. 9. 6. of a manchild that was to be born, it is granted, they are very
great and excellent, yet well beseeming our blessed Savior, the founder and
governor of his Church; of whose wonderful birth and works we have
sufficient testimonies; being of his Fathers most intimate Counsel, a mighty
God (not almighty God) above all appellative gods, 1 Cor. 8. 5. Revel. 1. 5.
the everlasting Father, or of the Age to come, (as Jerome) either by way of
Regeneration, and that by, an excellency or equivalency; as John 14. 9. of
whose government although there were a beginning, Heb. 10. 6. yet shall there
be no enduring the term militant, or of mortality, 1 Cor. 15. 26. So that it is
not a small thing for Christ to be so dignified by the Father, unless he be
deified and equallized with the Father, see Genesis 41. 43. Exodus 34. 14. 1 Samuel
18. 23. Ester 6. 9. as Is. 49. 6.

Jer. 23. 6. is but an argument from the name for some relation to God, as Genesis
22. 14. Exodus 17. 15. Judge 6. 24. 2 Samuel 6. 2. as it may appear, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
2 Cor. 5. 21. unless we would make Iehovahim gods in the plural, which were
dissonant to that incommunicable name.

Zach. 13. 7. speaks of a sociall and not a coequall party, as Judge. 18. 20.
Acts 15. 28. God and Christ concurring as sociall causes, to wit, primary
efficient, and principal instrument in the business of salvation, John 6. 44.
14 6. 1 John 1. 3, 6.

CHAP. 4.
THat John 2. 29. is an Enallage of the active for the passive, Levit. 13. and
14. etc. of the Priest clensing the Leper, like that, Genesis 41. 13. by the
divine power wherewith God endowed him, John 5. 2, 9 there being so many
testimonies to that purpose, Acts 2. 24. 13. 31. Romans 4. 24. 1 Cor. 15. 19. 2
Cor. 4. 14. Gal. 1. 1. Ephesians. 1. 20. Col. 2. 12. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. with Heb. 13
10. etc.

That Acts 20. 28.in some Translations is with that peculiar blood,

That Romans 9. and 5th. is spoken of Christ, as he was an Israelite by kind,
with the like clause to that, Romans 1. 25. Cor. 11. 31.

That Philip. 2. 6. should be took not upon him the equality Posselius and
Pusor show; the Apostle exhorting them by the example of Christ, who being in a
twofold form, as John 13. 13. Gal. 4. 1. took upon him the form of a servant,
wherefore God has highly exalted him, as Verse 9th. so that John 20. 28. is as
much as Lord and Master, like Elohim and Adonim, for the truth of Christ's
resurrection was that which Thomas doubted, and not his Deity.

That John 8. 58. of Christ his being before Abraham, is Baptist.

That 1 John 5. 7, 8. be the same in effect, like that, Mar. 10. 8. Sixtinus
Amama Gram. annot.
one by conspiration, or conjugation, not individuation, as 1 Cor. 6. 17. John
17. 21. Acts 4. 32. Heb. 2. 11. Jer. 32. 39. otherways we should confound the
Trinity by such an Unity.

John 17. 5. is a Scripture Prolepsis, in regard of divine anticipation; as may
be gathered from that 13. 31, 33. Luke 24. 26. according to Revel. 13. 8. so
Jer. 1. 5. in regard of Gods sore-knowledge and decree; Acts 2. 23. Gal. 1. 15.
Ephesians. 1. 4, 3. 11. 2 Timothy 1. 9.

Pet. 3. 19. is understood of Noe as in the next Verse, who by the same spirit
(1 Cor. 12. 4.) preached whiles the Ark was in preparing; before Christ began
to preach, Mat. 4. 17.

Revelation is called Alpha and Omega, so is the Angel, 22. 13. it being
usual to attribute that to the ministerial cause, which is proper to the
primary, Genesis 22. 15, 16, 18. 17. Exodus 3. 6. 7. Judge. 2. 1. Josh. 1. 11. 15. 2
Esdras 7. 3.

Hebrews to be of the some, they are to observe the manifold transitions; as
first of the Father, 2, 3, 4. of the Son, 5, 6, 7. of the Angels; 8. to the
son; 9, 10, 11, 12. to the Father according to the 102 Psalm in which not a
word of the Son; 13, 14 of the Angels again; so that in the sixth Verse is
understood of a secondary and not supreme worship like a shadow to the person
it belongs to, 1 Chronicles. 29. 20. so that inference of the whole first Chapter
to the Hebrews, is a fallacy from a part to the whole.

John 1. 3. All things were made by him, is not meant of this material world,
as appears by the 10 verse, but according to the subject intended, the new
creation, 2 Cor. 5. 17. according to that, Heb. 1. 2. which ought to be ages,
and not worlds, see 2. 5. concerning spiritual and eternal things, as 2 Cor.
4. 8. Col. 1. 16.

Judge. 3. 9. 15. Isa. 19. 20.

Pro. 8. 11, only argues that Gods wisdom was always present with him, and
does infer his holy spirit, ler. 10. 12. Job 33. 3. as Wisd. 7. 25. to which
actions are attributed, Prove. 8. 1. by a Prosopopie of a person, as Psalm. 85.
10* 11.

That Trifagie, Isa. 6. 3. is a reduplication expressing the Sam. 18. 33. Prove.
31. 2. Deuteronomy. 13. 14. Wherefore let us labor to reconcile Scripture by
Scripture, and by no means admit of an absurd sense.

CHAP. 5.
THat which is objected that Christ were not a sufficient satisfaction if he
were not equal to the Father; is dissonant from the condition of remunerative
justice consisting in a Geometrical proportion of acceptance by the party
offended, the party offended being sinful man, besides that infers
imminution to Christ his most precious blood, Mat. 26. 28. 1 Timothy 2. 6. Heb.
10. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 19. Revel. 12. 11. John 15. 3.

For a corollary I will conclude with that, Exodus 34. 14. Because the Lord
whose name is Zealous, is a zealous God, and will not give his glory to
another. as Isa. 48. 11. having no equal in heaven, as Psalm. 89. 6. Isa. 48.
11. for to add or substract to and from equals, makes them unequal, equals
agreeing in the same common measure, as Revel. 21. 16. So that if Christ be
equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead he is so much more by the
addition of his manhood, which I now do more then suspect to be that 2 These.
2. 4. of that Catholic professor in a Romish sense, according to the Original
at Thessalonia, Hist. Tripart. 9. 7. and if this, that, and another person, be
equally God, Almighty, Eternal, etc. (three ones make three, as well in the
greatest persons as least parts, also if the Son be from the Father, and the
holy Spirit from both by a personal generation and procession, there must
needs follow a Hysteren proteron in the Deity, to say that from God to naturals
is inconsequent, it is to be noted that for particular respects, God having a
voluntary agent, and that infinite, does whatsoever he pleases, even beyond
ordinary means, yet in general respects, there is good consequence to and from
God, with naturals observing the distance that is due to his Majesty, as Malac.
1. 6. Mat. 5. 48. 7. 11. Wherefore to make Christ coequall to his Father, is to
make another or a false Christ* or (to deal plainly with friends) an Idol
Christ, or two Gods (as much as in us lies) the great indignity to his
imparalleld Father, which the indignation of his most pious Son, in wounding
the Father through his sides, and I fear that which we now, and others
hereafter shall suffer for, as Revel. 6. 16, 17. for as it is high Treason to
equallize even the Kings Son, with the King himself, so it is high blasphemy
to equallize the first borne of every creature, Col. 1. 15. with the Creator
himself, Romans 1. 25. and I suppose that blasphemy of the Beast, with seven
heads and ten horns, Revel. 13. 1, 3, 5, etc. and that mystery of iniquity
written in the forehead of the G. Whore, 17. 5. diametrally opposite to that of
the Fathers name, written in the forehead of the 144000, 14, 1, 7, 7, 3, etc.

As for that common evasion, applied to Christ as he is God, and as he is man,
it is contrary both to reason and Scripture, to limitate by so great a
disparity, as Hos. 11. 9. for I am God and not man, Isa. 31. 3. 40. 17.
implying contradiction, as he is, and as he is not, and is but a presumptuous
begging of that which is in question, and if it be illogicall to limitate by a
superior, or subordinate (as the Pope errs, not as he is Pope, but as he is
man) it is much more absurd to limitate by a disparate, and that of infinite
disparity, to omit that Luke 2. 40. the grace of God was with him, and Act. 10.
38. for God was with him, which were an idle tautalogie if he were God, only
he is called God by a metaphor, as Gabriell a man, Dan. 9. 21. and Judas a
devil, John 6. 70.

CHAP. 6.
THus we may perceive how by iniquity of time the real truth of God has been
trodden under foot by a verbal kind of Divinity, introduced by the Semipagan
Christians of the third Century in the Western Church, immediately upon the
ceasing of the Heathenish Emperors, who for their open hostility were likened
to a Lion, 2 Timothy 4. 17. as their successors to a Dragon, for their serpentine
subtilties, continuing 1260 years, begun by the first Nicen Council about 328,
and made Catholic by the Imperial decree at Thessalonica, 342, Hist. Tripart.
9. 7. but that prescription is no plea against God, and God be thanked, the
time of this general Apostasy is expired, the mystery discovered, and the
unity of God, Zach. 14. 9. come upon the stage, Covenant. The second
particular, that I cannot forbeate but to cry out with the people, it is
fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great, whiles I perceive that first
resurrection from Antichristian error, as Napier, and the calling of the Jews
coming so fast on, Romans 11. 15, etc. to make one sheepfold, Joh. 10. 16.
Wherefore to make the G. Whore stigmaticall, first, by her brand in the
forehead, Reveal. 17. 5. by that which is in the very frontispiece of all the
Catholics Confessions concerning the Trinity. Secondly, by prescription (or
mark in her hand) thereunto Revel. 13. 16. Thirdly, by her seat and place
notorious, by seven hills, and ten Kingdoms, 17. 9. Fourthly, by that so well
known name Latemos, 13. 18. as Moulin in his accomplishment of Prophecies.
Fifthly, by her persecution of the Saints, 12, 13, 7, 17. 6. Dan. 17. 11.
Sixthly, by a heathenish Polytheosie of many Gods, and Apotheosie of a man-God.
Seventhly, by her Tricotomy of the three Catholic professions, Revel. 16. 19.
holding with the Whore in tail general.

CHAP. 7.
HOwsoever Constantine by Gods providence was ordained for ceasing the
heathenish persecutions, yet had he no commission for setting up a new religion
of redivived Ethnicisme, as Mede, Revel. 11. 3. in imitation of the three sons
of Saturn, their three major Gods; the deifying of Hercules, Augustus, etc.
their Heroes; in forcing some more difficult and figurative texts to confirm
their inventions; whereas that which is most plain, common and commanded is the
measure of that which is more difficult and obscure; for which cause they are
termed Gentiles in the Revelation; and the true believers Jews. To pass by the
reports of Zosimus concerning the conversion of Constantine; we may observe by
those, Judges 8. 27. 2 Samuel 17. 23. 1 Kings 1. 5. 12. 28. Ier. 44. 17. how
Kings, Captains, and Counsellores, (albeit renowned) are not presidents for
Religion more the meaner men, as 1 Cor. 1. 27. 2, 6. so that such servile
cattle and men-admirers for advantage, Jude 10. are the very bain of all
ingenuity and Christianity.

CHAP. 8.
TO come to the first Nicen Council (the Load-star of the three following);
besides that humane Councils are but external and accidental means of truth;
it was falsified by Sozimus the Civilian concerning the point of Primacy; and
is generally condemned for there-baptization of the Cataphrygians; their three
and ten years penance; that men should pray rather standing then kneeling; and
is reproved by Hierome, for equallizing the History of Judith with the holy
Canon, besides that diverse of the best learned of them dissented from the rest
and major part, according to that Exodus 23. 2. also Calvine could not endure
that very God of very God in their Creed; for God being a most pure act, a
begotten God (to speak properly) is a most gross contradiction: And that
begotten not made, contrary to that, Romans 1. 3. Gal. 4. 4. generation being
proper to living and mortal creatures for continuance of their kind; thus by
going forth of men's buildings or systemes, as 2 Esdras 10. 54. transported by
some good Angel into the Wilderness, as Revel. 17. 3. I got a glympse not
only of the G. Whore, but of the Spouse of Christ, 12. 6. 21. 9. which things
although they may seem strange and new, the reason resides in the abolishing
of an old error, see Zech. 14. 7. etc. Isa. 30. 26. 2 Esdras 5. 4, 6. 22. For
mysteries they are either of things more hard to be understood as parables not
expounded, Matthew. 13. 11. prophesies not fulfilled, Ephesians 3. 3, 4. godliness
to a sensual worldly and wicked man, 1 Cor. 2. 14. or that cannot be
understood, as meerlyes in believing things that are not, especially express
contradictions concerning the unity and supremacy of God, as 2 Thessalonians. 2. 11.
Revel. 22. 15. For to multiply the Deity, or detract from its unity is
blasphemy, as all the Doctors define.

CHAP. 9.
BUt me thinks I smell a Fox or rather a Wolf, in the Fable, and unless the
Lord put to his helping hand of the Magistrate, for the manacling of Satan in
that persecuting power, Revel. 20. 2. there is little hope either for the
liberty of the Subject, or Law of God amongst us, Psalm. 119. 126. so this woe
will not depart until it rest in a poor and terrified remnant, as Revel. 11.
13. And I cannot understand what detriment could redound either to Church or
Common wealth by the toleration of religious, not antipoliticall, but rather
benefit, as we see by example in Holland and Poland.

CHAP. 10.
FOr that which was objected concerning Arrius his formidable end, it is rather
an argument of his equivocall perjury, etc. Hist. Tripart, 3. 10. like Ananias
and Saphira, Act. 5. or Judas 1. 18. then of the cause: As for that which is
commonly answered, that God is not divided but distingoished into three equal
persons, is as much as if they had not a real, but only a relative or
rational being or existence, as if essence and existence differed in God, or
in any thing whose kind consists in one individual: for hypostaticall union
and communion of properties, they are but real contradictions, and the
froglike croaking of the Dragon, the beast and false Prophet, Revel. 16. 13. by
virtue of a Hocus Pocus and a Babylonian mouth, thus after the precipice of
this Romish Jezabel, and the death of her two daughters, Homousia and Symousia
like Aholah, and Aholibah, Ezech. 23. I perceive how the Western Sun declineth
to its period and setting: And as for that third Reformation which succeeded
the Calvinian upon the Turkish Territories more remote from the Romish tyranny,
especially, about Anno 1560, in Transylvania, Lituania, Livonia, and Polonia,
we cannot expect to be complete before the revolution to the East (where it
first began) Revel. 7. 9, 9. 14, 16. 12. (there being 12 Bishops successively
at Antioch, unto the year 400, More's Chronoll. Magdeburgs Hist.
Antioch being the Metropolis of Syria, (famous for that, Acts 11. 6; and the
ten Persecutions, bounded on the East by Euphrates.

CHAP. 11.
AS for presumption, to profess that which God commands, yea, that first and
great Commandment I aver it to be none, Deuteronomy. 18, 20. and the son of Syrach 3.
23. 5. 10. be it opposed by never so many, or great; Numb. 14. 44. 16. 2. or
never so glorious titles of the orthodox Nicene Fathers, and the Pope his
Holiness, for that Job 32. 22. therefore, howsoever some object that it is
damnable to believe no more then what we can comprehend, as Job 11. 7. yet let
them consider that in the precepts necessary to salvation, we are to believe
what we may apprehend according to our best understanding, Mark 12. 33. Ier. 9.
24. this I say to the shame of such as shut their eyes against the most
illustrious and authentical testimonies of all or the most memorable and
approved times, places, and persons; hardly to be brought that ever they had
greater grand Fathers, etc. not allowing any more of authentic and classick
testimonies, then the most vain and improbable traditions amongst men; nor to
believe the Histories of Moses, Christ, etc. because they had not the happy
hour of St. Thomas, or others to be seeing, and sensible witnesses, as John
20. 27. 1 John 1. 1.

The Lord God of his most gracious goodness grant, that the more able and
ingenuous, like true and trusty soldiers of Jesus Christ, whose eyes the God
of this world has not blinded; would do their utmost endeavor to reduce the
rest from that long captivity of our spiritual Babylon, under that Man of sin;
and that God would prosper their endeavors that are studious of the sincere
Truth; and strive for the same to death, as the son of Syrach, 4. 28; and
defend justice for their life, to the exaltation of their Nation, as Prove. 14.
34; that releeve the oppressed, etc. as Isa. 1. 7; that so we may enjoy the
good things of the Land.

AMEN.
