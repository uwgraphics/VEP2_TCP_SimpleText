it co^^ it. If a man have any destre to know either the Stars or (...) nets, he
may by these directions eastly And them: for by serving the rising and setting
of the Planets he shall not (...) but know them and by observing what bright
star is next Moon on those nights abo^e mentioned, (...) caunot miss ^^^ing
out all those bright stars in or near the Zo^ia^h.
An exact way to find the true hour of the day (...) a walking staff divided
into 10 equal parts.
THe use of this Table following, is to find the true hour the day by the
shadow of a wa^king staff, being first ^^ded into 10 parts, and every one of
those parts dividen into more parts, and so is your staff divided into 100
pa^^^ Wherewith if you destre to know the true hour of the any, it upright,
and mark the length of the shadow with the (...) of your staff: find the
number of those par^s in the T^^^ following right against the day of the
Month, and on the you have the true hour of the day.

Example.
I desire the hour of the day upon the 20 of Day, there^^ set up my staff,
and find the length of the shadow to con^^ 14 parts, wherefore I look in my
Table for May, and the ^ay, and in that line toward the right hand I find 14,
(...) over it in the head of the Table I find 4 and 8, which is (...) hour of
the day, either 4 aftern. or 8 morn. Note that the lesser divisions are also
set down in the Table, and are to us^^ if need require, especially about midday.

The Use of the 2 former Tables.
BY the help of these 2 Tables you may know at what hour a^ all those stars
both rise, set, and come to the Meridian. Th^^ the Suns right Ascension, and
subtract it out of the stars Ascensi^^ you shall find in the second Column in
the first Table, and you (...) their rising, setting, and southing as it is
there set down: but (...) cannot make subtraction, then add 24 to the stars
Ascension; remainer shall be the true rising, setting or southing of the af^^
stars. Note that if after the subtraction be made there remain^ (...) then 12
hours, subtract 12 out of it, and the remainer is the N^^

Example.
Upon the 14 of April, I desire to know when all those stars the and south.
First I find the Suns right Ascension to be 2 hou. (...) min. and then I come
to the Table of the stars, and right again^ cida Corona, the first star in the
Catologue or Table I find 8. m^^ which I add 24 hours, and it is 24. ho. 8.
m. out of which I su^^ 2. hour and 9. min. and there remains 21 hours, and 59.
min. b^^ this is more then 12. I also cast away 12. then there remains 9^ and
59. min before noon, at which time Lucida Corona sets: (...) need not cast away
12. then it is before midnight, otherwise midnight. And thus you must do for
all those stars whose Ascen^^ less then the Suns. But if when the stars right
Ascension is most only subtract the Suns Ascension out of it, and you have
your (...) I find Arcturus rifing upon the 20 of January in the evening, a^^
fire to know to hear of the night, the same day the Suns righ^ tension is 20,
hou. 54. m. I find against Arcturus setting 6 hou^ 0. m. to which I add 24.
hours, and the sum is 30. hou^ (...) which I subtract 20, hou. 54. m. there
remains 9. ho. and 6. mi. th^^ hour of the night. Thus by knowing the hour of
the night, yo^ know the stars by observing on what point of the Compass the
and set on.
