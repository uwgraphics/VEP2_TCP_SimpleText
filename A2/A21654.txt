By the Queen
THE Queen's Majesty consyderyng the return of no small numbers of her
faithful Subjects, having truly and valiauntly served at Newhauen, and being
many of the same sick, or touched with infection of such sickness as reigned
there: has thought meet, because the same numbers shall return to sundry
places of her Realm, being clear from such contagious sickness, to will and
require her said Capteynes and soldiers, and every of them, to have
charitable and neyghbourly regard to the preservation of their neighbors from
infection, and to forbear for some season to be conuersaunt with any mo then
of mere necessity they ought. And for such soldiers as be poor, and have
any contagious sickness upon them, being no otherwise provided for, her Majesty
earnestly requires, and in Gods name charge, the principal officers, as well
Ecclesiastical as Civil, of all Cities, Towns, and Paryshes, where the same
poor sick soldiers shall of necessity come, to provide some remote places,
where the same poor and sick persons may be separated from conversation with
other being whole, and have relief by common provision and alms to be
ministered and given by the rycher, which beside that christian charity
requires it, the same is also requisite and expedient to be done by them
which be whole and rich, for their own preservation: For otherwise, they may
feel the sharp hand of God over them for their unmercifulness.

And because no persons should of malice or ignorance, have any mislykyng of
such faithful capteynes and soldiers, as shall return to their countries
and habitations, because the Town where they were in garryson, is left by
composition to the French king, as it was always so intended, upon
reasonable conditions: It is to be known and understand, that there wanted no
truth, courage, nor manhood in any one of the said garryson, from the highest
to the lowest, who were fully, yea rather as it were obstinatly, determined
with one full assent, to have abydden the whole force of France and their
helpers, to the uttermost of their lives. But when it pleased almyghtie God,
against whose will there is no standing, to permit the said garryson to be
visited with so great and incessable plage of infectuous mortal sickness, as
heretofore great noble armies have been, and thereby forced to yield and decline
from their enterprises: It was thought the part and office of Christian
wisdom, not to tempte the Almighty, nor to contend with the inevitable
inward mortal enemy of plage, assayling all sorts, as well the strongest as
the weakest, the armed as unarmed, the captains as the labourer, neither
repulsable by weapon, shot, nor ingin, and therefore ioynyng therewith the
enemies offers, not unreasonable, proceadyng of the opinion which they had
conceived by the sundry overthrows given to them by the Capteynes and
soldiers of the garryson, that they should never get the Town without
great effusion of blood on both parts, whereof they had lamentablye lost for
their part this last year, in their cyuill tumultes, more then in any wars,
as it is esteemed.vii. years before. The Queen's Majesty being advertised that
the Constable of France had by messages solicited the Earl of Warwyke, her
Majesty's lieuetenaunt, a Captain right nobly renowned, to come to some
communication, for the delyuery of the said Town, with honorable conditions,
whereby Christian blood might be saved on both parts, quietness and peace
might the rather follow betwixt both the Realms: was contented that the said
Earl and the counsel of that Town, should not thus lamentably contend and
strive any longer with the plague, with the which they had now for the space
of.v. or.vi. months continually fought, leesyng daily more and more great
numbers thereby: but should (considering he and his company had so nobly
acquitted them selves) accord to common with the said Constable, and hearing
his conditions to be (as they were reported) honorable, (which were, a free and
quiet departure in convenient time for the said Lieuetenaunt, Capteynes,
soldiers, and people, with all their artyllery, munitions, ships,
vessels, vittell, armure, weapon, and goods, any wise belongyng to her
Majesty, or to any English person) the said Lieuetenaunt should accord
thereunto.

Whereupon the said Liuetenaunt being with all the whole garrison (of their own
disposition) of a contrary determination, rather to hazard the rest of their
lives with the plague, and with the assaults of thennemy, whereof they had
abidden and repulsed some, then to leave the Town by treaty, comettyng with
the counsel and Captains there, and considering her Majesty's Princely mind
and intention toward the preservation of her subjects, whereof he had charge,
being in deed manyfestly and ineuitably subject still both to the plague, and
to the enemies approach, by the which they had possessed the entry of the
haven, and made sundry Bulwarks by large breaches saltable, and were entered
into the diches: was contented at length, to set apart their own great
stomakes, and by enclynyng to wisdom, to open their ears to the Constables
motions and offers. And so by treaty and honorable compact, accorded to
deliver the Town to the french king, after the space of eight days, or more,
if time so required, wherein he might honorably, safely, freely, and warlykely
retire by Sea the whole garrison under his charge, with all manner of riches,
artyllery, munition, and other things belongyng to any English person. For
the doing whereof, being him self hurt in the thygh with a shot at a breach,
he committed the principal charge thereof to sir Hugh Pawlet, sir Maurice
Denis, knights, and the knight Marshall master Randolph, who at this present
are therein occupied. And this is the truth of the just and necessary cause of
return of the said Lieuetenaunt, Capteynes, and garrison: Such a cause as has
constrained both Heathen and Christian Emperors, to do the like, or sometimes
things of less advantage to them selves. And therefore the courrages and
actiuities of the said garrison, having ben such, as thennemies have not let
by many means to recommende beyond their accustomed manner: And sythen it can
not be denied, but that the plage in the Town has herein brought that to
pass, that by man's force was either not possible, or otherwise not lykely: Her
Majesty doubts not, but all these her true, good, and valiant subjects,
having thus served, and now returnyng to their habitations, shall find at
this time (as they have well merited) favor, help, and charitable succor,
according to their estates, and hereafter honor, love, and praise of their
country, whylest they live.

Yeuen at Richemond the first day of August, the fyfth year of her Majesty's
reign.

God save the Queen.
