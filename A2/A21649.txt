duties.
ELIZABETH Dei gratia Angliae, Franciae and Hiberniae Regina, fidei defensor,
etc.
Maiori and Vicecomit. Ciuitatis London Salutem. Praecipimus vobis, quod statim
visis praesentibus in singulis locis infra ciuitatem praedictam, tam infra
libertates, quam extra, vbi magis expedire videritis ex part nostra publicas
Proclamationes fieri fac. in haec verba.
THe Queens Majesty meaning to use no extremity toward her Tenants,
although in some part she might upon occasion already given, has thought
meet to give knowledge to all her Farmors and Tenants within the City of
London, which ought to have paid their Rents, Tenthes, and other duties at
Michelmas last, or at the furthest before this time upon sundry great pains by
the order of her Laws, and have not, that they shall make payment to the
Collectour, or Receiver general of the said City, or into the receipt of her
Exchequer, within twelve days after this Proclamation. And if any person shall
herein make default, at this time, or hereafter, her Majesty must give order
to extend the Tenor of her Laws therefore provided as reason is.

God save the Queen. Et hoc sub periculo incumbenti nullatenus omittatis. T.
Me ipsa apud Westminster. 21. die Decembris. Anno regni nostri quinto. Marten.
Peripsam Reginam. etc.

Imprinted by Richard Judge, and John Cawood, Printers to the Queens Majesty.
