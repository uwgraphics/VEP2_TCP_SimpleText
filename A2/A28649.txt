THE Boat Swains Art, OR, The complete Boat Swain.

Wherein is showed a true proportion for the Masting, Yarding, and Rigging of
any Ship, whose Length, Breadth, and Depth is known: with Rules for the sizes,
and lengths, of all sorts of Rigging that belongs to any Ship.

Also the use of an opening scale, that if the length of the maine Mast be put
upon it with a pair of Compasses, you may measure upon the scale, the lengths
and thickness of all the other Masts and Yards; and also the sizes, the
lengths, and the number of Fathomes of every size, for the Rigging of any Ship,
without altering the scale.

By Henry Bond, teacher of Navigation, Surveighing, and other parts of the
Mathematics, in the Bulwark near the Tower.

The scale is made in Brass by Thomas Flower at the Dyall in the Bulwark: and
in Wood by Robert Bissaker at Ratcliffe over against the Red Lion Tavern.

Printed at London by Richard Cotes, for William Lugger, and are to be sold at
his shop at the Posterne Gate near the Tower. 1642.

To the Reader.
COurteous and Judicious Reader, thou have here presented to thee, an exact
method and direction, for the Masting, Yarding, and Rigging of any Ship
whatsoever: All that is expected from thee, is but thy acceptance, and a
Charitable censure; both which out of doubt thou will freely grant: the maine
end that is intended in it, is for the help and direction of young men, that
are willing to have some ground, for what they shall undertake in this kind,
and not to go on hand over head. If any shall reap any benefit by it (as out
of doubt many will) the Author has his desire. Vale.

TThe first thing we will begin withal is to find the length of the main
mast, for any ship whose length at the keele, the breadth at the beam, and the
depth in hold is known, which is done two several ways: The first, which is
the most Rational way, is to add the breadth and the depth of the ship
together and double it, and divide the product by 3. and the quotient is the
length of the Maine Mast in Yards. Example in the ship we have propounded, the
breadth 29 the depth 13 foot, those two added is 42 the double of 42 is 85.
that divided by 3. the quotient is 28 1/^ Yards, that is 85 foot, but we have
propounded out Mast to be but 84 foot.

A second way is thus, add the length of the Keele, the breadth of the beam
and the depth together, and to that Sum add the difference between the
breadth and twice the depth, and multiply the whole Sum by the breadth at the
beam, and the product divide by the former whole Sum, and the quotient is the
length of the Main Mast in Yardes. Example in the Ship we have propounded, the
length of the Keele 75 foot, the breadth of the beam 29 foot, and the depth
13 foot added together the Sum is 117 unto which add the difference between
twice the depth 26 and the breadth 29 which is 3 and the whole Sum is 121.
which multiplied by 29 the breadth at the beam and the product is 3569 which
divided by 121. the former whole Sum the quotient is 29 Yards, which is a yard
more and better, then it was the other way, but it is too long, and therefore
we commend the first way for the more rational way, and do persuade those
that have occasion to make use of that way.

Now having found the length of the Main Mast in this manner for any Shipp; we
have set down a Table of the lengths and thickness of all the Mastes and
Yards of the Ship we have propounded by means whereof, after the length and
thickness, at the partners of the Main Mast for any Sip is found. The
lengthes and thickness of all the other Mastes and Yards may be found by our
Table as follows: Suppose a Ship 63 foot by the the Keele, 25 foot breadth
at the beam, and 11 foot deep in hold, we desire to know the length and the
thickness of all the Mastes and yards; and first for the Main Mast, the
breadth at beam 25 foot, the depth 11 foot, their Sum 36. their double 72.
which divided by 3 the quotient is 24 Yardes, the length of the Main Mast,
which is 72 foot. To find the lengths and thickness of all the other, you
may do it by the Rule of Three, the lengthes in feet and the thickness in
inches, and the proportion is from the lengthes and the thickness of the Masts
and Yardes, for they are but a lineall proportion: That is:

As, 8, the length of our Maine-mast in the Table is to 72. the length of the
Maine-mast found so is 28, the thickness of our Mayne-mast in the Table to 24.
the thickness of the Maine-mast found at the partners; the thickness or the
Diameter at the hounes must be two third parts of that which it is at the
partners which in this, is 16 inches thicknes or Diameter. Or this proportion
of the lengths of the Mastes may be abreviated, for it is as 7 to 6. so is 28
to 24. and so we may proceed to find all the rest, as 7 to 6 so is 75 our
foremast to 74. the length of the foremast required; and so we may proceed for
all the other lengthes and thickness both of the Masts and Yards: but because
this is somewhat troublesome, and every one is not able to work the Rule of
Three in numbers, we have considered of a more easy and speedy way for the
performing of it, which is by an opening scale, having two lines drawn, one on
each side from the center, each line divided into 150. parts: and each part
into two parts, whose use is thus, take 72 from the Center on one side of the
scale in your Compasses the length of the Maine-mast found, and put it over in
84 and 84 the length of our Maine-mast in the Table, and keeping the scale
still at the same distance without altering it take the distance over with your
compasses between 28 and 28 the thickness of our Maine-mast in the Table, and
measure it on the side of the scale from the center, and it will end in 24. the
thickness of the Mast sought; and take it over in 75. the length of our
foremast and it will end in 64 the length of the foremast required, and take
it over in 25. the thickness of our foremast and it will end in 21 the
thickness of the foremast required, and in 74 the length of our Maine-yard in
the Tables, and it will end in 63. the length of the Maine-yard required, and
in 24. for the thickness and it will end in 21 the thickness required: and so
proceed for all the rest of the lengths and thickness without altering the
scale, and you shall find 56 the length of the bowsprite and 19 thickness,
and 53 the length of the fore-yard, and 17 the thickness, and 44 the length of
the Mizon-yard and 13 thickness, and 45 the length of the Mizon Mast, and 15
the thickness, and 43 the length of the Spritsaile yard, and 14 the
thickness, and 36 the length of the maine Topmast, and 12 the thickness, and
31 the length of the fore Topmast, and 11 the thickness, and 31 the length of
the maine Top-saile, and Crossieck yards, and 9, the thickness of the maine
Top-saile yard, and 6 the thickness of the Crossieck yard, and 27 the length
of the fore Top-saile yard, and 7 the thickness, and 23 the length of the
mizon Topmast, and 6 the thickness, and 18 the length of the maine Topgallant
mast and 6 the thickness, and 17 the length of the mizon Top-saile yard, and 4
the thickness, and 17 the length of the fore Top-gallant mast, and 5 the
thickness, and 16 the length of the main Top-gallant yard, and 5 the
thickness, and 14 the length of the fore Top-gallant yard, and 4 the
thickness, and 14 the length of the Spritsaile Topmast, and 4 the thickness,
and 12 the length of the Spritsaile Top-saile yard, and 3 the thicknes: By this
means we have performed the finding the lengthes and the thickness of all the
mastes and yardes belonging to our supposed ship of 63 foot by the keele, 25
foot by the beam, and 11 foot deep in hold, with wonderful ease and speed,
very exactly; and now we will go forwards, first to find the sizes of our
Rigging: secondly, to find the quantity of Rope of each size that will serve
our turn to rigge the ship completely: and thirdly, to find the length of each
Rope, that we shall have occasion to make use of in Rigging: all which shall be
performed with as much ease and speed as the former was for the mastes and
yardes, (number for number.) Here note by the way, that we could have given
the lengths of all the mastes and yardes by proportions from the length of the
maine mast, and so from one to another, but because our way that we have
propounded is far more easy and speedy in performance, I rather make use of
it, then of the other way.

Now first for the sizes of our Rigging we are to consider that it is but a
lineall proportion between the Diameter of the maine mast in our Table, and
the Diameter of the mast found, which proportion is, being abbreviated, as 7 to
6. so is one inch one tenth part the smallest Cordidge in our Table, to nine
tenths of one inch our smallest Cordidge for out supposed ship of 6^ foot by
the keele: and here we are to note that it is the circumference of the Cordidge
that we find, all which is performed without altering the scale, but let it
remain at the same opening it was at, to find the lengthes and thickness of
the Mastes and Yards. As for the smallest Cordidge of one inch, and one tenth
part, take the distance over between 11 and 11. which measured from the center
will end in 9. and more almost one half, which is 9 tenths of one inch, and
then put it over in 13 and 13. for our second size Cordidg of one inch and 1/10
in our Table, which measured from the center will end in 11. which is one inch,
and one tenth part for our second size, for our supposed ship, and so
proceeding on in the same manner for all the rest of our sizes, taking for one
inch, and 1/10 parts 18 and for two inches and 1/10 parts 22. and for 2 inches
^/10 parts 26. and for 3 inches 1/10 part, 31 and so in like manner for all the
rest, and taking for 14 inches, 140.

But here it may be objected that the greatest Cordidge in our Table is but 14
inches, and the extent of our scale is but to 150. how then shall we do if we
were to fit a ship, whose size of Cordidge would go beyond the end of our
scale? To which I answer, it may be done three ways: first, it may be done by
the Rule of Three in numbers, or else, secondly, (which is more pertinent to
our way of performing) by the scale, which is thus, I have a Ship to be Rigged,
the thickness of whose Maine-mast at the partners is 35 inches, I demand the
size of the maine stay, the size of the maine stay in our Tables is but 14
inches, this that we seek for must be more, the proportion between the
thickness of the Masts is as 18 to 35, which is as 4 to 5. In this case
because our scale goes but 150. we take the distance over between 70 and 70.
which is half the size of our maine stay and measure it from the center, and
it will end in 87 that is half the circumference of the Maine stay required
which being doubled is 175. that is 17 inches and one half, the circumference
of the maine stay required.

A third way by the scale, we may take the distance over between 14 and 14, as
the scale is numbered, which measured from the center, will end in 17 the size
of our maine stay required.

But to go forwards to find the rest of the sizes of the Cordidge for our
supposed Ship of 63 foot by the keele.

For our Cordidge of one inch ^/10 in our Table, we shall find by the scale one
inch 6/10 parts, and for 2 inches 2/10 parts, we shall find one inch 2/10
parts, and for 2 inches 6/10 parts, we shall find 2 inches 2/10 parts, and for
3 inches 1/10 parts, we shall find 2 inches ^/10 parts, and for 3 inches 5/10
parts, we shall find 3 inches ^/10 parts, and for 3 inches ^/10 parts, we
shall find 3 inches ^/10 parts, and for 4 inches 4/10 parts, we shall find 3
inches 8/10 parts, and for 4 inches, ^/10 parts, we shall find 4 inches 1/10
parts, and for 5 inches 2/10 parts, we shall find 4 inches 4/10 parts, and for
5 inches, 6/10 parts, we shall find 4 inches ^/10 parts, and for 6 inches,
1/10 part, we shall find 5 inches, 1/10 parts, and for 6 inches, 5/10 parts,
we shall find 5 inches 5/10 parts, and for 10 inches, 5/10 parts, we shall
find 9 inches, ^/10 parts, and for 14 inches we shall find 12 inches ^/10
parts: so now we have sized all our Cordidge for our supposed ship of 63 foot
by the keele, for Rigging proportionable to the sizes of the Cordidge in our
Table.

The second thing concerning the Cordidge is to find what quantity of each
size will serve to rigge our supposed Ship of 63 foot by the keele. You may
see in our Table we have set down the Sum of the number of Fathomes of each
size at the end or conclusion of the size, as for the first size of one inch
and one tenth part the Sum is 23^. Fathomes, but because this number is
greater then the length of our scale, we take the tenth part of it, and so we
take it over between 23 and ^3, the scale remaining still at the same angle,
or opening it was, at the first, and measuring it from the center, it will end
in very near 20. which being again increased or multiplied by 10. it will be
2^0 Fathom for the Cordidge of the least size, to rigge our supposed Ship
completely.

For our second size which in our Table is 691. Fathom, we shall find 59.
which is 590 Fathom, and for our Third size which is in the Table, ^51.
Fathom, we shall find 30. which is 300. Fathom, and for our fourth size*
which is in the Table 838. Fathom, we shall find 71 * which is 715. Fathom,
and for our fifth size, which is in the Table, 728. Fathom, we shall find,
62, which is 625. Fathom, and for our sixth size, which is in the Tables, 764.
Fathom, we shall find 65 which is 655. Fathom, and for our seventh size,
which is in the Tables, 36^. Fathom, we shall find 31 which is 315. Fathom,
and for our eighth size which is in the Tables, 85. Fathom, we shall find 72.
which is 72. Fathom, and for our ninth size which is in the Tables, 168.
Fathom, we shall find, 14 which is 145. Fathom, and for our tenth size, which
is in the Tables, 182. Fathom, we shall find 15 which is 155. Fathom, and
for our eleventh size which is in the Tables, 220. Fathom, we shall find 19.
which is 190. Fathom, and for our twelfth size, which is in the Tables, 232.
Fathom, we shall find 20. which is 200. Fathom, and for our thirteenth size,
which is in the Tables, 321. we shall find 27 which is 275. Fathom, and for
our fourteenth size, which is in the Tables, 43. Fathom, we shall find 37.
which is 37. Fathom, and for our fifteenth size, which is in the Tables 23.
Fathom, we shall find 20. which is 20. Fathom, and for our last size, which
is in the Tables 16. Fathom, we shall find 14. Fathom.

But here it will be objected, that in our Tables we have put down too much
variety of Rigging, and that there is not so much required for every ordinary
ship: for answer whereunto, and what course to take, where any man is not
disposed to have his ship so completely Rigged* as we have propounded, go to
the Tables, and take out the numbers, that are against the Cordidge of every
Size, that you intend to make use of, and add the numbers together, then take
over the distance in your Compasses from the scale, of the whole Sum, or the
tenth part as you havr occasion, as is before directed, and measure it from the
center, and you shall see the number of Fathomes required of that size, although
you rigge not your ship so completely as we have propounded, always
remembering the Scale must remain still at the same opening it was, at the
first.

Example.
Suppose our supposed ship of 63. foot by the keele, it being winter, should
not be Rigged with Topgallant masts, nor with Mizon, nor Spritsaile Topmasts,
then we would know how many Fathom of our fourth size Cordidge will serve our
turn; we go to our Table of 2 inches 2/10 parts, and take out the numbers
against all the other Cordidge, (leaving out that which is for the Topgallant
masts, and for the mizon, and Spritsaile Topmastes) and add them together, and
the Sum is 590. of which I take the tenth part, which is 59. Then I take over
the distance with my Compasses upon the scale, between 59 and 59, and measure
it from the center, and it ends in 50 which is 505. Fathom of Cordidge of our
fourth size of one inch, 9/10 parts, which was the size we found for 2 inches
2/10 parts, as you may see before.

Now to proceed to the finding of each particular Cords length, there is no
more difficulty in it then there was in the finding of the whole number of
Fathomes of each size, but for the better explayning of it we will set down
some examples of some Cords that the test may be found by them without any
Scruple.

Example.
We desire to know the length of our maine Topsaile Braces for our supposed
ship of 63. foot by the keele, looking in our Table we find them in our third
size of 1 inch, ^/10 parts, and their length double is 48 Fathom (note in our
Table every Cord that is double is put down, single and double, with Fa. at
the top of each signifying fathomes;) so I take over the distance with the
Compasses upon the scale over between 48 and 48. which measured from the
Center shall end in 41. that is 41 Fathom, for the length of our maine
Topsaile Braces double, for our supposed ship of 63. foot by the keele, and so
if we look for our fore Topsaile lifts, we shall find them to be in our
Table of Cordidge of 2 Inches 1/10 parts, 36. Fathom, and for our supposed
ship we shall find them to be 31. Fathom, and fo^l^ur Topsaile Cluelines in
our Table of 2 Inches 6/10 parts, we shall find 60 Fathom, which for our
supposed ship we shall find to be 51. Fathom, and for our fore lifts, which
in our Table is 40 Fathom, we shall find them for our supposed Ship to be by
our scale 34 Fathom, and for our maine Topsaile halliards, in our Table we
shall find 44. Fathom, which for our supposed ship by our scale we shall find
to be 37 Fathom, and for our maine bowlings in our table is 34 fathom, which
we shall find by our scale to be 29. Fathom, and for our fore halliards in
our Table is 30. Fathom, which we shall find by our scale to be 26. Fathom.

Thus we have exemplyfied in the finding of the lengths of some particular
Cords, which is instruction sufficient for the finding of the lengths of all
the rest, and so we suppose we have performed all that we promised to
perform with ease and speed by a scale, for the Complete Rigging of any ship;
and now we will proceed to set down some other provisions and Cordidge that
are necessarily required in a ship, and so we will conclude this Tract.

A Table of some other Cords and Ropes that are of necessity in a ship, and are
here put down for their lengths and sizes according to our former Table of
Cordidge for our propounded ship.

YOu are to take notice that these last Cords and Ropes are sized and their
lengths are proportioned according to our Ship that we have propounded of 75
foot by the Keele, for which our former Tables are made. Now it remains that
we speak somewhat of the sizing of Cables.

Your sheat Cable is commonly so many half inches about as your ship is breadth
in feet at the midship Beam.

Now our propounded Ship to which our Tables are made is 29 foot at the
midship Beam, therefore the Sheate Cable must be 15 inches about, and to find
the sizes of the rest of your Cables, you may do it by the weight of your
Anchors in this manner.

Suppose your sheate Anchor be 15 hundred weight, and your Cable 12 inches, and
you have another Anchor 9 hundred weight, you desire the size of your Cable for
it.

For the answer to this and the like demands, I have caused two lines to be put
down on the side of the scale; the one of equal parts containing 385 parts,
and the Tens and Fives drawn out, and it is numbered at every 50, thus, 50,
100, 150, etc. The other line of unequal parts begins at 1, and ends at (...)
and is numbered to every unite, and each unite is divided from five to ten by
fives, and from ten to (...) by tens, each unite into ten parts.

First I take 9 upon the opening scale from the center, the weight of the
second Anchor, and put it over in 15, and 15, the weight of the first Anchor,
and keeping the scale so, I look against 12 in the unequal parts, and in the
equal parts against it are 72. then I take the distance over upon the opening
scale between 72, and 72, and measure it from the center, and it ends in 43
Lastly, I look 4^ in the equal parts, and against it in the unequal parts is
9 1/10 that is 9 1/10 inches the Circumference of the Cable for the Anchor of 9
hundred weight which was required.

Or otherwise the Cables may be proportioned from the burden of the Ships in
this manner.

Suppose that a Ship of 300. Tun have a sheate Cable of 15 inches about, what
shall be the Circumference about of the Sheate Cable of a Ship of 115 Tun?
Here because the greater number of Tuns is more then is upon our scale, we
take one quarter of 300. which is 75. and one quarter of 115 which is 29
nearest, and the proportion is all one: so I take 29. from the center and put
it over in 75, and 75, and so keep the scale. Next I look against 15, in the
unequal parts, and against it in the equal parts is 112. then I take over the
distance between 1112 and 112 and measure it from the center and it ends in 43
then I look against 43 and in the unequal parts, against it are 9 3/10 that
is 9 3/10 inches, the circumference about of a Sheate Cable for a ship of 115
Tun according to the former supposition, and as it was found before; and so
the sizes of all the rest of the Cables may be found from one ship to another
after the same manner.

It may be objected that the stays of the middle masts may fail to hold in
proportion according to the lengths of the middle masts in all ships, because
the distance between the maine mast and the fore mast may not be
proportionable in all ships according to their lengths, we suppose it to be
so, yet our scale performs it exactly.

Example.
In our propounded ship of 75 foot by the keele, the maine mast 84 foot, the
depth in hold 13 foot, and 5 foot between decks is 18 foot, which
subtracted out of 84 rest 66 foot, the height of the mast above the decks;
now commonly the distance between the maine mast and fore mast is three fifts
of the length of the Ships keele, which in this ship that we have propounded
is 45 foot (and the distance of the mizon mast from the maine mast is half as
much as the distance between the maine mast and the fore mast,) But to
proceed, and to keep our selves within the Compass of our scale, we reduce
the height of the mast above the decks, and the distance between the maine
mast, and fore mast into yard, and the one is 22 yards and the other is 15
yards, these two I seek in the line of unequal parts, and against 22 there is
in the equal parts 242. and against 15 is 112 these two I add together and
their Sum is 354 which I seek in the line of equal parts, and against it in
the unequal parts is 26 6/10 that is 26 6/10 yards, the length of the maine
stay besides the Collar.

If it happen that the equal parts that belong to the height of the maine mast
above the decks, and the distance between the maine mast and the foremast
added together be above 385 then take the half of each in yards, and double
the length you find, and that shall be the length of the maine stay in yards.

Example.
The distance between the maine mast and foremast is 15. yards, for which we
take half which is 7 against which of the unequal parts* in the equal parts,
is 28. and for the height of the maine mast above the decks being 22 yards we
take 11 against which of the unequal parts, in the equal parts is 60 which
added to 28 is 88 which I look in the equal parts and against it in the
unequal parts is 13 3/10 which being doubled is 26 6/10 that is, 26 6/10
yards, for the length of the maine stay besides the Collar as it was found
before.

Thus we have finished what was intended, for this business of masting,
yarding, and Rigging of any ship whatsoever. But because our Boate-swaine shall
be Complete according to our title, we will further show by our scale to find
the weight of the Cordidge (of each size that shall serve to Rigge any ship
whatsoever) as we will exemplify ^it by the Cordidge of our supposed ship of
63. foot by the keele: first we are to take notice that in all our Cordidge
under 2 6/10 inches, we are to look the size in the unequal parts, and make it
ten times as much as it is, as for one inch and 5/10 parts to look 15. and to
take half the number of equal parts against it, as against 15. is 112. the
half is 56 and always take 50. from the center, and put it over in the said
half of the equal parts, then take the distance over in 87, and 87 and
measure it from the Center, and that shall be the number of fathomes of that
Cordidge that weighes one quarter of one hundred weight.

Example of our third size for our supposed Ship of 63 foot by the Keele,
which size is one inch 6/10 parts, taking for it 16. as is before said, and
looking it in the unequal parts, there is against it in the equal parts 128.
the half is 64. Then I put over 50. in 64. and take the distance over in 87.
and 87, and measure it from the center, and it ends in 68. that is, in 68
Fathom of that Cordidge to weigh one quarter of one hundred weight; so then I
take 28 from the center the number of pounds in one quarter of a hundred, and
put it over in 68, then I take the distance over between 30, and 30, the tenth
part of the sum of the Cordidge of the third size, and measure it from the
center and it ends in 12 1/^, which multiplied by 10, is 123 pound, the weight
of 300 fathom of our Cordidge of 1 inch 6/10 parts, which is our third size.

For Cordidge between 2 6/10 inches and 5 inches take the one half of the
size, and do with the half as in the last, only at the last take the distance
between 43 and 43 and measure it from the center which shall be the number of
fathomes in half one hundred weight, or if you take it between 87 and 87 it
shall be the number of fathomes ^^ one hundred weight. Example of our seventh
size Cordidge for our supposed Ship which is 3 inches, the half is 1 inch 5/10
parts, for which we look 15 in the unequal, and in the equal parts against
it 112 the half is 56: so I put over 50 in 56 * and take the distance between
4 and 13, which measured from the center shall end in 39, that is 39 fathom to
weigh half one hundred weight of 3 inch Cordige; so I put over 20 for 2
quarters in 39, and then I take the distance over between 31 and 31 for 315
Fathom, the whole Sum o^ that Cordidge, which measured from the center shall
end in 16. that is 16 quarters of one hundred weight, that is four hundred
weight for the quantity of that Cordidge For Cordidge above 5 Inches to find
the weight and whole quantity of that; we must seek the size of tha in the
unequal parts, as it is, and take the equal parts against it and put over 20
in it, then take the distance between 87 and 87 and measure it from the center
and it shall end in the number of Fathomes that weighs half one hundred
weight. Example of our fifth size which is 9 inches and is 20 Fathom, against
9 of the unequal parts in the equal parts is 40 I put over 20 in 40 and take
the distance between 87 and 87 which measured from the Center ends in 43. that
is 4 Fathom, and 1/10 of that Cordidge to weigh half one hundred weight: Then
I put over 20 for 2 quarters in 43. and take the distance over between 20 and
20 the number of Fathomes of that size, and measure it from the center, and it
ends in 9 that is 6 quarters and one third part or 2 hundred one quarter and 9
pound for the whole quantity of that Cordidge. This which is exemplyfied in
these three particulars is sufficient instruction for all the rest, and now
having made (in regard of instruction) our Boate-swaine Complete, we leave it
to his practice and so conclude.

FINIS.
