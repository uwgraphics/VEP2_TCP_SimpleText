A CONGRATULATORY POEM TO HER MOST Sacred Majesty, etc.
THE Mighty BLESSING is at last arrived;
Heaven has, at last, the Wondrous WORK achieved.
Long did the ALMIGHTY pause, and long debate;
For MONARCHS are not fashioned at a Heat.
So the first Nations, that were blessed by Heaven,
Had the Eternal WORD by Promise given.
The Faithful did the Coming GOD believe,
And even that Faith alone had Power to save.
If Gods we may with Humane Things compare,
(For Gods and Kings allied most nearly are)
This is the Second Birth the World ever knew,
So long Expected, so much Wanted too.
Like the first sacred Infant, this will come
With Promise laden from the Blessed Womb,
To call the wandering, scattered Nations home.
Adoring PRINCES shall arrive from far,
Informed by ANGELS, guided by his Star,
The Newborn Wonder to behold, and greet;
And Kings shall offer Incense at his Feet.
Hail, Royal BOY! whose Coming is designed
To calm the Murmurs of all Humane Kind.
On thy great Birth, Depending- Monarchs wait:
From thee the Universe expects its Fate.
This glorious PROSPECT, like the sacred Law,
Stints factious Crowds, and keeps the World in awe;
Breaks their consulted Measures, and o'erthrows
All the Designs aspiring STATES propose;
Arrests the Wheel, in spite of Fortune's Hand,
And leaves the World's vast Business at a Stand.
And you, blessed QVEEN, to whom ALL HAIL belongs
From Angels, rather than from Mortal Tongues;
Whose Charms of Beauty, Wit and Virtue joined
To choose you Second Blessed of Womankind.
ALL HAIL, --
O Sacred VESSEL, fraught with England's STORE;
(A PRIZE more valued, ATLAS never bore;)
Guard safe our TREASVRE to the wished for Shore.
And you, Immortal Powers, who have begun
Your Noblest FABRIC; let your WORK go on:
The Royal YOVTH with all those Charms adorn,
The World adores in his bright MOTHER'S Form:
His Soul, by his Illustrious SIRES, complete:
All Hero, all Resolved, Divinely Great.
Where are ye, O ye once officious NINE,
That on a Theme so glorious, and sublime,
Your Voices are not turned to noblest Song?
But, Oh! your Lutes are on the Willows hung:
Your loved BRITANIA listens now no more;
MARS frights her from the soft Castalian Shore;
Upon whose Banks, beneath your Shades, each Day,
The ravished Nymph, charmed with your Numbers, lay.
But from your Groves the fickle Maid is gone.
And all your boasted Harmony's undone.
But once more tune your Lutes and Voices high;
Your tenderest Strains, and noblest Numbers try:
Raise those dejected Eyes, in Sorrow dressed,
And view the PROSPECT of the dawning East.
A young APOLLO, rising from the Gloom,
Dressed in his Father's brightest Rays, shall come;
(Dispersing all the baneful Mists of Night)
And bless the Earth with New- created LIGHT;
Make all the Face of Nature sweet and gay,
Revive her Birth, and triumph over the Day.
Beneath his Feet Eternal Spring shall spread,
And blossom from the Luster round his Head.
He the faint Muses shall anew inspire,
And from his Beams, kindle their useful Fire:
His Right Hand Crowns, his Left shall Laurels give;
And POETS shall by Patron-PRINCES live:
On all shall scatter Plenty, Joy and Peace,
Unite the World, and make Dissension cease.
And you, Dread Monarch! never to be confined
In any glorious Act you have designed;
Who, like wise Heaven, need but decree alone,
And with the Thought, the mighty Task is done:
Who for a stubborn Nation's Glory toil,
And court her to be Great against her Will.
When you esteemed her worth your Royal Care,
You gave her this last Blessing, of an HEIR.
O happy KING! to whom a Son is born!
What more can Fortune, Heaven, and You perform?
Behold, with Joy three prostrate Nations come:
ALBION, HIBERNIA and old CALEDON
Now join their Interests, and no more dispute,
With saucy Murmurs, who is Absolute;
Since, from the Wonders of your Life, it is plain,
You will, you shall, and must for ever Reign.
FINIS.
A Congratulatory POEM TO THE King's Most Sacred Majesty, ON THE HAPPY BIRTH OF
THE PRINCE of WALES.

A CONGRATULATORY POEM TO THE King's Most Sacred Majesty, etc.
JOY to the Greatest MONARCH of the Earth!
As many Joys as this Illustrious BIRTH
Has Elevated Hearts! As Endless too,
As are the VOWS we Offer up for You.
" Oh Happy KING! to whom a SON is Born!
" What more could Heaven for this B ss'd Land perform?
Long with Prophetic Fire, Resolved and Bold,
Your Glorious FATE and FORTUNE I foretold.
I saw the Stars that did attend Your REIGN,
And how they Triumphed over Great Charles's Wain.
Far off I saw this HAPPY DAY Appear;
This Jubilee, not known this Fifty Year.
This Day fore told, (Great SIR!) that gives you more*
Than even Your Glorious Virtues did before.
No MONARCH's Birth was ever Ushered in
With Signs so Fortunate as this has been.
The Trinity Snnday.
Holy Trinity his BIRTHDAY claims,
Who to the World their best Loved Blessing sends.
Guarded he comes, in Triumph over FATE,
And all the Shining HOST around him wait.
Angels and Saints, that do his Train Adorn,
In Hallelujahs Sing, A KING IS BORN!
Blessed St. Margaret 's Day.
MARGARET, Scotlands Royal Saint and Queen,
The last Great Branch of all the Saxon Line,
Waits on this HAPPY BIRTH; and does Declare
He, in her Right to Saxons, is the HEIR.
^n the Famed Room, by happy Fate brought forth,
Where Charles II. James II.
Two Illustrious KINGS received their Birth.
The LESSONS for This Day, by Chance Divine, The Morning Lesson for the Day.

Appeared as they were Ordered by Design.
The First, the Holy PROPHET did Unfold
When he the Birth of the MESSIAH told.
The Words are These; Matthew. 3. 12.
His Fan is in his Hand,
And he shall thoroughly purge the Floor or Land,
Gathering the Wheat into the Granary:
Then all One FAITH, at least One SOUL shall be.
" The ANGEL next the PATRIARCH did Inform, The Evening Lesson, Genesis 18. 10.

" That ISAAC, Chosen ISAAC, should be Born.
ASTROLOGERS Divine! that when the Sun
Is Mounted to his Full Meridian,
It Is Lucky to be Born; and does Portend
Long Life, that can by no Misfortune end.
This, in its Summer- Solstice views the Light,
Breaks out, and makes our Longest Day more Bright.
Methinks I hear the Belgic LION Roar,
And Lash his Angry Tail against the Shore.
Enraged to hear a PRINCE OF WALES is Born:
Whose BROWS his Boasted Laurels shall Adorn.
Whose Angel FACE already does express
His Foreign CONQVESTS, and Domestic PEACE.
While in his Awful little EYES we Fined
He Is of the Brave, and the Forgiving KIND.
All Joy Great QVEEN! -- if to your Happy Store
Our Grateful Prayers, and Wishes can add more.
Your Blessed DELIVERANCE to Congratulate,
The Adoring World is Prostrate at your Feet.
Where TEARS of Joy, and Humble VERSE I lay
Too mean a Trophy for this GLORIOUS DAY:
Inspired by Nothing but Prophetic Truth,
They Boast no other Fire, no other Worth.
Full of the JOY, no LINES Correct can write,
My Pleasure's too Extreme for Thought or Wit.
Charmed to Excess, alas! I strive in Vain,
In Scanty VERSE my Transports to Explain
Too Vast for Narrow NVMBERS to Contain.
FINIS.
