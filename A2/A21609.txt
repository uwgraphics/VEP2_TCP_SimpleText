A Proclamacion declaryng the Queen's Majesty's purpose, to keep peace with
France and Scotland, and to provide for the surety of her Kingdoms.
ALthough it is euidentlye seen and judged upon, not only by the natural
borne subjects of the Crown of England: but also by many strangers in all
parts of Christendom, how many and great occasions have been given now of
late time, and so continued by the French, as well to doubt and fear their
invasion of this Realm, chiefly by the way of Scotland, as also to apply
with all speed, convenient power to withstand the same. specially to wards
Scotland: yet the Queen's most excellent Majesty, consyderyng that there may
be diversity of opinions conceived of her proceadynges in this behalf, has
thought mete briefly and plainly to notify her Majesty's certain purpose
and intent, with the just occasions given ^herof.

first her Majesty of her good and gracious nature is content to think that
the injurious pretense made by the Queen of Scotland to this Realm so many
manner of ways, has been bred and issued only out of the hearts of ^he
principalles of the house of Guise, to whom the chief governance of the
crown of France now of late has ^appened, and that nether the French king,
being by reason of his young years not so capable of such an enter^ryse, nor
the Queen of Scotts his wife being also in her minority, nor yet the princes
of the blood royal, and ^ther e^tates of France (to whom heretofore in
ancient time, the governance of thaffayres of that realm in ^he kings
minority has belonged) have imagined and intended of them selves such an
unjust, improbable, and ^o dangerous an enterprise and attempt as this is,
and appears to be to all indifferent men.

And consyderyng the said house of Guise, for their own private advancement,
having no other mean to practyse the same, but by exaltyng of their nece the
Queen of Scotts, in whose respect they intermeddle with the governance of
France at this present, have thus injuriously and insolently set forth, and in
time of peace conti^ued in publyke places, the arms and claim of these
kingdoms of England and Irelande, in the name of their ^ece the Queen, beside
other notable reproaches, and that (as it is by diverse, and so very lykely
reported) without ^haduice of the princes of the kings blood, and other great
personages, or of the sage and long experimented ^ouncellours of that
kingdom: and for the prosecution of this their unjust and ambicious purpose,
have also used ^he authority of the king and Queen their nece (being
unnatural for her) to enterprise the euiction of the crown of Scotland, out
of the power of the natural people of the land, and thereby to proceade with
such force, as under that color they have already partly, and partly
hereafter mean to send thither to invade this kyngedome of England: which
although they have caused to be unjustly and dishonourablye claymed so many
ways by their ^ece: yet they well know that otherwise than by the way of
Scotland they can never effectually, according to their desires offend with
any evident danger. Therefore her Majesty having had the taste in many
calamities of Gods singular goodness, and knowing the justice of her cause, and
the natural obeysaunce and love of her true ^ubiectes, and taking these
insolent attemptes to be but thabuse of the said house of Guise, during the
minority of the King and Queen, without any consent of the greater states of
France, and being most desirous of her own nature and judgment to keep peace
with all Princes, and (even in this hard time of dealyng) also with the
king^ome of France and Scotland, and with all the subjects thereof: Does give
to understand to all manner of people, that although her Majesty has been
forced to put in order to her great charges, certain force both by sea and
^ande, for the safegarde of her kingdom, being thus impeched and challenged by
words, and so approached with ^orce, and manassed with much greater from day
to day: yet her Majesty means not, nor intends any manner cruelty,
hostility or war, but only seeks and wysheth, and so has diverse times
plainly and friendly required of the Cardynall of Lorrayn and his brother, and
by means of them, of the French king also, that these insolent tytles and
claymes might cease and be revoked, and that there might be such a quiet and
natural governance granted to the people of Scotland, that they might (...)
in their due obedience to their sovereign Lady (which they offer) without
further oppression and fear of conquest, and consequently that the men of
war of France in Scotland might be revoked, being by reason of the former
proceadynges of France, in their claymes against this kingdom over dangerous
to be suffered so nygh England. And for the more speed therein, it has been
offered that they should also have safeconducte by water or by land, or by both,
with all favor and suertie that might be showed or devised for their
departure, and according to their ceassyng from arms, her Majesty's power by
sea and land, should also at one instaunt accordyngly cease and be ceased,
and thereby all unkindness to be buried and forgotten, and a stable peace made.

To which godly, reasonable, and honorable sundry requests: her majesty can
by no means get any sufficient answer, although much time has been herein
spent, to her majesty's excessive charges, and to the manifest delay of
concord.

And finally her majesty declares, that she does and will keep, and continue
good peace with the kingdom of France, and the kingdom of Scotland as long
as no plain invasion shall be made by any of them upon her countries, dominions
or people, and will procure by all good and fair means that concord may be
had in Scotland, and the frenchmen of war that will withstand the same, may
depart thence without harm, and in suertye, and if they will not, then her
majesty must of necessity after al these other good means used, and after al
these delays made by France, attempt to compel them to depart thence, and
otherwise to show no extremity nor violence to any manner person of France or
Scotland.

And therefore her majesty straytly charge al manner her subjects, of what
estate so ever they be, that they shall use with favor and friendship, all the
french kings subjects, and shall permit them to traffic al trades of
marchaundise within this realm, in such sort as in times of best peace has been, and ought to be used, except they shall be provoked by any hostility of any
of the part of France to defend them selves, or their country, And like wise
that all her majesty's subjects shall use good and honorable speech of the
kingdom and nation of France, and although these late intolerable injuries,
have been committed in France against this crown of England: yet to judge
thereof no otherwise then her majesty of her good nature is pleased to think
and judge.

And finally they shall make no other preparations to war but only such as
may serve for the defense of such wrongs or attemptes, as percase shall be
made contrary to her majesty's expectacion upon this realm by the french upon
the further instigation of the said house of Guise, having in their hands the
principal governance of the king and queen, until it shall further appear
whether the said kingdom and nation of France shall mean any further plain
invasion of this realm, and so her majesty's present opinion be misconceyued.
Whereof although her majesty would be very sorry for the hinderaunce of common
peace in christendom which she most favors: yet it is not to be doubted,
but almighty god shall assiste the power of this kingdom to escape all such
danger, and honorably as case shall require to avenge it self.

And for better intelligence hereof to al manner of persons: Her majesty has
willed this to be proclaimed in English and French, that although the same
have been specially declared to the french king and to the said princypalles
of Guise in France, and also to the dowagre Queen in Scotland, and to all the
ambassadors of France here resident (whereunto no sufficient answer can be
obtained): yet it should not be hid from others that percase might be induced
otherwise to think or judge than the very truth is.

yeuen at her Majesty's palaice of Westminster the. xxiiii. day of March. M. D.
Lix. the second year of her Majesty's reign.
God save the Queen.
