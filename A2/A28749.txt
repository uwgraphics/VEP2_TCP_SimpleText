CHRIST Mighty in Himself and Members: revealed In some short Expressions by
way of CATECHISM. Wherein is demonstrated, that according to the scripture
(sense and phrase) and the experience of them that do believe, the saving and
joyful knowledge of God and Man, (and althings else that relate to either) is
alone in the Spirit, by Jesus Christ.

To which is added (occasionally) a hint of the Nature of the kingdom of God
(as it is even now to Faith.)

By R. BACON, a Companion with them, that have not the faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with respect of persons.

LONDON, Printed by J.M. for Giles Calvert, at the sign of the black-spread
Eagle, at the West end of Paul's. 1646.

To The Right Honorable Lady ELIZABET, Viscountesse Say and Seal.
MADAM
GIve me leave as an acknowledgment of your constant respect unto me, since I
had an opportunity to serve you in the Lord (as I had ability to put this
little book into your Ladyships hands, whiles God put it in your heart, and
enrich you heavenward with the glory and substance of it.

Right Honorable Lady, God is witness as elsewhere, so in your family, I sought
to know nothing, save Christ, and him Crucified; neither indeed is there left
to me any other thing to glory in, save the Cross of our Lord Jesus, which I
judge no unhappiness at all; for I could wish it might be once again, as
anciently it was, the only Christian glory: For without all controversy, if
ever the breach in Christendom, and in particular, that in this Land, as
touching Religion, be effectually made up again, as in the first times (as is
expected) it must be by casting that Lignum Jun. Exodus 15.25, comp. with Rev. 8
11
Wood into these bitter and troubled waters; for such a Rev. 22.2
tree there is, (and it can be none but Christ) that is only sufficient, for
the healing of these distempered Nations. Oh therefore that they were once
wise, to forbear this clashing, and dashing themselves in pieces, one against
another, for matters external, trivial, and Circumstantiall in Religion: and
would at length content themselves, with that which is alone saving, and
everlasting: and account it honor, and happiness enough, in matters
appertaining to God, to be a Christian, which is scarce the alone glory, of any
this day on earth; yet the condition of al other, is but as the grass of the
field, for he only [the Christian] lives, and reigns, a King to GOD, for
evermore: That such a one, as such a one, may be had in account again, all the
Kingdom, all the world over, Madam is the constant prayer, and endeavor of

Yours (most ready) to serve you in the things of Christ, R. Bacon.

A word, to the Christian READER.
HAving made a promise of printing another Catechism (in writing laying by me)
which upon consideration I found many ways inconvenient to perform; I found my
self inclined to communicate, after this manner, something of what GOD has
given me to know, as touching the Mysteries of life, in the composure of which,
in some sort, I apprehended the height and glory of John's assertion, that if
all the things concerning Jesus should be written, the world would not contain
the books; many are the preachers of this Mystery of GOD (for it is the whole
business of heaven and earth to make it out); Yet alas how little of it is this
day understood! there is no question, the smoke (according to the prediction)
of the bottomless pit has, in these last times, exceedingly darkened this sun;
the removal of which, has been the expectation of GODS little flock, these
diverse hundred years; it is effecting now, we hope, more then ever; and oh that
it were quite over once! that we might the same day (as Dr Stoughton in his
latin Epistle to the Pr, of Transylvania
Doctor Stoughton in the light and might of faith spoke) at one solemnize the
Funerals of the Beast, together with the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. May not
we say it is begun? GOD is pouring out of his Spirit now, more then ever, since
the first times; and the bride is hereupon making her self ready (who that are
the bridegroomes friends, can forbear to joy) for he that has the bride is the
bridegroom. Notwithstanding I may truly say, unless God build the house, which
we intend for his dwelling place, in vain do we set upon the work. And yet I
fear it has been, and is welnigh the error of most builders, (for 'twas theirs
of old) to endevor to build a house for GOD, but yet without him; for we see
few of those buildings ^^and, which men have labored in, which argues ^hey
were of man's making, and so had (as it now appears) like himself, their
foundation in the dust. GOD give us therefore wisdom, at length to build upon
that foundation, which himself has laid and according to it; that we may be no
more ashamed, as they are, whos^ works are at this day, a^ once revealed, and
consumed. And that by the fi^^ of Gods own kindling, (...) is that which now
trouble^ and torments (almost) al the earth: because it dete^^ the folly of
those that dw^^^^ thereon; whatever light (...) truth there is in this li^^
piece: it is a spark enki^dled from that fire; For chose rather, through the
grace of GOD (as it was most meet I should) to make it my guide, then man,
which may serve as a reason, why I have not gone over again either the same
things, or after the same method, as almost all others have done; but have
sought to make the truth appear, though in an unusual, yet for the most part,
in a Scripture dress; if it offend, such must know, that the holy Spirit
divides to every man, severally as he will; And blessed are they, that are not
offended with him.

External order, that is not the Manifestation of the Spirit, which is given

Q. Tell the first?

A. The Isa. 32.3.
first is the knowledge of man, as he was in innocence.

Q. Tell the second?

as he was under the Law.

Q. Tell the third?

A. The third is the knowledge of man, as he ^s Ephesians. 1.18, 19.
under grace.

Q. In what order, do ^^u come to know,

A. We Ioh. 1.18
no sooner ^now God, but thereby ^e know man also.

Q. How may that be?

A. The Ps. 43.3.
knowledge ^f God is the light, by which we come to know both himself, and man.

Q. Why is the knowledge of both by Christ?

A. For a twofold reason.

Q. Tell the first?

A. The Romans 9.5
first is, because Christ is both God and man.

Q. What Is the second?

shadowy representation.

Q. Was there a real manifestation of God, in Eden.

Q. How does that appear?

A. Thus, Eden the garden of God, was the glory of the world; the tree of life,
was the glory of Eden; and God, was the truth, and real glory of both.

Q. If there were a real manifestation of God to Adam, how did he fall?

A. Though he had a manifestation of, yet he had not (to his knowledge) John
17.21.
a Union with God.

Q. From what did he then fall?

A. From Genesis 3.8
this manifestation of God.

Q. How does that appear?

A. He ate Genesis 3.22
not (as we read) of the tree of life.

Q. What was then the shadowy representation of God, in Eden?

A.

Q. What was this tree of life?

A. God Rev. 27.
himself, or Christ, in a figure.

Q. Was Adam to have ate of this tree of life?

it he should have had life, for evermore.

Q. What injunction did God give Man, in Eden?

A. Not Genesis 3.17.
to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

A. In Genesis 2.9.
the midst of the garden.

Q. Why was it set in the midst of the garden?

Q. Tell the second?

A. 'Twas placed in the midst of the garden for a sign.

Q. A sign of what?

A. Of Gods almightynesse and sovereignty over all things.

Q. How does it appear this tree was such a sign?

A. In Genesis 2.17.
that God reserved it to himself.

Q. Did man then attempt to be like God?

A. Gen 3.5
Yes.

Q. By what means?

A. By the ibid.
insinuations of the Serpent.

Q. Who was this serpent?

A. The Rev. 20.2.
Devil and Satan.

Q. Whom did he first ensnare?

A. The Genesis 3.1
woman.

Q. Why was she first in the temptation?

A. Because she was most weak, and with this sin most apt to be overcome.

Q. What sin was this?

A. Pride.

Q. What pride?

A. Spiritual pride.

Q. How does that appear?

A. In ib.
that she thought to be wise without God, and so to to be happy too, without
him, and not in him.

Q. How came this to pass?

A. By ver. 1.
reflecting on her self.

Q. What was then the temptation?

A. To v. 5, 6.
think her self better then she was.

Q. Why was it called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?

A. Because Genesis 3.5
when man eat of it, he ceased to trust himself with God, and began from that
time forward to take care of himself, and so by himself and Satan to find
out what was good, or evil, for himself.

Q. Was it then Adams sin to know what was good or evil for himself?

A. 'Twas Mark 10.18.
his sin to account any thing good to him but God; or any thing evil to him,
save his departure from him.

Q. What was then Adams fall?

A. His Genesis 3.6.8.
leaving God, and cleaving to himself.

Q. Was this so great a sin?

A. It Jer. 2.13.
has in its bowels all other sin.

Q. What was man now?

A. A Genesis 3.8
Rebel to God.

Q. What did God resolve concerning him?

A. That Genesis 2.17.
he should dye.

Q. How did God declare his displeasure against him?

A. He Genesis 3.24.
drove him out of paradise.

Q. What did God mean thereby?

A. That Habbac. 1.13.
none such as he should live in his presence.

Q. What is the knowledge of God that comes by the law?

A. There is a twofold knowledge of God by the law.

Q. Who discerns this twofold knowledge of God?

A. Such Acts 9.17.
as discern Christ.

Q. What is the first sort of the knowledge of God that men have by the law.

A. A Rom, 2, 17.
false knowledge.

Q. Who has this false knowledge?

A. Fallen Rom, 10, 2.
man.

Q. What is the knowledge of God that fallen man has by the law?

A. He Ps. 50, 21
takes God to be such as himself is.

Q. How do you mean?

A. He Psa. 50, 9

.

Q. Have all men this knowledge of God?

A. Acts 14, 13.

Q. How does that appear?

A. It appears in all Rom, 3, 12.
men.

Q. As how?

work to to have life.

Q. How do you mean?

A. They Mat, 5, 20.
think to make themselves perfect.

think to fulfill the law.

Q. Does not man well so to think?

exceeding pride.

Q. Why so?

A. Because Rom, 5, 6
it is infinitely beyond his power.

Q. Was it ever in his power?

A. No Ps. 39, 5.
.

Q. Why are these things then befaln him?

A. Because 1 Cor, 8, 2.
he sought it in himself.

Q. Was it never in himself?

A. The Ps, 62, 11
power was alone in God.

Q. What was then his fall?

A. He fell from God, in whose power all things had been possible unto him.

Q. What does man then by seeking to keep the law of himself?

A. He 2 These, 2, 4.
thinks to be God alone, or at least God with God.

Q. What is then his undertakement?

A. That Rom, 7, 21.
which is impossible.

Q. What does befall man by this his undertakement?

A. Exceeding Gen, 3, 8.
fear.

Q. For what cause?

he of himself cannot please God.

Q. Give an instance of this?

the case of Cain.

Q. How does that appear?

to please God without faith.

.

fly from GOD as their Almighty enemy.

Q. What course do they naturally take to heal themselves of this distemper?

A. They either seek to destroy themselves, as being weary of themselves, or
else to forget God, the law and themselves, by plunging themselves in sin and
the world.

Q. Give an instance of the former?

A. Judas did thus.

Q. How?

A. He Acts 1, 18.
slew himself.

Q. Give an instance of the latter?

A. The Gentiles did the other.

unrighteousness.

misunderstanding of the law.

Q. What is that misunderstanding?

A. False Gal, 3, 1
teaching.

Q. What Is the latter?

a principle within them.

Q. Is it not then the mind of God that man of imselfe should keep the law?

A. That were 2 Cor, 3, 5,
impossible.

Q. Why is he then punished?

A. Because Jer, 31, 18,
he undertakes things of his own head, and will go his own way.

Q. Is that such a sin?

A. By it Isa, 7, 13
he contemns God.

Q. What is the state of such a man?

A. He lives Ephesians, 2, 12,
without God.

Q. How mean you?

A. He prays without out God, he hears, walks, talks, eats, works, dies, and
all without God.

Q. If man be not of himself to keep the law, what use then is there of the law?

A. It Rom, 7, 9
serves to make man nothing in respect of power, wisdom, righteousness, and God
in that respect all in all.

Q. What then is the true knowledge of God by the law?

A. I have showed that already.

Qu. Open it more clearly?

law sets up God, and throws down man.

Q. Why so?

A. Because the Ioh. 17.22.
Father and he are one.

not divided.

Q. How are they distinguished?

suis modis qui sunt in re. Trelc.
to all three, yet all three, Father, Son, and holy Spirit in respect of that
relation, are distinguished among themselves.

Q. How did this mystery appear in the Creation?

perpetual memory of his sole rest, and delight, in Christ.

the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Son also was then expressly revealed, as him, in whom the Father delights
himself, from eternity to eternity.

was but an image of this.

Q. How mean you?

A. That Heb. 1, 11, 12.
passes away, but this abides for ever.

A. That was but a dark resemblance Exodus 33 23.
, the back parts of GOD: But this is the brightness of the Fathers Heb. 1, 3. 2
Cor. 4, 6
glory, and the express image of his person, the face and countenance of GOD.

Q. How was the Holy Ghost revealed at the appearing of Christ?

A. Evidently two ways.

Q. Name the first?

A. He is revealed as proceeding from Ioh. 15, 26.
the Father and the Son.

Q. Name the second?

A. He Joh. 14.23.
is revealed, as him, in whom the Father and the Son are one.

whom they enjoy each other everlastingly; or which is all one,

The Romans 1, 4 Ephesians. 4.4 5 1 Cor. 12, 4, 5, 6.
Spirit is that oneness, in which GOD enjoys himself.

believe.

Q. How mean you?

own Son.

Q. How is the Holy Ghost made manifest?

A. Many ways.

Q. Name one only?

A. By the Holy Ghost, they that believe are one with Ioh. 17, 22.
, and in the Lord Jesus, one 1 Cor. 6, 17. 2 Cor.
Spirit, with the Father, with Christ, and Ephesians. 4.4.
with all Saints.

Q. You in the opening of this Mystery seem shy of the ordinary expressions?

tradition.

Fathers.

Q. May we not make Abhorremus (...).
use of them?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there foundation for them in the Scriptures?

A. Yes.

Q. Why do you then not open this mystery by them?

A. I have two reasons for it.

Q. Tell the first?

A. The 2 Timothy: 3, 5. Psa. 50, 16.
commonnesse of the expression has veiled and clouded the truth and mystery it
self.

Q. Tell the second?

A. The mystery Ephesians, 3, 18, 19.
it self (being a great deep) one way of expressing it, is too narrow.

Q. How does this appear?

A. From Ioh. 21, 25.
the Scriptures.

Q. How so?

A. They Ephesians, 3, 10.
are abundant and various in the expressing of it.

Q. To what end?

A. That Romans 15, 4.
if by any means we might apprehend it.

Q. What Is the evil of our not following this example?

A. As most are ignorant of Mat. 22, 29.
, so few receive comfort from this mystery.

Q. How appears that?

A. The 1 Pet. 1.18. Mark 7, 13.
knowledge of most is but traditional.

Q. What does that bring in?

A. A form 2 Timothy, 3 5.
of godliness, without the power of it.

Q. And what is that the root of?

A. All 2 Timothy, 3 1, 2, 3, 4.
manner of sin, schism, and profaneness.

Q. How is it remedyed?

A. By Ioh, 6, 63.
understanding all things in the Spirit.

Q. How is that?

A. By beholding them in their 2 Cor, 3 18.
own native, naked, and real glory.

Q. May that be on earth?

A. Ibid.
Yes.

Q. How?

A. In 1 Cor, 13, 9.
part.

Q. What follows the want of this?

A. Many Ioh, 11, 9, 10.
stumble at the truth it self.

Q. And what too?

A. Men Mat, 11, 18, 19.
take offense for not going in the common road.

Q. Is it safe to turn every stone, and to examine every thing in Religion?

A. Every 1 Ioh, 4, 1
one should do it, for his own satisfaction.

Q. How?

A. Modestly Rom, 12, 3.
.

Q. How mean you?

A. Expecting to be taught of GOD Ioh, 6, 45
, in every thing of GOD.

Q. What will they then be?

sweet then the honey Comb.

Q. What caution then is to be given us hence?

A. That Isa, 2, 22
we cease from man.

Q. What altogether?

A. No 1 Cor, 3, 5.
.

Q. What then?

A. So 1 Cor. 14, 25.
far as we find not GOD appearing in him.

Q. Why so?

A. Lest Mat. 10, 17.
he lead us out of the way.

Q. To what?

A. To 1 Cor. 3, 10, 11.
the knowledge, and enjoyment of the very first foundation.

Q. What is that?

A. The Mystery Col. 2.3.
of GOD, the Father, revealed in Christ, by the Spirit.

What Is the end of this divine Manifestation of God?

A. Commandment gives us to understand.

Q. What then does the third Commandment teach?

A. That Exodus 20 7.
such honor be given to God, as is due unto his Name.

Q. Does this follow the two former?

A. Yes Naturally.

Q. How so?

A. When Rev. 19.1
God is known, he is glorified of them that know him.

Q. How is GOD glorified?

A. By Ioh. 3, 33
subscribing to whatsoever is revealed, or spoken of him.

Q. Give us an instance?

A. We Job 40, 4
see it in Job submitting to his wisdom.

Q. Give another instance?

A. We see it in Isa. 6.
Isaiah the Prophet, and with him the Angels, giving to GOD the glory of his
holiness.

Q. Name one instance more?

A. We see it in that Revel. 5, 11, 12.
infinite number of Saints and Angels that are round about the Throne.

Q. How does it appear in them?

A. In the New Rev. 5, 9
Song they sing.

Q. What is the song they sing?

, honor, glory, and power be unto him that sits upon the Throne, and unto
the Lamb, forevermore.

Q. How do they express this?

A. By Rev 4.10
casting their Crowns before the Throne.

Q. Of what is that a sign?

A. That GOD is all, and they before him (in their own account) nothing at all.

Q. What will follow hereupon?

A.

Q. What is that?

keeping of a Sabbath.

everlasting rest.

Q. What is that to us?

we have rest in the assurance of it.

Q. Are we to observe it as the Jews did?

A. By Col. 2.16
no means.

were taught by it as by a shadow.

no means.

Q. Why so?

substance being come, the shadow flies away.

himself.

themselves.

stains it with evil report.

tenth word in the law shows.

Q. May not the things of others be more excellent, then those possessed by us?

in themselves, but not to us.

Q. Why so?

A. Because 1 Cor. 12, 11.
our heavenly Father thinks it otherwise.

Q. Is that best for us which is of GODS providing?

A. Yes Mat. 6.30.
.

Q. What Is the fruit of all this?

out in the Gospel.

Q. How does that appear?

A. Satan deceived Adam through his belying God in that Genesis 3, 5
appearance.

Q. How mean you?

A. He made him believe that ibid.
which was not.

Q. What was that?

A. A Joh. 8.44
lie.

A. Romans 3, 12.
Yes.

found death and ruin, in that wherein they thought to have had increase of
life and glory.

way for the execution of his eternal purpose.

A. For two causes.

Q. Tell the first?

of GOD, among the Sons of GOD, might be much more abundantly magnified.

Q. How does that conduce to this?

same pit of death and condemnation with all the world.

Q. What Is the second cause?

A. That Romans 3, 19.
every mouth might be stopped.

Q. How?

A. Every v. ibid.
one by nature chooses death, rather then life.

Q. How mean you?

A. They (as Genesis 3.
Adam) please themselves to their own ruin.

Q. Why else did GOD suffer his in Adam to be thus deceived?

A. Because Heb. 11
he intended for them a more glorious resurrection.

Q. What is the measure of that glory?

A. The holy Mar, 19, 17.
Commandment.

Q. How mean you?

A. The sbid,
fulfilling of it.

Q. Where is that?

A. Alo^e in Christ.

of himself.

In which Gods Kingdom, does most plain appear.
If we believe not, The Scripture.
yet he abides faithful, he cannot deny himself.
YOu that the meaning seek, of this one verse,
I shall the same, in these few words, rehearse;
Gods power, and our weakness, here you may see,
Both joined together, in rich unity:
Our emptiness does here, most plain appear;
Gods fullness too, is here set down, that fear,
Might not o're-whelme our hearts, and us dismay:
For God Almighty is to save, always.
Tho thus it be with us, that we misgive,
That truth it self sometimes, we do'nt believe,
Yet God is faithful, and the same for ever:
Our sins and fears, and doubts, cannot us sever;
For all that did us both, once come between,
Christ nailed on the Cross, most fast I ween;
And what on earth is meet, for us to have,
That he will give to us, with faith to crave;
Gods Covenant is this, the Scriptures show,
He for us nothing now, has left to do:
And tho to flesh and blood it be most strange;
Yet blessed be they, that see this happy change,
Leave off then, caring for your self, and see,
Christ Jesus will of you, most careful be:
For, now, the name of God is this, I Am sure,
Emmanuel, Christ, Godwith us, most pure.
If this be then his Name, what is more sweet,
Or more welcome, then those most comely feet,
That on the Mountains come, to tell that news,
That God with us, his dwelling now does choose?
Oh then once think not this glad tidings such,
That for us to believe it, 't were too much:
Yea this of Faith's the root, for this is truth,
And for this end, even God himself came forth,
Was manifest in flesh, our sin to kill:
And so his precious blood, did freely spill:
This is the Name of God, a Savior true.
Who think not thus of him, they do'nt him know,
And tho there be that say, they do him know;
They lie, if still on earth, they live below.
For to this end, our Lord, came from above,
That he might raise our hearts, to him in love:
Yea to this end he came, and dwelt on earth,
That we in Heaven, might have enduring wealth:
Yea, us this day himself, is come among,
That we might joy in him, with joy most strong:
Then do not think, that he with works is pleased,
That has us from, all bondage, fully eased,
And made us free in Heaven, to dwell on high;
For he that raised us, now to faith is nigh.
But what is the life, which we by faith do live,
A life beneath, what he himself does give?
Or is that life, which Christ himself has given;
A life beneath, what he himself has liven?
No, he is our life, for so the Scriptures say,
I am the truth, the life, besides the way.
If this be so, as plain it does papear,
Then let not unbelief, make you to fear,
But rather now in Christ, be ever bold,
Since God does so himself, to us unfold:
For he is now one with us, and we with him
Are one, which is our garment, white and trim:
What else is this, but that which Christ has se'd,
I will be with you still, and will you lead
Into the path of life, that we to heaven
Might fly, since Christ has quite us now bereaven
Or earth and sin, of hell and curse together,
That we on Eagles wings might hasten thither,
And there make our abode with Christ above,
Since to this he has called us in love.
If Christ be there, we also should be there;
For by him now out foes all conquered are:
Yea this is certain, the way's made most plain:
All that is left by him, was surely slain:
Why then be not afraid, since all is dead,
Which has the world to destruction led,
Alive we are in Christ, our sin is gone,
And always we now sing in Mount Sion:
This is that high, and lofty, hill of God,
Where Christ now reigns, with his triumphant rod.
This is that hill, that makes all hills to quake,
And does (this day) their great Foundations shake:
For why its true, that Christ has undermined
This vain worlds pride, as we in Gospel find.
Nay to the Saints, this world does cease to be,
From Heaven alone is now, their pedigree:
New birth, new life, they are al together new,
New creatures all, as Scriptures plainly show,
New earth, new heaven, and new Jerusalem,
The state and glory is, of these new men.
A new world too, even that which is to come,
Which here besides, the portion is of some,
Believers all, this world do constitute,
Which does man's carnal doctrine, quite confute;
This is that world, that shall at length appear,
Beauteous, rich, and like to Crystal clear:
This is that Kingdom, which we pray may come,
This is Gods Covenant, that perfect one,
This he will keep, tho we even doubtful, are,
There is no reason, why we it should fear.
FINIS.
