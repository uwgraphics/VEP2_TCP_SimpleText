The Life and end of Thomas Awfeeld a Seminary Priest and Thomas Webley a Dyers
servant in London, being both Traitors who were Condemned as Fellons for
bringing seditious books into this Realm and dispersing of the same, among
their favorers: for which they were Executed at Tibourne the 6. day of this
Monthe of July. 1585.

Imprinted at London for Thomas Nelson dwelling at the west end of Paul's.

IT is sufficiently known unto many honorable personages and diverse other of
this Realm, how this lewd priest Awfield has of long time lived about London,
secretly seducing the people to embrace his deuilish doctrine and to win them
from their due alleaga^ce toward God and their Prince, and how by frequenting
the company of diverse ignorant and simple people: he did win them to be
pertakers of his Romish and Antechristian Sinagoge. And to the end that some
part of his life and religion may plainly appear to the common people, as
also that the true cause of his death and his fellow companion may sufficiently
be known: I have taken in hand this short discourse chiefly to beat down the
untrue reports of their favorers and fellow Traitors who secretly murmr
that their death was only for Conscience take and their Religion being Papists,
although it shall be evidently seen by the sequel that they died rebellious
traitors to God, their Prince and Cuntry. And yet notwithstanding, received
greater favor of law then either their offense deserved* or the^ selves or
their favorers would on the contrary part have ministered. And that their life
and proceedings may generally be seen to all good subjects: I have perticulerly
and breefly set down the truth of the same, as well to satisfy them heerin
As also to admonish others how to shun their pestilent doctrine where within
many places they do great harm, the Lord for his mercy sake root them out
speedily Amen.

The life and proceedings of Thomas Awfeeld a Seminary Priest being a seditious
person
THis Awfeeld was borne in the town of Gloucester, his Father being a
Schoolmaister: brought him up in good Litterature, wherein after he had been
sufficiently trained (having his lattine tung), he went beyond the seas and was
there reconciled to the Pope, and entered into the vow of priest hood in the,
Seminary at Rheimes and being there nusseled up among many the old
Caterpillars of that Church, he was sent into England with other Seminaries to
insence and seduce the people, against their Prince and Cuntry, and as much as
in him lay to persuade them from their due obedience against their natural and
peerless Sovereign yea to lay violent hands, upon her and seek to subvert
and displace her highness (whom God long preserve); yea and to murdure and make
hauock on Christian Princes thereby to bring in and advance the Romish religion
to the vttermoste of their powers. This detestable Course took such effect in
these hel-hou^ds that they after their coming insenced a number who have
sundry ways attempted the same as well in seeking to murder her majesty as
also in betraying of the Realm, to bring in foreign Invasion and thereby to
spoil the life and goods of every good subject. A plain example whereof you
had lately by Throgmorton and William Parry alias ap harry: yea and diverse
others who most worthily have been executed for the same. And such Hipotiks as
these abominable Seminaries weer perswaders of the^ to too it to their utter
confusion, shame and disgrace to their line and successors for ever. This
Ie^u^^ticall priest, being a seducer among ye rest was taken and Imprisoned in
the Tower of London, and afterward upon his hipocritical submissio^ he was set
at liberty yet not co^te^ted with this her majesty's gracious pardon he departed
over Sea and returned privily, bringing over about 300. books and upward,
containing nothing but treason, heresy, blasphemy, and detestable doctrine
written by an Arch-Papist called D. Allin which books he commended and did cause
them to be dispearsed by his favorers especially by Thomas Webley, and William
Crab both notorious Papists who as you shall here, had been a favorer of the
Gospel until they were seduced from it by this priest and other as shall
hereafter be showed.

And here is to be noted that this Awfeld not only by departing out of the
Realm^ and returning with these seditius books did incur her majesty's
displeasure and by the law deserved death as a fellon, but also by being found
here forty days after the end of the last parliament (being a Jesuit or
Seminary Priest) did deserve by the law to dye as a traitor.

These books before mentioned being come to light and this priest also that
brought them over, who being taken and examined was found guilty of the same
and after upon the fifth day of July at the sessions house in the old Batley
was condemned and adjudged with great favor to be hanged at Tibourn, only for
bringing over these seditious books into England contrary to the laws of this
Realine the penalty whereof is to dye as a fellon; and the dispersers or
publishers of such like books to receive the same punishment, And this was the
cause of his death, although he deserved a sharper punishment in cases of hye
treason wherein he stood at the time of his death. He was a person of mean
stature, not full forty years of age and of no special good life but lived
losely. It is known he was a grievous offender to God, a Traitor to his prince
and a secret enemy to his country, although at his death he seemed to color
the matter with a kind of fained obedience as you shall after here in the
speeth uttered at his death.

The life of Thomas Weblyn.
THis Thomas Weblin was b^^^ i^ Gloucester his Parents being of (...) wealth and
honest report brought him up in the fear of God, and being come to reasonable
years did place him in Lo^^o^ with a dier being a man of good rep^tat^on within
the City, where in the first part of his prentiship he was so; zealouse that
what good book he could buy or borrowe to read, or what good sermon he could
repair unto he accounted it ye greatest felicity he had and continued in that
kind of profession a long time until his going down with Awfeeld to
Gloucester, who being a Priest and a rank Papist, did so incense and persuade
this Weblin with his erroneous doctrine, yt although he went thither a
protestant he returned an arrogant Papist. And moreover Awfeeld so applied his
labor heerin that in short time he persuaded also one William Crab the son
of webleis mistress dw^lling in the same house,) to be one of his scholars
and dealt so far with them both that he brought the^ acquainted at Throgmortuns
house withone of his Servants whose name was Rogers to which place they often
times did repair and continually had what freendship Rogers could do for them
as well for conference as otherwise so that webley would not come to ye Church
neither would read any book of divinity but privily would say they were
naught, heriticall, and falsely expounded or translated. But God seei^g his
wilfulnes gave him over even to the lust of his own heart and suffered him to
continue in his own blindenes: so that at the return of this Priest after he
had been banished, being come into England with those books before mentioned,
did think this Weblin A meet Instrument for this purpose and made him privy to
the same and got him to b^ the distributer of many of them, to those whom he
knew of that Sodomiticall Sinagoge which in short time it pleased God to bring
to light, whereupon he was secretly sent for and examined, and permitted to
remain with his master going under sureties until monday ye fifth of this
July at what time he was sent for to the Sessions house, where remaining
obstinate in defense of ye same he was condemned to be hanged at Tibourn on the
next day following.

The end and execution of these two before mentioned.
Upon the sixth day of this July 15.85. Master Fidens the usual Minister
accustomed to repair to all condemne^ prisoners in Newgate, came thither in
the morning about five of the clock to confer with the two prisoners before
named, and persuaded them to prepare them toward death but they seemed very
obstinate saying that they were sufficiently settled thereunto and therefore
needed him not, and desired him that he would let them alone, nevertheless he
did not neglect his duty toward them, but wille^ them to believe Christ
Jesus, that they might die the servants of the Lord; and they answered him that
they which did not believe as they believed, were damned to the bottomless pit of
hell fire, neither could he get any better words of them but continued
obstinate in their irriligious opinion, and between six and seven of the
Clock, the Carte was brought to Newgate by ye officers which received them and
conuaied them toward Tibourn: but Master Fidens seeing their wilfulnes, went
on foot after, and when the prisoners were at the church wall of S. Andrews
in Holborn, the minister of the church named M. Eaten came unto them and in
Christian charity persuaded the^ to think in what state they then stood, how
wilfully they had dealt against ye Queens majesty's proceedings, and how
greatly they had incurred her highness displeasure toward them, wishing the^ to
pray for her majesty, to acknowledge their offense, and heartily be sorry for the
same. But Awfeeld said you do not well to trouble us in these our meditations,
nevertheless he then seeing them so near their death and in what state they
stood: willed yt the Cart should be stayed and so went up and conferred with
them but the Preeste seemed to stand in the defense of them both, saying they
were even as good subjects as any there present, but Master Eaten said if
that be so? wherefore were you condemned, Awfeeld answered they say for
felony, why said the preacher you know whether ye have trespassed in yt sort
ye or no, but he answered they neither had offended her majesty nor any way
deserved that Death, then he laid open their offe^e^ and the Printed
Authority, and showed how every Subject ought to submit himself to the
Authority of the higher powers, and repeated the mind of the fathers
thereupon, but in conclusion what soever he did, the Preeste seemed to will ye
younger man not to believe him, whereat ye minister said to the Preeste your
offense is great in that you are guilty of the blood of this man, meaning the
younger man, who was induced by him thereunto. The Preeste not withstanding said
he would take it upon him if he should suffer torments in (...) hells for the
same, Oh said the Preacher, take heed what you do, for look in what sort you
dye in the same sort shall you come to Judgment and after many reao^s to
disprove their gross errors he said if you be so wilful I will leave you unto
you will and wish you to prepare you to death for we braw near ye place of
execution, but he would not any way be advised by him and so came to the place
of execution wherafter the Executioner had fastened the^ with ye Rops about their
necks the priest began to profess much by sayi^g he would show him self a
dutiful subject, but it proved to the contrary, for all was in the aduau^cement
of him self and the Pope, and in ye defense of ye book which he offered to
instifie, and in conclusion although he professed him self to be her majesty's
subject, and proffered to fight in her majesty's defense against all persons yt
should invade the Realm, yet he died a Traitor, and his fellow companion
also (denying her majesty of her due title concerning the supremesie in the
Church of England un der God, whose authority she has and ought of duty to
be acknowledged of every good Subject) refusing to have any to pray with them
but desiring all Catholics to say one Credo for the^ in ye midst of their
Agony. And thus remaining in their obstinate opinion they were soon cut off.
The Lord of his mercy root out al other such secret lurkers in corners, and
grant that either they may speedily be converted or else that they may be
brought to receive their just reward and end their days in yt like or more
sharper sort.

FINIS.
