Imprynted at London by Thomas Gemini, dwelling within the Black Friars: who
is there ready exactly to make all the Instruments apperteynynge to this
Book. ANNO. 1562.

L. D. unto the Reader.
Although (gentle Reader) many excellent in Geometry, upon infallible
grounds have put forth diverse most certain and sufficient rules, touching
the measuring of al manner Superficiecis: yet in that the art of numbering has been required (yea, chiefly those rules hyd, and as it were locked up in
strange toungues) they do profit, or have furdered very little the most
part: certes nothing at al, the Landemeater, Carpenter, or Mason, wantyng the
aforesaid: for their sakes I am here provoked not to hide, but to open, and so
increase the talent which I have received: yea, to publishe in this our tongue
very shortly (if God give life) a volume containing the flowers of the
Sciences Mathematical, largely applied to our outward practice, most
profitably pleasant to all manner men of this realm. In the mean time I
shall desire the Artificers above named to be contented with this little book
(a taste of my good will toward them) which I wyshe even so to farther the
readers, as I know it suffycient for the true measurynge and ready account
of all manner Land, Timber, Stoone, Board, Glass, Pauemeut. etc.

Here mine advise shall be to those Artificers that will profit in this, or
any of my books, now publyshed, or that hereafter shall be, first confusely to
read them through, then with more judgment, and at the third reading wittely
to practice. So few things shall be unknown. Note, often diligent reding, joined
with ingenious practice, causes profitable labor.

Thus most heartily farewell (louinge Reader) to whom I wish my self present
to further thy desire and practice in these. The pleasant profit, or content
of this little book. And in what it exceadeth all other publyshed.
OTher Books tofore put forth in our english tongue contained only the bare
measuring of Land, Timber, and Board: how agreeable in all places to the rules
of Geometry, let the learned judge. Here (gentle Reader) thou shall plainly
perceive through diligent reading, how to measure truly and very spedely all
manner Land, Timber, Stone, Steaples, Pillars, Globes, Board, Glass, Pauemente.
etc. without trouble, not payned with many rules, or obscure terms. Nor yet
with the multitude of tables, as here before has been: in which not a few
errors were committed: for that cause no just account might any way be had.
Further ye shall by this book understand the whole making and comely
handelynge of the Carpenters Ruler, with the true measures. etc. And his use
appointed to the ready measuringe of all kind of Timber, Stone, Board. etc.
Also the leauelinge of grounds, taking of Heightes, is pleasauntly and
diuersely practiced by the ruler. Ye have here not the commune but the rare use
of the Squire applied to Heightes, Lengthes. etc. and to the fyndinge of the
just hour of the day diverse ways: through the aid of pleasant tables,
newely adjoined to my general Prognostication, by the which the proporcion of
things direct or squirewise standing, are by their shadows known.

To conclude, in the end of this book is added a treatise showing the making
and use of an Instrument, by which ye shall get Lengthes, Heightes, Breadthes,
widenesses, where, or how so ever they stand. Other necessary things are
contained in this little volume, which I commytte to the diligente Readers.

Diverse things conducible, to the art of measurynge. THE I. CHAPTER.
AS there are few craftesmen, which have all the kinds of Arithmetike
readely: Characteres numerall.
so I do suppose none so ignorant but that they do, or may easelye perceive
the simple significations of these Caracters or figures. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
8. 9. 0. and also their strength, in the first, second, and third roumes
placed.

Besides that, they must be familiar with these and such like Fractions.

1/7 1/16 1/32 9/10 The first leftwarde betokens one second part of an
whole, Fractions.
be it Pearche, Inche, or any other measure: the next, one third, then one
seventh part: the other ensuyng, one sixtenth. So one thirty and two parts of
an Inche. The^ follow three fourthes: four fiftes. The last is nine tenthes of an
Inch: that is nine parts of an Inch, divided into ten porcions.

These I do intend to put in my ensamples, and in my tables, and margines
folowinge, to represente parts of Pearches or Inches.

As, if I would write half an Inche after this manner.. Three quarters of an
Inche, thus. One eight part of a Pearche, on this wise.. So of the rest.

It is requisite also here to open what a Pearche, a Dayworke, a Roode, and an
Acre is.

Although there are diverse opinions engendered through long custom in many
places, of the length of a Perch (upon which our chief matter dependethe)
yet there is but one true Perch, by Statute appointed to measure by. Wherein is
ordained. Breadthe.

Acre.

Length.

3. barley corns, dry, and round, to make an Inche: 12. Inches, a Foot.3.
Foot, a Yard.5. yardes and.. a Pearche: 40. Pearches in length, and.4. in
breadth, an Acre.

So an Acre by statute ought to contain. 160 pearches: the half Acre.80.
pearches: a Roode, commonly called a quarter.40. pearches: a Day work.4.
pearches. Lo here the Acre expressed with his length and breadthe.

I must not omit here to tell you what thing is metest to measure land with.
Instruments to measuce with Poales Cord knotted.
They use commonly in the country, two peales, either of them the length of a
perch. They are very good. Profitable staff.
Yet for all kind of land, a cord.5. pearches in length, well seared with
wax and rosyn, knotted or marked at the end of every pearche, is more mete
and readier. But in my fantasy, the Instrument Geometrical, which is put forth
in the end of this book, passes all them and other, for the exact truth, and
quickest speed. This instrument is so general and auaylable to so sundry
things, that it alone requires a large book, if it should be sufficiently
set forth.

Also I would not have you ignorant what piece of land is called a Triangle,
Triangle.
which often shall hereafter be named. It is such a fashioned piece as has,
or is imagined to have three sides, and three angels only: whether the sides be
equal or otherwise as this figure shows. Line fallinge squirewise.
Again, note that a line is said to fall squirewise, when it cutteth any
thing, or any side of a Triangle full cross, like unto a Squyre: As the
hanginge pricked line, a. b. in.c. d. the base line of the Triangle. Lo, it
cutteth the side squyrewise, or full cross, in the point b. and not as the
other line a. Base line.
e. does. The Base of any tryangle is here called that side, which is cut
squyrewise of the hanging line.

Concerning a Circle, Circle.
know that the compass of any circle, Circumfere^ce Center.
is named his circumference: Diametre.
the myddle point in him his Center: semidiametre Arcke.
the right line h. Paralleles.
i. that goes overthwart that Center, touching the circumference on both
sides, is his Diametre: the half of that line, the Semidiametre. Also an arcke
is a piece of the circumference cut away, as ye se the arcke above the line f.
g. Also f. g. and h.i. in this circle are named Parallels: for that they differ
equally in all places, the one from the other.

Now because practyse and experience shows me, that there is almooste no
land, but it may easelye be brought by imagination, to a Triangle or
Triangles, and so most truly measured: therefore to be short, this order
shall be taken. I will first figure and set before your eyes Triangled Land, and
other which by imagination shall be brought into triangles. Then I shall teach
the true measuring of them: I mean how to find a length and breadth, with
which ye shall enter the Table of account folowinge, where the acres, and odd
pearches, if there be any, shall appear. As these fygures are measured, so all
tryangled land, and other, brought into triangles, of what fashion soever they
be, shall be measured, And because it is requisite for true measuring of all
triangles, to find a streigth hanging line, I shall show first how that
Line is to be found, imagined, or drawn.

How the right hanging line in Triangles is drawn THE II. CHAPTER.
To draw a hanginge or plumbe line.
THis streygth hanging line in all Triangles, is ever drawn or imagined from
any Angle, cuttinge some one side of that triangle squirewyse: as ye may
perceive the pricked lines in the triangles following. By the help of this
line, all lands of Triangle fashion, are brought to be mesured as ensues.

How to measure all manner Triangled Land. THE III. CHAPTER.
IF thou be an Arithmetrician multiylie this streigth ha^ginge line, Euclide
the first book, 41. pro.
drawn as above as showed, in half the number of pearches of that side which
it cutteth squirewise. For want of that knowledge, take the aforenamed pear
ches (I mean of the hanginge line, and half the side which he cutteth) and
with that Length and breadthe enter your table of account, as there is set
forth. So shall ye perceive the number of Acres, Roodes, Dayworkes. etc.

Ensample.
FOr the perfect measuring of triangles before fygured, and all other, suppose
the second of these last. 9. fygures on the other side, having written about it.
a. b. c. d. to be a piece of land, whereof I would have the true measure. I
find by a cord or otherwise, the pricked hanging line a. d. to be. 23.
Pearches: the side b. c. which it cutteth squirewise. 44. Pearches, whose
half is. 22. With these. 22. and 23. the convenient length and breadth, I
enter the table of account. There I find by that table, at the corner where
both the lines of conunient length and breadth do mete.3. Acres, 6. Dayworkes,
and 2. Pearches to be in that Triangle. Thus of all before fygured.

Here note, This Table follows.
your Table must ever be entered with all the pearches of the hanging Line, and
with half the side that he cutteth squirewyse: Or with the half hanging line,
and the whole side cut.

A figure of a double Triangle.


THis figure e. f. g. h. is but two Triangles: and therefore measured as above
in two parts: Or thus. The hanging line, e. g. is.33. Pearches: the side. f.
h. that he cutteth squirewyse.20. Pearches, the half of the which is.10. Now
enter your Table as before, with 33. and.10. the conueniente length and
breadthe. So shall ye find, 2, Acres, 2, Dayeworkes and, 2, Pearches, the true
content of this fygrue, e, f, g, h,

An other ensample.
ADmit. i. k. l. m. land to be measured. Because it is no manner Triangle, it
must be brought by imagination, as I have said, into a Triangle or triangles.
Figures of many Angles.
Which imagination is here signified by the line dashed. i. l. Then as above is
declared, it ought to be measured (according to the rule of Triangles) in two
parts, because there are two triangles in that land. So by proof ye shall
find in the upper. i. m. l. one Acre.3. Rodes and.5. Dayworkes: in the other
i. k. l. one Acre. Thus I gather the whole content of that land to be 2.
Acres.3. Roodes, and.5. Dayworkes.

None otherwise of the adjoined. n. o. p. q. and all other fygures following,
and other whatsoever they are, that by any means may be brought into triangles.

Furthermore know, that the figure. i. k. l. m. is redely thus measured. Add
the pearches of both the hanging lines together: so have ye. 23. With this
number, and with half the pearches of the side. i. l. which he cutteth
squyrewyse, being. 20. pearches, enter your table: so is found as before.

These two fygures following may also be thus measured, otherwise then by the
rule of Triangles. Enter your table with their conueniente length and
breadthe. So shall ye find the content of all such.

These three fygures folowinge, although they may be measured by the rule of
Triangles: yet for quicker speed, they have also their proper measuringe as
ensues.

Lay together the two sides which are parallels of the first figure a. that
is.6. and 18. making.24. the half is.12. the breadthe.5. Enter with.5.
and.12. your table. So have ye one rode, and five dayworkes. For the other two
b, c, and such like, join the heads or ends in one: and enter your table
with half of those pearches, and with the whole number of the middle line.

How by supputation to measure all Triangled Land.
To measure triangled land by supputatio^
Join all the sides together: take half: out of that half pulle every side,
nothing difference. Then multiply the ^ifferences the one in the other: and the
third difference augment in the product. That which increases multiply in the
half of all the sides joined. Then the Radix of the surmontinge sum is the
content of that Triangle.

Four rules following.
Now rest four rules to be treated of. The first for all manner regular
square Superficies. The second for Round land, and her parts. The third for
Steples, Columns, Globes, and their parts. The last for Mountains and
Valleys. Here they shall in order follow.

A rule for all manner regular or right squared land of many sides, as 5. 6. 7.
8. 9. 10. 20. 100. etc. THE IIII. CHAPTER.
To measure land of many sides.
MEasure and lay all the sides together, taking the half number of Pearches
there contained. Then draw a right hanginge line from the center or mids of
that figure, to the mids of some one side. And with that length and the
other enter your Table. Note that the Triangle of all sides like, and the
Quadrate figure, are also measured by this rule.

Ensample.
SVppose this figure. a. b. c. d. to be a stresquare piece of land and every
side.24. pearches. The half sum of all sides is.72. pearches: the right
hanginge pricked line, a. c. 21. Pearches. With these two numbers ye must
enter your table of account folowinge hereafter. And do as is opened in the
declaration there adioined, when numbres surmou^t the Table, as they do here.

So shall ye find, 9. Acres.1. Roode, and. 8. Dayworkes, the content of this
figure. a. b. c. d. Even thus is the other nynesquared figure measured, and all
such like.

A rule for round Land, and the parts thereof. The. V. Chapter.
Half the Diametre multiplied in half the Circumference Archimedes in libello
circuli mensurationis.
shows the content of any Circle.

Or thus more playnelye. Ye sshal enter your Table with half ye number of
Pearcches of the whole Circumference or compass, and with the number of half
the Diametre or breadth. So have ye the cotente.

Ensample.
SVppose a piece of land, whereof the compass is 100. pearches, the breadth
33. Pearches. I would know how much land is in this Figure. Enter your
Table with half the compass that is.50. and with half the breadth that
is.16. pearches. Because in the table I can not find 50. for the greatest
Length is.40. (therefore I enter with.40). and.16. So is found four Acres.
Then I enter again with.16. pearches remaynyng and.16. the breadth as before:
that brings one Acre. Now to conclude, by addicion of.1. and.4. I find.5.
Acres in that round land, whose half compass is.50. pearches. and the
breadthe.16. pearches.

FOr perfect knowledge and use of this Table folowinge, when parts of
Pearches are adjoined, note well this other example that ensues, and also what
is said of the declaration annexed unto the Table, How parts of pearches are to
be co^pted in measuring.
when parts of pearches are in the length, breadth, or in both.

Imagine. f. g. h. to be a round piece of land: I find by measure the whole
compass.99. Pearches. The half is.49. 2/1. The hanging Line or half breadth
is.15.. Enter your table with the whole Pearches, that is.49. and 15. leauinge
out.. and.. which were but parts of pearches. So have ye.4. acres.2. rodes.3.
dayworks, and.3. Pearches. For those parts of pearches omitted at your first
entering the table, work thus. The half perch, quarter, or other parts of a
perch in the length, must be reckened by them selves in the whole breadth: and
those of the breadth contrariwise in the length. If there be such odd parts
in both, then reckon them of the length in the whole breadth, and them of the
breadth in the whole length: ioining to the other aforegotten, remembering the
product of the one fraction multiplied in the other, to be pulled from the
increase. To make this matter plain, I will take this last ensample before.
The one number wherwyth I should have entered my Table, was.49.. the other.15..
I found first by entringe with.49. and.15. (omitting the odd parts) 4.
acres.2. roodes.3. Dayworks, and.3. pearches. Now for the increase of ye parts
of pearches left out: I must (as I said) reken them of ye length in the
breadth, and contrariwise the^ of ye breadth in the length. Half.15.. is.7.
pearches and.7/8. Three quarters of.49.. is.37. Pearches.. Which added,
makes.45. pearches: This adjoined to the number aforegotten, brings the whole
content of the round figure, which is.4. Acres.3. Roodes.4. Dayworkes.3.
Pearches.and.5/1. of a perch, the product of the one fraction multiplied in
the other subducted. What must be done when ye nu^bres wherewith ye should enter
excede your table, counsel ye declaration of your table there adjoined.

Of the half Circle.


To measure half circled land.
FOr this half Circle, enter ye table with half his compass, and with half
the Diametre of the circle, or with the length of ye pricked hanginge line, k.
l. So the content of this half circle, is.2. acres.1. roode.7. dayworkes.1.
Perch, and.13/16. of a pearche.

An other ensample of porcions and parts of a Circle.
SVppose.n. m. o. following were a part of a Circle, or piece of land, whose
content ye desired. The whole compass of the Circle which this portion
represents, is (as before).99. Pearches: his Diametre or breadth.31.. The
pricked arcke or compass n. m. o. is.74. Now with the half breadth or
semidiametre of the circle.15.. and with.37. the half of the pricked compass:
enter your table. So have ye.3. Acres.2. Roodes, 5. Dayeworkes, 2. Pearches,
and.. of a Pearche, the content of the piece of Land full of Pryckes, to the
sides of the Triangle pricked. To measure parts of circled land.


If ye desire to know the sum of pearches in the other portion beneth the
Triangle, separated by the line, m. o: ye must add the content of the
triangle (which is.3. Roodes, and.. of a perch, found by the rule of
Triangles) to the Acres and pearches before searched. So have ye.4. Acres.1.
roode.5. Dayworkes 3. pearches, and.. of a pearche. This subtracted or pulled
from the number contained in the whole Circle, the remain is the pearches
included in the small piece beneath the Triangle. That is.1. Roode.36. pearches,
and.1/8. of a pearche.

How mixed fygures are measured.
Land compounde of circles or his parts.
I Think none now will doubt how these two fygures folowinge are measured,
because they are made of porcions or parts of Circles, whose measure is before
sufficiently opened: the one consistinge of two half circles and a Quadrangle:
the other being the portion of the Circle, m. o. doubled.

If any evil fashioned land chance to be measure, which requires to be
brought in many triangles, to save labor, ye may add some portion unto that,
and make it square or otherwise. So let it then be measured: and after from the
product pull away that ye added: the remain is the content.

To find the content superficial, of Steples, Columns, Globes, and their
parts.
TO the Arithmetician I say. For picked Steples, multiplye the whole side in
half the Circumference of the base, To measure Steples, Columns, Globes. etc.
adding the plain of that base. For Pillars augmente the Circumference of the
base in the height, puttinge to the plain of both Bases. For Globes, the
Diametre in the Circumference multiplied: even so of Fragmentes or Parts. Let
them that be void of Arithmetike, enter my Table of account folowinge, with
such numbers as I now wylled the Arithmetician to multiplye, not forgetinge
what I have before written: So I serve their turn.

Or thus, by the rule of proportion, the parts of a Globe are found.


To measure parts of Globes.
Suppose.a. b. c. to be a piece of a Globe, and.4. to be a Portion of the
diametre, the whole being.14. Thus I say.14. The whole Diametre gives.616.
the content superficial of this Circle: what shall.4. bring: So have ye.176.
which is the content of that piece.

To find the Diametre by some known portion thereof.
To find the unknowen Diametre of a Globe.
IF ye be ignorant what length the Diametre of that Globe is whose portion ye
have: the height or part of the Dimetient being.4. foot, augment half the
line. a. b, which is.6.. in him self, and the product divide by.4. So have
ye.10. to be added to.4. which makes.14. the whole Diametre.

The true measuringe of Mountains and valleys. THE VI. CHAPTER.
To measure Mountains.
FIrst ye shall measure the circuit of the foot, or base of ye Mountain: then
the compass of the summitie or top: adding them together. So shall ye do of
the Ascenses, that is, the goinge up from the foot to the top: ioyninge the
measure of the longer and shorter in one. Now take the half of the circuites
added, and the half part of the Ascenses joined and enter your Table. There
shall ye se the content.

Ensample.
A B. C. is the Mountain: a. c. the circuit of the base, being 100.
Pearches: b. the top.16. Pearches. Which joined together make.116. F. c. the
one ascense, Figure of a Mountain.
is.55. Pearches: the other.75. These added make.130. The half of the
circuites, is.58. the half of the Ascenses.65. With these two Sums ye shall
enter your table of account: where ye shall find.23, acres 2. rodes, and.10.
pearches, the true content of this figured hill.

Of the Valley.
To measure Valleys.
AS in the Mountain ye measured the circuit or compass of the base or foot:
so here contrary, ye shall meet round about the circuit, or compass of the
height of the Valley. And as ye got the measure, or compass of the top of
the Mountain: so measure the circuit of the deapth of ye Valley. In like
manner as ye measured the ascense, that is, the going up from the foot to the
top: so measure the descense, or going down of the Hill to the depth of the
Valley. The rest all work, as I have showed in measuringe the mountain.

Figure of a Valley.
For more playnnesse, behold this ensample, or figur. If ye lay together the
circuits of ye height and depth, which is.210 and.30. taking the half part
of those two circuites, making an.120. tha^ the two ascenses.140. and. 60,
added in one produce.200. the half thereof being.100, with this, and.120. the
other half of the circuit, ye may enter your table. That doing, lo.75.
Acres.

How this table of account now following is to be used
WHen you have gotten a convenient Length and Breadth, (as I have above
declared, by diverse triangles and other figures) then you shall enter this
table. Seek there the length and most number of Perches in the higher margyne,
which begins at.1. and ends rightwarde at 40. Look the other sum of
Perches (I mean the Breadth) in the right side, and hanging margin, from.1.
descendinge to.30. Now at the meting of the lines, where the one answers the
other directly in a square, you shall find the Acres, Roodes, Dayworkes and
perches. Note that the first number set on the left side and upper part in
any square, signifies the number of Acres. The figure.1. set in the upper part
and right side, does betoken a Rode: the figure.2. there two Rodes.3. three
Rodes. Any figure in the left side beneth, sygnifyeth a Dayeworke, or
dayeworkes. A figure in the lower part ryghtewarde, declares Perches.

A declaracion adjoined.
what is to be done when numbers (with which you should enter) excede your
Table.
When it chau^seth that the one number or both with the which ye should enter
this table, are greatter then any here found: it behooves you to take the
half of the one and the hole of the other, or what parts ye list of both most
commodiouse for your purpose, and so enter your table. Look then what is there
found, and it shall bear his name of the parts multiplied in them selves.

Ensample. Suppose the number with the which ye should enter your table to
be.103. pearches in Length, and the Breadth.60. neither of these may be
found in the margynes: wherefore I take the third part of an.103. which
is.34. Pearches and.1. remains. The half of.60. that is.30. I find with
entryng them at the commune metinge.6. Acres.1. Rode, and.5. Dayworkes. Look
what I have showed in the.5. chapter of parts, that understande here of hole
perches lest: subtractinge. etc.
This sum must have his name of the parts augmented in them selves. I took
the third part of the one, and half the other number, therefore.2, must be
multiplied in.3. or contrary, so have ye, 6. which signifies that ye have
found by entering, but the sixth part of that number ye should find Wherefore I
must make this sum tofore found (being.6. Acres.1. Rode, and.5. dayworkes)
sixetimes as much. So have ye.38. acres and 1. Rode. For the Pearche remaining
in the Length, reckon him in the breadth, (as is before declared) in the.5. cha.
of the remaynes: so have ye.60. Perches more to be added. So the increase of
these two numbres.103. and.60. amounts to.38. Acres, 2. Rodes, and.5.
dayeworkes. Thus any manner Length and Breadthe, is reduced to this Table
following, which suffiseth.

THus with few words is ended the certain measurynge of all manner Land,
towchynge their superficial contents. Wherefore now shall follow the true
measuring of tymbre, Stone, Steples, Pyllers, Globes, according to their
Crassitude.
To the Reader.
IT comes communely to pass that Carpenters, Masons, and such like Artificers
are put either to measure Timber every way square, or squared logs, broader on
the one, thi^ on the other side, yea many times mutilate or imperfect stuff: some
times. 3. 5. 10. or, 20, square in the head and so through, oftentimes round
stone or timber, with hollowed. etc. Before I show unto them what must be done
with such pieces of Timber or stone to get their true measure, my desire
shall be, that such Craftesmen will leave to be heady or self willed, yea so
gredily to stick to their old corrupted rules that utterly they refuse to be
taught.

Both learning and experience declares unto me, that ye grounds which the
best of them have are false. To open how and where, it needs not: neither
does it apperteine to instruction. Only it may suffice him that likes the
true way, here to receive it appointed to him. Yet to satisfy and content him
which will not believe any such errors or false grounds to be: I say (and
truly) that the Ruler of timber measure, which the more part of them has,
is not made by right art. Besides that their craft in seekinge the square of
some timber, is very false. They use in measuring to lay the broader and
narrower sides together in a sum: and to take the half of that number for
the square. Then they seek this untrue square upon the false ruler: and so
measuringe the timber, they conclude of it untruly. As this is corrupted, so
are other grounds which they take to be infallible. Now to the purpose,
touching the correction of those errors with other not mentioned, whereby true
measuringe may ensue this way shall be taken. After I have opened how ye must
handle all such fashioned timber (as before is spoken of) there shall follow a
table, in which ye may find (as I will declare) the square of any stone, or
timber. That known, it is requisite to have an other table immediately
folowinge, which may appoint to all true squares, from. 1. to. 6. inches, the
just length to make a Foot every way square. In a foot square is contained
1728. Inches.
With that length agreeable to your square, your logge must be measured. And as
often as ye find it from the one end to the other of your timber, so often ye may
conclude the foot square to be contained in that timber logge, or stone: that
is, so many square sete there to be included. This Table of timber measure
stands in the place of a good Ruler, well docked with true measures. By this
ye may make or correct rulers at pleasure, as after appears. Now orderly
follows the true measuringe of all fashioned Timber or Stone before named.

How timber or stone, four square every way, or broader on the one then on
the other side, is measured. THE VII. CHAPTER.
IF a piece of Timber, or Stone be either equally square, or broader on the one
side then on the other, ye shall take the just measure, I mean how many
Inches the broader side conteyneth: even so of ye narrower. This done ye must
seek in the table of squares following, the measure of the broader side of the
timber or stone, in the upper margyne of that table. Then look for the number
of Inches of the equal or narrower side, in the right part and hanginge
margyne. At the commune metinge, where the one number answers directlye to
the other, there your true square shall appear. This square so found shall be
referred to your table of timber measure: in ye which ye may plainly see (if
you run down by the left margin, until your Inches square appear) how
many fete or Inches of your ruler belongs to a foot square. As often as that
measure there found is contained in the timber or stone, so often and as many
fete square ye may conclude (without doubt) that piece of timber or stone to
have.

Ensample.
SVppose this squared Timber or Stone, a. b. c. d. were to be measured, the
broader side, a. b, 20. Inches: the narrower side. b. c. 13. inches: the
length. 40. inches. Now I must seek the broader side. 20. in the upper
margyne of the table. The narrower side. 13. must be found in the right side
and hanginge margin. At their common metyng:16: inches, and.. part of an Inche
shall appear. This true square must be searched for in the Table of timber
measure. Therefore look for. 16. in the margin of that Table. In the squares
with him rightwarde, ye shall synde. 6. Inches, and.. which is three quarters of
an inche. Somedele less of your ruler then.6 and.. laid out upon the Timber,
makes a foot square. And that measure so discretely handeled, is contained in
the length of your timber sixetymes. Wherefore affirm six foot there to be,
beside that is left.1/54. part of a foot. Note because the squares, at al
times (as in this ensample) rise not to even Inches, but sometime to odd
parts: Therefore according to your discrecion, add or take away some part
more or less in setting forth the foot square, as above is parformed.

It were intolerable tediousnes, yea impossible, to set forth ye true
quantities of timber measure, to allodde quantities of squares. The discrete
handlinge of these, the wyttie shall bring to a sufficient exactness.

Of Timber or Stone. 3. 5. 10. 20. or mosides square. etc. THE VIII. CHAPTER.
WHen Timber has diverse equal squares in the head and so through: first
measure all the square sides round about the head or end of the Timber. Then
take half the number of the whole measure for the one Breadthe. Then measure
from the Center (which is the middle of the head, or end of the Timber) to
the mids of one square side, between the two angles: and take the measure of
that distance for the other Breadth. Now resort with the measures of these
two breadthes (as tofore) to the Table of squares: seking the bigger number or
breadth in the upper margyne, and the other less in the side margin. With the
square there found, have recourse to the table of timber measure: and do as I
have instructed.

Ensample.
ADmit this small piece of timber.5. square. e. f..g. h. should be measured,
every side being.12. Inches. If ye add together in one sum all ye.5. sides,
they make.60. Inches. The half is. 30. that serves for one Breadth. Then the
line.e. f. which goes from the Center or mids of the square to the middle of
one side, is.8. Inches. The two numbers.30. and.8. must be sought (as before)
in the table of squares following. At the commune metinge, your square shall
appear.15. Inches and.. This square.15. seek in the table of timber measure.
There ye may se right with it.7. Inches, and.. Now because of.. the odd
quantity of the square above.15. Inches, lay sometime less. Then se how
oftentimes that measure (so with discretion handled) is from the one end of
your timber to the other: and affirm so many times a foot square there to be,
as that measure is found in the length of your logge.

How round and hollowed Timber, Steples, Pillars, Globes.etc. are to be
measured. THE IX. CHAPTER.
FIrst gyrde the logge round about with some line: then divide the line,
which compassed that timber, in two equal parts, keep the one part for the
bygger Breadthe: After ye shall divide again that whole length (the twenty and
two part cast away) in three parts, and take the half of one of them for the
other narrower Breadth. With the measures of these two breadthes, haste to your
table, performing all thing as before is opened.

Ensample.
SVppose this little piece of Timber.i. k. l. m. were to be measured, the
compass or gyrdinge 36. inches, the half of that is, 18. being the one
breadth: then the third part of.36. is.12. the half of it is.6. which is
the other narrower breadth. With these two numbers.6. and.18. enter the Table
of squares folowinge, and so the Table of Timber measure. At the last (all
things performed as before) ye shall find in this round logge, (the length.
l. m. being. 18. inches). 1. foot and.. part of a foot. This is sufficient
for all such like.

A note of hollowed Timber.
IF it chance that hollowed Timber be to be measured: measure the whole logge
as though it were not hollow, as above is declares. Then measure the narrower
and broader side of the hollow: and see what is contained in that, as though
it were massy Timber. Now pulle out the content of it, from the whole above
measured: the remain of force must show what timber is included in that
hollowed body.

I Am unable in few words to express to the unlearned, by what mean
Pyramidal, or picked regular Steples of all fashions are measured. Also how
Pyllers: how the content of Globes or Bowls are searched: unless the art of
numbringe were tasted. That being known: thus (as now follows) I teach.

How the Crassitude of picked Steples is known.
MVltiply the plain of the Base in the third part of ye height: so ye have the
Crassitude. Or multiply the content superficial (found as I have instructed)
in the height of the Steple, taking for your purpose the third part of that
product.

How the content of Pillars is known.
Increase the base plain in his altitude or height: so have ye your desire.

How the Cubicall bodies of Globes are searched.
THe content superfycial found (as I have opened) must be multiplied in the
syxte part of the Diametre: the product is that ye require. Or the third
part of the Superficial content in half the Diametre. Or multiple the plain
of the Circle in the whole Diametre: then take two third parts, which added
make the crassitude.

Of the half Circle.
HIs superficial content multiplied (as is said) brings the magnitude of him.
If any man require ensa^ples of this last matters, or more sufficient
handlynge: let them resort unto my books published of Geometrye, there they
shall be satysfyed. These little apperteyn to Carpenters or Masons, therefore
not by ensample declared.

A general Note.
WHen thou shall be put to measure some body without order or fashion, lackinge
part of his square, or having more then his form: if it lack thou shall make
it perfect by observing diligently the runninge together of the sides. The
parts wantinge shall be measured as though they were there, which porcions
must be taken from the whole body measured.

Also when there resulteth any more then the form or regulare square: first
measure the square body: then the crassitude which abounds. All put together
do show the whole irregular body. This suffyseth.

A table to find the just Radix or Square of any Timber, or Stone.
IT behooves you to know that this Table folowinge is made for the true square
of any manner Timber. Therefore understand that the numbers from.1. to.40. set
above in the high Margyne betoken the Inches of the broader side of the
timber. And the numbers from.1. and so downward to.30. put in the right part
and hanging margin of this Table, signify the inches of the narrower side:
and to conclude briefly, the elements or figures set in every square room
betoken the just square. The bygger ands;igures leftwarde in every square
place, signify the whole inches. And the other lesser ryghtewarde in the same
square divided by a line, the parts of inches, as etc.

This first fraction toward the left hand betokens one half part of an
ynche: the other two fyftes of an ynche: and every figure or fraction, having a
point adjoined unto him, somdeale less then the part is: as this part
represents scante half an ynche, a very little quantity less. And if he
had two pryckes by him, he should have declared some quantity more: as this
other fraction or part: which is more than two fiftes, a small deal.

It had not been needful to have put the parts of the square so precisely as
they are here: neither is it requisite so curiously to take them.

The table of Timber measure, with the declaration and use of it. THE, X.
CHAPTER.
THis Table (as ye see) is divided into two columes or rows: the one very
short, the other longer.

In the headde of the First I have put this word Foot in the Second row
Inches and parts: to signify feet, inches, and parts of inches. The sums
in the margyne and left part of the first and second colume, declare the
quantity of the square of timber or stone, from.1. to 36. inches square.
Within the rows you may find the just length to a foot square, if ye enter
into them in right order, according to the square

Ensample.
SVppose the square of your timber were.7. inches, and that ye desired to know
what mesure or length of the ruler would make a foot square. Seek in the least
margyne.7. inches: and with him in that order toward the right hand, ye shall
find 2. foot. 11. inches, and 2/7 of an ynche. Note because the fractio^ 2/7.
has a prycke by him, it betokens some small quantity less then 2/7 of an
ynche. If it had two pryckes or points thus: 2/7 it should signyfie some
lyttel quantity more. Neither makes it matter, whether ye observe this
prickynge or no, the quantity is so lyttel to be added or pulled away.

Note what has been spoken of Timber, the same also is to be understand of
stone, like wise to be measured.

Thus is finyshed the measuryng of timber, now ensues of Bourde. etc.

How Tables, Bordes, Glass, or any such like are measured, according to
their length and breadth only to the foot square. THE XI. CHAPTER.
THis thing is performed by ye help of a large table following, divided in six
small tables, and as many margines The first and left marigne be ginneth at..
which is one quarter of an ynch, and extends to.6. Inches, as ye may
plainly perceive if ye run down by that margyne. This has his Table on the
right side adioyninge unto him. The other takes his beginning at.6. inches..
and ends at.12. having his proper table also. The third, from.12 to.18. And
so from.18. to.24. From.24. to.30 The last margin is from.30. 1/4 to.36, and
there ends.

Of this that is said, you may gather that every margin has his Table on his
right side. Also you must know that in the top and beneth I have put (as in
the table of Timber measure) these words, foot, ynche, and parts, to sygnify
fete, inches, and parts of an ynch. Whenever ye list to measure, Board,
Glass, or any other such, with the breadth of it enter this Table: and seek
that breadth in his proper margin. There ye shall find in right order how
many fete, inches, or parts, of an Inche belong to a foot square. So often
as the measure is in your stuff, just as many fete have ye in that board or
such like. If the breadth excede this Table: than divide ye breadth in parts
and work as is and shall be declared. So the ingenious applies this Table for
all manner breadthes most exactly.

Ensample.
SVypose I have a pane of Glass, or a board, whose breadthe were 22. inches..
the length.16. foot. In the fourth margin I find this breadthe.22. and.. And
even with it in the Table rightward I se.6. inches.. So much of my ruler
(wanting some small quantity) makes a foot. Now, because in the length of
my board (which is 16. foot) that measure is found.29. times, and.. parts.
I concluded.29. foot there to be, and two third parts of a foot square,

little thing, as is declared plainly in the other tables before put forth.

HE that desires to measure Chamber floores, Pauimentes, or such like: let him
only multiply the Breadth with ye length: so the producte shows the
content.

Ensample.
IF there were a Pauement. 100. foot long, and in Breadthe. 50. I must needs
conclude (by multiplicacio^ of that length in the breadth) there to be
contained. 5000. foot.

Or thus without Arithmetike when the breadthe exceadeth the Table.
Divide the breadthe in parts (as is opened in the declaration of the Table of
account) and work as I have before instructed. So for Pauementes all manner
ways it serves your turn. Of this matter to put for the tables, were
superfluous tediousnes and follye. The ingenious with these few, will be
satisfied.

The face of the Carpenters ruler, figured with the true measures and other
things necessary. THE XII. CHAPTER.
BEcause the effect of this Ruler is above declared by Tables, an Instrument
also well known and commune among good Artifycers: I will not spend many
words, in opening it. Behold the fygures, and learn by them how ye ought
to make, and commonly to deck your Ruler, both with Timber and bourde
measure.

Ensample.
ADmit the ruler to be. a. b. c. d. well playned, twelve Inches long, a quarter
of an Inche thick, and two Inches in breadth. Truly yt were more commodious,
if it has two foot in length. This ruler here imagined but a foot in length,
is divided first in twelve even parts, called Inchess: then every Inche in
half, or two equal porcio^s: each half in two quarters: every quarter in four
or two parts at the lest: as in this en sample. Then are the fygures placed
from. 1. to. 12. manifestinge the inches. Thus your Ruler is ready to receive
the measures which are marked or fygured on your Ruler thus. And first the
Timber measure as follows.

YE shall resort to your Table of Timber measure, and seek how many fete
belong to. 1. Inche square: there ye shall find. 144. This number note write,
or rather grave, where this figure. 1. representinge one inche, is fygured: as
pe may se in the mids between the line. e. f. and the line of the figure. g.
h. This done. resort to your Table again, and behold how many foot and
parts. 2. Inches square requires. So shall ye find. 36. foot, which is
placed in the next room leftwarde, under the charactere. 2. sygnifying two
inches. Thus of the rest, fete, Inches, and parts, found in your Table,
until you come to the. 12. Inche, where ye shall perceive. 12. Inches only to
be set in his proper room. etc. Then seek further in your Table, what
belongs to. 13. Inches: Lo. 10. inches and. 1/5. This must be numbered in the
line. c. a. from c which line betokens the thicknes of the Ruler. Make there
a little stryke upon that grosnes, even or right against the measure. 10. 1/5.
what need many words. Thus do until ye come to. 36. Inches, and and that is
noted (as the Table of Timber measure shows (right with. 1. ynche, and.3/3.
from c. No otherwise is performed of board measure, as ye may behold set
forth by the help of his proper Table in the square roumes, beneath the line.
e. f. and also in the other thicknes or line b. d.

The back side of the Ruler, with the Quadrant Geometrical. THE XIII. CHAPTER.

The making of a geometrical quadrant
THis other figure. i. k. l. m. is the backside of your Ruler, having in the
mids a Geometrical quadrant. n. o. p. q. whose making in few words is thus
expressed. The line or breadth of your ruler. n. o. ye line. o. p. p. q. q. n.
ought to be of one equal just length, cutting each other squirewyse. Note
these three principal lines.
Also from the center. n. unto. p. is drawn an other line, which is called the
line of height. So is. o. n. the line of level q. n. the Line of Heightes
upright. This known, I open my compass, one foot remayninge in the center.
n, the other extended in the line of level, almoost to. o. making a
Circumference unto. q. n. which is a portion of a Circle named a Quadrant: and
ought to be divided into. 90. equal parts, as ye may behold every of them
called a degree. Ye may divide the Lines o. p. and. p. q. named the Scale, each
in. The divided sides. o. p. and p. q. are called the Scale.
12. as here, or in. 60. yea, in. 100. equal porcions is more mete, for the
use of shadows, Heightes, Lengthes. etc. Note that the side or half Scale. o.
p. is called the Contrary shadow: p. q. Right shadow. Remember that upon the
thickness m. k. ye ought to have two fine equal square sightes, well bored,
represented here by r. s., made of wode, or rather metal, to be fastened there
when time requires. Let this satisfye.

The commune use of the Carpenters Ruler, touching the face before put forth.
THE XIIII. CHAPTER.
SVppose a piece of Timber to be moaten, whose true square is. The.8. Chapter
shows how the true square is found
7. inches: this square appoints you to the figure of. 7. in the line. g. h.
under whom rightwarde in the place assigned to Timber measure, is written 2.
foot. 11. inches, and. 2/7. As often as that measure is found in the length
of your Timber, so many foot of Timber is in that piece.

An other Ensample.
IMagyne your square to be. 22. inches: seek in the line. a. c. Note then how
much of your Ruler is left from that, to the end of your Rule. c. and so much
belongs to a foot. Therefore lay out that measure upon your Tymbre, and
reckon how many times ye may find it, from the one to the other of your
logge: for so many foot of Timber is there. Even thus of Board. Seek the
breadth upon your Ruler, in the room or place of board measure, and immediately
before your eyes there remains what is to be laid out to make a just foot
of board.

The use of the principal lines in the Geometrical Quadrant on the backsyde
of the Ruler, and first of the Level line. THE XV. CHAPTER.
IT behooves you to look through your sightes. q. r. placed in the thicknes or
line. k. m. a fine threde and plummet fallinge at liberty out of the center.
n. If this plummet and threde chance precisely on the line of Leauel (which
is. n. o.) whatsoever ye se through the syghtes, is leauell with your eye: if
otherwise, the thing that ye look unto is not level, either more or less
then the height or leuel of your eye: More if the plummet fall to youwarde:
Less, if contrary.

How by the line of Level to forsee whether the water of any spring or head
is possible to be brought to a place appointed, and also to judge the holesomnes
of it. THE XVI. CHAPTER.
YE shall go to the head or spring, and set your Ruler to your eye (being in
height equal with the water) so ye the fine cord and plummet fall precisely on
the line of Leauell. Now if through the syghtes, ye may se above the place,
know and judge the water possible to be brought, if your sight fall under,
impossible. It comes communely to pass when the place to the which ye would
have water conveyed, is of any great distaunce from the head, then hills,
valleys, and such like impedimentes let the line vysuall to have his free
course: wherefore this remedy is provided. At the head of the spring, ye
shall look through the syghtes (as before) and note a mark in the next hill
toward the place, then go to ye mark: in like manner observe there an other in
some hill: so forth until by any of them ye may perceive the place desired. If
then your sight running through the pinnes of your ruler, (the threde ever
fallinge on the line. n. o.) excede that place, the co^ueinge of your water is
possible otherwise not. Now by the way briefly ye shall be enstructed how
ye may know the holesomnes of water.

TAke a clean pot and put water in it: How good water is known.
so set it on the fire: after a little boiling, pour it owte: if the^ no
filthy remain in the bottom of the pot, it may be judged the houlsomer.
Or thus. Let fall drops upon metel, or rather on glass (any of them being
polished) and suffer that to dry by it self: if after there remain no spot
or sign, it is a good token. Moreover, if your water be sweet, pure, clear,
light, or of littel weight, it follows ye water to be wholesome for the use of
man.

Of the line of Heigt.
WHen so ever the threde and plommet do chance justly on the heigt which is n,
p: the altitude or height that ye see is even with the distance from the Middle
of your foot to ye nether part directly under the top equal with your
standinge, addinge the heigt of your eye downewarde, Know that ye must ever
stand upright with body and neck, your fete just to gether, the one eye
closed. etc.

The line of upright Altitudes.
IVdge also any thing plumbe upright when the thickenes of your Ruler. i. l. is
closely thereon, the plummet then at liberty, falling on. q. n, named the line
of Heightes upright. Now follows the use of the Scale.

To search out heightes by the Scale, with the aid of two places. THE XVIII.
CHAPTER.
LEt the threade and plummet fall in the one, on the.12. points: in the other
stacion, on the.6. of the right shadow: double the distance between the two
places, the summitie appears from that part of ye thing measured, which is
equal in hight with your eye. Or the one in the.12, the other in.8. of right
shadow: then tryple the distance. The one in the.12. the other in.6. of right,
quaduplate the space. The one in the.12. the other in.6. of the contrary
shadow, then the space between both ye stacions is equal with that ye
measure, ever understanding from your eye upward. Even that same comes to
pass, if in the one the threde be found upon the.6. of the contrary, in the
other one the.4. of the same. or the.4. and.3. of the contrary: In all these the
Spaces are equal with the altitudes. So then in measurynge the distaunce
between the two places, ye have the heyght, from your eye upward, puttyng to
it the length from your sight downewarde, the whole Altitude appears: the
base being equal with your standinge.

I Would not have you ignorant here how to know lengthes which be in height
not easy to come unto. First (as before) get the height of the top, the
altitude of the base or longest part of your length. Subduct the less
heighte out of the more, of force your desired length remains. How lenghts
in height are known.
Or thus: Let the plummet and threde fall in the.12. mark your place: go in
toward the thing (the threde as it was) until ye see the base of that
length: the distaunce between the two standinges, is undoubtedly the length.

How with the Scale, director upright heightes, by their shadows are
declared. THE XIX. CHAPTER.
TVrne your leftsyde unto the Sun, sufferinge his beams to pearce both your
syghtes. q. r. placed as before is said in the thycknes or line. k. l. The
threde or plummet then hanging at lybertye out of the Center. n. shows as well
the degrees of height to be compted from. o. as the parts of the Scale cut. If
your threde be found in the.12. part, or line of leauell, shadows of all
things being perpendiculer elevated, are equal with their bodies. If the
plummet with the threde be perceived cuttinge the parts next to the syghtes
which I name points of the right shadow, then every thing direct is more
then his shadow, by that proporcion which.12. exceadeth the parts, where the
threde was found. If yt fall in.1. that is the first part of the right
shadow, take the shadow twelve times to make the height. In two: that is the
second part. Six times. In the third, four times. In the fourth, three
times. In the fyfte, twyse: and.. of the shadow. In the syxte, twyse In the
seventh once, and.5/7. In the eight once: and.. In the nynthe once, and.. In
the tenthe once, and.. In the eleventh ye shall take the shadow once, and 1/11.
part of it.

Right shadow.
If the art of numbering were had, I would will you to multiply the length of
the shadow by.12. and the product divide by the parts, in the which ye found
the threde.

But and if yt be in the parts of the contrary shadow, augment the length of
the shadow with the parts declared by the plummet: and the increase divide
by.12. so comes the altitude also.

Contrary shadow.
Thus the composition and whole appliance of the Carpenters ruler is showed:
therefore somewhat shall be now said of the squire.

I am not ignorant that the common use of him is better known than I can with
many words express, wherefore I leave to write in that behalf.
Notwithstanding I will declare how Heightes, and Lenghtes are taken. etc.

knowledge of the day hour, and that diverse ways, with the help of the
squyre: as is opened in my general Prognostication augmented in the year of
our Lord. 1556.

What length the sides of thy Squyre ought to be, and the division of him. THE
XX. CHAPTER.
I Need not to put forth the exact making of this Instrument so well known.
Lo therefore thefygure. One side supposed two foot from the inward angle: and
the other a just foot from the same. The longer. a b. inwardly divided from
the angle* a. unto. b. into.24. equal principal parts, and every of them
into a less (if ye list) each conteynyng.10. minutes. Also the side. c. d. in

to cd, and a. b. Thus this squire is well framed for the use of diverse tables
put forth in my general prognostication, and also for ye findyng of Altitudes
and Longitudes, which here I purpose now brieflye to open.

How by this Squire heightes are known.
ALtitudes or heghtes are found, the line or plu^met centred in the.6. point,
cuttynge. h. the middle of. a. g. The moveable sightes placed in. a. g, or a

part of that length. The squire so remaininge, and the staff not removed
from his height, mark where the other end of the squyre next unto you noteh

by a small ground in the figure folowinge: so the art fails not in a
greater space, which the good speculator and diligente practiser by any way
can not deny. Yet experience wills me this to confess, that the squire is
not convenient for any long distance, but the Instrument Geometrical (whose
making and use ye may parceaue in the treatice folowinge) unless ye assend
some Tree or turret for your aid, which length known, shall stand in the
stead of your staff.

carpenter's square Carpenters Squire.



A Note.
IT behooves you to have a fine coarde, made fast in the upper part of your
staff. c. which shall be tied even with the inward edge of the squire, and
so drawn to the ground, where the near end of the square from the staff
poynted, as ye see. d. c. the other end then truly directinge to the fardest
distaunce.

Know that the ground must be very plain and leauel, otherwise error
ensues.

Thus the use of the Squyre is here somewhat declared, but more in my general
Prognostication, yea, most plentifullye hereafter (God sparinge life) in a
book titled ye rare use of ye Squire in practices Mathematical: in the which
book profitable plesaunte experiences shall be playnelye opened (only of me
practiced) as well of Perspectiue, as of the Mathematicals in general.

I Had thought here folowinge to have placed the ready handelynge of the
compass, yea and to have showed the fygurynge and true making of all manner
letters, both Text and Romayn, with the best proporcyon, the quantity as ye
would demand, besides that, so to place them in height and nearer to the
sight, that they being of diverse magnitudes might appear to the eye, of one
bygnes. This when I did attempt to bring to their capacity, seemed somewhat
dificulte without pennynge many words. Wherefore I omitted it, belongyng rather
to the Paynter, then to the Carpenter for whose sake only the rest before
seems to be compiled. Here after (as I se men desirefull) my endeavor may be
to add that, and other things necessary.

A little treatise declaringe the making and use of an Instrument Geometrical
(so far as it fardereth the Landemeter or Carpenter) named the profitable
Staff. TO THE READER.
I Said in the beginning that no little book would conteyne the making, and
manyfolde fruits of this pryncely Instrument, if it were set forth as it
ought to be.

Certes the truth even here makes me confess the same: He that desires
manifold fruits of this instrument, legate ge^ me fricii de radio astronomico,
and geometrico, librum.
yea, that there is no instrument so general and profitably pleasant.

Notwithstanding know (gentle reader) that the occasion of his chief use and
profit is not here mynystred: neither (to say the truth) does it apperteine
to, or agree with the capacity of such Artificers. Therefore I shall leave to
entreat of his ample large use, and best making, and will set him forth in
few words: yea, sufficientlye for the Landemeaters capacitye, or Carpenters
purpose, that at the least they may receive some kind of fruit with the
Geometrer. And in time to come (by other means) as I se cause I will largely
declare, and there deck him with his proper beauties. Here now follows the
making, and so brieflye how he is applied for the profit of the before named
Artificers.

The making of this profitable Rod or Staff. THE FIRST CHAPTER.
YE shall prepare two small, streghte, styffe, round, or rather square Rods,
of metal or of wodde well playned, of like bygnesse and length. Although it
make no matter of what length, yet to avoid the errors, which little
instruments and short staves bring, and also to bear with the rude vnwonte
handelynge of such Artificers: let your Rods be each five, or at the least
three foot, and every foot divided in.12. even parts or inches, as ye se. a.
b. and. c. d. These rods must be forged with a vize in the end of them to
join readely.10. or.6. foot in length, (when time requires) as the Figure e.
f. shows. Also ye must get (by the help of some Craftesman. 4. other like
rods, the longer g. 2 foot: the next. h.1. foot: the other. i. 6. inches:
then k. 3. inches the last and shortest. l. 1. inche and. Each of these must
have in their mids a hole, that the long staff of.10. foot may be put
through them, and they moved on him at pleasure up and down, always cuttynge
the longer staff. e. f. squyrewise, and made to tarry on any division as
occasion shall be given: which all are easy to be perceived by the figures
following, although my rude declaracion has not expressed my meaning.

Io the brief use of this general Calendar.
Enter the Columpne where your Month is noted in the hedde, ye shall there
find running down the Columpne the Festival days of that Month, the entry
of the Sun in the Celestial Signs, the Evil days pricked etc.

I would have placed in this Kalendare the Fayres, Terms also, but that can
not remain continual true: For those that ensue mouable Feasts are moveable,
and therefore may have no certain place, For the Terms, note these precepts
following The Fayres, shall be declared by two Table immediately ensuyng this
Calendar general.

How to know the Terms.
KNow therefore, that Easter Term always begins the 18. day after Easter,
rekening Easter day for one: and ends the Monday next after the Ascension
day.

Trinity Term heginneth the Friday next after Corpus Christi day: and ends
the Wednesday fortnight after.

Michaelmasse Term begins the 9 or 10 day of October: and ends the 28 or
29 of November.

Hilary Term begins the 23 or 24 day of January: and ends the 12 or 13
day of Februarye,

BEcause I understand many are desirous how to get exexactly the just length of
Staff and Squier shadow before treted of, upon vnleauell grounds, or other
ways where so ever it be, yea without ather Squier or Staff. I have
calculated a Table following, thoroughly satisfying the^, so ye they get ye height
of the Sun any way, or as I shall now enstruct.

Behold this Instrument called a Quadrant the just fourth part of a Circle.
even such a Circle as I taught you before to make for the night Dyall:
co^taining the fourth part of his divisions, that is 90 degrees, only two
syghts and a plume line added, to be placed at the beginning of this book as
ye may there: and here see. I have here also put the Scale to the Quadrant,
which serves well for shadows, and as well for heyghtes. the use of this
Scale is declared in my book called Tectonicon.



How by this Instrument to get the height of the Sun at all times.
Let up hansomly your Quadrant the Sun beams persyng ye sightes. The
Plommet and Line then at liberty falling, notes there the degrees of height at
that present, with the which shall enter this Table immediatle following, to get
them, and in like manner at all other times the just shadow of the Stue or
Squire.

A Table general of Shadows, right and contrary for every grade of the Suns
heyght: The thing causing Shadow, supposed.12 parts.

the Sune. Squire. Shadow.

The use of this Table, and first for Staff Shadow
Ensample:
I Suppose the height of the Su^ne taken by the Quadrant 34 degrees, now I
require the exact length of Staff and Squier Shadow. For right shadow,
first seek out the degrees in the left part of ye Table and under this title
the heighte of the Sun: if they be not in that left row downewardes, resort
to the next row and like title, until ye find the degrees, then in right
order toward the right hand, in the next Columpne under the title of Staff
Shadow, are 17 parts and 47 minutes, your desire.

For Squire Shadow, titled contrary Shadow.
Seek your degrees in the right part upward at this title Heyght of the
sun, in the botome of this Table: then shall ye find on the right hand of 34
degrees, in the next Columpn 8 parts and 6 Minutes: that is the very length
of Squier shadow, when the Sun is 34 degrees in height.

OCcasioned I cannot here omit an other Table faythfullye supputated for the
Suns altitude, by the which with quick speade the hour is known. This
Table conducteth manyfolde ways, yea to the Composition of diverse and many
Instruments: as Quadrau^tes, Nauicles, Cylindres. Rings. etc.
