By the Queen.
A Proclamation for the restitution of thentercourse betwixt the kingdoms,
countries, and subjects of the Queens majesty and the king of Spain.
WHere of late years there has been an intermission of the late ancient
intercourse of merchantes betwixt the Kingdoms and Countries of the Queens
Majesty of England, and of the King of Spain, by reason of certain stays,
and arrestes made of diverse subjects on both parts, with their goods and
ships, without any intention of either the said Princes to break or violate
the ancient amities and confederations continuyng in force betwixt them, or
to discontinue the said intercourse: but that as it appears the same
arrestes has been occasioned by persons not understanding the benefit, or not
wyllyng to favor the necessary continuance of such an ancient amity,
nouryshed and maynteyned by the free intercourse of the subjects on either
part. So it is, that both their Majesty's good meanynges toward the
continuance of their mutual amity, and the restoryng of the said
intercourse, being made known from the one to the other, by such their good
ministers as have been herein used: Therefore it is in their names accorded,
that all manner the subjects of both the said Princes, of what kingdom or
country so ever the same be, from the beginning of the first of May now
instant, shall and may have and enjoy the same ryghtes and liberties, as they
had in any of the dominions of either of the said Princes: and that they may
from the said time use the like mutual intercourse for merchandises, as they
were lawfully accustomed before the said arrestes. And for that it is meant
that all occasions of controversies or differences that has happened betwixt
the subjects on either part since the time of the said arrestes should be
heard and determined: it is ordained that this restitution of the intercourse,
shall remain from the said first day of May, during the space of two years,
to the intent that Commissioners to be appointed by the said Princes within
two months after the said first of May, may speedyly hear, order, and
determine such differences: Which if they should not be able to do, yet at
the end of the said two years, if by the said Princes in the mean time it
be not otherwise provided for continuance of the said intercourse, no new
arrestes should be made of any things brought into the countries of either of
the said Princes during the time of the said two years, but that all things
shall remain to the owners, without any disturbance to be used within the
Realm, or carried out of the same, at any time within three months after the
end of the two years.

Wherefore the Queens Majesty has thought it necessary, like as it is
agreed that the said King of Spain shall do the like, to notify to all her
subjects the premises, to the intent they may, as they shall find meet and
convenient, resort to the countries of the said King, and there use the
lawful intercourse of merchandise, as before the late restraynt was lawfully
by them used: Chargyng them to give no occasion of offense to the said King,
or his Countries, but to behave them selves in such sort, as the amity
betwixt the said Princes, and the intercourse betwixt their subjects, may
continue to the honor and comfort of the Princes, and to the mutual concord
and benefit of their people. The like whereof it is accorded shall be performed
on the said Kings part for him self, and his subjects resortyng into any of
her Majesty's dominions, to whom also shall be showed like favor, for
maynteynaunce of their intercourse and trafficque, as in time past before the
arrest has been.

Yeuen at her Majesty's manor of Grenewich the last day of Apryll. 1573. in
the fyfteenth year of her hyghnes reign.

Queens Majesty.
