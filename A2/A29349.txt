THE COVNTRIE GIRL. A Comedy, As it has been often Acted with much applause.

Never Printed before.

By T. B.



London, Printed for A. R. 1647.

Prologue.
BEfore I speak, me thinks, I hear some say,
What can there be, to furnish out a Play,
In such a Homespun Title? -- In a Plain
Poor Country Girl? Such, yields no lofty strain;
No sinewie stuff, extracted from a Mine*
Of deep, and Abstruse reading; no strong line,
No such a strain, and this poor Title, suite
Like old Pan's Bagpipe, and Apollo's Lute.
What must we look for then? A desperate wit?
Scoenes, full of veins, where, without a Hit
No man escapes, comes near it? This indeed
Were to some purpose; and the way to speed.
But this too's from this Title. -- None of these?
Alas poor Girl, where is then, thy hope to please?
What can she sing? and, like the Northern Less*
(That brave blithe Girl) hope to procure a pass?
Or, can she fight? -- If so so stout, so bold
A brave Virago, like the Girl, worth Gold.
Or is she one; that once a Country Maid,
Cracked in the carriage, is come to Trade,
And set up some new Leaguer? Or suppose
Our Girl, a virtuous Copy, and so close
This inquisition of her, -- She is -- what?
Her own presentment, best can tell you that,
Which be but pleased to grace, with love and favor,
You make the poor Girl rich, and Crown our labor.
The Country Girl.
Enter Sir Oliver Bellingham, and M. William. M. William. Believe me Sir, I
have told you what your worship may most certainly trust to.


Sir Oliver. May I not speak with her?


M. William. You know my place.
There Is no more hope from the deep pit of grief
To raise in her any conceit of love,
Then there is to raise her husband up again
From the cold bed he sleeps in: from the Grave.
Take this for all: My Lady Sir, has vowed
To live* and die a Widow. -- So I leave you. --

Exit Shut. Sir Oli. Is It possible, that such a one as she;
So young, so beautiful; so full of blood;
Such lusty blood, as she is? for such a loss,
Should lose that youth; that Beauty, that quick blood
In such a cold retirement? -- Well, I know not!
But if she have made such a vow, and keep it!
To find out such another, and a Phaenix,
Is but an equal labor.

Enter M. Rash. Rash. Save you Sir Oliver; save you, sweet Sir Oliver.


Sir Oli. As much to you Sir; kind M. Rash.


Rash. You have bin with the Widow; this melancholy Lady already. Give you
much joy of your fair hopes Sir Oliver.


Sir Oli. As much to your self; to your self Sir, kind M. Rash.


Rash. I Will hope as much as I can, though you be a Knight; and I but an honest
Citizen. A Mercer, is a Merchant, and will look for good Ware, for his Money.


To the door. Sir Oli. If he should enter now? -- I Will see the issue.


Enter M. William. Rash. You know my coming: to speak with your Lady, M.
William.


M. Will. But she is not at leisure to hear you.


Rash. I hope you do but jest.


M. Will. Believe me Sir, in earnest.


Rash. But, I Will not take it in earnest.


Offer to the door. M. Will. But you must. -- Then you will be Rash indeed Sir.
Though you be a Citizen, you are not free of this Hall,
And therefore must have no admittance.

Exit Shut. Sir Oli. Give you much joy of your fair hopes.

Another?


Enter Plush, a Gallant. Plush. Save you Gentlemen: how is it M. Rash?


Rash. As well as we may, M. Plush.


Plush. You have got the start of me, I see that Gentlemen. A Suit, brought me
home this morning, made me lie so much the longer: but, my Tailors long Bill,
like a Woodcock, as he is, shall be so much the longer a paying. -- You have
been within?


Rash. In our time Sir.


Plush. I mean, this morning.


Rash. But -- the Lady means no such thing Sir.


Sir Oli. We heard of your Worships new Suit, and would not go in before it.


Plush. I Will lead the way then.

Stamp at the door. Enter M. William. M. William? good morrow good morrow sweet
M. William.


M. Will. That sweet, to your sweetest self Sir.


Plush. And where is thy Lady? -- You see, we come, to come to her. --


Offer to the door. M. Will. By your favor Sir, you are too hasty.


Plush. Why, is not thy Lady up yet?


M. Will. Why, do you mean to take her down Sir? -- Buy Sir.


Exit shut. Plush. This Fellow's saucy.


Sir Oli. Minds not your Worships new Suit Sir. -- But we must be content.


Plush. We may be patient Sir, but not content; for nothing contents me, but
the Lady.


Enter Sir Robert Malory. Rash. Nor me, but that beautiful Lady.


Sir Rob. Who have we here? Sweet and soft, M. Plush. M. Rash! -- I dare be so
bold as embrace you too. -- But my Noble Sir. My Sir, of a thousand per annum.


Plush. Why, I can be a Knight, an I lust Sir.


Rash. An I can be a Knight, an I lust Sir.


Sir Rob. Dubd, with the City Dagger. -- Then Rash, would be rash indeed. You
come to see my Sister?


Both. With all our hearts we would Sir.


Sir Rob. Alas good hearts.
Me thinks the Gates should of themselves fly open,
To such brave men as you are.

Sir Oli. You have the old heart, still Sir.


Sir Rob. The young heart still Sir Oliver; -- the mad heart, -- the merry
heart; the light heart, with the candle of conceit, burning in it, as bright as
Lucifer, Hesper, Vesper.

You have not bin within? I will make out this pair of Aces,
And then you shall see my Sister.
I perceive by your melancholy looks,
My melancholy, pettish, peevish Sister,
Is not at this time to be spoke withal.
It Is such a foolish thing; -- She knows not worth,
Nor how to entertain't: suffice it Gentlemen,
I do; -- And shall not go behind her back
To let her know your merit.

Both. Will you Sir?


Sir Rob. And in a just proportion to that merit,
That Mass of Merit, you shall find her favor:
So M. Plush, and worthy M. Rash,
I shall desire you leave us.

Both. You Will remember.


Sir Rob. Shall I remember (Gentlemen) to eat?
To drink? to sleep? -- Then I Will remember you.

Exit Plush and Rash. Sir Oli. Then? -- When Sir Robert?


Sir Rob. When I am asleep. -- Awake, I shall never mind them. For their
Worshipe are hardly worth it.


Sir Oli. Yet in a just proportion, to their merit.


Ent. Abram. Sir Rob. Yes, that is just nothing: -- Hang them gloworms, hang them.


Sir Oli. Here Is another rub in our Ally Sir.


Sir Rob. A Tennants son of mine. -- And how does my honest Abr'am.


Abr. The better your good Worship is well Sir. I was to seek your good
Worship, at your Right Worshipful house Sir: but, missing you there, I rejoice
I have met with you here.


Sir Rob. Why, what is the matter Abr'am, what is the matter?


Abra. In the way of love, as they say: from my father, and my suster; and my
the other suster too; -- You know who I mean, Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Thy scolding sister. Abr. You are in the right, Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. And how does Margaret, my pretty Tennant?


Abra. That pretty one, is prettily well Sir.


Sir Rob. Remember me to her by this. -- A Ring.

Within these two or three days, at the furthest, I should breath a Gelding;
It may be, that ways, and visit my pretty Tennant.


Abra. Long may your Worships Gelding breathe, and your Worshipful self also.

I am in have Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Take your own time good Abram.


Exit with Abra. Thank your good Worship Sir Robert.


Congies. Sir Rob. I have done your patience wrong; indeed I have;
But, in the best, that lies in me to right it Door stamp.
You shall command me Sir: Now to my Sister.
Now, where is my Sister?

Enter Master William. M. Will. She Is within Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Come then, let us to her.


M. Will. You must pardon me.
She Is so retired to solitude; and set
So deep in grief, that till her sighs, and tears,
Will give her leave to give that entertain
That shall become such worthy Visitants,
(Which yet, they will not) it is her strict command
That no man enter.

S. Rob. Not my self?


M Will. Your self,
Sir, if you would not swell her grief too big
For her faint breast to carry, give her way.
A little time may change her.

(Exit shut) S. Rob. It Is enough. -- You see Sir Oliver.


S Oli. Your Love, Sir Robert.


S. Rob. But, as her Gentleman discreetly said,
A little time may change her: We must still
In such a kind humor a woman's will.
But, she is thine own, be bold on it. --

Exeunt. Enter Master William, and Barbara. M. W. Come, thou make such a
Matter, of Nothing.


Bab. Nothing, do you call it, Master William? I know not, but I am sure, I
feel it something -- It Is almost, kicking ripe already.


M. W. Almost, kicking ripe already, -- Come, come, thou art, A Chambermaid
still; -- And I prithee, what is this, but a work that belongs to the Chamber?
Kicking ripe already, This is not the first time, that thou have been kicked
with an urchin. Once, Twice, -- this is the third time of kicking.


Bab. Well, you wo'not, marry me?


M. W. And hazard my place, woe my Lady? -- and yet, Now I think on it. -- I will
--


Bab. Marry me?


M. W. To some of my old acquaintance. There be a hundred in the City, that
have swallowed worse bits then thou art. Hist.

Enter the Lady Mosely in mourning, veild; the Lady Malory, and an old
Gentlewoman. I know, my danger, and shall have a care, according.


La, Mos. Beseech you. Let the love you seem to show
In these persuasions, be expressed in words,
That better suit with such a robe as this,
And my immutable resolve.

La. Mal. Immutable? -- then we persuade, in vain.


M. W. I am bound to say
You have lost a worthy Gentleman; -- My self,
A noble Master; -- one that was a Man
Worth your best memory: the multitude
Of sighs you have sent after him, worth all
The expense of tears, you have bestowed upon him.
But when we look into his Tomb and there
See him locked up in Marble; -- in the still,
And sad imagined language of the Grave,
We are instructed, Nay, commanded Lady,
To period our vain grievings.

O. Gent. He has told you the naked truth on it.
It Is but in vain to grieve; -- For, is it not sed
The quick must live byth' quick, and not byth' dead?
He Is gone, -- Heaven be with him; -- He was a Gentleman;
An honest man; -- and, which is more; -- a proper Gentleman:
But, when Gentility, -- Honesty, -- and proportion,
Lie in the Grave once, I have done with 'em.

La. Mos. Thy tongue's my ceaseless torment.


La. Mal. Let me tell you,
That infinite of love you seem to have fixed,
Upon the heart of your departed Husband,
Loses no scruple, of the worth it has,
Placed on a second Husband.

O. Gent. Mark you that now?


La. Mal. Nay, I dare tell you, that in a second Match,
You love him more; more love, more honor him,
Then, in your mourning Widdowhood.

O. Gent. Mark you that now?


La. Mal. I Will make it open to you: whilst you keep
Incompast, with this solitude* a Widow,
You seem, to voice, to the ill censuring world,
Some imperfection in your self; some stain
Makes you unworthy of a second Match:
At lest, unworthy, of a worthy Husband,
And in the opinion, (which is easily raised)
Question your Husbands judgment. -- Or, it may be,
The estate he left you Lady; -- pulling so
Upon the Name, you strive to dignifie,
Disgrace, defames, and scandal.

O. Gent. Mark you that now?


La. Mal. If you so loved him living, love him dead,
As I advise you Lady.

O. Gent. I, I, do.


La. Mal. It Is the best Tombstone you can lay upon him;
The noblest Monument, you can erect;
And to that Monument, an Epitaph,
Shall make him live for ever.

O. Gent. Law you there now! -- Shall make him live for ever!
You are not dumb tro? -- are you?

La Mos. Would thou we^'t.
Or I had lost my hearing. -- I can wish
Nothing more adverse to me, then your tongues:
And therefore, if your visits bring with them
Nothing, but these persuasions.

La. Mal. Keep away.


O. Gent. Nay, as good speak't as think it. -- Here Is a coil for a Husband, I
have had for mine own part, -- 1. -- 2. -- 3. -- 4. And yet if the fifth come
up handsomely to me, -- I know what I know, I warrant you.


La, Mal. How five?


Enter M. William. O. Gent. Fifteen, an the Destinies so have decreed it.


M. Will. Madame, there be Suitors below would see you: M. Rash, the Mercer; --
one Plush, a humorous Gallant; -- and a spick and span new Suitor, a Country
Gentleman, -- one, M. Gregory Dwindle.


O. Gent. Spruce M. Rash I know.


La. Mal. And I M. Plush, a notable humorous Coxcomb. But what is that Gregory?


M. Will. Unknown to me: but believe me, together, They make up, a delicate
motion. -- Is your Ladyship pleased to see 'em?


La. Mal. Present your Motion some-where else, our griefs give way to no such
lightness.


M. Will. Very good. -- I Will tell them what you say:


L. Mal. Pray stay a little.
I know these Suitors are but empty things;
Not worth one serious entertain; yet Sister,
I would not have you beat them back, at door:
Pray let them enter; Let them look upon you.

La. Mos. Still your desire's, my anguish.


O. Gent. Come, come, pray. -- You are so melancholy.


La Mal. Why, their mirth -- will be a means to cure you.


La. Mos. Kill me rather.


O. Gent. Go, prithee bid them come.


La. Mos. Bid them be gone.


La. Mal. Nay, then, you are too too cruel. -- Prithee stay.


La. Mos. Nay, an you know no other merriment,
Then what you raise from my vexation, take it;
I will not hinder your desires; pray take it.

O. Gent. You will not leave us, will you?


La. Mos. Leave this room.


La. Mal. And go mew your self up in your Chamber?
An you will needs: -- Let me entreat one favor.

L. Mos. Well, what is it?


L. Mal. That, in your absence you would be pleased to let
Your waiting Gentlewoman, Mistress Barbary,
Appear in your apparel: It Is but slipping off
This upper garment; and this mourning Veil,
And she is my Lady.

M. Will. How? -- My Bab, my Lady!


L. Mal. It will be sport to us; and to your self
A rare advantage Sister: for this trick
Keeps all your foolish Suitors at that distance,
Their trouble shall never touch you. -- Will you?

O. Gent. Will you?


L. Mos. Though pleasure, be no pleasure to this bosom,
Since you propose th'acquittance of that trouble,
Your desire's granted.

L. Mal. But be speedy then
With your directions for her carriage in it, Exit L. Mosly.
And we shall fit 'em neatly. -- Call them in.

O. Gent. Did you ever see such a self-willed thing as this is? -- a widow
these two months, and yet not hear of a Suitor.


Enter M. William, Rash, Plush, and Gregory. M. Will. The Gentlemen, an't please
you.


Greg. Yes indeed, an't please you.


O. Gent. Master Rash.


Rash. Your servant, good deed law, Gentlewoman.


L. Mal. Master Plush.


Plush. My name is Plush; Master my Title, and Sir, a Title, that may be.


Greg. And my name is Gregory --


Plush. Fop: thy sound is out of season. -- But where is the Lady?


Rash. I, where is the Lady?


Greg. We would see the Lady.


Plush. I hope she has done mourning now, -- has she not?


Greg. Why, dos the Lady mourn?


M. Will. Indeed she dos.


Greg. It Is a delicate thing to mourn. -- Well, an my Father would but dye once!

Would we could see this Lady.


Enter Barbara, like her Lady, armed in by M. William. O. Gent. You have your
wish already.


Rash. Beauteous Lady!


Plush. Most beauteous Lady!


Greg. Most beautiful Lady, that may be: for yet, I see no such matter.


Plush. Thine eyes are veyl*d with ignorance, or else,
Through this thin veil, thou might, as we, -- behold
Matter of admiration! -- You Will vouchsafe; --
Not yet.

Bab. Alas: -- upon their Captive heart,
My sorrows yet have set too strong a Guard
For such delights to enter.

Plush. I could wish*
That Conqueror of thy heart, and all his Guard
Were visible, that I might challenge them.

M. Will. I marry sir; that we^e a challenge indeed.


Plush. Me thinks I could -- do --


La. Mal. What, do you think you could do Sir?


Plush. O -- my most delicate Lady!


M. Will. Do, -- his -- most delicate Lady. -- A terrible do, indeed law.


O Gent. Well Lady; if this be the man shall have you,
You shall have a man, I can tell you.

Greg. If I be the man that shall have her,
She shall have a man, I can tell you.

O Gent. But, he is a fighting man.


Greg. A fighting man? -- Let him play at the ancient weapon, an he were a
Fencing man, I Will have a Bout with him.


La. Mal. The ancient weapon? -- What weapon's that?


Greg. Why this?


His hand. M. Will. As wise, as valiant! it is the ancientst weapon indeed Sir.


La. Mal. And why not this?


His Rapier. Greg. I am better acquainted with this.


Plush. Well, we shall meet?


Greg. And meet again: -- Tell me of fighting Lady!


O Gent. I see you are valiant Sir; -- and you are happy
In having so much valor as you see
Attend your beauty.

Bab. I must confess them, worthy Gentlemen;
But they must pardon me: -- the worth I have lost,
With my dead husband, is so full, and fresh,
Upon my understanding, that all else
Have ^et but homely entertain: -- And yet,
You Are welcome Gentlemen. --

All 3. For that, we thank you.


Rash. We must hope still.


Greg. Well, an my Father would but dye once!
I live in hope too Lady.

M. Will. You see their valor Sir: -- and what is your weapon?


Rash. I am no man of the sword; -- I have no weapon.


O. Gent. How Sir? -- No weapon! --


M. Will. What should you do in Cupids fencing School, And have no weapon?


Rash. There was a time, -- I could have crossed a eudgell.


M. Will. And that you Sir?


Rash. Good sooth sometimes I can tell you: -- yet, if any man strike me, I
have a weapon too Sir.


M. Will. The coldest flint, has fire I see: What weapon?


Rash. One, that is indeed, -- All weapons. -- Long-Sword; Sword and Dagger; --
Sword and Buckler; Single Rapier, Rapier and Dagger; Case of Rapiers; Halbert,
Halfe-Pike; Quarter-Staffe; Short-Sword and Gauntlet; and that terrible
Fly-flap, the Fauchion.


All. All these in on^? --


Rash. Or one that is worth all these; -- and that, -- in a word, is the Law Sir.


M. Will. A terrible weapon indeed Sir.


Rash, There, let me firk 'em, and jerk 'em: There, Let me stand upon
Terms; -- There, Let me play the Master, and M. Atturny, my Usher, and then,
-- with all the weapons in that School, have at 'em.


En. Sir Rob. and Sir Oli. M. Will. This goes beyond your Rapier; or your
ancient weapon, the Fist.


L. Mal. Body of me, my husband, and Sir Oliver.


Bab. What Is to be done?


L. Mal. Do, as thou have done Wench.


O. Gent. Play the Lady, a little longer.


L. Mal. Handsomely Bab, and I Will promise thee, it shall cost me a Chamble^
Pettycoat.


Bab. I Will do it as well as I can then.


Sir Rob. Come, come, we will speak, and speed too, my Knight, of a thousand
per annum where is this mourning Lady? -- What, my Madona? -- and my Lady
Littleworth. Hoyday? This Covy of Coxcombs too!


Rash. Sir Robert.


Sir Rob One. --


Plu. Kind Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Two. --


Greg. Worthy Sir Robert. --


Sir Rob. Three, yet never a wise word amongst 'em. -- What, still in Du^bs,
and dolors? -- An ye were as heavy as Lead, 'twas but a light trick of you to
deny Access to such a brave man as this is, and allow't to such Mimicks as
these are. -- Death, ^ could kick them out of the room. And you, though you be
my wives sister, for lodging such baseness within you.


O. Gent. Why, you are not out of your wits?


Sir Rob. You have no wit to be out of. Gentlemen, you are all -- Hobbyhorses.
An it please you, to leave the house now; and come again, -- when you are sent
for, -- you shall be -- heartily glad, to be welcome.


La. Mal. You see his humor Gentlemen; pray leave us.


M. Will. There Is no resisting of him; for he has Rapier, fist, the law, and
all, for any man, that shall thwart him.


Greg. Why, but I hope --


L. Mal. Not one word more, an you love me.


M. Will. Off, ere the flame grow higher.


-- Exit the 3. Sir Rob. Come, take my counsel, and forget him.


Bab. Never.


Sir Oli. Still looking downward, to your husbands grave?


Bab. To those that wear so sad a suit as this,
The Grave's the glass they use to deck them by.
Pray give me leave.

L. Mal. She dos it to a hair.


Sir Rob. Prithee look up a little; -- I can show thee
A Glass, shall show thee better things; -- a Glass,
That shall reflect, no such affrighting shadows --

Sir Oli. Nor shadows (beauteous Lady) but the same
True, and essential comforts.

Bab. O. -- O. -- O.


M. Will. Excellent, mourning Lady.


Sir Rob. The Nuptial knot, binds loving Paires together,
Only for term of life, has no extent
Over the divorce of Death.

Bab. Pray, pray no more.


Sir Oli. That only binds the living to the living,
And not the living to the dead.

Sir Rob. That flesh that has a soul within it, the indowments,
And excellencies, bounteous Heaven bestows,
To that, has nothing but the frightfull shape,
And key-cold figure of a man.

Sir Oli. Yet this,
While thus, you dote upon your husbands dust,
You do sweet Lady; and this beauty bind
To stenches, and corruption; so imposing
Upon your self Mezentius cruelty.

Bab. You have my resolution; so, pray leave me.


Sir Oli. An you be buried in your Husbands grave,
I see my suit must dye too.

Sir Rob. Yes, and let it
For ever, Let it die to her, and live
To one that better shall deserve it: come,
I Will bring thee, though she be mine own Madona's Sister,
My Knight, of a thousand per annum, to her betters: -- one that is younger,
fairer, richer, and it may be, -- Honester too Sir.

L. Mal. How Sir Robert? Honester.


O. Gent. Honester?


Sir Rob. An she prostrate her self to a set of Morrisdancers; -- and neglect
such a Caesar as this is. -- Come Sir Oliver, come, let us away.


L. Mal. Nay, but hark you, hark you Sir Robert; and worthy Sir Oliver; that
you may see this Lady,
Is not the woman that you take her for;
Look, do you know this Lady?

Sir Rob. How, Mistress Bab?


Sir Oli. My Ladies Chambermaid!


M. Will. A trick of mirth they put upon these Coxcombs.


Sir Rob. Were you my Lady?


Bab. So, your Lady would have it, Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Why, god-a-mercie faith.


M. Will. There Is all the comfort they are like to have.


L. Mal. This cloud's like Juno; the poor shadow Sir.
The substance, we will court for you.

Sir Rob. My Lady Bab. -- How like you this Sir Oliver?


Sir Oli. This change, has put some life into me Sir.
And I must tell you, betterd my opinion
Both of the Ladies wisdom, and her goodness.

Sir Rob. But hark you wife, may we not see my Sister?


L. Mal. ^aith, yet her temper is not as We Would have it:
But we shall win her by degrees, and turn
Her melancholy to a sprightly humor.

O. Gent. A day, or two days passage.


Sir Rob. Come Sir Oliver.
Mean time we will see what mirth my house can yield
To entertain you with. -- A ha, my Girl!
Why such a Wench is worth her weight in Pearl.

Exit. M. Will. Well, thou have played my Lady, like a Lady.
I have a trick from this conceit, to do,
Shall make us sport, and help thy swelling too.

Exit. Act. 2.
Enter old Thrashard, and Margaret his daughter, neatly dressed. Margaret. Sir, I
have spoke my danger.


Thra. A dangerous case believe me.
And yet, me thinks, there is no great danger neither.
For, say a man offer to blow thee up with Love-powder,
If his train lie so open, you may see it, you have the wit I hope to shun it;
-- h'an't you.

Marg. I have done hitherto.


Thra. And do thou fear, -- thou shall hold out no longer?


Marg. Sir, I do not.
For, all the policies, and power he has,
Can never prevail to conquest. -- No, tho fear
Be to our Sex a common attribute;
In such a fight as this, my resolution
Has that Heroic temper, I dare meet
My death, e're my dishonor: -- my dishonor!
For virtue's virtue, in what breast soere,
And her great splendor, equal.

Thra. Splend? -- Heyday!
But to the point, what is he? -- Do I know him?

Mar. Yes, if you know Sir Robert Malory, Your Landlord Father.


Thra. How Sir Robert?


Marg. He. -- Sometimes, -- (tho clouded in a course disguise)
He lays temptations to mine ear himself:
Sometimes by deputy; sometimes by Letters;
And sometimes by rich gifts. -- As if that Jemme
(Once gone) can never be bought back again,
Were to be fold so basely. -- Here Is my sore,
Assist me in the remedy.

Thra. Sir Robert!
He aim against thy chastity? Alas.
Has he bestowed upon thine Infancy,
That care, and cost, that he has done? -- Maintained thee
Among his own? -- Fed thee among his own?
Apparrel'd thee, as he has clothed his own?
In the same School, in the same qualities,
Had thee instructed with his own? -- Has he
So beautified thy mind? -- So graced thy body!
So many years in his own house! -- And now --
(So close his favors follow thee) -- does he
Maintain thee here? -- Here in this homely Roof,
A star to that poor glimmering candle light,
My poverty could afford thee! -- And for this,
Is this the best you can return him?

Marg. No -- Father, for these should I forget to pay,
The most obsequious duties I can tender,
'Twere just in heaven I should forget my self.

Thra. Had this been spoke of any other man.
I might have lent an ear to it: -- but, Sir Robert!
Noble Sir Robert! -- that brave man, Sir Robert!
Our bountious Benefactor! -- Say he have
Scattered some words in the way of merriment,
Some pleasant, idle, -- wanton, -- what d' ye called?
Sprinkled a little Bawdry in his speech?
(As Courtiers may, and never be questioned for it)
That cuts not off a May denhead. -- Nay, perchance
The merriment, that you in erpret lust,
Was his mere love to virtue.

Marg. Virtue!


Thra. Yes. -- It Is my conceit, that all his talk, -- his
Letters, and all the gifts he sent thee, were employed,
(...)' way of trial: -- Not to make thee naught;
But, so to sound thy goodness.

Mar. Sound my goodness!


Thra. Not to overcome thy chastity; but to try
If any other should assail the Fort,
How stoutly thoud'st maintain it.

Marg. Think you so?
I Will think so too then Father: -- Let him try me.
But jest, or earnest, he shall never come nigh me.

Ent. Gillian. Gil. Why, this is fine, you have the golden time on it.


Thra. What golden time? -- You Will still be scolding.


Gil. Scolding! -- Mary come up Mistress Jinnie-^innie; We cannot speak to you,
but we scold. -- Well, I say little.


Thra. Nothing at all were better.


Gil. But I Will say something; Has a woman a tongue to say nothing?


Marg. Prithee be patient Sister.


Gil. Yes I waun't you. I must wash, and scowre; And Brew, and Bake, and do
this thing, -- and do that thing; and do every thing; while such a beautiful
Blowse as you are, must sit still of your tail, and do nothing.


Thra. Why, do thou not see her at her work?


Gil. At wo^k! -- A geate peyce o work, a deed law! -- Prick, prick, prick. --
As if she had nothing in the world to mind -- but Prick, Prick, Prick. -- But
it is no matter, -- it is but my hard fortune; I am a fool indeed, and so you
make me.


Thra. What, what, a shower after this peale of thunder? -- Na^, do not cry
good Gillian.


Enter Abram. Abr. O, Father, Father.


Thra. Now Boy, what news with you now?


Abr. Brave news Father, -- News of the brave Sir Robert


Mar. Pursue me still? -- Good Father give me leave,
While he is come in, and gone again. --

Thra. What leave?


Mar. To abs^nt my self; -- but in some neighbors house:
I have a trick to pass him -- You may tell him,
I Am gone to London.

Abr. When I have told him already, you are here in the Parlor a sewing.


Thra. Come, you are a Baggage; you are a foolish Baggage,
To injure with such frivolous suspi^ions,
A Gentleman of his repute, and goodness!
Come, let me hear no more on it.

Abr. Sister Gillian, -- I have the rarest news for you!


Gil. For me*tis well;* And what news have you got for me Sir?


Abr. Skipping news, lipping news, tripping news.


Gil. How, Dancing brother Abr'am? -- Dancing!


Abr. Prancing, advancing, dancing!
Nay, it is a Match; -- a Match upon a Wager.

Gil. A Match. -- Who be they?


Abra. Why, all the Maids of our Town Edmonton,
And all the mad Wenches of Waltam.

Gil. A Match, and leave me out? -- When, when is it Brother?


Abra. Mary, ^e'n this morning; -- they are now going to it, helter skelter.


A Treble plays within. Gil. And leave me out? -- Where brother Abram? where?


Abr. Why there, Sister Gillian; there. -- At our own door almost: O^ the
Green there, close by the May Pole. Hark, you may hear them hither.


Gillian dances and sings. Gil. Ta la la la leero, ta la, la leero -- etc.
An I be not one. --

Exit. Abra. Thou't never be two, I think; -- For on my conscience, there is no
man that knows her, has valor enough, to come near her*


Thra. Why, well said Girl, keep but that resolution, Enter Sir Robert Mal^ry.
And let his purposes, be what they can,
They cannot hurt thee. -- Look, he is come already.

Sir Rob. Good morrow Tennant; -- good morrow beautiful Tennant.


Thra. As much to my worthy Landlord.


Abra. As much to my worthy Landlord.


Sir Rob. My Tennant Abra'm! -- God-a-mercy good
Tennant Abra'm.
I want your welcome fair one.

Mar. Sir, you are welcome.


Sir Rob. Had this bi^ spoke, with smiles upon thy cheek,
I durst have sworn the Syllables had been
The Language of thy heart; thy heart, sweet Peggy.
What, still so adverse to my pleasure? -- Tennant --
And my young Tennant; -- shall I crave the Room?
I have something to deliver from my Lady,
That she would have a secret to the Ear
Of any, But fair Margaret.

Thra. The Room?
Our poverty possesses nothing Sir,
But what is yours; you may command it. -- Come.

Abra. I smell my Landlord; but, -- no words but mum.


Exit Thrash, and Abram. Sir Rob. Still, still this cloud upon thy brow sweet
Peg?
You know my mind.

Mar. And you know mine Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. I mean, I love thee, my sweet Peggy.


Mar. Do you? -- Not half so well as I love you.


Sir Rob. Love me!
Then there is some hope again. -- Why, god-a-mercy,
Let Us see how handsomely thou't give thy body
To my embraces Girl. -- How, fly them Peg?
Not kiss me neither? -- such a thing denied,
How can thou say thou love me?

Mar. Yes Sir Robert:
I love you in your Name: your Reputation;
The dignity you carry in your years;
The goodness should go with them; -- In your Lady;
I love you Sir, in the fair Benevolence
You owe her virtues.

Sir Rob. Hoyday; -- Love me q^ha! -- Nay, come, come.


Mar. I love you in your vows.
Those Nuptial vows, that whilst you live should live
Unstained between you: -- In a word Sir Robert,
I love you in that purity, -- that shall,
When death shall threaten your last minute to you,
Make you look boldly on him; smile upon him;
And in conclusion, seal you, one of those,
That, from this veyle of trouble, he conveyes
To the purity of Angels: -- Thus, I love you.

Rob. This is not that I look for: hark you Margaret;
Your Father is my Tennant.

Mar. Sir, he is.


Sir Rob. Nay, since you urge it, let me tell you Minion,
He Is not my Tennant, neither; but my Beadsman.

Mar. And like an humble Beadsman, in his Prayers
Remembers all your Charity.

Sir Rob. He does: -- But you forget it fair one.


Mar. Then let heaven,
Whence we Petition, the Reward it merits,
Forget me too.

Sir Rob. Is It not forgetfulness
When all the love, -- the tender cares, and cost,
That from thy Infancy, to this Ripe grows,
I have bestowed upon you, cannot gain me
Such a request as this is!

Mar. This? Alas.
Your greatest gaine's in losing. -- Nay, I Will tell you,
The love, the care, -- that cost, that Noble breeding,
That seems to you a winning Argument,
Is my best Argument against you.

Sir Rob. How?


Mar. Why Sir, the Education; -- that fair breeding
You have bestowed upon my poverty,
Has made me what I am: -- So copiously
Furnished my soul, with all that best adornes her,
That whatsoere's in opposition to it,
Has no admittance to her; -- Near her; -- No, --
But, -- most deservedly, do rank themselves
With things, that most displease her. -- Such a thing, -- is --

Sir Rob. What? -- My Love?


Mar. No, but your lust Sir Robert. -- I am bold,
But I can kneel to beg your mercy for it.

Kneel. Sir Rob. What, she imagines water to my flame,
Is oil t'encreas't: the more she puts me off,
The more she pulls me to her. -- Come, come rise,
Though you be so unkind; -- Come, prithee kis me. Kis her*
Why, God a mercy Peg; -- again, again;
Why, this is somewhat yet: We must not look
At once, to have so great a happiness
As that we aim at. We must use degrees.
Lock me, once more, in thy embrace, and busse me,
And then. --

Mar. What then?


Sir Rob. For this time Peg I Will leave thee. --
What, leave thee, and leave nothing with thee Wench?
Nay, that were foul play Peggy: there, -- Nay, take it.
Indeed you shall.

Mar. Indeed, indeed I wonot:
For any service, I can do you Sir,
Your favour's price sufficient. -- No, not yet?
I see, mine eye's a Remora: -- I have it.
How I forget my duty? -- Here so long,
And never a Chair to ease you? -- Abra'm, -- Brother.
Pray pardon me Sir Robert.

Enter Abram. Sir Rob. How, a Chair? -- Kinder, and kinder still.


Mar. Come, come, a Chair there for Sir Robert.


Abra. She pitties your standing Sir Robert. -- But I have a Chair,
Almost at my fingers end. -- Look you Sir,
Will it please you. Bum this Cushion?

Sir Rob. How, Bum it ^ennant?


Abra. Yes, Bum it Landlord: -- Look you Sir, of this fashion.


Sit. Mar. Come, you will be foolish still. -- You know my mind. Go, bring ^*m in.


Whisper. Abr. An I bring them not in, let Sir Rob. kick me out.


Exit. Mar. Lord, how forgetful I have been Sir Robert? But, I beseech your
pardon.


Sir Rob. Pardon thee?
And seal't upon thy lip; -- Come prithee sit. Treble within.
Nay, nay, sit by me; -- Never a stool? -- Sit here then.

Mar. Be fairly civil Sir; -- Nay, good Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. How now, -- what is that?


Mar. Music Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Music? -- Rot on their fiddle, and their fiddle strings,
Thou art my Music. -- Hoyday, here is a Morice.

Enter six Country Wenches, all red Pettycoates, white stitched Bodies, in
their Smock-sleeves, the Fiddler before them, and Gillian, with her Tippet up,
in the midst of them dancing* Abram with them. Gil. You see we swet to make your
Worship merry.
How do you like our pastime?

Sir Rob. I like it so well, I could wish you were further off with it.


Mayds. Have we this for our kindness Sir Robert?


Gil. Mary, come up Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Nay, there is no talking to them.
Come, in the heat, and height, of all her kindness!

Mar. Shall I entreat you, Leave the Room?


Mayds. The Room!


Abra. So she sed: but I know she means no such matter, -- only a trick:

Tell her, you wonnot go.


Mar. Pray leave the Room.


Mayds. We wonnot.


Mar. Wonnot?


Maid. No.


Peg. We were sent for in; and we wonot go out again yet.


Maid. An your Knighthood were --


Peg. -- A 1000 pounds purchase.


Sir Rob. Hoyday, they will bayt me, -- and they wonot I must.


Gil. Out? -- Marry gip there, never a good inch of a thousand. -- Fiddler,
strike.

I strike you else; -- and cut your begging bowstrings.


Sir Rob. I must be gone I see: these miserably impudent stallions -- Do but
remember me, as I shall thee; -- and -- Nothing greeves me, -- but --


Mar. But what Sir Robert?


Sir Rob. That, -- we cannot kiss at parting --


Exit. Gil. Come, -- we will even have the the other ^out, -- and then. --


Mar. Nay, we will no more at this time ^here's enough.


Gil. For you: -- But it is not enough for me then:
You shall command us, shall you?

Mar. Nay, be not angry Sister:
It Is no command, but my entreat: -- Good Sister.

Peg. Well, since you entreat me, and seem to know your betters, -- you shall
have your will, for once. -- Fid. lead the way; -- and Wenches follow your
Leader.


Exit Fid. and the Maids. Abr Leader. -- An scolding were fighting, what a
Leader would thou be Gillian? -- Thoudst bring 'em on, with a powder. O
Father, Father.


Enter old Thrashard. Thra. Never a wise word, for a wager. -- Sir Robert's gone
I see.


Mar. Yes Sir, he is.


Thra. And how do find him Girl? I do not think
The man, that thy suspicion seemed to make him.

Mar. You have a good opinion of him Father,
And, I Will not stand to cross it.

Thra. Nay, nay, come;
In plain terms, tell me* how did find him? -- ha?

Mar. As good conceal't, and languish, as reveal't,
And find no comfort.

Thra. Thou Art a pertish thing:
And -- I Am afraid, have been distasteful to him:
I Am half afraid on it Girl: -- we must be wise;
By's ^own we fall Wench; by his favors rise.

Exeunt. Enter Sir Oliver Bellingham, and the Lady Mosely. Sir Oli. Distilling
still, salt water to deface
That Masterpiece of Nature? -- Can the heart
Thus feast it self, upon the Baine of hearts?
For such is grief sweet Lady.

Lady. Good enough*
To make this flesh as my dead Husbands is,
A banquet to corruption.

Sir Oli. Still that Note?
Touch only that dull string of death?

Lad. When life
Would willingly exchange it self with Death,
What Music sweeter?

Sir Oli. I must tell you Lady,
I thought the Music of your Husbands end,
Those heavenly Notes he entertained it with,
Taught him by Angels, had instructed you,
To look upon that Being that he has,
As he is a glorious Chorister with them!
And not upon that Burden of the flesh
Left in the Grave behind him. -- Or at least,
Not so, to look upon your Husband dead,
As thus, to dye your self. For what is it, while
Of Life's best hopes, you shall your Life deprive,
But what I tell you? -- to be dead, alive.

Lad. Sir, as I am, pray leave me.


Sir Oli. Only so? -- Out-ryvald by the dead.


Lad. To me he lives:
And in so vive a figure, every houre's
Presented to me, that I feel no less
Command o*re my ^ffections in that shape;
Nor less Attraction of my duty to it,
Then when he had that hear, gave all those parts,
That now ly^ useless, their peculiar motion.
Nay, so that shape*s impressed upon my soul,
That he appears so really mine own,
As, all the embraces of a second March
Would ^ick upon me, like the leaprous stains
Of Lust, and base Adultry. In a word*
That figure (...) his bosom: -- And in this
Pray understand the vainenesse of your suit,
And so* conclude it.

Sir Oli This command upon it,
It dies, though I dye with it. -- Yet thus much Lady,
I have not, in this eagerness of Suit,
Pu^sued, what is yours, But you. -- The gifts of Fortune;
The state your birth allowed you* or th'addition,
By your lost husband, left you; But the indowments
Of your fair soul, -- your virtues, -- And of those
The ampl^st Dower, (I cannot slatter here)
Beauty was ever blessed withal! These Lady
Have been the object of my Love.

Lad. A Love,
That, could I love, I should even dote upon;
And in a Title, far beneath your own,
Prefer^t, above all Title; though it came
Roab^d in the state of Princes. -- But --

Sir Oli. No more.
I have my answer, and am married.

Lad. Married!


Sir Oli. As you are Madam; never to be married:
Be that the witness of my Love.

Lad. Admired!
I should not be a woman, should I not
Love such a Love as this is!

Sir Oli. Do you Lady?
Then, I revoke that Vow, and dare embrace you.

Lad. But understand me Sir* I love your Love:
And -- as your self, have pleased to speak of me
Those singular Virtues, it is built upon*
That, I am fixed on; with that estimate,
That, next the memory of my dead husband,
I^ shall be my best comfort. -- Thus I love you;
But, must not marrye.

Sir Oliver. I have done. -- Yet Lady
In this; -- this purest, Imateriall things
There may be made a contract; and the assurance
Of such a Love, as this is, Interchang'd
And fairelie sealed between us.

Lad. Sir, how mean you?


Sir Oli. Fairest, you have vowed your widowhood to the grave,
At least, you have so protested: yet because
Our hearts, and purposes, are not our own;
And, that no Bosom has that Constancy,
But Heavens may alter, the resolve it has,
And make it follow, what it fled; -- it may.
My Love Petitions, that if ere hereafter,
You find that alteration, in your soul,
And again Fancy Wedlock, -- I -- your servant,
May -- for that second happiness to heaven,
Stand fairest in your Election.

Lad. Pray no more.


Sir Oli. Give my request an answer: -- If you do.


Lad. A fruitless promise: and suppose it made,
This would but --

Sir Oli. What? -- I understand you Lady.
It shall not make me bolder, in my suite;
Nor prompt my love, in any treacherous way
To gain, what it so follows. -- No; I know
The man, would basely, compass such a Joy,
Like him that fishes with a poisoned Bayte,
Infects the meat should feed him. -- fairest, I wo'not;
Nor vex you with one syllable; but Live,
Vowed, like your self, till such a change shall be
To amorou^ Language, silent. -- Is it granted?
If my b^st thoughts merit but this, express it

Lad. That satisfaction take. -- If ere I Marry
It shall be you; so help me heaven.

Sir Oli. To which
I am rapt in this sweet tone. -- If ere I know
The sweetes of Hymen, I must find'em here;
So help me heaven! -- So, we are married now:
And in this Joy I leave you.

Enter the Lady Malorie, and the old Gentlewoman. La. Mal. What Sir Oliver?
going
As we are entering?

O Genesis Does your Lady, drive you hence with a frown?


Sir Oli. My smiles may tell you, here has bin no frowning.
She Is fair and noble; and in these sweet hopes, Enter Sir Rob. Malorie.
That she has given me, I am pleased.

O Genesis '^is well.


Sir Rob. A vengeance of all morris dauncers*
I am sure, they h'a marred, my dancing: that delicate dance
That I should have had with my tenant.

Sir Oli. All Joy be with you Ladies; I must leave you,


Sir Rob. Here Is a ^ub in your way a while, my brave
Knight, of a 1000. per Annum.
And how do find her? -- is she coming? ha?

Sir Oli. You see my hop^s set smiles upon my cheek,
Let them resolve you sir.

Sir Rob. I understand you:
Why? god a mercy sister: when is the day?

Sir Oli. Nay, question that no farther, we shall talk on it.


O Genesis When a things done, it is done.


Sir Rob. You Would feign be doing to then.


Enter Mr. William O. Gent. Would I not?
Do you think I am all dead flesh? -- I warrant you.

Sir Rob. Now Mr. William? -- what good tidings now sir?


Mr. Wi. My news is, worthy sir, that Mullinex
That stout sea Captain, is returned from sea:
Is come to London, and that yesterday*
He was upon the Exchange.

Sir Rob. George Mullinex?


Mr. Wi. That Gentleman: -- and but this morning Lady,
He wa^ seen at the Phaenix, in fleeet-street.

Sir Rob. Body of me I should have told you so -- but, I
Have such a Memory --!

^. Oli. How ^'st? -- ha? -- you lose color (...).


O Gent. Lady.


La. Mal Sister


Sir Oli. Beshrew the name, and owner of that name
That has disturbed you. -- what is that name to you?

La. Mos. Sir, nothing but my trouble.


Sir Rob. A troublesome Captain indeed sir,
A suytor once, in her virgin days
And Rival to her husband, Sir James Mosely.
But, mis'd the mark he aimed at -- he shot saire*
But Mosely fairer. -- upon which, Sir Oliver
He went to sea; where having bin three years,
And now Returning, hearing, (as it seems)
That she is a widow, he would renew his suite,
Give her a broadside sir, and board her! Nay
Yave a hot Ryvall, I can tell you that:
One that will Quarrel; -- fight -- and -- by my fay --
I Am half afraid of danger.

Sir Oli. If he be not,
All valor, and no judgment, I fear none;
And yet, that heat, that has not judgment with it,
Cannot be counted valor, but a rash
Unknowing wil^nesse, -- which I wo'not think
Him guilty of; -- But, whatsoever he be,
I Will be, but what becomes me.

O. Gent. Leave the Room.


La. Mal. Good truth now, but you shall not.


Sir Oli. Leave the Room? -- What fear you Lady?


La. Mos. I have cause enough,
For he will but trouble me with that, heaven knows
I have no mind to hear of.

Sir Oli. If he have
No power upon you Lady by some promise,
Formerly past between you --

La. Mos. I had never,
That unprepar'dnesse in me, to do that
In cause of such a Consequence as this,
And break it sir.

Sir Oli. Such Beauty, and untruth
Were never comoanions: it is believed.

L. Mal. Come, come,
It may be, some new Beauty has him now:
Some Foreign Mistress.

Enter Rash, Plush, and Gregory. Sir Rob. Or, it may be sister,
This time of service in the wars, had made him
Only in love, with fighting.

La. Mose. More vexation?


Sir Rob. This Mountain, bring forth a Mouse*
Have we talked all this while of a Captain,
And now, must be troubled, with Coxcombs?

Plu. The gods, protect you Lady.


O Genesis Thank you sir.


Plu. I spoake to that sweet Beauty.


O genesis But I must speak to you sir; for you see she has other employment,
Pray, stand aside a little.

Plu. If I must -- I shall attend her leisure.


O Genesis You must attend her too sir: -- do you not see, she is busy?


Rash. I would not interrupt her.


Greg. I would not interrupt her? -- Is that the resolution of a Lover?
Let me come to her.

Sir Oli. But, you shall not sir.


Greg. Why? if I shall not sir, -- I wo'not sir.


Sir Rob. Is that the resolution of a Lover?


Enter Capt. Mullyneux rushing in by Mr. William and others. Greg. A man can
do, no more then a can do,
But, an my father would but dye once!

Capt. Make nyce to me of entrance?
Where Is the Widow?
For so I hear she is now: what mourning still?
I Am a bold gamester: -- Save you all at once.
All suitors Gentlemen?

Rash. Yes indeed sir; we are all suitors.


Sir Rob. You Are a little too rash in that sir; I am none.


Capt. And, what, are you sir?


Rash. Why sir, -- I am, -- a Citizen, and a Mercer.


Capt. A Citizen, and a Mercer, -- Cheapside?


Sir Rob. No Captain; -- but he is perfect in his Pater noster.


Capt. One of that row? -- I know it sir.


Sir Rob. Not very far from it: -- In Creed sir.


Capt. Does he believe? that is seldom found in a Broker.


Rash. How sir, -- a Broker?


Capt. I know you by this wheel. -- you have a great many Bags, and a great
many buildings to sir. -- But, dare you for all that, presume in the way of
Matrimony, to look so high as a Lady?


Rash He that can purchase a Lordship --


Capt. Thinks, he may purchase a Ladyship: -- you my Rival? Can you fight sir?


Rash. It may be I, it may be no sir.


Cap. Then I Will try, whether you can or no sir. Kicks him and thrust him out.
Not a word, as you love your Coxcomb^.

Sir Rob. Nay, let him alone; let him alone, I beseech you,
For hitherto he has done but Justice.

Capt. Are you a Suitor too sir?


Plu. Too sir?


Capt. You Are an Ass sir: -- Can you fight?


Plu. Fight? in a Ladies chamber?


Capt. Why, where would you fight sir?


Plu. Why, the truth on it is; -- I would -- fight, -- no where.


Capt. Why, I thought as much; -- and therefore, -- I will kick you -- any
where; good master outside of a Gentleman; follow your valiant Leader.


O. Genesis You will not kill him, will you?


Kick him out. Capt. Have you so much Tongue, and never a good Tooth, Madam
Fumble!


O. Genesis Fumble, fumble! -- you are a most --


Sir Rob. Peace, an you love your old Carcass, -- peace.


La Mose. You bind me to a patience --


Sir Rob. Nay, good Sister: -- He does you a great deal a right,
And saves me a great deal of labor.
For I should have don't, if he had not.

Capt. One post support another? -- What are you sir?


Greg. Why, -- I am -- a Gentleman. --


Capt. Will your Arms bear you out in the Title?


Greg. My Legs, shall bear me out sir.


Capt. Then -- you wo'not be beat out -- as they were?


Greg. -- Beat, I should be very loath to be beaten?


Capt. -- good truth, I think you would sir.


Greg. Do I look like one that would be beaten?


Capt. An you stay, you must.


Greg. Why therefore, -- I mean, -- to be gone sir. -- But -- If my father, --
would but dye once. --


Kick him out. La Mos. You see his rudeness: -- to prevent the danger,
It threatens, and may execute, -- pray leave us.

Sir Oli. I will not add to his too prodigal heat.
Nor be so cold to fear it.

La. Mos. It Is my Love --


Sir Oli. And mine to tarry, -- not offending you
In The humble contradiction.

Cap. Are these your suitors Lady?


La. Mal. A little in jest; -- but you have paid 'em in earnest.


O. Genesis I did but speak, in the way of compassion and pity, -- and your
Lordship called me, -- Madam fumble, fumble, fumble *

Did I ever fumble wo'you sir?


Capt Be wise in being silent,
I hear you have lost a Husb^nd: -- How is it Widow?

O. Gent. You Will quarrel with her too, will you?


Capt. You are so nyce:
I cannot Complement, kiss your white hand,
And fleare upon ^ou. -- I can kiss thy lip.
Hug thee, and tell thee, I must ly with thee.

La. Mos. There may be those of your acquaintance Captain,
To whom this language would be music: -- But
To let you know how ill't appears to me,
I Will change my room sir.

Capt. But you shall not Madam.


Sir Oli. You lay too rude a violence, upon
The tenderness of Ladies.

Capt. Do I so sir?
I thank your kind remembrance, -- you the man?
This Ladies only man sir?

Sir Oli. My desire's, -- you would not be uncivil.


Capt. What so ere
My will produces, I shall justify.

Sir Oli. That power maintains offense, is weakness sir,
And has no taste of breeding, or of manhood.

Capt. I Will make you taste of something.


Sir Rob. But you shall not Enter Mr. William, and Cut.
Have we no servants near us?

La. Mos. Save him, help.


O. Gent. O, you are a wicked Captain.


Cut. What? naked weapons in a Ladies chamber?


Sir To. Take her in, -- poor Lady, Exit La. Mosley.
How she is frighted?

Enter (...). Hugh. My Noble Knight and Master.


Sir Oli. We have done sir.


Hu. An you have done, there is nothing to do; -- If nothing to do, -- the less
to care for; -- the less to care for, -- the ^ounder we sleep: -- and
asleep, we think no body hurt sir. -- And so -- having done, I have done.


Exit. Capt. You have the advantage of me.


Sir Oli. I must tell you,
This rudeness, better would become the field
Then such a place as this.

Capt. That you may know,
I know as much, as you instruct me to,
Meet me to morrow. -- You conceive me.

Sir Oli. Where?


Capt. Where? -- as your self have most discreetly said,
My valor would show better: -- in the field sir.

Sir Oli. I understand you; -- understand withal,
A life, a thing too precious, to be put
On such a desperate hazard.

Cap. Desperate hazard?


Sir Oli. You have not moved me to that heat, shall give you
One mis-beseeming syllable: -- much less
Provoke, to what you urge.

Capt. You wo'not?


Sir Oli. No.


Capt. As good h'a said you dare not.


Sir Oli. Dare not? -- What?


Capt. Not be a man.


Sir Oli. You better might have sed
I dare not, dare my Maker; -- and un-make
My self, or you rash Captain, -- 't may be both;
It Is to be thought on, if we meet.

Capt. It is
Pretty Apology; All Cowards, use it.

Sir Oli. How, Cowards?


Capt. Coward.


Sir Oli. How his lunacie
Has shot it self into my Blood? -- a Coward!
Proclaim me, what you call me, if I be

Capt. You Will meet me then?


Sir Oli. I will.


Capt. Where thou, or I.


Sir Oli. Nay, -- if you break so violently out Here Sir Robert Malory and his
Lady return. Embraces between them.
I shall suspect, 't is to prevent our meeting:
For Manhood covers such intents as these
Under a friendly seeming: -- thus. --

Capt. Enough.


Sir Rob. I marry Gentlemen, I like this close.


La. Mal. Believe me, I was jealous of worse matters.


Sir To And I, never trust me else.


Capt. Of what, Sir Robert?


Sir Rob. I thought you had made some Quarrel.


Sir Oli. Quarrel? no -- this is no quarrelling Posture.


La. Mal. Nay, nay, Gentlemen; so fight and spare not.


Sir To. I Will so fight and spare not.


Capt. You know the place, and time sir.


Enter Cut, and whisper with his Lady. Sir Oli You shall find I Will forget
neither.


Capt. You see my length.


Sir Oli. Which I shall equal.


Capt. So. --

Now, Beauteous widow: -- Is she gone?
I have no Courtship to pursue her with,
Nor will I offer it: -- but, Let me tell you,
He that best hopes her Favor, if he have it;
He must bid fayrer for it then this sword,
And so I leave you.

Exit. La. Mal: A good riddance of you


Sir Rob. How is it sir? -- your eye speaks trouble still.


Sir Oli: Sir, if it do, it is only what it has,
From your fair sisters trouble, -- I must leave you
Till better hours invite me to return,
My Love and service to you.

Sir Rob. Nay sir Oliver,
Our ways, -- a Little way, Lie both together;
And so far, we'll be so

Ex. the two Knights. L. Mal: Is It possible?
Be sure, you raise not this suspicion si^
From your own fancy, Look the ground be good;
The matter's weighty; -- Look it be, you are best.

Cut: I tell you, but the voice in Edmonton. -- which is
That Mistress Margaret, is his modicum.
His sweet-meat;* his recreation; and the only Instrument,
He loves to play upon.

L. Mall: Indeed sir Robert?


Cut. Whether she, like wax
Have t'ane the impression of his seal, or no,
I know not

Lady. That he is often at her Fathers house
That he allows his poverty some means:
That he maintains the wench, as one that sometimes
His charity, had taken to protection
I am not ignorant: -- Nor has it bin
More then has gone with my Consent, and passed
Without suspicion of the smallest spark
Of Lust in old sir Robert.

Cut. Nay I know not


Lad. I will not to be too easy, to believe,
Nor yet too confident. I know there is fire
In such a wenches eye; -- and old dry wood
Will soon be kindled: -- If I find h^ be,
I Will find a way to cool him: coole'em both Exeunt
We'll all, or nothing, for half shares we Loath.

Act. 3.
Enter Thrashard, with a Letter: Margaret, Gillian, and Abr'am. Thra. sir
Robert's hand? -- ar't sure on it?


Mar. I am too sure,


Thra. And sent to thee last night?


Gill. I, by this day, was it father* -- I know it to be his hand
What do you think of this now?

Thra. I know not what to think.


Mar. You see the picture of a lustful heart
Drawn to the life; -- and with it, what a number
Of foul temptations, he has mustered up,
To dim, the star-like purity of mine:
But all, no more, against my Constancy,
Then storms of hail, against a tower; -- or waves
Against a rock, that beating are beat back
As they begin t'assaile 'em.

Thra. I believe thee* -- yet old sir Robert.


Gill. Yes, even old sir Robert. Enter the Lad. Mallory as a poor woman.
Who have we here? a Beggar?

Abra. An she desire any thing here,
I Will desire her to be gone, with a vengeance.
Who would you speak withal? -- Hum.

Lady. A poor old woman; be not offended sir.


Abr. And what would'^t thou have, poor old woman?


Lady. My business, is to you.


Mar. To me? what is it.


Lady. I would delyver't to your self


Mar. My self?
What ere it be, do not fear to speak it,
I cannot fear to hear it.

Thra. What is it woman?


Lady. Indeed my charge is mistress, to delyver't
To your own hearing.

Thar. This is strange.


Gill. -- what is it?


Lady. Though I may speak it; since you fall into
Causeless suspicions of me -- either hear me,
As I am willing to present it to you,
Or -- as I am, I Will leave you.

Gill. Leave us? -- Hoydeye -- Mary come up goody tatters*


Thr. Your tongue must still be running. -- Hark you woman.


Lad. I must be Breife.


Abr. You are very tedious me thinks.


Thr. Take your own course we will leave you. -- Nay, nay, come.
We shall know all anon. -- thoud'st feign be scoulding.
On, or I Will set you forward.

Ext. Thrash, Gill, Abra. Mar. Now to this private business: what is it?


Lad. That happiness that to a beauty, set
In a degree, no fayrer then your own
Should be exceeding welcome.

Mar. Ha, What is it?


Lad. I bring you love: and to assure you it is
A love that is worth, the Entertain it seeks
And fit to find repose upon the heart
Of such a Matchless beauty* as your own, (Caskinet)
Have brought this witness. -- it is a fair one.

Mar. It Is -- If no foul end attend it.


Lad. come, be wise:
What my poor Artlesse tongue shall fail in, let
This never failing orator supply,
And with his golden tongue, inform you, (fair one)
That he that sends it, -- for the End he seeks,
Shall tender to you, whatsoever can fall
Within the compass, of your wish.

Mar. Good heaven!


Lad. A lusty offer for that short delight
The gentleman would purchase.

Mar. It Is indeed; a very bounteous offer.


Lad. Take it then.


Mar. You have not named the sender.


Lad. It Is, sir Robert.


Mar. Sir Robert Mallory!


Lad, That Gentleman.
I might renew your memory
His bountyes to your Father: -- and, that bounty
Not dealt by fitts, -- leaving between his doles,
Interims of want, and anguish; but the whole,
And total stock he lives on. -- I might too,
Since you so much forg^tt your self --

Marg. I do not:
Indeed, I do not; gratitude, never kept,
A ^ruer Register of benefits
Then you may find within this bosom

Lad. No? -- come then express it; mak't appear,


Mar. In what?


Lad. Nay, an you mince it so. -- you know my mind! He loves you fair one.


Mar. Are you sure he does?


Lad. Against so large a testimony of it,
As that you have received, and this is, (fair one)
How can you make that question?

Mar. Do his years,
Equal the number, of my years? -- does his
Estate, and mine, lie level? wears sir Robert,
The snow-white liverie, of a single life
Vnsoild, as I do? -- can his heart, and mine,
With heavens applause be made, one heart? -- partake
(As hearts, divinly brought together, do)
One happiness, one sorrow? -- can the hand
Of any man, under yon golden roof
Untie a nuptial gordian? -- loose the knot
Has tied the souls, of him, and his chaste lady
So fast together? -- make but this appear,
And I Will believe thee: -- I Will then say, the Heat
Hi^ bosom carries, is a Holy fire:
A flame, as pure a^ those, are sent to heaven,
From our Religious Altars. -- But till then,
Let him desist, to Roabe so foul a sin
In so divine a garment. -- Love? -- it is lust,
A sulphurous flame; which, tell him, I shall shu^,
As those dark flames beneath us.

Lad. Has he this
For all the cost, that for thy Beauties sake
He has bestowed upon thee?

Mar. Help me goodness,
I thought 't had been for heaven sake? -- That some Angel
Had led his Bounty; -- that it had been done
To make his own soul white, -- and not to make
My white soul black, and ugly.

Lad. Look upon it; -- it is a rich prize.


Mar. It Is; -- yet as much too poor,
Were It ten times trebled, to effect his wish,
As Bribe an Angel to impuritie?
So bear them back again, -- and tell thy Master,
(The lustful Knight that sent thee) when we rate
Our chastity, above our life, we wo'not
Sel't, for such toys as those are.

Lady. How? -- such Toys? -- are gold and jewels counted toys?


Mar. Compared -- with that rich jewel he would have for 'em.


Lad. So.


Mar. Might the exchange pass current.


Lad. Be advised;
I dare be bold to tell -- you, -- in this Act,
You do not only lose this golden offer,
With' fruitfulness, that you enjoy already,
^'th' shine of his rich favors, -- but, you sink
Into that misery, that to the living
Is, as the Grave is to the Dead: A depth,
No beam of Fortune looks on; for his ^rowne,
Deads all your happiness.

Mar. Yet more vexation.
I will not call thee woman; for a woman
Could never labor thus, to infect the Name
With such a sin as this is.

Lad. Beauteous Maid.


Mar. Foul, and detested Hag, can breath upon me
Those golden Epithites, and with' same breath
Endeavor thus to blast it -- Father, Sister,
For heavens sake help me: -- Father, Brother, Sister.

Enter Father, Brother, Sister. Thr. How now Girl? -- why what is the matter?
-- ha?


Mar. Examine her.
But she perchance, may tell you, what she does
Is but her duty; -- 'may be tell you too,
It Is not so much her duty to the great one
That has employed her, as our love to us.
Her pity to our poverty; -- and that
To make our poor and barren fortunes fruitful.
She comes, to water't with a golden shower. Nay, she can do it.

All. A golden shower!


Abra. O rare! -- and thou can do that old woman,
Long may thou reign, I beseech it.

Kneel. Mar. Thus, she may tell you father, -- but, -- I can tell you that she
is --


Thra. What is she?


Mar. A Bawd.


All. A Bawd!


Mar. Nay, though the brow of such a one be brass,
She dares not contradict it: -- she is no less,
And her employment from Sir Robert.

Thra. How? -- Come, come, take heed.


Gill. And what should she take heed of? -- an she be a Bawd,
She is a Bawd.

Abra. That Is certain,
Were her Bawdship employed among Ladies,
But, she shall ride in Triumph*

Thra. Such gravitie, and such a reverend show,
Guild such a sin as this is?

Thra. and Marg. whisper. Abr. A Bawd? -- Now Tobacco, and Aquavitae burn thee.


Gill. Now the stinking sweat upon thee, and thy painted journey-women.


Abr. How many Noses do you think have bin lost
In your Bawdships service?

Gill. How many Coaches have you Bawdified?


Abr. How long ha'you run on in this sin? -- the Coachman wo'you,
And the horses bin whipped, for your pleasure?

Thra. was this Sir Roberts bounty? -- I am poor,
And poorer must be; for his frown commands,
All that I have to nothing, -- But this sore
Shall not be cured with such a sin. -- B^se woman;
But we will reward your labor, -- shall we not?

Gill. You lose a daughter of me else.


Abr. And an Abra'm of me, I can tell you.


Thr. I Will go get ^n Officer; Abram, provide a Cart.


Gill. And let me alone for a Basin.


Exit Thra: Gill. Abr. Lad. Has Love and Bounty this reward?


Mar. Such Love,
And such a Bounty, and the best it merrits.

Lad. These be good Angels, I can tell you. -- Look,


Mar. Thy Angels are all Devils; -- and such gold,
But golden Fetters, -- In whose powerful tie,
Rather then I Will lie Captivated, bound
To the hot embraces of a lustful man,
I Will suffer any wretchedness. -- Away,
Thou art a devil, like a woman. --

Lad. Thou -- an Angell-like a Woman.
Now I have found thy goodness, know me better.

(Discover.) Mar. My ever-worthy Lady.


Lad. Come, no more.
Thou see the purpose of that poor disguise.
Now beauteous Maid, fear nothing: -- thou shall flourish,
And the more Spring, the more his angry storm
Shall beat against thee. -- Here. -- Nay you must take it:
That, seemed to be the hyre of lust, shall now
Be the reward of virtue. -- But, you must
Imploy't as I direct you.

Mar. But direct. -- If I shall fail in any thing enjoynd,
Let your displeasures (my worst Enemy)
Punish the fault, severely.

Lad. This is all:
Against my Husbands coming, -- as I Am sure
He will not long be from thee, -- I would have thee,
With this, -- and more, that I Will supply thee with,
Deck up this homely Cottage; -- and withal
Add to this Beauty beauteous Trimmings, such
As beautify Court beauties.

Mar. How?


Lad. Nay Margaret,
If you shall stop, at my fair purpose now,
I shall suspect your goodness, -- it is my pleasure.

Mar. 'T must then be mine to serve it.


Lad. Preethee do,
I Will have thee brave indeed! How Brave, conceive
From these directions: -- Think thy self at least,
The Heir of old Sir Robert; -- nay, above it;
The Heir of one, owes greater Title; -- and
To such a greatness suite thee. -- Then -- Attend me,
They are returned already: -- the Remains --
Receive in private.

Enter Thrashard, Gill, Abra'm, Constable, Whip and Basin. Thra. I have told
you, what she is master Constable.


Gill. A Baude.


Abra. All over, -- we will not bate you an inch Mr. Constable,
And therefore have a care you do justice.

Con. I have bin among Baudes before now, and whores too:
And I think, I have tickled 'em soundly.

Abra. I think so, a Constable?
What whore dares deny him entrance?

Con. For what belongs to this staff -- Let me alone.


Abra. Let me alone for the Cart.


Gill. And me alone for the Basin.


(Tinke, tinke, tinke.) Con. Come, where is this same Baude here? where is she?


Thra. My worthy lady.


Gill. My most worthy lady!


Abr. Come, where is this baude here? -- my most worthy Land-Lady!


Con. What have I to do wo' Ladies? -- it is the baude
That my authority is to cope withal.

Mar. The outside, made this virtue seem that sin
Lies there that garment.

All. How? that garment,


Mar. Virtuous


All. most virtuous Lady!


Abr. Constable, you may make a hobbyhorse, of your painted staff, and
Ride home again. -- whippe, ly thou there,
And what say you, to your basin?

Gill. I say, it is a base one, and the barbarly knave that owes it,
They say his wife had a tooth drawn above, while he was a
Trimming below* let him keep it for her now, an he will
For we have nothing to do with it.

Lad. Times earnest with me, to be gone: -- farewell:
You know my mind, perform it. --

(exit) Mar. With that care -- I labor, my best happiness.


Thra. Good Lady -- well well sir Robert


Mar. He Is a naughty man.
I am enjoynd a task; and to effect it,
Look, she has given us all this gold.

All. this Gold!


Mar. This is that golden shower I told you off:
But falls to better purpose, then, I then
Imagind, father. -- how to be employed,
Lys yet within this bosom: -- but ere long,
The virtuous secret, here involved I Will show.
From such pure fountains, such pure ryvers flow

(Exeunt:) Enter Barbara, as her Lady; Mr. William bare, Arming her in. Bar.
Heigho! good truth this little practice of my Lady
To stand between her, and her foolish suitors
So to prevent their fopperies, has lulled me
Into so sweet a fancy! -- Mr. William
If all the time I have bin thus accoutred
I have not thought my self a very Lady,
I would I were, a very --

Then thou have 2. strings to thy bow.

Bab. Two strings to my bow. -- what do you mean by that ^roe?


M. W. Why 2. trades Bab, two Trades.


Bab. Why what trade, have I, I pray sir?


M. W. Why, the old trade. -- thy husbands custom will get thee
Custom; and thine, thy husband, so one helps another,
And then, there is some hope of thryving. -- Let me see 1. 2. 3.
After so many falls this is thy third time of rising
A great piece of matter, is it not? -- Come, thou shall cry,
What lack you, show thy ware, Cu^ Privilegio; and
Befreind, thy friend, in a corner Enter Gregory.

When such a simple Gregory as thou Dwindle.

Greg. The diwindle in disgrace.


Plu. Tell me of lining!


M. V. Why Gentlemen, you come to see my Lady;
Which if you kill one another,
You Will hardly do, believe me.

Greg. You have said very right, Mr. William. --

She has shook him off, already.

Greg. I Will try my entertainment

Mr. W. 'Twere a very ill turn, an you should not.

Mr W. No, h^res the man; --
See how she points, at you sir.

(she points at Rash.) Rash She points at me indeed: but oh those smiles!


Mr. W. That smiles a laugh; --
A scorn, a mere derision. Rash whispers with her; her hand after at her
braest
Do you note his coming off sir. -- To her, to her.
None sir, what news?

Plu Nay I say nothing; -- what, -- it was -- it was.


Mr. W. And what say you sir?


Greg. What, she said, -- she said.


Mr. W. To please you sir, I would she had sung it.


Plush. That clapping of her hand, upon her breast, I do not like: --
She has given Me good words; but -- that is a tough bit, --
OF my stomach.

Mr. W. ^'ll help you down with that; -- her words, were these
It is very true; you are, a civil gentleman.
And one, above the fortunes, that you seek:
I must protest you are sir. -- but when the heart is promised, and the
Affections, formerly settled, there is no calling back. -- These were
Her words believe me* --
Did she not shake her head as who should say,
You are the man, must have her?

Plu. It Is enough.


Mr. Wi. You are must'd up in melancholy to sir --


Greg. She gave me comfortable words; -- but that embrace,
And thus, her hand, meeting her heart so often
Moves m^, a little.

Mr. W. Then, you will be moved with nothing.
I Will tell you, what she said; beseech you mark me, Sir -- you are
A good man; a Citizen; -- Rich, -- and wise -- though -- these three
Go seldom together; --
But, -- when they do -- it is an Aldermans pace, --
I assure you -- Sometimes in a Livery gown; but -- that is but --
On Festival days. -- The May den-head, -- is your Aims, --
In your Arms, -- believe me, I wish one, for -- my widowhood is
Otherwise promised. -- These were her words; --
You are the man must have her -- Did she smile upon you?

Greg. that she did.


Mr. W. Why, why, should you be moved then? Look, he is off,
She beckons one of you.

Plu. Me, me, I hope, and I Will to her.


Greg. You shall not go alone sir


Both go to her and whisper. Mr. W. Now, What Is the happiness?


Rash. My happiness -- but, what she said; -- she said.


Mr. W. You have had, a long; and a very gracious hearing.


Rash. I have I ^hanke her; --
A very gracious ^earing, Ha? -- (she laughes.)
Why, does she laugh so loud? it is not at me, I hope

Mr. W. At you? -- at them. -- laugh, at a civil Cittisen?
I could tell, what she says for a need sir

Rash. I should be glad to hear it:


Mr. W. Then, I will make you glad sir. -- beseech you mark me*


Mr. Plush, You are a proper gentleman; --
Smooth, and soft, -- you have not,
Your name, for nothing. -- I have heard, --
You are vallian^; fear no man,
But -- the m^n, that frights, any man, that -- villaynous thing, cald-a
Sergeant, yet you have made some of them,
Run too, two or three at once
Sometimes, and glad, they ^ould overtake you.

Rash. This was a Ieere worth laughing at indeed


Mr. W. Now for Mr. Gregory, -- the country Gentleman.
(Good harmless thing) little or nothing to him, --
Only tells him, his fathers old trunkes
With a codpeice; -- and his breech, were not both, of a piece:
That hardly worth hal^ a piece; -- this almost, worth half a peck

Rash. A half peck, you mean, Mr. William


Mr. W. A bushel of wit believe me. * I ha told you, what she (laughd at:)
You are the man, must have her.

Rash. I hope I shall.


M. W. Did she not point upon you thus. (making horns) -- They fall off, she
beckons Mr. William, whisper.
My Lady beckons me. -- your pleasure, madam.

Plush. I cannot tell; -- If shaking of the head;
And serious shaking of the head, may be
A gracious figne of love; -- I am the man.

Greg. O smile; -- sweet smile -- full of splendidious rays;
Such, -- as the Sun, at dinner time displayes -- If I do not tickle her.
In figure, -- Let -- me be counted a Cipher.
Well, -- an my father would but dye once; --
I am the man must have her.

Rash. But -- o that Hand, -- her hand so white and soft,
In sweet Protests, -- thus -- kissed her breast, so often,
I could compose me thinks! -- the sweetest! -- Well,
I am the man must have her.

Mr. W. Your will shall be instantly done, sweet Lady. --
Gentlemen -- it is my Ladies pleasure, you leave her at this time: --
Nay, nay, keep off I besecch you. -- Mr. Plush, --
You are the man: -- away.

Rash. In good deed sir?


Mr. W. You Would hear as much from my Lady?


Rash. O* ^ight I be so happy.


Mr. W. Why, you shall sir;
I have told the Gentleman, your mind, sweet Lady,
And he is delighted with it: -- But, to hear
Your love delivered, by your own sweet lip
would make his light heart caper.

Bab. Master Rash,
Though it scarce suit with modesty, -- my blush --
Veild with this mourning habit, take your wish,
You are the man shall have me.

Rash. May I build --


M. W. With Brick, according to the Statute sir.

Lest I play upon -- your pate, and cut you, as deep sir.

M* W. I was not there to help thee.


Cut. A pox o'your prating sheeps-head; --
I tell you, I did not desire it.

M. W. Nay, -- preethee Cut be patient.

And he that is a Rogue must be whipped; --
And would I might be whipped an I do so.

Hu. Give me thy hand; thou art a man*

Too well, to Break it: -- you are a Gentleman.

Sir Oli. Sir, should I find, that I had lost my self
In any Thing, that should proclaim me less,
I should not hate mine enemy so much,
As such a heady Action.

Capt. I am ready.


Sir Oli. I see you are: But ere our weapons meet,
Tell me, what seconds have you Captain^?

Capt. Seconds? -- A strange demand. -- How mean you?

Sir Oli. How Captain? -- None.


Capt. I have not sir: have you?


Sir Oli. Beleev't, I have; -- I should not else have met
So great a danger Mullynex.

Capt. A Second!
Is this the Nobleness you Boast? -- A Knight!
A servile Footboy, -- his master ere

Would have disdained this cowardice -- a second*

Sir Oli. Nay you may term it, what you please: -- no matter,
It Is my advantage Captain

Capt. Ha? where is he

For I have more, stout Captain.

Capt. More?


Sir Oli Yes more.
To keep, what lost can never be found again,
We cannot be too Cautelous

Cap. A man?
Ensnare me thus?: where be they? If they be
As base as thou art, be they ten to one
I shall not fear the incoun^er.

Sir Oli. Think you so sir?
A minutes patience I shall name 'em to you.
And let you see your danger.

Capt. Name 'em.


Sir Oli. Yes,
The first bold Second, that attends my Sword,
Is thine own Rash, and inconsiderate fury;
For then that foe within a man, -- without
We cannot meet that enemy, that can
Present us with more danger: There Is the first,
The next my undertaking, in defense
Of such a stock of goodness in that Lad,
As Envy, never durst look on: which who knows not,
So fair, and just, the ever-watchfull eye,
That midnight Actions are apparent to
Cannot but see, nor that great Ens behold,
But be assistant to it; -- A third (Rash man)
The contumelious, and un*manly darings,
That, to enforce me from the Peacefulnesse,
Ere lived in my calm Bosom, you have most
Uncivilly cast upon me, -- Smil'st thou?

Capt. Yes. -- Are these your Seconds?


Sir Oly. Mullinex they are.
Dare thou unarmed? -- Indeed a naked man*
(For he that fights in such a Cause as thine,
With nothing in it, but an impetuous will,
Is little better --) venture all thy blood
Against such a great Advantage?

Capt. What I dare,
My Sword shall tell thee Bellingham.

(Thrust.) Sir Oli. So sudden? (Passes, Bellingham* only puts by.)
You see, till now my weapon has been used
Merely defensively; -- To guard my self;
Nor point, nor edge, offering their violence
Against thy bosom. -- Were I sure, I could
Put by thy fury, till it has spent it self,
Or tired thy body past the danger of it,
The Fighting part should only be thine own:
Mine only, mine own Buckler.

Capt. Slighted? -- death
I Will put your Fence-play to it a little better.

Sir Oli. I must not dally then*


(Fight.) Capt. Come Bellingham.


Sir Oli. Hold Captain, hold, -- you bleed.


Capt. As you must do,
Or all my blood's at hazard -- Have I touched you?

Sir Oliv. You have stout Captain,
Shall we part upon the equality of our hurts?

Capt. How, part sir?


Sir Oli. Yes, our manhoods, standing in this equal point,
We may do it fairly; slight applyments yet
May make us whole again.

Capt. Shall a scratch part us?


Sir Oli. How fatal sir another close may be -- we know not,


Capt. No, nor do we fear it: Come
Then Mullynex, what following hurts you have,
Call not the work of my unwilling hands,
But thine own frenzy: -- witness heaven they are -- (Fight.)
Captain you faint.

Capt. Take your advantage then.


Sir Oli. Advantage sir, How mean you?


Capt. Of my wound:
My weakness Bellingham, -- you see there is now,
No interposed resistance, 'tween my heart (Throws off his weapon)
And thy bold weapon -- Come.

Sir Oli. I rather wish
That all thy blood were in thy veins again:
Had all the fire, and livelihood it had,
Though with that strength, new courage, and the malice
That but two minutes past, pursued my life,
You should again pursu't, and put it to
Another dangerous hazard.

Capt. Thou mai'st wish it;
For 't were no hazard, against the muniment,
And strong defenses that Heaven plants about,
A soul so pure as thine is.

Sir Oli. How? is this
The language of a wounded man, to him
That made them Mullynex?

Caps. What language fitter?
Thou art a noble enemy: -- And now
My troubled understanding's calm again,
I see my self worthy the wounds I have,
And all their Anguish trebled. -- Thou art just.

Sir Oli. I am to unmindfull, of what most I mind
Thy smarting faintness: -- But, my cares shall now
Only attend thy safety.

Capt. Mind thine own: -- fly Bellingham.


Sir Oli. Let all my best desires
Be fruitless then. -- Come Mullynex, Let me
Support thy fainting body.

Capt. Worthy sir, -- you have a Noble second*


Sir Oli Sir I have, And whosoever dares be a Duellist
Should have the like;
Should build his Hopes, rather upon his cause,
Then on his strength, -- his skill, -- and hood winck'd fury,
For these are nothing.

Capt. You have made me see*
That Braves and Boastings in bad Causes, are
The Dolphins wanton dallying on the waves:
That sore-runs Tempests; This untimely Graves. --

(Exeunt.) Enter old Thrashard brave, and the Lady Mallory. Lad. Mal. You know
my mind, fail not in any thing
That lies in my direction.

Thra. Fear not me; -- you have made me brave,
And I Will do my business as bravely.

Thra. Nay, for my Son, since he put on his Braverie,
For the part of a gallant in jest, -- He will not be persuaded,
But that he is a gallant in earnest; Scorns to think of Canvas,

Or to talk but of Lords, and Ladies. -- And as for my Daughters!

To the middle in snow; -- Nor for one so red as she, to wade to
The chin in blood: -- for her white is whiter then snow, * and
Her red then the blush of Roses.

M. Wi. It is my Ladies pleasure, that you turn up that corner, --
And so go through Allgate to the Tower; -- where -- she,
Having dispatched a little business with a Gentlewoman

Beauty was never so tickled! Let me embrace thee. -- So!
And kiss thee, -- so! -- Nectar, Nectar* Nectar.

I am sure on it.

Greg. Honest Hugh, -- well, Enter Greg Dwindle, from his stand.
I shall think upon thee.

Hu. Think? -- Can you think me, a new suit? --
Think me a new Sword? -- Think me a new Belt? --
Think me a new Beaver*? -- or think me a Pouch full of pieces*
I think, -- you think, -- no such matter.

Greg. I think thou think right honest Hughkin.


Hu. Why then, -- I think what I think,*and
There Is an end of our thinking.

Greg. Well, an my Father would but dye once.

'Slight, there is an oath indeed.

(...) over to me sir: An^ lie with her, and do not something;
Wh^ the let her say, I have -- Nothing.

Greg. B^ gone sweet Lady? Why I thought you had come*
To go to Church with me to be married.

Bab. You know my heart, and have it: only sir,
I have a little business, -- here hard by;
An hour, or such a thing;* which overpast, -- I shall Return.

Greg. But will you?


Bab. By this kiss.


Greg. A most sweet oath, I take it.

Bar. Being so near the place I am to go to,
Till I return, pray keep him company. --

Gr. Well, an my Father would but dye once.*

But, we must follow, what follows. --

impatient Lover, that beautiful eye ever
Looked on, why half her hour is not out yet.

Greg. Well, -- it is the longest hour.


Hu. But, as you were about to say,
Concerning the choice of a wife sir.

Gr. Why, thus I do say, honest Hughkin,-I would have my wife, --
Like Alexanders -- Horse.

Hu. How Is that? -- Your wife like a Horse sir?


Greg. Like Alexanders horse, I would sir.


Hu. And why, -- like Alexanders Horse Master Gregory?
Why, as that Horse, -- would let no man ride him, but Alexander?
So, I would have my wife, let no man ride her, but- Gregory.

Hu Good truth, you say right; -- In right there is no wrong;*
No wrong, there is no hurt; -- no hurt, there is no danger, --
No fear, -- and* no fear, -- why so much for that sir.

Cut. Birlady, as you say, she stays somewhat long indeed sir. --
Pray heaven, your Rival- Master Gregory Dwindle have not
Met with her.

Plu. Dwindle?


Cut. He, -- I do half suspect it -- He has been later with her*
Then you imagine, he has sir.

Plu. The next time I meet him, -- I will kill him.


Cut. I would not have you die sir: -- But --


Plu. That Butt, will I Run full Butt at, and broach him.


Hu. I do but tell you, what I think, Master Gregory.

Hu. I talk sir of Plush, your Rival; -- you must fight.


Greg. Well, an I must, I must; -- I Will examine my Sword,
And see, how he will stand to the Business.

With his Sword stark naked already*

Plu. My Sword can go naked too sir.


(They draw) Hu. Your Ryvall sir, -- turn, and defend your self;
You Are a dead man else.

Plu. Dwindle, thou have wronged me.

Greg. I would it were gone, honest Hughkin.


Cut. So much, I know my Ladies Bosom sir.
That what I speak, I Will Justify. -- She Is yours.

Hu. I think, I have said enough sir.


Greg. I shall have her.


Hu. Shall I talk? -- shall I walk? shall I eat? shall I drink?
Shall I sleep? -- shall I live? -- shall I dye sir?

Cut. But, you must tread the path, I put you in;
An you straye, but a foot, you loose her.

Hu. But, -- as I have told you, Mr. Gregory Dwindle,
You must not miss a half of my directions.

Plu. Honest Cut^, -- I am for this thing, -- any thing, -- all things,
To compass the Bed of the Lady.

Greg. An I do not do as I should do* -- may I never come to do, --
What I wooed do.

Cut. You have said enough: -- And go I Will direct you better.


Ex. at one end Hu. Do this, she is yours: -- As we go I Will direct you better.


Exit at the other end. ACT. 5.
Enter Captain in his Night-gowne, Doctor, Servants, Chair and stools. Doct.
Have tender hands upon him. -- so, now Leave us.


Capt. Your goodness mixing with those things you apply,
Doubles their virtue, and to all you do
Sets a most wished Conclusion.

(Knock within) Doct. See who knockes. --


(Exit Serve.) Capt. I make no question, I shall find you such*
Concerning the concealment of my friend,
That worthy Gentleman, Sir Olyver,
As I desire, to find you.

Enter Servant. Doct. All I am, -- is at your service, Captain. -- Now sir.


Serve. Sir, here is the mourning Lady so much talked of*
Sir Robert Mallory, and his Lady sir,
That good, good Lady.

Capt. Trust me, y'^re to blame.
They were not entered with you? -- Preethee step
And do it with thy best duty: -- Nay, I knew
The Rumor of our unsuspected Quarrel
So spread, as I have caused it to be spread,
They would not long be from me, Enter Sir Robert Mallory, hi^ Lady, and the
Lady Mosely.
They are come, -- you know my thoughts.

Doct. Fear not my care; I do sir,
Ladies, -- and kind Sir Robert, -- you are welcome.

Sir Rob. Is It well, to see men Ill sir; -- How Is It Captain?


Capt. Faith a weak man Sir Robert.


Sir Rob. Nay, nay sister;
Then I shall chide you, weeping? Come come dry
Thou have wept too much, already.

La. Mal. Had I thought
To come, had bin to meet this new occasion
Of grief, and anguish, I must tell you plainly
You had come alone, for me.

Sir Rob. Come, wipe your eyes.


La. Mos. You may as well forbid the Bigswoln Cloud
By the Suns Ardor melted into Dropps,
To fall upon the Bosom of the earth;
As my swollen grief (Resolved into these tears)
To fall from their full Fountains. -- Half the Number,
Is for thy wounds (rash Captain) the other Half,
For that sad gentleman, (where ere he be)
Whose hard hap 'twas to make 'em: And, in them,
To make me Author of this Bloody work
And his perpetual Exile

Capt 'twas my frenzy,
I, wretched I, was Author.

Sir Rob. Interchange
Embraces, congyes; -- and, to our Belief,
The Language of two Brothers; -- And all this
But merely show? -- false colors, -- a fair Masque
Ore the stern; -- Rough, and Formidable Face
Of such a Mortal Envy? -- you were cunning

La. Mos. But, to our purpose sir: -- our coming was,
Hearing that worthy Gentleman, Sir Olyver*
Upon this Bloody Accident, was fled.
(For nothing else, is on the 'voyce of Rumor)
To learn, the certainety of you.

Capt. He, fled.
To stop his flight, (though for his safeties sake
He hid himself in some obscure disguise)
I gave him, what encouragement, I could;
Told him, my wounds were nothing: made their depth
Appear, but shallow scratches; -- That the loss.
Of twice the Blood went from 'em, could not leave
My heart so Pale, as to Recoile against
The worst they threatened: -- Have proclaimed the hand
Of Noble Bellingham from all this Blood,
As white as Innocence.

All. How?


Capt. I have,
And taken the purple stain upon my self;
For 'twas my self wounded my self; -- not He.

All. Your self?


Capt. You call me, to a strict account.
For he that is lost in such a storm of fury,
Cannot be said, to be himself.

La. Mal. You have spoke
A noble way to acquit him.

Sir Rob. But, it may be
Imagining, we know the Place to which
He has betane him to conceal himself,
You speak all this, in hope we will name the place,
And so Discover him, to what revenge
Your spleen shall seek upon him.

Capt. To revenge?
To any, but your self this harsh Suspicion
Should have as harsh an answer: But to you
I Will thus acquit me: do you see this Ring?
Your Tears, will hardly let you see it: -- yet Lady
Pray look upon it. -- Can* you call to mind
A former sight on it?

La Mos. I have seen it sure. -- Sir Olyver, I take it.


Capt. Lady 'twas.


Sir. Rob. Now I look better on it, it was indeed.
Thou know it too.

La. Mal. I do sir: -- what of this?


La. Mos. What comfort yields the sight on it?


Capt. I have shown
This, to acquit me of those treacherous thought^
That you suspected in me, against the life
Of noble Bellingham; -- Who -- as he parted,
(To take a Journey in uncertain paths,)
Left this Ring with me.

Sir Rob. You have charmed us now, -- from all our harsh suspicions.


Capt. Till he gave me
This cause to hate him, I never loved him: Now,
I do not grieve so much, this loss of Blood,
Nor all the smart goes with it, as by this
I have lost the sight and the society
Of such a fair example of all Goodness,
As I shall never more look on. -- I could tell you
How much (beyond the sufferings of a Man)
I dared him to the field: -- How meeting there,
He did not look upon me as a Foe;
Or, one that thirsted a Revenge, -- but one
That only met to show he durst, -- and then,
Seemed -- in the language of his look -- at once
To speak the Dreyrie issue of a fight,
And -- to advise to shun it. -- Till he saw
My weapon out, -- His slept within his Scabberd.
Both equally prepared, -- my weapon only
Labored for blood; -- His, only his own guard
Without desire to touch me. In a word,
What you see done, -- I made him do; -- and done,
His heart wept blood to think on it. -- When another
(Seeing his state thus dangerous) would have fled;
I could not counsel him to it, -- but in this,
As all his Actions, valuing noble things
Above his life -- he took into's embraces
My wounded body; -- Brought me from the field;
And to the diligence, and well known skill
Of thi^ good man has left me: Leaving with him,
(I almost blush, to do him right in that)
His ample satisfaction for my Cure,
Or whatsoever may be demanded.

Sir Rob. Sir ya've given him a fair Character,


Capt. He were
Baser then Envy would not. -- and all this
He did in the Honor of your Beauty Lady.

Sir Rob. Lady.


La. Mal. dear sister. --


Doct. Lady.


Capt. He loved you dearly: Can his Praises* then offend your ear?


La. Mos. No every syllable
Of his commends is music. -- But to think,
That, for my sake this much Commended worth,
(Yet much above, the great commends it has)
Should- thus be lost O, I could weep my self,
Into my senseless Statue! -- Bellingham!
O Noble, noble Bellingham!

All. Sister.


Capt. Lady:
If his Commends be music in your ear,
Be patient, and hear more on it. -- once again.
To this: -- 'Twas his; -- and (as I said before)
He left it as he parted: But, not mine,
But thine, -- thou best of women: -- his desire,
You Would wear it for him: -- when, you look upon it,
You Would think upon him; thinking, that you would give
His wandering stepps fair wishes.

La. Mos. As I would
My soul, departing, on her Iourny hence
To her eternal dwelling.

Capt. Pray observe,
How in this ring, h'as emblem'd all the world,
And all her painted gloryes. -- look you Madam*
A bed of Roses-wither'd. -- And the word,
Caelestia non sic! -- it is not thus in heaven!
There Is no decay; no failing, All things there
Their Innate Beautyes do for ever wear:
For ever, their full flourish: -- Here below,
Our best Joys wither; All things Ebb and Flow. -- Indeed --
He was not master of that thing, from which
He did not draw, (as out of this small compass,
Sweet and Celestial uses! -- was a man,
As heaven had only made a man to make
By his example, multitudes of men,
Such as it self would have 'em. -- you weep still.

La. Mos. No hope, again, to see him?


Capt. Do you wish it?


La. Mos. As life, as health, as Heaven!


Capt. You will not then deny one kindness to me?


Sir Rob. what is it Captain?
Now you have left your love-suite sir; -- and seem
To be a spoakes-man, for young Bellingham
She can deny you nothing: -- what is it Captain?

Capt. Faith only this Sir Robert. -- I would Beg
Since She desires to see him, that, for that
She Would Let me wear this Diamond but till I find
Fit time to send it to him.

All. Send it?


Capt. Yes -- No strict enquiries of me: I have spoak
If you dare trust me --

La. Mos. But direct me sir -- I Will Bear't my self.


Capt. You know my Bosom Lady;
If you will send it.

La. Mos. Take it.


Sir Rob. Take it Captain, -- but --


Capt. I conceive all that you can urge me to,
And will perform to your own wish. -- My wounds
Call for your help sir. -- I must now desire
You would be pleased to leave me.

Sir Rob. We Would be loath
To be a hindrance to the happiness
That we all wish for.

All. Farewell noble Captain.


Exit manant Doctor and Captain. Doct. Come, shall I look upon your wounds?


Capt. No, no:
I feigned my self much fainter then I am,
To hasten them to leave me.
Thanks to your Art; -- and you great Master of it.
I feel my legs sturdy supporters now, Ent. Bellingham from the Arras.
And for a need could travel. -- Bellingham.
You have observed these passages?

Sir Oly. I have;
Unseene I have seen, and overheard 'em.

Capt. Then -- I hope you have seen, that I have played the part
Of a just Advocate.

Sir Oly. Sir, you have done
For me, -- the most unworthy -- such a Love
As I shall never make even with.

Capt. No more;
The Exchange is made, Sir Olyver: -- there, -- take it, (the Ring)
She dreams not sir, you have it so suddenly:
But, what is to follow -- I must change my seat,
For this has tired me sir. -- We Will take more hours
Sufficiently to think on.

Sir Oly. Noble Captain. --


(Exeunt.) Enter Master William, Cut, and Hugh. Mr. Will. Will these foolish
Suitors be troublesome still?
And still live in hope of my Lady?

Hu. Hang 'em Puttocks; you shall hear more of them hereafter.


Cut. But how is it with Rash, and his piece of Rash, Mistress Barbary?


M. W. Faith, he is not so rash as he was, with some supple persuasions
Of mine; -- her hanging the head, -- beating the breast, wringing
The hands, -- wiping the neyes, -- and lamentably breathing some
Hundred and fifty Heigh'os; he was won in the end to busse her, to
Embrace her, -- to busse her again. -- He buss'd, -- and she buss'd, -- and
they
Both buss'd so long, -- till at last, -- overcome in this conflict of kisses;
He yielded himself her Captive, and has vowed
Till his death to love her as dear as his life.

Cut. How now? what Musick's this?


Music, and a Song from the music room. M. Wi. It Is applied to my Ladies
melancholy,
But I fear me to little purpose, -- peace, a Song.

The Song ended, Enter Sir Robert. Sir Rob. Now, Master William,
How fares my Sister, and your Lady? -- ha?

M. Wy. She Is a sad Lady; -- and so sad, Sir Robert,
That no delights, that her most loving friends
Present unto her Senses, from her breast
Can take one minutes anguish.

Enter Lady Mallory. Sir Rob. Well, I fear me,
She Will pine her self into her winding sheet.
Now Peg, how is it? -- how does our sister? ha?
Can smile, and tell me, there is as clear a sky
Upon her beauty? No, that down-cast look
I fear me's her sad picture.

La. Mal. It Is indeed:
But the occasion of her grieving's changed.

Sir Rob. What Is the sad matter now then?


La. Mal. Only now, -- young Bellingham's sad absence.


Sir Rob. Bellingham?


La. Mal* For which, with many sighs, with many tears,
Many abrupted sillables, extolling
His noble worth and goodness; -- she accuses
Her wretched self; -- making her self the cause
Of that sad fight, and this lamented Issue.
It grieves me thus to see her; -- and as much
To leave her in it, -- I must in again:
Come, will you in, Sir Robert?

Exit. Sir Rob. Go, I Will follow.
Heaven never pity me, but for the weight Capt. Enter Mullynex and Sir Oliver
as the Doctor.
Of sorrow, lies upon her tender heart,
My heart's as full of anguish.
My brave Captain,
Do you so much compassionate the tears
Of my poor sister, as thus weak and ill,
To come to see, and comfort her?

Capt. Sir Robert,
I thank my great Restorer, I am well:
But, were I at the weak'st, hearing her grief,
I should forget mine own, and tender that
My best respects, and service.

Sir Rob. You are Noble.


Capt. Still grieving her lost Husband?


Sir Rob. Questionless,
There Is some remains of that: -- but with it sir,
She Has now th'addition of your blood: with that
The flight of him, that yours commends, -- and his
Better considered worthiness, has made
So noble to her, Noble Bellingham,
For whom, as one by her occasion lost,
Her conscience seems to check her: -- and retired
Into her melancholy chamber, sits
As in a Cell: -- whence all the loving means
That can be used, have not the power to move her.

Capt. In her Chamber?
And this strong Passion for young Bellingham?
Pray call a servant.

Sir Rob. Some within there. Enter a Servant.
Bear this to your sad Lady sir, and tell her
The man she grieves for, will not long be from her;
And that the bringer of it does desire
She would be pleased, that he might see her here.

Sir Rob. Here, tell her here: -- go, fetch her.


Exit servant. Capt. Nay, if that
Be her disease, this is the cure or nothing.

Sir Rob. Why, is young Bellingham returned?


Capt. You see
The Ring she sent him is returned: from that,
Let me alone to cure her.

Enter Margaret brave. Sir Rob. Now my Peg,
What comfort brings thy coming?

Marg. That my tongue
Were furnished with those words that might delight you:
I know, there is in this wish, and the sad signs
It is delivered with, answer enough
Touching your worthy Sisters heaviness,
To make your hearts as heavy. -- But my charge,
Is from my Lady, to entreat you would
Be pleased to come and see her.

Sir Rob. See her wench?
Prithee go in again, and tell thy Lady,
We hope she will leave her solitary Cell, -- and come to us.

Marg. To you sir?


Sir Rob. Nay, nay, go, -- and tell her what I bid thee.


Exit Margaret. Capt. Pray sir Robert,
What Beautie's this?

Sir Rob. A pretty beauty sir.


Capt. But that her wearings are so fair and costly,
I should -- from Fames rich pencilling a Virgin,
That was your foster daughter, take that piece,
And this to be one beauty.

Sir Rob. So to take,
Is not to take amiss sir; this is she:
This is that Girl, believe me.

Capt. Still a Virgin!


Sir Rob. As from her Mother, Captain.


Capt. And her heart -- her own sir, and unpromis'd.


Sir Rob. Yet believe me,
Do like her, noble Captain?

Capt. To enjoy her,
As the sole mistress of my purest desires,
Is the greatest happiness that I can aim at.

Sir Rob. You know her Birth.


Capt. It Is noble in her virtues.


Sir Rob. If virtue be the best Nobility,
It Is so indeed. -- Go, thou shall have her Captain.
And howsoere, set lightly by, till now,
She Has now some weight; -- five hundred Pieces Captain,
Five hundred golden Pieces.

Enter the Servant. Serve. Your Lady Sister's coming sir.


Capt. Please you,
I Will in, and try my fortunes with her sir.
What follows of the Ring I sent, -- this Doctor
Can as well finish, as my self were here,
I Will not be long about it.

Sir Rob. Say you so sir?
Here, take this Ring, 'twill help you. -- Never not fear her:
Go in and woo her; win her, and then wear her, Exit Capt.
I see that Ring has brought her: Ent. Lady Mosely, La. Mallory, and Mr.
William.
How is it Sister?

La* Mos. Revived a little by the sight of this,
But let me see the man I sent it to,
And then that cure upon my grief, -- you wished*
Is to your wish effected.

Sir Rob. Master Doctor.


La. Mos. Where is he? -- speak, who brought it?


Sir Oli. I did Lady.


La. Mos. You? -- What are you sir?


Sir Oli. My Profession Lady,
My habit shows you: I am he that cured
The Captain that he wounded.

Ladies. Mullynex?


Sir Oli. That Captain Ladies.


La. Mos. Is he well?


Sir Oli. He is.


Sir Rob. As meat can make him; and his flesh as whole as a fish,
Take my word for that Lady sister.

La. Mos. Ha? -- where? where is he?


Sir Rob. Faith, somewhere here about the house he is,
And see, he appears in his likeness. Enter Captain with Margaret.
You Are as good as your word; -- you have got her.

Capt. Not with child yet, but I hope I shall doe-ere long:
Now heaven give us joy, and all is done sir.

Sir Rob. Heaven give you joy; -- I Will give you the gold I promised you.
You see the Captain is well Sister.

La. Mos. Why then returns not Bellingham? -- or does he,
(Hearing his goodness has inthrald my heart)
Neglect me now, 'cause I neglected him,
When my fresh griefs inforst me? -- If he do,
I must confess it but a just revenge:
And so (as long as grief shall give me leave)
Shall patiently endure it.

Capt. But you shall not,
You have endured beyond a woman's strength,
And shall endure no longer. -- Master Doctor,
You are the man must cure her.

Sir Oli. Beauteous Lady,
'Twas your command, I should not trouble you
With any tedious Love-suit; -- and you see
I have done, what you have enjoined me: -- Now I hope
I have your voluntary grant.

La. Mos. I am now,
What Noble Bellingham shall please to make me.

Sir Rob. No doubt he will make much o'thee Sister, -- will thou not Knight?
My brave sir, of a thousand per Annum?

Sir Oli. She Is now mine own; and in this union sir,
The best delights that her desires would have,
Are mine, mine own; -- and I shall so pursue 'em.

Sir Rob. And what say you master Captain?


Capt. To my Pegge*
I say (as he has said) -- that she is my self,
As you have said; -- that she is my Girl; -- my Pearl;
Her voice, I will hang in my ear: -- Her face in mine eye;
Her pretty little waste in mine arms;
And being in arms, let the Soldier alone to come on sir.

Sir Rob. Why god^ mercy Captain. -- Now to Church, Enter master William.
Nay, we will not lose a minute.

Mr. Wi. Beseech you stay a little, there is that mirth in your way Enter Rash
and Bab like a Puritan.
I dare promise will be worth your beholding:
See, see it appears.

La. Mal. Who Is this? -- Master Rash?


Rash. The very same, an't please you.


Sir Oli. Your suit continued still sir?


Rash. I have turned up another suit now sir.


Sir Rob. Your Wife!


Rash. Even so sir.


Bab. Verily so sir. -- Do not you know me Lady?


La. Mos. Truth not I.


Bab. Nor you, nor you, nor you?


La. Mal. We know thee not.


Marg. What art thou?


Bab. This it is, to put off our vain and superfluous colors, and to walk
As becomes the zealously metamorphos'd. I was your
Creature Lady.

La. Mos. How? my creature?


Bab. In the phrase of the world 'twas so. -- But I am now, -- mine own,
Yet, -- verily -- I do err, -- for -- no wife, -- is her own disposer.
Verily none: -- for we -- to affirm sincerely, are but members
Of our Head, the man; -- our Spouse, -- and our Superior.

All. How Bab!


Mr. Will. That Barbary Button, believe me.


Capt. How comes she to speak in the nose so?


Mr. Will. The tone of the Brethren, and the Sisters;
But, what do you think of this Member?

Bab. Though begot, -- and conceived in vanity: -- being borne in the
State of Matrimony, the offense, -- may no doubt be remitted, and the
Innocent, in time, may prove a most, -- zealous member.

Sir Oli. And what think you sir?


Rash. I think, as my wife thinks, -- for man and wife are one.


Bab. Verily, you have said, and said- like a zealous husband.


Enter Cutbert. Cut. Give way there Gentlemen.


All. Why, what is the matter?


Cut. Your shadow Lady; -- and your Rival sir:
The prettiest fancy; the most dainty Dream!
Beseech you Madam, stand aside a little, Enter Plush and Gillian as the Lady.
Much joy betide your worship.

Plush. Godamercy;
Having this Beauty, I have all the joys
My Auspicious Stars could give me. Honest Cut;
This service shall not be unthought of Cut.

Cut. Well Master Gregory, -- an you do hang your self.


Plu. Why, an he does, he does, -- we cannot help it.


Cut. Yet it would grieve a man. --


Plu. Grieve a pudding: -- And it grieve not him to do it, it shall never
Grieve me to hear on it. -- We are now man and wife.

Cut. For better, for worse sir.


Plu. Then, for better, for worse, I will keep her. --
Why, there is another Rival o'mine, -- Sir Oliver, --
Say he should take the same journey, and go to
Heaven in a Halter after him; can I help it?

Sir Oli. I confess, you cannot: -- thank you master Plush.


Plu. I did but say, -- an -- an you should sir.


Sir Oli. No, though the loss be somewhat grievous to me*
The sorrow shall not go so deep: -- she is yours.

Plu. As sure as the Church can make her.


Sir Oli. What must be, must be sir; -- much joy betide you.


Enter Gregory, the old Gentlewoman, as the Lady and Hugh. Plush. Thank you.


Greg. Now Lady,
In spite of all my Rivalls, you are mine.

Old Gent. I am sir.


Greg. I know thou art, and thereupon --.


Hu. Not a kiss, till you come to your Chamber, -- then
She Is your own all over.

Greg. It Is enough: Now, an my father would but dye once.


Hu. When Plush shall hear of this, -- he will hang himself.


Greg. An he do -- to make a wry mouth at the match,
I cannot help it; I should not do so by him though. --
Save you gentlemen. We have the Lady Gentlemen.

Plu. We have the Lady-gentlemen.


Sir Rob. Is my Sister divided between you?


Sir Oli. You cannot both have the Lady.


Plu. Alas poor Gregory!


Greg. Alas poor Plush!


La. Mos. Alas poor coxcombs! here is a coil indeed
About a worthless shadow: -- What am I sir?

Sir To. Capt. Alas poor Plush!


La. Mal. Wi. Alas poor Gregory!


Plu. Why, who have I then?


Gill. Why, who do you think you have sir? --
This is no Ivy bush, nor I an Owl. --
Do You stare upon me? say?

Plu. Are yo' my wife?


Gill. I cannot tell, -- how do you think sir? ha?


Sir Oli. Having got this Beauty from you, we got this Beauty for you.


Cut. You Will think upon me I hope sir.


Capt. The Gentlewoman is my Sister; -- I tell you no more but so sir:
She loves no large protests: -- Embrace and kiss,
And it is sufficient. -- There Is an end of this.

Sir Rob. And what say you sir?


Greg. Why, I say -- I -- know not, -- what to say,
She -- is not -- very old sir -- is she?

Capt. In her Hood, -- some -- 50 -- But in some Dressings she has,

Mr. Wi. Come, you are so melancholy:
Why here is a man suffers, as much as you;
Or you master Plush, -- and yet you see he is patient.

Rash. I thought I had married a Lady too, -- but -- by lady,
There Is no such matter. -- We must be contented now though.

Greg. Well -- here be three of us.


Sir Rob. There be indeed;
Stand together, I beseech you, and be silent.
Come, let us to Church: -- nay, we will not lose a minute*

So, now I Will call thee Captain; having got
The inestimable Jewel, treasured up
In this rich Cabinet: -- for such a Jemme,
