By the King.
A Proclamation for the preventing of the Exportation of Woolles, Wool-fels,
Yarne, Fullers earth, and Woad-ashes and of Hydes, both tand and raw, out of
this Kingdom.
WHereas Our late Royal Father of happy Memory deceased, Having understood by
the general complaints of his loving subjects from the several parts of His
Realm of England, that of late years theretofore, the Woolles of this
Kingdom were exceedingly fallen from their wonted values, and that the Cloth
and Stuff of the same had not that vent in foreign parts, which formerly
they had, and taking into his Princely consideration the weighty consequence
thereof, as of a matter of very great importance, for the wealth and welfare of
this Kingdom, also being careful to provide a speedy and effectual remedy
against such a growing evil, did by advice of his Privy Council, and after
information and report made by diverse persons of quality, and known ability
trusted in that behalf, find amongst other things of moment, That the
exportation of Woolles, Wool-fels, woollen Yarne, Fullers earth, and
Woad-ashes, were a great means to enable the foreign making of cloth, and a
principal impediment to the vent of our clothes made in England: And that the
false and deceitful making, dying, and dressing of our cloth and stuffes here
made of Woolles, did exceedingly disgrace, and discredit the Draperie of this
our Kingdom, and did very much hinder the vent of those Commodities. Thereupon
Our said late Father, did by his royal Proclamation, bearing date the
twentieth day of July, in the twentieth year of his reign over England,
France, and Ireland, straightly charge and command, that no manner of Woolles,
Wool-fels, Woollen Yarne, Cornish hair, Fullers earth, or Woad-ashes, should
be at any time or times, thereafter exported out of this Realm of England,
Dominion of Wales, Town, or Port of Berwicke, or any the Isles, Ports,
Creekes, or places thereof, into any foreign parts, or into the Kingdom of
Scotland: nor that any of the said Commodities should be transported out of our
Kingdom of Ireland, into any other parts, then into the Realm of England
only upon such pains as in the said Proclamation are contained. Forasmuch as
the said Proclamation was by Our Fathers decease determined: And yet We find
that the reasons and necessity do still remain.

We therefore, out of the great desire We have to advance the wealth of Our
people, and by all means possible to cherish and comfort their labors, have
thought fit by the advice of Our privy Council to renew the said
Proclamation, with further prohibition of the exportation of Hydes both tand,
and raw, by reason of the exportation whereof, as We are informed, diverse the
like abuses and inconveniences have, and do daily happen.

Wherefore Our will and pleasure is, and We do by these presents straightly
charge and command, that no manner of Woolles, Wool-fels, Woollen yarne,
Cornish hair, Fullers earth, Woad-ashes, or Hydes either raw, or tand, be at
any time, or times hereafter exported out of this Our Realm of England,
Dominion of Wales, Town, or Port of Berwicke, or any the Isles, Ports,
Creekes, or places thereof, into any foreign parts, or into Our Kingdom of
Scotland, nor that any manner of Woolles, Wool-fels, Woollen yarne, Cornish
hair, Fullers earth, Woad-ashes, or Hydes, either raw or tand, be transported
out of Our Kingdom of Ireland into any other parts, then into the Realm of
England only: upon pain of confiscation of all such Woolles and other the
Premises so transported, or endeavored to be transported, as also of Our
highest indignation, and the seuerest censure of Our Court of Star Chamber,
and of such other pains and penalties as by the Laws, and Statutes of this
Our Kingdom, and by Our Prerogative Royal may be inflicted.

And to the end that all Officers and Ministers in, or about Our Ports of
England may the more strictly look to the observance of this Our will and
pleasure, for the Weal of this Our Kingdom: We do further straightly charge
and command, that if any Officer, or Minister, of, or belonging to Our
Customs, or Ports, or attending at any the Havens, Creeks, or places adjacent,
or carrying to the sea, shall consent or conniue at the unlawful exportation
of the Premises, or any of them; or if any of them, shall make any certificate
upon any Cocket, of the landing of any Wools in any ports of this Our R^alme,
unless the Officer himself, who shall make such certificate, do first see the
same Wools landed, according to the contents of the said certificate: Or if the
said Officers, or any of them shall make any Cocket, which shall not contain
the number of Sackes, and the weight of the Wool in every Sack, contained in
such Cocket, that then every such Officer, and Minister who shall offend in any
the premises, shall not only forfeit his Office, place, and employment, but
shall also incur all other the pains and penalties aforesaid. And if any
Minister or Officer of, or in any Ship, or other Uessell, shall permit, and
suffer any Woolles, Wool-fels, or any other of the premises to be transported
in any Ship, Bottom, or other Uessell, wherein or whereof he shall be a
Master, or other officer: That then every person so offending shall be subject
to such pain and penalty as aforesaid.

And in case there be now in force any former Licenses or Authorities
heretofore given and granted by Us, or any of Our Predecessors for
transportation of Wools, or any other the Premises, We do hereby revoke and
disanull the same. And are resolved that none such hereafter shall be granted.

And for the better utterance of Cloth within this Our Kingdom; We do
straightly charge and command, that when, and as often as upon the occasion of
any Burials, or Funerals, any Blackes be hereafter given or worn; That then
such Blacks and mourning stuffes shall be only of Cloth and Stuffes, made of
the Wool of this Kingdom, and not elsewhere, nor otherwise.

And for that We are informed, that the false Dying of Cloth and Stuffes made
of Wools, is a great hinderance to the vent of those commodities. Therefore We
straightly will and command, That no person whatsoever, in, or toward the Dying
of any Cloth of what sort soever, or of any Stuffes made of Wool, shall use any
Logwood or Blockwood the use whereof about the said Clothes or Stuffes, has so
often by several Laws and Proclamations been already condemned.

And for the better discovery of false and deceivable Dying, and the
suppressing of the said Logwood and Blockwood, in and about the Dying of
Stuffes made of Wool; We do straightly charge and command the Wardens of the
Dyers of London, within the compass of their Search, and all other Officers in
other places; That from time to time they make careful and diligent Search for
the discovery of all false and deceitful Dying, and if in their Searches they
shall find any Cloth or Stuff Dyed with Logwood or Blockwood, either in all,
or in part, That they seize the same, and inform Our Attorney General for
the time being thereof, that such proceeding may be speedily had against the
Offenders, as so great a contempt deserves.

Further We do hereby straightly charge and command all Justices of Peace,
Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Officers, and other persons whatsoever, to do
their best endeauours to discover all and every the Offenders against this Our
Proclamation.

And for the better encouragement of all such as shall take care and pains to
make such discoueries, Our will and pleasure is, that every such person that
shall be the first discouerer of such Offender, shall be rewarded with the
moity, or one half of such sums of money as shall come unto Us by virtue of
any forfeiture incurred upon this Our Proclamation: Giving also like Charge and
Command that all persons of what degree, quality or place soever, to whom it
shall appertain, do diligently observe, and readily assist the due
performance of this Our Proclamation in all things.

Given at Our Court of White Hall, the seventeenth day of April, in the sixth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC. XXX.
