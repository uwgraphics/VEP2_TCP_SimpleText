A TESTIMONY To the True LIGHT That Lightens every Man that comes into the
World.

The People that did sit in Darkness have seen a great and glorious Light; and
unto those that were under the Region and Shadow of Death, is the Light of Life
arisen, and the Blessed Day sprung from on high, and shines in their
Tabernacles; And that which they have seen, heard, felt, and tasted of, the
same they have and do bear Testimony unto, though few there be that have
received their Testimony.

For who has believed our Report, and unto whom is the Arm of the Lord
Revealed.

But come ye, O House of Israel, and let us walk in the Light of the Lord.

W. B.

A Testimony to the True Light that lightens every Man that comes into the
World.
THe Light revealed within is the (narrow) Way to Life Eternal; and the Door
into the Fold of Everlasting Rest: the Light is the Entrance into the fresh and
green Pasture wherein the Lord feeds his Flock, and causes them to lie down
in peace and quietness, out of the reach of the Beasts of prey: the Light leads
and draws those that obey it, out of Darkness, and from under the region and
shadow of Death into the Land of the Living, there to dwell under the region
and shadow of Light and Life: the Light breaks the Bonds of Sin in pieces, and
snappeth the Cords of Iniquity asunder, and sets the soul free from the bondage
of Corruption, to serve the Lord in the Life of Righteousness: the Light
draws and leads those that believe in it, and obey it, out of the
alienation and separation from God, into the Everlasting Covenant of Life and
Love, where the Soul is in unity with the Lord: the Light searches the Heart,
and operateth in the secrets of the Minds of those that obeyed it, and like
unto Leaven works the Heart and Mind into its own nature, frame and quality:
the Light is pure, holy, and undefiled, and has no unity with the least impure
thought, word, or work, but judges and condemns it: the Light is meek,
contrite, lowly, and humble, and condemns that honor that is corrupt, and is
from below, and stands in the respect of persons; and it seeks the honor
of God only: the Light baptiseth Self into death, slayes the Boaster, puts
Flesh to silence, that God may speak in his Temple, who is not to be denied the
mouth to speak by: the Light is the heavenly treasure in the earthen vessel,
that brings honor and glory unto God: the Light has no fellowship with
Darkness; he that says he is in the Light, and has unity with the Light, and
yet loves and walks in Darkness, lies, and the Light has not room, place,
or entertainment in his heart: the Light teaches those that love it, to love
Enemies; its fruit is love, no envy, no malice, no hatred, no bitterness, no
enmity, no prejudice, no discord, no backbiting, no reviling, no
evil-whispering proceeds from the Light; the Light condemns it all, and that
ground from whence it springs: the Light has no unity with any unfruitful
works of Darkness, but reproves them: the Light teaches to render good for
evil, and to forgive Enemies, and to pray for Persecutors, and to have love and
good will to all people, and to seek and desire the Eternal good and welfare of
all Souls; he that hates and envies his Enemies abides not in the Light; Envy
is of the Evil-one; he that says he walks in the Light, and hates his
Brother, lies, and errs from the Truth: The Light teaches to love God with
thy whole heart, and thy Neighbor, or Brother, as thy self; He that says he
loves God, and hates his Brother, is a Liar; he that loves him that begets,
does also love those that are begotten of him; Love thinks no ill to Enemies,
much less to ^rethren: The Light leads his Children into love, peace and
unity with God, and one with another in the Life of Righteousness; oh, the
unity, the unity of Brethren in Light, Love and Life, of God, is exceeding
precious and comely, its compared like to precious oil, poured on the head,
that runs down on the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of
his Garment, and like the dew of Hermon, and like the dew that descended upon
the Mountain of Sion, where the blessing is, and where the Lord makes unto his
people a Feast of Fat things: The Light teaches, and makes to be of one
heart, of one mind, of one soul, and (in all those that walk in it) begets
one consent to serve and worship the only wise God, in the one Spirit, and one
Truth: The ^ight gives a good Understanding, a clear Discerning, a sound
Judgment: The Light leads not into strife and contention, nor into rents,
divisions, and parties, nor into a particularity, and self-seperation from the
body, nor into self-conceitedness, nor into high airy notions, nor into a
climbing up in imaginations after high discoveries; (and so slight the day of
small things, and neglect thy obedience to the present gift, through an
expectation of something greater to come yet unrevealed; and such like,
Lucifer, mounts high in their conceits and imaginations, but will fall to the
side of the pit;) but the Light condemns all this, and judges that spirit that
leads thereinto; which spirit sows discord among Brethren, which is
abomination; and that spirit leads some to speak evil of dignities, and to
despise dominion, and to rebel against the order and government of the Lamb:
The Light judges that spirit that sets up, and keeps up (out of the comely
descent order of Truth) that thing that tends to strife, and breaking unity
among Brethren: The Light teaches those that love it, to seek and endeavor for
love, peace, and unity among Brethren, with all self-denial: The Light teaches
to take away the occasion of stumbling in thy Brothers way: The Light teaches
to be very wary and careful of giving Enemies advantage to strengthen
themselves against Truth, and the Wicked occasion to reproach it, and those
that live in it: The Light teaches to live and walk in a holy godly life, and
blameless conversation, as becomes the Gospel of Truth, and as becomes Saints
of the Most High: The Light, in those that love it, crucifieth the Flesh with
the lusts and affectious thereof, and teaches those that love it, how to
possess their vessels in sanctification, and honor: The Light crucifieth the
heart unto the world, and worldly things, and redeemeth the mind from the Earth
and earthly things; and teaches to use the World as if thou use it not* The
Light draws the mind out of the many things (where all offend) into the one
thing needful, which gives not, nor receives an offense, but judges the
offenses, and that ground from whence they come: The Light is supernatural, and
is to overruled the naturals, and to keep them within the bounds of the
government of Truth, and to limit the affectionate part from leading and
drawing the heart and mind into things below, into created objects, and into
bondage to the cares of this life, and troubles and cumbrances of this World,
which does not profit but hinder to Godward: The Light is the girdle of the
loins of the mind, of those that love it, to gird up their hearts and minds
unto God, that in him their peace may be perfect: The Light is a stop to those
thoughts which are reproveable by it: The Light is a bridle to the tongue, and
they that know it so to be, dare not say (in a self-will) our tongues is our
own, and we will speak: The Light rules over the souls and bodies of those
that believe in, love, follow, and obey it, and teaches and enableth such to
yield their members servants of righteousness unto God, even as they have (when
they were servants to sin) yielded their members servants to unrighteousness,
and of iniquity unto iniquity: The Light is the Author of the true and living
Faith, which gives victory over the World, and is a shield unto the Soul, to
fend off the fiery darts of the Devil, and works by love to the purifying the
heart: The Light is the Author of the true hope, which is an anchor unto the
soul, sure and steadfast, and is held in a pure conscience, void of offense
toward God and man: The Light is the Author of true patience, long sufferance,
for bearance, forgiveness, and contentedness; it teaches to be patient in all
trials, tribulations, troubles, streights and difficulties, and teaches in all
conditions to be contented, and not to murmur against the Lord, whatsoever he
permits to come to pass: The Light teaches his children to love one another
servently, with a clean heart; oh, how good is God, to Israel, to them that are
of a clean heart: The Light teaches to endeavor to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace: The Light teaches the Younger to yield and submit
themselves to the Elder, in the Lord, and to hearken unto Counsel, Instruction,
and Reproof; he teaches all his children to be subject one to another; he
clothes them with humility, adorneth them with meekness, and beautifies them
with lowliness of spirit: The Light teaches the Strongest to condescend to the
Weakest, and to serve the meanest in love, to bear with the infirmities of the
feeble, to help, and hold up the halting, and to draw forward the backward with
the cords of Love, and to cast a garment over thy Brothers nakedness: The
Light, in those that love it, puts out the eye that watches for evil, and
condemns that part that boasts it self, and rejoices at another fall, and
strengthens it self with prejudice against another through his failing, which
thing is as most abominable filth in the pure Eye of the Light: The Light does
not countenance evil in any, but judges and discovers it, though hid under a
profession of Truth: The Light is like unto the Touchstone that trys Silver
from Tin, it tries and discovers the good from the bad; it tries motions,
thoughts, words, works, and spirits: The Light is a Stone which God has laid
in Sion, elect and precious, which they that believe, shall not be ashamed, and
unto those that believe he is very precious; but unto them that believe not, he
is as a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, at whom the seeming wise
Master Builders have, and do stumble; and he whom the wise Professors of this
Age, and great Rabies, and Learned Orators set at naught, the same is become
the Head and Chief Cornerstone in Gods House; by the virtue of which Stone
they that believes in him are quickened and made living stones, meet to be
joined unto him (the Light) in whom the Building being fitly framed together,
grows up unto an holy Temple in the Lord: The Light was in the beginning
before the Darkness was, and is now made manifest to extinguish the Darkness,
and to fill the dark corners of the Earth with the bright beams of his glory;
he is the First, and the Last; he was before Time, and will remain when that
which in time is passed away: The Light is the Beginning and the End, the
Foundation and Top-stone, the Root and Offspring of David, and the Bright
Morning Star, whose blessed Day Abraham saw, and was glad; he dwelt among the
seven golden Candlesticks, and was with the Church in the Wilderness, in the
days of old: He is the Light of the holy City, New-Jerusalem, which John (in
the Lord's Day) saw coming down from God, prepared as a Bride adorned for her
Husband: The Light gives the Churches to know, that it is he that searches
the Heart, and tries the Reins, from whom no Hypocrite in Sion can be hid; who
says, I come quickly, and my Reward is with me, to give unto every one
according as his work shall be: But who shall abide the Day of his Coming, (in
which the Heavens pass away with a great noise, and the Elements melt with
fervent heat) and who shall stand when he appears, who is like Refiners Fire,
and like Fullers Soap, purifying his Sanctuary, and cleansing his Temple in
which he delights to dwell? He is the Word that was in the beginning, by whom
all things were made that was made; and in him there is Life, and his Life is
the Light of men; and he is the true Light that lights every man that comes
into the World; he is the Express Image of his Fathers Glory, and is called the
Son of God, in whom dwells all fullness of Joy, Happiness, and Eternal
Felicity; who is God over all, and above all, blessed, blessed for ever and
evermore, Amen.

W. B.

OH, happy and blessed are the people, who though they once were Darkness, yet
now are Light in the Lord; Oh, walk ye, oh, walk ye as Children of Light,
bearing the pure Image of the Father of Lights, in whom is no Darkness at all;
nor variableness or shadow of turning; but is the same yesterday, so to day,
and for evermore.

FRiends that are Sufferers upon Truths account in Edmonds-Bury Goal, are in a
measure of health (through the Love, Goodness and ^ercy of the Lord, blessed
and magnified be his Name) this 7th day of the 10th Month 67; and their dear
love in the precious Truth dearly reaches forth unto all faithful Friends
every where, and you are often in their remembrance, desiring the Lord may
prosper you, and bless you with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus our
Lord, and keep you with us, and the whole Israel of God, by his Almighty Power
through Faith in his Name. unto his Heavenly Kingdom, and enable us all to
finish the work the Lord has given us (by his Power) to do; that we may
glorify him on Earth, that he may glorify us with himself, with that glory he
had before the World began; even so be it; and Amen says my Soul.

THE END.
