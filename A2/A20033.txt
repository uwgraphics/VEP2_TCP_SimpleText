Sir Degore.


LOrdynges and ye will hold you still
A gentle tale tell you I will
Of knights of this country
That has trauayled beyond the sea
To seek auentures both night and day
And how they might their strengh assay
As did a knight his name was sir Degore
One of the best that was found him before
Sometime in England there was a king
A noble man of manners in all thing
Stout in arms and under shylde
Full much doubted in battle and field,
There was no man than veramente
That with him Iusted in turmente
That out of his styrope might bring his foot
He was so strong without doubt
The king had no chyldern but one
A daughter as white as whalles bone
That maiden he loved as his life
Her mother was deed the queen his wife
In trauayll of child she dyed alas
But when that maiden of aege was
Kynkes sons her woed then
Emperors Dukes and other men
To have that maiden in marriage
For love of her great heritage
But than the king did them answer
That no man should wedde her
But if that he might with stout Iustynge
The king out of his sadyll bring
And down him lose his styropes two
Many one assayed and might naught do
Every year of right it would
A great feast wole he hold
Upon his queen's murnynge day
That was buried in an abbaye
So on a day the king would ride
To an abbaye there beside
To do dyryges and masses both
The poor to feed and the naked to clothe
His own daughter with him rode
And in the forest still she abode
She called her chamberlayne her to
And other maidens she did also
And said adowne she must alyght
Better her clothes to amend and right
Adowne they ben alyght all three
Her damoysell and so did she
A full long stounde there she abode
Till all the meyne from her rode
They gate up and after they would
But they could not they right way hold
The wodde was roughe and thycke ywysse
And they took their way all amysse
They rode southe they rode west
In to the thycke of that forest
And in to a land they came at the last
Than weryed they wonder fast
Than wist the well amysse they had gone
And down the light euerychone
And they called all in fere
But there might no man them here
The weder was hot before the none
They wist never what was best to done
But laid them down upon the grene
Some fell on sleep as I wene
Thus they fell on sleep euerychone
Save the kings daughter alone
She went about and gadred flowers
And to here the song of small fowls
So long she did forth pas
That she wist never where she was
ye way to her damoyselles she would have nome
But she wist never how to come
Than began she cry wonder sore
She wept and wrong her hands thore
And said alas that I was borne
For well I wot I am forlorn
For wild bestes will me rynde
Or any man may me find
And then she saw a Joyful sight
To her came prekynge a fair knight
Full well he seemed a gentle man
And rich clothes him upon
Well farynge both of foot and hand
There was non such in that land
So stout a man than was he
He said madame god you se
Be ye a drade of me right naught
I have none arms with me brought
I have the loved this many a year
And now I have found the here
Thou shalt be my le^manne or I go
Wheder it turn to well or woe
No more to done then could she
But wept and cried and would have fle
Anon began he her to be hold
And did with her what he would
And berafte her her maiden hode
And than before the lady he stood
He said madame gentle and fre
With child I wot well that ye be
Well I wot it shall be a knave
Therefore my sword he shall have
My good sword of ameaunt
For therewith I slew a gyaunt
I brake the point in his head
And in the field I it leued
Dame take it up lo it is here
For thou spekest not with me this many a year
And yet parauenture the time may come
That I may speak with my sone
And by this sword I may him ken
He kyssed his love and went then
The knight passed as he come
All weeping the lady that sword up nome
She went away sore weeping
And found her maidens slepynge
She hid the sword so as she might
And called them up anon right
And took their horses euerychone
And began to ride soon anon
And than there came at the last
Many a knight prekynge fast
Fro the king than were they sent
To were wheder they went
They brought them in to the hye way
And rode in fere to that abbaye
There was done service and all thing
With many a mass and rich offering
And when that service was all done
And began to pass the hye none
The king unto his palace began ride
And much people by his side
When every man was glad and blythe
The lady soned many a sithe
Her baly waxed more and more
She wept and wrong her hands sore
So upon a day she began sore weep
A maiden of hers took good keep
And said madame for charity
Why ye do weep ye will tell me
Maiden and I tell the before
And thou me wrey I were but lore
For I have been ever meke and mylde
And truly now I am with child
And if any man it under yede
Every man would tell in every stead
That my fader on me it wan
For I loved never other man
And if my fader it may wete
Such sorrow his heart may get
That he shall never merry man be
For all his Joy is laid on me
And told the damoysell all in fere
How the child was begoten on here
Now gentle lady grieve you naught
For still it shall be forth brought
Shall no man it wit certainly
Truly madame but you and I
Time was come she was unbound
And delivered both hole and sound
A man child there was bore
Glad was the lady therefore
The maiden served her at her will
And laid the child in a cradyll
She wrapped him in clothes anon
And was all ready for to have gone
Yet was the child unto the mother hold
She gave it.xx. pound of gold
And.x. pound of silver also
Under his heed she began it do
Much it is that a child behoues
She put with him a pair of gloves
Herlemman gave her them in a stand
They would else on no woman's hand
On chyldes another woman they nolde
But on his moders hands they would
And bad the child no wife wedde in land
But the gloves would on her hand
For they might serve no where
Save the mother that did him bear
A letter with the child put she
With the gloves also perde
She knyt the letter with a threde
A boute his neck a full good speed
Than was it in the the letter writ
Who so it found should it wit
For crystes love if any good man
This woeful child find can
Do him be crystened of priests hand
And to help him to live in land
With this silver that is here
Till he may arms bear
And help him with his own good
For he is come of gentle blood
And when she had thus done
The maiden took her leave full sone
With the child in the cradyll and all thing
She stale away in the evening
And went her way she wyste not whyder
Thrughe thycke and thynne in the breer
She went all the winter night
By shynynge of the moon light
Then was she redely ware anon
Of an hermytage made of stone
An holy man had there his dwelling
And theder she went without lesynge
And set the cradyll at the door
For she durst dwell no longer thore
But turned again a none right
And came again the same night
The hermyte rose on the morrow tho
And his knave also
Lord he said I cry the mercy
For now I here a young child cry
This holy man his door vndyde
And found the cradell in the stead
He lift up the shete anon
And looked upon the little grome
Than held he up his right hand
And thanked Ihesu christ of his sonde
He bare the child in to the chapel
For Joy of him he ronge the bell
And laid up the gloves and the tresoure
And crystened the child with great honor
And in the worship of the trynyte
He called the chyldes name Degore
For Degore to understand it is
But thing that almoost is lost ywys
As thing that is almoost a goo
Therefore he called that child so
The hermyte was an holy man of life
He had a sister that was a wife
He sent the child to her full rathe
With much money by his knave
And badde she should take good head
The child to nourysshe and feed
And this little child Degore
Unto that cite was I bore
The good man and his wife in fere
The child they kept as it their own were
Till it was.x. winter old
He waxed a fair child and a bold
Well taught fair and kind
There was none such in all that end
What time.x. year was come and spente
Unto the hermyte they him sent
The hermyte longed him for to se
Then was he a fair child and fre
He taught the child of clerks lore
Other.x. winter withouten more
And when he was of.xx. year
He was a man of great powere
There was no young man in that land
That might stand a brayde of his hand
And when the hermyte that did see
That he a man so strong would be
A stalworthe man in any work
And of his time a well good clerk
He took his florens and his gloves
That he had kept sor him in his house
But his.x. pound that was sterlynge
was spente about the chyldes keeping
The hermyte took him his lettre to read
He looked therein that same stead
Sir he said for saint charity
Was this lettre made by me
Ye sone by him that me deem shall
Thus I found the and told him all
He set him down on knees full blythe
And thanked the hermyte many sithe
And said he would not rest in land
Till the time he had his fader fond
He gave the hermyte half his gold
And the remenaunt up he fold
He took his leave and feign would go
The hermyte said he should not so
To seek thy kynne thou may not endure
Without good horse and good armure.
How sir Degore fought with a dragon in a forest and slew him.
SIr hermyte he said in deed
I will have no other wede
But a batte in mi hand
Mine enemies therewith to withstand
A full good sapelynge of an oak
On whom he set therewith a stroke
Where he never so tall a man
Nor yet so good armure him upon
He would him fell to the ground
With that same batte in that stounde
The child kyssed the hermyte tho
And took his leave for to goo
Degore went forth on his way
Thrughe a forest half a day
He hard no man nor saw none
Till it was past the hye none
Then hard he great strokes fall
That made great noise withal
Full soon he thought that thing to se
To wit what the strokes might be
There was an earl both stout and gay
He was come theder that same day
For to hunte for a dear or a do
But his hounds were gone him fro
Then was there a dragon great and grymme
Full of fire and also venimme
with a wide throat and tuskes great
Upon that knight fast began he beat
And as a lion then was his fete
His tail was long and full unmeet
Between his head and his tail
Was.xxii. foot withouten fail
His body was like a wine tonne
He shone full bright against the son
His eyes were bright as any glass
His scales were hard as any brass
And thereto he was necked like a horse
He bare his head up with great force
The breath of his mouth that did out blow
As it had been a fire on low
He was to look on as I you tell
As it had been a fend of hell
Many a man he had shente
And many a horse he had rent
And to that earl hard battle began
But he defended him like a man
And boldly smote him with his sword
But of all his strokes he was not aferde
His skin was hard as any stone
Wherefore he might him no harm done
And when the earl sir Degore se
Help sir he said for saint charity
And then answerde sir Degore
Full gladly sir and god before
when the dragon of Degore had a sight
He left the earl and came to him right
And the child that was so strong
Took his staff that was long
And smote the dragon so on the crown
That in that wodde he fell down
And then that dragon anon right
Smote the child with such might
With his tail upon the right side
That down he fell in that tide
And he sterte up anon full right
And defended him with much might
With that staff that was so long
He brake of him both foot and bone
That it was wonder for to se
He was so toughe he might not deye
Till Degore one stroke at him flonge
With his staff that was so strong
He smote him on the crown on hye
That he made his brains out fly
And then the earl was glade and blythe
And thanked Degore many a sithe
And prayed him he would with him ride
Unto his palace there be side
And there he made him a knight
And made him good chere that night
Rentes tresoure and half his land
He would have sezyd in to his hand
Sir Degore thanked him truly
And prayed him of his curtaysye
To let his ladies before him come
Wives medens more and some
And also your daughter eke
And if my gloves ben for them mete
Or will upon any of there hondes
Than would I feign take my lands
And if my gloves will not so
Then will I take my leave and goo
All the women were out brought
That there about might be sought
All the assayed the gloves than
But they where mete for no woman
Sir Degore took up his gloves anon
And also took leave for to gone
The Earl was a lord of gentle blood
He gave sir Degore a stead right good
And thereto he gave him good armure
The which was both fair and sure
And also a page his man to be
And an hakneye to ride on truly
Sir Degore was glade and blythe
And thanked the earl many a sithe
He rode forth upon his way
Many a mile upon summers day
Upon a day much people he met
He houed still and fair them grette
And asked a squyre what tydynge
And from whens came all that folk riding
The squyre said sir veramente
They come from the parlamente
Fro a counseyll the king did make
The which is for his daughters sake
But when the parliament was most plenere
The king let cry both fer and nere
If any man were so bold
That with the king Just would
He should have his daughter in marriage
And all his land and heritage
It is a land both good and fair
And the king thereto had none air
But sertes there dare no man grant thereto
Many one said they might not do
For every man that rydeth to him
He beteth them with strokes grym
Some he breketh the neck anon
Of some he cracketh both back and bone
Some thrughe the body he glytte
And some to death he smytte
And to him may no man do nothing
Such a grace ever had our king
Sir Degore stood in a stody than
And thought he was a doughty man
And I am in my young blood
And I have horse and armure good
And as I trow a full good stead
I will assaye if that I may speed
And if I may bear the king down
I may be a man of great renown
And if that he me fell can
There knows no body what I am
Death or life what so me be tide
I will ones against him ride
Thus in the cite his ynne he takes
And rested him and merry makes
So upon a day the king he met
He kneled down and fair him grette
He said sir king of much might
My lord has sent me to you right
To warn you how it shall be
My lord will come and fight with the
To Just with the my lord has nome
The king said he shall be welcome
Be he knight or barowne
Earl Duke or chorle in town
There is no man I will forsake
Who all may win all may take
How sir Degore Iusted with the king of England and smote him down.
SO on the morrow the day was set
The king auysed much the bette
But then there was no living man
That Degore trusted much upon
But to church that time went he
To here a mass of the trynyte

To the fader he offered a floryne
And to the sone another fine
The third to the holy ghost he offered
The priest in his mass for him prayed
And when the mass was done
Unto his ynne he went anon
He did arm him well in deed
In rich armure good at need
His good stead he began to stryde
And took his spear and forth did ride
His knave took an other spear
And after his master began it bear
Thus in the field sir degore a bode than
They king came with many a man
Many came theder redely
To se the iustynge truly
All that in the field were
They said and did swear
That they never or that time se
So fair a man with their eye
As was that young knight sir Degore
But non wist what man was he
They rode to gyder at the last
On their good stedes full fast
The king had the gretter shafte
And more he could of that craft
To dasshe him down then had he mente
And in his shylde set shuche a dente
That his good spear all to braste
But Degore was strong and sat fast
Than said the king alas alas
For me befell never such a case
There was never man that I might hit
That ever might my stroke sytte
This is a man all for the nones
For he is a man of great bones
Then took the king a gretter tree
And square also mote I the
And if his neck will not a two
His back shall or that I goo
The king rode to him with great randowne
And thought to have dasshed the child down.
He smote sir Degore soon anon
Right before the brst bone
That his horse was rered on hye
And sir Degore was fallen nigh
Sir Degore thus his course out yode
He was sore angry in his mode
Alas he said I have myssed yet
And he has me twyes hit
And never ones with him I met
By god I shall me auyse bet
They rode together with great might
In their sheldes their speres pyght
That their good speres all to broke
Unto their hands with the stroke
And than the king began to speak
Give me a spear that will not break
For he shall anon be smyten down
Though he be as strong as was sampsowne
And if he be the devil of hell
I shall him soon down fell
The king took a spear styfe and stronke
And Degore took a another good and long
And stouly to the king he smytte
The king him failed and Degore him it
And sir Degore so him beat
That he made the kings horse torn up his fete.
Boldly he rode up than
And seemed a full goodly man
The king was out of his sadyll cast
Whereof his daughter was sore a gaste
Then was there much noise and cry
The king was sore asshamed for thy
Well I wot his daughter was sorry
Fer then she wyste redely
That she should married be
To a man of a strange country
And led her life with such one
That she wyste never fro whens he come
The king said to sir Degore
Come heder fair sone me before
And thou were as gentle a man
As thou semest to look vpan
And thou could wit and reason do
As thou art doughty man to
I would think my land well beset
And if it were five times the bet
For word spoken I must needs hold
Before my barons that be so bold
I take the my daughter by the hand
And sesse the in all my land
To be mine heir after me
In Joy and bliss for to be
How sir Degore wedded his mother the ky^ges daughter of England / and how
show knew yt he whas her sone by the gloves.
Great ordinance was there wrought
To the church door they were brought
And were there wedded veramente
Unto the holy sacrament
Look what folly happened there
That he should wedde his own modere
The which had borne him one her side
And yet he knew nothing that tide
He knew nothing of her kenne
Nor she knew nothing of him
And both together ordained to bed
Yet parauenture they may be sybble
Thus did sir Degore the bold
He wedded his mother to have and to hold
God suffered much thing there
But yet he let them not sin in fere
It passed on the hye time of none
And the day was nere hand done
To bed was brought both he and she
With great myrthe and solempnyte
Sir Degore stood and be held than
And thought of the hermyte holy man
That he should never for thy
Wedde no Wedowe nor lady
But if she might the gloves two
Lyhtly upon her hands do
Alas than said sir Degore
The time that ever I was bore
And said anon with heavy chere
Me had lever than all this kingdom here
That is now sessyed in to my hand
That I were fair out of this land
The king these words hard tho
And said dear sone why say thou so
Is there ought ayenste thy will
Other done or said that does the ill
Or any thing that is mysdone
Tell me and it shall be amended sone
Nay lord he said then
But for all the marriage that done has been
I will not with no woman mell
Wife wedowe nor damoysell
But if she might these gloves do
Lightly upon her hands two
And when the lady began this here
A none she changed all her chere
And all to gyder turned her mode
Her visage waxed read as any blood
She knew that the gloves longed to her
And said give me the gloves fair sir
She took the gloves in that that stead
And lightly upon her hands them did
She fell down and began to cry
And said lord god I ask mercy
I am thy mother that the did bear
And thou art my own sone dear
Sir Degore full sone tho
Took her up in his arumes two
Than were they glade and blythe
They kyssed to gyder many a sithe
The king of them had great meruayll
Of the noise they made withouten fayll
And was a basshed of their weeping
And said daughter what is this thing
Fader she said will ye it here
Ye wene that I a maiden were
Nay truly fader I am none
For it is.xx. winter a gone
This is my sone god it wot
And by these gloves I it wotte
She told him all together there
How he was begoten on here
Than bespake sir Degore
Sweet mother than said he
Where is my fader wonnynge
And when herd ye of him any tythynge
Sone she said by heaven king
I can tell of him no tydynge
But when thy fader from me went
A poyntles sword he me lent
And charged me to keep it than
Till the time thou were a man
She fette the sword full swythe
And sir Degore it out twythe
Long and broad it was perde
There was none such in that country
Truly said sir Degore than
Who so it owed he was a man
Now god of heaven he me keep
Night nor day I will not sleep
Till the time I may my fader se
In crystendome if that he be
He made him merry that ylke night
On the moro when it was day light
He went to the church to here mass
And made him ready for to pass
Than said the king my next kynne
I will give the knights with the to win
Sir he said gramercy than
With shall go no other man
But my knave that may take head
To mine armure and to my stead
He lepte on horse the sothe to say
And rode forth on his Iournaye
Many a mile and many away
He rode forth on his palfraye
And ever more he rode west
Till time he came to a forest
Wild bestes there went him by
And fowls song there full merely
So long he rode till it drew to night
The sone went down and failed light
Unto some town feign would he ride
But there was none on neither side
Soon after he found a castle clear
A lady truly wonned there
A fair castle of lyme and stone
But other town there was none
Degore said to his knave that tide
Will we to that castle ride
And all night abide will we
And ask lodging for charity
The drabryge was drawn tho
And the yate stood open also
Unto the castle they began them speed
And first he stabled up his stead
And than he set up his hakeney
I noughe they found of corn and hey
He went a boute and began to call
Both in the court and eke in hall
Nether for love nor yet for awe
Living man none there they saw
And in the mids of the hall flower
There was a great fire in that stoure
Than said his man leave sire
I have wonder who made this fire
If he will come agaye this night
I will him abide as I am knight
He set him done upon the dease
And made him well at ease
Than was he ware soon of one
That at the door he began gone
And three maidens fair and fre
That where trussed up to the knee
Twain of them bows did bear
And two of them charged were
With venyson that was full good
Then sir Degore up stood
And blessed them a none right
But they spoke not to the knight
But whente in to the cambre a none
And shytte the door full sone
And a none after therwithall
There came a dwarf in to the hall
Four foot was the length of him
His vysage was both great and grym
And the hear that on his heed was
It was yelo as any way
But full stouly than looked he
He ware a cyrcote that was grene
With blaunchmer it was furred I wene
He was well clade and well dyght
His shone was corked as a knight
He was large both of foot and hand
As any man was in that land
Sir Degore looked on him tho
And to him reverence did do
And he to him would speak no word
But made him besy to lie the board
He laid the clothe and set forth bread
And also wine both white and read
Torches in the hall he did light
All thing ready to souper he dyght
And sone after with great honor
There came a lady out of her boure
And with her came maidens fyftene
Some in read and some in grene
Sir Degore followed a none right
And naught she spoke unto that knight
But yede and washed euerychone
And to souper began they gone
The lady was fair and bright
In the mids of the desse she set down right
On every side sat maidens fine
Fair and goodly as any was a live
By god than said sir Degore
I have you blessed and ye not me
But ye seem dombe by saint Johan
I shall make you speak and I can
Sir Degore could of curteysy
He yede and sat before the lady
And when he had taken that sete
He took a knyfe and cut his mete
Full little mete at souper ete he
He did so be hold that maiden fre
Him thought she was the fairest lady
That ever before he did se
All his heart thought and might
Was on that lady that was to bright
And when they had souped all
The dwerfe brought water in to the hall
Then began they wasshe euerychone
And than to chamber began they gone
Truly quod Degore and after I will
To look on that lady all my fill
Who that me warns he shall abye
Or to do him make a sorry cry
Upon the stayre the way he nome
And soon in to the chamber he come
They lady that was so fair and bright
Vpno her bed she sat down right
She harped notes sweet and fine
Her maidens filled a pyece of wine
And sir Degore sat him down
For to here the harpes sown
That through the notes of the harp shyll
He laid him down and slepte his fill
This fair lady that ylke night
She bad go cover that gentle knight
And rich clothes about him cast
And the lady went to a another bed at the last
So on the morrow when it was day
The lady rose the sothe to say
And in to the chamber her way began take
She said sir knight a rise and wake
They lady said all in game
Ye be well worthy to have blame
For as a be all night thou did sleep
And of my maidens tokest no keep
And than answered the knight so fre
Mercy madame and forgive it me
The notes of thine harp it made
Or else the good wine that I hade
But tell me now my lady hende
Or I out of this chamber wend
who has this castle in his hand
And who is lord of this land
wheder that ye be maiden or wife
And in what manner ye led your life
And why ye have so many women
Alone withouten any men
Sir feign I would the tell
And thou could it amend well
My fader was a bold barowne
And holden a lord of toure and town
He had never child but me
I am air in this country
How sir Degore fought for a lady with a gyaunt and slew him.
THere has me wowed many a knight
And many a squyre well dyght
But than their wonned here beside
A stout gyaunt full of pride
He has me desired long and yore
And him to love may I never more
He is a boute with his mestrye
To do me shame and velonye
And he has slain my men ychone
Save my sorry dwerfe alone
Right as they stood she fell to ground
And soned there in that stounde
All her damoyselles to her come
To comfort her and her up nome
The lady looked on sir Degore
Lefe dame then said he
Be not adrad whiles I am here
I will the help to my powere
Sir she said then all my land
I wll it cesse in to thy hand
And all my good I will the give
And all my body while I live
For to be at all your will
Erly and late loud and still
And thy lemman for to be
To wreke me now on mine eneme
That was Degore feign to fight
For to defend that ladies right
And to sle that other knight
And win that lady that was so bright
And as they stood both in fere
Her maidens came riding with heavy chere
She bad draw the bryge hastily
For here comes your enemy
Or else he will sle us ychone
Sir Degore sterte up anon
Out at a wyndowe he him se
He was sone armed on horse hye
So stout a man as he was one
In arms saw she never none
Sir Degore armed him by live
And our of the castle he began drive
And rode even the gyaunt again
They smote together with much main
That their good speres all to brast
Degore was stroge and sat fast
But his stedes bake braste a two
Then sir Degore fell to the ground tho
And then he sterte up and loughe
And his good sword he out drughe
Than said the gyaunt to him anon
On foot we will to gyder gone
Thou have said Degore slain my good stead
I hope to quyte the thy mede
To sle thy stead naught I will
But to fight with the my fill
And tho they fought on foot in fere
With strong strokes on helm clear
The gyaunt gave sir Degore
Houge strokes great plente
And sir Degore did him also
Till helm and basynet barste in two
The gyanut was a grieved sore
Because he had his blood lore
He stroke upon sir Degore so
That to the ground he made him goo
Sir Degore recovered soon a plyght
And such a stroke he gave that knight
And on the crown so it set
That throw his helm and basynet
He made the sword go through his het
And anon the gyaunt fell down deed
The lady sat in her castle
And fawe all the hold battle
How the gyaunt was slain
That would her have forlayne
She was as glade of that sight
As ever was bryde of the day light
Sir Degore came to the caestll
Ano against him came that damoysell
She thanked him of his good deed
And in her chamber she did him led
She set him on her bed anon
And unarmed him full sone
She took him in her harms two
And kyssed him.C. times and mo
And said all my good I will the give
And my body while I live
Gramercy damoysell then said he
Of that ye have granted me
But I must in to far contree
Mo auentures for to se
Unto this twelve months be ago
And then I shall come you to
He betoke her to the heaven king
The lady wept at his departing
Sir Degore rode upon his way
Many a long Journey
And ever more he rode west
Till a land he found in a forest
To him came prekynge a knight
Well armed and on his horse dyght
In arms that would endure
With fine gold and rich asure
Three bore hedes were theryne
They which were of gold fine
As soon as ever he saw that knight
He spoke to him a none right
And said velayne what do thou here
In my forest to sle my dear
Sir Degore said with words meke
Sir of thy dear I take no keep
For I am auenturous knight
That gothe to seek war and fight
His fader answered and said saunfayll
And thou be come to seek battle
Then make the ready in a stounde
For thou haste thy fellow found
And then sir Degore without daungere
Armed him to fight with his fadere
How sir Degore fought with his fader and how his fader knew him by the broken
sword.
A Well godd helm for the nones
And well set with precyus stones
It might well be his own saunfayll
For he wanne it ones in battle
He kest his shield about his swear
Of ryall arms good and dear
His good stead he began to stryde
He took his spear and began to ride
And his man took an other spear
And by his side he began it bear
But look what folly began that tide
The sone against the fader began ride
But neither knew other a right
And thus began they to fight
Sir Degore had the greater shafte
And wonder well he could his craft
To dasshe him down than had he went
And in his shield gave such a dente
That his good spear all to brast
But his fader was strong and sat fast
Another course than have they take
The fader for the sons sake
So hard they smote together in sothe
That their horses backs broke both
And then they fought on foot in fere
Wirh hard strokes on helm clear
And thus his fader a meruayled was
Of his sword that was poyntles
And to him said anon right
Abide a while thou gentle knight
Where was thou borne and in what land
Sir he said in England
A kings daughter is my mother
But I wot not who is my fader
What is thy name then said he
Sir my name is Degore
Sir Degore thou art welcome
For well I wot thou art my sone
By this sword I know the here
The point is in my pautenere
He took the point and set it to
And they accorded both two
So long they have spoke together
Both the sone and the fader
That they be right well at one
The fader and the sone alone
Sir Degore and his fader dear
In to England they rode in fere
They were both armed and well dyght
As it becomes every knight
They rode forth on their Journey
Many a mile of that country
And on their way they rode full fast
In to England they came at the last
When they might England se
They drew theder as they would be
When they where to that palace come
They where welcome all and some
And they beheld over all
The lady them spyed over a wall
And when that lady saw that sight
She went to them with all her might
And right well she them knew
And than she changed all her hew
And said my dear sone Degore
Thou have thy fader brought with the
Truly madame than said he
Full well I wot that it is he
Now thanked be god than said the king
For now I wot without lesynge
Who is sir Degores fader in deed
The lady swoned in that stead
And sone after sekerly
The knight wedded that lady
She and her sone was departed I twynne
For he and she were to nigh of kynne
Forth then went sir degore
With the king and his meyne
His fader and his mother dear
Unto they castle they went in fere
Where as dwelled that lady bright
That he had won in fight
And wedded her witth great solempnyte
Before all the lords of that country
Thus came the knight out of his care
God give us grace well to fare
And that we all upon domes day
Come to the bliss that lasts ay.
AMEN
