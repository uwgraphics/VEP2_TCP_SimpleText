By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty being of late time infourmed by the Ambassador here
resident for her good brother the king of Spain, that sundry evil disposed
and rebellious people inhabitauntes within the said kings low countries had
come into this her Realm, and from thence were secretly returned into the
said low countries, where they did commit many robberyes, spoils, and
murders: hereupon both for the inquisition of the truth hereof, and to provide
remedy therein, did give special charge to her officers of all her Ports
frontyng upon the said low countries, to enquire whether any kind of people
that might be suspected of such crimes, or of the intentions to commit the
same, had so resorted into her Realm, whom to apprehende (if they could be
found) they should use all diligence, and to foresee that none herafter in
whom any such suspicion could be noted, should be either received into her
Ports, or be licenced to return with any furniture for mayntenaunce of their
rebellion or other like crime. Whereupon although her Majesty had no
advertisement from any officers of her Ports of any such default to have been
committed, although many other persons of the said low country of late time
were arrived, partly in their accustomed manner for trade of Marchaundize,
partly to enjoy in this Realm a quietness of their consciences in the service
of god, which they preferred before al worldly respects of their native
countries, possessions, or friends, a matter very lamentable: Yet her Majesty
being again required by the said Ambassador to cause the foresaid orders to
be more generally and effectually directed to all manner her Ports, for that it
had been newly infourmed to him that in some places for lack of diligent
regard, there were diverse that did purpose secretly to imbarke them selves
toward the low countries with armor and such like, to the intent to rebel
against the said king, and to commit other horrible crimes: Her Majesty
meaning in no wise to permit any such kind of evil disposed people to have
either access or succor in any part of her dominions, straightly wills and
charge all and every her officers and ministers, of what quality soever the
same be, having office or charge in any her Ports or Creekes, as they will
answer at their uttermost perils, that they suffer none of the said kings
subjects, in whom may be found any apparaunt suspicion of rebellion against
the said king, or of the committyng or intention to commit any murder or
robbery, to land in any place of her dominions: but that the same persons so
to be suspected may be stayed, and his or their state and condition duly
enquired of. And if it shall any wise appear, that he or they may be duly
suspected: that the same shall be either stayed or repelled, and not suffered to
abide or have any succor within her Majesty's dominion. And like wise that no
subjects of the said king, nor any other person of the Queens Majesty's
dominion, being armed or otherwise furnished to serve like a man of war, be
suffered to depart out of the Realm toward the said low countries, without
certain proof and knowledge that the same preparation and furniture is meant
to serve for the defense of any ships of Marchaundize tradyng to any place
for Marchaundize only, or for the apprehention of Pirates, as the case may
necessaryly require. And if any to the contrary shall attempt the same, then to
stay them in safety to be forth coming, and to advertise her Majesty or her
counsel attendyng upon her person, of the qualities of the said persons and
their furniture, so as punishment and remedy may be spedyly given according to
the quality of the offense, and to such treaties as for the like cases have been provided betwixt both their Majesty's progenitors and predecessors.

Yeuen at her Majesty's Manor of Haueryng the.xv. day of July, in the year of
our Lord God. 1568. and the tenth year of her Majesty's reign. GOD save the
Queen.
