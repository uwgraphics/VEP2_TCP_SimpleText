JAMES by the grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables,
Churchwardens, and Headboroughes. And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes,
and Towns Corporate. And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects
whatsoever they be as well within Liberties as without, to whom these Presents
shall come, greeting.
Whereas We are credibly given to understand as well by the humble Supplication
and Petition of one Religious Philotheos a Grecian, and Procurator general of
the Covent of the holy Cross of Golgotha in Jerusalem, situate in the very
same place where our Savior dyed upon the Cross for our Redemption, as also
by other sufficient testimony. That in the foresaid most sacred and holy
Place, that ever renowned and famous Saint HELEN, out of her extraordinary
zeal and devotion unto our blessed Savior, built a most rich and sumptuous
Monastery and Temple, the which (not without great injury and dishonor to
Christian Religion) the Turks would have made a Mesquit of Mahomet, for which
cause the Religious of the foresaid Monastery were forced to promise the
payment of three thousand crowns yearly to the great Turk, that only they
might have liberty to celebrate divine Service in that sacred place, where the
precious blood of Christ was shed, the Turks having deprived them of the Rents
thereunto appertayning, and which heretofore they did possess, wherefore being
persuaded that al Christian Kings and Princes which believe that CHRIST JESUS
dyed in the aforesaid place, to be bound in charity to succor with their
gifts and alms the foresaid Religious men there residing, especially in regard
they are engaged to pay six thousand crowns to free from death thirteen of
the said Religious men, which were condemned to death unjustly, and in the
defense of the holy Faith of JESUS CHRIST, by those barbarous Infidels, as is
manifest by evident testimony, who not having wherewith to pay down the said
six thousand crowns, were constrained to undertake the payment of fifteen in
the hundred yearly for interest, until the principal money be paid, to
which end the King of Spain has already sent his Royal alms, Therefore the
said Religious Philotheos has most humbly besought Us, that of Our Princely
favor, and bounty in a matter of so great a consequence, We would be pleased
for the better maintenance of the said Temple, and preserving the same from the
brabarous Infidels, and for the redemption of the said thirteen Religious men,
to afford them such relief as to others has been granted by way of a
Collection of the charity of well disposed persons as well within Our City of
London as in certain Counties in this Our Realm, unto whose request (We
being moved with a Princely and pious commiseration toward the poor
Christians in that place residing, and for the preservation of those ancient
monuments which yet remain in the place of our Redemption, from the hands of
Infidels, have thought fit to condescend unto as a matter well beseeming Us,
being determined to contribute Our Princely alms to the same end and purpose
Our self: Not doubting but that all good Christians upon the due consideration
of the premises, will be ready and willing, and the rather for Our
commendation hereof, and Our own example herein, to extend their liberal
