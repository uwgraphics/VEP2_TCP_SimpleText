By the Privy Counsel.
A Commandment that no suitors come to the Court for any private suite except
their petitions be indorsed by the Master of Requests. 1594.
WHereas many and sundry orders, have been formerly conceived and published by
Proclamtion, and other wise by her Majesty's express commandment, for the
restraint of the inordinate repair of multitudes of Suitors to the Court, with
Petitions and Complaints to her Majesty or her Privy Counsel: whereof
commonly the most part are for matters private, unmeet to be preferred to her,
or for a Counsel of State to deal in: or be such as are depending or decidable
in some of her Majesty's Courts of Justice, or equity at westminster or other
places in the Realm: which former orders are not observed, to the great
distike of her Majesty, and the trouble and hinderance of her Counsel in the
dispatch of her Highness important services: It is now therefore otrdered and
enjoined that all Suitors, that from henceforth shall upon color or cause of
Suite, intend to exhibit complaint or petition to her Majesty or to her
Counsel, shall first acquaint there with one of the Masters of Requests, if
any of them shall be attendant in the Court, who with one of the Clerks of the
Counsel then attendant upon hearing of the complaints, or upon view and
consideration of their petitions, shall indorse the substance of the matter,
with their opinions subscribed with their hands: But if the Master of Requests,
shall be out of the Court, so as the Clerk of the Counsel then attendant in
the Court, cannot be present with the Master of the Requests at the hearing of
the Complainant, then the Master of the Requests shall indorse the Bill with
his opinion, and shall send the same to the Clerk of the Counsel then
attendant, who shall present the same to the Privy Counsel at their next
sitting, to be answered as shall be found meet by the Counsel. And the
Master of the Requests to refer the rest of the Suitors, with their
complaints to ordinary Courts of Justice or equity as the cause shall
require: And to direct all other Suitors in causes, neither meet to be
preferred to her Majesty, nor to be heard by the Privy Counsel, nor yet
meet for any other ordinary Court of Justice or equity, to depart and not to
remain as Suitors about the Court, upon pain of imprisonment, and so to be
committed by direction of the Masters of Requests by warrant under his hand to
the Knight Marshall or his Deputy.

And the Master of the Requests shall also deliver the names, of the parties
that shall be rejected, to the Queens Majesty's Porter, to the intent he may
know whom to exclude: and upon the direction on the complaints so indorsed, the
Suitors shall address themselves to follow the said direction, and in no other
sort to follow their suites. And therefore it is ordered, that at such time as
any manner person (not being her Majesty's known servant, or not of the degree
and condition of a known gentleman) shall offer to come in at the Court gates,
as to be a Suitor, the Queens Majesty's Porters shall inform the party of
this order, and shall direct him or her to the Chamber of one of the Masters of
the Requests, if any of them shall be in the Court: And if none of them shall be
in the Court, then the Porters shall command the party not to continue in the
Court, but to repair to the house of one of the Masters of Requests, and
afterward as his petition shall be indorsed, he shall admit him to come into
the Court, or reject him: straightly prohibiting all persons not to press in at
the Court gate as Suitors, to exhibit any petition or complaint, without their
Bill shall be first so endorsed by the said Master of the Requests and Clerk
of the Counsel as abouesayd: or that the party shall be licensed by some of
the privy Counsel, upon special cause known to repair unto the Court, to
exhibit his complaint to the Queens Majesty, or to the Counsel, upon pain of
imprisonment in the Marshalseas, during their Lordships pleasure.

At the Court at Greenewich the xx. of August. 1594.

Queens most excellent Majesty. 1595.
