By the King.
A Proclamation prohibiting the untimely bringing in of Wines, etc.
FOrasmuch as his Majesty is informed, That there is a general complaint,
that the Wines of France, which are brough into this Kingdom, are not, neither
have been for many years past, so lasting, nor so good and wholesome for men's
bodies, as they were in former times; whereof the chief causes are apparently
found to be, as well in some some Merchants and others, who (out of greediness
of private gain) have used of late years to fetch and bring in those Wines
sooner in the year, then in ancient times was used or allowed by the Statutes
of this Realm: As also in the Frenchmen, who do thereupon for the most part
use to cut their Vines, before the Grapes are fully ripe, And likewise do not
suffer the Wines to have their due and true making, before the same be bought
and sent into this Realm; His Majesty therefore to prevent the like
inconveniences hereafter, in a commodity so much tending to the health of his
Subjects, Does straightly prohibit and forbid, All and every person and persons
whatsoever, as well being His natural borne Subjects, as Denizens, either
directly or indirectly, from hence forth to vnship, discharge or lay on land,
any new Wines of the growth of France, at or in any Port, Haven, Creek, or
other place within his Highness Realm of England, and Principality of Wales,
Or to buy or receive any new Wines of the growth of France, being brought in by
any others, until the first day of December now next coming. And so until
the first day of December yearly upon pain of His Majesty's displeasure, and
such penalties, as by the Laws of this his Majesty's Realm of England, may be
inflicted upon persons offending against His Majesty's Royal commandment. And
for the better execution hereof, His Majesty does further charge and command
All Customers, Comptrollers, and other Officers of His Ports, to whom it shall
appertain, And all Fermers of the Customs and Imposts, now, and for the time
being, their Clerks and Substitutes, That they and every of them, dot forbear
to take any Entries of such new Wines of the growth of France, that shall be
brought into this Realm, by any person or persons whatsoever, until the said
first day of December now next coming, and so after until the first day of
December yearly from year to year, As they and every of them will answer
the contrary at their uttermost peril.

Given at Wansted the eleventh day of September, in the eleventh year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Exellent
Majesty.
