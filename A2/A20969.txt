Upon thy cors vengeance vengeance they cry
Thou art the cause they may not rest nor ly
Thou sais for them few psaltris psalmis or cred^^
Bot geris me tell their trentalis of mysdedis
And their ald sin with new schame certify
Insensuate sow cesse false Eustase air
And know kene scald I hald of alathya
And cause me not the cause lang to declare
Off thy cursed kyn deulber and his Allya
Cum to the croce on keneis and make a crya
Confess thy crime hald kenydy the king
And with ane hauthorne scurge thy self and dyng
Thus dree thy penance with deliquisti quia
Pas to my conmissare and be co^fest
Cour before him on kneis and cum in will
And syne ger Stobo for thy life protest
Renounce thy rymis bath ban and birn thy bull
Heve to the heuyn thy handis ande hald the still
Do thou not thus bogane thou salbe brynt

On Arthuris sete or on ane hyar hill

Enspirit with Mercury fra his goldyn spear
And dulcely drank of eloquence the fontayne
Quhen it was purifit with frost and flowit clear
And thou come fule in march or februere

Declyne his god / and brek his hye bidding
As haly write beris suthfast witnessing
Thar for thou fro the joy at paradise
And thine offspring was banyst for thy vice
