A Proclamation for restraint of killing, dressing, and eating of Flesh in
Lent, or on Fish-dayes, appointed by the Law, to be hereafter strictly observed
by all sorts of people.
WHereas diverse good Laws and Statutes, have heretofore, with great care and
providence been made and enacted for the due observation of Lent, and other
days appointed for Fish-dayes, as well for the sparing and increase of Flesh
victual, as for the maintenance of the Navy and shipping of this Realm, by
the encouragement of Fishermen to go to the Seas for the taking of Fish, which
Laws and politic Constitutions, have from time to time been seconded and
quickened by sundry Proclamations, and other Acts and Ordinances of State in
the time of Our Royal Predecessors; And whereas, notwithstanding so many good
provisions heretofore had and made in that kind, We have observed, that the
inordinate liberty usually taken by all sorts of people, to kill, dress and
eat Flesh in the Lent season, and on other days and times prohibited, is
become so inueterate an evil, that it will require more then ordinary care to
suppress the same.

We therefore, much affecting the reformation of so great and growing an evil,
which is so great an enemy to the plenty of this Our Kingdom, and so great a
discouragement to Fishermen, who would be the best Seminary of Mariners, Have
thought fit to express Our Self, and Our Royal Commandment in this behalf,
in such a plain and clear way, that there may from henceforth be no pretense
of excuse to any, whereof, without future declaration of Our pleasure in this
kind, We shall expect, and do require from all Our Subjects, that due notice
be taken, and that a strict and continued obedience and conformity be yielded
thereunto, both for the present, and in all succeding times.

And therefore We do straightly charge and command all and every person and
persons whatsoever, to whom it may appertain, carefully to provide and see,
that these Orders following may be duly observed and put in execution, upon
pain of Our high displeasure, and such penalties as by the Laws of this Our
Realm may be inflicted upon the Offenders, for their contempt or neglect of Us
and Our Laws, whereof We shall show Our Self most sensible.

And first, whereas We find, that the chiefest cause of these disorders has
grown from the Licenses that have been granted to Butchers to kill and utter
Flesh contrary to Law, and that by Our Laws, no Mayor, Justice of Peace, or
other person of what degree or quality soever, can grant any License in this
kind; And that the Lords, and others of Our Privy Council, do by Our
direction forbear to grant the same, or give way thereunto; Our will and
pleasure is, upon the penalties provided by Law, and such further punishment to
be inflicted upon the offenders, as shall be thought meet, that no such
License shall be granted for the killing or uttering of Flesh; And, that no
Butcher, or other person whatsoever, do by color thereof, kill, utter, or put
to sale any Flesh contrary to the Laws established and provided in that
behalf.

And for the avoiding of such inconveniences hereafter, Our will and pleasure
is, that the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, and every other Officer and
Justice of Peace, shall call before them, and send for any of the servants of
any Inholders, Victuallers, Cooks, Alehousekeepers, Tauerners, and keepers of
Ordinary tables, and such others that utter Victuals, and to examine them upon
their corporal Oaths, what Flesh is, or has been during the Lent season, or
other days prohibited by the Law, dressed, killed, uttered, or eaten in their
houses, which if they shall refuse to do, then to commit to prison the said
servants so refusing upon their Oaths to declare the truth.

That the Lord Mayor of London shall also yearly before Lent, or at the
beginning thereof, cause all Iuholders, keepers of Ordinary tables, Cooks,
Butchers, Victuallers, Alehouse keepers, and Tauerners within the said City
and Liberties thereof, to appear before him, or such persons as he shall
appoint meet for that purpose; And shall take Recognizances with sufficient
Sureties of every of them in good sums of money, (Viz.) One hundred pounds of
the Principal, and their sureties thirty pounds apiece, to Our use, that the
Butchers shall kill no flesh, and that the other persons before mentioned, do
not dress any Flesh in their houses in the Lent time, or other times
prohibited, for any respect, nor suffer it to be eaten contrary to Law. The
like Recognizance with Sureties, shall be taken of like parties upon like
penalties, by such of the Justices of Peace of Our City of Westminster, and
the Liberties thereof, as We shall thereunto specially appoint, and every of
the said Recognizances to be certified into Our Exchequer.

And for the Butchers, and others that come with Victual or Flesh out of the
Country into the City, Our pleasure is, That the Lord Mayor shall cause
certain persons to watch at the Gates and other like places in the Suburbs,
where Flesh may be brought, to view and search, and to intercept the same: And
if any of those Watchmen shall be found negligent and corrupt in his Charge,
then he to be committed to prison during the whole Lent.

And to the end that Fishermen may employ themselves to Sea with better
encouragement then heretofore, and that the Fishmongers may furnish themselves
with such store from time to time hereafter, as shall be expedient, as well for
the provision of the City, as for selling the same at reasonable rates, We
will that they take notice of this Our commandment and constant resolution for
observance of Lent, and Fish days, both now and hereafter, as by Law is
required.

And furthermore, as We think it fit, that every man should be a rule of order
and abstinence in his own house, as well in respect of the public, as of his
private ease and benefit: So We straightly charge and command all Inholders,
keepers of Ordinary tables, Victuallers, Cooks, Alehousekeepers, and
Tauerners, not to make any Supper for any person or persons whatsoever, upon
Friday nights, either in Lent or out of Lent, nor to suffer any meat to be
then dressed, uttered, sold, or eaten in their houses, upon pain of such
punishment, as is due to those that shall contemn Our Royal pleasure and
Commandment.

And forasmuch as upon further consideration had of this general
inconvenience, which too much liberty has occasioned, We conceive, that the
restraint of killing and dressing of Flesh is no sufficient remedy alone for
these mischiefs, unless there be better care also taken to suppress the
unlawful and inordinate eating of Flesh in the time of Lent, and on other
days and times prohibited, wherewith our Subjects have accustomed themselves,
rather for delicacie then for necessity. It is therefore our Royal with and
pleasure, and accordingly, We do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all Our
Subjects, of what degree or quality soever within this Realm, to eat any
manner of Flesh in the time of Lent, or on other days now usually observed as
Fish days, without a special License first obtained from the Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury, in such manner and form, as by the Act of Parliament made in
the Five and twentieth year of King Henry the eight is ordained, or from the
Bishop of the Diocese, or such other, as by the Law made in the Fifth year of
the reign of Queen Elizabeth is set down and declared, and for such causes
as are there expressed, have power to give Licenses in that behalf, and
according to Our Laws in that case provided, (which We will and command shall
be sparingly granted, and in cases of necessity only. And that such Licenses
and Dispensations be not suffered to pass the Seal of the Archbishop or
Bishop, until the Rate or Tax by the said Statute payable to Us be duly
answered to our Clerk of the Faculties, or to such person or persons as We
under Our Privy Seal shall appoint) upon pain of Our high displeasure, and
to be proceeded against, either according to Our Ecclesiastical or Temporal
Laws, or by Our Attorney General in Our Court of Star Chamber, as
contemners of Our Royal Commandment, and wilful neglectors of the common
vtility of the Kingdom; And upon such further penalties, as by the Laws and
Statutes of Our Realm may be inflicted on those that shall wilfully offend in
this kind.

And as these Orders are to be executed in Our City of London, and places
near to the same, so it is Our express pleasure and Commandment, That Our
Justices of Peace in all Shires within their Rule, and all Majors, Bailifes and
chief Officers in Towns Corporate, or in any Liberties within their
precincts, shall cause the same to be observed and performed in like manner; and
that no manner of Toleration, Favor, or Conniuencie be used by any Justice of
Peace, or other Officer, contrary to the true meaning of this our Proclamation,
as both they that shall presume wittingly so to tolerate the offense, as also
the party himself offending, will answer the same at their uttermost perils;
Our Commandment being, That Our Laws in this case shall be hereafter
severely executed upon all Offenders whatsoever:

Further charging and Commanding the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, the
Justices of Affise in their several Circuits, the Majors and chief Officers
of all other Cities and Towns Corporate, Justices of Peace, Lords of
Liberties, and all other Officers and Ministers within the several Circuits
and places of this Our Realm, that they and every of them in their own
persons, for example to others, fully obey this Our pleasure, and cause and
compel the same to be obeyed and executed by others, as they will answer the
contrary at their uttermost perils.

And for the due execution of the premises in all other the Counties, Cities
and Towns corporate of this Our Realm, as well as in Our Cities of London and
Westminster, We do hereby straightly charge and command, and declare Our will and
pleasure to be, that all Our Justices of Peace within the same Counties, Cities
and Towns corporate, as well within Liberties as without, or such, or so many
of them as We shall thereunto specially appoint, if for Our better service,
now or hereafter We shall see cause to appoint any, do yearly, and every
year before Lent, cause to come and appear before them all Inholders, Cooks,
Tauerners, Alehouse-keepers, Butchers, and other Victuallers whatsoever, and to
require and take of them to Our use, several Recognizances, with Sureties for
observation of the premises, (viz.) The Principals in ten pounds, and their
two Sureties in five pounds a piece: And if they shall refuse or neglect to
enter into such Recognizances, then the Justices of Peace of that County,
City, Town corporate, or Liberty, shall suppress such persons so refusing,
from victualling any more, and shall also cause them forthwith to become bound
by Recognizances with Sureties to Our use, (viz.) The Principals in twenty
pounds, and their two Sureties in ten pounds a piece, not to victual, or
sell Beer or Ale from thenceforth; which if they shall refuse to do, then the
said Justices to commit to prison all such persons so refusing to enter into
such Recognizances, until they shall submit themselves and become bound as
aforesaid. And further, that all such Inholders, Cooks, Tauerners, Alehouse
keepers, Butchers, and other Victuallers, as shall not appear before the said
Justices, as aforesaid, That they may immediately send forth their Warrants, to
grant Process against them, and every of them so making default, to appear
and answer their contempt, at the next general Sessions of the Peace.

And further, for the more due punishment of Inholders, keepers of Ordinary
tables, Cooks, Butchers, Victuallers, Alehouse-keepers, Tauerners, and such
like, who shall forfeit their Recognizances by killing or dressing of Flesh, or
suffering it to be eaten in their houses in the Lent time, and other
Fish-dayes; And to the end that the same may be as well taken in due form of
Law, as duly certified into Our Exchequer, We do will and require the Lord
Mayor of London, and all Justices of Peace, as well within Liberties as without,
respectively, or such of them as We shall thereunto specially appoint, as
aforesaid, That at such times as they shall meet within their several
Precincts or Divisions, for the taking of such Recognizances, they give notice
to the Clerks of the Peace, or their Deputies, or such other Clerks or their
deputies, as We shall thereunto specially appoint, if We shall appoint any,
to attend them for that purpose; Of whom We will require a strict account for
the legal taking and returning of the same Recognizances into Our said
Exchequer; The said Clerks of the Peace and their Deputies, or other Clerks
and their Deputies, so to be employed by Our appointment, as aforesaid, taking
for the making and certifying of the same Recognizances of all Inkeepers,
Tauerners Cooks, and Butchers, the Fee of two shillings six pence; and of all
Alehouse-keepers the Fee of twelve pence, as has been heretofore limited to be
taken by the Clerks of the Peace of the several Counties, in like cases for
every such Recognizance, and no more.

And lastly, for that the Fishmougers (upon the observation of the aforesaid
Orders) may perhaps take occasion thereby to inhance the prices, as well of
Fresh, as of Sea Fish, We do therefore hereby further charge and command all
Fishmongers whatsoever, That they sell and utter their Fish at moderate and
usual rates and prices; And that all Justices of Peace, Majors, Bailiffes, and
other Our Officers, as well within Liberties as without, to whom it shall
appertain, shall from time to time take such order with the said Fishmongers,
that Our Subjects be not grieved by any such inhancement or increase of prices
upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such further punishment as may be
inflicted upon them by Our Laws.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the fourth day of February, in the third
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
