By the King.
A Proclamation for the Authorizing and Uniformity of the Book of Common
Prayer to be used throughout the Realm.
ALthough it cannot be unknown to our Subjects by the former Declarations We
have published, what our purposes and proceedings have been in matters of
Religion since our coming to this Crown: Yet the same being now by Us reduced
to a settled Form, We have occasion to repeat somewhat of that which has
passed; And how at our very first entry into the Realm being entertained and
importuned with Informations of sundry Ministers, complaining of the errors and
impertections of the Church here, as well in matter of Doctrine as of
Discipline; Although We had no reason to presume that things were so far
amiss, as was pretended, because We had seen the Kingdom under that form of
Religion which by Law was established in the days of the late Queen of famous
memory, blessed with a peace and prosperity, both extraordinary and of many
years continuance (a strong evidence that God was therewith well pleased,) Yet
because the importunity of the Complainers was great, their affirmations
vehement, and the zeal wherewith the same did seem to be accompanied, very
specious; We were moved thereby to make it our occasion to discharge that
duty which is the chiefest of all Kingly duties, That is, to settle the
affairs of Religion, and the Service of God before their own. Which while we
were in hand to do, as the Contagion of the sickness reigning in our City of
London and other places would permit an assembly of persons meet for that
purpose; Some of those who misliked the state of Religion here established,
presuming more of our intents then ever We gave them cause to do, and
transported with Humor, began such proceedings as did rather raise a scandal in
the Church, then take offense away. For both they used Forms of public
serving of God not here allowed, held assemblies without Authority, and did
other things carrying a very apparent show of Sedition, more then of Zeal: whom
We restrained by a former Proclamation in the Month of October last, and gave
intimation of the Conference We intended to be had with as much speed as
conveniently could be, for the ordering of those things of the Church, which
accordingly followed in the month of January last at our Honor of Hampton
Court, where before our Self, and our Privy Counsel were assembled many of
the grauest Bishops and Prelates of the Realm, and many other learned men, as
well of those that are conformable to the State of the Church established, as
of those that dissented: Among whom, what Our pains were, what Our patience in
hearing and replying, and what the indifferency and uprightness of our
Judgment in determining, We leave to the report of those who heard the same,
contenting our Self with the sincerity of Our own heart therein. But we
cannot conceal, that the success of that Conference was such as happens to
many other things, which moving great expectation before they be entered into,
in their issue produce small effects. For we found mighty and vehement
Informations supported with so weak and slender proofs, as it appeared unto
Us and our Council, that there was no cause why any Change should have bin at
all in that which was most impugned, the Book of Common Prayer, containing the
form of the public Service of God here established, neither in the doctrine
which appeared to be sincere, nor in the Forms and Rites which were justified
out of the practice of the Primitive Church. Notwithstanding We thought meet,
with consent of the Bishops and other learned men there present, That some
small things might rather be explaned then changed; not that the same might
not very well have been borne with by men who would have made a reasonable
construction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the service of God We
were nice, or rather ielous, that the public form thereof should be free not
only from blame, but from suspicion, so as neither the common Adversary should
have advantage to wrest ought therein contained, to other sense then the Church
of England intends, nor any troublesome or ignorant person of this Church be
able to take the least occasion of cauil against it: And for that purpose gave
forth our Commission under our great Seal of England to the Archbishop of
Canterbury and others, according to the form which the Laws of this Realm in
like case prescribe to be used, to make the said Explanation, and to cause the
whole book of Common Prayer, with the same Explanations, to be newly printed.
Which being now done, and established anew after so serious a deliberation;
Although We doubt not, but all our Subjects, both Ministers and others will
receive the same with such reverence as apperteineth, and conform themselves
thereunto every man in that which him concerns: Yet have We thought it
necessary, to make known by Proclamation Our authorizing of the same, And to
require and enjoin all men, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal, to conform
themselves unto it, and to the practice thereof, as the only Public Form of
serving of God, established and allowed to be in this Realm. And the rather,
for that all the learned men, who were there present, as well of the Bishops as
others, promised their conformity in the practice of it, only making suit to
Us, that some few might be borne with for a time.

Wherefore we require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other public
Ministers as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, to do their duties in causing the
same to be obeyed, and in punishing the offenders according to the Laws of
the Realm heretofore established, for the Authorizing of the said Book of
Common Prayer. And we think it also necessary, that the said Archbishops, and
Bishops, do each of them in his Province and Diocese take order, That every
Parish do procure to themselves within such time as they shall think good to
limit, one of the said Books so explaned. And last of all We do admonish all
men, that hereafter they shall not expect nor attempt any further Alteration in
the Common and Public form of Gods Service, from this which is now
established, for that neither will We give way to any to presume, that Our
own Judgment having determined in a matter of this weight, shall be swayed
to Alteration by the frivolous suggestions of any light spirit: neither are We
ignorant of the inconveniences that do arise in Government, by admitting
innovation in things once settled by mature deliberation: And how necessary it
is to use constancy in the upholding of the public determinations of States,
for that such is the unquietness and unsteadfastness of some dispositions,
affecting every year new forms of things, as, if they should be followed in
their inconstancy, would make all Actions of States ridiculous and
contemptible: whereas the steadfast maintaining of things by good advise
established, is the weal of all Common wealths.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the fifth day of March, in the first year
of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the seven and
thirtieth. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings, most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO 1603.
