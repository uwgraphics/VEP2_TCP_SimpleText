By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, foreseeing the general dearth grown of
corn and other victuals, partly through the unseasonableness of the year
past, whereby want has grown more in some countries then in others, but most
of all generally through the covetousness and uncharitable greediness of
such as be great cornemasters and engrossers of corn, using all the subtle
means they can, to work their own present unconscionable gain against the
rules of charity, which her Majesty of her princely care and love toward her
people, utterly condemns, and earnestly desires to remedy, for the relief
of the poorer sort. And therefore, her Majesty with her princely care toward
her people, having with the advice of her Counsel had good consideration
hereof, does by this her Proclamation, give express commandment and charge
unto al such to whom it shall or may appertain, that such good orders as her
Majesty has commanded to be devised for that purpose, and now also are sent
to all parts of her Realm, be diligently and effectually put in speedy
execution: Signifying withal unto all her good and loving subjects, that if
any shall be found obstinate or negligent in the due execution, or otherwise in
the observation thereof, that then upon due enformation and proof thereof made
unto her highness said Counsel, which she requires not to be spared by any,
having just cause of complaint, for respect of any person, she has given
special commandment and order, that they shall be speedily called to answer,
and thereupon, according to the quality of their offenses, shall receive
sharp punishment, whereby others may take example to avoid the like contempt,
negligence, or other defaults.

And although this Dearth has insundry parts of the Realm first grown by
the visitation of Almighty God, in the alteration of seasonable weather this
last year, which nevertheless of his great mercy has bin so extreme in this
Realm, as in many other Countries adjoining, where the Dearth is by many
occasions manifestly known to be far greater then is in this Realm
hitherto, or by his goodness is like to be: Yet it is manifestly known the
said Dearth to have been wilfully increased in very many places of this Realm,
not only by and through the covetousness of many engrossers of Corn and
Cornemasters, but also by unlawful transportation of Grain, and lack also of
preservation of store in time requisite. Her Highness acknowledging this manner
of Gods mercy and favor in amore favorable measure toward her Country and
her people, then to other fo^rein parts near adjoining, has thought good and
necessary, for a further remedy against the uncharitable covetousness of the
Cornemasters, as cause shall require, to notify, that if such as be the great
Cornemasters and owners of Grain, or of other necessary victual for food of
the poor, shall not be willing, or do not perform these orders, whereby the
poorer sort may be relieved in the markets at reasonable prices, or that it
shall appear that other needful victuals shall by covetousness of any
persons grow to excessive prices, to the pinching of the poorer sort: Then her
Highness does hereby signefie, that she will not only severely punish the
offenders for their cruel covetousness and offentes against her orders, but will
also for redress of the excessive prices of other needful victuals, give
order that reasonable prices shall be set both on Corn and other victuals to
be sold for the relief of her Majesty's poor Subjects, according both to her
Prerogative Royal, and to the order of Justice, as by special law of
Parliament therefore made in the five and twentieth year of the reign of her
late Noble and dear Father King Henry the eight, is specially in such cases
provided.

Given at Greenewich the second day of January, 1586. In the nine and twentieth
year of her Highness reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
