THE PSALMS OF DAVID.

A New Version of the PSALMS, etc.
PSALM I.
1. HAppy the Man whom ill Advice
From Virtue never withdrew,
Who never with Sinners stood, nor ^a^
Amongst the scoffing Crew:
2. But makes the perfect Law of God
His Business and Delight;
Devoutly reads therein by Day,
And meditates by Night.
3. He, like a Tree by Rivers fed,
With timely Fruit shall bend;
His ^eaf shall flourish, and Success
All his Designs attend.
4. Ungodly M^n and their Attempts
No lasting Roo^ shall find;
Untimely blasted and dispersed
Like Cha^f before the Wind.
5. The W^^k^d therefore shall no^ stand
Before their Judge's Face,
Nor Hypocri^es, who passed for Saints,
Amongst the Just take place.
6. God knows the ways of ^ighteous Men,
To Happiness they tend;
But Sinners, and their vain Designs,
Shall both in Ruin end.
PSALM II.
1. WIth restless and ungoverned Rage,
Why do the Heathen storm?
Why in such rash Attempts engage,
As they can never perform?
2. The Great in Counsel and in Might,
Their various Forces bring;
Against the Lord they all unite,
And his anointed King.
3. Must we submit to their Commands?
Puffed up with Pride, they say;
No, let us break their slavish Bands,
And cast their Chains away.
4. But God, who sits enthroned on high,
Who all things wisely guides,
Does their conspiring Strength defy,
Their empty Plots derides.
5. Thick Clouds of Wrath divine shall break
On his rebellious Foes;
And in loud Thunder thus he will speak
To all that dare oppose.
6. In spite of those who thwart my Will,
The King that I approve,
Whose Throne is fixed on Sion's Hill,
Like that, shall never nove.
7. Listen, O Earth, whilst I declare,
God's uncontrolled Decree:
Thou art my Son, this day my Heir
Have I begotten thee.
8. Ask and receive; thy just Commands
The Heathen World shall sway,
The utmost Limits of the Lands
Shall thy dread Will obey.
9. Thy powerful Scepter thou shall shaken
And crush them every where;
As massy Bars of Iron break
The Potter's brittle Ware.
10. Learn then, ye Princes, and give ear,
Ye Judges of the Earth;
11. Worship the Lord with holy Fear,
Rejoice with awful Mirth.
12. Appease the Son with due Respect,
Your humble Homage pay;
Lest he revenge the bold Neglect,
Incensed by your Delay:
13. If but in part his Anger rise,
Who can endure its Flame?
Then blessed are they whose Hope relies
On his most holy Name.
PSALM III.
1. HOW numerous, Lord, of late are grown
The Troublers of my Peace!
And as their Factious Numbers rise,
So does their Rage increase.
2. Insulting, they my Soul upbraid,
And him that I adore;
The God in whom he trusts, say they,
Shall rescue him no more.
3. But thou, O Lord, art my Defense;
On thee my Hopes rely;
Thou art my Glory, and shall yet
Lift up my Head on high.
4. Since, whensoe'er in like Distress
To God I made my Prayer,
He heard me from his holy Hill,
Why should I now despair?
5. Guarded by him, I laid me down
My sweet Repose to take;
For I through him securely sleep,
Through him in safety wake.
6. No Force nor Fury of my Foes
My Courage shall confound,
Were they as many Hosts as Men,
That have beset me round.
7. Arise, and save me, O my God,
Who often have owned my Cause,
And scattered often these Foes to me,
And to thy righteous Laws.
8. Salvation to the Lord belongs,
He only can defend;
His Blessings he extends to all
That on his Power depend.
PSALM IV.
1. O Lord, that art my righteous Judge,
To my Complaint give ear;
Thou still redeem'd'st me from Distress,
Have mercy, Lord and hear.
2. How long will ye, O Sons of Men,
To blot my Fame devise?
How long your vain Designs pursue,
And spread malicious Lies?
3. Consider, that the righteous Man
Is God's peculiar Choice,
And when to God I make my Prayer.
He always hears my Voice.
4. Then stand in aw of his Commands,
Flee every thing that is ill;
Commune in private with your Hearts,
And bend them to his Will.
5. The place of other Sacrifice
Let Righteousness supply;
And let your Hope, securely fixed,
On God alone rely.
6. Whilst wordly Minds impatient grow
More prosperous Times to see,
Still let the Glories of thy Face
Shine brightly, Lord, on me.
7. So shall my Heart overflow with Joy
More lasting and more true,
Than theirs, who stores of Corn and Wine
Successively renew.
8. Then down in peace I Will lay my Head,
And take my needful Rest;
No other Guard, O Lord, I crave,
Of thy Defense possessed.
PSALM V.
1. LOrd, hear the voice of my Complaint,
Accept my secret Prayer;
2. To thee alone, my King my God,
Will I for Help repair.
3. Thou in the Morn my Voice shall hear;
And with the dawning Day
To thee devoutly I Will look up,
To thee devoutly pray.
4. For thou the Wrongs that I sustain
Can never, Lord, approve,
Who from thy sacred Dewlling Place
All Evil do remove.
5. Not long shall hardened Fools remain
Unpunished in thy sight.
All such as act unrighteous things
Thy Vengeance shall requite.
6. The sland'ring Tongue, O God of Truth,
By thee shall be destroyed,
Who hat'st alike the Man in Blood
And in Deceit employed.
7. But when thy boundless Grace shall me
To thy loved Court's restore,
On thee I Will fix my longing Eyes,
And humbly there adore.
8. Conduct me by thy righteous Laws,
For watchful is my Foe:
Therefore, O Lord, make plain the way
Wherein I ought to go.
9. Their Mouth vents nothing but Deceit,
Their Heart is set on Wrong;
Their Throat is a devouring Grave,
They flatter with their Tongue.
10. By their own Counsels let them fall,
Oppressed with Loads of Sin;
For they against thy righteous Laws
Have hardened Rebels been.
11. But let all those who trust in thee,
With Shouts their Joy proclaim;
Let them rejoice whom thou preserv'st,
And all that love thy Name.
12. To righteous Men, the righteous Lord
His Blessings will extend,
And with his Favor, from their Foes,
As with a Shield, defend.
PSALM VI.
1. THY dreadful Anger, Lord, restrain,
And spare a Wretch forlorn;
Correct me not in thy fierce Wrath,
Too heavy to be born.
2. Have Mercy, Lord, my Strength decays,
Unable to endure
The Anguish of my aching Bones,
Which thou alone can cure.
3. My tortured Flesh infects my Mind,
And fills my Soul with Grief;
But, Lord, how long will thou delay
To grant me thy Relief?
4. Thy wonted Goodness, Lord, repeat,
And ease my troubled Soul;
Lord, for thy wondrous Mercy's sake
Vouchsafe to make me whole.
5. For after death no more can I
Thy glorious Acts proclaim;
No Prisoner of the silent Grave
Can magnify thy Name.
6. Quite tired with Pain, with Groaning faint,
No hope of Ease I see;
The Night, that quiets common Griefs,
Is spent in Tears by me.
7. My Beauty fades, my Sight grows dim,
My Eyes with Weakness close;
Old Age o'ertakes me, whilst I think
On my insulting Foes.
8. Depart, ye Wicked, in my Harms
Ye shall no more rejoice;
For God, I find, accepts my Tears,
And listens to my Voice.
9, 10. He hears and grants my humble Prayer,
And they that wish my Fall,
Shall blush and rage, to see that God
Protects me from them all.
PSALM VII.
1. O Lord, my God, as I have placed
My Trust alone in Thee,
From all my Persecutors Rage
Do thou deliver me.
2. Save me from my remorseless Foe,
Lord, interpose thy Power;
Lest, like a salvage Lion, he
My helpless Soul devour.
3, 4. If I am guilty, or did ever
Against his Peace combine;
Nay, if I have not spared his Life,
Who sought unjustly mine;
5. Let then to persecuting Foes
My Soul become a Prey;
Let them to Earth tread down my Life,
In dust my Honor lay.
6. Arise, and let thine Anger, Lord,
In my Defense engage;
Exalt thy self above my Foes,
And their insulting Rage:
Awake, awake in my behalf,
The Judgment to dispense,
Which thou have righteously ordained
For injured Innocence.
7. So to thy Throne adoring Crowds
Shall still for Justice fly!
O! therefore for their ^uff'ring sakes,
Do thou return on high.
8. Impartial Judge of all the World,
I leave my Cause to thee;
O! judge me by thy Righteousness,
And Heart's Integrity.
9. Let Wickedness, and wicked Men,
Together be overthrown;
But fix the Just^ thou God to whom
The Hearts of both are known.
10, 11. God me protects, nor only me,
But all of Upright Heart;
And daily lays up Wrath for those
Who from his Laws depart.
12. If they persist, he whets his Sword,
His Bow stands ready bent;
13. Even now with swift Destruction winged,
His pointed Shafts are sent.
14. Those treacherous Plots my Foe conceived
Abortive are and vain;
15. The Pit he dug has proved a Grave
His Ruins to contain.
16. On his own Head his Spite returns,
Whilst I from Harm am free;
The Violence is fallen on him,
Which he designed for me.
17. Therefore of Providence Divine,
The Justice I Will proclaim;
I Will sing the Praise of God most High,
And celebrate his Name.
PSALM VIII.
1. O Thou to whom all Creatures bow
Within this earthly Frame,
Through all the World how great art Thou!
How glorious is thy Name!
In Heaven thy wondrous Acts are sung,
Nor fully reckoned there;
2. And yet thou make the Infant Tongue
Thy boundless Praise declare:
Through thee the Weak confound the Strong,
And crush their haughty Foes;
And so thou quell'st the wicked Throng
That thee and thine oppose.
3. When Heaven, thy beauteous Work on high,
Employs my wondering Sight;
The Moon, that nightly gilds the Sky,
With Stars of feebler Light;
4. Lord, what is Man that still thou love
To keep him in thy mind!
Or what his Offspring that thou prov'st
To him so wondrous kind!
5. Him next in Power thou did create
To thy celestial Train;
6. Ordained with Dignity and State
Over all thy Works to reign.
7. They jointly own his potent Sway,
The Beasts that prey or graze;
8. The Bird that wings its airy way,
The Fish that cuts the Seas.
9. O Thou, to whom all Creatures bow
Within this earthly Frame,
Through all the World how great art Thou!
How glorious thy Name!
PSALM IX.
1. TO celebrate thy Praise, O Lord,
I will my Heart prepare;
To all the listening World thy Works,
Thy wondrous Works declare.
2. The Thought o^ them shall to my Soul
Exalted Raptures bring;
Whilst to thy Name, O thou most High!
Triumphant Praise I sing.
3. Thou made my haughty Foes to turn
Their backs in shameful Flight;
Struck with thy Presence, down they fell,
They perished at thy sight.
4. Against insulting Foes advanced,
Thou did my Cause maintain;
My right asserting from thy Throne,
Where Truth and Justice reign.
5. The Insolence of Heathen Pride
Thou have reduced to Shame;
Their wicked Offspring quite destroyed,
And blotted out their Name.
6. Mistaken Foes! your Threats and you
Are to a period come:
Our Cities stand, designed by you
Their slaughtered Owners Tomb,
7, 8. The Lord endures, who has on high
His righteous Throne prepared,
Impartial Justice to dispense,
To punish or reward.
9. His Kindness is a sure Defense
Against oppressing Rage;
As Troubles rise, his needful Aids
In our behalf engage.
10. All those who have his Goodness proved,
Will in his Truth confide;
Whose Mercy never ^orsook the Man
That on his Help relied.
11. Sing Praises therefore to the Lord,
From Si^n his abode;
Proclaim his Deeds, till all the World
Confess no other God.
PART II.
12. When he enquiry makes for Blood,
He Will ^^ll their Case to mind;
The injured humble Man's Complaint
Relief from him shall find.
13. Compassion on my Troubles take,
That spiteful Foes create,
Thou that have rescued me so often
From Death's devouring Gate.
14. In Sion then I Will sing thy Praise,
To all that love thy Name;
And with loud Shouts of grateful Joy
Thy saving Power proclaim.
15. Deep in the Pit they dug for me,
The Heathen Pride is laid;
Their guilty Feet to their own Snare
Insensibly betrayed.
16. Thus by the just Returns he makes
The mighty Lord is known;
While wicked Men by their own Plots
Are shamefully overthrown.
17. His injured Saints, when most distressed,
He never forgets to aid;
Their Expectation shall be crowned,
Tho for a time delayed.
18. No single Sinner shall escape
By Privacy obscured;
Nor Nations from his just Revenge
By Numbers be secured.
19. Arise, O Lord, assert thy Power,
And let no Man overcome;
Descend to Judgment, and pronounce
The guilty Heathens Doom.
20. Strike Terror through the Nations round,
Till by consenting Fear,
They, to each other and themselves,
But mortal Men appear.
PSALM X.
1. THY presence why withdraw'st thou, Lord?
Why hid'st thou now thy Face?
When dismal Times of deep Distress
Call for thy wonted Grace.
2. The Wicked swelled with lawless Pride,
The Poor their Prey have made,
O! let them fall by those Designs
Which they for others laid.
3. For strait they triumph, if Success
Their thriving Crimes attend;
And sordid Wretches whom God hates,
In his despite commend.
4. To own a Power above themselves
Their haughty Pride disdains;
And therefore in their stubborn Mind
No thought of God remains.
5. Oppressive Methods they pursue,
And all their Foes they slight;
Because thy Judgments, unobserved,
Are far above their Sight.
6. They fondly think their prosperous State
Shall unmolested be;
They think their vain Designs shall thrive,
From all Misfortunes free.
7. Vain and deceitful is their Speech,
With Curses filled and Lies;
By which the Mischief they intend,
They study to disguise.
8. Near public Roads they lie concealed,
And all their Art employ,
The Innocent and Poor at once
To ri^^e and destroy.
9. Not Lions, couching in their Dens,
Surprise their heedless Prey
With greater Cunning, or express
More salvage Rage than they.
10. Sometimes they act the Harmless Man,
And humble Looks they wear;
That, so deceived, the Poor may less
Their sudden Onset fear.
PART II.
11. For God, they think, no notice takes
Of their unrighteous Deeds;
He never minds the suffering Poor,
Nor their Oppression heeds.
12. But thou, O Lord, at length arise;
Stretch forth thy mighty Arm;
And by the Greatness of thy Power
Defend the Poor from Harm.
13. No longer let the Wicked vaunt,
And proudly boasting say,
Tush, God regards not what we do,
He never will repay.
14. But sure thou saw, and all their Deeds
Impartially do try;
The Orphan therefore and the Poor
On thee for Aid rely.
15. Defenseless let the Wicked fall,
Of all their Strength bereft:
Confound, O God, their dark Designs,
Till no Remains are left.
16. Assert thy just Dominion, Lord,
Which shall for ever stand;
Throug which the Heathen were expelled
From this thy chosen Land.
17. Thy humble Suppliants still thou hear'st,
That to thy Throne repair;
Thou first prepar'st their Hearts to pray,
And then accept'st their Prayer.
18. Thou, in thy righteous Judgment, weigh'st
The Fatherless and Poor;
That so the Tyrants of the Earth
May persecute no more.
PSALM XI.
1. SInce I in God have placed my Trust,
A Refuge always nigh,
Why should I, like a timorous Bird,
To di^tant Mountains fly?
2. Beho^d, the Wicked bend their Bow,
And ready ^ix their Dart:
Lurking in ambush to destroy
The ^an of upright Heart.
3. When once the firm Assurance fails
Which public Faith imparts,
It Is time for ^nnocence to fly
From such deceitful Arts.
4. The Lord has both a Temple here,
And righteous Throne above;
Whence he surveys the Sons of Men,
And how their Counsels move.
5. If God, the Righteous whom he loves
For Trial does correct;
What must the Sons of Violence,
Whom he abhors, expect?
6. Snares, Fire, and Brimstone on their Heads
Shall in one Tempest shower;
This dreadful Mixture his Revenge
Into their Cup shall pour.
7. The righteous Lord will righteous Deeds
With signal Favor grace;
And on the upright Man reflect
The brightness of his Face.
PSALM XII.
1. SInce Godly Men decay, O Lord,
Do thou my Cause defend;
For scarce these wretched times afford
One just and faithful Friend.
2. One Neighbor now can scarce believe
What the other does impart;
With flattering Lips they all deceive,
And with a double Heart.
3. But Lips that with Deceit abound
Can never prosper long;
God's righteous Vengeance will confound
The proud blaspheming Tongue.
4. In v^in those foolish Boasters say,
Our Tongues are sure our own;
With doubtful Words we'll still betray^
And be controlled by none.
5. For God, who hears the Poor oppressed,
And all their Sufferings knows,
Will soon arise and give them rest,
I^ ^pight of all their Foes.
6. The Word of God shall still abide,
And void of Falsehood be:
As is the Silver sev'n times tried
From drossy Mixture free.
7. The Promise of his aiding Grace
Shall reach its purposed End;
His Servants from his faithless Race
He ever shall defend.
8. Then shall the wicked be perplexed,
Nor know which way to fly;
When those whom they despised and vexed
Shall be advanced on high.
PSALM XIII.
1. HOW long will thou forget me, Lord?
Must I for ever mourn?
How long will thou withdraw from me?
Oh! never to return!
2. How long shall anxious Thoughts my Soul,
And Grief my Heart oppress?
How long my Enemies insult,
And I have no Redress?
3. O hear! and to my longing Eyes
Restore thy wonted Light;
wnd suddenly, or I shall sleep
In everlasting Night.
4. Restore me, lest they proudly boast
'Twas their own Strength o'ercame;
Permit not them that vex my Soul
To triumph in my Shame.
5. Since I have always placed my trust
Beneath thy Mercy's Wing,
Thy saving Health will come, and then
My Heart with Joy shall spring,
6. Then shall my Song, with Praise inspired,
To thee my God ascend;
Who to thy Servant in Distress
Such Bounty did extend.
PSALM XIV.
1. SUre wicked Fools must needs suppose
That God is nothing but a Name,
Corrupt and lewd their Practice grows;
No B^east is warmed with holy Flame.
2. The Lord looked down from Heaven's high Tower,
And did the race of Mankind view;
To see if any owned his Power,
If any Truth or Justice knew.
3. But all, he saw, were gone aside,
All were degenerate grown and base;
None took Religion for their guide,
Not one of all the sinful Race.
4. But can these Workers of Deceit
Be all so dull and senseless grown?
That they, like Bread, my People eat,
And God's Almighty Power disown?
5. How will they tremble then for Fear,
When his just Wrath shall them overtake?
For to the righteous, God is near,
And never will their Cause forsake.
6. In vain ungodly Men expose
Those Methods which the Just pursue;
Since God a Refuge is for those
Whom his just Eyes with Favor view.
7. Would he his saving Power employ.
To break his People's servile Band!
Then Shouts of universal Joy
Should loudly echo through the Land.
PSALM XV.
1. LOrd, who is the happy Man that may
To thy blessed Courts repair?
Not, Stranger-like, to visit them,
But to inhabit there?
2. It Is he whose every Thought and Deed
By Rules of Virtue moves;
Whose generous Tongue disdains to speak
The thing his Heart disproves.
3. Who never did a Slander forge
His Neighbor's Fame to wound;
Nor hearkens to a false Report,
By Malice whispered round.
4. Who Vice, in all its Pomp and Power,
Can treat with just Neglect;
And Piety, tho clothed in Rags,
Religiously respect.
Who to his plighted Vows and Trust
Has ever firmly stood;
And tho he promise to his Loss,
He makes the Promise good.
5. Whose Soul in Usury disdains
His Treasure to employ;
Whom no Rewards could ever bribe,
The Guiltless to destroy.
The Man, who, by his steady Course,
Has Happiness ensur'd,
When Earth's Foundations shake, shall stand,
By Providence secured.
PSALM XVI.
1. PRotect me from my cruel Foes,
And shield me, Lord, from Harm;
Because my Trust I still repose
On thy Almighty Arm.
2. My Soul, all Help but thine does slight,
All Gods but thee disown;
Yet can no Deeds of mine requite
The Goodness thou have shown.
3. But those that are of virtuous Note,
Who love the thing that is right,
To favor always and promote
Shall be my chief Delight.
4. How shall their Sorrows be increased,
Who other Gods adore?
Their bloody Offerings I detest,
Their very Names abhor.
7.. My Lot is fallen in the blessed Land
Where God is purely served;
He fills my Cup with liberal hand;
My Right's by him preserved.
6. In Nature's most delightful Scene
My happy Portion lies;
The place of my appointed Reign
All other Lands outvies.
7. Therefore my Soul shall bless the Lord,
Whose Word's my Guide and Light;
Who private Counsel does afford,
In dark Afflictions Night.
8. Nothing, I know, can lie concealed
From his All-seeing Eye;
And my firm Hope has never failed,
Because he still is nigh.
9. Therefore my Heart all Grief defies,
My Glory does rejoice;
My Flesh shall rest, in hope to rise,
Waked by his powerful Voice.
10. Thou, Lord, when I resign my Breath^
My Soul from Hell wilt free;
Nor let thy Holy One in death
The least Corruption see.
11. Thou shall the Paths of Life display,
Which to thy presence lead;
Where Pleasures dwell without allay,
And Joys that never fade.
PSALM XVII.
1. TO my just Plea, my sad Complaint
Attend, O Righteous Lord,
And to my Prayer, as it is unfeigned,
A gracious Ear afford.
2. As in ^hy Presence I Am approved,
So let my Sentence be;
And with impartial Eyes, O Lord,
My upright Dealing see.
3. For thou have proved my Heart by day,
And visited by Night;
And on the strictest Trial found
^ts secret Motions right.
Nor shall thy Justice, Lord, alone
My Heart's Designs acquit;
For I have purposed that my Tongue
Shall no Offense commit.
4. I know, what wicked Men would do,
Their Safety to maintain;
But me thy just and mild Commands
From bloody Paths restrain.
5. That I may still, in spite of Wrongs,
My Innocence secure;
O! Guide me in thy righteous Ways,
And make my Footsteps sure.
6. Since heretofore I never in vain
To thee my Prayer addressed;
O! now, my God, incline thine Ear
To this my just request.
7. The Wonders of thy Love and Care
In my Defense engage,
Thou, whose right Hand preserves thy Saints
From their Oppressors Rage.
PART II.
8, 9. O! keep me in thy tenderest Care,
With sheltering Wings stretched out,
From cruel and oppressing Foes,
That compass me about.
10. O'ergrown with Luxury, enclosed
In their own Fat they lie;
And with a proud blaspheming Mouth
Both God and Man defy.
11. Well, may they boast; for they have now
My Path encompassed round;
Their Eyes at Watch, their Bodies bowed,
And couching to the Ground.
12. In Posture of a Lion set,
When greedy of his Prey;
Or a young Lion, when he lurks
Within a Covert Way.
13. Arise, O Lord, defeat their Plots,
Their swelling Rage control;
From the ungodly Man, thy Sword,
Deliver thou my Soul.
14. From worldly Men, thy sharpest Scourge,
Whose Portion's here below;
Who, filled with earthly Stores, aspire
No other Bliss to know;
15. Pleased with a numerous Race, to share
Their Substance while they live;
Successive Heirs, to whom they may
The vast Remainder give.
16. But, Lord, for me, I only crave
The Treasure of thy Grace?
And waking in my Soul to find
The ^mage of thy Face.
PSALM XVIII.
1, 2. NO Change of Times shall ever shock
My firm Affection, Lord, to thee?
For thou have always been a Rock,
A Fortress and Defense to me.
Thou my Deliv'rer art, my God;
My Trust is in thy mighty Power;
Thou art my Shield from Foes abroad,
At home my Safeguard and my Tower.
3. To thee I Will still address my Prayer,
(To whom all Praise we justly owe;)
So shall I, by thy watchful Care,
Be guarded from my Treacherous Foe.
4, 5. By Floods of wicked Men distressed,
With deadly Sorrows compassed round,
With dire infernal Pangs oppressed,
In Death's unwieldy Fetters bound.
6. To Heaven I made my mournful Prayer,
To God addressed my humble Moan;
Who graciously inclined his Ear,
And heard me from his lofty Throne.
PART II.
7. When God arose to take my part,
The trembling Earth did quake for fear;
From their firm Posts the Hills did start,
Nor durst his dreadful Fury bear.
8. Thick Clouds of Smoke dispersed abroad,
Ensigns of Wrath, before him came;
Devouring Fire around him glowed,
That Coals were kindled at its Flame.
9. He left the beauteous Realms of Light,
Whilst Heaven bowed down its awful head;
Beneath his feet, substantial Night
Was, like a sable Carpet, spread.
10. The Chariot of the King of Kings,
Which Troops of harnessed Ang^ls drew,
On a strong Tempest's rapid Wings
With most amazing Swiftness flew.
11, 12. Black watery Mists and Clouds conspired
With thickest Shades his Face to veil;
But at his Brightness soon retired,
And fell in showers of Fire and Hail.
13. Through Heaven's wide Arch a thundering Peal,
God's angry Voice did loudly roar;
While Earth's sad Face, with heaps of Hail
And flakes of Fire, was covered over.
14. His sharpened Arrows round he threw,
Which made his scattered Foes retreat;
Like Darts, his nimble Lightenings ^lew,
And quickly finished their Defeat.
15. The Deep its secret Stores disclosed;
The World's Foundations naked lay;
By his avenging Wrath exposed,
Which fiercely raged, that dreadful Day.
PART III.
16. The Lord did on my side engage,
From Heaven (his Throne) my Cause upheld;
And snatched me from the furious Rage
Of threatening Waves that proudly swelled.
17. God his resistless Power employed,
My strongest Foes Attempts to break;
Who else with ease had soon destroyed
The Weak defense that I could make.
18. Their subtle Rage had near prevailed,
When I distressed and friendless lay;
But still when other Succors failed,
God was my firm Support and Stay.
19. From Dangers that enclosed me round,
He brought me forth, and set me free;
For some just cause his Goodness found,
That moved him to delight in me.
20. Because in me no Guilt remains,
God does his gracious Help extend;
My Hands are free from bloody Stains,
Therefore the Lord is still my Friend.
21, 22. For I his Judgments kept in sight;
In his just Ways I always trod;
I never did his Statutes slight,
Nor vainly wandered from my God.
23, 24. But still my Soul sincere and pure,
Did even from darling Sins refrain;
His Favors therefore yet endure,
Because my Heart and Hands are clean.
PART IV.
25, 26. Thou suit'st, O Lord, thy righteous Ways
To various Paths of Human-kind;
They who for Mercy merit Praise,
With thee shall wondrous Mercy find.
Thou to the Just shall Justice show.
The Pure thy Purity shall see;
Such as perversely choose to go,
Shall meet perverse Returns from Thee.
27, 28. That he the humble Soul will save,
And crush the Haughty's boasted Might.
In me the Lord an Instance gave,
Whose Darkness he has turned to Light.
29. On his firm Succor I relied,
And did over numerous Foes prevail;
Nor feared, whilst he was on my side,
The best defended Walls to scale.
30. For Gods Designs shall still succeed;
His Word will bear the strictest Test:
He Is a strong Shield to all that need,
And on his sure Protection rest.
31. Who then deserves to be adored,
But God, on whom my Hopes depend?
Or who, except the mighty Lord,
Can with resistless Power defend?
PART V.
32, 33. It Is God that girds my Armor on,
And all my just Designs ful^ills;
Through him my Feet can swiftly run,
And nimbly climb the steepest Hills.
34. Lessons of War from him I take,
And manly Weapons learn to wield;
Strong Bows of Steel with ease I break,
Forced, by my stronger Arms, to yield.
35. The Buckler of his Saving Health
Protects me from assaulting Foes;
His Hand sustains me still; my Wealth
And Greatness from his Bounty flows.
36. My Goings he enlarged abroad,
Till then to narrow Paths confined;
And when in slippery ways ^ trod,
The Method of my Steps designed.
37. Through him I numerous Foes defeat,
And flying Squadrons captive make;
Nor from my fierce Pursuit retreat,
Till full Revenge of all I take.
38. Covered with Wounds, in vain they try
Their vanquished Heads again to rear;
Spite of their boasted Strength they lie
Beneath my Feet, and grovel there.
39. God^ when fierce Armies take the field,
Recruits my Strength, my Courage warms;
He makes my strong Opposers yield,
Subdued by my prevailing Arms.
40. Through him the Necks of prostrate Foes
My conquering Feet in Triumph press;
Aided by him, I root out those
Who hate and envy my Success.
41. With loud Complaints all Friends they tried,
But none was able to defend;
At length to God for Succor cried,
But God would no Assistance lend.
42. Like flying Dust which Winds pursue,
Their broken Troops were scattered round:
Their baffled Numbers forth I threw,
Like loathsome Dust that clogs the Ground.
PART VI.
43. Our Factious Tribes, at Strife till now,
At God's Appointment me obey;
The Heathen to my Scepter bow,
And Foreign Nations own my Sway.
44. Remotest Realms their Homage send,
When my successful Name they hear;
Strangers for my Commands attend,
Charmed with Respect, or awed by Fear.
45. All to my Summons tamely yield,
Or soon in Battle are dismayed;
For stronger holds they quit the Field,
And still in strongest Holds afraid.
46. Let the Eternal Lord be praised!
The Rock on whose Defense I rest;
Over highest Heavens his Name be raised,
Who me with his Salvation blessed!
47. It Is God that still supports my Right,
His just Revenge my Foes pursues;
It Is he, that with resistless Might,
Fierce Nations to my Yoke subdues,
48. My universal Safeguard, He!
From whom my lasting Honors flow^
He made me Great, and set me free
From my remorseless bloody Foe.
49. Therefore to celebrate his Fame,
My grateful Voice to Heaven I Will raise^
And Nations, Strangers to his Name,
Shall thus be taught to sing his Praise;
50. God to his King Deliverance sends;
Shows his Anointed signal Grace?
His Mercy evermore extends
To David, and his promised Race.
PSALM XIX.
1. THE Heavens declare thy Glory, Lord
Which that alone can fill;
The Firmament and Stars express
Their great Creator's Skill.
2. Revolving Days, with every Dawn,
Fresh Beams of Knowledge bring;
From darkest Nights successive Rounds
Divine Instructions spring.
3. Their powerful Language to no Realm
Or Region is confined;
It Is Nature's Voice, and understood
Alike by all Mankind.
4. Their Doctrines sacred Sense itself
Through Earth's extent displays;
Whose bright Contents the circ'ling Sun
Around the World conveys.
5. No Bridegroom, for his Nuptials dressed,
Has such a cheerful Face;
No Giant does like him rejoice,
To run his glorious Race.
6. From East to West from West to East,
His restless Circuit goes;
And through his Progress cheerful Light
And vital Warmth bestows.
PART II.
7. God's perfect Law converts the Soul,
Reclaims from false Desires;
With sacred Wisdom his sure Word
The Ignorant inspires.
8. The Statutes of the Lord are just,
And bring sincere Delight;
His pure Commands, in search of Truth,
Assist the feeblest Sight.
9. His Fear is clean, his Worship fixed
For ever to abide;
His equal Judgments in the scale
Of Truth and Justice tried.
10. Of more esteem than Golden Mines,
Or Gold refined with skill;
More sweet than Honey, or the Drops
That from the Comb distill.
11. My trusty Counselors they are,
And friendly Warnings give:
Divine Rewards attend on those
Who by thy Precepts live.
12. But what frail Man observes, how of^
He does from Virtue fall?
O cleanse me from my secret Faults,
Thou God who know them all.
13. Let no presumptuous Sin, O Lord,
Dominion have over me;
That by thy Grace preserved, I may
The great Trangression flee,
14. So shall my Prayer and Praises be
With thy Acceptance blessed;
And I, secure, on thy Defense,
My Strength and Savior, rest.
PSALM XX.
1. THE Lord to thy Request attend,
And hear thee in Distress;
The Name of Jacob's God defend,
And grant thy Arms Success.
2. To aid thee from on high repair,
And Strength from Sion give;
Remember all thy Offerings there,
Thy Sacrifice receive.
3. To compass thy own Heart's Desire
Thy Counsels still direct;
Make kindly all Events conspire
To bring them to effect.
4. To thy Salvation, Lord, for Aid
We'll cheerfully repair,
With Banners in thy Name displayed:
The Lord accept thy Prayer.
5. Our Hopes are now confirmed, the Lord
Will by our Sovereign stand;
From Heaven the saving Strength afford
Of his resistless Hand.
6. Some trust in Steeds for War designed,
On Chariots some rely;
Against them all, we'll call to mind
The Name of God most High.
7. But from their Steeds and Chariots thrown,
Behold them through the Plain,
Disordered, broke, and trampled down,
Whilst firm our Troops remain.
8. Still save us, Lord, and still proceed
Our rightful Cause to bless;
Hear, King of Heaven, in times of need
The Prayers that we address.
PSALM XXI.
1. THE King, O Lord, with Songs of Praise
Shall in thy Strength rejoice;
With thy Salvation glad shall raise
To Heaven his cheerful Voice,
2. For thou whate'r his Lips request
Not only did impart,
But have with thy Acceptance blessed
The Wishes of his Heart.
3. Thy Goodness and thy tender Care
Have even his Hopes out-gone;
A Crown of Gold thou make him wear
And sett'st it firmly on.
4. He prayed for Life, and thou, O Lord,
Did his short span extend;
And graciously to him afford
A Life that never shall end.
5. Thy sure Defense to Nations round
Has spread his glorious Name;
And his successful Actions crowned
With Majesty and Fame.
6. Eternal Blessings thou bestow'st,
And make his Joy increase,
Whilst thou to him unclouded show'st
The Brightnes^ of thy ^ace.
PART II.
7. Because the King on God alone
For timely Aid relies,
His Mercy still supports his Throne,
And all his Needs supplies.
8. But, righteous Lord, thy stubborn Foes
Shall feel thy heavy Hand;
Thy vengeful Arm shall find out those
That hate thy mild Command.
9. When thou against them do engage,
Thy just but dreadful Doom
Shall like a glowing Oven's Rage,
Their Hopes and them consume.
10. Nor shall thy furious Anger cease,
Or with their Ruin end;
But ravage all their guilty Race,
And to their Seed descend.
11. For all their Thoughts were set on ill,
Their Hearts on Malice bent,
(Though thou with watchful care did still
The ill Effects prevent.)
12. In vain by shameful flight they will try
To escape thy dreaded Might;
While thy swift Darts shall fa^ter fly,
And gaul them in their Flight.
13. Thus, Lord, thy wondrous Strength disclose,
And thus exalt thy Name;
Whilst we loud Songs of Joy compose,
And make thy Power the Theme.
PSALM XXII.
1. MY God, my God, why leave thou me
When I with Anguish faint?
O why so far from me removed,
And from my loud Complaint.
2. All day, but all the day unheard,
To thee do I complain;
With Cries implore Relief all night,
But cry all night in vain.
3. But thou art still the righteous Judge
Of Innocence oppressed,
And therefore Israel's Praises are
Of right to Thee addressed.
4, 5. On Thee our Ancestors relied,
And thy Deliverance found;
With pious Confidence they prayed
And with Success were crowned.
6. But I am treated as a Worm,
Like none of Woman born:
Not only by the Great reviled,
But made the Rabble's Scorn.
7. With Laughter all the gazing Crowd
My Agonies survey.
They shoot the Lip, they shake the Head,
And thus, deriding, say,
8. In God he trusted, boasting often
That he was Heaven's Delight;
Let God come down to own him now,
And save his Favorite.
PART II.
9. Thou made my teeming Mother's Womb
A living Offspring bear;
When but a Suckling at the Breast,
I was the Almighty's Care.
10. My Guardian thou did shield from Wrongs
My helpless Infant days;
Up from my Birth my God and Guide,
Through Life's bewildered ways.
11. Withdraw not then so far from me
When Trouble is so nigh:
O send me Help! thy Help, on which
I only can rely.
12. High pampered Bulls, a frowning Herd,
From Basan Forests met,
With Strength proportioned to their Rage,
Have me around beset.
13. They gape on me and every Mouth
A yawning Grave appears;
The rav'ning Lion's loudest Roar
Less dreadful is than theirs.
PART III.
14. My Blood like Water's spilled, my Joints
Distorted out of Frame;
My Heart dissolves within my Breast,
Like Wax before the Flame^
15. My Strength like Potter's Earth is parched,
My thirsty Tongue and Breath
From Plaints restrained; my Life reduced
Even to the Gates of Death.
16. Like Blood hounds to surround me, they
In packed Assemblies meet;
They pierced my inoffensive Hands,
They pierced my harmless Feet.
17. My Body's racked till all my Bones
Distinctly may be told:
Yet such a Spectacle of Woe
As Pastime they behold.
18. As Spoil my Garments they divide,
Lots for my Vesture cast;
Therefore approach, O Lord, my Strength,
And to my Succor haste.
20. Deliver from their Sword my Soul,
(Of all but Life bereft!)
Nor let my Darling in the Power
Of cruel Dogs be left.
21. Retrieve me from the Lion's Jaws
As from the brandished Horns
Thou rescued'st me, and from the Hoofs
Of trampling Unicorns.
22. Then to my Brethren I Will declare
The Triumphs of thy Name,
In Presence of assembled Saints
Thy Glory thus proclaim,
23. Ye Worshippers of Jacob's God,
All you of Israel's Line,
O praise the Lord, and to your Praise
Sincere Obedience join.
24. He never disdained on low Distress
To cast a gracious Eye;
Nor turned from Poverty his Face,
But hears its humble Cry.
Part IV.
25. Thus in thy Courts Religious Throng
My Thanks I will express,
In presence of thy Saints perform
The Vows of my Distress.
26. The Meek Companions of my Grief
Shall find my Table spread,
And all that seek the Lord shall be
With Joys immortal fed.
27. Then shall the Universe, convinced,
To God their Homage pay;
And scattered Nations of the Earth
One Sovereign Lord obey.
28. It Is his supreme Prerogative
Over Subject-Kings to reign,
It Is just that he should rule the World,
Who does the World sustain
29. The Rich, who are with Plenty fed,
His Bounty must confess;
The Sons of Want, by him relieved,
Their generous Patron bless.
With humble Worship, to his Throne
They all for Aid resort
That Power which first their Beings gave,
Can only them support.
30, 31. Then shall a chosen spotless Race
Devoted to his Name,
To their admiring Heirs his Truth
And glorious Acts proclaim.
PSALM XXIII.
1. SInce God does me, his worthless Charge,
Protect with tender Care,
As watchful Shepherds guard their Flocks,
What can I want or fear?
2. In shady Pastures fresh and green
He makes me feed and lie;
Then leads me on to silver Streams,
That gently murmur by.
3. My wandering Soul, by him restored,
To his immortal Praise,
He taught with humble Zeal to walk
In his most righteous ways.
4. Tho through Death's gloomy Vale I march,
Yet safe and undismaid;
His Presence cheers, his Rod and Staff
Afford me constant Aid.
5. By him, in sight of all my Foes,
My Table's richly spread,
My Cup overflows with generous Wine,
With precious Oils my Head.
6. Since God thus shows his wondrous Love
Through all my Life's extent,
My time to come shall, in his House,
In Prayer and Praise be spent.
PSALM XXIV.
1. THis spacious Earth is all the Lord's,
The Lord's her Fullness is;
The World and its Inhabitants
By sovereign Right are his.
2. He framed and fixed it on the Seas,
And with Almighty Hand
Upon inconstant Floods he made
Her stable Fabric stand.
3. But for himself this Lord of All
One chosen Seat designed;
O who shall to that Sacred Hill
Deserved Admittance find?
4. The Man whose Hands and Heart are pure,
Whose Thoughts were never vain,
Had rather live despised and poor,
Than thrive ^y perjured Gain.
5. This, this is He on whom the Lord
Shall shower his Blessings down,
Whom God his Savior shall vouchsafe
With Righteousness to crown^
6. Such is the Race of Saints, by whom
Thy sacred Courts are trod;
And such the Proselytes that seek
The face of Jacob's God.
7. Erect your Heads, eternal Gates,
Unfold, to entertain
The King of Glory: see he comes
With his celes^ial Train.
8. Who is this King of Glory? who?
The Lord for Strength renowned,
In Battle mighty, over his Foes
Eternal Victor crowned.
9. Erect your Heads, ye Gates, unfold
In state to entertain
The King of Glory: see he comes
With all his shining Train.
10. Who is this King of Glory? who?
The Lord of Hosts renowned:
Of Glory He alone is King,
Who is with Glory crowned.
PSALM XXV.
1, 2. TO thee, the God in whom I trust
I li^t my Heart and Voice;
O let me not be put to shame,
Nor let my Foes rejoice.
3. Those who on Thee for Succor wait
Let no Disgrace attend.
Be that the shameful Lot of such
As wilfully offend.
4, 5. Thy Paths disclose, thy Truth impart
And lead me in thy way,
For thou art he that brings me Help,
On Thee I wait all day.
6. Thy Mercies and thy tender Love,
O Lord, recall to mind,
And graciously continue still,
As thou were ever kind.
7. Let all my early youthful Crimes
Be blotted out by thee;
And for thy wondrous Goodness sake
In Mercy think on me.
8. His Mercy and his Justice both
The righteous Lord displays,
In bringing wandering Sinners home
And teaching them his ways.
9. All those in Judgment shall he guide
Who his Direction seek;
And in his sacred Paths shall lead
The humble and the meek.
10. Through all the equal ways of God
Both Truth and Mercy shine,
Toward them, that with religious Hearts
To his blessed Will incline.
PART II.
11. Since Mercy is thy darling Grace,
And most exalts thy Fame,
Forgive my heinous Sin, O Lord,
And so advance thy Name.
12. Whoever to God with holy Fear
His humble Duty pays,
Shall find the Lord a faithful Guide
In all his righteous Ways.
13. His quiet Soul with inward Peace
Shall be for ever blessed,
And by his numerous Race the Land
Successively possessed.
14. For God to such as fear his Name,
His secret Will imparts,
And does his gracious Covenant write
In their obedient Hearts.
15. To him I still will lift my Eyes,
And wait his timely Aid,
Who breaks the strong and treacherous snare
Which for my Feet was laid.
16. O turn again, and all my Griefs
In mercy, Lord, redress;
For I am compassed round with Woes,
And plunged in deep Distress.
17. The Sorrows of my pensive Heart
To mighty Sums increase;
O from this dark and dismal state
My troubled Soul release!
18. With tender Eyes and pitying Looks
My sad Afflictions see;
Acquit me, Lord, and from my Guilt,
Entirely set me free.
19. Consider, Lord, my cruel Foes,
How fast their Numbers grow!
What lawless Force and Rage they use,
What boundless Hate they show!
20. O guard my life, and set my Soul
From their fierce Malice free;
Nor let me, Lord, be shamed, who place
My steadfast Trust in thee.
21. Let all my just and righteous Acts
To full Perfection rise,
Because my firm and constant Hope
On thee alone relies.
12. To Israel, Lord, thy chosen Race,
Continue ever kind;
And in the midst of all their Wants
Let them thy Succor find.
PSALM XXVI.
1. JUdge me, O Lord, for I the Paths
Of Righteousness have trod;
I cannot fail, who all my Trust
Repose on thee, my God.
2, 3. Search, prove my Heart, whose Innocence
Will shine the more it is tried;
For I have kept thy Grace in view,
Thy Truth my constant Guide.
4. I never for Companions took
The Idle or Profane,
No Hypocrite with all his Arts
My Friendship ever could gain.
5. I hate the Factious Plotting Crew
Who make distracted Times.
No more would share their Company,
Than I Would partake their Crimes.
6. I Will wash my Hands in Innocence;
And bring a Heart so pure
As shall when I approach thy Courts,
My Welcome there secure.
7, 8. My Thanks I Will publish there and tell
How thy Renown excels:
That Seat affords me most Delight,
In which thy Honor dwells.
9. Involve me not in Sinners doom,
Who Murder make their Trade;
10. Who other's Rights by secret Bribes,
Or open Force invade.
11. But I will walk in Paths of Truth,
Integrity pursue;
Protect me therefore, and on me
Thy Mercies, Lord, renew.
12. In spite of all my Foes Attacks
I still maintain my ground:
And shall survive, amongst thy Saints.
Thy Praises to resound.
PSALM XXVII.
1. WHom should I fear, since God to me
Salvation is and Light?
Since strongly he my Life supports,
What can my Soul affright?
2. With ravenous Aims, my Flesh to tear
When Foes beset me round,
They stumbled, and their lofty Crests
Were made to strike the Ground.
3. Through him my Heart, undaunted, dares
With numerous Hosts to cope;
Through him, in dangerous Straits of War,
For good Success I hope.
4. Henceforth within his House to dwell
I earnestly desire,
His wondrous Beauty there to view,
And his blessed Will enquire.
5. For there may I with Comfort rest,
In times of deep Distress,
And safe as on a Rock abide
In that secure recess.
6. Whil^t God above my haughty Foes
My lofty Head shall raise,
And I my joyful Offering bring,
And sing glad Songs of Praise
PART II.
7. Continue, Lord, to hear my Voice,
Whenever to thee I cry;
In mercy all my Prayers receive,
Nor my Request deny.
8. When thou to seek thy glorious Face
Do graciously advise,
Thy glorious Face I Will always seek,
My grateful Heart replies.
9. Then hide not thou thy Face, O Lord,
Nor me in Wrath reject;
My God and Savior, leave not him
Thou did^t so often protect.
10. Tho all my Friends and nearest Kin
Their helpless Charge forsake,
Yet thou, whose Love excels them all,
Wilt Care and Pity take.
11. Instruct me in thy ways, O Lord,
My Goings plainly guide,
Lest envious Men, who watch my steps,
Should see me tread aside:
12. Defeat, O Lord, my cruel Foes,
And thwart their ill Desire,
Whose lying Lips and bloody Hands
Against my Peace conspire.
13. I trusted that my future Life
Should with thy Love be crowned,
Or else my fainting Soul had sunk
With Sorrows compassed round.
14. With patient Faith expect God's time,
And he will inspire thy Breast
With inward Strength; do thus thy part.
And leave to him the rest.
PSALM XXVIII.
1. O Lord, my Rock, to Thee I cry^
In Sighs consume my Breath:
O answer, or I shall become
Like those that sleep in Death.
2. Regard my Supplication, Lord
The Cries that I repeat,
With weeping Eyes, and Hands stretched o^^
Before thy Mercy-seat,
3. Involve me not in Sinners doom,
Who make a Trade of Ill,
And ever speak the Person fair,
Whose Blood they mean to spill.
4. According to their Crimes extent
Let Justice have its Course;
Relentless be to them, as they
Have sinned without Remorse.
5. Since they the Works of God despise,
Nor would his Grace adore,
His Wrath shall utterly destroy,
And build them up no more.
6. But I, with due Acknowledgment,
His Praises will resound,
From whom the Cries of my Distress
A gracious Answer found.
7. My Heard reposed its Confidence
In God, my Strength and Shield,
In him I trusted, and returned
Triumphant from the Field.
As he has made my Joys complete,
It Is just that I should raise
The cheerful Tribute of my Thanks,
And thus resound his Praise.
8. His aiding Power supports the Troops
That my just cause maintain;
'Twas he advanced me to the Throne,
It Is he secures my Reign.
9. Preserve thy chosen, and proceed
Thine Heritage to bless;
With Plenty prosper them, in Peace;
In Battle, with Success.
PSALM XXIX.
1. YE Princes that in Might excel,
Devout Oblations strait prepare;
God's glorious Actions loudly tell,
To all his wondrous power declare^
2. To his great Name fresh Altars raise,
And due Respect with Care afford;
Him in his holy Temple praise,
Where he is with solemn State adored.
3. It Is he that with amazing Noise
The watery Clouds in sunder brake;
The Ocean trembled at his Voice,
When he from Heaven in Thund^r spoke.
4, 5. How full of Power his Voice appears!
With what majestic Horror crowned!
Which from their Roots tall Cedars tears,
And strews their scattered Branches round!
6. They, and the Hills on which they grow,
Are sometimes hurried far away;
And leap, like Hinds that bounding go,
Or Unicorns in youthful play.
7, 8. When God in Thunder loudly speaks,
And scattered Flames of Lightning sends,
The Forest nods, the Desert quakes,
And stubborn Kadesh lowly bends.
9. He aids the Hinds with Pangs oppressed,
And lays the Beasts dark Coverts bare,
Whil^t those that in his Temple rest,
Securely sing his Praises there.
10, 11. God rules the angry Floods on high;
His boundless Sway shall never cease;
His People he will with Strength supply,
And bless his own with constant Peace.
PSALM XXX.
1. I Will celebrate thy Praises, Lord,
Who did thy Power employ
To lift my drooping Head above
My Foes insulting Joy.
2, 3. To Thee I cried in my Distress,
Who kindly did relieve,
And from the Grave's expecting Jaws
My hopeless Life retrieve.
4. Thus to his Courts ye Saints of his
With Songs of Praise repair,
With me commemorate his Truth,
And providential Care.
5. His Wrath has but a Moment's reign,
His Favor no Decay:
Your Night of Grief is recompensed
With Joy's returning Day.
6. But I in prosperous days presumed,
No Revolution feared,
Whilst in my Sunshine of Success
No lowering Cloud appeared.
7. But soon perceived thy Favor, Lord,
My Empire's strongest Trust;
Thou hidd'st thy Face, and strait I found
My Honor laid in Dust.
8. Then, as I vainly had presumed,
My Error I confessed,
And thus, with supplicating Voice,
Thy Mercy's Throne addressed.
9. What Profit is there in my Blood,
Congealed by Death's cold Night?
Can silent Ashes speak thy Praise,
Thy wondrous Truth recite?
10. Hear me, O Lord, in Mercy hear,
Thy wonted Aid extend;
Be thou my Helper, on whose Help
I only can depend.
11. It Is done! Thou have my mournful Scene.
To Songs and Dances turned;
In Robes of State invested me,
Who late in Sackcloth mourned.
12. My Glory therefore shall proclaim
Thy Praise in grateful Verse;
And, as thy Favors endless are,
Thy endless Praise rehearse.
PSALM XXXI.
1. DEfend me, Lord, from Shame,
For still I trust in Thee;
As ^ust and Righteous is thy Name,
From Danger set me free.
2. Bow down thy gracious Ear,
And speedy Succor send;
Do thou my steadfast Rock appear,
To rescue and defend.
3. Since Thou, when Foes oppress,
My Rock and Fortress art,
To guide me forth from this Distress
Thy usual Help impart.
4. Release me from the Snare
Which they have closely laid,
Since I, O God my Strength, repair
To thee alone for Aid.
5. To Thee, the God of Truth,
My Life, and all that is mine,
(For thou preserv'dst me from my Youth)
I willingly resign.
6. All vain Designs I hate,
Of those that trust in ^^es;
Whilst my firm Hope, in every state,
On God alone relies.
PART II.
7. The Mercies thou have shown
I Will cheerfully express;
For thou have viewed my Straits, and known
My Soul in deep Distress.
8. When Keilah's treacherous Race
Did all my Strength enclose,
Thou gav'st my Feet a larger space
To shun my watchful Foes.
9. Thy Mercy, Lord, display,
Redress my just Complaint;
For both my Heart and Flesh decay,
With Grief and Hunger faint.
10. Sad Thoughts my Life oppress,
My Years are spent in Groans,
My Sins have made my Strength grow less,
And even consumed my Bones.
11. My Foes insulting mocked,
My Neighbors did upbraid;
My Friends at sight of me were shocked,
And fled as Men dismayed.
12. By all I am forgot,
As dead, and out of mind;
And hopeless as a shattered Pot,
Whose Parts can never be joined.
13. With sland'rous Tongues they speak,
And seem my Power to dread,
Whilst they together Counsel take
My guiltless Blood to shed.
14. But still my steadfast Trust,
I on thy Help repose;
That thou, my God, art good and just,
My Heart with Comfort knows.
PART III.
15. Whatever Events betide
Thy Wisdom times them all;
Then, Lord, thy Servant safely hide
From those that seek his Fall.
16. The Brightness of thy Face
To me, O Lord, disclose;
And, as thy Mercies still increase,
Preserve me from my Foes,
17. Let me no Shame receive,
Who still have called on Thee;
Let That and Silence in the Grave,
The Sinner's Portion be.
18. Do thou their Tongues restrain,
Whose Breath in Lies is spent;
Who false Reports, with proud Disdain,
Against the Righteous vent.
19. How great thy Mercies are
To such as fear thy Name!
Which thou, for those that trust thy Care,
Do to the World proclaim.
20. Thou shrowd'st them in thy Sight
From Man's defeated Pride;
From Tongues that do in Strife delight
Thou do them safely hide.
21. With Glory and Renown
God's Name be ever blessed;
Whose Love in Keilah's well-fenc'd Town
Was wond'rously expressed!
22. I said, in hasty Flight,
"I Am banished from thine Eyes
Yet still thou kept'st me in thy Sight,
And heard'st my earnest Cries.
23. Let holy Men the Lord
With eager Love pursue,
Who to the Just will Help afford,
And give the Proud their due.
24. All that on God rely
Courageously proceed
For he will still your Hearts supply
With Strength in time of need.
PSALM XXXII.
1. THrice blessed, whose Sins have Pardon gained
No more in Judgment to appear;
2. Whose Guilt Remission has obtained,
And whose Repentance is sincere.
3. Whilst I concealed the fretting Sore,
My Bones consumed without Relief;
All day with Anguish I did roar,
But no Complaints asswag'd my Grief.
4. Heavy on me thy Hand remained,
By Day and Night alike distressed,
Till quite of vital Moisture drained,
Like Land with Summer's drought oppressed.
5. No sooner I my Wound disclosed,
The Guilt that tortured me within,
But thy Forgiveness interposed,
And Mercy's healing Balm poured in.
6. True Penitents shall thus succeed,
Who seek Thee whilst thou may be found,
From Danger's common Deluge freed,
See the lewd World about 'em drowned.
7. Thy Favor, Lord, in last Distress,
My Tower of Refuge I must own,
Thou shall my haughty Foes suppress,
And me with Songs of Triumph Crown.
8. To my Instruction then confide,
You that would Truth's safe Path descry,
Your Progress, I Will securely guide,
And keep you in my watchful Eye.
9. Submit your selves to Wisdom's Rule,
Like Men that Reason have attained;
Not like the ungoverned Horse and Mule,
Whose Fury must be Curbed and Rein'd.
10. Sorrows on Sorrows multiplied
Obdurate Sinners shall confound,
But them who in his Truth confide
Blessings of Mercy shall surround.
11. His Saints that have performed his Law^
Their Life in Triumphs shall employ:
Let then (as such alone have cause)
The Heart that is Upright shout for Joy.
PSALM XXXIII.
1. LEt all the Just to God with Joy
Their cheerful Voices raise,
For well the Righteous it becomes
To sing glad Songs of Praise.
2, 3. Let Harps, and Psalteries, and Lutes,
Be in one Consort met,
And new-made Songs of loud Applaus^
To skilful Notes be set.
4, 5. For faithful is the Word of God,
His Works with Truth abound;
He Justice loves, and over the Earth
Distills his Goodness round,
6. By his Almighty Word at first
Heavens glorious Arch was reared;
And all the beauteous Hosts of Light
At his Command appeared.
7. The swelling Floods together rolled,
He makes in Heaps to lie,
And lays, as in a Storehouse, safe,
The watery Treasures by.
8, 9. Let Earth and all that dwell therein
Before him trembling stand:
For when he spoke the word, 'twas done,
'Twas fixed at his Command.
10. He, when the Heathen closely plot,
Their Counsels undermines;
His Wisdom ineffectual makes
The People's vain Designs.
11. But what the mighty Lord decrees
Shall stand for ever sure;
The settled purpose of his Heart
To Ages shall endure.
PART II.
12. How happy then are they, to whom
The Lord for God is known!
Whom he from all the World besides
Has chosen for his own!
13, 14, 15. He all the Nations of the Earth
From Heaven his Throne surveyed;
He saw their Works, and viewed their Thoughts.
By him their Hearts were made
16, 17. No King is safe by numerous Host^,
Their Strength the Strong deceives;
No managed Horse, by Force or Speed,
His Warlike Rider saves:
18, 19. It Is God, who those that trust in him
Beholds with gracious Eyes:
He frees their Soul from Death, their Wants
In time of Dearth supplies.
20, 21. Our Soul on God with Patience waits,
Our Help and Shield is He!
Then, Lord, let still our Hearts rejoice,
Because we trust in Thee.
22. The Riches of thy Mercy, Lord,
Do Thou to us extend;
Since we, for all we want or wish,
On Thee alone depend.
PSALM XXXIV.
1. THrough all the changing Scenes of Life,
In Trouble and in Joy,
The Praises of my God shall still
My Heart and Tongue employ.
2. Of his Deliverance I will boast,
Till all that are distressed,
From my Example Comfort take,
And charm their Grief to rest.
3. O magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt his Name:
4. Distressed, to him I sought, he heard,
And to my rescue came.
5. Their drooping Hearts were soon refreshed,
Who looked to him for Aid:
Desired Success in every Face
A cheerful Air displaid.
6. Behold (say they) the Supplicant
Whom Providence relieved,
The Man so dang'rously beset,
So wond'rously retrieved!
7. His Angel Hosts encamp around
The Dwellings of the Just;
Deliverance he affords to all
Who on his Succor trust.
8. O taste the Experience of his Love;
The Trial will decide,
How blessed they are, and only they,
Who in his Truth confide.
9. Fear him, ye Saints, and you will then
Have nothing else to fear;
Fear him, make you his Service yours,
He Will make your Wants his Care.
10. When Hungry Rapine fails with Prey
Young Lions to provide,
All those that meekly fear the Lord
Shall have their Wants supply'd^
PART II.
11. Approach, ye piously disposed,
And my Instruction hear,
I Will teach you the true Discipline
Of his religious Fear.
12. Let him who Length of Life desires,
And prosperous Days would see
13. From Slander's Venom keep his Tongue,
His Lips from Falsehood free.
14. The crooked Paths of Vice decline
And Virtue's Ways pursue,
Establish Peace where it is begun,
And, where it is lost, renew.
15. The Lord, from Heaven, beholds the Just
With favorable Eyes,
And when distressed, his gracious Ear
Is opened to their Cries.
16. But turns his wrathful Look on those
Whom Mercy cannot reclaim,
To cut them off, and raze from Earth
Their hated Race and Name.
17. Deliverance to his Saints he gives
When his relief they crave:
18. Still nigh to heal the broken Heart
And contrite Spirit save.
19. The Wicked often, but still in vain,
Against the Just conspire:
20. For under their Af^liction's weight
He keeps their Bones entire.
21. The Wicked from their Wickedness
Their Ruin shall derive;
Whilst them their Malice, and their Names,
The Righteous shall survive.
22. The Lord redeems his Servants Souls,
Who on his Trust depend,
To them and their Posterity
His Blessings shall descend.
PSALM XXXV.
1. AGainst all those that strive with me,
O Lord, assert my Right;
With such as War unjustly wage
Do Thou my Battles sight.
2. Thy Buckler take, and bind thy Shield
Upon thy warlike Arm;
Stand up, my God, in my defense,
And keep me safe from Harm.
3. Bring forth thy Spear, stop those that seek
My guiltless Blood to spill;
Say to my Soul, I am thy Health,
And will preserve thee still.
4. Whilst they with Shame are covered over
That my Destruction sought;
And such as did my Harm devise
Are to Confusion brought.
5. Then shall they fly, dispersed like Chaff
That Is scattered by the Wind;
God's vengeful Minister of Wrath
Shall follow close behind.
6. And when through dark and slippery ways
They strive thy Rage to shun,
Thy vengeful Ministers of Wrath
Shall goad them as they run.
7. Since unprovoked by any Wrong
They hid their treacherous Snare;
And for my harmless Soul a Pit
Did without Cause prepare;
8. Surpised by Mischiefs unforeseen,
By their own Traps betrayed;
Their Feet shall fall into the Net
Which they for me had laid.
9. Whilst my glad Soul shall God's great Name
For his Deliverance bless;
And by his Saving Health secured,
Its grateful Joy express.
10. My very Bones shall say, O Lord,
Who can compare with Thee?
Who sett'st the poor and helpless Man
From strong Oppressors free.
PART II.
11. False Witnesses, with forged Complaints,
Against my Truth combined;
And to my Charge such things they laid
As I had never designed.
12. The Good which I to them had done,
With Evil they repaid;
And, urged by Malice undeserved,
Did even my Life invade.
13. But as for me, when they were sick
I did in Sackcloth mourn;
I prayed and fasted, and my Prayer
Did to my self return.
14. Had they my Friends or Brethren been,
I could have done no more;
Nor with a Grief more sharp and true
A Mother's Loss deplore.
15. How differing has their Carriage proved,
In times of my Distress;
When they in Crowds together met,
Did salvage Joy express.
The Rabble too, in numerous Throngs,
By their Example came;
And ceased not, with their sordid Taunts,
To wound my spotless Fame.
16. Sco^fers, that noble Tables haunt,
And earn their Bread with Lies,
Did gnash their Teeth, and sland'rous Jests
Maliciously devise.
17. But, Lord, how long will thou look on^
On my behalf appear;
And save my guiltless Soul, which they
Like salvage Beasts would tear.
PART III.
18. So I, before the listening World,
Shall grateful Thanks express;
And where the great Assembly meets,
Thy Name with Praises bless.
19. Lord, suffer not my causeless Foes,
Who me unjustly hate;
With pu^lick Joy, or private Winks
To mock my sad Estate.
20. For they, with Hearts averse from Peace,
Maliciously devise,
Against the Men of quiet Minds
To utter spiteful Lies:
21. Nor with these private Arts content,
With open Mouths they bawl,
And say, at last we have found him out,
Our selves have seen it all.
22. But Thou, who do both them and me
With righteous Eyes survey,
Declare my Innocence, O Lord,
And keep not far away.
23. Stir up thy self, and freshly rowz'd
To Judgment, Lord, awake;
Thy righteous Servant's Cause, O God,
To thy Decision take.
24. Lord, as my Heart has upright been,
Let me thy Judgment find;
Nor let my cruel Foes obtain
The Triumph they designed.
25. O let them not amongst themselves,
In Boasting Language say,
At length our Wishes are complete,
At last he is made our Prey.
26. Let such as in my Harm rejoiced
For shame their Faces hide;
And foul Dishonor wait on those
That proudly me defied:
27. Whilst they with Joy and Gladness shout,
Who my just Cause befriend;
And bless the Lord, who loves to make
Success his Saints attend.
28. So shall my Tongue, with Joy inspired,
Thy Righteousness proclaim;
And of my grateful Songs thy Praise
Shall be the constant Theme.
PSALM XXXVI.
1. MY crafty Foe with flattering Art
His wicked Purpose would disguise;
But Reason whispers to my Heart,
No Fear of God's before his Eyes.
2. He sooths himself, retired from sight,
And thinks secured his treacherous Game;
Till his dark Plots exposed to Light,
Their false Contriver brand with Sha^e.
3. In Deeds he is my Foe confessed,
Whilst, to destroy, he speaks me fair:
True Wisdom's banished from his Breast,
And Vice has sole Dominion there.
4. His Malice spends the sleepless Night
In forging mischievous Designs;
His obstinate ungen'rous Spite
No execrable Means declines.
5. But, Lord, thy Mercy is my Hope,
That Heavens sublimest Orb transcends:
O Lord, thy Truth's unmeasured Scope
Beyond the spreading Skies extends.
6. Thy Justice, like the Hills remains;
Unfathomed Depths thy Judgments are;
Thy Providence the World sustains,
To Men and Bea^ts extends its Care.
7. O, since thy Kindness all partake,
With what Assurance should the Just
Thy sheltering Wings their Refuge make,
And Saints to thy Protection trust!
8. Such Guests shall to thy Courts be led,
To banquet on thy Love's Repast.
And drink, as from a Fountain's head,
Of Joys that shall for ever last.
9. With Thee the Springs of Life remain,
Thy Presence is eternal Day;
10. O let thy Saints thy Favor gain;
To upright Hearts thy Truth display.
11. Let Pride's insulting Foot never tread,
Nor wicked Hand my Life surprise:
12. Their Mischief turns on their own Head^
Down, down they are fallen, no more to ris^
PSALM XXXVII.
1. THough wicked Men grow Rich or Great,
Yet let not their successful State,
Thy Anger or thy Envy raise:
2. For they cut down like tender Grass,
Or like young Flowers away shall pass,
Whose blooming Beauty soon decays.
3. Depend on God, and still live well;
So Thou within the Land shall dwell,
Secure from Danger, and from Want:
4. Make him thy only chief Delight,
And He, thy Duty to requite,
Shall all thy earnest wishes grant.
5. In all thy ways trust thou the Lord,
And he will his needful Help afford
To perfect every just Design:
6. He Will make, like Light serene and clear,
Thy clouded Innocence appear,
And as a midday Sun to shine.
7. With quiet Mind on God depend,
And patiently for him attend;
Nor let thy Anger fondly rise,
Tho wicked Men with Wealth abound,
And with Success the Plots are crowned,
Which they maliciously devise.
8. From Anger cease, and Wrath ^orsake,
Let no ungoverned Passion make
Thy wavering Heart espouse their Crime;
9. For God shall sinful Men destroy,
Whilst only they the Land enjoy,
Who trust on him and wait his time.
10. How soon shall wicked Men decay!
Their Place shall vanish quite away,
Nor by the strictest search be found:
11. Whilst humble Souls possess the Earth,
Rejoicing still with godly Mirth,
With Peace and Plenty always crowned.
PART II.
12. While Sinful Crowds with fell Design
Against the righteous Few combine,
And gnash their Teeth and threatening stand:
13. God shall their empty Plots deride,
And laugh at their def^ated Pride;
He sees their Ruin near at hand.
14. They draw the Sword, and bend the Bow,
The Poor and Needy to oe'rthrow,
And Men of upright Lives to slay:
15. But their strong Bows shall soon be broke,
Their sharp-edg'd Weapon's mortal Stroke
Through their own Hearts shall force it is way.
16. A little, with God's Favor blessed,
That Is by a Righteous Man possessed,
The Wealth of many Bad excels:
17. For God supports the righteous Cause,
But as for those that break his Laws,
Their ineffectual Power he quells.
18. His constant Care the Upright guides,
And over all their Days presides,
Their Portion shall for ever last:
19. They, when Distress o'erspreads the Earth,
Shall be unmoved, and even in Dearth
The happy Fruits of Plenty taste.
20. Not so the wicked Men, and those
Who proudly dare Gods will oppose;
Destruction is their hapless share:
Like Fat of Lambs, their Hopes and they
Shall in an instant melt away,
And vanish into Smoke and Air.
PART III.
21. While Sinners brought to sad Decay,
Tho forced to borrow, cannot repay,
The Just have Will and Power to give:
22. For such as God vouchsafes to bless,
Shall peaceably the Earth possess;
And those he curses shall not live.
23. The good Man's way is God's Delight,
He orders all the Steps aright
Of him that owns his dread Command^
24. Tho he sometimes may be distressed,
Yet shall he never be quite oppressed,
For God upholds him with his Hand.
25. From blooming Youth till Age prevailed,
I never saw the Righteous failed,
Or Want overtake his numerous Race;
26. Because Compassion filled his Heart,
And he did cheerfully impart,
God made his Offsprings Wealth increase.
27. Ill Deeds with utmost Caution shun;
In that that is good with Zeal go on,
And so prolong your happy Days:
28. For God who judgment loves, will still
Preserve his Saints secure from Ill,
While soon the wicked Race decays.
29, 30, 31. The Upright shall possess the Land,
His Portion there for Ages stand;
His Mouth with Wisdom's stores supplied,
His Tongue by Rules of Judgment moves,
His Heart the Law of God approves,
Which makes his Footsteps never slide.
PART IV.
32. In vain the watch^ul Sinner lies
In wait, the Righteous to surprise;
In vain his Ruin does decree;
33. God will not him defenseless leave,
To his Revenge exposed, but save,
And when he is sentenced, set him free.
34. Wait still on God, and keep his way,
And thou, advanced the Land to sway,
Thy firm possession never shall quit:
With longing Eyes thou soon shall see
The Wicked's fatal Tragedy,
And as a glad Spectator sit.
35. The Wicked in great Power I Have seen,
And like a Bay Tree fresh and green
That spreads its pleasant Branches round:
36. But he was gone as swift as Thought,
He disappeared, where ever I sought,
Nor could his smallest Track be found.
37. Observe the perfect Man with Care,
And mark all such as Upright are;
For their calm days in Peace shall end:
38. While still the latter end of those
Who dare Gods sacred Will oppose,
A common Ruin shall attend.
39. God to the Just will Aid afford,
Their only Safeguard is the Lord,
Their Strength in time of Trouble, He.
40. Because on Him they still depend,
The Lord shall Help and Succor send,
And from the Wicked set them free.
PSALM XXXVIII.
1. COrrect me not in Anger, Lord,
Tho I deserve it all;
Nor let at once on me the Storm
Of thy Displeasure fall.
2. In every wretched Part of me
Thy Arrows deep remain:
Thy heavy Hand's afflicting Weigh^
I can no more sustain.
3. My Flesh is one continued Wound,
Thy Wrath so fiercely glows;
Betwixt my Punishment and Guilt
My Bones have no Repose.
4. My Sins are to a Deluge swelled
My wretched Head to drown;
And for my feeble Strength to bear
Too vast a Burden grown.
5. My Wounds with putrid Stench are filled,
My Folly's just Return.
6. With Trouble I am warped and bowed,
For all the day I mourn.
7. A Loathed Disease afflicts my Loins,
Unsound in every Part;
8. I Am feeble, broken, groan and roar
Through Anguish of my Heart.
PART II.
9. But, Lord, before thy searching Eyes
All my Designs appear;
And sure my Groans have been too loud,
Not to have reached thine Ear.
10. My Heart's oppressed, my Strength decay'd^
My Eyes deprived of Light:
11. Friends, Lovers, Kinsmen gaze aloof
On such a dismal Sight.
12. Mean while the Foes that seek my Life,
Their Snares to take me set;
Vent Slanders, and contrive all day
To forge some new Deceit.
13. But I, as if both Deaf and Dumb,
Nor heard, nor once replied:
14. Quite Deaf and Dumb, like one whos^ Tongu^
With conscious Guilt were tied.
15. For, Lord, to Thee I do appeal
My Innocence to clear;
Assured that Thou, the Righteous God,
My injured Cause wilt hear.
16. Hear me, I said, lest they rejoice
Who triumph in my Woe;
Insulting if they see my Foot
Once indirectly go.
17. And, with continual Grief oppressed,
To halt I now begin:
18. For, Lord to Thee I will confess,
To thee bewail my Sin.
19. But whilst I languish my proud Foes
Their Strength and Vigor boast;
Who hate me without Cause, are grown
A formidable Host.
20. Even they whom I obliged, return
My Kindness with Despite;
Become my Enemies, because
^ choose the Path that is right.
21. Forsake me not, O Lord my God,
Nor far from me depart;
22. Make have to my Relief, O Thou^
Who my Salvation art.
PSALM XXXIX.
1. Resolved to watch over all my Ways,
My very Words to aw,
I curbed my hasty Tongue, when I
The prosperous Wicked saw.
2. Like one that is dumb I Silence kept,
And did my Tongue refrain
From good Discourse; but that Constraint
Increased my inward Pain.
3. My Heart did glow, which waking Thoughts
Did hot and restless make,
And warm Reflections fanned the Fire,
Till thus at length I spoke.
4. Lord, let me know my term of days,
How soon my Life will end;
The numerous Train of Ills disclose
Which this frail State attend.
5. My Life, thou know is but a Span,
A Cipher sums my Years;
And every Man in best estate
But Vanity appears.
6. Man, like a Shadow, vainly walks,
With Fruitless Cares oppressed;
He heaps up Wealth, but cannot tell
By whom '^will be possessed.
7. Why then should I for worthless Toys
With anxious Care attend?
On Thee alone my steadfast Hope
Shall ever, Lord, depend.
8, 9. Forgive my Sins, nor let me scorned
By foolish Sinners be;
For I was dumb, and murmured not,
Because 'twas done by Thee.
10. The dreadful Burden of thy Wrath
In mercy, Lord, remove;
Lest my frail Flesh too weak to bear
The heavy Load should prove.
11. For when thou chast'nest Man for Sin,
Thou make his Beauty fade,
(So vain a thing is he!) like Cloth
By fretting Moths decayed.
12. Lord, hear my Cry, my Tears accept,
And listen to my Prayer;
Who sojourn, like a Stranger, here,
As all my Fathers were.
13. O spare me yet a little time,
My Strength again restore;
Before I vanish quite from hence,
And shall be seen no more.
PSALM XL.
1. I Waited meekly for the Lord,
Till he would vouchsafe a kind Reply;
Who did his gracious Ear afford,
And heard from Heaven my humble Cry^
2. Me from the dismal Pit he took,
When foundered deep in miry Clay;
He placed my Feet on solid Rock,
And suffered not my Steps to stray^
3. The Wonders he for me has wrought
Inspire me with new Songs of Praise;
Whence Strangers shall his Fear be taught,
And Hope of like Deliverance raise.
4. For Blessings shall that Man reward
Who on the Almighty Lord relies;
Who treats the Proud with Disregard,
And hates the Hypocrites Disguise.
5. Who can the wondrous Works recount,
Which thou, O God, for us have wrought?
Thy treasured Thoughts of Love surmount
The Power of numbers, speech and thought.
6. I Have learned, that Thou have not desired
Offerings and Sacrifice alone;
Nor Blood of guiltless Beasts required
For Man's Transgression to atone.
7. I therefore come, -- come to fulfill
The Oracles thy Books impart:
8. It Is my Delight to do thy Will;
Thy Law is written in my Heart.
PART II.
9. In full Assemblies I have told
Thy Truth and Righteousness at large;
Nor did, thou know, my Lips withold
From utt'ring what thou gav'st in charge.
10. Nor kept within my Breast confined,
Thy Justice, Faith, and saving Grace
But preached thy Love and Truth (designed
For All,) that All might them embrace.
11. Then let those Mercies I declared
To others, Lord, extend to me;
Thy loving Kindness my Reward,
Thy Truth my safe Protection be.
12. For I with Troubles am distressed
Too vast and numberless to bear;
Nor less with Loads of Guilt oppressed
That plunge and sink me to Despair.
As soon, alas! I may recount
The Hai^s on this afflicted Head,
My vanquished Courage they surmount
And fill my drooping Soul with Dread.
PART III.
13. But, Lord, to my Relief draw near,
For never was more pressing Need!
For my Deliverance, Lord, appear,
And add to that Deliverance Speed.
14. Confusion on their Heads return
Who to destroy my Soul combine;
Let them, defeated, blush and mourn,
Ensnared in their own vile Design.
15. Their Doom let Desolation be,
With Shame their Malice be repaid,
Who mocked my Confidence in Thee,
And Sport of my Affliction made.
16. While those who humbly seek thy Face
To joyful Triumphs are uprais'd;
And all who prize thy Saving Grace
Ever resound, The Lord be praised.
17. Thus wretched tho I am and poor,
Of me the Almighty Lord takes care.
Thou, God, who only can restore,
To my Relief with Speed repair.
PSALM XLI.
1. HAppy the Man, whose tender Care
Relieves the poor Distressed;
Whenever by Troubles compassed round,
The Lord shall give him Rest.
2. The Lord his Life, with Blessings crowned,
In Safety shall prolong;
And disappoint the Will of those
That seek to do him wrong.
3. If he in languishing estate
Oppressed with Sickness ly;
The Lord will make his easy Bed,
And inward Strength supply.
4. Secure of This, to thee^ my God,
I thus my Prayer addressed;
Lord, for thy Mercy heal my Soul,
Tho I have much transgressed.
5. My cruel Foes, with sland'rous words,
Attempt to wound my Fame.
When shall he die, (say they) and M^n
Forget his very Name?
6. Suppose they formal Visits make,
It Is all but empty show;
They gather Mischief in their Hearts,
And vent it where they go.
7, 8. With private Whispers, such as these,
My Foes my Hurt devise;
A sore Disease afflicts him now,
He Is fallen, no more to rise.
9. My own familiar Bosom Friend
On whom I most relied,
Has me, whose Bread he daily eat,
With open Scorn defied.
10. But thou, my sad and wretched State,
In Mercy, Lord, regard;
And raise me up, that all their Crimes
May meet their just Reward.
11. By this, I know, thy gracious Ear
Is open when I call;
Because thou suffer'st not my Foes
To triumph in my Fall.
12. Thy tender Care secures my Life
From Danger and Disgrace;
And thou vouchsaf'st to set me still
Before thy glorious Face.
13. Let therefore Isr'el's Lord and God
From age to age be blessed;
And all the People's glad Applause
With loud Amens expressed.
PSALM XLII.
1. AS pants a Heart for cooling Streams
When heated in the Chase,
So pants my Soul, O God, for thee
And thy refreshing Grace.
2. For thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty Soul does pine;
O when shall I behold thy Face,
Thou Majesty Divine!
3. Tears are my constant Food, while thu^
Insulting Foes upbraid,
Deluded Wretch, where is now thy God?
And where his promised Aid?
4. I sigh, when recollecting Thoughts
Those happy Days present,
When I with Troops of pious Friends
Thy Temple did frequent.
When I advanced with Songs of Praise,
My solemn Vows to pay,
And led the joyful sacred Throng
That kept the Festal Day.
5. Why restless, why cast down my Soul?
Trust God, and he will employ
His Aid for thee; convert these Sighs
To thankful Hymns of Joy.
6. My Soul's cast down. O God, but thinks
On thee and Sion still;
From Iordan's Banks, from Hermon's Heights,
And Missar's humble Hill.
7. One Trouble calls another on,
And bursting over my Head,
Fall spouting down, till round my Soul
A roaring Deluge spread.
8. But when thy Presence, Lord of Life,
Has once dispelled this Storm,
To thee I Will midnight Anthems sing,
And midnight Vows perform.
9. God of my Strength, how long shall I
Like one forgotten mourn?
Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed
To my Oppressors Scorn.
10. My Heart is pierced, as with a Sword,
Whilst thus my Foes upbraid
Vain Boaster, where is now thy God?
And where his promised Aid.
11. Why restless, why cast down my Soul?
Hope still, and thou shall sing
The Praise of him, who is thy God,
Thy Health and Safety's Spring.
PSALM XLIII.
1. AGainst my wicked Rebel-Foes,
Just Judge of Heaven, assert my Right^
O set me free, my God, from those
That in Deceit and Wrong delight.
2. Since thou art still my only Stay,
Why leave thou me in deep Distress?
Why go I mourning all the day,
Whilst proud insulting Foes oppress?
3. Let me with Light and Truth be blessed,
Be these my Guides and lead the way;
Till on thy holy Hill I rest,
And in thy sacred Temple pray.
4. Then will I there fresh Altars raise
To God, my chief my only Joy;
And well tuned Harps with Songs of Prais^
Shall all my grateful Hours employ.
5. Why then art thou, my Soul, so much
Cast down and pressed with anxious Care,
O trust in God, for he, as such,
My low dejected Head shall rear.
PSALM XLIV.
1. O Lord, our Fathers often have told
In our astonished Ears,
Thy Wonders in their days performed,
And elder Times than theirs:
2. How Thou, to plant them here, did drive
The Heathen from this Land^
Dispeopled by repeated Strokes
Of thy avenging Hand.
3. For, not their Courage nor their Sword
To them Possession gave;
Nor Strength, that from unequal Force
Their fainting Troops could save;
But thy Right Hand and powerful Arm,
Whose Succor they implored,
Thy Presence with the chosen Tribes
Who thy great Name adored.
4. As Thee, O God, our Fathers owned,
Thou art our Sovereign King;
O therefore, as to them thou did,
To us Deliverance bring.
5. Through thy victorious Name our Arms
The proudest Foe shall quell,
And crush 'em with repeated Strokes
Presuming to rebel.
6. I Will neither trust to Bow nor Sword,
when I in Fight engage;
7. But Thee, who have our Foes subdued,
And shamed their spiteful Rage^
8. To Thee the Triumph we ascribe,
From whom the Conquest came;
In God rejoicing all the day,
And ever bless his Name^
PART II.
9. But thou have cast us off, and now
Most shamefully we yield;
For thou no more vouchsaf'st to lead
Our Armies to the Field.
10. Since when, to every upstart Foe
We turn our Backs in Fight;
And with our Spoil their Malice feast
Who bear us ancient Spite.
11. To Slaughter doomed, we fall like Sheep
Into their Butch'ring Hands;
Or (what is more wretched yet) survive
Dispersed through Heathen Lands.
12. Thy People thou have sold for Slaves,
And set their Price so low,
That not thy Treasure by the Sale
But their Disgrace might grow.
13, 14. Reproacht and scofft by Nations round,
The Heathen's Byword grown,
Whose Scorn of us is both in Speech
And mocking Gestures shown.
15. Confusion strikes me blind, my Face
In conscious shame I hide,
16. While we are scoffed, and God blasphemed
By their licentious Pride.
PART III.
17. On us this Mass of Woes is fallen,
All this we have endured;
Yet have not, Lord, renounced thy Name;
Nor Covenant abjured.
18. But kept in Paths, by Thee prescribed,
Our Heart and Steps with Care;
19. Tho shattered, mangled and reduced
To Confines of Despair.
20. Could we the Almighty's Name forget
And other Gods adore,
21. And not the Searcher of all Hearts
The treacherous Crime explore?
22. Thou see how for thy sake all day
We Martyrdom sustain;
All slaughtered, or reserved like Sheep
Appointed to be slain.
23. Wake, Lord, arise; let seeming Sleep
No longer thee detain;
Nor we, thy faithful Supplicants,
For ever sue in vain!
24. O wherefore hidest thou thy Face
From our afflicted state?
25. Whose Souls and Bodies sink to Earth
With Grief's oppressive Weight.
26. Arise, O Lord, and timely Speed
To our Deliverance make;
Redeem us, Lord, -- if not for Ours,
Yet ^or thy Mercies sake.
PSALM XLV.
1. WHile I the King's loud Praise rehearse,
Endited by my Heart,
My Tongue is like the Pen of one
That writes with ready Art.
2. How matchless is thy Form, O King!
Thy Mouth with Grace overflows;
Because fresh Blessings, God, on thee
Eternally bestows.
3. Gird on thy Sword, most mighty Prince,
And clad in rich array,
With glorious Ornaments of Power,
Majestic Pomp display.
4. Ride on in state, and still protect
The Meek, the Just, and True;
Whilst thy Right Hand with fell Revenge
Does all thy Foes pursue.
5. How sharp thy Weapons are to them
That dare thy Power oppose!
Down, down they fall, while through their Heart
The feathered Arrow goes.
6. But thy firm Throne, O God, is fixed
For ever to endure;
Thy Sceptre's sway shall always last,
Through righteous Laws secure.
7. Because thy Heart, by Justice steered
Did upright ways approve,
And hated still the crooked Paths
Where wandering Sinners rove.
Therefore did God, thy God, on thee
The Oil of Gladness shed;
And has above thy Fellows round
Advanced thy lofty Head.
8. With Cassia, Aloes and Myrrh
Thy Royal Robes abound;
Which from thy stately Wardrobes brought
Spread grateful Odours round.
9. Among thy honorable Train
Did Princely Virgins wait,
The Queen was placed at thy Right Hand,
In Golden Robes of State.
PART II.
10. But thou, O Royal Bride, give ear
And to my Words attend;
Forget thy Native Country now,
And every former Friend.
11. So shall thy Beauty charm the King,
Nor shall his Love decay;
For he is now become thy Lord,
To him due Reverence pay.
12. The Tyrian Ladies rich and proud
Shall humble Presents make;
And all the wealthy Nations sue
Thy Favor to partake:
13. The King's fair Daughter's beauteous Soul
All inward Graces fill;
Her Raiment is of purest Gold,
Adorned with costly skill.
14. She, in her nuptial Garments dressed,
With Needles richly wrought,
Attended by her Virgin Train,
Shall to the King be brought.
15. With all that State of solemn Joy
The Triumph moves along,
Till with wide Gates the Royal Court
Receives the pompous Throng.
16. Thou, in thy Royal Fathers Room,
Must princely Sons expect;
Whom thou to different Realms may send
To govern and protect:
17. Whilst this my Song to future times
Transmits thy Glorious Name;
And makes the World, with joint consent,
Thy lasting Praise proclaim.
PSALM XLVI.
1. GOD is our Refuge in Distress,
A present Help when Troubles press;
In him undaunted we confide:
2, 3. Tho Earth were from her Center tossed,
And Mountains in the Ocean lost,
Torn piecemeal by the roaring Tide.
4. A Gentler Stream with Gladness still
The City of our Lord shall ^ill,
Imperial Seat of God most High:
5. God dwells in Sion, whose fair Towers
Shall mock the Assaults of Earthly Powers,
While his Almighty Aid is nigh.
6. In Tumults when the Heathen raged,
And Kingdoms War against us waged,
He thundered and dissolved their Powers:
7. The Lord of Hosts conducts our Arms,
Our Tower of Refuge in Alarms,
Our Fathers Guardian-God and ours.
8. Come, see the Wonders he has wrought,
On Earth what Desolation brought,
9. And crushed to Peace the jarring World;
In shivers brake the Spear and Bow,
With them their thundering Chariots too
Into devouring Flames were hurld.
10. Submit to God's Almighty Sway
For Him the Heathen shall obey,
And Earth her Sovereign Lord confess.
11. The God of Hosts conducts our Arms,
Our Tower of Refuge in Alarms,
As to our Fathers in Distress.
PSALM XLVII.
1, 2. O All ye People clap your hands,
And with triumphant Voices sing;
No Force the mighty Power withstands,
Of God, the universal King.
3, 4. He shall opposing Nations quell,
And with Success our Battles fight;
Shall point the place where we must dwell,
The Pride of Jacob, his Delight.
5, 6. God is gone up, our Lord and King,
With Shouts of Joy and Trumpet's Sound;
To him repeated Praises sing,
And let the cheerful Song go round.
7, 8. Your utmost Skill in Praise be shown;
For him that all the World commands.
Who sits upon his Holy Throne,
And spreads his Sway over Heathen Lands.
9. Our Chiefs and Tribes, that far from hence
TO adore the God of Abr'am came,
Found him their constant sure defense.
How great and glorious is his Name!
PSALM XLVIII.
1. THE Lord is great, and over the Gods
Sublimely to be praised;
In Sion, on whose happy Mount
His sacred Throne is raised.
2. Her Towers, the Joy of all the Earth,
With beauteous Prospect rise:
On her North side the Almighty King's
Imperial City lies.
3. God in her Palaces is known,
His Presence is her Guard.
4. Confed'rate Kings withdrew their Siege,
And of Success despaired.
5. They viewed her Walls, admired and fled,
With Grief and Terror struck,
6. Like Women whom the sudden Pangs
Of Travel had o'ertook.
7. No wretched Crew of Mariners
Appear like them forlorn,
When freighted Fleets from Tarshish shore
By Eastern Winds are torn.
8. In Sion we have seen performed
A Work that was foretold,
In pledge that God, for times to come,
His City will uphold.
9. Not in our Fortresses and Walls
Did we, O God, confide,
But on the Temple fixed our Hopes,
In which thou do reside.
10. Thy Name i^, Lord of Hosts, supreme
Whose Fame through Earth extends;
Thy pow'ful Arm, as Justice guides,
Chastises or defends.
11. Let Sion's Mount with Joy resound,
Her Daughters all be taught
In Songs his Judgments to extol,
Who this Deliverance wrought.
12. Walk round her Walls in solemn Pomp,
Your Eyes about her cast,
Recount her Towers, if by the Siege
You find a Stone displaced.
13. Her Forts and Palaces survey,
Observe their Order well.
That with Assurance to your Heirs,
This Wonder you may tell.
14. This God is ours, and will be ours,
Whilst we in him confide;
And, as he has preserved us now,
Till Death will be our Guide.
PSALM XLIX.
1, 2. LET all the listening World attend,
And my Instructions hear;
Let High and Low, and Rich and Poor
With joint Consent give ear.
3. My Mouth, with sacred Wisdom filled,
Shall good Advice impart,
The sound Result of prudent Thoughts,
Digested in my Heart.
4. To Parables of weighty Sense
I will my Ear incline;
Whilst to the tuneful Harp I sing
Dark Words of deep Design.
5. Why should my Courage fail in times
Of Danger and of Doubt?
When Sinners that would me supplant
Have compassed me about?
6. Those Men that all their Hope and Trust
In Heaps of Treasure place,
And boast and triumph when they see
Their ill-got Wealth increase.
7. Are yet unable from the Grave
Their dearest Friend to free;
Nor can by force of costly Bribes
Reverse God's firm Decree.
8, 9. Their vain Endeavors they must quit,
The Price is held too high;
No Sums can purchase such a Grant,
That Man should never die.
10. Not Wisdom can the Wise exempt,
Nor Fools their Folly save;
But both must perish, and in Death
Their Wealth to others leave.
11. For tho they think their stately Seats
Shall never to Ruin fall;
But their remembrance last, in Lands
Which by their Names they call;
12. Yet shall their Fame be soon forgo^,
How great so^'er their State,
With Beasts their Memory and They
Shall share one common Fate.
PART II.
13. How great theri Folly is who thus
Absurd Conclusions make!
And yet their Children, unreclaim'd,
Repeat the gross Mistake.
14. Like Sheep, the Prey of ravenous Death,
Within the Grave they are laid;
And there, whilst Righteous Men rejoice,
Shall all their Beauty fade.
15. But God will yet redeem my Soul,
And from the greedy Grave
His greater Power shall set me free,
And to himself receive.
16. Then fear not Thou, when worldly Men
In envied Wealth abound,
Nor tho their prosperous House increase,
With lofty Honors crowned.
17. For when they are summoned hence by Dea^^
They leave all this behind^
No Shadow of their former Pomp
Within the Grave they find:
18. And yet they thought their State was blessed,
Caught in the Flatt'rers Snare,
Who praises those that slight all else,
And of themselves take care.
19. In their Forefathers Steps they tread;
And when, like them, they die,
Their wretched Ancestors and they
In endless Dark^ess lie.
20. For Man, how great soe'^r his state,
Unless he is truly wise,
As like a sensual Beast he lives,
So like a Beast he dies.
PSALM L.
1, 2. THE Lord has spoke, the mighty God
Has sent his Summons all abroad,
From dawning Light till Day declines:
The listening Earth his Voice has heard,
And he from Sion has appeared,
Where Beauty in Perfection shines.
3, 4. Our God shall come, and keep no more
Misconstru'd Silence as before,
But wasting Flames before him send:
Around shall Tempests fiercely rage,
While he does Heaven and Earth engage
His just Tribunal to attend.
5, 6. Assemble all my Saints to me
(Thus runs the Great Divine Decree)
That in my lasting Covenant live,
And Offerings bring with constant Care;
(The Heavens his Justice shall declare,
For God himself shall Sentence give.)
7. Attend, my People; Israel, hear;
Thy strong Accuser I Will appear;
Thy God, thy only God am I;
8. It Is not of Offerings I complain,
With which you did, both burnt and slain,
My sacred Altar still supply.
9. Will this alone Atonement make?
No Bullock from thy Stall I Will take,
Nor He-goat from thy Fold accept:
10. The Forest Beasts that range alone,
The Cattle too are all my own,
That on a thousand Hills are kept.
11. I know the Fowls, that build their Nests
In craggy Rocks; and salvage Beasts,
That loosely haunt the open Fields.
12. To thee, if Hunger did oppress,
I need not tell my sad Distress,
Since the World's mine, and all it yields.
13. Think thou that I have any need
On slaughtered Bulls and Goats to feed,
To eat their Flesh, and drink their Blood?
14. The sacrifice by me required,
Is Hearts with grateful Love inspired,
And Vows with strictest Care made good.
15. In time of Trouble call on me,
And I will set thee safe and free;
And Thou returns of Praise shall make:
16. But to the Wicked thus says God,
How dare thou teach my Laws abroad,
Or in thy Mouth my Covenant take?
17. For stubborn thou, confirmed i^ Sin,
Have proof against Instruction been,
And of my Word did lightly speak:
18. When thou a subtle Thief did see,
Thou gladly did with him agree,
And with Adult'rers did partake.
19. Vile Slander is thy constant Theme,
And thou thy Mouth and Tongue do frame
Vile and deceitful Words to spread:
20. Thou do with hateful Scandals wound
Thy Brother, and with Lies confound
The Offspring of thy Mother's Bed.
21. These things thou did, whom still I strove
To gain with Silence and with Love;
Till thou did wickedly surmise,
That I was such a one as thou;
But ^'ll rep^ove and shame thee now,
And set thy Sins before thine Eyes.
22. Ye wicked Fools, mark this with Care,
Lest I should you in pieces tear,
Whilst none shall dare your Cause to own.
23. Who praises me due Honor gives;
And to the Man that justly lives
My strong Salvation shall be shown.
PSALM LI.
1. MY God, as thou have always been,
Continue ever kind;
Let me, oppressed with Loads of Guilt,
Thy wonted Mercy find.
2, 3. O wash me from my foul Offense,
And cleanse me from my Sin;
For I confess my Crime, and see
How great my Guilt has been.
4. Against Thee only, Lord, have I,
And in thy Sight transgressed;
Whose Words and Judgments, pure and just,
Will bear the strictest Test.
5. In Guilt each several part was formed
Of all this sinful Frame;
In Guilt I was c^^ceiv'd, and born
The Heir of Sin and Shame.
6. Yet thou, O God, whose searching Eye
Does inward Truth require,
In secret did with Wisdom's Laws,
My tender Soul inspire.
7. O then with Hys^op purge my Soul,
And so I shall be clean;
In pity wash me, and I shall
More white than Snow remain.
8. Make me with Joy and Gladness hear
Thy kind forgiving Voice;
That so the Bones which thou have broke,
With Comfort may rejoice.
9, 10. Blot out my Sins, nor let thine Eyes
My Fault in Anger view;
Create in me a Heart that is clea^,
A virtuous mind renew.
PART II.
11. Withdraw not thou thy Presence, Lord,
Nor ca^t me from thy sight;
Nor let thy Holy Spirit take
It Is everlasting Flight:
12. The Joy which thy Salvation gives
Let m^ again obtain;
And thy free Spirit's firm Support
My stagg'ring Soul sustain.
13. So I thy just and righteous Ways
To Sinners will impart,
Whil^t my Advice shall wicked Men
To thy just Laws co^vert.
14. Do Thou my Guilt of Blood remove,
My Savior and my God;
And my glad Tongue shall loudly tell
Thy r^ghteous Acts abroad.
15. Let thy Free Grace unlock my Lips,
With Sorrow closed and Shame;
So shall my Mouth thy Wondrous Praise
To all the World proclaim.
16. Could Victims for my Guilt atone,
Whole Hecatombs should die;
But on such Offerings thou disdain'st
To cast a gracious Eye:
17. A broken Spirit is the Gift
By God most highly prized;
By him a broken contrite Heart
Shall never be despised.
18. Let Sion, Lord, thy Favor find,
Of thy Good Will assured;
And thy own City flourish long,
By lofty Walls secured.
19. The^ shall the Righteous Offerings bring,
And pleasing Tribute pay;
And Sacrifice of choicest kind,
Upon thy Altar lay.
PSALM LII.
1. IN vain, O Man of matchless Might,
Thou boast'st thy self in Ill;
Since God, whose Power is much more great,
Vouchsafes his Favor still.
2. Thy wicked Tongue does sland'rous Tales,
Maliciously devise;
And like a Rasor sharply set,
Does wound with treacherous Lies.
3, 4. Thy Thoughts are more on Ill than Good,
On Lies than Truth employed,
Thy Tongue delights in Words by which
The Guiltless are destroyed.
5. God shall for ever blast thy Hopes,
And snatch thee soon away;
Nor in thy Dewlling Place permit,
Nor in the World to stay.
6. The Just with pious Fear shall see
The downfall of thy Pride;
Shall at thy sudden Ruin laugh,
And thus thy Fall deride:
7. See there the haughty Man that was,
Who proudly God defied,
Who trusted in his Wealth, and still
On wicked Arts relied.
8. But like those Olive-Plants am I,
That shade God's Temple round;
And hope with his indulgent Grace
To be for ever crowned.
9. So shall my Soul with Praise, O God,
Extol thy wondrous Love;
And on thy Name with Patience wait;
For this thy Saints approve.
PSALM LIII.
1. THE wicked Fools must sure suppose
That God is but a Name;
This their lewd Practice plainly shows,
Since Virtue all disclaim.
2. The Lord looked down from Heaven's high Tower
And did all Mankind view;
To see if any owned his Power,
Or Truth or Justice knew.
3. But all, he saw, were backwards gone,
Degenerate grown and base;
None for Religion cared, not One
Of all the sinful Race.
4. But are those Workers of Deceit
So dull and senseless grown,
That they like Bread my People eat,
And God's just Power disown?
5. Their causeless Fears shall strangely grow;
And they, despised by God,
Shall soon be foiled; his hand shall throw
Their shattered Bones abroad.
6. Would he his saving Power employ,
To break our servile Band,
Loud Shouts of universal Joy
Should echo through the Land.
PSALM LIVE.
1, 2. LOrd, save me, for thy Glorious Name,
And in thy Strength appear
To judge my Cause: accept my Prayer,
And to my Words give Ear.
3. Mere Strangers, whom I never wronged,
To ruin me designed;
And cruel Men, that fear no God,
Against my Soul combined.
4, 5. But God takes part with all my Friends,
And he is the surest Guard;
The God of Truth shall slay my Foes,
Their Falshood's just Reward.
6. While I my grateful Offerings bring,
And Sacrifice with Joy;
And in his Praise my time to come
Delightfully employ.
7. From dreadful Danger and Distress
The Lord has set me free;
Through him shall I of all my Foes
The wished Destruction see!
PSALM LV.
1. GIve ear, thou Judge of all the Earth,
And listen when I pray;
Nor from thy humble Suppliant turn
Thy glorious Face away.
2. Attend to this my sad complaint,
And hear my grievous Moans;
Whilst I my mournful Case declare
With artless Sighs and Groans.
3. Hark! how the Foe insults aloud,
How fierce Oppressors Rage!
Whose sland'rous Tongues with wrathful Hate
Against my Fame engage.
4, 5. My Heart is racked with Pain, my Soul
With deadly Frights distressed;
With Fear and Trembling compassed round
With Horror quite oppressed.
6. How often wished I then, that I
Swift Dove-like Wings could get;
That I might take my speedy Flight,
And seek a safe Retreat!
7, 8. Then would I wander far from hence,
And in wild Deserts stray,
Till all this furious Storm were spent,
This Tempest past away.
PART II.
9. Destroy, O Lord, their ill Design's,
Their Counsels all divide;
For my grieved Eyes in every Stree^
Have Strife and Rapine spied.
10. By Day and Night on every Wall
They walk their constant Round;
And in the midst of all her Strength,
Are Grief Mischief found.
11. Whoever through every Part shall roam,
Will fresh Disorders meet;
Deceit and Guile their constant posts
Maintain in every Street.
12. For 'twas not any open Foe
That did my Faults upbraid;
For then I could with ease have bor^
The bitter'st things he said:
'Twas none who Hatred had pro^est
That did against me rise;
For then I had withdrawn my self
From his malicious Eyes.
13, 14. But 'twas even thou, my Guide, my Friend,
Whom tenderest Love did join;
Whose swe^t Advice ^ valued most,
Whose Prayers were mixed with mine.
15. Sure Vengeance, equal to their Crimes,
Such Traitors must surprise;
And Sudden Death requite those Ills
They wickedly devise!
16, 17. But I Will still call on God, and he
Shall in my Aid appear;
At Morn, and Noon, and Night I Will pray,
And he my Voice shall hear.
PART III.
18. God has released my Soul from those
That in fierce Fight contend;
And made a numerous Host of Friends
My righteous Cause defend.
19. For He who was my Help of old,
Shall my Petition hear;
And punish them whose prosperous State
Makes them no God to fear.
20. Whom can I trust, if faithless Men
Perfidiously devise
To ruin me, their peaceful Friend,
And break the strongest Ties!
21. Tho smooth as Butter are their Words,
Their Hearts with War abound;
Their Speeches are more soft than Oil,
And yet like Swords they wound.
22. Do thou, my Soul on God depend,
And He shall thee sustain,
He aids the Just, whom to remove
The Wicked strive in vain.
23. Thou, Lord shall soon destroy my Foes;
While those who trust in Lies,
And trade in Blood, untimely fall,
My Soul on God relies^
PSALM LVI.
1. DO Thou, O God, in Mercy help,
For Man my Life pursues;
To crush me with repeated Wrongs,
He daily Strife renews.
2. Each Day, all Day, invet'ra^e Foes
To ruin me combine;
Thou see, who sit'st enthroned on high,
What mighty Numbers join.
3. But, tho sometimes surpised by Fear,
(On Danger's first Alarm)
For Succor I repose my Trust
On thy Almighty Arm.
4. God's Word I shall hereafter praise,
On which I now rely:
In God ^ trust, and trusting him,
The Arm of Flesh defy.
5. They rack my harmless Words to speak
A Sense they never meant:
Their Thoughts are all, with restless Spite,
On my Destruct on bent.
6. In close Assemblies they combine,
And wicked Projects lay.
They watch my Steps and lie in wait,
To make my Soul the^ Prey.
7. Shall such Injusticce still escape?
O Righteous God a^^e;
Let thy just Wra^h (^oo ^^ng provoked)
This impious Race chastise.
8. My Wand'rings Thou, and Sufferings know
Since first compelled to flee:
My very Tears are treasured up,
And regist'red by Thee.
9. When therefore I invoke thy Aid,
My Foes shall be overthrown;
For I am well assured that God
My righteous cause will own.
10, 11. I Will bless God's Word, trust him, nor fear
The Force that Man can raise:
12. To Thee, O God, my Vows are due,
To Thee I Will render Praise.
13. Thou have retrieved my Soul from Death;
And Thou will still secure
The Life thou have so often preserved,
And make my Footsteps sure;
That thus protected by thy Power,
I may this Light enjoy,
And in the Servi^e of my God
My lengthened Days employ.
PSALM LVII.
1. THY Mercy, Lord, to me extend,
On thy Protection I depend;
And to thy Wing for shelter haste,
Till this outrageous Storm is past.
2. To thy Tribunal, Lord, I fly,
Thou Sovereign Judge and God most high;
Who Wonders have for me begun,
And wilt not leave thy Work undone.
3. From Heaven Thou'^t save me by thine Arm,
Bring those to shame who seek my Harm;
To aid me, forth thy Mercy send,
And Truth, on which my Hopes depend.
4. Condemned, as to a Lion's Den,
I lie among more salvage Men;
Whose Teeth are pointed Spears, their Words
Envenomed Darts and two-edged Swords.
5. Be thou, O God, exalted high;
And, as thy Glory fills the Sky,
So let it be on Earth displaid,
Till thou art here, as there, obeyed.
6. To take me they their Net prepared,
And had almost my Soul ensnared,
But fell themselves, by just Decree,
Into the Pit they delv'd for me.
7. O God my Heart is fixed, it is bent
It Is thankful Tribute to present,
And with my Heart, my Voice I Will raise
To Thee, my God, in Songs of Praise.
8. Awake my Glory; Harp and Lute,
No longer let your Strings be mute;
Awake his Praises to pursue,
As I my self will early do.
9. Thy Praises, Lord, I will resound
To all the listening Nations round:
10. Thy Mercy highest Heaven tran^cends,
Thy Truth beyond the Clouds extends.
11. Be Thou, O God, exalted High;
And as thy Glory fills the Sky,
So let it be on Earth displaid,
Till thou art here, as there, obeyed.
PSALM LVIII.
1. SPeak, O ye Judges of the Earth,
If just your Sentence be,
Or, must not Innocence appeal
To Heaven from your Decree?
2. Your wicked Hearts and Judgments are
Alike by Malice swayed:
Your covetous Hands by weighty Bribes
To Violence betrayed.
3. Estranged from Virtue from the Womb,
Their Infant-steps went wrong:
They prattled Slander, and in Lies
Employed their lisping Tongue.
4. No Serpent of parched Africk's breed
Does ranker Poison bear;
The drowsy Adder will as soon
Unlock his sullen Ear.
5. To Counsel obstinately deaf
As Adders they remain;
From whom the skilful Charmer's Voice
Can no Attention gain.
6. Defeat, O God, their threatening Rage,
And timely break their Power:
Disarm these growing Lion's Jaws,
Ever practiced to devour,
7. Let now their Insolence at height,
Like ebbing Tides be spent;
Their splint'ring Darts deceive their Aim
When they their Bow have bent.
8. Like Snails let them dissolve to Slime;
Abortive Births become,
Unwor^hy to behold the Sun
And buried in the Womb.
9. Ever Thorns can make the Fleshpots boil,
Tempestuous Wrath shall come
From God, and Living snatch them hence,
To their eternal Doom.
10. The Righteous shall rejoice to see
Their Crimes such Vengeance meet,
And Saints in Persecutors Blood,
Wash their victorious Feet.
11. Transgressors then with Grief shall see
Just men Rewards obtain;
And own a God that s^rictly will
The guilty Earth arraign.
PSALM LIX.
1. DEliver me, O Lord my God,
From all my spiteful Foes:
In my Defense oppose thy Power
To theirs who me oppose,
2. Preserve me from a wicked Race
Who make a Trade of Ill;
Protect me from remorseless Men
Who seek my Blood to spill.
3. They lie in wait, and mighty Powers
Against my Life combine:
Implacable; yet, Lord, thou know,
For no Offense of mine.
4. In hurry they set watch and ward
My guiltless Life to take:
Look down, O Lord, on my Distress,
And to my Help awake!
5. Thou, Lord of Hosts and Isr'el's God,
Their Heathen Rage suppress:
Relentless Vengeance take on those
Who stubbornly transgress.
6. At Evening to beset my House
Like growling Dogs they meet;
While others through the City roam,
And ransack every Street.
7. Their Throats belch Slanders, from their Mouths
They brandish sharpened Swords;
Who hears (say they) or hearing, dares
Reprove our lawless Words?
8. But from thy Throne thou shall, O Lord,
Their bassled Plots deride;
To Scorn and Infamy expose
Insulting Heathen's Pride.
9. On Thee I wait, it is on thy Strength
For Succor I depend,
It Is Thou, O God, art my Defense,
Who only can defend.
10. Thy Mercy, Lord, shall first prevent
And me from Danger free;
Then crown my Wishes, and subdue
My Haughty Foes to me.
11. Destroy 'em, Lord, but not entire,
Nor at a single Blow,
Lest we, ingratefully, too soon
Forget their Overthrow.
But Vagabonds through sundry Realms
Disperse 'em by thy Power;
Do Thou bring down their haughty Pride,
O Lord, our Shield and Tower.
12. Now, in the Height of all their Pride,
Their Arrogance chastise;
Whose Tongues have sinned without Restraint
And Curses joined with Lies.
13. Nor till thou have consumed their Race
Thine Anger, Lord, suppress,
That outmost Lands, by their just Doom,
May Isr'el's God confess.
14. At Evening let them still persist
Like growling Dogs to meet,
Still traverse all the City round,
And ransack every Street.
15. Then, as for Malice now they do,
For Hunger let 'em stray,
And yell their vain Complaints aloud,
Defeated of their Prey.
16. Whilst early ^ thy Mercy sing,
Thy wondrous Power confess;
For thou have been my sure Defense
My Refuge in Distress.
17. To Thee with never-ceasing Praise,
O God, my Strength, I Will sing;
For thou have always been the Rock
From whence my Comforts spring.
PSALM LX.
1. O God who have our Troops dispersed,
Forsaking them forsook Thee first,
As we thy just Displeasure mourn,
To us in Mercy, Lord, return.
2. Our Strength, that firm as Earth did stand,
Is rent by thy avenging Hand;
O heal the Breaches thou have made,
We shake, we fall, without thy Aid!
3. Our Folly's sad Effects we feel,
For drunk with Discord's Cup we reel.
4. But now for them who thee revered,
Thou have thy Truth's bright Banner reared.
5. Let thy Right Hand thy Saints protect,
Lord hear the Prayers that we direct!
6. The Holy God has spoke; and I
On his firm Word, o'erjoy'd, rely.
To Thee in Portions I Will divide
Fair Sichem's Soil, Samaria's Pride,
To Sichem, Succoth next I Will join,
And measure out her Vale by Line.
7. Manasseh, Gilead, both subscribe
To my Commands, with Ephraim's Tribe;
Ephraim by Arms supports my Cause,
And Judah by religious Laws.
8. Moab my Slave and Drudge shall be,
Nor Ed^m from my Yoke get free;
Proud Palestine's imperious State
Shall humbly on our Triumph wait.
9. But who shall quell these mighty Powers
And me possess of Edom's Towers?
Or through her guarded Frontiers tread
The Path that does to Conquest lead?
10. Even thou, O God, who have dispersed
Our Troops, (for we forsook Thee first)
Whom in just wrath thou did forsake,
Atoned, thou will victorious make.
11. Do thou our fainting Cause sustain,
For humane Succors are but vain.
12. Fresh Strength and Courage God bestows,
It Is He treads down our proudest Foes.
PSALM LXI.
1. LOrd, hear my Cry, regard my Prayer,
Which I, oppressed with Grief,
2. From Earth's remotest Parts address
To thee for kind Relief.
O lodge me safe beyond the Reach
Of persecuting Power,
3. Thou who so often from spit^^ul Foes,
Have been my shelt'^^g Tower.
4. Within thy sacred Co^rts I shall
S^cure from Danger lie:
Beneath the Covert of thy Wings,
All future Storms de^ie^
5. In sign my Vows are heard, once more
I over thy Chosen reign:
6. O bless with long and prosperous Life
The King thou did ordain.
7. Confirm his Throne, and make his Reign
Accepted in thy sight;
And let thy Truth and Mercy both
In his Defense unite.
8. So shall I ever sing thy Praise,
Thy Name for ever bless;
Devote my prosperous Days to pay
The Vows of my Distress.
PSALM LXII.
1, 2. MY Soul for Help on God relies,
From him alone my Safety flows:
My Rock, my Health, that Strength supplies,
To bear the shock of all my Foes.
3. How long will ye contrive my Fall?
Which will but hasten on your own
You Will totter like a bowing Wall,
Or fence of uncemented Stone.
4. To make my envied Fortunes less
They strive with Lies their chief Delight;
For they, tho with their Mouths they bless,
In private curse with inward Spite.
5, 6. But thou, my Soul, on God rely;
On him alone thy Trust repose;
My Rock and Health will strength supply,
To bear the Shock of all my Foes.
7. God does his saving Health dispense,
And flowing Glories largely send;
He is my Fortress and Defense,
On him my Soul shall still depend.
8. In him, ye People, always trust,
B^^or^ his Throne pour out your Hearts;
For God, the Merciful and Jus^,
His timely Aid to us imparts.
9. Sure High and Low in balance laid^
With vain Conceits and Lies abound;
And if with Vanity they are weighed,
Lighter than that they will both be found.
10. Then trust not in oppre^^ive Ways,
By Spoil and Rapine grow not vain;
Nor let your Hearts, if Wealth increase,
Be set too much upon your Gain.
11. For God has often his Will expressed;
And I this Truth have fully known;
To be of boundless Power possessed
Belongs of right to God alone.
12. Tho Mercy is his Darling Grace,
In which he chiefly takes delight.
Yet will he all the Human Race
According to their Works requi^e.
PSALM LXIII.
1. O God, my gracious God, to Thee,
My Morning Prayers s^all offered be;
For Thee my thirsty So^l does pant;
My fainting Flesh implores thy Grace,
Within this dry and barren Place,
Where I refreshing Waters want.
2. O to my longing Eyes once more
That View of glorious Power restore,
Which thy majestic House displays:
3. Because to me thy wondrous Love
Than Life it self does dearer prove,
My Lips shall always speak thy Praise^
4. My Life, while I that Life enjoy.
In blessing God I Will still employ,
With lif^ed Hands adore his Name:
5. My Soul's Content shall be as great,
As theirs who choicest Dainties eat,
While I with Joy his Praise proclaim,
6. When down I lie sweet Sleep to find,
You Are always present to my Min^,
And when I wake in dead of Night:
7. Because thou still did Succor bring,
Beneath the Shadow of thy Wing
I Will rest with Safety and Delight.
8. My Soul, when Foes would me devour
Cleaves fast to Thee, whose matchless Pow'^
In her Support is daily shown:
9. But those the Righteous Lord shall slay
That my Destruction wish; and they
That seek my Life shall lose their own,
10, 11. They by untimely Ends shall die,
Their Flesh a Prey to Foxes lie:
But God shall fill the King with Joy.
Who swears by him shall still rejoice,
Whilst the false Mouth and lying Voice
The Lord shall silence and destroy.
PSALM LXIV.
LOrd, hear the Voice of my Complaint,
And to my Prayer give ear;
Preserve my Life from cruel Foes,
And free my Soul from Fear.
2. O hide me with thy tenderest Care
In some secure Retreat,
From Sinners that against me rise,
And their close Plots defeat.
3. See how intent to work my Harm,
They whet their Tongues like Swords;
And bend their Bows to shoot their Darts,
Sharp Lies and bitter Words!
4. In private lurking, at the Just
They take their secret Aim;
And suddenly at him they shoot,
Quite void of Fear and Shame.
5. To carry on their ill Designs,
They mutual Help supply,
They speak of laying private Snares,
And think that none shall spy.
6. With utmost Diligence and Care
Their wicked Plots they lay;
The private Thoughts of all their Hearts
With deep Designs betray.
7. But God, to Anger justly moved,
His dreadful Bow shall bend,
And on his flying Arrows point
Shall swift Destruction send.
8. Sharp Slanders, which their Tongues did vent,
Upon themselves shall fall;
Their Friends that see it shall them forsake,
Despised and shunned by All.
9. The World shall then God's Power confess
And Nations trembling stand,
Convinced that it is the mighty Work
Of his avenging Hand.
10. Whilst righteous Men by God secured
In him shall gladly trust;
And all the listening Earth shall hear
Loud Triumphs of the Just.
PSALM LXV.
1. FOR Thee, O God, our constant Praise
In Sion waits, thy chosen Seat;
Whilst there we promised Altars raise,
We'll all our zealous Vows complete.
2. O Thou, who to my humble Prayer
Did always bend thy listening Ear,
To Thee shall all Mankind repair,
And at thy gracious Throne appear.
3. In vain of Sins a numerous Train
To stop thy flowing Mercies try;
Whilst thou o'erlook'st the Guilty Stai^^
And washest out the Crimson Dye.
4. Blessed is the Man, who, near Thee plac^d.
Within thy Sacred Dwelling lives!
Whilst we at humbler Distance taste
The vast delights thy Temple gives.
5. By wondrous Acts, O God, most jus^,
Have we thy gracious Answer found;
In Thee remorest Nations trust,
And those whom stormy Waves surroun^.
6, 7. God, by his Strength, sets fast the Hills,
And does his matchless Power engage,
With which the Seas loud Waves he s^ills,
And angry Crowds tumultuous Rage.
PART II.
8. Thou, Lord, do barbarous Lands dismay
When they thy dreadful Tokens view:
With Joy they see the Night and Day
Each other's Track by turns pursue.
9. From out thy unexhausted Store
Thy Rain relieves the thirsty Ground^
And makes the Earth, quite parched befo^^^
With Corn and useful Fruits abound.
10. On rising Ridges down it pours,
And all the furrowed Valleys fills^
Thou make them soft with gentle Showers,
In which a blessed Increase distills.
11. Thy Goodness does the circling Year
With fresh Returns of Plenty Crown;
And where thy glorious Paths appear,
Thy fruitful Clouds drop Fatness down.
12. They drop on barren Forests changed
By them to Pastures fresh and green;
The Hills about in order ranged,
In beauteous Robes of Joy are seen.
13. Large Flocks with fleecy Wool adorn
The cheerful Downs; the Valleys bring
A plenteous Crop of full-ear'd Corn,
And seem for Joy to shout and sing.
PSALM LXVI.
1, 2. LET all the Lands with Shouts of Joy
To God their Voices raise.
Sing Psalms in Honor of his Name,
And spread his glorious Praise.
3. And let them say, how dreadful, Lord,
In all thy Works art thou!
To thy great Power thy stubborn Foes
Shall all be forced to bow.
4. Through all the Earth the Nations round
Shall Thee their God confess;
And with glad Hymns their awful Dread
Of thy great Name express.
5. O come, behold the Works of God,
And then with me you will own,
That he toward all the Sons of Men
Has wondrous Judgments shown.
6. He made the Sea become dry Land,
And through the Flood they walked;
Whilst to each other of his Might
With Joy his People talked.
7. He by his Power for ever rules;
His Eyes the World survey;
Let no Presumptuous Man rebel
Against his sovereign Sway.
PART II.
8, 9. O all ye Nations, bless our God,
And loudly tell his Praise;
Who keeps our Soul alive and still
Confirms our steadfast Ways.
10, 11. For thou have tried us, Lord, as Fir^
Does try the precious Ore^
Thou brought us to the Net, where w^
Oppressing Burdens bore.
12. By Thee permitted, Men did us
Through Fire and Water chase;
But yet at last thou brought us forth
Into a wealthy place.
13, 14. Burnt-off^rings to thy House I Will b^ing,
And there my Vows I Will pay,
Which I with solemn Zeal did make
^n that disastrous day.
15. Then shall the richest Incense smoke,
The fattest Rams shall fall;
The choicest Goats from out the Fold,
And Bullocks from the Stall.
16. O come all ye that fear the Lord,
Attend with heedful Care;
Whilst I what God has done for me,
With grateful Joy declare.
17, 18. As I before his Aid implored,
So now I praise his Name;
Who, if my Heart had harbored Sin,
Would all my Prayers disclaim.
19. But God to me whene're I cried
His gracious Ear did bend;
And to the Voice of my Request
With constant Love attend.
20. Then blessed for ever be my God,
Who never, when I pray,
Withholds his Mercy from my Soul,
Nor turns his Face away.
PSALM LXVII.
1. TO bless thy chosen Race,
In Mercy, Lord, incline;
And cause the Brightness of thy Face
Upon us all to shine.
2. That so thy wondrous Ways
May through the World be known;
Whilst distant Lands glad Tribute pay,
And thy Salvation own.
3. Let differing Nations join
To celebrate thy Fame;
Let all the World, O Lord, combine
To praise thy glorious Name^
4. O let them shout and sing,
Dissolved in pious Mirth,
For Thou, the righteous Judge and King,
Shall govern all the Earth.
5. Let differing Nations join
To celebrate thy Fame;
Let all the World, O Lord, combine
To praise thy glorious Name.
6. Then shall the teeming Ground
A large Increase disclose;
And we with Plenty shall abound,
Which God, our God, bestows.
7. Then God upon our Land
Shall constant Blessings shower;
And all the World in aw shall stand
Of his resistless Power.
PSALM LXVIII.
1. LET God, the God of Battle rise,
And scatter his presumptuous Foes;
Let shameful Rout their Host surprise,
Who spitefully his Power oppose.
2. As Smoke in Tempests Rage is lost,
Or Wax into the Furnace cast,
So let their sacrilegious Host
Before his wrathful Presence waste,
3. But let the Servants of his Will
His Favour's gentle Beams enjoy;
Their upright Heart let Transports ^ill,
And cheerful Songs their Tongue employ^
4. To him your Voice in Anthems raise,
Iehovah's powerful Name he bears:
^n him rejoice, extol his Praise,
Who rides upon high-rowling Spheres.
5. Him, from his Empire of the Skies,
Down, down to Earth Compassion draws
The Orphan's Claim to patronize,
And judge the injured Widow's Cause.
6. It Is God who, from a foreign Soil,
Restores poor Exiles to their Home,
Makes Captives free, and fruitless Toil
Their Proud Oppressors righteous Doom^
7. 'Twas so of old, when thou, O God,
In Person led'st our Armies forth,
Strange Terrors through the Desert spread,
8. Convulsions shook the astonished Earth.
When Lightning's made the Skies distill,
And Heavens high Arches shook with Fear,
How then should Sinai's humble Hill
Of Israel's God the Presence bear?
9. Thy Hand at famisht Earth's Complaint,
Relieved her from celestial Stores;
And when thy Heritage was faint
Refreshed the Drought with plenteous show'rs^
10. Where Salvages had ranged before
At Ease thou made our Tribes reside;
And in the Desert, for the Poor,
Thy generous Bounty did provide.
PART II.
11. Thou gav'st the Word, we sallied forth,
And in that powerful Word o'ercame;
While Virgin-Troops with Songs of Mirth
In state our Conquest did proclaim.
12. Vast Armies by such Generals led,
As yet had never received a Foil,
Forsook their Camp with sudden Dread,
And to our Women left the Spoil.
13. Tho Egypt's Drudges you have been,
Your Armies Wings shall shine more bright
Than Doves in golden Sunshine seen,
Or silvered over with paler Light.
14. 'Twas so when God's Almighty Hand
Over scattered Kings the Conquest won;
Our Troops, drawn up on Iordan's Strand,
High Salmon's glittering Snow out-shone.
15. From thence to Iordan's farther Coast
And Bashan's Hill we did advance:
No more her Height shall Bashan boast,
But that she is God's Inheritance.
16. But wherefore (tho the Honor's great)
Should this, ye Mountains swell your Pride?
For Sion is his chosen Seat,
Where he for ever will reside.
17. His Chariots numberless, his Powers
Are Angel-Hosts that wait his Will;
His Presence now fills Sion's Towers,
^s once i^ honored Sinai's Hill.
18. Ascending high, in Triumph Thou
Captivity have Captive led,
And on thy People did bestow
The Spoil of Armies once their Dread.
Even Rebels shall partake thy Grace,
And humble Proselytes repair
To worship at thy Dewlling Place,
And all the World pay Homage there.
19. For Benefits each Day bestowed
Be daily his great Name adored;
20. Who is our Savior and our God,
Of Life and Death the Sovereign Lord
21. But Justice, for his hardened Foes
Proportioned Vengeance has decreed,
To wound the grizly Head of those
Who in presumptuous Crimes proceed.
22. The Lord has thus, in Thunder, spoke;
As I subdued proud Bashan's King,
Once more I Will break my People's Yoke,
And from the Deep my Servant's bring.
23. Their Feet shall in a Crimson Flood
Of slaughtered Foes be covered over,
Nor Earth receive such impious Blood,
But leave for Dogs the unhallowed Gore.
PART III.
24. When entering to thy blessed Abode,
The wondering Multitude surveyed
Thy pompous State, my King and God,
In Robes of Majesty array'd^
25. Sweet-singing Levites led the Van,
Loud Instruments brought up the Rear;
Between both Troops a Virgin-Train
With Voice and Timbrel charmed the Ear.
26. This was the Burden of their Song,
In full Assemblies bless the Lord,
All, who to Israel's Tribes belong,
The God of Israel's Praise record.
27. Nor little Benjamin alone
From neighboring Bounds did there attend,
Nor only Judah's nearer Throne,
Her Counselors in state did send;
But Zebulon's remoter Seat,
And Nephthali's more distant Coast
(The grand Procession to complete)
Sent up their Tribes, a Princely Host.
28. Thus God to Strength and Union brought
Our Tribes, at Strife till that blessed Hour:
This Work which thou, O God, have wrought,
Confirm, with fresh Recruits of Power.
29. To visit Salem, Lord, descend,
And Sion thy terrestrial Throne;
Where Kings with Presents shall atte^d,
And there with offered Crowns atone.
30. Break down their Spear-mens Ranks tha^ threat
Like pampered Herds of Salvage Might,
Their Silver-armour'd Chiefs defeat
Who in destructive War delight.
31. To God shall Egypt then stretch forth
Her Hands, and Africa Homage bring:
32. The scattered Kingdoms of the Earth
Their common Sovereign's Praises sing.
33. Who mounted on the loftiest Sphere
Of ancient Heaven, sublimely rides;
From whence his dreadful Voice we hear,
Like that of warring Winds and Tides.
34. Ascribe ye Power to God most High,
Of humble Israel he takes Care;
Whose Strength from out the dusky Sky
Darts shining Terrors through the Air.
35. How dreadful are the sacred Courts
Where God has fixed his earthly Throne!
His Strength his feeble Saints supports:
To God give Praise and him alone.
PSALM LXIX.
1. SAve me, O God, from Waves that roll,
And press to overwhelm my Soul.
2. In Mire my found'ring Footsteps tread,
And Deluges overflow my Head.
3. With restless Cries my Spirits faint,
My Voice is hoarse with long Complaint,
My Sight decays with tedious Pain,
Whilst for my God I wait in vain.
4. My Heads unnumber'd Hairs are few,
Compared to Foes that me pursue
With groundless Hate, grown now of might
To execute their lawless Spite.
They force me guiltless to resign
As Rapine, what by right was mine.
5. Thou Lord my Innocence do see,
Nor are my Sins concealed from Thee.
6. Lord God of Hosts take timely care,
Lest for my sake thy Saints despair;
7. Since I have sufferd, for thy Name,
Reproach, and hid my Face in shame.
8. A Stranger to my Country grown,
Nor to my nearest Kindred known;
A Foreigner, exposed to Scorn,
By Brethren of my Mother born.
9. For Zeal to thy loved House and Name
Consumes me like devouring Flame,
Concerned at their Affronts to Thee
Beyond their Slanders cast on me.
10. My very Tears and Abstinence
They construe in a spiteful sense;
11. When clothed with Sack^loth for their sake,
They me their Jest and Proverb make.
12. Their Judges make my Wrongs their Jest,
Those Wrongs they ought to have redrest!
How shall I then expect to be
From Libels of Lewd Drunkards free?
13. But, Lord, to Thee I will repair
For Help, with humble timely Prayer;
Relieve me from thy Mercies store,
Display thy Truth's preserving Power.
14. O save me yet from Dangers Brink,
Nor suffer me in Mire to sink;
From spiteful Foes in Safety keep,
And snatch me from the raging Deep.
15. Control the Deluge ever it spread,
And roll its Waves above my Head;
Nor deep Destruction's yawning Pit
To close her Jaws on me permit.
16. Lord, hear the humble Prayer I make,
For thy transcending Kindness sake;
Relieve thy Suppliant once more
From thy abounding Mercies store.
17. Nor from thy Servant hide thy Face;
Make speed, for desperate is my Case:
18. Thy timely Succor interpose,
And shield me from remorseless Foes.
19. The Slanders, Infamy and Scorn
I from my Enemies have born
Thou know, nor has their open Spite
Or secret Plots escaped thy Sight.
20. Reproach and Grief have broke my Heart,
I looked for some to take my part,
To pity or relieve my Pain,
But looked (alas!) for both in vain!
21. With Hunger pined for Food I call,
Instead of Food they give me Gall;
And when with Thirst my Spirits sink,
They give me Vinegar to drink.
22. Their Table therefore to their Health
Shall prove a Snare, a Trap their Wealth:
23. Perpetual Darkness seize their Eyes,
And sudden Blasts their Hope surprise.
24. On them and theirs thy Fury pour,
And in tempestuous Wrath devour:
25. Their House dis-people to a Cell,
Till none remain therein to dwell.
26. For new Afflictions they procured
For him who had thy Stripes endured;
And made the Wounds thy Scourge had torn
To bleed afresh with sharper Scorn.
27. Let Sin to Sin their steps betray,
Till they to Truth have lost the Way.
28. From Life's bright List exclude their Soul,
Nor with the Just their Names enrol.
29. But me, however distressed and poor,
Thy strong Salvation shall restore:
30. Thy Power with Songs I Will then proclaim,
And celebrate with Thanks thy Name.
31. Our God shall this more highly prize
Than Hecatombs of Sacrifice:
32. Which humble Saints with Joy shall see,
And hope for like Redress with me.
33. For God regards the Poor's Complaint,
Sets Prisoners free from close Restraint:
34. Let Heaven, Earth, Sea their Voices raise,
The Universe resound his Praise.
35. For God will Sion's Walls protect,
Fair Judah's Cities He Will erect,
Till all her scattered Sons repair
To undisturbed possession there;
36. Enjoy for Life, and at their Death
To their religious Heirs bequeath;
And they to endless Ages more,
On such as his blessed Name adore.
PSALM LXX.
1. O Lord, to my Relief draw near,
For never was more pressing Need!
For my Deliverance, Lord, appear,
And add to that Deliverance Speed.
2. Confusion on their Heads return
Who to destroy my Soul combine;
Let them, defeated, blush and mourn,
Ensnared in their own vile Design.
3. Their Doom let Desolation be,
With Shame their Malice be repaid,
Who mocked my Confidence in Thee,
And Sport of my Affliction made.
4. While those who humbly seek thy Face
To joyful Triumphs are uprais'd;
And all who prize thy Saving Grace
Ever resound, The Lord be praised.
5. Thus wretched tho I am and poor,
Of me the Almighty Lord takes care.
Thou, God, who only can restore,
To my Relief with Speed repair.
PSALM LXXI.
1, 2. IN Thee I put my steadfast Trust,
Defend me, Lord, from Shame;
Incline thine Ear, and save my Soul,
For righteous is thy Name.
3. Be thou my strong abiding Place,
To which I may resort;
It Is thy Decree that keeps me safe,
Thou art my Rock and Fort.
4, 5. From cruel and ungodly Men
Protect and set me free,
For from my earliest Youth till now
My Hope has been in Thee.
6. Thy constant Care did safely guard
My tender Infant days;
Thou took'^t me from my Mother's Womb
To sing thy constant Praise.
7, 8.While some with Wonder on me gaze^
Thy Hand supports me still;
Thy Honor therefore and thy praise
My Mouth shall always fill.
9. Reject not then thy Servant, Lord,
When freezing Age prevails;
Forsake me not, when spent with years
My manly Vigor fails.
10. My Foes against my Fame, and me
With crafty Malice speak^
Against my Soul they lay their Snares,
And mutual Counsel take.
11. His God, say they, forsakes him now,
On whom he did rely;
Pursue and take him, whilst no Hope
Of timely Succour's nigh.
12, 13. But thou, my God, withdraw not far^
For speedy Help I call;
To Shame and Ruin bring my Foes
That seek to work my Fall.
14. But as for me, my steadfast Hope
Shall on thy Help depend,
And I in grateful Songs of Praise
My time to come will spend.
PART II.
15. Thy righteous Acts and saving Health
My Mouth shall still declare:
Unable yet to count them all,
Tho summed with utmost Care^
16. By God supported I Will go on,
And in his Strength proceed,
And show how far his Righteousness
All others does exceed.
17. Thou, Lord, have taught me from my Youth
To praise thy glorious Name;
And ever since thy wondrous Works
Have been my constant Theme.
18. Then now forsake me not when I
Am gray and feeble grown,
Till ^ to these and future times,
Thy Strength and Power have shown.
19. How high thy Justice soars, O God!
How great and wondrous are
The mighty Works which thou ha^t done!
Who may with Thee compare!
20. Me whom thy Hand has sorely pressed
Thy Grace shall yet relieve;
And from the lowest Depth of Woe
With tender Care retrieve.
21. Through Thee my time to come shall be
With Power and Greatness crowned,
My future Years shall all rejoice.
With Comfort compassed round.
22. Therefore with Psaltery and Harp
Thy Truth, O Lord, I Will praise;
To Thee, the God of Jacob's Rac^,
My Voice in Anthems raise.
23. Then Joy shall fill my Mouth, and Songs
Employ my cheerful Voice;
My grateful Soul, by Thee redeemed
Shall in thy Aid rejoice.
24. My Tongue thy just and righteous Acts
Shall all the day proclaim;
Because thou did^t confound my Foes
And brought them all to shame.
PSALM LXXII.
1. LOrd, let thy just Decrees the King
In all his Ways Direct;
And let his Son throughout his Reign
Thy righteous Laws respect.
2. So shall he s^ill thy People judge
With pure and upright Mind,
Whilst all the helpless Poor in him
A just Protector find.
3. Then Hills and Mountains shall bring forth
The happy Fruits of Peace;
Which all the Land shall own to be
The Work of Righteousness:
4. Whilst he the poor and needy Race
Shall rule with gentle Sway;
And from their humble Necks shall take
Oppressive Yokes away.
5. In every Heart thy awful Fear
Shall then be rooted fast,
As long as Sun and Moon endure,
Or Time it self shall la^t.
6. He shall descend like Rain that chears
The M^adows second Birth,
Or like warm Showers, whose gentle Drops
Refresh the thirsty Earth.
7. In his blessed days the just and good
Shall be with Favor crowned,
The happy Land shall every where
With endless Peace abound.
8. His uncontrolled Dominion shall
From Sea to Sea extend,
Begin at proud Euphrates Streams,
At Nature's Limits end.
9. To him the salvage Nations round
Shall bow their servile Heads,
His vanquished Foes shall lick the Dust
Where he their Conq'rour treads.
10. The Kings of Tarshish and the Isles
Shall costly Presents bring;
From haughty Persia Gifts shall come,
And from Arabia's King.
11. To him shall every King on Ear^h
His humble Homage pay,
And differing Nations gladly join
To own his righteous Sway.
12. For he shall set the Needy free,
When they for Succor cry;
Shall save the Helpless and the Poor,
And all their Wants supply.
PART II.
13. His Eye the humble patient Man
Indulgently shall spare;
And over his defenseless Life
Shall watch with tender Care.
14. He shall preserve and keep their Souls
From Fraud and Rapin^ free,
And in his sight their guiltless Blood
Of mighty Price shall be.
15. Therefore shall God his Life and Reign
To many Years extend,
Whilst Eastern Princes Tribute pay,
And golden Presents send.
For him shall constant Prayers be made,
And all his prosperous Days,
His just Dominion shall afford
A lasting Theme of Praise.
16. Through all the Land, of useful Grain
Great Plenty shall appear;
A Handful sown on Mountain Tops
A mighty Crop shall bear:
Its Fruit, like Cedars shook by Winds,
A rattling Noise shall yield;
The City too shall thrive, and vie
For Plenty with the Field.
17. To endless Ages shall endure
His great and glorious Name;
As bright and lasting as the Sun,
Shall shine his spotless Fame:
In him the Nations of the World
Shall be completely blessed,
And his unbounded Happiness
By every Tongue confe^t.
18. Then blessed be God, the mighty Lord,
The God whom Israel fears;
Who only wondrous in his Works,
Beyond Compare appears.
19. Let Earth be with his Glory filled;
For ever bless his Name:
Whilst to his Praise the listening World
Their glad assent proclaim.
20. [With this exalted Hymn of Praise
The Prayers and Praises end,
Which holy David, Iesse's Son,
In pious Raptures penned.]
PSALM LXXIII.
1. AT length, by certain proofs it is plain
That God will to his own be kind^
That all, whose Hearts are pure and clean,
Shall his indulgent Favor find,
2, 3. But my unwary Feet before
And stagg'ring Steps had almost failed;
With Pain I viewed the Sinner's store,
And envied when the Fools prevailed.
4, 5. They to the Grave in peace descend,
And whilst they live are hail and strong;
No Plagues or Troubles them offend,
Which ^till to other Men belong.
6, 7. With Pride as with a Chain they are held,
And Rapine is their Robe of State;
Their Eyes stand out, with Fatness swelled,
They grow, beyond their Wishes, great.
8, 9. With Hearts corrupt, and lofty Talk,
Oppressive Methods they defend;
Their Tongue through all the Earth does walk,
Their Blasphemies to Heaven ascend.
10. And yet admiring Crowds are found
Who servile Visits duly make,
Because with Plenty they abound,
Of which their pampered Slaves partake.
11. Their fond Opinions these pursue,
Till they with them profanely cry,
How should the Lord our Actions view,
Can he perceive who dwells on high?
12. Behold the Wicked! these are they
Who openly their Sins profess;
And yet their Wealth's increased each day^
And all their Actions meet Success.
13, 14. Then have I cleans'd my Heart (said I)
And washed my Hands from Guilt in vain,
If all the Day oppressed I lie,
And every Morning suffer Pain.
15. Thus did I once to speak intend;
But if such things I rashly say,
Thy Children, Lord, I must offend,
And basely should their Cause betray.
PART III.
16, 17. To fathom This my Thoughts I bent,
But found the Case too hard for me,
Till to the House of God I went,
Then I their End did plainly see.
18. How high soever advanced, they all
In slippery Places tottering stand;
Thence into Ruin headlong fall,
Cast down by thy avenging Hand.
19, 20. How dreadful and how quick their Fate!
Despised by Thee when they are destroyed;
As waking Men with Scorn do treat
The Fancies that their Dreams employed.
21, 22. Thus was my Heart with Grief opprest^
My Reins were racked with restless Pains,
So foolish was I, like a Beast,
In whom no Thought or Sense remain^.
23, 24. And yet thy Presence cheered me still^
And thy Right Hand did always save;
Thou first did guide me with thy Skill,
And to thy Glory then receive.
25. Whom then in Heaven, but Thee alone^
Have I, whose Favor I require?
And over all the Earth there is none
That I besides Thee can desire.
26. My trembling Flesh and aching Heart
May often fail to succor me;
But God shall inward Strength impart^
And my Eternal Portion be.
27. For they that far from Thee remove^
Shall into sudden Ruin fall;
If after other Gods they rove,
Thy Vengeance shall destroy them all.
28. But as for me, it is good and just
That I should still to God repair;
In him I always put my Trust,
And will his wondrous Works declare.
PSALM LXXIV.
1. WHY have thou cast us off, O God;
Must we no more return?
O why, against thy chosen Flock,
Does thy fierce Anger burn?
2. Think on thy ancient Purchase, Lord,
The Land that is thy own,
By Thee redeemed, and Sion's Mount
Where once thy Glory shone.
3. O come and view our ruined state!
How long our Troubles last!
See! how the Foe with wicked Rage
Has laid thy Temple waste!
4. Thy Foes blaspheme thy Name, where late^
Thy zealous Servants prayed;
Their Banners all, as conquering Signs,
With haughty Pomp displayed.
5, 6. Those curious Carvings which did once
The Workmen famous make,
With Axes and with Hammers now
They all in pieces break.
7. Thy Holy Temple have they burnt;
And what escaped the Flame,
Has been profaned and quite pulled down
Tho sacred to thy Name.
8. Together to destroy us all
Maliciously they aimed;
And all the sacred Places burned
Where we thy Praise proclaimed:
9. Yet of thy Presence thou vouchsaf'st
No tender Signs to send;
We have no Prophet now that knows
When this sad state shall end.
PART II.
10. But, Lord, how long will thou permit
The insulting Foe to boast?
Shall all the Honor of thy Name
For evermore be lost?
11.Why hold'st thou back thy strong Right Hand?
And on thy patient Breast
When Vengeance calls to stretch it forth,
So calmly let'st it rest?
12. Thou heretofore, with Kingly Power,
In our Defense have fought;
For us, throughout the wondering World,
Have great Salvation wrought.
13. 'Twas Thou, O God, that did the Sea
By thy own Strength divide;
Thou break'st the watery Monsters Head,
The Waves o'rwhelm'd their Pride.
14. The greatest, fiercest of them all,
That seemed the Deep to sway;
Was by thy Power destroyed, and made
To salvage Beasts a Prey.
15. Thou clav'^t the solid Rock, and bad'st
The Waters largely flow;
Again, Thou made, through dried up Streams
Thy wondering People go.
16. Thine is the cheerful Day, and thine
The black Return of Night;
Thou have prepared the glorious Sun,
And every feebler Light.
17. By Thee the Borders of the Earth
In perfect order stand;
The Summer's Warmth and Winter's Co^^
Attend on thy Command.
PART III.
18. Remember, Lord, how scornful Foes
Have daily urged our Shame;
And how the foolish People have
Blasphemed thy holy Name.
19. O free thy mourning Turtle-dove,
By sinful Crowds beset;
Nor the Assembly of the Poor
For evermore forget.
20. Thy ancient Covenant, Lord, regard,
And make thy promise good;
For now each Corner of the Land
Is filled with Men of Blood.
21. O let not the Oppressed return,
With Sorrow clothed and Shame;
But let the Helpless, and the Poor
For ever praise thy Name.
22. Arise, O God, in our behalf,
Thy Cause and ours maintain;
Remember how insulting Fools
Each day thy Name profane!
23. Make Thou the Boastings of thy Foes
For ever, Lord, to cease;
Whose haughty Rage and furious Threats
Still more and more increase.
PSALM LXXV.
1. TO Thee, O God, we render Praise,
To Thee with Thanks repair;
For, that thy Name to us is nigh
Thy wondrous Works declare.
2. In Israel when my Thron^ is fixed
With me shall Justice reign:
3. The Land with Discord shakes, but I
The tottering Frame sustain.
4. Deluded Wretches I advised
Their Errors to redress,
Presumptuous Sinners warned that they
Their Swelling Pride suppress.
5. Bear not your selves so high, as if
No Power could yours restrain;
Submit your stubborn Necks, and learn
To speak with less Disdain.
6. For that Promotion, which to gain,
Your vain Ambition strives,
From neither East nor West, nor yet
From Southern Climes arrives.
7. For God the great Disposer is
And Sovereign Judge alone,
Who casts the Proud to Earth, and lifts
The Humble to a Throne.
8. His Hand holds forth a dreadful Cup,
With purple Wine it is crowned;
Filled with Ingredients which his Wrath
Deals out to Nations round.
Of This his darling Saints may taste,
But Wicked Men shall squeeze
The baleful Dregs, and be condemned
To d^ink the very Lees.
9. His Prophet, I to all the World
This Message will relate;
The Justice then of Jacob's God^
My Song shall celebrate.
10. The Wicked's Pride I will reduce,
Their Cruelty disarm;
Exalt the Just, and seat him high,
Above the Reach of Harm.
PSALM LXXVI.
1. IN Judah the Almighty's known,
(Almighty there by Wonders shown)
His Name in Jacob does excel:
2. His Sanctuary in Salem stands,
The Majesty that Heaven commands
In Sion condescends to dwell.
3. He brake the Bow and Arrows there
The Shield, the tempered Sword and Spear,
There slain the mighty Army lay;
4. Whence Sion's Fame through Earth is spread
Of greater Glory greater Dread,
Than Hills where Robbers lodge their Prey.
5. Their valiant Chiefs, who came for Spoil,
Themselves met there a shameful Foil,
Securely down to sleep they lay.
But, waked no more; their stoutest Ba^d
Never lifted one resisting Hand
against his that did their Legions slay.
6. When Jacob's God began to frown
Horse, Horsemen, Chariots were overthrown,
Together hushed in endless Night:
7. When Thou, whom Earth and Heaven revere,
Do once in wrathful Looks appear,
What Mortal Power can stand thy sight^
8. Pronounced from Heaven, Earth heard its Doom,
Grew hushed with Fear, when Thou did come
9. To Judgment, and the Meek restore:
10. The Wrath of Man shall yield Thee Praise
Its proud Reserves but serve to raise
The Triumphs of Almighty Power.
11. Vow to the Lord, ye Nations, bring
Vowed Presents to the eternal King;
Thus to his Name due Reverence pay,
12. Who proudest Potentates can quell,
To Earthly Kings more terrible
Than to their trembling Subjects They.
PSALM LXXVII.
1. TO God I sent my mournful Cry,
Who graciously did hear;
3. In Trouble's dismal Day I sought
My God with humble Prayer.
All Night my fest'ring Wound did run,
No Medicine gave Relief;
My Soul no Comfort would admit,
My Soul indulged her Grief.
3. I thought on God, and Favors past,
But that increased my Pain^
I found my Spirit more oppressed
The more I did complain.
4. Through every watch of tedious Night
Thou keep'st my Eyes awake;
My Grief is swelled to that Excess
I sigh but cannot speak.
5. I call to mind the Days of old
With signal Mercy crowned,
Those famous years of ancient Times
For Miracles renowned.
6. By Night I recollect my Songs
On former Triumphs made,
Then search, consult and ask my Heart
Where Is now that wondrous Aid?
7. Has God for ever cast us off,
Withrawn his Favor quite?
8. Are both his Mercy and his Truth
Re^ir'd to endless Night?
9. Can his long-practis'd Love forget
Its wonted Aids to bring?
Has he in Wrath shut up and sealed
His Mercy's healing Spring?
10. I said my Weakness hints these Fears,
But I Will my Fears disband;
I Will yet remember the most High,
And Years of his Right Hand.
11. I Will call to mind his Works of old,
The Wonders of his Might;
12. On them my Heart shall meditate,
My Tongue shall them recite.
13. Safe lodged from humane Search on high
O God thy Counsels are!
Who is so great a God as Ours?
Who can with him compare?
14. Long since a God of Wonders Thee
Thy rescued People found;
15. Joseph and Israel's Seed thy Arm
With strong Deliverance crowned.
16. When Thee, O God, the Waters saw
The frighted Billows shrunk;
The troubled Depths themselves, for Fea^,
Beneath their Channels sunk.
17. The Clouds poured down, while with their Noise
The rending Skies conspire;
Thy Arrows all abroad were sent,
Winged with avenging Fire.
18. Heaven with thy Thunder's Voice was torn
Whilst all the lower World
With Lightnings blazed; Earth shook and seemed
From her Foundations hurled.
19. Through rolling Seas Thou find'st thy Way,
Thy Paths in waters lie;
Thy wondrous passage, where no Sight
Thy Footsteps can descry.
20. Thou led'st thy People like a Flock,
Conducted by the Hand
Of Moses and of Aaron, safe
To Canaan's promised Land.
PSALM LXXVIII.
1. HEar, O my People; to my Law
Devout Attention lend;
Let the Instruction of my Mouth
Deep in your Hearts descend.
2. My Tongue, by Inspiration taught,
Shall Parables unfold,
Dark Oracles, but understood,
And known for Truths of Old;
3. Which we from sacred Registers
Of ancient Times have known,
Which our Forefathers pious Care
To Us has handed down.
4. We will not hide them from our Sons;
Our Offspring shall be taught
The Praises of the Lord, whose Strength
Has Works of Wonder wrought.
5. With Jacob He this League ordained,
This Law with Israel made,
With Charge to be from Age to Age,
From Race to Race convey'd^
6. That Generations yet to com^
Should to their unborn Heirs
Religiously transmit the same,
And they again to theirs.
7. To teach 'em that in God alone
Their Hope securely stands;
That they should never his Works forge^,
But keep his just Commands.
8. Lest, like their Fathers, they might prov^
A stiff rebellious Race,
False-hearted, fickle to their God,
Unstedfast in his Grace.
9. Such were revolting Ephraim's Tribe^
A Tribe to Warfare bred,
Who, armed with Bows and Archers skill^d,
From Field ignobly fled.
10, 11. They falsify'd their League with God,
His Orders dis-obey'd;
Forgot his Works and Miracles
Before their Eyes displayed.
12. Nor Wonders, which their Fathers s^^^
Did they in Mind retain;
Prodigious things in Egypt done,
And Zoan's fertile Plain.
13. He cut the Seas to let 'em pass,
Restrained the pressing Floo^^
While pil'd in Heaps, on either ^ide,
The wondering Waters stood.
14. He led 'em by a Prodigy
Composed of Shade and Light;
A sheltering Cloud it proved by Day,
A leading Fire by Night.
15. With Drought afflicted, where no Stream
The Wilderness supplied,
He cleft the Rock, whose flinty Breast
Dissolved into a Tide.
16. Streams from the solid Rock he brought,
Which down in Rivers fell,
That, trav'ling with their Camp, each day
Renewed the Miracle.
17. Yet there they sinned against him more,
Provoking the Most High,
In that same Desert where he did
Their fainting Souls supply.
18. They first incensed him in their Hearts
That craved for stronger Meat,
Not moved by Hunger, but their Lust
Luxuriously to treat.
19. Then uttered their blaspheming Doubts,
Can God, said they, prepare
A Table in the Wilderness,
Set out with various Fare?
20. He smote the Flinty Rock ('it is true)
And gushing Streams ensued,
But can He Corn and Flesh provide
For such a Multitude?
21. The Lord with Indignation heard;
From Heaven avenging Flame
On Jacob fell, consuming Wrath
On thankless Israel came.
22. Because their unbelieving Hearts
In God would not confide,
Who had from Heavens own Granary
Their Wants so often supplied.
23. Tho he had made his Clouds discharge
Provisions down in Showers;
And, when Earth failed, relieved their Needs
From his celestial Stores.
24. Tho tastful Manna had rained down
Their Hunger to relieve.
Tho from the Stores of Heaven they did
Sustaining Corn receive.
25. And thus with Angels sacred Food
Ungrateful Man was fed,
Not sparingly, for still they found
A plenteous Table spread.
26. From Heaven he made an East Wind blow
And next the South commands
27. To rain down Flesh like Dust, and Fowls
Like Seas unnumb'red Sands.
28. Within their Trenches he let fall
The luscious easy Prey,
And all around their spreading Camp
The feathered Booty lay.
29. They fed, were filled, he gave 'em leave
Their Appetites to feast;
30, 31. Yet still their wanton Lust gorged on,
Nor with their Hunger ceased.
But whilst in their luxurious Mouths.
They did their Dainties chew,
The Wrath of God smote down their Chiefs,
And Israel's chosen slew.
PART II.
32. Yet still they sinned, nor would affor^
His Miracle Belief;
33. Therefore through fruitless Travels, he
Consumed their Lives in Grief.
34. When some were slain, the rest returned
To God with early Cry;
35. Own him the Rock of their Defense,
Their Savior, God most High.
36. But this was feigned Submission all
Their Heart their Tongue belied;
37. Their Hearts were still perverse, nor would
Firm in his League abide.
38. Yet, full of Mercy, he forgave,
Nor did with Death chastise;
Often turned his kindled Wrath aside.
Or suffered not to rise.
39. For he remembered they were Flesh
That could not long remain;
A murmuring Wind that is quickly past
And never returns again.
40. How often did they provoke him there,
How often his Patience grieve,
In that same Desert where he did
Their fainting Souls relieve?
41. They tempted him by turning back,
And gracelesly repined,
When Israel's God refused to be
By their Desires confined.
42. Nor called to mind the Hand and Day
That their Redemption brought;
43. His Signs in Egypt, wondrous Works
In Zoan's Valley wrought.
44. He turned their Rivers into Blood
That Man and Beast forbore,
And rather chose to die of Thirst
Than drink the putrid Gore.
45. He sent devouring Swarms of Flies,
Hoarse Frogs annoyed their Soil;
46. Locusts and Caterpillars reaped
The Harvest of their Toil.
47. Their Vines with batt'ring Hail, with Frost
The Tender Fig Tree dies;
48. Lightning and Hail made Flocks and Herds
One general Sacrifice.
49. He turned his furious Anger loose,
No time prescribed to cease;
And, with their Plagues, ill Angels sent
Their Torments to increase.
50. He opened a Passage to his Wrath,
To ravage uncontrol'd;
The Murrain on their Firstlings s^iz'd
In every Field and Fold^
51. From Beast to Man the deadly Pest,
From Field to City came;
It slew their Heirs^ their eldest Hopes,
Through all the Tents of Ham.
52. But his own Tribes^ like folded Sheep,
He brought from their Distress,
And, like a Flock, conducted through
The pathless Wilderness.
53. He led 'em on, and in their way.
No cause of Fear they found;
But marched securely through those Deeps
In which their Foes were drowned.
54. Nor ceased his Care till them he brought
Into his promised Land,
His Sanctu'ry and Mount, the Prize
Of his victorious Hand.
55. To them the Outcast Heathen's Land
He did by Lot divide;
And safe in their abandoned Tents
Made Israel's Tribes reside.
PART III.
56. Yet still they tempted, still provoked
The Wrath of God most High;
Nor would to practice his Commands
Their stubborn Hearts apply.
57. But in their faithless Father's Steps
Perversely chose to go;
They turned aside, like Arrows shot
From some deceitful Bow.
58. For him to Fury they provoked,
With Altars set on high;
And with their graven Images
Inflamed his Jealousy.
59. When God heard this, on Israel's Tribes
His Wrath and Hatred fell;
60. He quitted Shilo and the Tents
Where once he chose to dwell.
61. To vile Captivity his Ark,
His Glory to Disdain,
62. His People to the Sword he gave,
Nor would his Wrath restrain.
63. Destructive War their ablest Youth
Untimely did confound;
No Virgin was to the Altar led,
With nuptial Garlands crowned.
64. In Fight the Sacrificer fell,
The Priest a Victim bled;
Widows, that should their Fun'rals mourn,
Themselves of Grief were dead.
65. Then, like a Giant fresh from Sleep,
Or Wine's inspiring Charms,
The Lord awaked, and shouting loud
The trembling Foe alarms.
66. He smote their Host, that home from Field
A scattered Remnant came,
With Wounds, imprinted on their Backs,
Of everlasting Shame.
67. With Conquest crowned, He, Ioseph's Tents
And Ephraim's Tribe forsook;
68. But Judah chose, and Sion's Mount
For his loved Dwelling took.
69. His Temple He erected there,
Whose Head confronts the Skies,
While deep and fixed, as that of Earth,
The strong Foundation lies.
70. His faithful Servant David too
He for his Choice did own,
And from the Sheep-folds him advanced
To sit on Judah's Throne.
71. From tending on the teeming Ews
He brought him forth to feed
His own Inheritance, the Tribes
Of Israel's chosen Seed.
72. Exalted thus, the Monarch proved
A faithful Shepherd still.
He fed them with an Upright Heart,
And guided them with Skill.
PSALM LXXIX.
1. BEhold, O God, the Heathen have
On thy Possession seized;
Thy sacred House have they defiled,
Thy holy City razed.
2. The mangled Bodies of thy Saints
Abroad unburied lay;
Their Flesh exposed to salvage Beasts,
And ravenous Birds of Prey.
3. Quite through Ierus'lem was their Blood
Like Common Water shed;
And none were left alive to pay
Last Duties to the Dead.
4. The neighboring Lands our small Remains
With loud Reproaches wound;
We Are made a Laughing Stock and Scorn
To all the Nations round.
5. How long will Thou be angry, Lord,
Must we for ever mourn?
Shall thy devouring jealous Rage
Like Fire, for ever burn?
6. On Foreign Lands, that know not Thee,
Thy heavy Vengeance shower,
Those sinful Kingdoms let it crush
That have not owned thy Power.
7. For they their greedy Throats have gorg'^
With Jacob's chosen Race.
And to a barren Desert turned
Their fruitful Dewlling Place,
8. O think not on our former Sins,
But speedily preven^
Thy Suffering People's utter Loss,
Almost with Sorrow spent.
9. O God our Savior, help and save,
And free our Souls from blame;
So shall our Pardon and Defense
Exalt thy glorious Name.
10. Let Infidels, that scoffing say,
Where is the God they boast?
In Vengeance for thy slaughtered Saints
Perceive thee to their Cost.
11. Lord, hear the sighing Pris'ner's moan,
And as thy Power is great;
Preserve the Wretches doomed to die,
From that untimely Fate.
12. On our oppressive Neighbors let
Our Sufferings be repaid;
Make their Confusion sev'n times more
Than what on us they laid.
13. So we thy People and thy Flock
Shall ever praise thy Name;
And with glad Hearts our grateful Thanks
From Age to Age proclaim.
PSALM LXXX.
1. O Israel's Shepherd, Jacob's Guide,
Whom like a Sheep thou leadst, give ear;
Thou that do on the Cherubs ride,
Again in solemn State appear.
2. Behold, how Benjamin expects,
With Ephraim and Manasseh joined,
In our Deliverance the Effects
Of thy resistless Strength to find.
3. Do thou convert us, Lord, do thou
The luster of thy Face display;
And all the Ills we suffer now
Like scattered Clouds shall pass away.
4. O Thou, whom heavenly Hosts obey,
How long shall thy fierce Anger burn?
How long thy suffering People pray,
And yet their Prayers meet no Return.
5. Thou, when we are hungry make us drench
Our scanty Food in Floods of Woe;
When dry, our raging Thirst we quench
With Streams of Tears that largely flow.
6. For us the Heathen Nations round
As for a certain Prey, contest;
Our Foes with spiteful Joy abound
And at our lost Condition jest.
7. Do thou convert us Lord, do thou
The Luster of thy Face display;
And all the Ills we suffer now,
Like scattered Clouds shall pass away.
PART II.
8. Thou brought a Vine from Egypt's land;
And casting out the Heathen Race,
Did plant it with thy own Right Hand,
And firmly fix it in their Place.
9. Before it thou prepar'dst the Way,
And made it take a lasting Root,
Which blessed with thy indulgent Ray
Over all the Land did widely shoot.
10, 11. The Hills were covered with its Shade,
Her goodly Boughs did Cedars seem;
Her Branches to the Sea were spread,
And reached to proud Euphrates Stream.
12. Why then have Thou its Hedge o'rthrown,
Which thou had made so firm and strong?
Whilst all its Grapes, defenseless grown,
Are plucked by those that pass along.
13. See how the brist'ling Forest Boar
With dreadful Fury lays it waste;
Hark how the salvage Monsters roar,
And to their helpless Prey make haste,
PART III.
14. To Thee, O God of Hosts, we pray:
Thy wonted Goodness, Lord, renew:
From Heaven, thy Throne, this Vine survey,
And her sad State with Pity view.
15. Behold the Vineyard, made by Thee,
Which thy Right Hand did guard so long;
And keep that Branch from Danger free,
Which for thy self thou made so strong.
16. To wasting Flames it is made a Prey,
And all its spreading Boughs cut down;
At thy Rebuke they soon decay,
And perish at thy mortal Frown.
17. Crown thou the King with good Success,
By thy Right Hand secured from Wrong;
The Son of Man in Mercy bless
Whom for thy self thou made so strong.
18. So will we still continue free
From whatsoever deserves thy blame;
And if once more revived by Thee
Will always praise thy holy Name.
19. Do thou convert us, Lord, do thou
The Luster of thy Face display;
And all the ^lls we suffer now
Like scattered Clouds shall pass away.
PSALM LXXXI.
1. TO God our never-failing Strength,
With loud Applauses sing;
And jointly make a cheerful Noise
To Jacob's awful King.
2. Compose a Hymn of Praise, and touch
Your ^nstruments of Joy;
Let Psalteries and pleasant Harps
Your grateful skill employ.
3. Let Trumpets at the Great New-Moo^
Their joyful Voices raise,
To celebrate the appointed time,
The solemn Day of Praise.
4. For this a Statute was of old,
Which Jacob's God decreed
To be with pious Care observed
By Isr'el's chosen Seed.
5. This He for a Memorial fixed
When freed from E^ypt's Land,
Strange Nations barbarous Speech we heard,
But could not understand.
6. Your burdened Shoulders I relieved,
(Thus seems our God to say)
Your servile Hands by me were freed
From laboring in the Clay.
7. With Troubles quite oppressed, on me
Your Ancestors did call;
With Pity ^ their Sufferings saw,
And set them free from all.
In Thunder from my secret Place
My frequent Answers came;
And I their Faith and Duty tried,
At that contentious Stream.
PART II.
8. While I my solemn Will declare,
My chosen People, hear;
If thou, O Israel, to my Words
Wilt bend thy listening Ear;
9. Then shall no God besides my self
Within thy Coasts be found;
Nor shall thou worship any God
Of all the Nations round.
10. The Lord thy God am I, who thee
Brought forth from Egypt's Land;
It Is ^, that all thy just Desires
Supply with liberal Hand.
11. But they, my chosen Race, refused
To hearken to my Voice,
Nor would rebellious Isr'el's Sons
Make me their happy Choice.
12. So I, provoked by their Neglect,
To all their Lusts gave way,
And in their own perverse Designs,
I suffered them to stray:
13. O that my People wisely would
My just Commandments heed!
And Israel in my righteous ways
With pious care proceed!
14. Then should my heavy Judgments fall
On all that them oppose,
And my avenging Hand be turned
Against their numerous Foes.
15. The Haters of the Lord should all
Before his Footstool bend;
But as for them, their happy State
Should never know an end.
16. All parts with Plenty should abound;
And I with ^inest Wheat,
And Honey from the Rock, would them
In great abundance treat.
PSALM LXXXII.
1. GOD in the great Assembly stands
Where his impartial Eye
In state surveys the Earthly Gods,
And does their Judgments try.
2, 3. How dare you then unjustly judge,
Or be to Sinners kind?
Defend the Orphans and the Poor,
Let such your Justice find.
4. Protect the humble helpless Man,
That Is plunged in deep Distress,
And let not him become a Prey
To such as would oppress.
5. They neither know nor will they learn,
But blindly rove and stray;
Justice and Truth, the World's great Props,
Through all the Land decay.
6. Well then may God in anger say,
I Have called you by my Name,
I Have said you are Gods the Sons and Heirs
Of my immortal Fame.
7. But ne'ertheless your unjust Deeds
To strict account I Will call;
You all shall die like common Men,
Like other Tyrants fall.
8. Arise, and thy just Judgments, Lord,
Throughout the Earth display;
And all the Nations of the World
Shall own thy righteous Sway.
PSALM LXXXIII.
1. HOld not thy peace, O Lord our God,
No longer silent be;
Nor with consenting quiet Looks
Our Ruin calmly see!
2. For ^o! the Tumults of thy Foes
Over all the Land are spread;
And they which hate thy Saints and Thee
Lift up their threatening Head.
3. Against thy zealous People, Lord,
They craftily combine;
And to destroy thy chosen Saints
Have laid their close Design.
4. Come, let us cut them off, say they,
Their Nation quite deface;
That no remembrance any more
May be of Isr'el's Race.
5. Thus they against thy People's Peace
Consult with one Consent;
And differing Nations jointly leagued
Their common Hatred vent.
6. The Ishm'elites that dwell in Tents
With warlike Edom joined,
And Moab's Sons our Ruin vow
With Hagar's Race combined:
7. Proud Ammon's Offspring^ Gebal too,
With Amalek conspire;
The Lords of Pal^estine, and all
The wealthy Sons of Tire:
8. All these the strong Assyrian King
Their firm Ally have got,
Who with a powerful Army aids
The incestuous Race of Lot,
PART II.
9. But let such Vengeance come to them
As once t^ ^^idian came,
To Iabin and proud Sisera
At Kishon's fatal Stream.
10. When thy Right Hand their numerous Hosts
Near Endor did confound,
And their Dead Bodies, left for Dung,
Manured the neighboring Ground.
11. Let all their mighty Men the Fate
Of Zeb and Oreb share;
As Zebah and Zalmunnah, so
Let all their Princes fare.
12. Who with the same Design inspired,
Thus vainly boasting spoke,
In firm possession for our selves
Let us God's Houses take.
13. O make them all like Wheels, my God,
Which downwards swiftly move;
Like Chaff that is tossed by Winds, let all
Their scattered Forces prove.
14, 15. As Flames consume dry Wood, or Heath
That on parched Mountains grows,
So let thy fierce pursuing Wrath
With Terror strike thy Foes.
16, 17. Lord, shroud their Faces with Disgrace
That they may own thy Name;
Or, quite con^ounded, Victims fall
At once to Grief and Shame.
18. That so the wondering World may know,
That Thou whose Name alone
Jehovah is, over all the Earth
Have raised thy lofty Throne.
PSALM LXXXIV.
1. O God of Hosts, the mighty Lord,
How lovely is the Place
Where Thou, enshrined in Glory, show
The Brightness of thy Face!
2. My longing Soul faints with Desire,
To view thy blessed abode;
My panting Heart and Flesh cry out
For Thee the living God.
3. The Birds, more happy far than I,
About thine Altars rest;
There lay their little Young, and there
Securely build their Nest.
O Lord of Hosts, my King and God,
4. How highly blessed are They,
Who in thy Temple always dwell,
And there thy Praise display!
5. Thrice happy they, whose Choice has Thee
Their sure Protection made;
Who long to tread the sacred ways
That to thy Dwelling lead!
6. Who pass through Baca's thirsty Vale,
Yet no Refreshments want;
Their Pools being filled with Rain, which Thou
At their Request do grant.
7. Thus with unwearied Strength and Pains
They still approach more near;
Till all on Sion's holy Mount,
Before their God appear.
8. O Lord, the mighty God of Hosts
My just Request regard;
Thou God of Jacob, let my Prayer
Be still with Favor heard.
9. Behold, O God, for thou alone
Do timely Aid dispense;
On thy anointed Servant look,
Be Thou his strong Defense.
10. For in thy Courts one single Day
It Is better to attend;
Than any other where besides,
A thousand Days to spend.
Much rather would I in God's House
The meanest Office take,
Than in the Tents of Wickedness
My constant Dwelling make.
11. For God is both our Sun and Shield,
He Will Grace and Glory give;
And no good thing will he withold
From them that justly live.
12. O God, whom heavenly Hosts obey.
How highly blessed is he
Whose constant Trust, securely plac'd^
Is still reposed on Thee!
PSALM LXXXV.
1. LOrd, thou have granted to thy Land
The Favors we implored;
And faithful Jacob's captive Race
Have graciously restored.
2, 3. Thou have forgiven thy People's Sins
And all their Guilt defaced;
Thou have not let thy Wrath flame on,
Nor thy fierce Anger last.
4. O God our Savior, all our Hearts
To thy Obedience turn,
That so thy Rage, extinguished now,
Again may never burn.
5, 6. For why should Thou be angry still,
And Wrath so long retain?
O soon revive us that thy Saints
May speedy Comfort gain!
7. Thy gracious Favor, Lord, display,
Which we so long implored;
And for thy wondrous Mercies sake
Thy wonted Aid afford.
8. God's Answer patiently I Will wait,
For he his Saints will bless
(^f they no more to Folly turn)
With Peace and good Success.
9. To all that fear his holy Name
His sure Salvation's near;
That in its former happy state
Our Nation may appear.
10. For Mercy now with Truth is joined;
And Righteousness and Peace,
Like kind Companions absent long,
With friendly Arms embrace.
11, 12. Truth from the Earth shall spring, from Heaven
Shall Streams of Justice pour;
And God, from whom all Goodness flows,
Shall endless Plenty shower.
13. Before him Righteousness shall march^
And his just Paths prepare;
Whilst we his holy Steps pursue,
With constant Zeal and Care.
PSALM LXXXVI.
1. TO my Complaint, O Lord my God,
Thy gracious Ear incline;
Hear me, distressed and destitute
Of all Reli^f but thine^
2. Do Thou, O God, preserve my Soul
That does thy Name adore.
Thy Servant keep, and him, whose Trust
Relies ^n Thee, restore.
3. To me^ who daily Thee invoke,
Thy Mercy, Lord extend:
4. Rejoice thy Servant's Soul, a Soul
That does on Thee depend.
5. Thou, Lord, art good, nor only good,
But prompt to pardon too;
Of ^lenteous Mercy to all those
Who ^or thy Mercy sue.
6. To my repeated Suppliant Prayer,
O Lord, attentive be!
7. In Trouble on thy Name I Will call,
For Thou will answer me.
8. Among the Gods is none like Thee,
O Lord, alone divine!
To Thee as much Inferior they,
As are their Works to thine.
9. Therefore their great Creator Thee
The Nations shall adore,
Their long misguided Prayers and Prais^
To thy blessed Name restore.
10. All shall confess Thee great, and gre^^
The Wonders thou have done:
Confess Thee God, the God supreme^
Confess Thee God alone.
PART II.
11. Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I
From Truth shall never depart;
In reverence to thy sacred Name
Devoutly fix my Heart.
12. Thee will I praise, O Lord my God,
Praise Thee with Heart sincere;
And to thy everlasting Name
Eternal Trophies rear.
13. Thy boundless Mercy shown to m^
Transcends my Power to tell,
For Thou have often redeemed my Soul
From lowest depths of Hell.
14. O God, the Proud are risen, the Sons
Of Strife my soul have sought;
Regardless of thy Power, that often
Has my Deliverance wrought.
15. When they remorseless were, Thou, Lord,
Did^t full Compassion bring;
Of Patience, Mercy, and of Truth,
Thou everlasting Spring!
16. O turn to me; thy Grace and Strengt^
To me thy Servant show;
Thy kind Protection, Lord, on me
Thy Handmaid's Son bestow.
17. Some Signal give, which my proud Foes^
May see with Shame and Rage,
Because Thou, Lord, for my Relief
And Comfort do engage.
PSALM LXXXVII.
1. GOD's Temple crowns the Holy Mount;
The Lord there condescends to dwell:
2. His Sion's Gates, in his Account,
Our Israel's fairest Tents excel.
3. Fame glorious things of Thee shall sing,
O City of the almighty King!
4. The Fame of Rahab I will raise,
In Babylon's Appl^use conspire;
Nor d^rogate from the just Praise
Of AE^hiop, Pal^stine and Tire;
Among^ 'em such a Person born,
His Age and Country did adorn.
5. But still of Sion I Will averr
That many such from her proceed^
The Almighty shall establish her.
6. His general List shall show, when read,
That such a Person there was born,
And such did such an Age adorn.
7. He Will Sion find with Numbers filled
Of such as merit high Renown;
For Hand and Voice Musicians skilled,
And (her transcending Fame to crown)
Of such she shall Successions bring,
Like Waters from a living Spring.
PSALM LXXXVIII.
1. TO Thee my God and Savior I
By day and night address my Cry^
2. Permit my mournful Voice access,
Incline thine Ear to my Distress.
3. For Seas of Trouble me invade,
My Soul draws nigh to Death's cold s^a^^^
4. Like one whose Stre^g^h and Hopes are ^le^
They number me among the Dea^.
5. Like those who shrouded in the Grave,
From Thee no more Remembrance have;
Ca^t down from thy su^^aining Care
6. To lowest Depths of dark Despair.
7. Thy Wrath has hard upon me lain,
Af^licting me with restless Pain;
Me all thy Mountain Waves have pre^^^^,
Too weak alas to bear the lea^t.
8. Removed from Friends, I sigh alone,
In a loathed Dungeon laid, where none
A Visit will vouchsafe to me,
Confined past Hopes of Liberty.
9. My Eyes from weeping never cease,
They waste, but still my Griefs increase!
Yet daily, Lord, to Thee I Have prayed,
With out-stretcht Hands invoked thy Aid.
10. Will thou by miracle revive
The Dead whom thou forsook'st Alive?
From Death restore thy Praise to sing,
Whom thou from Prison would not bring?
11. Shall the mute Grave thy Love confess?
A mold'ring Tomb thy Faithfulness;
12. Thy Truth and Power Renown obtain,
Where Darkness and Oblivion reign?
13. To Thee, O Lord, I cry, forlorn,
My Prayer prevents the early Morn?
14. Why have thou, Lord, my Soul forsook,
Nor once vouchsafed a gracious Look?
15. Prevailing Sorrows bear me down,
Which from my Youth with me have grown,
Thy Terrors past distract my Mind,
And Fears of blacker Days behind.
16. Thy Wrath has burst upon my Head,
Thy Terrors fill my Soul with Dread;
17. Environed as with Waves combined,
And for a general Deluge joined.
18. My Lovers, Friends, Familiars, all
Removed from sight and out of call;
To dark Oblivion all retired,
Dead, or at least to me expired.
PSALM LXXXIX.
1. THY Mercies, Lord, shall be my Song^
My Song on them shall ever dwell;
To Ages yet Unborn my Tongue
Thy never-failing Truth shall tell.
2. I have affirmed, and still maintain,
Thy Mercy shall for ever last;
Thy Truth, that does the Heavens sustain,
Like them shall stand for ever fast.
3. Thus spak'st Thou, by thy Prophet's voice,
With David I a League have made,
To him, my Servant and my Choice,
By solemn Oath this Grant conveyed,
4. While Earth, and Seas, and Skies endure
Thy Seed shall in my sight remain;
To them thy Throne I will ensure;
They shall to endless Ages reign.
5. For such stupendous Truth and Love
Both Heaven and Earth just Praises ow,
By Choirs of Angels sung above,
And by assembled Saints below.
6. What Seraph of celestial Birth
To vie with Heavens Supreme shall dare?
7. Or who, among the Gods of Earth,
With our Almighty Lord compare?
8. Lord God of Armies, who can boast
Of Strength or Pow'r^ like thine, r^nown'd?
Of such a numerous faithful Host,
As that which does thy Throne surround?
9. Thou do the lawless Sea control,
And change the Prospect of the Deep;
Thou make the sleeping Billows roll,
Thou make the rolling Billows sleep.
10. Thou break'st in pieces Rahab's Pride,
And did oppressing Power disarm;
Thy scattered Foes have dearly tried
The Force of thy resis^less Arm.
11. In Thee the sovereign Right remains
Of Earth and Heaven; Thee, Lord, alone
The World, and all the World contains,
Their Maker and Preserver own.
12. The Poles on which the Globe does rest
Were formed by thy creating Voice;
T^bor and Hermon, East and West,
In thy sustaining Power rejoice.
13. Thy Arm is mighty, strong thy Ha^d^
Yet, Lord, thou do with Justice reign;
14. Possessed of absolute Command,
Thou Truth and Mercy do maintain.
15. Happy, thrice happy they who hear
Thy sacred Trumpet's joyful Sound;
Who may at Festivals appear,
With thy most glorious Presence crown'd^
16. With Triumph they shall be o'erjoy'd
Who on thy sacred Name rely.
And, in thy Righteousness employed,
Above their Foes exalted high.
17. For in thy Strength they shall advance,
Their Conquests from thy Favor spring^
18. The Lord of Hosts is our Defense,
And Israel's God our Israel's King.
19. Thus spak'st Thou, by thy Prophet's voic^,
A mighty Champion I will send,
From Judah's Tribe have I made choice
Of one who shall the rest defend.
20. My Servant David I have found,
With holy Oil anointed him;
21. Him shall the Hand support that crowned,
And guard, that gave the Diadem.
22. No Prince from him shall Tribute force,
Nor Son of Violence annoy;
23. Before his Face will I disperse,
And all his spiteful Foes destroy.
24. My Truth and Grace shall him sustain,
His Arms through my auspicious Beams,
25. Shall conquer, from the Tyrian Main
To Tigris and Euphrates Streams.
26. Me for his Father he shall take,
His God and Rock of Safety call;
27. And him my firstborn Son I Will make,
The Kings of Earth his Subjects all.
28. My Mercy shall to him secure,
My Covenant stand for ever fast;
29. His Seed for ever shall endure,
His Throne till Heaven dissolves shall last;
PART II.
30. But if his Heirs my Law forsake,
And from my sacred Precepts stray,
31. If they my righteous Statutes break,
Nor strictly my Commands obey,
32. Their Sins I Will visit with a Rod,
And for their Folly make them smart;
33. Yet will not cease to be their God,
Nor from my Truth, like them, depart^
34. My Covenant I will never revoke,
But in remembrance fast retain;
The thing that once my Lips have spoke
Shall in eternal Force remain.
35. Once have I sworn, but once for all,
And made my Holiness the Tie,
That I my Grant will never recall,
Nor to my Servant David lie.
36. Whose Throne and Race the constant Sun
Shall, like his Course, established see;
37. Of this my Vow, thou conscious Moon,
In Heaven my faithful Witness be.
38. Such was thy gracious Promise, Lord,
But thou alas have now forsook.
Thy own Anointed have abhorred,
And turned on him thy wrathful Look.
39. Thou have repealed, and rendered void
The Covenant with thy Servant made,
His Crown and Dignity destroyed,
And in the Dust his Honor laid.
40. Of Strongholds thou have him bere^t,
Reduced his Bulwarks to decay,
41. His Frontier-Coasts defenseless left,
A public Scorn and common Prey.
42. His Ruin does glad Triumphs yield
To Foes advanced by Thee to Might;
43. Thou have his conquering Sword unsteel'd,
His Valor turned to shameful Flight.
44. His Glory is to Darkness fled,
His Throne is levelled with the Ground:
45. His Youth to wretched Bondage led,
With Shame overwhelmed and Sorrow drowned.
46. How long shall we thy Absence mourn?
Will thou for ever, Lord retire?
Shall thy consuming Anger burn
Till that and we at once expire?
47. Consider, Lord, how short a space
Thou do for Mortal Life ordain;
No Method to prolong the Race,
But loading it with Grief and Pain?
48. What Son of Nature can control
Strict Death's unalterable Doom?
Or rescue from the Grave his Soul?
The Grave that must Mankind entomb.
49. Lord, where is thy Love, thy boundless Grace,
The Oath to which thy Truth did seal,
Consigned to David and his Race,
The Grant which Time should never repeal?
50. See how thy Servants treated are
With Infamy, Reproach and Spite;
Which in my Silent Breast I bear
From Nations of licentious Might;
51. How They, reproaching thy great Name
Make ^hy Anointed's Hope their Jest:
52. Yet thy ju^t Praises we'll proclaim,
And ever sing, The Lord be Blessed.
Amen, Amen.
PSALM XC.
1. O Lord, the Savior and Defense
Of us thy chosen Race,
From Age to Age thou still have been
Our sure Abiding-place.
2. Before thou brought the Mountains forth,
Or Earth and World did frame,
Thou always were the mighty God,
And ever art the same.
3. Thou turnest Man, O Lord, to Dust,
Of which he first was made;
And when thou speak'^t the word, Return,
It Is punctually obeyed.
4. For in thy sight a thousand Years
Are like a Day that is past,
Or like a Watch in dead of night,
Whose Hours unminded waste.
5. Thou with a Torrent sweep'st them off,
They vanish like a Dream,
At first they grow like Grass that feels
The Sun's reviving Beam.
6. But howsoever fresh and fair
Its Morning Beauty shows;
It Is all cut down and withered quite
Before the Evening's close.
7, 8. For by thine Anger we are consumed,
And by thy Wrath dismayed;
Our public Cr^mes and secret Sins
Are in thy presence laid.
9. Beneath thy Anger's sad Effects
Our drooping Days we spend;
Our unregarded Years break off,
Like Tales that quickly end.
10. Our Stint of Time is seventy Years^
And longer few survive;
But if, with more than common Strength,
To eighty we arrive;
Yet then our boasted Strength decays,
To Sorrow turned and Pain;
So soon the slender Thread is c^t,
And we no more remain.
PART II.
11. But who thy Anger's dread Effects
Does as he ought revere?
And yet thy Wrath does fall or rise;
As more or less we fear.
12. So teach us, Lord, of our short Days
The trifling Sum to mind:
That to true Wisdom all our Hearts
May ever be inclined.
13. O to thy Servants, Lord, return,
And speedily relent!
As we of our Misdeeds, do thou
Of our just Doom repent.
14. To satisfy and cheer our Souls
Thy early Mercy send;
That all our Days to come we may
In Joy and Gladness spend.
15. Let joyful Times, with large amends
Dry up our former Tears;
Or equal, at the least, the Term
Of our afflicted Years.
16. To all thy Servants, Lord, let this
Thy wondrous Work be known,
And to their Sons thy Glorious Power
Abundantly be shown.
17. Let thy bright Rays upon us shine,
And give our Work Success;
Whatever Work we undertake
With thy Assistance bless.
PSALM XCI.
1. HE that has God his Guardian made,
Shall, under the Almighty's Shade^
Secure and undisturbed abide.
2. With grateful Joy of him I Will say,
He is my Fortress and my Stay,
My God in whom I Will still confide.
3. His tender Love and watchful Care
Shall free thee from the Fowler's Snare,
And from the noisome Pestilence:
4. He over thee his Wings shall spread,
And cover thy unguarded Head;
His Truth shall be thy strong Defense.
5. No Terrors that surprise by Night
Shall thy undaunted Courage fright,
Nor deadly Shafts that fly by Day;
6. Nor Plague of unknown Rise that kills
In Darkness, nor infectious Ills
That in the hottest Season slay.
7. A thousand at thy side shall die,
At thy Right Hand ten thousand lie,
While thy firm Health untouched remains,
8. Thou only shall look on, and see
The Wicked's deserved Tragedy,
And count the Sinner's mournful Gains.
9. Because with well-plac'd Confidence,
Thou make the Lord thy sure Defense,
And on the Highest do rely;
10. Therefore no Ill shall thee befall,
Nor to thy healthful Dwelling shall
Any infectious Plague draw nigh.
11. For he, throughout thy happy Days,
To keep thee safe in all thy ways,
Shall give his Angels strict Commands,
12. And they, lest any time thou meet
A rugged Stone to wound thy Feet,
Shall bear thee safely in their Hands.
13. Dragons and Asps that thirst for Blood,
And Lions roaring for their Food,
Beneath his conquering Feet shall lie.
14. Because he placed his Love on me,
And owned my Name, I Will set him free
And fix his glorious Throne on high.
15. He Will call; I Will answer when he calls,
And rescue him when ill befalls;
Till full of Honor and of Wealth.
16. When he with undisturbed Content
A long and happy Life has spent,
His end I Will crown with saving Health.
PSALM XCII.
1. HOW good and pleasant must it be
To thank the Lord most high;
And with repeated Hymns of Praise
His Name to magnify.
2. With every Morning's early dawn,
His Goodness to relate;
And of his constant Truth each Night.
The glad effects repeat.
3. To ten-string'd Instruments we'll sing,
With tuneful Psalt'ry's joined;
And to the Harp, with solemn Sounds,
For sacred use designed.
4. For through thy wondrous Works, O Lord,
Thou make my Heart rejoice.
The Thoughts of them shall make me glad,
And shout with cheerful Voice.
5, 6. How wondrous are thy Works, O Lord!
How deep are thy Decrees!
Whose private Tracks in secret laid
No stupid Sinner sees.
7. He little thinks, when wicked Men
Like Grass look fresh and gay,
How soon their short-lived Splendor must
For ever pass away.
8, 9. But God for ever is most High;
And all his lofty Foes
Who thought they might securely sin,
Shall be overwhelmed with Woes.
10. Whilst thou exalt'st my Horn of Power,
And mak'^t it largely spread;
And with refreshing Oil anoint'st
My consecrated Head.
11. I soon shall see my stubborn Foes
To utter Ruin brought;
And hear the dismal Fate of such
As have against me fought.
12. But righteous Men, like fruitful Palms,
Shall make a glorious Show;
As Cedars that in Lebanon
With stately Verdure grow.
13, 14. These planted in the House of God,
Within his Courts shall thrive;
Their Vigor and their Lu^tre both
Shall in old Age revive.
15. Thus w^ll the Lord his Justice show:
And God, my strong Defense,
Shall due Rewards to all the World
Impartially dispense.
PSALM XCIII.
1. WIth Glory ^lad, with Strength arrayed,
The Lord that over all Nature reigns,
The World's Foundations strongly laid,
And the firm Globe unmoved sustains.
2. How surely stablisht is thy Throne!
Which still maintains its ancient State!
And yet no length of Time is known,
That measures thy eternal Date.
3, 4. The Floods, O Lord, lift up their Voice,
And toss the troubled Waves on high;
But God above can still their Noise
And make the angry Sea comply.
5. Thy Promise, Lord, is ever sure;
And they that closely wait on Thee,
To make their Happiness secure,
Must always pure and spotless be.
PSALM XCIV.
1, 2. O God, to whom Revenge belongs,
Let us thy Vengeance view;
Arise, thou Judge of all the Earth,
And give the Proud their due.
3, 4. How long, O Lord, shall sinful Men
Their solemn Triumphs make?
How long their wicked Actions boast?
And insolently speak?
5, 6. They, not alone thy Saints oppress,
But unprovoked they spill
The Widow's and the Stranger's Blood,
And helpless Orphans kill.
7. And yet the Lord shall never perceive,
(Profanely thus they speak:)
Nor any notice of our Deeds
The God of Jacob take.
8. At length, ye stupid Fools, your Wants
Endeavor to discern.
In Folly will you still proceed,
And Wisdom never learn?
9. Shall not that God who made the Ear,
Your Speeches hear and mind?
The Lord, by whom the Eye was framed,
Shall he be counted blind?
10. Shall he, whose Judgments aw the World,
To punish Sinners fear?
Or he, from whom all Wisdom flows,
Himself unwise appear?
11. He the most dark and secret Thoughts
Of all Mankind does see;
His piercing Eye surveys them all,
How very vain they be.
PART II.
12. Blessed is the Man, whom thou, O Lord,
In kindness do chastise;
And by thy sacred Rules to walk
Do lovingly advise.
13. He, in the days of deep Distress,
Shall Rest and Safety find;
While Sinners in the Snare are caught,
Which was for them designed.
14. For God will never from his Saints
His Favor wholly take;
His own Possession and his Lot,
He will not quite forsake.
15. But all his Actions shall appear
In Truth and Justice done;
And those that walk in upright ways,
Shall in those Paths go on.
16. Who will appear in my behalf,
When wicked Men invade?
Or who, when Sinners would oppress,
My righteous Cause shall plead?
17, 18, 19. My Soul had now in Silence dwelt,
But that the Lord was near.
He held me when I slipped, when sad,
He did my Sorrows cheer.
20. Will thou, who art a God most just,
The sinful Throne defend;
Which makes the Law a fair Pretense,
To gain its wicked End?
21. Against the Lives of righteous Men
They lay their close Design;
And how to spill the guiltless Blood
They wickedly combine.
22. But my Defense is firmly placed
In God the Lord most High;
He is my Rock to which I may
For Refuge always fly.
23. The Lord shall cause their ill Designs
On their own Heads to fall;
He in their Sins shall cut them off,
Our God shall slay them all.
PSALM XCV.
1. O Come, loud Anthems let us sing
Loud Thanks to our Almighty King,
For we our Voices high should raise,
When our Salvation's Rock we praise.
2. Into his Presence let us haste,
To thank him for his Favors past;
To him address in joyful Songs
The Praise that to his Name belongs.
3. The Depths of Earth are in his Hand,
Her Centre's Wealth at his Command;
The Strength of Hills that threat the Skies
Subjected to his Empire lies.
4. The rolling Ocean's vast Abyss
Her Maker's liquid Empire is;
It Is moved by his Almighty Hand,
That formed and fixed the solid Land.
5. O let us to his Courts repair,
And bow with Adoration there,
Down on our Knees devoutly All
Before the Lord our Maker fall.
6. For he is our God, our Shepherd he,
His Flock and Pasture-sheep are we;
If then you will (like his Flock) draw near,
To day if you his voice will hear,
7. Let not your hardened Heart renew
Your Fathers Crimes and Judgments too;
Nor here provoke my Wrath as they
In desert Plains of Meribah;
8. When through the Wilderness they moved
And me with fresh Temptations proved,
9. Even then through Unbelief rebelled,
While they my wond'rons Works beheld.
10. Full forty years, from place, to place,
They grieved my Patience, mocked my Grace,
Then, -- It Is a faithless Race, I said,
Whose Heart from me has always strayed;
They never will tread my righteous Path;
Therefore to them, in settled Wrath,
Since they despised my Rest, I swear
That they should never enter there.
PSALM XCVI.
1. SIng to the Lord a new made Song;
Let Earth, in one assembled Throng,
Her common Patron's Praise resound^
2. Sing to the Lord, and bless his Name,
From day to day his Praise proclaim
Who us has with Salvation crowned.
3. To Heathen Lands his Fame rehearse,
His Wonders to the Universe.
4. For great is He, nor can we rai^e
Proportioned to his Power our Praise,
The Dread of other Deities:
5. For Pageantry and Idols all
Are they whom Gods the Heathen call;
He only rules who made the Skies.
6. With Majesty and Honor crowned,
Beauty and Strength his Throne surround^
7. Be therefore Both to him restored
By you who have false Gods adored,
Ascribe due Honor to his Name;
8. Peace-Off'rings on his Altar lay,
Before his Throne your Homage pay,
Which He, and He alone, can claim.
9. To worship at his sacred Court
Let all the trembling World resort.
10. Proclaim aloud, Jehovah reigns,
Whose Power the Universe sustains,
And banished Justice will restore;
11. Let therefore Heaven new Joys confess,
And Earth celestial Transport bless,
Her loud Applause the Ocean roar;
Her mute Inhabitants rejoice,
And for this Triumph find a Voice.
12. For Joy let fertile Valleys sing,
The Meads their flowing Tribute bring,
The Groves winged Choristers awake,
13. To welcome great Messiah's Day:
For lo! the Lord is on his way,
His Circuit through the Earth to take;
From Heaven to judge the World he is come,
With Justice to reward and doom.
PSALM XCVII.
1. Jehovah reigns, let all the Earth
In his just Government rejoice;
Let all the Isles, with sacred Mirth,
In his Applause unite their Voice.
2. Darkness and Clouds of awful shade
His dazzling Glory shroud in state;
Justice and Truth his Guards are made,
And fixed by his Pavilion wait.
3. Devouring Fire before his Face
His ^oes around with Vengeance struck;
4. His Lightnings set the World on blaze.
Earth saw it, and with Terror shook.
5. The proudest Hills his Presence felt,
Their Height nor Strength could^ Help afford,
The proudest Hills like Wax did melt
In presence of Earth's Sovereign Lord.
6. The Heavens, his Righteousness to show,
With Storms of Fire our Foes pursued;
And all the trembling World below,
Have his descending Glory viewed.
7. Confounded be their impious Host
Who make the Gods to whom they pray;
All who of Pageant-Idols boast:
To him ye Gods your Worship pay.
8. Glad Sion of thy Triumph heard,
And Judah's Daughters were o'erjoy'd;
Because thy Righteous Judgments, Lord
Have Pagan Pride and Power destroyed.
9. For thou, O Lord, art seated high,
Above Earth's Potentates enthroned;
Thou Lord, unrivaled, in the Sky,
Supreme by all the Gods art owned.
10. You who to serve this Lord aspire,
Abhor what is ill, and Truth esteem:
He keeps his Servants Souls entire,
And will from wicked Hands redeem.
11. For Seeds are sown of glorious Light,
A future Harvest for the Just;
And Gladness for the Heart upright,
To recompense its pious Trust.
12. Rejoice ye Righteous, in the Lord;
Memorials of his Holiness
Deep in your Faithful Breasts record,
And with your thankful Tongues confess.
PSALM XCVIII.
1. SIng to the Lord a new-made Song,
Who wondrous things has done;
With his Right Hand and holy Arm
The Conquest he has won.
2. The Lord has through the astonished World
Displayed his saving Might,
His Righteousness shown openly,
Before the Heathens sight.
3. Of Israel's House his Love and Truth
Have ever mindful been:
Wide Earth's remotest Parts the Power
Of Israel's God have seen.
4. Let therefore Earth's Inhabitants
Their cheerful Voices raise,
With Universal Jubilee
Mankind resound his Praise.
5. With Harp and Hymns soft Melody
Into the Consort bring
6. The Trumpet and shrill Cornet's Sound,
Before the Almighty King.
7. Let the loud Ocean roar her Joy,
With all that Seas contain;
The Earth and her Inhabitants
Join consort with the Main.
8. With Joy let Riv'lets swell to Streams,
To joyful Torrents they;
And ecchoing Vales, from Hill to Hill,
Redoubled Shouts convey;
9. To welcome the great Judge of Earth
Who does with Justice come;
And with impartial Equity
Both to reward and doom.
PSALM XCIX.
1. Jehovah reigns, let therefore all^
The guilty Nations quake;
On Cherubs Wings he sits enthroned:
Let Earth's Foundations shaken
2. On Sion's Hill he keeps his Court,
His Palace makes her Towers;
Yet thence his Sov'reignty extends
Supreme over Earthly Powers.
3. Let therefore all with Praise address
His great and dreadful Name;
And with his unresisted Might,
His Holiness proclaim.
4. For Truth and Justice, in his Reign,
Of Strength and Power take place;
His Judgments are with Righteousness
Dispensed to Jacob's Race.
5. Therefore exalt the Lord our God,
Before his Footstool fall;
And with his unresisted might,
His Holiness extol.
6. Moses and Aaron thus of old^
Among his Priests adored;
Among^t his Prophets Samuel thus
His sacred Name implored,
Distressed upon the Lord they called,
Who never their Suit denied,
But, as with Reverence they invoked,
He graciously replied.
7. For, with their Camp, his Oracle
The cloudy Pillar moved.
They kept his Laws, and to his Will
Obedient Servants proved.
8. Thou answer'dst them, forgiving often,
Thy People for their sake,
And such as against them conspired
Did sad Examples make.
9. With Worship at his sacred Courts.
Exalt our God and Lord;
For He, who only holy is,
Alone should be adored.
PSALM C.
1. BE joyful all ye Realms of Earth,
Praise God, to whom your Praise belongs^
Serve ye the Lord with awful Mirth,
Before his Presence come with Songs.
2. The Lord, ye know, is God alone,
Who us, without our Aid, did make;
Us for his Flock vouchsafes to own,
And for his Pasture-Sheep to take.
3. O enter then with Thanks sincere
His Temple Gates, his Courts with Praise,
To bless his Name devourly there
Your grateful Hearts and Voices raise.
4. For He Is the Lord, supreamly good,
His Mercy shall for ever last;
His Truth has always firmly stood,
And so shall stand for ever fast.
PSALM CI.
1. OF Mercy's never-failing Spring,
And steadfast Judgment I will sing;
And, since they both to Thee belong,
To Thee, O Lord, address my Song.
2. When, Lord, thou shall with me reside,
Wise Discipline my Reign shall guide;
With blameless Life my self I Will make
A Pattern for my Court to take.
3. No ill Design will I pursue,
Nor those my Favorites make tha^ do^
4. Who to Reproof bears no regard,
Him will I totally discard.
5. The private Slanderer shall be
In public Justice doomed by me^
From haughty Looks I Will turn aside,
And mortify the Heart of Pride;
6. But Honesty call from her Cell,
In Splendor at my Court to dwell:
Who Vir^ue's Practice make their Care,
Shall have the first Preferments there^
7. No Politics shall recommend
His Country's Foe to be my Friend:
None ever shall to my Favor rise
By Flattering or Malicious Lies.
8. All those who wicked Courses take
An early Sacrifice I Will make;
Cut off, destroy, till none remain
God's holy City to profane.
PSALM CII.
1. WHen I pour out my Soul in Prayer,
Do thou, O Lord, attend;
To thy Eternal Throne of Grace
Let my sad Cry ascend.
2. O hide not thou thy glorious Face
In times of deep Distress,
Incline thine Ear, and when I call
My Sorrows soon redress.
3. Each cloudly Portion of my Life
Like scattered Smoke expires;
My shriv'led Bones are like a Hearth
That Is parched with constant Fires.
4. My Heart, like Grass that feels the Blast^
Of some infectious Wind,
Is withered so with Grief, that scarce
My needful Food I mind.
5. By reason of my sad Estate
I spend my Breath in Groans;
My Flesh is worn away, my Skin
Scarce hides my starting Bones.
6. I Am ^^ke a Pelican become,
That does in Deserts mourn;
Or like an Owl that sits all day
On barren Trees forlorn,
7. In Watchings or in restless Dreams
I spend the tedious Night;
Like Sparrows, that on Houses tops
To sit alone delight.
8. All day by railing Foes I Am made
The Object of their Scorn;
Who all, inspired with furious Rage,
Have my Destruction sworn.
9. In dust I lie, and all my Bread
With Ashes mixed appears;
Whenever I quench my burning Thirst,
My Drink is dashed with Tears.
10. Because on me with Double weight
Thy heavy Wrath do lie;
For thou to make my Fall more great
Did lift me up on high.
11. My Days are like the Ev'^ing Shade
That hastily declines^
My Beauty too, like withered Grass,
With faded Luster pines:
12. But thy eternal State, O lord,
No length of Time shall waste;
The memory of thy wondrous Works,
From Age to Age shall last.
13. Thou Wilt soon arise and Sion view
With an unclouded Face;
For now her Time is come, thy own
Appointed Day of Grace.
14. Thy Saints, with Tenderness and Love,
Her scattered Ruins spy;
And grieve to see her lofty Spires
In Dust and Rubbish lie.
15, 16. The Name and Glory of the Lord
All Heathen Kings shall fear;
When he shall Sion build again,
And in full state appear.
17, 18. When he regards the Poor's Request,
Nor slights their earnest Prayer;
His Praise for this recorded Grace,
Shall future Times declare.
19. For God, from his Abode on high,
His gracious Beams displayed;
The Lord, from Heaven his lofty Throne^
Has all the Earth surveyed.
20. He list'ned to the Captives Moans,
He heard their mournful Cry,
And freed by his resistless Power
The Wretches doomed to die.
21. That they in Sion, where he dwells,
Might celebrate his Fame,
And through the holy City sing
Loud Praises to his Name.
22. When all the Tribes, together met,
Their solemn Prayers address,
And neighboring Lands, with glad Consent,
The Lo^d their God confess.
23. But ever my Journey ends, my Strength
Through his ^ier^e Wrath decays;
He has, when all my Wishes bloomed,
Cut short my hopeful Days^
24. Lord, end not thou my Life, said I,
When half is scarcely past;
Thy Years from earthly Changes free,
To endless Ages last.
25. The strong Foundations of the Earth
Of old by Thee were laid;
Thy Hands the beauteous Arch of Heaven
With wondrous Skill have made:
26, 27. Whilst thou for ever shall endure,
They soon shall pass away;
And, like a Garment often worn,
Shall tarnish and decay.
Like that, when thou their Change ordain'st,
To thy Command they bend;
But Thou continu'st still the same,
Nor have thy years an End.
28. Thou to the Children of thy Saints
Shall lasting Quiet give;
Whose happy Race, securely fixed,
Shall in thy Presence live.
PSALM CIII.
1, 2. MY Soul, inspired with sacred Love,
God's holy Name for ever bless;
Of all his Favors mindful prove,
And still thy grateful thanks express.
3, 4. It Is He that all thy Sins forgives,
And after Sickness makes thee sound.
Thy Life from Danger He retrieves,
By him with Grace and Mercy crowned.
5, 6. He with good things thy Mouth supplies,
And Eagle-like thy Youth renews;
He when the guiltless Suff'rer cries,
His Foe with just Revenge pursues.
7. God made of old his right^ous Ways
To Moses and our Fathers known^
His Works, to his eternal Praise,
Were to the Sons of Jacob shown.
8. The Lord abounds with tender Love,
And unexampled Acts of Grace,
His wakened Wrath does slowly move,
His willing Mercy flows apace.
9, 10. God will not always harshly chide,
But with his Anger quickly parts;
And loves his Punishments to guide
More by his Love than our Deserts.
11. As high as Heaven its Arch extends,
Above this little Spot of Clay;
So much his boundless Love transcends
The small Respects that we can pay.
12, 13. As far as it is from ^ast to West,
So far has he our Sins removed;
Who with a Father's tender Breast
Has such as fear him always loved.
14, 15. For God, who all our Frame surveys,
Considers that we are but Clay;
How fresh soever we seem, our Days
Like Grass or Flowers must fade away.
16, 17. Whilst they are nipt with sudden Blasts,
Nor can we find their former place;
God's faithful mercy ever lasts,
To those that fear him, and their Race.
18. This shall attend on such as still
Proceed in his appointed way^
And who not only know his Will,
But just obedience to it pay.
19, 20. The Lord, the universal King,
In Heaven has fixed his lofty Throne:
To him, ye Angels, praises sing
In whose great Strength his Power is shown,
Ye that his just Commands obey,
And hear and do his sacred Will;
21. Ye Hosts of his, this Tribute pay,
Who still what he ordains fulfill.
22. Let every Creature jointly bless
The mighty Lord: and thou, my Heart,
With grateful Joy thy Thanks express;
And in this Consort bear thy part.
PSALM CIV.
1. BLess God my Soul; Thou Lord alone
Possessest Empire without Bounds^
With Honor thou art crowned, thy Throne
Eternal Majesty surrounds.
2. With Light thou do thy self enrobe,
And Glory for a Garment take:
Heaven's Curtains stretch beyond the Globe
Thy Canopy of State to make.
3. He builds on liquid Air, and forms
His Palace-Chambers in the Skies;
The Clouds his Chariot are, and Storms
The swift-wing'd Steeds with which he flies.
4. Spirits he made his heavenly Quire,
With speed his Orders to fulfill;
His Ministers a flaming Fire,
To execute his dreadful Will.
5, 6. Earth, on her Center fixed, he set,
Her Face with Waters overspread;
Nor proudest Mountains dared, as yet,
To lift above the Waves their Head.
7. But when thy awful Face appeared,
The insulting Waves dispersed; they fled
When once thy Thunders Voice they heard,
And by their haste confessed their Dread.
8. Thence up, by secret Tracks they creep,
And, gushing from the Mountains side,
Through Valleys travel to the Deep,
Appointed to receive their Tide.
9. There have thou fixed the Ocean bounds,
Her threatening Surges to repel;
That she no more o'erpass her Mounds,
Nor to a second Deluge swell.
PART II.
10. Yet thence, in smaller Parties drawn,
The Sea recovers her lost Hills;
And starting Springs from every Lawn,
Surprise the Vales in plenteous Rills.
11. The Field's tame Beasts are thither led,
Weary with Labor, faint with Drought;
And Asses on wild Mountains bred,
Have sense to find these Currents out.
12. There shady Trees, from scorching Beams,
Yield shelter to the feathered Throng;
They drink^ and to the bounteous Streams
Return the Tribute of their Song.
13. His Rains from Heaven, parcht Hills recruit,
That soon transmit the liquid Store;
Till Earth is burdened with her Fruit,
And Nature's Lap can hold no more.
14. Grass, for our Cattle to devour,
He makes the Growth of every Field;
Herbs, for Man's use, of various Power,
That either Food or Physic yield.
15. With clustered Grapes he crowns the Vine,
Whose Nectar mortal Cares subdues;
Gives Oil, that makes our Face to shine;
And Corn, that wasted Strength renews.
PART III.
16. The Trees of God without the Care
Or Art of Man with Sap are fed;
The Mountain Cedar looks as fair
As those in Royal Gardens bred.
17. Safe in the lofty Cedars Arms
The Wand'rers of the Air may rest.
The hospitable Pine from harms
Protects the Stork her pious Guest.
18. Wild Goats the craggy Rock ascend,
Its towering Heights their Fortress make,
Whose Cells in Labyrinths extend
Where feebler Creatures Refuge take.
19. The Moon's inconstant Aspect shows
The appointed Seasons of the Year;
Th'instructed Sun his Duty knows,
His Hours to rise and disappear.
20, 21. Darkness he makes the Day to shroud,
When Forest-Beasts securely stray;
Young Lions roar their Wants aloud
To Providence that sends 'em Prey.
22. They range all Night, on Slaughter bent,
Till summoned by the rising Morn,
To sculk in Dens with one consent
The conscious Ravagers return.
23. Forth to the Tillage of his Soil,
The Husbandman securely goes,
Commencing with the Sun his Toil,
With him returns to his Repose.
24. How various, Lord, thy Works are found
For which thy Wisdom we adore!
The Earth is with thy Treasure crowned,
Till Nature's Hand can grasp no more.
PART IV.
25. But still thy vast unfathomed Main
Of Wonders a new Scene supplies,
Whose Depths ^nhabitants contain
Of every Form and every Size.
26. Full-freighted Ships from every Port,
There cut their unmolested way;
Leviathan, whom there to sport
Thou made, has compass there to play.
27. These various Troops of Sea and Land,
In sense of common Want agree;
All wait on thy dispensing Hand^
And have their daily Alms from Thee.
28. They gather what thy Stores disperse,
Without their Trouble to provide;
Thou op'st thy Hand, the Universe,
The craving World is all supplied.
29. Thou for a moment hid'st thy Face,
The numerous Ranks of Creatures mourn:
Thou take their Breath all Nature's Race
Forthwith to mother Earth return.
30. Again thou send'st thy Spirit forth
T'inspire the Mass with vital Seed,
Nature's restored, and Parent Earth
Smiles on her new-created Breed.
31. Thus through successive Ages stands
Firm fixed thy Providential Care;
Pleased with the Work of thy own Hands,
Thou do the Wastes of Time repair.
32. One Look of thine, one wrathful Look,
Earth's panting Breast with Terror sills;
One Touch from Thee, with Clouds of Smoke,
In Darkness shrouds the proudest Hills.
33. In praising him, while he prolongs
My Breath, I will that Breath employ;
34. And join Devotion to my Songs,
Sincere, as is in him my Joy.
35. While Sinners from Earth's Face are hurled,
My Soul, praise thou his holy Name,
Till, with thy Song, the listening World
Join consort, and his Praise proclaim,
PSALM CV.
1. O Render Thanks, and bless the Lord,
Invoke his sacred Name:
Acquaint the Nations with his Deeds,
His matchless Deeds proclaim.
2. Sing to his Praise, in lofty Hymns
His wondrous Works rehearse;
Make them the Theme of your Discourse,
And Subject of your Verse.
3. Boast in his sacred Name, a Name
Alone to be adored;
And let their Heart overflow with Joy
That humbly seek the Lord.
4. Seek ye the Lord, his saving Strength
Devoutly still implore;
And, where he is ever present, seek
His Face for evermore.
5. The Wonders that his Hands have wrought
Keep thankfully in mind;
The righteous Statutes of his Mouth,
And Laws to us assigned.
6. Know ye his Servant Abr'am's Seed,
And Jacob's chosen Race,
7. He Is still our God, his Judgments still
Throughout the Earth take place.
8. His Covenant he has kept in mind
For numerous Ages past,
That yet, for thousand Ages more,
In equal Force shall last.
9. First signed to Abr'am, next by Oath
To Isaac made secure;
10. To Jacob and his Heirs a Law
For ever to endure.
11. That Canaan's Land should be their Lot,
When yet but few they were;
12. But few in number, and those few
Unfriended Strangers there.
13. In Pilgrimage from Realm to Realm
Uninjur'd they removed;
14. Whilst proudest Monarchs for their sakes,
Severely he reproved.
15. These mine Anointed are, said he,
Let none my Servants wrong,
Nor treat the poorest Prophet ill
That does to me belong.
16. A Dearth at last, by his Command,
Did far and near prevail;
Till Corn, the chief Support of Life,
Sustaining Corn did fail.
17. But his indulgent Providence
Had Joseph sent before,
Sold into Egypt, but their Lives
Who sold him to restore.
18. His Feet with heavy Chains were crushed,
With Calumny his Fame;
19. Till God's appointed Time and Word
To his Acquittal came.
20. The King his Sovereign Orders sent,
And rescued him with speed.
Whom private Malice had confined,
The People's Ruler freed.
21. His Court and Realm, Revenues, all
Subjected to his Will;
22. His Princes to control, and teach
His Politicians Skill.
PART II.
23. To Egypt then, invited Guests,
Half-famisht Israel came;
And Jacob held, by Royal Grant,
The fertile Soil of Ham.
24. The Almighty there with such Increase
His People multiplied,
Till, both for Strength and Number, they
Their envious Foes desy'd.
25. His People's Growth Egyptian Hearts
With jealous Anger fired,
Till they his Servants to destroy
By treacherous Arts conspired.
26. His Envoy Moses then he sent,
His chosen Aaron too;
27. Empowr'd with Signs and Miracles
To prove their Mission true.
28. He called for Darkness, Darkness came,
Nature his Summons knew.
29. Each Stream and Lake, transformed to Blood,
Their scaly Offspring slew.
30. In putrid Floods, throughout the Land,
The Pest of Frogs was bred;
From noisome Fens preferred to croak
At Pharaoh's Board and Bed.
31. He gave the Signal, Swarms of Flies
Came down in cloudy Hosts;
Whilst Earth's enliv'ned Dust below
Bred Lice through all their Coasts.
32. He sent 'em batt'ring Hail for Rain,
And Fire for cooling Dew.
33. He smote their Vines, their Forest-Plants,
And Gardens Pride o'erthrew.
34. He spoke the word and Locusts came,
With Caterpillars joined,
They preyed upon the poor Remains
The S^orm had left behind.
35. From Trees to Herbage they descend;
No verdant thing they spare;
But naked, as the fallow'd Field,
Leave all the Pastures bare.
36. From Memphis Soil to Memphis Sons,
Commissioned Vengeance flew,
One fatal Stroke their eldest Hopes
And Strength of Egypt slew.
37. He brought 'em forth, each one enriched
With Egypt's borrowed Wealth;
And, what transcends all Treasures else,
Enriched with vigorous Health.
38. Egypt rejoiced, in hopes to find
Her Plagues with them removed;
Taught dearly now to fear worse Ills
By those already proved.
39. Their shrouding Canopy by day
A journeying Cloud was spread;
A fiery Pillar all the night
Their Desart-marches led.
40. They longed for Flesh; with Ev'ning-Quails
He furnished every Tent;
From Heavens own Granary, each Morn,
The Bread of Angels sent.
41. He smote the Rock; her flinty Breast
A gushing Tide poured out,
Whose following Stream, wherever they marched,
Relieved the Desart's Drought.
42. For still he did on Abr'am's Faith
And ancient League reflect;
43. He brought his People forth with Joy,
With Triumph his Elect.
44. Extirpating their Heathen Foes,
From Canaan's Fertile Soil,
To them in cheap possession gave
The Fruit of others Toil.
45. That they his Statutes might observe,
His sacred Laws obey.
For Benefits so vast let us
Our Songs of Praise repay^
PSALM CVI.
1. O Render Thanks to God above,
The Fountain of eternal Love;
Whose Mercy firm through Ages past
Has stood, and shall for ever last.
2. Who can his mighty Deeds express,
Not only vast but numberless;
What Mortal Eloquence can raise
His Tribute of immortal Praise
3. Happy are they, and only they
Who from thy Judgments never stray;
Who know what is right, nor only ^o,
But always practice what they know.
4. Extend to me that Favor, Lord,
Thou to thy chosen do afford;
When thou return'st, to set them free,
Let thy Salvation visit me.
5. O may I worthy prove to see
Thy Saints in full Prosperity!
That I that joyful Choir may join.
And count thy People's Triumph mine^
6. But ah can we expect such Grace,
Of Parents vile the viler Race,
Who their Misdeeds have acted over,
And with new Crimes increased the Score^
7. Ungrateful, they no longer thought
On all his Works in Egypt wrought;
The Red Sea yet is scarce in view,
When they their base Distrust renew.
8. Yet He, to vindicate his Name,
Once more to their Deliverance came,
To make his sovereign Power be known,
That He is God, and He alone.
9. To right and left, at his Command,
The parting Deep disclosed her Sand;
Where firm and dry the Passage lay,
As through some parcht and Desert way,
10. Thus saved from fronting Seas they were,
And Foes that pressed upon their Rear,
11. Whose Rage pursued 'em to those Waves
That proved the rash Pursuers Graves.
12. The pendant Waters sudden Fall
O'erwhelms proud Pharaoh, Host and all:
This Proof did stupid Israel raise
To trust God's Word, and sing his Praise.
PART II.
13. But soon relapsed, they all forgat^
Nor on his Providence would wait;
14. But lusting in the Wilderness,
Their God with fresh Temptations press.
15. Strong Food at their Request he sent,
But made their Sin their Punishment.
16. God's Envoy Moses they oppose,
And Aaron whom the Lord had chose.
17. But Earth, the Quarrel to decide,
Her vengeful Jaws extending wide,
Rash Dathan to her Center drew.
With proud Abiram's factious Crew.
18. Bold Korah, who did next aspire
To kindle wild Sedition's Fire,
With all his impious Train became
Ju^t Victims to devouring Flame.
19. Near Horeb's Mount, a Calf ^hey made,
And to the ^olt^n Image prayed;
The Law their God in Thunder spoke
From Sinai, they near Sinai brake:
20. Adoring what their Hands did frame,
They changed their Glory to their Shame,
Into the Likeness made it pass
Of a brute Ox that feeds on Grass.
21. Their God and Savior they forgot,
And all his Works in Egypt wrought;
22. His Terrors shown through Egypt's Coast,
And where proud Pharaoh's Troops were lost.
23. Thus urged, and from his Promise freed,
Their total Ruin he decreed;
His Hand for Execution reared:
But Moses in the Breach appeared;
His Favorite Moses intercedes,
And to revoke their Sentence pleads:
Heaven heard its faithful Servant pray,
And turned its kindled Wrath away.
24. Yet they his pleasant Land despised,
Nor his repeated Promise prized;
25. But in their Tents repining staid,
Nor the Almighty's Voice obeyed.
26. This sealed their Doom without Redress,
To perish in the Wilderness;
27. And who escaped the Desert Sands,
To live dispersed through Heathen Lands.
PART III.
28. The next, but more degenerate Race,
Baal Peor's Worship did embrace;
Became his impious Guests, and sed
On Sacrifices to the Dead.
29. Thus they persisted to provoke
God's Vengeance to the final Stroke:
It Is come: -- the deadly Pest is come
To execute their general Doom.
30. It spreads; till Phineah's Zeal and Sword
A stronger Antidote afford;
Two guilty Persons timely Fall,
Atonement makes and ransoms all.
31. As his Seraphick Zeal had moved,
So Heaven the generous Act approved,
To him confirming and his Race
The Priesthood he so well did grace.
32. At Meribah God's Wrath they moved,
Who Moses for their sakes reproved;
33. Whose patient Soul they did provoke,
Till rashly the meek Prophet spoke.
34. Nor when possessed of Canaan's Land,
Did they perform their Lords Command,
Nor his commissioned Sword employ
The guilty Nations to destroy.
35. Nor only spared the Pagan Crew,
But, mingling, learnt their Vices too;
36. Their Idols served, the fatal Snare
Of which so often fore-warned they were.
37, 38. To Hell's dark Powers they Sacrifice
Their Children with relentless Eyes,
Approach their Altars through a Flood
Of their own Sons and Daughters Blood^
No cheaper Victims will appease
Canaan's remorseless Deities;
No Blood her Idols reconcile
But that which does the Land defile.
PART IV.
39. Nor yet will Canaan's Deities
Apostate Israel's Tribes suffice;
For lusting after More they went,
And did new Gods and Crimes invent.
40. But Sins of such infernal Hue
God's Wrath against his People drew,
Till he, their once indulgent Lord,
His own Inheritance abhorred.
41. To Heathen Hands he them subjects,
Their guilty Friendships just Effects,
To rue and mourn too late, when they
Must those, who hate them most, obey.
42. Nor thus his Indignation ceased,
Their List of Tyrants he increased,
Till they, who God's mild Sway declined.
Were made the Vassals of Mankind.
43. Yet when, distressed, they did repent,
His Anger did as often relent,
But, rescued, they his Wrath provoke,
Renew their Sins, and he their Yoke.
44. Nor yet implacable he proved,
Nor heard their wretched Cries unmoved,
45. But did to mind his Promise bring,
And Mercy's inexhausted Spring:
46. Surprising Pity too impart^
Even to their Foes obdurate Hearts;
Compassion for their Sufferings bred
In those who them as Captives led.
47. Still save us, Lord, and Israel's Bands
Together bring from Heathen Lands,
Our Thanks in thy blessed Name to raise,
And ever triumph in thy Praise.
48. Let Israel's God be ever blessed,
His Name eternally addressed;
And all his Saints, with full Accord,
Sing loud Amens. -- Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CVII.
1. TO God your grateful Voices raise,
Who still to us did gracious prove;
And let your never-ceasing Praise
Keep pace with his eternal Love.
2, 3. Let those give thanks, whom he from Bands
Of proud oppressing Foes released;
And brought them back from distant Lands,
From North and South and West and Ea^t.
4, 5. Through lonely Desert Ways they strayed,
Nor could a peopled City find;
With Thirst and Hunger quite dismayed,
Their fainting Soul within them pined.
6. Then soon to God's indulgent Ear
Did they their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously vouchsafed to hear,
And freed them from their deep Distress^
7. From crooked Paths he led them forth,
And in the certain way did guide,
To wealthy Towers of great resort,
Where all their Wants were well supply^d.
8. O then that all the Earth with me
Would God for this his Goodness praise!
And for the mighty Works which he
Throughout the wondering World display^!
9. For he from Heaven the sad estate
Of longing Souls with Pity Eyes;
And hungry Souls that part for Meat,
With envied Plenty He supplies.
PART II.
10. Those that with darkness compassed round,
Sit down in Death's most dismal Shade;
Or lie with weighty Fetters bound,
By pressing Cares more heavy made;
11, 12. Because God's Counsel they desy'd,
And proudly scorned his holy Word;
He them with these Affli^tions try'd^
They fell, and none could Help a^^ord^
13. Then soon to God's indulgent Ear,
Did they their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously vouchsafed to hear,
And freed them from their deep Distress.
14. From dismal Dungeons dark as Night,
And Shades as black as Death's Abode;
He brought them forth to cheerful Light,
And welcome Liberty bestowed.
15. O then that all the Earth with me,
Would God for this his Goodness praise!
And for the mighty Works which he
Throughout the wondering World displays.
16. For he with his almighty Hand
The Gates of Brass in pieces broke;
Nor could the massy Bars withstand,
Or tempered Steel resist his Stroke.
PART III.
17. Remorseless Wretches, void of Sense
With bold Transgressions God defy;
And, for their multiplied Offense,
Oppressed with sore Diseases lie:
18. Their Soul, a Prey to Pain and Fear,
Abhors to taste the choicest Meats,
And they by faint Degrees draw near
To Death's uncomfortable Gates.
19. Then strait to Gods indulgent Ear
Do they their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously vouchsafes to hear,
And frees them from their deep Distress.
20. He all the^^ sad Distempers heals,
His Word both Health and Safety gives;
And when all humane Succor fails,
From near Destruction them retrieves.
21. O then that all the Earth, with me,
Would God for this his Goodness praise!
And for the mighty Works which he
Through all the wondering World displays!
22. With Offerings let the Altars flame,
Whilst they their grateful Thanks express!
And with loud Joy his holy Name
For all his wondrous Actions bles^!
PART IV.
23, 24. They that in Ships with Courage bold,
Over swelling Waves their Trade pursue;
Do God's amazing Works behold,
And in the Deep his Wonders view.
25. No sooner his Command is past,
But forth a dreadful Tempest flies,
Which sweeps the Sea with rapid Haste,
And makes its stormy Billows rise:
26. Sometimes the Ships, tossed up to Heaven,
On Tops of mounting Waves appear;
Then down the vast Abyss are driven;
Whilst every Soul dissolves with fear.
27. They reel and stagger to and fro,
Like Men with Fumes of Wine oppressed;
Nor do the skilful Seamen know
Which way to steer, what Course is best.
28. Then strait to God's indulgent Ear
They do their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously vouchsafes to hear,
And frees them from their deep Distress.
29, 30. The stormy Tempest he allays,
And makes the Billows calm and still;
With Joy they see their Fury cease;
And he conducts them where they will.
31. O then that all the Earth, with me,
Would God for this his Goodness Praise!
And for the mighty Works which he
Throughout the wondering World displays!
32. Let them, where all the Tribes resort,
Advance to Heaven his glorious Name,
And in the Elders sovereign Court,
With one consent his Praise proclaim!
PART V.
33, 34. A fruitful Land, where Streams abound,
Gods just Revenge, if People sin,
Will turn to dry and barren Ground,
To punish those that dwell therein.
35, 36. The parcht and desert Heath he makes
To flow with Streams and springing Wells;
Which for his Lot the Hungry takes,
And in strong Cities safely dwells.
37, 38. He sows the Fields, and Vineyards plants,
Which all his Toil with Interest pay;
Nor can, whilst God his Blessing grants,
His fruitful Seed or Stock decay.
39. But when his Sins Heaven's Wrath provoke,
He quickly fades and falls away;
He feels the Oppressor's gauling Yoke,
Of Care and Grief the wretched Prey.
40. The Prince, that slights God's just Commands,
Exposed to scorn, must quit his Throne;
And over wild and desert Lands,
Where no Path offers, stray alone,
41. Whilst God, from all Afflicting Cares,
Sets up the humble Man on high;
And causes his increasing Heirs,
With his abounding Flocks to vie.
42, 43. Then Sinners shall have naught to say,
The just a decent Joy shall show;
The Wise the strange Events shall weigh,
And thence God's Goodness fully know.
PSALM CVIII.
1. O God, my Heart is fully bent,
To magnify thy Name;
And of my cheerful Songs thy Praise
Shall be the glorious Theme.
2. Awake, my Lute; nor thou my Harp,
Thy warbling Notes delay;
Whilst I with early Hymns of Joy,
Prevent the dawning Day.
3. To all the listening Tribes, O Lord,
Thy wondrous Works I Will tell;
And to those Nations sing thy Praise
That round about us dwell:
4. Because thy Mercy's boundless Height
The Heavens themselves transcends;
And far beyond the aspiring Clouds
Thy faithful Truth extends.
5. Be thou exalted, Lord, by them,
Above the Starry Frame;
O let the World, with one Consent,
Confess thy glorious Name.
6. That all thy chosen People Thee
Their Savior may declare.
Let thy Right Hand protect me still,
And answer thou my Prayer.
7. Since God, the God of Truth has spoke,
My Arms shall sure prevail;
With Joy I Shechem shall divide:
And measure Succoth's Vale:
8. Gilead is mine, Manass^h too;
And Ephraim owns my Cause:
Their Strength my Regal Power supports,
And Judah gives my Laws.
9. Moab I Will make my servile Drudge,
On vanquished Edom tread;
And over the proud Philistine Lands
Advance my lofty Head.
10. By whose Support and Aid shall I
Their well-fenc'd Towns invade?
Who will my conquering Troops conduct,
And into Edom lead?
11. Lord, wilt not thou assist our Arms,
Tho late thou did forsake?
And wilt not thou, of these our Hosts,
The happy Guidance take?
12. O to thy Servants in Distress
Thy speedy Succor send:
For vain it is on humane Aid
For Safety to depend.
13. Then valiant Acts shall we per^orm,
If thou thy Power disclose;
For God it is, and God alone,
That treads down all our Foes.
PSALM CIX.
1. O God, whose former Mercies make
My constant Praise thy Due,
Hold not thy peace, but my sad State
With wonted Favor view.
2. For sinful Men, with lying Lips,
Deceitful Speeches frame,
And with their studied Slanders seek
To wound my spotless Fame.
3. Their envious Hatred prompts them still
Malicious Lies to spread;
And all against my Life combine,
By causeless Fury led.
4. Those whom with tenderest Love I used,
My chief Opposers are;
Whilst I, of other Friends bereft,
Resort to Thee by Prayer.
5. Since Mischief, for the Good I did,
Their strange Reward does prove;
And Hatred's the Return they make
For undissembled Love.
6. Their guilty Leader shall be made
To some bad Man a Slave;
And when he is tried, his mortal Foe
For his Accuser have.
7. His Guilt, when Sentence is pronounced,
Shall find a dreadful Fate;
Whilst his rejected Prayer but serves
To make his Crime more great.
8. He, snatched by some untimely Fate,
Sha'n't live out half his Days;
Another, by divine Decree,
Shall on his Office seize.
9, 10. His Seed shall Orphans be, his Wife
A Widow plunged in Grief;
His vagrant Children beg their Bread,
Where none can give Relief.
11. His ill-got Fortune shall be made
To Userers a Prey;
The Fruit of all his Toil and Care
By Strangers born away.
12. None shall be found, that to his Wants
Their Mercy shall extend,
Or to his helpless Orphan Seed
The least Assistance lend.
13. A swift Destruction soon shall seize
On his unhappy Race;
And the next Age his hated Name
Shall utterly deface.
14. The Vengeanc^ of his Father's Sins
Upon his Head shall fall;
God on his Mother's Crimes shall think,
And punish him for all.
15. All these, in horrid Order ranked,
Before the Lord shall stand,
Till his fierce Anger quite cuts off
Their Memory from the Land.
PART II.
16. Because he never Mercy showed,
But still the Poor oppressed;
And sought to slay the helpless Man,
With heavy Woes oppressed;
17. Therefore the Curse he loved to vent,
Shall his own Portion prove;
And Ble^sing, which he always loathed,
Shall far from him remove.
18. Since Cursing was his constant Pride,
^ike Water it shall spread
Through all his Veins, and stick like Oil,
With which his Bones are fed.
19. This like a poisoned Robe, shall still
His constant Covering be,
Or an envenomed Belt, from which
He never shall be free.
20. Thus shall the Lord reward all those
That Ill to me design;
That with malicious false Reports
Against my Life combine.
21. But for thy glorious Name, O God,
Do thou appear for me,
And for thy gracious Mercy's sake,
Preserve and set me free.
22. For I a poor and helpless Wretch
Am void of all Relief;
My Heart is wounded with Distress,
And quite pierced through with Grief.
23. I, like an Evening Shade, am gone,
Which vanishes apace;
Like Locusts up and down I Am tossed,
That have no certain place.
24, 25. My Knees with Fasting are grown weak,
My Body lank and lean;
All that behold me shake their Heads,
And treat me with Disdain.
26, 27. But for thy Mercy's sake, O Lord,
Do thou my Foes withstand;
That all may see it is thy own Act,
The Work of thy Right Hand.
28. Then let them curse, if thou but bless;
Their Portion shall be Shame,
When they against me rise; but I
With Joy shall praise thy Name.
29. Thus shall my Foe be clothed with Shame,
And spite of all his Pride,
His own Confusion, like a Cloak,
The guilty Wretch shall hide.
30. But I to Heaven, in grateful Thanks,
My cheerful Voice will raise;
And where the great Assembly meets,
Set forth God's noble Praise.
31. For him the Poor shall always ^ind,
His sure and constant Friend;
And he shall from unrighteous Dooms
His guiltless Soul defend.
PSALM CX.
1. THE Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou
At my Right Hand, till I subdue
And all thy Foes thy Footstool make^
2. Supreme in Sion thou shall be,
And thence extend thy Sov'reignty
Over all who thy just Rights would take.
3. Thee, in thy Powers triumphant Day,
The willing Nations shall obey,
And when thy rising Beams they view,
Redeemed from Superstition's Night,
To Thee shall be assembled, bright
And numberless as Morning Dew.
4. The Lord has sworn, nor sworn in vain,
That, like Melchizedech's, thy Reign
And Priesthood ^^all no Period know^
5. No proud Competitor to sit
At thy Right Hand will he permit;
But in his Wrath Crowned Heads o'erthrow.
6. The sentenced Heathen he shall slay,
And fill with Carcasses his way,
Till he has struck Earth's Tyrants dead:
7. But in the Highway Brook shall first,
Like some poor Pilgrim slack his Thirst,
And then in Triumph lift his Head.
PSALM CXI.
1. PRaise ye the Lord; our God to praise
My Soul her utmost Powers shall raise,
Amongst private Friends, and in the Throng
O^ Saints, his Praise shall be my Song.
2. His Works, for Greatness tho renowned,
His wondrous Works with Ease are found
By those who seek for them aright,
And in the pious Search delight.
3. Glory and Majesty attend
On every Work he takes in hand;
His Truth, confirmed through Ages past,
Shall to eternal Ages last.
4. By Precept he has us enjoined,
To keep his wondrous Works in mind,
And to Posterity record,
That good and gracious is our Lord,
5. Whose Bounty's ever-flowing Tide
Their Wants, who feared his Name, supplied;
For ever he will keep in mind
His Covenant with our Fathers signed.
6. At once astonished and o'erjoy'd,
They saw his matchless Power employed,
Whereby the Heathen were suppressed,
And we their Heritage possessed.
7. Just are the Dealings of his Hands
^mmurable are his Commands.
8. By Truth and Equity sustained,
And for eternal Rules ordained.
9. Deliverance to his Saints has sent,
And ratified his Covenant,
For ever to remain the same:
Awful and sacred is his Name.
10. God's Fear is Wisdom's Source: good skill
Have they obtained who do his Will;
This only can true Bliss procure,
And Praise that always shall endure.
PSALM CXII. HALLELVIAH.
1. THat Man is blessed who stands in aw
Of God, and loves his sacred Law:
2. His Seed on Earth shall be renowned,
And with successive Honors crowned.
3. His House, the Seat of Wealth, shall be
An inexhausted Treasury;
Their Fathers Justice shall avail,
And Blessings on his Heirs entail.
4. The Soul that is filled with Virtue's Light,
Shines brightest in Affliction's Night:
To pity the Distressed inclined,
As well as just to all Mankind.
5. His liberal Favors he extends,
To some he gives, to others lends:
Yet what his Charity impairs
Recruits by Prudence in Affairs.
6. The Storm of Angry Fate may threat,
But never displace him from his Seat,
The sweet Memorial of the Just
Shall flourish when he sleeps in dust.
7. Ill Tidings cannot with Fear surprise
His Heart that, fixed, on God relies:
8. On Safety's Rock he sits and sees
The Ship-wreck of his Enemies.
9. His Hands, while they his Alms bestowed,
His Glory's future Harvest sowed,
Whence he shall reap Wealth, Fame, Renown,
A temp'ral and eternal Crown.
10. The Wicked shall his Triumph see,
And gnash their Teeth in Agony,
While their unrighteous Hopes decay,
And vanish, with themselves, away.
PSALM CXIII.
1. YE Saints and Servants of the Lord,
The Triumphs of his Name record,
2. His sacred Name for ever bless.
3. Where ever the circling Sun displays,
His rising Beams or setting Rays,
Due Praise to his great Name address.
4. The Lord over Earth bears sovereign Sway,
The Regions of eternal Day
Reflections of his Glory are.
5. To Him, whose Majesty excels,
Who made the Heaven in which he dwells,
Let no created Power compare.
6. Affairs of highest Heaven to know,
In him does Condescension show,
Yet he extends his Care to Earth.
7. The Poor and Needy from their Cell,
8. Prefers in Palaces to dwell
With Princes of high Rank and Birth.
9. When Childless Families despair,
He sends the Comfort of an Heir,
To rescue their exspiring Fame;
Grants her that barren was to bear,
And joyfully her Fruit to rear.
Praise ye the Lord's almighty Name.
PSALM CXIV.
1. WHen Israel, by the Almighty led,
(Enriched with their Oppressors Spoil)
From Egypt marched; and Jacob's Seed
From Bondage in a foreign Soil.
2. Jehovah, for his Residence,
Chose out imperial Judah's Tent,
His Mansion-Royal, and from thence
Through Israel's Camp his Orders sent.
3. The distant Sea with Terror saw,
And from the Almighty's Presence fled;
Old Iordan's Streams, surpised with Aw,
Retreated to their Fountain's Head.
4. The taller Mountains skipp'd, like Rams,
When Danger near the Fold they spy;
To see their Fright, the Hills, like Lambs,
Leaped after them, not knowing why.
5. O Sea, what made your Tide withdraw,
And naked leave your oozy Bed?
Why Iordan^ against Nature's Law,
Recoil'dst thou to thy Fountain's Head?
6. Why Mountains did you skip like Rams^
When Danger does approach the Fold?
Why after you the Hills like Lambs
When they their Leaders Flight behold?
7. Earth tremble on; well may thou fear,
Thy Lord and Maker's Face to see;
When Jacob's awful God draws near,
It Is time for Earth, and Seas to flee.
8. To flee from God, who Nature's Law
Repeals and cancels at his Will;
Who Springs from flinty Rocks can draw,
And thirsty Vales with Water fill.
PSALM CXV.
1. LOrd, not to us, we claim no Share,
But to thy sacred Name
Give Glory, for thy Mercy's sake,
And Truth's eternal Fame.
2. Why should the Heathen cry, where is now
The God whom we adore?
3. Convince 'em that in Heaven thou art,
And uncontrolled thy Power.
4. Their Gods but Gold and Silver are,
The Work of mortal Hands:
5. With speechless Mouth, and sightless Eyes
The molten Idol stands.
6. The Pageant-thing has Ears and Nose,
But neither hears nor smells.
7. Hands, Feet, but neither feels nor moves;
No Breath within it dwells.
8. Such senseless Stocks, that to compare
With them we nothing find,
But those who on their Help rely,
And them for Gods designed.
9. O Israel, make the Lord your Trust,
Who is your Help and Shield;
10. Priests, Levites trust in him alone
Who only Help can yield.
11. Let all who fear the Lord, for Aid,
On him they fear, rely;
Who them in Danger can defend,
And all their Wants supply.
12, 13. Of us he often has mindful been,
And Isr'el's House will bless,
Priests, Levites, Proselytes, even All
Who his great Name confess.
14. On you, and on your Heirs, increase
Of Blessings he will bring;
15. Thrice happy you, who Favorites are
Of this Almighty King.
16. Heaven's highest Orb of Glory, He
His Empire's Seat designed;
And gave this lower Globe of Earth
A Portion to Mankind.
17. They who in Death and Silence sleep
To him no Praise afford:
18. But we will bless for evermore
Our ever-living Lord.
PSALM CXVI.
1. MY Soul with Ecstasies of Love
Entirely is possessed,
Because the Lord has deigned to hear
The Voice of my Request.
2. Since he has now his Ear inclined,
I never will despair,
But, while my Life shall last, to him
Address my humble Pray'r^
3. With deadly Sorrows compast round,
With hellish Pangs oppressed,
When Grief and Anguish filled my Heart,
And heaved my throbbing Breast;
4. On God's Almighty Name I called,
And thus to him I prayed;
Lord, I beseech thee save my Soul,
With Sorrow quite dismayed.
5, 6. How just and merciful is God!
How gracious is the Lord!
Who saves the Simple, and to me
Does timely Help afford.
7. Then, free from racking Cares, my Soul,
Resume thy wonted Rest;
For God has wond'rously to thee
His bounteous Love expressed.
8. He, when Death threat'ned, soon removed
My Dangers and my Fears;
My Feet from falling he secured,
And dried my Eyes from Tears.
9. The whole remaining Stock of Life
Which he to me has lent,
Shall therefore in his Service be
With grateful Duty spent.
10, 11. In God I trusted, and of him
In greatest straits did boast;
(For in my Flight all hopes of Aid
From faithless Man were lost:)
12, 13. Then what Return to him shall I
For all his Goodness make^
I Will praise his Name, and with glad Zeal
The Cup of Blessing ^ake.
14, 15. The Vows I made to God, I Will pay
In all his People's sight.
Because by him his Servant's blood
Was never counted light.
16. Lord, by how many Ties must I
To thy Obedience bow?
Before, thy humble Handmaid's Son,
Thy ransomed Captive now!
17, 18. To Thee I Will Offerings bring of Praise;
And whilst I bless thy Name,
The just performance of my Vows
To all thy Saints proclaim.
19. They, in thy holy City met,
And in thy House shall join,
With one Consent thy Name to bless,
And mix their Praise with mine.
PSALM CXVII.
1. WIth cheerful Notes let all the Earth
To Heaven their Voices raise;
Let all, inspired with godly Mirth,
Sing solemn Hymns of Praise:
2. God's ^ender Mercy knows no bound,
His Truth shall never decay;
Then let the willing Nations round,
This grateful Tribute pay.
PSALM CXVIII.
1, 2. O Praise the Lord, for he is good,
His Mercies never decay:
That his kind Favors ever last,
Let thankful Israel say.
3, 4. Their Sense of his eternal Love
Let Aaron's House express;
And that it never fails, let all
That fear the Lord confess.
5. To God I made my humble Moan
With Troubles quite oppressed;
And he released me from my Straits,
And granted my Request.
6. Since therefore God does on my side
So graciously appear,
What Man against me can contrive
I never need to fear.
7. Since God with those that aid my Cause
Himself a Party makes;
I need not doubt, on all my Foes
A just Revenge to take.
8, 9. For better it is to trust in God,
And have the Lord our Friend,
Than on the greatest humane Pow'^
For Safety to depend.
10, 11. Tho many Nations, closely leagued
Did often beset me round;
Yet, by his boundless Power sustained,
I did them all confound.
12. They swarmed like Bees, and yet their Rage
Was but a short-lived Blaze;
For whilst on God I still relied,
I vanquished them with Ease.
13. When All together pressed me hard,
In hopes to make me fall;
The Lord vouchsafed to take my part
And saved me from them all.
14. The Honor of my strange Escape
To him alone belongs;
He is my Savior and my Strength,
The Theme of all my Songs.
15. The Just's Abode resounds with Joy,
By him preserved from Harm;
For wondrous things are brought to pass
By his almighty Arm.
16. He, by his vast resistless Power,
Has endless Honor won;
The saving Strength of his Right Hand
Amazing Works has done.
17. God will not suffer me to fall
But yet prolong my Days;
That by declaring all his Works,
I may advance his Praise.
18. The Lord has chast'ned me in Love
And great Afflictions laid;
But has not given me over to those
That did my Life invade.
19. Then open wide the Temple-Gates
To which the Just repair;
That I may enter in and praise
My great Deliv'rer there^
20, 21. Within those Gates of God's abode
To which the Righteous press;
Since thou have heard and set me safe,
Thy holy Name I Will bless.
22, 23. That Stone is now the Corner's Head,
Which Builders did despise;
This is the Lord's amazing Act,
And wondrous in our Eyes.
24, 25. This is God's Day; let all the Land
Exalt their cheerful Voice:
Lord, we beseech thee save us now,
And make us still rejoice.
26. Him that approaches in God's Name,
Let all the Assembly bless;
We that belong to God's own House,
Have wished you good Success.
27. God is the Lord, through whom we all
Both Light and Comfort find;
With Cords unto the Altar's Horns,
The destined Victim bind.
28. Thou art my Lord, O God, and still
I Will praise thy holy Name;
Because Thou only art my God,
I Will celebrate thy Fame.
29. O then, with me, give Thanks to God,
Who still does gracious prove;
And let the Tribute of our Praise
Be endless as his Love.
PSALM CXIX.
ALEPH.
1. HOW blessed are they who always keep
The pure and perfect way!
Who never from the sacred Road
Of God's Commandments stray!
2. Thrice blessed! who to his righteous Laws
Have still obedient been!
And warmly urged by hearty Zeal
His Favor seek to win!
3. Such Men, averse from Ill, abhor
To do a wicked Deed;
But in the Path which he prescribes
With constant Care proceed.
4. But it is to thy Commands, O Lord,
This Happiness we ow.
Thou bid'st us keep those upright Laws
From which such Comforts flow.
5. O then that thy most holy Will
Might over my Ways preside!
And I the course of all my Life
By thy Directions guide!
6. Then should I walk erect and bold,
From all Confusion free;
Convinced, with Joy, that all my Ways
With thy Commands agree.
7. My upright Heart shall my glad Mouth
With cheerful Praises fill;
When, by thy righteous Judgments taught,
I fully learn thy Will.
8. So to thy sacred Laws shall I
All due observance pay;
O then forsake me not, my God,
Nor cast me quite away.
BETH.
9. How shall the young preserve their Ways
From vile Pollutions free?
By making all their Course of Life
With thy Commands agree.
10. With hearty Zeal, for Thee I seek,
To Thee for Succor pray;
O suffer not my careless Steps
From thy just Precepts stray.
11. Safe in my Heart, and closely hid
Thy Word, my Treasure, lies;
And ready waits with timely Aid,
When sinful Passions rise.
12. Secured by that, my grateful Soul
Shall ever bless thy Name:
O ^each me then my Life to come
By thy just Laws to frame.
13. My Lips, unlockt by pious Zeal,
To others have declared,
How much the Judgments of thy Mouth
Deserve our high Regard.
14. Whilst in the Way of thy Commands
More solid Joy I found,
Than had I been with vast Increase
Of envied riches crowned.
15. Therefore thy just and upright Laws,
Shall always fill my Mind;
And those sound Rules which thou prescrib'st
All due Respect shall find.
16. To keep thy Statutes undefac'd
Shall be my constant Joy;
The strict Remembrance of thy Word^
Shall all my Thoughts employ.
GIMEL.
17. Be gracious to thy Servant, Lord,
Do thou my Life defend;
That I, according to thy Word,
My Time to come may spend.
18. Enlighten both my Eyes and Mind,
That so I may discern
The wondrous things which they behold
Who thy just precepts learn.
19. Tho, like a Stranger in the Land^
From place to place I stray,
Thy righteous Judgments from my sig^^
O hide thou not away.
20. My fainting Soul is almost pined,
With earnest Longing spent;
Whilst always on the eager Search
Of thy just Will, intent.
21. Thy sharp Rebuke shall crush the Proud,
Whom still thy Curse pursues;
Who in thy righteous Paths to walk^
Presumptuou^ly refuse.
22. But far from me do thou, O Lord,
Contempt and Shame remove;
For I thy sacred Laws affect
With undissembled Love.
23. Tho Princes often, in Council met,
Against thy Servant spoke;
Yet I, thy Statutes to observe,
My chiefest Business make.
24. For thy Commands have always been
My Comfort and Delight;
By them I learn with prudent Care,
And guide my Counsels right.
DALETH.
25. My Soul's oppressed with deadly Care,
And to the Dust does cleave;
Revive me, Lord, and let me now
Thy promised Aid receive.
26. To thee I still declared my Ways,
And thou inclin'dst thine Ear:
O teach me then my future Life
By thy just Laws to steer.
27. If thou will make me know thy Laws,
And by their Guidance walk,
The wondrous Works which thou have done
Shall be my constant Talk.
28. But see my Soul within me sinks,
Pressed down with weighty Care;
O make thy Promise good, and soon
My wasted Strength repair.
29. For far from me be all false Ways
And lying Arts removed!
But kindly grant I still may keep
The Path by thee approved.
30. Thy faithful Ways, thou God of Truth,
My happy Choice I Have made;
Thy Judgments, as my Rule of Life,
Before me always laid.
31. My Care has been to make my Life
With thy just Laws agree;
O then preserve thy Servant, Lord,
From Shame and Ruin free.
32. So in the Ways of thy Commands
Shall I with Pleasure run,
And with a Heart enlarged with Joy
Successfully go on.
HE.
33. Instruct me in thy Statutes, Lord,
Thy righteous Paths display;
And I from them, through all my Life,
Will never perversely stray.
34. If thou true Wisdom from above
Wilt graciously impart,
To keep thy perfect Laws, I Will still
Apply my zealous Heart.
35. Direct me in the sacred Ways
To which thy Precepts lead;
Because my chief Delight has been
Thy Righteous Paths to tread.
36. Do thou to thy most just Commands
Incline my willing Heart;
Let no Desire of Worldly Wealth
From them my Thoughts divert.
37. From those vain Objects turn my Eyes
Which this false World displays;
But active Life and Vigor give
To keep thy righteous Ways.
38. Confirm the Promise which thou made,
And give thy Servant Aid,
Who to transgress thy sacred Laws
Is awfully afraid.
39. The foul Disgrace I Have cause to fear
In mercy Lord remove;
For all the ^udgments thou ordain'st
Are full of Grace and Love.
40. Thou know how, after thy Commands,
My longing Heart does pant;
O then make haste to raise me up,
And promised Succor grant.
VAV.
41. Thy constant Blessing, Lord, bestow,
To cheer my grateful Heart;
To me according to thy Word,
Thy saving Health impart.
42. So shall I, when my Foes upbraid,
This ready Answer make;
In God I trust, who never will
His faithful Promise break.
43. Then let not quite the Word of Truth
Be from my Mouth removed;
Since still my ground of steadfast Hope
Thy just Decrees have proved.
44. So I to keep thy righteous Laws
Will all my Study bend;
From Age to Age, my time to come
In their Observance spend.
45. Ever long I trust to walk at large,
From all Encumbrance free;
Because I aimed to make my Life
With thy Commands agree.
46. Thy Laws shall be my constant Talk;
And Princes shall attend,
Whil^t I the Justice of thy Ways
With Confidence defend.
47. My longing Heart and ravished Soul
Shall both overflow with Joy;
When in thy loved Commandments I
My happy Hours employ.
48. Then will I to thy loved Decrees
Lift up my willing Hands;
My Care and Business then shall be
To study thy Commands.
ZAIN.
49. According to thy promised Grace,
Thy Favor, Lord, extend.
Make good to me the Word, on which
Thy Servants Hopes depend.
50. That, only Comfort in D^stress
Did all my Griefs control;
Thy Word, when Troubles hemmed me round,
Revived my fainting Soul.
51. Insulting Foes did proudly laugh,
And all my Hopes deride;
Yet from thy Law, not all their Taunts
Could make me turn aside.
52. Thy Judgments, Lord, of ancient date
I then recalled to mind.
And, with such Thoughts refreshed, my Soul
Did constant Comfort find.
53. Sometimes I stand amazed, like one
With deadly Horror struck,
To think how all my sinful Foes
Have thy just Laws forsook.
54. But I thy Statutes and Decrees
My cheerful Anthems made;
Whilst through strange Lands and desert Wilds
I like a Pilgrim strayed.
55. Thy Name, that cheered my Heart by day,
Has ^ill'd my Thoughts by night;
I then resolved by thy just Laws,
To guide my Steps a right.
56. That Peace of Mind, which has my Soul
In deep Distress sustained,
By strict Obedience to thy Will
I happily obtained.
CHETH.
57. O Lord, my God, my Portion thou
And sure possession art;
Thy Words I steadfastly resolve
To treasure in my Heart.
58. With all the strength of warm Desires
I did thy Grace implore;
Disclose, according to thy Word,
Thy Mercies boundless store.
59. With due Reflection and strict Care
On all my Ways I thought;
And so reclaimed to thy just Paths
My wandering Steps I brought.
60. I lost no time, but made great haste,
Resolved, without delay,
To watch, that I might never more
From thy Commandments stray.
61. Tho numerous Troops of sinful Men
To rob me have combined;
Yet I thy pure and righteous Laws
Will ever keep in mind.
62. In dead of night will I arise,
To sing thy solemn Praise;
Because convinced how much I ough^
To love thy righteous Ways.
63. To such as fear thy holy Name
My self I Will closely join;
To all who their obedient Wills
To thy Commands resign^
64. Over all the Earth thy Mercy; Lord,
Abundantly is shed;
O make me then exactly learn,
Thy sacred Paths to tread.
TETH.
65. With me, thy Servant, thou have dealt
Most graciously, O Lord,
Repeated Benefits bes^ow'd,
According to thy Word.
66. Teach me the sacred Skill, by which
Right Judgmen^ is attained,
Who in belief of thy Commands
Have steadfastly remained.
67. Before Affliction stopped my Course,
My Footsteps went astray;
But I have since been disciplined
Thy Precepts to obey.
68. Thou art, O Lord, supreamly good,
And all thou do is so;
On me, thy Statutes to discern,
The saving Skill be^tow.
69. The Proud have forged malicious Lies
My spotless Fame to stain:
But my fixed Heart, without Reserve,
Thy Precepts shall retain.
70. While pampered they, with prosperous Ills,
In sensual Pleasures live,
My Soul can relish no Delight
But what thy Precepts give.
71. It Is good for me that I have felt
Severe Affliction's Rod,
That I may duly learn and keep
The Statutes of my God.
72. The Law that from thy Mouth proceeds
Of more esteem I hold,
Than untoucht Mines, than thousand Mines
Of Silver and of Gold.
IOD.
73. To me, who am the Workmanship
Of thy almighty Hands,
The Heavenly Understanding give
To learn thy just Commands.
74. My Preservation to thy Saints
Strong Comfort will afford,
To see Success attend my Hopes
That trusted in thy Word.
75. That right thy Judgments are, I now
By sure Experience see,
And that in Faithfulness, O Lord,
Thou have afflicted me.
76. Let thy kind Mercy Comfort bring
For all my Griefs at last,
According to thy gracious Word
To me thy Servant past.
77. To me thy saving Grace restore,
That I again may live;
Whose Soul can relish no Delight
But what thy Precepts give.
78. Defeat the Proud, who unprovoked,
To ruin me have sought,
Who only on thy sacred Laws
Employ my harmless Thought.
79. Let those that fear thy Name espouse
My Cause and those alone
Who have by strict and pious Search
Thy Testimonies known.
80. In thy blessed Statutes let my Heart
Continue ever sound,
That Guilt and Shame, the Sinners Lo^,
May never me confound.
CAPH.
81. My Soul with long Expectance faints
To see thy saving Grace;
Yet still on thy unerring Word,
My Confidence I place.
82. My very Eyes consume and fail
With waiting for thy Word;
Thy Comfort and long promised Aid
O when will thou afford?
83. My Flesh like shriv'led Parchment shows
That long in Smoke is set;
Yet no Affliction me can force
Thy Statutes to forget.
84. How many are thy Servant's Days?
When will thou Lord redress
My Wrongs? and Judgment execute
On them who me oppress?
85. The proud have dug a Pit for me,
Who have no other Foes,
But who are Reprobates to Thee
And thy just Laws oppose.
86. All thy Commandments are composed
Of Truth and Equity:
Men persecute me without Cause,
Thou, Lord, my Helper be.
87. To snatch me from the Face of Earth
Their Spite almost prevailed;
Yet to thy righteous Precepts I
My Duty never failed.
88. Thy wonted Kindness, Lord, restore,
My drooping Heart to cheer;
That by thy Testimonies, I
My Life's whole Course may steer^
LAMED.
89. For ever and for ever, Lord,
Thou do the same remain.
In Heaven thy Word established is,
And does that Heaven sustain.
90. Through circling Ages, Lord, thy Truth
Immoveably shall stand
As Earth, whose Fabric is upheld
By thy almighty Hand.
91. All things the Course by Thee ordained
Even to this day fulfill;
They are thy faithful Subjects all,
And Servants of thy Will.
92. Unless thy sacred Law had been
My Comfort and Delight,
I must have fainted and expired
In dark Affliction's Night.
93. Thy Precepts therefore from my Thoughts
Shall never, Lord, depart;
For Thou, by them, have to new Life
Restored my dying Heart.
94. As I am thine, entirely thine,
Protect me, Lord, from Harm;
Who have thy Precepts sought to know,
And carefully perform.
95. The Wicked have their Ambush laid
My guiltless Life to take;
But in the midst of Danger I
Thy Word my Study make.
96. I Have seen an end of what we call
Perfection here below,
But thy Commandments, like thy self,
No Change or Period know.
MEM.
97. The Love that to thy Law I bear
No Language can display;
They with fresh Wonders entertain
My ravished Thoughts all day.
98. Through thy Commands I wiser grow
Than all my subtle Foes;
For they are with me to direct
And all my Ways dispose.
99. From me my former Teachers now
May abler Counsel take;
Because thy Testimonies I
My constant Study make.
100. In Understanding I excel
The Sages of our days;
Because by thy unerring Rules
I order all my ways.
101. My Feet with Care I have refrained
From every sinful way,
That to thy sacred Word I might
Entire Obedience pay.
102. I have not from thy Judgments strayed,
By vain Desires misled;
For, Lord, thou have instructed me
Thy righteous Path to tread.
103. How sweet are all thy words to me;
O what divine Repast!
How more delicious to my Soul
Than Honey to my Taste.
104. Taught by thy sacred Precepts, I
With Heavenly Skill am blessed,
The treacherous ways of Sin to shun,
And utterly detest.
NVN.
105. Thy Word is to my Feet a Lamp
The way of Truth to show;
A Watch-light to point out the Path,
In which I ought to go.
106. I swear, and to my solemn Oath
Resolve to prove sincere,
That to thy righteous Judgments I
Will steadfastly adhere.
107. Since I with Griefs am so oppressed
That I can bear no more,
According to thy Word, do thou
My fainting Soul restore.
108. Let the Oblations of my Praise
With Thee Acceptance find,
And in thy righteous Judgments, Lord,
Instruct my willing Mind.
109. Tho Death and Danger me surround,
My Soul they cannot aw,
Nor with continual Terrors keep
From thinking on thy Law.
110. My wicked and invet'rate Foes
For me their Snares have laid;
Yet I have kept the upright Path,
Nor from thy Precepts strayed.
111. Thy Testimonies I have made
My Heritage and Choice;
For they, when other Comforts fail,
My drooping Heart rejoice.
112. My Heart thy Statutes to perform
With early Zeal begun,
And shall continue the same Course
Till that of Life is run.
SAMECH.
113. Deceitful Thoughts and Practices
I utterly detest;
But for thy Law Affection bear
Too great to be expressed.
114. My Hiding Place, my Refuge-Tow^r
And Shield art thou, O Lord,
I firmly anchor all my Hopes
On thy unerring Word.
115. Hence ye that trade in Wickedness,
Approach not my Abode;
For firmly I resolve to keep
The Precepts of my God.
116. According to thy gracious Word,
From Danger set me free,
Nor make me of those Hopes ashamed
That I repose on Thee.
117. Uphold me, so shall I be safe;
And, rescued from Distress,
To thy Decrees continually
My just Respect address.
118. The wicked thou have trod to Earth,
Who from thy Statutes strayed;
Their vile Deceit the Recompense
Of their own Falsehood made.
119. The Wicked from thy holy Land
Thou do, like Dross, r^move,
Charmed with such Justice, therefore I
Thy Testimonies love.
120. Yet with that Love they make me dread
Lest I should so offend,
When on Transgressors I behold
Thy Judgments thus descend.
AIN.
121. Judgment and Justice I have wrought,
O therefore, Lord, engage
In my Defense, nor give me up
To my Oppressors Rage.
122. The Surety for thy Servant be,
Converting this Distress
To Good for me; nor let the Proud
My guiltless Soul oppress.
123. My Eyes, alas! begin to fail,
In long Expectance held,
Till thy Salvation they behold,
And righteous Word fulfilled.
124. To me, thy Servant, in Di^^ress
Thy wonted Grace display,
And discipline my willing Heart
Thy Statutes to obey.
125. On me, devoted to thy Fear,
The sacred Skill bestow,
That of thy Testimonies I
The full extent may know.
126. It Is time, high time for Thee, O Lord,
Thy Vengeance to employ,
When Men with open Violence
Thy sacred Law des^roy.
127. Yet their Contempt of thy Commands
But makes their Value rise
With me, who Gold, refined with skill,
Compared with them despise.
128. Thy Precepts therefore I esteem
In all respects divine,
By them instructed to detest
And all false Ways decline.
PE.
129. Who can express how wonderful
Thy Testimonies are?
Which therefore to perform my Soul
Employs her utmost Care.
130. The very Entrance to thy Word
Celestial Light displays;
The Knowledge of true Happiness
To simplest Minds conveys.
131. With open Mouth I waiting stood,
And panted with Desire,
That of thy wise Commands I might
The sacred Skill acquire.
132. With Favor, Lord, look down on me
Thy Mercy who implore,
As thou art wont to visit them
Who thy blessed Name adore.
133. Directed by thy heavenly Word
Let all my Footsteps be;
Nor Wickedness of any kind
Dominion have over me.
134. Release, entirely set me free
From persecuting Hands,
That, unmolested, I may learn,
And practice thy Commands.
135. On me, devoted to thy Fea^,
Lord make thy Face to shine,
Thy Statutes both to know and keep
My Heart with Zeal incline.
136. My Eyes to weeping Fountains turn,
Whence briny Rivers press,
To see Mankind, without Remorse,
Thy sacred Law transgress.
TSADE.
137. Thou art the righteous Judge, on whom
Wronged Innocence may trust;
And, like thy self, thy Judgments, Lord,
In all respects are just.
138. As just those Testimonies were,
Which thou did first decree,
So all with Faithfulness performed
Succeeding Times shall see.
139. With Zeal my Flesh consumes away,
My Soul with Anguish frets,
To see my Foes contemn, at once,
Thy P^omises and Threats.
140. Yet each neglected Word of thine,
(Howe^er by them despised,)
Is pure, and for eternal Truth
By me, thy Servant prized.
141. Brought, for thy sake, to low Estate,
Contempt from All I find;
Yet no Affronts or Wrongs can drive
Thy Precepts from my Mind.
142. Thy Righteousness shall then endure,
When Time it self is past;
Thy Law is Truth it ^elf, that Truth
Which shall for ever last.
143. Tho Trouble, Anguish, Doubts and Dread
To compass me unite,
Beset with Danger, still I make
Thy Pr^cepts my Delight.
144. Eternal and unerring Rules
Thy Testi^onie^ give:
Teach me the Wisdom that will make
My Soul for ever live.
KOPH.
145. With my whole Heart to God I called,
Lord h^ar my earne^t Cry;
And I, thy Statutes to perform,
Will all my Care apply.
146. Again more fervently I prayed,
O save me, that I may
Thy Testimonies thoroughly know
And stedfa^^ly obey.
147. My earlier Prayer the dawning Day
Prevented, while I cried
To Him on whose engaging Word
My Hope alone relied.
148. With Zeal have I awaked before
The Midnight Watch was set,
That I, of thy mysterious Word,
May perfect Knowledge get.
149. Lord, hear my supplicating Voice.
And wonted Favor show;
O quicken me, and so approve
Thy Judgments ever true.
150. My persecuting Foes advance
And hourly nearer draw;
What Treatment can I hope from them
Who violate thy Law?
151. Tho they draw nigh, my Comfort is
Thou, Lord, art yet more near,
Thou, whose Commands are righteous all,
Thy Promises sincere.
152. Concerning thy divine Decrees
My Soul has known of old^
How true they were, and shall their Truth
To endless Ages hold.
RESCH.
153. Consider my A^^li^tion, Lord,
And me from Bondage draw;
Think on thy Servant in Distress,
Who never forgets thy Law.
154. Plead Thou my Cause; to that and me
Thy timely Aid afford;
With Beams of Mercy quicken me
According to thy Word.
155. From hardened Sinners thou remov'st
Salvation far away;
It Is just thou should withdraw from them
Who from thy Statutes stray.
156. As great thy tender Mercies are
To those who Thee adore;
According to thy Judgments, Lord,
My fainting Hopes restore.
157. A numerous Host of spiteful Foes
Against my Life combine;
But all too few t'inforce my Soul
Thy Statu^es to decline.
158. Those bold Transgressors I beheld,
And was with Grief oppressed,
To see with what audacious Pride
Thy Covenant they transgressed.
159. Yet while they slight, consider, Lord,
How I thy Precepts love;
O therefore quicken me with Beams
Of Mercy from above.
160. As from Time's Birth thy Word's firm Truth
Has held through Ages past,
Thy righteous Judgments shall, entire,
To endless Ages la^t.
SCHIN.
161. Tho mighty Tyrants, without Cause,
C^nspire my Blood to shed,
Thy sacred Word has only Power
To strike my Heart with Dread.
162. Yet that same Word my Breast with Beams
Of joyful Rapture warms;
Not Conquest, Spoil and Triumph have
More bright transporting Charms.
163. Perfidious Practices and Lies
I utterly detest;
But to thy Laws affection bear
Too vast to be expressed.
164. Sev'n times a day, with Voice and Heart,
Thy Praises I resound,
Because I find thy Judgments all
With Truth and Justice crowned.
165. Secure, substantial Peace have they
Who truly love thy Law;
No smiling Mischief them can tempt,
Nor frowning Danger aw.
166. For thy Salvation I have hoped,
And tho so long delayed,
With cheerful Zeal and strictest Care
All thy Commands obeyed.
167. Thy Testimonies I have kept,
More dear to me than Light;
So loved and prized, they were at once
My Duty and Delight.
168. I kept thy Laws in view, lest I
Thy Precepts should decline.
Thy Ways observing, as I knew
Strict watch thou kepst on mine.
TAV.
169. To my Request and earnest Cry
Attend, O gracious Lord;
Inspire my Heart with heavenly Skill,
According to thy Word.
170. Let my repeated Prayer at last
Before thy Throne ascend;
According to thy plighted Word
To me Deliverance send.
171. Then shall my grateful Lips return
The Tribute of their Praise,
When Thou thy Counsels have reveal^d,
And taught me they just Ways.
172. My Tongue the Praises of thy Word
Shall thankfully resound,
Because thy Promises are all
With just performance crowned.
173. Let thy Almighty Arm appear
And bring me timely Aid;
Protect me as thy Precepts I
My Heart's free Choice h^ve made.
174. My Soul has waited long to see
Thy saving Grace restored;
Nor Comfort knew, but what thy Laws,
Thy heavenly Laws afford.
175. Prolong my Life, that I may sing
My great Restorer's Praise;
My Soul, that guiltless is oppressed,
Let thy just Judgments raise.
176. Like some lo^t Sheep, I Have strayed so long
Till I despair to sind
My home-ward Way; thy Servant seek,
Who keeps thy Laws in Mind.
PSALM CXX.
1. Distressed, I often have cried
To God, who never denied
To rescue me from Wrongs:
2. Once more Deliverance send,
From lying Lips defend,
And from the stand'ring Tongue.
3. What Profit can accrue?
What Punishment is due,
Perfidious Tongue, to thee?
4. Thy Sting on thee shall turn;
Of Flames, that fiercely burn,
The Fuel thou shall be.
5. How wretched is my Doom,
A Sojourner become,
In Mesech's desert Soil!
With Kedar's Tents enclosed,
To Salvages exposed,
Who live on Theft and Spoil.
6. My Dwelling is with thos^
Who are to Peace sworn Foes,
And Pleasure take in Harms;
7 Sweet Peace is all I seek,
But when of Peace I speak;
They strait call out to Arms.
PSALM CXXI.
1. TO Sion's Hill I lift my Eyes,
From thence expecting Aid;
2. From Sion's Hill and Sion's God,
Who Heaven and Earth has made.
3. Thy Throne and Person both are safe,
Thy Guardian will not sleep;
4. His Watchful Care that Israel guards
Will Isr'el's Monarch keep.
5. Sheltred beneath the Almighty's Wings,
Thou shall securely rest,
6. Where Noonday Suns nor Midnight Moons
With Heat or Cold molest.
7. From common Accidents of Life
His Care shall guard thee still:
From the blind Strokes of Chance, and Foes
That ^^e ^n wait to kill.
8. At home, abroad, in Peace, in War,
Thy God shall thee defend;
Conduct thee through Life's Pilgrimage
Safe to thy Journey's End.
PSALM CXXII.
1. O 'Twas a joyful Sound to hear
Our Tribes devoutly say,
Up Israel, to the Temple haste,
And keep your Festal Day.
2. At Salem's Courts we must appear
With our united Powers;
3. In strong and beauteous Order ranged
Like her compacted Towers.
4. It Is thither, by divine Command
The Tribes of God repair,
Before his Ark to celebrate
His Name with Praise and Prayer.
5. Tribunals s^and erected there;
Where Equity takes place;
There stand the Courts and Palaces
Of royal David^s Race.
6. O, pray for Salem's Peace, all you
That happy wish to be,
For they shall prosper best who bear
Most cordial Love to Thee.
7. May Peace within thy sacred Walls
A constant Gue^t be f^^nd,
With Plen^y and Pro^p^rity
Thy Palaces be crowned.
8. For my dear Brethren's sake, and Friends
No less than Brethren dear,
I'^l pray, -- May Peace in Salem's Tow'^s
A constant Guest appear.
9. But most of all I Will seek thy Good,
And ever wish thee well,
For Sion and the Temple's sake,
Where God vouchsafes to dwell.
PSALM CXXIII.
1. TO Thee, who dwell'st above the Skies,
I lift my supplicating Eyes;
2. As Servants watch their Masters Hands,
And Maids their Mistresses Commands.
Even so, on our Almighty Lord,
Wait we till Mercy he afford.
3. Have mercy, Lord, on us, chastis'd,
Nor only wretched but despised.
4. Our Soul no longer can sustain
The double Load of Scorn and Pain,
While they grow proud by our distress
And roll in Ea^e who us oppress.
PSALM CXXIV.
1. LET Israel say, had not the Lord
Been pleased to interpose,
2. Had God himself not took our Part
When Men against us rose.
3, 4, 5. Their Wrath had swallowed us alive,
Devoured without control;
Their Spite and Pride's united Flood
Had quite overwhelmed our Soul.
6. But praised be our eternal Lord,
Who rescued us that Day^
Nor to their salvage Jaws gave up
Our threat'ned Lives a Prey.
7. Our Soul is like a Bird escaped
From out the Fowler's Net;
The Snare is broke, their Hopes are crost^
And we at Freedom set.
8. Secure in his Almighty Name,
Our Confidence remains,
Who, as he made both Heaven and Earth,
Of both sole Monarch reigns.
PSALM CXXV.
1. WHO place on Sion's God their Trust,
Like Sion's Rock shall stand.
Like her unmoveably be fixed
By his Almighty Hand.
2. Look how the Hills of Solyma
Jerusalem enclose,
So stands the Lord around his Saints
To guard 'em from their Foes.
3. The Wicked may afflict the Just,
But never too long oppress,
Nor force him by Despair to seek
Base means for his Redress.
4. Be good, O righteous God, to thos^
Who Righteousness affect;
The Heart that Innocence retains
Let Innocence protect.
5. Who turn aside to crooked Paths,
The Lord shall them destroy;
Cut off the Unjust, but crown the Sain^s
With lasting Peace and Joy^
PSALM CXXVI.
WHen Sion's God her Sons recalled
From long Captivity,
It seemed at first a pleasing Dream
Of what we wished to see.
2. But soon with unaccustomed Mirth
Our Voice we did employ,
And fung our great Restorer's Praise
In thankful Hymns of Joy.
Our Heathen Foes repining stood,
Yet were compelled to own
That great and wondrous was the Work great
Our God for us had done.
3. 'Twas great, say they; 'twas wondrous
Much more should we confess;
The Lord has done great things, whereof
We reap the glad Success.
4. To us bring back the Remnant, Lord,
Of Isr'el's Captive Bands,
More welcome than refreshing Showers
To parcht and thirsty Lands.
5. That we, whose Work commenced in Tears,
May see our Labors thrive,
Till finished with Success, to make
Our drooping Hearts revive.
6. Tho he despond that sows his Grain,
Yet doubtless he shall come
To bind his full-ear'd Shea^es, and sing
A joyful Harvest-home.
PSALM CXXVII.
1. WE build with fruitless Cost, unless
The Lord the Pile sustain,
Unless the Lord the City keep,
The Watchman wakes in vain.
2. In vain we rise before the Day,
And late to Rest repair,
Allow no Respite to our Toil,
And eat the Bread of Care:
Supplies of Life, with little Pains,
He on his Saints bestows;
He crowns their Labor with Success,
Their Nights with sound Repose.
3. So Children are an Heritage
Sent from the Almighty Lord,
A teeming Womb, his Favour's Gift,
And virtuous Li^e's Reward.
4. As Arrows in a Giant's Hand
With dreadful Grace appea^,
Even so the Sons of vigorous Yout^
Their Parents Glory are.
5. Happy the Man whose Quiver's filled
With these defensive Arms;
He need's not fear to meet his Foe,
At War or Law's Alarms.
PSALM CXXVIII.
1. THE Man is blessed who fears the Lord,
Nor Worship only pays,
But keeps his Steps confined with Care,
To his appointed Ways.
2. Thou shall upon the sweet Returns
Of thy own Labor feed;
Without Dependence live, and see
Thy Wishes all succeed.
3. Thy Wife, like a domestic Vine;
Her generous Fruit shall bring;
Thy Children, like young Olive-plants,
About thy Table spring:
4. Who fears the Lord shall thus be blessed;
5. From Sion God shall bless,
And grant him all his Days to see
Ierusalem's Success.
6. Survive till Heirs of Heirs from him
Descend with vast Increase:
Twice blessed; in his own prosperous State,
And more in Isr'el's Peace.
PSALM CXXIX.
1. UP from my Youth, may Israel say,
They often have me a^^ail'd,
2. Reduced me often to heavy Straits,
But never yet prevailed.
3. They often have plowed my patient Back
With Furrows deep and long,
4. But our just God has broke their Chains,
And rescued us from Wrong.
5. Defeat, Confusion, shameful Rout^
Be still the Doom of those,
Their righteous Doom, who Sion hate,
And Sion's God oppose.
6. With too much Heat, and want of Root,
Untimely let 'em fade,
Like Corn upon our Houses Tops,
That withers in the Blade.
7. With which no Reaper fills his Arms,
But unregarded leaves;
Nor Binder thinks it worth his Pains
To fold it into Sheaves.
8. No Traveller that journeys by
Vouchsafes a Minute's Stop
TO afford it one kind Look, or w^sh
Heaven's Blessing on the Crop.
PSALM CXXX.
1. FRom lowest Regions of Despair,
To God I sent my Cry,
2. Lord, hear my supplicating Voice
And graciously reply.
3. Should thou severely mark our Faults,
Who can the Trial bear?
4. But thou forgiv'st, lest we despond,
And quite renounce thy Fear.
5. My Soul does with Impatience wait
For Thee the living Lord;
My Hopes are on thy Promise built,
Thy never-failing Word.
6. For Thee I look with longing Eyes,
Impatient of Delay;
Even more than Watchmen of the Night
To spy the dawning Day.
7. Let Israel on the Lord depend,
No Bounds his Mercy knows;
The plenteous Source and Spring from whence
Eternal Succor flows^
8. Whose friendly Currents kind supplies
To us in Want convey;
A healing Spring, a Spring to cleanse,
And wash our Guilt away.
PSALM CXXXI.
1. O Lord, I am not proud of Heart,
Nor cast a scornful Eye;
Nor my aspiring Thoughts employ
In things for me too high.
2. With Infant-Innocence, thou know
I have my self demeaned;
Lulled into Quiet like a Babe,
That from the Breast is weaned.
3. Like me let Israel hope in G^d
His Aid alone implore;
Both now and ever trust in him
Who lives for evermore.
PSALM CXXXII.
1. LET David, Lord, a constant Place
In thy Remembrance find;
Let all the Sorrows he endured
Be ever in thy mind.
2. Remember what a solemn Oath
To Thee, his Lord, he swore;
How to the mighty God he vowed,
Whom Jacob's Sons ado^e.
3, 4. I will not go into my House,
Nor to my Bed ascend;
No soft Repose shall close my Eyes
Nor Sleep my Ey-lids ben^;
5. Till for the Lord's designed Abode
I mark the destined Ground;
Till I a decent place of Rest
For Jacob's God have found.
6. The appointed Place, with Shouts of ^oy,
At Eph^atah we found,
And made the Fields, throughout the Wood,
Our glad Applause resound.
7. O with due Reverence let us then
To his Abode repair;
And prostrate a^ his Footstool fallen
Pour out our humble Prayer.
8. Arise, O Lord, and now possess
Thy constant Place of Rest,
Be that, not only with thy Ark,
But with thy Presence blessed.
9, 10. Cloth thou thy Priest with Righteousness.
And make thy Saints rejoice;
For David's sake, thy Servant, hear
Thy own Anointed's Voice.
11. God swear to David in his Truth,
(Nor shall his Oath be vain)
One of thy Offspring after thee
Upon thy Throne shall reign:
12. And if thy Seed my Covenant keep,
And to my Laws submit;
Their Children too upon thy Throne
For evermore shall sit.
13, 14. For Sion's God's peculiar Choice,
By him approved of well;
His place of everlasting Rest,
Where he desires to dwell.
15, 16. Her Store, says he, I will increase,
Her Poor with Plenty cloy;
I Will with Salvation cloth her Priests,
Her Saints shall shout for Joy.
17. There David's Horn shall bud and breed
A long successive Line,
And my anointed Servants there
Shall with fresh Luster shine.
18. The Faces of his vanquished Foes
Confusion shall o'er-spread;
Whilst blessed with good Success, his Crown
Shall flourish on his Head.
PSALM CXXXIII.
1. HOW vast must their advantage be!
How great their Pleasure prove!
Who live like Brethren, and consent
In Offices of Love!
2. Friendship is like that precious Oil
Which, poured on Aaron's Head,
Ran down his Beard, and over his Robes
It Is costly Moisture shed.
3. Like cool refreshing Dew, which does
On Hermon's Top distill;
Or like the early Drops that fall
On Sion's fruitful Hill.
For God to all, whose friendly Hearts
With mutual Love abound;
Has firmly promised length of Days
With constant Blessings crowned.
PSALM CXXXIV.
1. Bless God, ye Servants that attend
Upon his solemn State;
That in his Temple night by night
With humble Reverence wait:
2, 3. Within his House lift up your hands,
And bless his Holy Name;
From Sion bless thy Israel, Lord,
Who Earth and Heaven did frame.
PSALM CXXXV.
1. O Praise the Lord with one Consent
And magnify his Name;
Let all the Servants of the Lord
His worthy praise proclaim.
2. All ye that in the House of God
Attend with constant Care;
With those that to his outmost Courts
With humble Zeal repair.
3. For this our truest Interest is,
Glad Hymns of Praise to sing;
And with loud Songs to bless his Name's
A most delightful thing.
4. For God his own peculiar choice
The Sons of Jacob makes;
And Isr'el's Offspring for his own,
As precious Treasure takes.
5. For often have we, that God is great,
By glad Experience found;
And seen how he with wondrous Power
Above all Gods is crowned.
6. For he with unresisted Strength
Performs what ever he will,
In Heaven and Earth and wa^ry Stores
That Earth's deep Caverns fill.
7. He raises Vapors from the Ground,
Which poised in liquid Air,
Fall down at last in Showers, through which
His dreadful Lightnings glare:
He from his Storehouse brings the Winds;
8. And he, with vengeful Hand,
The Firstborn slew of Man and Beast,
Through Egypt's mourning Land.
9. He dreadful Signs and Wonders ^hew'd
In Egypt's stubborn Coasts;
Not Pharaoh could his Plagues escape,
Nor all his numerous Hosts.
10, 11. 'Twas he that various Nations smote,
And mighty Kings oppressed;
Sihon and Og, and all besides
That Canaan's Land possessed.
12, 13. He for his People of their Lands
A firm possession made;
For which his Fame shall always last,
His glory never fade.
14. For God shall soon his People's Cause
With tender Favor weigh;
Repent him of his Wrath, and turn
His kindled Rage away.
15. Those Idols, whose false Worship spreads
Over all the Heathen Lands,
Are made of Silver and of Gold,
The Work of humane Hands.
16, 17. They speak not with fictitious Tongues,
Nor see with polished Eyes;
Nor hear with fashioned Ears; no Breath
Their empty Mouth supplies.
18. As senseless as themselves are they
That all their Skill apply
To make them, or in dangerous Times,
On them for Aid rely.
19. Their just Returns of Thanks to God,
Let grateful Israel pay;
Nor let the Priests of Aaron's Stock
To bless the Lord delay;
20. Their Sense of his unbounded Love
Let Levi's House express;
And let all those that fear the Lord
His Name for ever bless:
21. Le^ all with Thanks his wondrous Works
In Sion's Courts proclaim,
And in Ierus'lem, where he dwells,
Exalt his Holy Name.
PSALM CXXXVI.
1. TO God, the mighty Lord,
Your joyful Thanks repeat
To him due Praise afford
As good as he is great:
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No time shall end
His boundless Love.
2, 3. To him whose wondrous Power
All other Gods obey,
Whom earthly Kings adore,
This grateful Homage pay:
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
4, 5. By his Almighty Hand
Amazing Works are wrought;
The Heavens by his Command
Were to perfection brought.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
6. He spread the Ocean round,
About the spacious Land;
And made the rising Ground
Above the Waters stand^
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
7, 8, 9. His matchless Power displays
The great and lasting Lights;
The Sun to rule by Days,
The Moon and Stars by Nights.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
10, 11, 12. He struck the Firstborn dead
Of Egypt's stubborn Land;
And thence his People led
With his resistless Hand.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
13, 14. By him the raging Sea,
As if in pieces rent,
Disclosed a middle way
Through which his People went.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
15. Where soon he overthrew
Proud Pharaoh and his Host,
Who seeking to pursue
Were in the Billows lost.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
16, 17, 18. Through Deserts vast and wild
He led the chosen Seed;
And famous Princes foiled,
And made great Monarchs bleed.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
19, 20. Sihon, whose potent Hand
Great Ammon's Scepter swayed,
And Og, whose stern Command
Rich Bashan's Land obeyed.
For he will prov^
Our constant Friend;
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
21, 22. And of his wondrous Grace,
Their Lands, whom he destroyed,
He gave to Isr'el's Race,
To be by them enjoyed.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
23, 24. He, in our depth of Woes,
On us with Favor thought;
And from our cruel Foes
In Peace and Safety brought.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
25, 26. By him the Food is given
On which all Creatures live:
To God who reigns in Heaven
Eternal Praises give.
For he will prove
Our constant Friend,
No Time shall end
His boundless Love.
PSALM CXXXVII.
1. WHen we, our wearied Limbs to rest,
Sat down by proud Euphrates Stream,
We wept, with doleful Thoughts oppressed,
And Sion was our mournful Theme.
2. Our Harps, that when with Joy we sung,
Were wont their tuneful Parts to bear,
With silent Strings neglected hung
On barren Trees that withered there.
3. Mean while our Foes^ with Pride inspired,
The Authors of our slavish Wrongs,
Music and Mirth of us required,
"Come, sing us one of Sion's Songs.
4. How shall we tune our Voice to sing?
Or touch our Harps with skilful Hands?
Shall Hymns of Joy to God our King,
Be sung by Slaves in foreign Lands?
5. Jerusalem, our happy Seat!
When I of thee forgetful prove,
Let then my trembling Hand forget
The speaking Strings with Art to move!
6. If I forget thee, let my Tongue
To my parcht Roof, quite useless cleave;
Or if I count not thee among
The chiefest Joys I can receive!
7. Remember, Lord, how Edom's Race,
In thy own City's fatal Day,
Cried out, It Is stately Walls deface,
And with the Ground quite level lay.
8. Proud Babel's Daughter, against whom
God's stern Decrees severely run;
Blessed shall he be that pays thee home,
The Ills which thou to us have done!
9. Thrice blessed, who, by just Fury led,
Shall from the Breast thy Children take,
And, with proud Rage, their tender Head,
Against the rugged Pavement break.
PSALM CXXXVIII.
1. WIth my whole Heart, my God and King,
Thy Praises I Will proclaim;
Before the Gods with Joy I Will sing,
And bless thy holy Name.
2. I Will worship toward thy sacred Seat;
And^ ravished with thy Love,
The Praises of thy Truth repeat,
Which thou do most approve.
3. Thou graciously inclin'd'st thine Ear,
When I to thee did cry;
And, when my Soul was pressed with Fear^
Did inward Strength supply.
4. Therefore shall every earthly Prince
Thy Name with Praise pursue,
Whom these admired Events convince
That all thy Works are true.
5. They, walking in his ways, the Lord
With cheerful Songs shall bless;
And all his glorious Acts record,
And his great Power confess.
6. For God, tho he is enthroned on high,
Does thence the Poor respect;
The proud far off, his scornful Eye
Beholds with just neglect.
7. Tho I Am with Troubles compassed round,
Yet he will me revive,
Thy Hand shall all my Foes confound,
And keep my Soul alive.
8. The Lord, whose mercies ever last,
Shall fix my happy state;
And mindful of his favors past,
Shall his own work complete.
PSALM CXXXIX.
1, 2. THou, Lord, by strictest search have known
My rising up and lying down;
My secret Thoughts are known to Thee,
Known long before conceived by me.
3. Thine Eye my Bed and Path surveys,
My public Haunts and private Ways;
4. Thou know what it is my Lips would vent,
My yet un^utter'd Words intent.
5. B^set by Thee, before, behind,
On every side thy Hand I sind.
6. O Skill, for human reach too high!
Too dazzling bright for mortal Eye!
7. O could I so per^idious be
To think of once deserting Thee,
Where, Lord, could I thy Influence shun,
Or whither from thy presence run?
8. If up to Heaven I take my flight^
It Is there Thou dwell'st e^thron'd in Light:
Or dive to Hell's infernal Plains,
It Is there Almighty Vengeance reigns.
9. If I the Morning's Wings could gain,
And fly beyond the Western Main,
10. Thy nimbler Hand would first arrive
And there arrest thy Fugitive.
11. Or should I sculk to shun thy sight
Beneath the sable Wings of Night;
One glance from Thee, one piercing Ray
Would kindle Darkness into Day.
12. The Veil of Night is no Disguise,
No Umbrage to all-seeing Eyes;
Through midnight Shades thou find'st thy way,
As in the blazing Noon of Day.
Thou know the Lab'rinths of my Hear^,
13. My Reins and every vital part;
Thou cloath'dst 'em early, or the Womb,
Where Life they took, had proved their Tomb,
14. I Will praise Thee from whose Hands I came,
A work of such stupendous Frame!
That Wonders Thou in me have shown
To my admiring Soul is known.
15. Thine Eyes my Substance did survey
While yet a lifeless Mass it lay,
How curiously in secret wrought
Ever on the World's great Stage 'twas brought.
16. Thou did the shapeless Embryo see,
Its Parts were registered by Thee;
Thou saw the daily growth they took,
Formed by the Model of thy Book.
17. Let me acknowledge too, O God,
That since this Maze of Life I trod,
Thy thoughts of Love to me surmount
The Power of Numbers t^ recount^
18. For sooner could I reckon over
The Sands upon the Ocean's shore:
Each Morn revising what I Have done,
I find The Account but new begun.
19. The wicked shall thou slay, O God:
Depart from me, ye Men of Blood,
20. Whose Tongues Heavens Majesty profane,
And take the Almighty Name in vain.
21. Lord, hate I not their impious Crew
Who Thee with Enmity pursue?
And does not Grief my Heart oppress,
When Reprobates thy Laws transgress?
22. Who practice Enmity to Thee
Shall utmost Hatred have from me,
Such Men I utterly detest
As if they were my Foes professed.
23, 24. Search, try, O God, my Thoughts and Heart
If Mischief lurks in any part;
Correct me where I go astray,
And guide me in thy perfect way.
PSALM CXL.
1. PReserve me, Lord, from cruel Foes
Of villainous intent,
2. Whose Hearts on mischievous Designs
With restless Spite are bent.
3. Their sharpened Tongue the Serpent's sting
In Virulence exceeds;
Be^ween their Lips the Gaul of Asps
And Adders Venom breeds.
4. Preserve me, Lord, from wicked Hands
Nor leave my Soul forlorn;
A Prey to Sons of Violence
Who have my Ruin sworn.
5. The proud for me have laid their Snare,
And spread their wily Net,
With Traps and Gins where ever I move,
I find my Steps beset.
6. But thus environed with Distress
Thou art my God, I said,
Lord hear my supplicating Voice
That calls to Thee for aid.
7. O Lord, the God whose saving Strength
Kind Succor did convey,
And covered my adventurous Head,
In Battle's doubtful Day:
8. Permit not their unjust Designs,
But disappoint their Rage;
Lest prosperous Wickedness their Pride
In bolder Crimes engage.
9. Let first their Chiefs the sad effects
Of their Injustice mourn;
The blast of their envenomed Breath
Upon themselves return.
10. Let them who kindled first the Flame
Its Victims first become;
The Pit they dig'd for me be made
Their everlasting Tomb.
11. Though Slander's Breath may raise a Storm
It quickly will decay;
Their Rage does but the Torrent swell
That bears themselves away.
12. God will assert the poor Man's Cause,
Relief to the injured give:
The just shall celebrate his Praise
And in his Presence live.
PSALM CXLI.
1. TO thee, O Lord, my Cries ascend,
O ha^t to my relief:
And with accustomed Pity hear
The Accents of my Grief
2. Without Oblations let my Pray'^
Like Morning Incense rise;
My innocent up-lifted Hands
Like Evening Sacrifice.
3. From rash Efforts restrain my Tongue
With constant watch and ward,
And keep the Portal of my Lips
With wary silence barred.
4. From wicked Deeds and wicked Men
My Heart and Hands restrain;
Nor let me in the Booty share
Of their unrighteous Gain.
5. Let righteous Men reprove my Faults
And I shall think 'em kind,
Like Balm that heals a wounded Head
I their Reproof shall ^ind;
And, in return, my fervent Prayer
On their behalf address,
When they are tempted and reduced
Like me to sore Distress.
6. When sculking in Eng^ddi's Rock
(I to themselves appeal)
If one reproachful Word I spoke,
When in my power to kill.
7. Yet us they persecute to Death,
Our scattered Ruins lie
As thick as from the Hewer's A^
The severed Splinters fly.
8. But, Lord, to Thee I still direct
My supplicating Eyes,
O leave not destitute my Soul,
Whose Trust on Thee relies.
9. Preserve me from the Snares and Gin^
That wicked Hands have laid;
Let them in their own Nets be caught,
While my Escape is made.
PSALM CXLII.
1. TO God with mournful Voice
In deep distress I prayed;
2. Made him the Umpire of my Cause,
My Wrongs before him laid.
3. Thou knew'st my way to 'scape
When my grieved ^oul despaired;
For where I thought to walk secure,
They had their Gins prepared.
4. I looked, but found no Friend
To own me in Distress;
All Refuge failed, no Man vouchsafed
His Pity or Redress.
5. To God at last I prayed,
Thou, Lord, my Refuge art,
My Portion in the Land of Life,
Till Life it self depart.
6. Lord, hear my Cry, redn^'d
To last extremity!
Save me from Persecutors Rage
Too powerful grown for me.
That I may praise thy Name,
7. My Soul from Prison bring;
Whilst of thy bounteous Care to me
Assembled Saints shall sing.
PSALM CXLIII.
1. LORD, hear my Prayer, and to my Cry
Thy wonted Audience lend;
In thy accustomed Faith and Truth
A gracious Answer send.
2. Nor at thy strict Tribunal bring
Thy Servant to be tried;
For in thy sight no living Man
Can ever be justi^i'd.
3. The Foe pursues my Life, a Life
Whose Com^orts all are f^ed;
To Darkness chased and fo^c'd to seek
A Mansion with the Dead.
4. My Spirit therefore is o'er-whelm'd,
And sinks within my Breast;
My Vitals fail^ my Heart it self
That should support the rest.
5. I call to mind the Days of old;
The Wonders thou have wrought
For my Deliverance heretofore
Employ my musing Thought.
6. To Thee my supplicating Hands
Are eagerly stretched out;
My Soul for thy Refreshment thirsts
Like Land oppressed with Drought.
7. Hear me with speed; my Spirit fails,
Thy Face no longer hide,
Lest I become forlorn like them
That in the Grave reside.
8. Thy Kindness early let me hear,
Whose Trust on Thee depends;
Teach me the way where I should go:
My Soul to Thee ascends
9. Thou art my God, Thy righteous Will
Instruct me to obey:
Let thy good Spirit conduct and keep
My Soul in thy right way.
10. For thy Name's sake with quick'ni^g Grace,
From Mercy's healing Spring
Revive me, and for thy Truth's sake
My Soul from Trouble bring.
11. In pity to my Sufferings, Lord,
Reduce my Foes to Shame;
Stay them that persecute a Soul
Devoted to thy Name.
PSALM CXLIV.
1. FOrever blessed be God the Lord,
Who does his needful Aid impart,
At once both Strength and Skill afford
To wield my Arms with warlike Art.
2. His Goodness is my Fort and Power,
My strong Deliverer and Shield;
In him I trust whose matchless Tower
Makes to my sway fierce Nations yield.
3. Lord, what is in Man that Thee should move
Such tender Care of him to take?
Or what is Man's Son that thou should love
Such great account of him to make?
4. The Life of Man does quickly fade,
His Thoughts but empty are and vain;
His Days are like a flying Shade,
Of which, when past, no Signs remain.
5. In solemn state, O God, descend,
Whilst Heaven its lofty Head inclines;
The smoking Hills asunder rend,
Of thy approach the awful Signs.
6. Discharge thy dreadful Lightnings round,
And make my scattered Foes retreat;
Them with thy martial Arrows wound,
And their Destruction soon complete.
7, 8. Do thou, from Heaven above engage
Thy boundless Power my Foes to quell;
And snatch me from the stormy Rage
Of threatening Waves that proudly swell.
Fight thou against my foreign Foes
Whose Mouth vent Speeches false and vain,
Who, tho in solemn Leagues they close,
That firm Engagement never maintain.
9. So I to Thee, the King of Kings,
In joyful Hymns my Voice shall raise
And Instruments of various Strings
Shall help me thus to sing thy Praise:
10. God does to Kings his Aid afford,
To them his sure Salvation sends
It Is he that from the hurtful Sword
His Servant David still defends.
11. Fight thou against my foreign Foes,
Whose Mouths vent Speeches false and vain,
Who, tho in solemn Leagues they close,
Their firm Engagement never maintain.
12. Then our young Sons like Trees shall grow
Well planted in some fruitful place;
Our Daughters shall like Pillars show,
Designed some Royal Court to grace.
13. Our Garners, filled with various Store,
Shall us and ours with Plenty feed,
Our Sheep, inc^easing more and more,
Shall thousands and ten thousands breed.
14. Our laboring Oxen strong may grow,
Nor in their constant Labor faint,
Whilst we no War nor Slavery know,
And in our Streets hear no Complaint.
15. Thrice happy is that People's Case,
Whose various Blessings thus abound,
Who God's true Worship s^ill embrace,
With his Protection always crowned.
PSALM CXLV.
1, 2. THEE I Will extol, my God and King,
Thy endless Praise proclaim;
This Tribute daily I will bring
And ever bless thy Name.
3. Thou, Lord, beyond compare art great,
And highly to be praised;
Thy Majesty, with boundless Height,
Above our Knowledge raised.
4. Renowned for mighty Acts, thy Fame
To future Times extends;
From Age to Age thy glorious Name
Successively descends.
5, 6. Whilst I thy Glory and Renown,
And wondrous Works express;
The World with me thy Might shall own,
And thy great Power confess.
7. The Praise that to thy Love belongs
They shall with Joy proclaim;
Thy Truth of all their grateful Songs
Shall be the constant Theme.
8. The Lord abounds with Acts of Grace,
Which Pity still supplies;
His Anger moves with leisure pace:
His willing Mercy flies.
9, 10. Thou, Lord art good to all; thy Love
To all thy Works expressed;
By them still praised thy Name shall prove,
And by thy Servants blessed.
11. They, with the glorious Prospect sir'd,
Shall of thy Kingdom speak;
And thy great Power, by all admired,
Their lofty Subject make.
12. God's glorious Works of ancient date
Shall thus to all be known;
And thus his Kingdom's Royal State,
With public Splendour shown.
13. His steadfast Throne, from Changes free,
Shall stand for ever fast;
His boundless Sway no end shall see,
But Time it self out-last.
PART II.
14, 15. The Lord does them support that fall,
And makes the prostrate rise;
For his kind Aid all Creatures call,
Who timely Food supplies.
16. What ever their frequent Wants require
With open hand he gives;
And so fulfils the just Desire^
Of every thing that lives.
17, 18. How holy is the Lord, how just!
How righteous all his Ways!
How nigh to him, who with firm Trust,
For his Assistance prays.
19. He Will grant the full Desires of those
Who him with Fear adore;
And all their Troubles soon compose
When they his Aid implore.
20. The Lord preserves all those with Care
Whom grateful Love employs;
But Sinners who his Vengeance dare,
With furious Rage destroys.
21. My Time to come in Praises spent,
Shall celebrate his Fame:
And all Mankind with one Consent
Shall ever bless his Name^
PSALM CXLVI.
1, 2. O Praise the Lord, and thou, my Soul,
For ever bless his Name:
His wondrous Love, while Life shall last^
My constant Praise does claim.
3. On Kings, the greatest Sons of Men,
For Succor never rely;
They cannot defend in dangerous times,
Nor timely Help apply.
4. Formed out of Dust, their Breath once gone
Again in Dust they lie;
And all their Thoughts and vain Designs
Together with them die.
5. Then happy he, who Jacob's God
For his Protector takes;
Who still, with well-plac'd Hope, the Lord
His constant Refuge makes.
6. The Lord, who made both Heaven and Earth
And all that both contain,
Will never quit his steadfast Truth,
Nor make his promise vain.
7. The poor oppressed, from all their Wrongs,
Are eased by his Decree;
He gives the Hungry needful Food,
And sets the Prisoners free.
8. By him the Blind receive their Sight,
The weak and fallen he rears:
With kind Regard, and tender Love
He for the righteous cares.
9. The Strangers he preserves from Harm,
The Widow kindly treats,
He guards the Orphan, and the Wiles
Of wicked men defeats.
10. The God that does in Sion dwell,
Is our eternal King:
From Age to Age his Reign endures.
Let all his Praises sing.
PSALM CXLVII.
1. O Praise the Lord with Hymns of Joy,
And celebrate his Fame;
For pleasant, good, and comely it is
To praise his Holy Name.
2. His holy City God will build,
Tho levelled with the Ground;
And bring his People back, dispersed
Over all the Nations round.
3, 4. He kindly heals the broken Hearts,
And all their Wounds does close;
He tells the Number of the Stars
Their several Names he knows.
5, 6. Great is the Lord, and great his Power;
His Wisdom knows no Bound.
The meek he raises and throws down
The Wicked to the Ground.
7. To God, the Lord, a Hymn of Praise
With grateful Voices sing;
To Songs of Triumph tune the Harp,
And strike each warbling string.
8. He covers Heaven with Clouds, and thence
Refreshing Rain bestows,
Through him, on Mountain-tops, the Grass
With wondrous Plenty grows.
9. He, salvage Beasts, that loosely range
With timely Food supplies.
He feeds the Raven's tender Brood,
And stops their hungry Cries.
10. He values not the warlike Steed,
Nor in his Strength delights;
The nimble Foot, that swiftly runs,
With just Disdain he slights.
11. But he, to him that fears his Name,
His tender Love extends;
To him that on his boundless Grace
With steadfast Hope depends.
12, 13. Let Sion and Ierus'lem then,
To God their Praise address;
Who fenced their Gates with massy Bars,
And does their Children bless.
14, 15. He makes in all their Borders Peace,
With finest Wheat they are fed,
He speaks the Word, and what he wills
Is done as soon as said.
16. Large Flakes of Snow, like fleecy Wool,
Descend at his Command;
And Hoary Frost, like Ashes spread,
Is scattered over the Land.
17. When he does, joined to these, his Ice
In little Morsels break,
Who can against his piercing Cold
Secure Defenses make?
18. He sends his Word, and strait it melts;
He makes his Wind to blow,
And soon the Streams, congealed before
In plenteous Currents flow.
19. By Him his Statutes and Decrees
To Jacob's Sons were shown;
And still to Isr'el's chosen Seed
His righteous Laws are known.
20. No other Nation this can boast,
Nor did he ever afford
To heathen Lands his Oracles,
And Knowledge of his Word.
Hallelujah^
PSALM CXLVIII.
1. YE boundless Realms of Joy
Exalt your Maker's Fame;
His Praise your Song employ
Above the starry Frame:
2. Your Voices raise,
Ye Cherubims
And Seraphims
To sing his Praise.
3, 4. Thou Moon, that rul'st the Night,
And Sun that guid'st the Day,
Ye glittering Stars of Light
To him your Homage pay:
His Praise declare
Ye Heavens above
And Clouds that move
In liquid Air.
5, 6. Let them adore the Lord,
And praise his holy Name,
By whose Almighty Word
They all from Nothing came.
And so shall last,
From Changes free,
His firm Decree
Stands ever fast.
7, 8. Let Earth her Tribute pay;
Praise him, ye dreadful Whales,
And Fish that through the Sea
Glide swift with glittering Scales.
Fire, Hail, and Snow,
And misty Air,
And Winds that, where
He bids them, blow.
9, 10. By Hills and Mountains (all
In grateful Consort joined)
By Cedars stately tall,
And Trees for Fruit designed.
By every Beast,
And creeping thing,
And Fowl of Wing,
His Name be blessed.
11, 12. Let all of Royal Birth,
With those of humbler Frame,
And Judges of the Earth,
His matchless Praise proclaim.
In this Design
Let Youths with Maids,
And hoary Heads
With Children join.
13. United Zeal be shown,
His wondrous Fame to raise,
Whose glorious Name alone
Deserves our endless Praise.
Earth's utmost Ends
His Power obey:
His glorious Sway
The Skies transcends.
14. His chosen Saints to grace
He sets their Horn on high,
And favors Isr'el's Race
Who still to him are nigh.
O therefore raise
Your grateful Voice
And still rejoice
The Lord to praise.
PSALM CXLIX.
1, 2. O Praise ye the Lord,
prepare your glad Voice
His Praise in the great
Assembly to sing.
In our great Creator
let Israel rejoice,
And Children of Sion
be glad in their King.
3, 4. Let them his great Name
extol in the Dance;
With Timbrel and Harp
his Praises express,
Who always takes pleasure
his Saints to advance,
And with his Salvation
the Humble to bless.
5, 6. With Glory adorned
his People shall sing
To God, who their Beds
With Safety does shield;
Their Mouth filled with Praises
of him their great King;
Whilst a two-edged Sword
in their Hand they shall wield,
7, 8. Just Vengeance to take
for Injuries past;
To punish those Lands
that know not his Mind;
With Chains, as their Captives,
to tie their Kings fast,
With Fetters of Iron
their Nobles to bind.
9. Thus shall they make good,
when them they destroy,
The dreadful Decree
which God does proclaim:
Such Honor and Triumph
his Saints shall enjoy.
O therefore for ever
exalt his great Name.
PSALM CL.
1. O Praise the Lord in that blessed Place,
From whence his Goodness largely flows,
Praise him in Heaven where he his Face
Unveiled in perfect Glory shows.
2. Praise him for all the mighty Acts
Which he in our behalf has done;
His Kindness this Return exacts,
With which our Praise should equal run.
3. Let the Shrill Trumpet's warlike Voice
Make Rocks and Hills his Praise rebound;
Praise him with Harp's melodious Noise,
And gentle Psaltry's silver Sound.
4. Let Virgin-Troops soft Timbrels bring,
And some with graceful Motion dance;
Let Instruments of various Strings,
With Organs joined, his Praise advance^
5. Let them who joyful Hymns compose
To Cymbals set their Songs of Praise;
Cymbals of common Use, and those
That loudly sound on solemn Days.
6. Let all things with glad Zeal contend
The Breath he does to them afford
In just Returns of Praise to spend;
Let every ^reature praise the Lord.

Advertisement.
HAving designed to make such a Version of the Psalms as may be fit for Common
Use we have endeavored it by the following Methods, 1. By keeping strictly to
the Text, and where the Sense was doubtful, determining it by the Scope and
Occasion of the Psalm. 2. By taking care to make the whole Version easy and
intelligible. 3. By endeavoring to express the Spirit and Genius of every
Psalm, and suiting our Style to the several Passions of the Author. 4. By
retaining ^he Connection throughout each Psalm, which does not always appear in
the Prose Translation. 5. By rendering the Hebraisms in their plain Sense and
Meaning, as agreed on by the best Commentators. 6. By adapting our Measures to
the Tunes that are best received, turning several Psalms to those that are most
Musical, such as that of 100, 113, 148, and others.
