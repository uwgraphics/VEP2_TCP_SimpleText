THE FOUR-LEGG'D ELDER,
OR, A true RELATION OF A DOG and an ELDER'S Maid.
To the Tune of The Lady's Fall, or Gather your Rose-buds; and Forty other
Tunes.
1.
ALl Christians and Lay Elders too,
For shame amend your Lives;
I Will tell you of a Dog-trick now,
Which much concerns your Wives.
An Elder's Maid near Temple Bar,
(O what a Queen was she!)
Did take an ugly Mastive Cur
Where Christians use to be.
Help House of Commons, House of Peers!
O now or never help!
The Assembly having sat four years
Has now brought forth a Whelp.
2.
One evening late she stepped aside,
Pretending to fetch Eggs;
And there she made her self a Bride
To one that had four legs.
Her Master heard a Rumblement,
And wondered she did tarry,
Not dreaming, without his consent,
His Dog would ever marry.
3.
Her Master peeped, but was afraid,
And hastily did run
To fetch a staff, to help his Maid,
Not knowing what was done.
He took his Ruling-Elder's Cane,
And cried out, Help, help here!
For Swash our Mastiff and poor Jane
Are now Fight Dog fight Bear.
4.
But when he came, he was full sorry,
For he perceived their strife,
That, according to the Directory,
They two were Dog and Wife.
Ah then, said he, thou cruel Queen,
Why have thou me beguiled?
I wondered Swash was grown so lean;
Poor Dog! he is almost spoiled.
5.
I thought thou had no carnal sense
But what is in other Lasses,
And could have quenched thy 'cupiscence
According to the Classes.
But all the Parish sees it plain
Since thou art in this pickle,
Thou art an Independent Queen,
And love a Conventicle.
6.
Alas! now each Malignant Rogue
Will all the world persuade
That she that is Spouse unto a Dog
May be an Elder's Maid:
They Will jeer us if abroad we stir,
Good Master Elder, stay,
Sir, of what Classis is your Cur?
And then what can we say?
7.
They Will many graceless Ballads sing
Of a Presbyterian,
That a Lay-Elder is a thing
Made up half-Dog, half-Man.
Out, out, said he, and smote her down;
Was Mankind grown so scant?
There Is scarce another Dog in the Town
Had took the Covenant.
8.
Then Swash began to look full grim,
And Jane did thus reply,
Sir, you thought naught too good for him.
You fed your Dog too high:
It Is true, he took me in the lurch
And leaped into mine Arm,
But as I hope to go to Church,
I did your Dog no harm.
9.
Then she was led to Newgate Jail,
Where she was naked stripped;
They whipped her 'till the Cord did fail,
As Dogs used to be whipped.
Poor City-Maids shed many a tear
When she was lashed and banged:
But had she been a Cavalier
Surely she had been hanged.
10.
Here Is was but Fornication found,
For which she felt the lash;
But his was Buggery presumed,
Therefore they hanged Swash.
What will become of Bishops then
Or Independency?
For now we find both Dogs and Men
Stand for Presbytery.
11.
She might have took a Sow-gelder,
With Synod-men good store;
But she would have a Lay-Elder
With two legs and two more.
Go tell the Assembly of Divines,
Tell Adoniram blue,
Tell Burgess, Marshal, Case, and Vines;
Tell Now-and-anon-too.
12.
Some say she was a Scottish Girl,
Or else, at least a Witch;
But she was born in Colchester:
Was ever such a Bitch!
Take heed, all Christian Virgins now,
The Dog Star now prevails;
Ladies, beware your Monkies too,
For Monkies have long tails.
13.
Bless King and Queen, and send us Peace
As we had seven years since:
For we remember no Dog Days
While we enjoyed our Prince.
Bless sweet Prince Charles, two Dukes, three Girls;
Lord save his Majesty!
Grant that his Commons, Bishops, Earls,
May lead such lives as He.
Help House of Commons, House of Peers!
O now or never help!
The Assembly having sat four years
Has now brought forth a whelp.
