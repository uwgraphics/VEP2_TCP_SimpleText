The BEGGARS Delight, As it was SUNG at the Theater Royal.
^

COurtiers, Courtiers, think it no harm,
that silly poor Swains in Love should be;
For Love lies hid in Rags all torn,
as well as in Silks and Bravery:
For the Beggar he loves his Lass as dear,
as he that has thousands thousands, thousands,
He that has thousand pounds a year.
II.
State and Title are pitiful things,
a lower State more happy does prove,
Lords and Ladies, Princes and Kings,
with the Beggar has equal joys in Love;
And my pretty brown Cloris upon the Hay,
has always as killing, killing, killing,
Has always as killing Charms as they.
III.
A Lord will purchase a Maidenhead,
which perhaps, has been lost some years before,
A Beggar will pawn his Cloak and his Trade,
content with Love, to lie and live poor:
Our eager Embraces in Coal-Sheds,
are always more pleasing, pleasing, pleasing,
Then theirs that are dull in Downy*
IV.
Our Cloris is free from Patches and Paint,
complexion and Features sweetly agree,
Perfections which Ladies often do want,
is always entailed on our Pedigree:
Sweet Cloris in her own careless Hair,
is always more taking, taking, taking,
Then Ladies that Towers and Pendents do wear.
V.
A Duchess may fail, created for sport,
by using of Art, and changing of things,
Though she were the Idol and Goddess of th Court,
the joys and the pleasure of Don, Prince, or Kings:
Yet Cloris in her Old Russet Gown,
she is sound, she is sound, she is sound,
And free from the Plague and Pox of the Town.
FINIS.
