The picture of the unfortunate gentleman, Sir Geruis Eluies Knight. late
leiftenant of his Majesty's Tower of London.


Behold him aright whose office and estate,
Unwisely managed, made him unfortunate:
And whose flattring hopes of popular grace,
Robbed him of life, favors dignity, and place.
Yet let the worst of him thus much conceait,
A foe to him self, in striving to be great:
Worshipful by birth, deborare and kind,
Perfect in all, but the purpose of mind.
Thorough which, he vainly aiming over hye,
Deceaiued him self and won blame thereby:
For in thinking to better his degree,
Fortune betrayed him with false hopes we see.
The golden means was not his hearts content,
Nor country life, with quiet slumbers spent:
But watchful cares, and charges of estate,
The only aims his heart made level at.
So climing up to dignity and fame,
Forgot what dangers dwelt about the same:
But seated on the top of Fortunes mount,
He little thought so soon to give account,
Of his amiss: and deeds of secret sin;
Of which by law he was found guillty in.
And being cast, as Justice had ordained,
His soul for heavenly mercy still complained:
And so with true repentance leaving earth,
Took patiently his just deserved death.
Rest then in peace on Sions holy hill,
Persuasions trayn'd thee unto this cursed ill:
Which if to it thou never had given consent,
Thy days had been in gracious manner spent.
Printed at London in the Blackfriars, by Paul Boulenger. 1615.
