Dr Sandersons Paper and Censure.
UPon persual of Mr Ascham's Book you left with me, I find not my selfin my
understanding thereby convinced of the Necessity or Lawfulness of Conforming
unto, or Complying with an unjust prevailing Power, further than I was before
persuaded, it might be Lawful or Necessary so to do: viz. As paying Taxes, and
Submitting to some other things (in themselves not unlawful) by them imposed
or required; such as I had a Lawful Liberty to have done in the same manner,
though they had not been so Commanded, and seem to me in the Conjuncture of
present Circumstances, prudentially necessary to preserve my self or my
Neighbor from the Injuries of Those that would be willing to make use of my
Non-submission, to Mine or His ruin; so as it be done with these Cautions:

1. Without Violation either of Duty to God, or any other just Obligation, that
lie's upon me by Oath, Law, or otherwise.

2. Only in the case of Necessity otherwise not to be avoided.

3. Without any explicit or implicit Acknowledgment of the Justice and
Legality of their Power: I may submit to the (...) (to the Force) but not
acknowledge the (...), (the Authority) or by any Voluntary Act give strength,
assistanc, or countenance thereunto.

4. Without any prejudice unto the claim of the Oppressed Party that has a
right, Title; or casting my self into an Incapacity of lending him my due and
bounden Assistance, if, in time to com, it may be useful to him toward the
Recovery of his Right.

5. Where I may reasonably, and Bona Fide presume, the Oppressed Power, (to
whom my Obedience is justly due) if he perfectly knew the present Condition I
am in, together with the Exigence and Necessity of the present Case, and all of
Circumstances thereof, would give his willing Consent to such my Conformity and
Compliance.

So that, upon the whole matter and in short, I conceive I may so far submit
unto the Impositions, or comply with the Persons of a prevailing usurped Power,
unjustly commanding things not in themselves unlawful; or make use of their
Power to protect one from others Injuries, As I may submit unto, comply with,
or make use of an Highway Thief, or Robber, when I am fallen into his hands,
and lie at his Mercy.

As for Mr Ascham's Discourse, though it be handsomely framed, yet all the
Strength of it to my seeming (if he would speak out) would be in plain English
these:

1. That self-preservation is the first and chiefest Obligation in the World,
to which all other Bonds and Relations (at least between Man and Man) must give
place.

2. That no Oath, at least no imposed Oath, at what Terms soever expressed,
binde's the Taker further than he intended to bind himself thereby; and, it
is presumed, that no man intended to bind himself to the prejudice of his own
safety.

Two dangerous and desperate Principles, which evidently tend 1. to the taking
away of all Christian Fortitude and Suffering in a Righteous Cause: 2. to the
Encouraging of daring and ambitious Spirits to attempt continual Innovations,
with this Confidence, that if they can by any ways (how unjust soever)
possess themselves of the Supreme Power, they ought to be submitted unto: 3.
to the Obstructing unto the Oppressed Party all possible ways and means,
without a Miracle, of ever recovering that just Right, of which he shall have
been unjustly dispossessed: And (to omit further instancing) 4. to the bringing
in of Atheism, with the Contempt of God and all Religion, whilst every man, by
making his own Preservation the Measure of all his Duties and Actions, makes
himself thereby his own Idol.

The Reply.
I Am sorry so strict a Censurer could find any words to commend (as he
says) the handsome frame of a book, whose Deductions he does not like: And I
had rather have accompanied so great a Judge to the trial of its Basis and
Principles, then he left by him thus suddenly groping in the Dark, when every
devious step has a Precipice, yet hear the way (as laid out in that Book)
affirmed to be both generally good, and generally bad. If he had ruined its
foundations, or disabled it in any one nominated Chapter or Section, we might
with greater confidence avoid it, as a fabrike ready to fall by its own nodd.

But what he has not effected by the way of Censure, the Author of the
Exercitation Of the exercitat on concerning usurped Powers.
concerning usurped Powers has done as little by the way of Answer. I should
not have mentioned him at all (the maine of whose book relates to several
other Authors of a different Historical seen) did not I find him (as I shall
here show) contradictory both to friend and foe, to himself, to the Principles
of the Parliaments first engagement, to this Dr. to Boxhornius, and to the
learned Grotius. Besides he pretends only to answer two Chapters of our
Author, not taking Notice of the last Additionall Chapters. But by the rules of
all Logic it is no way of answering an Argument, but a kind of denying a
Conclusion, if the Respondent only turn aside to prove a Proposition contrary
to the deductions of the first Position asserted. For by that means he answers
nothing of another, but only proves something of his own, and so le^ves the
Comparison of reasons still a question; which (not to scandalize the Gentleman)
is the only subject and Method of that second Chapter which he bestows so
Magisterially, and to so little purpose on our Author.

The State of the Controversy.
Whether in order to public Obedience in Civil government, the Consideration
of the things commanded (as they are not in themselves bad) be above the
Circumstantiall qualification of the Persons Commanding? As to do the Offices
of a Judge or Justice of Peace by Uirtue of Commission derived from any
Governor what ever.

BY Civil Government our Author means a Public and Ministerial Power,
ordeind sometimes and in some Places extraordinarily by God, but ordinarily now
by man in his public Necessities, to the end that nations may be conserved
from Confusions and Private injuries in meo and ^uo, and that they may in all
forms act securely according to their Natures, Religion and Necessities.

The Author of the Exercitation says, p. 10. 12. Government must be delivered
by Custom or Law, But I would he could inform Vide Bacons Hist. H. 7. p. 144
us by what Positive Law Nimrod and others in Heroical seizures enterd into
Government at first, and whether our Henry the seventh, entering into the
Government when by Law he stood accused of Treason, could this way be owned, or
any from him to be Lawful Governors?

By Lawful, the Doctor here understands that which is Legal (which relates
but to private Justice and its Tribunals) so that by Lawful Commanders he
understands those only, who legally derive their Authority continuedly from
those who were originally authors of it: by which they who have Ius ad regnum
succeed uninterruptedly (as Boxhornius says) In locum ultimi, and injus primi;
which Principle (tho it has such great assertours) is of no security to
present Princes and Governors, making our Obligations in oaths of Allegiance
as uncertain, as the right so specified in them is, and may shake all the
Kingly Titles and Crowns in Christendom; as the Exercitation does sufficiently
by his not clearing himself, p. 2. Where he says, Princes are rightly
invested with sovereignty, 1. Immediately by God. 2. Mediatly by his committing
it to the people to Elect. 3. When God by a Reservation of his Power still
Exer. p. 2.
in terposeth to design the Person.

Tho this be well said, yet it is not enough. For first it provides not for
Peoples obeying a Capital family in Genarchaship, of which our Author treats
Chap. 11. part. 2.

Secondly, what shall we say to such Governors who were not originally
designed immediately by God, nor mediatly by such a free choice of the People as
he requires, and as was scarcely ever practiced since Nimrods entry?

Thirdly, seeing according to him God still reserves the prerogative of
designing Persons to Goverments, but that the public Revelation of his will
by Prophecy and Miracles is ceased, what then does that Author but allow men to
undertake to change Governors and Governments by virtue of Private spirit and
Revelation, which we are not able always to confute, no more then others are
able always to prove to us, and after this how will that Author be ever able
to prove a certain usurpation in his sense? To avoid these perplexities and
enquiries, our Authors, or rather St Austins Principle is safer both for
Princes and people, viz. That we obey those who plenarily possess us, and
force us not to the practice of things in themselves impious. They who
according to Hosea (...). 4. Set up Kings, but not by God, are accountable for
it; but does it follow that we of the People during that uncertainty might not
obey them?

The like inconsonancies has he to this purpose, p. 3. Where speaking
concerning the manner of the Peoples consent to make a true Title in a Prince;
he says it matters not whether it be antecedent or Consequent to Possession.

For first, if it be with the unjust dispossession of another (which he ought
Principally to have spoken to) then the Peoples subsequent consent cannot make
the intrusion Lawful to the intruder.

Secondly, what will he say to Boxhornius, who maintains the same Cause with
him, and argues that the Peoples consent, tacit or express, antecedent or
subsequent to another Possession, cannot take away the right which the Heirs
of a successive Prince have to Govern, tho their father might be justly
ejected? Because (says he) the Original Compact was in consideration of the
first blood, not of the particular persons governing. But by these loose
arguments they do but perplex one another, more then us: and for Boxhornius it
is sufficient that he makes the Hollanders his Countrymen rebels still, and
this King of Spain likewise but an Usurper, if he derive not every way a right
from the first blood in compact. Wherefore according to the Statute of Henry
the seventh, for obeying the King being, we suppose our governor to be
Lawful, and then proceed to make Laws and to conform to them.

Our Author understands that to be Lawful which is not so much Legal as
Equitable; because it is de jure publico, of which there is no mortal
Tribunal to Judge, or to receive the Pleas of such supreme dissenting Powers.
So that by Lawful commanders he understands p. 1.
those who in this state of confused families, and uncertainty of Traditionall
disguised and interested knowledge of rights may to us (if not to themselves)
be more equitably then Legally such, when they plenarily possess, Protect, and
Command us Lawful things.

By Lawful things our Author means things no way disconvenient with the
society of mankind, nor with the Principles of the Christian p. 3. (...) 1.
Religion, and therefore may lawfully be practizd by us of the People at all
times, and in all Countries. Such things as these are.

1. The payment of Duties and taxes for the present benefit of Protection.
Because a little time serves to ruin a man, especially in the Privation of all
Government. 2. A right to join with others to oppose that which might otherwise
confound the quiet of a whole Nation, and disorder Political legal and
Universal Justice. 3. To go to the present Tribunals for conserving
livelihood, meum and tuum and all legal Justice. 4. To act subordinatly in
Inferior offices and callings, so as may be for the good of our poor
Neighbors, which is but a passive Obedience, as all Obedience originally it,
being done only Ex Jussu Imperantis.
It is agreed by all, that in things unlawful, the Consideration of the
Persons (lawful or unlawful) weighs not at all; For in that Case we must obey
God the supremest Magistrate rather then man.

But when Lawful things are commanded, then three things are in Consideration.

1. Some say, that to legitimate our Obedience we must first assure our selves
of the Legality of the Persons Commanding; and then we may obey them in all
Lawful things, otherwise in nothing.

2. Our Author has asserted in several Chapters, That in this confused state
of the World, wherein Interest (which makes false Gods, and Counterfit Laws
for Heaven) makes and maintains many Princes by the like fictions (as they who
would be owned as the offspring of the Gods) and Princes themselves often not
permitting the trial of their Rights, require as much faith for Civil, as for
Religious Interests, He asserts (I say) that such an Original and Legal
assurance being a Moral impossibility, it is best and enough for our present
Obedience, to inform ourselves, Whether the kingdom be plenarily possessed by
those p. 1. c. 7, 8.
who in present exercise immediate command over it. And if so, then we may obey
them in the lawful things above specified. For he has showed that all
Governors are but Ministerial for the quiet practice of the rules of Right,
and that therefore, they enter not into the definition of Justice. Besides for
arguments sake he says, that a thing should be continued as Civilly Lawful,
it is not always necessary that it should enter, Sine dolo out vitiato
principio, provided it be not Irrational when it is entered, or unjust as a
custom: Every circumstantiall error makes not a false Church, nor every sin
an untrue believer. Neither does all Civil obligation or contract among People
begin by mutual Consent. But in Ui^e exerc^. p. 4.
the Cases De in rem verso, and negotiis gestis, when other men's businesses are
well done for them, it is sufficient if there be Rei con^rectatio, a voluntary
meddling in the business of another man; as in the redemption of other men's
Children from slavery, whom the Parent ought by the Law of Nature to Redeem;
also in the Guardienship of the Minor, which is always the state of a
Commonwealth, according to an old and true Axiom, Respuh: semper est in cura
and tutela: But the Law allows the Guardien to look after the Minors Rights at
his Charges, tho he know not of it, or knowing, would not (through
peevishness) have them so Looked after. From whence I coherently infer, That
the protection of this supreme State - guardien like a Meritum inferres
Allegiance as a Debitum, according to Solomon, Prove. 27. 18. He who keeps the
figtree shall eat the fruit thereof. Nay i^ he administer the same Political
Justice, and give the same Protection or Security, we are bound to do more
then obey him, viz. praise God for him.

All of us say, that it is sufficient in the Change of the sabbath, if that
which was Moral in it remain still: and in the Point of Mission of Ministers,
we say the Doctrinall Succession is sufficient, tho there were Change or
Interruption of the Personal since Christ's time: and what can hinder us from
saying the same concerning things Civilly Lawful (when there are civil
Changes of Persons or Goverments) but immediate Interest, Ambition or Revenge?
For this Reason Christ and his Apostles bad us not so much beware of Illegal
and false Princes, as of false Prophets; because at the day of Judgment we
shall all be examined concerning the things themselves done here in the flesh,
not under what Political Titles and forms.

3. The Censurer stands ballancing betwixt these two ways of Obedience, and
for want of that Christian fortitude which he speaks of, outwardly only
pretends to a station of Neutrality, although really he is most consonant with
our Author, nor any way opposite to his public Assertions, or to present
Obedience.

The Cases wherein the Censurer allows Obedience to a The Cases of Obedience.
supposed unjust Authority.

First, He directly says, he can pay taxes, and conform to other things
imposed by those who unlawfully and plenarily possess a Kingdom.

Here he leaves us in the dark, by not naming those other things, which may be
(for ought we know) all those other things asserted by our Author. Howsoever he
sufficiently acknowledges the present Authority, and so falls off from those of
the first opinion: But how he conceives he has liberty to pay taxes and other
duties without being commanded l understand not.

Secondly, he says, he can obey in things not unlawful in themselves; Which
is the utmost of what our Author asserts, especially in the Chapter of
Political Justice.

Thirdly, he can conform to what in the Conjuncture of present Circumstances
may seem prudentially necessary for his own, and his Neighbors preservation
from Injuries: He approves not of a Non-obedience, which might be made use of
to his own danger.

But for assuring his Obedience in these three General heads (which comprehend
the whole state of Subjection) he must have these five PROVISO'S, which I shall
examine, only to see how far they are opposite either to Reason, or to the Book
which he Censures.

Those three Cases of Obedience are allowable then only, when they Provis(...)
1.
violate no Duty to God, or Obligation of Oath or Law. The same is asserted
largely by our Author, showing how things in themselves just and necessary, are
not displeasing to God: as also how Promissory Oaths always have tacit
conditions innate to them, in regard of their uncertain futurition: That the
condition of Political Oaths, is to obey whom God permits plenarily to
possess Kingdoms, which is the sense in which Kings themselves understand
them. Though such Oaths may be violated by Princes, who at the expense of the
Peoples blood, dispute de jure ad regnum, yet that ended, the poor People in
submitting to changed Titles, violate no former Oaths. For the matter of such
Oaths Sanderson praelec. 7. sec. 7.
and Laws (as the Censurer himself has taught it) is consumed to them, and as
I may say, dies to them like fire, rather by extinction, than by corruption.
Otherwise all the World should be obliged to Moral impossibilities, which the
Censurers Book of Oaths will not allow. For that were to be ever restless among
our selves, till we brought God to our bent; as if we could force him to
continue such Persons and Governors only, as we approve of best our selves.

The second Proviso gives allowance only in Cases of extreme Necessity. 2.
Which our Author likewise asserts to be that alone which Originally makes,
interprets, and finally abrogates Laws and Goverments Ministerial to them, and
so becomes the Caesar of Caesar's.

The third is, When he may reasonably presume, that the Power to which his
Obedience is justly due, upon consideration of his present exigencies, 3.
would (if he knew them) dispense with his present Obedience to a prevailing
Power.

Our Author asserts thus much and more (Chap. 10. p. 2.) not here contradicted,
especially when the supposed Governor derives such an absolute clear right as
is here pretended. This Proviso for self-Preservation, runs to the end of all
the Circumstances of Subjection to a new Possessour; and may be (as he says)
as reasonably presumed from all right powers actually ejected, as it was
reasonably practiced by King Ferdinand antecedently to his ejection out of the
Kingdom of Naples, to prevent the desolation of his Subjects. This indeed was a
releasement by dispensation, because he then was in possession: But when
Princes do (as the Civil Law says) and as in the Government of the 24 years
which our Author Uide. p. 1. c. 1.
supposes, when Edward the fourth lived in Flanders, pati capitis diminutionem,
and are reduced to the station of private Persons, living in other Orbs,
subject to other Magistracies; then the Law looks at them as civily dead; so
that the releasment then is by extinction, as the same Law says, (...). Death
dissolves all things alike.

The Author of the Exercitation, p. 58. falls highly foul on the Dr. here, and
will not allow him this Proviso, saying, Such a presumptive releasment is
groundless, and highly impious, and is but his own act, and that cannot be a
discharge.

The Doctor and our Author here speak not of the extremities of one particular
man, but of a whole Nation, in which Case Posito sed non concesso that Princes
had such an inalienable right of Property in People, and that Government were
for the person governing primarily, yet the presumption were good, and would
discharge a man in foro interiori, though not in exteriori, where (for reasons
of state) summum jus is sometimes summa injuria. I wonder What express Letter
of the Law there was to Authorize our Saviors pulling Corn in another man's
field, or David's eating the shewbread, or Sampsons killing of himself? whom
Josephus excused, because when he saw he could live no longer but with a
reproach to God, he conceivd he might then anticipate his death. Vid. Grot. l.
2. c. 19.. 5. de Iu: bell: and Pacis.

The exercitation p. 60. says, The Oath of Allegiance prevents such a
Presumption, and obliges during life to do all that possibly may be done for
such an absent Prince. Our Author chap. 9. Proves that we are bound to do the
utmost of all our Moral not of all our Natural endeavor, and that not during
life, but during Possession, which is the scope of that Promissory Oath.
Otherwise what will he say to our late Kings Oath, with the now King of
Portugal, contrary to that which he took with the King of Spain as King of
Portugal? and what will he say to those Cases which our Author puts to him
chap. 9. concerning those who in frontire places fall sometimes into the
possession of one Prince and Allegiance, and sometimes into another quite
contrary? In opposition to our Author the Exercitation delivers a strange
Doctrine, affirming, That when such Enemies prevail they can pass no
Obligation upon men so reduced, as thereby to make them indebted to them for
their lives, because they were unjust enemies. According to this, there will be
no faith kept betwixt Enemies (who often presume one as much as another of the
justice of their Causes) neither were Prisoners, releast upon their Paroles,
bound to keep them, and that brave Roman releast at Carthage upon his faith to
return again from Rome, did not only a sottish, but an unjust act in keeping
it. But says he in opposition to our Author p. 60. a new life cannot be given,
and so consequently no new Obligation, and our Author cannot really prove his
life another then it was. R. When a man's life is given, it is civily, though
not naturally taken to be another: and if it be a contradiction to say a man
can in no consideration be said to have a new life, because it is naturally
still the same, then I am sure he contradicts the whole current of the Gospel,
which tells us how we may become New Creatures, and Saint Paul, Romans 7. did but
prevaricate, when he said, It was no longer he that did such things, because
the old man was dead in him; which is not to be understood as if the former
individual soul of Saint Paul were changed for another.

But that Author to maintain himself in these streights asserts this as his
Principle for all, p. 56. That peoples oaths are all absolute and irrespective,
and have no implications of if's or and's, etc. From whence (notwithstanding
his great sufferings for the Parliament) he must directly condemn their first
engagement against the King, and so he does plainly, saying, p. 13. That it is
unlawful to resist or fight against any just Magistrate, as he understands
just in Title, and yet p. 56. he calls KING CHARLES The late invasive Prince.
Secondly he thereby upbraids the Covenant, which provided for the preservation
of the King but conditionally, in the preservation of Religion and Law. But
indeed if we trace him we shall find that he knows not what to make of the
Covenant himself. For p. 4. where he speaks of the degrees of Usurpation, he
says distinctively that it may be either against the Oath of Allegiance, or
against Covenant which bounds it. He might trulier have said which derogates
from it, because that which the King was sworn to keep, we in it (contrary to
his oath and consent) swore to take away, viz. Episcopacy: Moreover p. 59. he
says the party sworn to in the Covenant, is not the King, but the people of
all ranks in the three Kingdoms, who therefore, (as he inferres) carry the
power of Obligation to, and releasment from it in themselves, which is a wild
extravagancy and Leads to attempt any madness, and to dissolve all Government,
and Allegiance, the People of private callings being sworn in relation and
subordination to their respective Judicatories, as himself (after all)
confesses with some contradiction in his America case. p. 5. That the houses
presorih'd the Covenant to the People: and if you would know, quo ju^^, he
says as impertinently in the same page, by Virtue of a Coordinate ^anck with
the King; For Coordinata f^se ^nvicem supplent, and have mutually a power to
act fully one for the other; As if the King legally could (in the making of
Laws and laying taxes) at sometime act, not only his own share, but that of
both houses also; and so consequently might both houses comprehend themselves
and the King, and consequently give an Oath of Allegiance in Covenant, which is
an unsound argument, because it satisfies not both ways alike, and has
contradictions of Government involved in it. Our Author chap. 9. p. 2. has
shown how impossible it is that any Promissory Oath can be absolute and
irrespective, and so has this Doctor (the Censurer) also praelecti. p. 7.. 7.
And the Exercitator at last with more contradiction confesses p. 61. That such
an Oath may be indeed suspended, but not dissolved: Whereas it is a known
Maxim, Obligationes non sunt inpendenti, the Obligations of See Mr A. p. 2. c.
3. sect. 2.
Promises cannot be suspended: quia annus and dies debentur, we owe time, which
may suspend the adimpletion of a Promise, but not its obligation. Otherwise we
must allow (though he would not) reservations for several allegiances for the
same people, for the same actions, and the same time, which is as
contradictory, as if we would have several Centers for the same equidistant
Lines in a Circle, and that in Holland they owe allegiance both to the States,
and to the King of Spain, and in Portugal to the King of Spain, and to the
new King.

The fourth Proviso of the Doctors is, when this may be without prejudicing the
oppressed party in his dues, and without disabling our selves to help him in
his recovery afterward.

This Notion is fitted only to distract people, by putting them in a way how
they should do nothing in present with faith, only that they might thereby act
any thing afterward with madness; Yea, though every thing both in Religion and
Nature be more favorable for Peace then for War. This is indeed a refind
Chimaera, as if People could in a State live half by themselves, by their own
Laws, and their own Militia, and so be taken into no plenary protection or
possession, by which they may be exposed in a Moment to certain ruin. For
non-obedience can expect nothing but non-protection; as King James in his
Apology objected to Pius Quinius when he absolved his Catholic Subjects from
their Allegiance, upon a pretense that he was an Heretical, and therefore an
unlawful King: To which the King replied, That what truth soever there might
be in this his unlawfulness, yet it was never asserted in the Church before,
That Temporal Obedience to any temporal power was against faith and salvation
of souls: a Doctrine which this Censurer does ill now to second a Pope in
against a Protestant King.

Nay, though it were true That one Prince or Power commands to the prejudice of
an other ejected, yet the peoples obedience, when necessary, is not unlawful,
but in submitting their Tutela is inculpata. For it is easy to understand how
we may have a right to receive what another may not have a right to give; as a
Necessary alms begd and received from one who got his riches by wrong and
oppression: as also in borrowing money upon biting Usury, when a man cannot by
Moral diligence get it other ways. As for the dues here mentioned, I shall
speak to them in the next. Proviso.

Here I must observe that the Author of the Exercitation has an express
Chapter against no other Author which I know of but the Doctor in this Chap. 32
his forth Proviso, highly blaming him for giving way to the temporizing
reservations of Allegiance during the intervall and prevalency of another
Power: at which Power some profess themselves so much scandalized, that they
cannot see how they may with a good Conscience ever go to Law in the present
Courts of Justice for their debts and rights. But for their ease this
Exercitation has found out an excellent expedient for them (tho not molded
from that equity whereby Saint Paul appealed to Caesar) which is, That they may
now recover their dues in those Courts, provided they give not such titles to
the Judges and Officers as they should give to the Lawful Magistrates. I
wonder whether this Gentleman thinks the like exception and scruple might not
have been made against their Courts during the Parliaments first War with the
King, when Judges and every thing else was regulated here, only by his name,
and absolutely against his Will. Such another expedient for the Kingdom of
Scotland would set all right in their justice too; For I believe the King of
Scotland hitherto has made no more Judges in Scotland then the Prince of Wales
has done in England. But the grand Case of Conscience p. 10. will tell this
Gentleman (how truly let him look to it) that his expedient salves not half the
difficulty; and that after he has received that which he judges in himself is
j^stly his own, by the might and power only of an unjust Court, yet he has not
his own: because a thing in itself just is not recovered by their help justly:
For Justice and Judgment is then only just, when it derives from the Just
Legal Magistrate, and Justice, as he says p. 26. looks upward, as well as
downward.

The like Note does he recommend to the Clergy, p. 24. advising them not to
preach on such unseasonable days as a wrong Magistrate shall appoint for some
Religious duty, yea, though the Parishioners were willing to hear the word of
God. Surely he cannot think but they will follow Saint Paul's authority, rather
then his, who enjones them to be instant both in season and out of season.

The fifth Proviso is, That this submission be only to the (...), not with an
acknowledgment of the (...) of the prevailing Power.

I know not to what purpose this Criticisme is inserted to weigh against the
consequence of such important Cases and Arguments, unless it be to indispose
people by perplexing them. Though the difference betwixt those two Greek words,
be no more then is betwixt Potentia and Potestas, or as is more Critically
betwixt power and Authority, yet our Author p. 2. chapter 11.. 9. proves that the
inequality of force, or Potency is the original ground of ruling, as well as
Impotency is of subjection. For which reason Master Hobbes his supposition,
That if there were two Omnipotents, neither could obey one the other, is very
conclusive.

But if I show that (...) Romans 13. 1. signifies no more then the establishment
of a supreme (...), when it comes at last to be (as Saint Paul says) (...),
and without further contests actually possesses all other Powers, and that
every Country has not a Prophet to give assurance of Gods extraordinary
revealed will, then I suppose this Proviso will signify noting.

That such is the meaning of (...), Romans 13. is evident. Because v. 1. the
Apostle speaks only of the Powers which de facto are, and that by this very
word (...). Moreover he interprets it clearlier. v. 3. (...), They who
actually rule are a terror to evil works: but how? the answer is in the same
verse, Because they carry or hold not the sword in vain; which can in no sense
be understand of those who have actually lost the sword; by which dispossession
they are disinabled to fright any body, being in the sense of the Law Civilly
dead themselves. Seeing then the change of Gods Vice Roys, or of the hands which
carry swords, is of his secret disposing, not by mere chance or humane
contrivance, it will concern us to submit to them (after an establishment) as
to an Authority or (...), and that for Conscience sake; lest by continual
disturbance (and without assurance for the success of more then our Moral
endeavors have attained to) we unnecessarily breed a public disturbance to
our own and others destructions.

But if by (...) he mean a clear right without interruption, derived ab
origin from some Capital family or Compact, he might put all the World into
an endless suffle, before he should find such Persons for all Kingdoms: And
Princes quietly possessed or (as Henry the Seventh would have it) established, are
but little beholden to him for this doctrine of Allegiance, as little as the
People are to him for his Divinity, who for want of that, which they cannot
get, are by him necessitated ever to do all just things doubtingly and without
faith. If he speak as a Casuit he cannot argue Prescription for the clear
right of one against the present Possession of another. For Prescription of it
self proves only a Comparative right, as one may be some what better then the
other, only because ancienter. Prescription is but a kind of Penalty in a
State, and therefore is allowed the Opinion and effects of Right, and in a
trial makes an Excellent exception against the claim of another; as when
Iept^a objected 300. years Possession to the Ammonites. The C. Law presumes
that what cannot appear to be another, is therefore the Possessours, and
because men have so much interest in the continual preservation of those
necessary rights which truly belong to them, therefore in the sense of that
Law, that thing cannot appear to be another, which has been for so many
years neglected by him: and for such negligence the Law judges him worthy to be
punished with the loss of what he pretends to. This perhaps is an inconvenience
to particular men, yet States allow it as an Equity to avoid a greater
inconveniency, viz. Public disquiets, perpetual controversies, and
uncertainty of Properties.

But how suddenly does all this, vanish when we argue de jure ad regna? For
trial of which there is no Tribunal, coercion, or Regula juris, save that one
and all of necessity. Neither can a Casuis^ plead time against truth; nor by
that Accident ever make wrong become right, or turn quantity into quality.

The Author of the Exercitation takes much pains disperstly to prove an (...)
on his new sense, but so, that if he had a King to day, he would go near to
cachier him to morrow, unless (after Possession) he would submit to the
Peoples consent for giving him a new Title (which Henry the seventh refused) or
for confirming an old Title. He says all lawful power is founded upon the
Wills of those over whom it is set, p. 4. I wish he had specified how he
understands this: For tho the Senate might give Caesar an Authority over the
town of Rome, yet from that Position a man might question what right he or
they could have to extend their Authority so far from Rome as this Country of
ours is, contrary to the wills of those millions which they governed: Moreover
St Paul wrote his 13 chapter to the Romans, with an exhortation to obey them there,
where they (the Roman Magistrates) never entered by the free Votes of the
People. They who according to Hosea 8. 4. do set up wrong Kings are only
answerable for it, but I doubt that the rule which he gives us, p. 62. Whereby
we may know when a Prince is given by God, is not in his own intent
sufficient. For if we want the reveiled will of God (as Miracles and public
Prophecy now are ceased) I believe the authority of Gamaliel (who for ought we
know had not the spirit of God) signifies very little in this Argument, viz.
That if it be of God it will l^st. For many things which are not of Gods
express ordination last long, and many things of Gods liking last but a
little, as Iebus power. From whence he inferres coherently, p. 63. that for
the present we must submissively bear those evils, yet three lines after he
contradicts all again, saying we are allowed to remove them when they are
befall(...); as if a man could at the same time both carry and throw down the
same bur^hen. In the midst of these rounds which he runs, I wonder what fixed
rules he would give for the reception of Ambassadors (when they must first
prove their Masters Titles) for the limits and duration of Empires, etc? The
Laws of Nations must and do determine these, and not the Municipall Laws of
any one Country; But p. 53. he professes he knows not what the Laws of
Nations or of War mean, if they derogate or vary from other humane Laws, as
they indeed do, War beginning there where other Law ends, and reciprocally,
and if he knows not this it is neither Mr Seldens not Grotius etc. faults, but
his own. For want of this he censures Grotius very impertinently for saying,
That if one Compeer unjustly invades the others rights, he may by the Law of
War lose the exercise of his own rights. This Gentleman p. 54. thinking to
mitigate the rigor of this, heightens it; For says he, it is not necessary
that his right should be lost, but that he make reparation, and according to
the justice of the Scripture he ought but to make a fourefold restitution of
damage. But I pray you what difference is there betwixt losing a right, and not
having that without which no satisfaction can be made, nor any readmission may
be obtained? Princes are still little beholding to him for these Arguments. For
after a War, and the desolation of Countries, how can an invading Prince
satisfy for the real damages which are so many? Or for the Personal
injuries or murders of so many, of which there can be no Compensation at all?

The assertion of our Authors ninth Chapter not being this, That mere violent
extrusion takes away a Sovereigns right, I have nothing to do to follow the
Arguments of the Exercitation Chap. 2. as if they were positive answers to our
Author; I shall only vindicate him in two places where the Exercitation would
fasten Contradictions on him.

Our Author says, that we are bound to own Princes so long Chapter 10. p. 2. sec.
3.
as it pleases God to give them the power to command us, and when we see others
possessed of their powers, we may then say, that the King of Kings has changed
our Viceroy; and yet speaking of Antichrists Dominion, he says, it can by no
Prescription become lawful, neither can a Christian submit himself to it
without wounding his faith; which says the Exercitation is a Contradiction.

I answer with King James, that we speak here only of Temporal Obedience in
Temporal things, and as the Pope is a Secular Prince he may have Allegiance
due to him, (upon which account several Protestant Princes have received his
Nuncios) although his spiritual Capacity may be denied him. Thus they who in
his Country may not go to his Churches, may safely obey him in his other Laws
and Courts, in which assertion there is no Contradiction.

Secondly, Our Author says, that the Obedience which the Israelites owed to
Nebuchadnezzar, ought not to be a general rule for subjection, which
contradicts the former Position, as the Exercitation conceives, but erroniously.

First, because they were given up as a prey to him.

Secondly, Because they were warned by Prophets so to obey, whereas we now of
this Age neither have them, nor Miracles to warrant us.

Hitherto I have showed you what consonancy there is betwixt the Censurers
Positions and Provisos with our Author.

But lest so much truth might unawares do some harm, and that interests might
not be changed with opinions, he lays the Book aside, and falls roughly on two
Assertions, which yet he says our Author has not spoke openly to.

The first concealed opinion of our Author, or rather the Doctors uppositions.
1.
own supposition is, That no Oath binds the taker further then he intended to
bind himself thereby, and it is presumed, that no man intended to bind himself
to the prejudice of his own safety.

Who can sufficiently wonder at the Doctors great error in this assertion?
Seeing the fourth Chapter in the second part of our Author is expressly and in
terminis writ to prove the quite contrary; showing that a Promissory Oath is to
be taken in the Principalls or Propounders sense; sine subticentia aut
amphibologia. Because a Promise is a Pact for transferring something to another,
as to a Principal, whose sense we are bound to follow, if our sense tells us
that such or such is his sense, and no further, unless we will our selves.

As for our Ministers former Subscriptions to Episcopacy, and their swearing
since to extirpate it in Covenant, our Author chapter 8. hopes Mr. Chittingworths
Vindication to be sufficient.

The second tacit supposition is, that self-preservation is the first and
chiefest obligation in the World.

Our Author affirms it to be the first, as in the State of Nature, p. 2. c.
11. but not the chiefest for many Civil and Religious Obligations which
derogate from that afterward, especially where the Question is directly of
Christ come in the flesh. Yet he affirms p. 2. c. 11. that most civil bonds
made betwixt man and man are but for better securing self-preservation: and
that men bound to venture their lives, are not therefore bound to lose them.
Because the Obligation is of all our Moral, not of all our Natural
endeavors: and upon this ground he says, chap. 8 p. 2. that Soldiers most
strictly sworn to a Prince, may in (...)rout take quarter: because to dye for
him, is to do nothing for him, but fruitlesly to cease to do any thing at all,
either for the glory of God, or for the good of our surviving Neighbor. Yea,
this very Doctor says, Praelec. 7. sect. 7. That Fathers may disinherit their
Children, and Children their Fathers, though they swore never to do so, viz. If
they seek to destroy one another; which according to him involves full
forfeiture of rights, even to Public Parents notwithstanding former Oaths of
Allegiance.

And as if the Doctor were nere resolved to say plainly by whom it is that
Princes cease to reign, he himself affirms in his Paper, that in the like
conjuncture of Circumstances he can likewise allow himself the same
Prudentialls to prevent Dangers which might otherwise happen to him by such
changes, and yet he will not openly allow so much to others.

Which as King James in his Apology says is a doctrine full of blood,
unnecessarily keeping poor people either from quarter or Protection, Kingdoms
from Peace, authorityes from settling; and in the search of uncertain rights
(which this Doctor makes necessary for just actions) he makes us feel
trepidation in our consciences, see Crowns tottering on Princes heads, find
Atheism in our actions, and desolation in our Country.

In sine, seeing no man knows better then he (who is so great a Master of
Reason) that if he had brought never so many more Incommoda, and those true
ones, yet he could not by that Logic have overthrown one Positive Argument
of our Author; I could therefore wish, that by answering that which was
published so long before any chang of government here, he had made his reasons
more public then his scandal. Unless (after so many Precepts of Christ and
his Apostles, the practical Obedience of them, and of all the rest of the
World ever since) he can show wherein our Authors assertion of Public
Obedience, is more chargeable with Novelty, or the contempt of God, then St
Austins which he wrote in the same terms, and in relation to the like changes
and confusions, viz. Quid interest sub cujus imperio vivat homo moriturus, si
illi qui imperant ad impia and iniqua non cogant? Nam quid intersit ad
incolumitatem bonosque mores quod alij vicerunt, alij victi sunt, omnino non
video. That is, What matters it under whose government he who is daily dying
lives, if they who command force him not to the practice of impious things? For
I cannot any ways perceive what advantage it is either to our safety, or
integrity of life and manners, that some are conquerors, others are conquered.
