(...) against breakinge or defacing of monumentes of antiquity, being set up
in Churches or other public places for memory, and not for supersticion.
THe Queen's Majesty understanding, that by the means of sundry people, partly
ignorant, partly malicious or covetous: there has been of late years spoiled
and broken, certain ancient monumentes, some of metal, some of stone, which
were erected up as well in Churches, as in other public places within this
Realm, only to show a memory to the posterity of the persons there buried, or
that had been benefactours to the buyldynges, or dotations of the same Churches
or public places, and not to noryshe any kind of superstition: By which
means, not only the Churches and places remain at this present day spoiled,
broken, and ruinated, to thoffence of all noble and gentle hearts, and
thextinguyshyng of the honorable and good memory of sundry virtuous and noble
persons deceassed: But also the true understanding of diverse families in this
Realm (who have descended of the blood of the same persons deceassed) is
thereby so darkened, as the true course of their inheritance may be hereafter
interrupted, contrary to Justice, besides many other offenses that hereof do
ensue, to the sclaunder of such as either gave or had charge in times paste
only to deface monumentes of Idolatry, and false feigned Images in Churches and
Abbeyes. And therefore, although it be very hard to recover things broken and
spoiled: yet both to provide that no such barbarous disorder be hereafter used,
and to repair as much of the said monumentes as conveniently may be: Her
Majesty charge and commands all manner of persons, hereafter to forbear
the breakyng or defacyng of any parcel of any monument, or tomb, or grave, or
other inscription and memory of any person deceassed, being in any manner of
place, or to break any Image of Kings, Princes, or noble estates of this
Realm, or of any other that have been in times past erected and set up, for the
only memory of them to their posterity in common Churches, and not for any
religious honor: or to break down or deface any Image in glass wyndowes in
any Church, without consent of the Ordinary: upon pain, that whosoever shall
herein be found to offend, to be committed to the next Gayle, and there to
remain without bail or mainprise, unto the next coming of the Justices, for
the delyuery of the said Gayle, and then to be further punyshed by fine or
imprisonment (besides the restitution or reedification of the thing broken) as
to the said Justices shall seem meet, vsyng therein thaduise of Thordinarye,
and if need shall be, thaduise also of her Majesty's Counsel in her Star
chamber.

And for such as be already spoiled in any Church or Chapel now standing:
Her Majesty charge and commands all Archbyshops, Bishops, and other
Ordinaries, or Ecclesiastical persons, which have authority to visit the
same Churches or Chappelles, to inquyre by presentmentes of the Curates,
Churchwardens, and certain of the paryshyoners, what manner of spoils have been
made, since the beginning of her Majesty's reign, of such monumentes, and
by whom, and if the persons be living, how able they be to repair and to
reedifie the same, and thereupon to convent the same persons, and to enjoin
them under pain of excommunication, to repair the same by a convenient day,
or otherwise as the cause shall further require, to notify the same to her
Majesty's counsel in the Star chamber at Westminster. And if any such
shall be found and convicted thereof, not able to repair the same: that then
they be enjoined to do open penance two or three times in the Church, as to
the quality of the crime and party belongs, under like pain of
excommunication. And if the party that offended be dead, and thexecutours of
the will left, having sufficient in their hands vnadministred, and
thoffence notorious, the Ordinary of the place shall also inioyne them to
repair or reedifie the same, upon like or any other convenient pain to be
devised by the said Ordinary. And when thoffendour can not be presented, if it
be in any Cathedral or Collegiat Church, which has any revenue belongyng to
it, that is not perticulerly allotted to the sustentacion of any person
certain, or otherwise: but that it may remain in (...)cretion of the
gouernoure thereof, to bestow the same upon any other charytable deed, as
mending of hyghwayes, or such like: Her Majesty enioyneth and strayghtly
charge the governors and companies of every such Church, to employe such
parcelles of the said sommes of money (as any wise may be spared) upon the
spedye repair or reedification of any such monumentes so defaced or spoiled,
as agreeable to thoriginall, as the same conveniently may be.

And where the covetousness of certain persons is such, that as Patrones of
Churches, or owners of the personages impropriated, or by some other color or
pretense, they do persuade with the person and paryshioners to take or throw
down the Belles of Churches and Chapels, and the Lead of the same,
conuertyng the same to their private gain, and to the spoils of the said
places, and make such like alterations, as thereby they seek a sclaunderous
desolacion of the places of prayer: Her Majesty (to whom in the right of the
Crown by thordinaunce of Almighty God, and by the laws of this Realm, the
defense and protection of the Church of this Realm belongs) does expressly
forbid any manner of person, to take away any Belles or Lead of any Church or
Chapel, now used, or that ought to be used with public and divine service,
or otherwise deface any such Church or Chapel, under pain of imprisonmente
duringe her Majesty's pleasure, and such further fine for the contempt, as
shall be thought mete.

And her Majesty charge all Bishops and Ordinaries to enquire of all such
contemptes done from the beginning of her Majesty's Raygne, and to enjoin the
persons offendynge, to repair the same within a convenient time. And of their
doings in this behalf, to certifye her Majesty's pryuye Counsel, or the
Counsayl in the Star chamber at Westminster, that order may be taken herein.

Yeuen at Windsor the.xix. of September, the second year of her Majesty's
raygne.
God save the Queen.
