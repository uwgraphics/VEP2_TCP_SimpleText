Fragmenta Antiquitatis. ANCIENT TENURES OF LAND, And Jocular CUSTOMS Of some
MANNORS^

Made public for the diversion of some, and instruction of others.

By T.B. of the Inner Temple Esquire.

-- Neque semper Arcum tendit Apollo. Hor. LONDON, Printed by the Assigns of
Richard and Edward Atkins, Esquires. For Abel Roper, at the Sun, Tho. Basset,
at the George, and Christopher Wilkinson, at the Black-Boy, all in Fleetstreet,
1679.

TO THE READER.
WHilst I was perusing many of our both public and private Records for other
ends, I thought a small Collection of some remarkable Tenures of Land and
unusual Customs of some Mannours might not be unacceptable to the Studious, who
when weary with poring upon Littletons Tenures, and his Learned Commentator,
might relax are fibulam by recurring to these, and smile at the inoffensive
mirth both of our Kings in former times, and Lords of Mannours, in creating
them; some of which I confess are since, converted into a Rent, having a modo
arrentatur entered in the Record, others are by length of time disused, and
others yet remain in force: As not long since I had the curiosity to ask an old
Officer in the Exchequer, whether he ever remembered any Herring Pies paid to
the King for the Manor of Carleton in Norfolk? yes, very well, answered he,
for we had some of them in Court among us here last Term, Nor does the late Act
of Parliament, for taking away all Tenures by Knight Service and Capite, extend
to the discharging the honorary Services of Grand Serjeanty, other than of
Wardship, Marriage, etc. but are left standing on their old foundation by a
particular Proviso in that Act. Stat. 12. Car. 2. ca. 24.


Neither are these kind of Tenures unusual in other Countries* for we read of a
Queen of Hungary, who upon her Deathbed bequeathed the City and Province of
Altenburg to one of the Lords of her Court, upon condition that he and his
successors should always keep a certain number of Peacocks, in defect whereof
the Territory should revert to the Crown.

My first intention was to render all the Records in English; but upon second
thoughts, I judge the original words would be more acceptable both to the
Learned and Learner; and for the help of the latter, have explained (to the
best of my skill) those of any difficulty, at least as many of them as I could,
for some I believe may pose the ablest Glossographer now living; as Warocks,
Muta deynectorum Canum, Heymectis, Cyppos, Berbiagium, Chacuros, Sensas, Muta
vini and Gruna Vini, etc. Or, to speak more truly, I took them as I found them,
some out of the very Records, others extracted thence, and translated to my
hand; for I was not willing to spend very much time in rem levem, as Sir Henry
Spelman words it, upon a liike occasion. And yet, as light as the subject may
seem to be, I am very well informed, that Attorney General Noy had, a little
before his Death, bespoke a Copy of all the Tenures by Serjeanty, remaining
upon Record; it is like he judged them useful, or divertising, or both.

I have purposely omitted, or but rarely mentioned, those more common Tenures,
whereby the owner was obliged to deliver yearly into the Exchequer, a Mewed
Sparhawk, a pair of Spurs, Gloves or the like, of which kind I met with many,
and held them not for my purpose, which was to take in none but what were in
some respect or other remarkable.

Nor must I forget to advertise the Reader, that the names of diverse Mannours
and places here mentioned are written otherwise now, than they were of old,
which the knowing in each County will easily reconcile: And, however others may
like of this Essay, some Gentlemen of Ancient descent, I presume, will be well
enough pleased to see their Ancestors names thus revived and transmitted from
our seldom seen Records to a more public Register. Nothing of this nature,
having to my knowledge been ever till now, made public. And I will be bold to
say, the Studious in Law-latin and Record-learning shall not any where find so
much singular of that kind collected in so small a Volume.

The Manor of Scrivelsby in the County of Lincoln is and long has been held by
the Dymocks (to whom it devolved from the Marmyons) by grand Serjeanty, viz. of
being Champion to the Kings of England on their Coronation day.

By virtue of which tenure, Narrative by Elias Ashmole Esquire 1661.
at the Coronation Feast of his Majesty that now is, a little before the second
Course was served up, Sir Edw. Dymock (to whom the Court of Claymes had
adjudged the Office of the Kings Champion) entered Westminster Hall on a goodly
white Courser armed at all points in rich armor, and having a Plume of blew
Feathers in his Helm, he there made a stand for some time, and then advanced in
manner following, way being made for him by the Knight Marshal, First two
Trumpets, The Sergeant Trumpeter, The Sergeant at Arms, An Esquire carrying a
Target, having the Champions own Arms depicted thereon. An Esquire carrying the
Champions Lance upright. Mr. Owen, York Herald. The Earl Marshal on his left
hand. The Champion. The Lord High Constable on his right hand, Both likewise on
Horse back. At the lower end of the Hall York-Herald proclaimed the Challenge
in these following words.


Viz. If any Person of what degree soever high or low, shall deny or gainsay
our Sovereign Lord King Charles the Second King of England, Scotland, France
and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Son and next Heir to our Sovereign Lord
Charles the First, the last King Deceased, to be right Heir to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm of England, or that he ought not to enjoy the same, here is
his Champion, who says that he lies, and is a false Traitor, being ready in
person to combat with him, and in this Quarrel will adventure his life against
him, on what day soever he shall be appointed. Thereupon the Champion threw
down his Gantlet, which lying some small time, and no body taking it up, it was
delivered unto him again by York-Herald. Then all advanced forward until the
Champion came to the middle of the Hall, where York-Herald made the like
Proclamation, and the Gantlet was again thrown down and after some time
returned to the Champion, who advanced to the foot of the ascending steps to
the state, and at the top of the steps the said Herald proclaimed the Challenge
the third time, whereupon the Champion threw down his Gantlet again, which no
body taking up, it was finally delivered to him.

This being done, the Earl of Pembroke and Mongomery, with Viscount Montagu,
and the Lord Paget his Assistants, presented on the knee to the King a Guilt
Cup with a Cover full of wine, who drank to his Champion, and by the said Earl
sent him the Cup, who, after three Reverences, drank it all off, went a little
backward, and so departed the Hall, taking the Cup for his Fee, according as
had been adjudged him by the Court of Claims.

verne in the said Forest; and also by the service of finding a Man Armed with a
Coat of Mail, when our Lord the King will have him beyond Sea. For the keeping
of which Forest and Farm they ought to have all the rights and appurtenances
here under written. All Foresters in Fee of the said Forest shall be attendant
and answerable to them, as to the chief Forester of the said Forest, and they
ought to have the Horse and furniture, Saddle, Bridle, Sword and Horn of such
Foresters in Fee; when they dye. And they ought to have their Estovers of
Housebote and Haybote through the whole Bail aforesaid; and all amerciaments
for defaults made at the Court of the Forest; and all Pleas of Hares; Hcymedis.
q.
Nets, -- Badgers, Foxes, Wyldcats, and Partridges; And all Amerciaments for
the escapes of wild beasts, and for dead wood in the whole year, except in the
fence month (which was from fifteen days before Midsommer day to fifteen days
after) and was also called Tempus de Foyneson; because the Dear did then fawn,
or bring forth their young; and to have all their Cattle, except Sheep and
Goats, during the whole year quit of Herbage, and their Hogs quit of Paunage
for the whole year, except in the Fence month; and they ought to have the
Estrays of the whole Forest, and the Amerciaments for expeditating Dogs, and

Vermin through the whole Bail of the said Forest; And they ought to have the

Michael, to be pulled down without a Tool or Axe. And they ought to have on the
said Farm, whatsoever is thrown down by the wynd, except Wood, which belongs to
our Lord the King. And This Retropaunage I suppose is the latter or after
Paunage; for Paunage begins at Michaelmas and ends at Saint Martyns, in which
time the Beech Mast and Acorns are ripe and fall. And Retropaunage begins at
St. Martyns and ends at Candlemass in which time Hipps and Hawes and such like
Berries yield some nutriment to Swyne and Poultry.
Retropaunage, from the Feast of St. Martyn to the Feast of the Purification of
Blessed Mary: And all coverings or Crops of Timber felld for the Kings use or

fortune, but happily may be the right heir of the Familye, has of late years by
virtue of this Charter made several Clayms and commenced diverse suites both for
this Manor of Hopton in the hole in the County of Salop, and for diverse other
the Mannours and Lands of Raph late Lord Hopton; but hitherto for ought I hear
without any success.

Coringham. Hist. of St. Paul's. by Sir W. Dugdale

In the Third year of King Edward the First Sir William le Baud Knight made a
signal Grant to the Dean and Canons of St. Paul's London, of a Do yearly on the
feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul, and of a fat Buck upon the Commemoration
of the same Saint, to be offered at the high Altar in St. Paul's by the said Sir
William and his household-family, and then to be distributed among the Canons
resident; which said Do and Buck were so given by him in lieu of 22 acres of
Land lying within the Lordship of Westlee in Com. Essex, belonging to the said
Canons and by them granted to him and his heyrs to be enclosed within his Park
of Coringham. But about the certain time and formality in offering the said
Buck and Do there growing afterward some dispute, Sir Walter le Baud Knight
son and heyr of the said Sir William, by his Deed dated on the Ides of July, 30
Edward 1. for the health of his Soul and of his Progenitors and heyrs,
confirmed his said Fathers Grant and obliged himself and his heyrs, his Lands
and Tenements, That every year for ever on the day of the Conversion of St.
Paul, there should be a good fat Do, brought by one of his fitting Servants
and not the whole family, at the hour of Procession, and through the midst
thereof, and offered at the High Altar, without exacting any thing for the said
service of the Dean and Canons. And on the day of the Commemoration of St. Paul
in Summer, a fat Buck by some such Servant, attended with as many of the Family
as had heretofore been usual, and so carried through the midst of the
Procession, and offered at the high Altar; the said Dean and Canons, after the
Offering thus performed, giving, by the hands of their Chamberlain, one
shilling to the persons bringing the Buck for their entertainment. And to this
grant were witnesses Sir Nicholas de Wokyndon, Sir Richard de la Rokele, Sir
Thomas de Mandevyle, Sir John de Rocheford Knights, with diverse others. [The
reception of which Do and Buck was till Queen Elizabeth's days solemnly
performed at the steps of the Quire by the Canons of St. Paul's, attired in
their sacred Vestments and wearing Garlands of Flowers on their heads; and the
horns of the Buck carried on the top of a Spear in Procession round about
within the body of the Church with a gr(...) noise of horn blowers, Camd. in
Midelsex.

Which I have thus endeavored to English.

These are the Rights which belong to Robert Fitz-Walter, Castellan of London,
Lord of Wodeham, in the City of London: That is to say, that the said Robert
and his heirs ought to be and are chief Banner-bearers of London in Fee, for
the Castelry, which he and his Ancestors have of Baynards Castle in the said
City. In the time of war the said Robert and his heirs ought to serve the City,
in manner hereafter written.

That the said Robert ought to come armed upon his Horse of service, with
twenty men at Arms mounted upon Horses harnessed with Mail or with Iron, even
to the great door of the Minster of St. Paul, with a Banner of his Arms
displayed before him.

And when he is come to the great door of the said Minster, mounted and armd as
aforesaid, then ought the Mayor of London with all his Sheriffs and Aldermen,
to come on foot armed, out of the Minster of St. Paul, to the said door, with
his Banner in his hand, and the Banner ought to be Gules, an Image of St. Paul
d'or, the feet, hands and head Argent, with a sword Argent in the hand of the
said Image.

And as soon as the said Robert shall see the Mayor, and his Sheriffs and
Aldermen coming on foot out of the said Minster armed with this Banner, he, or
his heirs, who shall perform this service to the City, shall dismount his Horse
and salute the Mayor, as his Companion and shall say to him, Sir Mayor I am
come to do my service, which I owe to the City. And the Mayor, Sheriffs and
Aldermen shall say, we allow you here as our Banner-bearer of this City in Fee,
this Banner of the City to carry and govern to your power, to the Honor and
profit of our City.

And the said Robert and his heirs shall take the Banner in his hand: And the
Mayor and Sheriffs of the said City shall follow him to the door, and present
him with a Horse of xx l. price; which Horse shall have a Saddle garnished with
the Arms of the said Robert and covered with a Sendal of the same Arms; and
shall deliver xx l. sterling to the Chamberlain of the said Robert, for his
charges of that day.

And the said Robert shall mount the Horse, which the Mayor then presented him,
with the Banner in his hand, and as soon as he is mounted, he shall desire the
Mayor forthwith to cause a Marshall to be chosen out of the Host of the City of
London. And as soon as the Marshall is chosen, the said Robert shall command
the Mayor and his Burgesses of the City, to cause the common Signal to be
sounded through the City, that all the Communalty may follow the Banner of St.
Paul (carried before them by the said Roberts own hand) to Algate, to which the
said Robert and the Mayor shall assent.

If it so happen, that the said Robert shall march out of the City, then he
shall choose two of the most sage persons out of every Ward of the City, to
take care how it may best be guarded in his absence; and this Council shall be
held in the Priory of the Trinity, near Aldgate. And before every Town or
Castle which the Army of London shall beseige, if he continue a year about the
seige, the said Robert ought to have from the Commons of London, one hundred
shillings for his pains, and no more. These are the Rights which the said
Robert ought to have in London in the time of War. These are the Rights
appertaining to Robert le Fitz-Walter and his heirs, in London in time of Peace.


That is to say; that the said Robert has a Soke in the City of London, viz.
from the Wall of the Canonry of St. Paul as a man goes down by the Boe^house.
Bracine of St. Paul to the Thames and so to the side of the Mill which stands
on the water that runs down by Fleet-Bridge, and thence by London Walls round
about the Friars Preachers, to Ludgate: And so returns by the back of the said
Friars House, to the corner of the said Canons Wall of St. Paul. That is to
say, all the Parish of the Church of St. St. Andrew Wardrobe.
Andrew which is in the gift of his Ancestors, by the said Seignory.

The said Robert has also apppendant to this Soke, all these things here under
written: That he ought to have a Sokeman of his own choice, provided he be of
the Sokemanry. And if any of the Sokemanry shall be impleaded in the Guild Hall
for any matter which touches not the body of the Mayor for the time being, or
any Sheriff of the said City, it shall be lawful for the Sokeman of the
Sokemanry of the said Robert le Fitz-Walter, to demand the Court of the said
Robert le Fitz-Walter.

And the Mayor and Citizens of London ought to grant him to have his Court, in
which his Judgment ought to be agreeable to that of the Guild Hall. If any
thief shall be taken In his Soke, he ought to have his flocks and imprisonment
in his Soke, and from thence he shall be carried to the Guild Hall before the
Mayor, to receive his Judgment, which ought there to be given; but the Judgment
shall not be pronounced, until he come in the Court of the said Robert and in
his Franchise. And the Judgment shall be such; If he have deserved death for
Treason, he ought to be tied to a Pillar which stands in the Thames at
Wood-wharf, whereunto Watermen tie their Barges or Boats, and there continue
two Floods and two Ebbs of the Water. And if he be condemned for a common
Larcin, he ought to be hanged at the These Elms stood near smithfeild and were
the place of Execution, before Tyburn had that Office.
Elms, and there suffer his Judgment, as other common Thieves.

Also the said Robert and his heirs have a great honor, in holding so great a
Franchise in the said City, where the Mayor and Citizens ought to do him
right; that is to say, that when the Mayor is minded to hold a great Council,
he ought to call the said Robert or his heirs, to be of his Council, and of the
said Cities Council: And the said Robert ought to be sworn of the Cities
Council, against all people; save the King of England and his heirs.

And when the said Robert shall come to the Hustings at the Guild Hall of the
said City, the Mayor or his Deputy ought to rise to him, and then place him by
him. And whilst he is in the Guild Hall, all Judgments ought to be pronounced
by his mouth, according to the Record of the Recorders of the Guild Hall. And
all the Waifs which shall happen, whilst he is there, he ought to give to the
Bailifs of the City, or to whom he pleases, by advice of the Mayor of the said
City.

Id est. To our Lord the King and his Council Richard de Bettoyne of London
shows that whereas, at the Coronation of our Lord the King that now is, he
being then Mayor of London, performed the Office of Butler, with three hundred
and sixty Valets clothed in the same Livery, each one carrying in his hand a
white Silver Cup, as other Mayors of London have time out of mind used to do,
at the Coronation of the Kings Progenitors, and the Fee, appendant to that
service, that is to say, a Gold Cup with a Cover, and with an Ewer of Gold
enameled, was delivered to him by assent of the Earl of Lancaster and other
great men, then of our Lord the Kings Council, by the hands of Sir Robert de
Woodhouse: And now there comes an Estreat out of the Exchequer to the Sheriffs
of London, for the levying of 89 l. 12 s. 6 d. for the said fee upon the goods
and Chattels of the said Richard, wherein he prays that remedy may be ordained
him. And the Mayor and Citizens of Oxford are bound by Charter, to come to
London at the Coronation, to assist the Mayor of London in serving at the
Feast, and so have always used to do. Or if it please our Lord the King and
his Council, we will willingly pay the Fee, so that we may be discharged of
that Service.

tres Dextrarii are Horses for the great Saddle, from the French Dectrier,
denoting as much. Chacuros must either signify Hounds or Dogs for the Chase,
from the French Chaseur, a Huntsman; or Coursers, Horses for speed or Career,
from the French Coursier, but the first seems most probable. The word in
another Record, tit. Norton, is written Catzuros, and I suppose intended for
the same thing. And it adds to the probability of this exposition in that King
John was a great lover of Horses Hawks and Hounds, taking a great part of his
Fines in those Animals of recreation as appears by the Fine Rolls of his time.
What Sensas may signify let the more Learned Determine.

Thurgarton and Horsepoll.
The tenants of these Manors in Com. Nottingham held their Lands by these
Customs and services. Reg. Priorat. de Thurgarton cited by Dr. Thurroton. in
his Antiq. of Not. shire.
Every Native or Villain (which were such as we now call husbandmen) paid each
a Cock and a Hen, besides a small Rent in Money, for a Tossed and one Bovat of
Land, held of the Priory of Thurgarton. These Cocks and Hens were paid the
second day in Christmas, and that day every one both Cottagers and Natives,
dined in the Hall, and those who did not had a white loaf, and a Flagon of Ale,
with one Mess from the Kitchen. Every Villain gave a halfpeny toward
cleansing the Mill-damm. The Freeholders were bound to ( tribus arruris) three
plow days for the Lord with one Plow, which were then valued at 12 d. and
likewise 3 days work in Harvest, the first day with one man, the second day
with two, and and the third with five workmen and one of themselves in person,
and every day to have their refection. The Natives were likewise bound to give
three Plowdays each, and every plow was to be allowed four boon-loaves, and to
harrow three days, and every harrower was allowed a brown loaf and two
herrings a day. Likewise all the Natives and Cotagers were to reap every other
day in harvest, the first day every two were to have one brown loaf and two
Toillects, the second day, two brown loaves and one Toillect, and afterward
every two men to have every day three brown loaves. And on the day of the great
Bidrepe, which was called the Priors Boon, every Native was to find three
Workmen and Cottager one. Every of the said Natives were to make carriage from
the forain Granges thrice a year, each with one Horse, and every time to have a
Miche or white loaf; And all the Reapers in Harvest which were called
Hallewimen were to eat in the Hall one day in Christmas, or afterward at the
discretion of the Celerer. Likewise every Naif or she Villain that took a
husband or committed fornication paid Marchet, for redemption of her blood, 5
s. 4 d. and the Daughter of a Cottager paid but half a Marchet. And every
Native paid for Paunage of every* Swine in the Park 3 d. etc.

East and West Enborne.
The Manors of East and West Enborne in Com. Berks have this Custom: Law Dict.
Verbo, Free-Bench.
That if a Copyhold tenant dye, the Widow shall have her Free-Bench in all his
Copyhold Lands dum sola and casta fuerit; but if she commit Incontinency, she
forfeits her Widows estate, yet after this if she come into the next Court held
for the Manor, riding backward on a black Ram, with his tail in her hand, and
say the words following, the Steward is bound by the Custom to readmit her to
her Free-Bench.

Here I am, riding upon a black Ram,
Like a Whore as I am;
And for my Crincum Crancum,
Have lost my Bincum bancum;
And for my Tails game,
Am brought to this worldly shame.
Therefore, good Mr. Steward let me have my Lands again.
The like Custom is in the Manor of Tor in Devonshire, and elsewhere in the
West.

Rochford.
On Kingshill at Rochford in the County of Essex, Ex Rot. Curiae Ib.
on every Wednesday morning next after Michaelmas day at Cocks crowing, there
is by ancient Custom a Court held by the Lord of the Honor of Raleigh, which
is vulgarly called the Lawless Court. The Steward and Suitors whisper to each
other, and have no Candles, nor any Pen and Ink, but supply that office with a
Coal; And he that ows suit or service thereto and appears not, forfeits to the
Lord double his Rent every hour he is absent. The Court is called Lawless,
because held at an unlawful or lawless hour, on quia dicta sine lege; The title
of it in the Court Rolls runs thus, to this day.

Kingshill in Rochford. ff. Curia de Domino Rege

This Lawless Court is imperfectly mentioned by Camden in his description of
Essex; Camd. Brit. fo. 441.
who says this servile attendance was imposed on the Tenants of that Manor,
for conspiring, at the like unseasonable time, to raise a Commotion.

Kidlington.
At Kidlington in Oxfordshire the Custom is, That on monday after Whitson
week, Ex relation^ habitantium.
there is a fat live Lamb provided, and the Maids of the Town, having their
thumbs tied behind them run after it, and she that with her mouth takes and
holds the Lamb, is declared Lady of the Lamb, which being dressed with the skin
hanging on, is carried on a long Pole before the Lady and her Companions to the
Green, attended with Music and a Morisco Dance of Men, and another of Women,
where the rest of the day is spent in dancing, mirth and merry glee. The next
day the Lamb is part baked, boyld and roast, for the Ladies feast, where she
sits majestically at the upper end of the Table and her Companions with her,
with music and other attendants, which ends the solemnity*

to his Steward, these words.

For mine Arses fault take I this pain, Therefore, my Lord, give me my Land

She is by the Custom to be restored to it without further Fine, doing this
Penance.

signify I am to learn.

Coleshill.
They have an ancient Custom at Coleshill in the County of Warwick, that if the
youngmen of the Town can catch a Hare, and bring it to the Parson of the Parish
before ten of the clock on Easter-monday, the Parson is bound to give them a
Calves head and a hundred of Eggs for their Breakfast, and a groat in money.

Fiskerton and Moreton.
The Custom was here, Reg. Pr^rat. de Thurgarton.
for the Natives and Cottagers to Plow and Harrow for the Lord, and to work one
Boon-day for him every week in Harvest, when every two workmen had three
Boon-loaves with Companage allowed them. Each Customary Tenant in Fiskerton and
Moreton (in Com. Not.) one day in the year found a man to cleanse the Dam of
Fiskerton Mill. Si quis Braciatrix braciaverit Cerevisiam, if any Alewife
brewed Ale to sell, she was bound to satisfy the Lord for Tolsester. If any
Native or Cottager sold a Male Youngling after it was weaned, he paid 4 d. to
the Lord as a Fine; Or killed a Swine above a year old he paid the Lord one
Penny, which was called Thistletac. Every she Native that married or committed
Fornication, paid pro redemptione sanguinis, 5 s. 4 d. to the Lord which was in
lieu of marcheta mulierum, which whether from Mark a Horse in the old Gallique
(implying the obscene signification of equitare) as Mr. Seldom thinks, or from
Marca, the sum of money, by which it was afterward commonly redeemed, I cannot
determine.

Stanlake.
At Stanlake in the County of Oxford the Minister of the Parish in his
Procession in Rogation week, Not. Hist. of Ox. sh. fo. 203.
reads a Gospel at a Barrels head in the Cellar of the Chequer Inn in that
Town, where some say there was formerly an Hermitage: Others, that there was
anciently a Cross, at which they read a Gospel in former times, over which now
the House and particularly the Cellar being built, they are forced to continue
the Custom in manner as above.

Burford.
About the year 750, Ibid. fo. 348.
a Battle was fought near Burford in Oxfordshire, perhaps on the place still
called Battle-Edge, west of the Town toward Vpton, between Cuthred or Cuthbert
a Tributary King of the West Saxons, and Ethelbald King of Mercia, whose
insupportable Exactions the former King not being able to endure, he came into
the Field against Ethelbald, met and overthrew him there, winning his Banner
whereon was depicted a Golden Dragon, in memory of which Victory, the Custom
(yet within memory) of making a Dragon yearly and carrying it up and down the
Town in great jollity on Midsomer Eve, to which they added the Picture of a
Giant, was in all likelihood first instituted.

Ensham.
It has been the Custom at Ensham in Oxfordshire, for the Towns people on
Whit-Monday, Not. Hist. of Ox. sh.
to cut down and bring away (wherever the Churchwardens pleased to mark it
out, by giving the first Chop) as much timber as could be drawn by men's hands
into the Abby-yard, whence if they could draw it out again, notwithstanding all
the impediments could be given by the servants of the Abbey, and since that by
the Family of the Lord, it was then their own, and went in part at least to the
reparation of their Church: And by this Custom, as some will have it, they hold
both their Lammas and Michaelmas Common.

Bondsman, should buy out his Villainous blood, and make himself a Freeman.

Lodebrook.
Ex. Antiq. Rentali ejusd. Man.
In the Manor of Lodebrook in the County of Warwic, whereof the Catesbyes were
heretofore Lords, each Tenant paid I know not what this Swarf-money may
signify, unless it were miswritten for Warth-money, or Ward-money.
Swarf-money yearly, which was one penny halfpenny; It must be paid (says the
Rental) before the rising of the Sun, the party must go thrice about the Cross,
and say, The Swarf-Money, and then take witness, and lay it in the hole; And
when he has so done, he must look well that his witness do not deceive him,
for if it be not paid, he gives a great forfeiture, thirty shillings and a
white Bull.

Chester.
In the time of King John, Sir Pet. L^yc. Hist. Antiquities of Chesshire.
Randle the third surnamed Blundevil Earl of Chester, having many Conflicts
with the Welsh was at last distressed by them and forced to retreat to the
Castle of Rothelent in Flint shire, where they besieged him, who presently sent
to his Constable of Chester, Roger Lacy, surnamed Hell for his fiery spirit,
that he would come with all speed and bring what forces he could for his
relief. Roger having gathered a tumultuous rout of Fiddlers Players, Cobblers and
other debauched persons both men and Women out of the City of Chester (for
'twas then the Fair there) marched immediately with them toward the besieged
Earl. The Welsh, perceiving a great multitude coming, raised the siege and
fled. The Earl, coming back with his Constable to Chester, gave him power over
all the Fiddlers and Shoemakers of Chester in reward and memory of this service.
The Constable retained to himself and his heirs the authority and donation of
the Shoemakers, but John his Son conferred the Authority over the Lechers and
Whores on his Steward, which then was Dutton of Dutton, by this his deed.

Sciant praesentes and futuri, quod ego Johannes Constabularius Cestriae, dedi
and concessi and hac praesenti Carta confirmavi Hugoni de Dutton and haeredibus
suis Magistratum omnium Leccatorum and Meretricum totius Cestershiriae, sicut
liberius illum magistratum teneo de Comite. Salvo jure meo mihi and heredibus
meis. Hiis testibus --

Though this original Grant makes no mention of giving Rule over Fiddlers and
Minstrels, yet ancient Custom has now reduced it only to the Minstrelsey; for
probably the Rout which the Constable brought to the Rescue of the Earl, were
debauched persons drinking with their Sweethearts in the Fair, the Fiddlers that
attended them and such loose persons as he could get.

Anno 14- Hen 7. a Quo Waranto was brought against Laurence Dutton of Dutton
Esquire, Inter Placita apud cestriam. 14 H. 7.
to show why he claimed all the Minstrels of Cheshire and the City of Chester,
to appear before him at Chester yearly on the Feast of Saint John Baptist, and
to give him at the said Feast quatuor Lagenas Vini and unam Lanceam. i. Four
Flagons of wine and a Lance, and also every Minstrel then to pay him four pence
halfpeny, and why he claimed from every Whore in Chesshire and the City of
Chester (Officium suum exercente) four pence yearly at the said feast, etc.
Whereunto he pleaded prescription.

The heirs of this Hugh de Dutton enjoy the same power and Authority over the
Minstrelsy of Cheshire even to this day, and keep a Court every year upon the
Feast of Saint John Baptist at Chester, being the Fair day, where all the
Minstrels of the County and City do attend and play before the Lord of Dutton
upon their several Instruments: He or his Deputy then riding through the City,
thus attended to the Church of St. John, many Gentlemen of the County
accompanying him, and one walking before him in a Surcoat of his Arms, depicted
upon Taffata; And after Divine Service ended holds his Court in the City, where
he or his Steward renews the old Licenses granted to the Minstrels, and gives
such new ones as he thinks fit, under the Hand and Seal of himself or his
Steward, none presuming to exercise that faculty there without it. But now this
Dominion or privilege is by a Daughter and heir of Thomas Dutton devolved to
the Lord Gerard of Gerards Bromley in Staffordshhire.

And whereas by the Statute of 39 Eliz* Fiddlers are declared to be Rogues,
Stat. 39. Eliz. cap. 4.
yet by a special Proviso therein those in Chesshire, Licenced by Dutton of
Dutton, are exempted from that infamous Title, in respect of this his ancient
Custom and privilege.

lodging with the Bride, which the Lord anciently claimed in some Manors.

certain sum of Money called Mise-Money* In consideration whereof they claim to
be acquit of all Fines and amerciaments, which are Recorded at that time in the
Court Rolls and not levied, which they call White Books.

Dunmow.
The Custom of the Priory of Dunmow in the County of Essex was such, Reg.
Priorat. it. de Dunmow.
That if any person from any part of England came thither, and humbly kneeled
on two stones at the Churchdoor (which are yet to be seen) and solemnly took
the ensuing Oath before the Prior and Convent, he might demand of them a Gamon
or Flitch of Bacon, You shall swear by the Custom of our Confession,
That you never made any Nuptial transgression,
Since you were married to your wife,
By household brawles, or contentious strife;
Or otherwise in bed or at board
Offended each other in deed or in word,
Or since the Parish Clerk said Amen
Wished your selves unmarried again;
Or in a twelve month and a day
Repented not in thought any way;
But continued true and in desire,
As when you joined hands in holy Quire.
If to these conditions, without all fear,
Of your own accord you will freely swear,
A Gamon of Bacon you shall receive,
And bear it hence with love and good leave;
For this is our custom at Dunmow well known,
Though the sport be ours, the Bacon's your own.


It appears in an old Register of this Priory, That Richard Wright of
Badesnorth in Norfolk, in the 23 of Henry the sixth, when John Canon was Prior,
that Steven Samuel of Little Easton in Essex 7o Edward 4. when Roger Rulcot was
Prior* And that Thomas Lee of Coxal in Essex 2 Hen. 8. when John Tailor was
Prior, demanded their Bacon, upon the terms abovesaid, and received it
accordingly.

The Modern Usage.
Upon the morrow after the Assumption of the blessed Virgin, being the 26th. of
August, The present Steward is the Duke of Ormond, and Mr. Edw. Foden his
deputy. The Earl of Devon. is Prior.
all the Musicians within the Honor are to repair to the Bailiffs House in
Tutbury, where the Steward of the Court (who is usually a noble man) and the
Woodmaster or his Lieutenant are to meet them, from whence they go to the
Church in this order, I two wind Musicians as Trumpets or long Pipes, then four
string Musicians, two and two, all playing: then the Steward of the Court or
his deputy and the Bailiff of the Manor, deputed by the Earl of Devon. the
King of Music going between them: After whom the four Stewards of Music, each
with a white Wand in his hand, and the rest of the company follow in order.

At the Church the Vicar of Tutbury for the time being reads the service of the
day, for which every Musician pays him a penny; Then all go from the Church to
the Castle in manner as before, Where the Steward takes his place upon the
Bench in Court, assisted with the Bailiff and Woodmaster, the King of Music
sitting between them, to see that every minstrel within the Honor, being called
and making default, be presented and amerced by the Jury, which Amercements are
collected by the Stewards of Music, who account the one Moity to his Majesty's
Auditor, the other they retein themselves for their pains in collecting them.

When the King, Steward and the rest are so fate, the Steward commands an Oyez
to be made three times by one of the Musicians, as Crier of the Court, that all
Minstrels within the Honor, residing in the Counties of Stafford, Derby,
Nottingham Leicester or Warwick, do appear to do their suit and service, on
such pain and peril as the Court shall inflict for their default, Essoynes
nevertheless are allowed, in excuse of defaulters, upon good reason showed.

After which all the said Minstrels are called by a Sute-roll, as Suitors are
in a Court Leet, And then two Juries are empanelled of the chief Minstrells, by
the Stewards of Music, each Jury consisting of 12, which are returned into the
Court, where the Steward swears them; The form of their oath is the same which
is given in a Court Leet, only in a Leet the Jury swear to keep the Kings
Counsel, their fellows and their own, in this to keep the King of Musicks
Counsel, their fellows and their own.

The better to inform the Jurors of their duty the Steward gives them a charge,
in commendation of the ancient Science of Music, showing what admirable
effects it has produced, what Kings and Noble persons have been Professors of
it, what manner of persons the Professors ought to be, and to admonish them to
choose skilful and good men to be Officers for the year ensuing.

The Officers chosen by the Jurjes are one King and three Stewards of Music,
the fourth is chosen by the Steward of the Court, the King is chosen one year
out of the Minstrells of Stafford shire, and the next year out of those of
Derby shire.

The Steward of the Court issues out Warrants to the Stewards of Music in
their several districts, by virtue whereof they are to distrain and levy in any
City, Town Corporate or other place within the Honor, all such fines and
Amerciaments as are imposed by the Juries on any Minstrel for offenses
committed against the dignity and honor of the profession; The one Moity of
which Fines the Stewards account for at the next Audit, the other they retain
themselves.

As soon as the Charge is given an Oyez is made, with a Proclamation, that if
any person can inform the Court of any offense committed by any Minstrel within
the said Honor, since the last Court, which is against the honor of his
profession, let them come forth and they shall be heard. Then the Juries
withdraw to consider of the points of the Charge, and the old Stewards of
Music bring into the Court a Treat of Wine, Ale and Cakes, and at the same
time some Minstrels are appointed to entertain the Company in Court with some
merry Airs. After which the Juries present one to be King for the year ensuing,
who takes his oath to keep up all the dignities of that Noble Science etc. Then
the old King arises from his place, resigning it and his white Wand to the new
King, to whom he also drinks a glass of wine and bids him joy of his honor;
And the old Stewards do the like to the new, which done the Court adjourns to a
certain hour after noon, and all return back in the same order they came to the
Castle, to a place where the old King, at his own cost, prepares a dinner for
the new King, Steward of the Court, Bailiff, Stewards of music and the Jurymen.

After dinner all the Minstrels repair to the Priory Gate in Tutbury; without
any manner of weapons, attending the turning out of the Bull, which the Bailiff
of the Manor is obliged to provide, and is there to have the tips of his horns
sawed off, his ears and tail cut off, his body smeared all over with Soap, and
his nose blown full of beaten Pepper. Then the Steward causes Proclamation to
be made, That all manner of persons, except Minstrels, shall give way to the
Bull, and not come within forty foot of him at their own peril, nor hinder the
Minstrels in their pursuit of him. After which proclamation the Priors Bailiff
turns out the Bull among the Minstrels, and if any of them can cut off a piece
of his Skin before he runs into Derby shire, then he is the King of Musicks
Bull: But if the Bull get into Derby shire sound and uncut, he is the Lord
Priors again.

If the Bull be taken and a piece of him cut off, then he is brought to the
Bailiffs house and there collered and roped, and so brought to the bullring in
the highstreet in Tutbury, and there baited with Dogs, the first course in
honor of the King of Music, tha second in honor of the Prior, the third for
the Town, and if more, for divertisement of the spectators; and after he is
baited, the King may dispose of him as he pleases.

This usage is of late perverted, the young men of Stafford and Derby shires
contend with cudgels about a yard long, the one party to drive the Bull into
Derby shire, the other to keep him in Stafford shire, in which contest many
heads are often broken. [The King of Music and the Bailiff have also of late
compounded, the Bailiff giving the King five Nobles in lieu of his right to the
Bull, and then sends him to the Earl of Devons Manor of Hardwick to be fed and
given to the Poor at Christmas.]
