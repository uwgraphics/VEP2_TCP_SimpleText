The panges of Love and lovers fttes.
WAs not good King Salamon
Ravished in sundry wise
with every lively Paragon
That glistered before his eyes
If this be true as true it was
Lady lady.
why should not I serve you alas
My dear lady.
When Paris was enamoured
with Helena dame bewties pear
whom Uenus first him promised
To venture on and not to fear
what sturdy storms endured he
Lady lady
To win her love er it would be
My dear lady.
Know ye not how Troylus
Languished and lost his joy
with fittes and fevers marvelous
For Cresseda that dwelt in Troy
Till pytie planted in her breast
lady lady.
To sleep with him and grant him rest
My dear lady.
I read sometime how venterous
Leander was his love to please

Of Abidon those surginge sease
To come to her where as she lay
lady lady.
Till he was drowned by the way
my dear lady.
what say ye then to Priamus
That promised his love to mete
And found by fortune marvelous
A bloody cloth before his feet
For Tysbies sake him self he slew
lady lady
To prove that he was a lover true
my dear lady.
when Hercules for Eronie
murdered a monster fell
He put him self in ieoperdie
Perilous as the stories tell
Reske winge her upon the shore
lady lady.
which else by lot had died therefore
my dear lady.
An axaretis bewtifull
when Iphis did behold and see
with sighs and sobbinges pitiful
That Paragon long wooed he
And when he could not win her so
Lady lady
He went and honge him self for woe
My dear lady.
Besides these matters marvelous
Good Lady yet I can tell the more
The Gods have been full amourous
As Jupiter by learned lore
who changed his shape as fame has spread
lady lady.
To come to Alcumenaes bed.
My dear lady.
And if beauty breed such blissfulness
Enamouring both God and man
Good Lady let no wilfulness
Exuperate your bewtye then
To slaye the hertes that yield and crave
lady lady
The grant of your goodwil to have
My dear lady.
Finis.
