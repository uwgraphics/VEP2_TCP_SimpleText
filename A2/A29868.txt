Religio* Medici.

Religio Medici.
FOr my Religion, though there be several circumstances that might persuade
the world, that I have none at all, as the general scandal of my profession,
the natural course of my studies the indifferency of my behavior, and
discourse in matters of Religion, neither violently defending one, nor with
that common ardo^r of contention opposing another; yet in dispight hereof I
dare, without usurpation, assume the honorable style of a Christian: not that
I merely owe this style to the Font, my education, or the clime wherein I was
borne, as being bred up either to confirm those principles my Parents
instilled into my unweary understanding; or by a general consent proceed in
the Religion of my Country: But having, in my riper years, and confirmed
judgment, seen and examined all, I find my self obliged by the principles
of Grace, and the law of my ^wn reason, to embrace no other name but this;
neither does herein my zeal so far make me forget the general charity I owe
unto humanity, as rather to hate than pity Turks, Infidels, and (what is worse)
Jews, rather contenting my self to enjoy that happy style, then maligning
those who refuse so glorious a title. But because the name of a Christian is
become too general to express our faith, there being a Geography of Religions
as well as of Land, and every Clime distinguished not only by their laws and
limits, but circumscribed by their doctrines and rules of Faith: To be
particular, I am of that reformed new-cast Religion, wherein I dislike nothing
but the name, of the same belief that our Savior taught, the Apostles
disseminated, the Fathers authorized, and the Martyrs confirmed; but by the
sinister ends of Princes, the ambition and avarice of Presbyters, and the fatal
corruption of times so decayed, impaired, and fallen from its native beauty,
that it required the careful and charitable hand of the times to restore it to
its primitive integrity: now the accidental occasions whereon the slender
means whereby the low and abject condition of the person by whom ^o good a
work was set on foot, which ^n our adversaries beget contempt and ^corn,
fills me with wonder, and is the very same objection the insolent Pagans first
cast against Christ and his Disciples.

Yet h^ve I not shaken hands with those desperate Resolvers, who had rather
ven^ure at large their decayed bottom, then bring her in to be new trimmed in
the dock; who had rather promiscuously retain all, then abridge any, and
obstinately be what they are, than what they have been, as to stand in
diameter and swords point with them: we have reformed from them, not against
them; for omitting those improperations and terms of scurrility betwixt us,
which only difference our affections, and not our cause, there is betwixt us
one common name, and appellation, one faith, and necessary body of principles
common to us both; and therefore I am not scrupulous to converse and live with
them, to enter their Churches in defect of ours, and either pray with them* or
for them: I could never perceive any rational consequ^nce from those many
texts which prohibit the children of Israel to pollute themselves with the
Temples of the Heathens; we being all Christians, and not divided by such
detested impieties ^s might profane our prayers, or the place wherein^ we make
them; or that a resolved conscience may not adore her Creator any where,
especially in places devoted to his service; where if their devotions offend
him, mine may please him, if theirs profane it, mine may hallow it; holy water
and the Crucifix (dangerous to the commonpeople) deceive not my judgment, nor
abuse my devotion at all: I am I confess, naturally inclined to that, which
misguided zeal terms superstition, my common conversation I do acknowledge
austere, my behavior full of rigor, sometimes not without morosity; yet at my
devotion I love to use the civility of my knee, hat, and hand, with all those
outward and sensible motions, which may express, or promote my invincible
devotion; I should cut off my arm, rather than violate a Church window, than
deface or demolish the memory of a Saint or Martyr; at the sight of a Cross or
Crucifix I can dispense with my hat, but not with the thought or memory of my
Savior; I cannot laugh at the fruitless journeys of Pilgrims, or contemn the
miserable condition of Friars; For though misplaced circumstances, there is
something in it of devotion: I could never hear the Ave Marie Bell without an
occasion, or think it a sufficient warrant, because they erred in one
circumstance, for me to err in all, that is in silence and dumb contempt;
where therefore they directed their devotions to her, I offe^ed mine to God,
and rectified the errors of their prayers by rightly ordering mine own; at a
solemn procession I have wept abundantly, while my consorts blind with
opposition and prejudice, have fallen into an excess of scorn and laughter:
there are questionless both in Greek, Roman and Africa Churches, solemnities,
and ceremonies, whereof the wiser zeales do make a Christian use, and stand
condemned by us; not as evil in themselves, but as allurances and baits of
superstition to those vulgar heads that look asquint on the face of truth, and
those unstable judgments that cannot consist in the narrow point and center of
justice, without a reele or stagger to the circumference. As there are many
Reformers, so likewise many Reformations; every Country proceeding in a
particular way and Method, according as their natural interest with their
constitution and clime inclined them, some angerly and with extremity, others
calmely, and with mediocrity, not rending, but easily dividing the community,
and leaving an honest possibility of reconciliation, which the peaceable
Spirits do desire, and may conceive that revolution of time, and mercies of
God may effect; yet that judgment that shall consider the present antipathies
between the two extremes, their contrarieties in affection and opinion, may
with the same hope expect an union in the poles of Heaven; but to difference my
self nearer, and draw into the lesser circle: There is no Church whose every
part so squares unto my conscience, whose articles, constitutions, and customs
seems so consonant unto reason, and as it were framed to my particular
devotion, as this whereof I hold my belief, the Church of England, to whose
faith I am a sworn subject, and therefore in a double obligation, subscribe
unto her Articles, and endeavor to observe her constitutions: no man shall
retch my faith unto another Article, or command my obedience to a Canon more:
whatsoever is beyond us, as points indifferent, I observe according to the
rules of my private reason, or the humor or fashion of my devotions, neither
believing this, because Luther affirmed it, or disproving that, because Calvin
has disavouched it: I condemn not all things in the Council of Trent, nor
approve all in the Synod of Dort: In brief, where the Scripture is silent, the
Church is my Text, where that speaks, it is but my comment, where there is a
joint silence of both, I borrow not the rules of my Religion from Rome or
Geneva, but the dictates of my own reason. It is an unjust scandal of our
adversaries, and gross^ error in our selves, to compute the Nativity of our
Religion from Henry the eighth, who though he rejected the Pope, confuted not
the faith of Rome, and effected no more than what his own Predecessors
de^ired and assayed in ages past, and was conceived the State of Venice would
have attempted in our days.

It is as uncharitable a point in us to fall upon those popular scurrilities
and opprobrious scoffs of the Bishop of Rome, to whom as to a temporal Prince,
we owe the duty of a good language: I confess there is cause of passion
between us; by his sentence I stand excommunicated, Heretic is the best
language he affords me; yet can no ^are witness I ever returned to him the
name of Antichrist, man of sin, or whore of Babylon; It is the method of
charity to suffer without reaction: those usual Satyrs, and invectives of the
Pulpit may perchance produce a good effect on the vulgar, whose ears are
opener to Rhetoric than Logic, yet do they no wise confirm the faith of
wiser believers, who knows that a good cause needs not to be patronized by a
passion, but can sustain it self upon a temperate dispute.

I could never divide my self from any upon the difference of an opinion, or
be angry with his judgment for not agreeing with me in that, from which
perhaps within a few days I should dissent my self: I have no Genius to
disputes in Religion, and have often thought it wisdom to decline them, and
especially upon a disadvantage, or when the cause of Truth might suffer in the
weakness of my patronage: where we desire to be informed, it is good to
contest with men above our selves; but to confirm and establish our opinions,
it is best to agree with judgments below our own, that the frequent spoils
and victories over their reasons may settle in our selves an esteem, and
confirm opinion of our own. Every man is not a proper Champion for Truth, nor
fit to take up the Gantlet in the cause of Verity: Many from the Ignorance of
their Maxims, and an inconsiderate zeal to Truth, have too rashly charged the
troubles of error, and remain as Trophies to the enemies of Truth: A man may
be in as just possession of Truth as of a City, and yet be forced to surrender;
it is therefore far better to enjoy with peace, than to hazard her on a
battle: If therefore there rise any doubts in my way, I do forget them, or at
least defer them, till my better settled judgment, and more manly reason be
able to resolve them; for I perceive every man's own reason is his best
Oedipus, and will upon a reasonable truce, find a way to loose those bonds
wherewith subtilties of error have enchained our more flexible and tender
judgments. In Philosophy where truth seems double forced, there is no man
more paradoxicall than my self; but in Divinity I keep the road, and though
not in an implicit, yet in an humble faith, follow the great wheel of the
Church, by which I move; not reserving any proper poles or motion from the
epicycle of my own brain; by this means I leave no gap for Heresies,
Schisms, or Errors, of which at present, I shall injure Truth to say I have no
taint or tincture; I must confess my greener studies have been polluted with
two or three, not any begotten in the latter Cen^uries, but old and obsolete,
such as could never have been revived, but by such extravagant and irregular
heads as mine; for indeed Heresies perish not with their Authors, but like the
River Arethusa, though they lose their currents in one place, they rise up
again in another: one general Council is not able to extirpate one single
Heresy, it may be canceld for the present, but revolution of time and the like
aspects from heaven, will restore it, when it will flourish till it be
condemned again; for as though there were a M^te^p^ucho^is, and the soul of
one man passed into another, opinions do find after-revolutions, men and minds
like those that first begat them. To see our selves we need not look for
Plato's year, every man is not only himself; there have been many Diog^nes,
and as many Timons, though but few of that name; men are lived over again, the
world is now as it was in the age past, there was none then, but there have
been some since that paralels him, and is as it were his revived self. Now
the first of mine was that of the Arabians, that the souls of men perished
with their bodies, but yet should be raised again at the last day; not that I
did absolutely conceive a mortality of the soul; but if that were, which
faith, nor Philosophy can thoroughly disprove, and that both entered the grave
together, yet I hold the same conceit thereof that we all do of the body, that
it shall rise again; surely it is but the merits of our unworthy natures, if
we sleep in darkness until the last alarm. A serious reflex upon my own
unworthines did make me backward from challenging this prerogative unto my
soul: so I might enjoy my Savior at the last, I would with patience be
nothing almost unto eternity. The second was that of the Chiliast, that God
would not persist in his vengeance for ever, but after a definite time of his
wrath he would release the damned souls from torture; which error I fell into
upon a serious contemplation of the great attribute of Gods mercy, and did a
little cherish it in my self, because I found therein no malice, and a ready
weight to sway me from the other extreme of despair, whereunto melancholy and
contem^lative natures are too easily disposed. A ^hird there is which I did
never positively maintain or practice, but have often wished it had been
consonant to Truth, and not offensive to my Religion, and that is the prayer
for the dead, whereunto I was inclined by an excess of charity; whereby I
thought the number of the living too small an object of devotion; I could
scarce contain my prayers for a Friend at the ringing of a Bell, or behold his
corpse without an oration for his Soul: It was a good way me thought to be
remembered by Posterity, and far more noble than a History. These opinions I
never maintained with pertinacy, or endeavored to inveagle any man's belief to
mine, nor so much as ever revealed or disputed them with my dearest friends: by
which means I neither propagated them in others, nor confirmed them in my
self, but suffering them to flame upon their own substances, without addition
of new fuel, they went out insensibly of themselves; therefore those opinions,
though condemned by lawful Councels, were not Heresies in me, but bare Errors,
and single Lapses of my understanding, without a joint depravity of my will:
those have not only depraved understandings, but diseased affections, which
cannot enjoy a singularity without a Heresy, or be the author of an opinion,
without they be of a Sect also; this was the villainy of the first Schism of
Lucifer, who was not content to err alone, but drew into his faction many
Legions of Spirits; and upon this experience he tempted only Eve, as well
understanding the communicable nature of sin, and that to deceive but one, were
tacitly and upon consequence to delude them both. As for the wingy mysteries
in Divinity, and aerie subtilties in Religion, which have ^nhinged the brains
of better heads, they ^ever stretched the P^a Matter of mine; me thinks there be
not impossibilities enough ^n Religion for an active faith; the deepest
mysteries ours contains, have not only been illustrated, but maintained by
syllogism, and the rule of reason: I love to lose my self in a mystery to
pursue my reason to my ob altitudo. It is my solitary recreation to pose my
apprehension with those ^n^olved aenigma's and riddles of the Trini^y,
incarnation and resurrection. I can an^wer all the objections of Satan, and my
re^ellious reason, with that odd resolution I ^earned of Tertullian, Certum
est quia impossi^ile est. I desire to exercise my faith in the difficultest
point, for to credit ordinary and visible objects is not faith, but persuasion.
Some believe the better for seeing Christ his Sep^lchre, and when they have
seen the Red Sea, doubt not of the miracle. Now contrarily I bless my self,
and am thankful that I lived not in the days of miracles, that I never saw
Christ not his Disciples; I would not have been one of those Israelites that
passed the Red Sea, nor one of Christ's Patients, on whom he wrought his
wonders; then had my faith been thrust upon me, nor should I enjoy that
greater blessing pronounced to all that believe and saw not. It Is an easy and
necessary belief to credit what our eye and sense has examined: I believe he
was dead, and buried, and rose again, and desire to see him in his glory,
rather then to contemplate him in his Coenotaphe, or Sepulcher. Nor is this
much to believe as we have reason, we owe this faith unto History: they only
had the advantage o^ a bold and noble faith, who lived before his coming, who
upon obscure prophe^sies and mystical Types could raise a belief, and expect
apparent impossibilities^ It Is true, there is an edge in all firm belief, and
with an easy Metaphor we may say the sword of faith; but in those obscurities
I rather use it, in the adjunct the Apostle gives it, a Buckler; under which I
perceive the wary combitant may lie invulnerable. Since I was of understanding
to know we knew nothing, my reason has been more pliable to the will of
faith; I am now content to understand a mystery without a rigid definition in
an easy and Platonic description. That allegorical description of Hermes
pleases me beyond all the metaphysicall definitions of Divines, where I cannot
satisfy my reason, I leave to hammer my fancy; I had as leive you tell me that
anima est angelus homini^, est Corpus Dei as Entelechia, Lux est umbra Dei, as
actus perspicui: where there is an obscurity too deep for our reason, it is good
to set down with a description a periphrasis, or adumbration; for by
acquainting our reason how unable it is to display the visible and obvious
effect of nature, it becomes more humble and submissive to the subtilties of
faith: and thus I teach my haggard and unreclaimed reason to stoop unto the
lure of faith. I believe there was already a tree whose fruit our unhappy
parents tasted, though in the same Chapter, when God forbids it, it is positively
said, the plants of the field were not yet grown; for God had not caused ^t to
rain upon the earth. I believe that the Serpent (if we shall literally
understand it from his proper form and figure) made his motion on his belly
before the curse: I find the trial of the Pucillage and Virginity of women,
which God ordained the Jews, is very fallible; experience, and History
informs me, that not only many particular women, but likewise whole Nations
have escaped the curse of childebirth, which God seems to pronounce upon the
whole Sex; yet do I bel^eve that all this is true; indeed my reason would
persuade me it is false; and this I think is no vulgar part of faith to
believe a thing not only above, but contrary to reason, and against the
arguments of our proper senses.

In my solitary and retired Imagination, Neque enim cum porticus aut melectulus
accipit, desum mihi; I remember I am not alone and therefore forget not to
contemplate him and his attributes who is ever with me, especially those two
mighty ones, his wisdom and eternity; with the one I recreate, with the other
I confound my understanding: who can speak of eternity without a soloecisme,
or think thereof without an ecstasie? Time we may comprehend, it is but five
days ^lder then our selves, and has the same Horoscop^; but to retire so far
back as to apprehend a beginning* to give such an infinite start forward, as to
conceive an end in an essence that we affirm has neither the one nor the
other; it is reason to Saint Paul's Sanctuary; my Philosophy dares not say the
Apostles can do it; God has not made a creature that can comprehend him; it
is he privilege of his own nature; I am that ^ am, was his own definition
unto Moses; and it was a short one, to con^ound morta^ity, that durst question
God, or ask him that he was; indeed he only is what others have and shall be;
but in eternity no ^istinction of senses; and therefore that ^errible term
Predestination, which has ^roubled so many weak heads to con^eive, and the
wisest to explain, is in respect to God ^o prescious determination of our
estates ^o come, but a definitive blast of his will ^lready fulfilled, and at
the instant that he first decreed it; for to this eternity which ^s
indivisible, the last Tru^pe is already ^ounded, the reprobates in the slam^,
and ^he blessed in Abraham's bosom.

Saint Peter speaks modestly, when he ^aith; a thousand years to God are but
as one day; for to speak I^ke a Philosopher, those continued* instances of
time which ^low into a thousand ye^res, make not to ^im one moment; what to us
is to come, ^o his Eternity is present, his whole dura^ion being but one
permanent point without successions, parts, flux, or division; there is no
Attribute that adds more difficulty to the mystery of the Trinity, where
though in a relative way of Father and Son, we must deny a priority. I wonder
how Aristotle could conceive the world eternal, or how he could make good two
Eternities; his similitude of a Triangle, comprehended in a square, does
somewhat illustrate the Trinity of our souls, and that the Triple Unity of
God; for there is in us not three, but a Trinity of souls, because there is in
us, if not three distinct souls* yet differing faculties, that can, and do
subsist in different subjects; and yet in us are so united as to make but one
soul and substance; if one soul were perfectly three di^stinct bodies, that
were a pretty Trinity conceive the distinct number of three, no^ divided nor
separated by the intellect, bu^ actually comprehended in its Unity, and that is
a perfect Trinity. I have often admired the mystical way of Pythagoras, and the
secret Magic of numbers; Beware o^ Philosophy, is a precept not to be
received in a narrow sense; for in this mass of nature there is a set of
things, that carry in their front, though not in Capital letters, yet in
stenography, and short Characters, something to Divinity, which to wiser rea^ons
serve as Luminaries in the abyss of knowledge, and to judicious belief, as
^scales and roundles to mount the pinnacles and highest pieces of Divinity. The
severe Schools shall never laugh me out of the Philosophy of Hermes, that this
visible world is but a picture of the invisible, wherein as a pourtract, things
are not true^y, but in equivocall shapes; and as they counterfeit some more
real substance in that invisible fabric. That other attribute wherewith I
recreate my devotion, is his wisdom, in which I am happy; and for the
contemplation of this only, do not repent me that I was bred in the way of
study: The advantage I have of the vulgar, with the content and happiness I
conceive therein, is an ample recompense for all my endeavors, in what part of
knowledge soever: I know he is wise in all, wonderful in what we conceive, but
far more in what we comprehend not, for we behold him but a squint upon
reflex or shadow; our understanding is diviner than M^ses his eye, we are
ignorant of the backparts, or lower side of his Divinity; therefore to pry into
the maze of his Counsels, is not only folly in Man, but presumption in Angels,
like as they are his servants, not servators; he holds no Council, but that
mystical one of the Trinity, wherein though there be three persons, there is
but one mind that decrees, without contradiction, nor needs he any; his
actions are not begot with deliberation, his wisdom naturally flowers, what
best; his intellect stands ready fraught with the superlative and purest Idea's
of goodness* consultations and election, which are two motions in us, are but
one in him, his actions springing from his power, at the first touch of his
will.

These are Contemplations Metaphysi^all, my humble speculations have another
Method, and are content to trace and discover those expressions he has left in
his creatures, and the obvious effects of nature, there is no danger to
propound those mysteries, no Sanctum Sanctorum in Philosophy: The world was
made to be inhabited by beasts, but studied and contemplated by man: it is the
debt of our reason we owe to God, and the homage we pay for not being beasts;
without this the world is as though it had not been, or as it was before at the
first, when there was not a creature that could conceive, or say there was a
world. The wisdom of God receives no honor from the vulgar heads, that rudely
stare about, and with a gross rusticity, admire his works; those only
magnify him whose judicious enquiry into his acts, and deliberate* research
into his creatures, return the duty of a learned and devout admiration. There
is but one first, and four second causes of all things; some are without
efficient, as God, others without matter, as Angels, some without form, as the
first matter, but every Essence, created or uncreated, has its final cause,
and some positive end both of its essence and operation: This is the cause I
grope after in the works of nature, on this hangs the providence of God; to
raise so beauteous a structure, as the world and the creatures thereof, was but
his Art, and their sundry divided operations with their predestined ends, are
from the treasury of his wisdom. In the causes, nature, and affection of the
Eclipse of the Sun and Moon, there is most excellent speculation; but to
propound farther, and to contemplate a reason why his providence has so
disposed and ordered their motions in that vast circle, as to conjoyn and
obscure each other, is a sweet piece of reason, and a diviner point of
Philosophy; therefore there appears to me as much divinity in Galen his Book
De usu partium,; as in Suarez Metaphysics: had Aristotle been as curious in
the enquiry of this cause as he was of the other, he had not left behind him an
imperfect p^ece of Philosophy, but an absolute tract of Divinity.

Natura nihil agit frustra, is the only and indisputable axiom in Philosophy,
there is no Grotesco in nature, nor any thing framed to fill up empty cantons,
and unnecessary spaces in the most imperfect creatures, such as were not
preserved in the Arc, but having their seeds and principles in the womb of
nature, are every where, where the power of the Sun is; in those is the wisdom
of his hand discovered: Out of this rank Solomon chose the object of his
admiration; indeed what wisdom may not go to school to the wisdom of Bees,
Aunts, and Spiders? what wise hand teaches them to do what reason cannot
teach us? while ruder heads stand amazed at those prodigious pieces of nature,
as Elephants; Dromedaries, and Camels; these I confess, are the Colossus and
Majesticke pieces of her hand; but in these narrow Engines there is more
curious Mathematickes; and the civility of these little Citizens, more neatly
sets forth the wisdom of their Maker; Who admires not Regio-Montanus his Fly
beyond his Eagle, or wonders not more at the operation of two souls in those
little bodies, than but one in the truncke of a Cedar? I could never content my
contemplation with those general pieces of wonders, the flux and reflux of the
Sea, the increase of Nile, the conversion of the Needle of the North and have
studied to match and parallel those in the more obvious and neglected pieces of
Nature, which without further travel I can do in the Cosmography of my self;
we carry with us the wonders* we seek without us: There is all Africa, and all
her prodigies within us; we are that bold and adventurous piece of nature,
which he that studies wisely, learnes in a compendium, what others labor at in
a divided piece and endless volume. Thus there are two books from whence I
collect my Divinity; besides that written one of God, another of his servant
Nature, that universal and public Manuscript, that lies exposed to the eyes
of all; those that never saw him in the one, have discovered him in the other:
This was the Scripture and Theology of the Heathens; the natural motion of the
Sun made them more admire him, than his supernatural station did the
Children of Israel; the ordinary effect of nature wrought more admiration in
them, than in the other all his miracles: surely the Heathens knew better how
to join and read these mystical letters, than we Christians, who cast a more
common eye on those Hieroglyphics, and disdain to suck Divinity from the
flowers of nature; nor do I forget God, as to adore the name of Nature, which
I define not with the Schools, the principles of motion and rest, but that
straight and regular line, that settled and constant course the wisdom of God
has ordained to guide the actions of his creatures, according to their
several kinds: to make a revolution every day is the nature of the Sun,
because that necessary course which God has ordained it, from which it cannot
swarve, by the faculty of the voice which first did give it motion. Now this
course of Nature God seldom alters or perverts, but like an excellent Artist
has so contrived his work, that with the self same instrument,* without a
new creation, he may effect his obscurest designs. Thus he sweetneth the water
with a wood preserves the creatures in the Ark, which the blast of his mouth
might have as easily created: for God is like a skillful Geometrician, who when
more easily, and with one stroke of his compass, he might describe, or divide
a right line, had yet rather do this in a circle or longer way, according to
the constituted and aforesaid principles of his Art: yet this rule of his he
does sometimes pervert, to acquaint the world with his Prerogative, lest the
arrogance of our reason should question his power, and conclude he could not;
and thus I call the effects of Nature the works of God, whose hand and
instrument she only is; and therefore to ascribe his actions also unto her, is
to devolve the honor of God, the principal agent, upon the instrument; which
if with reason we may do, then let our Hammers rise up, and boast they have
built our houses, and our pens receive the honor of our Writings. I hold there
is a general beauty in the works of God, and therefore no deformity in any
kind or species of creatures whatsoever: I cannot tell by what Logic we call a
Toad, a Bear, or an Elephant, ugly, they being created in those outward shapes
and figures which best express the actions of their internal forms; and
having past that general visitation of God, who saw that all that he had made
was good; that ^s, conformable to his will, which abhors deformity, and is the
rule of order and beauty; there is no deformity but in monstruosity, wherein
notwithstanding there is a kind of beauty, Nature so ingenuously contriving the
irregular parts, as they become sometimes more remarkable than the principle
fabric. To speak yet more narrowly, there was never yet any thing ugly, or
misshapen, but the Chaos, wherein notwithstanding to speak strictly, there was
no deformity; because no form by the voice of God: Now nature is not at
variance with art, nor art with nature; they being both the servants of his
providence: Art is the perfection of nature. Were the world now as it was the
sixth day, there were yet a Chaos: Nature has made one world, and Art another.
In brief, all things are artificial, for nature is the Art of God: This is
the ordinary and open way of his providence, which art and industry have in a
good part discovered, whose effects we may foretell without an Oracle; To
foreshew these is no prophecy, but Prognostication. There is another way full
of Meanders and Labyrinths, whereof the Devil and Spirits have no exact
Ephemerides, and that is a more particular and obscure method of his
providence, directing the operations of individuals and single Essences; this
we call Fortune, that serpentine and crooked line, whereby he draws those
actions that his wisdom intends in a more unknown and secret way; this
cryptick and involved method of his providence have I ever admired* nor can I
relate the history of my life, the occurrences of my days, the escapes of
dangers, and hills of chance with a B^zo los Manos, to Fortune, or a bare
Gramercy to my stars: Abraham might have thought the Ram in the thicket came
thither by accident; humane reason would have said that mere chance conveyed
Moses into the Arc to the sight of Pharaohs daughter; what a Labyrinth is
there in the story of Joseph, able to convert a Stoics? surely there are in
every man's life some rubs and (...) which pass a while under (...), but at the
last, well (...) the mere and of God: It was not a mere chance ^ discover the
or ^owder Treason by a miscarriage of the ^etter. I like the victory of 88 the
better ^r that one occurrence which our ene^ies imputed to our dishonor, and
the ^artiality of Fortune, to wit, the tempests and contrarieties of winds.
King Philip did ^ot detract from the Nation, though he said, he sent his Armado
to fight with men ^ not to combat with the wind. Where ^here is a manifest
disproportion between ^he powers and forces of two several a^ents, upon a
Maxim of reason we may ^romise the victory to the superior; but when
unexpected accidents slip in, and un^hought of occur^ences intervene, these
must proceed from a power that ows no ^bedience to those axioms: where, as in
the writing upon the wall, we behold the hand ^ut see not the spring that moves
it. The ^uccess of that pety Province of Holland, ^ of which the Grand
Seignieur proudly said, That if they should trouble him as ^hey did the
Spaniard, he would send his men with shovels and pickaxes and throw it into the
Sea) I cannot altogether ascribe to the ingenuity and industry of the people
but to the mercy of God, that has dispo^sed them to such a thriving Genius;
and to the will of his providence, that disposet^ her favor to each country
in their pre^ordinate season. All cannot be happy a^ once; because the glory of
one State de^pends upon the ruin of another: ther^ is a revolution and
vicissitude of their greatness, and must obey the swing o^ that wheel, not
moved by their intelli^gences, but by the hand of God, whereby all Estates rise
to their Zenith and vertical^ points, according to their predestined periodss
For the lives not only of men* but of Commonweales, and the whole world, run
not upon an Helix that still enlarges, but on a Circle, where arriving to
their Meridian, they decline in obscurity, and fall under the Horizon again.
These must not therefore be named the effects o^ nature, but in a relative way,
as we term the works of nature. It was the ignorance of man's reason that
begat this very name* and by a careless term miscalled the providence of God:
for there is no liberty For causes to operate in a loose and strag^ing way, nor
any effect whatsoever, but has its warrant from some universal or superior
cause. It is not ridiculous devo^ion, to say a Prayer before a game at Tables;
for even in the sortilegies and matters of the greatest uncertainty, there is a
settled and preordered course of effects; it is we that are blind, and not
fortune: because our eye is too dim to discover the mystery of her effects, we
foolishly paint her blind and hood winkt; that is the providence of Almighty
God. I cannot justify the contemptible Proverb, That fools only are
fortunate; or that insolent Paradox, That a wise man is out of the reach of
fortune; much ^esse those opprobrious Epithets of Poets, Whore, Baud, and
Strumpet: It is I confess the common fate of men, and singular gift of mind,
to be destitute of fortune; which does not any way deject the spirit of wi^er
judgments, who thoroughly understand the justice of this proceeding; and being
en^iched with higher donatives, cast a more careless eye on the vulgar parts
of felicity. It is a most unjust ambition, to desire to ^ngrosse the mercies of
the Almighty, nor to be content with the goods of the mind without a possession
of those of body or fortune* and it is an error worse than heresy, to adore
the complementall and circumstantiall piece of felicity, and undervalue those
perfections and essential points of happiness, wherein we resemble our Maker.
To wiser desires it is satisfaction enough to deserve, though not to enjoy the
favors of fortune; let providence provide for fools: It is not partiality,
but equity in God, who deals with us but as our natural parents: those that
are able of body and mind, he leaves to their deserts; to those of weaker
merits he imparts a larger portion, and pieces out the defect of the one with
the excess of the other. Thus have we no just quarrel with nature, for
leaving us naked, or to envy the horns, hoofes, skins, and furs of other
creatures, being provided with reason, that can supply them all. We need not
labor with so many arguments to confute judicial Astrology; for if there be a
truth therein, it does not injure Divinity; if to be borne under Mercury
disposes us to be witty, under Jupiter to be wealthy, I do not owe a knee
unto these, but unto that merciful hand that has ordered my indifferent and
uncertain nativity unto such ^enevolous aspects. Those that hold that all
things were governed by fortune had not erred, had they not persisted there:
The Romans that erected a Temple to Fortune, acknowledged God therein, though
in a ^lind way, somewhat of Divinity; for in ^ wise man's supputation all things
begi^ and end in the Almighty. There is a nearer way to heaven then Homers
chain; an ea^ie Logic may conjoyn heaven and earth ^n one argument, and with
less then a So^ites resolve all things into God. For though we christen
effects by their most ^ensible and nearest causes, yet it is God ^he true and
infallible cause of all, whose ^oncourse though it be general, yet does ^
subdivide it self into the particular acti^ns of every thing, and is that
spirit, by which each singular essence nor only sub^^^ts, but performs its
operation. The bad construction and perverse comment on those pair of second
causes, or visible hands of God, have perverted the devotion of many unto
Atheism; who forgetting the honest advises of faith, have listened unto the
conspiracy of Passion and Reason. I have therefore always endeavored to
compose those fewds and angry dissentions between affection, faith, and
reason: For there is in our soul a kind of Triumvirate, or triple government
of three competitors, which distract the peace of this our Commonwealth, not
less than did that other the State of Rome.

As Reason is a rebel unto Faith, so Passion unto Reason: As the proportions of
Faith seem absurd to Reason, so the Theorems of Reason unto Passion, and both
unto Reason; yet a moderate and peaceable discretion may so state and order the
matter, that they may be all Kings, and yet make but one Monarchy, every one
exercising his Sovereignty and Prerogative in a due time and place, according
to the restraint and limit of circumstance. There is, as in Philosophy so in
Divinity, sturdy doubts, and boisterous objections, wherewith the unhappiness
of our knowledge too nearely acquainteth us. More of these no man has known
than my self, which I conf^sse I conquered, not in a martial posture, but on
my knees: Neither had these ever such advantage of me, as to incline me to any
desperate points or positions of Atheism; for I have been these many years
of opinion there was never any. Those that held Religion was the difference of
man from beasts, have spoken probably, and proceed upon a proposition as
inductive as the other: That doctrine of Epicur^s, that denied the providence
of God, was no Atheism, but a magnificent and high-strained conceit of his
Majesty, which he deemed too sublime to mind the ^riviall actions of those
inferior creatures: That fatal necessity of Stoics, is nothing ^ut the
immutable Law of his will. Those that heretofore denied the Divinity of the
Holy Ghost, have been condemned but as Heretics; those that now deny our
Savior (though more than Heretics) are not so much as Atheists: for though
they deny two persons in the Trinity, they hold as we do, that there is but one
God.

That villain and secretary of hell, that composed that miscreant piece of the
three Impostors, though divided from all Religions, and was neither Jew, Turk,
nor Christian, was not a positive Atheist. I confess every Country has its
Machiavell, every age its Lucian, whereof common heads must not hear, nor more
advanced judgments too rashly censure on* it is the Rhetoric of Satan, and
may pervert a loose prejudicate belief.

I confess I have perused them all, and can discover nothing that may startle
a discre^t belief; yet are there heads carried off with the wind and breath of
such motives. I remember a Doctor of Physic in Italy, who could not perfectly
believe the immortality of the soul, because Galle^ seemed to make a doubt
thereof. I was familiarly acquainted in France with a Divine, a man of singular
parts, that on the same point was so plunged and gravelled with three lines of
s^neca, that all our an^idotes, drawn from both Scripture and Philosophy,
could not expel the poison of his error. There are a set of heads, that can
credit the relations of Mariners, yet question the restimonies of Saint Paul;
and peremptorily believe the traditions of Aelian or Pliny, yet in the
Histories of Scripture, raise Queries and objections, believing no more than
they can parallel in humane Authors.

I confess there are in Scripture stories that do exceed the fable of Poets,
and to a captious Reader found like Garagantua or Bevis: For search all the
Legends of times past, and the fabulous conceits of the present, and it will be
hard to find one that deserves to carry the buckler unto Sampson, yet is all
this of an easy possibility, if we conceive a divine concourse or influence
but from the little finger of the Almighty. It is impossible that either in the
discourse of man, or in the infallible voice of God, to the weakness of our
apprehensions, there should not appear irregularities, contradictions, and
antinomies: my self can show a catalogue of doubts, never yet imagined nor
questioned, as I know, which are not resolved at the first hearing, not
fantastic Quere's, or objections of the air: For I cannot hear of Atoms in
Divinity. I read the history of the Pigeon that was sent out of the Ark, and
returned no more, yet not question how she found out her ma^e that was left
behind: That Lazarus was raised from the dead, yet not demand where in the
interim his soul awaited; or raise a Law-case, whether his Heir might
lawfully de^aine his inheritance, bequeathed unto him by his death; and he,
though restored to life, have no Plea for his former possessions. Whether Eve
was framed out of the left side of Adam, I dispute not; because I stand not yet
assured which is the right side of a man, or whether there be such distinction
in Nature. Whether Adam was an Hermaphrodite, as the Rabbines comment upon the
letter of the Text; because it is contrary to all reason, that there should be
an Hermaphrodite before there was a woman, or a composition of two natures,
before there was a second composed. Likewise, whether the world was created
(...) Autumn, Summer, or the Spring; because it was created in them all; for
what^oever Sign the Sun possesses, those four ^easons are actually
existent: It is the nature of this Luminary to distinguish the several seasons
of the year, all which it makes at one time in the whole earth, and
successively in any part thereof. There are a bundle of curiosities, not only
in Phi^osophy but in Divinity, proposed and discussed by men of most supposed
abilities, which are not worthy of our vacant hours much less our serious
studies; Pieces only fit to be placed in Pantagrucle Studies, or bound up with
Tartaretus de modo coecandi; these are nice^ies that become not those that
peruse so serious a Mystery. There are others more generally questioned and
called to the Bar, yet me thinks of an ea^ie, possible truth. It is
ridiculous to put off, or drown the general Flood of Noah in that great
particular inundation of Deucalion: that there was a Deluge once, seems not to
me so great a miracle, as that there is not one always. How all the kinds of
Creatures, not only in their own bulks, but with a competency of food and
sustenance, might be preserved in one Ark, and with the extent of three hundred
cubits, to a reason that rightly examines it, will appear very difficult.
There is another secret, not contained in the Scripture, which is more hard to
comprehend, and puts the honest Father to the refuge of a Miracle and that is,
not only how the distinct pieces of the world, and divided I^ands should be
first planted by men, but inhabited by Tigers, Panthers and Bears. How America
abounded with beasts of prey, and noxious Animals, yet contained not in it that
necessary creature, a Horse. By what passage those, not only Birds, but
dangerou^ and ^unwelcome Beasts came over: How thereby creatures are there,
which are not found in the triple Continent; all which must needs be strange
unto us, that hold but one Ark, and that the creatures began progress from the
mountains of Ararat They who to salve this would make the Deluge particular,
proceed upon a principle that I can no way grant; not only upon the negative
of holy Scriptures, but (...) own Reason, whereby I can make ^ probable, that
the world was as well peo^led in the time of Noah as in ours, and fifteen
hundred years to people the world as full a time for them, as four thousand
^eers since has been to us.

There are other assertions and common ^enents drawn from Scripture, and
gene^ally believed as Scripture; whereunto, notwithstanding, I would never
betray the l^^erty of my reason. It is a Paradox to me, that Methuselah was the
longest lived of all ^he children of Adam, and no man will be ^ble to prove it;
when from the process of the Text I can manifest that it is otherwise. That
Judas hanged himself, there (...) no certainty in Scripture, though in one
place it seems to affirm it, and by a doubtful word has given occasion to
translate (...) yet in another place, in a more punctu^l^ description, it makes
it improbable, and ^eemes to overthrow it. That our Fathers, after the Flood,
^rected the Tower of Ba^^ll, to preserve themselves against a second ^eluge, is
generally opinioned and bele^^ed; yet is there another intention of theirs
expressed in Scripture: Besides that, it i^ improbable, from the circumstance
of the place, the plain in the land of Shinar These are no points of Faith,
and therefore may admit a free dispute. There are yet others, and those
familiarly concluded from the Text, wherein (under favor) I see n^
consequence, as, to prove the Trinity from the speech of God, in the plural
number Faciamus hominem, Let us make man, which is but the common style of
Princes, and me^ of Eminency: he that shall read one o^ his Majesty's
Proclamations, may with the same Logic conclude, there be two Kings in
England.

The Church of Rome confidently prove^ the opinion of Tutelary Angels, from
tha^ answer when Peter knocked at the door, (...) is not he but his Angel;
that is to say, hi^ M^ssenger, or some body from him; for so the Original
signifies, and is as likely to be the doubtful Families meaning This
supposition I once suggested to ^ young Divine, that answered upon thi^ point,
to which I remember the Francisca^ Opponent replied no more, but, That (...)
^as a new and no authenticke interpretati^n.

These are but the conclusions and fallible ^iscourses of man upon the word of
God, ^or such I do believe the holy Scriptures; ^et were it of man, I could not
choose butsay ^ was the singularest, and superlative Piece that has been extant
since the Creation; were I a Pagan, I should not refrain the Lecture of it;
and cannot but commend ^he judgment of Ptolomy, that thought the ^lcoran of
the Turks (I speak without ^rejudice) is an ill composed Piece, con^aining in
it vain and ridiculous errors in ^hilosophy, impossibilities, fictions, and
^anities beyond* laughter, maintained by ^vident and open Sophismes, the policy
of Ignorance, deposition of Universities, and banishment of Learning, that has
^otten foot by arms and violence; This without a blow does disseminate it
self ^hrogh the whole earth. It Is not unremark^ble what Philo first observed,
That the Law of M^ses continued two thousand ^eares without the least
alteration; where^s, we see, the Laws of other Commonweales do alter with
occasions; and eve^ those that pretended their original from some Divinity, to
have vanished without trace or memory. I believe, besides Zoroafter, there were
diverse that writ before Moses, who notwithstanding have suffered the common
fa^e of time. Men's Work^ have an age like themselves; and though they outlive
their Authors, yet have a stin^ and period to their duration: This only is a
Work too hard for the teeth of time and cannot perish but in the general^
flames, when all things shall confess their ashes.

I have heard some with deep sighs lam^nt the lost lines of Cicero; others
with as many groans deplore the combustion^ of the Library of Alexandri^; for
my part I think there be too many in the world and could with patience behold
the urne^ and ashes of the Vatican, could I, with ^ few others, recover the
perished leaves o^ Solomon. I would not omit a Copy of E^nochs Pillars, had
they any better Autho^ than Josephus, or did not relish too much of the Fable.
Some men have written more than others have spoken; Pineda ^otes more Authors
in one work, than ^e necessary in a whole world. Of those ^ree great
Inventions in Germany, there ^e two which are not without their in^mmodities,
and it is disputable, whether ^ey exceed not their use and commodies. It is not
a melancholy Utinam of ^ine own, but the desires of better heads, ^^at there
were a general Synod; not to ^^ite the incompatible difference of Reli^ion,
but, for the benefit of learning, to re^uce it as it lay at first in a few and
solid Authors; and to condemn to the fire those swarms and millions of
Rapsodies, ^egotten only to distract and abuse the weaker judgments of
Scholars, and to ^aintaine the Trade and Mystery of Ty^ographers. I cannot but
wonder with what exceptions the Samaritanes could ^on^ine their belief to the
Pentateuch, or five books of Moses. I am ashamed at the Rabbinicall
Interpretation of the Jews, upon the Old Testament, as much as their ^efection
from the New: and truly it is ^eyond wonder, how that contemptibl^ and
degenerate issue of Jacob, that are^^ devoted to Ethnicke Superstition, and
(...) easily seduced to the Idolatry of the Neighbors, should now in such an
obstnate and peremptory belief, adhere unt^ their own Doctrine, expect
impossibilities, and in the face and eye of the Church persist without the
least hope of conver^^ on: This is a vice in them, that were a virtue in us;
for obstinacy in a bad cause, (...) but constancy in a good. And herein must
accuse those of our Religion; for ther^ is not any of such a fugitive faith,
such a^ unstable belief, as a Christian; none tha^ do so often transform
themselves, not unto several shapes of Christianity and o^ the same Species,
but unto more unnatural and contrary forms, of Jew and Mohammedan, that from
the name of Saviou^ can conde^cend to the bare term of Prophet; and from an
old belief that he is come, to fall to a new expectation of his coming: It is
the promise of Christ to make us all one flock; but how and when the union
shall be, is as obscure to me as the last day. Of those four members of
Religion we hold a proportion, there are I confess some new additions, yet
small, to those which accrue to our Adversaries, and those only drawn from the
revolt of Pagans, men but of negative impieties, and such as deny Christ, but
because they never heard of him: But the Religion of the ^ew is expressly
against the Christian, and ^he Mohammedan against both; for the Turk, ^n the
bulk he now stands, he is beyond ^ll hope of conversion; if he fall asunder
^here may be conceived some hopes, but ^ot without strong improbabilities. The
^ew is obstinate in all fortunes; the perse^ution of fifteen hundred years
has but ^onfirmed them in their error: they have ^lready endured what soever
may be in^licted, and have suffered in a bad cause, ^ven to the condemnation of
their ene^ies. Persecution is a bad and indirect way ^o plant Religion; It has
been the un^appy method of angry devotions, not on^y to confirm honest
Religion, but wick^d Heresies, and extravagant Opinions. It was the first stone
and Bafis of our Faith, ^one can more justly boast of persecutions and glory in
the number and valor of Martyrs; for, to speak properly, those are true and
only examples of fortitude: Those that fetch it from the Field, or draw it from
the actions of the Camp, are not (...) truly presidents of valor and
audacity and at the best attain but to some bastard piece of fortitude. If we
shall strictly examine the circumstances and requisites which Aristotle
requires to true and perfect valor, we shall find the name only in his Master
Alexander, and as little in the Roman Worthy, Julius Caesar; and if any, (...)
that easy and active way, have done so nobly as to deserve that name, yet in
the passive and more terrible piece those have surpassed, and in a more
heroical way may claim the honor of that Title. It is not in the power of
every honest faith to proceed thus far, or pass to Heaven through the flames;
every one has it not in the ful^ measure, nor in so audacious and resolute a
temper, as to endure those terrible test^ and trials, who notwithstanding in a
peaceable way do truly adore their Savior, and have (no doubt) a Faith
acceptable in the eyes of God: Now as all that dye in war are not termed
Soldiers, so neither can I ^roperly term all those that suffer in mat^ers of
Religion Martyrs. The Council of Constance condemns John Husse for an
Heretic, the Stories of his own party ^ile him a Martyr; it is false
Divinity if I ^ay he was neither one nor other: there are ^any (questionless)
canonized on earth, that shall never be Saints in Heaven; and ^ave their names
in Histories and Marty^ologies, who in the eyes of God are not ^o perfect
Martyrs as was that wise Heaven, Socrates, that suffered on a fundamen^all
point of Religion, the unity of God, have pityed the miserable Bishop that
^uffered in the cause of Antipodes, yet cannot choose but accuse him of as much
madness, for exposing his life on such a trifle, ^s those of ignorance and
folly that con^emned him. I think my cons^^ence will ^ot give me the lie, if I
say, there is not a ^an extant that in a noble way fears the ace of death
less than my self, yet from ^^e moral duty I owe to the Commande^ent of God,
and the natural respects that I tender unto the conservation of my essence and
being, I would not perish upon a Ceremony, Politic points, or indifferency:
nor is my belief of that untractable temper, as not to bow at their obstacles,
or connive at matters that are not manifest impieties: The leaven therefore and
ferment of all, not only civil, but Religious actions, is wisdom; without
which, to commit our selves to the flames is Homicide, and (I fear) but to
pass through one fire into another. That Miracles are ceased I can neither
prove, nor absolutely deny, much less define the time and period of their
cessation; that they survived Christ, is manifest upon record of Scripture;
that they outlived the Apostles also, and were revived at the conversion of
Nations, many years after, we cannot deny, if we shall not question those
Writers whose testimonies we do not controvert, in points that make for our
own opinions; therefore that may have some truth in it that is reported by the
Jesuits, of their Miracles in the Indies, I could wish it were true, or had any
other testimony then their own pens: they may easily believe those Miracles
abroad, who daily conceive greater at home; the transinutation of those visible
elements into the visible body and blood of our Savior: for the conversion of
water into wine, which he wrought in Can^, or what the devil would ^ave had him
done in the wilderness, of stones into Bread, compared to this, scarce
deserves the name of Miracle: Though ^ndeed, to speak properly, there is not
one Miracle greater than another, they being the extraordinary effect of the
hand of God, to which all things are of an equal facility; and to create the
world as easily as one single creature. For this is also a miracle, not only to
produce effects against or above Nature, but before Nature; and to create
Nature as great a miracle as to contradict or transcend her; We do too
^arrowly define the power of God, restraining it to our capacities. I hold that
God cannot do all things but sin; how he could work contradictions I do not
understand, yet dare not therefore deny. I cannot see why the Angels of God
should question Esdras to recall the time past, if it were beyond his own
power; or that God should pose mortality in that, which ^e was not able to
perform himself. I will not say, God cannot, but he will not perform many
things, which we plainly affirm he cannot: this I am sure is the mannerliest
proposition, wherein notwithstanding I hold no Paradox. For strictly his power
is the same with his will, and they both with all the rest do make but one God.

But above all things, I wonder how the curiosity of wiser heads could pass
that great and indisputable miracle, the cessation of Oracles: and in what
swoun their reasons lay, to content themselves, and sit down with such
far-fetch't and ridiculous reasons as Plutarch alleges for it. The Jews that
can believe the supernatural solstice of the Sun in the days of Ioshuah have
yet the impudence to deny the Eclipse, which every Pagan confessed at their
death: but for this it is evidentt beyond all contradiction, the Devil
himself confessed it. Certainly it is not a warrantable curiosity, to examine
the verity of Scripture by the concordance of humane history, or ^eeke to
confirm the Chronicle of Hester or Daniel, by the authority of Megasthenes or
Herodotus: I confess I have had an unhappy curiosity this way, till I laughed
my self out of it with a piece of Iustine, where he delivers that the children
of Israel for being scabbed were banished out of Egypt. And truly since I have
understood the occurrences of the world, and know in what counterfeit shapes
and deceitful vizzards the time represents on the stage things past I do
believe them little more then things to come. Some have been of opinion, and
endeavored to write the History of their own lives; wherein Moses has
out-gone them all, and left not only the story of his life, but of his death
also. It is a riddle to me, how this story of Oracles has not worm'd out of
the world that doubtful conceit of Spirits and Witches; how so many learned
heads should so far forget the Metaphysics, and destroy the Ladder and scale
of creatures, as to question the existence of Spirits: for my part I have ever
believed, and do now know, that there are Witches; they that doubt of these do
not only deny them, but Spirits; and are obliquely, not consequently, a sort,
not of Infidels, but Atheists.

Those that to confute their incredulity desire to see apparition, shall
questionless never behold any, nor have the power ever to be so much as
Witches; the Devil has them already in a heresy as capital^ as Witchcraft,
and to appear to them, were but to convert them: Of all the delusions
wherewith he deceives mortality there is not any that puzleth me more the^ the
Legerdemaine of Changeilng; I do no^ credit those transformations of
reasonable creatures into beasts, or that the Devil^ has the power to
transplant a man into ^ horse, who tempted Christ (as a trial of his Divinity)
to convert stones into bread I could believe that Spirits use with man the act
of carnality, and that in both sexes^ I conceive they may assume, steal, or
contrive a body wherein there may be action enough to content d^crepit lust,
or passion to satisfy more active veneries; yet in both without a possibility
of generation: and therefore that opinion, that Antichrist should be borne of
the Tribe of Dan by conjunction with the Devil, is ridiculous, and a conceit
fitter for the Rabbis then Christians.

I hold that the Devil does really possess some men, the spirit of melancholy
others, the Spirit of delusion others; that as the Devil is concealed and
deemed by some, so God and good Angels are pretended by others, whereof the
late defection of the Maid of Germany has left pregnant example. Again, I
believe that all that use sorceries, incantations, and spells, are not Witches,
or as we term them, Magicians; I conceive there is a traditionall Magic, not
learned immediately from the Devil, but at second hand from his Scholars;
(...) having once his secret betrayed, are able, and do empirically practice
without his advice, they both proceeding upon the principles of nature: their
actives actively conjoined to disposed passives, will under any Master produce
their effects. Thus I think at first a great part of Philosophy was
Witchcraft, which b^ing afterward derived to another, proved but Philosophy,
and was indeed n^^ ^ore but the honest effects of Nature: W^^at invented by us
is Philosophy, learn^^ from him is Magic. We do surely ^we the discovery of
many secrets to the discovery of good and bad angels. I could never pass that
sentence of Paracelsus without an asteriske or annotation; Acce^dens
constellatum multa revelat quaerentibus animalia naturae, i. e. opera Dei. I do
think that many mysteries ascribed to our own inventions, have been the
courteous revelation of Spirits; for those noble essences in heaven bear a
friendly regard unto their fellow^natures on earth; and therefore believe that
those many prodigies and ominous prognostics which fore-run the ruins of
States, Princes, and private persons, are the charitable premonitions of good
Angels, which more careless enquiries term but the effects of chance and
nature. Now besides these particular and divided Spirits, there may be (for
ought I know) an universal common Spirit to ^he whole world. It was the
opinion of Plato, and it is yet the Hermeticall Philosophers; if there be a
common nature that ^^nties and ties the scattered and divided individuals into
one species, why may there not be one that unites them all? However, I am sure
there is a common spirit that plays within us, yet makes no part of us, and
that is the Spirit of God, and scintillation of the noble and mighty Essence,
which is the life and radical heat of spirits; and those essences that know
not the virtue of the Suns fire, qu^te contrary to the fire of Hell: This is
the gentle heat that brooded on the waters, and in six days hatched the
world; this is that irradiation that dispels the mists of Hell, the clouds of
horror, fear, sorrow, and despair; and preserves the region of the mind in
serenity: whatsoever feels not the wa^me gale and gentle ventilation of this
Spirit (though I feel his pulse) I dare not say he lives; for truly without
this, to me, there is no heat under the Tropic; nor any light, though I dwell
in the body of the Sun.

As when the laboring Sun has wrought his tracke
Up to the top of lofty Cancers back,
The Icie Ocean cracks, the frozen pole
Thawes with the heat of the Celestial coal;
So when the absent beams begin to impart
Again a Solstice on my frozen heart,
My Winter's over, my drooping spirits sing,
And every part revives into a Spring.
But if thy quickening beams a while decline,
And with their light bless not this Orb of mine,
A chilly frost surprizeth every member,
And in the midst of June I feel December.
Keep still in my Horizon, for to me,
It Is not the Sun that makes the day, but thee.
O how this earthly temper does debase
The noble Soul, in this her heavenly place!
Whose win^y nature ever does aspire,
To reach the place whence first it took its fire.
Those flames, I feel, which in my heart do dwe'l,
Are not thy beams, but take their fire from Hell:
O quench them all, and let thy light divine
Be as the Sun to this poor Orb of mine:
And to thy sacred Spirit convert those fires,
Whose earthy fumes choke my devout aspires.
Therefore for Spirits I am so far from denying their existence, that I could
easily believe, that not only whole Countries, but particular persons have
their Tutelary, and Guardian Angels: It is not a new ^pinion of the Church of
Rome, but of Py^^agoras and Plato; there is no heresy in (...), and if not
manifestly defined in Scripture, yet is an opinion of a good and ^holesome use
in the course and actions ^f a man's life, and would seem as an Hy^othesis to
salve many doubts, whereof ^ommon Philosophy affords no resolu^^on: Now if
you demand my opinion and Metaphysickes of their natures, I con^esse them very
shallow, most of them in a ^egative way, like that of God; or in a ^omparative,
between our selves and fel^ow creatures; for there is in this Universe (...)
Staire, or manifest Scale of creatures, ri^ing not disorderly, or in a
confusion, but with a comely method and proportion: ^etweene creatures of mere
existence and things of life, there is a large disproportion of nature;
between two plant-animals or creatures of sense, a wider diffe^ence; between
them and man, a far greater: and if the proportion hold on, ^etweene manand
Angels there should be ^et a greater.

We do not comprehend their natures who retain the first definition of
Porphiry, and distinguish them from our selves by immortality; for before his
fall, man also was immortal; yet must we needs affirm that he had a
different essence from the Angels: having therefore no certain knowledge of
their natures. it is no bad method of the Schools, whatsoever perfection we
find obscurely in our selves, in a more complete and absolute way to ascribe
unto them. I believe they have an extemporary knowledge, and upon the first
motion of their reason do what we cannot without study or deliberation; they
know things by their forms, and define by specificall difference, what we
describe by accidents and properties; and therefore probabilities to us may be
demonstrations unto them; that they have knowledge no^ only of the
specificall, but numericall forms of ^ndividuals, and understand by what
reserved difference each single Hypostasis (besides the relation to its
species) becomes its natural self.

That as the Soul has a power to move ^^e body it informs, so there is a
Faculty (...) move any, though inform none; ours upon restraint of time,
place, and distance.

But that invisible hand that conveyed ^abakkuk to the Lions den, or Philip to
^zotus, infringeth this rule, and has a ^e^ret conveyance, wherewith mortality
is ^ot aquainted; if they have that intui^ive ^nowledge, whereby as in
reflection they ^ehold the thoughts of one another, I cannot peremptorily deny
but they know a ^reat part of ours. They that to refute the ^nvocation of
Saints, have deemed that ^hey know not our affairs below, have ^roceeded too
far, and must pardon my ^pinion, till I can truly answer that piece ^f
Scripture, At the conversion of a sinner all ^he Angels of heaven rejoice. I
cannot with that great Father securely interpret the ^orke of the first day,
Fiat lux, to the cre^tion of Angels, though (I confess) there ^s not any
creature that has so near a ^lympse of their nature, as light in the ^unne
and Elements, while we style a bare ^ccident, but where it subsists alone, a
spi^tuall Substance, and may be an Angel: in brief, conceive light invisible,
and that i^ a Spirit, those are certainly the Magisteriall and masterpieces
of the Creature the Flower (or as we may say) the best part of nothing actually
existing what we are but in hopes, and probabilities we are only the amphibious
piece betwee^ a corporal and spiritual essence, that middle form that linkes
those two together and makes good the method of God and nature, that jumps not
from extremes, bu^ unites the incompatible distances by some middle and
participating natures; that w^ are the breath and similitude of God, it i^
indisputable, and upon record of holy Scripture, but to call our selves a
Microcosme* or little world, I thought it only a pleasan^ trope of Rhetoric,
till my near judgment and second thoughts told me there was ^ real truth
therein: for first we are a rud^ mass, and in the rank of creatures, which
only are, and have a dull kind of being not yet privileged with life, or
preferre^ to sense or reason; next we live the life o^ plan^s, the life of
animals, the life of men and at last the life of spirits, running on i^ ^ne
mysterious nature: those five kinds of ^xistences which comprehend the
crea^ures not only of the world, but of the Universe; this is man the great
and true Amphibium, whose nature is disposed to ^ive not only like other
creatures in diverse ^lements, but in divided and distinguished worlds; for
though there be but one to sens^, ^here are two to reason; the one visible, the
other invisible, whereof Moses seems to ^ave left description, and of the
other so obscurely, that some parts thereof are yet (...) controversy; and
truly for the last chap^er of Genesis, I must confess a great deal of
obscurity, though Divines have to the ^ower of humane reason endeavored to
make all go in a literal meaning, yet those allegorical interpretations are
also ^robable, and perhaps the mystical method of Moses bred up in the
Hieroglyphicall Schools of the Egyptians.

Now for the immaterial world me thinks we need not wander so far as the
first moveable, for even in this material fabric ^he spirits walk as freely
exempt from the ^ffection of time, place, and motion, as beyond the extremest
circumference: do^ but extract from the corpulency of bodies or resolve things
beyond their first matter and you discover the habitation of Angels, which if I
call the ubiquitary, and omnipresent essence of God, I hope I sha^^ not offend
Divinity; for before the Creation of the world God was really al^ things. For
the Angels he created no ne^ world, or determinate mansion, and therefore they
are every where, where his essence is, and do live at a distance even i^
himself: that God made all things for man, is in some sens^ true, yet not so
farr^ as to subordinate the creation of those pu^rer creatures to ours, though
as ministring^ spirits they do, and are willing to fulfil^ the will of God in
these lower and sublu^nary affairs of man; God made all things for himself,
and it is impossible he should make them for any other end then hi^ own glory;
it is all he can receive, and al^ that is without himself, for honor being an
external adjunct, and in the hono^er, rather then in the person honored,
(...) was necessary to make a creature, from whom he might receive this
homage, and that is in the other world Angels, in this it is man, which when we
neglect we forget the very end of our creation, and may justly provoke God,
not only to repent that he has made ^he world, but that he has sworn that
he would not destroy it. That ^here is but one world, is a conclusion of Faith.
Aristotle with all his Philosophy has not been able to prove it; and as
weakly that the world was eternal; that dispute much troubled the pen of the
ancient Philosophers, but Moses decided that question, and salved all with a
new term of creation, a production of something out of nothing, and that is
whatsoever is opposite to something more exactly, that which is truly contrary
unto God, for he ^^nely is, all other have an existence, with depending, and
are something but by di^tinction.

The whole Creation is a mystery, and ^articularly that of man, at the blast of
his mouth were the rest of the creatures made and at his bare word they started
out of nothing: but in the frame of man (as the Text describes it) he played
the sensible operator, and seemed not so much to create, as make him; when he
had separated the materials of other creatures, there consequently resulted a
form and soul, but having raised the walls of man, he was driven to a second
and harder creation of a substance like himself, an incorruptible and
immortal soul. For the two asser^ions we have in Philosophy, and opinion of
the Heathens, the flat affirmative of Plato, and not a negative from Aristotle:
there is another scruple cast in by Divinity (concerning its production) much
disputed in the Germane auditories, and with that indifferency and equality of
arguments, as leave the controversies undetermined.

I am not of Paracelsus mind, that boldly delivers a receipt to make a man
without conjunction, yet cannot but wonder at the multitude of heads that do
deny traduction, having no other argument to confirm their belief, then that
Rhetorical^ sentence, and Antanaclasis of Augustine, cre^ando infunditur,
infundendo creatur, either opinion will stand well enough with religion, yet I
should rather incline to this, did not one objection haunt me, not wrung from
speculations and subtilties, but from common sense, and observation, not picked
from the leaves of any other, but bred amongst the weeds and tares of mine own
brain. And this is a conclusion from the equivocall and monstrous production
in the copulation of man with beast; for if the soul of man be not transmitted
and transfused in the seed of the parents; why are not those productions
merely beasts, but have also an impressure and tincture of reason in as high
measure as it may demonstrate it self in those improper organs? nor truly can
I reasonably deny, that the soul in this her sublunary estate, is wholly
inorganicall, but that for the performance of her ordinary actions, is required
not only a symmetry and proper disposition of Organs, but a Crasis and temper
correspondent to its operation; yet is not this mass of flesh and visible
structure the instrument and proper corpse of the soul, but rather of sense,
and that the nearer Ubi of reason. In our study of Anatomy there is a mass of
mysterious Philosophy, and such as reduced the very Heathens to Divinity; yet
amongst all those rare discoveries, and curious pieces, I find in the fabric
of man, I do not so much content my self, as in that I find not any proper
Organ or instrument for the rational soul; for in the Brain, which we term
the seat of Reason, there is not any thing of moment more then I can discover
in the crany of a beast. Thus we are men, and we know not how, there is
something in us, that can be without us, and will be after us, though it is
strange that it has no history, what it was before us, nor cannot tell how it
entered in us.

Now for the walls of flesh, wherein the soul does seem to be immured before
the restoration, it is nothing but an elementall composition, and a fabric
that may fall to ashes; All flesh is grass, is not only metaphorically, but
literally true, for all those creatures we behold, are but the herbs of the
field, digested into flesh ^n them, or more remotely carnified in our selves.
Nay further, we are what we ^ll abhor, Anthropophagi and Cannibals, devourers
not only of men, but of our ^elves; and that not in an allegory, but a
^ositive truth; for all this mass of flesh which we behold, came in at our
mouths: ^his frame we look upon, has been upon our trenchers. In brief, we
have de^oured our selves. I cannot believe that wisdom of Pythagoras did ever
positively, and in a literal sense, affirm his Metem^suchosis, or impossible
transmigrations of ^he souls of men into beasts: of all Metamorphoses or
transmigrations, I believe ^nely one, that is of Lots wife, for that of
Nebuchadnezzar proceeded not so far; ^n all others I conceive there is no
further ^erity then is contained in their implicit ^ense and morality: I
believe that the whole frame of a beast does perish, and is ^eft in the same
state after death, as before ^t was materialled unto life; that the sou^^^ of
men know neither contrary nor (...) ^ruption, that they subsist beyond (...),
and outlive death by the (...) their proper natures, and without a miracle;
that the souls of the faithful, as they leave earth, take possession of
Heaven: tha^ those apparitious, and ghosts of departed persons are not the
wandering souls o^ men, but the unquiet walks of Devils^ prompting and
suggesting us unto mischief, blood, and villainy, instilling and stealing into
our hearts; that the blessed spirits are not at rest in their graves, bu^
wander solicitous of the affairs of the world; that those phantasmes appear
often, and do frequent Cemiteries, Charnell houses, and Churches, it is
because those are the dormitories of the dead, where the Devil like an
insolent Champion holds with pride the spoils and Trophies of his victory in
Adam.

This is the dismal conquest we all deplore, that makes us often cry, O Adam
quid fecisti? I thank God I have not those strait ligaments, or narrow
obligations to the world, as to dote on life, or be convulst and tremble at the
name of death. Not that I am insensible of the dread and horror thereof, or by
raking into the bow^ls of the deceased, continual sight of Anatomies,
Skeletons, or Cadaverous relics, like Vespilloes, or Grave-makers, I am
become stupid, or have forgot the apprehension of mortality, but that
marshalling of the horrors, and contemplating the extremities thereof, I find
not any therein able to daunt the courage of a man much less a resolved
Christian, and therefore am not angry at the error of our first parents, or
unwilling to bear a part of this common fate; and like the best of them to
dye, that is, to cease to breathe; to take a farewell of the elements, to be a
kind of nothing for a moment, to be within one instant a spirit: When I take a
full view and circle of my self, but with this reasonable moderator, and
equal piece of justice, death, I do conceive my self the miserablest person
extant, were there not another life that I hope for, all the vanities of the
world should not entreat a moments breath from me; could the Devil work my
belief to imagine I could never die, I would not outlive that very thought, I
have so abject a thought of this common way of existence, this retaining to the
Sun and elements, I cannot think this to be a man, or to live according to the
dignity of my nature, in expectation of a better; I can with patience embrace
this life, yet in my best meditations do often desire death, I honor any man
that contemnes it, nor can I love any that is afraid of it; this makes me
naturally love a Soldier, and honor those tattered and contemptible Regiments
that will dye at the command of a Sergeant. For a Pagan there may be some
motives to be in love with life, but for a Christian to be amazed at death, I
see not how he can escape this Dilemma, that he is too sensible of this life,
or careless of the life to come.

Some Divines count Adam 30. years old at his creation, because they suppose
him created in the perfect age and stature of man; and surely we are all out of
the computation of our age, every man is some months elder then he bethinkes
him; for we live, move, and have a being, and are subject to the actions of the
elements, and the malice of diseases in that other world, the ^ruest
Microcosme, the womb of our mo^her: for besides that general and common
existence that we are conceived in our Chaos, and whilst we sleep within ^he
bosom of our causes, we enjoy a being and life in three distinct worlds,
wherein we receive most manifest gradations: In that obscure world and womb of
our mo^her, our time is short, computed by the Moon; yet longer then the days
of ma^y creatures that behold the Sun, our ^elves being not yet without life,
sense, and reason; the manifestation of its actions, it awaits the opportunity
of ob^ects; and seems to live there but in its ^oote and soul of vegetation,
entering af^erwards upon the scene of the world, we ^rise up and become another
creature, performing the reasonable actions of man, and obscurely manifesting
that part of Divinity in use, but not in complement and perfection, till we
have once more cast our secondine, that is, this flough of flesh, and are
delivered into the last world, that ^s, that ineffable place of Saint Paul,
that ^bi of spirits. The smattering that I have of the Philosophers stone,
which is nothing else but the perfectest exaltation o^ gold, has taught me a
great deal of Divinity, and instructed my belief, how tha^ immortal spirit
and incorruptible substance of my soul may lie obscure, and sleep within this
house of flesh. Thos^ strange and mystical transmigrations tha^ I have
observed in Silkewormes, turned my Philosophy into Divinity. There is i^ these
works of nature, which seem to puzzle reason, something Divine, and hat^ more
in it then the eye of a common spectator does discover. I am naturally
bashful, nor has conversation, age, or travel, been able to effront or
harden me yet I have one part of modesty, which I have seldom discovered in
another that is, to speak truly. I am not s^ much afraid of death, as ashamed
thereof to the very disgrace and ignominy of ou^ natures, that in a moment can
so disfigur^ us that our nearest friends, Wife, and Children stand afraid and
stare at us. The Birds and Beasts of the field that before i^ a natural fear
obeyed us, forgetting allegiance begin to prey upon us; this very ^nceit has
in a tempest disposed and left ^e wisling to be swallowed up in the a^ysse of
waters, wherein I had perished, ^s^ene, unpityed, without wondering eyes, ^ares
of pity, Lectures of mortality, and one had said, Quantum mutatus ab illo! ^ot
that I am ashamed of the Anatomy ^f my parts, or can accuse nature for play^^g
the bungler in any part of me, or my ^wne vicious life for contracting any
^^amefull disease upon me, whereby I ^ight not call my self as wholesome a
^orsell for the worms as any. Some upon the courage of fruitful issue,
wherein, ^s in the truest Chronicle, they seem to ^utlive themselves, can with
greater pati^nce away with death. This conceit and ^ounterfeit subsisting in
our progenies ^eemes to me a mere fallacy, unworthy ^he desir^s of a man, that
can but con^eive a thought of the next world; who, ^n a noble ambition, should
desire to live ^n his substance in Heaven. And therefore at my death I mean to
take a Total ^diew of the world, not caring for a Monument, History, or
Epitaph, not so much as the bare memory of my name to b^ found any where but in
the universal Register of God: I am not yet so Cynicall, a^ to approve the
Testament of Diogenes, no^ do altogether allow that Rodomantado o^ Lucian.

-- Coelo tegitur, qui non habet urnam.
He that unburied lies, wants not a Hearse,
For unto him a tombe's the universe.
But commend in my calmer judgment those ingenuous intentions that desire to
sleep by the urnes of their Fathers, an^ strive to go the nearest way unto
corruption. I do not envy the temper of Crows* nor the numerous and weary
days of ou^ Fathers before the Flood. If their be any truth in Astrology, I
may outlive a Jubilee, as yet I have not seen one revolution o^ Saturn, nor
have my pulse beat thirty years, and excepting one, have seen the ashes, and
left under ground, all the King^ of Europe, have been contemporary to three
Emperors, four Grand Signiours* and as many Popes; me thinks I have
outlived my self, and begin to be weary of the same, I have shaken hands with
de^ight in warm blood and Canicular days, ^ perceive I do participate the
vices of ^ge, the world to me is but a dream, or mock-show, and we all therein
but Pan^alones or Antickes to my severer con^emplation.

It is not, I confess, an unlawful Pray^r to desire to surpass the days of
our Savior, or wish to outlive that age wherein he thought fittest to dye,
yet, if (as Divinity affirms) there shall be no gray hairs in Heaven, but all
shall rise in ^he perfect state of men, we do but out^ive those perfections in
this world, to be ^ecalled by them, by a greater miracle in ^he next, and run
on here but to retrograde hereafter. Were there any hopes to out^ive vice, or a
point to be super-annated from sin, it were worthy on our knees to ^mplore the
age of Methuselah. But age does not rectify, but incurvate our natures,
^urning bad dispositions into worser ha^its, and (like diseases) bring on
incura^le vices; for every day, as we grow weak ^n age, we grow strong in
sin, and the number of our days does but make o^^ sins innumerable. The
same vice committed at sixteen, is not the same, thoug^ it agree in all other
circumstances, at forty but swells and doubles from the circumstance of our
ages, wherein besides the constant and inexcusable habit of transgressing, it
has the maturity of our Judgment to cut off pretense unto excuse o^ pardon:
every sin, the oftener it is committed the more it acquireth in the quality of
evil; as it succeeds in times, so it proceeds into degrees of badnesse, for as
they proceed they ever multiply, and like figure^ in Arithmeticke, the last
stands for more then all that went before it: the course an^ order of my life,
would be a very death to^ others: I use my self to all dyets, humours^ airs,
hunger, th^rst, cold, heat, want plenty, necessity, dangers, hazards; when I am
cold, I cure not my self by heat when sick, not by physic, those tha^ know
how I live, may justly say, I regar^ not life, nor stand in fear of death; I
am much taken with two verses of Lucan, sinc^ I have been able not only as we
do a^ School, to construe, but understand it: Victurosque Dei celant ut
vivere durent, Felix essemori.
So are we all deluded, vainly searching ways,
To make us happy by the length of days,
For cunningly it makes protract the breath
The Gods conceal the happiness of Death.


There be many excellent strains in that Poet, wherewith his Stoicall Genius
^ath liberally supplied him; and truly ^here are singular pieces of Philosophy
of Zeno, and doctrine of the Stoickes, which I perceive, delivered in a Pulpit,
pass for current Divinity, yet herein are they ex^reame that can allow a man
to be his own Assassine, and so highly extol the end of Cato, this is indeed
not to fear death, but ^et to be afraid of life. It is a brave act of ^alour
to contemn death, but where life ^s more terrible then death, it is then the
^ruest valor to dare to live, and herein Religion has taught us a noble
example: For all the valiant acts of Curtius Sc^vola* or Godrus* do not
parallel or match tha^ one of Job; and sure there is no torture to the rack of
a disease, nor any Poneyar^ in death it self like those in the way o^ prologue
unto it.

Emorinolo, sed me esse mortuum nihil curo^ I would not dye, but care not to be
dead Were I of Caesar's Religion I should be o^ his desires, and wish rather to
be torture^ at one blow, then to be sawed in pieces by the grating torture of a
disease. Now be^sides this literal positive kind of death there are others
whereof Divines mak^ mention, and those I think, not merely Metaphorical, as
Mortification, dyin^ unto sin and the world; therefore I say every man has a
double Horoscope, on^ of his Humanity, his birth; another o^ his Christianity,
his baptism, and from this do I compute or calculate my Nativity, yet
not-reckoning of those Horae com^ bustae, and odd days, or esteeming my self
any thing, before I was my Saviors and enrolled in the Register of Christ
whosoever enjoyes not this life, I coun^ him but an apparition, though he wear^
^^out him the sensible affection of the ^^sh.

In those moral acceptions, the way be immortal is to dye daily, nor can
^hinke that I have the true Theory of ^^ath, when I contemplate a skull, or
^^hold a Skeleton, which those vulgar ^aginations cast upon it; I have
there^^re enlarged that common Memento ^ori, into a more Christian memoran^m,
Memento quatuor novissima, those ^ure inevitable points of us all, Death,
judgment, Heaven, and Hell. Neither ^d the contemplations of the Heathens ^st
in their graves, without a further ^ought of Radamanth or some judicial
^^oceeding after death, but in another ^ay, and upon suggestion of their
natu^ll reasons. I cannot but marvel from that Sibyll or Oracle they stole
the pro^hesie of the worlds destruct on by fire, ^r whence Lucan learned to
say, ^omunis mundo superest rogus, ossibus astr^ Misturus. --

Wherein our bones with stars shall make one pire.


I believe the world grows near it^ end, and yet is neither old nor decayed
nor will ever perish upon the ruins o^ its own principles. As the work o^
Creation was above nature, so its ad^versary, annihilation, without which the
world has not its end. Now wha^ force should be able to consume it, thu^ far
without the breath of God, which is the truest consuming flame my Philosophy
can inform me? I believe tha^ there went not a minute to the world creation,
nor shall there go to its de^struction; Those fix days so punctually
described, make not to me one moment, but rather seem to manifest the method
and Idea of the great work o^ the intellect of God, then the manne^ how he
proceeded in its operation. ^ cannot dream that there should be a^ the last
day any Judicial proceeding, o^ calling to the Bar, as indeed the Scripture
seems to imply, and the litera^ ^ommentators do conceive: for un^eakeable
mysteries in the Scriptures ^e often delivered in a vulgar and illu^rative way,
and being written unto ^an, are delivered, not as they truly ^e, but as they
may be understood, ^herein notwithstanding the different ^terpretations
according to different ^^pacities they may stand firm with ^ur devotion, nor
be any way prejudi^all to each single edification. Now to ^etermine the day and
year of this invitable time, is not only convincible and statute madness,
but also manifest ^npiety; How shall we interpret Elias ^000. years, or
imagine the secret ^ommunicated to the Rabbi, which God has denied to his
Angels?

It had been an excellent quaere, to ^ave posed the devil of Delphos, and
^ust needs have forced him to some ^range amphibology; it has not only
^^ocked the predictions of sundry A^^rologers in ages past, but the Philoso^hy
of many melancholy heads, in the ^resent, who neither understanding reasonable
things past, nor present, pretend a knowledge of things to com^ heads ordained
only to manifest the incredible effects of melancholy, an^ to fulfill old
prophesies, rather then b^ ^uthour of new.

[In those days there shall come wa^ and rumors of wars] to me seems n^
prophecy, but a constant truth, in a^ times verifyed since it was first
pro^nounced: There shall be signs in the Moon and Stars, how comes he the^
like a thief in the night, when he give an item of his coming? That common
sign drawn from the revelation of An^ tichrist, the Philosophers stone in
Divi^ity, for the discovery and inventio^ whereof, though there be prescribe^
rules, and probable inductions, ye^ has no man attained the perfect discovery
thereof. That general opinion tha^ the world grows near at an end, hat^
possessed al ages past as nearely as ours^ I am afraid that the souls that now
de^part, cannot escape the lingering expo^ stulation of the Saints under the
Altar (...) Domine? How long, O Lord? and groan in the expectation of the
^reat Jubilee. This is the day that must ^ake good the great attribute of Gods
justice, that must reconcile those unan^^erable doubts that torment the wisest
^nderstandings, and reduce those seem^g inequalities, and respective
distribu^^ons in this world, to an equality and ^^compensive Justice in the
next.

This is that one day, that shall include and comprehend all that went before
it, ^herein as in the last scene, all the (...) must enter to complete and make
^p the Catastrophe of this great piece. ^his is the day, who^e only memory
^ath power to make us honest in the ^arke, and to be virtuous without a
^itnesse. Ipsa sui pretium virtus sihi, that ^ertue is her own reward, is but
a cold ^rinciple, and not able to maintain our ^ariable resolutions in a
constant and ^etled way of goodness. I have practi^ed that honest artifice of
Seneca, and ^my retired and solitary imaginations, ^o detain me from the
foulness of vice, have fancyed to my self the presence of my dear and
worthyest friend before whom I should lose my head, rather then be vicious, yet
herein I foun^ that there was naught but moral honesty, and this was not to be
virtuous for his sake who must reward us at the la^^ day. I have tried if I
could have reached that great resolution of his, to be honest without a thought
of Heaven o^ hell; and indeed I found upon a natural inclination, and inbred
loyalty unto virtue, that I could serve her without a li^ very, yet not in the
resolved venerabl^ way, but that the frailty of my nature upon an easy
temptation, might be induced to forget her. The life therefore and spirit of
all our actions, is the resu^^rection, and stable apprehension. tha^ our ashes
shall enjoy the fruit of our p^ous endeavors; without this, all Religion is a
fallacy; and those impieties o^ Lucian and Euripedes, are no blasphe^ mies, but
subtle verities, and Atheist have been the only Philosophers. Ho^ shall the
dead arise? is no question o^ my faith, to believe only possibilities, ^s not
faith, but mere Philosophy, many things are true in Divinity, which ^are
neither inducible by reason, nor confirmable by sense, and many things in
Philosophy confirmable by sense, yet not inducible by reason. Thus it is
impossible by any solid or demonstrative reasons to perceive a man to believe
the conversion of the Needle to the North; though this be possible, and true,
and easily credible, upon a single experiment of the sense. I believe that our
estranged and divided ashes shall unite again, that our separated dust after
so many pilgrimages and transformations into the parts of Minerals, Plants,
Animals, Elements, shall at the voice of God return into their primitive
shapes, and join again to make up their primary and predestinate forms. As at
the Creation, there was a separation of the confused mass into its species; so
at the destruction thereof shall be a separation into its distinct individuals.
As at the Creation of the world, all that distinct species that we behold, lay
involved in one mass, till the fruitful voice of God separated this united
multitude into its several species: so at the last day, when those corrupted
Relics shall be scattered in the wilderness of forms, and seem to have
forgot their proper habits, God by a powerful voice shall command them b^cke
into their proper shapes, and call them out by their single and individuals:
Then shall appear the fertility of Adam, and the magic of that sperme that
has dilated into so many millions; what is made to be immortal, Nature
cannot, nor will the voice of God destroy.

Those bodies that we behold to perish, were in their created natures,
immortal, and liable unto death but accidentally, and upon forfeit, and
therefore they owe not that natural homage unto death, as other bodies do,
but may be restored to immortality with a lesser miracle, as by a bare and
easy revocation of course return immortal. I have often beheld as a miracle,
that artificial resurrection and vivification of Mercury, how being mortified
in a thousand shapes, it assumes again its own, and returns into its
numericall self.

Let us speak naturally, and as Philosophers, the forms of alterable bodies
in those sensible corruptions perish not; nor as we imagine, wholly quit their
mansions, but retire and contract themselves into those secret and unaccessable
parts, where they may best protect themselves against the action of their
Antagonists. A plant or vegetable consumed to ashes, to a contemplative and
school Philosopher seems utterly destroyed, and the form to have taken his
leave for ever: But to a subtle Artist the forms are not perished, but
withdrawn into their combustible part, where they li^ secure from the action of
that devouring element. This I make good by experience, and can from the ashes
of a plant revive the plant, and from its cinders r^cal it to its stalk and
leaves again. What the Art of man can do in these inferior pieces, what
blasphemy is it to imagine the finger of God cannot do in those more perfect
and sensible structures? This is that mystical Philosophy, from whence no true
Scholar becomes an Atheist, but from the visible effects of nature, grows up a
real Divine, and beholds not as in a dream, as Ezekiel, but in an ocular and
visible object the types of his resurrection. Now, the necessary Mansions of
our restored self, are these two contrary incompatible places we call Heaven
and Hell; to define them, or strictly to determine what and where these are,
surpasses my divinity. That elegant Saint, which seemed to have a glimpse of
Heaven, has left but a negative description thereof; Which neither eye has
seen, nor ear has heard, nor can enter into the heart of man; he was
translated out of himself to behold it, but being returned into himself could
not express it. Saint John's description by Emeralds, Chrysolites, and precious
stones, is too weak to express the material Heaven we behold. Briefly
therefore, where the soul has the full measure, and complement of happiness,
where the bound^esse appetite of the spirit remains completely satisfied, that
it can neither desire addition nor alteration; that I think is truly Heaven:
and this can only be in the enjoyment of that essence, whose infinite
goodness is able to terminate the desires of it self, and the unsatiable
wishes of ours; where ever God will thus manifest himself, there is Heaven,
though within the circle of this sensible world.

Thus the sense of man may be in Heaven any where within the limits of his own
proper body, and when it cease to live in the body, it may remain in its
own soul, that is its Creator. And thus we may say that Saint Paul, whether
in the body, or out of the body, was yet in Heaven. To place it in the
Empyriall, or beyond the tenth Sphere, is to forget the worlds destruction; for
when this sensible world shall be destroyed, and shall then be here as it was
there, an Empyriall Heaven, a quasi vacuitie, when to ask where Heaven is, is
to demand where the presence of God is, or where we have the glory of that
happy vision. Moses that was bred up in all the learning of the Egyptians,
committed a gross absurdity in Philosophy when with the eyes of flesh he
desired to see God, and petitioned his Maker, that is truth it self, to
contradiction. Those that imagine Heaven and Hell neighbors, and conceive a
vicinity between those two extremes, upon consequence of the Parable, where
Dives discoursed with Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, do too gros^ely conceive of
those glorified creatures, whose eyes shall easily out-see the Sun, and
behold without a Perspective, the extremest distances: for if there shall be
in our glorified eyes, the faculty of sight and reception of objects, I could
think the visible species there to be in as unlimitable a way as now the
intellectuals. I grant that two bodies placed beyond the tenth Sphere, or in a
vacuity, according to A^istotles Philosophy, could not behold each other,
because there wants a body or Medium to have and transport the visible rays of
the object unto the sense, but when there shall be a general defect of either
Medium to convey, or light to prepare and dispose that Medium, and yet a
perfect vision, we must suspend the rules of our Philosophy, and make all good
by a more absolute piece of Optics. I cannot tell how to say that fire is the
essence of hell, I know not what to make of Purgatory, or conceive a flame that
can neither prey upon, nor purify the substance of a soul; those flames of
sulphur mentioned in the Scriptures, I take not to be understood of this
present Hell, but of that to come where fire shall make up the complement of
our tortures, and have a body or subject wherein to manifest its tyranny: Some
who had the honor to be Text. in divinity, are of opinion it shall be the same
specificall fire with ours. This is hard to conceive, yet can I make good how
even that may prey upon our bodies, and yet not consume us: for in this
material world, there are bodies that passed invincible in the powerfullest
flames, and though by action of the fire they fell into ignition and liquation,
yet will they never suffer a destruction: I would know how Moses with an
actual fire calcind, or burnt the golden Calfe into powder: for that mystical
mettle of gold, whose solary and celestial nature I adore, exposed unto the
violence of fire, grows only hot and liquifies, but consumes not: so when the
consumable and volatile pieces of our bodies shall be refined into a more
impregnable and fixed temper like gold, though they suffer from the action of
the flames, they shall never perish, but lie immortal in the arms of fire.

And surely if this frame must suffer only by the action of this element,
there will many bodies escape, and not only Heaven, but earth will not be at
an end, but rather a beginning; For at present it is not earth, but a
composition of fire, water, earth, and air; but at that time ^poyled of those
ingredients, it shall ap^eare in a substance more like it self, its ashes.
Philosophers that opinioned the worlds destruction by fire, did never dream of
annihilation, which is beyond the power of sublunary causes; for the ^ast and
proper action of that element is ^ut vitrification, or a reduction of a body
unto Glass, and therefore some of our Chymicks factiously affirm; yea, and
^rge Scripture for it, that at the last fire all shall be crystallized and
reverbera^ed into Glass, which is the utmost action of that element. Nor need
we fear ^his term annihilation, or wonder that God will destroy the works of
his Creation: for man subsisting, who is, and then truly appears a Microcosme,
^he world cannot be said to be destroyed. For the eyes of God* and perhaps also
of our glorified selves, shall as real^y behold and contemplate the world in
^ts Epitome or contracted essence, as ^ow it does at large in its dilated
substance. In the Syen of a Plant to the eyes of God, and to the understanding
of man, there exist, though in an invisible way, the perfect leaves, flowers,
and fruit thereof: for things that a^e in poss^ to the sense, are actually
existent to the understanding. Thus God beholds all things, who contemplates as
fully his works in their Epitome, as in their full volume, and beheld as amply
the whole world in that little compendium of the sixth day, as in the scattered
and dilated pieces of those five before. Men commonly set ^orth the torments of
Hell by fire, and the extremity of corporal afflictions, and describe Hell in
the same method that Mahomet does Heaven. This indeed makes a noise, and drums
in popular ears: but if this be the terrible piece thereof, it is not worthy
to stand in diameter with Heaven, whose happiness consists in that part that
is best able to comprehend it, that immortal essence, the translated divinity
of God, the soul. I thank God, and with joy I mention it, I was never afraid
of hell, nor never grew pale at the description of that place; I have so fixed
my contemplations on Heaven, that I have almost forgot the Idea of Hell, and am
afraid rather to lose the joys of Heaven, then endure the misery of Hell; to
be deprived of them is a perfect Hell, and needs me thinks no addition to
complete our afflictions; that terrible ^erme has never detained me from sin,
nor do I owe any good action to the name thereof: I fear God, yet am not
afraid of him, his mercies make me ashamed of my sins, before his judgments
afraid thereof: these are the forced and ^econdary method of his wisdom, which
^e uses but as the l^st remedy, and upon provocation, a course rather to
detain the wicked, then to incite the god^y to his worship. I cannot think
there was ever any scared into heaven, they go the fairest way to heaven, that
would serve God without a hell, other Mercinaries that crouch unto him in fear
of ^ell, though they term themselves the servants, are indeed but the slaves
of the Almighty: and to be true and speak my soul, when I survey the
occurrences of my life, and call into account the finger of God, I can perceive
nothing but an abyss and mass of mercies, either in general to mankind, or
in particular to my self, and whether out of the prejudice of my own
affections, or an inverting and partial conceit of his mercies, I know not,
but those which others term crosses, afflictions, judgments, misfortunes, to
me who enquire farther into them then visible effects, they both appear, and
in effect have ever proved the secret and dissembled favors of his affection.
It is a singular piece of wisdom to apprehend truly, and without passion the
work of God, and so well to distinguish his justice from his mercy, as not
miscall those noble attributes; yet it is likewise an honest piece of Logic,
to dispute and argue the proceedings of God, as to distinguish even his
judgments into mercies. For God is merciful unto all, because to the worst,
that the best deserve, and to say he punishes none in ^his world, though it be
a Paradox, is no absurdity. To one that has committed murder, if the Judge
should say, only ordain a Fine, it were a madness to call this punishment,
and to repine at the sentence, rather then admire the clemency of the Judge.
Thus our offenses being mortal, and deserving not only death, but damnation,
if the goodness of God be content to tra^verse and pass them over with a
loss, misfortune, or disease; what Frenzy were it to term this a
punishment, rather than an extremity of mercy, to ^groane under the rod of his
judgments, rather then admire the Scepter of his mercies? therefore to adore,
honor, and admire him, is a debt of gratitude due from the obligation of our
nature, ^states, and conditions, and with these thoughts, he that knows them
best, will not deny that I adore him; that I obtain heaven, and the bliss
thereof, is accidental, and not the intended work of my devotion, it being a
felicity I can neither think to deserve, nor scarce in modesty to expect. For
these two ends of us all, either as rewards, or punishments, are mercifully
ordained, and disproportionally disposed unto our actions, the one being far
beyond our deserts, the other so infinitely below our demerits* There is no
salvation to those that believe not in Christ, that is, say some since his
Nativity, and as Divinity affirms before also, which makes m^ much apprehend
the end of those honest Worthies and Philosophers which dyed before his
Incarnation. It is hard to place those souls in hell whose life does teach us
virtue on earth; me thinks amongst those many subdivisions of hel^ there might
have been one Limbo left for those: What strange vision will it be to see
their poetical fictions converted into verities, and their imagined and
fancyed furies, into real devils? how strange to them will sound the History
of Adam, when they shall suffer for him they never heard of? when they that
derive their Genealogy from the gods, shall know they are the unhappy issue of
sinful man? It is an insolent part of reason to controvert the works of God,
or question the justice of his proceedings; Could humility teach others, as it
has instructed me, to contemplate the infinite and incomprehensible distance
betwixt the Creator and the creature, or did we seriously perpend that one
principle of Saint Paul, Shall the vessel say to the Potter, Why have thou
made me thus? it would prevent the arrogant disputes of reason, nor would we
argue the definitive sentence of God, either in heaven or hell. Men that live
according to the right rule and law of reason, live but in their own kind, as
beasts do in theirs* who justly obey the prescript of their natures, and
therefore cannot reasonably demand a reward of their actions as only obeying the
natural dictates of their reasons. It will therefore, and must at last
appear, that all salvation is through Christ; which verity I fear those great
examples of virtue must confirm, and make it good, how the perfectest actions
of earth have no title or claim unto heaven: nor truly do I think the lives
of these or of any other were ever correspondent or in all points conformable
unto their doctrines; it is evident that Aristotle transgressed the rule of his
own Ethics; the Stoics that condemn passion, and command a man to laugh in
Phalaris his Bull; could not endure without a groan, a fit of the stone or
collicke. The Scepticks that affirm they knew nothing, even in that opinion
confute themselves, and thought they knew more then all the world. Diogenes I
hold to be the most vainglorious man of his time, and more ambitious in
refusing all honors, then Alexander in rejecting none. Vice and the Devil put
a fallacy upon our reasons, and provoking too hastily to run from it, entangle
and profound us deeper in it. The Duke of Venice, that yearly weds himself
unto the Sea, by casting thereinto a ring of Gold, I will not argue of
prodigality, because it is a solemnity of good use and consequence in the
State. But the Philosopher that threw his money into the Sea to avoid avarice,
was a notorious prodigal. There is no road or ready way to virtue, it is not
an easy point of ^^rt to dis-intangle our selves from this ^iddle, or web of
sin: To perfect virtue, ^s to Religion, there is required a Pano^^lia or
complete armor, that whilst we lie not at a close ward against one ^vice we
lie open to another: And indeed wiser discretions that have the ^^hred of
reason to conduct them, offend without a pardon; whereas under heads may
stumble without dishonor. There go so many circumstances to piece up one good
action, that it is a lesson to be good, and we are forced to be virtuous by the
book. Again, the practice of men holds not an equal pace, yea, and often
runs counter to their Theory; we naturally know what is good, but naturally
pursue what is evil: the Rhetoric wherewith I persuade another, cannot
persuade my self: there is a depraved appetite in us, that will with patience
hear the learned instructions of Reason; but yet perform no farther then
agrees to its own irregular humor. In brief, we all are monsters, that is, a
composition of man and beast, wherei^ we must endeavor to be as the Poets
fancy that wise man Chiron, that is, to have the Region of Man above that o^
Be^st, and sense to fit but at the foot o^ reason. Lastly, I do desire with
God* that all, but yet affirm with men, that few shall know salvation, that the
bridge is narrow, the passage strait unto life, ye^ those who do confine the
Church o^ God, either to particular Nations, Churches, o^ Families, have made
it far narrower then ever our Savior meant it. (...) believe many are saved,
who to man^ seem reprobated, and many are reprobated, who in the opinion and
sentence of man stand elected; there will appear at the last day, strange, and
unexpected examples, both of his Justice and mercy, and therefore to desire
either, is folly in man, and insolency even in the devils; those acute and
subtle spirits cannot divine in all their sagacity, who sha^^ be saved, which
if they could prognosticate, their labor were at an end; no^ need they
compass the earth, seeking whom they may devour. Those who upon rigid
application of the Law, sentence Solomon unto damnation, condemn not only him,
but themselves, and the whole world; for by the letter, and written Word of
God, we are without exception in the state of death, but there is a prerogative
of God, and an arbitra^y pleasure above the letter of his own Law, by which
alone we can pretend unto salvation, and through which Solomon might be as
easily saved as those who condemn him.

The number of those who pretend un^o salvation, and those infinite swarms who
think to pass through the ^ye of a Needle, have much amazed me. That name and
compellation of little Flock, does not comfort but deject my devotion,
especially when I reflect upon mine own unworthiness, wherein, according to
my humble apprehensions, I am ^elow them all: I believe there shall never be an
Anarchy in Heaven, but as ^here are Hierarchies amongst the Angels, so shall
there be degrees of priority amongst the Saints. Yet is it (I protest) beyond
my ambition to aspire unto the first ranks, my desires only are, and (...)
shall be only happy therein, to be bu^ the last man, and bring up* the Rere i^
Heaven.

Again, I am confident, and fully persuaded, yet dare not take my oath o^ my
salvation; I am as it were sure and do believe, without all doubt, that there
is such a City as Constantinople, yet for me to take my oath thereon, were a
kin^ of perjury, because I hold not infallible warrant from my own sense to
confirm^^ me in the certainty thereof. And truly, though many pretend an
absolute certainty of their salvation, yet when an humble soul shall
contemplate her own unworthiness, she shall meet with many doubts and
suddenly find how much we stand in need of the precept of Saint Paul, Work
out your salvation with f^are and trembling. That which is the cause of my
election, I hold to be the cause of my salvation, which was the mercy, and
beneplacity of God, before was, or the foundation of the world: before Abraham
was, I am; is the saying of Christ, yet is true, if I say it of my self, for I
was not only before my self, ^ut Adam, that is, in the Idea of God, and the
decree of that Synod held from ^ll Eternity. And in this sense I say, the ^orld
world was before the Creation, and at an end before it had a beginning.

Insolent zeales that destroy good ^orkes and rely upon faith, take not a^ay
merit: for depending upon the ef^icacy of their faith, they enforce the
^ondition of God, and in a more sophi^ticall way do seem to challenge Heaven.
It was ordered by God, that one^y those that lapt in the water like dogs should
have the honor to destroy the Midianites, yet could none of those just^y
challenge, or imagine he deserved the honor: Thereupon I do not deny, but that
true faith, and such as God requires, ^s not only a mark or token, but also a
means of our Salvation, but where to find this, is as obscure to me, as my
last end. And if our Savior could object unto his own Disciples, and
favorites a faith, that to the quantity of a grain of Mustard seed, is able
to remove mountains; surely that which we boast of, is not any thing, or at
the most, but a remove from nothing.

This is the Tenor of my belief, wherein, though there be many things
singular, and to the humor of my irregular self, yet, if they square not with
maturer Judgments, I disclaim them, and do no further father them, then the
learned and best Judgments shall authorize them.

The Second part.
NOw for the other Virtue of Charity, without which faith is a mere notion,
and of no existence, I have ever endeavored to nourish this merciful
disposition, and humane inclination, which I borrowed from my Parents, and
regulate it to the prescribed Laws of Cha^ity; and if I hold the true Anatomy
of ^y self, I am delineated and naturally ^ramed to such a piece of virtue,
for I am ^f a constitution so general, that it con^orts, and sympathizeth with
all things; (...) have no antipathy, or rather Idio-syn^rasie, in diet, humor,
air, any thing; wonder not at the French, for their ^ishes of froggs, snailes,
and toadstooles; Nor at the Jews for Locusts, and Grasse^oppers, but being
amongst them, make them my Common viands. And I find ^hey agree with my stomach
as well as ^heirs; I could digest a Sallad ga^hered ^n a Churchyard, as well
as in a Gar^en. I cannot start at the present of a Serpent, Scorpion, Lizard,
or Salaman^er; at the sight of a Toad, or Viper, I ^inde in me no desire to
take up a stone ^o destroy them. I feel not in my self those common
antipathies that I can ^iscover in others: Those national re^ugnancies do not
touch me; nor do I ^ehold with prejudice, the Flemmish, I^alian, Spaniard, or
Dutch; but where I find their actions in balance with my Country men's; I
honor, love, and embrace them in some degree; I was born^ in the eighth
Climate; but seemed forty beframed and constellated unto all; (...) am no plant
that will not prosper out o^ a Garden. All places, all ages, make^ unto me one
Country; I am in England every where, and under any meridian I have been
shipwrackt, yet am not enemy with the sea or winds; I can study play, or sleep
in a tempest. In brief* I am averse from nothing, neither Plant* Animal, nor
Spirit; my Conscience would give me the lie, if I should say (...) absolutely
detest, or hate the Devil, or at least abhor him, but that we may come to
composition. Is there any thing among those common objects of hatred that I can
safely, I do contemn and laugh at? That great inquiry of reason, virtue, and
Religion, the multitude, that numerous piece of Monstruosity, which taken
asunder, seems the reasonable Creatures of God; but confused together make but
one great beast, and a^ monster, more prodigious then Hydra; ^t is no breach of
Charity to call those ^ooles, it is the style all holy Writers ^ave afforded
them, set down by Solomon in the holy Scripture, and a point of our faith to
believe so. Neither in ^he name of multitude do I only include ^he base and
minor sort of people; there ^s a rabble even amongst the Gentry, a ^ort of
Plebeian heads, whose fancy move with the same wheel as these men, even in the
same Level with Me^hanickes, though their fortunes do ^omewhat guild their
infirmities, and their purses compound for their follies. But as in casting
account, three or four men together come short in account of ^ne man placed by
himself below them: So neither are a troop of those ignorant ^oradoes, of that
true esteem and va^ue, as many a forlorn person, whose condition does place
them below their ^eet. Let us speak like Politicians, there ^s a Nobility
without Heraldry, a natu^all dignity, whereby one man is Ranked with another,
and Filed before him, according to the quality of his desert, and pre-eminence
of his good parts: though the corruption of these times, and the by a^ of this
present practice wheel another way: thus it was in the first and privitiv^
Commonwealth, and is yet in the integrity and Cradle of well-ordered polities,
till corruption gets ground, ruder desires laboring after that which wiser
considerations contemn, every on^ having a liberty to amasse and heap u^
riches, and therewith a license or faculty to do or purchase any thing. The
general and indifferent temper of mine does more nearly dispose me to thi^
noble virtue. It is a happiness to b^ borne and framed unto virtue, and t^
grow up from the seeds of nature, rathe^ then the inoculation and forced
graffe^ of education, yet if we are directed only by our particular Natures,
and regulate our inclinations by no higher rul^ than that of our reasons, we
are but Moralists; Divinity will still call us hea^thens. Therefore this great
work o^ Charity, must have other motives, ends and impulsions: I give no alms
to satisfy the hunger of my Brother, but to fulfill and accomplish the Will
and Command of my God; I draw not my purse for his sake that demands it, but
his that enjoined it; I relieve no man upon the Rhetoric of his miseries, nor
to con^ent mine own commiserating disposi^ion, for this is still but moral
Charity, and an act that owes more to passion ^hen reason. He that relieves
another upon the bare suggestion and bowels of ^ity, does not so much for his
sake as ^or his own: for by compassion we make others miseries our own, and so
by re^ieving them, we relieve our selves al^o.

It is an erroneous conceit to redress ^ther men's misfortunes upon the common
considerations of merciful natures, that it may be one day our own case, ^or
this is a sinister, and politic kind of Charity, whereby we seem to be
speak ^he pities of men in the like occasions; and I have observed that those
profes^ed Eleemosynaries, though in a crowd or multitude, do yet place their
petitions on a few and selected persons.

There is surely a Physiognomy, which those experienced and Master Mendicants
observe, whereby they instantly discover a merciful aspect, and will single
out a face, wherein they spy the signatures and marks of pity: for there are
mystically in our faces certain characters which carry in them the motto of
our Souls, wherein he that can read A. B. C. may read our natures. I behol^
moreover that there is a Phistognomy or Physiognomy, not only of men, bu^ of
Plants, and Vegetables; and in every one of them, some outward figures which
hang as signs or bushes of their inward forms.

The finger of God has left an inscription upon all his works, not graphicall
or composed of Letters, but o^ their several forms, constitutions, parts and
operations, which aptly joined together, make one word that does express their
natures. By those Letters God calls the Stars by their names, and by this
Alphabet Adam assigned to every nature, a name peculiar to its Nature. Now
there are besides these Characters in our faces, certain mystical figures in
our hands, which I dare not call mere dash strokes, a Lavole, or at random,
because delineated by a pencill, that never works in vain; and hereof I take
the more particular notice, because I carry that in mine own hand, which I
could never read of, nor discover in another. Aristotle, I confess, in his
acute, and singular book of Physiognomy, has made mention of Chiromancy, yet
I believe the Egyptians, who were ever addicted to those abstruse and mystical
sciences, had a knowledge therein, to which those vagabond and counterfeit
Egyptians do yet pretend, and perhaps retain a few corrupted principles, which
sometimes may verify their Prognostickes.

It is a common wonder of all men, how among so many millions of faces, ^here
should be none alike; Now contrary; I wonder as much how there should be any,
he that shall consider how many thousand several words have been carelessely
and without study composed out of 24. Letters; withal how many hundred lines
there are to be drawn in the fabric of one man; shall easily find that this
variety is necessary. And it will be very hard that they shall so concur as
to make one portract like another. Let a Painter carefully limb out a Million
of faces, and you shall find them all different, and after all this art there
will remain a sensible distinction from the pattern of every thing in the
perfectest of that kind; wherefore we shall still come short, though we
transcend or go beyond it, because herein it is wide and agrees not in all
points unto its Copy, nor does the similitude of Creatures disparage the
variety of nature, nor any way confound the works of God. For even in things
alike there is a diversity, and those that do seem to accord, do manifestly
disagree. And thus is Man like God, for in the same things that we resemble
him, we are utterly different from him. There was never any thing so like
another, as in all points to concur, there will be ever some reserved
difference slip in, to prevent the Identity without which, two several things
would not be alike, but the same, which ^s impossible. But to return from
Philo^ophy to Charity, I hold not so narrow a conceit of this virtue, as to
conceive that to give alms, is only to be chari^able, or think a piece of
Liberality can comprehend the Total of Charity; Di^inity has wisely divided
the act thereof into many branches, and has taught ^s in this narrow way, many
paths unto goodness; as many ways as we may do good, so many ways we may be
charitable, there are infirmities, not one^y of body, but of Soul, and
fortunes, which do require the merciful hand of our abilities.

I cannot contemn a man for ignorant, ^ut behold him with as much pity as I do
Lazarus. It is no greater Charity to cloth his body, then apparel the
nakedness kednesse of his Soul. It is an honorable object to see the reasons
of other men were our Liveries, and their borrowed understandings do homage to
the bounty of ours. It is the cheapest way of beneficence, and like the
natural charity of the Sun illuminates another without obscuring it self.
To be reserved in this part of goodness, is the sordidest piece of
covetousness, and more contemptible then the pecuniary avarice. To this (as
calling my self a Scholar) I am obliged by the duty of my condition, I make
not therefore my head a grave, but a treasury of knowledge, I intend no
Monopoly, but a Community in learning, I study not for my own sake only, but
for theirs that study not for themselves. I envy no man that knows more then
my self* but I pity them that know less. I instruct no man as an exercise of
my knowledge, or with an intent rather to nourish and keep it alive in mine
own head, then beget and engender it in his; in the midst of all my endeavors
there is but one thought that dejects me, that my acquired parts must perish
with my self, nor can be Legacyed among my honored Friends. I cannot fall out
or contemn a man for an error, or conceive why a difference in opinion should
divide our affections: for controversies, disputes, and argumentations, both in
Philosophy, and in Divinity, if they meet with discreet and peaceable natures,
do not infringe the Laws of Charity in all disputes; so much as there is of
passion, so much there is of nothing to the purpose, for then reasons, like a
bad hound spends upon a false sent, and forsakes the question first started.
And this is one reason why controversies are never determined, for though they
be amply proposed, they are scarce at all handled, they do so wander with
unnecessary Digressions, and the Parenthesis of the party, is often as large as
the maine discourse upon the Subject. The Foundations of Religion are already
established and the principles of Salvation subscribed unto by all, there
remains not one controversy that is worth a passion, and yet never any
disputed without, not only in Divinity, but in inferior Arts: What a (...),
and hot skirmish is betwixt S. and T. in Lucian? so does Grammarians hacke and
slash for the Genitive case in Jupiter. How many Synods have been assembled
and angerly broke up again about a line in Propria quae Maribus? How do they
break their own pates to salve that of Priscian? Si foret in terris rideret
Democritus. Yea, even amongst wiser militants, how many wounds have been
given, and credits shamed for the poor victory of an opinion or beggarly
conquest of a distinction? Scholars are men of peace, they bear no arms, but
their tongues are sharper then Actius his razor, their pens carry farther, and
give a louder report then thunder; I had rather stand in the stroke of a
Basilisco then in the fury of a merciless pen. It is not mere zeal to
learning, or devotion to the Muses, that wiser Princes Patron the Arts, and
carry an indulgent respect unto Scholars, but a desire to have their names
eternized by the memory of their Writings, and a fear of the revengefull pen
of succeeding ages: for these are men, that when they have played their parts,
and had their exits, must step out and give the moral of their Scenes, and
deliver unto posterity an Inventory of their virtues and vices. And surely
there goes a great deal of conscience to the compiling of an History, and
there is no reproach to the scandal of a Story. It is such an authenticke
kind of falsehood that with authority belies our good names to all Nations and
Posterities.

There is another offense to Charity, which no Author has ever written of, and
few take notice of, and that is the ^eproach, not of whole professions,
my^teries and conditions, but of whole nations, wherein lie opprobrious
Epithets that we must call each other, and upon ^ncharitable Logic from a
disposition ^n a few conclude a habit in all.

^e mutin Anglo^s et le Brenach Escossois,
^e bougre Italion and l^ fol Francois,
Le Poultron Roman et le carron Gascoin,
Le Espagnol superb et le Almain jurogn.
S. Paul that calls the Cretians lyer^ does it but indirectly and upon quotation
of their own Poet. It is as bloody (...) thought in one way as Neroes was in
naother.

For by a word we wound a thousand and at one blow assassine the Honor o^ a
Nation. It is a complete piece of madness to miscall and rail against the
times, or think to recall men to reason, by a fit of passion: Democritu^ that
thought to laugh the times into goodness, seems to me as deeply
Hypochondriack, as Heraclitus that bewailed them; it moves not my spleen to
behold the multitude in their proper humors, that is, in their fits of folly
and madness, as well understanding that Wisdom is not common to the world,
and that it is the privilege of a few to be virtuous.

They that endevor to abolish vice destroy also virtue, for contraries, though
they destroy one another, are yet in life of one another. Thus virtue (abolish
vice) is an Idea; again, the community of sin does not desparage goodness,
for when vice gains upon the major part, virtue, in whom it remains, becomes
more excellent, and being lost in some, multip^^^s its goodness in another
which remain untouched, and persists entire in the general inundation. I can
therefore behold vice without a fature content, only with an admonition, or
instructive apprehension; for Noble natures, and such as are capable of
goodness, are not railed into vice, and maintain the cause of injured truth:
no man can justly censure or condemn another, because indeed no man truly
knows another.

This I perceive in my self, for I am in the dark to all the world, and my
nearest friends behold me but in a cloud; those that know me but superficially,
think less of me then I do of my self; those of my near acquaintance think
more; God, who truly knows me, knows that I am nothing, for he beholds me,
and all the world, who looks not on us through a divided ray, or a trajection
of a sensible species, but beholds the substance without the helps of
accidents, and the forms of things, as we their operations. Further, no man
can judge another, because n^^man knows himself, for we censure others but as
they disagree from that humor which we fancy laudable in our selves, and
commend others but for that wherein they seem to quadrateand consent with us.
So that in conclusion, all is but that we all condemn, self-love, which is
the general complaint of these times, and perhaps of those past, that charity
grows cold; which I perceive most verified in those which most do magnify
the fires and flames of zeal; for it is a virtue that best agrees with coldest
natures, and such as are complexioned for humility: But how shall we expect
charity toward others, when we are uncharitable to our selves? and charity
begins at home, in the voice of the world, yet is every man his own grea^est
enemy, and as it were his own executioner. Non occides, is the Commandment of
God, yet scarce observed by any man, for I perceive every man is his own
Atropos, and lends a hand to cut the thread of his own days. Cain was not
therefore the first murderer, but Adam, who brought in death; whereof he beheld
the practice and example in his own son Abel, and saw that verified in the
experience of others, which faith could not persuade him in the Theory of
himself.

There is no man that apprehends his own miseries less than my self, and no
man that so nearely apprehends another. I could lose an arm without a ^eare,
and with few groans, me thinks, be quartered into pieces; yet can I weep most
seriously at a Play, and receive with a true passion, the counterfeit griefs of
those known and professed impostures. It is a barbarous part of inhumanity to
add unto any afflicted parties misery, or endeavor to multiply in any man a
passion, whose single nature is already above his patience, and this was the
greatest affliction of Job, and those oblique expostulations of his friends, a
deeper injury then the downright blows of the Devil. It is not the tears
of our own eyes only, but of our Friends also, that do exhaust the current
of our sorrows, which falling into many streams, run more peaceably and are
contented with a narrow channel. It is an act within the power of charity, to
translate a passion out of one breast into another, and to divide a sorrow
almost out of it self; for affliction like a dimension may be so divided, as
if not indivisible, at least to become insensible. Now with my friend I desire
not to share or participate, but to ingrosse his sorrows, that by making them
mine own, I may more easily discuss them; for in mine own reason, and within
my self I can command that which I cannot entreat without my self, and within
the circle of another. I have often thought those noble paires and examples of
friendship not so truly Histories of what had been, as fictions of what should
be, but I now perceive nothing in them, but easy possibilities, nor any thing
in the Heroic examples of Damon and Pithias, Achilles and Patroclus, which I
could not perform within the narrow compass of my self.

That a man should lay down his life for his friend, seems strange to vulgar
affections, and such as confine themselves within that worldly principle,
Charity begins at home. For mine own part I could never remember the
relations that I held unto my self, nor the respect that I owe unto mine own
nature, in the cause of God, my Country, and my Friends. Next to these three, I
do emprace my self; I confess I do not observe that order that the Schools
or^aine our affections, to love our Parents, Wifes, Children, and then our
Friends, ^or excepting the injunctions of Religion, I do not find in my self
such a ne^essary and indissoluble Sympathy to those of my blood. I hope I do
not ^reake the fifth Commandment, if I confess I love my Friend before the
nearest of my blood, even those t^ whom I owe the principles of life; I ne^ver
yet cast a true affection on a Woman but I have loved my Friend as I do
ve^tue, my soul, my God. From hence m^ thinks I do conceive how God love
man, what happiness there is in the lo^^ of God. Omitting all other, there a^
three most mystical unions.

1. Two natures in one person. 2. Three persons in one nature. 3. One soul in
two bodies.
For though indeed they be really d^^vided, yet are they so united, as the^
seem but one, and make rather a dual^^ty then two distinct souls.

There are wonders in true affections it is a body of Aenigmaes, mysteries an^
riddles, wherein two so become one, (...) they both become two; I love my
frien^ before my self, and me thinks I do^ not love him enough; some few
month^ hence my multiplied affection wi^^ make me believe I have not loved hi^
at all, when I am from him, I a^ dead till I be with him, when I am with him, I
am not satisfied, but would still be nearer him: united souls are not
satisfied with embraces, but desire to be ^ruly each other, which being
impossible, their desires are infinite, and must proceed without a possibility
of satisfaction. Another misery there is in affection, that whom we truly love
like our own selves, we forget their looks, nor ^an our memory retain the
Idea of their ^aces; and it is no wonder, for they are our selves, and our
affections makes their looks our own. This noble affection f^ls not on vulgar
and common ^onstitutions, but on such as are marked ^or virtue, he cannot love
his friend ^ith this noble ardor that will in a com^etent degree affect all.
Now if we can ^ring our affections to look beyond the ^ody, and cast an eye
upon the soul, we ^ave found out the true object, not on^y of Friendship but
Charity; and the greatest happiness that we can bequeath the soul, is that
wherein we al do place ^ur last felicity, salvation, which though it be not in
our power to bestow, it is in our charity, and pious invocations to desire, if
not procure and further. I cannot frame a Prayer for my self in particular,
without a catalogue for my friends, nor request a happiness wherein my
sociable disposition does not desire the fellowship of my Neighbor. I never
hear the Toll of a passing Bell though in my mirth, and at a Tavern, without
my prayers and best wishes for the departing spirit; I cannot go to cure the
body of my Pati^nt, but I forget my profession, and call unto God for hi^
soul; I cannot see one say his Prayers but instead of imitating him, I fall
into a zealous oration for him, who perhap^ is no more to me then a common
nature: and if God has vouchsafed a^ ear to my supplications, there are
surely many happy that never saw me, an^ enjoy the blessing of mine unknown^
devotions. To pray for enemies, that is for their salvation is no harsh precept
but the practice of our daily and ordinar^ devotions. I cannot believe the
story o^ the Italian, our bad wishes and uncharitable desires proceed no
further than this life; it is the devil, and the uncharitable votes of hell,
that desire our misery in the world to come.

To do no injury, nor take none, was a principle, which to my firm years,
and impatient affections, seemed to contain enough of morality, but my more
settled years, and Christian constitution have salne upon more securer
resolutions. I hold there is no such thing as injury, that if there be, there
is no such injury as revenge, and no such revenge as the contempt of an injury;
that to ^hate another, is to malign himself, that the truest way to love
another, is to despise our selves. I were unjust unto mine own conscience, if
I should say I am at variance with any thing like my self, I find there are
many pieces in this our own Fabric of Man; and this frame is raised upon a
mass of Antipathies: I am one me thinks, but as the world wherein
notwithstanding there are a swarm of distinct essences, and in them another
world of contrarieties which carry private and domestic enemies within,
public and more hostile adversaries without.

The devil that did but buffet Saint Paul, plays me thinks at sharp with
me: Let me be nothing, if within the compass of my self, I do not find th^^
battle of Lepanto, passion against passion, reason against faith, faith
against the devil, and my conscience against al^^ There is another man within
me, rebukes, commands, and dastards me. (...) have no conscience of Marble to
resis^ the hammer of more heavy offenses nor yet too soft and waxen, as to tak^
the impression of each single peccadill^ or escape of infirmity: I am of a
strang^ belief, that it is as easy to be forgive^ some sins, as to commit
some others* For my original sin, I hold it to b^ washed away in my
Baptism; for my actual transgressions I compute and reckon with God, but from
my last repentance, Sacrament, or absolution: An^ therefore am not te^^ifyed
with the sin^ or madness of my youth. I thank the goodness of God I have no
sins that want a name, I am not singular in offenses, my transgressions are
Epidemicall, and from the common breath of our corruption, ^et even those
common and quotidian infirmities that so necessarily attend me, and do seem
to be my very nature, have so dejected me, so broken the estimation that I
should have otherwise, that I repute my self the most abjectest piece of
mortality, that I detest mine own nature, and in my retired imaginations
cannot withold my hands from violence on my self: Divines prescribe a fit of
sorrow to repentance, there goes indignation, anger, sorrow, hatred, into mine,
passions of a contrary nature, which neither seem to suit with this action,
nor my proper constitution. It is no breach of charity to our selves to be at
variance with our vices, nor to abhor that part of us, which is an enemy to
the ground of charity, our God; wherein we do but imitate our great selves the
world, whose divided antipathies and contrary faces do yet carry a charitable
regard to the whole by their particular discords, preserving the common
harmony, and keeping in fetters those powers whose rebellions once Masters,
might be the ruin of all. I thank God, amongst those millions of vices that I
do inherit and hold from Adam, I have escaped one, and that is a mortal enemy
to charity, the first and Father sin, not of man, but of devils, Pride, a
vice whose name is comprehended in a Monosillable, but in its nature
circumscribed with a world; I have escaped it in a condition that can hardly
avoid it: those petty acquisitions and reputed perfections that advance and
elevate the conceits of other men, add no feathers unto mine; I have seen a
Grammarian, toure, and plume himself over a single line in Horace, and show
more pride in the construction of one Ode, than the Author in the composure of
the whole book. For my own part besides the Fargon and Patonis of several
Provinces, I understand no less then six Languages, yet I protest I have no
higher conceit of my self then had our Fathers before the confusion of Babel,
when there was but one Language in the world, and none to boast himself either
Linguist or Critic. I have not only seen several Countries, beheld the
nature of their climes, the Chorography of their Provinces, Topography of their
Cities, but understood their several Laws, Customs and Policies; yet cannot
all this persuade the dullness of my spirit unto such an opinion of my self, as
I behold in nimbler and conceited heads, that never looked a degree beyond
their nest. I know the names, and somewhat more, of all the Stars in my
Horizon, yet I have seen a prating Mariner that could only name the Points
and the North Star, out-talke me, and conceit himself a whole Sphere above
me. I know almost all the Plants of my time, and of those about me; yet me
thinks I do not know so many as when I did but know an hundred, and had
scarcely ever Simpled further then Cheap Side: for indeed heads of capacity,
and such as are not full with a handful, or easy measure of knowledge, think
they know nothing, till they know all, which being impossible, they fall upon
the opinion of Socrates, and only know they know not any thing; I cannot think
that Homer pined away upon the riddle of the Fisherman, or that Aristotle, who
understood the uncertainety of knowledge, and confessed so often the reason of
man too weak for the work of nature, did ever drown himself upon the flux,
and reflux of Euripus: we do but learn to day, what our better advanced
judgments will teach to morrow: and Aristotle does instruct us, as Plato did
him; that is, to confute himself. I have run through all sorts, and find no
rest in any; though our first studies and junior endeavors may style us
Peripateticks, Stoics, or Academicks, yet I perceive the wisest heads prove at
last, almost all Scepticks, and stand like Ianus in the field of knowledge. I
have therefore one common and authenticke Philiosophy I learned in the
Schools, whereby I discourse and satisfy the reason of other men, another
more reserved and drawn from Experience, whereby I content mine own self.
Solomon that complained of ignorance in the height of knowledge, has not only
humbled my conceits, but discouraged my endeavors. There is yet another conceit
that has made me shut my books, which tells me it is a vanity to waste our
days in the blind pursuit of knowledge, it is but attending a little longer,
and we shall enjoy that by instinct and infusion which we endeavor all here by
labor and inquisition: it is better to sit down in a modest ignorance, and
rest contented with the natural blessing of our own reasons, then buy the
uncertain knowledge of this life, with sweat and vexation, which death gives,
every fool gains, and is an accessory of our glorification.

I was never yet once, and am resolved never to be married twice, not that I
disallow of a second marriage; as neither in all cases of Polygamy, which
considering the unequal number of both sexes may be also necessary. The whole
world was made for man, but the twelfth part of man for woman: man is the whole
world and the breath of God, woman the rib only, a crooked piece of man. I
could wish that we might procreate like trees, without conjunction, or that
there were any way to perpetuate the world without this trivial and vulgvlar
way of coition; It is the foolishest act a wise man commits in all his life,
nor is there any thing that will deject his cold imagination more, then when he
shall consider what an odd and unworthy piece of folly he has committed; I
speak not in prejudice, nor am averse from that sweet sex, but naturally
amorous of all that is beautiful; I can look a whole day with delight upon a
handsome picture, though it be but of an Horse. It is my temper, and I like it
the better, to affect all harmony, and since there is music even in the
beauty, and the silent notes which Cupid strikes, far sweeter then the vocal
found of an instrument. For there is a music wherever there is a harmony,
order or proportion, and thus far we may maintain the music of the spheres,
for those well ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no sound to
the ear, yet to the understanding they strike a note most full of harmony.

Whatsoever is harmonically composed delights in harmony; which makes me much
distrust the simetry of those heads which declaime against our Church music.
For my self, not only for my Catholic obedience, but my particular genius, I
am obliged to maintain it, for even that vulgar and Tavern Music which
makes one man merry, another mad, strikes in me a deep fit of devotion, and a
profound contemplation of my Maker; there is something in it of Divinity more
then the ear discovers. It is an Hieroglyphicall and shadowed lesson of the
whole world, and Creatures of God, such a melody to the ear, as the whole
world well understood, would afford the understanding. In brief, it is a
sensible fit of that harmony, which intellectually sounds in the ears of God, it
unties the ligaments of my frame, takes me to pieces, dilates me out of my
self, and by degrees, me thinks, resolves me into heaven. I will not say with
Plato, the Soul is Harmony, but harmonicall, has its nearest sympathy unto
music: thus some, whose temper of body agrees, and humors the constitution
of their souls, are borne Poets, though indeed all are naturally inclined unto
Rhyme. This made Tacitus in the very first line of his story, fall upon a verse;
and Ciccro, the worst of Poets, but disclaiming for a Poet, fall in the very
first sentence upon a perfect Hexameter. I feel not in me those sordid, and
unchristian desires of my profession, I do not secretly implore and wish for
Plagues, rejoice at Famins, revolve Ephemerides, and Almanackes in expectation
of malignant effects, fatal conjunctions, and Eclipses: I rejoice not at
unwholesome Springs, nor unseasonable Winters, my Prayer goes with the
Husbandmans; I desire every thing in its proper season, that neither men nor
the times be out of temper.

Let me be sick my self, if sometimes the malady of my patient be not a
disease to me, I desire rather to cure his infirmities then my own
necessities, where I do him no good me thinks it is no honest gain, though I
confess it to be the worthy salary of our well-intended endeavors: I am not
only ashamed, but heartily sorry, that besides death, there are diseases
incurable, yet not for my own sake, or that they be beyond my art, but for the
general cause and sake of humanity whose common cause I apprehend as mine own:
And to speak more generally, those three Noble professions which al civil
Common wealths do honor, are raised from the fall of Adam, and are not any
exempt from their infirmities; there are not only diseases incurable in
Physic, but cases indissoluble in Laws, Vices incorrigible in Divinity: if
general Counsels may err, I do not see why particular Courts should be
infallible, their perfectest rules are raised upon the erroneous reasons of
Man, and the Laws of one, do but condemn the rules of another; as Aristotle
the fourth figure, because, though agreeable to reason, yet was not consonant
to his own rules, and the Logic of his proper principles. Again, to speak
nothing of the sin against the Holy Ghost, whose cure not only, but whose
nature is unknown; I can cure the gout or stone in some, sooner then Divinity,
Pride, or Avarice in others. I can cure vices by Physic, when they remain
incurable by Divinity, and shall obey my pills, when they contemn their
precepts. I boast nothing, but plainly say, we all labor against our own
cure, for death is the cure of all diseases. There is no Catholicon or
universal remedy I know but this, which though nauseous to queasie stomachs,
yet to prepared appetites is Nectar and a pleasant potion of immortality. For
my conversation, it is like the Sun without all men, and with a friendly aspect
to good and bad. Me thinks, there is no man bad, and the worst, best; that is,
w^ile they are kept within the circle of those qualities, wherein they are
good, there is no man's mind of such discordance, and of so jarring a temper to
which a tuneable disposition will not strike a harmony.

Magnae virtutes, nec minora vitia, it is the posie of the best natures, and
may be inverted on the worst, there are in the most depraved and venomous
dispositions, certain pieces which remain untoucht, which by an
Antiperistasis become more excellent, or by the excellency of their antipathies
are able to preserve themselves from the contagion of their enemy vices, and
persist entire beyond the general corruption. For it is also thus in natures.
The greatest Balsames do lie enveloped in the bodies of powerful Corrasives:
I say moreover, and I ground upon experience, that poisons contain within
themselves their own Antidotes* and which preserve them from the venom of
themselves, without which they were not deletorious to others only, but to
themselves also. But it is the corruption that I fear within me, and the
contagion of commerce without me. It is that unruly Regiment within that will
destroy: It is I that do insert my self the man without a Navell, who yet
lives in me. I feel that original canker corrode and devour me, and
therefore Defienda me Dios de me, Lord deliver me from my self, is part of my
Letany, and a first voice of my retired imaginations: there is no man alone,
because every man is a Microcosme, and carries the whole world about him,
Nunquam minus solus quam cum solus, though it be the Apophthegme of a wise man,
is yet true in the mouth of a fool; for indeed, though in a Wilderness, a man
is never alone, not only because he is with himself, and his own thoughts,
but because he is with the devil, who ever consorts with our solitude, and is
that unruly rebel that musters up those disordered motions, which accompany
our sequestered imaginations: and to speak more narrowly, there is no such
thing as solitude, nor any thing that can be said to be alone, and by it self,
but God, who is his own circle, and can subsist by himself, all others besides
those dissimilary and Heterogeneous parts, which in a manner multiply the
natures, cannot subsist without the concourse of God, and the society of that
hand which does uphold their natures. In brief, there can be nothing truly
alone, and by its self, which is not truly one, and such is only God: All
others do transcend an unity, and so by consequence are many.

Now for my life, it is a miracle of thirty years, which to relate, were not a
History, but a piece of Poetry, and would sound to common ears like a fable;
for the world, I count it not an Inn, but an Hospital, and a place, not to
live, but to dye in. The world that I regard is my self, it is the Microcosme
of mine own frame, that I cast mine eye on; for the other, I use it but like
my Globe, and turn it round sometimes for my recreation.

Men that look upon my outside, perusing only my condition, and fortunes, do
err in my altitude; for I am above Atlas his shoulders. Let me not injure the
felicity of others, if I say I am the happiest man alive; I have that in me
that can convert poverty into riches, adversity into prosperity. I am more
invulnerable than Achilles, fortune has not one place to hit me; Coelum ruat,
come what will, Fiat voluntas tua, salves all, so that whatsoever happens, it
is but what our daily prayers desire. In brief, I am content, and what should
providence add more? Surely this is it we call happiness, and this do I
enjoy, with this I am happy in a dream, and as content to enjoy a happiness in
a fancy, as others in a more apparent truth and reality. There is surely a
nearer apprehension of any thing that delights each of us in our dreams, then
in our waked ^enses; with this I can be a King without a Crown, rich without
Royalty, in heaven, tho on earth, enjoy my friend and embrace him at a
distance, without which I cannot behold him, without this I were unhappy, for
my awaked judgment discontents me, ever whispering unto me, that I am from my
friend, but my friendly dreams in the night requite me, and make me think I am
within his arms. I thank God for my happy dreams, as I do for my good rest,
for there is a reflection in them to reasonable desires, and such as can be
content with a fit of happiness; and surely it is not a melancholy conceit to
think we are all asleep in this world, and that the conceits of this world,
are as meare dreams to those of the next, as the Phantasmes of the night; to
the conceit of the day. It is an equal delusion in both, and the one does but
seem to be the emblem or picture of the other; we are somewhat more then our
selves in our sleeps, and the slumber of the body seems to be but the waking
of our souls. It is the ligation of our ^ense; but the liberty of reason, our
awaking conceptions do not march the fancies of our sleeps. At my Nativity, my
Ascendant was the earthly sign of Scorpio, I was borne in the Planetary hour
of Saturn, and I think I have a piece of that Leaden Planet in me. I am no
way facetious, nor disposed for the mirth and galliardize of company, yet in
one dream I can compose a whole Comedy, behold the action in one dream,
apprehend the jests, and laugh my self awake at the conceits thereof; were my
memory as faithful as my reason is there fruitful, I would never study but in
my dreams, and this time also would I choose for my devotions, but our grosser
memories have then so little hold of our abstracted understandings, that they
forget the story, and can only relate to our awaked souls, a confused and
broken tale of that that has been past. Aristotle, who has written a
singular tract of sleep, has not thoroughly defined it, no^ yet Galen, though
he seem to have corrected it, for those Noctea^nbulones, though in their
sleep, do yet enjoy the action of their senses: we must therefore say that
there is something in us that is not in the jurisdiction of Morpheus; and that
those abstracted and ecstarick souls do walk about in their own corpse, as
spirits with the bodies they assume, wherein they seem to hear, see, and
feel, though indeed the organs are destitute of senses, and their natures of
those faculties that should inform them. Thus I observe that men oftentimes
upon the hour of their departure, do speak and reason above themselves. For
then the soul begins to be freed from the ligaments of the body, begins to
reason like her self, and to discourse in a strain above mortality. We term
death a sleep, and yet it is waking that kills us, and destroys those spirits
that are the house of life. It is that death by which we may be literally said
to dye daily, a death which Adam dyed before his mortality; a death whereby we
live a middle and moderating point between life and death* in fine, so like
death, I dare not trust it without my prayers, and an half adieu unto the
world; it is a fit time for devotion: I cannot therefore lay me down on my bed
without an oration, and without taking my farewell in a Colloquie with God.

The night is come like to the day,
Depart not thou great God away.
Let not my sins, black as the night,
Eclipse the luster of thy light.
Keep still in my Horizon, for to me,
The Sun makes not the day, but thee.
Thou whose nature cannot sleep,
On my temples centry keep;
Guard me^ against those watchful foes,
Whose eyes are open, while mine close.
Let not dreams my head infest,
But such as Jacobs temples blessed.
While I do rest, my soul advance,
Make me sleep a holy trance:
That I may take my rest being wrought,
Awake into some holy thought.
And with as active vigor run
My course, as does the nimble Sun.
Sleep is a death, O make me try,
By sleeping what it is to dye.
And down as gently lay my head.
On my Grave, as now my Bed.
Howere refreshed, great God let me
Awake again at last with thee.
And thus assured, behold I lie
Securely, or to wake or die.
These are my drowsy days, in vain
I do now wake to sleep again.
O come that hour, when I shall never
Sleep thus again, but wake for ever.
This is the dormitory I take to bedward, use no other Laudanum to sleep,
after which I close mine eyes in security, content to take my leave of the Sun,
and to sleep unto the Resurrection.

The method I would use in distributive justice, I also observe in commutative,
and keep a Geometrical proportion in both, whereby becoming equable to
others, I become unjust to my self, and supererogate that common principle, Do
as thou would be done unto thy self.

I was not borne unto riches, neither is it my Star to be wealthy; or if it
were, the freedom of my mind, and franknesse of my disposition, were able to
contradict and cross my fates: for to me avarice seems not so much a vice, as
a deplorable piece of madness; to conceive our selves Urinals, or be persuaded
that we are dead, is not so ridiculous, nor so many degrees beyond the power
of Hellebore, as this.

The opinions of theory and positions of men are not so void of reason, as
their practiced conclusion: some have held that Snow is black, that the earth
moves, that the soul is air, fire, water, but all this is Philosophy, and
there is no De^irium, if we do but speculate the folly and indisputable dotage
of avari^e to that subterraneous Idol, and God of the earth. I do confess I
am an Atheist, I cannot persuade my self to honor that the world adores,
whatsoever virtue its prepared Sublime may have within my body, it has no
influence nor operation without; I would not entertain a base design, or an
action that should call me villain, for the Indies, and for this only do I
love and honor my soul, and have, me thinks, two arms too few to embrace my
self. Aristotle is too severe, that will not allow us to be truly liberal
without wealth, and the bountiful hand of fortune; If this be true, I must
confess I am charitable only in my liberal intentions, and bountiful
well-wishes. But if the example of the Mite be not only an act of wonder, but
an example of the noblest charity, I can justly boast I am as charitable as
some who have built Hospitals, or erected Cathedrals: I have a private method
which others observe not, I take the opportunity of my self to do good, I
borrow occasion of charity from mine own necessities; I supply the wants of
others, when I am in most need my self, when I am reduced to the last tester,
I love to d^vide it to the poor, for it is an honest statagem to take the
advantage of our selves, and so to husband the acts of virtue, that where they
are defective in one circumstance, they may repay their want, and multiply
their goodness in another. I has not Peru in my desires, but a competence and
ability to perform those good works to which the Almighty has inclined my
nature. He is rich, who have enough to be charitable, and it is hard to be so
poor, that a noble mind may not find a way to this piece of goodness. He
that gives to the poor, lends to the Lord, there is more Rhetoric in that
one sentence then in a Library of Sermons, and indeed if those sentences were
understood by the Reader, with the same Emphasis as they are delivered by the
Author, we need not those Volums of instructions, but might be honest by an
Epitome. Upon this motion only I cannot behold a Beggar without relieving his
necessities with my purse, or his soul with my prayers; the scenicall and
accidental differences between us cannot make me forget that common and
untoucht part of us both, the soul being of the same alloy with our own,
whose Genealogy is God as well as ours, and in as fair a way to salvation, as
our selves. Statists that labor to conceive a Commonwealth without poverty,
do take away the object of charity, not understanding only the Commonwealth
of a Christian, but forgetting the prophecy of Christ.

Now there is another part of charity, which is the Basis and Pillar of this,
and that is the love of God, for whom we love our neighbor: for this I think
charity, to love God for himself, and our neighbor for God.

All that is truly amiable is God, or as it were a divided piece of him, that
retains a reflex or shadow of himself. Nor is it strange that we should place
affection on that which is invisible, all that we truly love is thus, what we
adore under affection of our senses, deserves not the honor of so pure a
title. Thus we adore virtue, though to the eyes of sense she be invisible. Thus
that part of our loving friends that we love, is not that part that we embrace;
but that insensible part that our arms cannot embrace. God being all
goodness, can love nothing but himself, he loves us but for that part, which
is as it were himself, and the traduction of his holy Spirit. Let us call to
assize the lives of our parents, the affection of our wives and children, and
they are all dumb shows, and dreams without reality, truth, or constancy;
for first thereis a strong bond of affection between us and our parents, yet
how easily dissolved we betake our selves to a woman, forgetting our mothers in
a wife, and the womb that bare us in that that shall bear our image? This
woman blessing us with children, our affections leaves the level it held
before, and sinkes from our bed unto our issue and picture of posterity, where
affection holds no steady mansion. They growing up in years desire our ends,
or applying themselves to a woman, take a lawful way to love another better
then our selves. Thus I conceive a man may be buried alive, and behold his
grave in his own issue.

I conclude therefore, and say that there is no happiness under (or as
Copernicus will have it, above) the Sun, in that repeated verity and burden of
all the wisdom of Solomon, All is vanity and vexation of spirit; there is no
felicity in that the world adores. Aristotle whilst he labors to refute the
Ideas of Plato, falls upon one himself, for his summum bonum, is a Chimaera,
and there is no such thing as his Felicity. That wherein God himself is happy,
the holy Angels are happy, in whose defects the devils are unhappy; that dare I
call happiness: whatsoever conduces unto this, may with an easy Metaphor
deserve that name, what soever else the world terms happiness, is to me a
story, or apparition, or neat delusion, wherein there is no more of happiness
then the name.

Bless me in this life with the peace of my conscience, command of my
affections, the love of my dearest friends, and I shall be happy enough to pity
Caesar.

These are O Lord happiness on earth wherein I set no rule or limit to thy
providence, dispose of me according to the justice of thy pleasure. Thy will be
done, though in mine own damnation.

FINIS.
