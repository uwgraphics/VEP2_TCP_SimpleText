A CONGRATULATORY POEM TO THE King's Most Sacred Majesty, etc.
JOY to the Greatest MONARCH of the Earth!
As many Joys as this Illustrious BIRTH
Has Elevated Hearts! As Endless too,
As are the VOWS we Offer up for You.
"Oh Happy KING! to whom a SON is Born!
"What more could Heaven for this B^ss'd Land perform?
Long with Prophetic Fire, Resolved and Bold,
Your Glorious FATE and FORTUNE I foretold.
I saw the Stars that did attend Your REIGN,
And how they Triumphed over Great Charles's Wain.
Far off I saw this HAPPY DAY Appear;
This Iubilee, not known this Fifty Year.
This Day foretold, ( Great SIR!) that gives you more
Than even Your Glorious Virtues did before.
No MONARCH's Birth was ever Ushered in
With Signs so Fortunate as this has been.
The Trinity Sunday.
Holy Trinity his BIRTHDAY claims,
Who to the World their best Loved Blessing sends.
Guarded he comes, in Triumph over FATE,
And all the Shining HOST around him wait.
Angels and Saints, that do his Train Adorn,
In Hallelujahs Sing, A KING IS BORN!
Blessed St. Margaret 's Day.
MARGARET, Scotlands Royal Saint and Queen,
The last Great Branch of all the Saxon Line,
Waits on this HAPPY BIRTH; and does Declare
He, in her Right to Saxons, is the HEIR.
^n the Famed Room, by happy Fate brought forth,
Where Charles II. James II.
Two Illustrious KINGS received their Birth.
The LESSONS for This Day, The Morning Lesson for the Day.
by Chance Divine,
Appeared as they were Ordered by Design.
The First, the Holy PROPHET did Unfold
When he the Birth of the MESSIAH told.
The Words are These; Matthew. 3. 12.
His Fan is in his Hand,
And he shall thoroughly purge the Floor or Land,
Gathering the Wheat into the Granary:
Then all One FAITH, at least One SOUL shall be.
"The ANGEL next the PATRIARCH did Inform, The Evening Lesson, Genesis 18. 80.

"That ISAAC, Chosen ISAAC, should be Born.
ASTROLOGERS Divine! that when the Sun
Is Mounted to his Full Meridian,
It Is Lucky to be Born; and does Portend
Long Life, that can by no Misfortune end.
This, in its Summer- Solstice views the Light,
Breaks out, and makes our Longest Day more Bright.
Methinks I hear the Belgic LION Roar,
And Lash his Angry Tail against the Shore.
Enraged to hear a PRINCE OF WALES is Born:
Whose BROWS his Boasted Laurels shall Adorn.
Whose Angel FACE already does express
His Foreign CONQVESTS, and Domestic PEACE.
While in his Awful little EYES we Fined
He Is of the Brave, and the Forgiving KIND.
All Joy Great QVEEN! -- if to your Happy Store
Our Grateful Prayers, and Wishes can add more.
Your Blessed DELIVERANCE to Congratulate,
The Adoring World is Prostrate at your Feet.
Where TEARS of Joy, and Humble VERSE I lay
Too mean a Trophy for this GLORIOUS DAY:
Inspired by Nothing but Prophetic Truth,
They Boast no other Fire, no other Worth.
Full of the JOY, no LINES Correct can write,
My Pleasure's too Extreme for Thought or Wit.
Charmed to Excess, alas! I strive in Vain,
in Scanty VERSE my Transports to Explain
Too Vast for Narrow NVMBERS to Contain.
FINIS.
On Wednesday next will be Published the most Ingenious, and long Expected
History of Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave. By Mrs. Behn.
