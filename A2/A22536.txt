By the King. A Proclamation forbidding the disorderly Trading with the
Saluages in New England in America, especially the furnishing of the Natives in
those and other parts of America by the English with Weapons, and Habiliments
of War.
WHereas a Proclamation was heretofore published by Our dear Father King JAMES
of blessed memory, in the twentieth year of His Reign, for the better
supportation and Reiglement of the Plantations within Our Territory of New
England in America, whereby, amongst diverse other things, the insufferable
abuses committed by diverse Interloping and irregular Merchants, and disobedient
Fishermen and Mariners, were prohibited, who seeking only their present and
private profit, did Trade with the Saluages of that Country, and to the great
prejudice and danger of Our loving Subjects the Planters there, did Barter away
to the Saluages, Swords, Pikes, Muskets, Fowling Pieces, Match, Powder, Shot,
and other Warlike Arms, Weapons, and Munition, and teach them the use thereof,
not only to their own present ruin (diverse of them having been slaughtered
by the barbarous people with their own Weapons formerly sold by them) but also
to the great hazard of the lives of the English already, planted there, and to
the apparent destruction of that hopeful Plantation.

We, being informed that these abuses are still continued to the indangering
of that Plantation, and that the like abuses are also practiced in other
Foreign Plantations: Out of Our Princely care for the prosperity of these
Colonies, which being well governed may be of great use to this Nation, for the
reformation and prevention of these and the like enormities for the future.

And to the end that the Royal Grant of Our late Father to the President and
Counsel of New England aforesaid, may be maintained and vpholden, and that
the Planters there, and adventurers thither, may be encouraged by all good
ways and means to proceed in their worthy designs, have thought it fit, and
do hereby straightly charge and command, That none of Our Subjects whatsoever
(who are not Adventurers, Inhabiters, or Planters, authorized by Our President
and Counsel for New England, according to the said Letters Patents) do
presume from henceforth to frequent those Coasts to Trade or Traffic at all
with the Native people of those Countries, or to intermeddle with the Woods, or
Grounds of any of the Planters, or English Inhabitants there, otherwise then by
the License of the said President and Counsel, or for the necessary use of
their Fishing on those Coasts, in which case of Fishing, or under color
thereof, they are not to use any Trade or Traffic there, nor to challenge any
Right to the Soil there, or the Woods growing or being thereon, and
especially We do charge and command, that neither any Interlopers,
Fishermen, or Mariners, or any other of Our Subjects whatsoever, being of the
said Company of New England or otherwise, do at any time hereafter dare to
Sell, Barter, or any ways to deliver or convey unto any of the Saluages or
Natives of America, where any of Our English Colonies are or shall be planted,
any Weapons or Habiliments of War of any kind whatsoever, or to teach them
or any of them the use of Gunnes, or how to make or amend them, or any thing
belonging to them, upon pain of Our high indignation, and the Confiscation,
Penalties and Forfeitures expressed in the said Royal Grant of Our said
Father, wherein We shall proceed against those who have offended, or shall
offend in any of the premises, in such manner and measure as the quality of
their Offenses shall deserve. And yet further We leave it to the discretion of
the said President and Counsel for New England, and to other the Governors
and Counsel in any other Foreign English Colonie in their several places
respectively, to proceed against the Offenders in any the kinds aforesaid,
according to the powers already granted unto them, and according to Our Laws
in that behalf.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the four and twentieth day of November, in
the sixth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1630.
