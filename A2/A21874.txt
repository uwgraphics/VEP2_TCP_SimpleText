By the Queen.
WHereas heretofore sundry ways have been devised to redress the disorders
among the Posts of our Realm in general, and particularly to prevent the
inconveniences both to our own service, and the lawful trade of the honest
marchantes, by prohibiting that no persons whatsoever, should take upon them
publicly or privately to procure, gather up, receive, bring in, or carry out,
any Packets or letters to or from the Countries beyond the Seas, except such
our ordinary Posts and Messengers for those parties, as either by our Master
of the Posts, or the Masters of the Posts general of those Countries
reciproquely, should be found nominated for that kind of service, or otherwise
be able to show sufficient warrant for their voyages and dispatches under the
hands of our principal Secretaries, any Ambassadors, or others sufficiently
authorized: which notwithstanding, diverse disauowed persons have used to
intrude themselves contrary to all good order. In consideration of which
incoueniences past, we do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all persons
whatsoever, directly or indirectly to gather up, receive, bring in, or carry
out of this Realm, any Letters or Packets, without the allowance or ordinary
address and dispatch of the said Masters and Comptrollers of the Posts
reciproquely, or their deputies, or shall be sufficiently authorized as is
aforesaid. And therefore our will and pleasure is, that you the Lord
Treasourer of England, and the Lord warden of the Cinque-Portes, together with
our trusty and well be loved servant John Stanhop Esquire, Master and
Comptroller general of all our Posts, cause public knowledge to be given
hereof unto all Merchants, both Strangers and others of our City of London,
and all others whom it may or ought to concern, that neither they nor any for
them do hereafter take upon them, openly or underhand to employ any disauowed
person in the carrying of their Letters, but to use such only as shall be found
lawfully appointed for that service. To which effect also we do expressly will
and command by these presents, all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace,
Bailiffes, and all special Commissioners, and more specially all Searchers,
Customers and Comptrollers of our Ports, and all other our Officers and
Ministers wheresoever in their several jurisdictions and offices, to make
diligent search of all Males, Bougets, and other Cariages of all such disauowed
Curriers, Messengers, or suspected persons coming in or going out of the
Realm with Packettes or Letters, and all such so discovered, to apprehend and
stay, keeping them in safe custody, until by the view of their writings sent
up to our privy Counsel, it be seen and advised what shall be further done
with them.

Signed at our Manor of Greenwich the 26, day of April, 1591. in the 33.
year of our reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
