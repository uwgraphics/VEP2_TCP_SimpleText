By the King.
FOrasmuch as the Kings Majesty our Sovereign Lord is credibly informed, that
the infection of the Plague is at this present in sundry places in and about
the City of London, and in other places near adjoining to the same, Whereas
by the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of his
loving Subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto his most
royal Person, but also to his most loving Subjects repairing thither for their
suites and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of the same
into other parts of the Realm: His Majesty for the said necessary
considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of Almighty God
with the coldness of the year, and such wholesome Orders as are taken in his
said City, the rather cease by the adiournment of part of this next Term of
Saint Michael now at hand, from the Vtas of the same, until the fourth return
of the said Term, called Mense Michaelis next coming, His Majesty therefore
of his especial favor and clemency is pleased and contented to adiourne the
said Term of Saint Michael (that is to say) from the Vtas thereof, unto the
said fourth return of the said Term called Mense Michaelis next coming,
which his Majesty signifies to all and singular his loving Subjects of this
his Realm, to the intent that they and every of them which has cause or
commandment to appear in any of his Highness Courts at Westminster in or at
any day or time from and after the said Vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at
their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall lie, without
resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause before the said Mense
Michaelis next coming, and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or
contempt to incur toward his Highness in that behalf. And nevertheless,
his Majesty's pleasure is, that two of his Justices, (that is to say) of either
Bench one, shall the first day of Michaelmas Term, called Octabis Michaelis,
according to the ancient order of the Laws, keep the Essoines of the said
Octabis Michaelis: at which Vtas of Saint Michael, writs of adiournment shall be
directed to the said Justices, giving them authority to adiourne the said Term
of Saint Michael (that is to say,) From the Vtas thereof, until the fourth
return, as before is said: And the said Adiournment shall be made in the first
day of the said Vtas, commonly called the day of Essoines. And further his
Majesty's pleasure is, that all matters, causes and Suits depending in any of
his other Courts between party and party, as in his Highness Courts of
Chancerie, Starchamber, and Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, Duchy of
Lancaster, and Court of Requests, shall have continuance, and the parties shall
have day from the date of these presents until the said fourth Return, as
before is said.

Provided always, and his Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs and other Accomptants, and all other Persons
that should or ought to account or pay any Sum or Sums of money in any of
his Majesty's Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, and of his
Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any Account in any of
the said Courts, shall repair unto his Majesty's house of Richmond, where his
Highness has appointed such Officers and Ministers, as for that purpose his
Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every behalf, as
though no such Proclamation of Adiournement had been had or made. And his
Highness further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs shall
return their Writs and Process, against all such Accomptants and Debtors, at
the days therein appointed. And if any Person or Persons who ought to account
or pay any Sum or Sums of money to his Majesty in any of the Courts and
places aforesaid, do make default therein, That then his Highness Writs and
Process shall be awarded and sent forth against every such Person and Persons,
and the same to be duly and orderly served, and returned by the Sheriffs and
Officers thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form, as the same should
have been if this present Proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff
or other Officer shall make default, or be negligent in serving, executing, or
returning of any the Writs and Process aforesaid, That then every such Sheriff
and other Officer, shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the said
Courts or any of them shall be taxed and assessed. Willing and commanding all
and every his Majesty's Sheriffs, Officers, Ministers and Subjects to whom it
does or shall appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and
Apparances, with all their Returns and Certificates, in his Highness said
Courts at Westminster in Mense Michaelis next coming, then and there to be
holden and kept, and there to do their offices and duties in every behalf,
in like manner and form as they should or ought to have done, if this present
Proclamation had not been had or made, as they will answer to the contrary
at their perils.

Given his Majesty's Manor of Woodstocke the sixteenth day of September 1603.
in the first year of his Highness Reign of England, France and Ireland, and
of Scotland the seven and thirtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty, Anno. 1603.
