By the King. A Proclamation for preservation of Grounds for making of
Saltpeter, and to restore such grounds as are now destroyed, and to command
Assistance to be given to His Majesty's Saltpeter-Makers.
ALthough by Our former Proclamations We have declared the most necessary and
important use of Gunpouder, as well for supply of Our own Navy Royal and the
shipping of Our loving Subjects, as otherwise for the defense, strength and
safety of Our people and Kingdoms, and how great a blessing it is of Almighty
God to this Realm, that it naturally yields sufficient Mines of Saltpeter
for making of Gunpowder, without any necessity to depend upon the dangerous,
chargeable and casual supplies from Foreign parts: Yet notwithstanding, We
are informed, that diverse of our Subjects of this Realm have been so far
from the apprehension of the care We have and take of the Kingdoms safety, That
they have of late times sundry Ways much more impaired and destroyed the
growth and Mines of Saltpeter, then formerly: But howeuer, as We in Our
Princely care, will not omit any providence against what inconveniences may
ensue, so must We not endure the contempts of such as be disobedient Subjects,
but (by reviving as well that Proclamation, of the six and twentieth day of
December, one thousand six hundred twenty four, published by Our late dear
father, concerning Saltpeter, as that which sithence was published in the first
year of Our Reign) Let all sorts of Delinquents know that We intend strictly
to proceed against them according to the several branches thereof, for all
offenses contrary to the Tenor of the same, since the promulgation thereof,
without respect of any person: saving that We think fit to declare that We
will not have any sacred ground be Stirred, Dug, or Opened, by authority of
any Commission granted or to be granted for this service. And the better to
meet with all offenders in this behalf, We have lately Granted Our Special
Commission to diverse of the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, to whom we
have committed the trust and care of that important service; Giving them full
power and authority, as well to assist Our Saltpeter-Makers, and their Deputies,
in their lawful proceedings in that employment for such Our especial service,
as also upon complaint made unto them, or some of them, and due proof thereof
made, to give speedy reformation to all impediments and mischiefs concerning
the same.

And to take away all pretense of ignorance of Our Royal pleasure in this
behalf, We by the advice of the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, do
again publish and declare, and hereby strictly charge and command all Our
Subjects of whatsoever estate, degree, or condition, That no person or persons
whatsoever within this Our Kingdom of England, or Dominion of Wales, do from
henceforth paue with stone, or brick, or Floor with board any Doue-house, or
Doue-coate, or any such warehouse, or outhouses, as are allowed by Our
Commission, to be wrought for Saltpeter, or any Cellar, or Vault, (excepting
only in that part of the Cellar or Vault where the Beer lies, and excepting
such Cellars and Vaults only, wherein Noblemen and Gentlemen of revenue and
quality, do lay or draw their wine, beer, or cider, or other drink for the
provision of their household) or do lay the same with lime, sand, gravel, or
other thing, whereby the growth and increase of the Mine of Saltpeter may be
hindered or impaired, but shall suffer the floor or ground of the places
aforesaid, to lie open with good and mellow earth, apt to breed increase of the
said Mine, and Saltpeter, and so continue the same.

And that no Inkeepers or others, that keep Stables for trauailers and
passengers, do use any deceitful means or devices, whereby to destroy or
hinder the growth of Saltpeter in those stables, and that no stables at all
(other then the stables of the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal, and of
Gentlemen of quality) be found pitched, paued, or grauelled, where the horse
feet use to stand, but plancked only, nor be paued, pitched, or grauelled
before the planckes next the maungers, but that both places be kept and
maintained with good and mellow earth, fit and apt to breed and increase the
Mine of Saltpeter, and be laid with nothing which may hinder or hurt the same.
And likewise that all and every such person and persons, as having heretofore
since the last Proclamation had any Doue-house, Doue-coat, Stable, Cellar,
Vault, Warehouse, or other Outhouses, (which were then good Nurceries for the
breed of the Mine of Saltpeter) have sithence carried out the good mould from
thence, and filled the place again with lyme, gravel, sand, rubbish or other
like stuff; or paued, boarded, or plancked the same, whereby the Grouth of the
Mine of Saltpeter there has been decayed or destroyed, shall and do within
two months next coming, take up the said pauements, boards, or plankes
again, and carry out the said gravel, lyme, and other stuff from thence, and
fill the place again with good and mellow earth, fit for the increase of
Saltpeter three foot deep at the least, and so continue and keep the same for
the breed of Saltpeter Mine.

And for as much as We are further advertised, that it is grown of late to a
frequent practice, to erect Douehouses, or to floor them three or four foot
from the ground, whereby the quantity of the Mine of Saltpeter, which was
usually wont to grow in the Floor of Douehouses, is almost wholly decayed to
the great prejudice of Our said service, and which in time will be a means to
overthrow this work: Our Will and pleasure is, and We do hereby straightly
charge and command that such Douehouses be forthwith by the present Owners or
Occupiers thereof altered and amended, by demolishing and pulling up those
Floores and false bottomes, and by laying those Douehouses open and free to the
bare earth or ground, whereby the Mine of Saltpeter may grow and increase,
according as anciently has been used and accustomed, and that from henceforth,
no other or more Douehouses be erected or suffered to be built after that way,
or upon any upper lofts or Floores, so much tending to the prejudice of that
which should be serviceable to the Common wealth.

And to the end that our Royal will and pleasure may from time to time
hereafter be more duly observed in the premises, We do hereby require and
command all and every Our Justices of Peace, and all other Our Officers
whatsoever, That they and every of them, upon request to them made by Our
Saltpeter-Makers, or their Deputies authorized in that behalf, or any of them,
do resort and enter into, and make search in all Douehouses, Cellars, Vaultes,
outhouses and Stables (other then as aforesaid) there to view and see, whether
they be so Paued, Grauelled, or otherwise so built, Floored or bottomed from
the ground as aforesaid, Or any other way or means practiced, in deceit, or
evasion, or contrary to any the Proclamations of Us or Our late Fathers,
published in that behalf: And thereupon to take order and see that a full and
due reformation be thereof speedily had and made, according to Our Command
herein, and in Our former Proclamations declared and published in that behalf.

Lastly for that notwithstanding all Our care and providence, We may justly
suspect, that there will still be discovered some refractorie persons in this
behalf, Therefore We do hereby require and authorize all Our Judges of Assise
in their several Circuits, Justices of Peace in every several County of this
Kingdom, Majors, Sherifes, Bailifes, Constables and all other Our Officers and
Ministers from time to time, as occasion shall require, to be furthering,
helping, aiding and assisting to Our Saltpeter-Makers, and their deputies, upon
request in that behalf made, according to the Tenor of Our said Commission,
and the effect of this and the former mentioned Proclamations of Our Father,
and of Our self.

And We do hereby straightly charge and command all manner of persons whatsoever
carefully and diligently to observe and perform the said Proclamations before
mentioned, and Our Royal pleasure therein expressed, as they and every of
them will avoid Our heavy displeasure, and the censure of being holden
contemners of Our Royal Commandment, in a matter of so high consequence for
the public service and safety of Our State and Kingdom, and upon such further
penalties and punishments, as for example to others, their contempts and want
of duty shall demerit and in Our High Court of Starchamber or otherwise shall
be found fit to be imposed upon them.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the foureteenth day of March in the tenth
year of Our Reign of England, Scotland, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1634.
