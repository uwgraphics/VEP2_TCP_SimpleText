1. A Cock, as he turned over a dunghill, found a pearl: saying, Why do I find a
thing so bright?

2. If the jeweller had found it, none would have been more glad than he; as
being one that could tell the worth of it.

3. It is indeed of no use to me, nor do I much value it: nay truly, I had
rather have a barley-corn than all the Pearls in the World.

4. The Moral. Vnderstandly the Pearl, Art and Wisdom: and by the Cock a dotish
man, and one that is given to pleasure.

5. Neither do blockish people love the Liberal Arts, seeing they know not the
use of them; nor a voluptuous person; because he delights only in pleasure.

2. Of the Wolf and the Lamb.
1. A Wolf, drinking at a springhead, saw a Lamb drinking a great way below.

2. He ran to it, and chid the Lamb; because it muddied the Spring.

3. The Lamb trembled, and humbly besought him, that he would spare an innocent.

4. Saying, that he, because he drank a great way below, could not indeed muddy
the W^ve's drink. much less would he.

5. The Wolf rails aloud on the contrary: Thou varlet, thou had a^ good do
nothing: thou art always opposing me; thy fire, thy dam, and all thy kind whom
I cannot abide to see, do what thy can to cross me.

6. I will punish thee to day.

7. Mor. It is an old saying. It is an easy thing to find a stick to beat
(...) dog with.

8. A great man if h^^ist to hurt, does soon ^^ke an occasion to hurt.

9. He has offended sufficiently, that could (...) resist.

7. Which conflict being soon a far off, the Kite makes haste, and whilst* for
eagerness of fighting, neither looks to himself, the Kite snatcheth an^ pulls
in pieces both the warriors.

8. Mor. Just so it uses to befall factious Citizens, who being inflame^ with
a lust of ruling, whilst they strive amongst themselves to become Officer^ put
their wealth, and for the most part their life in hazard.

4. Of the Dog and the Shadow.
1. A Dog swimming over a River carried a piece of flesh in his mouth: wh^ the
Sun shone, so as it often falls out, the shadow of the flesh shone in (...)
water, at which, when he saw it, he caught greedily, and lost what was in his
chap*

2. And therefore being daunted with the loss both of the thing, and of (...)
hope, at the first he stood amazed, and afterward recovering his spirit, (...)
barkt out thus. Poor dog, thy desire had no mean.

3. Thou had enough and too much, unless thou had been mad; and (...)
through thine own folly thou have less than nothing.

4. Mor. By this little tale, we are put in mind of moderation, we are (...) in
mind of discretion, that there be a mean to our desire, (...) we lose
certain^ties for uncertainties.

5. Verily that Sannio in Terence says wittily, I will not buy a Pig in a Po^

5. Of the Lion and some other Beasts.
1. THe Lion had covenanted with the Sheep and some others, that the pr^ should
be common.

2. They go a hunting: a stag is taken: they divide it.

3. When several parties began to take the several pieces as they had agree^
the Lion roared saying, One part is mine, because I am the most worthy.

4. Likewise another is mine, because I am the strongest.

5. Furthermore, I challenge a third part, because I have swet more taking the
Heart.

6. Lastly, unless you will grant me a fourth part, farewell friendsh^^

7. His fellows (when they heard this) went away empty and holding (...) peace,
not da^ing to mutter against the Lion.

8. Mor. Faith has always been rare, in this age it is more rare, it (...) is
and always has been very rare amongst great men.

9. Wherofore it is better, to live with thy like.

10. For he that lives with a mightier man than himself, is necess^^ (...)
oftimes to forgo his own right.

11. Thou shall have equal dealing with thy equal.

2. He goes about, he entreats help, but no body helps him.

4. At the last, he persuades the Crane with many fair words, and more
promises; that with her great long neck, being put into his throat, she would
take out the bone that stuck in it.

5. But he mocked her, when she desired something for her pains; Thou fool
(quoth he) go thy way, have thou not enough that thou live? Thou art
beholding to me for thy life.

6. If I had listed, I might have bit off thy neck.

7. Mor. It is an old saying, that it is thrown away, which thou do to an
ungrateful person.

1. A Countryman brought home a Snake which he had found in the Snow almost
starved to death and laid it before the fire.

2. The Snake recovering strength and poison from the fire, and afterward not
abiding the heat, filled all the Cottage with hissing.

3. The Countryman, having got up an Hedge-stake, runs to him, and takes him
up roundly for the wrong done him, both with words and strokes.

4. Would he thus requite him?

5. Would he offer to take away his life that had given him life?

6. Mor. It sometimes comes to pass, that they do thee hurt, whom thou have
done good to; and deserve ill at thy hands, from whom thou have well deserved.

8. Of the Boar and Ass.
1. WHilst the idle Ass mocked the Boar, he chafed at him and gnasht his teeth.

2. Thou very idle Ass, thou have deserved smart; but although thou art worthy
of punishment, yet I scorn to punish thee.

3. Mock on and spare not, thou may do it scot-free.

4. For thou art safe, because of thy idleness.

5. Mor. Let us endeavor, that when we bear or endure things that do not
beseem us, we may not speak or do things that do not beseem us.

6. For naughty and ungracious persons, for the most part, are glad if any good

contempt.

9. Of the City-Mouse and Country-Mouse.

2. The Country-Mouse saw her, and invites her home, gets things ready, and
they go to supper.

3. The Country-Mouse fetches out whatsoever she had laid up against Winter,
and brings out all her store, that she might satisfy the daintiness of such a
great guest.

4. Notwithstanding the City-Mouse knitting her brows, condemns the poorness of
the Country, and withal commends the plenty of the City.

5. As she goes back, she brings the Country-Mouse with her into the City; that
she might make good in deed, what she had bragged of in words.

6. They go to the Feast, which the City-Mouse had gallantly provided.

7. As they are at their cheer, the noise of the Key is heard in the lock.

8. They trembled, and ran away as fast as they could.

9. The Country-Mouse being both unused to it, and unacquainted with the place,
had much ado to save her self.

10. When the servant was gone away, the City-Mouse comes again to the table,
and invites the Country-Mouse.

11. He creeps out of his hole. having scarcely got shut of his fear, at the
last.

12. He asks the City-Mouse that invited him to drink, whether this danger was
often or no.

13. He made answer, that it was every day, and ought to be slighted.

14. Then quoth the Country-Mouse, Is it every day?

15. Truly thy dainties have more bitter than sweet in them.

16. Indeed I had rather have my want with security, than that abundance with
such trouble of mind.

17. Mor. Riches indeed make show of pleasure, but if you look into them, they
contain danger and bitterness.

18. There was one Eutrapelus, who when he would do his enemies the greatest
mischief, made them rich, using to say, he thus took revenge on them; for they
were like to receive with their Riches a great burden of cares.

10. Of the Eagle and Jack-Daw.
1. AN Eagle having got a Cockle could not get out the fish by force or art.

2. A Jack-daw coming to her, gives her counsel.

3. He persuades her to fly upwards, and to throw down the Cockle from on high
upon the Rocks, for so it would come to pass, that the shell would be broken.

4. The Jack-daw tarries on the ground to watch for it is fall, the Eagle throws
it down, the shell is broken, the Jack-daw snatcheth up the Fish, the Eagle is
sorry to see her self couzened.

5. Mor. Do not trust every body; and be sure thou ^eest into the Counsel which
thou take of others.

6. For many being asked their advice, do not give advice for them that ask
them, but for themselves.

11. Of the Raven and the Fox.
1. A Raven having got a prey, croaked amongst the boughs.

2. A Fox saw her hopping to and fro, he runs to her.

3. The Fox, quoth he, bids the Raven many good morrows.

4* I had often heard, that Hearsay was a lier, and now I find it to be so
indeed.

5. For as I came this way by chance espied you in the tree, I make have
toward you and blame the rumor.

6. For the report goes; that you are as black as pitch, and I see you are
whither than Snow.

7. In mine opinion truly you outstrip the Swans, and are fairer than the pale
Ivy.

8. And if you excel in your voice, as you do in your feathers, truly I would
say, yet were the Queen of Birds.

9. The Raven, being allured with this flattering tale, makes her ready to sing.

10. But the Cheese f^ll out of her bill as she made her ready, which when he
had snatched up, the Fox sets up a laughter.

11. Then the poor Raven was ashamed and vexed at her self, and was grieved for
the loss of the thing, blushing at it withal.

12. Mor. Some are so greedy of commendation, that they love a flatterer to
their shame and loss; such men are a prey to flatterers.

13. But if you will avoid boasting, you may easily avoid that plaguey kind of
flatterers.

14. If thou will be Thraso, thou shall not want a Gnatho.

12. Of the Lion that was past his strength for age.
1. A Lion, which in his youth had made many his enemies through his
fierceness, was punished for it in his old age.

2. The Beasts pay him in his kind, the Boar gnasheth him with his tushes, and
the Bull goars him with his horns.

3. But especially the little Ass, being desirous to put away the old name of
slothfulness insults over him in words and kicks him lustily.

4. Then the Lion, sighing, said, These whom I have long ago done hurt to, now
do me hurt, as I did them, and good cause why: but those whom I have sometimes
done good to, now do me no good as I did them; nay, indeed they set themselves
against me without any cause.

5 I have been a fool to make many my enemies, but a greater fool to trust to
false friends.

6. Mor. In prosperity be not lifted up: be not cursed.

7. For if fortune change her Face, they, whom thou have done hurt to will be
revenged on thee.

8. And see thou put a difference amongst thy friends.

9. For there are some friends that are not thine, but thy table's, and thy
fortune's; which fortune so soon as it shall be altered, they will be altered
too.

10. Thou shall be well dealt withal, if they be not thine enemies.

11. Ovid complains not without cause.

Lo I, that erst had many friends,
Whilst with the wind and tide I went;
As soon as ever the sea did swell.
Was left 'ith midst with vessel rent.
13. Of the Dog and the Ass.
1. WHilst the Dog fawned upon the Master and the Family, the Master and the
Family cherished the Dog.

2. The little Ass seeing that, fetched a deep sigh; it begun to irk him of his
condition: He thought it was not fairly carried, that the Dog should be welcome
to all, and be fed at his Master's Table and get that by idleness and play: and
that he on the contrary, should bear pack-saddles, should be beaten with a
whip^ should never be out of work; and yet be hated of every body.

3. If these things were done with fawning, he resolved to follow that trade
which was so profitable.

4. Therefore to try the matter, he runs to meet his Master one time, as he was
coming home again; he leaps upon him and knocks him with his hoofs.

5. When the Master cried out, the servants ran to him; and the foolish Ass
that thought he was mannerly, was beaten with a cudgel.

6. Mor. We cannot all do all things as Virgil says, in his Bucolicks: no^ do
all things become all persons.

7. Let every one covet that, let him strive to do that; which he can do.

8. For we know that, which is more signifi cantly said in Greek, Onos Ly^^ an
Ass of Harps [or of an Harp] but Boethius has it thus. An Ass set t^ an Harp.

9. Labor is vain, if nature be against it: Nor say, nor do, thy nature bing
averse, as Horace witnesses.

14. Of the Lion and the Mouse.
1. A Lion being weary with heat and running, rested him under a shadow upon
the green leaves.

2. And as a company of mice ran over his back* he awaked, and caught^ one of
many.

3. The prisoner humbly beseeches him, and cries, that she is unfit with who^
the Lion should be angry.

4. And he considering, that there was no commendation to be got, by kil^ing
such a little small beast, lets the prisoner go.

5. Not very long after, the Lion by chance, as he ran along the Fore^ lights
into the Nets; he might roar, but he could not get out.

6. The Mouse hears the Lion roaring pitifully, she knows his voice, she cre^
into the holes under ground, she seeks for the knots of the snares: she finds
the^ having sought for them; she knaws them in pieces when she found them. Thu^
the Lion escapes out of the Nets.

7. Mor. This Fable persuades clemency to great Men.

8. For, as humane affairs are inconstant, sometimes great men themselves want
the help of the meanest.

9. Wherefore a discreet man, though he can, will be loath to hurt a me^^ body;
but he that is not loath to hurt another, is exceeding foolish.

10. Why so? Because, though whilst he presumes upon his power, he fears body;
yet perhaps, time will come, that he may fear.

11. For it is certain, it has befallen renowned and great Kings, that eith^^
they have stood in need of the favor of mean Persons or been afraid of the
displeasure.

15. Of the sick Kite.
1. A Kite kept her bed, being just ready to dye.

2. She entreats her dam to go and pray to God for her.

3. Her dam answered, she could expect no help from God, whose holy thi^^ and
Altars she had so often desiled with her ravenings.

4. Mor. It behooves us to reverence God; for he helps the godly, and
withstandeth the ungodly.

5. Being slighted in prosperity, he hears not in adversity.

6. Wherefore in prosperity think on him, that he may be ready when he is
called on in adversity.

16. Of the Swallow and other Birds.
1. AS soon as ever the Line was begun to be sown, the Swallow persuades the
small birds to hinder the sowing; saying, that snares were making for them.

2. They mock her, and call the Swallow a foolish Prophet.

3. When the Line was now grown up, and green, she advises them again to pull
up the crop by the roots.

4. They mock her again.

5. The Line waxes ripe, she exhorts them to spoil the crop as it stood.

6. And when they would not hear her then neither giving them advice, the
Swallow, having left the birds company gets into man's favor; she makes a
league with him, dwells with him, and cheers him with her song.

7. Nets and snares were made of the Line for the other birds.

8. Mor. Many neither know how to advise themselves, nor do they hear one that
gives them good advice.

9. But when they undergo dangers and losses, then at the last they begin to be
wise, and to blame their own want of wit.

10. Then they have enough and too much advice: This and that (quoth they)
should have been done.

11. But it is better to be Prometheus, than Epimetheus.

12. These were brethren: their names are Grecian.

13. The one had advice before a thing, and the other after a thing: which the
Etymology of their names does manifest.

17. Of the Frogs and their King.
1. THe nation of the Frogs, when it was free, besought Jupiter that they might
have a King given them.

2. Jupiter laughed at the petition of the Frogs.

3. Yet they pressed often upon him, till they made him to do it whether he
would or no.

4. He threw down a great Clog.

5. That heavy thing makes a great plunge in the River.

6. The Frogs being affrighted, hold their peace: they do homage to their King.

7. They come nearer by little and little: at the last, having cast away fear
they leap upon it, and leap down from it.

8. The idle King is a sport and a scorn to them.

9. They petition Jupiter again; they entreat they may have a King given them
that may be valorous.

10. Jupiter gives them ae Stork.

11. He, walking very stoutly up and down the Fen, devours what ever of the
Frogs come in his way.

12. Therefore the Frogs complained of his cruelty in vain.

13. Jupiter does not hear them, for they complain even yet to this day.

14. For when the Stork goes to his rest at even, they come out of the holes,
and make an hoarse croaking, but they talk to one that hears them no^

15. For Jupiter's mind is, that they that petitioned against a gracio^ King
should now endure one that had no mercy in him.

16. Mor. It uses to befall the common people, just as it did the Frogs; wh^
if they have a King a little more mild, they find fault with him, that he
slothful and idle, and that they may once have a man of valor.

17. On the contrary, if at at any time they have a King that has mett^ in
him, they condemn this King's cruelty, and commend the clemency of the former.
Whether it be, because we always grow weary of things present, (...) because
the saying is true, That new things are better than old.

18. Of the Pigeons and the Kite.
1. THe Pigeons once had war with the Kite, whom, that they might be abl^ to
bear, they chose the Hawk to be their King.

2. He when he was King plays the enemy, not a King.

3. He catches and pulls them in pieces, as fast as the Kite did.

4. The Pigeons repented them of their doing, and thought it was better to
endure the Kite's war, than the Hawk's tyranny.

5. Mor. Let it irk no body too much of his condition.

6. There is nothing (witness Horace) happy on every part.

7. Truly, I would not desire to change my condition, so it were but tolerable.

8. Many when they have got a new condition have again wished for the old.

9. We are almost all of us, of such a fickle disposition that we grow weary of
our selves.

19. Of the Thief and the Dog.
1. A Dog one time answered a Thife, that reached him bread, that he would hold
his tongue, I know thy treacherous intentions: thou give me bread, that I may
leave barking.

2. But I scorn thy gift, because if I shall take the bread, thou will carry
things out of these houses.

3. Mor. Have a care you lose not a great matter, for a little profit's sake.

4. Take heed how you trust any body.

5. For there are many, that not only speak you fair, but also do you a
courtesy, with a treacherous meaning.

20. Of the Wolf and young Sow.
1. A Gilt (or young Sow) pig'd. A Wolf promises, that he would look to her
litter.

2. The Sow that had Pigs answers, That she needed not the Wolf's humble
service. If he would be accounted dutiful, if he desired to do her a pleasure,
he should go further off.

3. For the Wolf's office consisted not in being by, but being away.

4. Mor. All things are not to be trusted to all men.

5. Many men offer their service, not for love of thee, but of themselves
seeking their own benefit, not thine.

21. Of the Mountains bringing forth Young.
1. THere was once a Report, that the Mountains were in travel.

2. Men ran to them, and stood about them, looking for so(...) Monster with
extreme fear.

3. At the last, the Mountains bring forth, there comes out a Mou^^

4. Then they were all ready to die with laughing.

5. Mor. Horace touches on this little tale.

The Hills bring forth, a silly Mouse is born. 6. It also notes bragging.

7. For bragging persons, when they profess and boast of great matters, scarce
perform little matters.

8. Wherefore those Thraso's are rightly the subject of jests and scoffs.

9. Likewise this tale forbids vain fears.

10. For, for the most part, the fear of danger is worse than the danger it
self, nay it is a thing to be laughed at, which we fear.

22. Of the Hound that was despised by his Master.
1. THe Master set on a Hound, which was now grown old; h^ cheers him up in
vain, his feet are slow, he makes no haste.

2. He had caught hold of a Deer; the Deer got from him, being that he wanted
teeth.

3. His Master rates him with blows and words.

4. The Dog answers, that he ought to be pardoned by right, that he was now
grown old; but that he had been a stout Dog, when he was young.

5. But as I perceive, says he, you like nothing without profit* you loved me
when I was young, and able to catch the Game, you cannot abide me now I am slow
and without teeth.

6. But if you were thankful, you would love him that is old for his profitable
youths sake, whom you loved once when he was young for profits sake.

7. Mor. The Dog said well.

8. For, as Ovid witnesses,

Nothing but what brings profit is esteemed;
Take the hope of it away, no man is deemed.
9. There is no remembrance of a good thing past, and no great love of one to
come; the main respect is to the good thing present*

It is unfit to say, but truth to tell,
The Rabble judges love by profit well.
23. Of the Hares and the Frogs.
1. WHen the Wood roared with a whirlwind, that had not used t^ be, the
fearful Hares began to run away apace.

2. And when a Fen was in their way as they ran, they stood sti(...) being
doubtful what to do, and in danger on both sides.

3. And, that which was an occasion of great fear, they saw the Frogs to be
under the water in the Fen.

4. Then one of the Hares being more wise than the rest, and mo(...) eloquent
said; Why do we fear, and need not?

5. We have need of courage.

6. We have nimbleness of body, but we want metal in us.

7. This danger of the whirlwind is not to be avoided, but to (...) neglected.

8. Mor. In every thing we have need of a spirit.

9. Valor lies flat without Confidence.

10. For Confidence is the leader, and queen of Valor.

24. Of the Kid and the Wolf.
2. WHen the Goat was going to feed, she shut up her Kid (...) home, warning
her to open the door to no body till she can^^ back again.

2. A Wolf, that had heard that a good way off, after the Da^^ was gone, knocks
at the door, speaks like the Goat, and bids hi^ open the door.

3. The Kid perceiving his knavery aforehand, says, I will (...) open the
door; for though thy voice be like the Goat's, yet truly see a Wolf through the
Chinks.

4. Mor. It is good for them, that children obey their parent^ and it becomes a
young man to give ear to an old man.

25. Of the Heart and Sheep.
1. AN Heart accused a Sheep before a Wolf, crying out, that (...) ought him a
bushel of Wheat.

2. The Sheep indeed was ignorant of the debt; yet, because the Wolf's being
by, she promises that she would give it.

3. A day is appointed for the payment, it comes, the Heart p^^ the Sheep in
mind.

4. She denies it.

5. For that she had made such a promise, she excuses that was done for fear,
and because of the Wolf's being by.

6. That an oath forced from one was not to be kept.

7. Mor. It is a sentence of Law, We may keep off force by for^^

8. Out of this little Fable a new one comes: We may refel de^ by deceit.

26. Of the Countryman and the Snake.
1. A Countryman had nourished a Snake.

2. And being angry on a time, he struck the beast with an^

3. He got away, but not without a wound.

4. Afterward the Countryman coming to poverty, thought t^ misfortune befell
him because of the wrong he had done to the Sna^

5. Therefore he beseeches the Snake that he would come again.

6. He says, that he forgave him, but would not come ag^^ neither should he be
safe with the Countryman, who had su^^ great ax at home; that the blewness of
the wound was ceased, the mernory for all that remained.

7. Mor. It is scarce safe to trust him again, that has (...) broken his word.

8. It is indeed a point of pity to forgive a wrong; but it (...)

27. Of the Fox and the Stork.
1. A Fox invited a Stork to supper.

2. He poured the meat upon the Table, which, because it wa^ thin, the Fox
licked up, the Stork striving in vain to do so wit^ her bill.

3. The Bird being abused, went her way; she was both ashamed and grieved at
the injury.

4. After a few days, she comes again and invites the Fox.

5. A glass was set full of meat; which vessel, because it wa^ narrow-mouthed,
the Fox might see the meat, and be hungry but he could not taste of it.

6. The Stork easily drew it out with her bill.

7. Mor. Laughter deserve laughter, Jesting, jesting, Knaver^ knavery, and
Deceit, deceit.

28. Of the Wolf and the painted Head.
1. A Wolf tumbles over a man's head, which he found in a Grave^ shop, he
wonders at it, perceiving ( just as it was) that it ha^ no sens^

2. He says, O fine head.

3. There is in thee a great deal of Art, but no sense at all.

4. Mor. Outward beauty is pleasing, if there be inward.

5. But if we must want either, he is better, that wants t^ outward, than the
inward.

6. For that sometimes without this incurs hatred, so that a fo^^ is so much
the more disliked, by how much the fairer he is.

29. Of the Cornish-Chough.
1. THe Cornish-Chough decked her self with a Peacock's feather.

2. And afterward seeming to her self pretty handsom^ scorning her kind, she
went to the Peacocks.

3. They at the last, understanding the deceit, stripped the foo^ish bird of
her colors, and beat her.

4. Horace, in the first book of his Epistles, tells this little t^ of a
Jack-daw.

5. He says, she was once made fine with feathers gathered (...) which had
fallen from other birds, but afterward she was ridi^lous, when every one of
the birds had pulled her own feathers from (...)

6. Lest if perchance each bird should come and take Her own feathers, the Daw
should laughter make,
Being stripped of her stolen colors --


7. Mor. This little tale notes those, that behave themselv^ more loftily than
is fitting; that live with them that are b^ richer, and more gentile, than
themselves; whereupon they of^^ become poor, and are made a mocking-stock.

8. Juvenal does well advise us:

Gnothi seauton, down from heaven did come, that is, Kn^^ thy self.

30. Of the Fly and the Pismire.
1. THe Fly was at a contest with the Pismire; she bragged (...) (...) that
she was base; that her self did that she crept, that her self dwelt in Kings
Palaces, that she lay in holes in the ground; that she gnawed the corn; and
drank water; that her self feasted it bravely, and yet got these things with
ease.

2. On the other side, the Pismire said, That her self was not base, but was
content with her birth; that the Fly was a wanderer, but her self was constant
to a place; that corn and running water did re^^th with the Pismire, as well as
Pasties and wine did with the Fly; and that herself did not get these things
by slothful idleness, but by diligent labor. Furthermore she said that the
Pismire was merry and safe, beloved of all; and, to conclude, was a pattern of
labor. But that the Fl^e was full of cares, was set at by all with the danger
of her life; that she was hated by all, and to conclude, was a pattern of
sloth. That the Pismire being mindful of winter, did lay up food, that the Fly
did live but from hand to mouth, and was either like to endure hunger, or
certainly to die in winter.

3. Mor. He that goes on to say what he lists, shall hear those things which he
lists not.

4. The Fly had heard his own commendation, if he had given good language.

5. But I yi^ld my consent to the Pismire.

6. For a mean life with security seems more desirable, than a brave life with
danger.

31. Of the Frog and the Ox.
1. A Frog being desirous to match an Ox, (...) out her self.

2. The young one exhorted the Dam, to give over what she had begun, because a
Frog was nothing to an Ox.

3. She swelled the second time.

4. The young one cries out, Mother though you burst, you shall never be too
hard for the O^.

5. But when she had swelled the third time, she burst.

6. Mor. Every one has his gift.

7. This man exceeds in beauty, that in strength, this is potent in wealth,
that in friends. It becomes every one to be content with his own.

8. He has an able body, thou a strong wit.

9. Wherefore let every one advise with himself: and let him not envy his
better, which is a poor thing; nor desire to cont^st with him, which is a point
of folly.

32. Of the Horse and the Lion.
1. A Lion came to eat up a Horse: but wanting strength for old age, he began
to practice a trade; he professes himself a Doctor, he stays the Horse with a
long story.

2. The Horse opposes knavery to knavery, and cunning to cunning.

3. He feigned that he had pricked his foot of late in a thorny place: He
entreats him, that being a Physician, he would look upon it and pull out the
thorn.

4. The Lion yields to him.

5. But the Horse with all the force he could, gives the Lion.

6. The Lion scarcely recovering himself, at the length (for he wa^ almost
killed with the blow) says, I am rightly served for my fol^ly, and he has
worthily escaped: for he has revenged knavery with knavery.

7. Mor. Dissembling is worthy to be hated, and is to be caugh^ by dissembling.

8. An enemy is not to be feared, that shows himself an enemy^ but he that when
he is an enemy, pretends good will is to be feared at the length, and
exceedingly deserves to be hated.

33. Of the Horse and the Ass.
1. A Horse being finely trapped and fadled, ran along the way, neighing apace.

2. And by chance a laden Ass stood in his way as he ran.

3. The Horse fretting for anger, and -- Fiercely chafing on the frothy bit.

4. Thou slow and idle Ass, quoth he, why do thou hinder the Horses way?

5. Get out of my way, I say, or I will kick thee.

6. The Ass not daring to bray to the contrary, gives way and says nothing.

7. Now the Horses cods burst, as he was frisking and minding his career.

8. Then being not good for a Race, or a Show, he was deprived of his
braveries, and after that was sold to a Carman.

9. The Ass sees him afterward coming with a Cart, and speaks to him.

10. Good Sir! what furniture is this?

11. Where is your gilded saddle, and your studded girths? where is your gay
bridle?

12. Thus it might needs happen, friends, to you that was so proud.

13. Mor. Many are puffed up in prosperity, and neither remember themselves nor
modesty, but because they grow proud in prosperity, they fall into adversity.

14. I would advise them that seem to be happy, to be wary: for if the wheel of
fortune be but turned about, they will find it to be a most miserable kind of
misfortune to have been happy.

15. This mischief also adds to their unhappiness, they shall be scorned of
them whom they scorned: and they whom they have laughted at, will jeer them.

34. Of the Birds and the four-footed Beasts.
1. THe Birds had a Battle with the four-footed Beasts.

2. There was hope on both sides, fear on both sides, and danger on both sides.

3. Now the Bat having for saken her fellows went to the enemies. The Birds get
the better, The Eagle being their Captain and Leader.

4. And they condemned the runagado Bat. That she should never come again to
the Birds, and that she should never fly in the day time.

5. This is the reason for the Bat, that she never flies but by night.

6. Mor. He that refuses to be sharer with his fellows in adversity and
danger, shall have no share of prosperity or safety.

35. Of the Wolf and the Fox.
1. THe Wolf, when he had prey enough, lived in idleness.

2. The Fox comes to him, and enquires the reason of his idleness.

3. The Wolf perceived, that treachery was intended toward him: he made as
though sickness was the reason: he entreated the Fox to go and pray to the gods
for him.

4. She being sorry that her cunning, did not take, goes to a shepherd, and
informs him, That the Wolf's kennel lay open, and that an enemy being secure
might be taken at unawares.

5. The shepherd sets upon the Wolf, and kills him.

6. The Fox enjoys the kennel and the prey.

7. But she had but small joy of her roguery; for not very long after the same
shepherd took her too.

8. Mor. Envy is an ugly thing, and sometimes also destructive to the Author.

9. Horace in the first book of his Epistle says, At others weal an envious
man does fret.
Sicilian Kings than envy never yet
Invented greater torments --


36. Of the Heart.
1. A Heart beholding himself in a clear fountain, he approves of the lofty and
branched horns of his forehead: but he condemns the slenderness of his legs.

2. By chance, whilst he looks on them, and whilst he passes judgment on
them, the Hunter comes upon him: the Heart runs away Swifter than arrows,
swifter than the wind,
That drives the clouds.


3. The dogs pursue him as he runs.

4. But when he had entered into a thick wood, his horns were entangled in the
boughs.

5. Then at the last he commended his legs, and condemned his horns, which made
that he became a prey to the dogs.

6. Mor. We desire things that are to be avoided, and we avoid things that are
to be desired.

7. The things which do us hurt, please us: and the things which do us good
displease us.

8. We desire happiness, before we understand where it is.

9. We look after abundance of wealth, and height of honors: we suppose
happiness to be placed in these things, in the which notwithstanding is a great
deal of labor and sorrow.

10. That same Lyrick Poet of ours expresses it handsomely, The tallest Pines
are over-blown,
The loftiest Towers are overthrown,
The highest Hills are smitten down


37. Of the Viper, and the File.
1. A Viper finding a File in a Smiths shop, began to gnaw it.

2. The File smiled saying, What thou fool, what do thou do?

3. Thou shall wear out thy teeth, before thou can wear me, which am wont to
bite of the hardness of the brass.

4. Mor. Be sure to see with whom thou have to do.

5. If thou whettest thy teeth against one stronger than thy self, thou shall
not heart him but thy self.

38. Of the Wolves and the Lambs.
1. I Here was once a covenant betwixt the Wolves and the Sheep, amongst whom
there is naturally discord, hostages being given on both sides.

2. The Wolves gave their Whelps, and the Sheep their company of Dogs.

3. Whilst the Sheep were quiet and feeding, the young Wolves set up an houling
for the want of their dams.

4. Then the Wolves rushing upon them, cried out, that their faith and covenant
was broken, and they pull in pieces the Sheep, that were destitute of the guard
of the dogs.

5. Mor. It is folly, if in a league thou deliver the things that keep thee
safe, to the enemy.

6. For he that has been an enemy, has not yet perhaps ceased to be an enemy:
and peradventure he may take occasion to fall upon thee, being deprived of thy
safeguard.

39. Of the Wood, and the Countryman.
1. AT what time also the Trees spoke, a Countryman came into a Wood; he
entreated it that he might have leave to get a shaft for his ax.

2. The Wood consented.

3. The Countryman, when his ax was fitted, began to cut down the Trees.

4. Then, and indeed too late, it repented the Wood of its readiness to do a
courtesy: it was sorry that it self was the cause of its own destruction.

5. Mor. Have a care to whom thou do a good turn.

6. There have been many, that after they have received a courtesy have abused
it, to the undoing of the bestower of it.

40. Of the Members, and the Belly.
1. THe foot and the hand once accused the belly, because their gains were
consumed by it, that would not work.

2. They bid that it should either take pains, or else that it should not
desire to be maintained.

3. It beseeched them, once or twice.

4. Yet the hands deny it sustenance.

5. The belly being empty for want of meat, when all the limbs began to be
feeble, then at last the hands would be officious: but that was too late.

6. For the belly being weak for lack of use (...)

7. So all the Limbs, whilst they envied the belly, died with the belly when it
died.

8. Mor. As it is in the society of the members, so is humane society.

9. A member stands in need of a member, and a friend stands i^ need of a
friend.

10. Wherefore we must make use of mutual offices, and mutual labors: neither
do riches nor titles of honor sufficiently defend a man

11. The only and main guard is the friendship of many.

41. Of the Ape and the Fox.
1. AN Ape entreats a Fox, that he would bestow a piece of hi^ tail on her to
cover her ^u^^ocks: for it was a burden t^ him, which would be of use and an
honor to her.

2. The Fox answers, That he had nothing too much, and that h^ had rather have
the ground swept with his tail, than the Ape^ buttocks to be covered with it.

3. Mor. There are some that stand in need, and there are some tha^ have too
much; (...) no rich men have that fashion, to comfor^ poor men with the
superfluous means.

42. Of the Stag and the Oxen.
1. A Stag running away from the hunter, betook himself into a beast-house: he
entreats the O ^en, that he might lie hid in the cratch.

2. The Oxen said he could not be safe; for the master and the servants would
be there presently.

3. He said, he was secure, if so be they would not betray him.

4. The servant comes in, and does not see him hid in the hay, he goes his way
out.

5. The Stag begins to be jocund, and to fear nothing.

6. Then one of the Oxen being grave both for his age and advice, says, It was
an easy thing to deceive this fellow, that is ( as blind as) a Mole: but how
thou can lie hid from our master, who is ( as quick-sighted as) Argos,

This is the toil, this is the work.

7. Presently after a while comes in the master, who, that he might correct the
servants negligence, viewing every thing with his eyes, and trying what was in
the cratch with his hand, caught hold of the Stag's horns under the hay: He
calls upon his servants, they run to him, they enclose the Deer, and take him.

8. Mor. In adversities and dangers, lurking places are hard to be found:
whether it be, because Fortune vexes poor men, as she begun: or because they
being hindered with fear betray themselves through indiscretion.

43. Of the Lion and the Fox.
1. THE Lion was sick, the living creatures came to visit him: only the Fox
deferred his service.

2. The Lion sends a messenger to him with a Letter, which wished him to come;
saying that his only presence would be very acceptable to the Lion, and that
there would be no danger why the Fox should (...).

3. Besides, that he himself was sick and lay by it, so as though h^ would do
him harm ( a thing that was not) yet he could not.

4. The Fox writes back, That he desired, that the Lion might recover* and that
he would pray to God for that; but he would not come and se^ him, for he was
affrighted with the foot steps.

5. Which footsteps, for as much as they are all toward the Lyon'^ ^en, and
none from it wards, that matter was a token, that many living creatures went
in, but none came out. Horace says, 6. What once the Fox to the sick Lion said,
I will relate: The feeting made me 'fraid,
Which all look to thee wards, but none look back.


7. Mor. Beware thou do not trust words; unless thou do tak^ heed, thou shall
often be beguiled.

8. Thou may guess at men both by their words and deeds, and by the deeds
the words are to be judged.

44. Of the Fox and the Weesel.
1. A Fox being lean with long fasting crept by chance through a narrow hole,
into a corn wisket; in which when he had well fed, hi^ teg'd belly hindered him,
as he strove to go out again.

2. A Weesel, a good way off seeing her striving, at the last tellet^ her, If
she had a mind to go forth, she should come lean again to the hole, which she
got in at when she was lean.

3. Mor. You may see many to be pleasant and cheerful in a mean condition,
being void of cares, and free from the troubles of the mind.

4. But if these men become rich, you shall see them to go heavily, an^ never
to show a merry look, being full of care, and overwhelme^ with troubles of the
mind.

5. Thus Horace sings this tale in the first Book and seventh Epistle. A Fox by
chance crept through a little hole,
Into a basket, that had store of grain:
And having fed, he strove with his belly full,
To get out thence again, but all in vain.
A Weesel bids him, if he thence would pass,
Go to the hole lean, as at the first he was.


45. Of the Horse and the Stag.
1. A Horse made war with a Stag.

2. And being beaten at the last out of the pastures, he be sought man he^

3. He comes back with a Man, he goes down into the plain field^ and he that
was overcome before, is now made conqueror.

4. But for all this when the enemy was overcome, and brought under, the Victor
himself could not choose but obey the Man.

5. He carries a rider on his back, and a bridle in his mouth.

6. Mor. Many strive against poverty, which when it is overcome fortune and
industry, the conqueror's liberty is often lost.

7. For being Lords and Masters of poverty, they begin to serve (...) are
tormented with the s^ourge of covetousness, they are h^ (...) with the bridle
of sparingness (...) neither do they keep a mean in (...).

8. Horace speaks of this, in the first Book of his Epistles, and the tenth
Epistle. The Stag did beat the Horse out of the field,
Who found himself too weak, but, loath to yield,
He craved man's help, and underwent the rein;
But having quelled his foe by might and main,
The rider from his back he could not get,
Nor bit out of his mouth, but bears them yet;
So ^e that poverty does strive to fly,
Wants, that is than gold more precious, Liberty;
The wretch his Master bears; a slave is he,
That cannot with a little content be.


46. Of two young Men.
1. TWo young men, make as though they would buy meat at a Cooks.

2. Whilst the Cook was doing other things, the one snatcheth a piece of flesh
out of the basket, and gives it to his fellow, that he might hide it under his
clothes.

3. The Cook, as soon as he saw a piece of flesh to be gone out of the basket,
began to charge them both of theft.

4. He that had taken it away, swore by Jove, that he had nothing; and he that
had it swore often, that he took nothing away.

5. To whom the Cook said, truly the thief now is unknown to me, but he by whom
you have sworn saw, and knows him.

6. Mor. If we do any thing amiss, men do not presently know it; but God, who
sits above the heavens, and beholds the bottomless depth, sees all things.

7. Which if Men do but consider, they will sin more closely and warily.

47. Of the Dog, and the Butcher.
1. WHen a Dog had stolen a piece of flesh from a butcher in the shambles, he
ran presently away with it as fast as he could.

2. The butcher being daunted with the loss of the thing, at the first held his
peace; afterward, when he came to himself, he called to him thus a great way
off, O thou arrant thief, run secure thou may without any danger, for thou
art sure now, because of thy swiftness; but hereafter thou shall be watched
more narrowly.

3. Mor. This fable signifies, that almost all men become then at last more
wary, when they have sustained loss.

48. Of the Dog, and the Sheep.
1. A Dog commenced an action against a sheep, bawling that she ought him a
loaf which he lent her.

2. The Sheep denies the Action.

3. The Kite, the Wolf, and the Vulture are sent for; they affirm the thing.

4. The sheep is cast; the dog takes her away hastily, and fleaeth her being
cast.

5. Mor. Both every one knows, and this little tale does very well.

49. Of the Lamb and the Wolf.
1. A Wolf met a Lamb that kept company with a He goat: he asked him, Why
having left his Dam, he rather followed a stinking He-goat; and persuades him,
that he would go again to his Dam's dugs, that strutted out with milk; hoping
that so it will come to pass that he should pull him in pieces, being drawn
aside.

2. But he said, O Wolf, my Dam committed me to him: an especial care to look
after me is committed to him. I must obey my parent rather than thee, who
desire to draw me aside by these words, and by and by to pull me in pieces,
being drawn aside.

Mor. Do not trust all men, for many, whilst they seem to be willing to do
others good, consult for themselves in the mean time.

50. Of a Young Man and a Cat.
1. WHen a young Man took delight in, and loved a Cat, he wearied Venus with
entreaties, that she would turn the Cat into the shape of woman.

2. Venus pitied and heard him when he prayed: There is made a change of the
shape, which liked the young man, being deeply in love, very well. Forsooth,
she was all pretty sappy, all pretty white, all pretty handsome.

3. And not very long after, the goddess, desiring much to try whether the Cat
had changed her manners also with her body, lets in a little mouse, down
through the little Court.

4. There befell a thing that very much deserved laughter and sport.

5. The little woman presently makes after the little beast, when she saw her.

6. Venus taking it ill, changed the woman's look into a Cat.

7. Her hands to feet, her arms to thighs turned thus, A tail is added, and
she is made a Puss.

8. Mor. They change the air, not mind, that o'er-sea run.

9. And it is too hard a thing to leave the things one is used to.

10. Horace says: Though Nature with a fork thou do expel,
Yet will it still recoil.


51. Of the Husbandman and his Sons.
1. A Husbandman had a great many young men to his Sons, and they were at
discord amongst themselves; whom the father striving to persuade to love one
another, when he had laid down a bundle of sticks, he bids every one severally
break it, as it was tied together with a short Cord.

2. The weak youths strive in vain.

3. The father loses it, and gives to every one a little rod; which when
every one, according to their little strength, easily brake, he said, O little
sons, no body will be able to overcome you, if you hold thus together.

4. But if you will wound one another, and make civil war, ye will be at the
last a prey to the Enemies.

5. Mor. This Apologue teaches, that small means increase by concord, and
great means waste to nothing by discord.

52. Of the Countryman and the Horse.
1. A Countryman brought along the way a lere Horse, and an ass soundly laden
with fardels.

2. The little ass being weary, entreats the horse, that he would help him with
his loading, if he would save his life.

3. The Horse says, He would not do it.

4. The little Ass at the length, being tired with the weight of his pack lies
down and dies.

5. His Master lays all the load, and the skin of the dead ass too, upon the
Horses back.

6. With which, when he was pressed down, he says, O me poor wretch, I am now
thus tormented according to my own desert, who would not e're while help the
ass, that was over laden.

7. Mor. We are admonished by this tale, to help our friends that are oppressed.

8. Our Country ( says Plato) challenges a part of our birth to it self, and
our friends a part.

53. Of the Collier and the Fuller.
1. A Collier invited a Fuller to dwell with him in one house.

2. The Fuller says, My friend, that is neither pleasure nor profit to me,
for, I greatly fear, lest what I wash clean, thou may make as black as a
coal is

3. Mor. We are admonished by this tale, to walk with blameless persons; we are
admonished, to avoid the company of wicked men, as a plague.

4. Company, says Campanus, draws men; and acquaintance also screweth into
men's behavior; and every one becomes just such, as they with whom he
converseth.

54. Of the Fowler and the Ring-dove.
1. A Fowler went a birding; he sees a Ring^ dove a great way off, making her
nest in a very high tree; he makes haste: Lastly, he lays wait to hit her; he
treads upon a snake with his heel.

2. He stung him.

3. He being affrighted with the sudden harm, says, Woe is me, poor man!
whilst I lie in wait to deceive another, I my self am utterly undone.

4. Mor. This little tale signifies, that they are sometimes beguiled by their
own crafts, who attempt alteration in a State.

55. Of a Trumpeter.
1. A Trumpeter was taken by the Enemies, and led away.

2. He trembled, and besought them to spare a harmless person: He said that he,
for as much as he never bare any arms, except a Trumpet, could not indeed kill
a man, much less would he.

3. They on the contrary spoke roughly against him, both with a cruel muttering
and blows.

4. Thou Rogue, thou had as good say nothing; thou do hurt most of all,
and thou shall now be hanged here: because whereas thou (as thou confeffest)
art unskilled in military affairs, thou stirrest up, and set on other men's
courage.

5. Mor. Some offend most grievously who advise Princes, that are otherwise
prone enough to mischief, to do unjustly, and do buz into their ears some such
words as these.

6. What do you make any question? Have you forgot that you are a Prince? May
not you do what you list? You are greater than the Law: The name of a
Law-breaker can scarce light upon you, who do bear sway even over the Laws
themselves.

7. Your Subjects have nothing which is not yours. You are able both to save
and to destroy. It is lawful for you, to make him wealthier, or more
honorable, whom you think good. It is lawful for you to take away his wealth
and honor when you please.

8. Some things condemn or commend other men: Every thing will be very
commendable for you.

56. Of the Wolf and the Dog.
1. A Wolf meets a Dog, as it chanced, in the wood, before it was light; he
asks him how he does, he is glad to meet him: and at the last asks him how
he came to be slick.

2. To whom he said, my Masters care has done this: for my Master cherishes
me, when I fawn upon him, I am fed from my Masters most fine Table, I never use
to sleep in the open air; and besides, it cannot be said how all the family
make much of me.

3. Truly says the Wolf, thou art very happy, Dog! that have light upon such a
kind and gentle Master, with whom, O I could wish too, that I might dwell; then
no living Creature in the World should be more happy than I.

4. The Dog, seeing the Wolf to be very desirous of a new condition, promises
that he would bring it about, that he should find some respect from his Master,
so he would but abate some of his old fierceness, and undergo service:

5. He is resolved; It pleased the Wolf to walk along to the farm-house: they
have a great deal of very pleasant discourse upon the way.

6. And afterward when it grew light, the Wolf espying the Dogs neck worn bare,
said, O Dog, what ails that neck of thine, with the hair all off it?

7. I used, said he, being somewhat fierce, to bark at, and sometimes to bite
strangers as well as friends: and my Master, not enduring that, did often beat
me, forbiding me withal to set upon any but a Thief or a Wolf.

8. I am overmastered and made more mild, by being thus beaten, and I have kept
this mark of my inbred churlishness.

9. The Wolf, when he heard this, says, I will not buy thy Masters friendship
at such a rate.

10. Therefore farewell, Dog, with that slavery of thine: my own liberty is
better for me.

11. Mor. It is more desirable to be master in a mean cottage, and to eat brown
bread, than to enjoy dainty cheer in a stately palace, and to be liable to
danger, and live in fear.

12. For liberty is banished out of a great house, where wrong must be taken
and passed over in silence.

57. Of the Husbandman and the Dogs.
1. A Husbandman after he had wintred a good many days in the Country, began at
the last to want necessaries; he killed his sheep, and after a while his she
goats: and last of all, he kills his oxen too, that he might have something
wherewithal to maintain his body, that was almost famished.

2. When the Dogs saw that, they resolved to save themselves by running away;
for they should live no longer, seeing their Master did not so much as spare
the Oxen, whose labor he made use of in doing his Country-work.

3. Mor. Have a care into what house you put your self for wages.

4. Some Masters are very unkind.

5. For many now a days are grown so mad, that they are ready to kill even
their servants, for any misfortune, harm or damage.

58. Of the Fox and the Lion.
1. A Fox, which was not used to the Lions fierceness, having by chance seen
that Living Creature once or twice, did tremble and run away.

2. As soon as ever the Lion came and met him the third time, the Fox was so
far from fearing any thing, that he went boldly to him, and saluted him.

3. Mor. Use makes us all more bold, even toward them whom we durst scarce
look at before.

59. Of the Fox and the Eagle.
1. A Fox's Cub ran abroad; being caught by an Eagle, it calls to its dam to
help it.

2. She runs, and entreats the Eagle, that he would let go her Cub, being taken
prisoner.

3. The Eagle having got a prey, flies to her young ones.

4. The Fox pursues her with a fire stick which she snatched up, as though she
would burn down her strong hold.

5. As soon as ever she had climbed up the tree, she says, and now then defend
thy self and young ones if thou can.

6. The Eagle trembling whilst she feared her house burning, said Spare me and
my young ones, and I will restore whatever I have of thine.

7. Mor. By the Eagle understand men of a powerful and daring Spirit, by the
Fox understand poor folks, whom rich folks endeavor all alike, to cavil with,
and revile:

8. But, seeing the Pismires also have their spleen, those weak people
sometimes do handsomely revenge a wrong which they have received.

60. Of the Husbandman and the Stork.
1. WHen the cranes and geese ate up the sown Corn, the Country man set a snare
for them: the Cranes were taken, and the Geese were taken, and a stork also was
taken.

2. She begged hard for her self, crying out, that she was one that did no^
hurt, and was neither crane nor goose, but the best of all birds, because she
used always to do all that ever she could for her father, and to maint ai^ him
when he was very aged.

3. None of these things, quoth he, are unknown to me; but, forasmuch as we
have taken thee with them that did hurt, thou shall die likewise with them

4. Mor. He that commits a naughty fact, and he that keeps company with
them that are naught, are punished both alike.

61. Of the Cock and the Cat.
1. A Cat came to eat up a Cock; and having not reason enough to do him hurt,
he begins to accuse the Cock, saying. That he was a bird that troubled others
with his noise, because he waked men when they were asleep in the night, with
such a shrill voice.

2. He said, he was innocent, seeing he thus called up men to their work.

3. The Cat in the mean time spoke earnestly against him; Thou Villain, thou
had as good do nothing; thou lie with thy mother, and do not refrain from
thy sister.

4. When the Cock endeavored to clear himself of that too, the Cat going on
still in a rage, says, Neither shall this avail any thing; I will pull thee
all in pieces to day.

5. Mor. William Gauden says, It is an old saying, One may quickly find a
stick to beat a dog withal.

6. A naughty man, if he list, will undo you, whether by right or wrong.

62. Of the Shepherd and the Husbandmen.
1. A Boy kept sheep in an open meadow; and when he cried out in jest many
times, that the Wolf was there, he raised the husbandmen on all sides.

2. Whilst they, having been too often made fools of, do not come to help him,
when he craved their aid in good ^rnest, the sheep became a prey to the Wolf.

3. Mor. If any one be used to lie, he will scarcely be believed, if at any
time he shall begin to tell the truth.

4. That jest in Horace, in the seventeenth Epistle of his first Book
concerning Planus the jester, is very like the foregoing Apologue.

5. He that was once befooled, will not assay. To help lame Planus up in the
cross-way,
Though many a tear he shed, and do protest
By his god Apis, I am not in jest:
Believe me, stony hearts, and your help lend
To one that is lame. Get some to help thee, friend,
That knows thee not, thy neighbors all do cry,
We know thy cheats, and for us thou may lie.


63. Of the Eagle and the Crow.
1. AN Eagle flies down from a very high rock. upon the back of a Lamb*

2. The Crow seeing that, thinks it fine sport, like an ape, to imitate the
Eagle; he lets himself down upon a ram's fleece; being let down, he is made
fast by the feet; being fastened by the feet, he is caught: being caught he is
thrown to the boys.

3. Mor. Let every one esteem himself, not by others, hut his own worth.

4. Take measure of thy self by thy own foot, says Horace.

5. Desire that, and attempt that, which thou art able to perform.

64. Of the Envious Dog and the Ox.
1. A Dog lay in a rack of Hay.

2. An Ox came to eat.

3. The Dog rousing himself up, hindered him.

4. The Ox says, a mischief on thee, with that envy of thine, who neither do
eat the hay thy self, nor suffer me to eat.

5. Mor. A great many are of that disposition, that they envy to another that
which they cannot attain to for want of understanding.

65. Of the Jack-Daw and the Sheep.
1. A Jack-daw chattered upon a Sheeps back.

2. The Sheep said, if thou should so chatter to a dog, thou should have
some mischief done thee.

3. But the Jack daw said, I know over whom I insult; I am troublesome to them
that are quietly disposed, and friendly to them that are fierce.

4. Mor. Bad men are always ready to contest with a weak and honest man.

5. Every one that is most innocent, is dashed against the ground, but no body
cries out against a mischievous and hasty man, in his own hearing.

66. Of the Peacock and the Nightingale.
1. THe Peacock complains to Juno, the sister and wife of great Jupiter. that
the Nightingale sang sweetly, but that she was laughed at by every body, for
her hoarse squawling.

2. To whom Juno made answer, Every one has his gift from god: the Nightingale
far exceeds in singing, and thou in feat hers: It becomes every one to be
content with his own lot.

3. Mor. Let us thankfully accept what God has given us, and not seek greater
matters.

4. God does nothing rashly.

67. Of the old Weesel and the Mice.
1. A Weesel, wanting strength by reason of his old age, was not now able to
follow after the mice, so as he was used to do: he begins to devise a cunning
trick, he hides himself in an heap of meal, thus hoping, that he might hunt
without any labor.

2. The mice run to him, and whilst they have a mind to eat the meal, they are
all every one devoured by the Weesel.

3. Mor. Where one is destitute of strength, he has need of wit.

4. Lysander the Lacedemonian, was ever and anon wont to say, that the Fox's
fur was to be eked to that, where the Lions skin would not reach.

5. Which you may express more clearly thus, where downright dealing cannot
prevail, slight must be used.

68. Of the Countryman and the Apple Tree.
1. A Countryman every year got very well relisht Apples off an Apple Tree,
which he had in a Close hard by: he presented the choicest to his Master, that
was a Citizen: who being taken with the incredible sweetness of the apples,
removed the apple tree at last to his own home.

2. The tree being very old, withered all on a sudden; and there the apples,
as well as the apple tree, were lost.

3. Which when it was told the Master of the house, he said, Alas, it is an
hard matter to remove an old tree; it had been enough, and too much (if I had
known how to bridle mine appetite) to pluck the fruit from the boughs.

4. Mantuan has thus expressed this little tale in verse. A Countryman some
sweeting pulled,
And to his Lord them gave;
Who, much delighted with the fruit,
The tree near home would have.
But it being old, soon withered,
And with it is Apples died:
Alas, it is no removing trees
Thus old, the good man cried.


5. Mor. Such men are fools, that are too wise, And things not fit require:
But he is wise, that wotteth how,
To curb his own desire,


69. Of the Lion and the Frog.
1. A Lion thought he heard a noise; he started at it; he stood still, not
without trembling, expecting some great matter.

2. At the last, a little Frog came out of the water.

3. The Lion having laid aside his fear, made have, and trod the little beast
under his feet.

4. Mor. This little tale forbids vain fears, as does that tale concerning
the labor of the Mountains, translated by William Gaudane.

70. Of the Pismire.
1. A Pismire being thirsty, comes to a spring to drink; she falls by chance
into the spring-well, a Pigeon helps her a good way off, by throwing a bough
out of the tree; the Pismire getting upon the bough is saved.

2. A Fowler comes, that he might catch the Pigeon; the Pismire does not suffer
him; she bites the Fowler by the foot, and the Pigeon flies away.

3. Mor. This fable teaches us very well, that we must requite courtesies done
to us.

71. Of the Peacock and the Magpy.
1. WHen the Nation of the birds roved up and down at their own liberty, they
wished they might have a King given them.

2. The Peacock thought himself as worthy as the best to be chosen, because he
was the fairest.

3. When he was chosen to be King the Magpy says, O King, if the Eagle begin
stoutly to pursue us, as she is wont, whilst you reign, how will you drive her
away? How will you do to save us?

4. Mor. The shape is not so much to be looked at in a Prince, as the strength
of body: He has need of discretion.

72. Of the Sick-man and the Physician.
1. A Physician had a sick man in cure, but he died at the last.

2 Then says the Physician to his kinsfolks, This man died through
intemperance.

3. Mor. Unless one leave drinking and Venery betimes, he shall either never
come to be old, or have but a very short old age.

73. Of the Lion and others.
1. THe Lion, the Ass and the Fox go on hunting: good store of game is taken,
and being taken it is ordered to be divided.

2. As the Ass laid several shares out for every one, the Lion roared, he takes
the Ass and pulls him in pieces.

3. Afterward, he bids the Fox do it: who being more crafty, when he had
hardly reserved the least share for himself, having laid aside the best piece
by far for the Lion, the Lion asked him, who had taught him thus to do?

4. To whom he said, the ruin of him has taught me, pointing at the dead Ass.

Mor. He Is happy who takes heed by others harms.

74. Of the Kid and the Wolf.
1. A Kid peeping out at a window, did dare to revile a Wolf, as he passed by.

2. To whom the Wolf said, Thou Villain, it is not thou that revilest me, but
the place.

3. Mor. Both time and place do ever add confidence to a man.

75. Of the Ass.
1. AN Ass complaining of the Gardiner's cruelty, entreated Jupiter, that he
might have another Master given him.

2. Jupiter heard the Ass's prayers, and gives him a Brick-layer, with whom
when he carried bricks, and heavier loads on his back, he came again to
Jupiter, and entreated one might be given him that was more mild.

3. Jupiter laughed at him.

4. Yet he never gave over urging, and entreating so far, till he made him do it

5. He gives him a tanner; whom when the Ass knew thoroughly, he said, Woe is me
poor wretch, who, whilst I am content with no master, have light upon him, who
( as far as I guess) will not spare my very skin.

6. Mor. We always condemn things present, and desire new things, which (as the
Proverb goes) are not better than the old.

76. Of the old Woman and the Maids.
1. AN old woman had a great many maids at home, whom she called up to their
work every day, before it begun to be light, at the crowing of a cock, which
she kept at her house.

2. The maids being vexed at last, with the wearisomness of their daily
business, cut off the cock's head, hoping that now he was killed, they should
sleep till noon, but this hope failed the poor girls.

3. For their Mistress, as soon as she knew that the Cock was killed, bad then
to rise at midnight ever after.

4. Mor. Many, whilst they strive to shun a great evil, fall into anoth^^ quite
contrary.

5. It is a very common saying: Who fain would shun the one extreme,
Into the other falls.


77. Of the Ass and the Horse.
1. THe Ass thought the Horse was happy, because he was fat and lived (...)
idlene's, But he said that himself was unhappy, because he was lea^^ and
hide-bound, and made use of every day by an harsh Master, to carry load*

2. Not long after they cried to arms.

3. Then the Horse. A rider from his back did not repel,
Nor bridle from his mouth, nor shafts that fell
Upon his body --


4. The Ass, when he saw this, gave god many thanks, that he had (...) made him
an Horse, but an Ass.

5. Mor. They are miserable, whom the common sort judge happy: a many are
happy, that think themselves very miserable.

6. The Cobbler says, the King is happy whom he sees to have all thi^ at his
will; not considering about what matters and cares he is distract^ whilst
himself in the mean time sings with his honest poverty.

78. Of the Lion and the she-Goat.
1. A Lion having by chance espied a she-Goat walking on a very (...) rock,
advised her that she would come down rather into the gr^^ meadow.

2. The Goat said, I should do so perhaps, if thou were away: who not (...)
persuade me, that I should take any pleasure thereby, but that thou (...) have
something to devour, being ready to starve for hunger.

3. Mor. Trust not all men.

4. For, some do not advise for thee, but for themselves.

79. Of the Vulture and other Birds.
1. THe Vulture makes as though she would keep her birthday every year; she
invites the little Birds to the Feast.

2. They almost all come: she entertains them when they come with great tokens
of joy and respect: but the vulture teareth them in pieces, after they were
entertained.

3. Mor. All are not friends that speak one fair, or say, that they are willing
to do one a courtesy.

5. Hereupon says Ovid.

Often under honey, sweetest poisons lurk.

80. Of the Geese.
1. THe geese spoiled the ground with the Cranes; which when they were heard
the Country folks rose presently upon them.

2. The Cranes as soon as they espied the Country-folks, flew away, but the
Geese were caught, which being hindered with the weight of their body could not
get away.

Mor. When a City is taken by the enemies, a poor man easily gets away; but a
rich man being taken prisoner is made a slave.

In time of war riches are rather a burden than of any use.

81. Of Jupiter and the Ape.
1. WHen Jupiter had a great mind to know, what mortal Wights had the prettiest
young ones, he gave order, that whatever living Creatures there were any where,
they should be called together.

2. They flock to Jupiter from all parts.

3. All sorts of birds and beasts were now there; amongst which when the Ape
also came, carrying her ill-favored cubs in her arms, none could forbear
laughing: nay more, Jupiter himself laughed very excessively.

4. Then by and by, quoth the Ape herself, Yea Jupiter also our Judge knows,
that my young ones do quite outstrip all as many as be here.

5. Mor. Every one thinks his own the fairest, as the proverb says.

9. And elsewhere in Theocritus, in his Eidyls.

What is not fair, so to the lover seems.

82. Of the Oak and the Reed.
1. THe Oak being ence full of disdain and insolency too, set upon the Reed,
saying, If now thou have any mettle in thee come on and fight, that the end of
us two may show whether is the stronger.

The Reed, nothing wondering at such great bragging of the Oak, and idle
vaunting of his valor, answered thus, I will not now ^ight, neither am I sorry
for my condition.

3. For although I be moveable to every side yet I overcome the shrill storms:
But thou, if once King Aeolus should let out the winds that struggle in a vast
cave, wilt fall down together-ward, and then I shall laugh at thee.

4. Mor. This fable shows, that they are not always the most valiant who
(even unprovoked by any injury) do insult over others.

83. Of the Fisherman and the little Fish.
1. A Fisherman having thrown a baited hook into the water, pulled out a little
Fish.

2. The prisoner entreated and besought him, that he would let him, being but a
very small one, go away, and grow to its full growth, that he might have him
afterward when he was bigger.

3. The Fisher said, I will not buy the Pig in the Poke: because I was always
of that disposition, that I choose to get whatever I can for the present.

4. Mor, This little fable admonishes us, that we should not at any time forgo
things certain, for the hope of things uncertain.

5. For what is more fond, than, as it is in Tully, to have uncertain things
instead of certain?

84. Of the Pismire and the Grasshopper.
1. WHen winter drew near, the Pismire hurried corn into the barn floor In the
Sunshine.

2. The Grasshopper seeing that, she ran to her and begged a Grain.

3. The Pismire said, why do not thou also by my example, hurry what thou
can in Summer, and add to the heap?

4. She answered that she spent that time in singing.

5. The Pismire smiling said, If thou usest to sing in Summer, thou art worthy
to starve now.

6. Mor. We are put in mind by this little fable, whilst yet we have strength
of body, to get those things, whereby our feeble old age may be maintained.

85. Of the Lion and the Bull.
1. A Bull fled from a Lion, and light upon an He-goat: he made at him with his
horns and frowning look.

2. To whom the Bull, being exceeding angry, said, thy sower countenance does
not affright me, but I am afraid of an huge Lion: who if he were not just
behind me, thou should know now, that it is no such small matter to fight
with a Bull, and the Blood to follow from my wound.

3. Mor. We must not add calamity to them that are in calamity.

4. He is sufficiently miserable, that is once miserable.

86. Of the Nurse and the Wolf.
1. A Nurse threatened a boy that cried, that he should be given to the Wolf,
unless he held his peace.

2. The wolf by chance heard it, and tarried at the door in hope of meat.

3. At the least, the Boy grew still, as sleep came upon him.

4. The Wolf go^th back into the wood, fasting and empty.

5. The Fox asks him, where his prey is?

6. The Wolf sighed, and said, I was beguiled: a Nurse threatened to throw away
a Boy that cried; but she deceived me.

7. Mor. Credit is not to be given to a woman.

87. Of the Tortoise and the Eagle.
1. THe Tortoise was grown weary of creeping.

If any one would lift her up into the sky, she promises him orient pearls.

3. The Eagle took her up.

4. He demands his reward.

5. He pinched her with his tall^ns, because she had nothing.

6. Thus the Tortoise, which coveted to see the stars; lost her life among
stars.

7. Mor. Be content with thy condition.

8. There have been some, who if they had remained low, might have been safe;
but being set up aloft have come into danger.

88. Of the Crab-fishes, the Old one and the Young one.
1. THe dam advises the Crabfish that went backward, that he would go forward.

2. The Young one answered, Mother go before and I will follow.

3. Mor. Blame no body for a fault, for which thou may be blamed thy self.

89. Of the Sun and the North Wind.
1. THe Sun and the North Wind try, whether was stronger.

2. They agreed to try their strength upon a traveller, that he should bear the
bell away, that could make his cloak fall off.

3. The North Wind sets upon the Traveller with an horrible roaring storm; but
he makes no stay, but doubles his Cloak about him and went on.

4. The Sun takes strength, which, when the storm was overcome by little and
little; casts forth gleams.

5. The Traveller begins to wax hot, to sweat, to puff and blow.

6. At the last, not being able to go forward he stands to take the cool air
and having cast off his Cloak he sits him down under a tree full of l^aves: and
so the Sun got the victory.

7. Mor. Be sure to have a care, with whom thou strivest.

8. For although thou be strong, yet perhaps there is another stronger than
he; or if not stronger, yet more cunning, so as by his policy he can overcome
^hy strength.

90. Of the Ass.
1. AN Ass comes into a wood, and finds a Lyon's skin; with which being clad he
goes back into the pastures, and affrights the flocks and herds, and ^ak's them
run away.

2. He that had lost him comes, and looks up and down for his Ass.

3. The Ass, as soon as he saw his Master, runs to meet him; nay rather, he
^uns upon him with his roaring.

4 But his Master having caught hold of his cars, that stood out, said, My
^^tle Ass, though thou deceivest others, yet I know thee very well.

5. Mor. Do not make folks believe that thou art, what thou art not: make them
not believe that thou art learned, when thou art unlearned: do not brag that
thou art rich and noble, when thou art beggarly and base.

6. For, when the truth is found out thou will be laughed at.

91. Of the Frog and the Fox.
1. THe Frog went out of the marsh, and professed Physic in the woods, amongst
the wild beasts.

2. She said, she would neither yield to Hippocrates nor Galen.

3. When others believed her, the Fox stouted her.

4. Shall she, quoth he, be accounted skilful in Physic, that has such a pale
look?

5. But let her cure her self.

6. And thus the Fox jeered her; for the frog has a face of a wan color.

7. Mor. It is a point of folly, and a ridiculous thing, to prof^ss that which
thou know not.

92. Of the Dog that would bite.
1. HIs Master tied a little bell to a dog that bit folks ever and anon, that
every one might look to himself.

2. The Dog supposing, that his honor was given for his virtue, scorned those
about him.

3. There comes to this dog, one that was grave in years and reputation,
advising him, that he would not mistake himself; For that bell, says he, is
given thee for a disgrace, not a grace.

4. Mor. A bragging fellow sometimes thinks that is for his commendation, which
is for his discommendation.

93. Of the Camel.
1. A Camel being ashamed of himself, complained, that the bulls went brave
with their two horns, but that he was exposed without defense, to other beasts.

2. He entreats Jupiter to bestow horns on him.

3. Jupiter laughs at the folly of the Camel, and does not only deny his
desire, but also crops his ears.

5. Mor. Let every one be content with his fortune.

6. For, many having pursued a better fortune have come by the worse.

94. Of two Friends and a Bear.
1. TWo friends make a journey: and a Bear meets them on the road.

2. The one having got into a tree, avoids the danger; the other, when there
was no hope of escape, laid himself flat on the ground.

3. The great beast comes to him, and feels him, and searches at his mouth and
his ears

4. When the man held his breath and motion, the bear, which spares dead folks,
supposing it was a dead corpse, goes his way without doing him any hurt.

5. When his fellow asked him afterward, what the beast rounded him in his
ear, as he lay, he said, he advised him this, That he should never go a journey
with such like friends.

6. Mor. Truth is as rare a bird as the Black Swan.

7. Adversity and perils show a true friend.

95. Of the bald Knight.
1. A Bald Knight had fastened a perewig to his cap.

2. He came into the plain field, when a sharp North Wind blew; and when he did
not well heed his periwig, his baldness appeared on a sudden.

3. The company about him set up a laughter, and he laughed himself also.

4. What strange matter is it quoth he, for other men's hair to fly off, when
those that were my own have fallen off long ago?

5. Mor. The Knight did prettily, who was not angry, but laughed at them that
laughed at him.

6. And Socrates when he had got a box on the ear, in the Market, answered on
this fashion. That it was a vexation, that men did not know, when they should
come abroad with an headpiece.

96. Of the two Pots.
1. TWo Pots stood upon the bank-side, the one was an earthen one, and the a
brass one, and the force of the River took them both away.

2. The brass one answered the earthen one, that feared a knocking together,
that it should not fear any thing; for it self would take care sufficient, that
they might not be knocked together.

3. Then the other said, Whether the stream dash me against thee or thee
against me, both will be done to my peril.

Wherefore I am resolved to get farther from thee.

5. Mor. It is better to live with an equal companion, than with a mightier.

6. For thou may be in danger of a mightier man, and not he of thee.

97. Of the Countryman and Fortune.
1. A Country man when he was at plow, found a pot of money in a furrow, he
thanked the earth that had afforded him it.

2. When fortune saw that no honor was given to her, she said thus with her
self:

3. When the treasure is found, the blockish fellow is not thankful unto me,
but when the same treasure is afterward lest, he will solicit me more than all
with his prayers and cries.

4. Mor. When we have received a good turn, let us be thankful to him that has
done us a pleasure.

5. For ingratitude is worthy to be deprived even of a benefit, which it has
but lately received.

98. Of the Bull and the he-Goat.
1. A Bull fl^d from a Lion: he came to a Cave seeking a place to lie hid in.

2. An he-goat that was within, pushed at him as he went in, with his horns*

3. Then the bull roared out these expressions, thou indeed d^st push at me,
now that I fly; but if he shall go away whom I flee from, thou shall then
understand, how much an he-goat differs from a bull's strength.

4. Mor. The he-goat, is one that knows not, that poor folks must be helped,
or at least not hurt.

5. For whosoever shall not refrain from wronging poor folks, if, as fortune is
mutable, poor folks come again to be happy, he shall certainly be sorry, that
he has harmed poor folks.

99. Of the Ape and its Young.
1. JUpiter had commanded all living Creatures to appear in his sight, being to
judge whose young was the fairest.

2. The wild beasts hasten, the birds fly, and the fish also swim to the
contest.

3. The Ape comes in haste, the last of all, drayling her young one with her.

4. At the ugly buttocks of which young, when every one laughed, she said thus,
Let him win whom Jupiter shall like best; yet for all that, in my judgment,
this Cub of mine is a pretty one, and ought to be preferred before all others
young ones.

5. At this saying even Jupiter himself smiled.

6. Mor. Both we and our own things like our selves.

7. But let other men judge concerning us, and our doings, lest if we our
selves judge, we be laughed at as the Ape was.

100. Of the Peacock and the Crane.
1. THE Peacock and the Crane supped together.

2. The Peacock vaunted of her self, showed her tail, and scorneth the Crane.

3. The Crane confesses, the Peacock had fine feathers; but that she her self
cuts through the clouds with her stout flight, whilst the Peacock has much ado
to fly over a house.

4. Mor. Let no man despise another.

5. Every one has his portion, every one has his virtue.

6. He that wants thy virtue, perhaps has that which thou want.

101. Of the Oak and the Reed.
1. THE Oak being broken down by a strong South Wind, was thrown into a river;
and, as it swum, stuck by chance with his boughs upon a Reed.

2. It wonders, that the Reed stood safe in such a whirlwind.

3. It made answer, That she was safe by yielding and giving way; that she
bended at the South Wind, and North Wind, and every blast.

4. And that it was no wonder, that the Oak-fell down, which desired not to
yield but to resist.

5. Mor. Resist not a more powerful man, but overcome him by yielding and
suffering.

6. Which the most elegant Poet Virgil expresses neatly. Which way the fates
do drive, thou gallant man,
Let Us move; by suffering is a way we can
Conquer all fortune.


102. Of the Tiger and the Fox.
1. A Hunter darted at wild beasts.

2. The Tiger bids all wild Beasts stand away, and said, that she only would
make an end of the war.

3. The Hunter darteth on.

4. The Tiger is forthwith wounded.

5. The Fox asked her, as she fled out of the battle, and drew out the dart,
Who had so much wounded a lusty beast?

6. She made answer, That she did not know the causer of her wound; but that
she guessed by the greatness of the wound that it was some Man.

7. Mor. Stout men are for the most part rash; but skill overcomes force, and
with strength.

103. Of the Bulls, and the Lion.
1. THere were four Bulls that resolved to live and die one with another.

2. A Lion espied them feeding together, and although he was hungry, yet, he
was afraid to set upon them all together.

3. First, he labored by cunning words to part them; and then he tears them in
pieces being parted.

4. Mor. Nothing is more strong than concord: discord makes even strong men
weak.

104. Of the Fir Tree and the Brambles.
1. THE Fir Tree is reported, to have once despised the Brambles; it brags that
it was tall, was placed in buildings, and that it stood in ships with a sail;
but that the brambles were low and base, and fit for no service at all.

2. Whose answer was on this manner, Thou Fir Tree, for s^oth, do glory in
thine own good things, and do insult in our ills.

3. But thou do not relate thine own ills, and thou omittest our good things.

4. When thou art cut down with a sounding ax, O how thou could then wish,
thou were like us that are secure.

5. Mor. Both high fortune has its evil, and low fortune its good things.

6. That I may say nothing else, this is secure and safe; but that is neither
without fear, nor without dangen.

7. Horace sings in his Lyrick verses, The loftiest towers are over born,
With greater falls; high hills are torn
With thunder.


105. Of the Fisher and the little Fish.
1. A Little fish being pulled out with a hook entreats the fisher, that he
would let it escape.

2. It said it was but newly spawned by its dam, and that it should not do much
good at a table, seeing it was but yet a very small one: If he would let it go,
it would come again afterward of its own mind to his hook, when it was a good
big one.

3. The fisher said, He would not forgo a certain booty though it was but a
very little one.

4. What I have, quoth he, I know; what I may have I know not: I will not forgo
a bird in the hand for two in the wood.

5. Mor. A thing certain is better than an uncertain; a thing present is better
than that which is to come: although sometimes a small profit being let go has
brought a great one.

106. Of the Bird and her young Ones.
1. A Bird advised her young ones, being laid in standing corn, that they would
be sure to mind, if any thing was spoken concerning the season [or reaping
time] whilst she was away.

2. The young ones being sad, told the dam, when she came back again from
feeding, that the Landlord had let that work to his neighbors.

3. She made answer, that there was no danger.

4. Likewise on another day, being in a fright, they told her, that his friends
were entreated to come and reap.

5. She bids them again be quiet.

6. The third time, as soon as ever she heard that the Landlord and his Son
were resolved, the next morning to begin to shear; Now, quoth she, it is time
for us to get away.

7. I did not fear the neighbors and friends, because I knew they were not
like to come.

8. But I fear the Landlord, for he has a care of the business.

9. Mor. The most of us are slothful in other men's business: but, if thou
would have any thing well looked to, put it not over to another, but look to
it thy self.

107. Of the Covetous and the Envious man.
1. TWo men prayed to Jupiter, a covetous man, and an envious man.

2. Jupiter sends Apollo to satisfy their desires: he grants them both liberty
to wish what they would, on this condition, that what thing soever the one
requested, the other should receive it double.

3. The covetous man makes a stand a great while, because he thinks nothing
will be enough.

4. At the last, he asked a many things, and his fellow received double.

5. Now then, the envious man desired this, That he himself might lose one of
his eyes, being glad that his fellow should be punished with the loss of both.

6. Mor. What can satisfy Covetousness?

7. But nothing is madder than envy, which, so that it may hurt another,
wishes it self a mischief.

108. Of the Lion and the she-Goat.
1. A Lion saw a she-Goat hanging upon a rock full of brambles.

2. He persuades her to come down, to crop the thyme, and the willows in the
plain ground.

3. The she-goat refuses to come down, making a loud answer, that his words
indeed were not ill, but his mind was full of knavery.

4. Mor. Consider who persuades you to any thing.

5. Many persuade thee to things that are good, not for thee, but for
themselves.

109. Of the Crow and the Pitcher.
1. A Thirsty Crow found a Pitcher of water; but the pitcher was too deep for
the Crow to reach to the water.

2. He strives to pour out the pitcher, but he was not able to do it.

3. Then he puts in pebble stones, which he gathered out of the Sand: and by
this means the water is raised, and the Crow drinks.

4. Mor. Sometimes thou shall do that by wisdom and advice, that thou can
not do by force.

110. Of the Lion and the Hunter.
1. A Lion wrangleth with an Hunter.

2. He prefers his own strength beyond a man's strength.

3. After long disputes, the Hunter brings the Lion to a stately Tomb, wherein
a Lion was engraven, laying his head upon a man's knee.

4. The beast said, that was not evidence enough.

5. For he said, Men engrave what they list: but if Lions also were
crafts-masters, a Man should be engraven under the Lions feet.

6. Mor. Every one as far as he can, both says and does what he thinks may
advantage his own party and cause.

111. Of the Boy and the Thief.
1. A Boy sat at a well weeping.

2. A thief asked him the cause of his weeping.

3. The boy said, that the rope was broken, and a pitcher of gold was fallen
into the water.

4. The man stripped himself, and leaped into the well and looked.

5. When he could not find the Vessel, he came up again, and could neither find
the boy nor his coat there.

6. Because the boy had taken his coat, and run away.

7. Mor. They are deceived sometimes, that use to deceive others.

112. Of the Countryman and the Bullock.
1. A Countryman had a bullock that would neither abide tying nor yoking.

2. The man being somewhat cunning, cuts off the beasts horns, for he snag'd
with his horns, then he yoked him, not to the wain, but to the plow, lest as he
was wont, he should kick his Master.

3. He holds the plow himself, being glad that by his pains he had brought it
to pass, that he could now be safe from his horns and hoofs.

4. But what became of it? the bullock every like resisting, fills the
Country-mans head and face with sand, by scraping it abroad with his feet.

5. Mor. There are some so intractable, that they cannot be dealt withal by
skill or any policy.

113. Of the Satyr and Traveller.
1. A Satyr, which was formerly accounted the god of the woods, taking pity of
a Traveller, that was covered with the snow, and starved with cold, brought him
into his cave and cherished him with a fire.

2. And as he blew his hands, he asked him the reason; who made answer, and
said; That they may be warm.

3. Afterward, when they were set down, the Traveller blew his fried barley;
and being asked why he did it, he said, That it may be cold.

4. Then the Satyr presently casting out the Traveller, said, I will not have
him to be in my Cave, that has a mouth of so contrary tempers.

5. Mor. Take heed you live not with a double tongued man, and one that is a
Prot^us in his talk.

114. Of the Boar and the Countryman.
1. THE Countryman cut off the ear of a Boar, that spoiled his corn.

2. He cut off the other ear of him, being found a second time.

3. He caught him when he came again, for all that; and then carried him, being
caught, into the city, as intended for a dainty to his Lord.

4. Now when the beast was cut up at the table, the heart was not to be found.

5. When the Master chased, and asked the Cooks earnestly for it, the Baily
answered; My Lord, it is no wonder that the heart is not to be found, I think
the foolish boar never had any heart.

6. For, if he had had any heart, he would never have returned so often to my
corn, to his own smart.

7. Thus said the Countryman.

8. But all the guests were ready to die with laughing, and set up a loud
laughter at the folly of the Countryman.

9. Mor. Many men's life is so witless, that you may make a question, whether
they have a heart or not.

115. Of the Bull and the Mouse.
1. A Mouse had bitten a Bull by the foot, and run into her hole.

2. The Bull shakes his horns, and seeks for the enemy, but could not see him
any where.

3. The mouse mocks him, and says, Because thou art strong and big, thou must
not therefore scorn every body.

4. Now a little mouse has hurt thee, and that indeed without recompense.

5. Mor. That proverb is thread bare, which I would express more significantly
in our own tongue, Let no man be too heedless of his enemy. In Latin thus: Nemo
hostem suum flocci pendat.

116. Of the Countryman and Hercules.
1. A Country-mans wagon stuck fast in the deep clay.

2. He presently lay all along, and besought the god Hercules to help him.

3. A voice thundered from heaven; it says, Thou feel, whip thy horses, and set
thy shoulders to the wheels, and then call Hercules.

4. For then Hercules will come if he be called.

5. Mor. Idle wishes do no good, which verily God does not heed. They say, Help
thy self, and then God himself will help thee.

117. Of the Goose.
1. THere was a Goose which laid golden eggs, every day one.

2. The owner, that he might become rich on a sudden, kills the goose, hoping
that a treasure lay within her.

3. But when the goose was found empty, the poor man was amazed, and from
thence forward sighed heavily, and took on, that both the thing and the hope of
it, were lost.

4. Mor. Our desires are to be moderated. We must have a care, that we be not
over hasty, or too greedy: for, both too much haste does hurt, and he that
seeks for more than is fitting, does oftentimes get nothing.

118. Of the Grasshopper and the Pismire.
1. WHereas the Grasshopper chirps all Summer, the Pismire is busy about her
harvest; she hurrieth corns inter her hole, laying them up against winter.

2. When the winter grew sharp, the hunger starved Grasshopper came to the
Pismire and begged meat.

3. The Pismire refused to give her any, and told her, That she herself had
taken pains whilst she sung.

4. Mor. He that is slothful in youth shall want in old age; and he that does
not spare, shall beg in time to come.

119. Of the Ape and her two Cubs.
1. WHen as an Ape, as they say, has brought forth two cubs, she loves the
one, and cares not for the other.

2. She had two at a litter, and when a fright came upon her, she, to avoid the
danger, caught that which she loved, in her arms, which (as she ran away in
haste) she dashed against a great stone, and killed.

3. But that which was not regarded, which stuck close on her rough back as she
ran away, remained safe.

4. Mor. It often comes to pass, that parents are an occasion of mischief and
danger to that son, whom they tenderly affect, through their too much
indulgency: whilst he, whom they less affect, behaves himself gallantly and
honestly.

120. Of the Ox and the Steer.
1. AN Ox being now grown ancient, drew the plow every day.

2. A Steer, that had never known labor, skippeth in the Neighboring
pastures, and at last insulteth over the fortune of his elder.

3. He vaunteth, That he never knew yoke or bands, that he was free and at
ease: whereas the Ox had his neck worn bare with labor.

4. And again, That he was stick and in good case: whereas the Ox was rugged
and lean.

5. His elder at that time indeed said nothing to the contrary; but shortly
after he saw this skipper to be drawn to the Altars, and then he speaks to him
in these words.

6. What is thy easy life come to?

7. That secure ease has brought thee to the ax.

8. Now at the least way, as I suppose, thou do rather persuade me to labor,
which preserves me, than to ease, which has now haled thee to the slaughter.

9. Mor. To order our life well, we had need of labor and watcbfulness.

10. But a slothful person, and one that is given to pleasure, shall have that
end of his things, which he would be loath to have.

121. Of the Dog and the Lion.
1. THE dog meets a Lion, and jeers him, saying, Why do thou, poor wretch,
being starved with hunger, run up and down the woods, and by-places?

2. Look upon me, that am fat, and well liking; and I get not these by labor
but by ease.

3. Then the Lion made answer, Thou indeed have thy good fare; but thou fool,
thou have hands withal.

4. Be thou a slave, thou can do like a slave; I indeed am free, and will not
serve.

5. Mor. The Lion answered gallantly; for Liberty is better than any thing
whatsoever.

122. Of the Fishes,
1. A Fresh Water fish was carried into the Sea by the force of the stream:
where it bragging of its nobility, set light by all the Sea kind of fish.

2. The Seal could not endure this, but said, its Nobility should then be
showed, if it being caught with the Seal, should be carried with him to the
market.

3. That he himself should be bought up by the Nobles, but is by the ordinary
sort of people.

4. Mor. Many are so taken with a desire of glory, that they themselves vaunt
and brag of themselves.

5. But the commendation of his own mouth, is not accounted a commendation for
a man, but it is entertained with the laughter of them that hear it.

123. Of the Libard and the Fox.
1. A Libard, that has a speckled back, began to look big upon it; the other
wild beasts, and the very Lions being scorned by him.

2. A Fox comes to him, and persuades him not to be proud, saying, That he
indeed had a gay skin, but himself had a gallant wit.

3. Mor. There is a difference and an order of good things.

4. The Goods of the body, excel the Goods of fortune; and it behooves, that
the Goods of the mind he preferred before them both.

124. Of the Fox and the she-Libard.
1. WHen the she-Libard once set light by a Fox, in comparison of her self,
because she had a skin speckled with all kind of colored spots; the Fox made
answer, That she her self had that comeliness in her mind, which she had in her
skin.

2. Mor. And indeed it is much better to have a nimble wit, than a speckled
skin.

125. Of the Fox and the Cat.
1. WHen once the Fox, in a discourse that she had with the Cat, bragged, that
he had several shifts, so that he had even a budget full of tricks; the Cat
answered, That she had but one shift only to rely upon, if any danger should be.

2. As they were talking, on a sudden, a cry was heard, of dogs coming toward
them.

3. Then the Cat leaped into a very high tree, whereas the Fox in the interim
being surrounded with a kennel of Hounds, was caught.

4. Mor. The fable implies, that one device is better sometimes, so that it be
true and effectual, than many tricks and vain devices.

126. Of the King and the Apes.
1. A King of Egypt taught some Apes, that they might perfectly learn how to
dance.

2. For, as no living creature does more resemble the shape of a man, so none
else does better, or more willingly, imitate men's actions.

3. Therefore after they were very well taught the art of dancing, they began
to dance, being clad in purple ro^es, and disguised: and the show took very
well a long time, till a conceited merry man, among the spectators, threw nuts
amongst them which he carried privately in his pocket.

4. Then presently the Apes, as soon as they had seen the nuts, having
forgotten the dance, began to be that which they were before: and ox a sudden
from dancers* they returned to Apes: and having torn their visards and rent
their Clothes, they scrambled one with another for the nuts, to the exceeding
great laughter of the beholders.

5. Mor. This fable advertiseth us, that the ornaments of fortune, do not alter
a neans disposition.

127. Of the Ass and the Travelers.
1. WHen two men by chance had found an Ass in the desert, they began to fall
out betwixt themselves whether of them should lead him home as their own.

2. For he seemed to be offered by fortune to both alike.

3. In the mean time, whilst they wrangled about this matter one with another,
the Ass got away, and neither of them enjoyed him.

4. Mor. Some men fall short of present advantage, which through their
ignorance they know not how to make use of.

128. Of the Fishermen.
1. SOme fishermen having cast in their nets, haled out Tortoises.

2. When they had shared them amongst themselves, and were not able to eat them
up all, they invited Mercury, as he chanced to come to them, to their cheer.

3. But he, perceiving that he was not at all invited out of any good will, but
that he might ease them from over glutting themselves with the meat, (...), and
had them eat the Tortoises themselves, which they had aught.

4. Mor. Some men after they have unadvisedly undertaken any thing, implore
other men's and, whom they may engage in their own business.

129. Of the Ass.
1. AT Cumanum, an Ass, that was weary of his slavery, having broken the
bridle, had run away into a forest: He fitted a Lions skin, which by chance he
had found there, to his body, and so behaved himself instead of a Lion;
frighting both men and wild beasts with his voice and tail.

2. For the Cumani do not know a Lion.

3. This disguised Ass therefore, bare sway a great while after this manner,
being taken and feared for an huge Lion; till a stranger going to Cumae, (one
who had oftentimes seen both a Lion and an Ass, and therefore it was no hard
matter for him to know him) found that it was an Ass by his loaf ears, and by
some other signs, and brought him home, being soundly cudgeled; and restored
him to his master, that owned him.

4. Now in the mean time, the Ass being already owned, made all the people of
Cumanum laugh exceedingly, whom ere while* he being thought to be a Lion, had
almost frighted to death.

5. Mor. We cannot well hide those vices which have grown up with us, ever
since we were children.

130. Of the Beetle and the Eagle.
1. A Beetle on a time, being slighted by an Eagle, began to think of taking
revenge one way or other.

2. He searched diligently where the Eagle had built her nest; the Beetle crept
to it, and threw down her eggs, with the like wile.

3. When the Eagle had of en changed her dwelling, and did no good, she went to
Jupiter her Patron, and told him her misery.

4. He bids her lay her, eggs in his lap, which were like to be safe even in
that place.

5. But the peevish Beetle crept hither also, by the welts and plaits of his
clothes, whilst Jupiter never felt it at all.

6. Afterward, when Jupiter saw the eggs to be stirred, and did not well mind,
being affrighted at the strangeness of the matter, he shaked his lap, and threw
them on the ground.

7. Mor. This fable teaches us, That no man, though he be never so little, is
to be undervalued.

131. Of the Satyr and the Countryman.
1. A Satyr, when he was very cold, in an extraordinary great frost, was
brought into his house and entertained by a Countryman.

2. And wondering why the man blew into his hands, which he held to his mouth,
he asked him why he did so?

3. He made answer, That he might warm his cold hands, with the warmth of his
breath.

4. After wards when, after a fire was made, and the Table furnished, he blew
again into his hot pottage; He wondering also the more at him, enquired of him
what this might mean.

5. That I might cool my pottage, quoth he, which is too hot, with my breath.

6. Then the Satyr rising from the table says, What do I hear?

7. Do thou blow both hot and cold too, out of the same mouth?

8. You shall pack.

9. For, I do not like to live in the same house with such a man.

10. Mor. Double tongued men are here set out, who sometimes commend, and
sometimes discommend the same man.

132. Of the Lark and her young ones.
1. AESop, that Fabulist of Phrygia, was, for good reason, thought to be a wise
man, because he did not severely and imperiously command and censure what were
good to be advised and persuaded unto, as the Philosophers are wont to do, but,
having feigned merry and delightful tales, he brought into men's understandings
and minds, things that were wholesomly and heedfully taken notice of, with a
winning way of hearing.

2. At this little fable of his, concerning a little bird's little nest, does
prettily and pleasantly premonish, that the hope and confidence of business,
which one may dispatch, is never to be put in another, but in ones self.

3. There is a little bird, quoth he, her name is a Lark, she lives and builds
her nest in the standing corn, about the time almost that harvest is ready, her
young ones being just then ready to fly.

4. That Lark as it fell out, was gone into a crop of corn, that was sooner
ripe than ordinary; and therefore when the corn began to grow white, her young
ones were not fledged.

5. Therefore when she went to seek meat for her young, she warned them, that
they should take notice, if any new thing were there said or done, and that
they should tell it her, when she came back again.

6. Afterward the owner of that corn calls his son being a young man, and
says, Do thou not see that these are ripe, and require hands now?

7. Therefore to morrow, as soon as it shall be light see thou go to our
friends, and entreat them that they would come and lend us their pains, and
help us in with this harvest.

8. When he had said these words, he went his way: and when the Lark came again
her young ones quivering, made a noise about her, and entreated their dam that
she would now make haste quickly and remove her self into another place.

9. For the owner, (...) they, has sent his son to entreat his friends, that
they would come by peep of day, and shear.

10. The dam bids them, not to fear any thing.

11. For if the owner, quoth she, has put off his harvest to his friends, the
corn will not be shorn to morrow; nor is there any great need, that I should
take you away to day.

12. On the day after therefore, the dam flies abroad to get meat; the Master
tarries for them that he had entreated; the Sun grows hot^ and nothing is
done, and there were no friends.

13. Then says he again to his son, Those friends are for the most part of
them idle persons: but let us two go rather, and entreat our Cousins and
kinsfolks, and neighbors, that they may come to morrow in time to shea^*

14. The young ones being affrighted told this in like manner to their dam^*

15. The dam exhorts them that then also they would not fear, nor take any
care; she says, That no Cousins, or Kinsfolks almost, were so bane, as to make
no delay to take a toil upon them, and to do as they are bidden presently:
Only mind you, quoth she, if so be any thing be said again any further.

16. Another morning betimes, the bird went to feed, the cousins and kinsfolks
forbear the pains, which they were entreated to afford.

17. At the last therefore the Master said to his Son, Let our friends and our
kindred farewell, thou shall bring two sickles, as soon as ever it is day, I my
self will take one to me, and thou shall take the other to thee, and we our
selves will shear the corn to morrow with our own hands.

18. When the dam heard of her young ones, that the Master said that; she said,
It is time to give place, and to be gone.

19. It will now without question be done, what he has said shall be.

20. For now it rests in him, whom the matter concerns, not in another, of
whom help is desired.

21. And so the Lark removed from her nest, and the corn was shorn by the owner
of it.

22. Mor. This indeed is a Fable of Aesop's, touching the relying upon friends
and near acquaintance which is for the most part light and vain.

23. But what else do the purer books of the Philosophers advise us, than that
we should trust to our selves only; and that we should esteem all other things,
which are without us, and without our mind, neither for ours, nor for us.

24. Ennius in his Satyrs, has very wittily and handsomely comprised this tale
of Aesop's, in well compacted verses: the two last whereof are these, which
Iverily think it is worth the labor, to have in ones heart and memory.

25. Be sure this thing be always in thy thought; What thou can do, trust not
thy friends for ought.

133. Of the Birds and the Owl.
1. ALmost all the birds once went to the Owl, and entreated her, that
hereafter she would not build in the false roofs of houses, but rather in the
boughs of a tree, and amongst the green branches, for there she might more
sweetly take the pleasure of the spring.

2. Moreover, they showed her a little Oak, that was newly sprung up, and
somewhat tender as yet; in which forsooth the Owl, as they said, might
sometimes sit softly, and make her nest for her self.

3. But she said, she would not do it.

4. But, on the other side, she gave them counsel, that they should not trust
themselves to that little tree.

5. For it would one time or other bring forth bird-lime, to wit, the very bane
of birds.

6. They, as they are a light and flickering kind, scorned the counsel of a
wise Owl.

7. Now the Oak was grown up, now it was spread, now it was full of green
leaves.

8. Behold, there all the birds flutter by flocks in the boughs, they are
merry, they hop up and down, they play together, and they chirp.

9. In the mean time, that Oak had brought forth bird-lime, and men had
observed it; thereupon, all the poor birds alike, were entangled there on a
sudden; and when it was too late, they repented themselves in vain, because
they had scorned that whole some advice.

10. And they say, this is the reason, why all the birds now, when they see the
Owl, thronging about her do as it were compliment her, bring her along, follow
her, sit about her, and fly about her.

11. For, remembering her advice, they now admire her as one that is wise, and
stand round about her in a throng, that forsooth, they may once learn of her to
be wise.

12. But I think to no purpose, nay indeed, also sometimes to their great harm.

13. For those ancient Owls were wise in good earnest; and now there are many
Owls, which indeed have the feathers, and the eyes, and the beak of Owls, but
they have not the wisdom.

14. Mor. This fable teaches you, that you do not scorn the Counsel of him,
that gives you good advice.

134. Of the Gourd and the Pine Tree.
1. A Gourd was once sown near a Pine Tree, which was a very great one, and had
broad boughs.

2. Now the Gourd, when it was grown big with many showers, and seasonableness
of the weather, began to be wanton, and to reach out its boughs somewhat
saucily.

3. Now it crept into the Pine, now it advanced to get up, now it adventured to
wrap about the boughs and green branches, making show of its greater leaves,
its white flowers, and of its huge and fresh green fruits.

4. Therefore it grew so proud and insolent that it adventured to challenge the
Pine Tree, and says, Thou see how I out-go thee, how I excel in large
leaves, how I excel in greenness, and straightway overtop thee.

5. Then the Pine, which was gravely wise and strong, did not at all wonder at
the boldness of the saucy Gourd, but answered it thus.

6. I have here abode many winters, heats, sun burnings, and sundry calamities,
and do yet remain sound.

7. Thou will have less presumption at the first frost nips, when both thy
leaves shall fall down, and all thy greenness shall be gone.

8. Mor. We must not be proud in prosperity.

135. Of the Crow and the Wolves.
1. A Crow bears the Wolves company along steep tops of the high mountains: she
desires that she might have a part of the prey, because having followed them
she had at no time left them, and she had been a companion.

2. Afterward she was shaken off by the Wolves, as having not followed them,
but the prey and the meat; and was no less like to devour the inwards of the
Wolves, if they should be killed, than she did of other living creatures.

3. Mor. We must not always look upon what we do, but how we stand affected
when we do it.

136. Of the Earth's labor.
1. THE earth on a time being grown big* and wonderfully swollen, made show, as
if she would bring forth some great thing.

2. They that dwell near, run to her, the husbandmen stand amazed; they between
hope and fear expect the earth's delivery.

3. Some thought, that that Typhoeus, with an hundred hands; others thought,
that mountains were like to burst forth.

4. The earth is opened, there came forth a Mouse; and they turned that into a
laughter and a jest, which was thought would be a wonder to all.

5. Mor. We must not always believe gay promises.

137. Of the Members and the Belly.
1. Man's joints, when they saw the belly idle, fell out with it, and denied it
their help.

2. When they also by th^^ means fainted, they understood, that the belly
divided the meat, which it had received throughout all the members; and they
became friends with it again.

3. Mor. Great matters decay by discord, they avail by concord.

138. Of Arion and the Dolphin.
1. ARion was an ancient and famous Fiddler.

2. He was of the place and town Methymna, and of the Country and Isle Lesbos.

3. Periander the King of Corinth esteemed that Arion as a friend, and loved
him for his skill.

4. He travels thence from the King, to see the famous Countries Sicily and
Italy.

5. When he came thither, he pleased both the ears and the minds of all, in the
Cities of both the Lands; and there the men prized him, took pleasure in him,
and loved him.

6. He then afterward, having gotten good store of money, and a good estate,
resolved to return to Corinth.

7. He therefore chose a ship and mariners, that were Corinthians, as being
better known, and more friends to him. But the Corinthians, after they had
entertained that man, and the ship was carried into the deep, being greedy of
the booty and the money, took counsel about killing Arion.

8. Then he, when he understood the villainy, ^ave them his money, and his other
things that they might have it; and entreated them that they would but spare
his life.

9. The Mariners were so far moved with these prayers of his, that they forbear
to kill him by force with their own hands; but commanded him to leap headlong
presently into the sea before their faces.

10. The man being daunted at that, and all hope of life being lost, afterward
entreated this one thing, that before he died, they would give him leave to put
on his clothes, and to take his fiddle, and to sing a song of that his hap^
which might be able to comfort him.

11. Then the wild and savage Seamen had a great desire to hear him.

12. He obtains what he had entreated.

13. And there presently, being girt after his manner, clothed, made fine, and
standing upon the hatches of the top of the stem, he sung the ^ong which us
called Orthyum, with a very loud voice.

14. Toward the end of his song, he threw himself a good way into the deep,
with his fiddle, and all his dressing, as he stood, and sung.

15. The Mariners, not making any other question, but that he had perished,
held on in the course which they had begun to make.

16. But a strange, and wonderful, and loving act befell, a Dolphin on a
sudden swam to him amongst the waves, and holding up his back above the w^ves,
took him up, and carried him with his body and clothes safe to Taenarus, in the
country of Laconia.

17. Then Arion went quite from that place to Corinth, and offered himself to
King Periander, as he had been carried by the Dolphin, and told him the thing
as it had happened.

18. The King did not believe it, but gave order, that Arion should be kept in
prison, as if he deceived him: and in a dissembling manner asked the Seamen,
being sought for, whilst Arion was kept close, whether they had heard any thing
concerning Arion, in those places from whence they came.

19. They said the man was in Italy when they went thence, and did very well
there, and that the Cities did much affect him, and delight in him, and that he
was happy in their favor, and store of money.

20. Then whilst they speak these words, Arion slipped forth with his harp and
clothes, with which he had cast himself into the Sea.

21. The Mariners being astonished and convicted, could not deny.

22. Mor. This fable teaches us that more pity is sometimes found in the brute
creatures, than in those men, that, besides wealth, have no worth; besides
shape, nothing of a man.

139. Of the Spider and the Gout.
1. THE Spider being somewhat more at leisure from weaving; walked seasonably
abroad to refresh her self.

2. The Gout offers to meet her though she could very hardly overtake her by
uneven strides.

3. After that days journey was pretty well passed, they were not far from a
little town, which the Inhabitants of that Country called Tyche.

4. They took both a resolution, to seek out an host agreeable to their
condition.

5. The Spider, without making much ado, goes to lodge in a rich man's house,
there she hangs out her webs on every side, and spreads out her nets.

6. Presently there came, I know not what ugly faces, which pulled down her
weavers shop.

7. Therefore her buildings were but for a little while, which way soever she
turned her self.

8. For she could no where avoid the Grooms beesoms, that could espy a thing
quickly.

9. She was in a very sad condition, which alone was vexed and troubled, amidst
such plenty of all things.

10. But the Gout, like a poor beggar had at last with much ado, got leave to
come into a poor man's cottage: when she had sat down in that place she endured
all kind of miseries.

11. Coarse bread was set before her, when she had a mind to her supper, and a
pot of water, when she could scarce gape, because her chaps were so dry.

12. A boarded bed was spread, not with green leaves, not with grass, but with
small chaff for her that was weary with travel on the day time.

13. And it is not my purpose now to tell, how hardly such hard bedding, such
coarse ruggs agreed with her soft members, with a skin (as I may say^ of silk.

14. That stately Star therefore, which hears and sees all things, was scarce
risen, when the Spider and the Gout met again together.

15. The Spider first tells the troubles of the night past, the changing of so
many places, sometimes blaming the Master's neatness, and sometimes the
overmuch observance of the Groom.

16. The Gout, on the contrary, frames many stories, concerning the poverty of
her Host, nor has she leisure to show the Spider the blew marks, which the
hard bed-stead had made in her tender skin.

17. They make a motion that the Spider ought thenceforward to enter into poor
men's cottages, and the Gout into rich men's halls; they both willingly
condescend to this opinion.

18. But yet, as it grew darker and darker, they drew near to a City.

19. The Gout not forgetting what was decreed upon, stole softly into the house
of a certain monied man.

20. Who being, as good hap was, espied by the Master, O strange, with what
kind respect, with what courtesy and with what complements was she entertained!

21. Swan-down beds, and bolsters stuffed with the underwing down of Partridges,
were put and spread under her.

22. I forbear to speak of the Hypocras, the Alicant, the wine of Lesbos, and
of Tarentum.

23. I forbear to speak of the Snap-figs, the Pheasants, and these small birds,
which pride it with two colors.

24. In short, there was no delight, no pleasure, which she enjoyed not.

25. The Spider having entered into the poor man's cottage, weaves her webs;
which way soever the wall lies with open distances she hangs her nets.

26. She bestirs her self busily about her round fashioned work; she mends what
was broken, she finishes what was begun: and, that I may speak briefly, she
bears all the sway in the empty house.

27. She fears no ambuscadoes, she fears no open on sets; nay indeed she is out
of the reach of besoms.

28. Not long after, the Gout meets the Spider, she set out at large her
delights, her happiness, her fortunes.

29. The Spider extolls her Empire, and her liberty to weave, with wonderful
commendations.

30. This resolution at the last liked them both, that what way soever they
traveled, the Gout should turn into rich men's ^ouses, and the Spider into poor
men's Cottages.

31. Mor. Though this Apologue may be applied to several uses, yet it declares
this especially, that one is in one place more fortunate than in another.

32. Besides, that great men's houses are the receptacles of diseases.

33. Lastly, that there is no where greater liberty, than where there is less
wealth.

140. Of the Mouse that was bred in a Chest.
1. A Mouse that was bred in a Chest, had spent almost all her life there,
being fed with nuts, which used to be kept in it.

2. As she was playing about the sides of the Chest, and had fallen down, and
sought how to get up again she found good cheer very daintily provided.

3. Which when she had begun to taste she said, How foolish have I been
hitherto, who thought nothing in the world to be better th^n my Chest, look
what sweeter meats I eat here!

4. Mor. This fable shows, that we must not be so in love with our country if
it be mean, as not to g^ to other places, seeing we may be more happy elsewhere.

141. Of the Countryman that had obtained, that Wheat might grow without
Beards.
1. A Countryman had obtained of Ceres, that Wheat should grow without beards,
lest it should hurt the hands of them that did shear or ^hresh it: which, as
soon as it ripened was eaten up by the little birds.

2. Then said the Countryman, how deservedly do I suffer, who have lost very
great profits, for a little convenience sake.

3. Mor. This fable signifies, that small inconveniences are to be weighed
with a greater profit.

142. Of the Hawk, that pursued the Pigeon.
1. WHen a Hawk pursued a Pigeon with a speedy flight, he went into a
Farm-house, and the Countryman caught him.

2. Whom he entreated in a fair manner, that he would let him go: for, said he,
I have done thee no hurt.

3. To whom the Countryman made answer, neither had the Pigeon hurt thee.

4. Mor. This fable shows, that they are deservedly punished, who strive to
hurt the innocent.

143. Of the Spider and the Swallow.
1. A Spider being vexed against a Swallow, because she caught flies, which are
her meat, had hanged her nets in a door stead, through which she used to fly,
that she might catch her.

2. But the Swallow, as she flew, carried the nets, with her that wove them
through the air.

3. Then the Spider hanging in the air, and perceiving that she was like to
perish presently said:

4. How justly do I suffer these things, which having much ado to catch the
least things that fly, with great toil, did think that I could hold such great
birds!

5. Mor. We are advised by this fable, not to undertake things beyond our
strength.

144. Of a Countryman that was to pass over a River.
1. A Countryman being to pass over a River, which by chance had grown big
with showers, sought for a ford.

2. And when he had first tried that part of the River, which seemed more quiet
and still, he found it deeper, than he had thought in his mind.

3. Again where he found it more shallow and safe there the streams ran with a
greater noise of waters.

4. Then he said to himself, how more safely may we commit our life to waters
that make a great noise, than to them that are still and quiet.

5. Mor. We are admonished by this fable, that we should less fear men that are
full of words, and use to threaten, than still men.

145. Of the Pigeon and the Magpy.
1. A Pigeon being asked by a Magpy, what persuaded her to build always in the
same place, seeing her young ones were always taken thence from her?

2. Answered, Simplicity.

3. Mor. This fable shows* that honest men are oftentimes easily deceived.

146. Of the Cuckoo and the Hawk.
1. THE Cuckoo was jeered by the Hawk that, whereas she was as big bodied as
she, and not unlike in color to her (for narrowness of spirit) she would
rather eat earthworms, than the sweet flesh of other birds.

2. Within a few days after, she saw the Hawk being caught by a Countryman,
whose pigeons she pursued, to hang down from an high turret, for the terror of
others.

3. To whom the Cuckoo said, Friend, how much better had it been for you to
hunt worms, than to make after other folks birds?

4. Mor. This fable shows, that their life is safer, and more to be liked of,
that are content with their own things without danger, than theirs who coveting
other men's things, undergo great perils of life.

147. Of the Ass and the Calf.
1. THE Ass and the Calf feeding in the same pasture, had perceived by the
sound of a Bell that the Enemies army came toward them.

2. Then the Calf said, O companion, let us run away hence, lest the enemies
carry us away prisoners.

3. To whom the Ass said, Do thou run away, whom the enemies have used to kill
and eat.

4. It makes no matter to the Ass, to whom the same article of carrying a
burden is every where offered.

5. Mor. This fable admonishes servants that they do not much fear to change
their Masters, if so be that they are not like to be worse than their former.

148. Of the Fox and the Women that eat the Hens.
1. A Fox passing by a farm-house, espied a company of women, very silently
eating a great many hens, very daintily roasted.

2. Toward whom she turning her self said, What outcries and barking of dogs
would there be against me, if I should do that which you do?

3. To whom an old woman answering said, Thou base creature, we (...) those
things that are our own, but thou stealest other men's things.

4. Mor. This fable advises us, that we do not think, we may do that with
other men's things, which the owners may do.

149. Of the fat Capons and the lean one.
1. A Man had largely crammed many Capons, which were shut up in the same coop,
who were made fat all saving one, whom his fellows mocked as a lean rascal.

2. The Master being to entertain some noble guests, at a dainty and costly
feast, commands the cook, that he should kill and dress some of those, which he
should find fatter than others.

3. The fat ones hearing this troubled themselves, saying, How much better had
it been for us, to be lean.

4. Mor. This fable was invented for poor men's comfort, whose life is safer

after the Hare, which nevertheless he could not catch, by reason of her
incredible swiftness.

4. Which when the young fellow saw, he laughed exceedingly, and thought the
old man doted, who thought, he could beat him down out of the tree with grass.

4. When thou perceivedst thy eyes to grow dim, thy hearing to be less, and thy
other senses day by day to fail, and thy body to wax unweildly, did not I tell

made as though he were dead.

2. Now the Bear coming to him, smelt at his ears and the hinder part of his
head, whilst he that lay all along, held his breath continually; so the Bear
thinking that he was dead, went his way.

3. For they say, that a Bear does not exercise his savageness upon dead bodies.

wolfs face; and after he had broken his forehead, his nose, and his teeth, he
ran away: whilst the wolf blamed himself, and said, That he was rightly served,

should follow this dream, he built a very ^ine roof, and very pleasant, with
tretted roofs and windows.

3. And bringing his son thither, he looked strictly to him every day.

4. For he had painted in the house all sorts of living creatures, for his sons
delight: amongst which he had also painted a lion.

5. The young man looking upon these things, became so much the more troubled.

6. And standing one time nearer the lion, he said:

7. O thou most cruel beast, I am kept in this house, as in a prison because of
a vain dream of my fathers: What shall I do to thee?

8. And as he said this, he struck his hand against the wall, having a mind to
put out the lion's eyes: and he hit it upon a nail that lay hid there.

9. Upon which blow his hand rankled, and the matter festered underneath, and a
fever came upon it, and the young man died in a short time.

10. Thus the lion killed the young man, whilst his father's foppery did no

1. AN Eagle and a Fox having made a league of amity betwix^ themselves,
resolved to dwell hard by one another, supposing their friendship would be the
more f^m by their often converse.

2. The Eagle therefore made her nest upon a high tree, and the (...) laid her
cubs near the tree, among the bramble bushes.

3. One day then, when the fox went out of her kennel to seek something
wherewithal to feed her cubs, the Eagle even her self lacking meat, flew into
the covert, and snatched away the foxes cubs, and gave them to her young ones to
eat.

4. When the fox came back again, and understood of the cruel death of her
young ones, she was very sorrowful.

5. And whereas she was not able to revenge her self of the Eagle, because,
being a four-footed beast, she could not pursue a bird, she curse^ the eagle, (
a thing which is incident to the poor and impotent) and wished some mischief or
other might befall her.

6. Into so great a hatred is violated friendship turned.

7. It befell then in those days, that a goat was sacrificed in the country, a
piece whereof the eagle snatched away, together with the live coals, and
carried it to her nest; but when the wind blew somewhat high, (...) nest, which
was made of hay, and small and dry sticks, was burnt.

8. As Soon as the Eagle's young ones felt the fire, because they were not yet
able to fly, they fell down to the ground.

avoid the vengeance of them whom they have hurt, yet shall no^ escape the
judgment of God.

35. Of the Eagle, and the Raven.
1. AN Eagle flying down from an high rock, snatched a lamb away ou^ of a flock
of sheep; which thing when a raven saw, being moved with emulation she flew
upon a Ram, with a great deal of noise and croaking, and so fastened her claws
into the Rams fleece, that she could not rid her self thence, no not by the
fluttering of her wings.

2. When the shepherd saw her thus entangled, he ran to the raven, and caught
her; and after he had cut her wings, he gave her to his children to play
withal.

3. But when one asked the raven what bird she was, the raven said, Heretofore
indeed, according to mine own conceit, I was an Eagle; but now I know verily,
that I am but a Raven.

Mor. This fable signifies, that he that dares to attempt any thing beyond
his strength, does only bring this about, that he falls too often into
adversity, and makes himself ridiculous to the common sort.

36. Of the Eagle, and the dung-Beetle.
1. AN Eagle pursued an Hare; the Hare not knowing what to do, seeing a Beetle,
which the opportunity offered her, besought help of it: to whom the Beetle

that she would not take us servant away from it by force.

3. But the Eagle scorning the beetle's littleness, devoured the hare before
its face.

4. But the beetle remembering the wrong done it, minded where the Eagle built.

5. Lo, the Eagle lays her eggs, the beetle being carried aloft with its
wings, flies to the Eagle's nest, and rolling out the eggs, threw them down to
the ground.

6. The eagle being grieved for the loss of her eggs, flew to Jupiter (for she
is a bird consecrated to that god) and desired him, that she might have a safe
place granted to lay her eggs in.

7. Jupiter gave her leave, that when the time comes, she should lay her eggs
in his lap.

8. The beetle foreseeing this, made a ball of dung, and flying up on high, let
it fall upon Jupiters lap.

9. Jupiter being desirous to shake the ball out of his lap, shak'd out the
Eagles eggs also with it.

10. From that time to this, they say, the eagle never lays whilst the
beetles are in being.

Mor. This fable signifies, that no man surely is to be despised; because
there is no body that receives a wrong, but may seek to revenge himself when

7. Placent, quae officiunt: quae conferunt, displicent.

8. Beatitudinem cupimus, priusquam, ubi fit, intelligamus.

Pinus, and celsae graviore casu
Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos
Fulmina montes.

praesidio destitutas laniant.

41. De Simia and Vulpecula.
SImia vulpeculam orat, ut partem caudae sibi donet ad tegendas nates, illi
enim esse oneri, quod sibi foret usui and honori.

opus est.

^. Mox deinde introgreditur herus, qui, ut servi negligentiam cor^at, cuncta
lustrans oculis, and praesepe m^nu tentans, cervi depre^dit sub foeno cornua,
inclamat famulos, accurrunt, feram conclu^t, capiunt.

^. Mor. In adversis rebus, periculis, latebrae difficiles sunt inventu, quia
miseros, ut coepit, fortuna exagitar, aut, quia ipsi, me^u imiti, consilii
semet imprudentia produnt.

43. De Leone and Vulpecula.
^Eo aegrotabat, visebant animalia, una officium differente Vulpecula.

^. Ad hanc legatum mittit leo cum epistola, quae venire admoneat, ^issimam rem
aegroto fore ejus unius praesentiam, nec quicquam ^^uli fore cur vulpecula
metuat, leonem enim (...) 3. Deinde aegrotum esse, and decumbere, ut etiamsi (
id quod non erat) velit, nocere tamen non queat.

4. Rescribit vulpecula, Optare se ut Leo convalescat, idque oraturam superos,
caeterum minime visuram; terreri enim se vestigiis.

5. Quae quidem vestigia cum omnia sint antro leonis adversa, and nulla aversa,
eam rem indicium esse, multum quidem animalium introisse, sed exisse nullum.
Horatius. 6. Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni,
Respondit, referam; Quia me vestigia terrent,
Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.


7. Mor. Cave fidem habeas verbis. Ni caveris, saepe tibi dabuntur verba.

judicanda.

42. De Vulpecula and Mustela.

frumenti repsit: in qua cum probe pasta fuit, deinde rursus tentantem egredi
distentus impedit venture.

2. Mustela luctantem procul contemplata, tandem monet, si exire cupiat, ad
cavum macra redeat, quo macra intraverat.

3. Mor. Videas complures in mediocritate laetos esse, atque alacres, vacuos
curis, expertes animi molestiis.

4. Sin hi divites facti fuerint, videbis eos moestos incedere, nunquam frontem
porrigere, plenos curis, animi molestiis obrutos.

5. Hanc fabellam sic Horatius canit, lib. 1. Epist. 7. Forte per angustum
tenuis Vulpecula rimam.
Repserat in cumeram frumenti: pastaque rursus
Ire for as pleno tendebat corpore, fr^stra.
Cui Mustela procul, Si vis, ait, effugere is it hinc,
Macra cavum repetas arctum,quem macra subisti.


43. De Equo and Cervo.
1. EQuus gerebat bellum cum Cervo.

2. Pulsus tandem e pascuiis, implorabat opem humanam.

3. Redit cum homine, descendit in campum; victus antea jam fit victor.

4. Sed tamen, host devicto and sub jugum misso, ipse victor necesse est
serviat Homini.

5. Equitem fert dorso, fraenum ore.

6. Mor. Dimicant multi contra paupertatem: qua per fortunam and industriam
victa, saepe victoris interit libertas.

7. Domini quippe and victores paupertatis servire incipiunt divitiis; anguntur
avaritiae flagris, parsimoniae cohibentur fraenis: nec quaerendi tenent modum,
nec ( justo quidem avaritiae supplicio) ^artis rebus

8. De hac re Horatius. lib. 1. Epistolarum 10. Epist. Cervus equum pugna
melior, communibus herbis
Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo.
Imploravit opes hominis, fraenumque recepit.
Sed postquam victor violence discessit ab host,
Non equitem dorso, non fraenum depulit ore.
Sic, qui pauperiem veritus, potiore metallis
Liberate caret, dominum ve^et improbus, atque
Serviet aternum, quia parvo nesciat uti.


46. De duobus Adolescentibus.

insimulare.

4. Qui abstulerat, per Jovem nihil habere: is vero qui habuit, nil se
abstulisse identidem pejerat.

5. Ad quos, Me quidem, inquit coquus, fur nunc latet: sed is inspexit, is
scit, per quem jurastis.

6. Mor. Si quid peccavimus, id statim non sciunt homines: at Deus omnia videt,
qui sedet super coelos and intuetur abyssos.

7. Quod si cogitent homines, suppressius prudentiusque peccabitur.

47. De Cane, and Lanio.
1. CAnis in macello, cum lanio carnem abstulisset, in pedes sese continuo,

procul acclamavit, O furacissime curre tutus, impune tibi licet. tutus enim es
nunc ob celeritatem; posthac autem cautius observaberis.

1. AGno comitanti caprum lupus fit obviam: rogitat, cur, reli^^^ matre, olidum
potius sequatur hircum: suadetque ut ad distenta (...) matris ubera redeat:
sperans ita fore, abductum ut laniet.

2. Ille vero, Matter me, O Lupe, inquit, huic commisit: huic summa cura
servandi data est: parenti potius quam tibi obsequendum, qui me reducere istis
dictis postulas, subductum mox discerpere.

3. Mor. Noli omnibus fidem habere: multi enim, dum aliis videntur velce
prodesse, sibi interdum consulunt.

50. De Adolescente and Cato.
1. ^Um adolescens quidam in deliciis amoribusque usurpasse^ catum, Venerem
precibus fatigavit, ut catum in foeminam tranfiguraret.

misere amanti perplacuit: nempe, tota succi plenula, tota candidula, tota
clegantula.

mutasset and mores, per impluvium immittit muscul^^^

singulos brevi circundatum funiculo effringere.

2. Imbecilla nequicquam conatur aetatula.

3. Solvit pater, redditque singulis virgulam; quam cum pro (...) quis^ que
vireculis facile frangeret, O, inquit, filioli, sio concordes, (...) vos
vincere poterit nemo.

4. Sed si mutuis volueritis sevire vulneribus, atque int estinum (...) bellum
eritis tandem praeda hostibus.

5. Mor. Docet hic Apologus, Concordia parvas res crescere, discordia magnas
dilabi.

52. De Rustico and Equo.
1. RUsticus equum vacuum, asinumque sarcinulis egregie onustum producit ad
viam.

53. De Carbonario and Fullone.
1. FUllonem invitabat carbonarius, ut secum in unis aedibus habitaret.

enim magnopere ne quae ego eluam, tu reddas tam atra quam carbo est.

3. Mor. Monemur hoc Apologo, cum inculpatis ambulare, monemur sceleratorum
hominum consortium, velut pestem quandam, devitare.

4. Trahunt ( inquit Campanus) hominum sodalitia, commercia etiam in mores
penetrant, and perinde quisque evadit, ut ii quibuscum versatur.

ipse dispereo.

res uovas moliuntur.

55. De Buccinatore.
1. BUccinator quidam ab hostibus capitur, abducitur.

2. Trepidare ille, supplicare ut parcant innoxio: se, quando nihil armorum
unquam praeter unam buccinam gestaverit, hominem ne potuisse quidem occidere,
nedum voluisse.

3. Illi contra murmr, tum saevo tum verberibus, in^onant.

4. Nil agis, scelus, maxim noces; atque nunc hic trucidabert: quod cum ipse
(ut sateris) sis rei militaris imperitus, cornu isto tuo aliorum excitas
evibrasque animos.

5. Mor. Gravissime peccant nonnulli, qui, ad mala alioqui satis pronis
principibus, ut inique agant, consulunt, atque hujusmodi quaedam ad illorum
aures occinunt.

6. Quid etiam dubitas? An te principem esse oblitus es? An non tibi quod
lubeat, licet? Tu legibus major: In te legirupae nomen cadere haud potest, qui
ipsis etiam dominaris legibus.

7. Tui nihil possident, quod tuum non sit. Tu potes and servare and perdere.
Tibi fas est opibus dignitateque augere, quem visum sit. Fas est, ubi libuerit,
adimere.

8. Mor. Alios alia vel damnant, vel commendant: Tibi nihil non honestissimum
futurum.

56. De Lupo and Cane.

gratulatur: denique rogat, quo pacto tam sit nitidus.

2. Cui ille, Herilis cura hoc efficit: herus me blandientem sibi demulcet, de
mensa pascor herili nitidissima, nunquam sub dio dormio; tum universae familiae
dici non potest quam sim gratus.

3. Nae tu, inquit lupus, multo es felicissimus. O canis! cui tam benignus and
comis contigit herus, quocum O utinam commorari and mihi liceat: nullum me
animalium esset uspiam fortunatius.

4. Canis, novi status cupidissimum videns lupum, effecturum se pollicetur, ut
haereat in part aliqua apud herum, modo de pristina ferocia, aliquid
remittere, and servitudinem servire, velit.

5. Stat sententia: Lupo libitum est deambulare ad villam: sermones edunt in
itinere prorsus jucundissimos.

6. Postea vero cum illuxit, contritum canis eollum videns lupus, Quid sibi
vult, inquit, O Canis, tua is it haec prorsus depilata cervix?

7. Solebam, inquit ille, feroculus, notis pariter and ignotis allatrare,
obmordereque nonnunquam: Id aegre ferens herus, crebris me tundebat verberibus,
prohibens etiam ne quem praeter furem lupumque adorerer.

8. Ego sic vapulando victus sum, and mitior factus, hocque genialis saevitia
servavi signum.

9. Lupus, hoc audito, Ego, inquit, heri tui amicitiam tanti non emo.

10. Vale igitur, O canis, cum tua isthac servitute: mihi mea potior est
libertas.

11. Mor. Optabilius est humili casa dominum esse, and panem atrum vorare, quam
in amplissima regia opiparis mensis frui, and obnoxium trepidumque degere.

12. Nam, libertas subiimi exulat aula, ubi accipienda venit, and n^^ssitanda
injuria est.

57.De Agricola and Canibus.
1. AGricola cum ruri plusculos hyemasset dies, coepit tandem necessariarum
rerum penuria laborare: interficit oves, mox and capellas, postremo heves
quoque mactat, ut habeat quo inedia pene exhaustum corpusculum sustentet.

2. Id videntes canes, salutem fuga quaerere constituunt; sese enim non
victuors diutius, quando ne bobus quidem, quorum in opere rustico faciendo ut
ebatur opera, pepercit herus.

3. Mor. In quam domum mercedis gratia te tradas, vide.

4. Nonnulli inhumanissimi sunt heri.

5. Multi enim hodie eo dementiae prolabuntur, ut vel servos infortunio malo,
and damno libenter mactent.

aspicere vix ausi fuimus.

59. De Vulpe and Aquila.

4. Vulpes, correpta face, quasi illius munitiones incendio absumptura esset,
insequitur.

tuere.

6. Trepidans aquila incendium dum metuit, Parce, inquit, mihi parvisque
liberis; tuum quicquid, habeo, reddider^.

7. Mor. Per Aquilam, potentis atque audacis animi homines intellige; per
vulpem, pauperculos, quos calumniis premere, contumeliisque afficere divitibus
aeque studium est.

8. Verum, quando est sua and formicis ira, impotentes ii acceptam interdum
probe ulciscuntur injuriam.

60. De Agricola and Ciconia.
1. GRuibus anseribusque sata depascentilus, laqueum pratendit rusticus:
capiuntur grues, capiuntur anseres, capitur and ciconia.

2. Supplicat illa, innocentem sese clamitans: and nec gruem nec anserem esse,
sed avium omnium optimam, quippe quae parenti sedulo semper inservire,
eundemque senio confectum alere consueverit.

3. Horum, inquit, nil me fugit; verum, cum nocentibus postquam te cepimus, cum
eis quoque morieris.

4. Mor. Qui flagitium committit, and is qui impuris se adjungit socium, pari
poena plectuntur.

61. De Gallo and Cato.
1. VEnit ad Gallum commedendum Catus; non satis autem habens ad nocendum
causae, gallum criminari occipit, obstreperam esse avem dictitans, utpote quae
voce tam acuta noctu dormientes homines expergefaciat.

2. Ille se innocentem ait, cum sic excitet ad opera mortales.

3. Catus interea intonat; Nil agis, sceleste; cum matre rem habes, nec a
sorore abstines.

4. Id gallus quoque cum expurgare niteretur; Nec hoc, inquit, perseverantius
saeviens Catus, quicquam faciet; tu mihi hodie discerperis.

5. Mor. Vetus dictum esse ait Guil. Gaudanus, Vt canem caedas facile inveniri
baculum.

6. Malus, si libitum fuerit, quo jure quaque injuria, te praecipitem dabit.

62. De Opilione and Agricolis.
1. PUer editiore pratulo oves pascebat, atque per jocum terque quaterque lupum
adesse clamitans, agricolas undique exciebat.

2. Illi saepius illusi, serio auxilium imploranti dum non subveniunt, fiunt
oves praedae lupo.

3. Mor. Si mentiri consueverit quispiam, huic si quando verum narrare
occaeperit, haud facile habebitur fides.

4. Superiori Apologo finitimus est ille, apud Horat. lib. 1. Epist. 17. de
Plano scurra jocus. 5. Nec, semel irrisus, triviis attollere curat
Fracto cure Planum, licet illi plurima manet
Lachryma; per sanctum juratus dicat Osirim,
Credit, non ludo; crudeles tollite claudum,
Quare peregrinum, vicinia rauca reclamat.


63. De Aquila and Corvo.
1. RVpe editissima in agni tergum devolar Aquila.

2. Videns id Corvus, imitari, velut simia, gestit Aqullam, in arietis vellus
se demittit, demissus impeditur, impeditus comprehenditur, comprehensus
projicitur pueris.

Mor. Non aliorum, sed sua se quisque virtute aestimet.

4. Tuo te pede metire, inquit Horatius.

5. Id velis, id tents, quod possis.

64. De Cane invido and Bove.
1. PRaesepi faeni pleno decumbebat canis.

assequi nequeant.

4. Mor. Impotenti and sincero perpetuo est cum malis parata certatio.

5. Illiditur solo innocentissimus quisque; nocentis vero, ac praeferocis
hominis auribus obstrepit nemo.

66. De Pavone and Luscinia.
1. PAvo apud summi Jovis sororem and conjugem Junonem, queritur, lusciniam
suave cantillare; se ob raucam ravim ab omnibus irrideri.

2. Cui Juno, Dos sua a diis cuique: luscinia cantu, tu plumis long superas:
unumquemque sua sort decet esse contentum.

3. Mor. Quae dii largiuntur, grato sumamus animo, neque majora quaeramus.

4. Superi temere agunt nihil.

67. De Mustela senicula and Muribus.
^. MUstela, prae senio viribus carens, mures jam, ita ut soler, insequi non
valebat; meditari coepit dolum; in farinulae colliculum se illatebrat; sic
sperans forte, ut citra laborem venetur.

2. Accurrunt mures, and farinam esitare dum cupiunt, ad unum omnes a mustela
vorantur.

3. Mor. Ubi viribus quisp iam destitutus fuerit, ingenio opus est.

4. Lysander Lacedaemonius subinde dicere solebat, Quo non perveniret leonina
pellis, vulpinam assuendum esse.

5. Quod si lucidus dixeris, Vbi virtus non satis potest, adhibenda est astutia.

68. De Rustico and Malo.
1. RUsticus quidam ex malo, quam in proximo habebat agello sapidissima
quotannis legebat poma: hero lecta donabat urbano; illectus incredibili pomorum
dulcedine, malum tandem ad se transtulit.

2. Ea veterrima repent exaruit, atque ibi poma pariter and malus periere.

3. Quod cum patrifamilias nuntiaretur; Heu! difficile est, inquit, annosam
transplantare arborem, satis superque fuerat (si fraenos meoe novissem imponere
cupiditati) fructus ramo decerpere.

4. Hanc fabellam sic Mantuanus cecinit. Rusticus ex malo dulcissima poma
legebat,
Vnde dare urbano dona solebat hero.
Ast herus, illectus frugum dulcedine, malum
Transtulit in laribus proxima rura suis.
At quia malus erat senior, translata repent
Aruit, and proles cum genitrice perit.

115. De Tauro and Mure.
1. MUS tauri pedem momorderat fugiens in antrum suum.

2. Taurus vibrat cornua, quaerit hostem, nusquam videt.

3. Irridet eum mus; quia, inquit, robustus es, ac vallus, non idcirco quemvis
contempseris.

4. Nunc te, and quidem gratis, laesit exiguus mus.

5. Mor. Tritum est illud verbum, quod significantius nostrate lingua dixerim,
Let no man be too heedless of his enemy. Latin sic: Nemo hostem suum flocci
^pendat.

116. De Rustico and Hercule.
1. RUstici currus haeret in profundo luto.

2. Mox supinus deum Herculem implorat.

3. Intonut vox e coelo: Inepte, inquit, flagella equos, and ipse annitere
rotis, atque tum Herculem vocato.

4. Tum enim aderit Hercules vocatus.

5. Mor. Nil prosunt otiosa vota, quae sane Deus non audit. Juva temet,
inquiunt; ipse tum juvabit te Deus.

117. De Ansere.
1. FUit anser qui ponebat ova aurea, singulis diebus singula.

2. Dominus, ut subito fiat dives, anserem jugulat; sperans intus latere gazam.

3. Sed ansere invento vacuo, stupet miser, anxieque dehinc suspirat, ac
plangit, and rem and spem periisse.

4. Mor. Moderanda sunt vota. Curandum est, ne vel praeproperi simus vel
nimili. Nam and festinantia nocet: and qui plura, quam decet, quaerit, interdum
acquirit nihil.

118. De Cicada and Formica.
1. CUM per aestatem cicada cantat, formica suam exercet messem; trahit in
antrum grana, reponens in hyemem.

2. Saeviente bruma, famelica cicada venit ad formicam, mendicat victum.

3. Renuit formica, dictitans sese, dum illa cantabat, laborasse.

4. Mor. Qui segnis est in juventa, egebit in senecta; and qui non parcit, olim
mendicabit.

119. De Simia and duobus ejus Natis.
1. SImia, ut ferunt, cum peperit gemellos, alterum diligit, alterum negligit.

2. Erat puerpera cum gemellis, atque cum incidisset terror, vitatura
periculum, dilectum prehendit ulnis, quem (dum praeceps fugitat) collidit
petrae, atque enecat.

3. Neglectus autem, qui in hirsuto haeserat tergo fugientis, mansit incolumis.

4. Mor. Solet evenire, ut ipsi parents, filio quem tenere amant, prae nimia
indulgentia sint mali occasio and periculi; eo, quem minus amant, praestante se
strenuum ac probum.

120. De Bove and Juvenco.
1. BOS jam grandis aevo quotidie trahebat aratrum.

2. Juvencus laboris expers, vicinis exultat in pascuis, ac tandem insultat
fortunae senioris.

3. Jactat se jugi ac vinculi inscium, se liberum, se otiosum: illi attritum
esse labor collum.

4. Denique se glabrum, ac nitidum: illum esse hirsutum ac squalidum.

5. Senior tum quidem nihil contra; sed brevi post tempore videt hunc
insultorem duci ad aras, ac tum hisce verbis affatur.

6. Quo tua mollis vita pervenit?

7. Securum istud otium rediit ad securim.

8. Jam saltem (ut opinor) potius suades mihi laborem, qui me tuetur, quam
otium, quod nunc te traxit ad necem.

9. Mor. Ad vitam recte gerendam opus est labor and vigilantia.

10. Socors autem and voluptati deditus, suarum rerum, quem nollet, sortitur
exitum.

121. De Cane and Leone.
1. OCcurrit canis leoni, jocatur; Quid tu miser exhaustus inedia^ percurris
sylvas and devia?

2. Me specta pinguem ac nitidum; atque haec non labor consequor, sed otio.

3. Tum leo, habes quidem tuas epulas; sed habes, stolide, etiam vincula.

4. Tu servus esto, qui servire potes; ego quidem sum liber, nec servire volo.

5. Mor. Pulchre respondit leo; quibustibet enim rebus potior est libertas.

122. De Piscibus.
1. PIscis fluviatilis vi fluminis correptus est in mare, ubi suam efferens
nobilitatem, omne marinum genus, vili pendehat.

2. Non tulit hoc phoca, sed ait, tunc fore indicium Nobilitatis, si cum phoca
captus portetur ad forum.

3. Se emptum iri a Nobil bus, illum autem a plebe.

4. Mor. Multi sic capti sunt libidine gloriae, ut sese ipsi praedi^ent and
jactent.

5. Sed laus sui oris non datur homini laudi, at excipitur cum auditorum risu.

123. De Pardo and Vulpecula.
1. PArdus, cui pictum est tergum; caeteris seris, etiam leonibus despecti,
intum^scebat.

2. Accedit ad hunc vulpecula, suadet non superbire, dicens, Illi quidem
speciosam esse pellam, sibi vero speciosam esse mentem.

3. Mor. Discrimen est bonorum, and ordo.

4. Bona corporis praestant bonis fortunae: utrisque illis animi bona
praeferantur oportet.

124. De Vulpecula and Pardale.
1. CUM aliquando pardalis vulpem prae se contemneret, quod ipsa pellem haberet
omnigenis colorum maculis variegatam. Respondit vulpes, sibi id decoris in
animo esse, quod illi esset in cute.

2. Mor. Neque vero paul's sa^ius est ingenio praeditum esse v^sro, quam cute
versicolere.

125. De Vulpe and Feel.
1. CUM aliquando vulpes in colloquio, quod illi erat cum feel, jactaret sibi
varias esse technas, adeo ut vel peram haberet dolis refertam: Felis autem
respondit, sibi unicam duntaxat artem esse cui fideret, si quid esset
discriminis.

2. Inter confabulandum, repent canum accurentium tumultus auditur.

3. Ibi felis in arborem altissimam subsiliit, cum vulpes interim a canum
agmine cincta capitur.

4. Mor. Innuit fabula, praestabilius esse nonnunquam unicum consilium, modo id
sit verum, and efficax, quam plures dolos, consiliaque frivola.

126. De Rege and Simiis.
1. REX quidam Aegyptius aliquot simias instituit, ut saltandi rationem
perdiscerent.

2. Ut enim nullum animal ad figuram hominis propius accedit; ita nec aliud
actus humanos aut melius, aut libentius, imitatur.

3. Artem itaque saltandi protinus edoctae saltare coeperunt insignibus indutae
purpureis, ac personatae: multoque jam tempore mirum in modum placebat
spectaculum; donec e spectatoribus facetus quispiam, nuces, quas clanculum in
sinu gestabat, in medium abjecit.

4. Ibi statim simiae, simulatque nuces vidissent, oblitae choreae, id esse coe
perunt, quod antea fuerunt: ac repent e saltatricibus in simias redierunt,
contritisque personis, dilaceratisque vestibus, pro nucibus inter se pugnabant
non sine maximo spectatorum risu.

5. Mor. Admonet haec fabula, fortunae ornamenta non mutare hominis ingenium.

127. De Asino and Viatoribus.
1. DUO quidam cum in desertis locis asinum quempiam forte fortuna nacti
esseut, contendere inter se coeperunt, uter eorum, uti suum, domum abduceret.

2. Nam utrique pariter a fortuna videbatur objectus.

3. Hac interim de re illis invicem altercantibus, asinus sese subduxit, ac
neuter eo potitus est.

4. Mor. Quidam a praesentibus commodis, quibus ob inscitiam uti nesciunt,
excidunt.

128. De Piscatoribus.
1. PIscatores aliquot, jacto r^ti, testudines eduxerunt.

2. Eas cum essent inter se partiti, neque sufficerent omnibus comedendis:
Mercurium forte accedentem, invitarunt ad convivium.

3. At is, intelligens se neutiquam humanitatis gratia vocari, sed ut eos
fastidio cibi sublevaret recusavit; jussitque ut ipsi suas testudines ederent,
quas cepissent.

4. Mor. Nonnulli, posteaquam inconsulte quippiam adorti sunt, aliorum
implorant auxdium, quos suo negotio admisceant.

129. De Asino.
1. APud Cumanos asinus quispiam pertaesus servitutem, abrupto loro in sylvam
aufugerat; illic forte repertus leonis exuvias corpori applicabat suo, atque
ita pro leone se gerebat, homines pariter ac feras voce caudaque territans.

2. Nam Cumani leonem ignorant.

3. Ad hunc igitur modum regnabat aliquamdiu personatus hic asinus, pro leone
immani habitus ac formidatus, donec hospes quispiam Cumas profectus (qui
saepenumero viderat and leonem, and asinum, atque ob id non erat ei difficile
dignoscere) aurium prominentium indicio, atque aliis quibusdam conjecturis,
asinum esse deprehendit, ac probe fustigatum reduxit, dominoque agnoscenti
reddidit.

4. Interim autem risum non mediocrem concitabat omnibus Cumanis asinus jam
agnitus, quos dudum, creditus leo, metu propemodum exanimaverat.

5. Mor. Hand facile tegimus vitia, quae a pueris nobiscum adoleverunt.

130. De Scarabaeo and Aquila.
1. SCarabaeus aliquando spretus ab aquila, coepit de vindicta quoquo pacto
sumenda cogitare.

2. Pervestigavit ubinam aquila nidum collocasset, adrepsit scarabaeus, and ova
simili dolo dejcit.

3. Aquila cum saepius domicilium commutasset, neque quicquam proficeret, Jovem
patronum adiit, exponit calamitatem suam.

4. Is jubet, ut suo in gremio ponat ova, vel istic in tuto futura.

5. Et huc per vestis laecinias, sinusque prorepsit pertinax scarabaeus, haud
quaquam sentiente Jove.

6. Deinde ubi videt ova commoveri Jupiter, ^eque satis animadverteret,
territus rei novitate, excusso gremio in terram dejeccit.

7. Mor. Monet haec fabella, neminem, quantumvis pusillum, contemnendum esse.

131. De Satyro and Rustico.
1. SAtyrus quidam cum vehementer algeret, hyberno g^lu supra modum saeviente,
a rustico quodam inductus est in hospitium.

2. Admiratus autem cur homo inflaret in manus ori admotas, rogavit cur ita
faceret.

3. Is respondit, Ut frigidas manus halitus tepore calefaceret.

4. Deinde ubi, extracto foco, apposita mensa, in pultem fervidam rursum
inflaret, magis etiam admiratus, sciscitatus est quid hoc sibi vult.

5. Uti pultem, inquit ille, nimium ferventem halitu refrigerem.

6. Tum Satyrus surgens a mensa, Quid ego audio, inquit?

7. Tune eodem ex ore pariter and calidum and frigidum efflas?

8. Valebis.

9. Neque enim mihi ratio est cum ejusmodi homine commune habere hospitium.

10. Mor. Notantur bilingues, qui eundem modo laudant, modo vituperant.

132. De Cass^ra and ejus Pullis.
1. AESopus ille Phrygiae Fabulator, haud immerito sapieus existimatus est, cum
quae utilia monitu suasuque erant, non severe non imperiose praecepit, and
censuit, ut Philosophis mos est; sed festivos delectabilesque Apologos
commentos res salubriter ac prospicienter animadversas, in mentes animosque
hominum cum audiendi quadam illecebra induxit.

2. Velut haec ejus fabella de aviculae nidulo, lepide atque jucunde praemonet
spem fiduciamque rerum, quas efficere quis possit haud unquam in alio, sed
semet ipso habendam.

3. Avicula inquit est parva, nomen est cassita, habitat, nidulaturque in
segetibus id ferme temporis, quo appetit messis, pullis jamjam plumantibus.

4. Ea cassita in sementes forte concesserat tempestiviores; propterea
frumentis flavescentibus pulli etiam tunc involucres erant.

5. Cum igitur ipsa iret cibum pullis quaesitum, monet eos, ut si quid ibi
novae rei sieret, dicereturve, animadverterent, idque uti sibi, ubi rediisset,
renunciarent.

6. Dominus postea sagetum illarum, filium adolescentem vocat, and, Videsne,
inquit, haec ematuruisse, and manus jam postulare.

7. Idcirco die crastino, ubi primum diluculabit, fac amicos adeas, and roges,
ut veniant, operamque mutuam dent, and messem hanc nobis adjuvent.

8. Haec ubi dixit, discessit; atque ubi rediit cassita, pulli trepiduti
circumstrepere, orareque matrem, ut statim jam properet, atque alium in locum
sese asportet.

9. Nam dominus, inquiunt, misit filium, qui amicos rogaret, ut luce orient
veniant, and metant.

10. Matter jubet eos, a metu otiosos esse.

11. Si enim dominus, inquit, messem ad amicos rejecit, crastino seges non
metetur, neque necesse est hodie uti vos auferam.

12. Die igitur postero, matter in pabulum volat; dominus quos rogaverat,
operitur: Sol fervet, and sit nihil, and amici nuili erant.

13. Tum ille rursum ad filium, Amici isti, inquit, magnam in partem cessatores
sunt: quin potius imus, and cognatos, affines, vicinosque nostros oramus, ut
adsint cras tempore ad metendum.

14. Itidem hoc pulli pavefacti matri nunciant.

15. Matter hortatur, ut tum quoque sine metu, ac sine cura sint: cognatos
affinesque nullos ferme tam esse obsequibiles, ait, ut ad laborem capessendum
nihil cunctentur, and statim dicto obediant: Vos modo, inquit, advertite, si
modo quid denuo dicitur.

16. Alia luce oria, avis in pastum profecta est; cognati and affines opera,
quam dare rogati sunt, supersedent.

17. Ad postremum igitur dominus silio, Valiant, inquit, amici cum propinquis;
afferes prima luce falces duas: unam egomet mihi, and tu tibi capies alteram,
and frumentum nosmetipsi manibus nostris cras metemus.

18. Id ubi ex pullis dixisse dominum, matter audivit; Tempus, inquit, est
cedendi and abeundi.

19. Fiet nunc dubio procul quod futurum dixit.

20. In ipso enim jam vertitur, cuja est res, non in alio unde petitur.

21. Atque ita cassita nido mi^ravit and seges a domino demessa est.

22. Mor. Haec quidem est Aesopi fabula, de amicorum plerumque and propinquorum
levi and inani fiducia.

23. Sed quid aliud sanctiores libri Philosophorum monent, quam ^t nobis tantum
ipsis nitamur; alia autem omnia, quae extra nos, extraque nostrum animum sunt,
neque pro nostris, neque nobis ducamus.

24. Hunc Aesopi Apologum Ennius in Satyris site admodum and venusto versibus
quadratis composuit: quorum duo postremi isti sunt, quos habere cord and
memoria, opere praetium esse hercle puto.

25. Hoc tibi erit a gamenium semper in promptu situm,

Ne quid expecta amicos, quod tu agere possis.

133. De Avibus and Noctua.
1. AVes olim prope universae noctuam adierunt, rogaruntque eam ne post hac in
aedium cavis nidificaret, sed in arborum potius ramis, atque inter frondes; ibi
en^m vernari suavius.

2. Quin, eidem quercum modo enatam, pusillam, tenellamque adhuc, offendebant;
in qua scilicet, molliter, ut aiebant, and sedere ipsa aliquando noctua, and
saum sibi construere nidum posset.

3. At illa facturam se negavit.

4. Qum invicem consilium dedit iis, ne arbusculae illi se crederent.

5. Laturam enim quandoque esse viscum, pestem videlicet avium.

6. Contempsere illae (ut sunt leve genus and volaticum) sapientis unius
Noctuae consilium.

7. Jam quercus adoleverat, jam patula, jam frondosa erat.

8. Ecce, ibi aves illae omnes gregatim ramis involitant, lasciviunt,
subsultant, colludunt, cantillant.

9. Interea, quercus ea viscum protulerat, atque id homines animadverterant;
implicitae ergo repent ibi omnes pariter misellae; ac frustra eas sera
poenitentia subiit, quod salubre illud consilium sprevissent.

10. Atque hoc esse aiunt, cur nunc aves omnes, ubi noctuam viderint,
frequentes eam quasi salutant, deducunt, sectantur, circumdant, circumvolitant.

11. Etenim consilii illius memores, admirantur eam nunc ut sapientem
stipantque densa caterva, ut videlicet ab ea sapere aliquando discant.

12. Sed opinor frustra, imo vero, etiam interdum cum magno ipsarum malo.

13. Nam veteres illae noctuae revera sapientes erant: nunc multae noctuae
sunt, quae noctuarum quidem plumas habent, and oculos, and rostrum, sapientiam
vero non habent.

14. Mor. Been monentis consilia ne spernas, haec fabula docet.

134. De Cucurbita and Pino.
1. SAta est olim cucurbita juxta arborem pinum, quae grandis admodum and ramis
patulis exstabat.

2. Cucurbita vero, cum multis pluviis atque coeli temperamento crevisset,
lascivire incepit, and ramulos audacius porrigere.

3. Jam serpebat in pinum, jam surgere, jam ramos and frondes involvere
audebat; ampliora folia, candentes flores, praegrandia poma and vire scentia
ostentans.

4. Itaque tanto fastu atque insolentia intumuit ut pinum arborem ausa sit
aggredi: and vides, inquit, ut te supero, ut amplis foliis, ut virore praesto,
and jamjam ad cacumen praesurgo.

5. Tum pinus, quae senili prudentia and robore pollebat, nihil mirata est
cucurbitae insolentis audaciam, sed ita ad eam respondit.

6. Ego hic multas hyemes, calores, aestus, variasque calamitates pervici, and
adhuc integra consillo.

7. Tu ad primos rigores minus audaciae habebis, cum and folia concident, and
viror omnis aberit.

8. Mor. Secundis rebus non est superbiendum.

135. De Corvo and Lupo.
1. COrvus lupos per ardua montium juga comitatus, partem sibi praedae fieri
postulat, quia eos secutus nullo tempore destituisset, sociusque fuisset.

2. Repulsus deinde est a lupis tanquam non eos, sed praedam cibumque secutus;
nec minus luporum, si occiderentur, quam caeterorum animalium exta fuisset
voraturus.

3. Mor Non quid agamus semper inspiciendum est, sed quo simus animo cum agamus.

136. De partu Terrae.
1. TUrgida olim facta tellus, and mirum in modum tumida magnum aliquod
paritura videbatur.

2. Accurrunt finitimi, stupent agricolae, terrae partum inter spem metumque
expectant.

3. Alii Typhoea illum centimanum, al^i montes erupturos putabant.

4. Aperitur terra, prodiit Mus; and quod miraculo fore omnibus existimabatur
in risum atque jocum converterunt.

5. Mor. Non semper credendum promissis magnificis.

137. De Membris and Ventre.
1. HUmani artus, cum ventrem otiosum viderent, ab eo discordarunt, and suum
illi ministerium negaverunt.

2. Cum eo pacto and ipsi quoque deficerent, intellexerunt ventrem cibos
acceptos per omnia membra dividere; and cum eo in gratiam redierunt.

3. Mor. Magnae res discordia pereunt; concordia valent.

138. De Arione and Delphine.
1 VEtus and nobilis Arion cantator fidibus fuit.

2. Is loco and oppido Methymnaeus, terra atque insula Lesbius fuit.

3. Eum Arionem rex Corinthi Periander, amicum amatumque habuit, artis gra^ia

4. Is inde a rege proficiscitur, terras inclytas Siciliam atque Italium
visurus.

5. Ubi eo venit, auresque omnium mentesque in utriusque terrae urbibus
^emulsit, in quaestibus istic and voluptatibus amoribusque hominum fuit.

6. Is tum postea grandi pecunia and re bona multa copiosus, Corinthum
instituit redire.

7. Navem igitur, and nautas ut notiores amicioresque sibi Corinthios delegit,
sed eo Corinthii homino accepto, navique in altum provecta, praedae pecuniaeque
cupidi* ceperunt consilium de necando Arione.

8. Tum illum, ibi pernicie intellecta, pecuniam caeteraque sua ut haberent
dedisse; vita modo sibi parcerent oravisse.

9. Nautas precum ejus harum comisertos esse illatenus, ut ei necem infer per
vim suis manibus temperarent; sed imperavisse, ut jam statim coram desiliret
praeceps in mare.

10. Homo ibi territus and spe omni vitae perdita, id unum postea oravit, ut
priusquam mortem oppeteret, iuduere permitterent sua sibi indumenta, and sides
capere, and canere carmen casus illius sui consolabile.

11. Feros and immanes nautas prolubium tum audiendi subit.

12. Quod oraverat, impetra^.

13. Atque ibi mo^ de more cinctus, amictus, ornatus, stansque in summae puppis
foro, carmen quod Orihyum dicitur voce subaltissima cantavit.

14. Ad postrema cantus, cum sidibus ornatuque omni, sicut stabat canebatque,
jecit ses^^ocul in profundum.

15. Nautae, haudquaquam dubitantes quin periisset, cursum quem facere
coeperant tenuerunt.

16. Sed novum, and mirum, and pium facinus contigit: Delphinum repent inter
undas adnavisse, and dorso super fluctus edito vectavisse, incolumique cum
corpore and ornatu, Taenarum in terram Laconicam devexisse.

17. Tum Arionem prorsus ex eo loco Corinthum petivisse, talemque Periandro
regi, qualis Delphino vectus fuerat, sefe obtulisse, eique rem (sicuti
acciderat) narravisse.

18. Regem isthaec parum credidisse, Arionem (quasi falleret) custodiri
jussisse, nautas requisitos, obligato Arione, dissimulanter interrogasse,
Ecquid audissent, in iis locis unde venissent, super Arionem.

19. Eos dixisse, Hominem, cum inde irent, in terra Italia fuisse, eumque illic
been agitare, and studiis delectationibusque urbium florere, atque in gratia
pecuniaque magna fortunatum esse.

20. Tum inter haec eorum verba, Arionem cum fidibus and indumentis, cum quibus
se in salum ejaculaverat, extitisse.

21. Nautas stupefactos convictosque, ire inficias non quisse.

22. Mor. Documento est haec fabula, plus aliquando inveniri in brutis
animalibus clementiae, quam in his hominibus, qui praeter opes nihil habent
per^^^: praeter siguram, nihil humanitatis.

139. De Aranea and Podagra.
1. ARanea, paululum a texendi opere quietior, animi relaxandi gratia, commodum
deambulabat.

2. Huic se obvium praebet Podagra, tametsi passibus ambiguis admodum aegre
illum assequeretu^.

3. Ejus diei itinere utcunque emenso, non long aberant ab oppidulo, cui
regionis incolae Tyche nomen indiderunt.

4. Vtrique Consilium fuit, conditionis suae hospitem pervestigare.

5. Aranea, non maximopere data opera, in opulenti cujusdam civis aedes
divertit: inibi quaquaversum telas suas praependebat, praetendebatque retia.

6. Aderant illico nescio qui trygodaemones, qui textrinam illius demoliebantur.

7. Momentaneum itaque erat ipsius, quo etiam cunque se verteret, aedisicium.

8. Nusquam enim scopariorum oculatas scopas poterat effugere.

9. Misera plane, quae it^ tanta rerum omnium affluentia sola angebatur
perturbaturque.

10. Podagra vero, mendicabuli instar, vix tandem egestosi cujuspiam tuguriolum
impetrarat: id loci cum decubuisset, nihil non experiebatur miseriarum.

11. Apponebatur coenaturienti panis cibarius, aridis vix saucibus hianti
hydropoterium.

12. Jamque diurno intinere labascenti torus ligneus, nullis frondibus, nullo
gramine, sed praetenuibus pale is insternebatur.

13. Atque dicere non est hujus instituti, quam convenerint male membris
mollibus, cuticulae (ut ita dixerim) holosericae, stragula tam dura, tam
barbari villi.

14. Orient igitur vix tandem illo augusto Sydere, quod exaudit, quod intuetur
omnia, convenere rursum aranea simul and podagra.

15. Prior aranea praeteritae no^tis molestias, tot locorum commutationes
denarrat: nunc hero exprobrans munditiem, nunc nimiam scopariorum observantiam.

16. Podagra contra de hospitis sui egestate complura comminiscitur; nec otium
habet admonstrare araneae lividas vibices, quos adamantina fulcra tenellae
cuticulae impresserunt.

17 Consilium ineunt araneam deinceps pauperum toguria, podagram vero divitum
aulas debere subingredi; in hanc aranea pedibus, podagra animis vadit
sententiam.

18. Veruntamen tenebris jamjam increscentibus urbi cuipiam sese approximant.

19. Podagra, instituti non immemor, pedeterntim se in nummosi cujusdam domum
illatebravit.

20. Qua commodum ab hero conspecta, dii boni, qua benevolentia, qua
humanitate, quibus nominibus excipitur!

21. Supponuntur, substernunturque olorinae culcitrae, toralia perdictam
subalaribus plumis referta.

22. Taceo vinum dulce, vinum nigrum, Lesbium, Tarentinum.

23. Taceo fideculas, phasianos atque eas aviculas quae binis superbiunt
coloribus.

24. In summa nihil deliciarum, nihil voluptatum non exhauriebat.

25. Aranea, pauperis casam ingressa, telas orditur, quaquaversum parietes
interpatent, retia suspendit.

26. Orbiculari operi manibus pedibusque incuml it, reficit abrupta, perficit
incepta: and ut dicam breviter, vacua dominatur in aula.

27. Nullas insidias, nullos formidat insultus: imo vero etiam jam scopis
superior omnibus.

28. Non multo post, podagra araneam convenit, delicias suas, felicitatem,
fortunas ampliter exornat.

29. Aranea miris laudibus extotit imperium suum, aedisicandi, texendique
libertatem.

30. Placuit tandem haec utrique sententia: quo^sumcunque proficiscerentur,
podagram in divitum domos, araneam in pauper^m tuguria debere divertere.

31. Mor. Apologus hic tametsi ad usus varios accommodari queat, id tamen
imprimis declarat, alium alio loco fortunatio^em esse.

32. Praetera morborum domicilia esse divitum aulas.

33. Ad ultimum nusquam libertatem majorem, quam ubi divitiarum minus.

140. De Mure in cista nato.
1. MUS in cista natus, omnem ibi sere duxerat aetatem nucibus pastus quae in
ea servar solebant.

2. Dum autem circa oras cistae ludens decidisset, quaereretque ascensum

3. Etenim rectus stabis, ac pedibus anterioribus, cornibusque muro adhaerebis;
tuas ego scapulos, corn^aque conscendens, cum egressa puteum fuero, te per
manus comprehendens, hinc desuper traham.

4. Huic caper prompte deservi^^.

facienda illos excitaret.

3. Rursum catus ait, Impius es, ac supra modum scelestus, qui agis continuo
contra naturam, cum nec a matre, nec a sororibus te abstineas; sed per
incontinentiam cum illis te commisceas.

4. Gallus item defendebat; quod dominae suae quaestus gratia id quoque ageret;

5. Tunc inquit catus, Excusationibus licet abundes, ego tamen jejunare haud
intendo.

Mor. Fabula significat, quod qui pravus existit natura, cum semel delinquere
