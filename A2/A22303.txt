A Proclamation for the search and apprehension of Henry Field.
FOrasmuch as one Henry Field, having by Our special command been apprehended
for great contempts and offenses by him done, against Our self and Our Laws,
has two several times reseued himself, and escaped away from those that had
him in their custody, and now (as it seems) lurketh very closely in some
secret places, and will not submit himself to Justice, to the great abuse, and
insufferable contempt of Us and our Regal authority; We have thought it fit
to publish his escape and contempt to all our loving Subjects, not doubting of
their care and forwardness in his Discovery and Apprebension: And We do
hereby charge and command all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Constables,
Headboroughs, and all other Our Officers, Ministers and Subjects whatsoever, to
be diligent in enquiring and searching for the said Henry Field in all places
whatsoever, as well within Liberties as without; whom if they shall happen to
find, Our pleasure is, they take and send him, with sufficient Guard, to the
Jail of the County or place where he shall be taken, there to remain in
safe custody, and presently to advertise one of Our principal Secretaries of
his apprehension. And We do promise to bestow upon such person as shall
apprehend the said Field, or cause him to be apprehended, the sum of ten
Pounds, for such his care and pains therein. And as We are pleased to reward
the endeavors of such as shall be zealous in performance of this Our pleasure; so
We do hereby let all men know, that if any person, after this Our Proclamation
published, shall directly or indirectly conceal, harbor, keep, relieve, or
maintain the said Henry Field, or shall not use their best endeavor for his
apprehension, as well by giving due advertisement thereof, to Our Officers, as
by all other good means, We will (as there is just cause) proceed against
them so neglecting this Our commandment with all severity. And to the end the
said Henry Field may the better be discovered, We have thought fit to describe
him herein: He is a man of a middle stature, about forty years of age, some
pockholes about his nose, his face lean, his complexion sallow, very hollow
eyed, the hair of his head brownish, his beard some what lighter, thin of
hair, and cut short and blunt; when he was last seen, he ware a cloth suite
of dark green color, with two laces in aseame, of a lighter color.

Given at Our Court at Greenwich the thirtieth day of May, in the one and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
