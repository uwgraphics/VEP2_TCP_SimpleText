TO THE WORSHIPFVLL EDMVNDE HASSELVVOOD of Ringestone in the County of
Lincoln, Esquier: W. P. wishes most prosperous felicity in this world, and
in the world to come life everlasting.
IF GOD HIM self so bitterly inueieth against the extreme ingratitude of his
people by his holy Prophet Esaias, saying: I have nouris^ed, and brought up
children, and they have rebelled against me: yea, if he prefers brute
beasts in the return of their duty before them, saying: The ox knows his
owner, and the ass his masters crib: but Israel knows not me.

If the Persians likewise, so worthily abhorred this vice of Ingratitude, so as
they extremely punished such as they found more willing to receive, than ready
to requite, adiudging them execrable unto God, injurious to nature, and
unprofitable members of a common wealth.

If the Civil Law also, with good reason binds men by nature ad antidora,
to requite a good turn received in duty.

I trust no reasonable man will blame me, if I seek by all means possible, to
shun so foul a blemish as unthankfulness is, so hateful to God, so
loathsome to man, and so repugnant to nature.

Wherefore, finding my self deeply indebted (by your only means) to all the
name of Hasselwood, and namely to master Edward Hasselwood, your good brother,
and to that virtuous gentlewoman his wife, (a rare example of godliness and
modesty) but especialy to your worship, both for them and all other your
kindness, courtesy, and great frindships showed toward me a stranger. And
having no other way in the world, to requite any part of the same, then by
leaving a public testimony to all posterity, of my loyal love, and hearty
good will toward you likewise, to stand for the meede of so great a merit:
I have presumed to dedicate to your worship, this little book of S Augustines,
translated by me into English, and with great labor quoted, and confirmed by
scripture in the margeant, as you see, very profitable to the Christian Reader,
that can find in his heart, to sequester his mind from the vice of
vainglory, (that proceeds from the ignorance of our own estate) the very
snare of Satan, the puddle of pride, and the fountain from whence distilleth
all kind of poisoned infection, as by the view of this glass may easily
appear.

Wherefore the premises duly considered I doubt not, but that you will of your
accustomed curtesye, pardon my presumption, and of your wonted Zeal to
godliness, accept of my travail herein, and think me rather unable, then
unwilling any way to discharge my duty whereof I am careful, as knows the
Lord, who ever preserve your worship and that virtuous Gentlewoma^ your wife
long to continue amongst us with increase of godliness, and worship in his
fear.

Your worships, most faithful friend in the Lord. W, P.

A PREFACE to the Christian Reader, and loving looker in this Glass of vain
glory.
AS those beasts that did not ruminate, nor chewe the cud, were judged filthy
and unclean, by the law Leuiticall: Leuit. 11, 7 Deuteronomy. 14, 4 5.6.7.8.
So (no doubt) all they, that never enter into due consideration, of their
estate and duty, must needs be wicked, and unholy, in the sight of the
Lord, Ierem. 12, 11. 1. Cor. 10, 11 9.10
who most carefully recommendeth this exercise of meditation unto us, saying:
These words must remain in thy heart, thou Deuteronomy. 6.7 8.
shall meditate upon them, both at home, and abroad: when thou go to bed
at night, and when thou risest in the morning. Deuteronomy. 6 7 22.
And again: Teach your children these things, that they may meditate upon
them. So is Joshua commanded to do by the Lord himself Joshua. 1.8
. And so is Timothy likewise, by his master Paul willed to meditate. 1 Timothy
4, 15.
Haec meditare, think of these things. This meditation has always been the
ordinary exercise of the righteous and godly Sirach 14.21. psalm, 1.2. prou, 6,

yet shall they perish for ever, like their doong: and they that have seen
them shall say: where are they that shall fly away as a dream, and they shall
not find them: but they pass away, as a vision in the night, so that the eye
that has seen them, shall see them no more, neither shall their place enjoy
them again. Their bread in their bellies, shall be turned to the gall of
serpents: they shall be constrained to spue out again their riches, that they
have devoured: yea, God shall pull them out of their throtes: they shall be
constrained to suck the galls of Cocatrices, and the tongue of the Adder shall

reverent Father, Innocentius quartus de vtilitate humanae vitae.
Innocentius quart. was so careful to avoid the vengeance to come, that to
stir up all the powers of his mind, with due consideration of the vanity of
this world, the vileness of his nature, the shortness of his time, the causes of
sin, and the punishment for the same) he still imagined to hear a damned
soul answering his demand as follows.

Dic mihi vas cinerum, quid prodest flos facierum? etc. Thus englished.

Thou dust and clay,
tell me (I say.)
Where is thy beauty fled?
was it in vain?
or does it gain
thee favor with the dead?
Thy house so hie,
thy pleasures by,
Thy cattle more and less,
thy land so wide,

a stranger does possess.
Where is thy strength?
become at length?
Thy wit thy noble blood?
thy worldly care?
thy dainty fate
Do these thee any good?
The answer I will not feign,
all is but vain,
There is no food to find
no wit no wealth,
no hiew no health.
No hope in grave assign.
What will thou more,
my goods in store,
My land so large and wide,
my glory gay,
my brave array,
Increased have my pride.
My pride my pain
procured again,
My pain my grief alas,
my grief, my grief,
without relief,
My senses does surpass.
My wailing woe,
no man does know,
No tongue can half display,
I freeze, I fry,
exceedingly,
Alas, and well away.
I weep, I wail,
I faint, I fail,
I stewe, I stamp, I stare.
I dye, I dye,
everlastingly,
Farewell, by me beware.

Chap. 3. A view of man's misery, and short continuance.
O that they were wise, understood this, and would prudently provide for their
latter end.
BEhold, beloved in the Lord, three things delivered unto us hereby: to wit,
knowledge Dan. 1.17
, understanding Psalm. 119 34 Hos. 14.10
, and providence Eccle 9.12, 1 Per. 4 7

provide for our departure: but first to know what? this our life to be blithe
Job. 14 5 Ps. 103.15
dangerous Iam. 1.14
and short Psalm. 90.9.10
, stuffed with miseries Job. 7.1.
, subject to vanity Psa. 114 4
, defiled with sin To. 5, 12.
, corrupt with desire Romans 7.7

end: for there is no defense against the grave Sira 41 4
. That the more slippery, uncertain, and miserable this life appears: it
might the rather be contemned for the love and longing, that we ought to have
unto that life that never shall have ending Phil. 1.23 Col. 3, 1.2, Luc. 18 13
.

Likewise, God wishes us well to understand, what? our own estate: that, as
naked we came out of our mothers womb, so naked we must return again Job
1.21 Eccle 5 14 Wisd. 7.6.
: for as earth we are, to earth eft soones we are to be converted Genesis 3.19.
.

With nakedness and weeping, we began our interlude Wis. 7.3 Eccles. 1 4
: with pain and vexation, are our parts continued Sira, 40.1. etc.
, and now with grief, and sorrow, must we take our fare well Genesis 37.35
.

So is our beginning lamentable Genesis 3.16.
, our continuance wretched Ecc. 9.3.
, and our departure grievous: for the only remembrance of death, is both
grievous: and bitter to a man that lives at rest, in his possessions, and has
prosperity in all his affairs: yet is it the ordinance and decree of the Lord
over all flesh Sira. 41.1 etc.
.

Wherefore understand thy self, during thy small abode in this vale of misery
Psalm. 23.4
, to be here a soiourner, and no citizen 1 Chronicles. 29.15. Heb 13 13

hurtful they be: as the Prophet Hierem witnesses, saying: Know how evil and
how hurtful it is for thee to forsake the Lord thy God. Ierem. 2.19.
Evil in offense, and hurtful in punishment. O that man would understand.
What? his estate how vain it is, as records the Preacher, saying: Vanity
of vanities and all is but vanity Eccle. 1 1

but the mind is never better endowed than when it is furnished with the
tresure of providence Prou. 3 22.23. Prou. 6, 6 7 8

We read that Argus Ovid. li. 1 metamor.
had his head environed with 100. watching eyes: signifiyng thus much unto us,
he was every way endued with great wisdom and singular discretion Therefore,
if a paganne and a heathen man (by the poets report) so excelled in the
atchieuement of wisdom and prudence: How much the rather ought a Christian man
to be well furnished with providence and circumspection Luc. 12.35.36, 37.38.

Be thou therefore an other Argus, nay more wary then he, more wily then he,
more watchful and more circumspect tha^ he, that thou may learn to be wise
to understand and finally, to provide for thy end and last departure.

The Translator to the Reader.
WHere Nouissima, or the last things (mentioned, as well in Deuteronomy. as by the
Son of Syrach) are in number four, to wit, Death, Judgment, the Pains of
Hell, and the Joys of heaven: and having now out of S. Augustine,
sufficiently entreated of Death, Judgment, and Hell, I thought it necessary to
deliver likewise (out of the same Author) unto the repentant Reader, some taste
of the joys Celestial, to inflame his mind with an earnest desire, and a
longing after his heavenly inheritance, and continuing Country, the City of
the great King, that supernal Jerusalem, and mother of us all, whereby the
fleshly desire of carnal men (which is corrupt from their youth upward) and
the love of the world (which is a loathing of God) might happily be quenched in
comparison of that infinite joy and glory that shall be revealed unto us, the
rather for that every thing naturally coueteth his complement and chiefest
happiness, which the Philosophers call Summum bonum, and is nowhere to be
either had or hoped for, but in that heavenly habitation, the fullness of our
joy purchased by Christ, promised by Scripture: and contained in this song of
Sion which I have here translated (out of S. Augustines book of Prayers, Chap.
24. into English meeter, quoted and confirmed by the testimony of the word
(though in deed it be of it self nothing else but an abridgement of sundry
places of scripture, curiously collected, and cunningly couched) together for
that purpose, as the learned Reader may easily perceive: wherefore, I have as
near as I could possibly, followed the very words of mine Author, contrary
to the mind of the Poet that says: Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus
interpres. though I could not attain to his perfection and gravity,
notwithstanding my hope is, that my will may supply my vant therein, with the
godly Reader, that likes the sense of the mind better than the sound of the
ear. And therefore simply sings this Psalm of Sion in this his woeful
captivity and banishment as follows.
