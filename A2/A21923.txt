By the Queen. The Queens Majesty's Proclamation, 1. For observation of
former Orders against Jngrossers, and Regraters of Corn, 2. And to see the
Markets furnished with Corn. 3. And also against the carrying of Corn out of
the Realm. 4. And a prohibition to men of hospitality from remoouing from
their habitation in the time of dearth. 5. And finally a strait commandment to
all Officers having charge of Forts to reside thereon personally, and no
inhabitant to depart from the Sea coast.
THE Queens Majesty having had of late time consideration of great dearth
grown in sundry parts of her Realm, judging that the rich Owners of corn
would keep their store from common Markets, thereby to increase the prices
thereof, and so the multitude of her poor people having no grain growing of
their own, to sustain great lack, caused special orders to be made and
published to all parts of her Realm, in what sort the Justices of peace in
every quarter should stay all Ingrossers, Forestallers, and Regraters of Corn,
and to direct all Owners and Farmers having Corn to furnish the Markets
ratably and weekly with such quantities as usually they had done before time,
or reasonably might and ought to do: By which orders, many other things were
prescribed to be observed for the staying of the dearth, and relief of the
people: Yet nevertheless, her Majesty is informed, that in some parts of her
Realm the dearth does not diminish, but rather increase for lack of due
execution of the said orders, and specially by the covetousness of the Owners,
forbearing to furnish the Markets, as reasonably they might do, and by secretly
selling out of their houses to a kind of people that commonly are called
Badgers, at prices unreasonable, who likewise do sell and regrate the same out
of the Markets at very high and excessive prices. For remedy whereof, her
Majesty charge all officers to whom the observation of the said orders has
been directed, presently as they have any natural care of their Christian
brethren and Countrymen, being in need, to cause all and every part of the
said orders from point to point to be executed, and the offenders against the
fame to be severely punished, to the terror of others. And besides this
manifest cause given of unnecessary increase of prices, there is spread amongst
her people by the said Ingrossers and Regraters a false report, that there
should be much quantity of Corn carried by Sea out of the Realm, and thereby
occasion given of want of Corn to serve for the necessary use of the people of
the Realm: By which false report, not only her Majesty's poor people are
discomforted with the fear of lack for their sustenance, but also the
covetous owners of Corn do pretend to preserve their store, and thereby do
refrain to serve the Markets: which slanderous report, her Majesty does
affirm, for any thing to her knowledge, or for any license, or sufferance for
carrying any Corn out of the Realm, to be untrue. And yet nevertheless, for
that contrary to her Majesty's will, there may be some fraud used in some parts
of the Realm, either by her own officers or by others, where Corn is
provided in some one part of her Realm, to be carried by Sea to some other
place that is known to have need thereof, notwithstanding by the very special
orders of all the Ports, there ought none to be carried from Port to Port, but
upon special bonds in great sums of money to be taken of the owners of the
Ships and of the Corn, where such transportation shall be made, for the true
carriage of the same to the Ports therein named, and not by any color or
pretense to carry the same out of the Realm: And therefore for further
provision to be made for avoiding of such fraud, besides such bonds to be
taken, her Majesty commands and gives license to any person that shall have
cause to suspect that any such Corn is or should be shipped, or provided to be
shipped, by lawful authority to be carried to any other Port, that the same
may be by fraud carried out of the Realm, such person having such cause to
suspect, shall give information thereof to any Justice of peace or public
officer dwelling nere to ye Port, which Justice or officer shall with the said
Informer repair to the Custom house of any such Port or Creek where Corn is
shipped, or provided to be shipped, and there shall duly examine both the
officers of the Custom house, and the sellers, buyers, and shippers of the
Corn, upon their several oaths, whether they know of any intention directly
or indirectly to have the said corn to be carried out of the Realm. And
further also when by their oaths they shall clear themselves of any such
intention (thereby the suspicion conceived being cleared) yet the officers of
the Ports, that have authority to take bonds, shall show the parties, who upon
suspicion shall require the same, and give them in writing the contents of the
bond with the names of the parties bound, being sufficient to answer the same,
the true quantity of the grain, and the Ports, to which it is intended to
have the same carried; and, if notwithstanding such provision of good assurance
taken, there shall afterward any doubt follow, that notwithstanding the said
bonds, the said Corn shall be carried out of the Realm: the party that shall
have cause so to suspect the same, shall repair to some Justice of Peace, whom
her Majesty does hereby command to examine the truth at the Port, whereunto
the said Corn was appointed. And for that purpose the officers of that Port
shall make plain declaration, whether any such Corn, and what quantity
thereof came to that Port within the time limited. And if by good proof it
shall any ways appear, that there has been any fraud in any officer of the
Port, or falsehood in the transporter by carrying it out of the Realm, the
officer of the Port shall be deprived of his office, and suffer imprisonment, and
make fine to her Majesty at her pleasure. And the transporter for carrying it
out of the Realm, and the seller and buyer, or either of them being privy
thereto, shall be committed to prison for the space of one year, and the Ship
forfeited. And the Informer for his labor and reward shall have both the half
of the value of the Corn transported, and the half of the fines imposed upon
the offenders. And for the trial of these offenses, and execution of the
punishments and fines, the same shall be tried in her Majesty's Exchequer, as all
informations are upon penal Statutes, where all expedition shall be used, or
before the Justices of Assise in their circuites, or before any Justices of
Peace in the Sessions, where the offense shall be committed, having any
authority to hear and determine any penal Law.

Finally her Majesty is particularly informed of some intentions of sundry
persons of ability to keep hospitality in their Countries, to leave their
said hospitalities, and to come to the City of London, and other Cities and
towns corporate, thereby leaving the relief of their poor neighbors, as
well for food, as for good rule, and with covetous minds to live in London,
and about the City privately, and so also in other Towns corporate, without
charge of company; for withstanding whereof her Majesty charge all manner of
persons, that shall have any such intention during the time of this dearth, not
to break up their households, nor to come to the said City, or other towns
corporate: and all others that have of late time broken up their households, to
return to their houses again without delay. And whilst her Majesty had thus
determined for relief of her people to stay all good householders in their
Countries, there in charitable sort to keep hospitality, her Majesty has
had an instant occasion given her to extend her commandment even for the
necessary defense of her Realm: willing and straightly commanding all manner of
persons that be deputies to any Lieutenants in any Counties of the Realm, to
repair to their Countries; And that all persons having charge of any Castles
or Forts upon the Sea coasts, do presently repair to their charge, and there
to reside personally during all this Winter season, and to have care how the
same Fortes are furnished, and to make petition for their defects. And likewise
her Majesty charge all persons dwelling in any Port town to continue their
habitation there, and to furnish their households with able persons for defense
of the said Ports. These her Majesty's present commandments her highness
minds and wills to be enquired of by the Lieutenants of every Shire, and
specially by them of the Maritime Counties, whom her Majesty charge to
enquire diligently hereof, and by their commandments to see the defaults
reformed, or otherwise to advertise her Majesty or her privy Counsel of the
offenders. The observation of all which, her Majesty's commandment is to be
performed upon pain of her Majesty's heavy indignation.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Richmond the second day of November 1596. in
the eight and thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign.
God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
