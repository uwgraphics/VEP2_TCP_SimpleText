All such Proclamacions, as have been set furthe by the Kings Majesty (and
passed the Print) from the last day of Ianuarij, in the first year of his
highness reign, unto the last day of Ianuarij, being in the.iiij. year of his
said most prosperous reign, that is to say, by the space of.iiij. whole
years.

Anno. 1550.

To the reader.
Forasmuch as many Proclamacions, set furthe by the kings majesty, are
penal, and diverse good and loving subjects, do often offend them, which
happens either by ignorance, or else for that when the print is passed, they
cannot come by them, I thought it therefore very mete and needful, to gather
the^ together, and to imprint them wholly in one volume: which thing I have
herein done, that is to say, all the Proclamacions, that the kings majesty
has published in print, from the first year of his highness most prosperous
reign, unto the latter end of the fourth year of his graces said reign:
intendyng hereafter, every second year (or oftener if it shall be requisite) to
add hereunto, such other Proclamacions as shall happen to be published, by
like aucthoritee.

FOr so much as the kings highness, the lord protector, and the residue of the

The.xxvij. day of December A Proclamacion, concerning their reverent talks
of the Sacrament.
WHere as the Kings highness has of late, with the assent and consent, of
the lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the commons in the Parliament held the
day of in the first year of his most gracious reign, made a good and Godly
Act and Estatute, against those, who does contempne, despise, or with unseemly
and ungodly words, deprave and revile the holy Sacrament of the body and
blood of our lord (commonly called the Sacrament of thaltar.) And the same
estatute has most prudently declared, by all the words and terms, which,
scripture speaks of it, what is undoubtedly to be accepted, believed, taken
and spoken, by, and of thesaied Sacrament: Yet this not withstandyng, his
majesty is advertised, that some of his Subjects, not contented, with such
words and terms, as scripture does declare thereof, nor with that doctrine
which the holy ghost, by the Evangelists and Saint Paul, has taught us: do
not cease to move, contencious and superfluous questions, of thesaied holy
Sacrament and supper of the lord, enteryng rashly into the discussyng, of the
high mystery thereof, and go about in their sermons or talks, arrogantly to
define the manner, nature, fashion, ways, possibility or impossibility, of
those matters which neither make to edification, nor God has not by his holy
word opened. Which persons not contented reverently and with obedient
faith, taccept that thesaid Sacrament, according to the saying of. S Paul,
the bread is the communion or partakyng of the body of the lord, the Wine
likewise, the partakyng of the blood of Christ, by the words instituted and
taught of Christ, and that the body and blood of Jesus Christ is there which, is
our comfort, thanks geuyng, love token of Christ's love toward us, and of
ours as his members within our self, searches and strives irreverently,
whether the body and blood, aforesaied, is there really, or figuratly, locally,
or circu^scriptly, and having quantity and greatenes, or but substancially,
and by substan^ce only, or else but in a figure and manner of speaking: whether
his blessed body be there, hedde, legs, arms toes and nails, or any other
ways, shape and manner, naked or clothed, whether he is broken and chewed, or
he is always whole, whether the bread there remains, as we see, or how it
departs, whether the flesh be there alone and the blood, or part, or each in
other or in the one both, in the other but only blood and what blood, yt only
which did flow out of the side, or that which remained with other such
irreuere^t superfluous and curious questions, (which, how and what, and by
what means, and in what form) may bring into them, which of humain and
corrupt curiosity, has desire to search out, such mysteries as lies hid in
the infinite and botomles deapth of the wisdom and glory of god, and to the
which, our humain imbecillitie cannot attain, and therefore, often times
turns the same to their own and others destruction, by co^tencion and
arrogant rashness, which simple and Christian affeccion reverently receiuyng
and obediently believing, without further search, takes and uses to most
great comfort and profit. For reformacion whereof, and to the intent that
further contencion, tumulte and question, might not rise emonges the Kings
Subjects: The Kings highness, by the advice of the Lord Protector, and other
his majesty's counsel, straightly wills and commands, that no manner
person from hencefurthe, do in any wise contenciously and openly argue,
dispute, reason, preach or teach, affirmyng any more terms, of thesaid
blessed Sacrament, then be expressly taught in the holy Scripture, and
mentioned in the forsaied act, nor deny none, which be therein contained and
mentioned, until such time as the kings majesty, by the advice of his
highness counsel, and the Clergy of this realm, shall define, declare and
set furthe, an open doctrine thereof, and what terms and words, may justly
be spoken thereby, other then be expressly in the scripture, contained in the
Act before rehearsed. In the mean while, the kings highness pleasure is, by
the advice aforesaied, that every his loving subjects, shall devoutly and
reverently, affirm and take that holy bread, to be Christ's body, and that
Cup, to be the cup of his holy blood, according to the purport and effect
of tholy scripture, contained in thact before expressed, and accomodate
theimself, rather to take the same Sacrament worthily then rashely to enter into
the discussyng of the high mystery thereof. Yet the kings highness minds not
hereby, to let or stop the ignorant, and willing to learn quietly,
reverently and privately, to demand of those, whom he thinks knows more,
the further instruccion and teaching, in thesaid blessed Sacrament, so that the
same be not done with contencion, nor in open audience, with a company gathered
together about them, nor with tumulte: Nor does prohibit any manne hereby,
likewise so quietly, devoutly and reverently, to teach or instruct the weak
and unlearned, according to the more Talent and learning, given to him of God.
But only that all contencio^, strief and tumult and irreuerentnes might be
avoided, and in open audience or preaching, nothing taught, but which may
have the holy scripture for warraunt, upon pein that whosoever shall openly,
with contencion or tumult, and in a company gathered together, either in
Churches, Alehouses, Markettes, or else where, contrary to the form and
effect of this Proclamacion, defend and maintein, or irreuerently and
contenciously demand of any manne, any of the questions before rehearsed,
either on the one part, or of the other, or any such like, or do otherwise
revile, contempne, or despise thesaid Sacrament, by calling it Idol, or other
such vile name, shall incur the Kings high indignacion, and suffer
imprisonment, or to be otherwise grievously punished at his Majesty's will and
pleasure.

Geuyng further in aucthoritee, to all Justices of Peace within the Shires,
where they dwell, to apprehende and take all such as co^tenciously and
tumultuously, with companies or routes, assembled about them, do dispute, argue
or reason, or stifely maintein, or openly preach and define, the questions
before rehearsed, or any of them, or such like, either on the one part or
the other, and to commit the same to prison, until such time, as the Kings
majesty's pleasure herein be known, and that they immediately do certify the
name or names, of the party so offendyng, and of them who were there, at
the same time present, making the route or assemble, to the kings highness
counsel: Willing and commaundyng thesaid Justices, with all diligence to
execute the premises, according to the purport, effect and true meaning of the
same, and their most bound duties, as they tender his highness will and
pleasure, and will answer to the contrary upon their peril.

The.xvi. day of Ianuarij. A Proclamacion for the absteinyng from flesh in
the Lent time.
THE Kings highness, by the advice of his most entierly beloved uncle, Edward
duke of Somerset, Governor of his person, and protector of all his realms,
dominions and Subjects, and other of his privy Counsel, considering that
his highness, has not only cure and charge, of the defense of his Realms and
dominions, as a king, but also as a christian king, and supreme head of the
Church of England and Irelande, a desire, will, and charge to lead and
instruct his people, to him committed of God, in such rightes, ways and
customs, as might be acceptable to God, and to the further increase of good
living and virtue: and that his Subjects, now having a more perfect and clear
light of the Gospel and true word of the lord, through the infinite
clemency and mercy of almighty God, by the hands of his majesty, and his
most noble father, of famous memory, promulgate, showed declared, and opened
unto the^, should and ought thereby, in all good works and virtues increase,
be more forward diligent and plentiful: As in fasting, prayer and almose
deeds, in love, charitee, obedience, and other such good works, commanded
to us of God, in his holy scripture: Yet his highness is advertised and
informed, that diverse of his Subjects, be not only to all these more slow
and negligent, but rather conte^pners and dispisers of such good and godly
acts and deeds, to the which, if they were of their own minds bendid and
inclined, they neded not by outward and princely power, be appoyncted and
commanded. But for so much as at this time now alate, more then at any other
time, a great part of his subjects, do break and contempne that abstinence,
which of long time has been used, in this his Majesty's realm, upon the
Fridaies and Saterdaies, and the time commonly called Lent, and other
accustomed times, his highness is constreined, to see a convenient order herein,
set and appoincted: Not myndyng thereby, that his Subjects should think any
difference, to be in the days or meats, or that the one should be to God
more holy, more pure, or more clean, then the other, for all days and all
meats, be of one and equal purity, cleannes and holiness, that we should in
them, and by them, live to the glory of God, and at all times, and for all
meats, give thanks unto him, of the which, none can defile us at any time,
or make us unclean being christian men, to whom, al things be holy and pure,
so that they be not used, in disobedience and vice: but his majesty has
allowed, and approved the days and times, before accustomed, to be continued
and still observed here in this church of England, both that men should on
those days abstein and forbear their pleasures, and the meats, wherein they
have more delight, to the intent to subdue their bodies, unto the soul and
spirit, unto the which, to exhort and move men, is the office of a good and
Godly hedde and ruler, and also for worldly and civil policy, certain days
in the year, to spare Flesh and use Fish, for the benefit of the common
wealth, and profit of this his Majesty's realm, whereof many be Fishers, and
men vsyng that trade of living, unto the which, this realm on every part,
environed with the Seas, and so plentiful of fresh waters, does easily
minister occasion, to the great sustenau^ce of this his highness people, so that
here by, both the nourishment of the land might be increased, by saving
flesh, and specially at the spryng time, when Lent does commonly fall, and
when the most common and plenteous bredyng of Flesh is: And also, diverse of
his loving subjects, have good livings, and get great riches thereby, in
vtteryng and sellyng such meats, as the sea and fresh water does minister
unto us, and this his majesty's realm has more plenty of Ships, Boats
Crayers, and other vessels, by reason of those, which by hope of lucre, do
follow that trade of living. Wherefore his Majesty having consideracion, that
where men of their own minds, do not give theimselfes, so often as they should
do to fasting, a common abstinence may and should be, by the prince enjoined
and commanded, and having an iye and mind, to the profit and co^moditee, of
his realm and subjects, and to a common and Civil policy, has willed and
commanded, and by these presents does will and command, by thaduise
aforesaid, all manner of person and persons, of what estate, degree, or
condition he or they be, other then such as already be, or hereafter shall be
excused by law, or licensed, or aucthorised sufficiently to the contrary, to
observe and keep from hencefurthe, such fasting days, and the time commonly
called Lent, in absteinyng from all manner of Flesh, as heretofore in this
Realm, has been most commonly used and accustomed, upon pein that whosoever
shall, upon any day, heretofore wont to be fasted from flesh, and not by the
kings highness, or his predecessors, abrogate and taken away, eat Flesh
contrary to this Proclamacion, shall incur the kings high indignacion, and
shall suffer imprisonment, and be otherwise grievously punished, at his
Majesty's will and pleasure. And further the kings highness, by the advice
aforesaied, straightly charge and commands al Majors, Bailiefes, and other
hedde officers, and rulers of citees and tounes, and all Justices of Peace, in
the Shires where they be in Commission, to be attendant and diligent, to
therecucion of this proclamacion, in co^mittyng to prison the offenders,
contrary to this Proclamacion, upon sufficient proffe thereof, by two
sufficient witnesses, before them had and made, there to remain, during the
kings pleasure according to the true purport, effect, and meaning of the same,
as they tender the kings majesty's will and pleasure, and will answer to the
contrary at their peril.

And where the late king, of most famous memory, father to his highness has
given diverse years, license to his subjects, in the time of Lent, to eat
butter, Chese, Eggs, and other meats, commonly called White meats, the
kings highness, by thaduise aforesaid, co^sideryng the same to have been done,
not without great consideracio^s does give likewise license and aucthoritee, to
all his loving subjects from hencefurthe, freely for ever in the time of Lent,
or other prohibited times, by law or custom, to eat butter, eggs Chese, and
other White meats: Any Law, statute, act, or custom, to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Anno secundo.
The.vi. day of Februarij. A Proclamacion against such as innouate any
Ceremony or Preach without license.
THe kings highness, by the advice of his most entierly beloved uncle, the
duke of Somerset* Governor of his most Royal person, and Protector of all
his realms, dominions and subjects, and others of his counsel: considering
nothing so much to tend to the disquietyng of his realm, as diuersitee of
opinions, and varietee of Rites and ceremonies, concerning Religion and
worshippyng of almighty God, and therefore studiyng all the ways and means,
which can be to direct this Church and the Cure, committed to his highness,
in one and most true doctrine, Rite and usage: Yet is advertised, that certain
private Curates, Preachers, and other lay men, contrary to their bounden
duties of obedience, does rashely attempt, of their own and singular wit
and mind, in some parish churches and othewise, not only to persuade the
people, from the old and accustomed rites and ceremonies, but also themself,
brings in new and strange orders, every one in their church, according to
their fantasies: The which, as it is an evident token of pride and arrogance,
so it tends both to confusion and disorder, and also to the high displeasure
of almighty God, who loves nothing so much as order and obedience:
wherefore, his Majesty straightly charge and commands, that no manner
person, of what estate, order* or degree so ever he be, of his private mind,
will or fantasy, do omit, leave down, change, alter, or innouate any
order, rite or ceremony, commonly used and freque^ted, in the church of
England and not commanded to be left down at any time, in the reign of our
late sovereign lord, his highness father, other then such as his highness, by
the advice aforesaid, by his majesty's visitors, Iniunccions, Statutes, or
Proclamacions, has already, or hereafter shall command, to be omitted,
left, innouated, or changed: But that they be observed after that sort, as
before they were accustomed, or else now sith prescribed, by the aucthoritee of
his majesty, and by the means aforesaid, upon pein that whosoever shall
offend contrary to this proclamacion, shall incur his highness indignacio^, and
suffer imprisonment, and other grievous punishme^tes, at his majesty's will and
pleasure

And to the intent, that rash and sedicious Preachers should not abuse his
highness people, it is his Majesty's pleasure, that whosoever shall take upon
him, to preach openly, in any parish Church, Chapel, or any other open
place, other then those, which be licenced by the kings majesty, or his
highness Visitors, the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the bishop of the Diocese,
where he does preach (except it be the Bishop, Person, Vicar, Deane or
Provost, in his or their own cure) shall be furthwith, upon such attempt and
preaching, contrary to this Proclamacion, committed to Prisone, and there
remain until such time, as his majesty, by thaduise aforsaid, has taken
order, for the further punishment of the same. And that the premises, should be
more spedely and diligently done and performed, his highness gives straightly
in commandment, to al Justices of Peace, Majors, Sherifes, Constables, hedde
Borrowes, church Wardens, and all other his Majesty's Officers and Ministers,
and Rulers of Tounes, Parishes, and Hamlettes: that they be diligent and
attendaunt, to the true and faithful execucion, of this Proclamacion, and
every part thereof, according to the intent, purporte and effect of the same.
And that they of their procedynges herein (or if any offender be, after they
have committed the same to prison) do certify his highness, the lord
protector, or his Majesty's Counsel, with all speed thereof accordyngly, as
they tender his Majesty's pleasure, the wealth of the Realm, and will answer
to the contrary, at their vttermoste perilles.

The.x. day of April. A Proclamacion for the calling in of Testons.
WHere as it is come to the knowledge of our sovereign Lord the kings
Majesty, what fraud and corrupcion, has of late time been used, in the
falsyng of his highness coin, now current, specially of the pieces of.xii. d.
commonly named Testons, by reason that the same sort of coin, for the greatness
and facilitee of counterfaictyng, has the rather given occasion, to diverse
eiuill persons, to stamp or cast pieces of the same form and bigness, in great
multitude, the practizers whereof (as is known) are not only men here
dwelling, but also for the most part have been strangers, dwelling, in
forain parts, who have found the means to conueigh privily, and disperce
thesaied counterfeict pieces abroad, in his majesty's dominions, to the great
deceit and detriment of his highness most loving Subjects, which have
received the same: His majesty therefore myndyng the due reformacion hereof,
and to prevent the like practice hereafter, by the advice and assent of his
derest uncle, the lord Protector, and others of his counsel, does will and
command, that from the last day of December next coming, after the date
hereof, thesaied coin or pieces of xii. d. commonly named testons, shall no more
be current, within any his highness realms or dominions, but be taken only
for Bullion. And further straightly charge and commands al and singular
his highness subjects, and others whatsoever, being within any his majesty's
said realms or dominions, that from thesaid last day of December, they or
any of them, shall not utter or receive in payment, any of thesaid Testons, as
his highness coin current. And also, his highness by the advice aforesaid,
wills and commands, that no manner of person or persons, after thesaied
last day of December, shall buy or amasse, into his or their hands, any of
thesaid Testo^s for a peculier gain to be had thereof, to him or them wards,
upon pein of forfeicture.

Nevertheless, his highness most gracious clemency, tenderyng his subjects and
others interestes, which by lawful means do possess thesaied Testons, as
their proper goods, and for aduoydyng of the loss, which otherwise they
should sustein hereby: is pleased, and does ordein by the advice aforesaied,
that every person or persons, so having and possessyng thesaid testons, being
of his highness just standarde, shall and may bring or send the same, to the
officers of any of his Majesty's Mintes, where in exchange shall be delivered
unto him or them the just value and recompense thereof, as they be now curra^t,
either in grotes, or other his highness coins, accordyngly

The.xxiiij. day of April. A Proclamacion for Butter, Chese etc.
Forasmuch, as at this present time, by reason that so many does daily Carry

such Butter, Chese, Bakon or Tallowe, as is so laden and shipped for that
intent: any license or grant by his highness, or by the late king, of famous
memory, his majesty's father, made heretofore, notwithstanding.

And his highness, straightly charge and commands, all his Majors,
Bailiefes, Sheriefes, Portriefes, Customers, Comtrollers and Serchers and other
his Majesty's officers, that they be diligent and attendant, in executyng of
thesaied Proclamacion, as they tender his highness will and pleasure, and will
answer for the contrary.

The.xxiiij. day of April. A Proclamacion* inhibityng Preachers.
WHere as the Kings Majesty, our Sovereign lord, by the singular gift and
grace of almighty God, with the advice of his most entierly beloved uncle,
the lord Protector, and other of his highness counsel, has made certain
reformacions and orders, according to the laws and commandment of God, in
this his Majesty's church of England, to the intent, that one and a most
Godly conformitee, might be had throughout all his realm: and is advertised
that diverse unlearned and indiscreet preachers and other priests, of a
deuelishe mind and intent, has not only incited and moved his loving
Subjects, as well in Confession, as otherwise, to disobedience and
stubbernesse, against his majesty's Godly procedynges, but also that other
light and perverse persons, has sowed abroad false and traiterous rumors,
against his highness, their sovereign lord, tellyng that they here say, that
his Majesty will take and set upon them, new and strange exaccions, as of
every one that is married, half a croune, likewise of every Christenyng, and of
a Burial, with other such liyng and untrue surmises: whereby some leude and
light persons, and that of no small number, geuyng credit to such false
tales, and other having confidence in those Sedicious Preachers, has been
Seduced, and brought to much disorder of late, and in some parties, in manner
to insurreccion and rebellion, to his majesty's no little grief, and disquietnes
of his highness other loving subjects. For reformacion whereof, and to
the intent, that by such light and sedicious preachers and other such like
false and vain tale tellers, his majesty's subjects, should not hereafter be
brought and induced, to like misorder and inconvenience: his majesty, by
thaduise aforsaid, wills and commands, that no man tell forth spread
abroad, or utter, lies nor other such vain leude and untrue tales, of the
kings majesty, or his highness procedynges and affairs, upon pein of his
majesty's displeasure, and grievous imprisonment of such offenders body.

And also, for to exchue the hurt that may come, of sedicious and contencious
preaching, his highness, straightly charge and commands, notwithstanding
any former commandment or Iniunccion, that no man hereafter, be permitted or
suffered to Preach, (not meaning yet hereby, but that his highness Homelies,
should be according to his majesty's Iniunccion, red and declared) except
the same be licensed thereunto, by his majesty, the lord protector, or the
Archbishop of Cantorbury, under his seal:) and the same to be showed to the
person and curat, and two honest men of the parish beside, before his said
Preaching, upon pein of imprisonment, both of the preacher, so preaching
without license, and of the curate or person, which suffers any such
without license, as before is expressed, to Preach in any of his or their
Churches, or Chapelles, or Churchyardes. And for further execucion of the
premises: his Majesty by the advice aforesaied, wills and commands, all
manner Justices of Peace, to take diligent head thereunto, and to commit upon
due examinacion, as well thesaied preacher so preaching, without license as
aforesaid, as the Curate or Person, sufferyng any such preacher, in his cure
to preach, to prison, and thereupon certify immediately, the lord Protector,
or the kings majesty's honorable counsel, and that they shall assist and
aid, all such as be licenced by his majesty, the lord Protector, or the
Archbishop of Cantorbury, as aforesaid, as they tender his highness will and
pleasure, and will answer to the contrary at their peril.

And where as other unlearned and eiuill disposed persons, have not sticked to
instill and whisper, into men's cares, and to persuade abroad, eiuill and
perilous opinions, against Gods law, and the good order of the realm: some
teaching, that a man may forsake his wife, and mary another, his first wife
yet living, and likewise, that the wife may do to the husband. Other, that a
man may have two wifes, or mo at once, and that these things, be prohibited,
not by Gods law, but by the Bishop of Romes law: so that by such eiuill and
fantastical opinions, some have not been afraied in deed, to mary and keep
two wifes. The which opinions, the kings majesty, as a most Christian
Prince, by the advice aforesaied, not allowyng as godly, or convenient to be
spread abroad, or maintained in the realm, straightly charge and commands,
all Archbishoppes and Bishops, and other which have spiritual
iurisdiccions, within the realm, to proceed against al such as has, or
hereafter shall mary, or keep, two wifes at once, (whereof the first is his
lawful wife) or shall put away his wife, and mary another and to punish
such offenders, according to the Ecclesiastical laws, with grave and severe
punishment, to fear there with others, which else would fall to such insolent
and unlawful acts

And that all his highness officers, and loving subjects, who has charge or
zeal thereto, shall detect all such offenders, to thesaied Archebishoppes
and Bishops, and others that exercises spiritual iurisdiccion, and aid
the same, to the punishment of such eiuill doers, according to the order of
the law, in those cases. And if so be, thesaied Archebishoppes, Bishops, or
other, who has the exercise of spiritual iurisdiccions, be slack and
negligent, in thexecucion of thesaid process, and punishyng such eiuill doers
as is before rehearsed, that then the justices of Peace, in every shire, or any
other his majesty's loving subjects, shall declare and signify, such
offenders and misdoers, to the kings highness counsel, by their letters, that
his highness, by thaduise aforesaied, might se a convenient redress made, of
such misorder, and look more straightly upon the Archebishoppes and Bishops,
which does not execute their duties in this behalf, according to the trust
committed unto them.

The.xxiij. day of September. A Proclamacion, for the inhibicion of al
Preachers.
Whereas of late, by reason of certain controuersious and sedicious preachers,
the kings majesty, moved of tender zeal and love, which he has to the
quiet of his subjects, by thaduise of the lord protector, and other his
highness counsel, has by proclamacion, inhibited and commanded, that no
manner of person, except such as was licenced by his highness, the lord
Protector, or by the Archbishop of Cantorbury, should take upon him to preach,
in any open audience, upon pein in thesaied Proclamacion contained, and that
upon hope and esperaunce, that those being chosen and elect men, should preach
and setfurth only to the people, such things as should be to Gods honor,
and the benefit of the kings Majesty's subjects. Yet nevertheless, his
highness is advertised, that certain of thesaied Preachers so licenced, not
regardyng such good admonicions, as has been by thesaied lord protector, and
the rest of the counsel on his majesty's behalf by Letters, or otherwise
given unto them, has abused thesaied authority of preaching, and behaved
themself irreuerently, and without good order in thesaid preachynges, contrary
to such good instruccions and aduertisementes, as was given unto them, whereby
much contencion and disorder might rise and ensue, in this his Majesty's
realm: wherefore his highness, myndyng to see very shortly, one uniform order
throughout this his realm, and to put an end of all controversies in
Religion, so far as God shall give grace (For which cause at this time,
certain bishops and notable learned men, by his highness commandment are
congregate) has by thaduise aforsaied thought good, although certain and many
of thesaied preachers so before licenced, have behaved theimself very discretly
and wisely, and to the honor of God and his highness contentacion, yet at this
present and until such time, that thesaied order shall be set furthe generally,
throughout this his Majesty's realm, to inhibite, and by these presentz does
inhibite, generally, as well thesaied preachers so before licenced, as all manner
of persons whosoever they be, to preach in open audience in the pulpit or
otherwise, by any sought color or fraud, to the disobeiyng of this
commandment, to the intent that the whole clergy in this mean space, might
apply theimself to prayer to almighty God, for the better acheuyng of the same
most Godly intent and purpose, not doubtyng but that also his loving
Subjects, in the mean time will occupy theimself to Gods honor, with due
prayer in the Church, and pacient hearing of the Godly Homelies, heretofore
setfurth by his highness Iniunccions unto the^, and so endeavor themself, that
they may be the more ready with thankful obedience, to receive a most quiet,
godly, and uniform order, to be had throughout all his said realms and
dominions. And therefore, has willed all his loving officers and ministers,
as well justices of peace, as Majors, Sheriefes, Bailifes, Constables, or any
other his officers, of what estate, degree, or condition soever they be, to be
attendaunt upon this proclamacion and commau^deme^t, and to se the infringers
or breakers thereof to be unprisoned, and his highness, or the lord protectors
grace, or his Majesty's counsel, to be certified thereof immediately, as they
tender his Majesty's pleasure, and will answer to the contrary at their
peril.

The last day o^ October. A Proclamacion, for the payment of the late
incumbentes of Colleges
THe Kings most excellent majesty, by the advice of his most dear uncle
Edward Duke of Somerset, Governor of his most royal person, and Protector of
all his realms, dominions and Subjects, myndyng to provide for the late
Incumbe^tes of Colleges, Chauntries, Stipendaries, Fraternities, Guildes, and
such other within this shire of convenient and reasonable recompenses and
pencions, according to the statute in the first year of his highness reign in
that behalf ordained: has commanded and appoyncted, several Letters
patentes to be made, under the great seal of the court of thaugmentacions and
revenues of his majesty's croune, for the pencions of thesaied late
Incu^be^tes, which patentes his majesty, by thaduise aforesaid, does all his
faithful subjects to understand, are presently sent to the hands of his
highness auditor, receiuor and surueior of this county, with straight
commandment unto them, to deliver the same Patentes immediately, and to make
payment unto the parties whom they concern, now, and hereafter yearly frank
and free, without fee, duty, or some of money to be demanded, or taken of
thesaied pencioners, either to his majesty's use or to the use of any Officer,
Minister, Clerk or other person. Wherefore, his majesty wills all those
persons, which have to do herein, to resort to his highness Audite, now
presently to be holden within thesaied County, or else where the same officers
shall be, and there they shall receive their Pencions accordyngly.....

Anno. III.
The last day of Ianuarij. A Proclamacion for the prolongacion of Testons.
WHere as the Kings most excellent majesty, with the advice and assent of
his derest uncle, Edward duke of Somerset, Governor of his royal person,
Protector of his highness realms, dominions, and Subjects, and the rest of his
graces counsel, has heretofore by Proclamacio^, beryng date the.x. day of
April in the second year of his reign, given notice and commandment, to all
manner his loving subjects and others, hauntyng his majesty's realms or
dominions, that from the last day of the Month of December last passed
forwards, the pieces of.xij. d. commonly called Testons, should no longer be
curraunt, nor pass in payment or receipt as his graces coin, but be taken
only for bullion: whereunto his majesty was moved upon such consideracions,
as in thesaied former proclamacion, was more at large expressed. Forasmuch as
it has since come to his highness knowledge, that by reason of the great
number of the same Testo^s, which at this present are dispersed abroad, in so
many men's hands, beside no less cautele and policy, used even hard upon
the day by diverse, making whole paime^tes in thesaid coin and specially for
that, those that have plenty of other money, take unreasonable allowance of
the poorer sort, which is most to be relieved, for the exchange of those
testons, much detriment and inconvenience should ensue, to the possessors of
the same, onles a remedy by prolongyng of the term then appoyncted for their
calling in were provided: his majesty therefore, by the advice aforesaid, is
most graciously pleased, wills and commands, that the term of the
calling of thesaied pieces of.xij. d. commonly called Testons, shall be yet
further prolo^ged and extended, to the first day of May next coming, after
the date hereof. And that during all the mean space, thesaied Testons (being
of his highness standerd) shall be current through out his highness realms and
dominions, after no less value and sort, then if thesaied former proclamacion,
for their calling in had not been made.

Provided always, that after thesaied first day of May, thesaied Testons
shall no longer be current, but be used in such sort, as that former
proclamacio^ does specify, this present prolongacion notwithstanding.

And further, his majesty exhorts all his said loving subjects, that like
as his highness for their benefit, was moved to revoke thesaid Testons, and for
their more commodity is pleased, to prolong the day of their calling in: so
they also in the mean while, will have the better regard and head, that such
Testons as they take, be of his majesty's sta^derd and coin, seeing the number
to be such of false and foreign testons, as are now so dispersed abroad to the
deceit and loss of the takers: and that during this time of respite, they
endeavor themselfes from day to day, by porcions and smaller somes, to bring
in such testons as they shall have, into any his majesty's mintes, as shall
best serve for their purpose, there to receive the just exchange of the same:
so as by lyngeryng or deferryng of the bryngyng in of such Testons, until
thesaied first day of May, limited by this peremptory admonicio^, their
negligence be not cause that when the mintes (if the whole mass come in at
once) are pestered, their exchange shall not be so ready unto them as
otherwise it should.

Moreover, because his Majesty most graciously above other things tenderyng
the relief of the poorer sort of his loving subjects, does consider, that
their need or vnhabilitee, to forbear by a space (be it never so small) the
exchange of their Testons at his graces Mintes, might be an occasion that
others of the richer sort, with whom they should perchance be driven to
bargain for other money, in lieu of their Testons, should then exact or take
of them vnresonably, for the exchange (as it has comen to his highness
knowledge, that some all ready have not been ashamed to demand, and take
against all conscience and equity.) His highness therefore, by the foresaied
advise, does straightly charge and command, that no manner of person or
persons, whatsoever they be, do take by any means, for the gain of the
exchange of any Testo^s, above.ij. d. for every pound in Testons (which is.xx
s.) and after that rate, for smaller somes in Testons, upon pain of loss and
forfaicture of so much money, or the value thereof, as he or they for any
higher rate of gain, in every pound or smaller somes, shall have delivered in
exchange for testons to any person, the one moytie thereof to be applied to
his highness, and the other to the party complainyng.

And finally, his majesty's pleasure is, that between this and the first day
of May aforesaied, no manner person, be so hardy to refuse in paimentes
great or small, any such Testons of his graces standard, but shall accept
them no less then other his highness coin for the time, upon pein aforsaid.

In which behalf, his majesty likewise charge all manner Majors, shiriefes,
Baylifes, Justices of Peace, and others his graces officers and ministers of
Justice, that they, or such of them as by informacion of the party
co^plainyng, shall have due knowledge hereof, fail not to se the whole effect
of this penalty executed, upon the party complained on (if he be guilty) as
otherwise they themselfes shall be Subject to the like danger, upon further
informacion against them given.

Provided also, that such person or persons, as al ready have collected
together, at other men's hands, any Testons for a gain, that is to say,
after a less rate and value, then they were current, shall not by occasion of
any thing or clause herein contained, otherwise utter, despise, or put in ure,
any such Testo^s so by them collected but shall only bring them into the
Mintes without faylyng, as every such offenders, being upon like informacion
found culpable, shall incur the like penalty in each behalf, as is before
expressed.

The.xix. day of Februarij. A Proclamacion concerning Pirates and robbers of
the Sea.
THe multitude of Piracies and Robberies on the Seas, being of late greatly
increased to the Kings Majesty's high displeasure, and no small slander of
this his highness realm, by reason that such persons, who had the chief care
and charge thereof, and should most especially have seen the same redressed and
amended, has rather been concealors or mainteiners of such Piracies, as of
late (by the grace of God) it has been revealed and does appear: his majesty
therefore, by the advice of the Lord Protector, and the rest of his highness
counsel, most earnestly myndyng to proceed with all care and force, against
thesaied Pirates and Sea Robbers: and to cause his Laws more severely to be
executed, lest perauenture any of his loving Subjects, should either
ignorauntly fall into daungier, or willyngly pretend ignorance of his Laws,
does by this his majesty's Proclamacion, straightly charge and command, that
no manner of person or persons, do by any color or pretense from hencefurthe,
receive, aid, succor, releue, defend, conceal, or abbet any manner of Pirat
or Pirates, whatsoever they be, either on the seas, or in any Port, Haven,
Creke, or any other town of the kings majesty's, or in any other place,
within his Majesty's realms and dominions, by sea or land upon pain that
whosoever shall offend, contrary to this Proclamacion, shall be taken for a
Pirate or fautor of the^, and suffer such pains of death, loss of goods,
and forfaictures, as the Pirates theimselfes or their fautors, by the Laws of
this Realm, should or ought to do. And whatsoever person or persons, shall
buy of any Pirate, or by any other fraud or couyn, shall wittyngly take any
manner of gooddes or marchaundises, Piratically taken, or conceal the same: the
person so offendyng, to be taken for a receiuor of Pirates, and so judged,
and suffer according to the Laws of this realm. And whosoever hereafter shall
buy or take by exchange, or any other color any gooddes of any Pirate, or
which were Piratically taken: The kings highness, by the advice aforesaied,
further wills that the person so taking such gooddes, as aforesaied, shall
not only be compelled to deliver thesaied gooddes and Marchaundises, to the
true owners of thesaid gooddes, without any recompense therefore, if they
require the same, but also be further punished by imprisonment or otherwise at
his highness pleasure. And for the better repressyng of the like robberies and
Piracies hereafter, his Majesty wills and requires, all and every his
majesty's loving subjects, to endeavor theimselfes, to the best of their
powers, to apprehende and take thesaied Pirates, by all ways and means they
may, whereby, they shall not only show themselfes good subjects to his
Majesty, but also be well assured to be further rewarded, and considered of
his Majesty, in such sort, as they shall have good cause to be well
contented: wherefore, his highness wills and commands, all Justices of
Peace, all Majors, Shiriefes, Conestables, Hedborowes, portereues, and al his
officers and ministers, to se this proclamacion executed and performed
according to the true meaning thereof, without any parcialitie or favor, as
they tender the kings majesty's pleasure, and will avoid the contrary at
their vttermoste perilles.

The first day of April. A Proclamacion concerning Purueiours.
WHereas at the humble suit of our loving subjects, in our late parliament, we
have condescended and agreed, by thaduise of our dearest uncle the duke of
Somerset, Governor of our person, and Protector of our realms, dominions, and
subjects, and the rest of our privy counsel to forbear to make any
provisions, by any our Purueiors or Takers, but in such sort, and for such
times, as in an act made in our said Parliament for that purpose, does more
plainly appear: being now minded, not only to put thesaid act in execucion,
according to the effect and true meaning of the same, but also to give order,
that such somes of money, as is due to any our Subjects, for any things
heretofore taken to our use, by any our said purueiors and Takers, we have
thought convenient to will and require, al and every of our loving subjects,
within this our County of to whom any money is justly due by us, for things
taken to our use, as aforesaied, to bring in, and deliver to the Shirief of
thesaid County, before the feast of. S Michaell the Archaungell, now next
coming, their bills co^teinyng their own names, their dwelling place, and
the debt, and the things whereof the debt rises, with the names and times,
also by whom, and when the same things were taken. And furthermore our pleasure
and commandment is, that the Shirief of our said County, for the year
being, shall receive all such bills of debtes, as shall be before thesaied
feast of. S. Michaell, brought unto him, and deliver safely within.xx days
next ensuyng thesaied feast of. S Michaell, such of the said bills, as
concern the debt of our household, to the hands of our Coferer, and such as
concern our debtes, for any other our provisions, to the hands of the
Threasaurer, and Barons of our Exchequer, or their deputies for that purpose,
without failyng thereof, as they will answer to us for the contrary at their
peril: whereupon, we mind shortly after God willing, to give such order, for
the satisfaccion of our good Subjects, as shall stand with good reason,
equity and Justice.

The.xi day of April A Proclamacion for the valuacion of Gold
FOrsomuche as diverse persons now of late time, have found the means, to

Rialles, Angels, half Angels, Crounes of the Rose, and other of that or like
standard, and also sovereigns, half Sovereigns, and other of his Majesty's
new coin of gold, to the great disfurnishyng of the realm: his highness, by
thaduise of his most entierly beloved uncle, the lord Protector, and the rest
of the counsel straightly charge and commands that no manner person
whatsoever he be, do from hencefurthe conueigh, any of thesaid coins, broken
or whole, into the parties beyond the Seas, upon pain that every such
offender or offe^dors, shall incur the kings Majesty's displeasure, and
suffer imprisonment of his or their bodies, at his highness will and pleasure,

and statutes, of the realm appoyncted and provided

And further the kings majesty, by the advice aforesaied, straightly charge
and commands, that no manner person do buy or sell, any of thesaied coins

in any of the kings majesty's Courts, by bill, accion of debt or informacion,
as in such cases heretofore has been accustomed, and further to suffer
imprisonment for every such offense, at the kings majesty's will and
pleasure. And for as much as diverse persons, within this realm, as well
Goldsmithes as Marchantes and men of other occupacions, has used now of late,
contrary to the laws and statutes of this realm, to buy and sell the kings
majesty's coin, of, and for higher price then it is, by his Majesty's
Proclamacio^, rated and valued and so cull and try out the finest and
heauiest, and melte them down, or otherwise make gain upon them, leuyng the
lightest and lest fine, only to be curraunt emonges the kings Majesty's

The One moytie of the which forfeicture, shall be to the kings highness the other

their Indentures, any thing in this present proclamacion notwithstanding

Furthermore, it is diverse ways come to notice and knowledge, that su^dery

Majesty's coin, their adherentes, fautors, abetters, or concealers, has been
wont and accustomed.

And his highness, by thaduise aforesaid, straightly charge and commands,

and pleasure, and will answer to the contrary at their vttermoste perilles.

The.vi. day of April. A Proclamacion for the reformacion of light horsemenne.
WHere as it is come to the knowledge, of the Kings most excellent majesty,
that emo^ges other disorders of late time, crept into the ancient discipline
of war, heretofore observed most straightly, by the Subjects of this
realm, as the chiefest cause of so many victories, which, by means thereof
have risen to the same: there is a notable and perilous sort, of deceit and
breche of that discipline, used as well by capitaines, as soldiers enterteined
in his highness wages, and specially such capitaines of lighthorsemen, and those
of their bands, being of the Counties of Northumberlande, Cumberlande,
Westmerlande and other places of the borders, as for defense of the same, are
enterteined still in wages, to his Majesty's no small charge, and expense of
threasure: which capitaines, having not so much before their iyes, their
duty toward their sovereign Lord and Country, nor yet their own sureties,
as a vile mind, and filthy respect to their own gain, by deceiuyng of his
highness, and pollyng of the soldiers, without shame or dread, do not only
diminishe their nombers, appoyncted to serve under them (saving that for a
color at the Muster day, they have some others to supply the void places)
but also by pattishment with unmeet and vnseruisable men, for a less wages
then his highness allows, do in such sort disguise their nombers (contrary
to his highness expectacion, and trust reposed in them) as in a manner the
third part of the nombers, which his majesty appoyncteth and pays for, is
not ready, able, or sufficiently furnished to do that service, which is looked
for to the great deceit of his majesty, and no less danger of such other
his highness true Subjects and soldiers, as upon confidence of thaide of such
light horsemen, to join with them at any encou^tre with the enemy, find
themselfes deceived and abandoned. According to the which said most naughty
and shameful behavior of such capitaines, the soldiers in like sort, that
are of their bands, taking thereat example and boldness, do neither provide
themselfes of horse or harnes, mete to serve withal, nor yet being commanded
to set furthe, toward any place of service, do repair thither togethers, but
sometime more then the half part remains behind, or if they go, stick not
to return home by small companies without leave, with several prays and
booties, more sought of the^ then service. And that is wourst of all, at any
approach or affronture of the enemy, without order, or respect of abidyng by
the standerd, do use commonly upon every little moment, or causeles, to begin
the flight, betraiyng their fellows, which, through such their fliyng lose
often times, that assured advantage of victory, which with their tariyng,
they might both have been partakers of. And moreover if so be they tarry, they
do it not so much for discharge of their profession of service, as only for
desire of spoil and pillage, which pillage they seek not so much upon the
enemies, as rather upon his highness own subjects or fre^des, namely the
assured Scottishmen, whose gooddes and cattals, diverse of those light horsemen
of Northumberlande, and others of the borders, have of late most rauenously
spoiled and robbed, as by sundery complaints of such assured men, it has
been touched: his majesty therefore, myndyng the reformacion hereof, by
thaduise of his derest uncle and con^sailor, the duke of Somerset, governor of
his person, and protector of his majesty's realms dominions and subjects,
and the rest of his highness privy cou^saill, has determined, and straightly
charge and commands, all and singular the capitaines of any bands, or
nombers of light horsemen, and specially capitaines of any ba^des, or number of
light horsemen being of the county of Northu^berlande, or any other County or
place, upon any the borders a^empst Scotland, that they according to the
nombers them appoyncted, and wages for the same allowed, fail not from
hencefurthe to entertain, and have in continual aredines, thesaied whole and
entier number, without diminishme^t in any part of thesaied number, or
defalcacion of any part of the wages, so allowed by his highness, to every
such light horse man of their band. And further, that thesaied Capitaines
fail not, to have their said complet bands always, in such a redines, from
time to time to serve, as upon one hours warnyng, to be given them by his
highness commissaries, wardens, or other chief officers there for the time
being, they may be found ready to set furthe, to what place they shall be
appoyncted. And moreover, that none of thesaied Capitaines, or any light
horsemen of their bands, be so hardy at any road, or other invasion of the
enemies ground or defense of the borders, to depart from the standard, or
otherwise forsake or skatter from the rest of the army or company, either with
their whole ba^des, or smaller parts for spoil, or other cause: Nor yet be so
hardy to forsake or depart from any Fortress, to the guard whereof they shall be
appoyncted, unless they shall have express commandment, or license of the
chieftain of the enterprise, or capitain of ye fort so to do

And finally, that thesaid capitaines and light horsemen of their bands,
forbear and refrain from hencefurth, to commit any spoils, or other pillages
upon any of the assured Scottishmen, their goods, lands or cattalles, which
have been received into his majesty's proteccion, unless the commissaries or
chieftain for the time being, upon the not keeping of promise by those assured
men, do give them commandment so to do.

And that in likewise, they forbear from the enbaiselyng or pilferyng, either
of Horses, Geldynges, Harneis, Weapons, or any other thing pertaynyng to any
other soldier, seruyng his majesty in the wars on that side, whereby the
service of the party so robbed, by any of thesaied light horsemen, should be
hindered and he end ammaged. Also, that no capitain of light horsemen, or
soldier of his band, be so hardy as to sell, give, exchange, or otherwise
by any fraud, cautele, or train, directly, or indirecty procure or find the
means, to set out of purpose any horse, mare or geldyng to be taken or come
into the possession of any Scottishman, or other stranger being his majesty's
enemy, upon pain that what soever capitain or capitaines, souldior or
soldiers of their bands, aforsaied, which shall in any part neglect,
disobeye, or break any poynct of this his majesty's commandment and order of
reformacion in these several cases, before rehearsed, or else disobey or break
the orders of reformacion set furthe by the last Parliament, in the Articles
where pain of death is expressed, shall from hencefurth, upon due proof of the
offense, incur the daungier and loss of his or their life's by execucion, at
the direccion of his majesty's Lieutenant, Warden, Commissaries, or other
general Capitain or governor, there by his highness for the time placed.

And semblably, if any soldier or soldiers, being placed in garrisons
within any his Majesty's pieces, upon the borders, or within Scotland, being by
the Capitain of thesaied pieces assigned, to any charge of watch or ward, for
the surety of thesaied piece, from hencefurth be so hardy, before license or
discharge of the Capitain, to leave their watch or ward appoyncted, to the
danger of loss of the piece: his Majesty, by the foresaied advise, does will
and order, that the offender or offenders herein, upon due proffe shall incur
the like danger and pain of death, at the direccion aforsaid. And in case any
assured Scottishman, shall help to co^ueigh by any means of purpose any Horse,
Mare or Gelding unto the enemy: his majesty wills and is pleased, that upon
due proffe thereof, the party offendyng herein, shall lose the benefit of his
assurance, and from thencefurth be used, as if no such assurance had been
made unto him: straightly chargyng and commaundyng, all and singular his
Majesty's Commissaries, Wardens, and other generalles upon the borders, for the
time being, and by whatsoever name of office, it shall please his highness to
name them, that they not only se the whole effect of this reformacion, to be
put in ure and observed, upon the publishyng of this present Proclamacion, but
also that they fail not to correct and punish the offenders, here against or
any poynct hereof, in no less degree then is herein contained, as otherwise
they will sustein his Majesty's displeasure and indignacion, and answer for
the contrary, at their vttermoste perilles.

The.xvij. day of April. A Proclamacion concerning Diyng and Dressyng of
Clothes
WHere, by the making of untrue, and false Clothes, with in this realm now

And for the better execucion of this Proclamacion, his majesty by the advice

thesaied Lord Protector, and the rest of the priuey counsel, that the same
offenders may receive condign punishment, for such their falshod and deceit,
according to their demerites.

The xxix. day of April. A Proclamacion, for tale tellers.
FOR somuche, as some leude persons now of late, notwithstanding diverse
laws, statutes and proclamacio^s, heretofore made to the contrary, has not
ceased to spread abroad and tell vain and false tales, as well of the kings
Majesty's own person, the lord Protector, and the rest of his highness
Counsel, as of his highness fortresses, capitaines and soldiers, in the
North parties, and beyond the seas, and of his Majesty's other affairs,
feinyng falsely great overthrows losses and dangers, to the slander of the
kings highness, empairyng of his Majesty's service, and discoragyng of the
Kings Subjects: Besides that, thereby they have given to strangers occasion
to write into distaunt Countries, such tales for news, to the great dishonor
of his highness, the same being most false and untrue. Therefore, his Majesty
compelled by the manifold inconveniences, which might ensue thereof, if order,
stay, and redress were not foreseen and provided, for such malicious, vain
and sedicious lie tellers, and sowers abroad of false and liyng rumors,
considering, that all other punishment heretofore appoyncted, will not suffice
for the redress, and amendment hereof, by the advice and consent of his most
entierly beloved uncle, the lord Protector, and the rest of his highness
Counsel, wills and straightly commands, all Justices of Peace, all
Majors, Bailifes, Sheriefes, Constables, Hedborowes, and all other his highness
officers and ministers, whosoever they be, to do their best endeavor, and put
in effect, by all possible means they can, to apprehend all such sowers and
tellers abroad, of vain and forged tales and lies, of his highness, the lord
Protector, his Majesty's counsel or affairs, and to commit them to ward,
until such time, as they bring forth the aucthor, or first teller of such
vain tale or lie, or if they can bring furthe none, then to keep such teller,
as thaucthor or first maker of such lies, in straight prison, and certify
thereof the Lord Protector, and the Kings Majesty's counsel. And his
majesty's pleasure, by the advice aforsaied, is, that every such aucthour, or
maker of such false tale or news, shall be committed into the Galley, there to
row in cheines, as a slave or forsary, during the kings majesty's pleasure to
the example and terror of all other.

And furthermore, his highness will and pleasure, by thaduise aforesaied is,
that this present proclamacio^, be with all diligence and severity, put in
execucion and ure, as his said highness officers, will answer to the contrary
at their peril.

The.xxix. day of April A Proclamacion concerning Wolles.
FOR as much, as upon the pitiful complaint, made unto the kings majesty, by
his loving subjects the clothiers of this his Realm, it appears, that
through the gredines of some persons, who perceiuyng, that Wolles is so
necessary for the keeping of the multitude of his highness subjects from
idleness, that it cannot be lacked, colourably made and named theimselfes
factors, for Merchants of the staple, and so have of late days, used to buy
and sell Wolles, for their singular profit, not only the price of the same
Wolles is so advanced, that within short time, if it be not forseen, a great
number of his subjects, shall be destitute of living, and driven to such
misery, as is not tolerable in any good common wealth, but also that the
Clothiers, cannot make Clothes, of the just breadth, length, content and
goodness, that is prescribed by the laws and statutes of this his Realm,
whereby, great infamy has in foreign nations, grown to this Realm, and
thesaied Clothes in some places have been burnte, to the great loss of the
Marchantes, and in some places have been banished, and forboden to be brought
thither: his highness considering the daungiers, that may thereby ensue to this
his realm, and mindyng the preuencion thereof, nothing doubtyng, but such as
be his loving, faith full, and obedient subjects, will willyngly do for the
love of the country, that those that be eiuill, must be forced to do for
fear, by thaduise of his most entierly beloved uncle, Edward duke of
Somerset, Governor of his royal person, and Protector of all his realms,
dominions and subjects, and the rest of his Majesty's privy counsel,
straightly wills, charge and commands, that from, and after the first
day of June next coming, no person upon pain of his majesty's displeasure and
grievous imprisonment of his body, other then such persons, and their household
servants, as shall convert the same, only into Yarne, Clothe, Hattes, Cappes,
Girdelles, Worsted Stamin, Say, Arras, Tapestrie, or any other kind of thing,
to be wrought within this realm, and Marchantes of the Staple, and their
household servants, for the only provision of the said Staple, and for to be
shipped, only to the said Staple, shall by him or her self, or by any other,
buy or bargain, or take promise of bargain, of any Wolles, being now
unshorn, of the growyng of the Shires, or Counties of this realm, or of
Wales, or any of them. Also, his highness by the advice aforesaied, straightly
charge and commands, that no person, from, and after thesaied first day
of June, shall buy or bargain, for any Yarne, other then such, or his or
their household servants, as shall convert the same into Clothes, Hattes,
Cappes, Girdelles, Worstedes, Says, Stamin, Arras, Tappistrie, or other
things, to be bought within this realm, upon pain of his graces displeasure,
and imprisonment of his body.

And for the better execucion hereof his highness by the advice aforesaied,
straightly charge and commands all and singular Justices of Peace, Majors,
Sherifes, and Bailifes, not only to se this Proclamacion truly executed, but
also if any person, be justly accused before him or them, for co^tempnyng, or
breakyng this Proclamacion, or any part thereof, they shall commit such
person to ward, there to remain without bail or mainprise, till the kings
majesty's, and his said Counsels pleasure shall be further known.

The.xxij. day of May. A Proclamacion for the adnichilatyng of Testons.
WHere as the Kings Majesty, by thaduise of his most dear uncle the lord
Protector, and the rest of his highness Counsel, for diverse great and urgent
consideracions, had commanded that all manner of persons, should bring all
coin, commonly called Testons, coined with the face and stamp, of his highness
most dear father, the late king Henry the eight, before the feast of Christmas
last past, into the Toure of London, or other his Majesty's Mintes, to the
intent the same might be exchau^ged into shillynges, Grotes, or other kind of
moneis: it has so chaunsed that by reason, as well of the multitude of that
coin, heretofore made in the time of thesaid late king, his majesty's father,
as also by the great quantite and foison of the same coin, cou^terfaicted and
brought into this realm, being current here, all thesaid Testons has not be
changed. And thereupon his highness, by the advice aforesaied, was pleased that
the said Proclamacion, should be enlarged unto a longer day, and so has
permitted and suffered thesaied coin of Testons, to be current emonges his
subjects, until the first of May last past, upon trust that in that space,
upon the consideracions in thesaied Proclamacion expressed, every manne for his
part helpyng that ways, all manner of thesaied Testons, of the stamp of
thesaied late King of famous memory, should have been brought into the mintes
and exchaunged. In the which space yet many abusyng his highness clemency, has
kept their testons still in their hands, or otherwise uttered them, and fewer
since that time, till now of late have been brought into his highness Mintes.
The which Testons, if they should now remain only mere bullion, should be
great loss and hinderaunce to his Majesty's subjects: and if the same stay or
Proclamacion, should in any wise be released, it should be greatest loss and
hynderau^ce to the realm, and a present occasion of continual bryngyng in
more counterfaict Testons: therefore the kings Majesty, by the advice of the
lord Protector, and the rest of his highness counsel, straightly charge
and commands, thesaied proclamacion of disanullyng, and criyng down of
thesaid Testons, to be kept emonges all his loving subjects, so that the same
be never herafter taken, for current or lawful money, but may lawfully be
refused, of any manner of person: And yet nevertheless, of his most Princely
clemency and liberality, his highness by thaduise aforesaied, is content that
al such somes of money, as shall be due to his Majesty, as well for the Relief,
granted in the last Sessions of the Parliament, as for all other Rentes and
debtes, may be paid in good and lawful Testons, of the stamp and coin of
his majesty's father, at any time before the first of June next following, and
so received of his highness Threasurers, until thesaid first of June next
following only, after the rate and value of.xij. d. every Teston. After which
time, his highness pleasure is, that in no wise thesaid testons, be any more
received, of any his highness officers of receipte, of, or for that price.
Nevertheless, for the space and time of two Months after, that is to say,
unto the end and last day of July next following, his highness is content, that
all good and lawful Testons, at his majesty's Mintes, shall be received for
bullion, after the rate of.xij. d. the piece of any person, who shall bring
them thither. And further, that it shall be lefull to any man, to buy any good
and lawful Testons, of thesaid coin and stamp, of the late king, and made in
any of the Mintes, within this realm of England, to that intent to bring them
to the Mintes, of any person not disposed to bring them himself: so that he do
buy them for no less price, then after.xi. d. ob. the piece, and not under,
upon pain that whosoever, for his own gredines and lucre, shall buy any such
Testons, for less value then after.xi. d ob. the piece, to the damage of the
poor men, who would sell the same, shall forfaict therefore the Testons so
bought, and ten times the value of them, whereof one moytie to the kings
majesty, the other to the demaunder of the said forfaict, by bill, accion of
debt, or informacio^, in any of the kings majesty's Courts of Record, where
no essone, Proteccion nor wager of law, shall serve or be allowed. And his
highness further is content, that all his officers and Ministers, may receive
all such good and lawful Testons, and so repaie them again unto his highness
after thesaied price of.xi. d. ob. the piece during only thesaied Months, of
June and July. In the which time, for that price of.xi. d. ob. the piece, they
shall refuse no lawful and good Testons, of any his highness subjects. After
the which last day of the monethe of July next following, his highness
express will and pleasure, by thaduise aforesaid, is, that the coin called
Testons, of his highness father, king Henry the eightes stamp, shall neither be
received of his highness officers, ne of none others, nor yet at the Mintes or
exchange, as coin or money of any valuacio^, but after such sort as plate or
any other strange bullion is, or then shall be, that is to say, according to
the rate of the standard, and the quantity of fine silver in them contained,
and none otherwise.

The.xij. day of June. A Proclamacion pardonyng certain sedicious persons.
WHere as of late, the Kings majesty moved of a Godly zeal, and love to the
common wealth of the realm, by the advice of his derest uncle, Edward duke of
Somerset Governor of his highness person, and Protector of all his Realms,
Dominions and subjects, and the rest of his majesty's privy counsel, did by
Proclamacion, will and commau^de, al manner of persons, who had offended
against the good and wholesome laws heretofore provided, against the decaie of
houses, and unlawful enclosures, to amend their such offenses, and to
redress all faults by them committed, against thesaid acts and statutes,
and against the benefit of the common wealth, upon pain to encurre the
dangers and pains, in thesaied acts and statutes provided: And for the
better performaunce thereof, by the advice aforesaied, willed and commanded,
all his highness officers and Ministers, to whom it did appertain, to see
the same redressed, to receive informacions, make inquiry, and with all speed
and earnest endeavor, se to the redress and punishment of all such offenders,
as by the laws and statutes of the realm, they might and ought to do. Upon
this most Godly warnyng, admonisheme^t and Proclamacio^, which was to keep
order and laws, his highness is advertised, that a great number of rude and
ignorant people, in certain Shires of England, has taken occasion, or at the
least pretended to take occasion, of dooyng great and most perilous and
heinous disorder, and contrary to all good laws and statutes, and the order of
this Realm, have rioteously with Routes and compaignies, with force, strength
and violence, of their own hedde and authority, assembled them selfs,
plucked down men's hedges disparked their parkes, and being led by furious
and light guydes of uproar, taken upon them the direccion of things, the
kings royal power and sword and committed such enormitie and offense, as
they have justly therefore, merited the loss of life, lands and gooddes, and
to be made example to all other: But for so much, as they have humbly
submitted theimself, and demanded pardon, being sorry for their former
offenses: the kings highness, of a most high clemency, and tender love to
his subjects, is content not to look upon his Justice herein to be executed,
but much more of natural mercy and clemency, toward his said loving
Subjects, and so for this time, acceptyng that this outrage, was done rather
of folly, and of mistakyng thesaied Proclamacion, and at the instigacio^ and
mocion, of certain leude and sedicious persons, then of malice or any eiuill
will, that his Subjects did bear, either to his highness, or to the quiet of
this realm, of his Majesty's most aboundaunt clemency, and tender pity
toward his subjects, by the advice of thesaid lode Protector, and the rest
of his highness privy counsel is contented and pleased, to remit and pardon,
all thesaied outragies, misbehauours, riottes and conspiracies, to all and
singular his Subjects, other then to such, as be already apprehended and in
prison, as heddes and stirrers of thesaied outrage and riottes, and therefore,
wills and commands, al Justices of peace, Majors, shirifes, bailifes, and
al other his highness officers and ministers, not to enterrupt, vex or trouble,
for, and in his Majesty's behalf, any manner person, other then is specified
before, of, or for any offense, injury, contempt or conspiracy done at thesaied
stir or riottes, lately made, about the breakyng of enclosures, so that they
do not attempt or go about, any such thing hereafter: but if so be there be
any just cause, to complain for default of Justice, or lack of redress in any
such enclosure or default, made against thesaied Acts and Statutes, before
specified in this case provided, they, who find theimself justly grieved or
iniuried, may give informacion, make suit or complaint to the kings majesty,
or other his highness officers, deputed to the redress of all such offenses,
according to the laws of the realm, and the good and lawful order of
the same: But if any man, shall at any time hereafter, attempt to make or go
about to make, any such riot or unlawful asse^bly, for any such cause
before rehearsed, his Majesty's will and pleasure is, by the advice aforesaid,
that all such offenders shall immediately be apprehended, by the next Justice
or Justices of Peace, and lose the benefit of this most gracious pardon, and
suffer such pains of death, loss of lands, goods and cattalles, as by the
Laws of the Realm, in such case is provided, any thing in this present
Proclamacion heretofore mentioned, notwithstanding.

The second day of July. A Proclamacion, for the prices of Victualles.
THe kings Majesty, having the principal and continual charge of the common
wealth and tra^quilitie of this realm, for the which cause, almighty God has
given to his majesty power to rule, and to all his people has enjoined,
lowlynes to obey, certainly understands, by thinformacion and good advise,
of his most dear uncle Edward duke of Somerset, Governor of his most royal
person, and Protector of his realms Dominions and subjects, and others of
his privy counsel: that of late time the prices of all manner victual,
necessary for man's sustenau^ce, be so heightened and raised, above the
accustomed and reasonable values, that thereby (except spedy remedy be
provided) very great loss and damage, must needs chance to his majesty's
loving subjects, and therefore, both of wisdom, wherewith his majesty
uses to consider the state of his common wealth, and of pity, which at all
times, his majesty conceiueth upon the lack and greues of his people, has by
long and deliberat study, of his said dear uncle, the lord Protector, and the
rest of his priuey counsel, concluded and finally resolved, to provide remedy
herein, the which (restyng upon the former redress of sondery disorders, in
the whole commonwealth) although it cannot be so absolutely and spedely had as
his majesty's most hearty desire is, yet it is thought by his Majesty, for
the present disorders, a great relief to put in due execucion, diverse good
laws and statutes, provided heretofore, by authority of Parliament, in the
reigns of the kings majesty's most noble progenitors, and especially two
pollitique good estatutes, made at Westminster in the.xxv. year of the reign
of his majesty's most dear father late deceassed, king Henry the eight,
ordained, as by the same appears, very pollitiquely, for the redress of these
like disorders of prices, which at any time thence after might happen:
theffect of which later estatute is, that the lord Threasorer, the Lord
Chauncellor of England, the Lord President of the Kings most honorable
Counsel, the Lord Priuey Seal, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain,
and all other Lords of the Kings Counsel, the Threasorer and Comptroller of
the Kings most honorable house, the Chauncellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Justices of either Benche, the Chauncellor, Cha^berlain, under thresorer,
and the Barons of the Kings Eschequer, or seven of them at the lest whereof
the lord Threasorer, the lord Chauncellor, the lord President of the kings
counsel, or the lord Priuey Seal to be one, should have power and
authority, from time to time (as the case should require) to set and tax
reasonable prices of all kinds of victualles, mentioned in thesaid act, how
they should be sold in gross or by retaile, for relief of the kings

Shirief of our County of within two days next after the receipt of this said
Proclamacion, that ye with all speed, shall Proclaim the premises, in all
Market tounes within thesaid county of and that all manner our subjects, shall
obey the same, not only upon the pains abouesaied, but also to incur our
indignacion and displeasure.

And furthermore, the kings Majesty, of his authority and power roy all,
straightly charge and commands, all manner his Justices of Peace, Sherifes,
Majors, and Bailifes of any tounes corporate, or any other ministers, to be
assigned and appoyncted by any two Justice of Peace of thesaid County, if any
the Market or Markettes, within thesaid County, shall lack wherewithal to
furnishe the markettes, for the relief of his loving subjects, that then they
shall forsee and provide, that the Owners, Grasiers, Drouers, Fermors,
Broggers, or any other of any kind of estate or degree whatsoever, nere
adioynyng, having such store of any kind of the aforesaied victual, that he
may spare part of his said store, be it lean or fat (over and besides the
store necessary, for the main tenaunce of his household, the alowa^ce whereof
must be made, in respect of his accustomed expenses, and the time of another
usual provision) toward the furniture of the Market, shall by the
appoynctement, and order of thesaied Justices, and other officers above named,
bring to the Market and Markettes, such number and quantity of thesaied
victualles, and at such time and times, as they shall think the cause and
necessity requires, and the same shall sell there, according to the prices by
thesaied Justices to be rated, as for an example, where the Markettes cannot be
served, with sufficient quantity of Motton, so that in default thereof, the
people hap to have over much lack, then in that and like cases, the Kings
majesty's will and commandment is, that thesaied Justices of every cou^tie,
and officers above named upon the certain knowledge of that lack shall compel
all and every such person and persons, as shall have, nigh to thesaid Market
tounes, the number of.v. C. shere sheep, for every hundredth of the same five

the prices to be rated by thesaied Justices and other officers, and if less
lack, then less in number, upon like pain aforesaid, for every sheep not so
brought to the Market.

Furthermore, because the prices of the beiffes and muttons hereto adjoined,
be but the prices of Beues and Muttons a live, and sold in gross and not by
retaile, as the Butcher uses to do, his Majesty, notwithstanding the tenor of
this Proclamacion, licenseth the Butcher in such cases, where he shall buy of
those prices, so to sell above thesaid price, as it shall be thought and ordered
by thesaied Justices, and officers above named, according to the Laws and

Boucher being no Grasier, having bought and in his possession, any manner
cattall, above the prices herein contained, before the time of this

cattle so bought of the prices, according to the rate and proporcion, of
the same price he paid, or then became debtour for, without any couin, by the
space of eight days, after the Proclamacion shall be Proclaimed, in the next
Market town to his dwelling place, or to the place where he shall that sell,
and after those eight days, then to remain subject to the whole tenor of the
Proclamacion. And herein the kings majesty, to whom only under God,
apperteineth auengement, punishment, and redress of his peoples offenses,
whatsoever the same be, most straightly charge, and upon the pain of his
highness extreme indignacio^, commands all manner of people, to seek the
redress and amendment of any manner offense, against the tenor of this
Proclamacion, or any other estatute or laws, only by order of his majesty's
laws without force, riot, manasse, unlawful assembles, or any other
disturbance of peace: and on the contrary, if any subject, of what degree or
estate so ever he be, shall contrariwise, and unlawfully, that is to say,
otherways then by complaint or order of law, seek begin, or enterprise to
redress his own cause, or the cause of any other, be the same never so just:
then his majesty asserteineth and sets the same to know, that without any
manner favor, or grace to be hoped upon, he and every of them, so offendyng,
shall surely feel, by extreme punishment, the kings highness utter
indignacion, and in such case no extremity to be spared, but to be taken
and accepted, not only as unkind, unnatural, vnlouyng and disobedient
Subjects, but also as high traitors and rebellors, against the kings
majesty's own royal person, his croune, state and dignity

The.viij. day of July. A Proclamacion, for tale tellers.
THe kings most excellent Majesty, has certain knowledge given, as well to
his own Majesty, as to his most dear uncle, Edward Duke of Somerset,
governor of his person, and Protector of all his realms, dominions and
subjects, and to the rest of his highness cou^saill, that in diverse his
Majesty's Counties, of this his realm, there be dispersed and severed abroad,
sundery light, leude, idle, sedicious, busy, and disordered persons, whereof
the most part have neither place to inhabit in* neither seeks any stay to
live by, but having been either condemned of Felonies, and prison breakers,
run from the wars and sea rouers, departed from the kings guarrisons, and
loyterers, whereby they become desperate persons, and now employe and labor
themselfes, ru^nyng and postyng from place to place, County to County, Town
to town by day to day, to stir up rumors, raise up tales, imagine news,
whereby, they seek to stir, gather together and assemble, the kings true
subjects, of simplicity and ignorance deceived, and by that pretense, such
leude ruffians, tale tellers, and unruly vacabondes, become ryngleders and
masters of the kings people, sekyng to spoil, rob and rauin, where, and
whom they list or may, and so to live, wax rich, and feed of other men's
labors, money and food, they themselfes another willing to serve where they
might, neither abidyng when they be well entertained: and being thus in
several places of this his Realm, at the last not able long to continue
together with their assembles, according to their mischeuous purposes, the same
assembles being in substance, of such the kings poor Subjects, as though
by ignorance and enticementes, of those forsaied tale tellers they offend,
yet shortly by the goodness of god, acknowledge their faults, and return
theimselfes to their duties, most sorowfully repent, receiuyng for the same,
the Kings majesty's great mercy, by his pardon, and by the reason of the
quiet order, the falling, cessyng and appesyng of such assembles, thesaied
runnagates, tale teilers, and sedicious persons, fail and lack their
purposes, and mischeuous inte^tes, so that they accustomyng their eiuill
nature, and escapyng from the places of their first atte^ptes, have and do
daily resort to new places, and so from place to place, Shire to Shire, never
quietyng theimself, but deuisyng slanderous tales, and diuulgyng to the people
such kind of news, as they think may most redely, move them to vprores
and tumultes, and for the further deceipte also, pretend to them, they seek
to redress the common wealth, therefore his majesty, by thaduise of his said
dear uncle, the lord Protector, and the rest of his majesty's privy
counsel, to thaduoydyng of the great inconveniences which, of the
sufferaunce hereof daily does ensue, and to admonish his good Subjects,
which hitherto have not felt the peril of these poisoned eiuill people,
most straightly charge and commands, all manner and every his Justices,
Shiriffes, Co^stables, Bailiffes Hedboroughes, and all other his majesty's
ministers and officers whatsoever they be, to be most diligent, and from
time to time, to be in their charge atte^dant, and therein also to take some
good especial pollitique order, for the apprehension and attachyng of all
manner of such persons, whatsoever they be, which either as vacabundes,
waifaryng men, stragglars, or otherwise, in what manner soever he be, shall
bring any tale to any place, or invent or tell any news, or conceal and keep
close, longer then he may convenient, the brynger, inuentor, or teller, which
tale or news so brought, invented or told, shall, does, or may cause, any
unlawful assembly of the people, or any tumulte and uproar, or shall sound
slanderous to the Kings Majesty his croune, the lord Protector, and other
of his counsel, or any otherwise shall move the people, unlawfully to remedy
or redress their own causes and grifes by force and without law, which
office belongs only to the Kings majesty, and to the Magistrates under
him, and therein daily, his Majesty's said dear uncle and counsel, most
studiously trauaileth. And the same leude person or persons so apprehended, to
be brought unto the kings Majesty, or his said uncle and counsel, or to any
one of thesaid cou^sail, for every the which so brought the kings majesty
assures his officer and minister, the bringer of him, not only his costs and
charges, fully to be paid: but also to have his Majesty's most hearty and
effectual thanks. And if any other the Kings majesty's loving subjects,
shall at any time know certainly, any such tale carier or rumor runner,
news spredder, or sedicion sower, and of him so inform and give knowledge, to
any of the kings majesty's officers or ministers, so that the same eiuill
person, either might or is taken, and apprehended by the same officer, and by
force of thesaid informacion, then likewise the same informer, knowledge geuer,
accuser, and vtterer, shall have of the kings majesty's reward, for every

The.xi. day of July. A Proclamacion, for the punishment of the rebels of
Devonshire and Cornwall.
WHere as diverse eiuill disposed persons, are at this present, rebelliously
and traitorously assembled, in sundery companies, within these, the kings
Majesty's Counties of Deuon, and Cornwall, showing theimselfes, not only to
contempne and disobeye his most royal majesty, his laws, ordinances, and
most godly procedynges but also to levy war against his highness, to the
great displeasure of almighty God, his majesty most graciously waiyng, and
considering what appertains, to the good order and quiet reformacion of his
good and loving subjects, by thaduise of his most entierly beloved uncle, the
lord Protector, and the rest of his privy counsel, is pleased and
contented, and by this present Proclamacion, wills it to be notified and
known, to all and singular his loving subjects, that all and every of his
said subjects, which, at the time of the publishyng of this present
proclamacion, do continue in their unlawful, and disobedient assembles, within
thesaid Counties, and within days, next after this Proclamacion, shall not
willyngly and obedently submit, and yield theimselfes, unto the right honorable
lord Russell, his highness Lieutenaunt in those parts, shall be demed, accepted
and taken, for rebels and traitors, against his highness most royal person,
his Imperial Croune and dignity. For more terror and example, of whose
punishment, and for the good incouragyng and aduauncyng, of such his true,
loving, and obedient subjects, as shall withdraw themselfes, from thesaied
rebellious traitors, and of such others as shall aid and assist his highness
said Lieutenaunt, to suppress and subdue thesaid rebels and traitors. For
so much as the forfaicture of all manner of goods, cattals, offices, pencions,
lands, teneme^tes, farms, copy holds, and other hereditamentes, of al and
every traitors and traitor, within this his Majesty's realm and dominions,
only and most justly apperteineth, and belongs unto his Majesty. The same
is further pleased and contented, that al and singular, the forfaictures of all the gooddes, cattalles, offices, pencions, mauours, lands, tenementes, farms,
copy holds, and other hereditamentes, of thesaid rebels and traitors,
which shall persevere and continue, in their rebellion and treason, shall grow,
come, and be unto all and every such person and persons, as shall first
have, take, possede, and attain to thesaied goods and cattalles, or shall
first enter into thesaied manours, lands, tenementes and hereditamentes, and
the same shall have, hold, possede, and enjoy, to his and their own proper
use, commodity and behalf, in as large and ample sort, as his highness, by
means and right of thesaid forfaicture, and confiscacion ought and may dispose
of the same, and shall have thereof such assurance, from his Majesty by his
Letters patentes, or otherwise, as they or any of them, can or shall best
imagine or devise.

The.xij. day of July. A Proclamacion, concerning the effect of the Kings
Majesty's Pardon given to the Rebels.
THe Kings Majesty, by the advice of his entierly beloved uncle, Edward Duke
of Somerset, Governor of his person, and Protector of all his Majesty's
realms, dominions, and subjects, and the rest of his privy counsel
considers, that as it is the fruit of his mercy, to receive his humble,
repentant, and sorrowful subjects, knowleging their offices, to the benefit
and grace of his mercy, so also, is it the reputacion of his majesty's mercy,
to defend, and save harmless, all such which submits theimselfes, to
his mercy, and to let them feel his proteccion, with their quiet, as they
have sought it, with their devout repentance, and so to save his repentaunt
people with mercy, as his Majesty ought to punish, his obstinate subjects
with Justice. In co^sideracio^ whereof, his majesty, by the advice aforsaid,
wills, admonishes, and commands, first, all manner of his subjects,
which of late, by their humble submission, and sorrowful repentance, of their
offenses committed, in sundery unlawful and rioteous asse^bles: that they from
hencefurth, be of such good behauior, in the peace of God, and the kings
majesty, and in all their acts and deeds, be so quiet, peaceable, and well
ordered, that the kings majesty may think his grace and pardon, bestowed
upon them with effect. And likewise his majesty wills and straightly
commands, all manner his other subjects, of what degree so ever he be,
having suffered any manner of grief, damage, or loss, by the act of any of the
abouesaid the kings subjects, whilst they offended, and before they received
the pardon from his majesty, that they shall not by accion, suit, violence or
compulsion, force, punish, aduenge or correct, any manner of offense,
trespass, or unlawful act, committed by thesaid offenders, and pardoned by
the same act, but shall suffer and permit them to enjoy and take the benifite
of the kings majesty's pardon, with like intent and purpose; as the same has
been meant and intended by the Kings Majesty.

The.xvi. day of July. A Proclamacion, for the execucion of a Law Marciall.
FOR as much, as the Kings Majesty has of late, for the redress of
unlawful enclosures, and such like enormities, directed his several
Commissions, with large instruccions for the same, into every his counties, not
only aucthorisyng his Commissioners, to redress and reform al manner of
things, so far forth as the laws could any wise be construed or expounded,
but also by special his Majesty's Letters Missiue, has charged the same
Commissioners, upon great pain, in the same letters contained, to redress and
amend their own proper faults, which Commissions be now part in execucion,
and part ready to be executed, and delayed only, by the folly of the people,
sekyng their own redress unlawfully: So that no subject, can any more require
of any prince, then by his majesty, his said uncle, and cou^saill has been
devised, ordered and commanded. Yet nevertheless, his majesty understands
that diverse of his Subjects, neither co^sidryng how they be ordained by God
to be subjects and obey, nether regardyng their sovereign lords most earnest
good will and zeal, which he bears, and daily declares to his common wealth
neither having in remembrance what distruccion it is to themselfes, to trouble
and disquiet the state of the commonwealth, thereby impouerishing themselves,
wekening the realm, and breding sedicion and continual co^tencion, betwixt one
subject and another, do attempt and trauail, from time to time, and from place
to place, to make asse^bles, riottes, conuencious, stirs, and vprores, and by
the^ so unlawfully made, presume to do and attempt, that which ought only to
be done, by thaucthoritie of the king, and his majesty's laws, yea, and in
many poinctes, according to the eiuil disposicio^ of their assemblers, attempt
with violence and fury, such unlawful things, as be extremely forbidden, by
all justice and law, and to be abhorred of any good Christian: For the which
causes, his Majesty, neither of good Justice and honor, neither for the
estate and safe guard, of his highness Realm, will, or may endure his
subjects, so to offend without present punishment and correccion: But as a
Prince reignyng by almighty Gods providence, most mighty, and in Justice
terrible, by the advice of his said dear uncle, the lord Protector, and the
rest of his majesty's privy counsel, straightly charge, and with the
threatnyng of his sword commands all manner his subjects, of what degree,
condition, kind or estate, so ever he or they be, to depart, return, and
cesse furthewith, upon this Proclamacion Proclaimed, from all manner their
unlawful, assembles, ryottes, and vprores, and quietly and in peace, to take
and receive his majesty's order and direccio^, the redress of their wro^ges,
whatsoever they be, and that also no manner of Subject, of what degree,
condition, kind, or estate so ever he or they be, shall from hencefurthe, by
Dromme, Tabret, Pipe, or any other instrument, strikyng or soundyng Bell or
Belles ryngyng, open criyng, postyng, ridyng, ru^nyng, or by any news, rumors,
and tales inuentyng, diuulgyng and spredyng, or by any other means, divise, or
tokens, whatsoever the same shall happen to be, call, gather assemble, congregat
and muster, or attempt and practice to gather, assemble congregate and muster,
any number of people whatsoever they be, either to pluck down any Hedge,
Pale, fence, Wall, or any manner of enclosure, or to hunte, waste, spoil,
desolate or deface any Park, Chase, Warren, House, Lodge, Pondes, waters, or
any other unlawful act, which is forbidden, or to redress any thing, which
shall and may be, by the force of the kings majesty's Commission, reformed,
redressed, and amended, upon pain of death, presently to be suffered and
executed, by the authority and order of Law Marciall, wherein no delay or
differryng of time, shall be permitted or suffered, as in other cases, being in
deed of less importance, it is accustomed: and therefore, his majesty most
straightly charge and commands, al manner his Sherifes, Justices,
ministers, and officers, upon the knowledge of any offender, against the tenor
of this Proclamacion, furthwith with all expedition, and with such power, as
there to shall be requisite, to apprehende and attache, the same offender, and him
to commit, to a saffe Jail, and thereupon indelaied, to certify the lord
protector, and the rest of the counsel, or any of them, to the intent most
spedy order may be given, for the execucion of the offender, with such have
and expedicion, as is above mentioned.

The.xxij. day of July. A Proclamacion, for the office of Constables.
WHere as emo^ges other ancient officers and ministers, of old time
established with in this Realm, for the conseruacion of peace and good order,
the office of a Bailife, Constable, or Hedborough, within the limits of their
charge and iurisdiccions, was most pollitiquely ordained, as well to be the
stay in every city, town, or village of quiet and peace, according to the
kings majesty's laws, as also to put in execucion, whatsoever by thesaied
laws, or by the higher ministers of the same, should be appoyncted and
limited, contrary to which the purpose of the execcio^ of thesaid offices, his
highness knows that in most places, whereof late this unnatural stir and
commocion, has been emonges his Majesty's subjects, the como^s, either the
Bailifes, co^stables or Hedboroughes, whose bounden duty and office it had
been, to have most earnestly travailed, and employed themselves for the
pacifiyng and stay of their neighbors, by showing them the dangers and
perilous sequel, of such heddy and disobedient attemptates, and apprehencio^
of the sowers and spreders of leude tales, and rumors, stirryng them to riote:
Have nevertheless, been the very Kyngleaders and procureres, by their example
and exhortacion, to the rest of their neighbors, to leuy theimselfes, and have
themselfes levied then in his majesty's name, abusyng the authority of
the same, contrary to their duty of allegiau^ce, to the great displeasure of
God, and his Majesty, the destruction of themselfes, and the great damage and
peril of the whole Realm. To the end therefore, that this so notable an
allurement, and prouocacion to disorder, may from hencefurthe, by terror of
punishment be redressed: the Kings Majesty, with the advice and assent, of
his dear and most entierly beloved uncle, the lord Protector, and the rest
of his highness privy Counsel, charge and enioyneth, to every Bailife,
Constable and Hedborough, now being, and that hereafter shall be, that they
forbear and abstain, from the raisyng or assemblyng of any of his highness
subjects, for any act or purpose, other then such, as by the laws and
statutes of this realm, is limited for them to execute and do, as incide^t
to their offices, and other then such, as the Shirief of the County, where
they are Bailief, Constable, or Hedborough, or the Justices or Justice of
Peace, for the same County, or other his Majesty's higher ministers, having
authority from his majesty, shall in his highness name direct and address
them unto, upon pain that whatsoever Bailief, Constable, or hedborough, shall
from hencefurthe offe^de against this Proclamacion, and shall by his exemple or
inducement, allure others to be his folowers and accessaries, in any unlawful
assemble, for any sedicious procedynges, tendyng to tumult and rebellion, or
shall procure any harneis, weapons, or victualles, for them, shall be demed,
accepted and taken as a Traitor, and suffer loss of life, lands and goods
for ever, with like penalties, as to cases of treason is reserved.

of his highness privy counsall, straightly charge and commands, al and
every his majesty's subjects, of what soever state, order, or degree they be,

For as much as of late years, thesaid commodities, have not only been

those commodities, which ought specially to serve the turn, and be employed
to the use and sustentacion of the subjects here inhabityng, are in ouerlarge
manner co^ueighed into forain regions, as well by color of licenses, unlawfully

or granted) until hereafter upon further respects it shall please his
majesty to enlarge the same nor that by force of any other grant, allegacion,
color, pretense or means any person or persons, attempt or procure, from
hencefurthe to ship or transporte into forain parts, any kind or sort of the
aforesaid victualles, Corn, Bear, wolles, Felles, wodd, Cole, Lether, Hides,
Belmettall, or Tallowe, upon pain, that whosoever shall do, to the contrary
hereof, shall not only therefore, besides the penalties expressed in the
Statutes, restrainyng the transportacion of the same, incur the loss and
forfaicture of thesaied things, or any of them so shipped, contrary to this
restraint, the one half to be immediately confisqued, to his highness Cofers,
and the other half to the prese^tor of the same, into his graces court of the
Exchequer, and like wise the ship or other vessel, wherein any of thesaid
things prohibited, shall hereafter be shipped, to be forfaicted to his highness
but also that thesaid principal offe^dor, or offenders, and as many as shall be
aidyng, and co^sentyng to the shippyng and conueighaunce, of any of the
aforsaied things prohibited, shall suffer imprisonment, and fine at the Kings
Majesty's pleasure. And that it shall be lawful, to every of his highness
Subjects, or others, to present and pursue the accion, against any such
principal offendour or offenders, at any time within the space of three
