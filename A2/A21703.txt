AFter that I had accomplysshed and fynysshed diverse hystoryes as well of
contemplacyon as of other hystoryal and worldly acts of great conquerours and
princes / And also certain books of ensaumples and doctrine / Many noble and
diverse gentylmen of this royame of England camen and demanded me many and
oftymes / wherefore that I have not do made and enprynte the noble hystorye of
the saint greal / and of the most renomed christian king / First and chyef of
the three best christian and worthy / king Arthur / which ought most to be
remembered emonge us english men tofore al other christian kings / For it is
notoyrly known thorugh the universal world / that there been ix worthy and the
best that ever were / That is to wete three paynyms / three Jews and three
christian men / As for the paynyms they were tofore the Incarnacyon of Christ /
which were named / the first Hector of Troy / of whom thystorye is comen
both in balade and in prose / The second Alysaunder the great / and the third
Iulyus Cezar Emperor of Rome of whom thystoryes ben well kno and had / And as
for the three Jews which also were tofore thyncarnacyon of our lord of whom
the first was Duc Iosue which brought the children of Israhel in to the land
of byheste / The second Dauyd king of Iherusalem / and the third Judas
Machabeus of these three the bible reherceth al their noble hystoryes and acts
/ And sithe the said Incarnacyon have been three noble christian men stalled and
admytted thorugh the universal world in to the nombre of the ix best and
worthy / of whom was first the noble Arthur / whose noble acts I purpose to
write in this present book here following / The second was Charlemayn or Charles
the great / of whom thystorye is had in many places both in frensshe and
english / and the third and last was Godefray of boloyn / of whose acts and
life I made a book unto thexcellent prince and king of noble memory king Edward
the fourth / the said noble Ientylmen Instantly required me temprynte thystorye
of the said noble king and conqueror king Arthur / and of his knights with
thystorye of the saint greal / and of the death and endyng of the said Arthur /
Affermyng that I ou rather tenprynte his acts and noble feats / than of
godefroye of boloyne / or any of the other eight / consyderyng that he was a
man borne within this royame and king and Emperor of the same / And that there
ben in frensshe diverse and many noble volumes of his acts / and also of his
knights / To whom I answered / that diverse men hold oppynyon / that there was
no such Arthur / and that all such books as been maad of him / ben but
feigned and fables / by cause that sum chronicles make of him no mencyon ne
remember him no thing ne of his knights / whereto they answered / and one in
specyal said / that in him that should say or think / that there was never
such a king called Arthur / might well be aretted great folly and blyndenesse /
For he said that there were many euydences of the contrary / First ye may see
his sepulture in the monasterye of Glastyngburye / And also in polycronycon in
the v book the syxte chappytre / and in the seventh book the xxiij chappytre /
where his body was buried and after founden and translated in to the said
monasterye / ye shall se also in thystorye of bochas in his book de casu
principum / part of his noble acts / and also of his fall / Also galfrydus
in his brutysshe book recounteth his life / and in diverse places of England /
many remembraunces ben yet of him and shall remain perpetuelly / and also of
his knights / First in the abbey of westmestre at saint Edwardes shryne
remains the prynte of his seal in reed wax closed in beryll / In which is
wryton Patricius Arthurus / Britannie / Gallie / Germany / dacie / Imperator /
Item in the castle of dover ye may see Gauwayns skulle / and Cradoks mantel. At
wynchester the round table / in other places Launcelottes sword and many
other things / Then al these things considered there can no man resonably
gaynsaye but there was a king of this land named Arthur / For in all places
christian and hethen he is reputed and taken for one of the ix worthy / And the
first of the three Christian men / And also he is more spoken of beyond the sea
moo boookes made of his noble acts than there be in england as well in duche
ytalyen spaynysshe and grekysshe as in frensshe / And yet of record remain in
witness of him in wales in the town of Camelot the great stones and
meruayllous werkys of iron lyeng under the ground and ryal vautes which diverse
now living has seen / wherefore it is a meruayl why he is no more renomed in his
own contreye / sauf only it accords to the word of god / which says that
no man is accept for a prophet in his own contreye / Then al these things
foresaid aledged I could not well deny / but that there was such a noble king
named arthur / and reputed one of the ix worthy / and first and chyef of the
christian men / and many noble volumes be made of him and of his noble knytes in
frensshe which I have seen and read beyond the sea / which been not had in
our maternal tongue / but in walsshe ben many and also in frensshe / and sum
in english but no where nygh all / wherefore such as have late ben drawn
out bryefly in to english / I have after the simple connyng that god has
sent to me / under the favor and correctyon of al noble lords and gentylmen
enprysed to enprynte a book of the noble hystoryes of the said king Arthur /
and of certain of his knights after a copye unto me delyuerd / which copye
Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of frensshe and reduced it
in to English / And I according to my copye have done set it in enprynte /
to the entente that noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chyualrye /
the Ientyl and virtuous deeds that sum knights used in tho days / by which
they came to honor / and how they that were vycious were punysshed and often
put to shame and rebuke / humbly bysechyng al noble lords and ladies with al
other estates of what estate or degree they been of / that shall see and read in
this said book and work / that they take the good and honest acts in their
remembrance / and to follow the same / wherein they shall find many Joyous
and playsaunt hystoryes / and noble and renomed acts of humanyte / gentylnesse
and chyualryes / For herein may be seen noble chyualrye / Curtosye / Humanyte
frendlynesse / hardynesse / love / frendshyp / Cowardyse / Murdre / hate /
virtue / and sin / Do after the good and leave the evil / and it shall bring
you to good fame and renommee / And for to pass the time this boook shall be
plesaunte to read in / but for to give faith and believe that al is true that
is contained herin / ye be at your lyberte / but al is wryton for our doctrine
/ and for to beware that we fall not to vice no sin / but texcersyse and
follow virtue / by which we may come and atteyne to good fame and renomme in
this life / and after this short and transytorye life to come unto everlasting
bliss in heaven / the which he grant us that reygneth in heaven the blessed
Trynyte Amen /

Capitulum primum
HIt befell in the days of Other pendragon when he was king of all England /
and so reigned that there was a myty duke in Cornewaill that held war against
him long time / And the duke was called the duke of Tyntagil / and so by means
king Other send for this duk / chargyng him to bring his wife with him / for
she was called a fair lady / and a passing wise / and her name was called
Igrayne / So when the duke and his wife were common unto the king by the means
of great lords they were accorded both / the king lyked and loved this lady
well / and he made them great chere out of mesure / and desired to have lain by
her / But she was a passing good woman / and would not assente unto the king /
And then she told the duke her husband and said I suppose that we were sent
for that I should be dishonored Wherefore husband I counceille you that we
depart from hens suddenly that we may ride all night unto our own castle /
and in like wise as she said so they departed / that neither the king nor
none of his counceill were ware of their departing Also soon as king Other
knew of their departing so suddenly / he was wonderly wroth / Then he
called to him his pryuy counceille / and told them of the sodeyne departing of
the duke and his wife /

Then they auysed the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great
charge / And if he Will not come at your somo^s / then may ye do your best /
then have ye cause to make mighty werre upon him / So that was done and the
messagers had their ansuers / And that was this shortly / that neither he nor
his wife would not come at him / Then was the king wonderly wroth / And then
the king sent him plain word again / and badde him be ready and stuff him
and garnysshe him / for within xl days he would fetch him out of the byggest
castle that he has /

When the duke had this warning / anon he went and furnysshed and
garnysshed two strong Castles of his of the which the one hight Tyntagil /
and the other castle hit Terrabyl / So his wife Dame Igrayne he put in the
castle of Tyntagil / And him self he put in the castle of Terrabyl the
which had many yssues and posternes out / Then in all haste came Other with
a great host / and leyd a syege about the castle of Terrabil / And there he
pyght many pauelyons / and there was great war made on both party and / and
much people slain / Then for pure anger and for great love of fair Igrayne
the king Other fell seek / So came to the king Other Sire Vlfius a noble
knight / and asked the king why he was seek / I shall tell the said the king
/ I am seek for anger and for love of fair Igrayne that I may not be hool /
well my lord said Sire Vlfius / I shall seek Merlyn / and he shall do you remedy
that your heart shall be pleasyd / So vlfius departed / and by adventure he
met Merlyn in a beggars array / and there Merlyn asked Vlfius whom he sought
/ and he said he had lytyl ado to tell him / Well said Merlyn / I know whom
thou sekest / for thou sekest Merlyn / therefore seek no ferther / for I am he /
and if king Other will well reward me / and be sworn unto me to fulfille my
desire that shall be his honor and profit more tha^ mine for I shall cause
him to have all his desire / All this will I undertake said Vlfius that there
shall be nothing reasonable / but thou shall have thy desire / well said Merlyn
/ he shall have his entente and desire / And therefore said Merlyn / ride on
your wey / for I will not be long behind

Capitulum Secundum
Then Vlfius was glad and rode on more than a paas till that he came to king
Vtherpendragon / and told him he had met with Merlyn / where is he said the
king sir said Vlfius he will not dwell long / there with all Vlfius was ware
where Merlyn stood at the porche of the pauelions door / And then Merlyn was
bound to come to the king when king Other saw him he said he was welcome /
sir said Merlyn I know al your heart every dele / so ye will be sworn unto me as
ye be a true king enoynted to fulfille my desire ye shall have your desire /
then the king was sworn upon the iiij euua^gelistes / Sire said Merlyn this
is my desire / the first nyt yt ye shall lie by Igrayne ye shall get a child on
her and when that is borne that it shall be delyuerd to me for to nourisshe
there as I will have it / for it shall be your worship / and the childis
auaille as mykel as the child is worth / I will well said the king as thou
wilt have it / Now make you ready said Merlyn this night ye shall lie with
Igrayne in the castle of Tyntigayll / and ye shall be like the duke her
husband Vlfyus shall be like Sire Brastias / a knight of the dukes And I will
be like a knight that hyghte Sir Iordanus a knight of the dukes / But wait
ye make not many questions with her nor her men / but say ye are diseased and
so hye you to led / and rise not on the morn till I come to you / for the
castle of Tyntygaill is but x mile hens / so this was done as they devised /
But the duke of Tyntigail aspyed hou the king rode fro the syege of tarabil /
and therefore that night he issued out of the castle at a posterne for to have
distressid the kings hooste / And so through his own issue the duke him self
was slain or ever the king came at the castle of Tyntigail / so after the death
of the duke king Other lay with Igrayne more than three hours after his death /
and begat on her that nyg arthur / and or day came Merlyn ca^ to the king / and
had him make him ready / and so he kissed the lady Igrayne and departed in all
have / But when the lady herd tell of the duke her husband and by all record
he was deed or ever king Other came to her then she merueilled who that
might be that lay with her in lykenes of her lord / so she mourned pryuely
and held her pees / Then all the barons by one assent prayed the King of
accord betwixe the lady Igrayne and him / the king gaf hem leave / for feign
would he have hen acoorded with her / So the king put all the trust in Vlfyus
to entrete bitwene them so by the entrete at the last the king and she met to
gyder / Now will we do well said Vlfyus / our king is a lusty knight and
wyueles / and my lady Igrayne is a passing fair lady / it were great joy unto
us all and hit might please the king to make her his queen / unto that they
all well acoordd and meued it to the king / And anon like a lusty knight /
he assentid thereto with good will / and so in all haste they were married in a
morning with great myrthe and Joy / And King Lot of Lowthean and of Orkenay
then wedded Margawse that was Gaweyns mother / And king Nentres of the land
of Garlot wedded Elayne / All this was done at the request of king Other / And
the third sister morgan ^efey was put to soole in a nonnery / And there she
learned so much that she was a great Clerk of Nygromancye / And after she was
wedded to king Vryens of the land of Gore that was Sire Ewayns le blaunche
maynys fader /

Capitulum tercium
Then queen Igrayne waxid daily gretter and gretter / so it befell after
within half a year as king Other lay by his queen he asked her by the seith she
out to him whose was the child within her body / then was she sore abashed to
give ansuer / Desmaye you not said the king but tell me the truth / and I
shall love you the better by the feythe of my body Sire said she I shall
tell you the truth / the same night yt my lord was deed the hour of his
death as his knytes record there came in to my castle of Tyntigaill a man like my
lord in speech and in countenance / and two knights with him in lykenes of
his two knights barcias and Iordans / and so I went unto led with him as I
out to do with my lord / and the same night as I shall ansuer unto god this
child was begoten upon me / that is truth said the king as ye say / for it
was I my self that came in the likeness / and therefore desmay you not for I am
fader to the child / and there he told her all the cause / how it was by
Merlyns counceil / then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the
fader of her child / Sone come merlyn unto the king / and said sir ye must
puruey you / for the nourisshyng of your child / as thou wolt said the king be
it / well said Merlyn I know a lord of yours in this land that is a passing
true man and a feithful / and he shall have the nourysshyng of your child / and
his name is sir Ector / and he is a lord of fair lyuelode in many parties in
England and walys / and this lord sir ector let him be sent for / for to come
and speak with you / and desire him your self as he loves you that he will put
his own child to nourisshynge to another woman / and that his wife nourisshe
yours / And when the child is borne let it be delyuerd to me at yo^der pryuy
posterne vncrystned / So like as Merlyn devised it was done / And when sire
Ector was come / he made fyau^ce to the king for to nourisshe the child like as
the King desired / and there the king granted sir ector great rewardys /
Then when the lady was delyuerd the king commanded ij knights and ij
ladies to take the child bound in a cloth of gold / and that ye deliver him to
what pour man ye mete at the posterne yate of the castle / So the child was
delyuerd unto Merlyn / and so he bare it forth unto Sire Ector / and made an
holy man to christian him / and named him Arthur / and so sir Ectors wife
nourysshed him with her own pappe / Then within two years king Other fell
seek of a great maladye / And in the mean while his enemies Vsurpped upon him
/ and did a great bataylle upon his men / and slew many of his people / Sir
said Merlyn ye may not lie so as ye do / for ye must to the feld though ye
ride on an horse lyttar / for ye shall never have the better of your enemies /
but if your person be there / and then shall ye have the vyctory So it was
done as Merlyn had devised / and they carried the king forth in an horse lyttar
with a great hooste toward his enemies / And at saint Al^ons there met with
the king a great host of the north / And that day Sire Vlfyus and sir Bracias
did great deeds of arms / and king Vthers men overcome the northeryn bataylle
and slew many people and putt the remenaunt to flight / And then the king
returned unto london and made great joy of his vyctory / And then he fill
passing sore seek / so that three days and three nyghtes he was specheles /
wherefore all the barons made great sorrow and asked Merlyn what counceill were
best / There nys none other remedy said Merlyn but god will have his will /
But look ye al Barons be before king Other to morn / and god and I shall
make him to speak / So on the morn all the Barons with merlyn came to fore
the king / then Merlyn said aloud unto king Other / Sire shall your sone
Arthur be king after your days of this realm with all the appertenaunce /
then Vtherpend^agon turned him and said in herynge of them all I give him
gods blissyng and mine / and bid him pray for my soul / and righteuously and
worshipfully that he claim ye croune upon forfeture of my blessyng / and
therewith he yield up the ghost and then was he enterid as longed to a king /
wherefore the queen fair Igrayne made great sorrow and all the Barons / Then
stood the reame in great ieopardy long while / for every lord that was mighty
of men maade him strong / and many wend to have been king / Then Merlyn
went to the archebisshop of Caunterbury / and counceilled him for to send for
all the lords of the reame / and all the gentilmen of arms that they should
to london come by Cristmas upon pain of cursynge / And for this cause yt Ihu
that was borne on that night that he would of his great mercy show some
miracle / as he was come to be king of mankind for to show sum miracle who
should be rightwys king of this reame / So the Archebisshop by the aduys of
Merlyn send for all the lords and gentilmen of arms that they should come by
crystmasse even unto london / And many of hem made hem clean of her life that
her prayer might be the more acceptable unto god / So in the grettest chirch
of london whether it were Powlis or not the Frensshe book makes no mencyon /
all the estates were long or day in the church for to pray / And when
matyns and the first mass was done / there was seen in the chircheyard against
the hyhe altar a great stone four square like unto a marbel stone / And in
mids thereof was like an Anuylde of stele a foot on high / and theryn stack a
fair swerd naked by the point / and letters / there were written in gold about
the swerd that saiden thus / who so pulls out this swerd of this stone and
anuyld / is rightwys king borne of all Enlond / Then the people merueilled
and told it to the Archebisshop I command said tharchebisshop that ye keep you
within your church / and pray unto god still that no man touch the suerd till
the hyhe mass be all done / So when all masses were done all the lords went
to behold the stone and the swerd / And when they saw the scripture / some
assayed such as would have been king / But none might stere the swerd nor meue
hit He is not here said the Archebisshop that shall encheue the swerd but
doubt not god will make him known / But this is my counceill said the
archebisshop / that we let puruey x knytes men of good fame / and they to keep
this swerd / so it was ordeydeyned / and then there was made a cry / yt every
man should assay yt Would for to win the swerd / And upon new yeersday the
barons let maake a Iustes and a tournement / that all knytes shat would Just
or tourneye / there myt play / and all this was ordained for to keep the
lords to gyders and the comyns / for the Archebisshop trusted / that god would
make him know that should win the swerd / So upon new yeresday when the
service was done / the barons rode unto the feld / some to Just / and some to
torney / and so it happed that sire Ector that had great lyuelode about london
rode unto the Iustes / and with him rode sir kaynus his sone and young Arthur
that was his nourisshed brother / and sir kay was made knyt at al halowmas before
So as they rode to ye Iustes ward / sir kay had lost his suerd for he had left
it at his faders lodgyng / and so he prayed young Arthur for to ride for his
swerd / I will well said Arthur / and rode fast after yt swerd / and when he came
home / the lady and al were out to see the Ioustyng / then was Arthur wroth
and said to him self / I will ride to the chircheyard / and take the swerd
with me that stycketh in the stone / for my brother sir kay shall not be without
a swerd this day / so when he came to the chircheyard sir Arthur alit and tayed
his horse to the style / and so he went to the tent / and found no knytes there
/ for they were at Iustyng and so he handled the swerd by the handels / and
litly and fiersly pulled it out of the stone / and took his horse and rode his
way until he came to his brother sir kay / and delyuerd him the swerd / and as soon as sir kay saw the swerd he wist well it was the swerd of the stone / and
so he rode to his fader sir Ector / and said / sire / loo here is the swerd of
the stone / wherefore I must be king of this land / when sire Ector beheld the
swerd / he returned again and came to the church / and there they alite al
three / and went in to the church / And anon he made sir kay to swear upon a
book / how he came to that swerd / Sir said sir kay by my brother Arthur for he
brought it to me / how gate ye this swerd said sir Ector to Arthur / sir I will
tell you when I came home for my broders swerd / I fond no body at home to
deliver me his swerd And so I thought my brother sir kay should not be swerdles
and so I came hyder egerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain /
found ye any knytes about this swerd seid sir ector Nay said Arthur / Now said
sir Ector to Arthur I understand ye must be king of this land / wherefore I /
said Arthur and for what cause / Sire said Ector / for god will have hit so
for there should never man have drawn out this sword / but he that shall be
rightwys king of this land / Now let me see whether ye can put the swerd
there as it was / and pulle hit out again / that is no maystry said Arthur /
and so he put it in the stone / therewith all Sir Ector assayed to pulle out
the swerd and faylled

Capitulum sextum
NOw assay said Sire Ector unto Sire kay / And anon he pulled at the swerd with
all his might / but it would not be / Now shall ye assay said Sire Ector to
Arthur I will well said Arthur and pulled it out easily / And ^her with all
Sire Ector knelyd down to the earth and Sire Kay / Allas said Arthur mine own
dear fader and brother why knole ye to me / Nay nay my lord Arthur / it is not
so I was never your fader nor of your blood / but I wot well ye are of an hyher
blood than I wend ye were / And then Sire Ector told him all how he was
bitaken him for to nourisshe him And by whoos commandment / and by Merlyns
delyuerau^ce Then Arthur made great doole when he understood that Sire Ector
was not his fader / Sir said Ector unto Arthur woll ye be my good and gracious
lord when ye are king / else were I to blame said arthur for ye are the man in
the world that I am most be holdyng to / and my good lady and mother your wife
that as well as her own has fostred me and kept / And if ever hit be gods
will that I be king as ye say / ye shall desire of me what I may do / and I
shall not faille you / god forbede I should faille you / Sir said Sire Ector /
I will ask no more of you / but that ye will make my sone your foster brother
Sire Kay Seu^^all of all your lands / That shall be done said Arthur / and
more by the feith of my body that never man shall have that office but he
while he and I ly^e / There with all they went unto the Archebisshop / and
told him how the swerd was encheued / and by whom / and on twelfth day all
the barons came thither / and to assay to take the swerd who that would assay /
But there before hem all there might none take it out but Arthur / wherefore there
were many lords wroth And said it was great shame unto them all and the reame
to be over gouernyd with a boy of no high blood borne / and so they fell out
at that time that it was put of till Candelmas / And then all the barons
should mete there again / but alwey the x knights were ordained to watch the
swerd day and nyt / and so they set a pauelione over the stone and ye swerd
and five always watched / So at Candalmasse many moo great lords came thither
for to have won the sword / but there might none preuaille / And right as
Arthur did at Cristmasse / he did at Candelmasse and pulled out the sword
easily whereof the Barons were sore agreued and put it of in delay till the
high feste of Eester / And as Arthur sped before / so did he at Eester / yet
there were some of the great lords had indignacion that Arthur should be king
/ and put it of in a delay till the feast of Pentecoste / Then the
Archebisshop of Caunterbury by Merlyns prouydence let purueye then of the
best knights that they might get / And such knights as Vtherpendragon
loved best and most trusted in his days / And such knights were put about
Arthur as sir Bawdewyn of Bretayn / sire kaynes / sire Vlfyus / sire barsias /
All these with many other were alweyes about Arthur day and night till the
feste of Pentecost

Capitulum sextimum
ANd at the feste of pentecost all manner of men assayed to pulle at the sword
that would assay / but none might preuaille but Arthur / and pulled it out
before all the lords and comyns that were there / wherefore all the comyns
cried at ones we will have Arthur unto our king we will put him no more in
delay / for we all see that it is gods will that he shall be our king /
And who that holds against it we will slay him / And therewith all they
knelyd at ones both rich and pour / and cried Arthur mercy by cause they had
delayed him so long / and Arthur foryaf hem / and took the swerd bitwene both
his hands / and offered it upon the altar where the Archebisshop was / and so
was he made knight of the best man that was there / And so anon was the
coronacyon made / And there was he sworn unto his lords and the comyns for to
be a true king to stand with true Justice fro thens forth the days of this life
/ Also then he made all lords that held of the croune to come in / and to
do service as they ought to do / And many complayntes were made unto sir
Arthur of great wrongs that were done syn the death of king Other / of many
lands that were hereued lords knights / ladies and gentilmen / wherefore king
Arthur maade the lands to be yeuen again unto them that ought hem / when
this was done that the king had stablisshed all the countries about london /
then he let make Sir kay sencial of England / and sir Baudewyn of Bretayne
was made Constable / and sir Vlfyus was made chamberlayn / And sire Brastias
was maade wardeyn to wait upon the north fro Trent forwards for it was ye
time yt most party the kings enemies / But within few years after Arthur wan
all the north scotland / and all that were under their obeissannce / Also
walys a part of it held against Arthur / but he ouercam hem al as he did the
remenaunt through the noble prowess of him self and his knights of the round
table

Capitulum octauum
Then the king remeued in to walys / and let cry a great feste that it
should be holdyn at Pentecost after the incoronacion of him at the Cite of
Carlyon / unto the fest come king Lot of Lowthean / and of Orkeney / with five
C knytes with him / Also there come to the feste king Vryens of gore with four
C knytes with him Also there come to that feeste king Nayntres of garloth with
seven C knights with him / Also there came to the feast the king of Scotland
with six honderd knights with him / and he was but a young man / Also there
came to the feste a king that was called the king with the honderd knights /
but he and his men were passing well bisene at al points Also there came the king
of Cardos with five honderd knights / And king Arthur was glad of their
coming / for he wend that all the kings and knights had come for great love
/ and to have done him worship at his feste / wherefore the king made great joy
/ and sent the kings and knights great presents / But the kings would none
receive / but rebuked the messagers shamefully / and said they had no joy to
receive no yeftes of a berdles boy that was come of low blood / and sent him
word / they would none of his yeftes / But that they were come to give him
yeftes with hard swerdys betwixt the neck and the sholders / And therefore they
came thither / so they told to the messagers plainly / for it was great shame to
all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a reaume as this land
was / with this ansuer the messagers departed and told to king Arthur this
ansuer / wherefore by the aduys of his barons he took him to a strong tower with
/ v / C good men with him / And all the kings before said in a manner leyd a
syege tofore him / but king Arthur was well vytailled / And with in xv days
there came Merlyn among hem in to the Cite of Carlyon / then all the kings
were passing glad of Merlyn / and asked him for what cause is that boy
Arthur made your king / Syres said Merlyn / I shall tell you the cause for
he is king Vtherpendragons sone borne in wedlok gotten on Igrayne the dukes wife
of Tyntigail / then is he a bastard they said al / nay said Merlyn / After
the death of the duke more than three hours was Arthur begoten / And xiij days
after king Other wedded Igrayne / And therefore I preue him he is no bastard /
And who says nay / he shall be king and overcome all his enemies / And or he
deye / he shall be long king of all England / and have under his obeyssaunce
walys / yrland and Scotland / and moo reames than I will now reherce / Some of
the kings had merueyl of Merlyns words and demed well that it should be as he
said / And some of hem lough him to scorn / as king Lot / and mo other called
him a wytche / But then were they accorded with Merlyn that king Arthur
should come out and speak with the kings / and to come sauf and to goo sauf /
such suraunce there was made / So Merlyn went unto king Arthur / and told him
how he had done / and badde him fere not but come out boldly and speak with
hem / and spare hem not / but ansuere them as their king and chyuetayn / for
ye shall overcome hem all whether they will or nylle /

Then king Arthur came out of his tour / and had under his gown a
Iesseraunte of double maylle / and there went with him the Archebisshop of
Caunterbury / and sir Baudewyn of Bretayne and sir kay / and sire Brastias /
these were the men of most worship that were with him / And when they were
met / there was no mekenes but stout words on both sides / but alweyes
king Arthur ansuerd them and said / he would make them to bow and he lived
wherefore they departed with wrath / and king Arthur badde keep hem well / and
they bad the king keep him well / So the king retornyd him to the toure
again and armed him and all his knytes / what will ye do said Merlyn to the
kings ye were better for to stynte / for ye shall not here preuaille though
ye were x so many / be we well auysed to be aferd of a dreme reder said king Lot
/ with that Merlyn vanysshed aweye / and came to King Arthur / and bad him set
on hem fiersly / and in the mean while there were three honderd good men of the
best that were with the kings / that went streyghte unto king Arthur / and
that comforted him gretely / Sir said Merlyn to Arthur / fight not with the
sword that ye had by miracle / til that ye see ye go unto the wers / then
draw it out and do your best / So forth with all king Arthur set upon hem
in their lodgyng / And sire Bawdewyn sire Kay and sir Brastias slew on the
right hand and on the lift hand that it was merueylle / and alweyes King
Arthur on horsback leyd on with a swerd and did merueillous deeds of arms that
many of the kings had great joy of his deeds and hardynesse / Then King
Lot brake out on the bak side / and the king with the honderd knights and king
Carados / and set on Arthur fiersly behind him / with that Sire Arthur
turned with his knights / and smote behynd and before / and ever sir Arthur
was in the formest prees till his horse was slain underneath him / And therewith
king lot smote down king Arthur / with that his four knights received him
and set him on horsback / then he drew his swerd Excalibur / but it was so
bright in his enemies eyes / that it gaf light like xxx torchys / And therewith
he put hem on bak / and slew much people And then the comyns of Carlyon
aroos with clubbis and stauys and slew many knights / but all the kings
held them to gyders with her knights that were left on live / and so fled
and departed / And Merlyn come unto Arthur / and counceilled him to follow hem
no further

Ca / x
SO after the feste and iourneye king Arthur drew him unto london / and so
by the counceil of Merlyn the king let call his barons to cou^ceil / for
Merlyn had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him would in all haste be awroke on him and on his landys wherefore the king asked counceil at
hem al / they could no counceil give but said they were bygge enough / ye say
well said Arthur / I thank you for your good courage / but will ye all that
loves me speak with Merlyn ye know well that he has done much for me / and
he knows many things / and when he is before you / I would that ye prayed him
hertely of his best auyse / All the barone said they would pray him and desire
him / So Merlyn was sent for and fair desired of all the barons to give them
best counceil / I shall say you said Merlyn I warn you al / your enemies are
passing strong for you / and they are good men of arms as ben on live / and by
this time they have gotten to them four kings mo / and a mighty duke / and
unless that our king have more chyualry with him than he may make within ye
boundys of his own reame and he fight with hem in batail / he shall be overcome
and slain what were best to do in this cause said all the barons / I shall tell
you said Merlyn mine aduys / there are two brethren beyond the sea / and they
be kings both and merueillous good men of her hands / And that one hyghte
King Ban of Benwic And that other hight King Bors of gaul that is France And
on these two Kings warrith a mighty man of men the King Claudas / and
stryueth with hem for a castle / and great werre is betwixt them / But this
Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he geteth good Knytes that he puts
these two kings most part do the werse / wherefore this is my counceil that
our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty
knights with letters well devised / that and they will come and see king Arthur
and his court / and so help him in his warrys that he will be sworn unto them
to help them in their warrys against king Claudas / Now what say ye unto
this counceill said Merlyn / this is well counceilled said the king and all
the Barons / right so in all haste there were ordained to goo two knights on
the message unto the two kings / So were there made letters in the plesaunt
wise according unto king Arthurs desire / Vlfyus and Brastias were made the
messagers / and so rode forth well horsed and well armed / and as the gyse was
that time and so passed the sea and rode toward the cite of Benwyck / and there
besides were viij knights that aspyed them / And at a strayt passage they
met with Vlfyus and Brastias / and would have taken hem prisoners / so they
prayed hem that they might pass / for they were messagers unto king Ban and
Bors sent from king Arthur / therefore said the viij knights ye shall dye or
be prisoners / for we ben knights of king Claudas And therewith two of them
dressid their sperys / and Vlfyus and Brastias dressid their speres and ran
to gyder with great raundon / And Claudas knights brack their speres / and
there to hylde and bare the two knights out of her sadels to the earth / and so
left hem lyeng and rode her ways / And the other six knights rode before to
a passage to mete with hem again / and so Vlfyus and Brastias smote other two
down And so past on her ways / And at the fourth passage there met two for
two / and both were leid unto the earth / so there was none of the viij
knights but he was sore hurt or brysed And when they come to Benwick it
fortuned there were both kings Ban and Bors / And when it was told the kings
that there were come messagers / there were sent unto them ij knights of
worship / the one hyghte Lyonses lord of the country of payarne and Sir
phariaunce a worshipful knight Anon they asked from whens they came / and they
said from king Arthur king of England / so they took them in their arms and
made great joy each of other / But anon as the ij kings wist they were
messagers of Arthurs / there was made no taryenge / but forthwith they spak with
the knights / and welcomed hem in the feythfullest wise / and said / they were
most welcome unto them before all the kings lyuynge^ / and there with they
kyst the letters and delyuerd hem / And when Ban and Bors understood the
letters / then were they more welcome than they were before / And after the
have of the letters / they gaf hem this ansuer that they would fulfille the
desire of king Arthurs writing and Vlfyus and Brastias tarry there as long as
they would / they should have such chere as might be made them in tho marchys /
Then Vlfyus and Brastias told the king of the adventure at their passages of
the eyghte knytes / Ha A said Ban and Bors they were my good friends I would I
had wist of hem they should not have escaped so So Vlfius and Brastias had good
chere and great yeftes as much as they might bear awey / and had their
ansuere by mouth and by writing that tho two Kings would come unto Arthur in
all the have that they myte / So the two Knytes rode on a fore / and passed the sea / and come to their lord and told him how they had spedde / whereof King
Arthur was passing glad / At what time suppose ye / the ij Kings wol be here
/ Sir said they before all halowmasse / Then the king let puruey for a great
feeste / and let cry a great Iustes / And by all halowmasse the two kings
were come over the sea with three honderd knytes well arrayed both for the pees
and for the werre / And king Arthur met with hem x mile out of london / and
there was great joy as could be thout or made / And on al halowmasse at the
great feeste sat in the halle the three kings / and sire kay sencial served in
the halle And Sir lucas the bottelere that was duke Corneus sone / and sir
gryflet that was the sone of Cardol / these iij knytes had the rule of all the
seruyse that served the kings / And anon as they had wasshen and risen / al
knytes that would Just made hem ready / by than they were ready on horsbak there
were vij C knights / And Arthur Ban and Bors with the Archebisshop of
Caunterbury / and sire Ector kays fader they were in a place couerd with clothe
of gold like an halle with ladies and gentilwymmen for to behold who did best
and thereon to give Judgment

Capitulum xj
ANd king Arthur and the two Kings let depart the vij C knights in two
parties And there were iij C knights of the reame of Benwick and of gaul
turned on the other side than they dressid her sheldes / and began to couche
her speres many good knights / So Gryflet was the first that met with a
knight one ladynas and they met so egerly that al men had wonder / And they
so faughte that her sheldes fell to pyeces / and horse and man fell to the
earth / And both the frensshe knight and the English knight lay so long
that all men wend they had been deed / when lucas the botteler saw Gryflet so
lie / he horsed him again anon / and they two did merueillous deeds of arms
with many bachelors / Also sire kay came out of an enbusshement with five
knights with him / and they six smote other six down / But sir kay did that
day merueillous deeds of arms / that there was none did so well as he that day
Then there come ladynas and Grastian two knights of france / and did
passing well that all men preysed them / Then come there Sire placidas a good
knight and met with sir kay and smote him down horse and man / wherefore Sire
gryflet was wroth and met with Sire placidas so hard that horse and man
fell to the earth / But when the / v / knights wist that sir kay had a fall
they were wroth out of wit / And therewith each of them / v / bare down a
knight / when king Arthur and the two kings saw hem begin wax wroth on
both parties / they lepte on small hakeneis / and let cry that all men should
depart unto their lodging And so they went home and unarmed them and so to
even song and souper / And after the three kings went in to a gardyn / and
gaf the price unto sire kay and to lucas the bottelere / and unto Sire Gryflet
/ And then they went unto connceil / and with hem gwenbaus the brother unto
sir Ban and Bors a wise Clerk / and thither went Vlfyus and Brastias and Merlyn
/ And after they had been in counceill / they went un to bed / And on the
morn they herd mass and to dinner / and so to their counceille and made many
argumentis what were best to do / At the last they were concluded / that
Merlyn should goo with a token of king Ban and that was a ring unto his men and
king Bors and Gracian and placidas should goo again and keep their castles
and her countries / as for king Ban of Benwick and king Bors of Gauls had
ordained hem / and so passed the sea and came to Benwyck / And when the people
saw king Bans ring and gracian and placidas they were glad / and asked how
the kings ferd / and made great joy of their welfare and cordyng / and
according unto the sovereign lords desire / the men of war made hem ready in all have possible / so that they were xv M on horse and foot / and they had
great plente of vytaylle with hem by Merlyns prouysyon / But gracian and
placidas were left to furnysshe and garnysshe the castles for dread of king
Claudas / right so Merlyn passed the sea well vytailled both by water and by
land / And when he came to the sea / he sent home the foot men again and
took no mo with him / but x M men on horsbak the most part men of arms and
so shypped and passed the sea in to England / and londed at Dover / and through
the wit of Merlyn he lad the host Northward the pryuyest wey that could be
thought unto the foreist of Bedegrayne / and there in a valey he lodged hem
secretly / Then rode Merlyn unto Arthur and the two kings and told hem how
he had sped / whereof they had great merueylle / that man on earth might speed
so soon / and goo and come So Merlyn told them x M were in the forest of
Bedegrayne well armed at al points / then was there no more to say / but to
horsbak went all the host as Arthur had before purueyed / So with xx M he
passed by night and day / but there was made such an ordenau^ce before by
Merlyn that there should no man of werre ride nor go in no country on this side
trent water / but if he had a token from king Arthur / where through the kings
enemies durst not ride as they did to fore to aspye

Capitulum xij
ANd so within a little space the three kings came unto the Castle of
Bedegrayne / and fond there a passing fair felauship and well be seen / whereof
they had great joy / and vytaille they wanted none / This was the cause of the
northeren host that they were rered for the despyte and rebuke the syx kings
had at Carlyon / And tho vj kings by her means gate unto hem five other
kings / And thus they began to gadre their people And how they swear that for
well nor woo they should not leave other / till they had destroyed Arthur / and
then they made an oath The first that began the oath was the duke of
Candebenet / that he would bring with him v M men of arms the which were ready
on horsbak / Then swear king Brandegoris of stranggore that he would bring v
M men of arms on horsbak / Then swear king Claryuaus of Northumberland he
would bring three thousand men of arms / then swear the king of the C
knights that was a passing good man and a young that he would bring four
thousand men of arms on horsbak / then there swore king Lot a passing good
knyt and sire Gawayns fader that he would bring v M men of arms on horsbak /
Also there swore king Vryence that was sir Vwayns fader of the land of gore and
he would bring vj M men of arms on horsbak / Also there swore king Idres of
Cornewalle that he would bring v M men of arms on horsbak / Also there swore
king cardelmans to bring v M me^ on horsbak / Also there swore king Agwysaunce
of Irelond to bring v M men of arms on horsbak / Also there swore king ^entres
to bring v M men of arms on horsbak / Also there swore king Carados to
bring v M men of arms on horsbak / So her hool host was of clean men of
arms on horsbak fyfty thousand and a foot x thousand of good men's bodies /
then were they soon ready and mounted upon horse and sent forth their fore
rydars / for these xj kings in her ways leyd a syege unto the castle of
Bedegrayne / and so they departed and drew toward Arthur and left few to
abide at the syege for the castle of Bedegrayne was holden of king Arthur /
and the men that were theryn were Arthurs

Capitulum xiij
So by Merlyns aduys there were sent fore rydars to skumme the Countreye / and
they met with the fore rydars of the north / and made hem to tell which wey
the hooste came / and then they told it to Arthur / and by king Ban and Bors
counceill they let brenne and destroy all the country before them there they
should ride / The king with the honderd knights met a wonder dreme two
nyghtes a fore the bataille / that there blewe a great wind and blewe down her
castles and her towns / and after that came a water and bare hit all awey /
All that herd of the sweuen said / it was a token of great battle / Then by
counceill of Merlyn when they wist which wey the xj kings would ride and lodge
that night At mydnyght they set upon them as they were in their pauelyons /
But the scoute watch by her host cried lords at arms for here be your
enemies at your hand

Capitulum xiiij
Then king Arthur and king Ban and King Bors with her good and trusty
knights set on hem so fyersly that he made them over throw her pauelions on
her hedys / but the xj kings by manly prowess of arms took a fair
champayne / but there was slain that morrow tide x M good mennys bodies / And
so they had before hem a strong passage yet were they fyfty M of hardy men /
Then it drew toward day / now shall ye do by mine aduys said Merlyn unto
the three kings I would that king Ban and king Bors with her felauship of x M
men were put in a wood here beside in an enbusshement and keep them preuy / and
that they be leid or the light of the day come / and that they stere not till
ye and your knights have fought with hem long And when hit is day light
dress your bataille even before them and the passage that they may see all
your hooste / For then will they be the more hardy when they see you but
about xx M / and cause hem to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to
come over the passage / All the three kings and the hoole barons said that
Merlyn said passyngly well / and it was done anon as Merlyn had devised / So
on the mo^n when either host saw other / the host of the north was well
comforted / Then to Vlfyus and Brastias were delyuerd three thousand men of
arms / and they set on them fyersly in the passage / and slew on the right
hand and on the lift hand that it was wonder to tell /

When that the enleuen kings saw that there was so few a felauship did
such deeds of arms they were ashamed and set on hem again fyersly / and
there was sir Vlfyus horse slain under him / but he did merueyllously well on
foot / But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King Claryaunce of Northumberland
/ were alweye grievous on Vlfyus / then Brastias saw his felawe ferd so with all / he smote the duke with a spear that horse and man fell down / that saw
king Claryaunce and returned unto Brastias / and either smote other so that
horse and man went to the earth / and so they lay long astonyed / and their
horse knees brast to the hard bone / Then came Sir kay the sencyal with six
felawes with him / and did passing well / with that came the xj kings / and there
was Gryflot put to the earth horse and man and lucas the bottelere horse and man
by king Brandegorys and king Idres and king Agwysaunce / then waxed the
meddle passing hard on both parties / when sire kay saw Gryflet on foot / he
rode on king Nentres and smote him down and lad his horse unto sir gryflet and
horsed him again / Also sir kay with the same spear smote down king Lot / and
hurt him passing sore / that saw the king with the C knytes and ran unto sir
kay and smote him down and took his horse / and gaf him king Lot whereof he
said gramercy / when sir Gryflet saw sir kay and lucas the bottelere on foot
/ he took a sharp spear great and square / and rode to pynel a good man of
arms / and smote horse and man down / And then he took his horse / and gaf
him unto sir kay / Then king Lot saw king Nentres on foot / he ran unto
Melot de la roche / and smote him down horse and man and gaf king Nentres the
horse and horsed him again / Also the king of the C knytes saw king Idres on
foot then he ran unto Gwymyart de bloy and smote him down horse and man and
gaf king Idres the horse and horsed him again / and king Lot smote down
Claryaunce de la foreist saueage and gaf the horse unto duke Eustace / And so
when they had horsed the kings again they drew hem al xj kings to gyder
and said they would be revenged of the dommage that they had taken that day /
The mean while came in sir Ector with an egyr countenance / and found Vlfyus
and Brastias on foot in great peril of death that were foul defoyled under
horsfeet / Then Arthur as a lion ran unto king Cradelment of North walys /
and smote him through the lift side that the horse and the king fylle down /
And then he took the horse by the rain / and ladde him unto Vlfyus and said
have this horse mine old friend / for great need have thou of horse / gramercy said
Vlfyus / then sire Arthur did so merueillously in arms that all men had
wondyr / when the king with the C knights saw king Cradelment on foot / he
ran unto sire Ector that was well horsed sir kayes fader / and smote horse and
man down / and gaf the horse unto the king / and horsed him again / and when
king Arthur saw the king ride on sir Ectors horse he was wroth and with his
swerd he smote the king on the helm / that a quarter of the helm and shield
fill down / and so the swerd carf down unto the horse neck / and so the king
and the horse fill down to the gronnd / Then sir kay came unto sir Morganore
sencial with the king of the C knights and smote him down horse and man / and
lad the horse unto his fader sire Ector / then sir Ector ran unto a knight
hyghte lardans / and smote horse and man down / and lad the horse unto sir
Brastias that great need had of an horse and was gretely defoyled / when
Brastias beheld lucas the botteler that lay like a deed man under the horse
feet / and ever sir Gry flet did merueillously for to rescowe him / and there
were alweyes xiiij knights on sir lucas / and then Brastias smote one of hem
on the helm / that it went to the treth / and he rode to another and smote
him that the arm flewe in to the feld / Then he went to the third and smote
him on the sholder that sholder and arm flewe in the feld / And when Gryflet
saw rescowes / he smote a knight on the tempils that head and helm went to
the erthel / and gryflet took the horse of that knight and lad him unto sir
lucas / and bad him mount upon the horse and revenge his hurtes / For Brastias
had slain a knight to fore and horsed gryflet /

Capitulum xv
Then lucas saw king Agwysaunce that late had slain Morys de la roche /
and lucas ran to him with a short spear that was great / that he gaf him such
a fall that the horse fell down to the earth / Also lucas found there on foot
bloyas de la flaundres and sir Gwynas ij hardy knytes and in that woodenes that
lucas was in / he slew ij bachelors and horsed hem ageyn / then waxid the
batail possyng hard on both parties / but arthur was glad yt his knytes were
horsed ayene and then they fought to gyders that the noise and sown rang by
the water and the wood / wherefore king Ban and king bors made them ready and
dressyd their sheldes and harneys / and they were so couragyous that many
Knights shoke and beuerd for egrenes / All this while lucas and Gwynas and
bryaunte and Bellyas of Flaundrys held strong meddle against vj kings / that
was King Lot / king Nentres / king Brandegorys / King Idres / king Vryens
and king Agwysaunce / So with the help of sire kay and of sir gryflet / they
held these vj kings hard that uneath they had any power to defend them But
when sir Arthur saw the batail would not be endyd by no manner / he ferd wood as
a lion / and stered his horse here and there on the right hand and on the lift
hand* that he stynte not till he had slain xx knytes / Also he wounded king Lot
sore on the sholder and made him to leave that ground / for sire kay and gryflet
did with king Arthur there great deeds of arms / Then Vlfyus and Brastias
and sir Ector encountered against the duke Eustace and king Cradelment and king
Cradelma^t and king Claryaunce of Northumberland and king Carados and against
the king with the C knytes / So these knytes encountered with these kings that
they made them to avoid the ground / then King Lot made great dool for his
dommagis and his felawes / and said unto the x kings but if ye will do as I
deuyse we shall be slain and destroyed / let me have the king with the C
Knytes and king Agwysaunce and king Idres and the duke of Canbene^ / and we v
Kings wol have xv M men of arms with us and we will go on part / wyle ye vj
Kings hold the meddle with xij M / and we see that ye have fouten with hem
long then will we come on fyersly / and else shall we never match hem said
king Lot but by this mean So they departed as they here devised / and vj
kings made her party strong against Arthur and made great war long / In the
mean while brake the enbusshement of King Ban and king bo^s and Lyonses and
Pharyaunce had the aduant guard / and they two knights met with king Idres
and his felauship / and there began a great medele of brekyng of speres and
smiting of swerdys with sleynge of men and horses / And king Idres was nere
at discomforture

That saw Agwysannce the king and put lyonses and pharyaunce in point of
death / for the duke of Canbenek came on with all with a great felauship / so
these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were fayn to
return but alweyes they rescowed hem self and their felauship merueillously /
When king Bors saw tho knights put on bak it grieved him sore / then he came
on so fast that his felauship seemed as blak as Inde / when king Lot had aspyed
king bors / he knew him well / then he said O Ihesu defend us from death and
horrible maymes / for I see well we ben in great peril of death / for I see
yonder a king one of the most worshipful lest men and one of the best knytes
of the world ben enclyned unto his felauship / what is he said the king with
the C knytes / it is said king Lot king bors of gaul^ / I merueile how they
come in to this countreye without wetynge of us all It was by Merlyns auyse
said the knight / As for him said king Carados / I will encountre with king
bors / and ye will rescowe me when myster is / go on said they al / we will do
all that we may / then king Carados and his host rode on a soft pace till
that they come as nyghe king Bors as a bow draughte / then either bataill
let their horse run as fast as they might / And Bleoberys that was godson
unto king Bors he bare his chyef standard / that was a passing good knight /
Now shall we see said king Bors hou these northeren bretons can bear the arms
/ and king Bors encountered with a knight / and smote him through out with a
spear that he fell deed unto the earth / and after drew his swerd and did
merueillous deeds of arms that all parties had great wonder thereof / and his
knytes failled not but did their part / and king Carados was smyten to the
earth / With that came the king with the C knytes and rescued king Carados
mytely by force of arms / for he was a passing good knight of a king / and
but a young man

Capitulum xvj
BY than come in to the feld king Ban as fyers as a lion with bandys of grene
/ and thereupon gold / Ha a said king Lot we must be discomfyte / for yonder I
see the most valiant knight of the world / and the man of the most renoume /
for such ij brethren as is king Ban and king bors are not living / wherefore
we must needs void or deye / And but if we avoid manly and wisely / there is
but death / when king Ban came in to the bataill / he came in so fiersly /
that the strokes redounded again fro the wood and the water / wherefore king
Lot wept for pity and doole that he saw so many good knytes take their end
/ But through the great force of king Ban they made both the Northeren
bataylles that were departed / hurtled to gyders for great dread / and the three
kings and their knights slew on ever that it was pity on to behold that
multitude of the people that fled / But king Lot and King of the honderd
knytes and king Morganore gadred the people to gyders passing knyghtly / and
did great prowess of arms / and held the bataill all that day like hard /
When the king of the honderd knights beheld the great damage that king Ban
did / he threst unto him with his horse and smote him on hyhe upon the helm a
great stroke and stonyed him sore / Then king Ban was wroth with him / and
followed on him fyersly / the other saw that / and cast up his sheld and spored
his horse forward / But the stroke of king Ban fell down and carfe a cantel
of the sheld / and the swerd s^ode down by the haulerk behind his back / and
cut through the trappere of stele / and the horse even in two pyeces that the
swerd felt the earth / Then the king of the C knights voyded the horse
lightly and with his swerd he broched the horse of king Ban through and through /
with that king Ban voyded lightly from the deed horse / and then king Ban
smote at the other so egrely / and smote him on the helm that he fell to the
earth / Also in that ire he feld king Morganore and there was great slaughter of
good knights and much people / by than come in to the prees king Arthur / and
fond King Ban stondynge among deed men and deed horse fighting on foot as a
wood lion / that there came none nyghe him as fer as he might reche with his
swerd / but he caughte a grievous buffet whereof King Arthur had great pity /
And Arthur was so blody that by his shield there might no man know him / for
all was blood and brains on his swerd / And as Arthur looked by him he saw a
knight that was passyngly well horsed / and therewith sire Arthur ran to him /
and smote him on the helm that his swerd went unto his teeth / and the knight
sanke down to the earth deed / and anon Arthur took the horse by the rain and
ladde him unto king Ban and said fair brother / have this horse / for ye have
great myster thereof and me repents sore of your great damage Hit shall be
soon reuengid said King Ban / for I trust in god mine eure is not such but
some of them may sore repent this / I wol well said Arthur / for I see your
deeds full actual Nevertheless I might not come at you at that time / But
when King Ban was mounted on horsbak / then there began new bataill the
which was sore and hard / and passing great slaughter / And so through great
force King Arthur / King Ban and King Bors made her knights a litel to
withdraw them / But alwey the xj Kings with her chyualrye never turned bak /
and so withdrewe hem to a lytil wood / and so over a lytyl river / and
therethey rested hem / for on the night they might have no rest on the feld /
And then the xj kings and knights put hem on a hepe all to gyders as men
adrad and out of all comfort / but there was no man might pass them / they
held hem so hard to gyders both behind and before that king Arthur had
merueille of their deeds of arms and was passing wroth / A sir Arthur said
king Ban and king Bors blame hem naught / For they do as good men out to
do / For by my feith said king Ban / they are the best fyghtyng men and
knights of most prowess that ever I saw or herd speak of / And tho xj
kings are men of great worship / And if they were longyng unto you / there
were no king under the heaven had such xj knights and of such worship / I
may not love hem said Arthur / they would destroy me / that wot we well said
king Ban and King Bors / for they are your mortal enemies / and that has been
preued before hand / And this day they have done their part / and that is
great pity of their wilfulnes Then all the xj kings drew hem to gyder /
And then said king Lot / lords ye must other ways than ye do / or else the
great loss is behind / ye may see what people we have lost / and what good men
we lose / by cause we waytte alweyes on these foot men / and ever in saving
of one of the foot men we lose x horsemen for him / therefore this is mine aduys
/ let us put our foot men from v^ / for it is nere night / For the noble
Arthur will not ^^ry on the foot men / for they may save hem self / the
wood is nerehand / And when we horsemen be to gyders / look eueryche of you
kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death / And who
that sees any man dress him to flee / lightly that he be slain / for it is
better that we slay a coward than through a coward all we to be slain / How
say ye said king Lot / ansuere me all ye kings / it is well said quod king
Nentres / so said the king of the honderd knights / the same said the king
Carados and king Vryence / so did king Idres and king brandegorys / and so did
king Cradulmas and the duke of Ca^debenet / the same said king Claryaunce and
king Agwysaunce and swear they would never faille other neither for life nor for
death / And who so that fled but did as they did should be slain / Then
they amended their harneys and ryghted their sheldes and took new sperys and
set hem on their thyes and stood stille as hit had been a plompe of wood /

When Sire Arthur and king ban and bors byhelde them and all her knights
they preysed hem much for their noble chere of chyualrye for the hardyest
fyghters that ever they herd or saw / with that there dressyd hem a xl noble
knights and said unto the three kings / they would break their bataille /
these were her names Lyonses / pharyaunce Vlfyus / brastias / Ector / kaynes /
lucas the bottelere / Gryflett la fyse de dieu / mariet de la roche / Gwynas de
bloy / bria^t de la foreyst saueage / bellaus / Moryans of the castle maydyn^ /
fla^nedreus of the castle of ladies / Annecians that was king bors godsone a
noble knight / ladynas de la rouse / Emerause Caulas / Gracyens le casteleyn /
one bloyse de la caase / and sire Colgreueaunce de gorre / all these knytes
rode on a fore with sperys on their thyes / and spored their horses myghtely as
the horses myte run / And the xj kings with part of her knytes russched
with their horses as fast as they myte with their spe^es / and there they did on
both parties merueillous deeds of arms / so came in to the thycke of the
prees Arthur ban and bors and slew down right on both hands that her horses
went in bloood up to the fytlokys / But ever the xj Kings and their hooste was
ever in the vysage of Arthur / wherefore Ban and Bors had great merueille
consyderyng the great slauter that there was / but at the last they were driven
abak over a lytil river / with that came Merlyn on a great black horse / and
said unto arthur thou have never done / have thou not do ne enough / of three
score thousand this day have thou left on live but xv M / and it is time to
say ho for god is wroth with the that thou wolt never have done / for yonder
xj kings at this time will not be overthrown / but and thou tarry on them any
longer / thy fortune will torn and they shall encreace / And therefore
withdraw you unto your lodgyng and rest yon as soon as ye may and reward
your good knytes with gold and with silver / for they have well deserved hi^ /
there may no richesse be to dear for them / for of so few men as ye have there
were never men did more of prowess than they have done to day / for ye have
matched this day with the best fyghters of the world / that is truth said
king Ban and bors / Also said Merlyn / withdraw you where ye list / For this
three year I dar undertake they shall not dear you / And by than ye shall here
new tidings / And then Merlyn said unto arthur / these xj kings have more
on hand than they are ware of / for the Sarasyns ar londed in their countries
mo than xl M that brenne and ^lee / and have leid syege at the castle
wandesborow and make great destruction / therefore dread you not this three year
/ Also sire all the goods that been gotten at this bataill let it be serched /
And when ye have it in your handys let it be given freely unto these two
kings Ban and Bors that they may reward their knights with all / And that
shall cause strangers to be of better will to do you seruyse at need / Also
ye be able to reward your own knights of your own goods when someuer it
lyketh you It is well said quoth Arthur And as thou have devised so shall it be done
/ when it was delyuerd to Ban and Bors they gaf the goods as freely to their
knytes as freely as it was yeuen to them / Then Merlyn took his leave of Arthur
and of the ij kings for to go and see his master Bleyse that dwelde in
Northumberland / and so he departed and came to his master that was passing
glad of his coming / and there he told / how Arthur and the two kings had
sped at the great battle / and how it was ended / and told the names of every
king and knight of worship that was there / And so Bleyse wrote the bataill
word by word as Merlyn told him how it began / and by whom / and in like wise
how it was endyd / And who had the werre / All the batails that were done in
arthurs days / merlyn did his master Bleyse do write / Also he did do write
all the batails that every worthy knight did of arthurs Court / After this
Merlyn departed from his master and came to king Arthur that was in the
castle of Bedegrayne / that was one of the castles that stondyn in the forest
of Sherewood / And Merlyn was so disguysed that king Arthur knew him not for
he was al be furred in black sheep skynnes and a great pair of boots / and a
bow and arowes in a russet gown / and brought wild gyse in his hand and it
was on the morn after candelmas day / but king Arthur knew him not / Sire
said Merlyn unto the king / will ye give me a yefte / wherefore said king Arthur
should I give the a yefte chorle / Sir said Merlyn ye were better to give me a
yefte that is not in your hand than to lose great richesse / for here in the
same place there the great bataill was is great tresour hyd in the earth / who
told the so chor^e said Arthur / Merlyn told me so said he / then Vlfyus and
Brastias knew him well enough and smyled / Sire said these two knights It is
Merlyn that so speaks unto you / then king arthur was gretely abass^ed and
had merueyll of Merlyn / and so had king Ban and king Bors / and so they had
great dysport at him / So in the mean while there came a damoysel that was an
erlys daughter his name was Sanam / and her name was Lyonors a passing fair
damoysel / and so she came thither for to dohomage as other lords did after the
great bataill / And king Arthur set his love gretely upon her and so did she
upon him / and the king had adoo with her / and gat on her a child / his name
was Borre that was after a good knight and of the table round / then there
came word that the king Ryence of Northen walys maade great werre on king
Lodegreance of camylyard / for the which thing arthur was wroth for he loved
him well and hated king Ryence / for he was alwey against him / So by ordenaunce
of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwyck / all they would depart
for dread of king Claudas and pharyaunce and Antemes and Grasians and lyonses
/ payarne with the leders of tho that should keep the kings landys

Capitulum xviij
ANd then king Arthur and king Ban and king Bors departed with her
felauship a xx M and came within vj days in to the country of Cmyliarde and
there rescowed king Lodegreaunce and s^ewe there much people of king Ryence
unto the nombre of x M men and put him to flyghte / And then had these three
kings great ^here of king Lodegreaunce / that thanked them of their great
goodness that they would revenge him of his enemies / and there had Arthur
the first sight of gweneuer the kings daughter of Camylyard / and ever after
he loved her / After they were weddyd as it tells in the book / So breuely
to make an end / they took their leave to goo in to their own Countries for
king Claudas did great destruction on their lands / Then said Arthur I
will goo with you / Nay said the kings ye shall not at this time / for ye
have much to do yet in these lands / therefore we will depart / and with
the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your yeftes we shall
wage good knights and withstand the king Claudas malice / for by the grace
of god and we have need we will send to you for your socour / And if ye have
need send for us / and we will not tarry by the feythe of our bodies / Hit
shall not said Merlyn need that these two kings come again in the wey of
werre / But I know well king Arthur may not be long from you / for within a
year or two ye shall have great need / And then shall he revenge you on
your enemies as ye have done on his / For these xj kings shall deye all in a
day by the great might and prowess of arms of ij valiant knights as it
tells after / her names ben Balyn le Saueage and Balan his brother that been
merueillous good knights as ben any living / Now torn we to the xj kings
that returned unto a cite that hyghte Sorhaute / the which cite was within
king Vryens / and there they refresshed hem as well as they might / and made
leches search their woundys and sorowed gretely for the death of her people /
with that there came a messager and told how there was comen in to their lands
people that were lau^es as well as sarasyns a xl M / and have brent and slain
all the people that they may come by without mercy / and have leyd syege on the
castle of wa^disborow / Allas said the xj kings here is sorrow upon sorou And
if we had not warryd against Arthur as we have done / he would soon revenge us
/ as for king Lodegryaunce he loves Arthur better than us / And as for king
Ryence / he has enough to do with Lodegreans / for he has leyd syege unto
him / So they consentyd to gyder to keep all the marches of Cornewayle / of
walys and of the north / so first they put king Idres in the Cite of
Nauntys in Brytayne with iiij thousand men of arms / to watch both the water
and the land / Also they put in the cite of wyndesan king Nauntres of garlott
with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on land / Also they had
of other men of werre moo than eight thousand for to fortyfye all the
fortresses in the marches of Cornewaylle / Also they put moo knytes in all the
marches of walys and scotland with many good men of arms / and so they kept
hem to gyders the space of three year And ever alyed hem with mighty kings and
dukes and lords / And to them fell king Ryence of North walys / the which
was a mighty man of men and New that was a mighty man of men / And all this
while they furnysshed hem and garnysshed hem of good men of arms and vytaille
and of all manner of abylement that pretendith to the werre to avenge hem for
the bataille of Bedegrayne / as it tells in the book of auentures following

Capitulum xix
Then after the departing of king Ban and of king Bors king Arthur rode unto
Carlyon / And thither came to him king Lots wife of Orkeney in manner of a message
/ but she was sent thither to aspye the Court of king Arthur / and she came
rychely bisene with her four sons / gawayn Gaherys / Agrauaynes / and Gareth
with many other knights and ladies / for she was a possynge fair lady /
wherefore the king cast great love unto her / and desired to lie by her / so
they were agreed / and he begat upon her Mordred / and she was his sister on
the mother side Igrayne / So there she rested her a month and at the last
departed / Then the king dremed a merueillous dreme whereof he was sore adrad
/ But all this time king Arthur knew not that king Lots wife was his sister /
Thus was the dreme of Arthur / him thought there was come in to this land
Gryffons and Serpents / And him thought they burnt and slough all the people
in the la^d And then him thought / he faughte with hem / and they did him
passing great harm / and wounded him full sore / but at the last he slew hem
/ when the king awaked / he was passing heavy of his dreme / and so to put
it out of thoughts / he made him ready with many knights to ride on hunting
/ As soon as he was in the forest / the king saw a great heart before him /
this heart will I chase said king Arthur / And so he spored the horse / and
rode after long / And so by fine force often he was like to have smyten the
heart / where as the king had chaced the heart so long that his horse had
lost his brethe and fylle down deed / Then a yoman fette the king another
horse / So the king saw the heart enbusshed and his horse deed / he set him
down by a fontayne and there he fell in great thoughts / And as he satte so
him thought he herd a noise of hounds to the sum of xxx / And with that the
king saw coming toward him the straungest best that ever he saw or herd of /
so the best went to the well and drank / and the noise was in the bestes belly
like unto the questyng of xxx coupyl hounds / but all the while the beast
drank there was no noise in the bestes belly / and therewith the best departed
with a great noise / whereof the king had great merueyll / And so he was in a
great thought / and therewith he fell on sleep / Right so there came a knight a
foot unto Arthur / and said knight full of thought and slepy / tell me if
thou saw a strange best pass this way / Such one saw I said king
Arthur / that is past two mile / what would ye with the best said arthur Sire I
have followed that best long time / and kyld mine horse / so would god I had
another to follow my quest / ryte so came one with the kings horse / and when
the knight saw the horse / he prayed the king to give him the horse / for I have
followed this quest this xij month / and other I shall encheue him or blede of
the best blood of my body / Pellinore that time king followed the questynge
best / and after his death sir Palamydes followed hit

Capitulum xx
Sir knight said the king leave that quest / and suffer me to have hit / and I
will follow it another xij month / A fool said the knight unto Arthur / it
is in vein thy desire / for it shall never ben encheued but by me / or my
next kyn / there with he sterte unto the kings horse and mounted in to the
sadel / and said gramercy this horse is mine own / well said the king thou may
take mine horse by force but and I myte preue the whether thou were better on
horsbak or I / well said the knight seek me here when thou wolt and here nygh
this well thou shall find me / and so passyd on his weye / then the king sat
in a study and bad his men fetch his horse as fast as ever they might / Right
so came by him Merlyn like a child of xiiij year of age and salewed the king /
and asked him why he was so pensyf / I may well be pensyf said the king / for I
have seen the merueyllest sit that ever I saw / that know I well said Merlyn
as well as thy self and of all thy thoughts / but thou art but a fool to take
thought / for it will not amend the / Also I know what thou art / and who
was thy fader / and of whom thou were begoten / king Vtherpendragon was thy
fader / and begat the on Igrayne / that is false said king Arthur / how sholdest
thou know it / for thou art not so old of years to know my fader / yes said
Merlyn I know it better than ye or any man living / I will not bileue the
said Arthur and was wroth with the child / So departed Merlyn and came again
in the lykenes of an old man of iiij score year of age / whereof the king was
right glad / for he seemed to be right wise Then said the old man why are ye
so sad / I may well be heavy said Arthur for many things / Also here was a
child and told me many things that me seems / he should not know / for he was
not of age to know my fader / yes said the old man / the child told you
truth / and more would he have told you and ye would have suffered him / But
ye have done a thing late that god is displeased with you / for ye have layne
by your sister / and on her ye have gotten a child / that shall destroy you
and all the knights of your realm what are ye said Arthur that tell me these
tidings / I am Merlyn / and I was he in the childs lykenes / A said king
Arthur ye are a merueillous man / but I merueylle much / of thy words that I
mote dye in bataille / Merueylle not said Merlyn / for it is gods will your
body to be punysshed for your foul deeds / but I may well be sorry said Merlyn /
for I shall dye a shameful death to be put in the earth quyck / and ye shall
dye a worshipful death / And as they talked this / came one with the kings horse
/ and so the king mounted on his horse and Merlyn on another and so rode unto
Carlyon / and anon the king asked Ector and Vlfyus how he was bigoten / and
they told him Vtherpendragon was his fader and queen Igrayn his mother / then
he said to Merlyn I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with her
/ And if she say so her self / then will I believe hit / In all have the
queen was sent for / and she came and brought with her Morgan le fay her
daughter that was as fair a lady as any might be / and the king welcomed
Igrayne in the best manner /

Capitulum xxj
Right so came Vlfyus and said openly that the king and all myt here that
were fested that day / ye are the falsest lady of the world and the most
traitresse unto the kings person / Beware said Arthur what thou say / thou
spekest a great word / I am well ware said Vlfyus what I speak / and here is my
glove to preue hit upon any man that will seye the contrary / that this queen
Igrayne is causar af your great damage / and of your great werre For and she
would have vtterd it in the life of king Vtherpe^dragon of the birth of you /
and how ye were begoten ye had never had the mortal werrys that ye have had for
the most party of your barons of your realm knew never whose sone ye were /
nor of whom ye were begoten / and she that bare you of her body should have
made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours / and in like wise
to all the reame / wherefore I preue her falls to god and to you and to al your
realm and who will say the contrary I will preue it on his body Then spak
Igrayne and said I am a woman and I may not fight / but rather than I should be
dishonored / there would some good man take my quarrel / / More she said / Merlyn
knows well and ye sir Vlfyus how king Other came to me in the Castle of
Tyntagaill in the lykenes of my lord that was deed three hours to fore / and
thereby gat a child that night upon me / And after the viij day king Other
wedded me / and by his commandment when the child was borne it was delyuerd
unto Merlyn and nourysshed by him / and so I saw the child never after / nor
wot not what is his name / for I knew him never yet / And there Vlfyus said
to the queen Merlyn is more to blame than ye / well I wot said the queen I bare
a child by my lord king Other / but I wot not Where he is become / then
Merlyn took the king by the hand saying / this is your mother / and therewith
sir Ector bare wytnes how he nourysshed him by Vthers commandment / And there
with king Arthur took his mother queen Igrayne in his arms and kyst her / and
either wept upon other / And then the king let make a feast that lasted
eight days / Then on a day there come in the court a squire on horse back
ledynge a knight before him wounded to the death / and told him how there was a
knight in the forest had rered up a pauelione by a well and has slain my
master a good knight / his name was mylis / wherefore I byseche you that my
master may be buried / and that sum knyt may revenge my masters death /
then the noise was great of that knights death in the Court / and every man
said his aduys / then came Gryflett that was but a squire / and he was but
young of the age of the king Arthur / so he besoughte the king for all his
seruyse that he had done him to give him the order of knyghthode

Capitulum xxij
THou art full young and tendyr of age said Arthur for to take so high an
order on the / Sir said gryflet I byseche you make me knyt / Sir said Merlyn it
were great pity to lose Gryflet / for he will be a passing good man / when
he is of age / abiding with you the term me of his life / And if he adventure
his body with yonder knight at the fontayne it is in great peril if ever he
come again / for he is one of the best knights of the world / and the
stre^gyst man of arms / well said Arthur / so at the desire of gryflet the
king made him knight / Now said Arthur unto sire Gryflet / Sythen I have made
you knight thou must give me a gift / what ye will said Gryflet / thou shall
promise me by the feythe of thy body when thou have Iusted with the knight at
the fontayne / whether it fall ye be on foot or on horsbak / that right so ye
shall come again unto me without making any more debate / I will promise you
said Gryflet as you desire / Then took Gryflet his horse in great haste / and
dressyd his sheld and took a spear in his hand / and so he rode a great wallop
till he came to the fontayne / and there by he saw a rich pauelion / and there
by under a clothe stood a fair horse well sadeled and brydeled / and on a tree a
shield of diverse colors and a great spear / Then Gryflet smote on the sheld
with the bott of his spear that the shylde fell down to the ground / with
that the knight came out of the pauelione / and said fair knight why smote ye
down my sheld / for I will Just with you said gryflet / it is better ye do
not said the knight for ye are but young and late made knight / and your might
is nothing to mine / as for that said Gryflet I will Just with you / that is
me loath said the knight / but sythen I must needs I will dress me thereto /
of whens be ye said the knyte sire I am of Arthurs court / So the two knights
ran to gyder that gryflets spear al to sheuered / and there with all he smote
Gryflet through the sheld and the lift side / and brake the spear that the
troncheon stack in his body / that horse and knight fylle down

Capitulum xxiij
THan the knight saw him lie so on the ground / he alyght and was passing
heavy / for he wend he had slain him / and then he unlaced his helm and
gate him wind / and so with the troncheon he set him on his horse and gate him
wind / and so bytoke him to god / and seid he had a mighty heart and if he
might live he would preue a passing good knyt / and so sir Gryflet rode to the
court where great doole was made for him / But through good leches he was heled
/ and saved / Right so came in to the Court xij knytes and were aged men / and
they came from the emperor of Rome / and they asked of Arthur truage for this
realm / other else the emperor would destroy him and his land / well said king
Arthur ye are messagers / therefore ye may say what ye will other else ye should dye
therefore / But this is mine ansuer I owe the emperor no truage nor none will I
hold him / but on a fair field I shall give him my truage that shall be with a
sharp spear / or else with a sharp swerd / and that shall not be long by my
faders soul Vtherpendragon / and therewith the messagers departed passyngly
wroth / and king arthur as wroth / for in evil time came they then / for the
king was passyngly wroth for the hurt of sir Gryflet / and so he commanded a
pryuy man of his chamber / that or hit be day his best horse and armor with all
that longs unto his person be without the cite or to morrow day Right so
or to morrow day he met With his man and his horse and so mounted up and dressid
his sheld / and took his spear and had his chamberlayne tarry there till he came
again / And so Arthur wode a soft paas till it was day / and then was he
ware of three chorles chacynge Merlyn / and would have slain him / then the
king rode unto them / and had them flee chorles / then were they a ferd when
they saw a knight and fled / O Merlyn said Arthur / here had thou be
slain for all thy crafts had I not been / Nay said Merlyn not so / for I
could save my self and I would / and thou art more nere thy death than I am for
thou ghost to the death ward and god be not thy friend / So as they went thus
talkyng / they came to the fontayne / and the rich pauelione there by hit /
then king Arthur was ware where sat a knight armed in a chayer / Sir knight
said Arthur / for what cause abydest thou here that there may no knight ride
this wey but if he Just with the said the king / I read the leave that custom
said Arthur This customme said the knight have I used and will use magre who
says nay / and who is grieved with my custom / let him amend hit that wol /
I will amend it said Arthur / I shall defend the said the knyt / anon he took
his horse and dressid his shylde and took a spear and they met so hard either in
others sheldes that al to sheuered their sperys / there with anon Arthur pulled
out his swerd / nay not so said the knight / it is fayrer said the knyt that
we tweyne run more to gyders with sharp sperys / I will well said Arthur and
I had any mo sperys I have ynow said the knyt / so there came a squire and brout
ij good sperys / and Arthur chose one and he another / so they spored their
horses and came to gyders with all the myghtes / that either brak her speres to
her hands / then Arthur set hand on his swerd / nay seid the knight / ye
shall do better / ye are a passing good Iuster as ever I met with all / and
ones for the love of the high order of knythode let us Just ones ageyn / I
assente me said Arthur / anon there were brought two great sperys / and every
knight gat a spear / and therewith they ran to gyders that Arthurs spear al to
sheuered / But the other knight hit him so hard in mids of the shield / that
horse and man fell to the earth / and there with Arthur was egre and pulled
out his swerd / and said I will assay the sir knight on foot / for I have
lost the honor on horsbak / I will be on horsbak said the knight / then was
Arthur wroth and dressid his sheld toward him with his swerd drawn / when the
knight saw that / he a light / for him thought no worship to have a knight at
such auaille he to be on horsbak and he on foot and so he alyght and dressid
his sheld unto Arthur and there began a strong bataille with many great strokes
/ and so hew with her swerdes that the cantels flewe in the feldes / and
much blood they bledde both / that all the place there as they faught was over
bledde with blood / and thus they fought long and rested hem / and then they
went to the batayl again / and so hurt led to gyders like two rams that
either fell to the earth So at the last they smote to gyders that both her
swerdys met even to gyders / But the swerd of the knight smote king arthurs
swerd in two pyeces / wherefore he was heavy / then said the knight unto Arthur
/ thou art in my danger Whether me list to save the or slay the / and but
thou yield the as over come and recreaunt / thou shall deye / as for death said
king arthur welcome be it when it comes / But to yield me unto the as
recreaunt I had lever deye than to be so shamed / And there with all the king
lepte unto Pellinore and took him by the myddel and threw him down and raced
of his helm / when the knight felt that / he was adrad / for he was a passing
bygge man of might / and anon he brought Arthur under him / and reaced of
his helm and would have smyten of his head /

Capitulum xxiiij
There with all came Merlyn and said knight / hold thy hand / For and thou slay
that knight thou put test this r^ame in the grettest damage that ever was
reame / For this knight is a man of more worship than thou wotest of / Why /
who is he said the knight / it is king Arthur Then would he have slain him
for dread of his wrath / and heue up his swerd / and therewith Merlyn cast an
enchauntement to the knight that he fell to the earth in a great sleep /
Then Merlyn took up king Arthur and rode forth on the knytes horse / Allas
said Arthur what have thou done merlyn have thou slain this good knight by
thy crafts / there lives not so worshipful a knight as he was / I had lever

Right so the king and he departed and went un till an ermyte that was a good
man and a great leche / So the heremyte serched all his woundys and gaf him
good salues so the king was there three days and then were his wounds well
amendyd that he might ride and goo / and so departed / and as they rode Arthur
said I have no swerd / no force said Merlyn here by is a swerd that shall be
yours and I may / So they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair
water / and brood / And in the mids of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm
clothed in white samyte / that held a fair swerd in that hand / loo said Merlyn
yonder is that swerd that I spak of / with that they saw a damoisel going upon
the lake / what damoysel is that said Arthur / that is the lady of the lake
said Merlyn / And within that lake is a roche / and theryn is as fair a place
as any on earth and rychely besene / and this damoysell will come to you anon
/ and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that swerd / Anon
with all came the damoysel unto Arthur / and salewed him / and he her again /
Damoysel said Arthur / what swerd is that / that yonder the arm holds above
the water / I would it were mine / for I have no swerd / Sir Arthur king said
the damoysell / that swerd is mine / And if ye will give me a yefte when I ask
it you / ye shall have it by my feyth said Arthur / I will give you what yefte
ye will ask / well said the damoisel go ye in to yonder large / and row your
self to the swerd / and take it / and scaubart with you / and I will ask my
yefte when I see my time / So sir Arthur and merlyn alyght and tayed their
horses to two trees / and so they went in to the ship / and when they came to
the swerd that the hand held / sire Arthur took it up by the handels / and took
it with him / and the arm and the hand went under the water / and so come unto
the land and rode forth / and then sir Arthur saw a rich pauelion / what
sygnyfyeth yo^der pauelion / yt is ye knytes pauelion seid merlyn yt ye fout
with last / sir Pellinore / but he is out / he is not there / he has a do
with a knight of yours that hight Egglame / and they have fouten to gyder / but
at the last Egglame fled and else he had been deed / and he has chaced him
even to Carlyon / and we shall mete with him anon in the high wey / that is well
said / said Arthur / now have I a swerd / now will I wage bataill with him and
be avenged on him / sir ye shall not so said Merlyn / for the knight is weary of
fyghtyng and chacyng so that ye shall have no worship to have a do with him /
Also he will not be lytly matched of one knyt living / and therefore it is my
counceil / let him pass / for he shall do you good seruyse in short time and
his sons after his days / Also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be
rit glad to give him your sister to wedde when I see him I will do as ye advise
me said Arthur Then sire Arthur looked on the swerd / and lyked it passing
well / whether lyketh you ^etter said Merlyn the suerd or the scaubard / Me
lyketh better the swerd said Arthur / ye are more unwise said Merlyn / for the
scaubard is worth x of the swerdys / for whiles ye have the scaubard upon you /
ye shall never lefe no blood / be ye never so sore wounded therefore keep well
the scaubard alweyes with you / so they rode unto Carlyon / and by the wey they
met with sir Pellinore / but Merlyn had done such a craft / that pellinore
saw not Arthur / and he past by without any words / I merueylle said Arthur
that the knight would not speak / sir said Merlyn / be saw you not / for and he
had seen you ye had not lightly departed / So they come unto Carlyon / whereof
his knights were passing glad / And when they herd of his auentures / they
merueilled that he would ieoparde his person so al one / But all men of
worship said it was merry to be under such a chyuetayne that would put his
person in adventure as other pour knights did /

Capitulum xxvij
THis mean while came a messager from king Ryons of Northwalys / And king he
was of all Ireland and of many Isles / And this was his message gretynge well
king Arthur in this manner wise saying / that king Ryons had discomfyte and
overcome xj kings / and eueryche of hem did him homage / and that was this /
they gaf him their berdys clean flayne of / as much as there was / where for the
messager came for king Arthurs berd / For king Ryons had purfyled a mantel with
kings berdes / and there lacked one place of the mantel / wherefore he sent for
his berd or else he would enter in to his lands / and brenne and slay / and
never leave till he have the head and the berd / well said Arthur thou have said
thy message / the which is the most vylaynous and lewdest message that ever
man herd sent unto a king / Also thou may see / my berd is full young yet to
make a purfyl of hit / But tell thou thy king this / I owe him none homage /
ne none of mine elders / but or it be long to / he shall do me homage on both
his kneys / or else he shall lose his head by the feith of my body / for this is
the most shamefullest message that ever I herd speak of / I have aspyed / thy
king met never yet with worshipful man / but tell him / I will have his head
without he do me homage / then the messager departed Now is there any here
said Arthur that knows king Ryons / then ansuerd a knight that hight Naram
/ Sire I know the king well / he is a passing good man of his body / as f^we
ben living / and a passing proud man / and sir doubt ye not / he will make
war on you with a mighty puyssaunce / well said Arthur I shall ordeyne for him
in short time

Then king arthur let send for all the children born on may day begote^ of
lords and born of ladies / for Merlyn told king Arthur that he that should
destroy him / should be borne in may day / wherefore he sent for hem all upon
pain of death and so there were found many lords sons / and all were sent
unto the king / and so was Mordred sent by king Lotts wife / and all were put
in a ship to the sea / and some were iiij wekes old and some less / And so by
fortune the ship drofe unto a castle and was al to ryuen and destroyed the most
part sauf that Mordred was cast up and a good man fond him / and nourysshed
him till he was xiiij year old / and then he brought him to the Court / as it
reherceth afterward toward the end of the death of Arthur / So many lords and
barons of this reame were displeased / for her children were so lost / and many
put the wit on Merlyn more than on Arthur / so what for dread and for love
they held their pees / But when the messager came to king Ryons / then
was he wood out of mesure and purueyed him for a great host as it rehercyth
after in the book of Balyn ^e sa^^age that follows next after / how by
adventure Balyn gat the swerd

Explicit liber primus
Incipit liber secundus
AFter the death of Vtherpendragon reigned Arthur his sone / the which had
great werre in his days for to get al England in to his hand / For there were
many kings within the realm of England and in walys / Scotland and
Cornewaille / So it befelle on a time / when king Arthur was at London there
came a knight and told the king tidings how that the king Ryons of
Northwalys had rered a great nombre of people / and were entryd in to the land
and burnt and slew the kings true liege people / if this be true said Arthur
/ it were great shame unto mine estate / but that he were myghtely withstand /
it is truth said the knight / for I saw the host my self / well said the
king / let make a cry / that all the lords knights and gentylmen of arms
should draw unto a castle called Camelot in tho days / and there the king would
let make a counceil general and a great Iustes So when the king was come
thither with all his baronage and lodged as they seemed best / there was come a
damoisel the which was sent on message from the great lady lylle of auelyon /
And when she came before king Arthur / she told from whom she came / and how
she was sent on message unto him for these causes Then she let her mantel
fall that was rychely furred / And then was she gyrd with a noble swerd
whereof the king had merueill / and said Damoysel for what cause are ye gyrd
with that swerd / it bisemeth you not / Now shall I tell you said the damoysel
/ This swerd that I am gyrd with all does me great sorrow and comberaunce / for
I may not be delyuerd of this swerd / but by a knight / but he must be a
passing good man of his hands and of his deeds and without vylonye or
trecherye and without treason / And if I may find such a knight that has
all these virtues / he may draw onte this swerd out of the shethe / for I
have been at king Ryons / it was told me there were passing good knights / and
he and all his knights have assayed it and none can speed / This is a great
merueill said Arthur / if this be sothe / I will my self assaye to draw out
the swerd / not presumynge upon my self that I am the best knight / but that I
will begin to draw at your swerd in gyuyng example to all the Barons that
they shall assay euerychone after other when I have assayed it / Then Arthur
took the swerd by the shethe and by the gyrdel and pulled at it egrely / but
the swerd would not out / Sire seid the damoysell ye need not to pulle half so
hard / for he that shall pulle it out shall do it with little might / ye say well
said Arthur / Now assaye ye al my barons / but beware ye be not defoyled with
shame treachery ne gyle / then it will not auaylle said the damoysell / for
he must be a clean knight without vylony and of a gentil strene of fader side
and mother side / Most of all the barons of the round table that were there at
that time assayed all by rewe / but there might none speed / wherefore the
damoysel made great sorrow out of mesure and said Allas I wend in this Court
had been the best knights without treachery or treson / By my feythe says
Arthur here are good knights as I deem as any ben in the world / but their
grace is not to help you / wherefore I am displeased

Capitulum ij
Then fell hit so that time / there was a pour knight with king Arthur /
that had been prisoner with him half a year and more for sleynge of a knight /
the which was cosyn unto king Arthur / the name of this knight was called
Balen / and by good means of the barons he was delyuerd out of prison / for
he was a good man named of his body / and he was borne in northumberland / and
so he went pryuely in to the Court / and saw this adventure / whereof hit
raised his heart / and would assaye it as other knights did / but for he was
pour and pourely arrayed he put him not far in prees / But in his heart he
was fully assured to do as well if his grace happed him as any knight that
there was / And as the damoysel took her leave of Arthur and of all the barons
so departing / this knight Balen called unto her and said Damoysel I pray you
of your curtosy / suffer me as well to assay as these lords though that I be so
po^rely clothed / in my heart me seems I am fully assured as sum of these
other / And me seems in my heart to speed right well / The damoysel beheld the
pour knight / and saw he was a lykely man / but for his pour arrayment she
thought he should be of no worship without vylonye or treachery / And then
she said unto the knight / sir it needs not to put me to more pain or labor /
for it seems not you to speed there as other have failled / A fair Damoysel
said Balen worthynes and good tatches and good deeds are not only in arrayment
/ but manhood and worship is hyd within man's person and many a worshipful
knight is not known unto all people / and therefore worship and hardynesse is
not in arayment / By god said the damoysel ye say sothe / therefore ye shall
assaye to do what ye may / Then Balen took the swerd by the gyrdel and shethe
/ and drew it out easyly / and when he looked on the swerd hit pleasyd him
much / then had the king and all the barons great merueille that Balen
had done that adventure / many knights had great despyte of Balen / Certes
said the damoysel / this is a passing good knight and the best that ever I
found and most of worship without treson / treachery or vylony / and many
merueylles shall he do / Now gentyl and curtois knight give me the swerd ayene
nay said Balen / for this swerd will I keep but it be taken from me with force
/ well said the damoysel ye are not wise to keep the swerd from me / for ye
shall slay with the swerd the best friend that ye have and the man that ye
most love in the world / and the swerd shall be your destruction / I shall
take the adventure said Balen that god will ordeyne me / but the swerd ye
shall not have at this time by the feythe of my body / ye shall repent hit
within short time said the damoysel / For I would have the swerd more for your
auaylle than for mine / for I am passing heavy for your sake / For ye will not
believe that swerd shall be your destruction / and that is great pity / with
that the damoysel departed making great sorrow / Anon after Balen sent for
his horse and armor / and so would depart fro the Court and took his leave of
king Arthur / nay said the king I suppose ye will not depart so litely fro
this felauship / I suppose ye are displeased that I have showed you unkindness
/ Blame me the less / for I was mys senformed against you / but I wend ye had
not ben such a knight as ye are of worship and prowess / and if ye will abide
in this court among my felauship / I shall so auaunce you as ye shall be
pleased / god thank your hyhenes said Balen / your bounte and hyhenes may no
man preyse half to the valewe / but at this time I must needs depart /
bysechyng you alwey of your good grace / Truly said the king I am right wroth
for your departing / I pray you fair knight / that ye tarry not long / and ye
shall be right welcome to me / and to my barons / and I shall amend all mysse
that I have done against you / god thank your great lordship said Balen / and
therewith made him ready to depart / Then the most party of the knights of
the round table said that Balen did not this adventure al only by might but by
wytchecraft

Capitulum Tercium
THe mean while that this knight was making him ready to depart / there came
in to the Court a lady that hight the lady of the lake / And she came on
horsbak rychely bysene / and salewed king Arthur / and there asked him a yefte
that he promised her when she gaf him the swerd / that is sothe said Arthur / a
gift I promised you / but I have forgoten the name of my swerd that ye gave me
/ The name of it said the lady is Excalibur that is as much to say as cut
stele / ye say well said the king / Ask what ye will and ye shall have it /
and hit lie in my power to give hit / well said the lady / I ask the heed of
the knight that has won the swerd / or else the damoysels heed that
brought hit / I take no force though I have both their hedes / for he slew
my brother a good knyte and a true / and that gentilwoman was causar of my
faders death / Truly said king Arthur I may not grant neither of her hedes
with my worship / therefore ask what ye will else / and I shall fulfille your
desire / I will ask none other thing said the lady / when Balyn was ready to
depart he saw the lady of the lake that by her menes had slain Balyns mother
and he had sought her three years / and when it was told him that she asked his
head of king Arthur he went to her streyte and said evil be you found / ye
would have my head / and therefore ye shall lose yours / and with his swerd
lightly he smote of her head before king Arthur / allas for shame said Arthur
why have ye done so / ye have shamed me and al my Court / for this was a lady
that I was be holden to / and hither she came under my sauf conduyte / I shall
never foryeue you that trespass / Sir said Balen me for thinks of your
displeasyr / for this same lady was the vntruest lady living / and by
enchauntement and sorssery she has been the destroyer of many good knights /
and she was causer that my mother was burnt through her falshede and treachery /
what cause so ever ye had said Arthur ye should have forborne her in my
presence / therefore think not the contrary ye shall repent it / for such
another despyte had I never in my Court / therefore withdraw you out of my
Court in all have that ye may / Then Balen took up the heed of the lady and
bare it with him to his hostry / and there he met with his squire that was sorry
he had displeased king Arthur / and so they rode forth out of the town / Now
said Balen we must depart / take thou this head and bear it to my frendys /
and tell hem how I have sped / and tell my frendys in Northumberland that my
most foo is deed / Also tell hem how I am out of prison / and what aue^ture
befelle me at the getyng of this swerd Allas said the squyar ye are gretely to
blame for to displease king Arthur / as for that said Balen I will hyhe me in all the have that I may to mete with king Ryons and destroy him either else to
dye therefore / and if it may hap me to win him / then will king Arthur
be my good and gracious lord / where shall I mete with you said the squire /
in king Arthurs Court said Balen / so his squire and he departed at that time
/ then king Arthur and all the Court made great doole and had shame of the
death of the lady of the lake then the king buried her rychely

Cpitulum iiij
AT that time there was a knight / the which was the kings sone of Irelond
and his name was Launceor / the which was an orgulous knyt / and counted him
self one of the best of the Court / and he had great despyte at Balen for the
encheuynge of the swerd that any should be acounted more hardy or more of
prowess / and he asked king Arthur if he would give him leave to ride after
Balen and to revenge the despyte that he had done / Do your best said Arthur I
am right wroth said Balen I would he were quyte of the despyte that he has done
to me and to my Court / Then this Launceor went to his hostry to make him
ready / In the mean while came Merlyn unto the Court of king Arthur and there
was told him the adventure of the swerd and the death of the lady of the lake /
Now shall I say you said Merlyn / this same damoysel that here stands that
brought the sword unto your Court / I shall tell you the cause of her
coming / she was the falsest damoysel that lives / say not so said they / She
has a brother a passing good knight of prowess and a full true man / and this
damoysel loved another knight that held her to peramour / and this good knight
her brother met with the knight that held her to peramour and slew him by
force of his hands / when this false damoysel understood this / she went to
the lady lyle of Auelione / and besought her of help / to be auengyd on her
own brother

Capitulum quintum
ANd so this lady lyle of Auelion took her this swerd that she brought with
her / and told there should no man pulle it out of the shethe but if he be one
of the best knights of this reame / and he should be hard and full of prowess /
and with that swerd he should slay her brother / this was the cause that the
damoysel came in to this Court / I know it as well as ye / would god she had
not comen in to this Court / but she came never in felauship of worship to do
good but alweyes great harm / and that knight that has encheued the suerd
shall be destroyed by that suerd / for the which will be great dommage / for
there lives not a knyt of more prowess than he is / and he shall do unto you
my lord Arthur great honor and kyndenesse / and it is great pity he shall not
endure but a while / for of his strength and hardynesse I know not his match
living / So the knight of Irelonde armed him at al points / and dressid his
shield on his sholder and mounted upon horsback and took his spear in his hand
/ and rode after a great paas as much as his horse might goo / and within a
little space on a montayne he had a syghte of Balyn / and with a loud voys he
cried abide knight / for ye shall abide whether ye will or nyll / and the sheld
that is to fore you shall not help / when Balyn herd the noise / he turned
his horse fyersly / and said fair knight what will ye with me / will ye
Just with me / ye said the Iryss^e knight / therefore come I after you /
parauenture said Balyn it had been better to have hold you at home / for many a
man weneth to put his enemy to a rebuke / and often it falls to him self /
of what court be ye sent fro said Balyn / I am come fro the Court of king
Arthur said the knight of Irlond / that come hyder for to revenge the despyte
ye did this day to king arthur and to his court / well said Balyn / I see well I
must have adoo with you that me forthynketh for to grieve king arthur or any of
his court / and your quarrel is full simple said Balyn unto me / for the lady
that is deed / did me great dommage and else would I have been loathe as any
knight that lives for to slay a lady / Make you ready said the knight launceor
/ and dress you unto me / for that one shall abide in the feld then they
took their speres / and came to gyders as much as their horses might drive /
and the Irysshe knight smote Balyn on the sheld that all went sheuers of his
spear / and Balyn hit him thorugh the sheld / and the hauberk perysshed / and
so percyd through his body and the horse croppe / and anon turned his horse
fyersly and drew out his swerd and wyste not that he had slain him / and
then he saw him lie as a deed corpse

Capitulum vj
Then he looked by him and was ware of a damoysel that came ride full fast as
the horse might ride on a fair palfroy / and when she aspyed that launceor was
slain / she made sorrow out of mesure and said O Balyn two bodies thou have
slain and one heart and two hertes in one body / and two souls thou have lost
/ And therewith she took the swerd from her love that lay ded and fylle to the
ground in a swowne / And when she aroos she made great dole out of mesure / the
which sorrow grieved Balyn passyngly sore / and he went unto her for to have
taken the swerd out of her hand but she held it so fast / he might not take
it out of her hand onles he should have hurt her / and suddenly she set the
pomell to the ground / and rofe her self through the body / when balyn aspyed
her deeds he was passing heavy in his heart and ashamed that so fair a
damoysell had destroyed her self for the love of his death / Allas said Balyn me
repe^teth sore the death of this knight for the love of this damoysel / for there
was much true love betwixe them both / and for sorrow might not longer behold
him but turned his horse and looked toward a great forest and there he was ware by
the arms of his brother Balan / and when they were met they put of her
helmes and kyssed to gyders and wept for joy and pity / Then Balan said / I
little wend to have met with you at this sudden adventure / I am right glad of
your delyueraunce and of your dolorous prysonement / for a man told me in the
/ castle of four stones that ye were delyuerd / and that man had seen you in
the court of king Arthur / and therefore I came hyder in to this country / for
here I supposed to find you / anon the knyt balyn told his brother of his
adventure of the swerd and of the death of the lady of the lake / and how king
arthur was displeased with him wherefore he sent this knyt after me that lies
here deed / and the death of this damoysel greueth me sore / so does it me said
Balan / but ye must take the adventure that god will ordeyne you / Truly said
Balyn I am right heavy that my lord Arthur is displeased with me / for he is the
most worshipful knight that regneth now on earth / and his love will I get or
else I will put my life in adventure / for the king Ryons lies at a syege at
castle Tarabil and thither will we draw in all have to preue our worship and
prowess upon him / I will well said Balan that we do and we will help each other
as brethren out to do /

Ca vij
NOw go we hens said balyn and well be we met / the mean while as they talked
there came a dwarf from the cite of camelot on horsbak as much as he might and
found the deed bodies / wherefore he made great dole and pulled out his here for
sorou and said which of you knytes have done this deed / where by ask thou
it said balan / for I would wete it said the dwarf / it was I said balyn that
slew this knight in my defendau^t for hyder he came to chaace me and other I
must sle^ him or he me / and this damoysel slew her self for his love which
repents me / and for her sake I shall owe al wymmen the better love / Allas
said the dwarf thou have done great dommage unto thy self / for this knight
that is here deed was one of the most ^alyaunts men that lived / and trust well
balyn the kynne of this knight will chase you through the world till they have
slain you / As for that said Balyn I fere not gretely / but I am right heavy
that I have displeased my lord king arthur for the death of this knight / So as
they talked to gyders there came a king of Cornewaille riding / the whi^he
hyghte king Mark / And when he saw these two bodies deed and understood hou
they were deed by the ij knights and so leyd him on on horse lyttar / with that
Merlyn was vanysshed and came to king Arthur before hand and told him how his
most enemy was taken and discomfyted / by whom said king Arthur / by two
knights said Merlyn that would please your lordship / and to morrow ye shall
know what knights they are / Anon after came the knight with the two swerdes
and balan his brother / and brought with hem king Ryons of Northwalys and there
delyuerd him to the porters and charged hem with him / and so they two
returned again in the daunyng of the day / king Arthur came then to king
Ryons and said Sir king ye are welcome / by what adventure come ye hyder / sir
said king Ryons I came hither by an hard adventure / who wanne you said king
Arthur / sire said the king the knight with the two swerdes and his brother
which are two merueillous knights of prowess / I know hem not said arthur
but much I am beholden to them / A said merlyn I shall tell you it is balen
that encheued the swerd and his brother balan a good knight / there lives not a
better of prowess and of worthynesse / and it shall be the grettest dole of him
that ever I knew of knight / for he shall not long endure / Allas said king
Arthur that is great pity for I am much beholding unto him / and I have ill
deserved it unto him for his kyndenes / nay said Merlyn he shall do much more
for you / and that shall ye know in have / but sir are ye purueyed said Merlyn
for to morn the hooste of New king Ryons brother will set on you or none
with a great host and therefore make you ready for I will depart from you

Capitulum x
Then king Arthur made ready his host in x batails and New was ready in the
field before the castle Tarabil with a great host / and he had x batails with
many mo people than Arthur had / Then New had the vaward with the most party
of his people / and merlyn came to king lot of the isle of Orkeney / and held him
with a tale of prophecye til New and his people were destroyed / and there sir
kay the sencyal did passyngly well that the days of his life the worship went
never from him and sir heruys de revel did merueillous deeds with with king
Arthur / and king Arthur slew that day xx knights and maimed xl / At that
time came in the knyte with the two swerdys and his brother Balan / But they two
did so merueillously that the king and all the knights merueilled of them /
and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as angels or
deuyls from hell / and king Arthur said him self they were the best knights
that ever he saw / for they gaf such strokes that all men had wonder of hem
In the mean while came one to king Lot and told him / while he tarried there
new was destroyed and slain with all his people / Allas said king Lot I am
ashamed / for by my defaute there is many a worshipful man slain / for and we
had been to gyders there had been none hooste under the heaven that had been abel
for to have matched with us / This fayter with his prophecye has mocked me /
All that did Merlyn for he knew well that and king Lot had been with his body
there at the first bataille / king Arthur had be slain / and all his people
destroyed / and well Merlyn knew the one of the kings should be deed that day /
and loath was Merlyn that any of them both should be slain / But of the tweyne
/ he had lever king Lotte had be slain than king Arthur / Now what is best to
do said king Lot of Orkeney whether is me better to treat with king Arthur
or to fight / for the gretter party of our people are slain / and destroyed /
Sir said a knight set on arthur for they are weary and forfoughten and we be
fresshe / As for me said king Lot I would every knight would do his part as I
would do mine / And then they auaunced baners and smoten to gyders and al to
sheuered their speres / and arthurs knights with the help of the knight with
two swerdes and his brother balan put king lot and his host to the werre / But
alweyes king Lot held him in the formest frunte and did merueillous deeds of
arms / for all his hooste was borne up by his hands for he abode al knights
/ allas he might not endure the which was great pity that so worthy a knyyt as
he was one should be ouermatched that of late time before had been a knight of
king Arthurs and wedded the sister of king arthur and for king Arthur lay by
king lots wife the which was arthurs sister and gat on her Mordred / therefore
king lot held against Arthur / So there was a knight that was called the knight
with the strange beeste / and at that time his right name was called Pellinore
/ the which was a good man of prowess / and he smote a mighty stroke at
king Lot as he fought with all his enemies / and he failed of his stroke / and
smote the horse neck that he fylle to the ground with king lot And therewith
anon Pellinore smote him a great stroke through the helm and head unto the
brows and then all the hooste of Orkeney fled for the death of king Lot /
and there were slain many moders sons / But king Pellinore bare the wit of
the death of king Lot / wherefore sir Gawayne revenged the death of his fader the
x year after he was made knight and slew king Pellinore with his own hands
/ Also there were slain at that bataille xij kings on the side of king Lot
with New / and all were buried in the church of saint Steuyns in Camelot /
and the remenaunt of knights and of other were buried in a great roche

SO at the enterement came king Lots wife Morgause with her four sons Gawayne
/ Agrauayne / Gaherys and Gareth / Also there came thither king Vryens sir Ewayns
fader and Morgan le fay his wife that was king Arthurs sister / All these came
to the enterement / but of all these xij kings king Arthur let make the
tomb of king Lot passing rychely / and made his tomb by his own / and
then Arthur let make xij images of laton and couper / and over gylt hit with
gold in the sign of xij kings / and echon of hem held a tapyr of wax that
brent day and nyt / and king Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing
above hem with a swerd drawn in his hand / and all the xij fygures had
countenance like unto men that were overcome / All this made Merlyn by his
subtyl craf^e and there he told the king wha^ I am deed / these tapers shall
brenne no longer / and soon after the adventures of the Sangrayll shall come
among you and be encheued / Also he told Arthur how Balyn the worshipful knight
shall give the dolourous stroke / whereof shall fall great vengeance / O where
is Balen and Balan and Pellinore said king Arthur / as for Pellinore said
Merlyn / he will mete with you soon / And as for Balyn he will not be long
from you / but the other brother will depart ye shall see him no more / By my
feyth said Arthur they are two merueyllous knights / and namely Balyn passes
of prowess of any knight that ever I found / for much be holden am I unto
him / would god he would abide with me / Sir said Merlyn look ye keep well the
scaubard of Excalibur / for ye shall lose no blood while ye have the scauberd
upon you though ye have as many wounds upon you as ye may have / So after for
great trust Arthur betoke the scauberd to Morgan le fay his sister / and she
loved another knight better than her husband king Vryens or king Arthur And
she would have had Arthur her brother slain / And therefore she let make another
scauberd like it by enchauntement and gaf the scauberd Excalibur to her love /
and the knights name was called Accolon that after had nere slain king arthur
/ After this Merlyn told unto king Arthur of the prophecye / that there should
be a great batail beside Salysbury and Mordred his own sone should be ageynste
him / Also he told him that Basdemegus was his cosyn and germayn unto king
Vryence

WYthm a day or two king Arthur was somewhat seek / and he let pytche his
pauelione in a medowe / and there he leyd him down on a paylet to sleep / but
he might have no rest / Right so he herd a great noise of an horse and therewith
the king looked out at the porche of the pauelione / and saw a knight coming
even by him making great dole Abide fair sir said Arthur / and tell me wherefore
thou make this sorrow / ye may little amend me said the knight and so
passed forth to the castle of Melyot / A none after there came balen / and when
he saw king Arthur / he alyght of his horse / and came to the king on foot /
and salewed him / by my head said Arthur ye be welcome / Sire right now came
riding this way a knight making great moorne / for what cause I can not tell
/ wlerfor I would desire of you of your curtosye and of your gentylnesse to
fetch again that knight / either by force or else by his good will / I will do
more for your lordship than that said balyn / and so he rode more than a paas
and found the knight with a damoysel in a forest and said sir knyt ye must come
with me unto king Arthur for to tell him of your sorrow / that will I not /
said the knight / for hit will scathe me gretely / and do you none auaylle /
sir said Balyn I pray you make you ready for ye must goo with me / or else I must
fight with you and bring you by force / and that were me both to do / will
ye be my Waraunt said the knight and I goo with you / ye said Balyn or else I
will deye therefore / And so he made him ready to go with Balyn / and left the
damoysel stylle / And as they were even before king Arthurs pauelione / there
came one inuysybel and smote this knight that went with Balyn through out the
body with a spear / Allas said the knight I am slain under your co^duyt with
a knight called Garlon / therefore take my horse that is better than yours and
ride to the damoysel and follow the quest that I Was in / as she will led you
and revenge my death when ye may / That shall I do said Balyn / and that I
make a vow unto knygthode / and so he departed from this knight with great
sorrow / So king Arthur let berye this knight rychely / and made a mensyon on
his tomb / how there was slain Herlews le berbeus / and by whom the treachery
was done the knight garlon / But ever the damoysel bare the truncheon of the
spear with her that sir Harlews was slain with all

Capitulum xiij
SO Balyn and the damoysel rode in to a forest / and there met with a knight
that had been on hunting / and that knight asked Balyn for what cause he made
so great sorrow / me list not to tell you said Balyn / Now said the knight
and I were armed as ye be I would fight with you / that should little need said
Balyn / I am not aferd to tell you / and told him all the cause how it was A
said the knight is this al / Here I ensure you by the feithe of my body never
to depart from you while my life lasts / and so they went to the hostry and
armed hem / and so rode forth with balyn / And as they came by an heremytage
even by a Chyrcheyerd / there came the knight garlon inuysybel and smote this
knight Peryn de mountebeliard through the body with a spear / Allas said the
knight I am slain by this traytoure knight that rydeth Inuysyble / Allas
said balyn it is not the first despyte he has done me / and there the heremyte
and Balyn beryed the knight under a rich stone and a tomb royal And on the
morn they fond letters of gold / written / how sir Gaweyn shall revenge his
faders death king Lot / on the king Pellinore / Anon after this balyn and the
damoysel rode till they came to a castle and there balyn alyghte / and he and
the damoysel wend to goo in to the castle / and anon as balyn came within the
castles yate the portroolys fylle down at his bak / and there fell many men
about the damoysel / and would have slain her / when balyn saw that / he was
sore agreued / for he might not help the damoysel / and then he went up in
to the toure and lepte over the wallys in to the dyche / and hurt him not /
and anon he pulled out his suerd and would have fouten with hem / and they all
said nay they would not fight with him / for they did no thing but thold
custom of the castle / and told him how her lady was seek / and had layne many
years / and she might not be hole but if she had a dysshe of silver full of
blood of a clean maid and a kings daughter / and therefore the custom of this
castle is / there shall no damoysel pass this way but she shall blede of her
blood in a silver dysshe full / well said balyn she shall blede as much as she
may blede / but I will not lose the life of her whiles my life lasts / and so
balyn made her to blede by her good will / but her blood halpe not the lady /
and so he and she rested there al night / and had there right good chere / and
on the morn they passed on their ways / And as it tells after in the
sangraylle that sire Percyualis sister halpe that lady with her blood whereof
she was deed

Capitulum xiiij
Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure / and by
hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at ease
/ And as they sat at her souper balyn herd over complain grievously by him in a
chayer / what is this noise said balen / forsothe said his host I will tell
you / I was but late at a Iustynge / and there I Iusted with a knight that is
brother unto king Pellam / and twyes smote I him down / and then he promised
to quyte me on my best frynde / and so he wounded my sone that can not be hole
till I have of that knights blood / and he rydeth alwey Inuysyble / but I
know not his name / A said Balyn / I know that knight / his name is Garlon /
he has slain two knights of mine in the same manner / therefore I had lever mete
with that knight than all the gold in this realm / for the despyte he has
done me / well said his ooste I shall tell you king Pellam of lystyneyse has
made do cry in all this country a great feast that shall be with in these xx
days / and no knight may come there but if he bring his wife with him / or his
peramour / and that knyte your enemy and mine ye shall see that day / Then
I behote you said Balyn part of his blood to hele your sone with all / we
will be forward to morn said his oost / So on the morn they rode all three
toward Pellam / and they had xv days Journey or they came thither / and that
same day began the greet feeste / and so they alyght and stabled their horses
/ and went in to the Castle / but balyns oost might not be let in by cause he
had no lady / then Balyn was well received and brought unto a chamber and
unarmed him / and there were brought him robes to his pleasyr / and would have
had Balen leave his swerd behind him Nay said Balen that do I not for it is
the customme of my Country a knight alweyes to keep his wepen with him and
that customme will I keep / or else I will depart as I came / then they gaf
him leave to were his swerd / and so he went unto the castle / and was set
among knights of worship and his lady before him / Soon balyn asked a knight
/ is there not a knight in this court whose name is Garlon / yonder he goth said
a knight / he with the blak face / he is the merueyllest knyt that is now
living for he destroys many good knights / for he goth Inuysyble A well said
Balen is that he / then balyn auysed him long if I slay him here I shall not
escape / And if I leave him now perauentur I shall never mete with him again at
such a steven / and much harm he will do and he live / There with this
Garlon aspyed that this Balen beheld him / and then he came and smote Balyn
on the face with the bak of his hand / and said knyt why beholdest thou me so
for shame therefore ete thy mete and do that thou came for / Thou say sothe
said Balyn / this is not the first despyte that thou have done me / and therefore
I will do that I came for and rose up fyersly and claue his head to the
sholders / give me the truncheon said Balyn to his lady where with he slew
your knight / anon she gaf it him / for alwey she bare the troncheon with her
And therewith Balyn smote him through the body / and said openly with that
truncheon thou have slain a good knight / and now it stycketh in thy body /
And then Balyn called unto him his host / saying / now may ye fetch blood
enough to hele your sone with all /

Capitulum xv
Anon all the knights aroos from the tabyl for to set on Balyn / and king
Pellam him self aroos up fyersly / and said knyt have thou slain my brother /
thou shall dye therefore or thou depart / well said balen do it your self yis
said king pella^ / there shall no man have ado with the / but my self for the
love of my brother / Then king Pellam caut in his hand a grym wepen and smote
egrely at balyn / but balyn put his swerd betwixe his head and the stroke / and
therewith his swerd breast in sonder / And when balyn was wepenles he ran in to
a chamber for to seek sum wepen / and so fro chamber to chamber / and no
wepen he could find / and alweyes king Pellam after him / And at the last he
entryd in to a chambyr that was merueillously well dyte and rychely / and a
bed arrayed with clothe of gold the rychest that might be thought / and one
lyenge theryn / and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four pelours of
silver / that bare up the table / and upon the table stood a merueillous spear
straungely wrought / And when balyn saw that spear / he gat it in his hand and
turned him to king Pellam / and smote him passyngly sore With that spear that
king Pellam fell down in a swoune / and therewith the castle roof and wallys
brake and fylle to the earth / and balyn fell down so that he might not
stere foot nor hand / And so the most party of the castle that was fall
down thorugh that dolorous stroke lay upon Pellam and balyn three days

Capitulum xvj
Then Merlyn came thither and took up Balyn and gat him a good horse for his was
deed / and bad him ride out of that country / I would have my damoysel said
balyn / Loo said Merlyn where she lies deed and king Pellam lay so many years
sore wounded / and might never be hole till Galahad the haute prince heled him
in the quest of the Sangraille / for in that place was part of the blood of our
lord Ihesu christ that Joseph of Armathe brought in to this land / and there him
self lay in that rich bed / And that was the same spear that Longeus smote
our lord to the heart / and king Pellam was nyghe of Joseph kynne / and that
was the most worshipful man that lived in tho days / and great pity it was of
his hurt / for through that stroke turned to great dole tray and tene / Then
departed Balyn from Merlyn and said in this world we mete never no more / So he
rode forth through the fair countries and Cytees and fond the people deed
slain on every side / and all that were on live cried O balyn thou have
caused great dommage in these co^trayes for the dolorous stroke thou gave
unto king Pella^ three contreyes are destroyed / and doubt not but the
vengeance will fall on the at the last / when Balyn was past tho contrayes
he was passing feign / so he rode eyt days or he met with adventure / And at
the last he came in to a fair forest in a valey and was ware of a Toure / And
there beside he saw a great horse of werre tayed to a treee / and there beside
satte a fair knight on the ground and made great morning and he was a lykely
man and a well made / Balyn said God save you why be ye so heavy / tell me and I
will amend it and I may to my power / Sir knight said he again thou do
me great gryef / for I was in merry thoughts and now thou put me to more
pain / Balyn went a little from him / and looked on his horse / then herd
Balyn him say thus / a fair lady why have ye broken my promise / for thou
promysest me to mete me here by none / and I may curse the that ever ye gaf me
this swerd / for with this swerd I slay my self / and pulled it out / and
therewith Balyn sterte unto him and took him by the hand / let goo my hand said
the knight or else I shall slay the / that shall not need said balyn / for I shall
promise you my help to get you your lady / and ye will tell me where she is
/ what is your name said the knight / mine name is Balyn le saueage / A sir I
know you well enough ye are the knight with the two swerdys and the man of
most prowess of your hands living / what is your name said balen / my name
is garnysshe of the mount a pour man's sone / But by my prowess and hardynesse
a duke has maade me knight / and gaf me lands / his name is duke Hermel / and
his daughter is she that I love and she me as I demed / houfer is she hens said
Balyn / but vj mile said the knight Now ride we hens said these two knights
/ so they rode more than a paas till that they came to a fair castle well wallyd
and dyched / I will in to the castle said Balen / and look if she be there /
So he went in and serched fro chamber to cha^bir / and fond her bed but she
was not there / Then Balen looked in to a fair litil gardyn / and under a
laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quylt of grene samyte and a knight in her
arms fast halsynge either other and under their hedes grass and herbs / when
Balen saw her lie so with the fowlest knight that ever he saw and she a fair
lady / then Balyn went through all the chambers again and told the knight
how he fond her as she had slepte fast / and so brought him in the place there
she lay fast slepynge

Capitulum xvij
ANd when Garnyssh beheld her so lyeng for pure sorou his mouth and nose brast
out on bledynge and with his swerd he smote of both their hedes / and then
he maade sorrow out of mesure and said O Balyn / Much sorrow have thou brought
unto me / for had thou not showed me that ^yght I should have passed my
sorrow / forsooth said balyn I did it to this intent that it should better thy
courage / and that ye might see and know her falshede / and to cause you to
leave love of such a lady / god knows I did none other but as I would ye did
to me / Allas said garnysshe now is my sorou doubel that I may not endure / Now
have I slain that I most loved in all my life / and therewith suddenly he roof
him self on his own swerd unto the hyltys / when balen saw that he dressid him
thens ward / lest folk would say he had slain them / and so he rode forth /
and within three days he came by a cross / and thereon were letters of gold
wryte^ that said / it is not for no knight alone to ride toward this Castle /
then saw he an old hoar gentylman coming toward him that said Balyn le
Saueage thou passyst thy bands to come this way / therefore torn again and it
will auaille the / and he vanysshed awey anon / and so he herd an horn blow
as it had been the death of a best / That blast said Balyn is blown for me /
For I am the pryse and yet am I not deed / anon with all he saw an honderd
ladies and many knights that welcomed him with fair semblaunt and made him
passing good chere / unto his sight and led him in to the castle / and there
was daunsynge and mynstralsye and all manner of Joy / Then the chyef lady of
the castle said / knight with the two suerdys ye must have adoo and Just with
a knight hereby that keeps an Island / for there may no man pass this way but
he must Just or he pass / that is an unhappy customme said Balyn that a
knight may not pass this wey / but if he Just / ye shall not have adoo but
with one knight said the lady / well said Balyn syn I shall thereto I am ready
but traueillynge men are often weary and their horses to / but though my horse be
weary / my heart is not weary / I would be feign there my death should be / Sir said a
knight to Balyn / me thinks your sheld is not good / I will leave yew a
^yggar / thereof I pray you / and so he took the sheld that was unknown and
left his own and so rode unto the Island / and put him and his horse in a great
boot / and when he came on the other side / he met with a damoysel / and she
said / O knight balyn why have ye left your own sheld / allas ye have put
your self in great danger / for by your sheld ye should have been known / it is
great pity of you as ever was of knight / for of thy prowess and hardynes thou
have no felawe living / Me repents said balyn that ever I came within this
Country / but I may not torn now again for shame and what adventure shall
fall to me be it life or death I will take the adventure that shall come to
me and / then he looked on his armor / and understood he was well armed / and
therewith blessid him and mounted upon his horse

Capitulum xviij
Then before him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight and his horse
trapped all reed and him self in the same color / when this knight in the
reed beheld Balyn him thought it should be his brother Balen by cause of his two
swerdys / but by cause he knew not his sheld he demed it was not he / And so
they auentryd their speres and came merueillously fast to gyders / and they
smote other in the sheldes / but their speres and their course were so bygge
that it bare down horse and man that they lay both in a swoun But balyn was
brysed sore with the fall of his horse / for he was weary of trauaille / And
Balan was the first that rose on foot and drew his swerd and went toward
Balyn / and he aroos and went against him / But balan smote balyn first / and
he put up his shield and smote him through the shield and tamyd his helm /
then Balyn smote him again with that unhappy swerd and well nyghe had fellyd
his brother Balan / and so they fought there to gyders till their brethes faylled
/ then Balyn looked up to the castle and saw the Towers stand full of ladies /
So they went unto bataille again and wounded eueryche other dolefully / and
then they brethed oftymes / and so went unto bataille that all the place
there as they fought was blood reed / And at that time there was none of them
both but they had either smyten other seven great wounds so that the best
of them myt have been the death of the myghtyest gyaunt in this world / Then
they went to batail ageyn so merueillously that doubt it was to here of that
bataille for the great blood shedynge And their hawberkes vnnailled that naked
they were on every side / At last balan the younger brother withdrewe him a
little and leid him down / Then said balyn le Saueage what knight art thou
/ for or now I found never no knyt that matched me / my name is said he balan
brother unto the good knight balyn / Allas said balyn that ever I should see this
day / and therewith he fell backward in a swoune / Then balan yede on al four
feet and hands and put of the helm of his brother and might not know him by
the vysage / it was so full hewn and bledde / but when he awoke he said O balan
my brother thou have slain me and I the / wherefore all the wide world shall
speak of us both / Allas said Balan that ever I saw this day that through
myshap I might not know you / for I aspyed well your two swerdys / but by cause
ye had another shild I demed ye had been another knyt Allas said Balyn all that
maade an unhappy knight in the castle / for he caused me to leave mine own
shield to our bothes destruction / and if I myt live I would destroy that
castle for ylle customs / that were well done said Balan / For I had never
grace to depart fro hem syn that I came hither / for here it happed me to slay
a knight that kept this Island / and syn might I never depart / and no more
should ye brother and ye might have slain me as ye have and escaped your self
with the life / Right so came the lady of the Toure with iiij knights and vj
ladies and vj yomen unto them and there she herd how they made her moan either
to other and said we came both out of one tomb that is to say one moders
belly / And so shall we lie both in one pytte / So Balan prayed the lady of her
gentylnesse for his true seruyse / that she would burye them both in that same
place there the bataille was done / and she granted hem with weeping it should
be done rychely in the best manner / Now will ye send for a priest that we may
receive our sacrament and receive the blessid body of our lord Ihesu christ / ye
said the lady it shall be done / and so she sent for a priest and gaf hem her
ryghtes / Now said balen when we are buried in one tomb and the mensyon made
over us / how ij brethren slew each other / there will never good knight nor
good man see our tomb but they will pray for our souls / and so all the
ladies and gentylwymen wept for pity / Then anon Balan dyed but Balyn dyed
not till the mydnyghte after / and so were they buried both / and the lady let
make a mensyon of Balan how he was there slain by his broders hands / but she
knew not balyns name /

Capitulum xix
IN the morn came Merlyn and let w^yte balyns name on the tomb with letters
of gold / that here lies balyn le Saueage that was the knyt with the two
swerdes and he that smote the dolorous stroke / Also Merlyn let make there a
bed / that there should never man lie therein / but he went out of his wit /
yet Lancelot de lake fordyd that bed through his noblesse / and anon after
Balyn was deed / merlyn took his swerd / and took of the pomel and set on an
other pomel / so merlyn bad a knight that stood before him handeld that swerd /
and he assayed / and he might not handle hit Then Merlyn lough / why laugh ye
said the knight / this is the cause said Merlyn / there shall never man handle
this suerd but the best knight of the world / and that shall be sir Lancelot
or else Galahad his sone / and Lancelot with this suerd shall slay the man
that in the world he loved best that shall be sir Gawayne / All this he let
write in the pomel of the swerd / Then Merlyn let make a bridge of iron and
of stele in to that Island / and it was but half a foot broad / and there
shall never man pass that bridge nor have hardynes to goo over / but if he
were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery or vylonye / Also
the scaubard of Balyns swerd Merlyn left it on this side the Island that
galahad should find it / Also merlyn let make by his subtylyte that Balyns
swerd was put in a marbel stone standing up right as great as a mylle stone /
and the stone houed alweyes above the water and did many years / and so by
adventure it swam down the streme to the Cite of Camelot that is in english
wynchestre / and that same day galahad the haute prince came with king Arthur /
and so galahad brought with him the scaubard and encheued the sword / that
was there in the marbel stone / houynge upon the water / And on whytsonday he
encheued the swerd as it is reherced in the book of Sa^cgrayll / Soon after
this was done Merlyn came to king Arthur and told him of the dolorous stroke
that Balyn gaf to king Pellam / and how Balyn and Balan fought to gyders the
merueillous batail that ever was herd of / and how they were buried both in
one Tomb / Allas said king Arthur / this is the grettest pity that over I herd
tell of two knytes / for in the world I know not such two knights /

Thus ends the tale of Balyn and of Balan two brethren born in
northu^berla^d good knites /
Sequitur iij liber
Capitulum primum
IN the beginning of Arthur after he was chosen king by adventure and by grace
for the most party of the barons knew not that he was Other pendragons sone /
But as Merlyn made it openly known / But yet many kings and lords held
great werre against him for that cause / But well Arthur overcame hem all / for
the most party the days of his life he was ruled much by the counceil of
Merlyn / So it fell on a time king Arthur said unto Merlyn / my barons will
let me have no rest but needs I must take a wife / and I will none take / but
by thy counceill and by thine aduys / it is well done said Merlyn / that ye take
a wife / for a man of your bounte and noblesse should not be without a wife / Now
is there any that ye love more than another / ye said king Arthur / I love
gweneuer the kings daughter Lodegrean of the land of Camelerd / the which
holds in his hows the table round that ye told he had of my fader Other / And
this damoysel is the most ^alyaunt and fairest lady that I know living or
yet that ever I could find / Sire said Merlyn as of her beauty and fayrenes
she is one of the fairest on live / But and ye loved her not so well as ye do /
I should find you a damoysel of beauty and of goodenesse that should like you
and plese you and your heart were not set / But there as a man's heart is set
/ he will be loathe to return / that is troth said king Arthur / but Merlyn
warned the king covertly that gweneuer was not wholesome for him to take to wife
/ for he warned him that lancelot should love her and she him again / and so
he turned his tale to the auentures of Sancgreal / Then merlyn desired of the
king for to have men with him that should enquere of gweneuer / and so the king
granted him / and Merlyn went forth unto king Lodegrean of Camyllerd / and
told him of the desire of the king that he would have unto his wife Gweneuer his
daughter / that is to me said king Lodegreans the best tidings that ever I
herd that so worthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wedde my daughter /
And os for my lands I will give him wys^ I it might please him / but he has
lands ynowe / him needs none / but I shall send him a gift shall please
him much more / for I shall give him the table round / the which
Vtherpendragon gave me / and when it is full complete / there is an C knights
and fyfty / And as for on C good knights I have my self / but I fawte / l /
for so many have been slain in my days / and so Ladegreans delyuerd his
daughter Gweneuer unto Merlyn / and the table round with the C knights / and
so they rode fresshly with great royalte / what by water and what by land / till
that they came nyghe unto london

Capitulum Secundum
When king Arthur herd of the coming of gweneuer and the C knights with the
table round / then king Arthur maade great Joy for her coming / and that
rich present / and said openly this fair lady is passing welcome unto me /
for I have loved her long / And therefore there is nothing so lyef to me / And
these knights with the round table pleasen me more than right great richesse /
And in all have the king let ordeyne for the marriage and the Coronacyon in
the most honorable wise that could be devised Now Merlyn said king Arthur /
goo thou and aspye me in all this land l knights which ben of most prowess
and worship / within short time merlyn had found such knytes that should
fulfylle xx and viij knights but no mo he conde find Then the Bishop of
Caunterbury was fette and he blessid the syeges with great Royalte and devotion
/ and there set the viij and xx knights in her syeges / and when this was
done / Merlyn said fair syrs ye must al arise and come to king Arthur for to
do him homage / he will have the better will to mayntene you / and so they
arose and did their homage / and when they were gone / merlyn fond in every
syeges letters of gold that told the knights names that had sytten therein /
But two syeges were void / And so anon came young gawayn and asked the king a
yefte Ask said the king / and I shall grant it you / sir I ask that ye will
make me knyt / that same day ye shall wedde fair Gweneuer / I will do it with
a good will said king arthur and do unto you all the worship that I may / for I
must by reason ye ar mine neuew my susters sone /

Ca iij
FOrth with all there came a pour man in to the Court and brought with him a
fair young man of xviij year of age riding upon a lene mare / and the pour
man asked all men that he met / where shall I find king arthur / yonder he is
said the knights / wylt thou any thing with him ye said the pour man /
therefore I came hyder / anon as he came before the king he salewed him and said
O king Arthur the flower of all knights and kings I byseche Ihesu save the /
Sir it was told me that at this time of your marriage ye would give any man the
yefte that he would ask / out except that were unreasonable / that is troth
said the king such cries I let make / and that will I hold so it apayre not
my realm nor mine estate / ye say well and graciously said the pour man / Sire
I ask no thing else but that ye will make my sone here a knight / it is a great
thing thou ask of me said the king / what is thy name said the king to the
pour man / sir my name is Aryes the Cowherd / whether comes this of the or of
thy sone said the king / Nay sire said Aryes / this desire comes of my sone
and not of me / For I shall tell you I have xiij sons / and all they will
fall to what labor I put them and will be right glad to do labor / but
this child will not labor for me for any thing that my wife or I may do /
but alweyes he will be shetynge or casting darts / and glad for to see
batailles and to behold knights / And alweyes day and night he desires of me
to be made a knyt what is thy name said the king unto the young man / Sire my
name is Tor / the king beheld him fast / and saw he was passyngly well vysaged
and passyngly well made of his years well said king Arthur unto Aryes the Cowherd
fetch al thy sons before me that I may see them / and so the pour man did and
al were shapen much like the pour man / But Tor was not like none of hem al
in shap ne in contenaunce / for he was much more than any of hem / Now said
king Arthur unto the Cowherd / where is the swerd he shall be maade knight
with all / it is here said Tor / take it out of the shethe said the king / and
require me to make you a knight

Then Tor alyght of his mare and pulled out his swerd knelynge and
requyrynge the king / that he would maake him knight / and that he might be a
knight of the table round As for a knyt I will make you / and therewith smote
him in the neck with the swerd saye^g be ye a good knyt / and so I pray to god
so ye may be / and if ye be of prowess and of worthynesse ye shall be a
knight of the table round / Now Merlyn said Arthur say whether this Tor shall
be a good knight / or no / ye sire he ought to be a good knight / for he is
comen of as good a man as any is on live / and of kings blood / how so sir
said the king / I shall tell you said Merlyn / This pour man Aryes the
cowhe^d is not his fader / he is nothing syb to him / for king Pellinore is
his fader / I suppose nay said the Cowherd / fetch thy wife before me said
merlyn / and she shall not say nay / anon the wife was fet which was a fair
houswyf / and there she ansuerd Merlyn full womanly / and there she told the
king and Merlyn that when she was a maid and went to milk kyen / there met
with her a stern knight / and half by force he had my maidenhede / and at that
time he bigat my sone Tor / and he took awey from me my greyhound that I had
that time with me / and said that he would keep the greyhound for my love / A
said the Cowherd I wend not this / but I may bileue it well / for he had never
no tatches of me / sir said Tor unto Merlyn dishonor not my mother / sir said
merlyn it is more for your worship than hurt / for your fader is a good man
and a king / and he may right well auaunce you and your mother / for ye were
begoten or ever she was wedded / that is troth said the wife / hit is the less
gryef unto me said the Cowherd

Capitulum Quartum
SO on the morn king Pellinore came to the Court of king Arthur / which had
great joy of him and told him of Tor / how he was his sone / and how he had
made him knight at the request of the Cowherd / When Pellinore beheld Tor / he
pleasyd him much / so the king made gawayne knight / but Tor was the first he
made at the feast / what is the cause said king Arthur that there ben two
places void in the syeges / Sire said Merlyn / there shall no man sit in tho
places / but they that shall be of most wor^ship / But in the sege perilous
there shall no man sytte therein but one / and if there be any so hardy to do it
he shall be destroyed / and he that shall sytte there shall have no felawe /
And therewith Merlyn took king Pellinore by the hand / and in the one hand
next the two seges and the sege peryllous he said in open audyence this is your
place and best ye are worthy to sytte there in of any that is here / there at
sat sir gauayne in great envy and told Gaherys his brother / yonder knight is
put to great worship / the which greueth me sore / for he slew our fader
king Lot / therefore I will slay him said Gauayne with a swerd / that was sent
me that is passing trenchaunt / ye shall not so said Gaherys at this time /
For at this time I am but a squire / and when I am made knight / I wol be
auengyd on him and therefore brother it is best ye suffer till another time that we
may have him out of the Court / for and we did so / we should trouble this
hyhe feast / I will well said gauayn as ye will /

Capitulum quintum
Then was the high feeste made ready / and the king was wedded at Camelott
unto Dame Gweneuer in the church of saint steuyns with great solempnyte / And
as every man was set after his degree / Merlyn went to all the knights of
the round table / and bad hem sytte still that none of hem remeue / for ye
shall see a strange and a merueillous adventure / Right so as they sat there
came rennyng in a white heart in to the halle and a white brachet next him and
xxx couple of black rennyng hounds came after with a greet cry / and the heart
went about the table round as he went by other boordes / the white brachet
boot him by the buttok and pulled out a pees / where through the heart lepte a
great lepe / and ouerthrewe a knight that sat at the board side / and therewith
the knyt aroos and took up the brachet / and so went forth out of the halle
and took his horse and rode his wey with the brachet / right so anon came in a
lady on a white palfrey and cried aloude to king Arthur / Sire suffer me not to
have this despyte for the brachet was mine that the knight lad aweye / I may
not do therewith said the king With this there came a knight riding al armed
on a great horse / and took the lady awey with him with force / and ever she
cried and made great dole / when she was gone the king was glad for she made
such a noise / Nay said merlyn / ye may not leave this adue^tures so lyghtely /
For these adventures must be brought again or else it would be disworship to you
and to your feast I will said the king that al^ be done by your aduys / Then
said merlyn let call sir gauayne / for he must bring again the white heart
/ Also sir ye must let call Sire Tor / for he must bring again the brachet
/ and the knight or else slay him / Also let call king Pellinore for he must
bring again the lady and the knight or else slay him / and these three knights
shall do merueillous aue^tures or they come ageyn Then were they called al
three as it reherceth before / and eueryche of hem took his charge / and armed
them surely / But sir gauayne had the first request / and therefore we will
begin at him /

Capitulum vj
Sire gauayne roode more than a paas and gaheryse his brother that roode with
him instead of a squire to do him seruyse / So as they rode they saw two
knytes fight on horsbak passing sore / so sir gauayn and his brother rode
betwixe them / and asked them for what cause they fought so / the one knight
ansuerd and said / we fight for a simple matter / for we two be two brethren
born and hegoten of one man and of one woman / allas said sir gauayn why do ye
so / sir said the eldar / there came a white heart this way this day and many
hou^des chaced him / and a white brachet was alwey next him / and we understood
it was adventure made for the hyhe feast of king Arthur / and therefore I would
have gone after to have won me worship / and here my younger brother said he
would go after the heart / for he was better knight than I / And for this cause
we fell at debate / and so we thout to preue which of us both was better
knyt / This is a simple cause said sir gauayn / uncouth me^ ye should debate
with all and no brother with brother / therefore but if ye will do by my cou^ceil I
will have ado with you / that is ye shall yield you unto me / and that ye go unto
king Arthur and yield you unto his grace / sir knyt said the ij brethren we
are forfoughten and much blood have we lost through our wilfulness / And
therefore we would be loath to have adoo with you / then do as I will have you
said sir gauayne / we will agree to fulfylle your will / But by whom shall
we say that we be thither sent / ye may say / by the knyt that follows the
quest of the heart that was white / Now what is your name said gauayne /
Sorlouse of the forest said the eldar and my name is said the younger Bryan of
the forest and so they departed and went to the kings Court / and Sir
gauayne on his quest / and as gauayne followed the heart by the cry of the
hounds even before him there was a great River / and the heart swamme over / and
as sir gauayne would follow after / there stood a knight over the other side and
said / Sire knight come not over after this heart / but if thou will Just
with me / I will not faille as for that said sir gauayn to follow the quest
that I am in / and so maade his horse to swymme over the water / and anon they
gat their speres / and ran to gyder full hard / but sire gauayne smote him of
his horse / and then he turned his horse and had him yield him / Nay said the
knight not so though thou have the better of me on horsbak / I pray the
valiant knight alyghte a foot and match we to gyders with swerdes / what is
your name said sir gauayne / Alardyn of the Ilys said the other / then
either dressid her sheldes and smote to gyders / but sir gauayne smote him so
hard through the helm that it went to the brains and the knight fell down
deed / A said Gaheryse that was a mighty stroke of a young knight /

Capitulum Septimum
Then Gauayne and Gaheryse rode more than a paas after the white heart / and
let slyppe at the heart three couple of greyhoundes / and so they chase the
heart in to a castle / and in the chyef place of the castle they slew the heart
/ sir gauayne and gaheryse followed after / Right so there came a knight out
of a chamber with a swerd draw in his hand and slew two of the greyhoundes
even in the syghte of sire gauayne / and the remenaunte he chaced hem with his
swerd out of the castle / And when he came again he said / O my white heart /
me repents that thou art deed / for my sovereign lady gaf the to me / and
evil have I kept the / and thy death shall be dear bought and I live / and
anon he went in to his chamber and armed him / and came out fyersly / and
there met he with sir gauayne / why have ye slain my hounds said sir gauayn
/ for they did but their kind / and lever I had ye had wroken your anger upon
me than upon a dom best thou say troth said the knight I have auengyd me on
thy hounds and so I will on the or thou goo / Then sir Gauayne alyght a
soote and dressid his shield and stroke to gyders myghtely / and clafe their
sheldes and stoned their helmes and brak their hawberkes that the blood ran
down to their feet / At last sir gauayne smote the knight so hard that he
fell to the earth / and then he cried mercy / and yielded him and besought
him as he was a knight and gentylman / to save his life / thou shall dye said
sir gauayne for sleyng of my hounds / I will make amendys said the knight
unto my power / Sir gauayne would no mercy have but vnlacyd his helm to have
stryken of his head / Right so came his lady out of a chamber and fell over
him / and so he smote of her head by mysauenture / Allas said Gaheryse that
is foul and shamefully done / that shame shall never from you / Also ye should
give mercy unto them that ask mercy / for a knyt without mercy is without
worship / Sir gauayne was so stonyed of the death of this fair lady / that he
wiste not what he did / and said unto the knight arise I will give the mercy /
nay nay said the knight / I take no force of mercy now / for thou have slain
my love and my lady that I loved best of all erthely thing / Me sore
repents it said sir gauayn / for I thought to stryke unto the / But now thou
shall goo unto king Arthur and tell him of thine adventures and how thou art
overcome by the knight that went in the queste of the white heart / I take no
force said the knyt whether I live or I dye but so for dread of death he swore
to goo unto king Arthur / and he made him to bear one greyhound before him on
his horse and another behind him / what is your name said sir gauayn or we
depart / my name is said the knight Ablamor of the marise / so he departed
toward Camelot

Capitulum Octauum
ANd sir gauayne went in to the castle and made him ready to lie there al night
/ and would have unarmed him / what will ye do said gaheryse / will ye unarm
you in this Country / ye may think ye have many enemies here / they had not
sooner said that word but there ca^ four knights well armed and assaylled sir
gauayne hard and said unto him thou new made knight thou have shamed thy
knyghthode / for a knight without mercy is dishonored Also thou have slain a
fair lady to thy great shame to the worlds end / and doubt thou not thou
shall have great need of mercy or thou depart from us / And therewith one of
hem smote sir gauayne a great stroke that nygh he fell to the earth / and
gaheryse smote him again sore / and so they were on the one side and on the
other / that sir gauayne and gaheryse were in ieopardy of their lives / and one
with a bow an archer smote sir gauayne thur the arm that it grieved him
wonderly sore / And as they should have been slain / there came four fair ladies
/ and besought the knights of grace for sire gauayne / and goodely at
request of the ladies they gaf sir gauayne and gaheryse their lives / and made
hem to yield them as prisoners / then gauayne and gaheryse made great dole /
Allas said sire gauayne mine arm greueth me sore / I am like to be maimed and
so made his complaynt pytously / erly on the morrow there came to sir gauayne one
of the four ladies / that had herd all his complaynte and said sir knyte what
chere / not good said he it is your own defaulte said the lady / for ye have
done a passing foul deed in the sleynge of the lady / the which will be
great vylany unto you / But be ye not of king Arthurs kyn said the lady / yes
truly said sir gauayne / what is your name said the lady / ye must tell it me
or ye pass / my name is gauayne the king Lot of Orkeney sone / and my mother
is king Arthurs sister / A then are ye neuewe unto king Arthur said the lady
/ and I shall so speak for you that ye shall have conduyte to go to king
Arthur for his love / and so she departed / and told the four knights how
their prisoner was king Arthurs neuewe / and his name is sir gauayne king
Lots sone of Orkeney / and they gaf him the hertes head by cause it was in his
quest / Then anon they delyuerd sir Gauayne under this promise that he should
bear the deed lady with him in this manner / The head of her was hanged about
his neck and the hole body of her lay before him on his horse mane / Right so
rode he forth unto Camelot / And anon as he was come merlyn desired of king
Arthur yt Sire Gauayne should be sworn to tell of all his auentures / and how
he slew the lady / and how he would give no mercy unto the knight / where
through the lady was slain / Then the king and the queen were gretely
displeased with sir gauayn for the sleynge of the lady / And there by ordenaunce
of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on sir gauayn / and they Iuged him
for ever while he lived to be with all ladies and to fyte for her quarrels / and
that ever he should be curteys / and never to refuse mercy to him / that asks
mercy / Thus was gauayne sworn upon the four euuangelystes that he should never
be against lady ne gentil woman / but if he fought for a lady / and his
adversary fout for another / And thus ends the adventure of sir gauayn that he
did at the marriage of king Arthur Amen

Capitulum ix
THan Sire Tor was ready he mounted upon his horsbak / and rode after the knight
with the brachet / so as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly / that smote his
horse on the head with a staf / that he went backward his spear length / why
do thou so said sire Tor / for thou shall not pass this way / but if thou
Just with yonder knights of the pauelions / Then was Tor ware where two
pauelions were / and great sperys stood out / and two sheldes henge on trees
by the pauelions / I may not tarry said sir Tor / for I am in a quest that I
must needs follow / thou shall not pass said the dwarf and therewith all he
blewe his horn / then there came one armed on horsbak / and dressyd his shield
/ and came fast toward Tor / and he dressid him against him / and so ran to
gyders that Tor bare him from his horse / and anon the knight yield him to his
mercy / But sir I have a felawe in yonder pauelione that will have adoo with
you anon / he shall be welcome said sir Tor / Then was he ware of another
knight coming with great raundon / and each of them dressid to other / that
merueille it was to see / but the knight smote sire Tor a great stroke in
mids of the shield that his spear all to sheuered And sir Tor smote him
through the sheld by low of the sheld that it went through the coost of the
knyt / but the stroke slew him not / And therewith sir Tor alyght and smote him
on the helm a great stroke / and therewith the knight yielded him and besought
him of mercy / I will well said sir Tor / But thou and thy felawe must goo unto
king Arthur / and yield you prisoners un to him / by whom shall we say are we
thither sent / ye shall say by the knight that went in the quest of the knight
that went with the brachet / Now what be your ij names said sir Tor / my name
is said the one Sire Felot of Langduk / and my name is said the other Sir
Petypase of wynchylse / Now go ye forth said sire Tor and god speed you and me
/ Then came the dwarf and said unto sir Tor / I pray you give me a yefte / I
will well said sir Tor / ask / I ask no more said the dwarf / but that ye
will suffer me to do you seruyse / for I will serve no more rec^eaunt
knights / Take an horse said sir Tor and ride on with me / I wot ye ride after
the knight with the white braclet / and I shall bring you there he is said
the dwerf / And so they rode through out a forest / and at the last they were
ware of two pauelions even by a pryory with two sheldes / And the one shylde
was enewed with white / and the other shield was reed

Capitulum x
There with sir Tor alyghte and took the dwarf his glayue / and so he came to
the white pauelione / and saw three damoysels lie in it / and one paylet
slepyng / and so he went to the other pauelione / and found a lady lyeng
slepyng there in / But there was the white brachet that bayed at her fast / and
therewith the lady yede out of the pauelione and all her damoysels / But anon
as sir Tor aspyed the white brachet / he took her by force and took her to the
dwerf / what / will ye so said the lady take my brachet from me / ye said sir
Tor / this brachet have I sought from king Arthurs Court hyder / well said
the lady / knight ye shall not go fer with her / but that ye shall be met
and grieved / I shall abide what adventure that comes by the grace of god / and
so mounted upon his horse / and passed on his way toward Camelot / but it was
so nere night he myt not pass but little ferther / know ye any lodgyng said
Tor I know none said the dwarf / but here besides is an hermytage / and there
ye must take lodging as ye find / And within a while they came to the
heremytage and took lodgyng / and was there gras otys and breed for their
horses soon it was sped / and full hard was their souper but there they rested
hem al night till on the morn / and herd a mass deuoutely / and took their
leave of the heremyte / and sire Tor prayed the heremyte to pray for him / he
said he would and betook him to god / And so mounted upon horsbak and rode
toward Camelot a long while / with that they herd a knyte call loud that
came after hem / and he said knight abide / and yield my brachet that thou
took from my lady / Sir Tor returned again / and beheld him how he was a
semely knight and well horsed and well armed at al points / then Sire Tor
dressyd his shield and took his spear in his hands and the other came fyersly
upon him / and smote both horse and man to the earth / anon they aroos
lyghtely and drew her swerdes as egrely as lions and put their sheldes before
them and smote through the sheldes that the cantels fell of both parties /
Also they tamyd their helmes that the hot blood ran out / and the thyck
maylles of their hawberkes they carfe and rofe in sonder that the hot blood
ran to the earth / and both they had many wounds and were passing weary / But
sir Tor aspyed that the other knight faynted / and then he sewed fast upon
him and doubled his strokes and garte him go to the earth on the one side /
then Sire Tor bad him yield him / that will I not said Abilleus while my life
lasts and the soul is within my body onles that thou will give me the
brachet / that will I not do said sire Tor / for it was my quest to bring
again thy brachet / the or both /

Capitulum xj
With that came a damoysel riding on a palfrey as fast as she myt drive and
cried with a loud voys unto Sire Tor / what will ye with me said sir Tor / I
byseche the said the damoysel for king Arthurs love / give me a yefte / I
require the gentyl knight as thou art a gentilman / Now said Tor Ask a yefte
and I will give it you / gramercy said the damoy^el / Now I ask the head of
the false knight Abelleus / for he is the most outragyous knight that lives
and the grettest murderer / I am both seid sir Tor of that gift I have given
you / let him make amendys in that he has trespaced unto you / now said the
damoysel he may not / for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes that was
a better knight than he / and he had had grace / and I kneled half an hour
before him in the mire for to save my broders life that had done him no damage
but fought with him by adventure of arms / and so for all that I could do / he
stroke of his head wherefore I require the as thou art a true knight to give me
my yefte or else I shall shame the in all the Court of king Arthur / for he is the
falsest knight living and a great destroyer of good knights / Then when
Abelleus herd this / he was more aferd / and yielded him and asked mercy / I
may not now said sir Tor / but if I should be found falls of my promise / for
while I would have taken you to mercy / ye would none ask but if ye had the
brachet ageyn that was my quest And therewith he took of his helm / and he
aroos and fled / and sir Tor after him and smote of his head quyte / Now sir
said the damoysel / it is nere night / I pray you come and lodge with me here
at my place / it is here fast by / I will Well said sir Tor / for his horse and
he had ferd evil syn they departed from Camelot / and so he rode with her and
had passing good there with her / and she had a passing fair old knight to
her husband that made him passing good chere and well easyd both his horse and
he / and on the morn he herd his mass and brake his fast and took his leave
of the knight and of the lady that besought him to tell him his name / Truly
he said my name is sir Tor that was late made knight / and this was the first
queste of arms that ever I did to bring ageyn that this knight Abelleus took
awey fro king arthurs court / O fair knight said the lady and her husband /
and ye come here in our marches / come and see our pour lodging / and it
shall be alweyes at your commandment / So sire Tor departed and came to
Camelot on the thyrdde day by noone / and the king and the queen and all the
Court was passing feign of his coming and made great joy that he was come
again / for he went from the Court with little socour / but as king Pellinore
his fader gaf him an old courser / and king Arthur gaf him armor and a swerd /
and else had he none other socour / but rode so forth him self alone / And
then the king and the queen by merlyns aduys made him to swear to tell of
his auentures / and so he told and made pryeues of his deeds as it is before
reher^ed / wherefore the king and the queen made great joy / nay nay said
Merlyn these ben but Iapes to that he shall do / for he shall preue a noble
knight of prowess as good as any is living and gentyl and curteis and of good
tatches and passing true of his promise / and never shall outrage where
through Merlyns words king Arthur gaf him an erldome of bonds that fell unto
him / and here ends the quest of Sir Tor king Pellenors sone

Capitulum xij
Then king Pellinore armed him and mounted upon his horse and rode more than
a paas after the lady that the knyt ladde awey / And as he rode in a forest he
saw in a valey a damoysel sit by a well and a wounded knight in her arms /
and Pellenore salewed her / And when she was ware of him she cried over loud /
help me knight for crystes sake king Pellinore and he would not tarry he was
so eger in his quest / and ever she cried an C times after help When she saw
he would not abide / she prayed unto god to send him as much need of help as
she had / and that he myt feel it or he dyed / So as the book tells the
knight there dyed that there was wounded / wherefore the lady for pure sorrow
slew her self with his swerd / As king Pellinore rode in that valey he met
with a pour man a labourer / Saw thou not said Pellinore a knight riding
and ledynge aweye a lady / ye said the man / I saw that knight and the lady
that made great dole / And yonder bynethe in a valey there shall ye see two
pauelions and one of the knytes of the pauelions chalengyd that lady of that
knight and said she was his cosyn nere / wherefore he should led her no ferther /
And so they waged bataill in that quarrel / the one said he would have her by
force / and the other said he would have the rule of her by cause he was her
kynnesman and would led her to her kyn / for this quarrel he left them
fighting / And if ye will ride a paas ye shall find them fyghtyng / and the
lady was beleft with the two squyers in the pauelions / god thank the said
king Pellenore / Then he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two
pauelions and the two knights fyghtyng / anon he rode unto the pauelions / and
saw the lady that was his quest / and said fair lady ye must goo with me unto
the court of king Arthur / Sir knight said the two squyers that were with her
yonder are two knights that fight for this lady / goo thither and depart them
/ and be agreed with hem / and then may ye have her at your pleasyr / ye say
well said king Pellenore / And anon he rode betwixt them and departed hem and
asked hem the causes why that they fought / Sir knight said the one / I shall
tell you / this lady is my kynneswoman nygh mine auntes daughter / And when I
herd her complain that she was with him maulgre her head / I waged bataille to
fight with him / Sire knight said the other whoos name was Hontzlake of
wentland / and this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthurs
court / that is untruly said / said king Pellenore / for ye came in suddenly
there as we were at the high feast and took awey this lady or any man might
make him ready and therefore hit was my quest to bring her again and you both
/ or else the one of us to abide in the field / therefore the lady shall goo with
me / or I will dye for it / for I have promised hit king Arthur / And there
for fight ye no more / for none of you shall have no part of her at this
time / And if ye list to fyte for her / fyte with me / and I will defend her
/ well said the knights make you ready / and we shall assaille you with all our
power / And as king Pellenore would have put his horse fro them fyr Hontzlake
roof his horse through with a swerd and said / Now art thou on foot as well as
we are / when king Pellinore aspyed that his horse was slain / lytely he lepte
from his horse / and pulled out his swerd / and put his sheld before him / and
said knight keep well thy heed / for thou shall have a buffet for the sleyng
of my horse / So king Pellenore gaf him such a stroke upon the helm that he
clafe the head down to the chynne that he fylle to the earth deed

Capitulum xiij
ANd then he turned him to the other knyte that was sore wounded / but when
he saw the others buffet / he would not fight / but kneled down and said take
my cosyn the lady with you at your request / and I require you as ye be a true
knight / put her to no shame nor vylony / what said king Pellenore will ye
not fight for her / no sir said the knight I will not fight with such a
knyte of prowess as ye be / well said Pellenore / ye say well / I promise you
she shall have no vylony by me as I am true knight / but now me lacks an horse
said Mellinore / but I will have hontzlakes horse / ye shall not need said the
knight / for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you / so that ye

ANd there with he armed him / so right even before him there met two knights /
the one came froward Camelot / and the other from the north / and either
salewed other / what tidings at Camelot said the one / by my head said the
other there have I ben and aspyed the court of king Arthur And there is such a
felauship they may never be broken / and well nyghe all the world holds with
Arthur / for there is the flour of chyualrye / Now for this cause I am rydyng
in to the north to tell our chyuetayns of the felauship that is withholden
with king Arthur / as for that said the other knight I have brought a remedy
with me that is the grettest poison that ever ye herd speak of and to Camelot
will I with it / for we have a friend right nyghe king Arthur and well cherysshed
that shall poysone king Arthur / for so he has promised our chyuetayns and
received great yeftes for to do it / Beware said the other knight of Merlyn /
for he knows all things by the deuyls craft / therefore will I not let it
said the knight / and so they departed in sonder / Anon after Pellenore maade
him ready and his lady and rode toward Camelot / And as they came by the well
there as the wounded knight was and the lady / there he fond the knight and
the lady eten with lions or wild beestes al sauf the head / wherefore he made
great sorrow and wept passing sore and said Allas her life might I have saved
/ but I was so fyers in my quest therefore I would not abide / wherefore make ye
such doole said the lady / I wot not said Pellinore / but my heart morneth
sore of the death of her for she was a passing fair lady and a young / Now will
ye do by mine aduys said the lady / take this knight and let him be buried
in an heremytage / and then take the ladies head and bear it with you unto
Arthur / So king Pellinore took this deed knight on his sholders / and
brought him to the heremytage and charged the heremyte with the corpse / that
seruyse should be done for the soul / and take his harneys for your pain / it
shall be done said the heremyte as I will ansuer unto god

ANd there with they departed and came there as the head of the lady lay with a
fair yelow here that grieved king Pellinore passyngly sore when he looked on hit
/ for much he cast his heart on the vysage / And so by none they came to
Camelot / and the king and the queen were passing fayn of his coming to the
Court / And there he was made to swear upon the four euuangelystes to tell
the troth of his quest from the one to the other / A sir Pellinore said queen
Gweneuer ye were gretely to blame that ye saved not this ladies life / Madame
said Pellinore ye were gretely to blame and ye would not save your own life and
ye myt / but sauf your pleasir I was so furyous in my quest that I would not
abide / and that repents me and shall the days of my life / Truly said Merlyn
ye out sore to repent it / for that lady was your own douter begoten on the
lady of the rule / and that knight that was deed was her love / and should have
wedded her / and he was a right good knight of a young man and would have preued
a good man / and to this court was he coming and his name was sir Miles of the
lau^dys / and a knyt came behind him / and slew him with a spear and his name
is Lorayne le saueage a falls knyt and a coward / and she for great sorrow and
dole slew her self with his swerd / and her name was Eleyne / And by cause ye
would not abide and help her / ye shall see your best friend faylle you when
ye be in the grettest distress that ever ye were / or shall be / And that
penance god has ordained you for that deed / that he that ye shall most
trust to of any man alive / he shall leave you there ye shall be slain / Me
forthynketh said king Pellinore that this shall me betyde but god may fordoo
well desteny / Thus when the quest was done of the white heart / the which
followed sir gawayne and the quest of the brachet followed of sir Tor Pellenors
sone / and the quest of the lady that the knight took aweye / the which king
Pellinre at that time followed / Then the king stablysshed all his knights
and gaf them that were of lands not rich / he gaf them lands / and charged
hem never to do outragyousyte nor mordre / and alweyes to flee treason / Also
by no mean to be cruel / but to give mercy unto him that asks mercy upon
pain of forfeture of their worship and lordship of king Arthur for evermore /
and alweyes to do ladies / damoysels / and gentylwymmen socour upon pain of
death / Also that no man take no batails in a wrongful quarrel for no law ne
for no worlds goods / Unto this were all the knights sworn of the table

So after these questys of Sir Gawyne / Sire Tor / and king Pellinore / It
fell so that Merlyn fell in a dottage on the damoisel that king Pellinore
brought to Court / and she was one of the damoysels of the lake that hyte
Nyneue / But Merlyn would let have her no rest but alweyes he would be with her
/ And ever she maade Merlyn good chere till she had learned of him al manner
thing that she desired and he was assoted upon her that he might not be from
her / So on a time he told king Arthur that he should not dure long but for all his crafts he should be put in the earth quyck and so he told the king many
things that should befalle / but allewayes he warned the king to keep well his
swerd and the scaubard / for he told him how the swerd and the scaubard should
be stolen by a woman from him that he most trusted / Also he told king Arthur
that he should mysse him / yet had ye lever than al your lands to have me
again / A said the king / syn ye know of your adventure puruey for hit / and
put awey by your crafts that mysauenture / Nay said Merlyn it will not be /
so he departed from the king / And within a while the damoysel of the lake
departed / and Merlyn went with her evermore where some ever she went / And
oftymes merlyn would have had her pryuely awey by his subtyle crafts / then
she made him to swear that he should never do none enchauntement upon her if he
would have his will / And so he swear / so she and Merlyn went over the s^e
unto the land of Benwyck there as king Ban was king that had great war
against king Claudas / and there Merlyn spoke with king Bans wife a fair lady
and a good / and her name was Elayne / and there he saw young Lancelot /
there the queen made great sorrow for the mortal werre yt king claudas made on
her lord and on her lands / Take none heaviness said Merlyn / for this same
child within this xx year shall revenge you on king Claudas that all
Crystendom shall speak of it And this same child shall be the most / man of
worship of the world / and his first name is galahad / that know I well said
Merlyn / And syn ye have confermed him Lancelot / that is truth said the
queen / his first name was Galahad / O Merlyn said the queen shall I live to
see my sone such a man of prowess / ye lady on my parel ye shall see hit /
and live many wynters after / And so soon after the lady and Merlyn departed
/ and by the way Merlyn showed her many wondres / and came in to Cornewaille /
And alweyes Merlyn lay about the lady to have her maydenhode / and she was
ever passing weary of him / and feign would have been delyuerd of him / for she
was aferd of him by cause he was a deuyls sone / and she could not beskyfte him
by no mean / And so on a time it happed that Merlyn showed to her in a roche
where as was a greet wonder / and wroughte by enchauntement that went under a
great stone / So by her subtyle wyrchynge she maade Merlyn to goo under that
stone to ^ete her wete of the merueilles there / but she wroughte so there for
him that he came never out for all the craft he could do / And so she
departed and left Merlyn /

Capitulum Secundum
ANd as king Arthur rode to Camelot / and held there a great feast with myrthe
and Joy / so soon after he returned unto Cardoylle / and there came unto
Arthur new tidings that the king of Denmark and the king of Ireland that
was his brother and the king of the vale and the king of Soleyse / and the
king of the isle of Longtaynse al these five kings with a great host were
entrid in to the la^d of king Arthur and burnt and slew clean before hem /
both Cytees and castles that it was pity to here / Allas said Arthur yet had I
never rest one monethe syn I was crowned king of this land / Now shall I
never rest till I mete with tho kings in a fair feld / that I make mine auowe
for my true lyege people shall not be destroyed in my defaulte / goo with me
who will and abide who that will / then the king let write unto king
Pellenore and prayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he
might lytlyest rere and hye him after in all have / All the Barons were pryuely
wroth / that the king would depart so suddenly but the king by no mean would
abide / but made writing unto them that were not there / and bad them hye
after him such as were not at that time in the Court / Then the king came
to queen gweneuer and said lady make you ready / for ye shall goo with me / for
I may not long mysse you / ye shall cause me to be the more hardy / what
adventure so befalle me / I will not wete my lady to be in no ieopardy / Sire
said she I am at your commandment / and shall be ready what time so ye be
ready / So on the morn the king and the queen departed with such felauship as
they had / and came in to the North in to a forest beside humber and there
lodged hem

When the word and tydynge came unto the five kings above said that Arthur
was beside humber in a foreste there was a knight brother unto one of the five
kings that gafe hem this counceille / ye know well that sire Arthur has the
flower of Chyualrye of the world with him as it is preued by the great bataille
he did with the xj kings / And therefore hye unto him night and day till that
we be nyghe him / for the longer he taryeth the bygger he is / and we ever the
waiker And he is so couragyous of him self that he is come to the field with
little people / And therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall slay down
of his knights there shall none escape

Capitulum Tercium
UNto this counceille these five kings assented / and so they passed forth
with her host through Northwalis and came upon Arthur by night and set upon
his host as the king and his knights were in their pauelions king Arthur
was unarmed / and had leid him to rest with his queen Gweneuer / Sir said sir
kaynus it is not good we be unarmed / we shall have no need said sire Gawayne
and Sir Gryflet that lay in a little pauelione by the king / with that they
herd a great noise and many cried treson treson / Allas said king Arthur we
ben bitrayed / Unto arms felawes then he cried / so they were armed anon at
al points / Then came there a wounded knight unto the king and said sir
save your self and my lady the queen for our hooste is destroyed and much
people of ours slain / So anon the king and the queen and the three knights
took her horses and rode toward humber to pass over it / and the water was so
rough that they were aferd to pass over / Now may ye chese ^ayd king Arthur
whether ye will abide and take the aduentur on this side / for and ye be taken
/ they will slay you / It were me lever said the queen to dye in the water
than to fall in your enemies hands and there be slain / And as they stood
so talkyng / sir kaynus saw the five kings coming on horsbak by hem self
alone with her speres in her hands even toward hem / loo said sir kaynus
yonder be the five kings / let us go to them and match hem / that were folly
said sire gawayne / for we are but three and they ben five that is truth said
sire Gryflet / No force said sir kay I will undertake for two of them / and
then may ye three undertake for the other three / and there with all sir kay let
his horse run as fast as he might and struck one of them through the shield /
and the body a fadom that the king fell to the earth stark deed / That saw
sir Gawayne and ran unto another king so hard that he smote him through the
body / And there with all king Arthur ran to another / and smote him through the
body With a spear that he fylle to the earth deed / Then sir Gryflet ran
unto the iiij king and gaf him such a fall that his neck brake / Anon sir
kay ran unto the fyfthe king and smote him so hard on the helm that the
stroke clafe the helm and the head to the earth / that was well stryken said
king Arthur / and worshipfully have thou hold thy promise / therefore I shall
honor the / while that I live / and there with all they set the queen in a
barge in to humber / but alweyes queen gweneuer praised sir kay for his deeds /
and said what lady that ye love / and she love you not again she were gretely
to blame / and among ladies said the Queen I shall bear your noble fame /
for ye spak a great word and fulfilled it worshipfully and therewith the queen
departed / Then the king and the three knights rode in to the forest / for
there they supposed to here of them that were escaped / and there he fond the
most party of his people / and told hem all how the five kings Were deed / and
therefore let us hold us to gyders till it be day / and when their host have a
spyed that their chyuetayns be slain they will make such dole that they
shall not mow help hem self / and right so as the king said / so it was /
for when they fond the five kings deed / they made such dole that they fell
fro their horses / There with all came king Arthur but with a few people and
slew on the lift hand and on the right hand that well nyhe there escaped no man
/ but all were slain to the nombre of xxx M / And when the bataille was all
ended the king kneled down and thanked god mekely / and then he sent for
the queen and soon she was come / and she maade great Joy of the ouercomynge
of that bataille

Capitulum iiij
THere with all came one to king Arthur / and told him that king Pellinore
was within three mile with a great host / and he said / go unto him and let
him understand how we have spedde / So within a while king Pellinore came
with a great host / and salewed the people and the king / and there was great
joy made on every side / Then the king let search how much people of his
party there was slain / And there were found but little past two honderd men
slain and viij knytes of the table round in their pauelions Then the king
let rere and deuyse in the same place there as the batail was done a fair
abbeye and endowed it with great lyue^ode and let it call the Abbey of la
beale adventure / but when sum of them came in to their Countries there of
the five kings were kings and told hem how they were slain / there was made
great dole / And all king Arthurs enemies as the king of Northwales and the
kings of the North wyste of the bataille they were passing heavy / and so the
king returned unto Camelot in have / And when he was come to Camelot / he
called king Pellinore unto him and said ye understand well that we have lost
viij knights of the best of the table round / and by your aduys we will chese
viij again of the best we may find in this Court / Sir said Pellinore / I
shall counceille you after my conceyte the best / there are in your Court full
noble knights both of old and young And therefore by mine aduys ye shall chese
half of the old and half of the young / which be the old said king Arthur /
Sire said king Pellinore me seems that king Vryence that has wedded your
sister Morgan le fay and the king of the lake and sir Heruyse d^ revel a noble
knight / and sir galagars the iiij / this is well devised said king Arthur and
right so shall it be / Now which are the four young knytes said Arthur Sire
said Pellinore the first is sir Gawayne your neuewe that is as good a knight
of his time / as any is in this la^d And the second as me seems best is sire
Gryflet le fyse the d^ne that is a good knight and full desirous in arms / and
who may see him live he shall preue a good knight / And the third as me seems
is well to be one of the knights of the round table sir kay the senescha for
many times he has done full worshipfully / And now at your last bataille he did
full honorably for to undertake to slay two kings / By my head said Arthur he
is best worthy to be a knight of the round table of any that ye have reherced /
and he had done no more prowess in his life days

Capitulum Quintum
NOw said king Pellenore I shall put to you two knights / and ye shall
chese which is most worthy / that is Sir Bagdemagus and sir Tor my sone / But
by cause Sire Tor is my sone I may not praise him / but else and he were not my
sone / I durst say that of his age there is not in this land a better knight
than he is nor of better condycions and loathe to do any wrong / and loath to
take any wrong / By my head said Arthur he is a passing good knight / as any
ye spak of this day that wot I well said the king / for I have seen him preued
but he seyth little and he does much more / for I know none in all this court
and he were as well borne on his mother side as he is on your side that is like
him of prowess and of might / And therefore I will have him at this time and
leave sir Bagdemagus till another time / So when they were so chosen by the
assente of all the barons / So were there founden in her syeges every
knights names that here are reherced / and so were they set in their syeges /
whereof sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth that sir Tor was auaunced before him /
and therefore suddenly he departed from the Court and took his squire with him /
and rode long in a forest till they came to a cross and there alyt and said
his prayers deuoutely / The mean while his squire found written upon the
cross that Bagdemagus should never return unto the Court again / till he had
won a knytes body of the round table body for body / lo sir said his squire /
here I find writing of you / therefore I read you return again to the Court /
that shall I never said Bagdemagus till men speak of me great worship / and
that I be worthy to be a knight of the round table / and so he rode forth /
And there by the way he found a brau^che of an holy herb that was the sign of
the Sancgraill / and no knight found such tokens but he were a good liver /
So as sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures / it happed him to come to the
roche / there as the lady of the lake had put Merlyn under the stone / and there
he herd him make great dole / whereof fire Bagdemagus would have helped him and
went unto the great stone / and he was so heavy that an C men might not lift
hit up / when Merlyn wyste he was there he had leave his labor / for all was in
vain / for he might never be helped but by her that put him there / and so
Bagdemagus departed and did many auentures and preued after a full good knight
/ and came again to the Court and was made knight of the round table / So on
the morn there fell new tidings and other auentures

felauship / And at the last they chaced so sore that they slew their horses
underneath them / then were they al three on foot / and ever they saw the
heart before them passing weary and enbusshed / What will we do said king
arthur We are hard bestad / let us goo on foot said king Vryens till we may
mete with some lodging / Then were they ware of the heart that lay on a
great water bank / and a brachet bytynge on his throat and mo other hounds
came after / Then king Arthur blewe the pryse and dyghte the heart / Then
the king looked about the world / and saw before him in a great water a little
ship al apparailled with sylke down to the water / and the ship came right
unto hem and la^ded on the sands / Then Arthur went to the bank and looked
in / and saw none erthely creature therein / Sirs said the king come thens /
and let us see what is in this ship / So they Went in all three and found hit
rychely behanged with clothe of sylke / By then it was derke night / and
there suddenly were about them an C torches set upon all the sides of the

has daily layn a wait with many knights with him / and taken all the
knights in this country to see and aspye her auentures / he has taken hem by
force and brought hem to his prison / and so he took us seueratly as we rode
on our auentures / and many good knytes have dyed in this prison for hongre to

with all there came a damoysel unto Arthur / and asked him what chere / I can
not say said he / sir said she and ye will fight for my lord ye shall be
delyuerd out of prison / and else ye escape never the life / Now said Arthur
that is hard / yet had I lever to fight with a knight than to dye in prison /
with this said Arthur I may be delyuerd and all these prisoners I will do

/ I am the lords daughter of this castle / yet was she falls for she was one of

Morgan le fey had sent him Excalibur and the shethe for to fyte with the

were ready / for our knight is ready in the field / Then sire Arthur mounted
upon horsbak / and there were all the knights and comyns of that country /
and so by all aduyses there were chosen xij good men of the country for to
wait upon the two knights / And right as Arthur was on horsbak / there came a
damoisel from Morgan le fey and brought unto sir Arthur a swerd like unto
Excalibur / and the scaubard / and said unto Arthur Morgan le fey sends here
your swerd for great love / and he thanked her / and wend it had been so / but
she was falls / for the swerd and the scaubard was counterfeet and brutyll and
falls

Capitulum ix
ANd then they dressyd hem on both parties of the field / and let their
horses run so fast that either smote other in the mids of the shield / with
their speres head / that both horse and man went to the earth / And then
they sterte up both / and pulled out their swerdys / the mean while that
they were thus at the bataille came the damoysel of the lake in to the field /
that put Merlyn under the stone / and she came thydder for love of king Arthur
/ for she knew how Morgan le fay had so ordained / that king Arthur should
have been slain that day / and therefore she came to save his life And so they
went egrely to the bataille / and gaf many great strokes / but alweyes Arthurs
swerd bote not like Accolon swerd / But for the most party every stroke that
Accolon gaf he wounded sore Arthur / that it was merueylle he stood / And
alweyes his blood fylle from him fast / when Arthur beheld the ground so sore
bebledde he was desmayed / and then he demed treason that his swerd was
changed / for his swerd boot not still as it was wont to do / therefore he
dredde him sore to be deed / for ever him seemed that the swerd in Accolons hand
was Excalibur / for at every stroke that Accolon stroke he drew blood on
Arthur / Now knight said Accolon unto Arthur keep the well from me / but Arthur
ansuerd not again / and gaf him such a buffet on the helm that he made him
to stoop nygh falling down to the earth / Then sir Acoolon withdrewe him a
little / and came on with Excalibur on high / and smote sir Arthur such a
buffet that he fell nyhe to the earth / Then were they wroth both / and gaf
each other many sore strokes / but alweyes sir Arthur lost so much blood that
it was merueille he stood on his feet / but he was so full of knyghthode that
knyghtly he endured the pain / And sir Accolon lost not a dele of blood /
therefore he waxt passing light / and sir Arthur was passing feeble / and wend
verily to have dyed / but for all that he made countenance as though he might
endure / and held Accolon as short as he might / But Accolon was so bold by
cause of Excalibur that he waxed passing hardy / But all men that beheld him
said they saw never knight fight so well as Arthur did consyderyng the blood
that he bled / So was all the people sorry for him / but the two brethren would
not accord / then alweyes they fought to gyders as fyers knights / and sire
Arthur withdrewe him a little for to rest him / and sire Accolon called him to
bataille and said it is no time for me to suffer the to rest / And therewith he
came fyersly upon Arthur / and sire Arthur was wroth for the blood that he had
lost / and smote Accolon on hyhe upon the helm so mytely that he made him
nyhe to fall to the earth / And therewith Arthurs swerd brast at the cross and
fell in the grass among the blood and the pomel and the sure handels he
held in his hands / when sir arthur saw that / he was in great fere to dye /
but alweyes he held up his shield and lost no ground nor bated no chere /

Capitulum x
Then sire Accolon began with words of treason and said knight thou art
overcome / and may not endure and also thou art wepenles / and thou have
lost much of thy blood / and I am full both to slay the / therefore yield the
to me as recreaunt / Nay said sire Arthur I may not so / for I have promised
to do the bataille to the vttermest by the feythe of my body while me lasts
the life / and therefore I had lever to dye with honor than to live with shame /
And if it were possible for me to dye an C times I had lever to dye so often /
than yield me to the / for though I lack wepen / I shall lack no worship /
And if thou slay me wepenles that shall be thy shame / well said Accolon as for
the shame I will not spare / Now keep the from me for thou art but a deed man
And therewith Accolon gaf him such a stroke that he fell n^ghe to the earth /
and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy / But sire Arthur pressed
unto Accolon with his sheld / and gaf him with the pomel in his hand such a
buffet that he went three strydes abak / when the damoisel of the lake beheld
arthur / how full of prowess his body was and the false treson that was wrout
for him to have had him slain she had great pity that so good a knyt and such
a man of worship should so be destroyed / And at the next stroke sir Accolon
stroke him such a stroke that by the damoysels enchauntement the swerd
Excalibur fell out of Accolons hand to the earth / And therewith all Sire
Arthur lyghtely lepte to hit / and gate hit in his hand / and forthwith al he
knew that it was his suerd Excalibur / and said thou have ben from me al to
long / and much dommage have thou done me / and there with he aspyed the
scaubard hanging by his side / and suddenly he sterte to him and pulled the
scaubard from him and threw hit fro him as fer as he might throw hit / O
knight said Arthur this day have thou done me great dommage with this swerd
/ Now are ye come unto your death / for I shall not waraunt you but ye shall
as well be rewarded with this sword or ever we depart as thou have rewarded me
/ for much pain have ye made me to endure / and much blood have I lost / And
therewith sir Arthur russhed on him with all his might and pulled him to the
earth / and then russhed of his helm / and gaf him such a buffet on the
head that the blood came out at his eres / his nose and his mouth / Now will
I slay the said Arthur / Slay me ye may well said Accolon and it please you /
for ye ar the best knight that ever I fond / and I see well that god is with
you / But for I promised to do this batail said Acoolon to the vttermest and
never to be recreaunt while I lived therefore shall I never yield me with my
mouth / but god do with my body what he will / Then sir Arthur remembrid
him and thought he should have seen this knight / Now tell me said Arthur or
I will slay the / of what country art thou and of what court / Sire knight
said sir Accolon I am of the court of king Arthur / and my name is Accolon of
gaulle Then was Arthur more desmayed than he was before hand For then he
remembryd him of his sister Morgan le fay / and of the enchauntement of the
ship / O sire knight said he I pray you tell me who gaf you this swerd and by
whom ye had it /

Capitulum xj
Then sire Accolon bethoute him and said woe worth this swerd / for by hit
have I geten my death / it may well be / said the king / Now sire said Accolon
I will tell you this swerd has been in my keeping the most party of this
twelve month / And Morgan le fay king Vryens wife sent it me yester day by a
dwerf to this entente that I should slay king Arthur her brother / For ye shall
understand entente to slay king Arthur her brother / for ye shall understand
king Arthur is the man in the world that she most hates by cause he is most
of worship and of prowess of any of her blood / Also she loves me out of
mesure as paramour / and I her again / And if she might bring about to slay
Arthur by her crafts / she would slay her husband king Vryens lyghtely / And
then had she me devised to be king in this land / and so to regne / and
she to be my queen / but that is now done said Accolon / for I am sure of my
death well said sire Arthur / I feel by you ye would have been king in this land
/ It had been great dommage to have destroyed your lord said Arthur / it is
troth said Accolon / but now I have told you truth / wherefore I pray you
tell me of whens ye are and of what court / O Accolon said king Arthur now I
let the wete / that I am king Arthur to whom thou haste done great dommage /
when Accolon herd that / he cried on loud fair sweet lord have mercy on me
/ for I knew not you / O sir Accolon said king Arthur mercy shall thou have /
by cause I feel by thy words at this time / thou know not my person / But
I understand well by thy words that thou have agreed to the death of my person
/ and therefore thou art a traitor / but I wit the the less / for my sister
Morgan le fay by her falls crafts made the to agree and consent to her falls
lusts / but I shall be sore auengyd upon her and I live that all Crystendome
shall speak of it / god knows / I have honored her and worshipped her more
than all my kynne / and more have I trusted her than mine own wife and all my
kynne after /

Then sir Arthur called the kepars of the field and said Syrs comes hyder /
for here are we two knights that have foughten unto a great dommage unto us
both / and like echone of us to have slain other / if it had happed so / And
had any of us known other / here had been no bataille / nor stroke stryken
Then al a loud cried Accolon unto all the knights and men that were then
there gadred to gyder / and said to them in this manner / O lords this noble
knight that I have foughten with all / the which me sore repents is the
most man of prowess of manhood and of worship in the world / for it is him
self king Arthur our al there liege lord and with myshap and with mysaue^ture
have I done this bataill with the king and lord that I am holden with all

Then all the people fell down on her knees and cried king Arthur mercy /
mercy shall ye have said Arthur / here may ye see what auentures befallen
oftyme of erraunte knights how that I have foughten with a knight of mine own
unto my great dommage and his both /

But syrs by cause I am sore hurt and he both / and I had great need of a
little rest / ye shall understand the oppynyon betwixe you two brethren as to
the sire Damas / for whom I have been champyon and won the feld of this
knight / yet will I Judge by cause ye sire Damas are called an org^^lous
knight and full of vylony and not worth of prowess of your deeds / therefore
I will that ye give unto your brother all the hole manoir with the
appertenau^ce under this form / that sir Ontzelake hold the manoir of you /
and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon / for that will become you
better to ride on than upon a courser / Also I charge the sire Damas upon pain
of death / that thou never destresse no knytes erraunte that ride on their
adventure / And also that thou restore these xx knights that thou have long
kept prisoners of all their harneis that they be content for / and if any of

proferre you by the grace of god that ye shall in short time be in ease for
to live as worshipfully as your brother sire Damas / God thank your largeness
of your goodenes and of your bounte / I shall be from hens forward at all times
at your commandment / For sir said sir Ontzelake as god would as I was hurt
but late with an adventures knight through both my thyes that grieved me sore /
and else had I done this bataille with you / god would said Arthur it had been so
/ for then had not I ben hurt as I am / I shall tell you the cause why /
for I had not ben hurt as I am had not ben mine own swerd / that was stolen
from me by treason / And this bataille was ordained before hand to have slain
me / and so it was broute to the purpos by falls treason and by falls
enchauntement / Allas said sir Ontzelake that is greet pity that ever so
noble a man as ye are of your deeds and prowess / that any man or woman myt
find in their hertes to worche any treason against you / I shall reward them
said Arthur in short time by the grace of god Now tell me said Arthur how f^r
am I from Camelot / sir ye are two days journey there fro / I would fayn be at
some place of worship said sir Arthur that I might rest me / Sire said sir
Ontzelake / here by is a rich abbey of your elders fou^dacyon of Nonnes but
three mile hens / So the king took his leave of all the people / and mounted
upon horsbak / and sir Accolon with him / And when they were come to the Abbaye
/ he let fetch leche^ and search his wounds and Accolons both / but sir
Accolon dyed within four days / for he had bled so much blood that he might
not live / but king Arthur was well recouerd / So when Accolon was deed / he
let send him on an horsbere with six knights unto Camelot / and said / bear
him to my sister Morgan le fay / and say that I send her him to a present /
and tell her I have my swerd Excalibur and the scaubard / so they departed
with the body

THe mean while Morgan le fay had wend king Arthur had been deed / so on a
day she aspyed king Vryens lay in his bed slepynge / then she called unto
her a maiden of her counceyll / and said go fetch me my lords swerd for I
saw never better time to slay him than now /

O Madame said the damoysel / and ye slay my lord ye can never escape / Care
not you said Morgan le fay / for now I see my time in the which it is best to
do hit / And therefore hye the fast and fetch me the suerd / Then the
damoisel departed fond sire Vwayne slepynge upon a bed in another chamber
so she went unto ^ire Vwayne and awaked him / and badde him arise and wait
on my lady your mother / for she will slay the king your fader slepynge in

/ and let me dele / Anon the damoysel brought Morgan the swerd with quakynge
hands / and lyghtely took the swerd / and pulled it out / and went boldly
unto the beds side / and awayted how and where she might sle him best / And
as she lift up the swerd to smite / sir Vwayne lepte unto his mother and
caughte her by the hand and said A fend what wilt thou do And thou were not my

that Merlyn was begoten of a deuylle / but I may say an erthely deuylle bare
me / O fair sone Vwayne have mercy upon me / I was tempted with a deuylle /
wherefore I cry the mercy / I will never more do so and save my worship and
discover me not / On this covenant said sir Vwayne I will forgive it you /
so ye will never be about to do such deeds / Nay sone said she / and that
I make you assurance /

Capitulum xiiij
Then came tidings unto Morgan le fay that Accolon was deed / and his body
brought unto the church And how king Arthur had his swerd again / But when
Queen Morgan wyste that Accolon was deed / she was so sorouful that nere her
heart to brast / But by cause she would not it were known / out ward she kept
her countece naun / and maade no semblaunt of sorrow / But well she wyste and
she abode till her brother Arthur came thither / there should no gold goo for her
life

Then she went unto Queen Gweneuer / and asked her leave to ride in to the
countreye / ye may abide said Queen Gweneuer till your brother the king
come home / I may not said Morgan le fay / for I have such hasty tidings /
that I may not tarry / well said Gueneuer ye may depart when ye will / So
erly on the morn or hit was day she took her horse and rode all that day
and most part of the night / And on the morn by none she came to the same
Abbay of Nonnes / where as lay king arthur / and she knowing he was there she
asked where he was / And they ansuerd how he had leyd him in his bed to sleep /
for he had had but little rest these three nyghtes / Well said she I charge you
that none of you awake him till I do / and then she alyghte of her horse / and
thought for to stele awey Excalibur his swerd / and so she went streyghte
unto his chamber / And no man durst dysobeye her commandment / and there
she fond Arthur a sleep in his bed and Excalibur in his right hand naked /
When she saw that she was passing heavy that she might not ^^me by the swerd
without she had awaked him / and then she wist well she had been deed / Then
she took the scaubard and went her wey on horsbak / when the king awoke and
myssed his scaubard / he was wroth / and he asked who had been there / and they
said his sister queen Morgan had been there and had put the scaubard under her
mantel and was gone / Allas said Arthur falsely ye have watched me / Sire said
they all we durst not disobeye your systers commandment A said the king
let fetch the best horse may be found / And bid sire Ontzlake arm him in all
have / and take another good horse and ride with me / So anon the king and
Ontzelake were well armed / and rode after this lady / and so they came by a
cross and found a Cowherd / and they asked the pour man if there came any lady
late riding that way / Sire said this pour man / right late came a lady
riding with a xl horses / and to yonder forest she rode / Then they spored
their horses / and followed fast / And within a while Arthur had a syghte of
Morgan le fay / then he chaced as fast as he might / when she aspyed him
following her / she rode a gretter paas through the forest till she came to a
plain / And when she saw she might not escape she rode unto a lake there by
/ and said what so ever come of me / my brother shall not have this scaubard /
And then she let throw the scauberd in the depest of the water so it sanke
/ for it was heavy of gold and precious stones Then she rode in to a valeye
where many great stones were / And when she saw she must be overtake she
shope her self horse and man by enchaunteme^t unto a great marbyl stone / Anon
with all came Sir Arthur / and sir Ontzelake where as the king might know his
sister and her men / and one knight from another / A said the king here may ye
see the vengeance of god / and now am I sorry that this mysauenture is befalle
/ and then he looked for the scaubard / but it would not be found / so he
returned to the Abbeye there he came fro / So when Arthur was gone / she turned
all in to the likeness as she and they were before / and said syrs now may we
goo where we will /

Capitulum xv
Then said Morgan saw ye Arthur my brother / ye said her knights right well /
and that ye should have found and we might have stered from one stead / for by
his armyuestal contenaunce he would have caused us to have fled I believe you
said Morgan / Anon after as she rode she met a knight ledyng another knyt on
his horse before him bound hand and foot blyndefeld to have drouned him in a
fontayne / when she saw this knyt so bound / she asked him what will ye do
with that knight / lady said he I will drown him / for what cause she asked /
for I fond him with my wife and she shall have the same death anon / that
were pity said Morgan le fay / Now what say ye knyt is it truth yt he says
of you she said to the knight that should be drowned / nay truly madame he seith
not right on me / Of whens be ye said Morgan le fay and of what country / I am
of the Court of king Arthur / and my name is Manassen cosyn unto Acoolon of
gaulle / ye say well said she / and for the love of him ye shall be delyuerd /
and ye shall have your adversary in the same was ye be in / So Manessen was
losed and the other knight bound / And anon Manessen unarmed him and armed
him self in his harneis / and so mounted on horsbak / and the knight before him
and so threw him in to the fontayne and drowned him / And then he rode unto
Morgan again / and asked if she would any thing unto king Arthur / Tell him
that I rescued the / not for the love of him but for the love of Acoolon / and
tell him I fere him not while I can make me and them that been with me in
lykenes of stones / And let him wete I can do much more when I see my time /
And so she departed in to the country of Gorre / and there was she rychely
received / and maade her castles and towns passing strong / for alweyes she
drad much king Arthur / When the king had well rested him at the Abbey he
rode unto Camelot / and fond his queen and his barons right glad of his
coming / And when they herd of his strange auentures as is before reherced /
they all had merueille of the falshede of Morgan le fay / many knights
wysshed her brent / then came Manessen to court and told the king of his
adventure / well said the king she is a kind sister / I shall so be auengid
on her and I live / that all Crystendome shall speak of hit / So on the morn
there came a damoisel from Morgan to the king and she brought with her the
rychest mantel that ever was seen in that Court / for it was set as full of
precious stones as one might stand by another / and there were the rychest
stones that ever the king saw / And the damoysel said your sister sends
you this mantel / and desires that ye should take this gift of her / And in
what thing she has offended you she will amend it at your own pleasyr /
when the king beheld this mantel it pleasyd him much / but he said but little

Capitulum xvj
With that came the damoysel of the lake unto the king and said sir I must
speak with you in pryuyte / say on said the king what ye will / Sir said the
damoysel put not on you this mantel till ye have seen more / and in no wise let
it not come on you nor on no knight of yours till ye command the brynger
thereof to put it upon her / well said king Arthur / It shall be done as ye
counceille me / And then he said unto the damoysel that came fro his sister /
damoisel this mantel that ye have brought me I will see it upon you / sir she
said / it will not biseme me to were a kings garment / by my head said Arthur
/ ye shall were it or it come on my bak or any man's that here is / and so the
king made it to be putt upon her / And forth with all she fell down deed / and
never more spoke word after and burnt to coals / Then was the king wonderly
wroth more than he was to fore hand / and said unto king Vryens my sister
your wife is alwey about to bytraye me / and well I wot outher ye or my neuewe
your sone is of counceille with her to have me destroyed / But as for you said
the king to king Vryens I deem not gretely that ye be of her counceill / For
Acoolon confessyd to me by his own mouth that she would have destroyed you as
well as me there for I hold you excused / But as for your sone Sir Vwayn I hold
him suspect / therefore I charge you put him out of my court / So sir Vwayne
was discharged / And when Sir Gawayne wist that he made him ready to go with
him / and said who so bannyssheth my cosyn germayn / shall bannysshe me So they
two departed / and rode in to a great forest / and so they came to an Abbay of
Monks / and there were well lodged But when the king wist that sir Gawayne
was departed from the Court / there was made great sorrow among all the
estat^s / Now said Gaherys Gawayns brother we have lost two good knights for
the love of one / So on the morn they herd their masses in the abbay / and so
they rode forth till that they came to a great forest / then was sir Gawayne
ware in a valey by a turret xij fair damoysels / and two knights armed on
great horses / and the damoysels went to and fro by a tree / And then was
sir Gawayne ware how there henge a white shield on that tree / And ever as the
damoysels came by it / they spytte upon it / and some threw mire upon the sheld
/

Capitulum xvij
Then sir Gawayne and sir Vwayne went and salewed them / and asked why they
did that despyte to the shield / Syrs saiden the damoysels / we shall tell
you / There is a knight in this country that owes this white sheld and he is
a passing good man of his hands / but he hates al ladies and gentylwymmen /
and therefore we do all this despyte to the shield / I shall say you said sir
gawayne / hit bysemeth euylle a good knight to despise all ladies and
gentilwymmen / And parauentur though he hate you he has sum And parauenture
he loves in sum other places ladies and gentylwymmen / and to be loved
again / and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of / Now what is his
name / sir said they / his name is Marhaus the kings sone of Irelond / I know
him well said sire Vwayne / he is a passing good knight as any is on line / for
I saw him ones preued at a Iustes where many knights were gadered / and that
time there might no man withstand him / A said sir Gawayne Damoysels me
thinks ye are to blame / for hit is to suppose / he that henge that sheld
there / he will not be long there fro / and then may tho knights match him
on horsbak / and that is more your worship than thus / For I will abide no
longer to see a knights sheld dishonored / And therewith sire Vwayne and
Gawayne departed a little fro them / And then were they ware where sire
Marhaus came riding on a great horse streyghte toward them / And when the xij
damoysels saw sir Marhaus they fled in to the turret as they were wild so
that sum of them fell by the wey / Then the one of the knights of the
Toure dressid his shield and said on high sir Marhaus defend the / and so
they ran to gyders that the knyt brake his spear on Marhaus / and Marhaus
smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse back / That saw the
other knight of the turret and dressyd him toward Marhaus / and they met so
egrely to gyders that the knyhht of the Turret was soon smyten down horse and
man stark deed /

Capitulum xviij
ANd then sire Marhaus rode unto his shield / and saw how it was defowled /
and said of this despyte I am a part auengyd / But for her love that gaf me
this white shield I shall were the / and hang mine where thou was and so he
hanged it about his neck / Then he rode straight unto sir Gawayn and to sir
Vwayne / and asked them what they did there / They ansuerd him that they came
from king Arthurs court for to see auentures / well said sire Marhaus here am
I ready an auentures knight that will fulfylle any adventure that ye will
desire / And so departed fro them / to fetch his raunge / let him goo seid
sir Vwayn unto sire Gawayne / for he is a passing good knight as any is
living / I would not by my will that any of us were matched with him / Nay
said sir Gawayne not so / it were shame to us were he not assayed were he never
so good a knight / well said sir Vwayne I will assaye him before you / for I
am more weyker than ye / And if he smite me down / then may ye revenge me /
so these two knights came to gyders with great raundon that sir Vwayne smote
sir Marhaus that his spear braste in pyeces on the shield / and Sire Marhaus
smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth / and hurt sire
Vwayne on the lift side / Then sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward
Gawayne with his spear / and when sir Gawayne saw that / he dressid his sheld
/ and they auentryd their speres / and they came to gyders with all the myte of
their horses / that either knight smote other so hard in mids of their
sheldes / but sir Gawayns spear brak / but sir marhaus spear held / And
therewith sire Gawayne and his horse russhed down to the earth / And lightly sir
Gawayne rose on his feet / and pulled out his swerd / and dressyd him toward
sir Marhaus on foot / and sir marhaus saw that / and pulled out his swerd /
and began to come to sir Gawayne on horsbak / Sire knight said sir gawayn
alyte on foot or else I will slay thy horse / gramercy said sir Marhaus of
your gentylnes ye teache me curtosye / for hit is not for one knyt to be on
foot / and the other on horsbak / and therewith sir Marhaus set his spear
again a tree and alyghte and tayed his horse to a tree / and dressid his shield
/ and either came unto other egerly / and smote to gyders with her swerdes that
her sheldes flewe in cantels / and they brysed their helmes and their hauberkes
and wounded either other / but Sire gawayne fro it passed ix of the clok waxed
ever stronger and stronger / for then hit came to the hour of noone and
thryes his might was encreaced / All this aspyed sir Marhaus and had great
wonder how his might encreaced / and so they wounded other passing sore / And
then when it was past noone / and when it drew toward euensonge sire gawayns
strength febled and waxt passing faynte that uneaths he might dure any
longer / and sir Marhaus was then bygger and bygger / sire knight said sir
Marhaus / I have well felt that ye are a passing good knight and a merueyllous
man of might as ever I felt any / while hit lasts / And our quarrels are not
great / and therefore it were pity to do you hurt / for I feel ye are passing
feeble / A said sir Gawayn gentyl knight ye say the word that I should say / And
therewith they took of their helmes / and either kyssed other / and there they
swore to gyders either to love other as brethren / And sir Marhaus prayed sir
gawayn to lodge with him that night / And so they took their horses / and rode
toward sir Marhaus house / And as they rode by the wey / sir knight said sir
gawayne I have merueylle that so valiant a man as ye be love no ladies ne
damoysels / Sire said sir marhaus they name me wrongfully tho that give me that
name / but well I wot it ben the damoyseles of the Turret that so name me and
other such as they be / Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them /
For they be sorceresses and enchaunters many of them / and be a knyt never so
good of his body and full of prowess as man may be / they will make him a
sta^k coward to have the letter of him / and this is the pryncipal cause that I
hate them and to al good ladies and gentyl wymmen I owe my seruyse as a knight
out to do / As the book reherceth in frensshe there were many knights that
ouermatched sir gawayne for all the thryes might that he had / Sir Lancelot
de lake / sir Trystrams / sir Bors de ganys / sir Percyuale / sir Pellias and
sir Marhaus / these six knytes had the better of sir gawayn Then within a
little while they came to sir Marhaus place / which was in a little pryory / and
there they alyghte and ladies and damoysels unarmed them / and hastily looked to
their hurtes / for they were all three hurt / and so they had all three good
lodging with sir Marhaus and good ^here / for when he wist that they were
king Arthurs sister sons / he maade them all the chere that lay in his power /
and so they sciourned there a vij night / and were well easyd of their wounds
and at the last departed / Now said sire Marhaus we will not depart so
lytely / for I will bring you through the forest And rode day by day well a
seven days or they fond any adventure / At the last they came in to a great
forest that was named the countreye and foreste of Arroy and the country of
strange auentures / In this country said sir Marhaus came never knight syn it
was crystened / but he fond strange auentures / and so they rode / and came
in to a deep valey full of stones / and there by they saw a fair streme of water
/ above there by was the head of the streme a fair fontayne / and three damoysels
sitting thereby / And then they rode to them / and either salewed other / and
the eldest had a garland of gold about her head / and she was three score
winter of age / or more and her here was white under the garland / The second
damoysel was of thyrtty winter of age with a serkelet of gold about her head /
The third damoysel was but xv year of age / and a garland of flowers about her
head / when these knights had so behold them / they asked hem the cause why
they sat at that fontayne / we be here said the damoysels for this cause / if
we may see any erraunt knights to teache hem unto strange auentures / and ye
be three knights that seken auentures and we be three damoysels / and therefore
each one of you must chese one of us / And when ye have done so / we will
led you unto three hyhe ways / and there each of you shall chese a wey and his
damoysel with him / And this day twelu^ monethe ye must mete here ageyn / and
god send you your lives / and there to ye must plyte your truth / this is
well said said sir Marhaus

Capitulum xx
NOw shall eueryche of us chese a damoysel / I shall tell you said sire
Vwayne I am the youngest and most weykest of you both / therefore I will have the
eldest damoysel / for she has seen much and can best help me when I have
need / for I have most need of help of you both / Now said sir Marhaus I
will have the damoysel of thyrtty winter age for she falls best to me / well
said sire gawayne / I thank you for ye have left me the youngest and the
fairest / and she is most leuest to me / Then every damoysel took her knight
by the raynes of his brydel / and brought him to the three ways / and there
was their oath made to mete at the fontayne that day twelve month and they
were living / and s^o they ^yst and departed / and eueryche knight selte his
lady behynd him / and sir Vwayne took the wey that lay west And sir Marhaus
took the wey that lay southe / and sir gawayne took the weye that lay north /
Now will we begin at sir gawayne that held that wey till that he came unto a
fair manoir where dwelled an old knight and a good householder / and there sir
Gawayn asked the knight if he knew any auentures in that country / I shall
show you sum to morn said the old knight / and that merueyllous / So on
the morn they rode in to the forest of adventures till they came to a launde /
and there by they fond a cross / and as they stood and houed / there came by them
the fairest knight and the semelyest man that ever they saw / making the
grettest dole that ever man made / And then he was ware of sir gawayn and
salewed him and praid god to send him much worship / As to that said sir
gawayn gramercy / Also I pray to god that he send you honor and worship / A
said the knight I may lay that on side / for sorrow and shame comes to me
after worship /

Capitulum xxj
ANd there with he passed unto the one side of the launde / And on the other
side saw sir Gawayne x knytes that houed still and make ^em ready with her
sheldes and speres against that one knight that came by sir gawayn / Then this
one knight auentryd a great spear / and one of the x knights encountered with
him / but this woeful knight smote him so hard that he fell over his horse
taylle / So this same dolorous knyt served hem al / that at the lest way he
smote down horse and man / and all he did with one spear / and so when they
were all x on foot / they went to that one knight / and he stood stone still /
and suffered hem to pulle him down of his horse / and bound him hand and foot
/ and tayed him under the horse belly / and so led him with hem / O Ihesu said
sir gawayne this is a dooleful syghte / to see the yonder knight so to be
entreted / and it seems by the knight that he suffr^th hem to bind him so /
for he makes no resystence / No said his host that is truth / for and he
would they al were to weyke so to do him / Sir said the damoysel unto sir
Gawayn / me seems hit were your worship to help that dolorous knight / for
me thinks he is one of the best knights that ever I saw / I would do for
him said sire gawayn but hit seems he will have no help / then said the
damoysel me thinks ye have no lust to help him / Thus as they talked they
saw a knyte on the other side of the launde al armed ^auf the head / And on
the other side there came a dwerf on horse bak all armed sauf the head with a
great mouth / and a short nose / And when the dwerf came nyghe he said where
is the lady should mete us here / and there with all she came forth out of the
wood / And then they began to strive for the lady / For the knight said he
would have her / and the dwerf said he would have her / will we do well said the
dwerf / yonder is a knight at the cross / let us put it both upon him / and
as he demeth so shall it be / I will well said the knight / and so they went
all three unto sire gawayn and told him wherefore they strofe / well syrs said he
will ye put the matter in my hand / ye they said both / Now damoysel said sir
gawayn ye shall stand betwixe them both / and whether ye list better to go to /
he shall have you / And when she was set bitwene them both she left the
knight and went to the dwerf / and the dwerf took her and went his way
singing / and the knight went his wey with great morning / Then came there
two knights all armed and cried on high Sire gawayn / knight of king
Arthurs make the ready in all have and Just with me / so they ran to gyders
that either fell down / and then on foot they drew their swerdes and did
full actually / the mean while the other knight went to the damoysel / and
asked her / why she abode with that knight / and if ye would abide with me / I
will be your feythful knight and with you will I be said the damoysel / for
with sir Gawayn I may not find in mine heart to be with him / For now here was
one knyt scomfyte x knights / And at the last he was cowardly led awey / and
therefore let us two goo whylest they fight / and sire Gawayn fought with that
other knight long / but at the last they accorded both / And then the knight
prayed sir gawayn to lodge with him that night / So as sire Gawayn went with
this knight he asked him what knight is he in this country that smote down
the ten knights / for when he had done so manfully he suffered hem to bind him
hand and foot / and so led him awey / A said the knight that is the best
knight I trow in the world / and the most man of prowess / and he bath be
served so as he was e^ne more than x times / and his name hyghte sir Pelleas /
and he loves a great lady in this country and her name is Ettard / and so
when he loved her there was cried in this country a greet Iustes three days /
And all the knights of this country were there and gentylwymmen / And who
that preued him the best knight should have a passing good swerd and a Serklet
of gold and the serklet the knight should give hit to the fairest lady that was
at the Iustes / And this knight sire Pelleas was the best knight that was
there / and there were five honderd knights / but there was never man that
ever sire Pelleas met with all / but he stroke him down or else from his horse /
And every day of three days he struck down twenty knights / therefore they gaf
him the pryse / and forth with all he went there as the lady Ettard was / and
gaf her the serklet / and said openly / she was the fairest lady that there was
/ and that would he preue upon any knight that would say nay /

Ca xxij
ANd so he chose her for his sovereign lady / and never to love other but her
/ but she was so proud that she had scorn of him and said that she would never
love him thou he would dye for her / wherefore al ladies and gentylwymmen had
scorn of her that she was so proud / for there were fayrer than she / and
there was none that was there but and sir Pelleas would have proferd hem love
they would have loved him for his noble prowess / and so this knyt promised the
lady ettard to follow her in to this country / and nener to leave her till she
loved him / and thus he is here the most party nyghe her and lodged by a
pryory / and every weke she sends knights to fyte with him / And when he
has put hem to the wers than will he suffer hem wylfully to take him prisoner
by cause he would have a syghte of this lady / And alweyes she does him great
despyte / for some time she makes her knights to taye him to his horse taylle
and some to bynd him under the horse belly Thus in the most shamefullest wise
that she can think he is brought to her / And all she does hit for to cause
him to leave this countreye and to leave his loving / But all this can not make
him to leave / for and he would have fought on foot he might have had the
better of the ten knights as well on foot as on horsbak / Allas said sir
gawayn it is great pity of him / And after this night I will seek him to
morrow in this forest to do him all the help I can / So on the morn sir
gawayne took his leave of his host sire Carados and rode in to the forest /
And at the last he met with sir Pelleas making great moon out of mesure /
so each of hem salewed other / and asked him why he made such sorrow / And as
it is above reherced / sire Pelleas told sire Gawayne / but alweyes I suffer
her knights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterdaye in trust at the last to win her love / for she knows well all her knights should not lyghtely win
me / and me list to fight with them to the vttermest / Wherefore and I loved
her not so sore I had lever dye an honderd times / and I might dye so often
rather than I would suffer that despyte / but I trust she will have pity upon
me at the last / for love causes many a good knight to suffer to have his
intent / but allas I am unfortunate / And there with he maade so great dole and
sorrow that uneath he might hold him on horsback Now said sire gawayne leave
your morning and I shall promise you by the feythe of my body to do all
that lies in my power to get you the love of your lady / and there to I will
plyte you my truth / A said sir Pelleas of what Court are ye tell me I
pray you my good friend / And then sir gawayne said I am of the court of
king Arthur / and his susters sone / and king Lot of Orkeney was my fader /
and my name is sire Gawayne / And then he said my name is Sire Pelleas borne
in the Isles / and of many Isles I am lord / and never have I loved lady nor
damoysel till now in an unhappy time / and sir knight syn ye are so nyghe
cosyn unto king Arthur and a kings sone / therefore bytraye me not but help me
/ for I may never come by her but by sum good knight / for she is in a
strong castle here fast by within this four mile / and over all this country
she is lady of / And so I may never come to her presence / but as I suffer her
knights to take me / and but if I did so that I might have a syghte of her I
had been deed long or this time / and yet fair word had I never of her / but
wha^ I am brought to fore her she rebukes me in the fowlest manner / And then
they take my horse and harneis and putten me out of the yates / and she will
not suffer me to ete nor drink / and alweyes I offer me to be her prisoner /
but that she will not suffer me / for I would desire no more what pains so
ever I had / so that I myte have a syghte of her daily / well said sir gawayne
/ All this shall I amend and ye will do as I shall deuyse / I will have your
horse and your armor / and so will I ride unto her castle and ^elle her that I
have slain you / and so shall I come withynne her to cause her to cherysshe me
/ And then shall I do my true part that ye shall not faylle to have the
love of her

Capitulum xxiij
ANd there with sir Gawayne plyghte his truth unto sir Pelleas to be true and
feythful unto him / so each one plyghte their truth to other / and so they
changed horses and harneis / and sire Gawayn departed / and came to the castle
where as stood the pauelions of this lady without the yate / And as soon as
Ettard had aspyed sir Gawayn she fled in toward the castle / sire Gawayn spak
on high / and badde her abide / for he was not sire Pelleas / I am another
knight that have slain sir Pelleas / do of your helm said the lady Ettard
that I may see your vysage / And so when she saw that it was not sir Pelleas
/ she made him alyghte / and led him unto her castle / and asked him feyth
fully / whether he had slain sir Pelleas / and he said her ye / and told her
his name was sire gawayn of the court of king Arthur and his sister sone /
Truly said she that is great pity for he was a passing good knight of his
body / but of al men on live I hated him most / for I could never be quyte of
him / And for ye have slain him / I shall be your woman and to do any thing
that might please you / So she made sir Gawayne good chere / Then sir
gawayn said that he loved a lady / and by no mean she would love him / She is
to blame said Ettard and she will not love you / for ye that be so well borne
a man and such a man of prowess / there is no lady in the world to good for
you / will ye said sire Gawayne promise me to do all that ye may by the
feythe of your body to get me the love of my lady / ye sire said she / and
that I promise you by the feythe of my body / Now said sire Gawayne it is your
self that I love so well / therefore I pray you hold your promise / I may not
chese said the lady Ettard / but if I should be forsworn / and so she granted
him to fulfylle all his desire /

So it was then in the month of May that she and sire Gawayn went out of
the castle and souped in a pauelione / and there was made a bed / and there
sire gawayne and the lady Ettard went to bed to gyders / and in another
pauelione she laid her damoysels / and in the third pauelione she leyd part of
her knights for then she had no dread of sir Pelleas / And there sire gawayn
lay with her in that pauelione two days and two nyghtes / And on the third day
in the morning erly sir Pelleas armed him / for he had never slepte syn sir
Gawayn departed from him / for sir Gawayne had promised him by the feythe of
his body to come to him unto his pauelione by that pryory within the space of a
day and a night Then sire Pelleas mounted upon horsbak / and came to the
pauelions that stood without the castle / and fond in the first pauelione three
knights in three beds / and three squyers lyggynge at their feet / then
went he to the second pauelione and fond four gentyl wymmen lyenge in four
beds / and then he yede to the third pauelion and fond sir gawayn lyggyng
in bed with his lady Ettard and either clyppyng other in arms / and when he
saw that his heart well nyghe brast for sorou / and said Allas that ever a knyt
should be found so falls / and then he took his horse and myt not abide no
longer for pure sorrow / And when he had ryden nyghe half a mile he turned
again and thought to slay hem both / And when he saw hem both so lie
slepynge fast / uneath he might hold him on horsbak for sorrow / and said
thus to him self / though this knight be never so falls I will never slay him
slepynge / For I will never destroy the high order of knygthode / and
therewith he departed again And or he had ryden half a mile he returned
again / and thought then to slay hem both / making the grettest sorou
that ever man made / And when he came to the pauelions / he tayed his horse
unto a tree / and pulled out his swerd naked in his hand / and went to them
there as they lay / and yet he thought it were shame to slay them slepynge /
and laid the naked swerd overthwart both their throtes / and so took his
horse and rode his way

And when sire Pelleas came to his pauelions he told his knights and his
squyers how he had sped / and said thus to them for your true and good seruyse
ye have done me I shall give you all my goods / for I will goo unto my bed
and never arise until I am deed / And when that I am deed / I charge you that
ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her betwyxe two silver dysshes /
and tell her how I saw her lie with the false knight Sir Gawayne / Right so
sir Pelleas unarmed him self and went unto his bed making merueyllous dole
and sorrow /

Then sire Gawayne and Ettard awoke of her sleep / and fond the naked swerd
overthwart their throtes / then she knew well it was sir Pelleas swerd /
Allas said she to sir Gawayne ye have bitrayed me and sir Pelleas both / for
ye told me ye had slain him / and now I know well it is not so he is on live
/ And if sire Pelleas had been as vncurteis to you as ye have been to him ye
had been a deed knight / but ye have deceived me and bytrayd me falsely / that
al ladies and damoysels may beware by you and me / And there with sir gawayn
made him ready / and went in to the forest / So it happed then that the
damoysel of the lake Nymue met with a knight of sir Pelleas that went on
his foot in the forest making great dole / and she asked him the cause And so
the woeful knight told her how his master and lord was bitrayed through a
knight and a lady / and how he will never arise out of his bed till he be deed
/ Bring me to him said she anon / and I will waraunt his life he shall not dye
for love / and she that has caused him so to love / she shall be in as evil
plyte as he is or it be long to / for it is no Joy of such a proud lady that
will have no mercy of such a valiant knight / anon that knyte brought her
unto him And when she saw him lie in his bed / she thought she saw never
so lykely a knight / and there with she threw an enchauntement upon him / and
he fell on sleep / And there while she rode unto the lady Ettard / and charged
no man to awake him till she came again / So within two hours she brought
the lady Ettard thydder / and both ladies fond him on sleep / loo said the
damoysel of the lake ye ought to be ashamed for to murdre such a knight / And
therewith she threw such an enchauntement upon her that she loved him sore /
that well nyghe she was out of her mind / O lord Ihesu said the lady Ettard /
how is it befallen unto me / that I love now him that I have most hated of any
man alive / that is the right wys Judgment of god said the damoysel / And
then anon sir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard / And when he saw her /
he knew her / and then he hated her more than any woman alive / and said
awey traitresse come never in my sit And when she herd him say so / she wept
and made great sorou out of mesure

Sire knyhht Pelleas said the damoysel of the lake / take your horse / and come
forth with me out of this country / and ye shall love a lady that shall love
you / I will well said sir Pelleas / for this lady Ettard has done me great
despyte and shame / and there he told her the beginning and ending / And how
he had purposed never to have arysen till that he had been deed / And now
such grace god has sent me / that I hate her as much as ever I loved her
thanked be our lord Ihesus / Thank me said the damoysel of the lake anon
sire Pellas armed him and took his horse and commanded his men to bring after
his pauelions and his stuff where the damoysel of the lake would assign / so

then his horse was led in to the stable / and he and the damoysel were
brought in to the halle / and there stood a mighty duke and many goodely men

/ And therefore ease thy self this night as well as thou may / for as to morn
I and my six sons shall match with you / Is there no remedy but that I must
have a do with you and your vj sons at ones said sir Marhaus / No said the

the duke sent unto sire Marhaus and bad make him ready / And so sir Marhaus
arose and armed him / and then there was a mass song before him and brake his

Then came the four sons by couple / and two of them brake their speres /
and so did the other two / And all this while sire marhaus touched hem not /
Then sir marhaus* ran to the duke / and smote him with his spear that horse

then some of his sons recouerd / and would have set upon sir Marhaus / then
sir Marhaus said to the duke seace thy sons or else I will do the vttermest to

Then sir Marhaus departed and within two days his damoysel brought him where
as was a great tornement that the lady de Vawse had cried / And who that did
best should have a rich serklet of gold worth a thousand besauntes / And there
sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renomed / and had sometime down forty
knights / and so the serklet of gold was rewarded him / Then he departed
fro thens with great worship / And so within seven nyghtes his damoysel

had another brother in Cornewaille that hyghte Taulas that sir Trystram slew
when he was out of his mind / So this Earl maade his complaynte unto sire
Marhaus that there was a gyaunt by him that destroyed al his lands / and how
he durst nowhere ride nor goo for him / Sir said the knight whether uses he
to fight on horsbak or on foot / nay said the earl there may no horse here
him / well said sir marhaus then will I fight with him on foot / So on the
morn sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his men might bring him where as
the gyau^t was / and so he was / for he saw him sytte under a tree of hoolly /
and many clubbes of iron and gysarms about him So this knight dressid him to
the giant putiyng his sheld before him / and the giant took an Iron clubbe in
his hand / and at the first stroke he clafe sire Marhaus shield in ij pyeces

last sir Marhaus smote of his right arm above the elbowe / then the giant
fled and the knight after him / and so he drofe him in to a water / but the
giant was so high that he might not wade after him / And then sir Marhaus
made the earl Fergus man to fetch him stones / and with tho stones the knight
gaf the gyaunt many sore knockes / till at the last he made him fall down in

giants castle / and there he delyuerd xxiiij ladies and twelve knytes out of
the giants prison / and there he had great richesse without nombre / so that
the days of his life he was never pour man / then he returned to the earl
Fergus / the which thanked him gretely / and would have given him half his
lands but he would none take / So sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nyghe half

that night sir Vwayn had great chere / And on the morn he arose erly and herd
mass and brake his fast / and so he rode unto the plain without the gates
where houed the two brethren abiding him / So they rode to gyders passing
sore that sire Edward and sir Hue brake their speres upon sir Vwayne And sir
Vwayne smote sire Edward that he fell over his horse and yet his spear brast
not / And then he spored his horse and came upon sir Hue and ouerthrewe him /
but they soon recouerd and dressid their sheldes and drew their suerdes and
bad sire Vwayne alyghte and do his bataill to the vttermest / Then sir Vwayn
deuoyded his horse suddenly / and put his shield before him and drew his sword /
and so they dressyd to gyders and either gaf other such strokes / and there
these two brethren wounded sir Vwayne passing grievously that the lady of the
roche wend he should have dyed / And thus they fought to gyders five hours as
men raged out of reason / And at the last sir Vwayne smote sir Edward upon
the helm such a stroke that his swerd kerued unto his canel bone / and then
sir Hue abated his courage / but sir Vwayn pressed fast to have slain him /
That saw sir Hue he kneled down and yield him to sir Vwayne and he of his
gentilnesse received his swerd and took him by the hand and went in to the
castle to gyders / then the lady of the roche was passing glad and the other
brother made great sorrow for his broders death / then the lady was restored
of al her lands / and sir Hue was commanded to be at the Court of king
Arthur at the next feast of penthecost / So sir Vwayn dwelt with the lady nyghe
half a year / for it was long or he might be hole of his great hurtes / and
so when it drew nygh the term day that sir gawayn sir Marhaus and sire
Vwayne should mete at the cross way / then every knight drew him thither to
hold his promise that they had made / and sir Marhaus and sir Vwayne brought
their damoysels with them / but sir Gawayn had lost his damoysel as it is before
reherced

Capitulum xxix
Right so at the twelve months end they met all three knights at the
fontayne and their damoisels but the damoysel that sir gawayn had could say
but little worship of him / so they departed from the damoysels and roode
through a great forest / and there they met with a messager that came fro king
Arthur that had sought them well nyhe a xij month thorou out al England /
walys and Scotland / and charged if ever he might find sire Gawayn and sire
Vwayn to bring hem to the court again / And then were they al glad / and
so prayed they sire Marhaus to ride with hem to the kings court / And so
within twelve days they came to Camelot / and the king was passing glad of
their coming and so was all the Court / then the king made hem to swear
upon a book to tell him all their adventures that had befalle hem that
twelve monethe and so they did / And there was sir Marhaus well known / for
there were knights that he had matched before time / and he was named one of the
best knights living / Again the feast of pentecost came the damoysel of the
lake and brought with her sir Pelleas / and at that hyhe feast there was great
Iustynge of knights / and of al knights that were at that Iustes / sir
Pelleas had the pryse / and sir Marhaus was named the next / but sir Pelleas
was so strong / there might but few knights sytte him a buffet with a spear
/ And at that next feast sir pelleas and sir marhaus were made knights of the
table round For there were two seges void / for two knights were slain that
twelve month / and great joy had king Arthur of sire Pelleas and of sire
Marhaus / but Pelleas loved never after sire Gawayne but as he spared him for
the love of king arthur / But oftymes at Iustes and turnementes sire Pelleas
quyte sire Gawayn / for so it reherceth in the book of Frensshe / So sire
Trystram many days after faughte with sire Marhaus in an yland / and there
they did a great bataylle / but at the last sire Trystram slew him / so sire
Trystram was wounded that uneath he might recover and lay at a nonnery half a
year / and sire Pelleas was a worshipful knight / and was one of the four that
encheued the sancgreal / and the damoysel of the lake made by her means that
never he had adoo with sire lancelot de lake / for where sire lancelot was at
any Iustes / or any tornement / she would not suffer him be there that day /
but if it were on the side of sire lancelot /

Explicit liber quartus
Incipit liber quintus
When king Arthur had after long werre rested / and held a Ryal feeste and
table round with his alyes of kings / princes / and noble knights all of the
round table / there came in to his halle he sitting in his throne Ryal xij
au^cyen men / berynge each of them a branch of Olyue in token that they came
as Embassatours and messager^ fro the Emperor Lucyus / which was called at
that time / Dictatour or procutour of the publyke well of Rome / which said
messagers after their entryng and coming in to the presence of king Arthur did
to him their obeyssau^ce in making to him reverence said to him in this wise /
The high and mighty Emperor Lucyus sends to the king of Bretayne gretyng /
co^mau^dyng the to knouleche him for thy lord / and to send him the truage due
of this Royamme unto thempyre / which thy fader and other to fore thy
precessours have paid as is of record / And thou as rebelle not knowing him as
thy sovereign withholdest and reteynest contrary to the statutes and decrees
maade by the noble and worthy Julius Cezar conqueror of this Royame / and
first Emperor of Rome / And if thou refuse his demand and commandment /
know thou for certain that he shall make strong werre against the / thy
Royames and lands / and shall chastyse the and thy subgettys / that it shall be
ensample perpetuel unto all kings and princes / for to deny their truage
unto that noble empire which domyneth upon the universal world / Then when
they had showed theffecte of their message / the king commanded them to
withdraw them And said he should take auyce of counceylle and give to them an
ansuere / Then sum of the young knights heryng this their message would
have run on them to have slain them saying that it was a rebuke to all the
knights there being present to suffer them to say so to the king / And anon
the king commanded that none of them upon pain of death to myssaye them ne
do them any harm / and commanded a knight to bring them to their lodging
/ and see that they have all that is necessary and requysyte for them / with
the best chere / and that no deyntee be spared / For the Romans ben great
lords / and though their message please me not ne my court yet I must remember
mine honor / After this the king let call all his lords and knights of the
round table to counceyl upon this matter / and desired them to say their aduys
/ then sir Cador of Cornewaile spacke first and said Sire this message
lyketh me well / for we have many days rested us and have been idle / and now I
hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans where I doubt not we shall get
honor / I believe well said Arthur that this matter pleases the well / but these
ansuers may not be ansuerd / for the demand greueth me sore / For truly I will
never pay truage to Rome / wherefore I pray you to counceylle me / I have
understand that Bellinus and Brenius kings of Bretayne have had thempyre in
their hands many days / And also Constantyn the sone of Heleyne / which is
an open euydence that we owe no trybute to Rome / But of right we that been
descended of them have right to claim the title of thempyre /

Capitulum Secundum
Then ansuerd king Anguysshe of Scotland / Sir ye ought of right to be
above al other kings / for unto you is none like ne pareylle in Crystendome /
of knythode ne of dygnyte / and I counceylle you never to obey the Romans /
for when they reigned on us / they destressyd our elders / and put this land
to great extorcions and taylles / wherefore I make here mine auowe to avenge me
on them / and for to strength your quarrel I shall furnysshe xy M good men of
war and wage them on my costs / which shall awayte on you with my self when
it shall please you / and the king of little Bretayne granted him to the same
xxx M / wherefore king Arthur thanked them / And then every man agreed to make
war / and to aid after their power / that is to wete the lord of westwalis
promised to bring xxx M men And sir Vwayne / sire Ider his sone with their
cosyns promised to bring xxx M / then sire lancelot with all other
promised in like wise every man a great multitude / And when king Arthur
understood their courages and good wylles / he thanked them hertely / and
after let call thembassatours to here their ansuere / And in presence of
all his lords and knights he said to them in this wise / I will that ye
return unto your lord and procurour of the common well for the Romans / and
say ye to him Of his demand and commandment I set nothing / And that I
know of no truage ne trybute that I owe to him / ne to none erthely prince /
Christian ne hethen / but I pretend to have and occupye the soueraynte of
thempyre / wherein I am entytled by the right of my predecessors sometime kings
of this land / and say to him that I am delybered and fully concluded to goo
with mine army with strength and power unto Rome by the grace of god to take
possession in thempyre / and subdue them that been rebelle / wherefore I
command him and all them of Rome that incontinent they make to me their
homage and to knouleche me for their Emperor and governor upon pain that
shall ensiewe / And then he commanded his tresorer to give to them great
and large yeftes / and to pay all their dispencys / and assygned sire Cador
to conueye them out of the land / and so they took their leave and departed /
and took their shyppynge at Sandwyche / and passed forth by flaundrys /
Almayn / the montayns / and all ytalye until they came unto Lucius / And after
the reverence made / they made relacyon of their ansuer like as ye to fore have
herd / when the emperor Lucyus had well understand their credence / he was sore
meued as he had been al araged / and said / I had supposed that Arthur would have
obeyed to my commandment / and have served you him self / as him well bysemed
or any other king to do / O sire said one of the senators late be such vayn
words / for we late you wete that I and my felawes were full sore aferd to
behold his countenance / I fere me ye have made a rod for your self / for
he entendeth to be lord of this empire which sore is to be doubted if he come
/ for he is al another man than ye wene / and holds the most noble court of
the world all other kings ne princes may not compare unto his noble mayntene
/ On new years day we saw him in his estate which was the ryallest that
ever we saw / for he was served at his table with ix kings / and the noblest
felauship of other princes lords and knights that been in the world / and
every knight approved and like a lord and holds table round And in his
person the most manly man that lives / and is like to conquer all the
world / for unto his courage it is to little / wherefore I advise you to keep well
your marches and straytes in the montayns / For certainly he is a lord to be
doubted / Well said Lucius before Eester I suppose to pass the mou^tayns and
so forth in to france / and there byreue him his lands with Ianeweyes and
other mighty warryours of Tuskane and lombardye / And I shall send for them
all that been subgettys and alyed to the^pyre of Rome to come to mine aid / and
forthwith sent old wise knights unto these countrayes following / first to
ambage and arrage / to Alysaundrye / to ynde. to hermonye / where as the river
of Eufrates renneth in to Asye / to Auffryke / and Europe the large / to
ertayne and Elamye to Arabye / Egypt and to damask / to damyete and Cayer /
to Capadoce / to tarce / Turkye / pounce / and pampoylle / to Surrye and
gallacye / And all these were subgette to Rome and many moo / as Greece /
Cypres / Macydone / Calabre / Cateland / portyngale with many thousands of
spaynardys / Thus all these kings / dukes / and admyrals assembled about
Rome with xvj kings attones with great multitude of people / when the emperor
understood their coming / he made ready his Romans / and all the people between
him and Flaunders Also he had gotten with him fyfty Geaunts which had been
engendered of fendys And they were ordained to guard his person / and to break
the frounte of the bataylle of king Arthur /

And thus departed fro Rome and came down the montayns for to destroy the
lands that Arthur had conquered and came unto Coleyne / and byseged a Castle
there by / and wanne it soon and stuffed hit with two honderd sarasyns or
Infydeles and after destroyed many fair countrees / which Arthur had won of
king Claudas / And thus Lucius came with all his host which were disperplyd
lx mile in bread / and commanded them to mete with him in Burgoyne / for he
purposed to destroy the Royame of lytyl Bretayne /

Capitulo tercio
NOw leave we of Lucius the emperor and speak we of king Arthur / that
commanded all them of his retenue to be ready at vtas of hyllary for to
hold a parliament at york / And at that parliament was concluded to areste all
the nauye of the land and to be ready within xv days at sand wyche / and there
he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer thempyre which he ought to
have of right / And there he ordained two governors of this Royame that is to
say Sire Bawdewyn of Bretayne for to counceille to the best and sir Constantyn
sone to sire Cador of Cornewaylle / which after the death of Arthur was king
of this Royamme / And in the presence of all his lords he resyned the rule of
the royame and Gweneuer his queen to them / wherefore sire lancelot was wroth
/ for he left sire Trystram with king mark for the love of beal Isoulde /
Then the queen Gweneuer made great sorrow for the departing of her lord and
other / and swouned in such wise that the ladies bare her in to her chamber
Thus the king with his great army departed leuyng the queen and Royamme in the
governance of sire Bawduyn and Constantyn / And when he was on his horse / he
said with an hyhe voys if I dye in this journey I will that sire Constantyn be
mine heyer and king crowned of this royame as next of my blood / And after
departed and entered in to the sea at Sandwyche with all his army with a
greet multitude of ships / galeyes / Cogges / and dromoundes / sayllynge on

ANd as the king lay in his caban in the ship / he fill in a slomerynge and
dremed a merueyllous dreme / him seemed that a dredeful dragon did drown much
of his people / and he came fleing out of the west / and his head was enameled
with asure / and his sholders shone as gold / his belly like maylles of a
merueyllous hew / his taylle full of tatters / his feet full of fine sable / and
his claws like fine gold And an hydous flamme of fire flewe out of his mouth
/ like as the land and water had flammed all of fire / After him seemed there
came out of thoryent / a grymly bore al blak in a cloud / and his paws as
bygge as a post / he was rugged lokynge roughly / he was the foulest be that
ever man saw / he rored and romed so hydously that it were merueill to here /
Then the dredeful dragon auaunced him and came in the wind like a fawcon
gyuynge great strokes on the bore / and the bore hytte him again with his
grysly tuskes / that his breast was al blody / and that the hot blood made all
the sea reed of his blood /

Then the dragon flewe awey al on an heyte / and came down with such a
swough and smote the bore on the rydge which was x foot large fro the head to
the taylle / and smote the bore all to powdre both flesh and bonys / that it
flytteryd al abroad on the sea / And therewith the king awoke anon / and was
sore abashed of this dreme / And sent anon for a wise philosopher /
commaundynge to tell him the sygnyfycacion of his dreme / Sire said the
philosopher / the dragon that thou dremedest of / betokens thyn own person
that sayllest here / and the colors of his wings ben thy Royames that thou
haste won / And his taylle which is al to tatterd sygnefyeth the noble
knights of the round table And the bore that the dragon slough coming fro the
clouds / betokens some tyrant that tormenteth the people / or else thou art
like to fight with sum Geaunt thy self / being horrible and abhomynable
Whoos pere ye saw never in your days / wherefore of this dredeful dreme doubt
the no thing / but as a Conqueror come forth thy self / Then after this

Flaundres / and when they were there he fond many of his great lords ready /

Then came to him an husbond man of the country / and told him how there was
in the country of Constantyn beside Bretayne a great gyaunt which had slain
murdered and devoured much people of the countreye and had been sustained seven
year with the children of the comyns of that land / in so much that all the
children ben all slain and destroyed / and now late he has taken the
duchess of Bretayne as she rode with her meyne / and has led her to his
lodging which is in a montayne for to rauysshe and lie by her to her lives
end / and many people followed her moo than v C / but all they might not
rescowe her / but they left her shrykyng and cryenge lamentably / wherefore I
suppose that he has slain her in fulfyllynge his foul lust of lechery / She
was wife unto thy Cosyn sire Howel / whom we call full nyhe of thy blood / Now
as thou a ryghtful king have pity on this lady / and revenge us al as thou
art a noble conqueror / Alas said king Arthur / this is a great meschyef / I
had lever than the best Royame that I have / that I had been a forlonge way to
fore him for to have rescowed that lady / Now felawe said king Arthur can
thou bring me there as this gyaunt haunteth / ye sire said the good man / ^oo
yonder where as thou see tho two great fyres / there shall thou find him /
and more tresour than I suppose is in all France / when the king had
understood this pyteous caas / he returned in to his tente / Then he called
to him sire kaye and sire Bedewere / and commanded them secretly to make ready
horse and harneis for him self and them tweyne / For after euensonge he would
ride on pylgremage with them two only unto saint Mychels mount / And then
anon he maad him ready / and armed him at all points / and took his horse and
his sheld / And so they three departed thens and rode forth as fast as ever
they myt till that they came to the forlond of that mount And there they alyghted
/ and the king commanded them to tarry there / for he would him self goo up in
to that mount And so he ascended up in to that hylle till he came to a great
fire / and there he fond a careful wydowe wryngynge her hands and making
great sorrow sitting by a grave new made / And then king Arthur falewed
her / and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentacion / to whom she
ansuerd and said Sire knight speak soft / for yonder is a devil if he here
the speak / he will come and destroy the / I hold the unhappy what do thou
here in this mountain / For if ye were such fyfty as ye be / ye were not able
to make resystence against this devil / here lies a duchess deed the which
was the fairest of all the world wife to sire Howel / du^ of Bretayne / he has
murthred her in forcynge her / and has slytte her unto the nauyl / Dame said
the king / I come fro the noble Conqueroure king Arthur for to treat with
that tyrant for his lyege people / Fie on such treatys said she / he sets
not by the king ne by no man else / But and if thou have brought Arthurs wife
dame Gweneuer / he shall be gladder than thou had given to him half
france / Beware approach him not to nygh / for he has vaynquysshed xv kings
/ and has maade him a cote full of precious stones enbrowdred with their
^erdes / which they sent him to have his love for sauacion of their people at
this last Crystemasse / And if thou wylt / speak with him at yonder great fire
at souper / well said Arthur I will accomplysshe my message for all your ferdful
words / and went forth by the creast of that hylle / and saw where he satte
at souper gnawynge on a lymme of a man / bekynge his broad lymmes by the fire
and brecheles / and three fair damoysels tornynge three broches whereon were
broched twelve young children late borne like young birds When king Arthur
beheld that pyteous syte / he had great compassion on them so that his heart
bledde for sorrow / and hayled him saying in this wise he that all the world
weldeth give the short life and shameful death / And the devil have thy soul /
why have thou murthred these young Innocent children / and murthred this
duchess / Therefore arise and dress the thou gloton / For this day shall thou
dye of my hand / Then the gloton anon starte up and took a great clubbe in
his hand / and smote at the king that his coronal fylle to the earth / and the
king hytte him ageyn that he carf his belly and cut of his genytours / that
his guts and his entraylles fylle down to the ground / then the gyaunt
threw awey his clubbe / and caught the king in his arms that he crusshyd his
rybbes / Then the three maidens knelyd down and called to Christ for help and
comfort of Arthur And then Arthur weltred and wrong / that he was other
while under and another time above / And so weltryng and walowynge they rolled
down the hylle / till they came to the sea mark / and ever as they so weltred
/ Arthur smote him with his daggar / and it fortuned they came to the place /
where as the two knights were and kept Arthurs horse / then when they saw
the king fast in the gyaunts arms / they came and losed him / And then the
king commanded sir kaye to smite of the gyaunts head / and to set it upon a
truncheon of a spear / and bear it to sire howel / and tell him that his enemy
was slain / and after late this head be bounden to a barby^an that all the
people may see and behold hit / and go ye two up to the montayn / and fetch me
my sheld / my suerd and the clubbe of iron / And as for the tresour take ye it
/ for ye shall find there good out of nombre / So I have the kertyl and the
clubbe I desire no more / This was the fyerst gyaunt that ever I met with /
sauf one in the mount of Arabe / which I overcame / but this was gretter and
fyerser / Then the knights fette the clubbe and the kyrtyl / and some of the
tresour they took to them self / and returned again to the host And anon this
was known through all the country / wherefore the people came and thanked the
king / And he said again give the thank to god / and depart the goods
among you / And after that king Arthur said and commanded his Cosyn howel
that he should ordeyne for a church to be bylded on the same hylle in the
worship of saint Mychel / And on the morn the king remeuyd with his great
bataylle / and came in to Champayne and in a valeye / and there they pyght
their tentys / and the king being set at his dinner / there came in two
messagers / of whom that one was Marchal of france and said to the king that
the emperor was entryd in to france / and had destroyed a great part and was
in Burgoyn and had destroyed and made great slaughter of people and burnt
towns and borowes / wherefore if thou come not hastily / they must yield up

burgoyne Then a knight named sire Gaynus nyghe cosyn to the Emperor said /
loo how these Bretons ben full of pride and boost / and they brag as though

words / and pulled out his swerd and smote of his head / And therewith turned
their horses and rode over waters and through woods till they came to their
busshement / where as sir Lyonel and sir Bedeuer were houyng / The romans

Feldenak thought to revenge the death of gaynus upon sire Gawayn / but sire

Romans / and slew and hew down the Romans and forced the Romans to flee

Gawayn sent to king Arthur for socour and that he hye him for I am sore

king did do ransake his wounds and comforted him / And thus was the
beginning of the first journey of the brytons and Romans / and there were

he would follow hastily after / king Arthur was warned pryuely / and sent his
people to Sessoyne / and took up the towns and castles fro the Romans / Then
the king commanded sir Cador to take the rereward / and to take with him
certain knights of the round table / and sire Lancelot / sire Bors / sir kay
/ sire Marrok with sire Marhaus shall awayte on our person / Thus the king
Arthur disperplyd his host in diverse parties / to the end that his enemies
should not escape / when the Emperor was entryd in to the vale of Sessoyne /
he might see where king Arthur was enbatailled and his baner dysplayed / and
he was bysette round about with his enemies / that needs he must fight or
yield him / for he might not flee / But said openly unto the Romans / syrs I
admoneste you that this day ye fight and acquyte you as men / and remember how
Rome domyneth and is chyef and head over all the earth and universal world /
and suffer not these bretons this day to abide ageynste us / and there with he
did command his tro^pettes to blow the blody sownes in such wise that the
ground trembled and dyndled / Then the bataile approuched and shoue and
showted on both sides and great strokes were smyten on both sides / many men
overthrown / hurt / and slain and great valyaunces / prowesses and appertyces
of werre were that day showed / which were over long to recounte the noble
feats of every man / For they should conteyne an hole volume / But in especyal
king Arthur rode in the bataille exhorting his knights to do well / and him
self did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do / he drew out
Excalibur his swerd / and awayted ever where as the romans were thyckest and
most grieved his people / and anon he adressyd him on that part and hew and
slew down ryt and rescued his people / and he slew a great gyaunt named
galapas / which was a man of an huge quantyte and heyghte he shorted him and
smote of both his legs by the knees / saying Now art thou better of a syse
to dele with / than thou were / and after smote of his head / there sire gawayn
fought nobly and slew three admyrales in that bataill / And so did all the
knights of the round table / Thus the bataill bitwene king Arthur and Lucius
the emperor endured long / Lucius had on his side many sarasyns / which were
slain / and thus the bataille was great / and oftsydes that one party was at a
fordele and anon at an afterdele / which endured so long till at the last
king Arthur aspyed / where Lucius the emperor fought / and did wonder with his
own hands / And anon he rode to him / And either smote other fyersly / and
at last Lucyus smote Arthur thwart the vysage / and gaf him a large wound /
And when king Arthur felt him self hurt / anon he smote him again with
Excalibur that it clefte his head fro the somette of his head / and stynted not
till it came to his breast And then the emperor fylle down deed / and there
ended his life / And when it was known that the emperor was slain anon all
the Romans with all their host put them to flight / and king Arthur with
all his knights followed the chaas / and slew down right all them that they
might atteyne / And thus was the vyctory given to king Arthur and the
tryumphe / and there were slain on the party of Lucius moo than an honderd
thousand / And after king Arthur did do ransake the deed bodies / and did do
burye them that were slain of his retenue every man according to the state
and degree that he was of / And them that were hurt he let the surgyens do
search their hurtes and wounds / and commanded to spare no salues ne
medecynes till they were hole / Then the king rode strayte to the place where
the emperor lucius lay deed / and with him he fond slain the Sowdan of Surrey /
the king of Egypt and of Ethyope / which were two noble kings with xvij
other kings of diverse regyons / and also syxty senators of Rome al noble men
/ whom the king did do bawme and gomme with many good gommes aromatyk / and
after did do cere them in syxty fold of cered clothe of Sendale / and leyd them
in chestys of leed / by cause they should not chauffe ne sauoure / and upon all
these bodies their sheldes with their arms and baners were set / to the end
they should be known of what country they were / and after he fond three
Senators which were on live to whom he said / for to save your lives I will
that ye take these deed bodies / and carye them with you unto great Rome / and
present them to the potestate on my behalue showing him my letters / and
tell them that I in my person shall hastily be at Rome / And I suppose the
Romans shall beware how they shall demand any trybute of me / And I
command you to say when ye shall come to Rome to the potestate and all the
counceylle and Senate / that I send to them these deed bodies for the trybute
that they have demanded / And if they be not content with these / I shall pay
more at my coming / for other trybute owe I none / ne none other will I pay
/ And me thinks this suffyseth for Bretayne / Irlond and al Almayne with
germanye / And ferthermore I charge you to say to them / that I command them
upon pain of their hedes never to demand trybute ne tax of me ne of my
lands Then with this charge and commandment the three Senators before said
departed with all the said deed bodies leynge the body of Lucius in a carre
couerd with tharmes of the Empire al alone / And after alwey two bodies of
kings in a charyot / and then the bodies of the Senators after them and so
went toward Rome / and showed their legacyon and message to the potestate and
Senate / recountyng the bataylle done in France / and how the feld was lost
and much people and Innumerable slain / wherefore they aduysed them in no wise
to meue no more war ageynste that noble conqueroure Arthur / For his might
and prowess is most to be doubted seen the noble kings and great multitude of
knights of the round table / to whom none erthely prince may compare /

Capitulo nono
NOw torn we unto king Arthur and his noble knights which after the great
bataylle acheued ageynste the Romans / entryd in to Lorayne braban and
Flaundres and sythen returned in to hault Almayn / and so over the mo^tayns in
to lombardye / and after in to Tuskane / wherein was a Cite / which in no wise
would yield them self ne obey / where fore king Arthur biseged it / and lay
long about hit / and gaf many assaults to the Cite / And they within
deffended them valyauntly / Then on a time the king called sir florence a
knight / and said to him they lacked vytaylle / and not far from hens ben
great forestes and woods / wherein ben many of mine enemies with much bestyayl
/ I will that thou make the ready and goo thither in foreyeng / and take with the
sir Gawayn my neuew / Sire wysshard / sire Clegys / Sire Cleremond and the
Captayn of Cardef with other / and bring with you all the beestes that ye
there can get / And anon these knights made them ready / and rode over holtys
and hyllys through forestes and woods / till they came in to a fair meadow full of
fair flowers and grass / And there they rested them and their horses all
that night / And in the spryngynge of the day in the next morn / sire Gawayn
took his horse and stale away from his felauship to seek some adventures / And
anon he was ware of a man armed walking his horse easyly by a wodes side / and
his sheld laced to his sholdre sitting on a strong courser without any man
saving a page berynge a mighty spear. The knight bare in his sheld three
gryffons of gold in sable charbuncle the chyef of silver / when sire Gawayn
aspyed this gay knight / he fewtryd his spear and rode strayt to him / and
demanded of him from whens that he was that other ansuerd and said he was of
Tuscane / and demanded of sire gawayn / what profryst thou proud knight the
so boldly / here getest thou no pray / thou may prove wha^ thou wylt / for
thou shall be my prisoner or thou depart /

Then said gawayn / thou auauntest the gretely and spekest proud words / I
cou^ceylle the for all thy boost that thou make the ready / and take thy gere

Then they took their speres and ran each at other with all the might
they had / and smote each other through their sheldes in to their sholders /
wherefore anon they pulled out their swerdes / and smote great strokes that
the sire sprange out of their helmes / Then sire gawayne was al abashed and
with galatyn his good swerd he smote through shield and thycke hauberke made of
thyck maylles and al to russhed and brake the precious stones / and made him a
large wound / that men might see both liver and long / Then groned that
knight / and adressyd him to sire Gawayn / and with an awke stroke gaf him a
great wound and kytte a vain / which grieved gawayn sore / and he bledde sore
/ Then the knight said to sire Gawayn / bind thy wound or thy blee change
/ for thou bybledest al thy horse and thy fair arms / For all the Barbours of
Bretayne shall not conne staunche thy blood / For who someuer is hurt with this
blade he shall never be staunched of bledynge / Then ansuerd gawayn hit
greueth me but lytyl / thy great words shall not fear me ne less my courage
/ but thou shall suffer tene and sorrow or we depart / but tell me in have who
may staunche my bledynge / That may I do said the knight if I will / And so
will I if thou wylt socoure and aid me that I may be crystned and believe on
god / And thereof I require the of thy manhood / and it shall be great merit
for thy soul / I grant said Gawayne so god help me tacomplysshe all thy
desire / But first tell me what thou soughtest here thus allone / and of what
land and legeaunce thou art of / Sire he said my name is Pryamus / and a
great prince is my fader / and he has been rebelle unto Rome and over ryden
many of their lands / My fader is lyneally descended of Alysaunder and of
hector by right lygne / And duke Iosue and Machabeus were of our lygnage / I
am right enherytour of Alysaunder and auffryke and all the out yles / yet will
I believe on thy lord that thou byleuest on / And for thy labor I shall give
the tresour enough / I was so elate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no
man my pere ne to me semblable / I was sent in to this werre with seven score
knights / and now I have encountered with the which have given to me of
fyghtyng my fylle / wherefore sir knight I pray the to tell me what thou art
/ I am no knight said gawayn / I have been brought up in the garderobe with the
noble king Arthur many years for to take heed to his armor and his other
array / and to point his paltockes that longen to him self / At yole last he
made me yoman and gaf to me horse and harneys and an honderd pound in money /
And if fortune be my friend / I doubt not / but to be well auaunced and helped
by my lyege lord / A said Pryamus / if his knauys be so kene and fyers / his
knytes ben passing good / Now for the kings love of heaven whether thou be a
knave or a knight tell thou me thy name / By god said sire Gawayn / Now will I
say the sothe / my name is sire gawayn and known I am in his court and in
his chamber / and one of the knights of the round table / he dubbed me a duke
with his own hand / Therefore grutche not if this grace is to me fortuned / hit
is the goodness of god that lent to me my strength / Now am I letter pleasyd
said Pryamus than thou had given to me all the prouynce and paris the rich
/ I had lever to have been torn with wild horses / than any varlet had won
such loos / or any page or pryker should have had prys on me / But now sire
knight I warn the / that here by is a duke of Lorayne with his army and the
noblest men of Dolphyne and lords of lombardye / with the garneson of godard /
and sarasyns of Southland y nombred lx M of good men of arms / wherefore but if
we hye us hens / it will harm us both / for we ben sore hurt / never like
to recover / but take heed to my page that he no horn blow / For if he do
there ben houynge here fast by an C knytes awaytynge on my person / and if they
take the / there shall no raunson of gold ne silver acquyte the / Then sire
gawayne rode over a water for to save him / And the knight followed him / and
so rode forth till they came to his felawes / which were in the medowe /
where they had been all the night Anon as sire wychard was ware of sire gawayn
and saw that he was hurt / he ran to him soroufully weeping / and demanded
of him who had so hurt him / and gawayn told how he had foughten with that
man / and each of them had hurt other / and how he had salues to hele them /
but I can tell you other tidings / that soon we shall have adoo with many
enemies / Then sire pryamus and sire gawayn alyghted / and let their horses
grase in the medowe and unarmed them / And then the blood ran fresshly fro
their wounds / And pryamus took fro his page a vyolle full of the four waters
that came out of paradys / and with certain baume enoynted their wounds /
and wesshe them with that water / and within an hour after / they were both as
hole as ever they were / And then with a trompet were they all assembled to
counceylle / And there pryamus told unto them / what lords and knights had
sworn to rescowe him / and that without faill they should be assailed with many
thousands / wherefore he counceilled them to withdraw them / Then sire gawayn
said it were great shame to them to avoid without any strokes / (...)
wherefore I advise to take our arms and to make us ready to mete with these
sarasyns and mysbyleuyng men / and with the help of god we shall overthrow
them and have a fair day on them / And sire Florens shall abide still in this
field to keep the stale as a noble knight / and we shall not forsake yonder
felawes / Now said Pryamus seasse your words / for I warn you ye shall find
in yonder woods many peryllous knights / they will put forth beestes to
call you on / they be out of nombre / and ye are not past vij C which ben
over few to fight with so many / Nevertheless said sir gawayn we shall ones
encountre them / and see what they can do and the best shall have the vyctory

Then sire Florence called to him sire florydas with an honderd knights and
droofe forth the herd of bestes / Then followed him vij honderd men of arms
/ and sir Feraunt of spain on a fair stead came spryngynge out of the woods
/ and came to sire Florence and axyd him why he fled / Then sire Florence
teok his spear / and rode ageynste him / and smote him in the forhede and brake
his neck bone / Then all the other were meued / and thought to avenge the
death of sir Feraunt / and smote in emonge them / and there was great fight
and many slain and leyd down to ground / and sir Florence with his C
knights alwey kept the stale and fought manly / Then when Pryamus the good
knight perceived the grede fight / he went to sire Gawayn / and badde him that
he should goo and socoure his felauship / which were sore bystad with their
enemies / Sir grieve you not said sire Gawayn / For their gree shall be theirs I
shall not ones meue my horse to them ward / but if I see mo than there ben / For
they ben strong enough to match them / and with that he saw an earl called
sire Ethelwold and the duk of duchemen came lepyng out of a wood with many
thousa^des and pryamus knytes / and came strayte un to the bataylle / then sir
gawayn comforted his knights / and bad them not to be abashed / for all shall
be ours / then they began to wallope and met with their enemies / there were
me^ slain and overthrown on every side / Then threstyd in among them the
knights of the table round / and smote down to the earth all them that
wythstode them / in so much that they made them to recuyelle and flee / By
god said sire Gawayn this gladeth my heart / for now ben they less in nombre
by xx M / Then entryd in to the bataylle Iubaunce a geaunt / and fought and
slew down right and distressyd many of our knights / emonge whom was slain
sire Gherard a knight of walys / Then our knights took heart to them / and
slew many sarasyns / And then came in sir Priamus with his penon / and rode
with the knights of the round table / and fought so manfully that many of
their enemies lost their lives / And there sir Pryamus slew the Marquys of
Moses land and sire gawayn with his felawes so quytte hem that they had the
feld / but in that stoure was sir Chestelayne a child and ward of sire Gawayne
slain / wherefore was much sorou made / and his death was soon auengyd / Thus
was the bataille ended and many lords of lombardye and sarasyns left deed in
the feld / Then sire florence and sire Gawayne herberowed surely their people
/ and token great plente of bestyal of gold and silver and great tresour and
richesse and returned unto king Arthur which lay still at the syege / And
when they came to the king / they presented their prisoners and recounted
their adventures / and how they had vaynquysshed their enemies

NOw thanked be god said the noble king Arthur / But what manner man is he that
stands by him self him seemed no prisoner / Sire said Gawayne this is a good
man of arms / he has matched me / but he is yolden unto god and to me for to
bycome Christian. had not he have be we should never have rotorned / wherefore I
pray you that he may be baptized / sor there lives not a nobler man ne better
knight of his hands / then the king let him anon be crystned / and did do

table round And then anon the king let do cry assault to the cite / and
there was rerynge of laddres brekyng of wallys and the dyche filled / that men
with little pain myt enter in to the cite / then came out a duchess / and
Clarysyn the countess with many ladies and damoysels / and knelyng before
king Arthur required him for the love of god to receive the cite / and not to
take it by assault for then should many gyltles be slain / then the king
aualyd his vyser with a meke and noble cou^tenau^ce / and said madame there shall
none of my subgettys mysdoo you ne your maidens / ne to none that to you longen

seized the town by assent of his lords / and took the duc and sent him to
dover there for to abide prisoner term of his life and assigned certain rentes
for the dower of the duchess and for her children / Then he made lords to
rule tho lands and laws as a lord ought to do in his own country / and
after he took his journey toward Rome / and sent sir Florys and sir florydas to

was won / and anon he sent and commanded that none of his lyege men should
defoule ne lygge by no lady / wife / ne maid / and when he came in to the cite /
he passid to the castle / and comforted them that were in sorou / and ordained
there a captayn a knyt of his own country / and when they of Melane herd that

and viterbe and fro thens he rode in to the vale of vycecou^te among the vynes
And fro thens he sent to the senators to wete / whether they would know him

senators that were left on live / and the noblest Cardynals that then ne
dwelled in Rome / And prayed him of pees / and proffered him full large And
byfought him as governor to give license for vj wekes for to assemble all the
Romans / And then to crown him Emperor with creme as it bylongeth to so

emperor by the popes hand with all the ryalte that could be made / And
sudgerned there a time / and establysshed all his lands from Rome in to

and he gafe to sire Pryamus the duchye of Lorayne / and he thanked him and said
he would serve him the days of his life / and after made dukes and earls / and
made every man rich / Then after this all his knights and lords assembled

therefore make you ready and return we in to England / Then there was trussyng
of harneis and bagage and great caryage / And after license given he returned
and commanded that no man in pain of death should not rob ne take vytaylle

Thus ends the fyfthe book of the conqueste that king Arthur had ageynste
Lucius the Emperor of Rome / and here follows the syxth book which is of
sir Lancelot du lake
Capitulum primum
Soon after that king Arthur was come / fro rome in to England / then all
the knights of the table round resorted unto the king / and made many Iustes
and turnementes / and some there were that were but knytes which encreaced so
in arms and worship that they passed all their felawes in prowess and noble
deeds / and that was well preued on many / But in especyal it was preued on sire
lancelot du lake / for in all turnementys and Iustes and deeds of arms both
for life and death he passed al other knytes / and at no time he was never
overcome / but if it were by treson or enchauntement / so sir Lancelot
encreaced so merueyllously in worship / and in honor / therefore is he the
first knyt that the frensshe book makes mencyon of after king Arthur came fro
rome / wherefore queen gweneuer had him in great favor above al other knights*
and in certain he loved the queen again above al other ladies damoysels of
his life / And for her he did many deeds of arms and saved her from the fire
thorou his noble chyualry / Thus sire lancelot rested him long with play and
game / And then he thought him self to preue him self in strange auentures /
then he badde his neuewe sire Lyonel for to make him ready / for we two will
seek adventures / So they mounted on their horses armed at al ryghtes / and
rode in to a deep forest and so in to a deep plain / And then the weder was
hot about noone / and sire lancelot had great lust to sleep / Then sir
lyonel aspyed a great Appyl tree that stood by an hedge / and said brother
yonder is a fair shadow / there may we rest us on our horses / hit is well
said fair brother said sir lancelot / for this vij^ year I was not so slepy
as I am now / and so they there alyghted and tayed their horses unto sundry
trees / and so sir lancelot laid him down under an appyl tree / and his helm
he laid under his head / And Sire lyonel waked while he slepte / So sire
lancelot was a sleep passing fast / And in the mean while there came three
knights riding as fast fleing as ever they might ride And there followed
hem three but one knight / And when sir lyonel saw him / him thought he saw
never so great a knight nor so well farynge a man neither so well appara^lled
unto al ryghtes / So within a while this strong knyt had overtaken one of
these knights / and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still /
And than he rode unto the second knight / and smote him so that man and horse
fell down / And then streyghte to the thyrdde knight he rode and smote him
behind his horse are a spear length / And then he alyghte down and arayned
his horse on the brydel and bond all the three knights fast with the raynes of
their own brydels / When sir lyonel saw him do thus / he thought to assay
him / and made him ready and stylly / and pryuely he took his horse and thought
not for to awake sir lancelot / And when he was mounted upon his horse / he
ouertoke this strong knight / and bad him torn / and the other smote sir
lyonel so hard that horse and man he bare to the earth / and so he alyght down
and bound him fast and threw him overthwart his own horse / and so he served
hem al four / and rode with hem awey to his own castle / And when he came
there he garte unarm them and beat hem with thornys al naked / and after put
hem in a deep prison where were many mo knights that made great doloure

Capitulum secundum /
When sire Ector de marys wist that sire lau^celot was past out of the court to
seek adventures he was wroth with him self / and made him ready to seek sire
lau^celot / and as he had ryden long in a great forest he met with a man was
like a foster / Fair felaw said sire Ector know thou in this country any
adventures that been here nyghe hand / Sir said the foster / this country know
I well. and here by within this mile / is a strong manoir and well dyked / and
by that manoir on the lift hand there is a fair fourde for horses to drink
of / and over that fourde there grows a fair tree / and the ronhangen many
fair sheldes that welded sometime good knights / and at hoole of the tree
hangs a bacyn of coper and lat^en / and stryke upon that bacyn with the but
of thy spear thryes / And soon after thou shall here new tidings / And else
have thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that passed thorou
this forest / gramercy said sire Ector / and departed / and came to the tree
and saw many fair sheldes / And among them he saw his broders sheld sir
Lyonel and many moo that he knew that were his felawes of the round table /
the which grieved his heart / and promised to revenge his brother / Then a
none sir Ector beat on the bacyn as he were wood / and then he gaf his horse
drink at the fourde / and there came a knight behynd him / and bad him come
out of the water and make him ready / and sire Ector anon turned him shortly
and in fewter cast his spear and smote the other knight a great buffet that
his horse turned twyes about / This was well done said the strong knyt / and
knytly thou have stryken me / And therewith he russhed his horse on sire Ector /
and cleyte him under his right arm and bare him clean out of the sadel / and
rode with him awey in to his own halle / and threw him down in mids of the
floor / the name of this knight was sire Turquyne / than he said unto sire
Ector for thou have done this day more unto me than any knight did these xij
years / Now will I grant the thy life so thou will be sworn to be my prisoner
all thy life days / Nay said sir Ector / that will I never promise the / but
that I will do mine advantage / That me repents said sire Turquyne / and
then he garte to unarm him and beat him with thornys all naked / and sythen
put him down in a deep dungeon where he knew many of his felawes / But when
sire Ector saw sir lyonel then made he great sorrow / Allas brother said sir
Ector / where is my brother sire Lancelot / Fair brother I left him on sleep
when that I from him yode under an appel tree and what is become of him I can
not tell you / Allas said the knights / but sire lancelot help us we may
never be delyuerd / for we know now no knight that is able to match our
master Turquyn

Capitulum tercium
NOw leave we these knights prisoners and speak we of sire Launcelott du lake
that lies under the Appyl Tree slepynge / even about the noone there come by
him four queen's of great estate / And for the hete should not nyhe hem there
rode four knights about hem / and bare a clothe of grene sylke on four
sperys betwixe them and the son / And the queen's rode on four white mules

Thus as they rode they herd by them a great horse grymly neye / then were
they ware of a slepynge knight that lay all armed under an appyl tree /
anon as these queen's looked on his face / they knew it was sire lancelot /
Then they byganne for to strive for that knight / euerychone said they would
baue him to her love / We shall not strive said Morgan he fay that was king
Arthurs sister / I shall put an enchauntement upon him / that he shall not
awake in six owres / And then I will led him awey unto my castle / And
when he is surely within my hold / I shall take the enchauntement from him /
And then let him chese which of us he will have unto peramour / So this
enchauntement Was cast upon sire Launcelott / And then they leyd him upon
his shield / and bare him so an horsback betwixt two knights / and brought
him unto the castle charyot / and there they leyd him in a chambyr cold / and
at night they sent unto him a fair damoysel with his souper ready dyght By
that the enchauntement was past / And when she came she sale wed him / and

I wot not how I came in to this castle / but it be by an enchauntement / Sire
said she ye must make good chere / And if ye be such a knyte as it is said ye
ben / I shall tell you more to morn by pryme of the day / Gramercy fair
damoysel said sire Lancelot of your good will I require you / And so she
departed / And there he lay all that night without comfort of any body

And on the morn erly came these four queen's passyngly well bysene / All they

said thou must understand thou art our prisoner / and we here know the well

hard caaas said sire Lancelot that either I must dye or else chese one of you
/ yet had I lever to dye in this prison with worship than to have one of you to
my peramour maugre my head / And therefore ye be ansuerd I will none of you for

truest lady unto her lord living / Well said the queen's / is this your ansuer
that ye will reffuse us / ye on my life said sir lau^celot / reffused ye ben of

Right so at the noone came the damoysel unto him with his dinner / and asked
him what chere / truly fair damoysel said sire Lancelot in my life days never
so ylle / sir she said that me repentest / but and ye will be reulyd by me / I
shall help you out of this distress / and ye shall have no shame nor vylony so
that ye hold me a promise / fair damoysel I will grant you / and sore I am of
these queen's sorceresses aferd / for they have destroyed many a good knight /
sire said she that is sothe and for the renome and bounte that they here of you
/ they would have your love / and sir they said / your name is sire Lancelot
du laake the flower of knights / and they be passing wroth with you that ye
have reffused hem / But sire and ye would promise me to help my fader on
tewsdaye next coming / that has made a turnement betwixe him and the king of
Northgalys / for the last tewesdaye past my fader lost the field thorugh three
knights of Arthurs court / And ye will be there on tewesday next coming / and
help my fader to morn or pryme by the grace of god I shall deliver you clean
/ Fair maiden said sir lancelot tell me what is your faders name / and
then shall I give you an ansuer / Sire knight she said / my fader is king
Bagdemagus that was foul rebuked at the last turnement / I know your fader
well said sire lancelot for a noble king and a good knight / And by the feythe
of my body ye shall have my body ready to do your fader and you seruyse at
that day / Sire she said gra mercy / and to morn awayte ye be ready by times
and I shall ^e she that shall deliver you / and take you your armoure and your
horse shield and spear / And here by within this x mile is an Abbey of white
monks / there I pray you that ye me abide / and thither shall I bring my fader
unto you / all this shall be done said sire Lancelot as I am true knight /
and so she departed and came on the morn erly / and found him ready / then
she brought him out of twelve locks and brout him unto his armor / and when
he was clean armed / she brought him until his own horse / and lyghtely he
sadeled him and took a great spear in his hand / and so rode forth / and said
fair damoysel I shall not fail you by the grace of god / And so he rode in to
a great forest all that day / and never could find no high way / and so the
night fell on him / and then was he ware in a slade of a pauelione of reed
sendel / By my feythe said sire lancelot in that pauelione will I bodge all
this night / and so there he alyghte down and tayed his horse to the
pauelione / and there he unarmed him / and there he fond a bed / and laid him
theryn / and fell on sleep sadly

Then within an hour there came the knight to whom the pauelione ought /
And he wend that his lema^ had layne in that bed / and so he laid him down
beside sir Lancelot / and took him in his arms and began to kiss him / And
when sire lancelot felt a rough berd kyssyng him / he starte out of the
bed lyghtely / and the other knyt after him / and either of hem gate their
swerdes in their hands / and out at the pauelione door went the knight of
the pauelione / and sire lancelot followed him / and there by a little slake sir
lancelot wounded him sore nyghe unto the death And then he yielded him unto
sire lancelot / and so he granted him so that he would tell him why he came
in to the bed Sire said the knight the pauelione is mine own / and there this
night I had assygned my lady to have slepte with me And now I am lykely to dye
of this wound / that me repents said Lancelot of your hurt / but I was
adrad of treson / for I was late begyled / and therefore come on your way in to
your pauelione and take your rest / And as I suppose I shall staunche your
blood / and so they went both in to the pauelione / And anon sire lancelot
staunched his blood / There with all came the knights lady / that was a
passing fair lady / And when she aspyed that her lord Belleus was sore
Wounded she cried out on sire lancelot / and made great dole out of mesure /
Pees my lady and my love said Belleus / for this knight is a goood man and a
knight aduenturous / and there he told her all the cause how he was wounded /
And when that I yolde me unto him / he left me goodely and has staunched my
blood / Sire said the lady I require the tell me what knight ye be / and what
is your name / Fair lady he said / my name is sire lancelot du lake / so me
thought ever by your speech said the lady / for I have seen you often or this /
and I know you better than ye wene / But now and ye would promise me of your
curtosy for the harms that ye have done to me and to my lord Belleus that
when he comes unto Arthurs court for to cause him to be made knight of the
round table / for he is a passing good man of arms and a mighty lord of lands
of many out yles / Fair lady said sire lancelot let him come unto the
court the next hyhe feast / and look that ye come with him / and I shall do my
power / and ye preue you doughty of your hands that ye shall have your desire
So thus within a while as they thus talked the night passed / and the day
shone / and then sire lancelot armed him / and took his horse / and they
taught him to the Abbaye and thither he rode within the space of two owrys

ANd soon as sire launcelott came withyn the Abbeye yard / the daughter of

she made men fast to take his horse from him / and let led him in to a stabyl

sent him a long goune / and anon she came her self / And then she made
lancelot passing good chere / and she said he was the knyt in the world was
most welcome to her / Then in all haste she sent for her fader Bagdemagus
that was within xij mile of that Abbay / and before even he came with a fair
felauship of knights with him / And when the king was alyghte of his horse
he yode streyte unto sir launcelots chamber / and there he fond his daughter /
and then the king enbraced sir Lancelot in his arms and either made other
good chere / Anon sire lancelot made his complaynt unto the king how he was
bytrayed And how his brother sire lyonel was departed from him / he nyst not
where / and how his daughter had delyuerd him out of prison / therefore while I
live I shall do her seruyse and al her kynred / Then am I sure of your help
said the king on tewesday next coming / ye sir said sir lancelot / I shall
not faylle you / for so I have promised my lady your daughter / But sire what
knights be they of my lord Arthurs that were with the king of Northgalys /
and the king said it was sire madore de laporte / and sir Mordred and sir
gahalaytyne that al fur fared my knights / for against hem three I nor my
knights might bear no strength / Sire said sire lancelot as I here say
that the turnement shall be here within this three mile of this abbay / ye shall
send unto me three knights of yours such as ye trust and look that the three
knights have al white sheldes and I also and no paynture on the sheldes / and
and we four will come out of a little wood in mids of both parties / and we
shall fall in the frounte of our enemies and grieve hem that we may / And
thus shall I not be known what knight I am / So they took their rest that
night / and this was on the sunday / and so the king departed / and sent unto
sire lancelot three knights with the four white sheldes And on the tewesday
they lodged hem in a lytyl leued wood beside there the turnement should be / And
there were scaffoldis and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to
give the pryse / Then came in to the feld the king of Northgalys with eight
score helmes / And then the three knights of Arthurs stood by them self /
Then came in to the feld king Bagdemagus with four score of helmys / and
then they fewtryd their sperys / and came to gyders with a great dasshe / and

With that came sir Lancelot du lake and he threste in with his spear in the
thyckest of the prees / and there he smote down with one spear five knights /
and of four of hem he brake their backs / And in that throng he smote down
the king of Northgalys / and brake his thye in that fall / All this doing of
sire Lancelot saw the three knights of Arthurs / Yonder is a shrewde gest
said sire Madore de la port therefore have here ones at him / so they
encountered / and sire Lancelot bare him down horse and man / so that his
sholder went out of lyth / Now befalls it to me to Just said Mordred / for
sir Mador has asore fall / Sire Lancelot was ware of him / and gate a great
spear in his hand / and met him and sir Mordred brake a spear upon him / and
sire lancelot gaf him such a buffet that the arsson of his sadel brake / and
so he flewe over his horse taylle that his helm butte in to the earth a foot
and more that nyhe his neck was broken / and there he lay long in a swoune /
Then came in sir Gahalantyne with a great spear / and Lancelot ageyyst him
with all their strength that they myt drive that both her speres to brast even
to their hands / and then they flang out with their swerdes and gaf many a
grym stroke / Then was sir lancelot wroth out of mesure / and then he
smote sir galahantyne on the helm that his nose braste out on blood and eerys
and mouth both / and there with his head henge low / And therewith his horse
ran awey with him / and he fell down to the earth / Anon there with all
sire lancelot gate a greet spear in his hand / And or ever that great spear
brake / he bare down to the earth xvj knights some horse and man / and some
the man and not the horse / and there was none but that he hit surely he bare
none arms that day / And then he gate another great spear and smote down
twelve knights / and the most party of hem never throfe after / and then
the knytes of the king of northgalys would Just no more / And there the gr^e was
given to king Bagdemagus / So either party departed unto his own place / and
sir lancelot rode forth with king Bagdemagus unto his castle / and there he
had passing good chere both with the king and with his daughter / and they
profred him great yeftes / And on the morn he took his leave / and told the
king that he would goo and seek his brother sire Lyonel that went from him when
that he slepte / so he took his horse / and betaught hem all to god / And there
he said unto the kings daughter if ye have need any time of my seruyse I pray
you let me have knouleche / and I shall not faylle you as I am true knight /
and so sir lancelot departed / and by adventure he came in to the same forest
/ there he was take slepyng / And in the mids of an hyhe way he met a
damoysel rydyng on a white palfroy / and there either salewed other / Fair
damoysel said sire lancelot know ye in thi^ countray any adventures / sire
knight said that damoysel / here are adventures nere hand / and thou durst
preue hem / why should I not preue adventures said sire lancelot for that cause
come I hyder / well said she thou semest well to be a good knight / And if thou
dare mete with a good knight / I shall bring the where is the best knight / and
the myghtyest that ever thou fond / so thou wylt tell me what is thy name /
and what knight thou art / damoysel as for to tell the my name I take no
great force / Truly my name is sire lau^celot du lake / sire thou bysemyst well
/ here ben adventures by that fallen for the / for here by duelleth a knight
that will not be ouermatched for no man I know but ye ouermatche him / and
his name is sire Turquyne And as I understand he has in his prison of Arthurs
court good knights three score and four / that he has won with his own
hands / But when ye have done that Journey ye shall promise me as ye are a true
knight for to go with me and to help me / and other damoysels that are
distressid daily with a falls knight / All your entente damoysel and desire I
will fulfylle / so ye will bring me unto this knight How fair knight come
on your way / and so she brought him unto the fourde and the tree where henge
the bacyn / So sir lancelot let his horse drink / and sythen he beat on the
bacyn with the butte of his spear so hard with all his myt till the bottom fell
out / and long he did so but he saw no thing Then he rode endlong the
gates of that manoyre nyghe half an hour / And then was he ware of a great
knyt that dro^e an horse before him / and ouerthwarte the horse there lay an armed
knight bounden / And ever as they came nere and nere / sire lancelot thout he
should know him / Then sir lancelot was ware that hit was sire gaherys
Gawayns brother a knight of the table round / Now fair damoysel said sir
lancelot / I see yonder comes a knight fast bounden that is a felawe of mine
/ and brother he is unto sir gawayne / And at the first beginning I promise you
by the leave of god to rescowe that knight / But if his master sytte better in
the sadel I shall deliver all the prisoners that he has out of danger / for
I am sure he has two brethren of mine prisoners with him / By that time that
either had seen other / they grypped their speres unto them / Now fair knight
said sir lancelot / put that wounded knight of the horse / and let him rest
a while / and let us two preue our strengthes / For as it is informed me thou
do and have done great despyte and shame unto knights of the round table /
and therefore now defend the / And thou be of the table round said Turquyne I
defye the and all thy felauship / that is ouermoche said / said sire lancelot

ANd then they put their speres in the restys / and came to gyders with her
horses as fast as they might run / And either smote other in mids of their
sheldes that both their horse backs braste under them / and the knights
were both astonyed / and as soon as they might avoid their horses / they
took their sheldes before them / and drew out her swerdes / and came to gyder
egerly / and either gaf other many strong strokes / for there might neyder
sheldes nor harneis hold their strokes / And so within a while they had
both grymly wounds / and bledde passing grievously / Thus they ferd two
hours or mo trasyng and rasyng either other where they might hytte any bare
place / Then at the last they were bretheles both / and stood lenyng on
their swerdes / Now felawe said sir Turquyne hold thy hand a while / and tell
me what I shall ask the Say on then Turquyne said thou art the byggest man
that ever I met with all / and the best brethed / and like on knyt that I
hate above al other knights / so be hit that thou be not he I will lightly
accord with the / and for thy love I will deliver all the prisoners that I have
that is three score and four / so thou wylt tell me thy name / And thou and I
we will be felawes to gyders and never to fail the while that I live / it is
well said / said sir lancelot / but sythen hit is so that I may have thy
friendship what knight is he that thou so hate above al other / Feythfully
said sir Turquyne his name is sire lancelot du lake / for he slew my brother
sir Caradus at the dolorous toure that was one of the best knights on live /
And therefore him I except of al knights / for may I ones mete with him / the
one of us shall make an end of other I make mine auowe / And for sir launcelots
sake I have slain an C good knights / and as many I have maimed al utterly
that they might never after help them self / and many have dyed in prison /
and yet have I three score and four / and al shall be delyuerd so thou will
tell me thy name / so be it that thou be not sire lancelot / Now see I well
said sire lancelot that such a man I might be I might have peace / and such
a man I might be / that there should be war mortal betwyxte us and now sire
knight at thy request I will that thou wete and know that I am Lancelot du
lake king Bans sone of Benwyck / and very knight of the table round / And now
I defye the and do thy best / A said Turquyne / lancelot / thou art unto me
most welcome that ever was knight / for we shall never depart till the one
of ve be deed / Then they hurtled to gyders as two wild bulls rosshynge and
lasshyng with their sheldes and swerdes that sometime they fell both over
their noses / Thus they fought stylle two hours and more / and never would
have rest / and sire Turquyn gaf sire lau^celot many wounds / that all the
ground there as they fought was al bespechled with blood

Then at the last sir Turquyn waxed faynte / and gaf somewhat a bak / and bare
his shield low for werynesse / That aspyed sire Lancelot / and lepte upon him
fyersly and gate him by the Bauowre of his helmet / and plucked him down on
his knees / And anon he racyd of his helm / and smote his neck in sondyr /
And when sire lau^celot had done this / he yode unto the damoysel and said /
damoysel I am ready to goo with you where ye will have me / but I have no horse
/ Fair sire said she / taste this wounded knights horse and send him in to
this manoyr and command him to deliver all the prisoners / So sir lancelot
went unto Gaheryes and praid him not to be agreued for to leave him his horse
Nay fair lord said gaheryes I will that ye take my horse at your own
commandment / for ye have both saved me and my horse / and this day I say ye
are the best knight in the world For ye have slain this day in my syghte
the mytest man and the best knight except you that ever I saw / and fore
sire said Gaheryes I pray you tell me your name / Sire my name is sir
lancelot du lake that ou^te to help you of right for king arthurs sake / and
in especial for my lord sir gawayn^ sake your own dear brother / and when that
ye come within yonder manoyr / I am sure ye shall find there many knytes of the
round table / for I have seen many of their sheldes that I know on yonder tree
/ there is k^yes shield / and sir braundeles sheld / and sir Marhaus sheld and
sire Galyndes shield and sire Bryan de lystnoyse sheld and sir Alydukes sheld
with many mo that I am not now auysed of / and also my two brethren sheldes
sire Ector de marys and sir Lyonel / wherefore I pray you great them al from me
/ and say that I bydde them taste such stuff there as they find / and that in
any wife my brethren goo unto the court and abide me there till that I come /
for by the feast of pentecost I cast me to be there / for as at this time I
must ride with this damoysel for to save my promise / and so he departed from
Gaheryse / and Gaheryse yede in to the manore / and there he fond a yoman porter
keeping there many keys / Anon with all sire gaheryse threw the porter unto the
ground / and took the keys from him / and hastily he opened the prison door /
and there he let out all the prisoners / and every man losed other of their
bounds / And when they saw sire Gaheryse / all they thanked him / for they
wend that he was wounded / Not so said Gaheryse / hit was lancelot that slew
him worshipfully with his own hands / I saw it with mine own eyes / and he
greteth you al well / and prays you to haste you to the court / And as unto
sir Lyonel and Ector de marys he prays you to abide him at the court That
shall we not do says his brethren / we will find him and we may live / So
shall I said sir kay find him or I come at the court as I am true knight /
Then all tho knights sought the house there as the armor was / and then
they armed hem / and every knight fond his own horse / and al thet ever longed

roasted baken and soden / and so after souper sum abode there all that night /
But sire Lyonel and Ector de marys and sire kay rode after sire lancelot to

Capitulum Decimum
NOw torn we unto sire lancelot that rode with the damoysel in a fair high
way / sir said the damoysel / here by this way haunteth a knight that
destressyd al ladies and gentylwymmen / And at the leest he robs them or
lies by them / what said sir lancelot is he a thief and a knight and a
rauyssher of wymmen / he does shame unto the order of knyghthode / and contrary
unto his oath / hit is pity that he lives / But fair damoysel ye shall ride on
before your self / and I will keep my self in couerte / And if that he trouble
you or distress you / I shall be your rescowe and learn him to be ruled as a
knight / So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambelynge paas / And within a
while came out that knight on horsbak out of the wood / and his page with him
/ and there he put the damoysel from her horse / and then she cried / With
that came lancelot as fast as he might till he came to that knight / saying /
O thou falls knight and traitor unto knyghthode / who did learn the to
dystresse ladies and gentyl wymmen / when the knight saw sire lancelot
thus rebukynge him / he ansuerd not / but drew his swerd and rode unto sire
lancelot / and sire lau^celot threw his spear fro him / and drew out his
swerd / and stroke him such a buffet on the helmet that he clafe his head and
neck unto the throat Now have thou thy payement that long thou have deserved /
that is truth said the damoysel / For like as sir Turquyne watched to
destroy knights / so did this knight attend to destroy and dystresse
ladies damoysels and gentywymmen / and his name was sire Perys de foreyst
saueage / Now damoysel said sire lancelot will ye any more seruyse of me /
Nay sire she said at this time / but almighty Ihesu preserve you where someuer
ye ride or goo / for the curteyst knight thou art and mekest unto all ladies
and gentylwymmen that now lives / But one thing sire knight me thinks ye
lack / ye that are a knight wyueles that ye will not love some maiden or
gentylwoman / for I could never here say that ever ye loved any of no manner
degree and that is great pity / but hit is noysed that ye love queen Gueneuer /
and that she has ordained by enchauntement that ye shall never love none other
/ but her / ne none other damoysel ne lady shall rejoice you / wherefore many in
this land of high estate and low make great sorrow / Fair damoysel said sir
lancelot I may not warn people to speak of me what it pleases hem / But for
to be a wedded man / I think hit not / for then I must couche with her / and
leave arms and turnementys / batayls / and adventures / And as for to say for
to take my plesaunce with peramours that will I refuse in pryncypal for dread
of god / For knights that been auenturous or lecherous shall not be happy ne
fortunate unto the wereys / for outher they shall be overcome with a symplyer
knight than they be hem self / Outher else they shall by unhap and her cursydnes
slay better men than they ben hem self / And so who that uses peramours
shall be unhappy / and all thing is unhappy that is about hem / And so sire
Lancelot and she departed / And then he rode in a deep forest two days and
more / and had strayte lodging / So on the thyrdde day he rode over a long
bridge / and there starte upon him suddenly a passing foul chorle / and he
smote his horse on the nose that he turned about / and asked him why he rode
over that bridge without his license / why should I not ride this way said sir
lancelot / I may not ride beside / thou shall not chese said the chorle and
lasshyd at him with a great clubbe shod with iron / Then sire lau^celot drew
his suerd and put the stroke abak / and clafe his head unto the pappys / At the
end of the bridge was a fair village / and all the people men and wymmen cried
on sire lancelot / and said Awers deed dydest thou never for thy self / for
thou have slain the chyef porter of our castle / sir lau^celot let them say
what they would And streyghte he went in to the castle / And when he came in
to the castle he alyghte / and tried his horse to a ring on the wall / And
there he saw a fair grene court / and thither he dressyd him / For there him
thought was a fair place to fight in / So he looked about / and saw much
people in doors and wyndowes that said fair knight thou art unhappy

Anon with all came there upon him two great gyaunts well armed al sauf the hedes
with two horrible clubbes in their hands / Sire Lancelot put his sheld before
him and put the stroke aweye of the one gyaunt / and with his swerd he clafe
his head a sondre / when his felaw saw that / he ran awey as he were wood /
for fere of the horrible strokes / and lau^celot after him with all his myt and
smote him on the sholder / and clafe him to the nauel / Then sire lancelot
went in to the halle / and there came before him three score ladies and damoysels
/ and all kneled unto him / and thanked god and him of their delyueraunce. For
sire said they / the most party of us have been here this seven year their
prisoners / and we have worched al manner of sylke works for our mete / and we
are al great gentylwymmen borne / and blessed be the time knyte that ever thou
be borne / For thou have done the most worship that ever did knight in this
world / that will we bear record and we al pray you to tell us your name /
that we may tell our friends who delyuerd us out of prison / Fair damoysel
he said / my name is sire lancelot du lake / A sire said they al / well may
thou be he / for else save your self / as we demed / there might never knight
have the better of these two gyaunts / for many fair knights have assayed hit
/ and here have ended / and many times have we wysshed after you / and these
two gyaunts dredde never knight but you / Now may ye say said sir lancelot
unto your friends how and who has delyuerd you / and great them al from me /
and if that I come in any of your marches / show me such chere as ye have
cause and what tresour that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward
for your greuaunce / And the lord that is owner of this castle I would he
received it as is right / Fair sire said they / the name of this castle is
Tyntygayl / and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igrayn / and
after wedded her Vtherpendragon / and gate on her Arthur / well said sir
lancelot I understand to whom this castle longs / and so he departed from
them / and bytaughte hem unto god And then he mounted upon his horse and rode
in to many strange and wyld countries and thorou many waters and valeyes and
evil was he lodged / And at the last by fortune him happend against a night
to come to a fair courtelage / and therein he fond an old gentylwoman that
lodged him with good will / and there he had good chere for him and his horse /
And when time was his oost brought him in to a fair garet over the gate to his
bed / There sire Lancelot unarmed him and set his harneys by him / and
went to bed / and anon he fell on sleep / So soon after there came one on
horsback / and knocked at the gate in great haste / and when sir lancelot herd
this / he arose up and looked out at the wyndowe / and saw by the moon light
three knights came rydyng after that one man / and al three lasshed on him at
ones with swerdes / and that one knyt turned on hem knytly again / and
deffended him / Truly said sire lancelot yonder one knyte shall I help / for
it were shame for me to see three knytes on one / And if he be slain I am
partener of his death / and there with he took his harneis / and went out at a
wyndowe by a shete down to the four knytes / and then sir lancelot said on
high / torn you knights unto me and leave your fyghtyng with that knight /
And then they all three left sir kay / and turned unto sir lancelot / and
there began great bataylle / for they alyghte al three / and struck many great
strokes at sir lancelot / and assaylled him on every side / Then sire kay

of your help / therefore as ye will have my help / let me alone with hem /
Sire kay for the pleasyre of the knight suffered him for to do his will / and
so stood on side / And then anon within vj strokes / sire lancelot had
stryken hem to the earth

And then they al three cried sire knight we yield us unto you as man of
might makeles / As to that said sir lau^celot I will not take your yeldyng
unto me / But so that ye will yield you unto sir kay the Seneschal on that
covenant I will save your lives and else not / Fair knight said they that were
we loathe to do / For as for sir kay / we chaced him hyder / and had overcome
him had not ye ben / therefore to yield us unto him it were no reason / well as to
that said lau^celot / auyse you well / for ye may chese whether ye will dye or
live / for and ye be yolden it shall be unto sir kay / Fair knight then they
said in saving of our lives we will do as thou commaundys us / Then shall
ye said sire lancelot on whytsonday next coming go unto the court of king
Arthur / and there shall ye yield you unto queen Gueneuer / and put you al three
in her grace and mercy / and say that sir kay sent you thither to be her
prisoners / Sire they said it shall be done by the feythe of our bodies / and
we ben living / and there they swore every knight upon his swerd / And so sir
lancelot suffered hem so to depart / And then sir lancelot knocked at the
yate with the pomel of his swerd / and with that came his oost / and in they
entered sir kay and he Sire said his host I wend ye had been in your bed /
so I was / said sire lancelot / But I arose and lepte out at my wyndowe for
to help an old felawe of mine / And so when they came nyghe the light / sir
kay knew well / that it was sir lancelot / and there with he kneled down and
thanked him of al his kyndenesse that he had helped him twyes from the death
Sire he said I have no thing done but that me ought for to do / and ye are
welcome / and here shall ye repose you and take your rest / So when sir kay was
unarmed / he asked after mete / so there was mete fette him / and he ete
strongly / And when he had souped they went to their beds and were lodged
to gyders in one bed / On the morn sir lancelot arose erly / and left sire
kay slepynge / and sir lancelot took sire kayes armor and his shield and
armed him / and so he went to the stable / and took his horse and took his leave
of his oost / and so he departed / Then soon after arose sir kay and myssed
sir lancelot / And then he aspyed that he had hie armoure and his horse / Now
by my seythe I know well that he will grieve some of the court of king
Arthur. For on him knights will be bold / and deem that it is I / and that
will begyle them / And by cause of his armoure and shield I am sure I shall ride
in pees / And then soon after departed sir kay and thanked his host

NOw torn we unto sire lancelot that had ryden long in a great forest / and
at the last he came in to a low countray full of fair Ryuers and meadows / And
a ^ fore him he saw a long bridge / and three pauelions stood there on of sylke
and sendel of diverse hew / And without the pauelions henge three white sheldes
on truncheons of sperys / and great long sperys stood vpryght by the pauelions
/ and at every pauelions door stood three fresshe squyers / and so sire
lancelot passed by them and spoke no word / when he was paste the three
knights sayden him that hit was the proud kay / he weneth no knight so good
as he / and the contrary is oftyme preued / By my feythe said one of the
knights / his name was sire gaunter / I will ride after him / and assaye him
/ for all his pride / and ye may behold how that I speed / So this knight
sire Gaunter armed him / and henge his shield upon his sholder / and mounted
upon a great horse / and gate his spear in his hand / and wallopt after sire
lancelot / and when he came nyghe him / he cried Abide thou proud knight
sir kay / for thou shall not pass quyte / So sir lancelot turned him / and
either feutryd their speres / and came to gyders with all their myghtes / and
sire Gaunters spear brake but sire lancelot smote him down horse and man / and
when sir gaunter was at the earth / his brethren said echone to other yonder
knight is not sire kay / for he is byggar than he / I dare lay my heed said
sire Gylmere yonder knight has slain sir kay and has taken his horse and his
harneis / whether it be so or no said sir Raynold the third brother / let us
now goo mount upon our horses and res^owe our brother sir Gaunter upon pain
of death / we all shall have work ynou to match that knight / for ever me
seems by his person it is sire Lancelot / or sir Trystram / or sir Pelleas
the good knight / Then anon they took their horses and ouertook sir lancelot
/ and sire gylmere put forth his spear / and ran to sir lancelot / and sire
lancelot smote him down that he lay in a swoune / Sire knight said sir
Raynold thou art a strong man / and as I suppose thou have slain my two
brethren / for the which rasyth my heart sore against the / And if I might
with my worship I would not have a do with you but needs I must take part as
they do / And therefore knight he said / keep thy self / And so they hurtled
to gyders with all their myghtes / and al to sheuered both their speres /
And then they drew her swerdes and lasshyd to gyder egerly / Anon there
with aroos sire Gau^ter / and came unto his brother sire gylmere / and bad him
arise and help we our brother sir Raynold that yonder merueyllously matched
yonder good knight / There with all they lepte on their horses and hurtled
unto sire lancelot / And when he saw them come / he smote a sore stroke
unto sir Raynold that he fell of his horse to the ground / And then he stroke
to the other two brethren / and at two strokes he struck them down to the
earth / with that sir Raynold began to starte up with his heed al blody /
and came streyte unto sire lancelot / Now late be said sir lancelot / I was
not far from the when thou were maade knight sir Raynold / and also I know
thou art a good knight / and loathe I were to slay the / Gramercy said sir
raynold as for your goodness / And I dare say as for me and my brethren we will
not be loathe to yield us unto you / with that we knew your name / for well we
know ye are not sire kay / As for that be it as it be may / for ye shall yield
you unto dame gweneuer / and look that ye be with her on whytsonday and yield
you unto her as prisoners / and say that sire kay sent you unto her / then
they swore hit should be done / and so passed forth sire lancelot / nd echone
of the brethren halpe other as well as they might

So sir lancelot rode in to a deep forest / and there by in a slade / he saw
four knights houyng under an oak / and they were of Arthurs court / one was
sir Sagramour le desyrus and Ector de marys / and sir Gawayn and sir Vwayne /
Anon as these four knights had aspyed sir Lancelot they wend by his arms it
had been sir kay / Now by my feythe said sir Sagramour / I will preue sir
kayes might / and gate his spear in his hand / and came toward sir lancelot
There with sir lancelot was ware and knew him well / and feutryd his spear
against him / and smote sire Sagramore so sore that horse and man fell both to
the earth / Lo my felaus said he yonder ye may see what a buffet he has / that
knyt is much bygger than ever was sire kay / Now shall ye see what I may do to
him / So sir Ector gate his spear in his hand and wallopte toward sire
Lau^celot / and sire Lancelot smote him thorou the shield and sholder that man
and horse went to the earth / and ever his spear held / By my feythe said sir
Vwayne yonder is a strong knight / and I am sure he has slain sir kay / And
I see by his great strength it will be hard to match him / And there with all
sire Vwayne gate his spear in his hand / and rode toward sire Lancelot / and
sir lancelot knew him well / and so he met him on the plain / and gafe him
such a buffette that he was astonyed / that long he wist not where he was /
Now see I well said sire gawayne I must encou^tre with that knyt / Then he
dressid he his sheld and gate a good spear in his hand / and sire lancelot
knew him well / and then they let run their horses with all their myghtes
/ and either knight smote other in mids of the shield / But sire gawayns
spear to brast / and sire lancelot charged so sore upon him that his horse
reuersed up so down And much sorrow had sire gawayn to avoid his horse / and
so sire lancelot passed on a paas and smyled and said god give him joy that
this spear made / for there came never a better in my hand / Then the four
knights went echone to other and comforted each other / what say ye by this
gest said sire Gawayne / that one spear has feld us al four / we command
him unto the devil they said al / for he is a man of great might / ye may well
say it / said sire gawayne / that he is a man of might / for I dare lay my
head it is sire Lancelot I know it by his rydyng / Let him goo said sire
Gawayn for when we come to the court than shall we wete / and then had they
much sorrow to get their horses again

NOw leave we there and speak of sir Lancelot that rode a great while in a deep
forest where he saw a black brachet sekyng in manner as it had been in the feaute
of an hurt dear / And there with he rode after the brachet and he saw lie on
the ground a large feaute of blood / And then sire lancelot rode after / And
ever the Brachet looked behynd her / and so she went thorou a great mareyse /
and ever sire lancelot followed / And then was he ware of an old manoyr / and
thither ran the brachet / and so over the bridge / So sire lancelot rode
over that bridge that was old and feeble / and when he came in mids of a great
halle there he saw lie a deed knight that was a semely man / and that brachet
lycked his wounds / and there with all came out a lady weeping and wryngyng her
hands / And then she said / O knight to much sorrow have thou brought me
/ Why say ye so said sir lancelot / I did never this knight no harm / for
hither by feaute of blood this Brachet brought me / And therefore fair lady be
not displeased with me / for I am full sore agreued of your greuaunce / Truly
sire she said I trow hit be not ye that has slain my husband / for he that
did that deed is sore wounded / and he is never lyckly to recover / that shall I
ensure him / What was your husbands name said sire lau^celot / Sir said she /
his name was called sire Gylbert the bastard one of the best knights of the
world / and he that has slain him I know not his name / Now god send you
better comfort said sire lancelot / and so he departed and went in to the
forest again / and there he met with a damoysel / the which knew him well /
and she said on loud well be ye fond my lord And now I require the on thy
knyghthode help my brother that is sore wounded / and never stynteth bledyng /
for this day he fought with sire gylbert the bastard and slew him in plain
bataylle / and there was my brother sore wounded / and there is a lady a
sorceresse that duelleth in a castle here beside / and this day she told me /
my broders wounds should never be hole till I could find a knight would goo in
to the chapel peryllous / and there he should find a swerd and a blody clothe
that the wounded knight was lapped in / and a pyece of that clothe and swerd
should hele my broders wounds so that his wounds were serched with the sword
and the clothe / This is a merueyllous thing said sire lancelot / but what is
your broders name / Sire she said / his name was sire Melyot de logurs / that
me repents said sire launcelott / for he is a felawe of the table round / and
to his help I will do my power / Then sire said she / follow even this
hyhe way / and it will bring you unto the chapel peryllous / And here I
shall abide till god send you here again / and but you speed I know no knyte
living that may encheue that adventure

Capitulum xv
RYyght so sir Lancelot departed / And when he came unto the chapel peryllous
/ he alyghte down / and teyed his horse unto a lytyl gate / and as soon as he
was with in the church yard / he saw on the frount of the chapel many fair
rich sheldes turned up so down / and many of the sheldes sire lancelot had
seen knights bear before hand / with that he saw by him there stand a xxx
greet knights more by a yard than any man that ever he had seen / and all
tho grieved and gnasted at sire lancelot / And when he saw their countenance
he dred him sore / and so put his shield before him / and took his swerd ready
in his hand ready unto bataylle / and they were al armed in black harneis ready
with her sheldes and her swerdes drawn / And when sir Lancelot would have gone
thorou out them / they scateryd on every side of him / and gaf him the way /
and there with he waxed al bold / and entered in to the chapel / and then he
saw no light / but a dymme lamp brennynge / and then was he ware of a corpse
hylled with a clothe of sylke / Then sire Lancelot stouped down / and cut
a pyece awey of that clothe / and then it ferd under him as the earth had
quaked a little / there with all he feryd / And then he saw a fair swerd lie
by the deed knight / and that he gate in his hand and hyed him out of the
chapel / Anon as ever he was in the chapel yard / all the knights spak to
him with a grymly wys / and said knight sir lancelot leye that swerd from the
or else thou shall dye / whether that I live or dye said sir lancelot with
no great word get ye hit again / therefore fight for it and ye list / Then
right so he passed thorou out them / and by yonde the chapel yard there met
him a fair damoysel and said sir lancelot leave that swerd behind the / or
thou will dye for it / I leave it not said sir lancelot for no treatys / No said
she and thou dydest love that swerd / queen gweneuer should thou never see /
then were I a fool and I would leave this swerd said lancelot / Now gentyl
knight said the damoysel / I require the to kiss me but ones / Nay said sir
lancelot that god me forbede / well sir said she / and thou had kyssed me /
thy life days had been done / but now allas she said I have lost al my labor /
for I ordained this chapel for thy sake / and for sire gawayne / And ones I
had sir Gawayne within me / and at that time he fought with that knight that
lies there deed in yonder chapel sire Gylbert the bastard. and at that time
he smote the lift hand of of sir Gylbert the bastard / And sire Lancelot now
I tell the / I have loved the this seven year / but there may no woman have
thy love but queen Gweneuer / But syth^n I may not rejoice the to have thy
body on live I had kept no more joy in this world / but to have thy body deed
/ Then would I have baumed hit and served hit / and so have kept it my life
days / and daily I should have clypped the / and kyssed the in despyte of Queen
Gweneuer / ye say well said sir lancelot Ihesu preserve me from your subtyle
crafts / And there with all he took his horse and so departed from her / And as
the book says when sir launcelo^ was departed she took such sorou that she
dyed within a fourten night / and her name was Hellawes the sorceresse lady of
the castle Nygramous / Anon sire lancelot met with the damoysel sire
Melyotis sister / And when she saw him she clapped her hands / and wept for
joy And then they rode unto a castle there by where lay sir Melyot / And
anon as sire lancelot saw him / he knew him / but he was passing pale as
the earth for bledyng / when sire Melyot saw sire lancelot he kneled upon his
knees and cried on high / O lord sir lancelot help me / Anon sire lancelot
lepte unto him and touched his wounds with sir Gylbertes sword / And then
he wyped his wounds with a part of the blody clothe that sir gylbert was
wrapped in / and anon on holer man in his life was he never / And then there
was great joy between hem / and they made sir lancelot all the chere that
they might / and so on the morn sire lancelot took his leave / and had
sire Melyot hye him to the court of my lord Arthur / for it draws nyhe to
the feast of pentecoste / and there by the grace of god ye shall find me / and
therewith they departed /

ANd so sire Lancelot rode thorou many strange countries over marys and
valeyes till by fortune he came to a fair castle / and as he paste beyond the
castle / him thought he herd two bellys ring. And then was he ware of a
Faucon came fleing over his head toward an high elm / and long lunys about
her feet / and she flewe unto the elm to take her perch / the lunys over cast
about a bough / And when she would have taken her flyghte / she henge by the
legs fast / and sire lancelot saw how he henge / and byheld the fair
faucon perygot / and he was sorry for her / The mean while came a lady out of
the castle and cried on high O lancelot lancelot as thou art flower of all
knights help me to get my hawk / for and my hawk be lost / my lord will
destroy me / for I kept the hawk and she slypped from me / and if my lord my
husband wete hit / he is so hasty that he will slay me / what is your lords
name said sir Lancelot / sir she said his name is sire Phelot a knight that
longs unto the king of Northgalys / well fair lady syn that ye know my name
and require me of knygthode to help you I will do what I may to get your
hawk / and yet god knows I am an ylle clymber and the tree is passing high
/ and few bows to help me with all / And there with sir lancelot alyte and
teyed his horse to the same tree / and prayed the lady to unarm him / And so
when he was unarmed / he put of all his clothes unto his sherte and breche /
and with might and force he clamme up to the faucon / and teyed the lunys to a
great rotten boyshe / and threw the hawk down and it with all / Anon the
lady gate the hawk in her hand / and there with all came out sire phelot out
of the greuys suddenly / that was her husband al armed / and with his naked
swerd in his hand and said O knight lancelot now have I fond the as I would
and stood at the bole of the tree to slay him / A lady said sire Lancelot why
have ye bytrayed me / She has done said sire Phelot but as I commanded her /
and therefore there nys none other boot but thine hour is come that thou must
dye / That were shame unto the said sir lancelot thou an armed knight to slay
a naked man by treason / thou getest none other grace said sire phelot and
therefore help thy self and thou can / Truly said sire lancelot that shall be
thy shame / but syn thou wylt do none other / take mine harneys with the and
hang my sword upon a bough that I may get hit / and then do thy best to
slay me and thou can / Nay nay said sir Phelot / for I know the better than
thou wenest / therefore thou getest no wepen and I may keep you there fro / Allas
said sir lancelot that ever a knight should dye wepenles / And there with he
waited above him and under him / and over his head he saw a rownsepyk a bygge
bough leueles / and there with he brake it of by the body / And then he came
lower and awayted how his own horse stood / and suddenly he lepte on the ferther
side of the horse froward the knight / And then sir phelot lasshed at him
egerly wenynge to have slain him / But sir Lancelot put aweye the stroke
with the rounsepyk / and there with he smote him on the one side of the head
that he fell down in a swoune to the ground / So then sire lancelot took
his swerd out of his hand and stroke his neck fro the body / Then cried the
lady / Allas why have thou slain my husband / I am not causer said sire
lancelot / for with falshede ye would have had slain me with treson / and now
it is fallen on you both / And then she souned as though she would dye / And
there with all sire lancelot gate al his armor as well as he might / and put hit
upon him for dread of more resort / for he dredde that the knytes castle was
so nygh And so as soon as he might he took his horse and departed and thanked
god that he had escaped that adventure

So sire lancelot rode many wild ways thorou out mareys and many wild
ways / And as he rode in a valey he saw a knight chacynge a lady with a naked
swerd to have slain her / And by fortune as this knyte should have slain this
lady she cried on sir Lancelot and prayed him to rescowe her / When sire
lancelot saw that meschyef / he took his horse and rode between them / saying
knytely for shame / why wolt thou slay this lady / thou do shame unto the and
all knights / what haste thou to do betwyx me and my wife / said the knight /
I will slay her maugre thy head / that shall ye not said sir lancelot / for
rather we two will have adoo to gyders / Sire Lancelot said the knight thou
do not thy part / for this lady has bytrayed me / hit is not so said the
lady / truly he says wrong on me / And for by cause I love and cherysshe my
cosyn germayne / he is Ialous betwixe him and me / And as I shall ansuer to
god three was never sin betwyxe us / But sir said the lady as thou art
called the worshipfullest knight of the world I require the of true knythode
keep me and save me / For what some ever ye say he will slay me / for he is
without mercy / have ye no doubt said lancelot it shall not lie in his power
/ Sir said the knight in your syghte I will be ruled as ye will have me / And
so sir lancelot rode on the one side and she on the other / he had not ryden
but a while / but the knight badde sir Lancelot torn him and look behind
him / and said sire yonder come men of arms after us riding / And so sir
lancelot turned him and thought no treason / and there with was the knight
and the lady on one side / and suddenly he swapped of his ladies head / And when
sir Lancelot had aspyed him what he had done / he said and called him
traitor thou have shamed me for ever / and suddenly sir lancelot alyte of his
horse and pulled out h^s swerd to slay him / and there with all he fell flat to
the earth / and gryped sir lancelot by the thyes and cried mercy / Fie on the
said sir lancelot thou shameful knight thou may have no mercy / and therefore
arise and fight with me / nay said the knight I will never arise till ye
grant me mercy / Now will I profer the fair said lancelot I will unarm me
unto my sherte / and I will have nothing upon me / but my sherte and my swerd
and my hand / And if thou can slay me / quyte be thou for ever / nay sir said
Pedyuere that will I never / well said sir Launcelott take this lady and the
head / and bear it upon the / and here shall thou swear upon my swerd to bear

Sire said he that Will I do by the feithe of my body / Now said lancelot
tell me what is your name / sir my name is Pedyuere / In a shameful hour were
thou borne said lancelot / So Pedyuere departed with the deed lady and the
head / and fond the queen with king Arthur at wynchestre / and there he told
all the truth / Sire knyt said the queen this is an horrible deed and a
shameful / and a great rebuke unto sire launcelott But not withstondynge his

When Arthur held his round table most plenour / it fortuned that he
commanded that the hyhe feast of Pentecost should be holden at a cite and a
Castle the which in tho days was called kynke kenadonne upon the sondes that
marched nyghe walys / So ever the king had a custom that at the feast of
Pentecost in especyal before other feestes in the year he would not goo that day
to mete until he had herd or seen of a great merueylle / And for that custom
all manner of strange adventures came before. Arthur as at that feast before
all other feestes / And so sire Gawayne a lytyl to fore none of the day of
Pentecost aspyed at a wyndowe three men upon horsbak and a dwarf on foot / and
so the three men alighte and the dwarf kept their horses / and one of the three
men was hyher than the other tweyne by a foot and an half Then sir Gawayne
went unto the king and said / sire go to your mete / for here at the hand
comen strange adventures So Arthur went unto his mete with many other kings
/ And there were all the knights of the round table only tho that were
prisoners or slain at a recountre / then at the hyhe feast evermore they
should be fulfilled the hole nombre of an C and fyfty / for then was the round
table fully complisshed Right so came in to the halle two men well bisene and
rychely / and upon their sholders there lened the goodlyest young man and the
fairest that ever they al saw / and he was large and long and broad in the
sholders and well vysaged / and the fairest and the largest handed that ever man
saw / but he ferd as though he might not goo nor bear him self / but if he
lened upon their sholders / Anon as Arthur saw him there was made pees and
rome / and right so they yede with him unto the high deyse with out saying of
any words / Then this much young man pulled him a bak and easily stretched
up streyghte / saying king Arthur god you bliss and al your fair felauship /
and in especial the felauship of the table round / And for this cause I am
come hyder to pray you and require you to give me three yeftes / and they
shall not be vnresonably asked / but that ye may worshipfully and honorably
grant hem me / and to you no great hurt nor loss / And the first done and
gift I will ask now / and the other two yeftes I will ask this day twelve

shall have your askyng

Now sire this is my petycyon for this feast / that ye will give me mete and
drink suffycyauntly for this twelve month / and at that day I will ask mine
other two yeftes

My fair sone said Arthur ask better I counceille the for this is but a simple
asking / for my heart gives me to the gretely that thou art come of men of

right great worship / Sire he said / there of be as it be may I have asked that

end as a porke hog / right so the two men departed and belefte him to sir kay
/ that scorned him and mocked him

Ca ij
THere at was sir Gawayn wroth / and in especyal sir lancelot bad sir kay leave
his mockyng / for I dare lay my head he shall preue a man of great worship /
let be / said sir kay / it may not be by no reason / for as he is / so he has
asked / Beware said sire Lancelot / so ye gafe the good knyt Brewnor sire
Dynadamys brother a name / and ye called him la cote male tail / and that
turned you to anger afterward / As for that said sir kay this shall never
preue none such / For sir Brewnor desired ever worship and this desires breed
and drink / and brothe upon pain of my life he was fostred up in some abbay /
and how someuer it was they failed mete and drink / and so hither he is come
for his sustenaunce And so sire kay badde get him a place and sytte down to
mete / so Beaumayns went to the halle door / and set him down among boys
and laddys / and there he ete sadly / And then sire lancelot after mete
badde him come to his chamber / And there he should have mete and drink enough
/ And so did sire Gawayne / but he reffused hem al / he would do none other /
but as sir kay commanded him for no profer / But as touching sire Gawayn he
had reason to profer him lodgyng mete and drink / for that profer came of his
blood / for he was nere kynne to him than he wist But that as sire lancelot
did was of his great gentylnes and curtosye So thus he was put in to the
kechyn and lay nyghtly as the boys of the kechen did / And so he endured
all that twelve month / and never displeased man nor child / but alweyes he
was meke and mylde / But ever when that he saw any Iustynge of knights /
that would he see and he might / And ever sire lancelot would give him gold to
spend and clothes / and so did sire Gawayne / and where there were any
maystryes done / there at would he be / and there might none cast bar nor
stone to him by two yerdys / Then would sire kay say how lyketh you my boy
of the kechyn / so it past on till the feast of Whytsontyde / And at that time
the king held hit at Carlyon in the most royallest wise that might be /
like as he did yerly / But the King would no mete ete upon the whyysonday until
he herd some adventures / Then came there a squire to the King / and said /
sire ye may goo to your mete / for here comes a damoysel with sum strange
adventures / then was the King glad and set him down / Right so there
came a damoysel in to the halle and salewed the King and prayed him of socour /
for whom said the King what is the adventure / Sire she said I have a lady of
great worship and renomme / and she is byseged with a tyraunte so that she may
not out of her castle / And by cause here are called the noblest knights of
the world / I come to you to pray you of socour / What heteth your lady and
where dwells she / and who is he / and what is his name that has byseged her
/ sire king she said / as for my ladies name that shall not ye know for me as
at this time / but I let you wete she is a lady of great worship and of great
lands / And as for the tyrant that bysyegeth her and destroys her lands he
is called the read knight of the reed laundes / I know him not said the king
/ Sire said sire Gawayne / I know him well for he is one of the perilloust
knights of the world / men say that he has seven mennys strength / and from
him I escaped ones full hard / with my life / Fair damoysel said the king there
ben knytes here would do her power for to rescowe your lady / but by cause ye
will not tell her name nor where she dwells / therefore none of my knights
that here be now shall goo with you by my will / then must I speak further
said the damoysel

Capitulum iij
With these words came before the king Beaumayns while the damoysel was there
/ and thus he said sir King god thank you I have been this xij monethe in your
kechyn and have had my full sustenau^ce and now I will ask my two yeftes that been behind / Ask upon my peril said the king / Sire this shall be my two
gifts / first that ye will grant me to have this adventure of the damoysel /
for hit belongs unto me / thou shall have hit said the king I grant it the
/ then sir this is the other yeft / that ye shall bydde Lancelot du lake to
make me knyt for of him I will be made knight and else of none / And when I am
paste I pray you let him ride after me and make me Knight / when I require
him / All this shall be done said the King / Fie on the said the damoysel /
shall I have none but one that is your kechyn page / then was she wroth and
took her horse and departed / And with that there came one to Beaumayns and told
him his horse and armor was come for him / and there was the dwarf come with
all thing that him neded in the rychest manner / there at all the court had much
merueill fro whens came al ye gere / So when he was armed there was none but
few so goodely a man as he was / and right so as he came in to the halle and
took his leave of king Arthur and sir Gawayn and sir lancelot / and prayed that
he would hyhe after him / and so departed and rode after the damoysel

Capitulum iiij
But there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped in
clothe of gold / but he had neither shield nor spear / Then sir kay said al
open in the halle I will ride after my boy in the kechyn to wete / whether he
will know me for his better / Said sir lancelot and sir gawayn yet abide at
home / So sir kay made him ready and took his horse and his spear and rode after
him / And right as Beumayns ouertook the damoysel / right so came sire kay
and said Beumayns what sire know ye not me / Then he turned his horse / and
knew hit was sir kay / that had done him all the despyte as ye have herd
before / ye said beumayns I know you for an vngentyl knight of the court /
and therefore beware of me / There with sire kay put his spear in the reyste /
and ran streyghte upon him / and beaumayns came as fast upon him with his
swerd in his hand / and so he put awey his spear with his swerd and with a
foyne thrested him thorou the side / that sir kay fell down as he had been
deed / and he alyght down and took sir kayes shield and his spear / and starte
upon his own horse and rode his way / All that saw sir lancelot and so did
the damoysel / And then he badde his dwarf starte upon sir kayes horse / and
so he did / by that sire Lancelot was come / then he proffered sir lau^celot
to Just / and either made hem ready / and they came to gyder so fyersly that
either bare down other to the earth / and sore were they brysed / Then sir
lancelot arose and halpe him fro his horse And then beaumayns threw his
sheld from him / and proffered to fight with sir lancelot on foot / and so
they rasshed to gyders like borys tracynge / rasynge and foynynge to the
mountenaunce of an hour / and sire lancelot felt him so bygge that he
merueylled of his strength / for he fought more lyker a gyaunt than a knight /
and that his fighting was ^urable and passing perilous / For sir lancelot
had so much adoo with him that he dred him self to be shamed / and said
Beumayns fight not so sore / your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may
leave of / Truly that is truth said Beumayns / but it does me good to feel
your might / and yet my lord I showed not the vtteraunce

I had as much to do as I might to save my self fro you vnshamed / and
therefore have ye no doubt of none erthely knight / Hope ye so that I may any
while stand a proved knight said Beaumayns / ye said Lancelot / do as ye have
done / and I shall be your waraunt / Then I pray you said Beaumayns give me
the order of knyghthode / then must ye tell me your name said lancelot /
and of what kynne ye be borne / Sir so that ye will not discover me I shall

and brother unto sir Gawayn of fader and mother / A sir said Lancelot I am more
gladder of you than I was / For ever me thoute ye should be of a great blood /
and that ye came not to the court neither for mete ne for drink / And then
sire Lancelot gaf him thordre of knythode / and then sire Gareth prayed him
for to depart and let him goo / So sire lancelot departed from him and came
to sire kay and maade him to be born home upon his shield / and so he was helyd
hard with the life / and al men scorned sir kay / and in especyal sir Gawayne
and sire lancelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man / for full
little knew he of what birth he is comen / and for what cause he came to this
court / and so we leave sir kay and torn we unto Beaumayns / when he had
overtaken the damoysel / anon she said what do thou here / thou stynkest al

gaynest in king Arthurs kechyn / wonest thou said she that I allow the for
yonder knyt that thou kyllest / Nay truly / for thou slowest him unhappily and
cowardly / therefore torn ageyn bawdy kechyn page / I know the well / for sire
kay named the Beaumayns / what art thou but a luske and a torner of broches
and a ladyl wessher Damoysel said Beaumayns say to me what ye will / I will
not goo from you what someuer ye say / for I have undertake to king Arthur for

shall dye therefore / Fie on the kechyn knave wolt thou fynysshe mine adventure /
thou shall anon be met with all / that thou would not for all the brothe
that ever thou soupest ones look him in the face / I shall assaye said Beaumayns
/ So thus as they rode in the wood / there came a man fleing all that ever he
might / whether wolt thou said Beaumayns / O lord he said / help me / for
here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and bound him / so
I am aferd lest they will slay him / Bring me thither said Beaumayns / and so
they rode to gyders until they came there as was the knight bounden / and
then he rode unto hem / and struck one unto the death / and then another /
and at the third stroke he slew the thyrdde thief / and then the other three
fled / And he rode after hem / and he ouertook hem / and then tho three
thieves turned again and assailed Beaumayns hard / but at the last he slew
them / and returned and unbound the knight / And the knight thanked him / and
prayed him to ride with him to his castle there a little beside / and he should
worshipfully reward him for his good deeds / Sir said Beaumayns I will no
reward have / I was this day made knight of noble sir lancelot / and therefore
I will no reward have / but god reward me / And also I must follow this
damoysel / And when he came nyghe her she bad him ride fro her / for thou
smellyst al of the kechyn / wenest thou that I have Joy of the / for all this
deed that thou have done nys but myshappen the / But thou shall see a syghte
shall make the torn again and that lightly / Then the same knight which was
rescowed of the thieves rode after that damoysel and prayed her to lodge with
him all that night And by cause it was nere night / the damoysel rode with
him to his castle / and there they had great chere / and at souper the knight
sat sir Beumayns before the damoisel / Fie fie said she sir knight ye are
vncurtoys to set a kechyn page before me him bysemeth better to stycke a swyne
than to sytte before a damoysel of hyhe parage / then the knight was ashamed
at her words / and took him up / and set him at aside board / and set him

that his head stonyed / and there with all he fell down in the water / and
there was he drowned / And then he sporyd his horse upon the land / where the
other knight fell upon him / and brake his spear / and so they drew their

and bad her ride forth on her way / Allas she said that ever a kechen page
should have that fortune to destroy such two douty knights / thou wenest thou

by thy might / And the last knight by myshap thou camyst behind him and
myshappely thou slew him / Damoysel said Beaumayns ye may say what ye will /
but with whom someuer I have a do with all I trust to god to serve him or he

/ how be it as ye say that he be no man of worship he is a full lykely person /
and full like to be a strong man / but thus much shall I grant you said the
black knight / I shall put him down upon one foot / and his horse and his
harueys be shall leave with me / for it were shame to me to do him any more

Nay nay she said this unhappy kechen knave has slain your brother thorou
unhappiness / Allas said the grene knight that is great pity that so noble a
knight as he was should so unhappily be slain / and namely of a knaves hand
as ye say that he is / a traitor said the grene knight thou shall dye for
sleynge of my brother / he was a full noble knight and his name was sir Pereard

then they drew their swerdes / and gaf many sad strokes / and either of

And then the grene knight avoided his horse lightly / and dressid him upon

stand ye so long fyghtyng with the kechyn knave / Allas it is shame that
ever ye were made knight to see such a ladde to match such a knight / as
the wede over grew the corn / There with the grene knight was ashamed / and
there with all he gaf a great stroke of might and clafe his shield thorou /
When Beaumayns saw his shield clo^ien a sonder / he was a little ashamed of
that stroke and of her langage / And then he gaf him such a buffet upon the
helm that he fell on his knees / And so suddenly Beaumayns pulled him upon
the ground grouelynge / And then the grene knight cried him mercy / and
yielded him unto sire Beaumayns / and prayed him to slay him not / Al is in vayn
said Beaumayns for thou shall dye but if this damoysel that came with me pray

for I will never be so much in thy danger / Then shall he deye said

doubled his strokes and hurt Beaumayns wonderly sore that the blood ran
down to the ground that it was wonder to see that strong bataille / Yet at

the reed knight he cried mercy saying Noble knight slay me not / and I shall
yield me to the with fyfty knights with me that be at my commandment And I

he was / Loo said she see thou yonder pauelione that is al of the color of
Inde and al manner of thing that there is about men and wymmen / and horses
trapped / sheldes and speres were all of the color of Inde and his name is sir
persant of Inde the most lordlyest knight that ever thou lokest on / Hit may
well be said Beaumayns / but be he never so stout a knight in this field / I
shall abide till that I see him under his shield / A fool said she thou were
better flee by times / why said Beaumayns and he be such a knight as ye make
him he will not set upon me with all his men / or with his / v / C knights
/ For and there come no more but one at ones / I shall him not fail whylest my
life lasts / Fie fie said the damoysel that ever such a stynkynge knave should
blow such a boost / Damoysel he said ye ar to blame so to rebuke me / For I
had lever do five batails / than so to be rebuked / let him come and then
let him do his werst / Sire she said I merueylle what thou art and of what
kyn thou art come / boldly thou spekest / and boldly thou have done / that
have I seen / therefore I pray the save thy self and thou may / for thy horse
and thou have had great traueylle / And I dread we dwell over long from the
sege / For hit is but hens seven mile / and all perilous passages we are past
save al only this passage / and here I dread me sore lest ye shall ketche some
hurt / therefore I would ye were hens that ye were not brysed nor hurt with
this strong knight / But I let you wete this sir Persant of ynde is no thing
of myte nor strength unto the knight that leid the syege about my lady / As
for that said sire Beaumayns be it as it be may / For sythen I am come so
nyghe this knight I will preue his might or I depart from him / and else I
shall be shamed / and I now withdraw me from him / And therefore damoysel have
ye no doubt by the grace of god I shall so dele with this knight that within
two hours after none I shall deliver him And then shall we come to the syege
by day light / O Ihesu merueille have I said the damoysel what manner a man ye
be / for hit may never ben otherwise but that ye be comen of a noble blood /
for so foul ne shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done you /
and ever curtoisly ye have suffered me / and that came never but of a gentyl
blood / Damoysel said Beaumayns a knight may little do that may not suffer a
damoisel / for what someuer ye said unto me / I took none head to your words /
for the more ye said the more ye angryd me / and my wrath I wrekyd upon them
that I had a do with all / And therefore all the myssayenge that ye myssayed me
/ fordered me in my bataill and caused me to think to show and preue my self
at the end what I was / for perauentur thou I had mete in king Arthurs kechyn
/ yet I myt have had mete ynou in other places / but all that I did it for to
preue and assaye my friends / and that shall be known another day / and
whether that I be a gentylman borne or none / I let you wete fair damoysel I
have done you gentilmans seruyfe / and parauentur better / seruyse yet will I
do or I depart from you / Allas she said fair Beaumayns forgive me all that I
have myssaid or done against the / with all my heart said he I forgive it you
/ for ye did no thing but as ye should do / for all your evil words pleasyd me
/ and damoysel said Beaumayns syn hit lyketh you to say thus fair unto me /
wete ye well it gladeth my heart gretely / and now me seems there is no knight
living but I am able enough for him

With this sir Persant of ynde had aspyed them as they houed in the field / and
knytly he sent to them whether he came in werre or in pees / say to thy lord
said beaumayns I take no force / but whether as him list him self / So the
messager went again unto fyr Persaunt / and told him all his ansuer / well
then will I have adoo with him to the vtteraunce / and so he purueyed him
and rode against him / And Beaumayns saw him and made him ready / and there they
met with all that ever their horses might run / and braste their speres
either in three pyeces / and their horses rassed so to gyders that both their
horses fell deed to the / earth and lytly they avoided their horses / and put
their sheldes before them / and drew their swerdes / and gaf many great strokes
that sometime they hurtled to gyder that they fell grouelyng on the ground Thus
they fought two hours and more that their sheldes and their hauberkes were al
for^ewen / and in many stedys they were wounded / So at the last sir Beaumayns
smote him thorou the cost of the body / and then he retrayed him here and
there and knyghtly mayntened his batail long time / And at the last though him
loathe were Beaumayns smote sir Persant above upon the helm that he fell
grouelyng to the earth / and then he lepte upon him overthwart and unlaced
his helm to have slain him / Then sir Persant yielded him and asked him
mercy / with that came ye damoisel and praid to save his life / I will well / for
it were pity this noble knyt should dye / gramercy said Persaunt gentyl knyt and
damoysel / For certeynly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother the
black knight / at the black thorn / he was a full noble knyte / his name was
sir Perard / Also I am sure that ye are he that wanne mine other brother the
grene knight / his name was sire Pertolepe Also ye wanne my brother the reed
knight sir Perrymones / And now syn ye have won these / this shall I do for to
please you ye shall have homage and feaute of me / and an C knights to be
alweyes at your commandment to go and ride where ye will command us / and so
they went unto sir Persauntes pauelione and drank the wine / and ete spyeces
/ and afterward sire Persaunte made him to rest upon a bed until souper time
/ and after souper to bed again / when Beaumayns was abedde sir Persaunt had
a lady a fair douter of xviij year of age and there he called her unto him /
and charged her and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knights
bed / and lie down by his side / and make him no strange chere / but good
chere / and take him in thine arms and kiss him / and look that this be done
I charge you as ye will have my love and my good will So sir Persants daughter
did as her fader bad her / and so she went unto sir Beaumayns bed / and
pryuely she dispoylled her / and leid her down by him / and then he awoke
and saw her and asked her what she was / sire she said I am sir Persants
douter that by the commandment of my fader am come hyder / Be ye a maid or a
wife said he / sir she said I am a clean maiden / God defend said he that I
should defoyle you to do sire Persaunt such a shame / therefore fair damoysel
arise out of this bed or else I will / Sire she said I came not to you by mine
own will but as I was commanded / Allas said sir Beaumayns I were a shameful
knight and I would do your fader any disworship / and so he kyst her and so
she departed and came unto sir Persant her fader / and told him all how she
had spedde / Truly said sire Persaunt what someuer he be / he is comen of a
noble blood / and so we leave hem there till on the morn

ANd so on the morn the damoy^el and sir Beaumayns herd mass and brake their
fast / and so took their leave Fair damoysel said Persant whether ward ar ye
way ledyng this knight / sir she said this knight is going to the sege / that
besyegeth my sister in the castle Dangerus / A a said persaunt that is the
knight of the reed launde / the which is the most peryllous knight that I
know now living / and a man that is withouten mercy / and men sayen that he
has seven men's strength / god save you said he to Beaumayns from ye knight /
for he does great wrong to that lady / and that is great pity / for she is one
of the fairest ladies of the world / and me seems that your damoysel is her
suster / is not your name Lynet said he / ye sir said she / and my lady my
systers name is dame Lioness / Now shall I tell you said sir Persaunt / this
^^rd knight of the reed laund has layne long at the syege well nyghe this two
years / and many times he might have had her and he had would / but he
prolongeth the time to this intent / for to have sir lau^celot du lake to do
bataill with him or sir Trystram or sir Lamerak de galys / or sire Gawayne /
and this is his taryenge so long at the syege / Now my lord sire Persaunt of
ynde said the damoysel Lynet I require you that ye will make this gentilman
knight or ever he fight with the reed knight / I will with all my heart said
sir Persaunt and it please him to take the order of knyghthode of so simple a
man as I am / Sire said Beaumayns I thank you for your good will / for I am
better sped / for certainly the noble knight sir Lancelot made me knight / A
said sir Persant of a more renomed knight might ye not be made knight / For
of all knights he may be called chyef of knyghthode / and so all the world
says that betwix^ three knights is departed clerly knygthode / that is
lau^celot du lake / sir Trystram de lyones and sir Lamerak de galis / these
bear now the renommee / there ben many other knights as sir Palamydes the
sarasyn and sir Sasere his brother / Also sir Bleoberys and sire Blamore de
ganys his brother / Also sir Bors de Ganys and sir Ector de marys and sir
Percyuale de galis / these and many mo ben noble knites / but there be none yt
pass ye iij above said / therefore god speed you well said sir Persant / for and
ye may match the read knight ye shall be called the fourth of the world /
sir said Beaumayns I would feign be of good fame / and of knyghthode / And I
let you wete I came of good men / for I dare say my fader was a noble man / and
so that ye will keep hit in close ^ and this damoysel / I will tell you of what
kyn I am we will not discover you said they both till ye command us by the

Gaheryes / and I am the youngest of hem all / And yet wot not king Arthur nor

So the book says / that the lady that was biseged had word of her systers
coming by the dwerf and a knight with her / and how he had passed all the
perilous passages / what manner a man is he said the lady / he is a noble
knight truly madame said the dwerf and but a young man / but he is as lykely a
man as ever ye saw any / what is he said the damoysel / and of what kynne is
he comen / and of whom was he made knight / Madame said the dwerf he is the
kings sone of Orkeney / but his name I will not tell you as at this time /
but wete ye well of sire lancelot was he maade knight / for of none other would
he be maade knight / and sire kay named him Beaumayns / how escaped he said
the lady from the brethren of Persaunt / Madame he said as a noble knight
should / First he slew two brethren at a passage of a water / A said she
they were good knights but they were murderers / the one hight Gherard de
breusse / and the other knight hight sir Arnolde le Brewse / then madame he
recountred with the black knight / and slew him in plain batail and so he
took his horse and his armor and fout with the grene knight and wanne him in
plain bataill / and in like wise he served the reed knyt / and aftir in the
same wise he served the blewe knyt and wan him in plain batail / then said
the lady he has overcome sir Persau^t of Inde / one of the noblest knytes of
the world / and ye dwerf said he has wo^ne all the iiij brethere^ and slain the
blak knight / and yet he did more tofore he ouerthrewe sir kay and left him
nyghe deed upon the ground / Also he did a great battle with sire lancelot /
and there they departed on even hands / And then sire lancelot made him
knight / Dwerf said the lady I am glad of these tidings / therefore go thou
in an hermytage of mine here by / and there shall thou bear with the of my wyn
in two flagans of silver / they are of two galons / and also two cast of bread
with fat veneson bake and deynte fowls / and a cop of gold here I deliver
the / that is rich and precious and bear all this to mine hermytage / and put
it in the hermytes hands / And sythen go thou unto my sister and great her well
/ and commau^de me unto that gentyl knight / and pray him to ete and to
drink and make him strong / and say ye him I thank him of his curtosye and
goodenes that he would take upon him such labor for me that never did him
bounte nor curtosye / Also pray him that he be of good heart and courage / for
he shall mete with a full noble knight / but he is neither of bounte /
curtosye / nor gentylnes / for he attendyth unto nothing but to murder / and
that is the cause I can not praise him nor love him / So this dwerf departed /
and came to sire Persant where he fond the damoysel lynet and sir Beaumayns /
and there he told hem all as ye have herd / and then they took their leave /
but sir Persant took an ambelyng hacney and conveyed hem on their ways / And
then belefte hem to god / and so within a lytil while they came to that
heremytage / and there they drank the wine / and ete the veneson and the
fowls baken / And so when they had repasted hem well / the dwerf returned ageyn
with his vessel un to the castle again / and there met with him the reed
knight of the reed laundes / and asked him from whens that he came / and where
he had been / Sir said the dwerf I have been with my ladies sister of this castle
and she has been at king Arthurs court / and brought a knight with her /
then I account her trauaille but lost / For though she had brought with
her sire lancelot / sir Trystram / sir Lamerak or sir gawayne / I would think
my self good enough for them all / it may well be said the dwerf / but this
knight has passed all the peryllous passages and slain the klack knight and
other two mo / and won the grene knight / the reed knight and the bl^we
knight / then is he one of these four that I have before reherced / He is
none of tho said the dwerf / but he is a kings sone / what is his name said
the reed knight of the reed laund / that will I not tell you feyd the dwerf /
but sire kay upon scorn named him Beaumayns / I care not said the knight What
knight so ever he be / for I shall soon deliver him / And if I ever match
him he shall have a shameful death as many other have had that were pity said
the dwerf / And it is merueill that ye make such shameful war upon noble
knights

Capitulum xv
NO^ leave we the knight and the dwerf / and speak we of Beaumayns that al nyt
lay in the hermytage / and upon the morn he and the damoysel lynet herd their
mass / and brake their fast / And then they took their horses / and rode
thorou out a fair forest / and then they came to a plain and saw where
were many pauelions and tentys / and a fair castle / and there was much smoke
and great noise / and when they came nere the sege / sir Beaumayns aspyed
upon great trees as he rode / how there henge full goodly armed knights by the
neck and their sheldes about their neckys with their swerdes / and gylt
spores upon their heles / and so there henge nyghe a forty knights
shamefully with full rich arms / Then sir Beaumayns abated his countenance
and said what meneth this / Fair sire said the damoysel abate not your chere
for all this syghte / for ye must courage your self or else ye ben al shente /
for all these knights came hyder to this sege to rescowe my sister Dame lyones
/ and when the reed knight of the reed laund had overcome hem / he put
them to this shameful death without mercy and pity / And in the same wise he
will serve you / but if ye quyte you the better Now Ihesu deffende me said
Beaumayns from such a vylaynous death and shenship of arms / For rather than
I should so be faren with all / I would rather be slain manly in plain bataille
/ So were ye better said the damoysel / for trust not in him is no curtosye
but all goth to the death or shameful murder / and that is pity / for he is a
full lykely / man / well made of body / and a full noble knight of prowess and a
lord of great laundes and possessions / Truly said Beaumayns / he may well be a
good knight / but he uses shameful customs and it is merueylle that he
endures so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthurs have not
dealt with him And then they rode to the dykes and saw them double dyked with
full warly wallis / and there were lodged many great lords nyghe the wallys /
and there was great noise of mynstralsy / and the sea betyd upon the one side
of the walls where were many ships and maryners noise with hale and how And
also there was fast by a Sykamore tree / and there henge an horn the grettest
that ever they saw of an Olyfantes bone / and this knight of the reed laund
had hanged it up there that if there came any arraunt knight / he must blow
that horn / and then will he make him ready and come to him to do bataille
/ But sir I pray you said the damoysel Lynet blow ye not the horn till it be
high none / for now it is about pryme / and now encreaced his might / that
as men say he has seven men's strength / A fie for shame fair damoisel say ye
never so more to me / For and he were as good a knight as ever was I shall
never fail him in his most might / for outher I will win worship
worshipfully or dye knyghtely in the field / and there with he spored his horse
streyghte to the Sykamore tree / and blewe so the horn egerly that all the
sege and the castle range thereof / And then there lepte out knights out of
their tentys and pauelions / and they within the castle looked over the wallis
and out at wyndowes / Then the reed knight of the reed lau^des armed him
hastily / and two barons set on his spores upon his heles / and all was
blood reed his armor spear and shield / And an Earl bucled his helm upon his
head / and then they brought him a read ^pere and a read stead / and so he
rode in to a lytyl vale under the castle / that all that were in the castle and
at the sege might behold the bataill

Capitulum xvj
Sire said the damoysel Lynet unto sir Beaumayns look ye be glad and light /
for yonder is your dedely enemy / and at yonder wyndowe is my lady my sister
dame Lyones / where said Beaumayns / yonder said the damoysel and poynted with
her finger / that is truth said Beaumayns / She besemeth a far the fairest
lady that ever I looked upon and truly he said I ask no better quarrel than now
for to do bataylle / for truly she shall be my lady / and for her I will
fight / And ever he looked up to the wyndowe with glad countenance / And the
lady Lyones made curtosy to him down do the earth with holding up both their
hands / With that the reed knight of the reed laundes callid to sir Beaumayns
/ leave sir knight thy lokynge / and behold me I cou^ceille the / for I warn
the well she is my lady / and for her I have done many strong batails / If thou
have so done said Beaumayns / me seems it was but waste labor / for she
loves none of thy felauship / and thou to love that loves not the / is but
great folly / For and I understood that she were not glad of my coming / I would
be auysed or I did bataille for her / But I understand by the syegyng of this
castle she may forbere thy felauship / And therefore wete thou well thou read
knight of the reed laundes / I love her / and will rescowe her or else to dye
/ Say thou that said the reed knight / me seems / thou ought of reason to
beware by yonder knights that thou saw hang upon yonder trees / Fie for
shame said Beaumayns that ever thou sholdest say or do so evil / for in that
thou shamest thy self and knyghthode / and thou may be sure there will no
lady love the that knows thy wicked custommes And now thou wenest that the
syghte of these hanged knights should fere me / Nay truly not so / that
shameful sight causes me to have courage and hardynes ageynste the more than I
would have had against the / and thou were a well ruled knight / make the ready
said the reed knight of the reed lau^des / and talk no longer with me /
Then sire Beaumayns badde the damoysel goo from him / and then they put
their speres in their reystes and came to gyders with all their myt that they
had both / and either smote other in mids of their sheldes that the
paytrellys / sursenglys / and crowpers b^aste / and fell to the earth both /
and the reynys of their brydels in their hands / and so they lay a great
while sore stonyed that all that were in the castle and in the sege wend their
necks had been broken / and then many a stranger and other said the strange
knyt was a bygge man / and a noble Iuster / for or now we saw never no
knight match the reed knight of the reed laundes / thus they said both
within the castle and without / then lightly they avoided their horses and
put their sheldes before them / and drew their swerdes and ran to gyders like
two fyers lions / and either gafe other such buffets upon their helmes that
they relyd bacward both two strydys / and then they recouerd both and hew
great pyeces of their harneis and their sheldes / that a great part fell in
to the feldes

ANd then thus they fought till it was past none / and never would stynte till
at the last they lacked wind both / and then they stood wagyng and
scateryng pontyng / blowynge and bledynge that all that beheld them for the
most party wept for pity / So when they had restyd them a while / they yede
to bataille again / tracyng racyng foynyng as two bores / And at some time
they took their run as hit had been two rammys and hurtled to gyders that
sometime they fell grouelyng to the earth / And at sometime they were so amassed
that either took others swerd instead of his own / Thus they endured till
euensong time / that there was none that beheld them might know whether was
like to win the bataill / and their armor was so fer hewn that men myt see
their naked sides / and in other places / they were naked / but ever the naked
places they did defend / and the read knight was a wyly knight of werre / and
his wyly fyghtyng taught sir Beaumayns to be wise / but he aboughte hit fulle
sore or he did aspye his fighting / And thus by assente of them both they
granted either other to rest / and so they set hem down upon two molle
hills there besides the fighting place / and either of hem unlaced his helm
/ and took the cold wind / for either of their pages was fast by them to come
wh^ they called to unlace their harneis and to set hem on ageyn at their
commandment / And then when sir Beaumayns helm was of / he looked up to the
wyndowe / and there he saw the fair lady Dame Lyones / and she made him such
countenance that his heart waxed light and Ioly / and there with he bad the
reed knight of the reed laundes make him ready and let us do the bataille to
the vtteraunce / I will well said the / knight / and then they laced up their
helmes / and their pages avoided / and they stepte to gyders and fought
fresshely / but the reed knight of the reed laundes awayted him / and at an
overthwart smote him within the hand / that his swerd fell out of his hand /
and yet he gaf him another buffet upon the helm that he fell grouelynge to
the earth / and the reed knight fell over him / for to hold him down /
Then cried the maiden Lynet on high / O sir Beaumayns where is thy courage
become / Allas my lady my sister beholds the and she sobbeth and wepeth /
that makes mine her te heavy / when sir Beaumayns herd her say so / he abrayed
up with a great might and gate him upon his feet / and lyghtely he lepte to his
swerd and gryped hit in his hand and doubled his paas unto the reed knight and
there they fought a new bataille to gyder / But sir Beaumayns then doubled
his strokes / and smote so thyck that he smote the swerd out of his hand /
and then he smote him upon the helm that he fell to the earth / and sir
Beaumayns fell upon him / and unlaced his helm to have slain him / and
then he yielded him and asked mercy / and said with a loud vois O noble
knight I yield me to thy mercy / Then sir Beaumayns bethoughte him upon the
knights that he had made to be hanged shame fully / and then he said I may
not with my worship save thy life / for the shameful dethes that thou have
caused many full good knights to dye / Sire said the reed knight of the reed
laundes hold your hand and ye shall know the causes why I put hem to so
shameful a death / say on said sir Beaumayns / Sire I loved ones a lady a
fair damoisel / and she had her brother slain / and she said hit was sir
lancelot du lake / or else sir gawayn / and she praide me as that I loved her
hertely that I would make her a promise by the feith of my knyghthode for to
labor daily in arms unto I met with one of them / and all that I might
overcome I should put them unto a vylaynous death / and this is the cause that
I have put all these knights to death / and so I ensured her to do all
the vylony unto king Arthurs knights / and that I should took vengeance upon
all these knights and sir now I will the tell that every day my strength
encreaceth tylle none / and all this time have I seven men's strength

Then came there many Earls and Barons and noble knights and praid that
knight to save his life and take him to your prisoner / And all they fell upon
their knees and prayed him of mercy / and that he would save his life / and sir
they all said it were fairer of him to take homage and feaute / and let him
hold his lands of you than for to slay him / by his death ye shall have none
advantage and his misdeeds that been done may not ben undone / And therefore he
shall make amendys to al parties and we al will become your men and do you
homage and feaute / Fair lords said Beaumayns / wete you well I am full loathe
to slay this knyt nevertheless he has done passing ylle and shamefully / But in
so much all that he did was at a ladies request I blame him the less / and so
for your sake I will releace him that he shall have his life upon this covenant /
that he goo within the castle / and yield him there to the lady / And if she
will forgive and quyte him / I will well / with this he make her amendys of all the
trespass he has done against her and her lands / And also when that is done
that ye goo unto the court of king Arthur / and there that ye ask sir
Lancelot mercy / and sir Gawayn for the evil will ye have had against them /
sire said the reed knight of the reed laundes / all this will I do as ye
command / and syker assurance and borowes ye shall have / And so then when
the assurance was made / he made his homage and feaute / and all tho earls
and barons with him / And then the maiden Lynet came to sire Beaumayns / and
unarmed him and serched his wounds / and stynted his blood / and in like wise
she did to the read knight of the reed laundes / and there they soiourned ten
days in their tents / and the reed knight made his lords and servants to
do all the pleasyre that they might unto sire Beaumayns / And so within a
while the reed knight of the reed laundes yede unto the castle / and put him
in her grace And so she received him upon suffysaunt seurte / so all her
hurtes were well restored of all that she could complain / and then he
departed unto the Court of king Arthur / and there openly the reed knight of
the reed laundes put him in the mercy of sire Lancelot and sir Gawayne / and
there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom / and also he told all
the batails from the beginning unto the ending / Ihesu mercy said king
Arthur and sire Gawayne we merueylle much of what blood he is come / for he is
a noble knight / Have ye no merueille said sire Lancelot / for ye shall right
well wete that he is comen of a full noble blood / and as for his might and
hardynes there ben but few now living that is so mighty as he is / and so
noble of prowess It seems by you said king Arthur that ye know his name /
and fro whens he is come / and of what blood he is / I suppose I do so said
Lancelot / or else I would not have yeuen him thordre of knythode / but he gaf
me such charge at that time that I should never discover him until he required
me or else it be known openly by some other

NOw torn we unto sir Beaumayns that desired of Lynet that he might see her

alarmed him and took his horse and his spear and rode streyt unto the castle /
And when he came to the gate he fond there many men armed and pulled up the

not suffer him to enter / And then he looked up to the wyndow And there he
saw the fair Lyones that said on high go thy way / sir Beaumayns / for as yet
thou shall not have holy my love unto the time that thou be called one of the
nombre of the worthy knights / And therefore goo labor in worship this twelve

Beaumayns I have not deserved that ye should show me this straungenes / and I
had wend that I should have right good chere with you and unto my power I have
deserved thank / and well I am sure I have boughte your love with part of the

night / And then it happend him to come to a pour man's house and there he
was herborowed all that night / But sir Braumayns had no rest but walowed
and wrythed for the love of the lady of the castle / And so upon the morrow he
took his horse and rode un till vnderne / and then he came to a broad water /
and there by was a great lodge / and there he alyghte to sleep and leid his
head upon the shield / and bitoke his horse to the dwarf / and commanded him to
watch al night / Now torn we to the lady of the same castle / that thought
much upon Beaumayns / and then she called unto her sir Gryngamore her brother
/ and praid him in all manner as he loved her hertely that he would ride after sir
Beaumayns / and ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find him slepynge / for
I am sure in his heaviness he will alyt down in some place / and leye him down to
sleep / And therefore have ye your wait upon him / and in the preuyest manner ye
can take his dwerf / and go ye your way with him as fast as ever ye may or
sir Beaumayns awake / For my sister Lynet tells me that he can tell of what
kynreed he is come / and what is his right name / And the mean while I and my
sister will ride unto your castle to awayte when ye bring with you the
dwerf / And then when ye have brought him unto your Castle / I will have
him in examynacion my self / unto the time that I know what is his right name
/ and of what kynred he is come / shall I never be merry at my heart Sister
said sire Gryngamore all this shall be done after your entente / And so he
rode all the other day and the night tylle that he fond sire Beaumayns
lyenge by a water and his head upon his shield for to sleep / And then when
he saw sire Beaumayns fast on sleep / he came stylly stalkyng behind the dwerf
and plucked him fast under his arm / and so he rode aweye with him as fast
as ever he might unto his own castle And this sire Gryngamors arms were all
black and that to him longs / But ever as he rode with the dwerf toward his
castle / he cried unto his lord / and prayed him of help / And there with awoke
sire Beaumayns / and up he lepte lightly / and saw where the Gryngamor rode
his way with the dwerf / and so sir Gryngamor rode out of his syghte /

Then sire Beaumayns put on his helm anon / and buckeled his shield / and
took his horse / and rode after him all that ever he might ride thorou marys
and feldes and great dales / that many times his horse and he plonged over the
head in deep myres / for he knew not the wey / but took the gaynest way in
that woodenes that many times he was like to perysshe / And at the last him
happend to come to a fair grene way And there he met with a pour man of
the countreye whom he salewed and asked him / whether he met not with a
knight upon a black horse and all black harneis a little dwerf sitting behind
him with heavy chere / Sire said this pour man here by me came sire Gryngamor
the knight with such a dwerf morning as ye say / and therefore I read you not
follow him / For he is one of the perylloust knights of the world / and his
castle is here nyhe hand but two mile / therefore we advise you ride not after
sir Gryngamor but if ye owe him good will / So leave we sire Beaumayns riding
toward the castle and speak we of sir Gryngamor and the dwerf / Anon as the
dwerf was come to the castle / dame Lyones and dame Lynet her sister asked the
dwerf where was his master borne / and of what lygnage he was come / And but
if thou tell me said dame Lyones thou shall never escape this castle / but
ever here to be prisoner As for that said the dwerf I fere not gretely to tell
his name and of what kynne he is come / wete ye well he is a kings sone / and
his mother is sister to king Arthur / and he is brother to the good knight of
sire Gawayne / and his name is sire Gareth of Orkeney / and now I have told you
his right name / I pray you fair lady let me goo to my lord again / for he
will never out of this country vn^yl that he have me again / And if he be
angry / he will do much harm or that he be stynte / and worche you wrake in
this countray As for that thretyng said sir Gryngamore be it as it be may we
will goo to dinner / and so they washed and went to mete / and made hem merry
and well at ease / by cause the lady Lyones of the castle was there / they made
great Joy

Truly Madame said Lynet unto her sister well may he be a kings sone / for he
has many good tatches on him / for he is curteis and mylde and the most
sufferynge man that ever I met with all / For I dar say there was never
gentylwoman reulyd man in so foul a manner / as I have rebuked him / And at
all times he gafe me goodely and meke ansuers again And as they sat thus
talking / there came sire Gareth in at the gate with an angry countenance and
his swerd drawn in his hand / and cried aloude that all the castle myt here
hit saying thou traitor sire Gryngamor deliver me my dwerf ageyn / or by the
feith that I owe to the order of knygthode I shall do the all the harm that I
can / Then sir Gryngamor looked out at a wyndow and said sir gareth of
Orkeney leave thy bostyng words / for thou getest not thy dwerf again / Thou
coward knight said sir Gareth bring him with the / and come and do bataylle
with me / and win him and take him / So will I do said sir Gryngamor and me
list / but for all thy great words thou getest him not / A fair brother said
dame Lyones I would he had his dwerf again / for I would he were not wroth / for
now he has told me al my desire I keep no more of the dwerf And also brother he
has done much for me / and delyuerd me from the reed knight of the reed
laundes / and therefore brother I owe him my seruyse before al knights living /
And wete ye well that I love him before al other / and full feign I would speak
with him / But in no wise I would that he wist what I were / but that I were
another strange lady / well said sir Gryngamor sythen I know now your will /
I will obey now unto him / And right there with all he went down unto sir
Gareth / and said sir I cry you mercy / and all that I have mysdone I will
amend hit at your will / And therefore I pray you that ye would alyghte / and
take such chere as I can make you in this castle / Shall I have my dwerfe said
sire Gareth / ye sir / and all the pleasaunce that I can make you / for as
soon as your dwerf told me what ye were and of what blood ye ar come / and
what noble deeds ye have done in these marches / then I repentyd of my deeds
/ And then sire Gareth alyghte / and there came his dwerf and took his horse /
O my felawe said sir gareth / I have had many adventures for thy sake / And so
sire Gryngamor took him by the hand / and led him in to the halle where his
own wife was

ANd then came forth Dame Lyones arrayed like a pryncesse / and there she made
him passing good chere and he her again / and they had goodely langage and
lovely countenance to gyder / And sire Gareth thought many times Ihesu would
that the lady of the castle perilous were so fair as she was / there were al
manner of games and plays of dauncyng and singing / And ever the more sire
Gareth bihelde that lady / the more he loved her / and so he brenned in love
that he was past him self in his reason / and forth toward night they yede
unto souper / and sire Gareth might not ete for his love was so hot, that he
wist not where he was All these lokes aspyed sir Gryngamor / and then at
after souper he callid his sister Dame Lyones unto a chamber / and said / fair
sister I have well aspyed your cou^tenau^ce betwixe you and this knight / And I
will sister that ye wete he is a full noble knyt / and if ye can make him to
abide here I will do him all the pleasyr yt I can / for and ye were better than
ye ar ye were well bywaryd upon him / Fair breder said Dame lyones I understand
well that the knight is good and come he is of a noble house / Notwithstanding I
will assaye him better how be it I am most beholding to him of any erthely
man for he has had great labor for my love / and passid many a dangerous
passage / Right so sir Gryngamor went unto sir Gareth and said sire make ye
good chere / for ye shall have none other cause / for this lady my sister is
yours at al times her worship saved / for wete ye well she loves you as well as
ye do her and better / if better may be / And I wist that said sir Gareth /
there lived not a gladder man than I would be Upon my worship said sir Gryngamor
trust unto my promise And as long as it lyketh you ye shall soiourne with me and
this lady shall be with us daily and nyghtly to make you all the chere that she
can / I will well said sire Gareth / For I have promised to be nyghe this
country this twelve month / And well I am sure king Arthur and other noble
knights will find me where that I am within this twelfe month / For I shall
be sought and founden if that I be on live And then the noble knight sire
Gareth went unto the dame Lyones which he then much loved / and kyst her
many times / and either made great Joy of other / And there she promised him
her love certainly to love him and none other the days of her life / Then
this lady dame Lyones by the assente of her brother told sir Gareth all the
troth what she was / And how she was the same lady that he did batail for /
and how she was lady of the castle peryllous / and ^here she told him how she
caused her brother to take awey his dwerf

FOr this cause to know the certaynte what was your name / and of what kynne
ye were come / And then she let fetch tofore him Lynet the damoysel that
had ryden with him many wylsome ways / Then was sire Gareth more gladder
than he was to fore / And then they troth plyte each other to love / and
never to faylle whiles their life lasts / And so they burnt both in love
that they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly / And there Dame Lyones
counceylled sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in the halle / And
there she promised him to come to his bed a little before mydnyght / This
council was not so pryuely kept but it was understand / for they were but
young both and tendyr of age / and had not used none such crafts to forne /
Wherefore the damoysel Lynet was a little displeased / and she thought her sister
Dame Lyones was a little over hasty / that she might not abide the time of her
marriage / And for saving their worship / she thought to abate their hot
lusts / And so she let ordeyne by her subtyl crafts that they had not their
ententes neither with other as in her delytes / until they were married / And
so it past on / At after souper was made clean auoydaunce / that every lord
and lady should / goo unto his rest / But sir Gareth said plainly he would goo
no ferther than the halle / for in such places he said was conuenyent for an
arraunt knyt to take his rest in / and so there were ordained great couches /
and thereon fether ^ beds / and there leyde him down to sleep / and within a
while came dame Lyones wrapped in a mantel furred with Ermyne and leid her down
besides sir gareth / And there with all he began to kiss her / And then
he looked before him and there he apperceyued and saw come an armed knight with
many lyghtes about him / and saw come an armed knyt with many lyghtes about
him / and this knight had a long Gysarme in his hand / and maade grym
countenance to smite him / When sire Gareth saw him come in that wise / he
lepte out of his bed and gate in his hand his swerd and lepte strayte toward
that knight / And when the knight saw sir Gareth come so fyersly upon him /
he smote him with a foyne thereon the thycke of the thy that the wound was a
shaftmon broad and had cut a two many veins and senewes / And there with all
sir Gareth smote him upon the helm such a buffet that he fell grouelyng /
and then he lepte over him and unlaced his helm and smote of his head fro
the body / And then he bledde so fast that he might not stand / but so he
leid him down upon his bed / and there he swouned and lay as he had been deed
Then dame Lyones cried alowde / that her brother sir Gryngamor herd / and came
down / And when he saw sir ^ Gareth so shamefully wounded / he was sore
displeased and said I am shamed that this noble knight is thus honored / Sir
said sir Gryngamore hou may this be / that ye be here / and this noble knight
wounded / Brother she said I can not tell you For it was not done by me nor by
mine assente / For he is my lord and I am his / and he must be mine husband /
therefore my brother I will that ye wete I shame me not to be with him / nor to
do him all the pleasyr that I can / Sister said sire Gryngamore / and I will
that ye wete it and sir Gareth both that it was never done by me nor by my
assente that this unhappy deed was done / And there they staunched his bledynge
as well as they might / and great sorou made sir Gryngamor and Dame Lyones / And
forth with all came Dame Lynet and took up the head in the syghte of hem all /
and enoynted it with an oynement there as it was smyten of / and in the same
wise she did to the other part there as the head stak / And then she set
it to gyders / and it stak as fast as ever it did And the knight arose
lyghtely up / and the damoysel Lynet put him in her chamber / All this saw
sir Gryngamor and dame Lyones / and so did sir Gareth / and well he espied that
it was the damoysel Lynet that rode with him thorou the peryllous passages / A
well damoysel said sire Gareth I wend would not have done as ye have done / My
lord Gareth said Lynet / all that I have done I will auowe / and all that I
have done shall be for your honor and worship / and to us all / And so
within a while sir Gareth was nyghe hole / and waxid light and Iocound / and
sange / daunced and gamed / and he and dame Lyones were so hot in brennynge
love that they made their couenaunte at the tenth night after that she should
come to his bed / And by cause he was wounded before / he laid his armor /
and his swerd nyghe his beds side

Right as she promised she came / and she was not so soon in his bed / but
she aspyed an armed knight coming toward the bed / there with all she
warned sir Gareth / and lightly thorou the good help of Dame Lyones he was
armed / and they hurtled to gyders with great Ire and malice al about the
halle / and there was great light as it had been the nombre of xx torches both
before and behynd / so that sir Gareth strayned him / so that his old wound
braste again on bledyng / but he was hot and couragyous and took no keep /
but with his great force he stroke down that knight / and voyded his helm /
and struck of his head / Then he hew the head in an honderd pyeces / And
when he had done so he took up all tho pyeces and threw hem out at a wyndow
in to the dyches of the castle / and by this done / he was so faint that
uneaths he might stand for bledyng / And by then he was al most unarmed /
he fell in a dedely swoune in the ^lore / And then dame Lyones cried so
that sir Gryngamor herd / And when he came and fond sir Gareth in that plyte he
made great sorou / and there he awaked sir Gareth / and gaf him a drink that
releued him wonderly well / but the sorou that Dame Lyones made there may no
tongue tell / for she so faryd with her self as she would have dyed / Right
so came this damoysel Lynet before hem al / and she had fette all the gobbets
of the head that sir Gareth had thrown out at a wyndowe / and there she
enoynted hem as she had done to fore / and set them to gyder ageyn / well
damoisel Lynet said sire Gareth / I have not deserved all this despyte that ye
do unto me / sir knight she said / I have no thing do / but I will auowe /
And all that I have done shall be to your worship and to us al / And then was
sire Gareth stau^ched of his bledyng But the le^^s said / that there was no man
that bare the life / should bele him thorou out of his wound / but if they
he^ed him that caused that stroke by enchauntement / So leave we sir Gareth
there with sir Gryngamore and his systers / and torn we unto king Arthur that
at the next feast of Pentecost held his feast / and there came the grene knyt
with fyfty knights / and yielded hem all unto king Arthur / And so there came
the reed knight his brother / and yielded him to king Arthur and three s^ore
knights with him / Also there came the blewe knight to brother to them with an
honderd knights / and yielded hem unto king Arthur / and the grene knights
name was Partolype / and the reed knights name was Perymones / and the blewe
knights name was sir Persant of Inde / these three brethren told king Arthur
how they were overcome by a knight that a damoysel had with her / and called
him Beaumayns / Ihesu said the king I merueylle what knight he is / and of
what lygnage he is come / He was with me a twelve monethe / and pourely and
shamefully he was ^ostred / and sire kay in scorn named him Beaumayns / So
right as the king stood so talkyng with these three brethren / there come sir
Lancelot du lake and told the king that there was come a goodly lord with vj
C knghtes with him / then the king went out of Carlyon / for there was the
feast / and there came to him this lord / and ^alewed the king in a goodly
manner / What will ye said king Arthur / and what is your erand / Sir he said
my name is the reed knight of the reed laundes / but my name is sir Ironsyde /
and sire wete ye well / here I am sent to you / of a knight that is called
Beaumayns / for he wanne me in plain bataille hand for hand / and so did
never no knight but he that ever had the better of me this xxx winter / the
which commanded to yield me to you at your will / ye are welcome said the
king / for ye have been long a great foo to me and my Court / and now I trust
to god I shall so entreat you that ye shall be my friend / Sire / both I and
these five honderd knights shall alweyes be at your somons to do you seruyse
as may lie in our powers / Ihesu mercy said king Arthur I am much beholdynge
unto that knight / that has put so his body in deuoyre to worship me and my
Court / And as to the Ironsyde that art called the reed knight of the reed
laundes thou art called a peryllous knyt And if thou wylt hold of me I shall
worship the (...) make the knight of the table round / but then thou must
be no more a murderer / Sire as to that I have promised unto sire Beaumayns
never more to use such custommes / for all the shameful customs that I used I
did at the request of a lady that I loved / and therefore I must goo unto sir
Lancelot and unto sire Gawayne / and ask them foryeuenes of the evil will I
had unto them / for all that I put to death was al only for the love of sir
Lancelot and of sir Gawayne / They ben here now said the king before the / now
may ye say to them what ye will / And then he kneled down unto sire
Lancelot and to sire Gawayne and prayed them of foryeuenes of his enemytee that
ever he had ageynste them /

Then goodely they said al at ones / god foryeue you and we do / and pray
you that ye will tell us where we may find sir Beaumayns / Fair lords said
sir Ironsyde I can not tell you / for it is full ^ard to find him / for such
young knights as he is one / when they be in their adventures ben never
abiding in no place / But to say the worship that the reed knight of the
reed laundes and sir persaunt and his brother said of Beaumayns / it was merueil
to here / Well my fair lords said king Arthur / wete you well / I shall do
you honor for the love of sir Beaumayns / and as soon as ever I mete with him
I shall make you al upon one day knights of the table round / And as to the
sire Persaunt ^o Inde thou have ben ever called a full noble knight / and so
have ever ben thy three brethren called / But I merueil said the king that I
here not of the black knyt your brother / he was a full noble knight / Sir said
Pertolype the grene knyt sir Beaumayns slew him in a recou^tre with his spear
/ his name was sir Perard / that was great pity said the king and so said
many knights / For these four brethren were full well known in the court of
king Arthur for noble knights / for long time they had holden werre against
the knights of the round table / Then said Pertolepe the grene knight to
the king at a passage of the water of mortay^e there encountered sir
Beaumayns with two brethren that ever for ^he most party kept that passage /
and they were two dedely knights / and there he slew the eldest brother in the
water / and smote him upon the heed such a buffet that he fell down in the
water / and there he was drouned / and his name was sir Garard le brewse / and
after he slew the other brother upon the land / his name was sir Arnold le
brewse /

So then the king and they went to mete / and were served in the best
manner / And as they satte at the mete / there came in the queen of Orkeney with
ladies and knytes a great nombre / And then sir Gawayn / sir Agrauayn and
Gaherys arose / and went to her / and salewed her upon their knees / and asked
her blyssyng / For in xv year they had not seen her / Then she spak on high
to her brother king Arthur / where have ye done my young sone sir Gareth / he
was here amongst you a twelve month / and ye made a kechyn knave of him / the
which is shame to you all / Allas where have ye done my dear sone that was my
Joy and bliss / O dear mother said sir Gawayn I knew him not / Nor I said the
king that now me repents / but thanked be god he is preued a worshipful
knight as any is now living of his years / and I shall never be glad till I may
find him / A brother said the queen unto king Arthur and unto sir Gawayne and
to all her sons / ye did your self great shame when ye amongst you kept my
sone in the kechyn and fed him like a pour hog / Fair sister said king
Arthur ye shall right well wete / I knew him not / nor no more did sire Gawayn
/ nor his brethren / but sythen hit is s^o said the king that he is thus gone
from us all / we must shape a remedy to find him / Also sister me seems ye
might have done me to wete of his coming / And then and I had not done well
to him / ye myt have blamed me / For when he came to this court he came ^enyng
upon two men's sholders as though he might not have gone / And then he asked
me three yeftes / and one he asked the same day / that was that I would give him
mete enough that twelve month / and the other two yeftes he asked that day a
twelve month / and that was that he might have thaduenture of the damoysel
Lynet / and the third was that sire Lancelot should make him knight when he
desired him / And so I granted him all his desire / and many in this Court
merueilled that he desired his sustenaunce for a twelf monethe / And there by
we demed / many of us that he was not come of a noble house / Sire said the
Queen of Orkeney unto king Arthur her brother / wete ye well that I sent him
unto you right well armed and horsed and worshipfully bysene of his body / and
gold and silver plente to spend / it may be said the king / but thereof ^awe
we none / sauf that same day as he departed from us / knights told me that
there came a dwerf hyder suddenly and brought him armor and a good horse full well
and rychely by^ene / and there at we al had merueille / fro whens that richesse
came / that we demed all that he was come of men of worship / Brother said the
Queen all that ye say I believe / for ever sythen he was grown / he was
merueillously wytted / and ever he was feythful and true of his promise / But
I merueille said she that sire kay did mock him and scorn him / and gaf him
that name Beaumayns / yet sir kay said the queen named him more ryghteuously
than he wend / For I dare say and he be on live / he is as fair an handed man
and well disposed as any is living / Sire said Arthurle te this langage be
stylle / and by the grace of god he shall be found / and he be within these
seven royames / and let all this pass and ^e merry / for he is proved to be a
man of worship / and that is my Joy

Then said sir Gawayne and his brethren unto arthur / sire and ye will give
us leave we will go and seek our brother / Nay said sir Lancelot that shall
ye not need / and so said sir Bawdewyn of Bretayne / for as by our aduys the
king shall send unto dame Lyones a messager / and pray her that she will
come to the court in all the have that she may / and doubt ye not she will
come / And th^ne she may give you best cou^ceille where ye shall find him This
is well said of you said the king / So then goodely letters were made / and
the messager sent forth that night and day he went till he ^am unto the
castle perilous / And then the lady dame Lyones was sent fore there as she
was with sir Gryngamor her brother and sire Gareth / and when she understood
this message / she badde him ride on his way unto king Arthur / and she would
come after in all goodely have Then when she came to sir Gryngamor and to sir
Gareth she told hem al how king Arthur had sent for her / that is by cause of
me said sir Gareth / Now auyse me said dame Lyones what shall I say and in
what manner I shall rule me / My lady and my love said sir Gareth I pray you in
no wise be ye aknowen where I am / but well I wot my mother is there and all my
brethren / and they will take upon hem to seek me / I wot well that they do
/ But this madame I would ye said and aduysed the king when he questyoned with
you of me / Then may ye say / this is your aduys that and hit like his good
grace / ye will do make a cry against the feast of thassumpcion of our lady
that what knight there preueth him best he shall welde you and all your land /
And if so be that he be a wedded man that his wife shall the degree and a
coronal of gold besette with stones of virtue to the valewe of a thousand pound
and a white Iarfaucon / So dame Lyones departed / and came to king Arthur
where she was nobly received / and there she was sore questyoned of the king
and of the queen of Orkeney / And she ansuerde where sir Gareth was she could
not tell / But thus much she said unto Arthur / sire I will let cry a
turnement that shall done before my castle at the Assumpcion of our lady /
and the cry shall be this that you my lord Arthur shall be there / and your
knights / and I will puruey that my knights shall be against yours / And
thennne I am sure ye shall here of sir Gareth / this is well aduysed said king
Arthur / and so she departed / And the king and she maade great prouysyon to
that turnement / when dame Lyones was come to the isle of Auylyon that was the
same isle there as her brother sir Gryngamor dwelte / then she told hem al how
she had done / and what promise she had made to king Arthur / Allas said sir
Gareth / I have been so wounded with unhappiness sythen I came in to this castle
that I shall not be abyl to do at that turnement like a knight / for I was
never thorouly hole syn I was hurt / Be ye of good chere said the damoysel
Lynet / for I vndertak^ within these xv days to make you hole and as lusty as
ever ye were / And then she leid an oynement and a salve to him as it pleasyd
to her that he was never so fressh nor so lusty / Then said the damoysel
Lynet / send you unto sir Persaunt of ynde / and assomone him and his knights
to be here with you as they have promised / Also that ye send unto sir Ironsyde
that is the reed knight of the reed laundes / and charge him that he be ready
with you with his hole sum of knights / and then shall ye be abyl to
match with king Arthur and his knights / So this was done and all knights
were sent for unto the castle peryllous / and then the reed knight ansuerd
and said unto dame Lyones and to sire Gareth / Madame and my lord sir Gareth ye
shall understand that I have been at the court of king Arthur and sire Persaunt
of Inde and his brethren / and there we have done our homage as ye commanded
us / Also sir Ironsyde said I have taken upon me with sire Persaunt of Inde and
his brethren to hold party against my lord sir Lancelot and the knights of
that court / And this have I done for the love of my lady Dame Lyones and you
my lord sir Gareth / ye have well done said sir Gareth / But wete you well ye
shall be full sore matched with the most noble knights of the world / there for
we must purueye us of good knights where we may get them / That is well said
/ said sir Persaunt and worshipfully And so the cry was made in England /
walis and scotland Ireland / Cornewaille / and in all the out Isles and in
bretayn and in many countries that at the feast of our lady the assumpcion
next coming men should come to the castle peryllous beside the isle of Auylyon /
And there all the knights that there came should have the choice whether them
list to be on the one party with the knights of the castle or on the other
party with king Arthur / And two months was to the day that the turnement
should be / and so there came many good knytes that were at her large and held
hem for the most party against king Arthur and his knights of the round
table / came in the side of them of the castle / For sir Epynogrus was the first
/ and he was the kings sone of Northumberland / and sir Palamydes the sarasyn
was another / and sir Safere his brother / and sire Segwarydes his brother / but
they were crystned / and sire Malegryne another / and sir Bryan des les Ilelys
a noble knight / and sir Grummore gummursum a good knight of Scotland / and
sir Carados of the dolorous toure a noble knight and sir Turquyn his brother /
and sir Arnold and sire Gauter two brethren good knights of Cornewaile /
there came sir Trystram de lyones / and with him sir Dynadas the seneschal / and
sir Saduk / / but this sir Tristram was not at that time knight of the table
round / but he was one of the best knights of the world / And so all these
noble knights accompanied hem with the lady of the castle and with the reed
knight of the reed laundes / but as for sir Gareth he would not take upon him

Now leave we of these kings and knights / and let us speak of the great
array that was made within the castle and about the castle for both parties /
the lady Dame Lyones ordained great array upon her party for her noble knights
for all manner of lodgyng and vytaille that came by land and by water that there
lacked no thing for her party nor for the other but there was plente to be had
for gold and silver for king Arthur and his knights / And then there came the

knight of the reed laundes / and sir Persant and his brother / and sire
Gryngamor that in no wise there should none of them tell not his name and make
no more of him than of the leest knight that there was / for he said I will
not be known of neither more ne less / neither at the beginning neither at
the ending Then Dame Lyones said unto sir Gareth / sire I will leave you a
ring / but I would pray you as ye love me hertely let me have it again when
the turnement is done / For that ring encreaceth my beauty much more than it
is of him self / And the virtue of my ring is that / that is grene it will
torn to reed / and that is reed it will torn in lykenes to grene / And that is
blewe it will torn to lykenes of white / and that is white it will torn in
lykenes to blewe / and so it will do of al manner of colors / Also who that
bears my ring / shall lose no blood / and for great love I will give you this
ring / Gramercy said sir Gareth mine own lady / for this ring is passing mete
for me / for hit will torn al manner of lykenes that I am in / and that
shall cause me that I shall not be known / Then sir Gryngamor gaf sir
Gareth a bay courser that was a passing good horse / Also he gafe him good
armoure and sure and a noble swerd that sometime sire Gryngamors fader wanne
upon an hethen Tyrant / And so thus every knight made him ready to that

Also there came queen Gweneuer and the queen of Orkeney sir Gareths mother / And

time at his again coming he seemed blewe / And thus at every course that he ro^e
to and fro he changed his color so that there might neither king nor knight
have ready conguyssaunce of him / Then sir Anguyssaunce the king of Irland

said king Arthur that fame knight with the many colors is a good knight /
wherefore the king called unto him sir Lancelot and praid him to encountre with
that knight / Sir said Lancelot I may well find in my heart for to forbere
him as at this time / for he has had trauail enough this day / and when a
good knight does so well upon sum day / it is no good knights part to
let him of his worship / And namely when he sees a Knight has done so
great labor / for peradventure said sir Lancelot his quarrel is here this day
/ and perauentur he is best byloued with this lady of all that ben here / for I
see well / he payneth him and enforces him to do great deeds / and therefore said
sir lancelot as for me this day he shall have the honor / though it lay in my
power to put him fro it / I would not

Then when this was done / there was drawing of swerdes / And then there
began a sore turnement And there did sir Lamerak merueyllous deeds of arms /
and betwixe sir Lamerak and sire Ironsyde that was the reed knight of the reed
lau^des there was strong batail / and betwix sire Palamides and Bleoberys there
was a strong batail / and sir Gawayne and sir Trystram met / and there sir

Turquyne / and he him / and then came sir Caradus his brother / and both at
ones they assaylled him / and he as the most noblest knight of the world
worshipfully fought with hem both / that al men wondered of the noblesse of
sir lancelot / And then came in sir Gareth and knew that it was sir
lancelot that fought with tho two peryllous knights / And then sir Gareth
came with his good horse and hurtled hem in sonder / and no stroke would he smite
to sir Lancelot / that aspyed sir lancelot and demed it should be the good
knight sire Gareth / and then sir Gareth rode here and there / and smote on
the right hand and on the lift hand that all the folk might well aspye where
that he rode / and by fortune he met with his brother sir Gawayn / and there
he put sir Gawayne to the werse / for he put of his helm / and so he served
five or six knights of the round table that all men said / he put him in
the most pain / and best he did his deuoyr / For when sir Trystram beheld him
how he first Iusted and after fought so well with a swerd / Then he rode unto
sir Ironsyde and to sire Persaunt of ynde and asked hem by their feythe / what
manner a knight is yonder knight that seems in so many diverse colors /
Truly me seems said Trystram that he puts him self in great pain for he
never cease / Wot ye not what he is said sir Ironsyde / No said sir Trystram
/ then shall ye know that this is he that loves the lady of the castle and
she him again / and this is he that wannne me when I byseged the lady of this
castle / and this he that wanne sir Persaunt of ynde / and his three brethren /
what is his name said sir Trystram and of what blood is he come / he was called
in the court of king Arthur Beaumayns / but his ryt name is sir Gareth of
Orkeney brother to sir Gawayn / by my head said sir Tristram he is a good knit
knight and a bygge man of arms / and if he be young he shall preite a full
noble knight / he is but a child they all said and of sir Lancelot he was
made knyt / therefore is he mykel the better said Trystram / And then sir
Trystram / sir Iron^yde / sir Persaunt and his brother rode to gyders for to
help sir gareth / and then there were given many strong strokes / And then
sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm / and then said his
dwerf take me your ryng that ye lose it not while that ye drink / And so when
he had dronken he gat on his helm / and egerly took his horse and rode in to
the field and left his ring with his dwerf / and the dwerf was glad the
ryng was from him / for then he wist well he should be known And then when
sir Gareth was in the field all folks saw him well / and plainly that he was
in yelowe colors / and there he rassyd of helmes and pulled down knytes that
king Arthur had merueylle what knyt he was / for the king saw by his here
that it was the same knight

Capitulum xxxj
But by fore he was in so many colors and now he is but in one color that is
yelowe / Now goo said king Arthur unto diverse heroudes and ride about him and
aspye what manner knight he is / for I have speryd of many knights this day
that been upon his party / and all say they know him not / And so an heroude
rode nyhe Gareth as he could / and there he saw written about his helm in
gold / This helm is sir gareth of Orkeney / Then the heroude cried as he
were wood / and many heroudes with him / This is sire gareth of Orkeney in the
yelowe arms that by all kings and knights of Arthurs beheld him and awayted
/ and then they pressyd al to behold him / and ever the heroudes cried this
is sire gareth of Orkeney king Lots sone / and when sir gareth aspyed that he
was discoueryd / then he doubled his strokes / and smote down sir Sagramore
and his brother sir gawayn / O brother said sir gawayn I wend ye would not have
stryken me / so when he herd him say so he thrang here and there / and so with
great pain he gat out of the prees / and there he met with his dwerf / O
boy said sir gareth thou have begyled me foul this day that thou kept my
ring / Give it me anon ageyn that I may hyde my body with all / and so he
took it him / And then they all wist not where he was become / and sir
gawayn had in manner aspyed where sir Gareth rode / and then he rode after
with all his might / that aspyed sir Gareth and rode lyghtely in to the
forest that sir Gawayn wist not where he was become / And when sir Gareth wist
that sir Gawayn was past / he asked the dwerf of best counceil / Sir said the
dwerf / me seems it were best now that ye are escaped fro spyeng that ye send
my lady dame lyones her ring / It is well aduysed said sir Gareth / now have it
here and here it to her / And say that I recommaunde me unto her good grace /
and say her I will come when I may / and I pray her to be true and feythful
to me as I will be to her / Sir said the dwerf it shall be done as ye command /
and so he rode his way and did his eraund unto the lady / Then she said
where is my knight sir Gareth / Madame said the dwerf he bad me say / that he
would not be long from you / And so lyghtely the dwerf came again unto sir
Gareth that would full feign have had a lodgyng / for he had need to be reposed /
And then fell there a thonder and a rain as heaven and earth should goo to
gyder / And sir Gareth was not a lytyl weary / for of all that day he had but
little rest neither his horse nor he / So this sir Gareth rode so long in that
forest until the night came And ever it lyghtned and thondred as it had been
wood At the last by fortune he came to a Castle / and there he herd the waytes
upon the wallys

Then sir Gareth rode unto the barbycan of the castle / and praid the porter
fair to let him in to the castle / The porter ansuerd vngoodely again / and
said thou getest no lodgyng here / Fair sir say not so for I am a knyte of
king Arthurs / and pray the lord or the lady of this castle to give me
herberow for the love of king Arthur / Then the porter went unto the
duchess / and told her how there was a knight of king Arthurs would have
herberowe / let him in said the duchess / for I will see that knight / And
for king Arthurs sake he shall not be herberoules /

Then she yode up in to a toure over the gate with greet torche light / when
sir Gareth saw that torche light he cried on (...) thou be lord or lady
gyaunt or champyon I took no force so that I may have herberowe this night /
and if hit so he that I must needs fight / spare me not to morn when I have
restyd me for both I and mine horse ben weary / Sir knight said the lady thou
spekest knyghtly and boldly / but wete thou well the lord of this castle loves
not king Arthur / nor none of his court / for my lord has ever ben against him
and therefore thou were better not to come within this castle / For and thou come
in this night / thou must come in under such form that where someuer thou
mete my lord by sty or by street / thou must yield the to him as prisoner /
Madame said sire Gareth what is your lord and what is his name / sir my lords
name is the duke de la rouse / well madame said sir Gareth I shall promise you in
what place I mete your lord I shall yield me unto him and to his good grace
with that I understand he will do me no harm / And if I understand that ^e
will I will I releace my self and I can with my spear and my swerd / ye say well
said the duchess / and then she let the draw bridge down / and so he
rode in to the halle / and the^e he alyghte / and his horse was led in to a
stable / and in the halle he unarmed him / and said madame I will not out of
this holle this night / And when it is day light / let see / who will have

had many good dysshes / then sir Gareth list well to ete / and knyghtely he
ete his mete / and egerly / there was many a fair lady by him / and some said
they never saw a goodlyer man nor so well of etynge / then they made him
passing good chere / and shortly when he had souped his led was made there so
he rested him al night / And on the morn ^e herd mass and brake his fast and
took his leave at the duchess / and at them al / and thanked her goodely of her
lodgyng and of his good chere / and then she asked gym his name / Madame he
said truly my name is Gareth of Orkeney / and some men call me Be^umayns /
then knew she well it was the same knyt that fout for dame lyones / so sir
gareth departed and rode up in to a montayne / and there met him a knight /
his name was sir Bendelayne and said to sir Gareth thou shall not pass this
way / for outher thou shall Just with me or else be my prisoner / Thenme will

Gareth smote him thorou out the body / and sir Bendalyne rode forth to his
castle there beside and there dyed / So sir gareth would have rested him / and
he came riding to Bendalaynis castle / Then his knights and servants
aspyed that it was he that had slain their lord / Then they armed xx good
men and came out and assailled sir gareth / and so he had no spear but his
swerd / and put his shield before him / and there they brake their speres upon
him / and they assailled hem passyngly sore / But ever sir gareth deffended him
as a knight

Capitulum xxxiij
So when they saw that they might not overcome him / they rode from him /
and took their counceylle to slay his horse / and so they came in upon sir
gareth / and with speres they slew his horse / and then they assailled him
hard But when he was on foot / there was none that he caughte but he gaf him
such a buffet that he did never recover / So he slew hem by one and one till
they were but four / and there they fled / and sire gareth took a good horse
that was one of theirs and rode his way / Then he rode a great paas til that
he came to a castle and there he herd much morning of ladies and gentylwymmen
/ so there came by him a page / what noise is this said sir gareth that I here
within this castle / Sire knight said the page here ben within this castle
thyrtty ladies and all they be wydowes / For here is a knight that wayteth
daily upon this castle / and his name is the broun knight without pity / and
he is the parylloust knight that now lives / And therefore sir said the page I
read you flee / Nay said sir gareth I will not flee though thou be aferd of
him / And then the page saw where came the broune knight / loo said the
page yonder he comes / let me dele with him said sire gareth / And when
either of other had a syghte they let their horses run / and the broune
knight brake his spear and sir gareth smote him thorou out the body that he

and praid the ladies yt he myt repose him / allas said the ladies ye may not be
lodged here / make him good chere said the page for this knight has slain
your enemy / then they al made him good chere as lay in their power / But
wete ye well they maade him good chere for they might none otherwise do for
they were but pour / And so on the morn he went to mass / and there he saw
the thyrtty ladies knele / and lay grouelyng upon diverse tombs making great
dole and sorrow / Then sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their
lords / Fair ladies said sir Gareth ye must at the next feeste of Pentecost
be at the court of king Arthur / and say that I sir Gareth sent you thither /
we shall do this said the ladies So he departed / and by fortune he came to a
mountain / and there he found a goodely knight that badde him abide sir

A said the duke art thou that proud knight that proferest to fight with my

their horses run / and there sir Gareth smote the duke down from his horse /
But the duke lightly avoided his horse / and dressid his shield and drew his
swerd / and bad sir Gareth alyghte and fight with him / So he did alyghte /
and they did great batail to gyders more than an hour / and either hurt other
full sore / At the last sir Gareth gat the duke to the earth / and would have
slain him / and then he yielded him to him / Then must ye goo said sir
Gareth unto sir Arthur my lord at the next feast and say that I sir Gareth of

to do you seruyse wh^re ye will command me /

So the duke departed / and sir Gareth stood there alone and there he saw an
armed knight coming toward him / Then sire Gareth took the dukes shield / and
mounted upon horsbak / and so without bydyng they (...) to gyder as it had been the thonder / And there that knyt hu^t sir Gareth under the side with his
spear / And then they alyghte / and drew their swerdes / and gafe great
strokes that the blood trayled to the ground / And so they fought two hours
/ At the last there came the damoysel Lynet that sum men call the damoysel
saueage / and she came riding upon an ambelynge meule / and there she cried al
on high / sir Gawayne sir Gawayne leave thy fighting with thy brother sire
Gareth / And when he herd her say so he threw aweye his shield and his swerd
/ and ran to sire Gareth / and took him in his arms / and sythen kneled
down and asked him mercy / what are ye said sir Gareth that right now were so
strong and so mighty / and now so suddenly yield you to me O Gareth I am your
brother sir Gawayn that for your sake have had great sorou and labor / Then
sir Gareth unlaced his helm / and knelyd down to him / and asked him mercy /
then they rose both and enbraced either other in their arms and wept a
great while or they might speak / and either of hem gaf other the price of the
bataille / And there were many kind words bitwene hem / Allas my fair brother
said sir gawayn perde I owe of right to worship you / and ye were not my
brother / for ye have worshipped king Arthur and all his court / for ye have
sent me mo worshipful knights this twelve month than six the best of the
round table have done except sir Lancelot / Then came the damoysel saueage
that was the lady Lynet that rode with sir gareth so long / and there she did
staunche sir garethe wounds / and sir gawayns Now what will ye do said the
damoysel saueage / me seems that it were well do yt Arthur had wetyng of you
both for your horses are so brysed that they may not bear / Now fair damoysel
said sir Gawayne / I pray you ride unto my lord mine vnkel king Arthur / and
tell him what adventure is to me betyd here / and I suppose he will not tarry
long / Then she took her meule and lightly she came to king Arthur / that
was but two mile thens / And when she had told him ty^ynges the king bad get
him a palfroy / And when he was upon his bak he badde the lords and ladies
come after who that would / and there was sadelyng and brydelyng of queen's
horses and princes horses / and well was him that soonest might be ready / So
when the king came there as they were he saw sir Gawayn and sir Gareth sytte
upon a little hylle side / and then the king avoided his horse / And when he
came nyghe sire Gareth / he would have spoken but he might not / and therewith he
sanke down in a swoune for gladness / and so they starte unto their vnkyl /
and required him of his good grace to be of good comfort / wete ye well the
king made great joy and many a pyteous complaynte he made to sir Gareth / And
ever he wept as he had been a child / with that came his mother the queen of
Orkeney dame Morgause / And when she saw sir Gareth redely in the vysage she
might not weep but suddenly fell down in a swoune / and lay there a great
while like as she had been deed / And then sir Gareth recomforted his mother in
such wise that she recouerd and made good chere / Then the king commanded
that al manner of knights that were under his obeissaunce should make their
lodgyng right there for the love of his neuewes / And so it was done and al
manner of purueaunce purueyd that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of
tame nor wild for gold or silver / And then by the means of the damoysel
Saueage sir Gawayne and sir Gareth were heled of their wounds / and there they
soiourned eight days / Then said king Arthur unto the damoysel saueage I
merueylle that your sister Dame Lyones comes not here to me / and in especyal
that she comes not to vysyte her knight my neuewe sire Gareth that has had
so much trauaille for her love / My lord said the damoysel Lynet ye must of
your good grace hold her excused / For she knows not that my lord sir Gareth
is here / Go then for her said king Arthur that we may be appointed what is
best to done according to the plesyr of my neuewe / Sir said the damoysel that
shall be done / and so she rode unto her sister / And as lyghtely as she might
made her ready and she came on the morn with her brother sir Gryngamor / and with
her xl knytes / And so when she was come she had all the chere that might be
done both of the king and of many other kings and queen's

Capitulum xxxv
ANd ^monge all th^se ladies she was named she fairest and (...) / Then
when sir Gawayn saw her / there was many a goodely look and goodely words
that all man of worship had joy to behold them / Then came king Arthur and
many other kings and dame Gweneuer and the queen of Orbeney / And there the
king asked his neuew sir Gareth whether he would have that lady as peramour or
to have her to his wife / My lord wete you well that I love her above al ladies
living / Now fair lady said king Arthur what say ye / Most noble king said
dame Lyones wete you well that my lord sir Gareth is to me more lever to have
and welde as my husband than any king or prince that is (...) / and if I may
not have him I promise you I will never have none / For my lord Arthur said
dame Lyones we^e ye well he is my first love and he shall be the last / And if
ye will suffer him to have his will and free choice I da^^ say ^e will have me
/ That is truth said sir Gareth / And I have not you and weld not you as my
wife / there shall never lady ne gentylwoman rejoice me / What neuewe said the
king is the wind in that door / for wete ye well I would not for the stynte of
my croune to be causar to withdraw your hertes / And wete ye well ye con not
love so well but I shall rather encreace hit than dystresse hit / And also ye
shall have my love and my lordship in the vttermest wise that may lie in my
power / And in the same wise said sir Gareths mother / then there was made a
prouysyon for the day of maryge / and by the kings advise it was provided that
it should be at Mychelmas following at kynkenadon by the sea side / for there is a
plentyful country / And so it was cried in all the places through the wyamme /
And then sir Gareth sent his somones to all these knights and ladies that
he had wonnen in batail to fore that they should be at his day of marriage at
kynkenadon by the sandys / And then dame Lyones and the damoysel Lynet with
sir Gryngamor rode to their castle / and a goodely and a rich ring she gaf
to sir Gareth / and he gaf her another / And king Arthur gaf her a rich be of
gold / and so she departed / and king Arthur and his felauship rode toward
Kynkenadon / and sir Gareth brought his lady on the way / and so came to the
king again and rode with him / Lord the great chere that sir lancelot made of
sir Gareth and he of him / for there was never no knight that sir gareth ^oued
so well as he did sir Lancelot / and ever for the most party he would be in sir
launcelots company / for after sir Gareth had aspyed sir Gawayns condycions he
withdrewe him self fro his brother sir Gawayns felauship / for he was vengeable
/ and where he hated he would be auengyd with murder and that hated sir gareth

So hit drew fast to Mychelmas / and thither came dame Lyones the lady of the
castle peryllous and her sister dame Lynet with sire gryngamor her brother with

the deuyse of king Arthur / And upon mychelmas day the Bishop of Caunterbury
made the weddyng betwixe sir gareth and the lady Lyones with great solempnyte /
and king Arthur made gaherys to wedde the damoysel saueage / that was dame

take so simple on office / Then come in the reed knight with three score
knights With him / and did to sir Gareth homage and feaute / and all the
knights to hold of him for evermore / And then this sir Perymonyes praide
sir gareth to grant him to be his chyef botteler at that high feast I will
well said sir gareth that ye have this office and it were better / Then came
in sir Persant of Inde with an C knights with him / and there he did homage
and feaute / and al his knights should do him seruyse / and hold their lands
of him for ever / and there he prayed sir Gareth to make him his Sewar chyef at
the feast / I will well said sir Gareth that ye have it and it were better /
Then came the dukde larowse with an C knights with him / and there he did
homage and feaute to sir Gareth / and so to hold their lands of him for ever
/ And he required sir Gareth that he might serve him of the wyn that day at
that feast / I will well said sir Gareth and it were better / Then came in the
reed knyte of the reed laundes that was sir Ironsyde / and he brought with him
three honderd knights / and there he did homage and feaute / and al these
knights to hold their lands of him for ever / And then he asked sir Gareth

for the which king Arthur and all the court were sore displeased / And so
they held the court forty days with great solempnyte / And this sir Gareth
was a noble knight and a well ruled and fair langaged

Thus ends this tale of sir Gareth of Orkeney that wedded dame Lyones of the
castle peryllous / And also sir Gaherys wedded her sister dame Lynet / that was
called the damoysel saueage / And sir Agrauayne wedded dame Laurel a fair lady
and great and mighty lands with great richesse gaf with them king Arthur that
ryally they might live till their lives end
Here follows the viij book the which is the first book of sir Tristram de
Lyones / and who was his fader and his mother / and hou he was borne and
fosteryd / And how he was made knight
Capitulum primum
HIt was a king that hyghte Melyodas / and he was lord and king of the country
of Lyonas And this Melyodas was a lykely knight as any was that time living /
And by fortune he wedded king Markys sister of Cornewaille / And she was
called Elyzabeth that was called both good and fair And at that time king
Arthur reigned / and he was hol^ king of England / walys and Scotland and of
many other royammes how be it there were many kings that were lords of many
countries / but all they held their lands of king Arthur / for in walys were
two kings / and in the north were many kings / And in Cornewail and in the
west were two kings / Also in Irland were two or three kings and al were under
the obeissaunce of king Arthur / So was the king of France and the king of
Bretayn and all the lordshippes unto Rome / So when this king Melyodas had been with his wife / within a while she waxid great with child and she was a full
meke lady / and well she loved her lord / and he her again / so there was
great joy betwixe them / Then there was a lady in that country that had
loved king Melyodas long / And by no mean she never could get his love
therefore she let ordeyne upon a day as king Melyodas rode on hunting / for
he was a great chacer / and there by an enchauntement she made him chase an
heart by him self alone / til that he came to an old Castle / and there anon
he was taken prisoner by the lady that him loved / When Elyzabeth king
Melyodas mist her lord / and she was nyghe out of her wit and also as great
with child as she was she took a gentylwoman with her / and ran in to the
forest to seek her lord / And when she was far in the forest she might no
ferther for she byganne to trauaille fast of her child / And she had many
grymly throws / her gentylwoman halp her all that she might / And so by
miracle of our lady of heaven she was delyuerd with great pains / But she had
taken such cold for the defaute of help that deep draughtes of death took her
/ that needs she must dye and depart out of this world / there was none other
boot / And when this queen Elyzabeth saw that there was none other bote /
then she made great dole / and said unto her gentylwoman / when ye see my
lord king Melyodas recommaunde me unto him / and tell him what pains I endure
here for gis love / and how I must dye here for his sake for defaute of good
help / and let him wete that I am full sorry to depart out of this world fro
him / therefore pray him to be friend to my soul / Now let me see my little
child / for whom I have had all this sorrow / And when she saw him she
said thus / A my little sone thou have murdered thy mother / and therefore I
suppose thou that art a murderer so young / thou art full lykely to be a
manly man in thyn age / And by cause I shall dye of the birth of the / I charge
the gentylwoman / that thou pray my lord king Melyodas tha when he is crystned
let call him Trystram that is as much to say / as a sorouful birth / And
there with this queen gafe up the ghoost and dyed / Then the gentylwoman leyd
her under an vmbre of a great tree / and then she lapped the child as well as
she might for cold / Right so there came the Barons following after the queen
/ And when they saw that she was deed / and understood none other but the
king was destroyed /

Capitulum secundum
Then certain of them would have slain the child / by cause they would have been lords of the country of Lyonas / But then thorou the fair speech of
the gentylwoman / and by the means that she made / the most party of the
Barons would not assente there to / And then they let carry home the deed queen
/ and much dole was made for her / Then this mean while Merlyn delyuerd
king Melyodas out of prison on the morn after his queen was deed / And so
when the king was come home / the most party of the barons made great joy /
But the sorou that the king made for his queen that might no tongue tell

So then the king let entere her rychely / and after he let crystene his
child as his wife had commanded before her death / And then he let call him
Trystram the sorouful borne child / Then the king Melyodas endured seven
years without a wife / And all this time Trystram was nourysshed well / Then
hit befell^ that king Melyodas wedded king Howles daughter of Bretayne / and
anon she had children of king Melyodas / then was she heavy and wroth /
that her children should not rejoice the Country of Lyones / wherefore this queen
ordained for to poysone young Tristram / So she let poison be put in a pyece of
silver in the chamber where as Trystram and her children were to gyders / Unto
that entente that when Trystram were thursty he should drink that drink /
And so hit fell upon a day the queen's sone as he was in that chamber / aspyed
the pyece with poison / and he wend hit had been good drink / and by cause
the child was thursty he took the pyece with poison and drank freely / and
there with all suddenly the child brast and was deed / when the queen Melyodas
wist of the death of her sone wete ye well that she was heavy / But yet the king
understood no thing of her treason / Not withstanding the queen would not leave
this / but efte she let ordeyne more poison / and put hit in a pyece / And
by fortune king Melyodas her husband fond the pyece with wyn where was the
poison / and he that was much thursty took the pyece for to drink there out
And as he would have dronken thereof / the Queen aspyed him / and then she
ran unto him / and pulled the pyece from him suddenly The king merueilled why
she did so / and remembryd him how her sone was suddenly slain with poison /
And then he took her by the hand and said / thou falls traitresse thou shalt
tell me what manner of drink this is / or else I shall slay the / And there
with he pulled out his swerd / and swear a great oath that be should slay her /
but if she told him truth / A mercy my lord said she / and I shall tell you
all / And then she told him why she would have slain Trystram / by cause her
children should rejoice his land / well said king Melyodas / and therefore shall ye
have the law / And so she was dampened by the assente of the Barons to be
brent / and then was there made a great fire / and right as she was at the
fire to take her execucion / young Trystram knelyd before king Melyodas / and
besought him to give him a bone / I will well said the king again / Then
said young Trystram give me the life of thy queen my stepmoder / That is
vnryghtfully asked said king Melyodas / for thou ought of right to hate her /
for she would have slain the with that poison and she might have had her
will / And for thy sake most is my cause that she should dye Sir said
Trystram as for that I byseche you of your mercy that ye will forgive hither /
And as for my part god forgive it her and I do / and so much it lyked your
hyhenes to grant me my bone / for gods love I require you hold your promise
/ Sythen hit is so said the king I will that ye have her life / then said
the king I give her to you / and go ye to the fire and take her / and do with
her what ye will / So sire Trystram went to the fire / and by the
commandment of the king delyuerd her from the death / But after that king
Melyodas would never have adoo with her as at bed and board / But by the good
means of young Trystram he made the king and her accorded / But then the
king would not suffer young Trystram to abide no longer in his court

Capitulum iij
ANd then he let ordeyne a gentylman that was well learned and taught / his
name was gouernayle / and then he sent young Trystram with Gouernayle in to
France to learn the langage / and nurture / and deeds of arms / And there was
Trystram more than seven years / And then when he well couthe speak the
langage and had learned all that he might learn in that countries / then
he came home to his fader king Melyodas again / and so Trystram learned to be
an harper passing all other that there was none such called in no country /
and so in harpynge and on Instrumentys of musyke he applied him in his yongthe
for to learn / And after as he growed in might and strength he labored ever
in hunting and in haukynge so that never gentylman more that ever we herd
read of / And as the book says / he began good mesures of blowyng of beestes
of venery and beestes of chase / and all manner of vermayns / and all these
terms we have yet of haukyng and huntyng And therefore the book of venery / of
haukynge and hunting is called the book of sir Trystram / Wherefore as me seems
all gentylmen that beren old arms ought of right to honor sire Trystram
for the goodly terms that gentilmen have and use / and shall to the day of
dome / that there by in a manner all men of worship may disseuer a gentylman
fro a yoman / and from a yoman a vylayne / For he that gentyl is will draw
him unto gentil tatches / and to follow the custommes of noble gentylmen Thus
sir Trystram endured in Cornewaile until he was bygge / and strong / of the
age of xviij years / And then the king Melyodas had great joy of sir
Trystram / and so had the queen his wife / For ever after in her life by cause
sire Trystram saved her from the fire she did never hate him more after / but
loved him ever after / and gaf Trystram many great yeftes for every estate
loved him / where that he went

Capitulum quartum
Then it befelle that king Anguysshe of Irland / sent unto king Mark of
Cornewaile for his truage that Cornewaile had paid many wynters / And all
that time king Mark was behind of the truage for s^uen years / And king
Mark and his Barons gaf unto the messager of Irland these words and ansuere
that they would none pay / and bad the messagyer goo unto his King Anguysshe /
and tell him we will pay him no truage / but tell your lord / and he will
alweyes have truage of us of Cornewaile / bydde him send a trusty knight of
his land / that will fight for his right / and we shall find another for to
defend our right / with this ansuer the messagers departed in to Irland / And
when king Anguysh understood the ansuere of the messagers / he was wonderly
wroth And then he called unto him sir Marhaus the good knight that was nobly
preued / and a knight of the table round / And this Marhaus was brother unto
the queen of Irland / Then the king said thus / Fair brother sir Marhaus I
pray you goo in to Cornewaile for my sake and do bataille for our truage that
of right we ought to have / and what someuer ye spend ye shall have
suffyciently more than ye shall need / Sire said Marhaus wete ye well that I
shall not be both to do bataille in the right of you and your land with the
best knight of the table round / for I know them for the most party what ben
their deeds / and for to auaunce my deeds and to encreace my worship I will
right gladly goo unto this iourneye for our right.

So in all haste there was made purueaunce for sir marhaus / and he had al
thing that to him neded / and so he departed out of Irland / and arrived up
in Cornewaile even fast by the castle of Tyntagil / And when king Mark
understood that he was there arrived to fight for Irland / Then made king
mark great sorou when he understood that the good and noble knight sire
Marhaus was come / For they knew no knight that durst have adoo with him /
For at that time sire Marhaus was called one of the famosest and renoumed
knights of the world

And thus sire Marhaus abode in the sea / and every day he sent unto king
Mark for to pay the truage that was behind of seven year / outher else to
find a knight to fight with him for the truage / This manner of message sire
Marhaus sent daily unto king Mark / Then they of Cornewayle let make
cries in every place that what knight would fight for to save the truage of
Cornewaile he should be rewarded so that he should fare the better the term
of his ^yf / Then some of the Barons said to king Mark / and counceiled
him to send to the court of King Arthur for to se^^e ^yre Lancelot du lake
that was that time named for the merueilloust Knight of all the world /
Then there were sum other Barons that counceylled the King not to do so
and said that it was labor in vayn / by cause sir Marhaus was a knight of the
round table / there for any of hem will be loath to have adoo with other / but if
hit were any knight at his own request would fight dysguysed and unknown /
So the king and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any
knight of the round table / This mean while came the langage and the noise
unto king Meliodas hou that sire Marhaus abode bataille fast by Tyntagil /
And how king Mark couthe find no manner knight to fight for him / When young
Trystram herd of this / he was wroth and sore ashamed that there durst no
knight in Cornewaile have adoo with sir Marhaus of Irland /

Capitulum quintum
THere with all Trystram went unto his fader King Meliodas and asked him
counceil what was best to do for to recover Cornewaile from truage / For as me
seems said sir Tristram it were shame that sir Marhaus the queen's brother of
Irland should goo aweye onles that he were foughten with all As for that said
king Meliodas Wete you Well sone Tristram that sire Marhaus is called one of the
best knights of the World and knight of the table round / And therefore I
know no knight in this country that is able to match with him / Allas said
sire Tristram that I am not made knight / And if sir Marhaus should thus depart
in to Irland / god let me never have worship and I were made knight I should
match him / And sir said Trystram I pray you give me leave to ride to king
Mark / and so ye be not displeased / of king Mark^ will I be made Knight / I
will well said king Meliodas that ye be ruled as your courage will rule you

Then sir Trystram thanked his fader much / And then he made him ready to
ride in to Cornewaile / In the mean while there came a messager with letters
of love fro king Faramon of Fraunces daughter unto sire Trystram that were full
pyteous letters and in them were written many complayntes of love / but sire
Tristram had no Joy of her letters nor ^^gard unto her / Also she sent him a
little brachet that was ^assynge fair / But when the kings daughter understood
that sy^^ Trystram would not love her / as the book says / she dyed for sorou /
And then the same squire that brought the letter and the brachet came again
unto sir Trystram / as after ye shall here in the tale So this young sire
Trystram rode unto his eme king Mark of Cornewayle / And when he came there
/ he herd say that there would ne knight fight with sire Marhaus / Then yede
sir Tristram unto his eme and said / sire if ye will give me thordre of
knyghthode / I will do bataille with sir Marhaus / what are ye said the king
and from whens be ye comen / Sir said Trystram I come fro king Melyodas that
wedded your sister and a gentylman wete ye well I am

King Mark beheld sir Trystram and saw that he was but a young man of age /
but he was passyngly well maade and bygge / Fair sire said the king what is
your name and where were ye borne / Sire said he again / my name is Trystram
/ and in the countreye of Lyones was I borne / Ye say well said the king / and
if ye will do this battle I shall make you knight / Therefore I come to you
said sire Trystram and for none other cause

But then king Mark made him knight / And there with all anon as he had
made him knight he sent a message^ unto sire Marhaus with letters that said /
that he had fond a young knight ready for to take the bataile to the utter
mest / hit may well be said sire Marhaus / But tell king Mark I will not
fight with no knight but he be of blood royal / that is to say outher kings
sone outher queen's sone borne of a prince or pryncesse /

when King Mark understood that / he sent for sire Trystram de lyones and
told him what was the ansuer of sir Marhaus / Then said sire Trystram sythen
that he seyth s^o / let him wete that I am comen of fader side and mother side
of as noble blood as he is / For sire now shall ye know that I am king
Melyodas sone borne of your own sister dame Elyzabeth that dyed in the forest
in the birth of me / O Ihesu said king Mark ye are welcome fair neuewe to me
/ Then in all the haste the king let horse sir Tristram and arm him in
the best manner that might be had or gotten for gold or silver / And then
king Mark sent unto sir Marhaus / and did him to wete that a letter born man
than he was him self should fight with him / and his name is sir Trystram de
lyonas gotten of king Melyodas / and borne of king Marks sister / Then was
sir Marhaus glad and blythe that he should fight with such a gentylman / and
so by the assente of king Mark and of sir Marhaus they let ordeyne that they
should fight within an Island nyghe sir Marhaus ships / and so was sir
Trystram put in to a vessel both his horse and he and all that to him longed
both for his body and for his horse / Sire Trystram lacked nothing / And when
king Mark and his Barons of Cornewaile beheld how young sir Trystram departed
with such a caryage to fight for the right of Cornewaile / there was neither
man ne woman of worship but they wept to see and understand so young a
knight to Ieoparde him self for their right /

Capitulum sextum
So to shorten this tale when / sir Trystram was arrived within the Island / he
looked to the ferther side / and there he saw at an anchor six ships nyghe to
the land / and under the shadow of the ships upon the land / there houed the
noble knight sir Marhaus of Irland / Then sir Trystram commanded his
servant gouernail to bring his horse to the land and dress his harneis at al
manner of ryghtes / And then when he had so done / he mounted upon his horse
And when he was in his sadel well apparailled / and his shield dressid upon his
sholder / Trystram asked Gouernayle where is this knight that I shall have adoo
with all / Sire said Gouernaile / see ye him not / I wend ye had seen him
yonder he houeth under the vmbre of his ships on horsbak with his spear in
his hand and his sheld upon his sholder / That is truth said the noble knight
sire Trystram now I see him well ynou Then he commanded his servant
Gouernayle to goo to his vessaile again / and command me unto mine eme king
Mark / and pray him / if that I be slain in this bataille for to entere my
body as him seemed best / and as for me let him wete I will never yield me for
cowardyse / and if I be slain and flee not / then they have lost no truage
for me And if so be that I flee or yield me as recreau^t / bydde mine eme never
berye me in Christian beryels / And upon thy life said sir Trystram to Gouernayle
/ come thou not nyghe this Island till that thou see me ouercomen or slain / or
else that I win yonder knight / so either departed from other sore we pynge

Capitulum septimum
ANd then sir Marhaus auysed sir Trystram and said thus / young knight sir
Trystram what do thou here / me sore repents of thy courage / for wete thou
well I have been assayed / and the best knights of this land have been assayed of
my hand / And also I have matched with the best knights of the world / and
therefore by my counceille return again unto thy vessaile / And fair knight
and well preued knight said sire Trystram thou shall well wete I may not forsake
the in this quarrel / for I am for thy sake made knight And thou shall well wete
that I am a kings sone born and gotten upon a queen / and such promise I have
made at my neuews request and mine own sekyng that I shall fight with the
unto the vttermest / and deliver Cornewaile from the old truage / And also wete
thou well sir Marhaus / that this is the grettest cause that thou couragest me
to have adoo with the / For thou art called one of the most renoumed knyght^s
of the world / and by cause of that noise and fame / that thou have / thou
gyuest me courage to have adoo with the / for never yet was I preued with good
knight / And sythen I took the order of knyghthode this day / I am well pleasyd
that I may have adoo with so good a knight as thou art / And now wete thou
well sir Marhaus that I cast me to get worship on thy body / And if that I be
not preued / I trust to god that I shall be worshipfully preued upon thy body /
and to deliver the country of Cornewaile for ever fro al manner of truage from
Irland for ever / when sir Marhau^ had herd him say what he would / he said
then thus ageyn Fair Knight sy^hen it is so that thou castest to win
worship of me / I let the wete / worship may thou none lose by me if thou
may stand me three strokes / for I let the wete / for my noble deeds preued
and seen / King Arthur made me knight of the table round / Then they began
to feutre their speres / and they met so fyersly to gyders / that they
smote either other down / both horse and all / But sir Marhaus smote sir
Trystram a great wound in the side with his spear / and then they avoided
their horses / and pulled out their swerdes / and threw their sheldes before
them / And then they lasshed to gyders as men that were wyld and couragyous /
And when they had stryken so to gyder long / then they left her strokes
/ and foyned at their brethes and vysours / and when they saw that that might
not prevail them / then they hurt led to gyders like rams to bear either
other down / thus they fought stylle more than half a day / and eyder were
wounded passing sore / that the blood ran down fresshly fro them upon the
ground / By then sir Trystram waxed more fressher / than sir Marhaus and
better wynded and bygger / and with a mighty stroke he smote sir Marhaus upon
the helm such a buffet that hit went thorou his helm / and thorou the coyfe
of stele and thorou the brayn pan / and the swerd stak so fast in the helm
and in his brayn pan that sir Trystram pulled thryes at his swerd or ever he
might pulle it out from his head / and there Marhaus fell down on his knees
the edge of Tristrams swerd left in his brain pan / And suddenly sir Marhaus
rose grouelynge / and threw his swerd and his shield from him / and so ran
to his ships and fled his way / and sir tristram had ever his shield and
his swerd / And when sir Tristram saw sir Marhaus withdraw him / he said A
sir knight of the round table why withdrawest thou the / thou do thy self
and thy kyn great shame / for I am but a young Knight / or now I was never
preued / and rather than I should withdraw me from the / I had rather be hewn
in C pyeces / Sir marhaus ansuerd no word but yede his way sore gronynge /
well sir knight said sir Tristram I promy^e the thy suerd and thy sheld shall be
mine / and thy sheld shall I were in all places where I ride on mine adventures
and in the syghte of king Arthur and all the round table

Capitulum viij
ANon sir Marhaus and his felauship departed in to Irland / And as soon as he
came to the king his brother / be let search his wounds / And when his head
was serched / a pyece of sire Trystrams swerd was founden therein / and might
never be had out of his head for no surgeons / and so he dyed of sir
Trystrams swerd / and that pyece of the swerd the queen his sister kept hit
for ever with her / for she thought to be reuengyd and she might / Now torn
we again unto sir Trystram that was sore wounded / and full sore bled that he
myt not within a little while when he had take cold uneath stere him of his
lymmes / And then he set him down softely upon a little hylle / and bledde
fast / Then anon came Gouernaile his man with his vessel And the king and
his barons came with procession against him / And when he was come unto the
land / King Mark took him in his arms / and the king and sir Dynas the
senescal ladde sir Tristram in to the castle of Tyntygail / And then was he
serched in the best manner / and leid in his bed / And when king Mark saw
his wounds / he wept hertely and so did all his lords / So god me help
said king Mark I would not for all my lands that my neuewe dyed / So sir
Trystram lay there a month and more / and ever he was like to deye of that
stroke that sir Marhaus smote him first with the spear / For as the Frensshe
book says / the speres head was enuenymed that sir Trystram might not be hole
/ Then was king Mark and all his barons passing heavy / For they demed none
other / but that sir Trystram should not recover / Then the king let send
after all manner of leches and surgens both unto men and wymmen / and there
was none / that would behote him the life / Then came there a lady that was a
right wise lady / and she said plainly unto king mark and to sir Trystram and
to all his barons that he should never be hole / but if sire Trystram went in
the same country that the venym came fro / and in that country should he be
ho^pe^ or else never / Thus said the lady unto the King / when king Mark
understood that / he let purueye for sir Trystram a fair vessel / well
vytailled / and therein was put sir Trystram and gouernail with him / and sir
Tristram took his harp with him / and so he was put in to the sea to sail
in to Irland / and so by good fortune he arrived up in Irland even fast by a
castle where the King and the queen was / and at his arryuayl he sat and
harped in his bed a merry lay such one herd they never none in Irland before
that time / And when it was told the King and the queen of such a Knight that
was such an harper / anon the King sent for him / and let search his
wounds / and then asked him his name / then he ansuerd I am of the
country of Lyonas / and my name is Tramtryst that thus was wounded in a
bataille as I fought for a ladies right / So god me help said king Anguysshe ye
shall have all the help in this land that ye may have here / But I let you wete
in Cornewaile I had a great loss / as ever had king / for there I lost the
best knight of the world / his name was Marhaus a full noble knight and Knight
of the table round / and there he told sir Trystra^ wherefore sir Marhaus was
slain / Sir Trystram made sem blaunt as he had been sorry / and better knew he
how hit was than the king

Capitulum ix
Then the king for great favor maade Tramtryst to be put in his daughters
ward and keeping by cause she was a noble surgeon / And when she had serched him
/ she fond in the bottom of his wound that therein was poison / and so she
heled him within a while / and therefore Tramtrist cast great love to la beals
Isoud / for she was at that time the fairest maid and lady of the world / And
there Tramtryst learned her to harp / and she began to have a great fantasye
unto him / And at that time sir Palamydes the sarasyn Was in that country and
Well cherysshed With the king and the queen / And every day sir Palamydes drew
unto la beale Isoud / and proffered her many yeftes / for he loved her passyngly
well / All that Aspyed Tramtryst / and full well knew he sir Palamydes for a noble
knight and a mighty man / And wete ye well sir Tramtryst had great despyte at
sir palomydes / for la beale Isoud told Tramtryst that Palamydes was in will
to be crystened for her sake / Thus was there great envy betwixe Tramtryst and
sir Palamydes / Then hit befelle that king Anguysshe let cry a great
Iustes and a great turnement for a lady that was called the lady of the laundes
/ and she was nyghe cosyn unto the king / And what man wanne her / three days
after he should wedde her and have all her lands / This cry Was made in
England / walys Scotland and also in France and in Bretayne / It befelle upon
a day la beale Isoud came unto sir Tramtryst and told him of this turnement /
he ansuerd and said fair lady I am but a feeble knight / and but late I had been
deed / had not your good ladyship ben / Now fair lady what would ye I should do
in this matere / well ye wot my lady that I may not Just / A Tramtryst said
la beale Isoud why will ye not have ado at that turnement / well I wot sir
Palamydes shall be there / and to do what he may / And therefore Tramtryst I
pray you for to be there / for else sir Palamydes is like to win the degree /
Madame said Tramtrist as for that / it may be so / for he is a proved knight /
and I am but a young knight and late made / and the first batail that I did it
myshapped me to be sore wounded as ye see / But and I wist ye would be my better
lady / at that turnement I will be so that ye will keep my counceille and let
no creature have knouleche that I shall Just but your self / and such as ye
will to keep your counceil / my pour person shall I Ieoparde there for your
sake that perauentur sir Palamydes shall know when that I come / Thereto said la
beale Isoud do your best and as I can said la beale Isoud I shall purueye horse
and armor for you at my deuyse / as ye will so be hit said sir Tra^trist I
will be at your commandment / So at the day of Iustes / there came sir
Palamydes with a black sheld / and he overthrew many knights that all the
people had merueylle of him / For he put to the werse sir Gawayne / Gaherys /
Agrauayn Bagdemagus / kay / Dodyus le saueage / Sagramo^ le desyrus / Gumret le
petyte / and Gryflet le fyse de dieu / All these the first day sir Palamydes
struck down to the earth / And then all manner of knights were adred of sir
Palamydes and many called him the knight with the black sheld^ / So that day
sire Palamydes had great worship / Then came king Anguysshe unto Tramtryst /
and asked him why he would not Just / Sir he said I was but late hurt / and as
yet I dare not adventure me / Then came there the same squire that was sent
from the kings daughter of France / unto sir Trystram / And when he had
aspyed sire Iristra^ he fell flat to his feet / All that aspyed la Bele
Isoud / what curtosye the squire made unto sir Trystram / And therewith al
suddenly sir Trystram ran unto his squire whose name was Hebes le renoumes /
and praid him hertely in no wise to tell his name / Sir said Hebes I will
not discover your name / but if ye command me

Capitulum x
Then sir Trystram asked him what he did in those countries / sir he said /
I came hyder with sir Gawayn for to be made knight / And if it please you of
your hands that I may be made knight / Awaite upon me as to morn secretly /
and in the feld I shall make you a knight / Then had la beale Isoud great
suspecyon unto Tramtryst that he was sum man of worship proved / and there
with she comforted her self / and cast more love unto him than she had done
tofore And so on the morn sir Palamydes maade him ready to come in to the feld
as he did the first day / And there he smote down the king with the C
knights and the king of Scotts / Then had la beale Isoud ordained and well
arrayed sir Trystram in white horse and harneis / And right so she let put
him out at a preuy posterne / and so he came in to the feld as it had been a
bright angel / And anon sir Palamydes aspyed him / and there with he feutrid a
spear unto sir Tramtrist / and he again unto him / And there sir Trystram
smote down sir Palamydes unto the earth And then there was a great noise of
people / some said / sire Palamydes had a fall / some said the knight with
the blak shield had a fall / And wete you well la beale Isoud was passing
glad / And then sire Gawayne and his felawes ix had merueille what knight
it might be that had smyten down sir Palamydes / Then would there none Just
with Tramtryst / but all that there were forsook him / most and lest / Then
sir Trystram made Hebes a knight / and caused him to put him self forth / and
did right well that day / So after sir Hebes held him with sir Trystram / And
when sire Palamydes had received this fall / wete ye well that he was sore
ashamed / And as pryuely as he might / he Withdrewe him out of the feld / All
that aspyed sire Trystram / and lightly he rode after sire Palamydes and
ouertoke him / and badde him torn / for better he would assaye him / or ever he
departed Then sir Palamydes turned him and either lasshed at other with their
swerdes / But at the first stroke sire Trystram smote down Palamydes / and
gaf him such a stroke upon the head that he fell to the earth / So then
Tristram badde yield him / and do his commandment or else he would slay him /
when sire Palamydes beheld his countenance / he dredde his buffets so / that
he granted al his as kings / Well said / said sir Tristram / this shall be
your charge / First upon pain of your life that ye forsake my lady la beale
Isoud / and in no manner wise that ye draw not to her / Also this twelve month
and a day / that ye bear none armor nor none harneis of werre / Now promise me
this or here shall thou dye / Allas said Palamydes for ever I am ashamed /
Then he swear as sir Trystram had commanded him / Then for despyte and
anger / sire Palamydes cut of his harneis / and threw them aweye / And so
sir Trystram turned again to the Castle where was la beale Isoud / and by the
weye he met with a damoysel that asked after sire lancelot that wanne the
dolorous guard Worshipfully / and this damoysel asked sire Tristram What he Was
/ For it Was told her that it Was he that smote down sir Palamydes / by Whom
the x knights of king Arthurs Were smyten down / Then the damoysel prayed
sir Trystram to tell her what h^ was / And whether that he were sir Lancelot
du lake / for she demyd that there was no knight in the world might do such
deeds of arms / but if it were Lancelot / Fair damoysel said sir Trystram
wete ye well that I am not sir lancelot for I was never of such prowess / but
in god is all that he may make me as good a knight as the good knight sir
lau^celot / Now gentyl knight said she / put up thy vysure / and when she
beheld his vysage / she thout she saw never a better ma^s vysage / nor a
better farynge knight / And then when the damoysel knew certainly that he
was not sire lancelot / then she took her leave and departed from him / And
then sire Trystram rode pryuely unto the posterne where kept him la beale
Isoud / and there she made him good chere and thanked god of his good speed /
So anon within a while the king and the queen understood that hit was
Tramtryst that smote down sire Palamydes / then was he much made of more
than he was before

Capitulum xj
THus was sir Tramtryst long there well cherysshed / with the king and the
queen / and namely with labeale Isoud / So upon a day / the queen and la beale
Isoud made a bayne for sire Tramtryst / And when he was in his bayne / the
queen and Isoud her daughter romed up and down in the chamber / and there
whiles Gouernail and Hebes attendyd upon Tramtryst / and the queen beheld his
swerd there as it lay upon his bed / And then by unhap the queen drew
out his swerd / and beheld it a long while / and both they thought it a
passing fair swerd / but within a foot and an half of the point there was a
great pyece there of out broken of the edge / And when the queen aspyed that
gap in the swerd / she remembryd her of a pyece of a swerd / that was found in
the brain pan of sire Marhaus the good knight that was her brother / Allas
then said she unto her daughter la beale Isoud / this is the same traitor
knight that slew my brother thyn eme / When Isoud herd her say so / she
was passing sore abashed / for passing well she loved Tramtryst / and full well
she knew the cruelnes of her mother the queen / Anon there with all the queen
went* unto her own chamber / and sought her cofre / and there she took out
the pyece of the swerd that was pulled out of sir Marhaus head after that he
was deed / / And then she ran with that pyece of iron to the swerd that
lay upon the bed / And when she put that pyece of stele and iron unto
the swerd / hit was as mete as it might be / when it was new broken / And
then the queen gryped that swerd in her hand fyersly / and with all her
might she ran streyghte upon Tramtryst where he sat in his bayne / And there
she had ryued him thorou had not sir Hebes gotten her in his arms / and
pulled the suerd from her / and else she had threst him thorou / Then when
she was lettyd of her evil will / she ran to the king Anguyssh her husband
and said on her knees / O my lord here have ye in your house that traitor
knight that slew my brother and your servant that noble knight sir Marhaus /
who is that said king Anguysshe and where is he / Sir she said hit is sir
Tramtryst the same knight that my daughter helyd Allas said the king therefore
am I right heavy / for he is a full noble knight as ever I saw in field / But I
charge you said the king to the queen that ye have not ado with that knight /
but let me dele with him / Then the king went in to the chamber unto sir
Tramtryst / and then was he gone unto his chamber / and the king fond him al
ready armed to mount upon his horse / when the king saw him al ready armed to
goo unto horsbak / the king said nay Tramtryst hit will not avail to compare
the against me / But thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy love in
so much as thou art within my court / hit were no worship for me to slay the

court in saufte / so thou will tell me who was thy fader / and what is thy

Capitulum xij
Sir said Trystram now I shall tell you all the truth / my faders name is
sir Melyodas king of Lyonas / and my mother hit Elyzabeth that was sister unto
king Mark of Cornewaile / and my mother dyed of me in the foreste / And by
cause thereof she commanded or she dyed that when I were crystened / they should
crystene me Trystram / and by cause I would not be known in this country I
turned my name and let me call Tramtryst / and for the truage of Cornewayle I
fought for mine emes sake / and for the right of Cornewaile that ye had posseded
many years / And wete ye well said Trystram unto the king I did the bataille
for the love of mine vnkel king Mark / and for the love of the countreye of
Cornewaile / and for to encreace mine honor / For that same day that I fought
with sir Marhaus I was made knyt And never or than did I no bataile with no
knight / and from he went alive and left his sheld and his suerd behind / so
god me help said the king I may not say but ye did as a knight should / and it
was your part to do for your quarrel / and to encreace your worship as a knight
should / how be it I may not mayntene you in this country with my worship onles
that I should displease my barons and my wife / and her kyn / Sir said Trystram I
thank you of your good lordship that I have had with you here / and the great
goodenes my lady your daughter has showed me / and therefore said sir Tristram
it may so happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death / for in
the parties of England it may happen I may do you scruyse at some season that
ye shall be glad that ever ye showed me your good lordship / With more I promise
you as I am true knyt that in all places I shall be my lady your douters
servant / and knyt in right and in wrong / and I shall never fail her to do
as much as a knight may do

Also I byseche your good grace that I may take my leave at my lady your
daughter and at all the Barons and knights / I will well said the king /
Then sire Tristram went unto la beale Isoud / and took his leave of her /
And then he told her all what he was and how he had changed his name by
cause he would not be known / and hou a lady told him he yt should never be hole
till he came in to this country where the poison was made / where thorou I was

promise you there ageynste that I shall not be married this seven years but by
your assent / and to whom that ye will I shall be married to / him will I

leuynge her / making great dole and lamentacion / and he streyghte went unto
the Court among all the Barons / and there he took his leave at most and
leest / and openly he said among them all / Fair lords now it is so that I
must depart / If there be any man here that I have offended unto / or that
any man be with me grieved / let complain him here before me or that ever I

stylle / there was not one that would say one word / yet were there some
knights that were of the queen's blood and of sire Marbaus blood / but they
would not meddle with him /

So sir Tristram departed and took the sea / and with good wind he arrived up
at Tyntagyl in Cornewaile / and when king Mark was hole in his prosperity there
came tidings that sir Tristram was arrived and hole of his wounds / thereof was
king mark passing glad / and so were all the barons / and when he saw his
time he rode unto his fader king melyodas / and there he had all the chere that
the king and the queen could make him / And then largely King Melyodas and
his queen departed of their lands and goods to sire Trystram / Then by the
license of King Melyodas his fader he returned again unto the court of king
Mark / and there he lived in great joy long time / until at the last there
befelle a Ialousye and an unkindness betwyxe king Mark and sir Tristram / for
they loved both one lady / And she was an earls wife that hight sire Segwarydes
/ And this lady loved sire Trystram passyngly well / And he loved her again for
she was a passing fair lady / And that aspyed sir Tristram well / Then king
Mark understood that and was Ialous / for king Mark loved her passyngly well /
So it fell upon a day / this lady sent a dwerf unto sir Tristram and badde
him as he loved her / that he would be with her the nyt next following / Also
she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye be well armed / for her lord
was called a good knight Sire Trystram answered to the dwerf / recommaunde me
unto my lady / and tell her I will not fail but I will be with her the
term that she has set me / and with this ansuer the dwerf departed / And
king Mark aspyed that the dwerfe was with sire Trystram upon message from
Segwarydes wife / then king Mark sent for the dwerfe / And when he was
comen / he maade the dwerf by force to tell him all why and wherefore that he
came on message from sire Tristram

Now said king Mark goo where thou wolt / and upon pain of death that thou
say no word that thou spakest with me / so the dwerf departed from the king
/ And that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarydes wife and
sir Trystram king Mark armed him / and made him ready and took two knights of
his counceylle with him / and so he rode before for to abide by the way / for
to awayte upon sir Trystram / And as sire Trystram came riding upon his way
with his spear in his hand / king Mark came hurtlynge upon him with his two
knights suddenly / And all three smote him with their speres / and king Mark
hurt sire Trystram on the breast right sore / And then sire Tristram feutryd
his spear / and smote his vnkel king Mark so sore that he rasshyd him to the
earth / and brysed him that he lay stylle in a swoune / and long hit was or
ever he might welde him self / And then he ran to the one knight / and

And there with all sir Tristram rode forth sore wounded to the lady / and

Capitulum xiiij
ANd there she welcomed him fair / and either halsed other in arms / and so
she let put up his horse in the best wise / and then she unarmed him / And
so they soup^d lyghtely and went to bed with great joy and plesaunce / and
so in his ragyng he took no keep of his grene wound that king Mark had given
him / And so sir Tristram bebled both the over shete and the nether and
pelowes / and head shete / and within a while there came one before that warned
her that her lord was nere hand within a bow draughte So she made sir
Trystram to arise / and so he armed him / and took his horse and so departed /
By then was come segwarydes her lord / and when he fond her bed troubled

there had layne a wounded knight / A falls traitresse then he said / why have
thou bitrayed me / and there with all he swange out a swerd and said / but if
thou tell me who has been here / here thou shall dye / A my lord mercy said
the lady / and held up her hands / saying / slay me not / and I shall tell
you all who has been here / Tell anon said segwarydes to me all the truth
/ Anon for dread she said here was sir Trystram with me / and by the way as
he came to me ward / he was sore wounded / A falls traitresse said segwarides
where is he become / sir she said he is armed and departed on ho^e bak not yet
hens half a mile / ye say well said segwarydes then he armed him lightly /
and gate his horse and rode after sire Tristram that rode straight way unto

Sire knight said sire Trystram I counceyle you that ye smite no more how be it
for the wrongs that I have done you / I will forbere you as long as I may /
Nay said Segwarides that shall not be / for outher thou shall dye or I /
Then sire Tristram drew out his swerd and hurtled his horse unto him fyersly
/ and thorou the waste of the body he smote sire Segwarides that he fell to
the earth in a swoune / And so sire Tristram departed and left him there And
so he rode unto Tyntagil and took his lodging secretly for he would not be

Also sir Segwarides men rode after their master / whom they fond lyenge in

not be aknowen of that sir Tristram and he had met that night / And as for
sire Trystram he knew not that king Mark had met with him / And so the
kings astau^ce came to sir Tristram to comfort him as he lay seek in his
bed / But as long as king Mark lived / he loved never sire Trystram after
that / though there was fair speech / love was there none / And thus it past
many wekes and days / and all was forgyuen and forgoten / For sire Segwarydes
durst not have ado with sir Tristram by cause of his noble prowess And also
by cause he was neuewe unto king Mark / therefore he let it over slyp / for
he that has a pryuy hurt is loath to have a shame outward

that she was awey / then were there certain ladies that knew that there was
great love bitwene sir Tristram and her / and also that lady loved sir Tristram
above all other knights / Then there was one lady that rebuked sir Tristram
in the horryblest wise / and called him coward knight / that he would for shame
of his knyghthode see a lady so shamefully be taken aweye / fro his vnkels

/ sir Lancelot is called pierles of curtosy and of knyghthode / and for his
sake said sir Trystram I will not with my good will fight no more with you
for the great love I have to sir Lancelot du lake / In good feith said
Bleoberys / as for me / I will be loathe to fight with you / But sythen ye
follow me here to have this lady / I shall profer you kyndenys curtosy and
gentilnes right here upon this ground / This lady shall be betwixe us both /
and to whom that she will go / let him have her in pees / I will well said
Tristra^ For as I deem she will leave you / and come to me / ye shall preue
hit anon said Bleoberys

Capitulum xviij
So when she was set betwixe them both / she said these words unto sir
Tristram / wete ye well sir Tristram de lyones that but late thou was the man in
the world that I most loved and trusted / And I wend thou had loved me
again above all ladies / But when thou saw this knight led me awey thou
made no chere to rescowe me / but suffered my lord Segwarydes ride after me /
but un till that time I wend thou had loved me / And therefore now I will
leave the / and never love the more / and there with all she went unto sir
Bleoberys / when sir Tristram saw her do so / he was wonderly wroth with
that lady and ashamed to come to the court / sir Tristram said sir Bleoberys
ye are in the defaute / for I here by those ladies words / she before this day
trusted you above all erthely knights / and as she says ye have deceived her
/ therefore wete ye well / there may no man hold that will aweye / and rather
than ye should be hertely displeased with me / I would ye had her / and she would
abide with you / Nay said the lady / so god me help I will never goo with him /
For he that I loved most / I wend he had loved me / And therefore sire Trystram
she said ride as thou came / for though thou had overcome this knyt as ye
was lykely / with the never would I have gone / And I shall pray this knight
so fair of his knyghthode that or ever he pass this country / that he will
led me to the Abbeye / there my lord sir Segwarydes lies So god me help
said Bleoberis I let you wete good knight sire Trystram by cause king Mark
gaf me the choice of a yefte in this court / and so this lady lyked me best /
Not withstanding she is wedded and has a lord / and I have fulfilled my quest
/ she shall be sent unto her husband again / And in especyal most for your
sake sir Trystram / And if she would goo with you / I would ye had her / I thank
you said sir Trystram / but for her love I shall beware what manner a lady I
shall love or trust / For had her lord sir Segwarydes ben away from the
court I should have been the first that should have followed you / but sythen ye
have refused me / as I am true knight I shall her know passyngly well that I
shall love or trust / and so they took their leave one fro the other and departed
/ And so sir tristram rode unto Tyntagyl / and sir Bleoberys rode unto the
abbay where sir segwarydes lay sore wounded / and there he delyuerd his lady /
and departed as a noble knight / and when sir segwarydes saw his lady / he was
gretely comforted / and then she told him that sir Trystram had done great
bataill with sire Bleoberys / and caused him to bring her again / These
words pleasyd sir segwarydes right well that sir tristram would do so much /
and so that lady told all the bataill unto king Mark betwixe sir Trystram
and sir Bleoberys

Capitulum xix
Then when this was done / king Mark cast alweyes in his heart how he might
destroy sir Tristram And then he ymagyned in him self to send sir tristram
in to Irland for la beale Isoud / For sir Trystram had so preysed her beauty
and her goodness that king Mark said he would wedde her / where upon he praid
sir Trystram to take his wey in to Irland for him on message / And all this was
done to the entente to slay sir Tristram / Not withstanding sir Trystram would
not reffuse the message for no danger nor peril that might fall for the
pleasyr of his vnkel / but to goo he made him ready in the most goodlyest wise
that might be devised / For sir Tristram took with him the most goodlyest
knights that he might find in the court / and they were arrayed after the
gyse that was then used in the goodlyest manner / So sir Tristram departed and
took the sea with all his felauship / And anon as he was in the broad see / a
tempest took him and his felauship and drofe them bak in to the cost of
England / And there they arrived fast by Camelot / and full feign they were to
take the land / And when they were landed sir Tristram set up his pauelione
upon the land of Camelot / and there he let hang his shield upon the
pauelione / And that same day came two knights of king Arthurs / that one was
sir Ector de marys and sir Morganor And they touched the shield / and badde him
come out of the pauelione for to Just and he would Just / ye shall be ansuerd
said sir Tristram and ye will tarry a little while / So he made him ready / and
first he smote down sir Ector de marys / and after he smote down sir
Morganor all with one spear / and sore brysed them / And when they lay upon
the earth / they asked sir Tristram what he was / and of what country he was
knight / Fair lords said sir Tristram wete ye well that I am of Cornewaile /
Allas said sire Ector now am I ashamed / that ever any Cornysshe knight should
overcome me / And then for despyte sire Ector put of his armor fro him / and
went on foot and would not ride

Capitulum xx
Then it fell that sire Bleoberys and sire Blamore de ganys that were
brethren they had assomoned the king Anguysshe of Irland for to come to
Arthurs Court upon pain of forfeture of king Arthurs good grace And if the
king of Irland came not in at the day assigned and set / the king should
lose his lands / So by hit happend that at the day assigned king Arthur
neither sire Lancelot might not be there for to give the Judgment / for king
Arthur was with sir lancelot at the castle joyous guard / And so king Arthur
assigned king Carados and the king of scotts to be there that day as Iuges /
So when the kings were at Camelot / king Anguysshe of Irland was come to
know his accusars / Then was there Blamore de ganys and appeled the king of
Irland of treason / that he had slain a cosyn of his in his court in Irland
by treason / The king was sore abashed of his accusacion / for why / he was
come at the somons of king Arthur / And or that he come at Camelot / he wist
not wherefore he was sent after / And when the king herd sir Blamor say his
will / he understood well there was none other remedy but to ansuere him
knyghtly / for the custom was such in tho days / that and any man were
appealed of any treason or murder / he should fight body for body / or else to
find another knight for him / And all manner of Murderers in tho days were
callid treason / So when king Anguysshe understood his accusynge / he was
passing heavy / for he knew sir Blamor de ganys that he was a noble knight /
and of noble knights comen / Then the king of Irland was symply purueyed of
his ansuere / therefore the Iuges gaf him respyte by the thyrdde day to give
his ansuere / So the king departed unto his lodging / the mean while there
came a lady by sir Trystrams pauelione making great dole / what eyleth you said
sir Tristram that ye make such dole / A fair knight said the lady I am
ashamed onles that some good knight help me / for a great lady of worship sent
by me a fair child and a rich unto sir lancelot du lake / and here by there
met with me a knight and threw me down fro my palfray ^ and took aweye the
child from me / well my lady said sir Tristram / and for my lord sir Launcelots
sake I shall get you that child again / or else I shall be beten for hit /
And so sire Tristram took his horse / and asked the lady which wey the knight
rode / And then she told him And he rode after him / and within a while he
ouertoke that knight / And then sir Tristram badde him corn and give again
the child

Capitulum xxj
THe knight turned his horse / and he made him ready to fight / And then sir
Trystram smote him with a swerd such a buffet / that he tombled to the earth /
And then he yielded him unto sir Tristram / then come thy way said sire
Trystram and bring the child to the lady again / So he took his horse wekely
and rode with sir Trystram / and then by the way sir Trystram asked him his
name / Then he said my name is Breunis saunte pity / So when he had
delyuerd that child to the lady / he said / sir as in this the child is well
remedyed / Then sir Trystram let him goo again that sore reyentyd him after
/ for he was a great ^oo unto many good knights of king arthurs court /
Then when sir Tristram was in his pauelione / Gouernaile his man came / and
told him how that king anguysshe of Irland was come thither / and he was put
in great distress / and there gouernaile told sir Trystram / how king
anguysshe was somoned and appealed of murder / So god me help said sir
Tristram these ben the best tidings that ever came to me this vij year / for
now shall the king of Irland have need of my help for I dare say there is
no knight in this country that is not of arthurs court dare do bataille with
sire Blamore de ganys / and for to win the love of the king of Irland I will
take the batail upon me / and therefore gouernaile bring me I charge the to the
king / Then Gouernaile went unto king anguysshe of Irland and sal wed him
fair / the king welcomed him / and asked him what he would / Sir said
Gouernaile / here is a knight nere hand that desires to speak with you / he
badde me say he would do you seruyse / what Knight is he said the King /
sir he said hit is sir Tristram du ^yonas that for your good grace ye showed
him in your lands will reward you in these countries / Come on felawe said
the king with me anon / and show me unto sir Trystram / so the King took a
little hackney and but few felauship with him until he came unto sir Trystrams
pauelione / and when sire Trystram saw the King / he ran unto him and
would have holden his styrope / But the king lepte from his horse lightly / and
either hal^ed other in arms / my gracious Lord said sire Trystram gramercy of
your great goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands / And at that
time I promised you to do my seruyse / and ever it lay in my power / and
gentyl knight said the king unto sir Tristram / now have I great need of you /
never had I so great need of no knights help / How so my good lord said
sire Trystram / I shall tell you said the king I am assomoned and appeled
fro my country for the death of a knight that was kyn unto the good knight sir
Lancelot / wherefore sir Blamor de ganys brother to sir Bleoberys has appeled me
to fight with him / outher to find a knight in my stead / And well I wot said
the king these that are come of king Bans blood as sir Lancelot and these
other are passing good knights and hard ^ men for to win in bataille as any
that I know now living / Sire said sir Trystram / for the good lordship ye
showed me in Irland and for my lady your daughters sake / La Beale Isoud I
will take the bataille for you upon this condycyon / that ye shall grant me
two things / that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right
that ye were never consenting to the knytes death / Sir then said sir
Tristram when that I have done this bataille if god give me grace that I speed
that ye shall give me a reward what thing reasonable that I will ask of you
/ So god me help said the king ye shall have what someuer ye will ask / It is
well said / said sir Trystram

Capitulum xxij
NOw make your ansuer that your Champyon is ready For I shall dye in your
quarrel rather than to be r^^r^aunt / I have no doubt of you said the king /
that and ye should have adoo with sir Lancelot du lake / Sir said sir Tristram
as for sire Lancelot he is called the noblest knight of the world / And wete
ye well that the knights of his blood are noble men and dread shame / And as
for Bleoberys brother to sir Blamor I have done bataille with him / therefore
upon my head / it is no shame to call him a good knight / It is noysed said
the king / that Blamor is the hardyer knight / ^ire as for that let him be /
he shall never be refused / and as he were the best knight that now bears
shield or spear / So king Anguysshe departed unto king Carados / and the
kings that were that time as Iuges / and told hem that he had fond his
champyon ready / Then by the commandments of the kings sir Blamor de ganys
and sire Tristram were sent for to here the charge / And when they were come
beforne the Iuges / there were many kings and knights biheld sire Tristram /
and much speech they had of him by cause he slew sir M^^haus the good knight
/ and by cause he foriusted sir Palomydes the good knight / So when they had
taken their charge / they withdrewe hem to make hem ready to do bataile /
Then said sir Bleoberys to his brother sir Blamore / fair dear brother remember
of what kyn we be come of / and what a man is sir lancelot du lake / neither
ferther nor nere but brother children / and there was never none of our kyn
that ever was shamed in bataille / and rather suffer death brother than to be
shamed / Brother said Blamore have ye no doubt of me / for I shall never shame
none of my blood / hou be it I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing
good knight as of his time one of the world / yet shall I never yield me nor say
the loathe word / well may he happen to smite me down with his great myt of
chyualry / but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as recreaunt / God
speed you well said Bleoberys for ye shall find him the myghtyest knight that
ever ye had ado with all / for I know him for I have had ado with him God me
speed said Blamor de ganys / and therewith he took his horse at the one end of
the lystes / and sire Trystram at other end of the lystes / and so they
f^utryd their speres / and came to gyders as it had been thonder / and there
sir Tristram thorou great might smote down sir Blamore and his horse to the
earth / Then anon sir Blamor avoided his horse and pulled out his swerd /
and threw his shield before him / and ladde sir Trystram alyghte / for though
an horse has failed me I trust to god the earth will not fail me / And then
sire Trystram alyght and dressid him unto batail / and there they lasshed to
gyder strongly as racyng and tracyng / foynynge and dasshyng many sad strokes
that the kings and knights had g^^te wonder that they might stand / for
ever they fought like wood men so that there were never knights seen fight
more fyersly than they did / for sire Blamore was so hasty he would have no rest
that all men wondered that they had brethe to stand on their feet / and all
the place was blody that they fought in / And at the last sire Tristram smote
sir Blamor such a buffet upon the helm that he there fell done upon his
side / and sir Trystram stood and beheld him /

Capitulum xxiij
Then when sir Blamor might speak / he said thus Sire Tristram de Lyones I
require the as thou art a noble knight and the best knight that ever I fond
that thou will slay me out / for I would not live to be made lord of all the
earth / for I have lever dye with worship than live with shame / and needs sir
Tristram thou must slay me / or else thou shall never win the feld / for I
will never say the loathe word / And therefore if thou dare slay me / slay me /
I require the / when sir Tristram herd him say so knyghtely / he wyste not
what to do with him / he remembryng him of both parties of what blood he was
comen / and for sir Launcelots sake he would be loathe to slay him / and in the
other party in no wise he might not chese / but that he must make him to say
the loathe word or else to slay him / Then sire Tristram starte alak and went
to the kings that were Iuges / and there he kneled down to fore hem and
besoughte hem for their worshippes and for king Arthurs and sir Lau^celots
sake that they would take this matter in their hands / For my fair lords said
sir tristram hit were shame and pity / that this noble knight that yonder lies
should be slain / for ye here well / shamed will he not be / and I pray to god
that he never be slain nor shamed for me / And as for the king for whom I
fight fore I shall require him as I am his true champyon and true knight in
this field that he will have mercy upon this knight / So god me help said
king Anguysshe I will for your sake sire tristram be ruled as ye will have me
/ For I know you for my true knight / And therefore I will hertely pray the
kings that been here as Iuges to take hit in their hands / And the kings
that were Iuges called sir Bleoberys to them / and asked him his advise My
lords said Bleoberys / though my brother be beten and has the wers thorou
might of arms I dare say though sire Trystram has beten his body / he has
not beten his heart / and I thank god he is not shamed this day / And rather
than he should be shamed / I require you said Bleoberys let sir Tristram slay
him out / It shall not be so said the kings / for his part adversary both
the king and the champyon have pity of sire Blamors knyghthode / My lords
said Bleoberys I will right well as ye will /

Then the kings called the king of Irland and fond him goodely and tretabyl
/ And then by all their aduyses sire Tristram and sire Bleoberys took up
sire Blamore / and the two brethren were accorded with king Anguysshe / and
kyssed and made frendys for ever / And then sire Blamor and sire Trystram
kyssed to gyders / and there they made their oaths that they would never none of
them two betheren fight with sire Trystram / and sire Trystram made the same
oath And for that gentyl bataille all the blood of sire Lancelot loved sire
Trystram for ever /

Then king Anguysshe and sire Tristram took their leave ande sailed in to
Irland with great noblesse and joy / So when they were in Irland the king
let make it known thoroute all the land how and in what manner sire Trystram
had done for him Then the Queen and all that there were made the most of
him that they might / But the Joy that la beale Isoud made of sir Tristram
there might no tongue tell / for of all men erthely she loved him most

Capitulum xxiiij
Then upon a day king Anguysshe asked sir Tristram why he asked not his
bone / For what someuer he had promised him / he should have hit without fail
Sire said sire Trystram now is hit time this is all that I will desire that
ye will give me la beale Isoud your daughter not for my self but for mine
vnkel king Mark that shall have her to wife / for so have I promised him /
Allas said the king I had lever than all the land that I have / ye would wedde
her your self / Sire and I did than I were shamed for ever in this world / and
falls of my promise / Therefore said sire Trystram I pray you hold your promise
that ye promised me / for this is my desire that ye will give me la Beale
Isoud to goo with me in to Cornewaile for to be wedded to king Mark mine vnkel
/ As for that said king Anguysshe ye shall have her with you to do with her
what it please you / that is for to say if that ye list to wedde her your self
that is me leuest / And if ye will give her unto king Mark your vnkel that
is in your choice /

So to make short conclusion la beale Isoud was made ready to goo with sire
Trystram and dame Bragwayne went with her for her chyef gentylwoman with many
other / then the queen Isouds mother gaf to her and dame Bragwayne her
daughters gentilwoman and unto Gouernaile a drink and charged them that what
day king Mark should wedde that same day they should give him that drink /
so that king Mark should drink to la beale Isoud / and then said the Queen
I undertake either shall love other the days of their life / So this drink
was yeuen unto dame Bragwayne and unto Gouernaile / And then anon sire
Trystram took the sea / and la Beale Isoud / and when they were in their
caban hit happed so that they were thursty / and they saw a little flacked of
gold stand by them / and hit seemed by the color and the taste that it was
noble wyn /

Then sire Trystram took the flacket in his hand / and said Madame Isoud here
is the best drink that ever ye drank that dame Bragwayne your maiden and
Gouernayle my servant have kept for them self / Then they lough and made
good chere and either drank to other freely / and they thought never drink
that ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good / But by that their
drink was in their bodies / they loved either other so well that never their
love departed for well neither for woe / And thus it happed the love first
betwixe sire Tristram and la beale Isoud / the which love never departed the
days of their life / so then they sailed till by fortune they came nyghe a
castle that hight Pluere And there by arrived for to repose them wenyng to them
to have had good herborou / but anon as sir Trystram was with in the castle /
they were taken prisoners / for the customme of the castle was such who that
rode by that castle and brought any lady he must needs fight with the lord
that hyghte Breunor And if it were so that Breunor wanne the feld / then
should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death what that ever they
were / and if hit were so that the strange knight wanne the feld of sir
Breunor / then should he dye and his lady both / this custom was used many
wynters / for hit was called the castle pluere that is to say the weeping
castle

Capitulum xxv
THus as sire Trystram and la beale Isoud were in prison / hit happed a knight
and a lady came unto them / where they were to chere them / I have merueille
said Tristram unto the knyt and the lady what is the cause the lord of this
Castle holds us in prison / hit was never the custom of no place of worship
that ever I came in / when a knight and a lady asked herborugh / and they to
receive hem / and after to destroy them that been his gestes / Sir said the
knygt this is the old custom of this castle that when a knight comes here /
he must needs fight with our lord / and he that is weyker must lose his head
/ And when that is done if his lady that he brings / be fouler than our
lords wife / she must lose her heed / And if she be fayrer preued than is our
lady / then shall the lady of this castle lose her heed / So god me help
said sire Tristram this is a foul custom and a shameful / But one auau^tage
have I said sir Trystram I have a lady is fair ynou fayrer saw I never in
all my life days / And I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not lose
her heed / and rather than I should lose my heed I will fight for hit on a
fair field / Wherefore Sire knight I pray you tell your lord that I will be
ready as to morn with my lady and my self to do batail if hit be so I may
have my horse and mine armor / Sire said that knight I undertake that your
desire shall be spedde right well /

And then he said take your rest and look that ye be up by times and make
you ready and your lady / for ye shall want no thing that you behooves / and
there with he departed and on the morn by times that same knight came to sire
Trystram and fetched him out and his lady and broute him horse and armor that
was his own / and badde him make him ready to the feld / for all the estates
and comyns of that lordship were there ready to behold that bataille and
Judgment /

Then came sire Breunor the lord of that Castle with his lady in his hand
muffeld / and asked sire Trystram where was his lady / for and thy lady be
fayrer than mine with thy swerd smite of my ladies head / and if my lady be
fayrer than mine / with my swerd I must stryke of her heed / And if I may
win the / yet shall thy lady be mine / and thou shall lose thy head / Sire
said Trystram this is a foul custom and horrible / and rather than my lady
should lose her heed / yet had I lever lose my head /

Nay nay said sire Breunor the ladies shall be first showed to gyder / and the
one shall have her Judgment / Nay I will not so said sire Tristram / For
here is none that will give ryghteuous Judgment / But I doubt not said sir
Tristram my lady is fayrer than thine / And that will I preue and make good
with my hand / And who someuer he be that will say the contrary I will preue
hit on his head And there with sire Tristram showed la beale Isoud / and turned
her thryes about with his naked swerd in his hand And when sire Breunor saw
that he did the same wise torn his lady / But when sire Breunor beheld la
beale Isoud / him thought he saw never a fayrer lady / and then he dradde
his ladies head should be of / and so all the people that were there present gaf
Judgment that la beale Isoud was ^he fayrer lady and the better made / how now
said sir Tristra^me seems it were pity that my lady should lose her heed / but
by cause thou and she of long time have used this wicked custom / and by you
both have many good knights and ladies ben destroyed / for that cause it were
no loss to destroy you both / So god me help said sir Breunor for to say
the so^he / thy lady is fayrer than mine / and that me sore repents And so I
here the people pryuely say / for of all wymmen I saw none so fair / and
therefore and thou will slay my lady I doubt not but I shall slay the and have thy
lady / Thou shall win her said sir Trystram as dear as ever knyt wan lady /
And by cause of thyn own Judgment as thou would have done to my lady if that
she had been fouler / and by cause of the evil custom give me thy lady said
Trystram / and there with all sir Tristram strode unto him and took his lady
from him / and with an auke stroke he smote of her head clean / well knight said
sir Breunor now have thou done me a despyte /

Capitulum xxvj
NOw take thyn horse sythen I am lady les I will wyn thy lady and I may / then
they took their horses / and came to gyders as hit had been the thonder / and
sire Trystram smote sir Breunor clean from his horse / and lytely he rose up And
as sir Trystram came again by him / he threst his horse thorou out both the
sholders that his horse hurled here and there / and fell deed to the ground /
And ever sir Breunor ran after to have slain sire Tristram / but sire
Tristram was light and nymel and voyded his horse lightely / And or ever sir
Trystram might dress his sheld and his swerd / the other gaf him three or four
sad strokes Then they rasshed to gyders like two bores tracyng and
trauercyng mytely and wisely as two noble knights / For this sire Breunor was
a proved knight and had been or than the death of many good knights / that
it was pity that he had so long endured / Thus they fout hurlyng here and there
ny two hours and eyder were wounded sore / then at the last sir Breunor
rasshed upon sir Trystram and took him in his arms / for he trusted much to
his strength / Then was sir Trystram called the strengest and the highest
knight of the world / For he was called byggar than sir lau^celot / but sir
Lancelot was better brethed / So anon sire Trystram thrust sir Breunor down
grouelynge / and then he unlaced his helm / and struck of his head / And
then al they that longed to the castle came to him and did him homage and
feaute prayenge him / that he would abide there stylle a litel while to fordo
that foul custom Sir Trystram granted there to / the mean while one of the
knights of the castle rode unto sire Galahad the haut prince the which was
sir Breunors sone / which was a noble knyt and told him what mysauenture his
fader had and his mother

Capitulum xxvij
Then came sir Galahad and the king with the honderd knights with him / and
this sir Galahad proffered to fight with sir Trystram hand for hand / and so
they made them ready to go unto bataile on horsbak with great courage / Then
sir Galahad and sir Trystram met to gyders so hard that eyder bare other
down horse and all to the earth / And then they avoided their horses as
noble knights and dressid their sheldes and drew their swerdes wi^h Ire and
rancour / and they lasshed to gyder many sad strokes / and one while
strykynge another while foynynge / tracynge and trauersynge as noble knights /
thus they fought long nere half a day and eyder were sore wounded / At the last
sire Trystram waxed light and bygge / and doubled his strokes and drofe sir
Galahad abak on the one side and on the other / so that he was like to have been
slain / With that came the king with the honderd knights and all that
felauship went fyersly up on sir Tristram / when sir Trystram saw them coming
upon him / then he wist well he might not endure / Then as a wise knight of
werre he said to sir Galahaud the haut prince sire ye show to me no knyghthode
for to suffer all your men to have adoo with me al at ones / And as me seems
ye be a noble knight of your hands / hit is great shame to you / So god me
help said sire Galahad there is none other way but thou must yield the to me
/ outher else to dye said sir Galahad to sir Trystram I will rather yield me to
you than dye / for that is more for the might of your men than of your hands /
And there with all sir Trystram took his own suerd by the point / and put
the pomel in the hand of sir Galahad / there with all came the king with the
honderd knights / and hard began to assaylle sir Trystram / let be said sir
Galahad be ye not so hardy to touch him / for I have given this knight his
life / that is your shame said the king with the C knights / has he not
slain your fader and your mother / As for that said sire Galahad I may not wit
him gretely for my fader had him in prison / and enforced him to do bataill
with him / and my fader had such a customme that was a shameful custom that
what knight came there to ask herborouh his lady must needs deye but if she
were fayrer than my mother / And if my fader overcame that knight he must needs
deye / This was a shameful customme and usage / a knight for his herberowe
asking to have such herborage / And for this customme I would never draw
about him / So god me help said the king this was a shameful customme /
Truly said sire Galahad so seemed me / and me seemed it had been great pity that
this knight should have been slain / for I dare say he is the noblest man that
bears life / but if it were sir lau^celot du lake / Now fair knight said sir

ANd then sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time and took the sea
/ And the mean while word came unto sir Lancelot and to sir Trystram that
sire Carados the mighty king that was made like a gyaunt / that fought with
sir Gawayn and gaf him such strokes that he swouned in his sadel / and after
that he took him by the collar / and pulled him out of his sadel / and fast
bound him to the sadel bow / and so rode his wey with him toward his castle
/ And as he rode by fortune sir Lancelot met with sire Carados and anon he
knew sire Gawayne / that lay bound after him / A said sir Lancelot unto sire
Gawayne how stand it with you / Never so hard said sir gawayn onles that ye
help me / for so god me help without ye rescowe me I know no knight that may
but outher you or sir Trystram / where for sir Lancelot was heavy of sir
Gawayns words / And then sir Lancelot bad sir Carados leye down that
knight / and fight with me / thou art but a fool said sire Carados / for I
will serve you in the same wise / as for that said sir Lancelot spare me not
/ for I warn the I will not spare the / And then he bond sir Gawayne hand
and foot / and so threw him to the ground / And then he gate his spear of
his squire / and departed from sir lancelot to fetch his course / and so
either met with other / and brake their speres to their hands / and then
they pulled out swerdes / and hurtled to gyders on horsbak more than an hour /
And at the last sire lancelot smote sir Carados such a buffet upon the helm
that it perched his brain pan / So then sir Lancelot took sir Carados by
the collar and pulled him under his horse feet / And then he alyte and pulled
of his helm / and struck of his head / And then sir Lancelot unbound sir
Gawayne / so this same tale was told to sir Galahad and to sir Trystram / here
may ye here the noblenes that follows sir lancelot / Allas said sir Trystram
and I had not this message in hand with this fair lady / truly I would never
stynte or I had fond sire Lancelot / Then sire Trystram and la beale Isoud
went to the sea and come in to Cornewaile / and there all the barons met
hem /

ANd anon they were rychely wedded with great nobley / But ever as the
frensshe book says sir Trystram and la beale Isoud loved ever to gyders /
Then was there great Iustes and great torneyenge / and many lords and ladies
were at that feast / and sir Trystram was most preysed of all other / thus
dured the feast long / and after the feast was done / within a little while
after by the assent of two ladies that were with queen Isoud / they ordained
for hate and envy for to destroy dame Bragwayne / that was maiden and lady
unto la beale Isoud / and she was sent in to the forest for to fetch herbs /
and there she was met and bound feet and hand to a tree / and so she was
bounden three days / And by fortune sir Palamydes fond dame Bragwayne / and
there he delyuerd her from the death / and brought her to a nonnery there
beside for to be recouerd / when Isoud the queen mist her maiden / wete ye
well she was right heavy as ever was any queen / for of all erthely wymmen she
loved her best / the cause was for she came with her out of her countreye /
And so upon a day queen Isoud walked in to the forest to put aweye her
thoughts / and there she went her self unto a well / and made great moan /
and suddenly there came Palamydes to her / and had herd all her complaynte /
and said Madame Isoud and ye will grant me my bone / I shall bring to you
dame Bragwayne sauf and sound / And the queen was so glad of his profer / that
suddenly unadvised she granted all his asking / well madame said Palamydes I
trust to your promise / And if ye will abide here half an hour / I shall
bring her to you / I shall abide you said la beale Isoud And sir Palamydes
rode forth his way to that nonnery / and lightly he came again with dame
Bragwayne / but by her good will she would not have comen again / by cause for
love of the queen she stood in aue^ture of her life / Notwithstanding half
against her will she went with sir Palamydes unto the queen / And when the
queen saw her / she was passing glad Now madame said Palamydes remember upon
your promise / for I have fulfilled my promise / Sir Palamydes said the queen I
wot not what is your desire / But I will that ye wete how be it I promised
you largely I thought none evil nor I warn you none ylle will I do / Madame
said sir palamydes / as at this time ye shall not know my desire / but before
my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will have my desire that ye
have promised me / And therewith the queen departed and rode home to the king /
and sir palamydes rode after her / And when sir Palamydes came before the king
/ he said sir king I require you as ye be a ryghteuous king that ye will Judge
me the right / Tell me your cause said the king and ye shall have right /

Sire said Palamydes I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again dame
Bragwayne that she had lost upon this covenant that she should grant me a
bone that I would ask / and without grutchynge outher auyseme^t she granted me
/ what say ye my lady said the king / hit is as he says so god me help said
the queen / to say the sothe / I promised him his asking for love and joy
that I had to see her / Well madame said the king / and if ye were hasty to
grant him what bone he would ask / I will well that ye perform your promise
/ Then said Palamydes I will that ye wete that I will have your queen to lead her and govern her where as me list / There with the king stood still /
and be thought him of sir Trystram / and demed that he would rescowe her / And
then hastily the king ansuerd take her with the adue^tures that shall fall
of hit / for as I suppose thou wylt not enjoy her no while / As for that said
Palamydes I dare right well abide the adventure / and so to make short tale /
sir Palamydes took her by the hand / and said Madame grutche not to goo with me
/ for I desire no thing but your own promise / As for that said the queen I
fere not gretely to go with the / hou be it thou have me at advantage upon my
promise / For I doubt not I shall be worshipfully rescowed fro the / As for
that said sir Palamydes be it as it be may / So queen Isoud was set behind
Palamydes / and rode his way / anon the king sent after sir Trystram / but in
no wise he could be found / for he was in the forest an huntyng / for that was
alweyes his custom / but if be used arms / to chase and to hunte in the
forestes / Allas said the king now I am shamed for ever that by mine own
assente my lady and my queen shall be devoured / Then came forth a knight
his name was lambegus / and he was a knight of sir Trystram / My lord said this
knight sithe ye have trust in my lord sire Tristram / wete ye well for his sake
I will ride after your queen and rescowe her / or else I shall be b^ten /
Gramercy said the king / and I live sir Lambegus I shall deserve hit / And
then sir Lambegus armed him / and rode after as fast as he might / And
then within a while he ouertoke sir Palamydes / And then sir Palamydes
left the queen / what art thou said Palamydes / art thou Trystram / nay he
said I am his servant / and my name is sir Lambegus / that me repents
said Palamydes / I had lever thou had ben sire Trystram / I bileue you
well said Lambegus / but when thou metest with sir Trystram thou shall have thy
hands full / And then they hurtled to gyders and all to braste their speres
/ and then they pulled out their swerdes / and hewed on helmes and hauberkes
/ At the last sire Palamydes gaf sir Lambegus such a wonnd that he fell down
like a deed knight to the earth / Then he looked after la beale Isoud / and
then she was gone he nyst where / wete ye well sir Palamydes was never so
heavy / So the queen ran in to the forest / and there she fond a well / and
theryn she had thought to have drouned her self / And as good fortune would
there came a knight to her that had a Castle there by his name was sire Adtherp
/ And when he fond the queen in that meschyef / he rescowed her / and brought
her to his castle / And when he wist what she was he armed him / and took his
horse and said / he would be auengyd upon palamydes and so he rode on till he
met with him / and there sir Palamydes wounded him sore / and by force he
made him to tell him the cause why he did bataille with him / and how he had
ladde the queen unto his castle / Now bring me there said palamydes or thou
shall dye of my hands / Sir said sir Adtherp I am so wounded I may not follow
/ but ride you this way and hit shall bring you in to my castle / and there
within is the queen / Then sire Palamydes rode still till he came to the
Castle / And at a wyndowe La Beale Isoud saw sir Palamydes / then she made
the yates to be shette strongly / And when he saw he might not come within the
castle / he put of his brydel and his sadel / and put his horse to pasture /
and set him self down at gate like a man that was out of his wit that

Gouernaile his man / haste the that I were armed and on horsbak / for well I
wot Lambegus has no might nor strength to withstand sir Palamydes / Allas

and there he fond sir Adtherp sore wounded / and he told him hou the queen would
have drouned her self had not he ben / And how for her sake and love he had
taken upon him to do bataille with sir Palamydes / where is my lady said sire
Trystram / Sir said the knight she is sure enough within my Castle / and she
can hold her within hit / Gramercy said sire Trystram of thy great goodenes /
and so he rode till he came nyghe to that Castle / and then sir Trystram saw

/ and there Tristram smote down sire Palamydes over his horse tail / Then
lightely sire Palamydes put his sheld before him and drew his swerd / And
there began strong bataill on both parties / for both they fought for the
love of one lady / and ever she lay on the walls and beheld them / hou they
fought out of mesure / and either were wounded possyng sore / but Palamydes
was much sorer wounded / thus they fought tracynge and trauercyng more than
two hours that well nygh for dole and sorrow la beale Isoud swouned / Allas she
said that one I loved and yet do / and the other I love not / yet it were
great pity that I should see sir palamydes slain / for well I know by that time
the end be done sir Palamydes is but a deed knyt / by cause he is not
crystened I would be both that he should dye a sarasyn / And there with all she
came down and bisought sire Trystram to fight no more / A madame said he

will leave fighting at this time for your sake / Then she said to sire
Palamydes this shall be your charge that thou shall goo out of this country
while I am therein / I will obey your commandment said sire Palamydes / the
which is sore against my will Then take thy way said la beale Isoud unto

for to take hem and sklanndre hem / So upon a day sir Tristram talked with la
beale Isoud in a wyndowe / and that aspyed sir Andred and told it to the king
/ Then king Mark took a swerd in his hand and came to sir Tristram and
called him falls traitor / and would have stryken him / But sir Trystram was
nyghe him and ran under his swerd and took hit out of his hand / And
then the king cried where are my knights and my men / I charge you slay
this traitor / But at that time there was not one would meue for his words /
When sire Trystram saw that there was not one would be against him / he shoke
the swerd to the king and made countenance as though he would have stryken him
/ And then king Mark fled / and sire tristram followed him and smote upon
him five or six strokes flatlynge on the neck that he made him to fall upon
the nose / and then sir Tristram yede his way and armed him and took his
horse and his men / and so he rode in to that forest / And there upon a day

as few now ben living / and his name is sir Lamorak de Galys / it were great
shame said the king that he should goo thus aweye onles that sum of you
met with him better / Sire said sire Tristram me seems it were no worship
for a noble man to have adoo with him / And for by cause at this time he has
done over much for any mean knight living / therefore as me seems hit were
great shame and vylony to tempte him any more at this time / in so much as he
and his horse are weary both For the deeds of arms that he has done this day
and they be well considered / it were enough for sir Lancelot du lake / As for
that said king Mark I require you as ye love me and my lady the Queen La

sir Tristram ye bid me do a thing that is against knygthode / And well I can

will take hit for great unkindness / For ever one good is both to take another
at disauauntage / But by cause I will not displease you / as ye require me / so
will I do and obey your commandment And so sire Tristram armed him and
took his horse / and putt him forth / and there sire Lamerak met him myghtely

to her husband / And if she were falls she should spylle all the drink / And if
she were true to her lord she might drink peasyble / and by cause of the queen
Gueneuer and in the despyte of sire Lancelot this horn was sent unto king
Arthur / and by force sire Lamorak made that knight to tell all the cause
why he bare that horn / Now shalt thou bear this horn said Lamorak unto king
Mark or else chese thou to dye for it / For I tell the plainly in despyte and
repreef of sire Tristrams thou shalt bear that horn unto king Mark his
vnkel / and say thou to him that I sent hit him for to assay his lady / And if
she be true to him he shall preue her / So the knight went his way unto

maade Queen Isoud to drink thereof / and an honderd ladies / and there were but
four ladies of all tho that drank clean / Allas said king Mark this is a

ladies / Then the Barons gadred them to gyder and said plainly they would not
have tho ladies burnt for an horn maade by sorcery that came from as falls a
sorceresse and wytche as tho was living / For that horn did never good but
caused stryf and debate / and alweyes in her days she had been an enemy to all
true lovers / So there were many knights made their auowe / and ever they met
with Morgan le fay that they would show her short curtosye / Also sir Tristram
was passing wroth that sire Lamorak sent that horn unto king Mark for well
he knew that hit was done in the despyte of him / And therefore he thought to
quyte sire Lamorak / Then sire Tristram used daily and nyghtely to go to

and of sum of the Barons sire Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood
upon the sea rocks there for to take his Judgment / and so he was led
bounden with forty knights / And when sire Tristram saw that there was none
other boot / but needs that he must dye / then said he fair lords remember
what I have done for the Countreye of Cornewaile / and in what Ieopardy I have been in for the well of you all / For when I fout for the truage of cornewaile
with sir Marhaus the good knight / I was promised for to be better rewarded /
when ye all reffused to take the bataille / therefore as ye be good gentyl
knights / see me not thus shamefully to dye / for it is shame to all
knyghthode thus to see me dye / For I dare say said sire Tristram that I never
met with no knight but I was as good as he / or better / Fie upon the said sir
Andred falls traitor that thou art with thyn auau^cynge / for all thy boost
thou shall dye this day / O Andred Andred said sir Tristram thou sholdest be
my kynnesman / and now thou art to me full vnfrendely / but and there were no mo
but thou and I / thou would not put me to death / No said sir Andred / and
there with he drew his swerd / and would have slain him / When sir Tristram
saw him make such countenance / he looked upon both his hands that were
fast bounden unto two knights / and suddenly he pulled them both to him / and
vnwrast his hands / and then he lepte unto his cosyn sir Andred and wroth
his swerd out of his hands / then he smote sir Andred that he fylle to the

then sir Tristram gate the chapel and kept hit myghtely / then the cry
was great / and the people drew fast unto sire Andred moo than an honderd /
when sir Tristram saw the people draw unto him he remembryd he was naked /
and sperd fast the chapel door and brake the barrys of a wyndowe / and so he

with sir Lancelot du lake / and told him of the marriage of sire Tristram /
Then said sire Lancelot / Fie upon him untrue knight to his lady that so
noble a knight as sir Trystram is should be found to his first lady falls / la
beale Isoud / queen of Cornewaile / But say ye him this / said sire Lancelot
that of all knights in the world I loved him most / and had most joy of
him / and all was for his noble deeds / and let him wete the love bitwene him
and me is done for ever / And that I give him warnyng from this day forth as
his mortal enemy

Then departed sir Suppynabyles unto Bretayne again / and there he fond sir
Tristram / and told him / that he had been in king Arthurs court / Then said
sir Tristram herd ye any thing of me / So god me help said sire Suppynabyles
/ there I herd sire Lancelot speak of you great shame / and that ye be a falls
knight to your lady / and he bad me do you to wete that he will be your
mortal enemy in every place where he may mete you / That me repents said
Tristram / for of all knights I loved to be in his felauship / So sire
Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that noble knights should deffame him
for the sake of his lady / And in this mean while la beale Isoud maade a
letter unto Queen Gueneuer complaynyng her of the untruth of sir Tristram and
how he had wedded the kings daughter of Bretayne / Queen Gueneuer sent her
another letter / and badde her be of good chere / for she should have Joy after
sorou / for sire tristram was so noble a knyt called / that by crafts of
sorcery ladies would make such noble men to wedde them / but in the end Queen
Gueneuer said hit shall be thus / that he shall hate her / and love you better
than ever he did to fore So leave we sire Trystram in Bretayne and speak we of
sire Lamerak de galys / that as he sailed his ship fell on a rok and perysshed
all / save sire Lamerak and his squire / and there he swam myghtely / and
fysshees of the isle of s^ruage took him up and his squire was drouned / and the
ship men had great labor to save sire Lamoraks life / for all the comfort
that they could do / and the lord of that isle hight sire Nabon le noyre a
great mighty gyaunt / And this sir Nabon hated all the knights of king
Arthurs / and in no wise he would do hem favor / And these fysshers told sir
Lamorak all the gyse of sire Nabon / how there came never knight of king
Arthurs but he destroyed him / And at last bataille that he did was slain
sir Nanowne le petyte / the which he put to a shameful death in despyte of
king Arthur / for he was drawn lymme meal / That forthynketh me said sir
Lamerak for that knights death / for he was my cosyn / And if I were at mine
ease as well as ever I was I would revenge his death / Pees said the fysshers and
make here no words / for or ever ye depart from hens sire Nabon must know
that ye have been here / or else we should dye for your sake / So that I be hole
said Lamorak of my disease / that I have taken in the sea / I will that ye
tell him that I am a knyt of king Arthurs / for I was never aferd to reneye
my lord /

NOw turn we unto sire Trystram that upon a day he took a little Barget and
his wife Isoud la blau^che maynys with sire kay hedyus her brother to play hem
in the cosstes / And when they were from the land / there was a wind drofe hem
in to the cost of walys upon this isle of seruage / where as was sire Lamorak
and there the Barget all to rofe and there dame Isoud was hurt / and as well as
they myte they gate in to the forest / and there by a well he saw Segwarydes
and a damoysel / And then either salewed other / sire said Segwarydes I
know you for sire Tristram de Lyones the man in the world that I have most
cause to hate by cause ye departed the love bitwene me and my wife / but as for
that said Segwarydes I will never hate a noble knyt for a lyt lady / And
therefore I pray you be my friend and I will be yours unto my power / for wete
ye well / ye are hard bestad in this valey / and we shall have enough to do
either of us to socoure other / And then sir Segwarydes brought sir Trystram
to a lady there by that was borne in Cornewaile / and she told him all the
peryls of that valey / and how there came never knight there but he were taken
prisoner or slain / wete you well fair lady said sir Trystram that I slew sire
Marhaus and delyuerd Cornewaile from the truage of Irland / And I am he that
delyuerd the king of Irlande from sire Blamor de ganys / and I am he that beat
sire Palamydes / and wete ye well I am sire Trystram de lyones that by the grace
of god shall deliver this woeful isle of seruage / So sir Tristram was well eased
/ then one told him there was a knight of king Arthur yt had wrackyd on the
rocks / what is his name said sir Tristram / we wot not said the fysshers but
he keeps it no counceil but that he is a knight of King Arthurs / and by the
mighty lord of this isle he sets naught by / I pray you said sir Tdestram
and ye may bring him hyder that I may see him / And if he be any of the
Knights of Arthurs I shall know him / Then the lady prayed the fysshers to
bring him to her place / So on the morrow they brout him thither in a fysshers
raiment / And as soon as sire Tristram saw him he smyled upon him and knew
him well / but he knew not sir Tristram / Fair sir said sire Tristram me
seems by your chere ye have been diseased but late / and also me thinks I
should know you here to fore / I will well said sir Lamorak that ye have seen
me and met with me / Fair sir said sir tristram tell me your name / upon a
covenant I will tell you said sir Lamorak / that is / that ye will tell me
whether ye be lord of this Island or no that is called Nabon le noyre / For
sothe said sir tristram I am not he nor I hold not of him I am his foo as well
as ye be / and so shall I be found or I depart out of this isle / Well said
sir Lamorak syn ye have said so largely unto me / My name is sire Lamorak de
galis sone unto king Pellinore / forsothe I trow well said sir tristram / for
and ye said other / I know the contrary / What are ye said sire Lamorak that
knows me / I am sir Trystram de lyones / A sire remember ye not of the fall
ye did give me ones / and after ye refused me to fight on foot / that was not
for fere I had of you said sire Tristram / but me shamed at that time to have
more a do with you / for me seemed ye had enough / but sire Lamorack for my
kyndenes many ladies ye put to a repreef / when ye sent the horn from
Morgan le fay to king Mark where as ye did this in despyte of me / Well said
he / and it were to do again / so would I do / for I had lever stryf and
debate fell in king Marks court rather than Arthurs court / for the honor
of both courts be not y like As to that said sir Tristram I know well / But
that that was done it was for despyte of me / but all your malice I thank
god hurt not gretely / Therefore said sir Tristram ye shall leave all your malice
/ and so will I and let us assay hou we may win worship bitwene you and me
upon this gyaunt sir Nabon le noyre / that is lord of this Island to destroy
him / Sir said sir Lamorak now I understand your knyghthode / it may not be
falls that all men say / for of your bounte nobles and worship of all
knights ye are pyerles / And for your curtosy and gentilnes I showed you
vngentilnesse / and that now me repents

IN the mean time there came word that sir Nabon had made a cry that all the
people of that isle should be at his castle the fyfthe day after / And the same
day the sone of Nabon should be made knight / and all the knights of that
valey and there about should be there to Just / and all tho of the Royamme of
Logrys should be there to Just with them of Northwalys / and thither came five
honderd knights / and they of the country brought thither sire Lamorak and sir
Tristram and sire kehydyus and sire Segwarides / for they durst none other wise
do / and then sir Nabon lent sire Lamorak horse and armor at sire Lamoraks
desire / and sire Lamorak Iusted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon and
all the people said there was never knyt that ever they saw do such deeds of
arms / for as the Frensshe book says he foriusted all^ that were there for
the most party of five honderd knights that none abode him in his sadel
Then sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play / for I saw never no
knight do so much upon a day / I will well said sire Lamorak play as I
may but I am weary and sore brysed / and there either gate a spear / but Nabon
would not encountre with sire Lamorak / but smote his horse in the forhede and
so slew him / and then sire Lamorak yede on foot and turned his shield and
drew his swerd / and there began strong bataill on foot / But sir Lamorak
was so sore brysed and short brethed that he tracyd and trauercyd somewhat abak
/ Fair felawe said sire Nabon hold thy hand and I shall show the more
curtosye / than ever I showed knight by cause I have seen this day thy noble
knyghthode / And therefore stand thou by and I will wete whether any of thy
felawes will have adoo with me / Then when sir Tristram herd that / he
stepte forth and said Nabon lend me horse and sure armor and I will have adoo
with the well felawe said sir Nabon goo thou to yonder pauelione and arm the of
the best thou fyndest there / and I shall play a merueillous play with the /
Then said sire Tristram look ye play well or else peraduentur I shall learn
you a new play that is well said felawe said sir Nabon / So when sir Tristram
was armed as him lyked best and well shelded and swerded / he dressid to him on
foot / For well he knew sir Nabon would not abide a stroke with a spear /
therefore he would slay all knights horses / Now fair felawe said sir Nabon
let us play / So then they fought long on foot tracynge and trauercynge
smiting and foynynge long without any rest / At last sir Nabon praid him
to tell him his name / Sire Nabon I tell the my name is sir Tristram de
lyones a knyt of Cornewail under king Mark / thou art welcome said sir nabon
/ for of all knights I have most desired to fight with the or with sir
Lancelot / So then they went egerly to gyders and sire tristram slew sire
nabon / and so forth with he lepte to his sone / and struck of his head / and
then all the country said / they would hold of sire Tristram / nay said
sire Tristram I will not so / here is a worshipful knight sir Lamorak de
galys that for me he shall be lord of this countreye / for he has done here
great deeds of arms / nay said sir Lamorak I will not be lord of this country
/ for I have not deserved it as well as ye / therefore give ye hit where ye will
for I will none have / well said sire Tristram syn ye nor I will not have hit
/ let us give hit to him that has not so well deserved hit / Do as ye list
said Segwarydes / for the yefte is yours for I will none have and I had deserved
hit / So was it yeuen to segwarydes whereof he thanked hem / and so was he
lord / and worshipfully he did govern hit / And then sir Segwarydes delyuerd
all prisoners and set good governance in that valey / and so he turned in
to Cornewaile / and told king Mark and la beale Isoud how sir Tristram had
auaunced him to the isle of seruage / and there he proclaimed in all Cornewaile of
all the adventures of these two knights / so was hit openly known / But full
woe was la Beale Isoud when she herd tell that sire Tristram was wedded to
Isoud la blaunche maynys /

So torn we unto sir Lamorak that rode toward Arthurs court / and sire
Tristrams wife and Kehydyus took a vessel and sailed in to Bretayne unto king
Howel where he was welcome / And when he herd of these adue^tures they
merueilled of his noble deeds / Now torn we unto sir Lamorak that when he was
departed from sire Tristram / he rode out of the forest till he came to an
hermytage / when the heremyte saw him / he asked him from whens he came / sir
said sir Lamorak I come fro this valey / sir said the hermyte thereof I
merueille / For this xx winter I saw never no knight pass this country / but
he was other slain or vylaynously wounded or pass as a pour prisoner / Tho
ylle customs said sir lamorak are fordone / for sir Tristram slew your lord
sir Nabon and his sone / then was the heremyte glad and all his brethren /
for he said there was never such a tyrant among crys^en men / And therefore said
the hermyte this valey and frau^ceis we will hold of sire Tristram / So on
the morrow sir Lamorak departed / And as he rode he saw four knights fight
against one / and that one knight defended him well but at last the four
knights had him down / And then sir Lamorak went betwixe them / and asked
them why they would slay that one knight / and said hit was shame four against
one / Thou shall well wete said the four knights that he is false / that is
your tale said sir Lamorak / And when I here him also speak / I will say as
ye say / Then said Lamorak / a knight can ye not excuse you / but that ye
are a falls knight / Sir said he yet can I excuse me both with my word and with
my hands / that I will make good upon one of the best of them my body to his
body / Then spoke they al attones / we will not Ieopardy our bodies as for the
/ But wete thou well they said and king Arthur were here him self it should not
lie in his power to save his life / That is to much said / said sire Lamorak /
but many speak ^^hynde a man more than they will say to his face / And by
cause of your words ye shall understand that I am one of the symplest of
king Arthurs court / in the worship of my lord now do your best / and in
despyte of you I shall rescowe him / And then they lasshed all at ones to
sir Lamorak / but anon at two strokes sire Lamorak had slain two of them /
and then the other two fled So then sire Lamorak turned again to that
knight / and asked him his name / sire he said my name is sire Frolle of the
out Isles / then he rode with sire Lamorak and bare him company / And as they
rode by the way / they saw a semely knight riding against them / and all in
white / A said Frol yonder knight Iusted late with me and smote me down /
therefore I will Just with him / ye shall not do so said sire Lamorak by my
counceil / and ye will tell me your quarrel whether ye Iusted at his request /
or he at yours / Nay said sir Frol / I Iusted with him at my request / Sir said
Lamorak / then will I cou^ceile you dele no more with him / for me seems by
his countenance he should be a noble knight / and no Iaper / for me thinks /
he should be of the table round / therefore I will not ^^are said sir Frol / and
then he cried and said / sir knyt mak^ the ready to Just / That needs not
said the white knight / For I have no lust to Just with the / but yet they
feutryd their speres / and the white knight ouerthrewe sire Frol / and then
he rode his way a soft paas / Then sir Lamorak rode after him / and praid
him to tell him his name / for me seems ye should be of the felauship of the
round table / Upon a covenant said ^e I will tell you my name / so that ye
will not discover my name / and also that ye will tell me yours / Then
said he my name is sir Lamorak de galys / And my name is sir Lancelot du lake
/ then they put up their suerdes / and kyssed hertely to gyders / and eyder
made great Joy of other / Sir said sir Lamorak and hit please you I will do
you seruyse / God defend said Lancelot that any of so noble a blood as ye be
should do me seruyse / Then he said more I am in a quest that I must do my
self alone / Now god speed you said sir Lamorak / and so they departed / Then
sir Lamorak came to sir Frol and horsed him again / what knight is that said
sir Frol / sir he said it is not for you to know nor it is no point of my
charge / ye are the more vncurteis said sire Frol / and therefore I will
depart fro you / ye may do as ye list said sir Lamorak / and yet by my

Then within two or three days sir Lamorak fond a knight at a well slepynge
/ and his lady sat with him and waked / Right so came sir Gawayne and took the
knights lady / and set her up behind his squire / So sire Lamorak rode
after sire Gawayne / and said sire Gawayne / torn again / And then said sir
Gawayne what will ye do with me / for I am neuewe unto king Arthur / sire said
he for that cause I will spare you / else that lady should abide with me / or else
ye should just with me / Then sire Gawayne turned him and ran to him that
ought the lady with his spear / but the knight with pure might smote down sire
Gawayne / and took his lady with him / All this sir Lamorak saw and said to
him self / but I revenge my felawe / he will say of me dishonor in king
Arthurs court / Then sire Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to Just
/ Sir said he I am ready / and there they came to gyders with all their might /
and there sir Lamorak smote the knight thorou both sides / that he fylle to the
earth deed / then that lady rode to that knights brother that hight
Belliau^ce le orgulus / that duelled fast there by / and then she told him how
his brother was slain / Allas said he I will be reuengyd / and so he horsed
him / and armed him / and within a while he ouertook sire Lamorak / and badde
him torn and leave that lady / for thou and I must play a new play / for
thou have slain my brother sire Froll that was a better knight than ever were
thou / It might well be said sir Lamorak / but this day in the field I was
found the better / So they rode to gyder / and unhorsed other / and turned
their sheldes / and drew their swerdes / and fought myghtely as noble
knights preued by the space of two hours / So then sir Bellyaunce prayed
him to tell him his name / Sir said he my name is sire Lamorak de galys / A
said sir Bellyaunce / thou art the man in the world that I most hate / for I
slew my sons for thy sake / where I saved thy life / and now thou have slain
my brother sir Frol / Allas how should I be acoorded with the / therefore defend

well me ought to know you / for ye are the man that most have done for me /
And there with all sire Lamorak knelyd down / and bisought him of grace /
Arise said sir Bellyaunce / or else there as thou knelest I shall slay the /
That shall not need said sire Lamorak / for I will yield me unto you / not for
fere of you / nor for your strength / but your goodenes makes me full both to
have adoo with you / wherefore I require you for gods sake / and for the
honor of knygthode forgive me all that I have offended unto you / Allas said
Belleaunce leave thy knelynge or else I shall slay the without mercy / Then
they yede again unto batail / and either wounded other that all the ground was
blody there as they fought / And at the last Belleaunce withdrewe him abak
and set him down softely upon a lytil hylle / for he was so faynte for
bledyng that he might not stand / Then sir lamorak threw his shield upon
his bak / and asked him what chere / well said sir Belliaunce / A sir yet shall

Lamorak thou art a fool / for and I had had the at such advantage as thou

that I must needs forgive the mine euylle will / And then sire Lamorak knelyd
adoune / and unlaced first his vmberere / and then his own / and then
either kyssed other with weeping teres / Then sire Lamerak led sir
Belliau^ce to an Abbay fast by / and there sire Lamorak would not depart from
Bellyaunce till he was hole / And then they swear to gyders that none of hem
should never fight against other / So sire Lamorak departed and went to the
court of king Arthur /

Here leave we of sire Lamorak and of sir Tristram
And here begins the historye of La cote male tail
Capitulum primum
AT the Court of king Arthur there came a young man and bygly made / and he
was rychely bysene / and he desired to be made knight of the king but his over
garment sat ouerthwartly / how be hit / hit was rich clothe of gold / What is
your name said king Arthur / Sire said he / my name is Breunor le noyre / and
within short space ye shall know that I am of good kyn / It may well be said
sir kay the Seneschal / but in mockage ye shall be called la cote male tail /
that is as much to say the evil shapen cote / Hit is a great thing that thou
ask said the king / And for what cause werest thou that rich cote / tell
me / for I can well think for sum cause hit is / Sire he ansuerd I had a
fader a noble knight / And as he rode on hunting upon a day hit happed him to
leye him down to sleep / And there came a knight that had been long his enemy
/ And when he saw he was fast on sleep / he all to hew him / And this same
cote had my fader on the same time / and that makes this cote to sytte so
evil upon me / for the strokes ben on hit as I fond hit / and neu^r shall be
amendyd for me / Thus to have my faders death in remembrance I were this cote
till I be reuengyd / and by cause ye are called the most noblest king of the
world I come to you that ye should make me knight / Sir said sir Lamorak and sir
Gaherys / hit were well done to make him knight / for him besemeth well of
person / and of countenance / that he shall preue a good man and a good
knight / and a mighty / for sire and ye be remembryd even such one was sire
lancelot du lake / when he came first in to this Court / and full few of
us knew from whens he came / and now is he preued the man of most worship in
the world / and all your court and all your Round table is by sire lancelot
worshipped and amended more than by any knight now living / that is truth
said the king / and to morou at your request I shall make him knight So on
the morou there was an heart founden / and thither rode king Arthur with a
company of his knights to slay the heart / And this young man that sire kay
named la cote male tail was there left behynd with Queen Gueneuer / and by
sodeyne adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a strong Toure of stone
and it happend that he at that time brake loos / and came hurlynge before the
Queen and her knights And when the Queen saw the lion / she cried and
fled / and praide her knights to rescowe her / And there was none of hem
all but twelve that abode / and all the other fled / Then said La cote
male tail Now I see well that all coward knights ben not deed / and there
with all he drew his swerd / and dressid him before the lion / And that lion
gaped wide and came upon him raumppynge to have slain him / And he then
smote him in the mids of the head such a mighty stroke / that it clafe his
head in sonder / and dasshed to the earth / Then was hit told the Queen how
the young man that sire kay named by scorn La cote male tail had slain the
lion / With that the king came home And when the Queen told him of that
adventure / he was well pleased / and said / upon pain of mine head he shall
preue a noble man and a feythful Knight and true of his promise / then the
king forth with all made him knight / Now sire said this young knight I require
you and all the knights of your court / that ye call me by none other name
but la cote male tail / in so much that sir kay has so named me / so
will I be called / I assente me well thereto said the king

Then that same day there came a damoysel in to the court / and she brought
with her a great black shield / with a white hand in the mids holding a
swerd Other pyctour was there none in that shield / when king Arthur saw her /
he asked her from whens she came / and what she would / Sir she said I have
ryden long and many a day with this sheld many ways / and for this cause I am
come to your court / There Was a good knight that ought this sheld / and this
knight had undertake a great deed of arms to enchieue hit / and so it
mysfortuned him / another strong knight met with him by sodeyne adventure /
and there they fought long / and either wounded other passing sore / and they
were so weary / that they left that bataille even hand / So this knight that
ought this shield saw none other way but he must dye / and then he
commanded me to bear this shield to the Court of king Arthur / he requyrynge
and prayenge sum good knyt to take this shield / and that he would fulfylle
the quest that he was in / Now what say ye to this quest said king Arthur /
Is there any of you here that will take upon him to welde this shield / Then
was there not one that would speak one word / then sir kay took the shield in
his hands / Sire knyt said the damoysel what is your name / wete ye well said
he my name is sir kay the seneschal that wide where is known / Sire said that
damoysel lay down that shield / for wete ye well it falls not for you / for
he must be a better knyt than ye / that shall welde this shield / damoysel
said sir kay wete ye well I took this sheld in my hands by your leave / for to
behold it not to that intent / but goo where someuer thou will / for I will not
go with you / Then the damoysel stood stylle a great while / and byheld many
of tho knights / Then spak the knight La cote male tail / fair damoysel I
will take the shield and that adventure upon me / so I wist I should know /
wheder ward my journey might be / for by cause I was this day made knight I
would take this adventure upon me / what is your name fair young man said the
damoysel / My name is said he la cote male tail / well may thou be called so
said the damoysel / the knyt with the euylle shapen cote / but and thou be so
hardy to take upon the to bear that shield and to follow me / wete thou well /
thy skyn shall be as well hewn as thy cote / As for that said la cote male
tail when I am so hewn I will ask you no salve to hele me with all / And
forth with all there came in to the Court two squyers and brout him great horses
and his armor and his speres / and anon he was armed and took his leave / I
would not by my will said the king that ye took upon you that hard adventure /
sir said he / this adventure is mine / and the first that ever I took upon me /
and that will I follow what someuer come of me Then that damoysel departed /
and la cote male tail fast followed after / And within a while he ouertook the
damoysell and anon she myssaid him in the fowlest manner

Then sire kay ordained sir dagonet / king Arthurs fool to follow after la
cote male tail / and there sir kay ordained that sir Dagonet was horsed and
armed and bad him follow la cote male tail / and profer him to Just and so
he did / and when he saw la cote male tail he cried and badde him make him
ready to Just / So sir la cote male tail smote sir Dagonet over his horse
croupe / Then the damoysel mocked la cote male tail / and said fie for shame
/ now art thou shamed in Arthurs court / when they send a fool to have adoo
with the / and specially at thy first Iustes / thus she rode long and chyde /
And within a while there ^^ne sir Bleoberys the good knight / and there he
Iusted with la cote male tail / and there sire Bleoberys smote him so sore
that horse and all fell to the earth / Then la cote male tail arose up
lyghtely and dressid his sheld / and drew his suerd and would have done bataill
to the vtterau^ce / for he was wode ^^^oshe / Not so said Bleoberys de ganys /
as at this time I will not fight upon foo^^ / Then the damoysel Maledysau^t
(...) him in the foulest man^er / and badde him ^orne ayene coward / A damoysel
he said I pray you of mercy to myssa me no more / my gryef is enough though ye
give me no more / I call my self never the wers knight / when a marys sone
fails me / and also I dompte me never the wers knight for a fall of sir
Bleoberys / So thus he rode with her two days / and by fortune there came sir
Palomydes and encountered with him / and he in the same / wise served him as did
Bleoberys to fore hand / what do thou here in my fel^uship said the damoysel
maledysaunt / thou can not sytte no knight / nor withstand him one buffet /
but if hit were sir dagonet / A fair damoysel I am not the wers to take a fall
of sire Palamydes / and yet great disworship have I none / for neyder Bleoberys
not yet palamydes would not fight with me on foot / (...) for that said the
damoysel wete thou well they have desda^ne and scor^e to light of their horses
to fight with such a (...) knight as thou ^^te / So in the mean while there
came sir Mordred / sir Gawayns brother / and so he fell in the felauship with
the damoysel maledy^aunt / And then they came a^ore the castle Orgulous / and
there was such a customme that there might no knight come by that castle / but

Iusted with the formest / and that knight of the castle smote sire Mordred
down of his horse / and then la cote male tail Iusted with that other / and
either of hem smote other down horse and all to the earth / And when they
avoided their horses / then either of hem took others horses / And then la
cote male tail rode unto that knight that smote down sire Mordred and Iusted
with him / And there sire La cote male tail hurt and wounded him passing
sore and put him from his horse as he had been deed / So he turned unto him

the brydel under his feet / and so put him out of the gate / And when he had
so done / he hurled in among hem / and dressid his bak unto a ladies chamber
wall / thinking him self that he had lever dye there with worship / than to
abide the rebukes of the damoisel Maledysaunt / And in the mean time as he
stood and fout that lady whose was the chamber went out slyly at her posierne
/ and without the gates she fond la cote male tails horse and lightly she gate
him by the brydel / and teyed him to the posterne / And then she went unto
her chamber slyly ageyn for to behold hou that one knight fought against an
honderd knights / And when she had behold him long / she went to a wyndowe
behind his bak / and said thou knight thou fyghtest wonderly well / but for
all that at the last thou must needs dye / But and thou can thorou thy myty
prowess win unto yonder posterne / for there have I fastened thy horse to
abide the / but wete thou well thou must think on thy worship / and think not
to dye / for thou maiste not win unto that posterne without thou do nobly
and myghtly / when la cote male tail herd her say so / he gryped his swerd in
his hands and putt his sheld fair before him / and thorou the thyckest prees
he thrulled thorou them / And when he came to the posterne / he fond there ready
four knights / and at two the first strokes he slew two of the knights / and
the other fled / and so he wanne his horse and rode from them / and all as
it was it was reherced in king Arthurs court / hou he slew twelve knights
within the castle Orgulous / and so he rode on his way / And in the mean
while the damoysel said to sir Mordred I wene my foolysshe knyt be outher slain
or taken prisoner / then were they ware where he came rydyng / And when he
was come to them / he told all how he had spedde / and escaped in despyte of
them all / and sum of the best of hem will tell no tales / Thou lie
falsely said the damoysel / that dare I make good / but as a fool and a
dastard to all knyghthode / they have let the pass / that may ye preue said
La cote male tail / with that she sent a currour of hers that rode alweye
with her for to know the truth of this deed / and so he rode thydder
lightly / and asked how and in what manner that la cote male tail was escaped
out of the castle / Then all the knights cursyd him and said that he was a
fend and no man / For he has slain here twelve of our best knights / and
we wend unto this day that hit had been to much for sir lau^celot du lake or
for sire Tristram de lyones / And in despyte of us all he is departed from us
and maulgre our hedes / With this ansuer the currour departed and came to
Maledysaunt his lady / and told her all how sir la cote male tail had spedde
at the castle Orgulous / Then she smote down her h^ed / and said little / By
my head said sir Mordred to the damoysel ye are gretely to blame so to rebuke
him / for I warn you plainly he is a good knight / and I doubt not / but he
shall preue a noble knight / but as yet he may not yet sytt sure on horsbak /
for he that shall be a good horsman / hit must come of usage and excercyse /
But when he comes to the strokes of his swerd / he is then noble and mighty
/ and that saw sire Bleoberys and sir Palamydes / for wete ye well they are
wyly men of arms / and anon they know when they see a young knight by his
rydyng / how they are sure to give him a fall from his horse or a great buffet /
But for the most party they will not light on foot with young knights /
For they are wight and strongly armed / For in like wise sir lancelot du lake
when he was first made knight / he was often put to the werse upon horsbak
/ but ever upon foot he recouerd his renomme / and slew and defoyled many
knights of the round table / And therefore the rebukes that sir Lancelot did
unto many knights causes them that be men of prowess to beware / for often I
have seen the old preued knights rebuked and slain by them that were but
young begynners / Thus they rode sure talking by the way to gyders / Here leave
we of a while of this tale and speak we of sire Lancelot du lake /

THat when he was come to the court of king Arthur then herd he tell of
the young knight la cote male tail how he slew the lion / and how he took
upon him the adventure of the black shield / the which was named at that
time the hardyest adventure of the world / So god me save said sir Lau^celot
unto many of his felawes / it was shame to all the noble knights to suffer
such a young knight to take such adventure upon him for his destructyon /
for I will that ye wete said sire lancelot / that that damoysel maledysaunt
has born that shield many a day for to seche the most proved knights / and
that was she that Breunys saunce pity took that sheld from her / and after
Tristram de lyones rescowed that shield from him / and gaf it to the damoysell
again A lytil before that time that sir Tristram fought with my neuewe sire
Blamore de Ganys for a quarrel that was betwixe the king of Irland and him /
Then many knights were sorry that sir La cote male tail was gone forth to
that adventure / Truly said sir lancelot I cast me to ride after him / and
within seven days sir lancelot ouertook la cote male tail / And then he
salewed him / and the damoysel maledysaunt / And when sir Mordred saw sir
lau^celot / then he left their felauship / and so sir lancelot rode with
hem al a day / and ever that damoysel rebuked la cote male tail / and then
sire lancelot ansuerd for him / then she left of / and rebuked sir
lancelot / So this mean time sire Tristram sent by a damoysel a letter unto
sire lancelot excusing him of the wedding of Isoud le blaunche maynys / and
said in the letter as he was a true knyt / he had never adoo flesshly with
Isoud la blaunche maynys / and passing curtoisly and gentyly sir tristram
wrote unto sire lancelot / ever bysechyng him to be his good friend / and unto
la beale Isoud of Cornewaile / and that sire Lancelot would excuse him if that
ever he saw her / And within short time by the grace of god said sir Tristram
that he would speak with la Brale Isoud and with him right hastely^ / Then
sire Lancelot departed from the damoysel / and from sir la cote male tail for
to ouersee that letter / and to write another letter unto sire Tristram de
lyones / and in the mean while la cote male tail roode with the damoysel
until they came to a castle that hight Pendragon / and there were six knights
stood before him / and one of hem proffered to Just with la cote male tail /
And there la cote male tail smote him over his horse croupe / And then the
five knights set upon him all at ones with their speres / and the^^ they
smote la cote male tail doun^ horse and man / And then they a light suddenly /
and set their hands upon him all attones / and took him prisoner / and so
led him unto the castle / and kept him as prisoner / And on the morn sir
Lancelot arose and delyuerd the damoysel with letters unto sir Tristram / and
then he took his way after la cote male tail / and by the way^ upon a bridge
there was a knight proffered sire Lancelot to Just / and sire Lancelot smote
him down / and then they fought upon foot a noble batail to gyders and a
mighty / and at the last sire Lancelot smote him down grouelynge upon his
hands and his knees / And then that knight yielded him / and sire lancelot
received him fair / Sir said the knight I require the tell me your name / for
much my heart yeueth unto you / Nay said sire Lancelot as at this time I will
not tell you my name / onles then that ye tell me your name / Certainly
said the knight my name is sir Nerouens that was made knight of my lord sir
Lancelot du lake / A Newuens de lyle said sire Lancelot I am right glad
that ye ar proved a good knight / for now wete ye well my name is sir Lancelot
du lake / Allas said sire Nerouens de lyle what have I done / and there with all
flatlyng ^e fell to his feet / and would have kyst them / but sir Lancelot
would not let him / and then either made great joy of other / And then
sire Nerouens told sir Lancelot that he should not goo by the castle of
Pendragon / for there is a lord mighty knight / and many knights with him /
and this night I herd say that they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode
with a damoysel / and they say he is a knight of the round table

A Said sir Lancelot that knight is my felawe / and him shall I rescowe or
else I shall ^ese my life therefore And there with all he rode fast till he came
before the Castle of Pendragon / and anon there with all there came vj
knights / and all made hem ready to set upon sire Lancelot at ones / then
sire Lau^celot feutryd his spear / and smote the formest that he brake his bak
in sonder / and three of them hytte and three failed / And then sire lancelot
past thorou them / and lightly he turned in again / and smote another knight
/ thorugh the breast and thorou out the bak more than an ell / and there with
all his spear brak / So then all the remenaunt of the four knights drew
their swerdes and lasshed at sire Lancelot / And at every stroke sire
lancelot bestowed so his strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided
their sadel^ passing sore wounded / and forth with all he rode hurlynge in
to that castle / And anon the lord of the castle that was that time cleped sir
Bryan de les yles the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto king arthur
/ within a while he was armed and upon horsbak / And then they feutryd their
speres and hurled to gyders so strongly that both their horses rasshed to
the earth / And then they avoided their sadels / and dressid their sheldes
and drew their swerdes and flange to gyders as wood men / and there were many
strokes yeuen in a while / at the last sir lancelot gaf to sir Bryan such a
buffet that he kneled upon his knees / and then sir lancelot rasshed upon
him / and with great force he pulled of his helm / and when sire Bryan saw
that he should be slain he yielded him and put him in his mercy and in his grace
/ Then sire lancelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had
within his castle / and therein sir lau^celot fond of arthurs knights thyrtty
/ and / xl / ladies / and so he delyuerd hem / and then he rode his way /
and anon as la cote male tail was delyuerd he gat his horse and his harneis /
and his damoysel Maledysaunt / the mean while sire Neroueus that sir Lancelot
had foughten with all before at the bridge / he sent a damoysel after sir
Lancelot to wete hou he spedde at the Castle of Pendragon / And then they
within the castle merueylled what knight he was when sir Bryan and his knights
delyuerd all tho prisoners / have ye no merueille said the damoysel / for the
best knight in this world was here / and did this journey / and wete ye well
she said it was sire launcelott Then was sir Bryan full glad and so was his
lady / and all his knights / that such a man should win them / And when the
damoysel and la cote male tail understood that it was sir Lancelot du lake
that had ryden with them in felauship / And that she remembryd her hou she had
rebuked him and called him coward / then was she passing heavy

So then they took their horses and rode forth a pas after sire Lancelot /
And within two mile they over took him / and salewed him / and thanked him /
and the damoysel cried sir Lancelot mercy of her evil deed / and saying /
for now I know the flower of all knyghthode is departed even bitwene sire
Tristram and you / For god knows said the damoysel that I have sought you my
lord sir Lancelot and sir Tristram long / and now I thank god I have met
with you / and ones at Camelot I met with sir Tristram / and there he rescowed
this blak shield with the white hand holding a naked swerd / that sir Bruyns
saunce pity had taken from me / Now fair damoysel said sir Lancelot who told
you my name / Sire said she / there came a damoysell from a knight that ye
fought with all at the bridge / and she told me your name was sir Lancelot du
lake / blame have she then said sire Lancelot / but her lord sire Neroueus
has told her / But damoysel said sire Lancelot upon this covenant I will
ride with you / so that ye will not rebuke this knight sir La cote male tail
no more / for he is a good knight and I doubt not he shall preue a noble
knight / and for his sake and pity that he should not be destroyed / I followed
him to socoure him in this great need / A / Ihesu thank you said the damoysel
/ for now I will say unto you and to him both / I rebuked him never for no hate
that I hated him / but for great love that I had to him / For ever I supoosed
that he had been to young and to tendyr to take upon him these adventures / And
therefore by my will I would have driven him aweye for Ialousy that I had of his
life / for it may be no young knights deed that shall enchyeue this adventure
to the end / Perdieu said sire Launucelot hit is well said / and where ye are
called the damoysel Maledysaunt I will call you the damoysel Bien pensaunt /
and so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the Bordoure of the
country of Surluse / and there they fond a fair vyllage with a strong bridge
like a fortress / And when sir lancelot and they were at the bridge / there
starte forth before them of gentilmen and yomen many that said / Fair lords
ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress by cause of that black shield
that I see one of you bear / And therefore there shall not pass but one of you
at ones / therefore chese you which of you shall enter withynne this bridge
first / Then sir Lancelot proffered him self first to enter within this
bridge / Sir said La cote male tail I biseche you let me enter within this
fortress / and if I may speed well / I will send for you / and if it happend
that I be ^^ayn there it goth / And if so be that I am a prisoner taken /
then may ye rescowe me / I am loathe said sir lancelot to let you pass
this passage / Sire said la cote male tail I pray you let me put my body
in this adventure / Now goo your way said sire Lau^celot / and Ihesu be your
speed / So he entrid and anon there met with him two brethren / the one
hyte sir Plain de force and the other hight sir Plain de am^u^s And anon
they met with sir la cote male tail / and forste la cote male tail smote
down Plain de force / and after he smote down plain de amors / and then
they dressid them to their sheldes and swerdes / and badde la cote male tail
alyghte / and so he did / and there was dasshyng and foynyng with swerdes /
and so they began to assail full hard la cote male tail / and many great
wounds they gaf him upon his heed and upon his breast and upon his sholders /
And as he might ever among he gaf sad strokes again /

And then the two brethren traced and trauercyd for to be of both hands of
sire la cote male tail / but he by fine force and knyghtly prowess gate hem
before him / And then when he felt him self so wounded / then he doubled
his strokes / and gaf them so many wounds that he feld them to the earth /
and would have slain them had they not yielded them / And ryt so sire la cote
male tail took the best hor^ that there was of them three / and so rode forth
his way to the other fortress and bridge and there he met with the third
brother whoos name was sire Plenorius / a full noble knight / and there they
Iusted to gyder / and either smote other down horse and man to the earth / And
then they avoided their horses / and dressid their sheldes / and drew their
swerdes / and gaf many sad strokes / and one while the one knight was before on
the bridge / and an other while the other / And thus they fought two hours
and more / and never rested / And ever sire Lancelot and the damoysel ^eheld
them / Allas said the damoysel my knight fyghteth passing sore and over long
/ Now may ye see said sir Lancelot that he is a noble knight for to consydre
his first bataile / and his grievous wounds / And even forth with all so
wounded as he is / it is merueile that he may endure this long batail with
that good knight /

But sire lancelot would not suffer that / but bare him backer and backer / till

Melyagaunce / And then sire Lamorak asked him / why he loved Queen Gueneuer
as he did / for I was not fer from you when ye made your complaynte by the
chapel / Did ye so said sir Melyagau^ce / then will I abide by hit / I
love queen gueneuer what will ye with hit / I will preue and make good / that
she is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the world / As to that said sire
Lamorak I say nay thereto / for queen Morgause of Orkeney mother to sire Gawayne
and his mother is the fairest queen and lady that bears the life / That is not
so said sire Melyagaunce / and that will I preue with my hands upon thy body
/ Will ye so said sire Lamorak / and in a better quarrel keep I not to fight
/ Then they departed either from other in great wrath / And then they came
rydyng to gyder as hit had been thonder / and either smote other so sore that
their horses fell bakward to the earth / And then they avoided their horses
and dressid their sheldes / / and drew their swerdes And then they hurtled
to gyders as wild bores / and thus they fought a great while / For Melyagaunce
was a good man and of great might / but sire Lamorak was hard bygge for him /
and put him alweyes a bak / but either had wounded other sore / And as they
stood thus fighting / by fortune came sire Lancelot and sire Bleoberys
riding / And then sire lancelot rode betwixe them / and asked them / For
what cause they fought so to gyders / and ye are both knights of king
Arthur /

Capitulum xiiij
Sir said Melyagaunce I shall tell you for what cause we do this bataille /
I praised my lady Queen Gueneuer / and said she was the fairest lady of the
world / and sire Lamorak said nay thereto / For he said queen Morgause of
Orkeney was fayrer than she and more of beauty / A sire Lamorak why say thou
so / hit is not thy part to disprayse thy pryncesse that thou art under
their obeyssauncedn we all / and there with he alyghte on foot / and said
for this quarrel make the ready / For I will preue upon the / that Queen
Gueneuer is the fairest lady and most of bounte in the world Sire said sire
Lamorak I am loath to have adoo with you in this quarrel / For every man
thinks his own lady fairest / and though I praise the lady / that I love
most / ye should not be wroth / For though my lady queen Gueneuer be fairest
in your eye / wete ye well Queen Morgause of Orkeney is fairest in mine eye / and
so every knight thinks his own lady fairest / and wete ye well sir ye are
the man in the world except sire Tristram / that I am most lothest to have
adoo with all / But and ye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as
long as I may / Then spoke sire Bleoberys / and said / my lord sire
Lau^celot / I wyste you never so mysauysed as ye are now / For sire Lamorak
says you but reason and knyghtely / For I warn you I have a lady / and me
thinks that she is the fairest lady of the world / were this a great reason
that ye should he wroth with me for such langage / And well ye wot / that sir
Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know / and he has ought you and us ever
good will / and therefore I pray you be good friends / Then sire Lancelot
said unto sir lamerak / I pray you foryeue me mine euylle will / And if I was
mysauysed I will amend hit / Sire said sir Lamorak the amendys is soon made
betwixe you and me And so sir Lancelot and sire Bleoberys departed / and sir
Melyagaunce and sir Lamorak took their horses / and either departed from other
/ And within a while came king Arthur and met with sir Lamorak and Iusted
with him / and there he smote down sire Lamorack / and wounded him sore with a
spear / and so he rode from him / wherefore sir Lamorak was wroth that he would
not fight with him on foot / hou be it that sire Lamorak knew not king
Arthur

NOw leave we of this tale / and speak we of sire Tristram / that as he rode he
met with sir kay the seneschal and there sire kay / asked sir Tristram of
what country he was / he ansuerd that he was of the country of Cornewail Hit
may well be said sir kay / for yet herd I never that ever good knight came
out of Cornewaile / that is evil spoken said sir Tristram / but and it please
you to tell me your name I require you / Sire wete ye well said sire kay that
my name is sire kay the seneschal / Is that your name said sir Tristram / now
wete ye well that ye are named the shamefullest knight of your tongue that now
is living / how be it ye are called a good knight / but ye are called
unfortunate / and passing over thwarte of your tongue / And thus they rode to
gyders till they came to a bridge / And there was a knight would not let hem
pass / till one of hem Iusted with him / and so that knyt Iusted with sir kay /
and there that knight gaf sir kay / a fall / his name was sire Tor sire
Lamoraks half brother / and then they two rode to their lodging / And there
they fond sire Brandyles / and sir Tor came thither anon after /

And as they satte at souper these four knights / three of them spa^ all
shame by Cornysshe knights / Sir Tristram herd all that they said / and he
said but little / but he thought the more / but at that time he discouerd not
his name / Upon the morn sir Tristram took his horse / and abode them upon
their way / And there sire Brandyles proferd to Just with sir Tristram / and
sir Tristram smote him down horse and all to the earth / Then sire Tor le
fyse de vayshoure encountered with sire Tristram / and there sire Tristram smote
him down / and then he rode his way / and sir kay followed him / but he would

wete feign what is that knights name / Come on with me said sir kay / and we
shall pray him to tell us his name / So they rode to gyders / tylle they
came nyghe him / and then they were ware where he sat by a well / and had
put of his helm to drink at the well And when he saw them come / he
laced on his helm lightly / and took his horse / and proferd hem to Just / Nay

my name is sir Tristram de lyones neuewe unto king Mark of Cornewayle / In
good time said sire Brandyles / and well be ye fonden / and wete ye well that we
be right glad that we have fond you / and we be of a felauship that would be
ryt glad of your company / For ye are the knight in the world that the noble
felauship of the round table most desires to have the company of / God
thank them said sir Tristram of their great goodenes / but as yet I feale well
that I am vnabyl to be of their felauship / For I was never yet of such deeds
of worthynes to be in the company of such a felauship / A said sire kay and
ye be sire Tristram de lyones ye are the man called now most of prowess
except sir lancelot du lake / For he bears not the life christian ne hethen
that can find such another knight to speak of his prowess and of his hands
and his truth with all / For yet could there never creature say of him
dishonor and make hit good / Thus they talked a great while / and then they
departed either from other such weyes as hem seemed best /

NOw shall ye here what was the cause that king Arthur came in to the forest
perilous / that was in Northwalys by the means of a lady / her name was
Annowre / and this lady came to king Arthur at Cardyf / and she by fair
promise and fair bihestes maade king Arthur to ride with her in to that
forest perilous / and she was a great sorceresse / and many days she had
loved king arthur / and by cause she would have him to lie by her / she came in
to that Country / So when the king was gone with her / many of his
knights followed after king arthur / when they mist him / as sir lancelot
Braundyles and many other / and when she had brought him to her toure / she
desired him to lie by her and then the king remembryd him of his lady / and
would not lie by her for no craft that she could do / Then every day she
would make him ride in to that forest with his own knights to the intent to
have had king arthur slain / For when this lady annoure saw that she myt not
have him at her will / then she labored by falls means to have destroyed
king arthur and slain / Then the lady of the lake that was alwey frendely
to king arthur / she understood by her subtyl crafts that king arthur was
like to be destroyed And therefore this lady of the lake that hight Nyneue came
in to that forest to seek after sire Lancelot du lake / or sire Tristram for
to help king arthur / for as that same day this lady of the lake knew well
that king arthur should be slain / onles that he had help of one of these
two knytes / and thus she rode up and done till she met with sire Tristram /
and anon as she saw him / she knew him / O my lord sir Tristram she said
well be ye met / and blessid be the time that I have met with you / for
this same day / and within these two hours shall be done the foulest deed
that ever was done in this land O fair damoysel said sir Tristram may I amend
hit / Come on with me she said and that in all the haste ye may / for ye shall
see the most worshipfullest knyt of the world hard bestad Then said sire
Tristram I am ready to help such a noble man / he is neither better ne were
said the lady of the lake but the noble king Arthur him self / God defense
said sir Trystram that ever he should be in such distress / Then they rode
to gyders a great pas until they came to a little turret a castle / and
underneath that c^stel they saw a knight standing upon foot fighting with
two knights / And so sir Tristram biheld them / and at the last the two
knights smote down the one knight / and that one of hem unlaced his helm to
have slain him / And the lady Annoure gat king Arthurs suer^ in her hand to
have stryken of his head / And there with all came sire Tristram with all his

Tristram smote the one of the knights thorou the body that he fell deed / and
then he rasshed to the other / and smote his bak in sonder / and in the mean
while the lady of the lake cried to king Arthur let not that falls lady escape
/ Then king Arthur ouertoke her / and with the same swerd he smote of her
heed / and the lady of the lake took up her heed and henge hit up by the heir
of her sadel bow / And then sir Tristram horsed king Arthur / and rode forth
with him / but he charged the lady of the lake not to discover his name as at
that time / when the king was horsed / he thanked hertely sire Tristram / and
desired to wete his name / but he would not tell him / but that he was a pour
knight auenturous / and so he bare king Arthur felauship till he met with
sum of his knights / And within a while he met with sir Ector de marys /
and he knew not king Arthur nor sir Tristram / and he desired to Just with
one of hem / Then sire Tristram rode unto sir Ector / and smote him from his
horse / And when he had done so / he came again to the king / and said my
lord yonder is one of your knights / he may bear you felauship / and another
day that deed that I have done for you I trust to god ye shall understand
that I would do you seruyse / Allas said king Arthur let me wete what ye are /

Then sir Tristram dredde sore lest he were discouerd unto the king that he
was there / wherefore he drew him to the strength of the Toure / and armed him
in such armor as he had for to fight with hem that would with stand him /
And so when sire Tristram saw / there was no resystence against him / he
sent Gouernaile for his horse and his spear / and knyghtely he rode forth out
of the castle openly that was called the castle of Tyntagil / And even at
gate he met with Gyngalyn sir Gawayns sone / And anon sir Gyngalyn put his
spear in hi^s reyste / and ran upon ^ire Trystram and brake his spear / and
sire Tristram at that time had but a swerd / and gaf him such a buffet upon

when king Mark wist that it was sir Gyngalyn / he well comed him / and gaf
him an horse / and asked him what knight hit was that had encou^tred with / him
/ Sir said sir gyngalyn / I wot not what knyt he was / but well I wot that be

knight of his own that hyghte sir Fergus / And when he had met with him he
made great sorrow in so much that he fell down of his horse in a swoune / and
in such sorrow he was in three days and three nyghtes / Then at the last sir
Tristram sent unto the court by sir Fergus for to spear what tidings / And so
as he rode by the way he met with a damoysel that came from sir Palamydes to
know and s^ke how sir Tristram did / Then sir Fergus told her / how he was
al most out of his mind / Allas said the damoysel where shall I find him /
In such a place said sire Fergus Then sir Fergus fond Queen Isoud seek in
her bed / making the grettest dole that ever any erthely woman made And when
the damoysel fond sire Tristram / she made great dole by cause she myt not
amend him / for the more she made of him / the more was his pain / And at the
last sir Tristram took his horse and rode aweye from her / And then was it
three days or that she could find him / And then she brought him mete and
drink / but he would none / and then another time sir Tristram escaped awey
from the damoysel / and it happed him to ride by the same castle where sire
Palamydes and sir Tristram did bataille when la beale Isoud departed them / And
there by fortune the damoysel met with sire Tristram again making the
grettest dole that ever erthely creature made / and she yede to the lady of
that castle / and told her of the mysauenture of sire Tristram / allas said
the lady of that castle where is my lord sir tristram / Right here by your
castle said the damoysel / In good time said the lady / is ^e so nyghe me /
he shall have mete and drink of the best / and an harp I have of his / where
upon he taught me / For of goodely harpynge he bears the pride in the world /
So this lady and damoisel brought him mete and drink / but he ete little thereof
/ Then upon a night he put his horse from him / And then he unlaced his
armor / and then sir Tristram would go in to the wilderness and brast down
the trees and bows / and otherwhyle when he fond the harp that the lady sent
him / then would he harp and play thereupon / and weep to gyders / and
sometime when sire Tristram was in the wood that the lady wist not where he was
/ then would she sytte her down and play upon that harp / Then would sire
Tristram come to that harp / and harken there to / and sometime he would harp him
self Thus (...) there endured a quarter of a year / then at the last he ran
his way / and she wiste not where he was become / And then was he naked and
waxed lene / and pour of flesh / and so he fell in the felauship of herd

and would never come in town / ne vyllage / The mean while the damoysel that
sire Palomydes sent to seek sir Tristram she yede unto sir Palomydes / and
told him all the meschyef that sir Tristram endured / Allas said sir Palomydes
hit is great pity that ever so noble a Knight should be so mescheued for the
love af a lady / But nevertheless I will goo and seek him / and comfort him
and I may Then a little before that time la Beale Isoud had commanded sir
Kehydius out of the Conutrey of Cornewaile / So sir Kehydius departed with a
dolorous heart / and by adventure he met with sir Palamydes / and they
enfelaushypped to gyder / and either complained to other of their ho^^ lou^
that they loved la beale Isoud / Now let us said sir Palomydes seek sire
tristram that loved her as well as we / and let us preue whether we may
recover him / So they rode in to that forest / and three days and three nyghtes
they would never take their lodging but ever sought sir tristram / And upon a
time by adventure they met with King Mark that was ryden from his men al
alone / when they saw him / sire palomydes knew him / but sir Kehydins
knew him not / A falls king said sir Palomydes / it is pity thou have thy life
/ For thou art a destroyer of all worshipful Knights / and by thy meschyef
and thy vengeance thou have destroyed that most noble Knight sire tristram
de lyones / And therefore defend the said sir Palomydes / for thou shall dye
this day / that were shame said King Mark / for ye two are armed and I am
unarmed / As for that said sir Palomydes I shall find a remedy therefore /
here is a Knyt with me / and thou shall have his harneis / Nay said king Mark I
will not have adoo with you for cause have ye none to me / For all the
mysease that sir tristram has / was for a letter that he fond / for as to me I
did to him no displeasyre / and god knows I am full sorry for his disease and
malady / So when the king had thus xcused him / they were friends / and king
Mark would have had them unto tyntagil / but sir Palomydes would not but turned
unto the Realm of Logrys / and sir kehydius said that he would goo in to
Bretayn / Now torn we unto sir Dagonet ayene that when he and his squyers
were upon horsbak / he demyd that the sheepherdes had sent that fool to array
hem so / by cause that they laughed at hem / and so they rode unto the kepers
of beestes and all to beat them / Sir tristram saw them beat that were wont
to give him mete and drink / then he ran thither / and gat sir Dagonet by the
head / and gaf him such a fall to the earth / that he brysed him sore so that
he lay stylle / And then he wrast his swe^rd out of his hand / And there with

And so sir Tristram took his way with that swerd in his hand rennynge as he
had been wild wood / Then sir Dagonet rode to king Mark and told him hou
he had spedde in that forest / And therefore said sir Dagonet / Beware king
Mark that thou come not about that well / in the forest / For there is a
fool naked / and that fool and I fool met to gyders / and he had almost
slain me / A said king Mark / that is sir Matto le breune / that fell out of

and there would have stryken of his head / Then the herd men said unto sire

there shall no knight be herberowed but if he Just with two knights / and
if he be but one knight / he must Just with two / And as ye be therein soon
shall ye be matched / There is shrewde herberowe said sire Dynadan / lodge
where ye will / for I will not lodge there / Fie for shame said sir Tristram
are ye not a knight of the table round / wherefore ye may not with your worship
refuse your lodging / Not so said the herd men / for and ye be beten / and
have the wers ye shall not be lodged there / and if ye beat them ye shall be
well herberowed A said sir Dynadan they are two sure knights / Then sire
Dynadan would not lodge there in no manner / but as sire Tristram required him
of his knygthode / and so they rode thither / and to make short tale sir
Tristram and sir Dynadan smote hem down both / and so they entered in to the
castle and had good chere / as they could think or deuyse / And when they
were unarmed and thought to be merry and in good rest / there came in at the

And sir Gaherys encountered with sire Tristram / and sir Gaherys had a fall /
and sir Palamydes encountered with sir Dynadan / and sir Dynadan had a fall /
then was hit fall for fall / So then must they fight on foot / that
would not sir Dynadan / for he was so sore brysed of the fall that sire
Palomydes gaf him / Then sir Tristram unlaced sire Dynadans helm / and praid
him to help him / I will not said sir Dynadan for I am sore wounded of the
thyrtty knights that we had but late agoo to do with all But ye fare said
sire Dynadan unto sir Tristram as a mad man and as a man yt is out of his
mind yt would cast him self awey and I may curse the time that ever I saw you
/ For in all the world are not two such knights that been so wode as is sire
lancelot and ye sir Tristram / for ones I fell in the felauship of sir
lancelot as I have done now with you and he set me a work that a quarter of a
year I kept my bed / Ihesu defend me said sir Dynadan from such two
knights / and specially from your felauship / Then said sire Tristram I will
fight with hem both / Then sir Tristram badde hem come forth both / for I
will fight with you / then sir Palomydes and sir Gaherys dressid them / and
smote at hem both / then Dynadan smote at sir Gaherys a stroke or two / and
turned from him / nay said sir Palomydes / it is to much shame for us two
knights to fight with one / And then he did bid sir Gaherys stand a side
with that knight that has no list to fight / Then they rode to gyders and
fought long / and attelast sir Tristram doubled his strokes / and drofe sire
Palomydes a bak / more than three strydes / And then by one assente sire
Gaherys and sir Dynadan went betwixe them / and departed them in sonder / And
then by assent of sir Tristram they would have lodged to gyders / But sire
Dynadan would not lodge in that castle / And then he cursed the time that ever
he came in their feauship / and so he took his horse / and his harneis / and
departed / then sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lene him a
man to bring him to a lodging / and so they did / and ouertoke sir Dynadan /
and rode to their lodging two mile thens with a good man in a pryory / and
there they were well at ease / And that same night sir Bors and sire Bleoberys

But anon as the noble Knight sire lancelot herd of the shield of Cornewayle
then wist he well that hy^ was sire Tristram that fought with his enemies /
And then sire Lancelot praised sire Tristram / and called him the man of

Pellinore / and he desired to wete the name of sire Tristram / but in no wise
he could not / and so sir Tristram departed and left sir Dynadan in the pryory
/ for he was so weary and so sore brysed that he might not ride / Then this
knight sire Pellinore said to sire Dynadan / sythen that ye will not tell me
that knights name I will ride after him / and make him to tell me his name /
or he shall dye therefore / Beware sir knight said sir Dynadan / for and ye
follow him / ye shall repent hit / So that knight sire Pellinore rode after
sire Tristram and required him of Iustes / then si^ Tristram smote him down

required sir Tristram to Just / and sire Tristram in a manner refused him / by

then that knight held up his hands and thanked god of his coming home /
and there sir Pellounes told sir Tristram that in two years he had not seen his
sone sir Persydes / Sir said sir Tristram I know your sone well enough for a

good knights to withstand our enemies / So they armed them and took their
horses and great speres / and thither they went there as many knytes assayed hem
self before the turnement And anon sir Palomydes saw sir Persydes / and

wroth out of mesure / and sore ashamed of that fall / Then sire Tristram
sent unto sir Palomydes by Gouernaile and prayed him to Just with him at his
request Nay said sire Palomydes as at this time I will not Just with that
knight / for I know him better than he weneth / And if he be wroth / he may

a man never so good yet may he have a fall / and he was never so wise but
he might be ouersene / and he rydeth well that never fylle / So sire Tristram
was passing wroth and said to sire Persydes and to sire Dynadan I will
revenge me / Right so as they stood talkyng there / there came by sir
Tristram a lykely knight rydyng passing soberly and heuyly with a blak shield
/ what knight is that said sir Tristram unto sir Persydes / I know him well
said sir Persydes / for his name is sire Bryaunt of Northwalys / so he paste
on among other knights of Northwalys / And there came in sire lancelot du
lake with a sheld of the arms of Cornewaile / and he sent a squire unto sir
Bryaunt / and required him to Just with him / well said sir Bryaunt / sythen I
am required to Just / I will do what I may / and there sire lancelot smote
done sir Bryaunt from his horse a great fall / And then sir Tristram
merueiled what knight he was that bare the sheld of Cornewaile / what so ever
he be said sir Dynadan I warante you he is of King Bannys blood / the which
ben knights of the most noble prowess / in the world for to account so
many for so many / Then there came two knytes of Northgales / that one
hyghte Hew de la montayne / and the other sir Madok de la montayne / and they
chalengyd sire lancelot foot hot / Sir Lancelot not refusyng hem but made
him ready / with one spear he smote hem down both over their horse croupes /
and so sir lancelot rode his way / By the good lord said sire Tristram he is
a good knight that bears the shield of Cornewaile / and me seems he rydeth in
the best manner that ever I saw knight ride / Then the king of Northgalys
rode unto sire Palomydes / and praid him hertely for his sake to Just with
that knight that has done us of Northgalys despyte / Sir said sir Palomydes I
am full loathe to have adoo with that knight / and cause why is / for as to morn
the great turnement shall be / And therefore I will keep my self fresshe by my
will / Nay said the king of Northgalys I pray you require him of Iustes / sire
said sir palomydes I will Just at your request / and require that knight to

Iustes / Fair felawe seid sir lancelot / tell me thy lords name / Sire said
the squire my lords name is sir Palomydes the good knight / In good hour said
sir lancelot / for there is no knight that I saw this seven years that I had
lever adoo with all than with him / And so either knights made hem ready with
two great speres Nay said sir Dynadan ye shall see that sir Palomydes will
quyte him right well / hit may be so said sir Tristram / but I undertake that
knight with the sheld of Cornewayle shall give him a fall / I bileue hit not
said sir Dynadan / Right so they spored their horses / and feutryd their speres
/ and either hytte other / and sir palomydes brake a spear upon sire lancelot
/ and he sat and meued not / but sir Lancelot smote him so lightly that he
made his horse to avoid the sadel / and the stroke brake his shield and the
hauberke / and had he not fallen / he had be slain / how now said sir Tristram
/ I wiste well by the manner of their rydyng both that sire Palomydes should have
a fall / Right so sir lancelot rode his way and rode to a well to drink and
to repose him / and they of Northgalys aspyed him whyther he rode / and then
there followed him twelve knights for to have meschyeued him / for this cause
that upon the morn at the turnement of the castle of maidens that he should not
win the vyctory / So they came upon sir lancelot suddenly and uneath he
might put upon him his helm / and take his horse but they were in hands with
him / and then sir lancelot gat his spear and rode thorou them / and there
he slew a knight and brake his spear in his body / Then he drew his swerd
and smote upon the right hand and upon the lift hand so that within a few
strokes he had slain other three knights / and the remenaunt that abode he
wounded hem sore all that did abide / Thus sir lancelot escaped from his
enemies of Northwalys / and then sir lancelot rode his way till a friend and
lodged him till on the morn / for he would not the first day have adoo in the
turnement by cause of his great labor / And on the first day he was with king
Arthur there as he was set on hyhe upon a schaffold to discern who was best
worthy of his deeds / So sir lancelot was with king Arthur / and Iusted not

knights was wroth / and he horsed sire Bleoberys and sir gaherys again / and
there began a great meddle / and ever sir tristram held them passing short /
and ever sir Bleoberys was passing besy upon sire Tristram / and there came
sir Dynadan against sire Tristram / and sire Tristram gaf him such a buffet
that he swouned in his sadel / Then anon sir Dynadan came to sire Tristram /
and said sir I know the better than thowwenest / But here I promise the my
truth I will never come against the more / for I promise the that swerd of
thyn shall never come on mine helm / with that came sir Bleoberys / and sir
Tristram gaf him such a buffet that down he leyd his head / and then he
raught him so sore by the helm / that he pulled him under his horse feet / And
then king Arthur blewe to lodging / Then sire Tristram departed to his
pauelione / and sire Dynadan rode with him / and sire Persydes and king Arthur
then and the kings upon both parties merueylled what knight that was with
the blak shield / Many said their advise / and some knew him for sire Tristram
/ and held their pees and would naught say / So that first day king Arthur
and all the kings and lords that were Iuges gaf sir Tristram the price / hou
be hit they knew him not but named him the knight with the black sheld

Then upon the morn sire Palomydes returned from the king of Northgalys /
and rode to king Arthurs side where was king Carados and the king of Irland /
and sir launcelots kynne and sir Gawayns kynne / S^o sire palomydes sent the
damoysel unto sire Tristram that he sent to seek him when he was out of his
mind in the forest / and this damoysel asked sire Tristram / what he was / and
what was his name / As for that said sir Tristram tell sir Palomydes ye shall
not wete as at this time unto the time I have broken two speres upon him / But
let him wete thus much said sir Tristram / that I am the same knight that he
smote down in over euenyng at the turnement and tell him plainly / on what
party that sire Palomydes be / I will be of the contrary part Sire said the
damoysel ye shall understand that sir Palomydes will be on king Arthurs side
/ where the most noble knights of the world ben / In the name of god said sir
Tristram / then will I be with the king of Northgalys by cause sir
Palomydes will be on king Arthurs side / and else I would not but for his sake
/ So when king Arthur was come they blewe unto the field / and then there
began a great party / and so king Carados Iusted with the king of the
honderd knights / and there king Carados had a fall / then was there
hurlynge and rasshynge / and right so came in knights of king Arthurs / and
they bare on bak the king of Northgalys knights / Then sir Tristram came in
and began so roughly and so bygly that there was none might withstand him /
and thus sire Tristram dured long / And at the last sir Trystram fell among
the felauship of king Ban / and there fell upon him sir Bors de ganys / and
sir Ector de marys / and sire Blamor de ganys / and many other knights / And
then sir Tristram smote on the right hand and on the lift hand that all
lords and ladies spak of his noble deeds / But at the last sire Tristram should
have had the werse / had not the king with the honderd knights ben / And
then he came with his felauship and rescowed sir Tristram / and brought him
awey from tho knights that bare the sheldes of Cornewaile / and then sir
Tristram saw another felauship by them self / and there were a xl Knights to
gyder / and sir Kay the Sene^chal was there governor / Then sire Tristram
rode in amongst them / and there he smote down sir Kay from his horse / and
there he fared among tho Knights like a gray hound among conyes / Then s^re
lancelot fond a Knight that was sore wounded upon the head / Sir said sir
lancelot who wounded you so sore / Sire he said a Knight that bears a black
shield / and I may curse the time that ever I met with him for he is a devil
and no man So sire lancelot departed fro him / and thought to mete with sir
Tristram / and so he rode with his swerd drawn in his hand to seek sir
Tristram / and then he aspyed him how he hurled here and there / and at every
stroke sir Tristram well nygh smote down a knight / O mercy Ihesu said the
king sith the time I bare arms saw I never no knight do so merueillous deeds
of arms / And if I should set upon this knight said sir Lancelot to him self
I did shame to my self / and there with all sir lancelot put up his swerd / And
then the King with the C Knytes / and an honderd more of Northwalys set upon
the twenty of sir launcelots kyn / and they xx Knytes held them ever to gyder /
as wild swyne and none would fail other / and so when sir Tristram beheld the
noblesse of these xx Knights / he merueiled of their good deeds / for he saw
by their fare and by theil reule that they had lever deye than avoid the field
/ Now Ihesu said sire Tristram well may he be valyaunte and full of prowess
that has such a sort of noble Knights unto his kynne / and full like is he
to be a noble man that is their leder and governor / he mente hit by sir
Lancelot du Lake / So when sire Tristram had be holden them long / he thout
shame to see / ij / C knytes batteryng upon twenty knights / Then sire
Tristram rode unto the king with the honderd knights / and said sire leave
your fighting with tho twenty knights / for ye win no worship of them / ye
be so many / and they so few / And wete ye well they will not out of the
field I see by their chere and countenance / and worship get ye none and ye
slay them / therefore leave your fighting with them / for I to encreace my
worship / I will ride to the twenty knights and help them with all my might
and power / Nay said the king with the honderd knights / ye shall not do so /
Now I see your courage and curtosy / I will withdraw my knytes for your
pleasyr / for evermore a good knight will favor another / and like will
draw to like /

Then the king with the honderd knights withdrewe his knights / And all this
while and long tofore sir lancelot had watched upon sir Tristram with a very
purpos to have felaushipped with him / And then suddenly sir Tristram / sir
Dynadan / and Gouernaile his man rode their way in to the forest that no man
perceived where they went / So then king Arthur blewe unto lodging / and
gaf the king of Northgalys the price by cause sir Tristram was upon his side /
Then sir lancelot rod here and there so wood as lion that fauted his fylle
by cause he had lost sire Tristram / and so he returned unto king Arthur /
and then in all the field was a noise that with the wind hit might be herd
two mile thens / how the lords and ladies cried the knight with the blak
shield has won the field Allas said king Arthur where is that knight become
/ hit is shame to all tho in the field so to let him escape awey from you /
but with gentylnes and curtosy ye might have brought him unto me to the castle
of maidens Then the noble king Arthur went unto his knights and comforted
them in the best wise that he could / and said / my fair felawes be not
dysmayed / how be hit ye have lost the field this day and many were hurt and
sore wounded / and many were hole / My felawes said king Arthur look that ye
be of good chere / for to morn I will be in the feld with you and revenge you
of your enemies So that night King Arthur and his knights reposed them self
/ The damoysel that came from la Beale Isoud unto sir Tristram all the while
the turnement was adoynge she was with Queen Gueneuer / and ever the Queen
asked her for what cause she came in to that Countr^* Madame she ansuerd I come
for none other cause but from my lady la Beale Isoud to wete of your welfare /
F^r in no wise she would not tell the Queen that she came for sir Tristrams
sake / So this lady dame Brau^wayne took her leave of Queen Gueneuer / and she
rode after sir Tristram / And as she rode through the forest she herd a great
cry / then she commanded her squire to goo in to that forest to wete what
was that noise / and so he came to a well and there he fond a Knight bounden
till a tree cryeng as he had been wod^ and his horse and his harneis standing by
him / And when he aspyed the squire / there with he abraide / and brake him self
loos and took his swerd in his hand / and ran to have flayne that squire /
Then he took his horse and fled all that ever he might unto dame Brangwayne
/ and told her of his adventure / Then she rode unto sir Tristrams pauelione
/ and told sire Tristram what adventure she had fond in the forest / Allas
said sir Tristram upon my heed there is sum good Knight at meschyef /
Then sire Tristram took his horse and his swerd / and rode thither / there he
herd how the Knight complained unto him self and said / I woeful knight sire
palomydes what mysauenture befalls me / that thus am defoiled with falshede
and treason thorou sire Bors and sire Ector / Allas he said why live I so
long / And then he gat his swerd in his hands / and maade many strange
signs and tokens / and so thorou his ragynge he threw his swerd in to that
fontayne Then sir Palomydes wayled and wrange his hands / And at the last
for pure sorrow he ran in to that Fontayne over his belly / and sought after
his swerd / Then sir Tristram saw that and ran upon sir Palomydes / and
held him in his arms fast / what art thou said Palomydes that holds me so
/ I am a man of this forest that would the none harm / Allas said sire
Palomydes I may never win worship where sir Tristram is / For ever where he
is / and I be there then get I no worship / And if he be awey / for the
most party I have the gree / onles that sir Lancelot be there or sir Lamorak
/ Then sire Palomydes said ones in Irland sir Tristram put me to the werse
/ and another time in Cornewaile and in other places in this land what would ye
do said sire Tristram and ye had sir Tristram / I would fight with him said sir
Palomydes and ease my heart upon him / and yet to say the sothe sire Tristram
is the gentelyst knight in this world living / what will ye do said sir
Tristram will ye goo with me to your lodging / Nay said he I will goo to
the king with the honderd knights / for he rescowed me from sire Bors de
ganys / and sir Ector / and else had I ben slain traitourly / Sire Tristram
said him such kind words that sire Palomydes went with him to his lodging
/ Then Gouernaile went to fore / and charged dame Brangwayn to goo out of
the way to her lodging / and bydye sire Persydes that he make him no quarrels /
And so they rode to gyders till they came to sire Tristrams pauelione / and
there sire Palomydes had all the chere that might be had all that night / But
in no wise sire Palomydes myt not know what was sir Tristram / and so after
souper they yede to rest And sir Tristram for great travail slepte tylle it
was day / And sir Palomydes might not sleep for anguysshe / and in the
daunynge of the day he took his horse pryuely / and rode his way unto sir
Gaherys and unto sir Sagramour le desyrus / where they were in their pauelions
/ for they three were felawes at the beginning of the turnement / And then
upon the morn the king blewe unto the turnement upon the thyrdde day /

So the king of Northgalys and the king with the honderd knights they two
encountered with king carados and with the king of Irland / and there the king
with the honderd knights smote down king Carados / and the king of
Northgalys smote down the king of Irland / With that came in sir Palomydes /
and when he came he made great work / for by his endented shield he was well
known / So came in king Arthur / and did great deeds of arms to gyders /
and put the king of Northgalys and the king with the honderd knights to
the werse / With this came in sir Tristram with his black shield / And anon he
Iusted with sire palomydes / and there by fine force sir Tristram s^ote sire
palomydes over his horse croupe / Then king Arthur cried Knight with the
black shield make the ready to me / and in the same wise sir Tristram smote
king Arthur / And then by force of king Arthurs knights the king and sir
palomydes were horsed again / Then king Arthur with a great egre heart he
gate a spear in his hand / and thereupon the one side he smote sir Tristram over
his horse / Then foot hot sir Palomydes came upon sir Tristram as he was upon
foot to have over ryden him / Then sir Tristram was ware of him / and there
he stouped a side / and with great ire he gate him by the arm / and pulled him
down from his horse / Then sire palomydes lyghtely arose / and then they
dasshed to gyder myghtely with their swerdes / and many kings / Queen's and
lords stood and beheld them / And at the last sire Tristram smote sire
palomydes upon the helm three myty strokes / and at every stroke that he gaf
him he said have this for sire Tristrams sake / With that sire Palomydes fell
to the earth grouelynge / Then came the king with the honderd knights / and
brought sire Tristram an horse / and so was he horsed ageyn By then was sir
Palomydes horsed / and with great ire he Iusted upon sir Tristram with his
spear as hit was in the reyste and gaf him a great dasshe with his swerd /
Then sir Tristram avoided his spear / and gate him by the neck with his both
hands / and pulled him clean out of his sadel / and so he bare him before him
the length of ten speres / and then in the presence of hem al he let him
fall at his adventure / Then sire Tristram was ware of king Arthur / with a
naked suerd in his hand / and with his spear sir Tristram ran upon king
Arthur / and then king Arthur boldly abode him and with his swerd he smote
atwo his spear / and the^^ with all sire Tristram stonyed / and so king
Arthur gaf him three or four great strokes or he myt get out his swerd / and at
the last sir Tristram drew his swerd and assailed other passing hard / with
that the great prees departed / then sir Tristram rode here and there and did
his great pain that xj of the good knights of the blood of king Ban that was
of sire launcelots kyn / that day sire Tristram smote down / that all the
estates merueilled of his great deeds and all cried upon the knight with the
black sheld

Then this cry was so large / that sir lancelot herd it / And then he
gate a great spear in his hand / and came toward the cry / Then sir
lancelot cried / the knight with the blak shield make the ready to Just with

either abeyshed down their hedes / and came to gyder as thonder / and sire
Tristrams spear brake in pyeces / and sir lancelot by male fortune stroke sir
Tristram on the side a deep wounds nyghe to the death / But yet sir Tristram
avoided not his sadel / and so the spear brak / there with all sir tristram
that was wounded gate out his swerd / and he rasshed to sir lancelot / and
gaf him three great strokes upon the helm that the fire sprange there out /
and sir lancelot abeyshed his head ^owely toward his sadel bow / And there
with all sir tristram departed from the field / for he felt him so wounded
that he wend he should have dyed / and sir Dynadan aspyed him and followed him
in to the forest / Then sir lancelot abode and did many merueyllous deeds /
So when sire Tristram was departed by the forests side / he alyght and unlaced
his harneis and fress^ed his wou^d / then wend sir Dynodan that he should
have dyed / Nay nay said sire Tristram / Dynadan / never dread the / for I am
heart hole / and of this wound I shall soon be hole by the mercy of god / By
that sir Dynadan was ware where came palomydes riding streyghte upon them /
And then sire Tristram was ware that sire Palomydes came to have destroyed
him / and so sire Dynadan gaf him warnyng and said sire Tristram my lord ye
are so sore wounded that ye may not have adoo with him / therefore I will ride
against him and do to him what I may / And if I be slain ye may pray for
my soul and in the mean while ye may withdraw you and goo in to the castle
/ or in the foreste that he shall not mete with you / Sire Tristram smyled and
said I thank you sire Dynadan of your good will / but ye shall wete that I
am able to handle him / And then anon hastily he armed him and took his horse
/ and a great spear in his hand and said to sire Dynadan Adieu / and rode
toward sire Palamydes a soft paas

Then when sire Palomydes saw that / he made countenance to amend his
horse / but he did hit for this cause / For he abode sire Gaherys that came
after him / And when he was come he rode toward sire Tristram / Then sire
Tristram sent unto sir palomydes and required him to Just with him / And if
he smote down sir Palomydes / he would do no more to him / And if it so
happend that sire Palomydes smote down sir Tristram he badde him do his
vtteraunce / So they were accorded / then they met to gyders / and sire
Tristram smote down sir palomydes / that he had a grievous fall / so that he
lay stylle as he had been deed / And then sire Trystram ran upon sir
Gaherys / and he would not have Iusted But whether he would or not sire Tristram
smote him over his horse croupe that he lay stylle as though he had been deed /
And then sir Tristram rode his way and left sire Persydes squire within the
pauelions / and sire Tristram and sire Dynadan rode to an old knights place to
lodge them / And that old knight had five sons at the turnement / for whom
he prayed god hertely for their coming home / And so as the frensshe book says
they came home al / v / well beten / And when sir Tristram departed in to the
forest sir lau^celot held alwey ^he stoure like hard as a man araged that took
no heed to him self / and were ye well there was many a noble knight against
him / And when king Arthur saw sir Lancelot do so merueyllous deeds of
arms / he then armed him / and took his horse and his armor / and rode in to
the field to help sir lancelot / and so many knights came in with king
Arthur / and to make short tale in conclusion the king of Northgalys / and the
king of the honderd knights were put to the wers / and by cause sire
lancelot abode and was the last in the feld / the price was yeuen him / But
sir Lau^celot would neither for king / Queen ne knight have the price / but
where the cry was cried thorugh the field / sir lancelot sir lancelot has
won the field this day / sire Lancelot let make an other cry contrary sir
Tristram has won the feld / for he began first and last he has endured /
and so has he done the first day / the second and the third day /

Then all the estates and degrees hyhe and low said of sir lancelot great
worship / for the honor that he did unto sir Tristram / and for that honor
doing to sir Tristram he was at that time more preysed and renoumed than and he
had overthrown v C knights / and all the people holy for this gentylnes /
first the estates both hyhe and low / and after the comynalte cried at ones
sire Lancelot has won the field who so ever say nay / Then was sire
Lancelot wroth and ashamed / and so there with all he rode to king Arthur /
Allas said the king we are all dysmayed that sir Tristram is thus departed
from us / By god said king Arthur he is one of the noblest knytes that ever I
saw hold spear or swerd in hand / and the most curteyst knight in his
fyghtyng / for full hard I saw him said king Arthur when he smote sir
Palomydes upon the helm thryes / that he abashed his helm with his strokes /
and also he said / here is a stroke for sir Tristram / and thus thryes he said
/ Then king Arthur / sir lancelot / and sire Dodynas le saueage took their
horses to seek sir Tristram / and by the menes of sir Persydes / he had told
king Arthur where sir Tristram was in his pauelione / but when they came
there / sir Tristram and sir Dynadan were gone / then king Arthur and sir
lancelot were heny / and returned again to the castle of maidens making great
d^le for the hurt of sire Trystram / and his sodeyne departing / So god me
help said king Arthur I am more heavy that I can not mete with him / then for all the hurtes that all my knights have had at the turnement Right so came
sir Gaherys and told king Arthur how sir Tristram had smyten down sir
Palomydes / and it was at sir Palomydes own request / Allas said King Arthur
that was great dishonor to sire Palomydes in as much as sire Tristram was
sore wounded / and now may we all kings and knytes and men of worship say
that sire Tristram may be called a noble knight and one of the best Knights
that ever I saw the days of my life / For I will that ye al kings and
Knights know said King Arthur that I never saw Knight do so merueyllously
as he has done these three days / for he was the first that began and that
lengest* held on sauf this last day / And though he was hurt it was a manly
adventure of two noble Knights / and when two noble men encountre needs must
the one have the werse like as god will suffer at that time / As for me said sir
lancelot for all the lands that ever my fader left me I would not have hurt
sir Tristram and I had known him at that time / that I hurt him was for I saw
not his sheld / For and I had seen his black sheld / I would not have meddled
with him for many causes / for late he did as much for me as ever did Knight
and that is well known that he had adoo with thyrtty Knytes / and no help save
sir Dynadan / And one thing shall I promise said sir lancelot / sir
Palomydes shall repent it as in his unkindly delynge for to follow that
noble knight that I by myshap hurted thus / Sir lancelot said all the worship
that might be said by sir Tristram / Then king Arthur made a great feast to
all that would come / And thus we let pass King Arthur / and a lytyl we
will torn unto sir Palomydes that after he had a fall of sire Tristram / he
was nyghe hand araged out of his wit for despyte of sir Tristram And so he
followed him by adventure / And as he came by a river in his woodenes / he would
have made his horse to have lepte over / and the horse failed footynge / and
fell in the River / wherefore sire palomydes was adrad lest he should have been
drouned / and then he avoided his horse / and swamme to the land / and let
his horse goo down by adventure /

Capitulum xxxvj /
ANd when he came to the land he took of his harneis / and satte rorynge and
cryenge as a man out of his mind / Right so came a damoysel even by sir
Palomydes that was sent fro sir Gawayne and his brother unto sir mordred that
lay seek in the same place with that old knyt where sir Tristram was / For as
the Frensshe book says sir Persydes hurt so sir Mordred a ten days before /
and had not ben for the love of sir Gawayne and his brother / sir Persydes had
slain sir Mordred / and so this damoysel came by sir palomydes / and s^he and
he had langage to gyder / the which pleasyd neither of them / and so the
damoysel rode her Ways till she came to the old knights place / and there she
told that old knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that
ever she met with all / what bare he in his sheld said sir Tristram / hit was
endented with white and black said the damoysel / A said sir Tristram that was
sir palomydes / the good knight / For well I know him said sir Tristram for one
of the best knights living in this realm / Then that old knight took a
little hackney and rode for sire palomydes / and brought him unto his own
manoyr / and full well knew sire Tristram sir Palomydes / but he said but little
/ for at that time sir Tristram was walkyng upon his feet / and well amended of
his hurtes / and alweyes when sire Palomydes saw sir Tristram / he would behold
him full merueillously / And ever him s^med that he had seen him / Then would
he say unto sire Dynadan and ever I may mete with sire Tristram he shall not
escape mine hands / I merueile said sir Dynadan yt ye booste behind sir
Tristram / for it is but late that he was in your hands / and ye in his
hands / why would ye not hold him when ye had him / for I saw my self
twyes or thryes that ye gat but little worship of sir Tristram / then was sir
Palomydes ashamed / So leave we them a lytyl while in the old castle / with the
old knight sir Darras / Now shall we speak of King Arthur / that said to sir
Lancelot had not ye ben / we had not lost sire Tristram / for he was here
daily unto the time ye met with him / and in an euylle time said Arthur ye
encountered with him / My lord Arthur said Lancelot ye put upon me that I
should ben cause of his departycyon / god knows hit was ageynste my will /
But when men ben hot in deeds of arms often they hurt their friends as well as
their foes / And my lord said sir lancelot ye shall understand that sir
Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend for he has done for me more than
ever I did for him as yet / But then sir Lancelot made bring forth a book
and then sir lancelot said / here we are ten Knights that will swear upon a
book never to rest one night where we rest another this twelve month un till
that we find sir Tristram / And as for me said sire Lancelot I promise you
upon this book that and I may mete with him / outher with fayrenes or foulness
I shall bring him to this court / or else I shall dye therefore / And the
names of these ten knights that had undertake this quest were these
following / First was sir Lancelot / sir Ector de Marys / sir Bors de ganys
and Bleoberis and sire Blamor de ganys / and Lucan the botteler / sir Vwayne /
sir Galyhud / Lyonel and Galyodyn / So these x noble knights departed from
the court of king Arthur / and so they rode upon their quest to gyders until
they came to a cross where departed four ways / and there departed the
felauship in four to seek sir Tristram / And as sir lancelot rode by adventure
he met with dame Brangwayn that was sent in to that country to seek sir
Tristram / and she fled as fast as her palfrey might goo / So sire Lancelot
met with her and asked her why she fled / A fair knight said dame
Brangwayne I flee for dread of my life / for here follows me sir Breuse saunce
pity to slay me / Hold you nyghe me said sir lancelot / Then when sire
Lancelot saw sir Breuse saunce pity / sir lancelot cried unto him / and said
/ falls knight destroyer of ladies and damoysels / now thy last days be come /
when sire Breuse saunce pity saw sire launcelots sheld he knew hit well /
for at that time he bare not the arms of Cornewaile / but he bare his own
shield / And then sire Breuse fled / and sir Tristram followed after him / But
sir Breuse was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well flee /
and also abide when him list / And then sire lancelot returned unto dame
Brangwayne and she thanked him of his great labor /

NOw will we speak of sir Lucan the buttelere that by fortune he came rydyng
to the same place there as was sir Tristram / and in he came in none other
entente / but to ask herberowe / then the porter asked what was his name /
Tell your lord that my name is sir Lucan the botteler a knight of the round
table / So the porter went unto sire Darras lord of the place / and told him
who was there to ask herborou / Nay nay seid sir Daname that was neuewe to sir
Darras / say him that he shall not be lodged here / But let him wete that I
sir Daname will mete with him anon and bydde him make him ready / So sire Daname
came forth on horsbak / and there they met to gyders with speres / and sir
Lucan smote down sir Daname over his horse croupe / and then he fled in to
that place / and sir Lucan rode after him / and asked after him many times /
Then sir dynadan said to sire Tristram hit is shame to see the lords cosyn
of this place defoiled / Abide said sir Tristram and I shall redress it / and
in the mean while sir Dynadan was on horsbak and he Iustid with Lucan ye
botteler / and there sir lucan smote dynada^ thur the thyck of the thyghe / and
so he rode his way / and sire trisram was wroth that sir Dynadan was hurt /
and followed after and thought to avenge him / and within a while he ouertook
sir lucan / and had him torn / and so they met to gyders so that sire
Tristram hurt sir Lucan passing sore / and gaf him a fall / With that came
sire Vwayne a gentyl knyt And when he saw sire Lucan so hurt / he called
sire tristram to Just with him / Fair knight said sire Tristram tell me your
name I require you / Sire knight wete ye well my name is sire Vwayne le fyse de
roy Vreyne / A said sire Tristram by my will I would not have adoo with you at
no time / ye shall not so said sir Vwayne but ye shall have adoo with me /
And then sire Tristram saw none other boot but rode against him and
ouerthrewe sir Vwayn and hurt him in the side / and so he departed unto his
lodging again / And when sire Dynadan understood that sir Tristram had
hurt sir Lucan / he would have ryden after sir Lucan for to have slain him /
but sir Tristram would not suffer him / Then sir Vwayne let ordeyne an horse
lytter / and brought sir Lucan to the abbey of Ganys / and the castle there by
hight the castle of Ganys / of the which sir Bleoberys was lord / And at that
Castle sire lancelot promised all his felawes to mete in the quest of sir
Tristram / So when sir tristram was come to his lodgyng / there came a damoisel
yt told sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that turnement and two
grievously wounded that they were never like to help them self / And all this
was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield / and that was he that
bare the price / Then came there one and told sir Darras that the same knight
was within him that bare the black sheld / Then sir Darras yede unto sir
Tristrams chamber / and there he fond his sheld and showed it to the damoysel /
A sir said the damoysel that same is he / that slew your three sons / Then
without any taryenge sir Darras put sire Tristram and sire Palomydes and sir
Dynadan within a strong prison / and there sir Tristram was like to have dyed
of great sickness / and every day sir Palomydes would repreue sir Tristram of
old hate betwixe them / And ever sir Tristram spak fair and said little / But
when sir Palomydes saw the falling of sickness of sir Tristram then was he
heavy for him / and comforted him in all the best wise he could / And as the
Frensshe book says there came forty knights to sire Darras / that were of
his own kyn / and they would have slain sire Tristram and his two felawes /
but sire Darras would not suffer that but kept them in prison / and mete and
drink they had / So sire Tristram endured there great pain / for sickness
had undertake him / and that is the grettest pain a prisoner may have For
all the while a prisoner may have his health of body / he may endure under
^he mercy of god and in hope of good delyueraunce / But when sekenes touches
a prisoners bo^^ / then may a prisoner say al welthe is him be^afte / and
then he has cause to wayle and to weep / Ryt so did sire Tristram when

NOw will we speak and leave sir Tristram / sire Palomydes / and sir Dynadan in
prison / and speak we of other knights that sought after sire Tristram many
diverse parties of this land / and some yede in to Cornewaile / and by
adventure sir Gaheryse neuewe unto king Arthur came unto King Mark / and there
he was well received / and satte at king Marks own table and ete of his own
mess / Then king Mark asked sir Gaheryse what tidings there were in the
royalme of Logrys / Sire said sir Gaheryse the King regneth as a noble knight /
and now but late there was a great Iustes and turnement as ever I saw any in
the realm of Logrys / and the most noble knights were at that Iustes / But
there was one knight that did merueyllously three days / and he bare a black
shield / and of all knights that ever I saw he preued the best knyt / thrnne
said King mark that was sire lancelot or sire palomydes the paynym / Not so
said sir Gaherys / for both sire lancelot and sire Palomydes were on the
contrary party against the Knight with the blak shield / then was it sir
Tristram said the king / ye said sir Gaheryse And there with all the King smote
down his head / and in his heart he feryd sore that sire Tristram should get
him such worship in the Royame of Logrys / where thorou that he him self should
not be able to withstand him / Thus sire Gaheryse had great chere with king
Mark / and with queen la Beale Isoud the which was glad of sir Gaheryse
words / For well she wist by his deeds and manners / that it was sir Tristram /
And then the king made a feast Royal / and to that feast came sir Vwayne le
fyse de roy Vreyne / and sum callid him Vwayne le blaunche maynys / And this
sir Vwayn chalengyd all the knights of Cornewaile / Then was the king wood
wroth that he had no knights to ansuer him / Then sire Andred neuewe unto
king Mark lepte up and said I will encountre with sir Vwayne / Then he yede
and armed him and horsed him in the best manner / And there sire Vwayne met
with sire Andred and smote him down that he swouned on the earth / Then was
king Mark sorry and wroth out of mesure that he had no knight to revenge
his neuewe sir Andred / So the king called unto him sir Dynas the seneschal /
and praid him for his sake to take upon him to Just with sir Vwayne / Sir said
sir Dynas I am full both to have adoo with any knight of the round table / yet
said the king for my love take upon the to guste / So sir Dynas made him ready
/ and anon they encountered to gyders with great speres / but sire Dynas was
overthrown horse and man a great fall / who was wroth but king Mark / Allas
he said have I no knight that will encountre with yonder knight Sir said sir
Gaheryse for your sake I will Just / So sir Gaherys made him ready / and
when he was armed he rode in to the field / And when sir Vwayne saw sir
Gaheryses sheld he rode to him and said / sir ye do not your part / For sire
the first time ye were made Knight of the round table ye swear that ye should
not have a do with your felauship wetyngly And par die sir Gaheryse ye knew me
s by my shield and so do I know you by your sheld / and thou ye would break
your oath / I would not break mine / for there is not one here nor ye that shall
think I am aford of you / but I durst right well have adoo with you / and yet
we be sister sons / Then was sir Gaheryse ashamed / and so there with all
every knight went their way / and sir Vwayne rode in to the country / Then
king mark armed him and took his horse and his spear with a squire with him /
And then he rode before sir Vwayne / and suddenly at a gap he ran upon him as
he that was not ware of him / and there he smote him al most through the body /
and there left him / So within a while there came sir Kay / and fond sir
Vwayne / and asked him how he was hurt / I wot not said sir Vwayne why nor
wherefore / but by treason I am sure I gat this hurt / for here came a knight
suddenly upon me or that I was ware / and suddenly hurt me / Then there was
come sire Andred to seek king Mark Thou traitor knight said sir kay / and I
wiste it were thou that thus traitourly have hurt this noble knight / thou
sholdest never pass my hands / Sire said sir Andred I did never hurt him /
and that I will report me to him self / Fie on you falls knights said sir kay
/ for ye of Cornewaile ar naught worth / So sir kay made carry sir Vwayne to
the abbay of the black Cross / and there he was helyd / And then sir Gaherys
took his leave of king Mark / But or he departed he said / sire king ye did a
foul shame unto you and your Court when ye bannysshed sir Tristram out / of
this country / for ye neded not to have doubted no knight and he had been here
/ and so he departed

Then there came sire kay the Seneschal unto king Mark / and there he had
good chere showing outeward / Now fair lords said he will ye preue any
adventure in the forest of Morris in the which I know well is as hard an
adventure as I know any / Sir said sir kay / I will preue hit / And sir
Gaheryse said he would be auysed For king Mark was ever full of treason / and
there with all sir Gaheryse departed and rode his way / And by the same way
that sire Kay should ride / he leyd him down to rest chargynge his squire to
wait upon sir kay / and warn me when he comes / So within a while sir kay
came riding that way / and then sir Gaheryse took his horse and met him and
said sire kay ye are not wise to ride at the request of king Mark for he
deleth all with treason / Then said sire kay I require you let us preue
this adventure / I shall not fail you said sir Gaherys / and so they rode that
time till a lake / that was that time called the peryllous lake / And there they
abode under the shawe of the wood / The mean while king Mark within the
castle of Tyntagyl avoided all his barons and all other sauf such as were
pryuy with him / were avoided out of his chamber / And then he let call
his neuewe sir Andred / and badde arm him and horse him lyghtely / and by that
time it was mydnyght / And so king Mark was armed in blak horse and all /
and so at a pryuy posterne they two issued out with their varlets with them
/ and rode tylle they came to that lake / Then sir Kay aspyed them first and
gat his spear / and proffered to Just / And king Mark rode against him / and
smote each other full hard / for the moon shone as the bright day / And there at
that Iustes sir Kayes horse fylle down / for his horse was not so bygge as the
kings horse and sir kayes horse brysed him full sore / Then sire Gaherys was
wroth that sir kay had a fall / Then he cried knight sytte thou fast in thy
sadel / for I will revenge my felawe / Then king Mark was aferd of sir
Gaherys / and so with evil will king Mark rode against him / and sir Gaherys
gaf him such a stroke that he fell down / So then forth with all sir
Gaheryse ran unto sir Andred and smote him from his horse quyte that his helm
smote in the earth / and nyhe had broken his neck / And there with all sir
Gaherys alyghte and gate up sir Kay / And then they yode both on foot to
them / and badde them yield them / and tell their names other they should dye
/ Then with great pain sire Andred spak first and said hit is king Mark of
Cornewaile / therefore be ye ware what ye do / and I am sir Andred his cosyn /
Fie on you both said sir Gaheryse for a falls traitor / and falls treason have
thou wrout / and he both under the feigned chere that ye made us / it were pity
said sir Gaherys that thou sholdest live any longer / Save my life said king
Mark and I will make amendys and consider that I am a king anointed / it were
the more shame said sir Gaherys to save thy life / thou art a king enoynted
with creme / and therefore thou sholdest hold with all men of worship / And
therefore thou art worthy to dye / with that he lasshed at king Mark without
saying any more and couerd him with his sheld and defended him as he might /
and then sir kay lasshed at sir Andred / and there with all king Mark
yielded him unto sir Gaherys / And then he kneled adoune / and made his oath
upon the cross of the suerd that never while he lived he would be against
arraunt knights / And also he swear to be good Friend unto sir Tristram / if
ever he came in to Cornewaile / By then sir Andred was on the earth / and sir
Kay would have slain him / let be said sir Gaherys / slay him not I pray you /
It were pity said sire kay that he should live any longer / for this is nygh
cosyn unto sir Tristram / and ever he has been a traitor unto him / and by him
he was exyled out of Cornewaile / and therefore I will slay him said sir Kay /
ye shall not said sir Gaherys sythen I have given the king his life / I pray
you give him his life / And there with all sir Kay let him goo / And so sir
Kay and sire Gaherys rode their way unto Dynas the Seneschal for by cause they
herd say that he loved well sir Tristram / So they reposed them there / and
soon after they rode unto the royamme of Logrys / And so within a little while
they met with sire Lancelot that alweyes had dame Bragwayn with him / to
that entente / he wend to have met the sooner with sir Tristram / and sir
lancelot asked what tidings in Cornewaile / and whether they herd of sir
Tristram or not / Sir Kay and sir Gaherys ansuerd and said that they herd not
of him Then they told sir lancelot word by word of their adventure / Then
sir lancelot smyled and said / hard hit is to take out of the flesh that is
bred in the bone / and so maade hem merry to gyders

NOw leave we of this tale / and speak we of sir dynas hat had within the castle
a peramour / and she loved another knight better than him / And so when sir
Dynas went out on hunting / she slypped down by a tuell / And took with her
two brackets / and so she yede to the knight that she loved / and he her
again / And when sir Dynas come home / and mist his peramour and his
brachets then was he the more wrother for his Brachets than for the lady /
So then he rode after the knight that had his peramour and badde him torn
and Just / So sir Dynas smote him down that with the fall he brake his leg
and his arm / And then his lady and peramour cried sire Dynas mercy / and
said she would love him better than ever she did / Nay said sir Dynas I shall
never trust them that ones bytrayed me / and therefore as ye have begone so
end / for I will never meddle with you / And so sir Dynas departed and took
his brachets with him / and so rode to his castle / Now will we torn unto sir
lancelot that was right heavy that he could never here no tidings of sir
Tristram / for all this while he was in prison with sir Darras / Palomydes / and
Dynadan / Then dame Brangwayne took her leave to goo in to Cornewaile and sir
lancelot / sir kay / and sir Gaherys rode to seek sir Tristram in the country
of Surleuse / Now speaks this tale of sir tristram and of his two felawes /
for every day sire Palomydes brauled and said langage against sir Tristram / I
merueyle said sir Dynadan of the sir Palomydes / and thou had sire Tristram
here / thou would do him no harm / / For and a wolf and a sheep were to
gyders in a prison / the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in pees / and wete
thou well said sire Dynadan this same is sire Tristram at a word / and now may
thou do thy best with him / and let see now if ye can skyfte it with your
hands / then was sire Palomydes abashed and said lytyl / sir Palomydes
then said sir Tristram / I have herd much of your maugre against me / but I
will not meddle with you as at this time by my will / by cause I dread the
lord of this place that has us in governance / for and I dredde him not more
than I do the / soon hit should be skyfte / so they peaced them self / Right
so came in a damoysel and said knights be of good chere for ye are sure of
your lives / and that I herd say my lord sire Darras / Then were they glad
all three / For daily they wend they should have dyed / Then soon after this
sir Tristram fylle seek that he wend to have dyed / then sir Dynadan wept /
and so did sire Palomydes under them both making great sorou / So a damoysel
came in to them and fond them morning / Then she went unto sire Darras /
and told him how that mighty knight that bare the black shield was lykely to
dye / That shake not be said sir Darras / for god defend when Knights come
to me for socour that I should suffer hem to dye within my prison / Therefore said
sir Darras to the damoysel / fetch that knyt and his felawes before me / And
then anon sir Darras saw sir Tristram brought before him / he said sire
Knight me repents of thy sickness / for thou art called a full noble knight
/ and so hit seems by the / And wete ye well it shall never be said that sir
Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in prison / how be hit
/ that thou have slain / iij of my sons / where by I was gretely agreued / But
now shall thou goo and thy felawes / and your harneis and horses have been
fair and clean kept / and ye shall goo where hit lyketh you upon this
covenant / that thou Knight wilt promise me to be good friend to my sons two
that been now on live / and also that thou tell me thy name / Sir said he as
for me my name is sir Tristram de Lyones / and in Cornewaile was I born and
neuewe I am unto King Mark / And as for the death of your sons I might not
do with all / For and they had been the next kyn yt I have / I myt have done
none other wise / And if I had slain hem by treason or treachery I had been
worthy to have dyed / All this I consider said sir Darras / that all that ye
did was by force of knyghthode / and that was the cause I would not put you to
death / But sithe ye be sir Tristram the good knight I pray you hertely to be my
good friend and to my sons / Sir said sire Tristram I promise you by the feithe
of my body ever while I live I will do you seruyse / for ye have done to us
but as a naturel Knight ought to do / Then sir Tristram reposed him there
till that he was amended of his sickness / And when he was bygge and strong
/ they took their leave / and every knight took their horses and so departed
and rode to gyders till they came to a cross way / Now felawes said sir
Tristram here will we depart in sundry ways / and by cause sire Dynadan
had the first adventure of him I will begin

Capitulum xlj
So as sir Dynadan rode by a well / he fond a lady making great dole / what
eyleth you said sir Dynadan Sire knight said the lady I am the wofullest lady
of the world / for within these five days / here came a knight called sir
Breuse saunce pity / and he slew mine own brother / And ever syns he has kept
me at his own will / and of al men in the world I hate him most / And therefore
I require you of knygthode to avenge me / for he will not tarry but be here
anon / Let him come said sire Dynadan / And by cause of honor of all wymmen
I will do my part / With this came sir Breuse / And when he saw a Knight
with his lady / he was wood wroth / And then he said sir Knight keep the
from me / so they hurled to gyder as thonder / and either smote other passing
sore / But sire Dynadan put him through the sholder a grievous wound / and or
ever sir Dynadan might torn him sir Breuse was gone and fled / Then the
lady prayed him to bring her to a Castle there beside but four mile thens / and
so sir Dynadan brought her there / and she was welcome / for the lord of that
castle was her vnkel / and so sire Dynadan rode his way upon his adventure /
Now torn we this tale unto sire Tristram that by adventure he came to a castle
to ask lodging / wherein was queen Morgan le fay / and so when sire Tristram
was let in to that castle / he had good chere all that night / And upon the
morn when he would have departed / the Queen said / wete ye well ye shall not
depart lyghtely / for ye are here as a prisoner / Ihesu defend said sir
Tristram / for I was but late a prisoner / Fair knight said the queen ye shall
abide with me till that I wete what ye ar and from Whens ye come / And ever the
Queen would set sir Tristram on her own side / and her peramour on the other
side / And ever Queen Morgan would behold sir Tristram / and there at the knight
was Ialous / and was in will suddenly to have run upon sir Tristram with a
swerd / but he left it for shame / then the queen said to sir Tristram tell
me thy name and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will / upon that
covenant I tell you my name is sir Tristram de lyones / A said Morgan le fay
/ and I had wist that thou sholdest not have departed so soon as thou shall /
But sythen I have maade a promise / I will hold hit / with that thou will
promise me to bear upon the a shield that I shall deliver the / unto the castle
of the hard roche where king Arthur has cried a great turnement / and there I
pray you that ye will be / and to do for me as much deeds of arms as ye
may do / For at the Castle of maidens sir Tristram ye did merueillous deeds
of arms as ever I herd knight do / Madame said sir Tristram let me see the
shield that I shall bear / Then the shield was brought forth / and the feld
was guldyssh with a king and a queen therein painted / and a knight standing
above them upon the kings head / and the other upon the queen's / Madame said
sir Tristram this is a fair shield and a myty But what sygnefyeth this king
and this queen / and that knight standing up both their hedes / I shall
tell you said Morgan le fay hit sygnefyeth king Arthur and queen gueneuer and
a knight that holds them both in bondage and in seruage / who is that knight
said sire Tristram / that shall ye not wete as at this time / said the queen /
but as the Frensshe book says Queen Morgan loved sir lancelot lest / and ever
she desired him / and he Would never love her / nor do no thing at her request
/ and therefore she held many Knights to gyder / for to have taken him by
strength / And by cause she demed that sir Lancelot loved Queen Gueneuer
peramour / and she him again / therefore Queen Morgan le fay ordained that
sheld to put sir lancelot to a rebuke to that intent that king Arthur might
understand the love bitwene them / Then sir Tristram took that sheld and
promised her to bear hit at turnement at the castle of the hard roche / But
sir Tristram knew not that that sheld was ordained against sir lancelot / but
afterward he knew hit

Capitulum xlij
So then sire Tristram took his leave of the Queen / and took the sheld with
him / Then came the knyte that held Queen Morgan le fay / his name was sire
Hymeson / and he made him ready to follow sire Tristram / fair friend said
Morgan ride not after that knight / for ye shall not win no worship of him /
Fie on him coward said sire Hemyson / for I wist never good knight come out
of Cornewaile / but if hit were sir Tristram de Lyones / what and that be he
said she / Nay nay said he / he is with la beale Isoud and this is but a
daffyssh knight / Allas my fair friend ye shall find him the best knight that
ever ye met with all / For I know him better than ye do / for your sake
said sir Hemyson I shall slay him / A fair friend said the Queen me repents
that ye will follow that knight / for I fere me sore of your again coming /
with this / this knight rode his way wood wroth / and he rode after sir
Tristram as fast as he had been chaced with knights / When sir Tristram
herd a knight come after him so fast / he returned about / and saw a knyt
coming against him / And when he came nyghe to sir Tristram / he cried on
high sir knight keep the from me / Then they rasshed to gyders as hit had been thonder / and sir Hemyson brysed his spear upon sir Tristram / but his
harneis was so good that he might not hurt him / And sire Trystram smote him
harder and bare him thorou the body / and fylle over his horse croupe / Then
sire Tristram turned to have done more with his swerd / but he saw so much
blood go from him that him s^med he was lykely to deye / And so he departed
from him / and came to a fair manoyre to an old knyt and there sire Tristram
lodged

Now leave to speak of sir Tristram / and speak we of the knight that was
wounded to the death / then his varlet alyght and took of his helm / and
then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him / there is in me life
said the knight but hit is but lytyl / and therefore lepe thou up behind me /
when thou have helped me up / and hold me fast that I fall not / and bring
me to Queen Morgan le fay / for deep drautes of death drawn to my heart that I
may not live / for I would feign speak with her or I dyed / For else my soul
will be in great peril and I dye / for with great pain his varlet brought
him to the Castle / and there sir Hemyson fylle down deed / when Morgan le
fay saw him deed / she made great sorou out of reason / And then she let
despoylle him unto his shyrde / and so she let him put in to a tomb / And
about the tomb she let write / Here lies sir Hemyson slain by the hands
of sire Tristram de lyones / Now torn we unto sire Tristram that asked the
knight his host if he saw late any knights aduenturous / Sir he said the
last night here lodged with me Ector de marys and a damoysel with him / and
that damoysel told me that he was one of the best knights of the world / that
is not so said sir Tristram / for I know four better knights of his own
blood / and the first is sir lancelot du lake / call him the best knight /
and sir Bors de ganys Sir Bleoberys / sir Blamor de ganys and sir Gaheris / nay
said his host / sir Gawayne is a better knight than he / that is not so said
sir Tristram / for I have met with hem both / and I felt sir Gaherys for
the better knight and sir Lamorak I call him as good as any of them / except
sir lancelot / Why name ye not sir Tristram said his host / for I account
him as good as any of them / I know not sire Tristram said tristram / thus
they talked and bourded as long as them list / and then went to rest /
And on the morn sir Tristram departed and took his leave of his host / and
rode toward the roche deure / and none adventure had sire Tristram but that /
and so he rested not till he came to the castle where he saw five Ctentys

Then the king of Scotts and the king of Irland held against king Arthurs
knights / and there began a great meddle / So came in sir Tristram and did
merueillous deeds of arms / for there he smote down many knytes / And ever he
was before king Arthur with that shield / And when king Arthur saw that
shield / he meruyylled gretely in what entente hit was made / but Queen
Gueneuer demed as it was wherefore she was heavy / Then was there a damoysel of
Queen Morgan in a chamber by king Arthur / And when she herd king Arthur
speak of that shield / then she spak openly unto king Arthur / sire king
wete ye well this sheld was ordained for you to warn you of your shame and
dishonor / and that longs to you and your Queen / And then anon that
damoysel pyked her awey pryuely / that no man wist where she was become /
Then was king Arthur sad and wroth and asked from whens came that
damoysel / there was not one that knew her / nor wyste where she was become /
Then Queen Gueneuer called to her sir Ector de marys / and there she made her
complaynte to him / and said I wot well this sheld was made by Morgan le fay /
in despyte of me and of sir Lancelot / wherefore I dread me sore lest I should
be destroyed / And ever the king bihelde sire Tristram that did so
merueillous deeds of arms that he wo^dred sore what knight he might be / and
well he wist hit was not sir lancelot / And hit was told him that sir Tristram
was in petyte Bretayne with Isoud la blaunche maynys / for he demyd and he had been in the realm of Logrys / sir lancelot or sum of his felawes that were
in the quest of sir Tristram that they should have fond him or that time / So
king Arthur had merueylle what knight he might be / And ever sir Arthurs eye
was on that shield / All that aspyed the Queen / and that made her sore aferd
/ Then ever sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold what upon
the right hand and upon the lift hand that uneath no knyt might withstand
him / And the king of Scotts and the king of Irland began to withdraw hem /
When Arthur aspyed that / he thought that that Knight With the strange sheld
should not escape him / Then he called unto him sire Vwayn la blaunche maynys
/ and bad him arm him and make him ready / So anon king Arthur and sir
Vwayne dressid them before sir Tristram and required him to tell hem where he
had that shield / Sir he said I had it of Queen Morgan le fay sister unto king
Arthur

Here begins the second book of sire Tristram

arms for it is no point of my charge / and yet I trust to god to bear hem

ask bataille of me considering my great traueylle / how be hit I will not

his spear all to pyeces upon sir Tristrams shield / But sir Tristram hitte
Arthur again that horse and man fell to the earth / And there was king Arthur
wounded on the lift side a great wound and a peryllous / Then whannne sir
Vwayne saw his lord Arthur lie on the ground sore wounded he was passing heavy
/ And then he dressid his shield and his spear / and cried a loud unto sir
Tristram and said knight defend the / So they came to gyder as thonder / and
sir Vwayne brysed his spear / all to pyeces upon sire Tristrams shield / and
sire Tristram smote him harder and sorer with such a myt that he bare him
clean out of his sadel to the earth / with that sir Tristram turned about and
said Fair knights / I had no need to Just with you / for I have had enough to
do this day / Then arose Arthur / and went to sir Vwayn and said to sire
Tristram we have as we have deserved / For through our orgulyte we demanded
bataille of you / and yet we knew not your name / Nevertheless by saint cross
said sire Vwayne he is a strong knight at mine advise as any is now lynyng /
Then sir Tristram departed / and in every place he asked and demanded after
sir Lancelot / but in no place he could not here of him whether he were deed
or on live / wherefore sir tristram made great dole and sorrow / So sir Tristram
rode by a forest and then was he ware of a fair toure by a mareyse on that
one side / and on that other side a fair medowe / And there he saw ten
knights fighting to gyder / And ever the nere he came / he saw how there was
but one knight did bataille against nine knights / and that one did so
merueyllously that sire Tristram had great wonder that ever one knyt might do
so great deeds of arms / and thennne within a little while he had slain half
their horses / and unhorsed them / and their horses ran in the feldes and
foreste / Then sire Tristram had so great pity of that one knight that
endured so great pain / and ever he thought hit should be sir palomydes by his
shield / and so he rode unto the knights and cried unto them / and bad them
seace of their bataille / for they did them self great shame so many knights
to fight with one / Then ansuerd the master of tho knights / his name was
called Breuse saunce pity that was a^te that time the most meschyeuoust

And therefore and ye be wise / depart on your way as ye came / for this knight

the toure / and shytte sire Tristram without the gate / And when sire
Tristram saw this / he returned abak unto sir Palomydes / and fond him syttyng
under a tree sore wounded / A fair knight said sire Tristram well be ye fond
/ Gramercy said sir palomydes of your great goodenes / for ye have rescowed me
of my life and saved me from my death / what is your name said sir Tristram / he
said my name is sir Palomydes / O Ihesu said sir Tristra^ thou have a fair
grace of me this day / that I should rescowe the / and thou art the man in the
world that I most hate / but now make the ready / for I will do bataille with
the / what is your name said palomydes / my name is sir Tristram your mortal
enemy / hit may be so said sir palomydes / But ye have done over much for me
this day that I should fight with you / for in as much as ye have saved my life
/ hit will be no worship for you to have adoo with me / for ye are fressh and
I am wounded sore / And therefore and ye will needs have ado with me / Assign
me a day and then I shall mete with you without fail / ye say well said sir
Tristram / Now I assign you to mete me in the medowe by the river of Camelot /
where Merlyon set the peron / so they were agreed / Then sir Tristram
asked sir Palomydes why the ten knights did bataill with him / for this cause
said sir palomydes / as I rode up mine adventures in a forest here beside / I
aspyed where lay a deed Knight / and a lady weeping beside him / And when I
saw her making such dole / I asked her who slew her lord Sire she said the
falsest knight of the world now living and he is the most vylayne that over
man herd speak of / and his name is sir Breuse saunce pity / then for pity I
made the damoysel to lepe on her palfroy / and I promised her to be her waraunt
/ and to help her to entyere her lord / And so suddenly as I came riding by
this toure / there came out sir Breuse saunce pity / and suddenly he struck me
from my horse / And then or I might recover my horse / this sir Breuse slew
the damoysel / and so I took my horse again / and I was sore ashamed / and so
began the meddle betwixe us and this is is the cause wherefore we did this
bataille / Well said sir tristram now I understand the manner of your bataiylle
/ but in any wise have remembrance of your promise that ye have made with me
to do bataille with me this day fourtenyght / I shall not fail you said sir
Palomydes / well said sir Tristram as at this time I will not fail you till
that ye be out of the danger of your enemies / So they mounted upon their
horses / and rode to gyders unto that foreste / and there they fond a fair
well / with clear water burbelynge / fair sir said sir Tristram to drink of
that water have I courage / and then they alyght of their horses / And then
were they ware by them where stood a great horse teyed to a tree / and ever he
neyhed And then were they ware of a fair knight armed under a tree lackyng no
pyece of harneis save his helm lay under his heed / By the good lord said sir
Tristram yonder lies a well farynge knight / what is best to do / Awake him
said sir palomydes / so sir Tristram awaked him with the but of his spear / And
so the knight arose up hastily and put his helm upon his head / and gat a
great spear in his hand / and without any moo words he hurled unto sir
Tristram / and smote him clean from his sadel to the earth / and hurt him on
the lift side that sir Tristram lay in great peril / Then he wallopped
ferther / and fette his course / and came hurlynge upon sir palomydes / and
there he struck him a part thorou the body that he fylle from his horse to the
earth / And then this strange knight left them there / and took his way
through the foreste / With this sir Palomydes and sire Tristram were on foot
and gat their horses ageyn / and either asked counceylle of other / what was
best to done / By my head said sir Tristram I will follow this strong knight
that thus has shamed us / Well said sir Palomydes / and I will repose me here
by with a friend of mine / Beware said sire Tristram unto Palomydes that ye fail
not that day that ye have set with me to do bataill / for as I deem ye will
not hold your day / for I am much bygger than ye / As for that said sir
Palomydes / be hit as hit be may for I fear you not / For and I be not seek
nor prisoner I will not fail you / But I have cause to have more doubt of you
that ye will not mete with me / for ye ride after yonder strong knight / And
if ye mete with him / hit is an hard adventure and ever ye escape his hands /
Right so sir Tristram and sir Palomydes departed / and either took their ways
diverse

ANd so sire Tristram rode long after this strong knight / And at the last
he saw where lay a lady over thwarte a deed knight / Fair lady said sir
Tristram who has slain your lord / Sir she said here came a knight rydyng as
my lord and I rested us here / and asked him of whens he was / and my lord said
of Arthurs court / therefore said the strong knight I will Just with the /
for I hate all these that been of Arthurs Court / And my lord that lies here
deed amounted upon his horse / and the strong knight and my lord encountered to
gyder / and there he smote my lord thorugh out with his spear / and thus he
has brought me in great woo and damage / That me repents said sire
Tristram of your great anger / and hit please you / tell me your husbands
name / sir said she his name was Galardoun that would have preued a good knight
/ So departed sir Tristram from that dolorous lady and had much euylle
lodgyng / Then on the thyrdde day sir Tristram met with sir Gawayne and
with sir Bleoberys in a forest at a lodge and either were sore wounded / Then
sire Tristram asked sir Gawayne and sir Bleoberys if they met with such a
Knight with such a cognoyssaunce with a keuerd shield / Fair sir said these
knights such a knight met with us to our great dommage / and first he smote
down my felawe sire Bleoberys and sore wounded him / by cause he badde me I
should not have ad^ with him For why he was over strong for me / That strong
knight took his words at scorn and said he said it for mockery / And then
they rode to gyders / and so he hurt my felawe / And When he had done so / I
might not for shame / but I must Just with him / And at the first course he
smote me down / and my horse to the earth / And there he had al most slain me
/ and from us he took his horse / and departed / and in an evil time we met
with him / Fair knights said sir Tristram so he met with me / and with
another knight that hight Palomydes / and he smote us both down with one
spear / and hurt us right sore / By my feythe said sir Gawayne by my counceil
ye shall let him pass / and seek him no ferther / for at the next feast of
the round table upon pain of my head ye shall find him there / By my feythe
said sir Tristram I shall never rest till that I find him / And then sir
Gawayne asked him his name / then he said my name is sir Tristram / and so
either told other their names / and then departed sir Tristram / and rode his
way / And by fortune in a medowe sire Tristram met with sir Kay the seneschal
and sir Dynadan / What tidings with you said sir Tristram with you Knights /
Not good said these knights / why so said sir Tristram I pray you tell me /
for I ride to seek a knight / what cognoyssaunce bears he said sir Kay / He
bears said sir Tristram a couerd sheld close with a clothe / By my head said
sir Kay that is the same Knight that met with us / for this night we were
lodged within a wydowes house / and there was that knight lodged / And when he
wist we were of Arthurs court / he spak great vylonye by the king / and
specially by the Queen Gueneuer / And then on the morn was waged bataille
with him for that cause / And at the first recou^tre said sir kay he smote me
down from my horse / and hurt me passing sore / And when my felawe sir
Dynadan saw me smyten down and hurt / he would not revenge me / but fled
from me / And thus is he departed / And then sir Tristram asked them their
names / and so either told other their names / And so sire Tristram departed
from sir kay / and from sir Dynodan / and so he past through a great forest in
to a plain till he was ware of a pryory / and there he reposed him with a good
man six days

ANd then he sent his man that hight Gouernaile / and commanded him to goo
to a Cite there by to fetch him new harneis / for hit was long time before
that / that sire Tristram had been refresshed / his harneis was brysed and
broken And when Gouernaile his servant was come with his apparail / he took
his leave at the wydowe / and mounted upon his horse / and rode his way erly on
the morn / And by sodeyn adventure sir Tristram met with sir Sagramore le
desyrus / and with sir Dodynas le saueage / And these two knights met with
sire Tristram and questyoned with him / and asked him if he would Just with hem
/ Fair knights said sir Tristram with a good will I would Just with you /
But I have promised at a day set nere hand to do bataille with a strong
knight / And therefore I am loathe to have adoo with you / for and hit
mysfortuned me here to be hurt I should not be able to do my bataille / which
I promised / As for that said Sagramor maulgre your head ye shall Just with
us / or ye pass from us / well said sir Tristram / if ye enforce me thereto I
must do what I may / And then they dressid their sheldes / and came rennynge
to gyder with great ire / But through sir Tristrams great force he struck sir
Sagramor from his horse / Then he hurled his horse ferther / and said to sir
Dodynas / knyte make the ready / and so thorou fine force sire Tristram struck
Dodynas from his horse / And when he saw hem lie on the earth / he took his
brydel / and rode forth on his way and his man Gouernaile with him / Anon as
sir Tristram was paste sir Sagramore and sir Dodynas gate again their horses /
and mounted up lyghtely and followed after sir Tristram / And when sire Tristram
saw them come so fast after him / he returned with his horse to them / and
asked them what they would Hit is not long ago sythen I smote you to the earth
at your own request / and desire / I would have ryden by you / but ye would not
suffer me / and now me seems ye would do more bataille with me / That is
truth said sire Sagramore and sire Dodynas / for we will be reuengyd of the
despyte ye have done to us / Fair knights said sir Tristram that shall lytyl
need you / for all that I did to you / ye caused hit / wherefore I require you
of your knygthode leave me as at this time / for I am sure and I do bataille
with you I shall not escape with out great hurtes / and as I suppose ye
shall not escape all lotles / And this is the cause why I am so loath to have
ado with you / For I must fight within these three days with a good knight and
as valiant as any is now living / and if I be hurt I shall not be able to
do bataille with him / What Knight is that said sir Sagramor that ye shall
fight with all / Syrs said he it is a good knight called sir Palomydes / By
my head said sir Sagramor and sire Dodynas ye have cause to dread him / for ye
shall find him a passing good knight / and a valiant / And by cause ye shall
have ado with him / we will forbere you as at this time / and else ye should not
escape us lyghtely / But fair knight said sir Sagramour tell us your name /
Sir said he my name is sir Tristram de lyones / A said Sagramor and sir Dodynas
well be ye fond / for much worship have we herd of you / And then either
took leave of other / and departed on their way /

Then departed sire Tristram and rode streyghte unto Camelot to the Peron
that Merlyn had made to fore where sire Lancyor that was the Kings sone of
Irland was slain by the hands of Balyn / and in that same place was the fair
lady Columbe slain that was love unto sir Lanceor for after he was deed she
took his suerd and threst hit thorou her body / And by the craft of Merlyn he
made to entiere this knight Lanceor and his lady Columbe under one stone / And
at that time Merlyon profecyed / that in that same place should fight two the
best knights that ever were in Arthurs days / and the best lovers / So
when sire Tristram came to the tomb where lancyor and his lady were buried /
he looked about him after sir Palomydes / Then was he ware of a semely knight
came rydyng against him all in white / with a couerd shield / When he came
nyghe sir Tristram he said on high ye be welcome sir Knight / and well and
truly have ye hold your promise / And then they dressid their sheldes and
speres / and came to gyder^ with all their myghtes of their horses / and they
met so fyersly that both their horses and Knights fylle to the earth / And as
fast as they myte avoided their horses / and put their sheldes before them /
and they struck to gyders with bright swerdes as men that were of might / and
either wounded other wonderly sore that the blood ran out upon the grass /
And thus they fought the space of four hours / that never one would speak to
other one word / and of their harneis they had hewn of many pecys / O lord
Ihesu said Gouernaile I merueyle gretely of the strokes my master has yeuen
to your master / By my head said sir Lau^celots servant your master has not
yeuen so many but your master has received as many or more / O Ihesu said
Gouernaile it is to much for sir palomydes to suffer or sir Lancelot / And
yet pity it were that either of these good knights should destroy others blood
/ So they stood and wept both / and made great dole / when they saw the
bryghte swerdes over couerd with blood of their bodies / Then at the last
spoke sir lancelot and said knight thou fyghtest wonderly well / as ever I saw
knight / therefore and hit please you tell me your name / Sir said sire
Tristram that is me loathe to tell any man my name / Truly said sir lancelot
and I were required I was never loath to tell my name / Hit is well said said
sir Tristram then I require you to tell me your name / fair knight he said
my name is sir lancelot du lake / Allas said sire Tristram what have I done /
for ye are the man in the world that I love best / Fair knight said sir
Lancelot tell me your name Truly said he my name is sir Tristram de lyones /
O Ihesu said sir lancelot what adventure is befalle me / And there with sir
lancelot kneled down and yielded him up his suerd And there with all sir
Tristram kneled adoune / and yielded him up his suerd / And so either gaf other

Return again said sir lancelot for your quest is done / for I have met
with sir Tristram / loo here is his own person / Then was sir Gawayne
glad / and said to sire Tristram ye are welcome / for now have ye easyd me
gretely of my labor / For what cause said sir Gawayne came ye in to this
court / Fair sir said sir Tristram I came in to this country / by cause of
sir Palomydes / for he and I had assygned at this day to have done bataille to
gyders at the Peroun And I merueyle I here not of him / And thus by aduentur my
lord sire Lau^celot and I met to gyders / With this came King Arthur / And
when he wist that there was sir Tristram / then he ran unto him and took
him by the hand / And said sire Tristram ye are as welcome as any Knight /
that ever came to this Court / And when the King had herd how sire
Lancelot and he had foughten / and either had wounded other wonderly sore /
then the King maade great dole / Then sir Tristram told the King how he
came thydder for to have had adoo with sire Palomydes / And / then he told
the king how he had rescowed him from the nine knights and Breuse saunce pity
/ And how he fond a Knight lyeng by a well / and that Knight smote down sir
Palomydes and me / but his sheld was couerd with a clothe / So sir Palomydes
left me / and I followed after that Knight / and in many places I fond where
he had slain Knights / and foriusted many / By my head said sir Gawayne that
same Knight smote me down and sire Bleoberys and hurt us sore both / he with
the couerd shield / A said sir Kay that Knight smote me adoune and hurt me
passing sore / and feign would I have known him but I myt not / Ihesu mercy
said Arthur what knight was that with the couerd shield / I know not said
sir Tristram / and so said they all / now said king Arthur then wot I for it
is sir lau^celot / then they al looked upon sir lau^celot and said ye have
begyled us with your couerd shield / Hit is not the first time said Arthur he
has done so / My lord said sir Lancelot truly wete ye well I was the same
knight that bare the couerd shield / And by cause I would not be known that I
was of your Court I said no worship of your hows That is truth said sir
Gawayne / sir kay / and sir Bleoberys Then king Arthur took sir Tristram by
the hand / and went to the table round / Then came Queen Gueneuer and many
ladies with her / and all tho ladies sayden at one voice / welcome sir
Tristram / welcome said the damoysels / welcome said knights / welcome said
Arthur for one of the best knights / and the gentylst of the world / and the
man of most worship / for of all manner of hunting thou berest the price /
and of all mesures of blowynge thou art the beginning / and of all the
terms of huntyng and haukyng ye are the begynner / of all Instruments of
musyke ye ar the best / therefore gentyl knight said Arthur ye are welcome to
this court / And also I pray you said Arthur grant me a bone / it shall be
at your commandment said Tristram / well said Arthur I will desire of you that
ye will abide in my court / Sir said sire Tristram thereto is me ^othe / for
I have adoo in many countries / Not so said Arthur / ye have promised hit me
/ ye may not say nay / Sir said sir Tristram I will as ye will / Then
went Arthur unto the seges about the round table / and looked in every syege /
the which were void that lacked knights / And then the king saw in the
siege of Marhaus letters that saiden / this is the syege of the noble knight
sir Tristram / And then Arthur made sir Tristram knight of the table round
with great nobley and great f^est as might be thought / for sir marhaus was
slain before by the hands of sire Tristram in an yland / and that was well
known at that time in the court of Arthur / for this marhaus was a worthy
knight / And for euylle deeds that he did unto the country of Cornewaile /
sire Tristram and he fought / And they fought so long tracynge and
trauer^ynge tylle they fylle bledynge to the earth / for they were so sore
wounded that they might not stand for bledynge / and sir Tristram by fortune
recouerd and sire Marhaus dyed through the stroke on the head / So leave we of
sir Tristram and speak we of King Mark /

Then King Mark had great despyte of the renoume of sir Tristram / and
Thanne he chaced him out of Cornewaile / yet was he neuewe unto King Mark /
but he had great suspecyon unto sire Tristram by cause of his Queen la Beale
Isoud / for him seemed that there was to much love bitwene them both / So
when sir Tristram departed out of Cornewaile in to England / king mark herd
of the great prowess that sir Tristram did there / the which grieved him sore
/ So he sent on his party men to aspye what deeds he did / And the Queen
sent pryuely on her party spies to know what deeds he had done / for great
love was bitwene them tweyn So when the messagers were come home / they told
the troth as they had herd that he passed all other knights / but if it were
sir lancelot / Then king Mark was right heavy of these tidings / and as
glad was la Beale Isoud / Then in great despyte he took with him two good
Knytes / and two squyers / and desguysed him self / and took his way in to
England to the entente for to slay sir Tristram / and one of these ij Knights
hight Bersules / and the other Knyt was called Amant / So as they rode King
mark asked a knight that he met where he should find King Arthur / he said at
Camelot / Also he asked that Knight after sire Tristram whether he herd of him
in the court of King Arthur / wete you well said that Knyt ye shall find sir
Tristram there for a man of as great worship as is now living for thur his
prowess he wa^ the turnement of the castle of maidens / that stands by the
hard roche / And sythen he has won with his own hands thyrtty Knights
that were men of great honor /

And the last batail that ever he dy^e / he fought with sire Lancelot / and
that was a merueilous bataille / And not by force sir lancelot brought sir
Tristram to the Court / and of him king Arthur made passing great joy / and
so maade him knight of the table round / and his seat was where the good
Knights sir Marhaus seat was / Then was King Mark passing sorry when he
herd of the honor of sir Tristram / and so they departed / Then said King
Mark unto his two Knights / Now will I tell you my counceylle ye are the
men that I trust most to on live / and I will that ye wete my coming hyder
is to this entente / for to destroy sir Tristram by wyles or by treason / and
hit shall be hard if ever he escape our hands / Allas said sir Bersules what
mean you / for ye be set in such a way / ye are disposed shamefully For sir
Tristram is the Knyt of most worship that we know living / And therefore I
warn you plainly I will never consent to do him to the de the / and therefore
I will yield my seruyse / and forsake you when king Mark herd him say so /
Suddenly he drew his swerd and said A traitor / and smote sir Bersules on the
head that the suerd went to his teeth / When Amant the knight saw him do
that vylaynous deed / and his squyers / they said hit was foul done / and
meschyeuously / wherefore we will do the no more seruyse / and wete ye well /
we will appeche the of treason before Arthur / Then was King Mark wonderly
wroth / and would have slain Amant / but he and the two squyers held them to
gyders / and set naught by his malice / when King mark saw he might not
be revenged on them / he said thus unto the Knight Amant / wete thou well / and
thou apoeche me of treason / I shall thereof defend me before King Arthur /
but I require the that thou tell not my name that I am King mark what someuer
come of me / As for that said sir Amant I will not discover your name / and so
they departed / and Amant and his felawes took the body of Bersules and buried
hit

Then king Mark rode till he came to a fontayne / and there he rested him /
and stood in a doubt whether he would ride to Arthurs court or none / or
return again to his country / And as he thus rested him by that fontayne /
there came by him a knight well armed on horsbak / and be alyghte and teyed his
horse until a tree / and set him down by the brynke of the fontayne / and
there he made great la^gour and dole / and made the dolefullest complaynte of
love / that ever man herd / and all this while was he not ware of king Mark /
And this was a great part of his complaynte / he cried and wept saying O
fair Queen of Orkeney king Lots wife and mother of sir Gawayne and to sire
Gaheris and mother to many other / for thy love I am in great pains / Then
King Mark arose and went nere him / and said / Fair knight ye have made a
pyteous complaynte / Truly said the knight / hit is an honderd part more
reufullyr than my heart can utter / I require you said King Mark tell me your
name / Sir said he as for my name I will not hyde it from no knight that bears
a shield / and my name is sire Lamorak de galys / But when sire Lamorak herd
King Mark speak then wist he well by his speech that he was a Cornysshe
knight / Sir said sir Lamorak / I understand by your tongue ye be of Cornewaile
wherein there duelleth the shamefullest king that is now living / for he is a
great enemy to all good knights / and that preueth well / for he has chaced
out of that Country sir Tristram that is the worshipfullest knight that now
is living / and all knights speken of him worship / And for Ialousnes of his
queen he has chaced him out of his country / Hit is pity said sir Lamorak
that ever any such falls knight coward as king Mark is should be matched with
such a fair lady and good as la Beale Isoud is / for all the world of him
speaks shame / and of her worship that any Queen may have I have not adoo in
this matere said king mark / neither naught will I speak thereof Well said
said sire Lamorak sire can ye tell me any tidings / I can tell you said sir
Lamorak / that there shall be a great turnement in have beside Camelot at the
castle of Iagent / and the king with the C knytes and the king of Irland as I
suppose make that turnement

Then there came a knight that was callid sire Dynadan / and salewed them
both / And when he wist that king Mark was a knight of Cornewaile / he
repreued him for the love of king Mark a thousand fold more / than did sir
lamorak / then he proffered to Just with king Mark / and he was full loathe
thereto / But sir Dynadan edgyd him so / that he Iusted with sir lamorak / and
sir lamorak smote king mark so sore that he bare him on his spear end over
his horse tail / And then king Mark arose again / and followed after sir
lamorak / but sir Dynadan would not Just with sire Lamorak / But he told king
Mark that sire Lamorak was sire kay the s^neschall / that is not so said
king Mark / for he is much byggar than sir kay / and so he followed and
ouertoke him / and badde him abide / what will ye do said sir Lamorak / Sir
he said / I will fight with a swerd / for ye have shamed me with a spear / And
there with they dasshed to gyders with swerdes / and sir Lamorak suffered him /
and forbear him And king Mark was passing hasty / and smote thycke strokes /
Sir Lamorak saw he would not stynte and waxyd somewhat wroth / and doubled his
strokes / for he was one of the noblest knights of the world / and he beat him
so on the helm that his / head henge ny un the sadel bow when sir lamorak
saw him fare so / he said / sir knight what chere me seems ye have nyghe
your fylle of fighting / hit were pity to do you any more harm / for ye are
but a mean knight / therefore I give you leave to goo where ye list / Gramercy
said king Mark For ye and I be not matches / Then sir dynadan mocked king
Mark and said ye are not able to match a good knight / as for that said King
Mark at the first time that I Iusted with this Knyt ye refused him / Think ye
that it is a shame to me said sir Dynadan / Nay sir it is ever worship to a
Knyt to refuse that thing that he may not atteyne / therefore your worship had been much more to have refused him as I did / for I warn you plainly he is
able to beat such five as ye / and I be / for ye Knights of Cornewaile are no
men of worship / as other Knights are / And by cause ye are no men of worship
/ ye hate all men of worship / for never was bredde in your country such a
Knight as is sir Tristram /

Then they rode forth all to gyders King Mark / sir Lamorak and sir Dynadan
till that they came to a bridge / And at the end thereof stood a fair Toure /
Then saw they a Knight on horsbak well armed braundysshyng a spear cryenge
and proferynge him self to Just / Now said sir Dynadan unto King Mark / yonder
ar two brethren that one hight Aleyn / and the other hyghte Tryan that will
Just with any that passes this passage / Now profer your self said Dynadan to
King Mark / for ever ye be leide to the earth / Then King Mark was ashamed
/ and there with he feutryd his spear / and hurtl^d to sir Tryan / and either
brake their speres / all to pyeces / and passid through anon / Then sir Trian
sent King Mark another spear to Just more / But in no wise he would not Just
no more / Then they came to the castle al three Knights / and praid the lord
of the castle of herburgh / ye are right welcome said the Knights of the
castle / for the love of the lord of this castle / the which hight sir Tor le
fyse aries / and then they came in to a fair court well repaired / and they
had passing good chere till the lieutenaunt of this castle that hight Berluse /
aspyed King Mark of Cornewaile / Then said Berluse / sir Knight I know you
better than ye wene / for ye are King Mark that slew my fader before mine
own eyes / and me had ye slain had I not escaped in to a wood / but wete
ye well for the love of my lord of this castle I will neither hurt you ne harm
you nor none of your felauship / But wete ye well when ye are past this lodging

for the love of my lord sir Tor / and for the love of sir Lamorak the
honorable Knight that here is lodged ye shall have none ylle lodging / For hit
is pity that ever ye should be in the company of good Knights / for ye ar the
most vylaynous knight or king that is now known on live / for ye are a
destroyer of good knights and all that ye do is but treason /

Then was King Mark sore ashamed / and said but lytyl again / But when
sir Lamorak and sir Dynadan wist that he was king Mark / they were sorry of
his felauship / So after souper they went to lodging / So on the morn they
arose erly / and king Mark and sir Dynadan rode to gyders / and three mile fro

that other his two cosyns / Sir Berluse saw king Mark / and then he cried

his condycyon / and feign I would be from him / well dynadan said sir Berluse me
repents that ye will take party with him / but now do your best / And
then he hurtled to King Mark and smote him sore upon the shield / that he
bare him clean out of his sadel to the earth / That saw sir Dynadan / and he
feutryd his spear / and ran to one of Berluses felawes / and smote him down
of his sadel / Then Dynadan turned his horse / and smote the thyrdde knight in
the same wise to the earth / for sire Dynadan was a good knight on horsbak /
and there byganne a great batail for Berluse and his felawes held them to
gyders strongly on ^ote And so through the great force of sir Dynadan / king
Mark had Berluse to the earth / and his two felawes fled / and had not ben
sire Dynadan king Mark would have slain him / And so sire Dynadan resoowed
him of his life / for king Mark was but a murderer / And then they took
their horses / and departed / and left sir Berluse there sore wounded Then
king Mark and sir Dynadan rode forth a four leges english till that they came
to a bridge where houed a knight on horsbak armed and ready to Just / Loo said
sir Dynadan unto King Mark / yonder houeth a Knight that will Just / for
there shall none pass this bridge / but he must Just with that Knight / Hit
is well said king mark for this Iustes falls with the / Sir Dynadan knew
the knight well / that he was a noble Knight / and feign he would have Iusted /
but he had had lever King Mark had Iusted with him / but by no mean king
Mark would not Just / Then sir Dynadan might not refuse him in no manner /
And then either dressid their speres and their sheldes / and smote to gyders
so that thorou fine force sir Dynadan was smyten to the earth / and lyghtely
he arose up / and gat his horse / and required that Knight to do bataille with
suerdes / And he ansuerd and said Fair Knight as at this time I may not have
adoo with you no more / for the customme of this passage is such / Then was
sir Dynadan passing wroth / that he myt not be revenged of that Knight / and
so he departed / and in no wise would that Knight tell his name / But ever sir
Dynadan thought he should know him by his shield that it should be sir Tor

Capitulum xj
So as they rode by the way / King Mark then began to mock sir Dynadan
and said I wend you Knights of the table round myt not in no wise find their
matches / ye say well said sir Dynadan / as for you on my life I call you none
of the best knights / But sithe ye have such a despyte at me / I require you
to Just with me / to preue my strength / Not so said King Mark / for I
will not have ado with you in no manner / But I require you of one thing that
when ye come to Arthurs court discover not my name / for I am there so
hated / It is shame to you said sir Dynadan / that ye govern you so
shamefully / for I see by you ye ar full of cowardyse and ye are a murderer /
and that is the grettest shame that a Knight may have / for never a Knight
being a murderer has worship / nor never shall have / for I saw but late
thur my force ye would have slain sir Berluse a better Knight than ye / or ever
ye shall be / and more of prowess Thus they rode forth talking till they came
to a fair place where stood a knight and prayed them to take their lodging
with him / So at the request of that knight / they reposed them there and made
them well at ease / and had great chere / For all arraunt knights were welcome
to him / and specially all tho of Arthurs court / Then sire Dynadan
demanded his host what was the Knygytes name that kept the bridge For what
cause ask you it said his host / for hit is not long ago said sir Dynadan
sythen he gaf me a fall / A fair knight said his host / thereof have ye no
meruaylle for he is a passing good knight / and his name is sir Tor the sone
of aries le vayshere / A said sir Dynadan was that sir Tor / for truly so ever
me thought / Right as they stood thus talkyng to gyders / they saw come
riding to them over a plain vj knights of the court of king Arthur well
armed at al points / And there by their sheldes sire Dynadan knew them well /
The first was the good knight sir Vwayne the sone of King Vryens / the second
was the noble knight sir Brandyles / the third was Ozana le cure hardy / the
fourth was Vwayne les auenturous / The fyfthe was sir Agrauayne / The vj sir
Mordred brother to sir Gawayne / When sir Dynadan had seen these vj knights /
he thought in him self he would bring king Mark by some wyle to Just with
one of them And anon they took their horses and ran after these knights well
a three mile english / Then was king Mark ware / where they sat al six
about a well / and ete and drank such metes as they had / and their horses
walkyng and sum teyed / and their sheldes henge in diverse places about them
Loo said sir Dynadan yonder ar Knights arraunt that will Just with us / God
forbede said King Mark / for they be syx and we but two / As for that said
sire Dynadan let us not spare / for I will assaye the formest / and there
with he maade him ready / when king Mark saw him do so as fast as sir
Dynadan rode toward them King mark rode froward them with all his mayneal
meyny / So when sire Dynadan saw King Mark was gone / he set the spear
out of the reest / and threw his sheld upon his bak / and came riding to the
felauship of the table round / And anon sire Vwayne knew sir Dynadan / and
welcomed him / and so did al his felauship /

Capitulum xij /
ANd then they asked him of his adventures / and whether he had seen sir
Tristram or sir lancelot / So god me help said sir Dynadan I saw none of
them sythen I departed from Camelot / what Knight is that said sir Brandyles
that so suddenly departed from you / and rode over yonder field / Sir said he /
hit was a Knight of Cornewaile / and the most horrible coward that ever
bestrode horse / what is his name said all these knights / I wot not said sir
Dynadan / So when they had reposed them / and spoken to gyders / they took
their horses / and rode to a castle where duellid an old knight that made all
Knights erraunt good chere / Then in the mean while that they were talking
came in to the castle sir Gryflet le fyse de dieu / and there was he welcome /
and they all asked him whether he had seen sire Lancelot or sire Tristram /
Syrs he ansuerd I saw him not sythen he departed from Camelot / So as sir
Dynadan Walked and beheld the castle / there by in a chamber he aspyed King
Mark / and then he rebuked him / and asked him why he departed so / Sir
said he for I durst not abide by cause they were so many But how escaped ye
said King Mark / sir said sir Dynadan they were better friends than I wend they
had been / who is Capytayn of that felauship said the King / then for to fere
him sir Dynadan said that it Was sir Lancelot / O Ihesu said the King might I
know sir Lancelot by his shield / ye said Dynadan / for he bears a shield of
silver and black bendys / All this he said to fere the king / for sire
lancelot was not in his felauship / Now I pray you said king Mark that ye
will ride in my felauship / that is me loathe to do said sire Dynadan by cause
ye forsook my felauship / Right so sir Dynadan went from king Mark and went
to his own felauship and so they mounted upon their horses / and rode on their
ways / and talked of the Cornyssh knight / for Dynadan told them that he was
in the castle where they were lodged / hit is well said said sir Gryflet / for
here have I brought sir Dagonet king Arthurs fool that is the best felawe and
the meryest / in the world / Will ye do well said sir Dynadan I have told the
Cornysshe Knight that here is sir Lancelot / and the Cornysshe Knight asked me
what shield he bare / Truly I told him that he bare the same shield that sir
Mordred bears / will ye do well said sir Mordred I am hurt and may not well
bear my shield nor harneis / And therefore put my shield and my harneis upon sir
Dagonet / and let him set upon the Cornysshe Knight / that shall be done
said sir Dagonet by my feythe / Then anon was Dagonet armed him in Mordreds
harneis and his shield / and he was set on a great horse and a spear in his
hand / Now said Dagonet show me the Knight / and I trow I shall bear him
down / So all these Knights rode to a wood side / and abode till King
Mark came by the way / Then they put forth sir Dagonet / and he came on all the while his horse might run straight upon King Mark And When he came
nyghe King Mark / he cried as he were wood / and said keep the Knight of
Cornewaile / for I will slay the / Anon as King Mark beheld his shield / he
said to him self / yonder is sir lancelot Allas now am I destroyed / and there
with all he made his horse to run as fast as it might thorugh thycke and
thynne / And ever sire Dagonet followed after King Mark cryenge and rat^ynge
him as a wood man through a great forest / when sir Vwayne and sire Brandyles
saw dagonet so chase King Mark / they laughed all as they were wood / And
then they took their horses / and rode after to see how sir Dagonet spedde /
for they would not for no good that sire Dagonet were shente / for King Arthur
loved him passing well / and made him Knight his own hands / And at every
turnement he began to make King Arthur to laughe / Then the knights rode
here and there cryenge and chacyng after king Mark that all the forest range
of the noise /

Capitulum xiij
So king Mark rode by fortune by a well in the way where stood a Knight
erraunte on horsbak armed at al points with a great spear in his hand And
when he saw King Mark coming fleing / he said Knight return again for
shame and stand with me / and I shall be thy waraunt / A fair Knight said King
Mark let me pass / for yonder comes after me the best knight of the world
with the blak bended sheld / Fie for shame said the knight he is none of the
worthy Knights / and if he were sire lancelot or sir Tristram I should not
doubt to mete the better of them both / When King Mark herd him say that
word / he turned his horse and abode by him / And then that strong Knight
bare a spear to Dagonet / and smote him so sore that he bare him over his horse
tail / and nyghe he had broken his neck / And anon after him came sir
Brandyles / and when he saw Dagonet have that fall / he was passing wroth
/ and cried Keep the Knight / and so they hurtled to gyders wonder sore / But
the Knight smote sir Brandyles so sore that he went to the earth horse and man
/ Sire Vwayne came after and saw all this / Ihesu said he / yonder is a
strong Knight / And then they feutryd their speres / and this Knight came
so egerly that he smote down sir Vwayne / Then came Ozana with the hardy
heart / and he was smyten down / Now said sire Gryflet by my counceyl let us
send to yonder arraunt Knight / and wete whether he be of Arthurs Court / for
as I deem it is sir Lamorak de galys / So they sent unto him / and prayed the
strange Knight to tell his name / and whether he were of Arthurs court or
not / As for my name they shall not wete / but tell hem I am a Knyt arraunt
as they are / and let them wete that I am no Knight of King Arthurs Court /
and so the squire rode again unto them and told them his ansuer of him / By
my head said sir Agrauayne he is one of the strongest Knights that ever I saw
/ for he has overthrown three noble Knights / and needs we must encountre
with him for shame / So sir Agrauayne feutryd his spear / and that other was
ready / and smote him down over his horse to the earth / And in the same wise he
smote sir Vwayne les auoultres and also sir Gryflet / then had he served hem
all / but sir Dynadan / for he was behind / and sir Mordred was unarmed and
Dagonet had his harneis / So when this was done this strong Knight rode on
his his way a soft paas / and king Mark rode after him / pray sing him
mykel / but he would ansuer no words / but syghed wonderly sore / hanging
down his head / taking no head to his words / Thus they rode well a three mile
English / and then this Knight called to him a varlette / and badde him
ride until yonder fair manoyre / and recommaunde me to the lady of that castle
and place / and pray her to send me refresshynge of good metes / and drynkes
/ And if she ask the what I am / Tell her that I am the knight that follows
the Glatysaunt be / that is in English to say the questynge beeste for
that be where someuer he yede / he quested in the belly with such a noise /
as it had been a thyrtty couple of hounds

Then the varlet went his way and came to the manoyr and salewed the lady /
and told her from whens he came / And when she understood that he came from the
knight that followed the questynge beeste / O sweet lord Ihesu she said when
shall I see that noble Knight my dear sone Palomydes / Allas will he not
abide with me / and there with she swouned and wept / and made passing great
dole / And then also soon as she might she gaf the varlet all that he axyd
/ And the varlet returned unto sir Palomydes / for he was a varlet of king
Mark / And as soon as he came / he told the knights name was sir Palomydes /
I am well pleasyd said king Mark but hold the still and seye no thing /
Then they alyghte and set them down and reposed them a while / Anon with
all king Mark fell on sleep / when sire Palomydes saw him sound a sleep
/ he took his horse and rode his way and said to them / I will not be in the
company of a slepynge Knight / And so he rode forth a great paas

Capitulum xiiij
NOw torn we unto sire Dynadan that fond these seven knights passing heavy /
And when he wyste how that they sped / as heavy was he / My lord Vwayne said
Dynadan / I dare ley my head it is sir Lamorak de galys / I promise you all /
I shall find him / and he may be found in this country / and so sire
Dynadan rode after this knight / And so did king Mark that sought him through
the forest So as King Mark rode after sir Palomydes / he herd a noise of a man
/ that made great dole / Then king Mark rode as nyghe that noise as he might
and as he durst / Then was he ware of a knight that was descended of his horse
/ and had put of his helm / and there he made a pyteous complaynte / and a
dolorous of love

Now leave we that / and talk we of sire Dynadan that rode to seek sir
Palomydes / And as he came within a foreste / he met with a Knight a chacer
of a dear / Sir said sire Dynadan met ye with a Knight with a shield of
silver / and lions hedes / ye fair knight said the other / with such a knight
met I with but a while agone / and strayte yonder way he yede / Gramercy
said sir Dynadan / for might I find the trak of his horse I should not fail to
find that Knight / Right so as sir Dynadan rode in the even late / he herd a
doleful noise as it were of a man / Then sir Dynadan rode toward that noise /
And when he came nyghe that noise / he alyghte of his horse / and went nere
him on foot / Then was he ware of a knight that stood under a tree and his
horse teyed by him / and the helm of his head / and ever that knight made a
doleful complaynte as ever made knight / And alweyes he made his complaynte of
la Beale Isoud the Queen of Cornewaile / and said A fair lady why love I the /
for thou art fairest of all other / and yet show thou never love to me /
nor bounte / Allas yet must I love the / And I may not blame the fair lady /
for mine eyes ben cause of this sorrow / And yet to love the I am but a fool /
for the best knight of the world loves the / and ye him again / that is sir
Tristram de Lyones And the falsest king and Knight is your husband / and the
most coward and full of treason is your lord king mark Allas that ever so
fair a lady and pyerles of all other should be matched with the most
vylaynous knight of the world / All this langage herd King Mark / what sir
Palomydes said by him / wherefore he was adradde / when he saw sire Dynadan
lest and he aspyed him / that he would tell sire Palomydes that he was King
Mark / and there for he withdrewe him and took his horse and rode to his men
where he commanded hem to abide / And so he rode as fast as he might unto
Camelot / and the same day he fond there Amant the knight ready that before
Arthur had appeled him of treason / and so lyghtely the King commanded them
to do bataile / And by mysauenture king Mark smote Amant thorugh the body /
And yet was Amant in the ryghtuous quarrel And right so he took his horse and
departed from the court for dread of sir Dynadan that he would tell sir
Tristram and sir Palomydes what he was / Then were there maidens / that la
Beale Isoud had sent to sire Tristram that knew sir Amant well

Capitulum xv
Then by the license of King Arthur / they went to him and spak with him /
for while the troncheon of the spear stake in his body / he spak / A fair
damoysels said Amant / recommau^de me unto la Beale Isoud / and tell her that
I am slain for the love of her and of sir Tristram / And there he told the
damoysels how cowardly King Mark had slain him and sire Bersyles his felawe /
And for that deed I appeled him of treason / and here am I slain in a
ryghtuous quarrel / and all was by cause of sir Bersyles and I would not
consent by treason to flee the noble knight sir tristram / Then the two
maidens cried alowde that all the court might here it / and said O sweet lord
Ihesu that know all hid things / why suffrest thou so falls a traitor
to vaynquysshe and slay a true knight that fought in a ryghtuous quarrel /
Then anon hit was spronge to the King and the queen and to all the lords
that it was king Mark that had slain sir Amant / and sire Bersules before hand
/ wherefore they did their bataille / Then was King Arthur wroth out of
mesure / and so were all the other knights

But when sire Tristram knew all the matere / he maade great dole and
sorrow out of mesure / and wept for sorou for the loss of the noble knights
sir Bersyles and of sir Aman^ When sir Lancelot aspyed sir Tristram weep /
he went hastily to King Arthur and said sire I pray you give me leave to
return again to yonder falls king and knight / I pray you said king Arthur
/ fetch him again / but I would not that ye slew him for my worship / Then
sir lancelot armed him in all haste / and mounted upon a great horse / and
took a spear in his hand and rode after king Mark / And from thens a three
mile english / sir lancelot ouertook him / and badde him torn recreaunt
king and knight / For whyder thou will or not thou shall go with me to king
Arthurs Court / King Mark returned and looked upon sir Lancelot / and said
Fair sir what is your name / wete thou well said he my name is sire Lancelot /
and therefore defend the / And when King Mark wiste that it was sire
Lancelot / and came so fast upon him with a spear / he cried then on loud
I yield me to the sir lancelot / honorable Knight / But sire Lancelot would
not here him / but came fast upon him / king Mark saw that / and maade no
defense but tombled adoune out of his sadel to the earth as a sak / and there
he lay stylle / and cried sire lancelot mercy / Arise recreaunt knight and
King / I will not fight said King Mark / But whether that ye will I will
goo with you /

Allas Allas said sire Lancelot that I may not give the one buffet for the
love of sire Trestram and of la Beale Isoud And for the two knights that thou
have slain traitourly / And so he mounted upon his horse and brout him to king
Arthur / and there King Mark alyghte in that same place and threw his helm
from him upon the earth / and his suerd and fylle flat to the earth of king
Arthurs feet and put him in his grace and mercy / So god me help said Arthur
ye are welcome in a manner / and in a manner ye are not welcome / In this manner ye
are welcome that ye come hyder maulgre thy head as I suppose / That is truth
said king Mark / and else I had not ben here / For my lord sir lancelot
brought me hyder through his fine force / and to him am I yolden to as recreaunt
/ Well said Arthur ye understand ye ought to do me seruyse / homage and
feaute / And never would ye do me none / but ever ye have been against me / and
a destroyer of my knights / now / how will ye acquyte you / Sir said King
Mark / Right as your lordship will require me unto my power / I will make a
large amendys / For he was a fair speker and falls there under / Then for
great pleasyr of sir Tristram to make them tweyne accorded / the king withheld
king Mark / as at that time / and made a broken love day bitwene them /

Capitulum xvj
NOw torn we again unto sir Palomydes how sir Dynadan comforted him in all
that he might from his great sorrow / what Knight are ye said sir Palomydes /
sire I am a knight erraunt as ye be that has sought you long by your sheld /
Here is my sheld said sir Palomydes / wete ye well and ye will ought / there
with I will defend hit / Nay said sir Dynadan I will not have adoo with you
/ but in good manner / And if ye will ye shall find me sone ready / Sir said / sir
Dynadan whyder ward ride you this way / By my head said sir Palomydes I wot
not but as fortune ledeth me / Herd ye or saw ye ought of sir Tristram / So
god me help of sir Tristram I both herd and saw / and not / for then we
loved not Inwardly well to gyders / yet at my meschyef sir Tristram rescowed me
from my death / and yet or he and I departed by both our assentes we assigned
a day that we should have met at the stony grane / that merlyon set beside
Camelot / and there to have done bataille to gyders / how be hit I was let
said sir Palomydes that I might not hold my day / the which greueth me sore
/ but I have a large excuse / For I was prisoner with a lord and many other moo
/ and that shall sire Tristram right well understand / yt I brake hit not of
fere of cowardyse / And then sir Palomydes told sir Dynodan the same day that
they should have met / So god me help said sire Dynadan that same day met
sire Lancelot and sir Tristram at the same grave of stone / And there was the
most myghtyest bataille that ever was seen in this land betwyxe two knights /
for they fought more than two hours / And there they both bledde so much
blood / that all men merueyled that ever they might endure hit /

And so at the last by both their assentes they were made friends and sworn
brethren for ever / and no man can Judge the better knight / And now is sir
Tristram made a Knight of the round table / and he sytteth in the sege of the
noble knight sire Marhaus / By my head said sir Palomydes sire Tristram is
far bygger than sir Lancelot / and the hardyer Knight / Have ye assayed
them both said sire Dynadan / I have seen sire Tristram fight said sire
Palomydes / but never sire Lancelot / to my wetynge / But at the fontayne
where sire Lancelot lay on sleep there with one spear he smote down sire
Tristram / and me said Palomydes / but at that time they knew not either other
Fair Knight said sir Dynadan as for sir lancelot and sir Tristram let them
be / for the werst of them will not be lyghly matched of no knights that I
know living / No said sire Palomydes god defend but and I had a quarrel to
the better of them both / I would with as good a will fight with him as with
you

Sire I require you tell me your name and in good feith I shall hold you
company / till that we come to Camelot / and there shall ye have great worship
now at this great turnement for there shall be the Queen Gueneuer / and la
Beale Isoud of Cornewaile / wete you well sire Knight for the love of la Beale
Isoud I will be there and else not / but I will not have adoo in King Arthurs
court / Sir said Dynadan I shall ride with you and do you seruyse / so ye
will tell me your name / Sire ye shall understand my name is sire
palomydes brother to Safere the good and noble Knight / And Sire Segwarydes
and I we be Sarasyns borne of fader and mother / Sire said sire Dynadan I thank
you much / for the tellyng of your name / For I am glad of that I know your
name / and I promise you by the feyth of my body ye shall not be hurt by me
by my will / but rather be auaunced / And thereto will I help you with all my
power I promise you / doubt ye not / And certainly on my life ye shall win
great worship in the Court of King Arthur / And be right welcome / So then
they dressid on their helmes / and put on their sheldes / and mounted upon
their horses / and took the broad way toward Camelot / And then were they
ware of a castle / that was fair and rich / and also passing strong as any
was with in this reame

Capitulum xvij
Sir Palomydes said Dynadan here is a Castle that I know well / and therein
duelleth Queen Morgan le fay King Arthurs sister / And king Arthur gafe her
this Castle / the which he has repented him sythen a thousand times / for
sythen king Arthur and she have been at debate and strife / but this castle
could he never get nor win of her by no manner of engyne / And ever as she
might she made werre on king Arthur / And all dangerous knights she
withholdeth with her for to destroy all these knights that King Arthur
loves / And there shall no Knight pass this way but he must Just with
one knight or with two or with three And if hit hap that King Arthurs knight
be beten / he shall lefe his horse and his harneis / and all that he has / and
hard if that he escape / but that he shall be prisoner /

So god me help said Palomydes this is a shameful customme and a vylaynous
vsaunce for a Queen to use / And namely to make such werre upon her own lord
/ that is called the flower of chyualry that is Christian or hethen / and with
all my heart I would destroy that shameful customme / And I will that all the
world wete she shall have no seruyse of me / And if she send out any
knights / as I suppose she will for to Just they shall have both their
hands full /

And I shall not fail you said sir Dynadan unto my puyssaunce upon my life /
So as they stood on horsbak before the Castle / there came a Knight with a reed
sheld and ij squyers after him / And he came straight unto sire Palomydes the
good Knight / and said to him / Fair and gentyl Knyt erraunt I require the
for the love thou owe unto knyghthode that ye will not have adone here with
these men of this Castle / for this was sire Lamorack that thus said / For I
came hydder to seek this deed / and hit is my request / And therefore I biseche
you knight let me dele / and if I be beten / revenge me / In the name of god
said Palomydes / let see how ye will speed / and we shall behold you / Then
anon came forth a knight of the Castle and proffered to Just with the knyte
with the reed sheld / Anon they encountered to gyders / and he with the reed
shield smote him so hard that he bare him over to the earth / There with anon
came another Knight of the castle / and he was smyten so sore that he avoided
his sadel / And forth with all came the third knight / and the knight with
the reed shield smote him to the earth / Then came sir Palomydes and besought
him that he might help him to Just Fair knight said he unto him suffer me as
at this time to have my will / For and they were twenty knights I shall not
doubt them / And ever there were upon the wallys of the castle many lords and
ladies that cried and said well have ye Iusted knight with the reed shield / But
as soon as the Knight had smyten hem down / his squire took their horses /
and avoided their sadels and brydels of the horses / and turned them in to the
forest / and made the knights / to be kept to the end of the Iustes / Right
so came out of the castle the fourth Knight / and fresshly proferd to Just
with the knight with the reed shield / and he was ready / and he smote him so
hard / that horse and man fell to the earth / and the knights bak brak with
the fall and his neck also / O Ihesu said sir Palomydes that yonder is a
passing good knyt / and the best Iustar that ever I saw / By my head said sir
Dynadan he is as good as ever was sir lancelot or sir Tristram what knight
someuer he be /

Capitulum xviij
Then forth with all came a knight out of the castle with a shield bended
with blak and with white /

And anon the knight with the reed shield and And he encountered so hard /
that he smote the Knight of the Castle thorou the bented shield and through the
body / and brake the horse bak / Fair Knight said sir Palomydes ye have over
much on hand / therefore I pray you let me Just / for ye had need to be
reposed / Why sir said the knight / seem ye that I am weyke and feeble / and sir
me thinks ye profer me wrong and to me shame when I do well enough / I tell
you now as I told you erst / for and they were twenty knytes I shall beat them /
And if I be beten or slain then may ye revenge me / And if ye think that I
be weary / and ye have an appetyte to Just with me / I shall find you
Iustynge enough / Sir said Palomydes I said it not by cause I would Just with
you / but me seems that ye have over much on hand / and therefore and ye were
gentyl said the Knight with the reed sheld ye should not profer me shame /
therefore I require you to Just with me / and ye shall find that I am not weary
/ Sith ye require me said sir palomydes / take keep to your self / Then they
two Knytes came to gyders as fast as their horses might run / and the Knight
smote sir Palomydes so sore on the shield that the spear went in to his side a
great wound and a perilous / And there with all sir Palomydes avoided his
sadel / And that Knight turned unto sir Dynadan / And when he saw him coming
/ he cried a loud and said / sir I will not have ado with you / but for that
he let it not / but came streyghte upon him / So sire Dynadan for shame put
forth his spear and all to sheuerd hit upon the Knight / But he smote sir
Dynadan again so hard that he smote him clean from his sadel / but their
horses he would not suffer his squyers to meddle with / and by cause they were
knights erraunt / Then he dressid him again to the castle and Iusted with
seven knytes moo / and there was none of hem might withstand him / but bare
him to the earth / And of these twelve Knights he slew in plain Iustes four
/ And the eight knights he made them to swear on the cross of a suerd / that
they should never use the euylle custommes of the castle / And when he had made
them to swear that oath / he let them pass / And ever stood the lords and
the ladies on the Castle walls cryeng and saying / knight with the reed
shield ye have merueyllously well done as ever we saw Knight do / And therewith
came a knight out of the Castle unarmed and said / Knight with the reed sheld
over much damage have thou done to us this day / therefore return whyther thou will / for here ar no moo will have adoo with the / for we repent sore that
ever thou came here / for by the is fordone the old customme of this castle /
And with that word he turned again in to the Castle / and shytte the yates /
Then the Knight with the reed sheld turned and called his squyers / and so
past forth on his way and rode a great paas / And when he was past sire
Palomydes went to sir Dynadan and said I had never such a shame of one Knight
that ever I met / And therefore I cast me to ride after him / and to be
revenged with my swerd / for on horsbak I deem I shall get no worship of him
/ Sire Palomydes said Dynadan ye shall not meddle with him by my counceil for
ye shall get no worship of him / and for this cause / ye have seen him this day
have had over much to done and over much travailed / By almyty Ihesu said
Palomydes I shall never be at ease till that I have had adoo with him / Sir said
Dynadan I shall give you my beholdynge / well said Palomydes / then shall ye
see how we shall redress our myghtes So they took their horses of their
varlets / and rode after the Knight with the reed shield / and down in a valey
beside a fontayne they were ware where he was alyghte to repose him / and had
done of his helm / for to drink at the well

Capitulum xix
Then Palomydes rode fast till he came nyghe him / And then he said Knight
remember ye of the shame ye did to me right now at the Castle / therefore dress
the / for I will have adoo with the / Fair knyt said he to Palomydes of me ye
win no worship / for ye have seen this day that I have been travailed sore /
As for that said Palomydes I will not let / for wete ye well I will be revenged
/ well said the knight I may happen to endure you / And there with all he
mounted upon his horse and took a great spear in his hand ready for to Just /
Nay said palomydes I will not Just / for I am sure at Iustynge I get no
price / Fair knight said that Knight It would biseme a knight to Just and to
fight on horsbak ye shall see what I will do said Palomydes / and therewith
he alyghte down upon foot / and dressid his shield before him and pulled out
his swerd / Then the knight with the reed sheld descended down from his
horse / and dressid his sheld before him / and so he drew out his suerd / And
then they came to gyders a soft paas / and wonderly they lasshed to gyders
passing thyck the mou^tenaunce of an hour / or ever they brethed / Then they
tracyd and trauercyd and waxed wonderly wroth / and either behyght other death
/ they hew so fast with their suerdes that they cut in down half their
swerdes / and mayles that the bare flesh in some place stood above their
harneis / And when sir Palomydes beheld his felawes swerd over hylled with his
blood / hit grieved him sore / some while they feigned / some while they struck
as wyld men / But at the last sir Palomydes waxed faynte by cause of his first
wound that he had at castle with a spear / for that wound grieved him
wonderly sore / Fair knight said Palomydes me seems we have assayed either
other passing sore / and if hit may please the / I require the of thy
knyghthode tell me thy name / Sir said the knyt to Palomydes / that is me loath
to do / for thou have done me wrong / and no knyghthode to prefer me bataille
/ considering my great trauaylle / But and thou wolt tell me thy name / I
will tell the mine / Sir said he wete thou well my name is palomydes / A sir ye
shall understand my name is sir Lamorak de galys / sone and heir unto the
good knight and king / king Pellenore / and sir Tor the good knight is my
half brother / When sire Palomydes herd him say so he kneled down and asked
mercy for oultragyously have I done to you this day / consyderyng the great
deeds of arms I have seen you done / shamefully and vnknyghtely I have
required you to do bataille / A sire Palomydes said sir Lamorak / over much
have ye done and said to me / And there with he enbraced him with his both
hands / and said Palomydes the worthy knight in all this land is no better
than ye nor more of prowess / and me repentyd sore that we should fight to
gyders / So it does not me said (...) Palomydes / and yet am I sorer wounded
than ye ben / But as for that I shall soon thereof be hole / But certainly I
would not for the fairest castle in this land / but if thou and I had met for I
shall love you the days of my life before al other knights except my brother
sir Safere / I say the same said sire Lamorak except my brother sir Tor /
Then came sire Dynadan / and he made great joy of sir Lamorak / Then
their squyers dressid both their sheldes and their harneis / and stopped
their wounds / And there by at a pryory they rested them all night /

Capitulum xx
NOw torn we again / when sire Gaynys and sir brandyles with his felawes came
to the Court of king Arthur / they told the king / sir Lancelot and sir
Tristram / how sire Dagonet the fool chaced King Mark through the forest /
and how the strong knight smote* them down al seven with one spear / There
was great laughing and Iapynge at King Mark and at sire Dagonet / But all
these knights could not tell what knyt it was that rescowed king mark Then
they asked king Mark if that he knew him / and he ansuerd and said / he
named him self the Knight that followed the questynge be / and on that name
he sent one of my varlets to a place where was his mother / and when she herd
from whens he came / she made passing great dole and discouerd to my varlet his
name and said / O my dear sone sire Palomydes why wolt thou not see me / and
therefore sir said king mark it is to understand his name is sir Palomydes a
noble knight / Then were all these seven knights glad that they knew his
name / Now torn we again / for on the morn they took their horses both sir
Lamorak / Palomydes Dynada^ with their squyers and varlets till they saw a
fair castle / that stood on a montayne well closed / and thither they rode and
there they fond a knight that hight Galahalt that was lord of that castle / and
there they had great chere and were well eased / Sir Dynadan said sire Lamorak
what will ye do sir said Dynadan / I will to morrow to the court of king
Arthur / By my head said sir Palomydes I will not ride these three days / for
I am sore hurt / and much have I bled And therefore I will repose me here /
Truly said sir Lamorak / and I will abide here with you / And when ye ride /
then will I ride / onles that ye tarry over long / Then will I take mine
horse / therefore I pray you sir Dynadan abide and ride with us / Feythfully said
Dynadan I will not abide for I have such a talent to see sir Tristram that I
may not abide long from him / / A Dynadan said sire Palomydes now do I
understand / that ye love my mortal enemy / and therefore how should I trust you
/ well said Dynadan I love my lord sire Tristram above all other / and him will
I serve and do honor / So shall I said sire Lamorak in all that may lie in my
power / So on the morn sir Dynadan rode unto the court of king Arthur / And
by the way as he rode he saw where stood an erraunt Knight / and made him ready
for to Just / Not so said Dynadan for I have no will to Just / with me
shall ye Just said the knight or that ye pass this way / whether ask ye
Iustes by love or by hate / The knight ansuerd wete ye well / I ask hit for
love and not for hate / hit may well be so said sire Dynadan / but ye profer
me hard love / when ye will Just with me with a sharp spear / But fair
knight said sire Dynadan fythe ye will Just with me / mete with me in the
Court of King Arthur / and there shall I Just with you / Well said the
Knight sithe ye will not Just with me I pray you tell me your name / Sir
knight said he my name is sire Dynadan / A said the Knight / full well know I
you for a good knight and a gentyl / and wete you well I love you hertely /
Then shall here be no Iustes said Dynadan betwix^ us / So they departed /
And the same day he came to Camelot where lay King Arthur / And there he
salewed the King and the queen / sire Lancelot and sire Tristram / and all
the Court was glad of sir Dynadan / for he was gentyl wise and curtrys / and
a good Knight / And in especyal the valiant Knight sir Tristram loved sire
Dynadan passing well above all other knights sauf sir lancelot Then the
king asked sir Dynadan what adventures he had seen / Sire said Dynadan I have
seen many adventures / and of sum king mark knows / but not all / Then
the King herkened sir Dynanadan how he told that sir Palomydes and he were
before the castle of Morgan le fay / and how sir Lamorak took the Iustes before
them / and how he foriusted twelve Knights / and of them four he slew / And
how after he smote down sir Palomydes and me both / I may not believe that
said the king For sir Palomydes is a passing good knight / that is very
truth said sir Dynadan / but yet I saw him better preued hand for hand / And
then he told the king all that batail And how sir Palomydes was more weyker
and more hurt / and more lost of his blood / And without doubt said sir
dynadan had the bataille longer lasted / palomydes had be slain O Ihesu said
King Arthur this is to me a great merueylle Sir said Tristram merueylle ye no
thing thereof / for at mine aduys / there is not a valyaunter knight in the
World living / for I know his might / And now I will say you I was never
so weary of knight but if it were sir lancelot And there is no knight in the
world except sir Lancelot I would did so well as sir Lamorak / So god me help
said the king I would that knight sire Lamorak came to this Court / sir said
Dynadan he will be here in short space / and sir Palomydes both / but I fere
that Palomydes may not yet travail

Capitulum xxj /
Then within three days after the king let make a Iustyng at a pryory / And
there made hem ready many Knights of the round table / For sir Gawayne and his
brethere^ made them ready to Just / But Tristram / Lau^celot nor Dynadan would
not Just / but suffered sir Gawayne for the love of king Arthur with his
brethren to Win the gree if they might / Then on the morn they apparayled
them to Just sir Gawayne and his four brethren / and did there great deeds of
arms / and sir Ector de marys did merueyllously well / But sire Gawayne passed
all that felauship / wherefore king Arthur and all the knights gafe sire
Gawayne the honor at the beginning / Right so king Arthur was ware of a
knight and two squyers / the which came out of a forest side with a sheld
couerd with leder / And then he came slyly and hurtlyd here and there / And
anon with one spear he had smyten down two knights of the round table Then
with his hurtlyng he lost the keuerynge of his sheld then was the king and
all other ware that he bare a reed shield / O Ihesu said King Arthur see
where rydeth a stout Knight he with the reed shield / And there was noise and
cryenge Beware the knight with the reed shield / So within a little while he
had overthrown three brethren of sire Gawayns / So god me help said King
Arthur me seems yonder is the best Iuster that ever I saw / with that he saw
him encountre with sire Gawayne / and he smote him down with so great force
that he made his horse to avoid his sadel / How now said the King sire Gawayne
has a fall / well were me / and I knew what knight he were with the reed
shield / I know him well said Dynadan / but as at this time ye shall not know
his name / By my head said sir Tristram he Iusted better than sir Palomydes /
And if ye list to know his name / wete ye well his name is sir Lamorak de galys
/ As they stood thus talking / sire Gawayne and he encountered to gyders again
/ And there he smote sir Gawayne from his horse / and brysed him sore / And in
the syghte of King Arthur he smote down twenty knights beside sire Gawayne
and his brethren / And so clearly was the price yeuen him as a knight pyerles
/ Then slyly and merueyllously sir Lamorak with drew him from all the
felauship in to the forest side / All this aspyed King Arthur / for his eye
went never from him / Then the King sir Lancelot sir Tristram and sir
dynadan took their hackneis / and rode straight after the good knight sir
Lamorak de galys / And there fond him / And thus said the king / A fair knight
well be ye fond / When he saw the king / he put of his helm and salewed
him / and when he saw sir Tristram / he alyghte down of his horse and ran
to him to take him by the thyes / but sir Tristram would not suffer him / but he
alyghte or that he came / and eyder took other in arms / and made great joy
of other / The king was glad / and also was all the felauship of the round
table / except sire Gawayne and his brethren / And when they wist that he
was sire Lamorak / they had great despyte at him and were wonderly wroth with
him / that he had put him to dishonor that day / Then Gawayn called
pryuely in cou^ceille all his brethren / and to them said thus / Fair
brethren here may ye see whom that we hate / king Arthur loves And whom
that we love he hates / And wete ye well my fair brethren / that this sir
Lamorak will never love us / by cause we slew his fader King Pellenore / for
we demed that he slew our fader King of Orkeney / And for the despyte of
Pellenore sir Lamorak did us a shame to our mother / therefore I will be
revenged / Sir said sir Gawayns brethren / let see how ye will or may be
revenged / and ye shall find us ready / Well said Gawayne hold you stylle and
we shall aspye our time /

Capitulum xxij
NOw pass we our matere / and leave We sire Gawayn and speak of King Arthur
that on a day said unto King Mark / Sir I pray you give me a yefte that I
shall axe you / Sir said King Mark I will give you what someuer ye desire and
hit be in my power / Sire gramercy said Arthur / This I will ask you that ye
will be good lord unto sir Tristram / for he is a man of great honor / and
that ye will take him with you in to Cornewaile / and let him see his friends
/ and there cherysshe him for my sake / Sire said King Mark I promise you by
the feythe of my body and by the feythe that I owe to god and to you I shall
worship him for your sake in all that I can or may / Sir said Arthur / and I
will forgive you all the euylle will that ever I ought you / and so be that
ye swear that upon a book before me / with a good will said King Mark / and
so he there swear upon a boook before him and all his knights / and there with
king Mark and sire Tristram took either other by the hands hard knyt to
gyders / But for all this king mark thought falsely / as it preued after /
for he put sir Tristram in prison / and cowardly would have slain him / Then
soon after king Mark took his leave to ride in to Cornewayl / and sir
Tristram made him ready to ride with him / whereof the most party of the round
table were wroth and heavy / and in especial sir lancelot and sire Lamorak and
sir Dynadan were wroth out of mesure / For well they wist king Mark would slay
or destroy sir Tristram / Allas said Dynadan that my lord sir Tristram shall
depart / and sir Tristram took such sorrow that he was amasyd like a fool /
Allas said sir Lancelot unto king Arthur what have ye done / for ye shall
lose the most man of worship that ever came in to your court It was his own
desire said Arthur / and therefore I might not do with all / for I have done
all that I can and made them at accord / Accord said sir lancelot fie upon
that accord For ye shall here that he shall slay sir Tristram / or put him in
a prison / for he is the most coward and the vylaynst king and knight that is
now living / And there with sire Lancelot departed / and came to king Mark /
and said to him thus Sir king wete thou well the good knight sir Tristram shall
goo with the / Beware I read the of treason / for and thou meschyeue that
knight by any manner of falshede or treson by the feythe I owe to god and to the
order of knyghthode I shall slay the mine own hands / Sir lancelot said the
king over much have ye said to me / and I have sworn and said over largely
before king Arthur in herynge of all his knights / that I shall not sle nor
bitraye him / It were to me over much shame to break my promise / ye say well
said sir Lancelot but ye are called so falls and full of treason that no man man
believe you For soth it is known well wherefore ye came in to this country / and
for none other cause but for slay sir tristram / So with great dole King
Mark and sir Tristram rode to gyders / for hit was by sir Tristrams will and
his means to goo with king Mark and all was for the entente to see la Beale
Isoud / for without the syghte of her sir Tristra^ might not endure

NOw torn we again unto sire Lamorak / and speak we of his brethren / sir
Tor which was king Pellenors first sone and bygoten of Aryes wife the couherd
for he was a bastard and sire Aglouale was his first sone begoten in wedlok /
sire Lamorak / Dornar / Percyuale / these were his sons to in wedlok / So
when king Mark and sire Tristram were departed from the Court / there was
made great dole and sorrow for the departing of sir Tristram Then the king
and his knights made no manner of Joys eyghte days after / And at eyghte
days end there came to the court a knight with a young squire with him / And
when this knight was unarmed / he went to the king and required him to make
the young squire a knight / Of what lygnage is he come said King Arthur /
Sire said the knight he is the sone of king Pellenore that did you sometime good
seruyse / And he is brother unto sir Lamorak de galys the good knight / well
said the king for what cause desire ye that of me that I should make him
knight / wete you well my lord the King that this young squire is brother to me
as well as to sir Lamorak / and my name is Aglauale Sire Aglouale said Arthur
for the love of sire Lamorak and for his faders love he shall be made knight
to morrow / Now tell me said Arthur what is his name / Sire said the Knight
his name is Percyuale de Galys /

So on the morn the king made him knight in Camelott / But the King and
all the knights thought hit would be long or that he preued a good knight
Then at the dinner when the King was set at the table / and every knyt
after he was of prowess / the king commanded him to be set among mean
Knights / and so was sire Percyuale s^tte as the King commanded / Then
was there a maiden in the Queen's court that was come of hyhe blood / and she
was domme and never spak word / Right so she came straight in to the halle / and
went unto sir Percyuale and took him by ye hand and said a loud that the king
and all the knights might here hit / Arise sir Percyuale the noble Knight and
gods knight and go with me / and so he did / And there she brought him to
the right side of the sege perilous / And said Fair knight take here thy sege
/ for that sege apperteyneth to the and to none other / Right so she departed
and asked a priest / And as she was confessid and houseld then she dyed /
Then the king and all the court made great joy of sir Percyuale

Capitulum xxiiij
NOw torn we unto sir Lamorak that much was there preysed / Then by the
mean of sir Gawayn and his brethren / they sent for her mother there besides
fast by a Castle beside Camelot / and all was to that entente to slay sir
Lamorak / The Queen of Orkeney was there but a while but sir Lamorak wist of
their being / and was full feign / and for to make an end of this matere he
sent unto her / and there betwixe them was a night assygned that sir Lamorak
should come to her / Thereof was ware sire Gaherys / and there he rode before the
same night and waited upon sire Lamorak / and then he saw where he came all
armed / and where sire Lamorak alyghte / he t^yed his horse to a preuy posterne
/ and so he went in to a palour and unarmed him / And then he went unto the
Queen's bed / and she made of him passing great Joy and he of her again /
for either loved other passing sore / So when the Knight sir Gaherys / saw
his time / he came to their beds side all armed with his swerd naked / and
suddenly gat his mother by the here and struck of her hed^ / when sir Lamorak
saw the blood dasshe upon him all hot / the which he loved passing well /
wete you well he was sore abashed and desmayed of that dolorous knight / And
there with all sir Lamorak lepte out of the bed in his sherte as a knight
desmayed saying thus A sire Gaherys knight of the table round foul and euylle
have ye done and to you great shame Allas why have ye slain your mother that
bare you with more right ye should have slain me / The offense have thou ^o^e
said Gaherys not withstanding a man is borne to offer his seruyse / but yet
sholdest thou beware with whom thou medlest / for thou have put me and my
brethren to a shame / and thy fader slew our fader / and thou to lie by our
mother is to much shame for us to suffer / And as for thy fader king Pellenore
my brother sir Gawayne and I slew him / ye did him the more wrong said sire
Lamorak / For my fader slew not your fader / it was Balyn le saueage / and as
yet my faders death is not revenged / leave tho words said sir Gaherys / For
and thou speak felonsly I will slay the / But by cause thou art naked I am
ashamed to slay the / but wete thou well / in what place I may get the / I
shall slay the / and now my mother is quyte of the / and withdraw the / and
take thyn armor that thou were gone / Sire Lamorak saw there was none other
bote but fast armed him and took his horse and rode his way making great sorrow
/ But for the shame and doloure he would not ride to king Arthurs Court / but
rode another way / But when hit was known that Gaherys had slain his mother /
the king was passing wroth and commanded him to goo out of his court /
wete ye well sire Gawayn was wroth that Gaherys had slain his mother / and let
sire Lamorak escape / And for this matere was the king passing wro^^e and so
was sir Lamorak and many other knights Sir said sir Lancelot here is a great
meschyef befallen by felony / and by fore cast treason that your sister is thus
shamefully slain / And I dare say that it was wroute by treson And I dare
say ye shall lose that good Knight sir Lamorak the which is great pity / I
wot well and am sure and sir Tristram wyste hit / he would never more come
within your court / the which should grieve you much more and all your
knights / God defend said the noble King Arthur that I should lose sire
Lamorak or sir Tristram / for then tweyne of my chyef knights of the table
round were gone / Sire said sire Lau^celot I am sure ye shall lose sir
Lamorak for sir Gawayne and his brethren will sle him / by one mean or other
/ for they among them have concluded and sworn to slay him and ever they may
see their time / That shall I let said Arthur

Capitulum xxv
NOw leave we of sire Lamorak / and speak of sire Gawayns brethren and
specially of sir Agrauayne and sire Mordred as they rode on their adventures
they met with a Knight fleing sore wounded / and they asked him what
tidings / Fair Knights said he here comes a knight after me that will slay
me / with that came sire Dynadan riding to them by adventure / but he would
promise them no help But sir Agrauayne and sire Mordred promised him to rescowe
him / There with all came that knight straight unto them And anon he proferd
to Just / That saw sire Mordred and rode to him but he struck Mordred over
his horse tail

That saw sire Agrauayn and streyghte he rode toward that knight / And right
so as he served Mordred so he served Agrauayne / and said to them / Syrs wete
ye well both that I am Breuse saunce pity that has done this to you / And yet
he rode over Agrauayne five or six times /

When Dynadan saw this / he must needs Just with him for shame / And so
Dynadan and he encountered to gyders / that with pure strength sir Dynadan
smote him over his horse tail / Then he took his horse and fled / for he was
on foot one of the valyauntest knights in Arthurs days / and a great
destroyer of all good knights / Then rode sir Dynadan unto sir Mordred and
unto sir Agrauayne / Sire knight said they all well have ye done / and well have
ye revenged us / wherefore we pray you tell us your name / Fair sirs ye out
to know my name the which is called sire Dynadan / When they understood
that it was Dynadan / they were more wroth than they were before / for they
hated him out of mesure by cause of sir Lamorak / For Dynadan had such a
custom that he loved all good Knights that were valiant / and he hated al
tho that were destroyers of good knights / And there were none that hated
Dynadan but tho that ever were called murderers Then spack the hurt knight
that Breuse saunce pity had chaced / his name was Dalan / and said if thou be
Dynadan / thou slewest my fader / Hit may well be so said Dynadan / but then
it was in my defense and at his request / By my head said Dalan thou shall dye
therefore / and there with he dressid his spear and his shield / And to make the
shorter tale sire Dynadan smote him down of his horse that his neck was ny
broken / And in the same wise he smote sire Mordred and sir Agrauayne / And
after in the quest of the Sa^egreal cowardly and felloynsly they flewe Dynadan
/ the which was great damage / for he was a great bourder and a passing good
knight And so sire Dynadan rode to a Castle that hight Beale valet / And there
he fond sire Palomydes that was not yet hole of the wound that sir Lamorak gaf
him / And there Dynadan told Palomydes all the tidings that he herd and saw
of sire Tristram / and how he was gone with king Mark / and with him he has
all his will and desire / There with sire Palomydes waxed wroth / for he
loved la Beale Isoud / And then he wyste well that sire Tristram enjoyed her

Capitulum xxvj
NOw leave we sire Palomydes and sire Dynadan in the castle of Beale valet / and
torn we again unto king Arthur / There came a Knight out of Cornewail his
name was Fergus / a felawe of the round table / And there he told the King and
sir Lancelot good tidings of sir Tristram / and there were brought goodly
letters / and how he left him in the castle of Tyntagil

Then came the damoysel that brought goodly letters unto king Arthur and
unto sire lancelot / and there she had passing good chere of the King and
of the Queen Gueneuer and of sire Lancelot / Then they wrote goodly letters
again / But fire Lau^celot badde ever sire Tristram beware of king Mark /
for ever he called him in his letters King Fox / As who says / he fares
all with wyles and treason / whereof sire Tristram in his heart thanked sire
Lau^celot Then the Damoysel went unto la Beale Isoud and bare her letters
from the King and from sire Lancelot / whereof she was in passing great Joy

Fair damoysel said la Beale Isoud / how fares my Lord Arthur and the Queen
Gweneuer / and the noble knyt sir Lancelot / she ansuerd and to make short
tale / much the better that ye and sire Tristram ben in Joy /

God reward them said la beale Isoud / for sir Tristram suffers great pain
for me and I for him / So the damoysel departed and brought letters to King
Mark / And when he had read them / and understood them / he was wroth with
sir Tristram / for he demed that he had sent the damoysel unto King Arthur /
For Arthur and Lancelot in a manner threted king mark / And as King mark read
these letters / he demed treson by sir Tristram / Damoysel said King mark /
will ye ride again and bear letters from me unto King Arthur / sir she said
I will be at your commandment to ride when ye will / ye say well said the
King / come again said the King to morn / and fetch your letters / Then
she departed / and told them how she should ride again with letters unto Arthur
Then we pray you said la beale Isoud and sir Tristram that when ye have
received your letters / that ye would come by us that we may see the pryuete of
your letters / All that I may do madame ye wot well I must do for sir Tristram
for I have been long his own maiden / So on the morn the damoysel went to
king mark to have had his letters and to depart / I am not auysed said king
mark as at this time to send my letters / Then pryuely and secretly he
sent letters unto king Arthur and unto Queen Queneuer / and unto sir lancelot
/ So the varlet departed / and fond the King and the Queen in walys at Carlyon
/ And as the king and the Queen were at mass the varlet came with the letters
/ And when mass was done the king and the Queen opened the letters pryu^^^^
by them self / And the beginning of the kings letters (...) wonderly short
unto King Arthur / and badde him entermete with him self and with his wife /
and of his knights / For he was able enough to rule and keep his wife

Capitulum xvij
When king Arthur understood the letter / he musyd of many things / and
thout on his systers words queen Morgan le fay that she had said betwixe queen
gueneuer and sir Lancelot / And in this thought he studied a great while /
Then he bethought him again how his sister was his own enemy / and that she
hated the Queen and sir lancelot / and so he put all that out of his
thought

Then King Arthur read the letter again / and the latter clause said that
King Mark took sire Tristram for his mortal enemy / wherefore he put Arthur
out of doubt he would be reuengyd of sir Tristram / Then was king Arthur
wroth with king Mark / And when queen Gueneuer read her letter and
understood hit / she was wroth out of mesure / for the letter spak shame by
her / and by sir lancelot / And so pryuely she sent the letter unto sir
Lancelot / And when he wyste the intent of the letter / he was so wroth
that he leyd him down on his bed to sleep / whereof sir Dynadan was ware /
for hit was his manner to be preuy with all good knights / And as sire
lancelot slepte he stale the letter out of his hand and red it word by word /
And then he made great sorrow for anger / and so sir Lancelot awaked / and
went to a wyndowe / and read the letter again / the which maade him angry /
Sire said Dynadan wherefore be ye angry / discover your heart to me / For sothe
ye wot well I owe you good will / how be hit I am a pour knight and a
seruytour unto you and to all good knights / For though I be not of worship
my self I love all tho that been of worship / It is troth said sir Lancelot /
ye are a trusty knight / and for great trust I will show you my counceylle /
And when Dynadan understood all / he said this is my counceyl / Set you
right naught by these thretys / For king mark is so vylaynous / that by
fair speech shall never man get of him / But ye shall see what I shall do
/ I will make a lay for him / and when hit is made I shall make an harper to
sing hit before him / So anon he went and made hit / and taught hit an
harper that hight Elyot / And when he could hit / he taught hit to many
harpers And so by the will of sire Lancelot and of Arthur the harpers went
streyghte in to walys / and in to Cornewaile to sing the lay that sire
Dynadan made by king Mark / the which was the werste lay that ever harper
sange with harp or with any other Instrumentys

NOw torn we again unto sire Tristram and to King Mark / As sir Tristram was
at Iustes and at turnement / hit fortuned he was sore hurt both with a spear
and with a swerd / but yet he wanne alweyes the degree And for to repose him /
he went to a good knight that duelled in Cornewaile in a Castle whose name was
Sir Dynas le Seneschall / Then by mysfortune there came out of Sessoyne a
great nombre of men of arms / and an hydous host / and they entered nyghe the
castle of Tyntagyl / and her Capytayns name was Elyas a good man of arms /
When King Mark understood his enemies were entered in to his land / he maade
great dole and sorrow / for in no wise by his will king Mark would not send for
sir Tristram for he hated him dedely / So when his counceill was come / they
devised and cast many peryls of the strength of her enemies / And then they
concluded all at ones and said thus unto king Mark / Sir wete ye well ye must
send for sire Tristram the good knight or else they will never be overcome /
For by sire Tristram they must be foughten with all / or else we row against
the streme Well said King Mark I will do by your counceylle / but yet he was
full both there to / but need constrained him to sonde for him / Then was he
sent for in all have that myte be that he should come to King Mark / And
when he understood that King Mark had sent for him / he mounted upon a
soft ambuler and rode to King Mark / And when he was come / the King said
thus / Fair neuewe sir Tristra^ this is all / Here be come our enemies of
Sessoyne / that are here nyghe hand / and without taryenge they must be met
with shortly or else they will destroy this country / Sir said sir Tristram
wete ye well all my power is at your commandment / And wete ye well sire /
these eight days I may bear none arms for my wounds ben not yet hole / And
by that day I shall do what I may / ye say well said king Mark / Then goo
ye again and repose you and make you fresshe And I shall go and mete the
Sessoyns with all my power So the King departed unto Tyntagyl and sir
Tristram went to repose him / and the King made a great host and departed them
in three / The first part led sir Dynas the Seneschall and sir Andred led
the second part / and sir Arguys led the third part / and he was of the
blood of King Mark / and the Sessoyns had three great batails / and many good
men of arms / And so King Mark by the advise of his Knights issued out of
the Castle of Tyntagyl upon his enemies And Dynas the good knight rode out
before / and slew ij Knights his own hands / and then began the batayls
/ And there was merueyllous brekyng of speres and smytyng of suerdes / and
slew down many good knights / And ever was sir Dynas the Seneschal the best
of King Marks party / And thus the bataille endured long with great mortalyte
But at the last King Mark and sire Dynas were they never so loathe they
withdrewen hem to the castle of Tyntagyll / with great slaughter of people / and
the Sessoyns followed on fast / that ten of them were put within the gates and
four slain with the port coloyse / Then King Mark sent for sire Tristram
by a varlet that told him all the mortalyte /

Then he sent the varlet again and bad him tell King Mark that I will
come as soon as I am hole / for erste I may do him no good / Then King
Mark had his ansuer / There with came Elyas and badde the King yield up the
castle / for ye may not hold it no while / Sir Elyas said the king so will I
yield up the castle if I be not soon rescowed / Anon King Mark sent again
for rescowe to sir tristram / By then sir Tristram was hoole / and he had
gotten him ten good Knights of Arthurs / And with hem he rode unto Tyntagyl /
And when he saw the great host of Sessoyns he merueylled wonder gretely /
And then sir Trystram rode by the woods and by the dyches as secretly as he
might till he came nyghe the gatys / And there dressid a Knight to him / when
he saw that sir Tristram would enter and sir tristram smote him down deed /
And so he served three mo / And eueryche of these ten knights slew a man of
arms / So sir tristram entryd in to the castle of Tyntagyl / And when king
Mark wist that sir Tristram was come he was glad of his coming / and so was
all the felaushyp / and of him they made great Joy

Capitulum xxix
So on the morn Elyas the capytayne came / and bad king Mark come out /
and do bataille / for now the good knight sir Tristram is entryd / It will
be shame to the said Elyas for to keep thy walls / when king Mark understood
this / he was wroth and said no word / but went unto sir Tristram and axed him
his counceyl / Sire said sir Tristram will ye that I give him his ansuer / I
will well said King Mark / Then sir Tristram said thus to the messagere
Bear thy lord word from the king and me that we will do batail with him to
morn in the plain field / what is your name said the messager / wete thou well
/ my name is sir Trystram de Lyones / There with all the messager departed and
told his lord Elyas all that he had herd / Sir said sire Tristram unto King
Mark I pray you give me leave to have the rule of the bataill / I pray you
take the rule said king mark Then sire Tristram let deuyse the bataille in
what manner that it should be / He let depart his host in six parties / and
ordained sir Dynas the Seneschal to have the fore ward / and other knights to
rule the remenaunt / And the same night sire Tristram burnt all the Sessoyns
ships unto the cold water / Anon as Elyas wist that he said hit was of sir
Tristrams doing / for he casts that we shall never escape mother sone of us
/ Therefore fair felawes fight freely to morrow / and myscomforte you naught
for any knyt though he be the best knight in the world / he may not have a do
with us all /

Then they ordained their batails in four parties wonderly well apparailled
and garnysshed with men of arms Thus they within issued / and they without
set freely upon them / and there sir Dynas did great deeds of arms / not for
then sir Dynas and his felauship were put to the werse / with that came sire
Tristram and slew two Knights with one spear / then he slew on the right
hand and on the lift hand / that men merueylled that ever he might do such
deeds of arms / And then he might see sometime the bataille was driven a bow
draughte from the castle / and sometime it was at the gates of the Castle /
Then came Elyas Capytayne rashynge here and there / and hytte king Mark so
sore upon the helm that he made him to avoid the sadel / And then sir Dynas
gate king Mark again to horsbak / There with all came in sir Tristram like a
lion / and there he met with Elyas / and he smote him so sore upon the helm
that he avoided his sadel / And thus they fought till it was night / and for
great slauter and for wounded people eueryche party drew to their rest / And
when king Mark was come within the castle of Tyntagyl / he lacked of his
knights an honderd and they without lacked two honderd / and they serched the
wounded men on both parties / And then they went to counceil / and wete you
well either party were loathe to fight more / so that either might escape with
their worship

When Elyas the capytayn understood the death of his men / he made great dole /
And when he wist that they were loathe to goo to bataille again / he was wroth
out of mesure / Then Elyas sent word unto King Mark in great despyte
whether he would find a Knight that would fight for him / body for body / And
if that he might slay King Marks knight / he to have the truage of Corn
Wail yearly / And if that his knight slay mine / I fully releece my claim for
ever Then the messager departed unto King Mark and told him how that his
lord Elyas had sent him word to find a Knight to do bataille with him body
for body / when king Mark understood the messagyer he badde him abide / and
he should have his ansuer / Then called he all the Baronage to gyder to wete
what was the best counceyll / They said all at ones to fight in a field we
have no lust / for had not ben sir Tristrams prowess / hit had been lykely that
we never should have escaped / And therefore sir as we deem / hit were well done to
find a knyt that would do batail with him for he knytly profereth

Capitulum xxx
NOt for then when all this was said / they could find no Knight that would
do bataille with him / Sire king said they all / here is no knight that dare
fight with Elyas / Allas said king Mark then am I utterly ashamed and
utterly destroyed / onles that my neuewe sire Tristram will take the bataille
upon him / wete you well they said all he had yesterday over much on hand /
and he is weary for trauaille / and sore wounded / where is he said King mark
Sir said they he is in his bed to repose him / Allas said king Mark / but I
have the socoure of my neuewe sir Tristram I am utterly destroyed for ever /
There with one went to sir Tristram there he lay and told him what king Mark
had said / And there with sire Tristram aroos lyghtely / and putt on him a
long gown / and came before the King and all the lords / And when he saw hem
all so desmayed / he asked the King and the lords what tidings were with
hem / Never werse said the King / And there with he told him all how he had
word of Elyas to find a knyt to fight for the truage of Cornewail / and none
can I find / And as for you said the king and all the lords we may ask no
more of you for shame / For through your hardynes yesterday ye saved all your
lives / Sire said sir Tristram now I understand ye would have my socour /
reason would that I should do all that lies in my power to do / saving my
worship / and my life / how be hit I am sore brysed and hurt / And sythen sir
Elyas profereth so largely / I shall fight with him or else I will be slain
in the field / or else I will deliver Cornewaile from the old truage / And
therefore lyghtely call his messager and he shall be ansuerd / for as yet my
wounds ben grene and they will be sorer a seven night after than they ben now
/ And there for he shall have his ansuere / that I will do bataill to morn
with him / Then was the messager departed brought before king Mark / Herke
my felawe said sir Tristram goo fast unto thy lord and bydde him make true
assurance on his party / for the truage / as the king here shall make on his
party / and then tell thy lord sir Elyas that I sir Tristram king Arthurs
knight / and knight of the table round / will as to morn mete with thy lord
on horsbak / to do batail as long as my horse may endure / And after that to
do bataille with him on foot to the vtteraunce / the messager beheld sire
Tristram from the top to the too / And there with all he departed and came to
his lord and told him how he was ansuerd of sir Tristram / And there with all
was made hostage on both parties / and made hit as sure as hit might be /
that whether party had the vyctory / so to end / And then were both hosts
assembled on both parties of the field / without the castle of Tyntagyl / and
there was none but sir Tristram and sir Elyas armed / So when the poyntement
was made they departed in sonder / and they came to gyders with all the might
that their horses might run / And either knight smote other so hard that
both horses and knights went to the earth / Not for then they both
lyghtely aroos and dressid their sheldes on their sholders with naked swerdes
in their hands / and they dasshed to gyders that hit seemed a flammynge fire
about them / Thus they tracyd and trauercyd and hew on helmes and hawberkes /
and cut away many cantels of their sheldes / and either wounded other
passing sore / so that the hot blood fell fresshly upon the earth / And by
then they had foughten the mountenaunce of an hour / sir Tristram waxte
faynte and forbledde / and gaf sore a bak / That saw sire Elyas / and followed
fyersly upon him / and wounded him in many places / And ever sire Tristram
tracyd and trauercyd / and went froward him here and there / and couerd him
with his shield as he might all weykely / that all men said he was overcome
/ For sir Elyas had given him twenty strokes against one / Then was there
laughyng of the Sessoyns party and great dole on King Markys party / Allas
said the King We are ashamed and destroyed all for ever / for as the book
says sir Tristram was never so matched but if it were sir lancelot / Thus as
they stood and beheld both parties / that one party laughing and the other
party weeping / Sire Tristram remembryd him of his lady la beale Isoud that
looked upon him / And how he was lykely never to come in her presence / Then
he pulled up his shield that erst henge full low / And then he dressid up his
shield unto Elyas / and gaf him many sad strokes twenty against one and all
to brake his shield and his hauberk / that the hot blod ran down to the
earth / Then began king Mark to laughe and all Cornysshe men / and that
other party to weep / And ever sir Tristram said to sir Elyas yield the /
Then when sir Tristram saw him so stakkerynge on the ground he said sir
Elyas I am right sorry for the / for thou art a passing good knight as ever I
met with all except sire Lancelot / there with all sir Elyas fylle to the
earth / and there dyed / what shall I do said sir Tristram unto King mark
for this bataille is at an end / Then they of Elyas party departed / and
king Mark took of hem many prisoners to redress the harms and the scathes
that he had of them / and the remenaunt he sent in to their country to borowe
out their felawes / Then was sire Tristram serched and well helyd / yet for
all this King Mark would feign have slain sir Tristram / But for all that
ever sire Tristram saw or herd by king Mark yet would he never beware of his
treason / but ever he would be there as la Beale Isoud was

NOw will we pass of this matter / and speak we of the harpers that sir
Lancelot and sir Dynadan had sent in to Cornewaile / And at the great feast
that king mark made for Joy that the Sessoyns were put out of his Country

brought hit unto sir Tristram and told him the lay that Dynadan had made by
king Mark / And when sir Tristram herd hit / he said O lord Ihesu that
Dynadan can make wonderly well and ylle / there as it shall be / Sir said Elyas
dare I sing this song before King Mark / ye on my peril said sire Tristram
/ for I shall be thy waraunt / Then at the mete came in Elyas the harper /
and by cause he was a curyous harper men herd him sing the same lay that
Dynadan had made / the which spak the most vylony by King Mark of his
treason / that ever man herd / when the harper had song his song to the end
/ king Mark was wonderly wroth And said / thou harper how durst thou be so
bold on thy heed to sing this song before me / Sir said Elyas wete you well I
am a mynstrel / and I must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear
the arms of / And sire wete ye well that sir Dynadan a knight of the table
round made this song / and made me to sing hit before you / Thou say well
said king Mark And by cause thou art a mynstral / thou shall go quyte / but
I charge the hyhe the fast out of my syghte / So the harper departed and
went to sir Tristram and told him how he had sped / Then sire Tristram let
make / letters as goodely as he could to lancelot and to sire Dynadan / And
so he let conduyte the harper out of the country / but to say yt King Mark

NOw torn we to another matter that fell bitwene king Mark and his brother
that was called the good prince Bodwyne that all the people of the country
loved passing well / So hit befelle on a time that the mescreaunts Sarasyns
londed in the countreye of Corn Wail soon after these Sessoyns were gone /
And then the good prince Boudwyne at the landynge he areysed the country
pryuely and hastly / And or hit were day / he let put wild fire in three of
his own ships / and suddenly he pulled up the ^ayle / And with the wind he
made tho ships to be driven among the nauye of the Sarasyns / And to make
short tale tho three ships set on fire all the ships that none were saved
/ And at point of the day the good prince Boudwyn with all his felauship
set on the mescreauntes with shoutes and cries and slew to the nombre of xl
/ M / and left none on live / when king Mark wist this he was wonderly
wroth that his brother should win such worship / And by cause this prince was
better byloued than he in all that country / And that al so Boudwyn loved well
sir Tristram / therefore he thought to slay him And thus hastly as a man out
of his wit he sent for prince boudwyn / and Anglides his wife / and bad them
bring their young sone with them that he might see him / All this he did to
the entente to slay the child as well as his fader / for he was the falsest
traitor that ever was borne / Allas for his goodenes and for his good deeds
this gentyl prince Boudwyn was slain / So when he came with his wife Anglydes
the King made them fair semblaunt till they had dyned / And when they had
dyned / King Mark sent for his brother and said thus / Brother how spedde you
when the mescreaunts aryued by you / me seems hit had be your part to have
sent me word that I might have been at that Iourneye for it had been reason that
I had had the honor and not you Sire said the Prince Boudwyn it was so that
and I had tarried till that I had sent for you / tho myscreauntes had
destroyed my country / Thou lie falls traitor said King Mark / for thou
art ever about for to win worship from me / and put me to dishonor / and
thou cheryst that I hate / And there with he stroke him to the heart with a
daggar / that he never after spoke word / Then the lady Anglydes made great
dole and swouned / for she saw her lord slain before her face / Then was
there no more to do but prince Boudwyn was despoylled and brought to buryels /
But Anglydes pryuely gat her husbands dobblet and his sherte / and that she
kept secretly / Then was there much sorrow and cryenge / and great dole
made sir Tristram / sir Dynas / sir Fergus / and so did all knights that were
there / for that prince was passyngly well byloued / So la Beale Isoud sent
unto Anglydes the prince Boudwyns wife and badde her avoid lytely or else her
young sone Alysander le Orphelyn should be slaye / when she herd this / she
took her horse and her child / and rode with such pour men as durst ride with

more vengeance / and with his swerd in his hand / he sought from chamber to
chamber to seek Anglydes and her young sone / And when she was myste / he
called a good knight that hyghte Sadok / and charged him by pain of death to
fetch Anglydes again / and her young sone / So sire Sadok departed / and rode
after Anglydes / And within ten mile he ouertoke her / and badde her torn

shall ye win by my sons death or by mine / I have had over much harm and
to great a loss / Madame said Sadok / of your loss is dole and pity / but
madame said Sadok would ye depart out of this country with your sone / and
keep him till he be of age / that he may revenge his faders death / then would
I suffer you to depart from me / So ye promise me to revenge the death of
prince Boudwyn / A gentyl knight Ihesu thank the / and if ever my sone
Alysander le Orphelyn live to be a knight / he shall have his faders dobblet and
his shert with the blody marks / and I shall give him such a charge that he
shall remember hit whiles he lives / And there with all Sadok departed from
her / and either by took other to god And when Sadok came to king Ma^ke he told
him feythfully that he had drouned young Alysander her sone / and thereof king
Mark was full glad / Now torn we unto Anglydes that rode both night and
day by adventure out of Corn Wail / and lytyl and in few places she rested
/ but ever she drew southward to the sea side / till by fortune she came to a
castle that is called Magouns / and now hit is called Arundel in southsex / and
the Conestable of the castle welcomed her and said she was welcome to her own
castle / and there was Anglydes worshipfully received / for the Conestables wife
was nyghe her cosyn / and the Conestables name was Belangere / and that same
Conestable told Anglydes that the same Castle was hers by right enherytaunce /
Thus Anglydes endured years and wynters till Alysander was bygge and strong /
there was none so wight in all that Country / neither there was none that
might do no manner of maystry before him /

Then upon a day Bellangere the Conestable came to Anglydes and said Madame
it were time my lord Alysander were made knyt / for he is a passing strong
young man / Sire said she I would he were made knight / But then must I give
him the most charge that ever synful mother gaf to her child / Do as ye list
said Bellangere / and I shall give him warning that he shall be maade knight
/ Now hit will be well done that he may be made knight at our lady day in lent
/ Be hit so said Anglydes / and I pray you make ready therefore / So came the
Conestable to Alysander and told him that he should at our lady in lent be
made knight / I thank god said Alysander these are the best tidings that
ever came to me / Then the Conestable ordained twenty of the grettest
gentylmens sons and the best born men of the country that should be maade
knights that same day that Alysander was made knight / So on the same day
that Alysander and his twenty felawes were made Knights / at the offrynge of

sire Sadok from chamber to chamber to slay him / When sir Sadok saw king
Mark come with his suerd in his hand / he said thus / Beware King Mark and
come not nyghe me / for wete thou well that I saved Alysander his life / of
which I never repent me / for thou falsely and cowardly slew his fader
Boudwyn traytourly for his good deeds / wherefore I pray almighty Ihesu send
Alysander might and strength to be reuengyd upon the / and now beware King
Mark of young Alysander / for he is made a knight / Alas said King Mark
that ever I should here a traitor say so before me / And there with four
Knights of king Marks drew their swerdes to slay sire Sadok / but anon
sir Sadok slew hem all in King Marks presence / And then sire Sadok past
forth in to his chamber / and took his horse and his harneis / and rode on his
way a good paas / For there was neither sire Tristram / neither sire Dynas nor
sire Fergus that would sir Sadok any euylle will / Then was King Mark
wroth / and thought to destroy sire Alysander and sire Sadok that had saved
him / for king Mark dredde and hated Alisander most of any man living
when sir Tristram understood that Alysander was made knight / Anon forth
with all he sent him a letter prayenge him and chargynge him that he would
draw him to the Court of King Arthur / and that he put him in the rule and
in the hands of sire Lancelot

So this letter was sent to Alysander from his cosyn sir Tristram / And at
that time he thought to do after his commandment / Then king Mark called
a knight that brought him the tidings from Alysander / and badde him abide
stylle in that country / Sire said that knight so must I do / for in mine
own country I dare not come / No force said King Mark / I shall give the
here double as much lands as ever thou had of thine own / But within

King Mark wode wroth out of mesure Then he sent unto Queen Morgan le fay

sorceresses would set all the country in fire with ladies that were
enchauntresses / And by such that were dangerous knights as Malgryn Breuse

NOw torn we again unto sire Alysander that at his departing his mother took

So was Alysander purposed to ride to london by the cou^ceille of sire
Tristram to sire Lancelot / And by fortune he went by the sea side / and rode
wrong / and there he wanne at a turnement the gree / that King Carados made /
And there he smote down King Carados and twenty of his knights and also sire
Safere a good knight that was sire Palomydes brother the good knight / All this
saw a damoysel / and saw the best knight Just that ever he saw / And ever
as he smote down knights / he made them to swear to were none harneis in a
twelve monethe and a day / This is well said / said Morgan le fay / this is the
knight that I would feign see / And so she took her palfroy and rode a great
while / and then she rested her in her pauelione / So there came four
knights two were armed and two were unarmed / and they told Morgan le fay
their names / the first was Elyas de gomeret / the second was Card Gomoret /
tho were armed / that other tweyne were of Camylyard / cosyns unto Queen
Gueneuer / and that one hit Guy / and that other hight Garau^t tho were unarmed
/ There these four Knights told Morgan le fay how a young knight had smyten
them down before a Castle / For the maiden of that Castle said that he was but
late made knight and young / But as we suppose but if hit were sire Tristram
or sire Lancelot or sire Lamorak the good kny there is none that myt sytte him
a buffet with a spear / well said Morgan le fay I shall mete that knight or it
be long time / and he dwell in that country

So torn we to the damoysell of the Castle that when Alysander le Orphelyn
had fori^sted the four Knights she called him to her and said thus / Sire
knight wolt thou for my sake Just and fight with a knight for my sake of
this country that is and has been long time an evil neighbor to me / his
name is Malgryne / and he will not suffer me to be married in no manner wise for
all that I can do / or any knight for my sake /

Damoysel said Alysander and he come whiles I am here I will fight with him /
and my pour body for your sake I will Ieoparde / And there with all she
sent for him / for he was at her commandment / And when either had a
syghte of other / they made hem ready for to Just / and they came to gyder
egerly / and Malgryn brysed his spear upon Alysander / and alisander smote him
again so hard that he bare him quyte from his sadell to the earth / But this
Malgryne aroos lightly and dressid his sheld and drew his suerd / and badde
him alyte / saye^g thou thou have the better of me on horsbak thou shall find
that I shall endure like a knight on foot It is well said said Alysander / and
so lightly he avoided his horse and bitoke him to his varlet / And then they
rasshed to gyders like two bores and leyd on their helmes and sheldes long
time by the space of three hours that never man could say which was the
better Knight

And in the mean while came Morgan le fay to the damoysel of the Castle / and
they beheld the bataylle / But this malgryne was an old roted Knight / and he
was called one of the dangerous knights of the world to do bataille on foot
but on horsbak there were many better / And ever this Malgryne awayted to slay
Alysander / and so wounded him wonderly sore / that it was merueylle that ever
he might stand / for he had bledde so much blood / for Alysander fought
wyldly and not wyttely / And that other was a felonous knyte and awayted him /
and smote him sore / And sometime they rasshed to gyders with their sheldes like
two bores or rams and fylle grouelynge both to the earth /

Now knight said Malgryn hold thy hand a while / and tell me what thou art /
I will not said Alysander / but if me list / But tell me thy name / and why
thou kepest this country / or else thou shall dye of my hands / wete thou well
said Malgryne that for this maidens love of this Castle I have slain ten good
knights by myshap / and by outerage and orgulyte of my self I have slain ten
other knights / So god me help said Alysander this is the fowlest confession
that ever I herd knight make / nor never herd I speak of other men of such a
shameful confession / wherefore hit were great pity and great shame unto me that
I should let the live any longer / therefore keep the as well as ever thou may
/ for as I am true knight either thou shalt slay me or else I shall slay the /
I promise the feythfully

Then they lasshed to gyders fyersly / And at the last Alysander smote
Malegryne to the earth / And then he racyd of his helm / and smote of his
head lyghtely /

And when he had done and ended this bataille / anon he called to him his
varlet the which brought him his horse And then he wenyng to be strong ynou
would have mounted And so she leyd sire Alysander in an horse lyttar and led
him in to the Castle / for he he had no foot ne myt to stand upon the earth /
for he had syxtene great wounds / and in especyal one of them was like to be
his death /

Capitulum xxxvij
Then Queen Morgan le fay serched his wounds / and gaf such an oynement
unto him that he should have dyed / And on the morn when she came to him he
camplayned him sore / And then she put other oynements upon him / And then
he was out of his pain / Then came the damoysel of the Castle and said unto
Morgan le fay / I pray you help me that this Knight might wedde me / for he
has won me with his hands / ye shall see said Morgan le fay what I shall
say Then Morgan le fay went unto Alysander and bad in any wise that he
should refuse this lady and she desire to wedde you / for she is not for you /
So the damoysel came and desired of him marriage / damoysel said Orphelyn I
thank you but as yet I cast me not to marye in this country / Sire she said
sythen ye will not mary me / I pray you in so much as ye have won me that
ye will give me to a Knight of this country that has been my friend / and
loved me many years / with all my heart said Alysander I will assente thereto
/ Then was the Knyte sent for / his name was Geryne le gross / And anon he
made them hand fast / and wedded them / Then came Queen Morgan le fay to
Alysander and badde him arise and put him in an horse lyttar and gaf him such
a drink that in three days and three nyghtes he waked never but slepte / and
so she brought him to her own castle that at that time was called la Beale
regard / Then Morgan le fay came to Alysander and asked him if he would feign
be hole / who would be seek said Alysander and he might be hole / well said
Morgan le fay then shall ye promise me by your knyghthode that this day
twelve monethe and a day ye shall not pass the compass of this Castle / and
without doubt ye shall lyghtely be hole / I assente said sire Alysaunder /
And there he made her a promise / then was he soon hole / And when
Alysander was hole / then he repentyd him of his oath / for he might not be
reuengyd upon king Mark / Right so there came a damoysel that was cosyn to
the Earl of pase / and she was cosyn to Morgan le fay / and by right that
castle of la Beale regard should have been hers by true enherytaunce / So this
damoysel entered in to this castle / where lay Alysander / and there she fond
him upon his bed passing heavy and all sad

Capitulum xxxviij
Sire knight said the damoysel / and ye would be merry I could tell you good

for now I stand as a prisoner by my promise / Sir she said wete ye well that ye
be a prisoner and werse than ye wene / for my lady my cosyn Queen Morgan le fay
keeps you here for none other entente but for to do her pleasyr with you when
hit lyked her / O Ihesu defend me said Alysander from such pleasyr for I had
lever cut awey my hangers than I would do her such pleasyr / As Ihesu help
me said the damoysel / and ye would love me and be ruled by me I shall make
your delyueraunce with your worship / Tell me said Alysander / by what mean
/ and ye shall have my love / fair knight said she / this castle of right
ought to be mine / And I have an vnkel the which is a mighty Earl / he is Earl
of pase / and of al folks he hates most Morgan le fay / and I shall send
unto him / and pray him for my sake to destroy this castle / for the euylle
custommes that been used therein / And then will he come and set wild fire
on every part of the castle / and I shall get you out at a pryuy posterne /
and there shall ye have your horse and your harneis / ye say well damoysel said
Alysander / and then she said ye may keep the rome of this Castle this twelve
month / and a day / then break ye not your oath / Truly fair damoysel said
Alysander ye say sothe / And then he kyste her and did to her plesaunce as
it pleased them both at times and leysers / So anon she sent unto her vnkel
and badde him come and destroy that castle / for as the book says / he would
have destroyed that castle before time / had not that damoysel ben / When the
Earl understood her letters / he sent her word again that on such a day he
would come and destroy that castle / So when that day came she showed
Alysander a posterne where thorou he should flee in to a gardyn / and there he
should find his armor and his horse / when the day came that was set
thydder came the earl of pase with four honderd knights / and set on fire
all the parties of the castle / that or they seaced they left not a stone
standing / And all this while that the fire was in the Castle / he abode in
the gardyn / And when the fire was done / he let make a cry that he would keep
that pyece of earth / there as the castle of la beale regard was a twelve
monethe and a day / from all manner knights that would come / So hit happed
there was a duke that hyte Ansirus / and he was of the kyn of sir lancelot /
And this knight was a great pilgrim / for every thyrdde year he would be at
Iherusalem / And by cause he used all his life to goo in pylgremage men called
him duke Anserus the pilgrim / And this duke had a douter that hit Alys that
was a passing fair woman / And by cause of her fader she was called Alys le
beale pilgrim / And anon as she herd of this cry / she went unto Arthurs
court and said openly in heryng of many knights / that what Knight may
overcome that Knight that keeps that pyece of earth shall have me and all my
lands / when the Knights of the round table herd her say thus / many were
glad / for she was passing fair and of great rentes / Right so she let
cry in castles and towns as fast on her side as as Alysander did on his side
/ Then she dressid her pauelione streyghte by the pyece of the earth that
Alysander kept / So she was not so soon there / but there came a Knight of
Arthurs court that hyghte Sagramore le desyrus / and he proferd to Just with
Alysander / and they encountered / and Sagramore le desyrus brysed his spear
upon sire Alysander / but sire Alysander smote him so hard that he avoided
his sadel / And when la Beale Alys saw him Just so well / she thought him a
passing goodly knyt on horsbak / And then she lepte out of her pauelione /
and took sir Alysander by the brydel / and thus she said / fair knight I
require the of thy knyghthode / show me thy vysage / I dar well said Alysander
show my vysage / And then he put of his helm / and she saw his vysage /
she said / O sweet Ihesu / the I must love / and never other / then show me
your vysage said he /

Capitulum xxxix
Then she vnwympeled her vysage / And when he saw her / he said here have
I fond my love and my lady / Truly fair lady said he I promise you to be your
knight / and none other that bears the life / Now gentil knight said she
tell me your name / My name is said he Alysander le Orphelyn / Now damoysel
tell me your name said he / my name is said she / Alys la beale pilggrym / And
when we be more at our hertes ease both ye and I shall tell other of what
blood we be come / So there was great love betwyxe them / And as they thus
talked / there came a Knight that hyghte Harsouse le Berbuse and axed part of
sir Alysanders speres / Then sire Alysander encountered with him / and at the
first sir Alysander smote him over his horse croupe / And then there came
another knight that hit sire Hewgon / And sire Alysander smote him down as he
did that other / Then sire Heugon proffered to do bataille on foot / sire
Alysander overcame him with three strokes / and there would have slain him had
he not yielded him / So then Alisander made both tho Knights to swear to
were none armor in a twelve month and a day / Then sire Alisander alyte
down and went to rest him and repose him / Then the damoysell that halp
sire Alysander out of the castle in her play told Alys all to gyder how he was
prisoner in the castle of la beale regard / and there she told her how she gat
him out of prison / Sir said Alys la Beale pilgrim me seems ye ar much
beholdynge to this maiden / that is troth said sir Alysander / And there Alys
told him of what blood she was come / Sire wete ye well she said that I am of
the blood of King Ban that was fader unto sir Lancelot ye wys fair lady said
Alysander my mother told me that my fader was brother unto a king / and I am
nyghe cosyn unto sire Tristram / Then this while came there three knights /
that one hit Vayns / and the other hight Haruys de le marches / and the thyrdde
hight Peryn de la montayne / and with one spear sire Alysander smote them down
all three / and gaf them such fallys / that they had no list to fight upon
foot / So he made them to swear to were none arms in a twelve month / So
when they were deperted sire Alysander beheld his lady Alys on horse bak as he
stood in her pauelione / And then was he so enamoured upon her that he wist
not whether he were on horsbak or on foot / Right so came the false Knight sir
Mordred and saw sir Alysander was assoted upon his lady / and there with all
he took his horse by the brydel / and led him here and there / and had cast to
have led him out of that place to have shamed him / when the damoysel that
halpe him out of that Castle saw how shamefully he was led / Anon she let
arm her and set a sheld upon her sholder / And there with she mounted upon
his horse / and gatte a naked swerd in her hand / and she threst unto Alysander
with all her might / and she gaf him such a buffet that he thought the fire
flewe out of his eyes / And when Alysander felt that stroke he looked about
him / and drew his swerd / And when he saw that she fled / and so did
Mordred in to the forest / and the damoysel fled in to the pauelione / So
when Alysander understood him self how the false knight would have shamed him /
had not the damoysel ben / then was he wroth with him self that sire
Mordred was so escaped his hands / But then sire Alysander and Alys had
good game at the damoysel hou sadly she hytte him upon the helm / Then sir
Alysander Iusted thus day by day / and on foot he did many batails with many
knights of king Arthurs court and with many knights strangers / therefore to
tell all the batails that he did it were over much to rehearse / for every
day within that twelve month he had adoo with one Knight or with other / and
some day he had adoo with three or with four / And there was never knight that
put him to the werse / and at the twelve months end he departed with his
lady Alys la beale pilgrim / and the damoysel would never goo from him / and so
they went in to their country of Benoye / and lived there in great Joy /

But as the book says / king mark would never stynte till he had slain him by
treason / / and by Alys he gat a child that hight Bellengerus le Beuse / and by
good fortune he came to the court of King Arthur / and preued a passing good
Knight / and he revenged his faders death for the false King Mark slew both
sire Tris^ram and Alysander falsely and felo^sly / and hit happed so that
Alysander had never grace ne fortune to come to King Arthurs court For and
he had comen to sire lancelot all knights said / that knew him / he was one
of the strengest knights that was in Arthurs days / and great dole was made
for him So let we of him pass and torn we to another tale So hit bef^lle
that ^ire Galahalt the haute prince was lord of the country of Surluse /
whereof came many good knights / And this noble prince was a passing good man
of arms and ever he held a noble felaushyp to gyders / And then he came to
Arthurs court / and told him his intent / how this was his will / hou he would
let cry a Iustes in the country of Surluse / the which country was within
the lands of king Arthur / and there he axed leave to let cry a Iustes / I
will give you leave said King Arthur / But wete thou well said King Arthur / I
may not be there / Sire said Queen Gueneuer please hit you to give me leave to
be at that Iustes / with right good will said Arthur / for sire Galahalt the
haute prince shall have you in governance / Sir said Galahalt I will as ye
will / sir then the queen I will take with me and such knights as pleasen
me best / do as ye list said king Arthur / So anon she commanded sire
Lancelot to make him ready with such knights as he thought best / So in
every good town and castle of this land was made a cry / that in the country
of Surluse sire Galahalt should make a Iustes that should last eyghte days /
And how the haute prince with the help of Queen Gueneuers knights should Just
again all manner of men that would come / when this cry was known / kings
and princes / dukes and Earls / Barons and noble knights made them ready to be
at that Iustes And at the day of Iustyng there came in sire Dynadan /
disguysed / and did many great deeds of arms

Capitulum xlj
Then at the request of Queen Gueneuer and of king Bagdemagus / sir
Lau^celot came in to the rayeng but he was desguysed / and that was the cause
that few folk knew him / and there met with him sir Ector de marys his
own brother / and either brake their speres upon other to their hands / And
then either gate another spear / And then sire lancelot smote down sir
Ector de marys his own brother / That saw sire Bleoberys / and he smote sir
lancelot such a buffet upon the helm that he wist not well where he was /
Then sir lancelot was wroth / and smote sir Bleoberys so sore upon the
helm that his head bowed down backward / And he smote efte another buffet
that he avoided his sadel / and so he rode by / and threst forth to the
thyckest / when the king of Northgalys saw sire Ector and Bleoberys lie on
the ground / then was he wroth / for they came on his party against them of
Surluse / So the king of Northgalys ran to sire Lancelot / and brake a spear
upon him all to pyeces There with sire Lancelot ouertook the king of
Northgalys and smote him such a buffet on the helm with his suerd that he
made him to avoid his horse / and anon the king was horsed again / So both
the king Bagdemagus and the king of Northgalys party hurled to other / and
then began a strong meddle / but they of Northgalys were far bygger
when sire lancelot saw his party goo to the werst / he thrange in to the
thyckest prees with a suerd in his hand / and there he smote down on the right
hand and on the lift hand and pulled down knights and racyd of their helmes
that all men had wonder that ever one knight might do such deeds of arms
/ when sire Mellegaunt that was sone unto king Bagdemagus saw how sir
Lancelot ferd / he merueiled gretely / And when he understood that it was he /
he wist well that he was desguysed for his sake / Then sire Malegeaunt prayed a
Knight to slay sir launcelots horse outher with suerd or with spear / At that
time King Bagdemagus met with a Knight that hight Sauseyse a good knight /
to whom he said / Now fair Sauseyse encounter with my sone Malegeaunt / and
give him large payment / for I would he were well beten of thy hands that he
might depart out of this feld / And then sir Sauseyse encountered with sir
Malegeaunt / and either smote other down / And then they fought on foot /
and there Sauseyse had won sire Malegeaunt / had not there come rescowes /
So then the haute prince blewe to lodging / And every knight unarmed him /
and went to the great feast / Then in the mean while there came a damoysel
to the haute prince / and complained that there was a knight that hight
Goneryes that withhelde her all her lands Then the knight was there
present and cast his glove to him or to any that would fight in her name /
So the damoysel took up the glove all heuyly for defaute of a champyon /
Then there came a varlet to her and said damoysel / will ye do after me /
full feign said the damoysel / then goo ye unto such a knight that lies here
beside in an ermytage / and that follows the questyng best / and pray him to
take the bataille upon him / and anon I wot well he will grant you / So
anon she took her palfroy / and within a while she fond that knight that was
sire Palomydes / And when she required him / he armed him and rode with her /
and made her to go to the haute prince / and to ask leave for her knight to do
batail / I will well said the haute prince / Then the knights were ready in
the feld to Just on horsbak / and either gatte a spear in their hands and
met so fyersly to gyders that their speres all to sheuerd / Then they
flange out swerdes / and sir Palomydes smote sire Gonereys down to the earth /
And then he racyd of his helm and smote of his head / Then they went to
souper / and the damoysel loved Palomydes as peramour / but the book says she
was of his kyn / So then Palomydes desguysed him self in this manner / in
his shield he bare the questynge be and in all his trappours / And when
he was thus ready / he sent to the haute prince to give him leave to Just with
other knights / but he was adoubted of sire lancelot / The haute prince sent
him word again / that he should be welcome / and that sire Lancelot should not
Just with him / Then sire Galahalt the haute prince let cry what knight
someuer he were that smote down sir Palomydes should have his damoysel to him
self /

that stroke / And there with he alyghte down of his own horse / and prayed the
good knight Palomydes to take that horse of his yefte / and to forgive him that
deed / Sire said Palomydes I thank you of your great goodness / for ever of a
man of worship / a knight shall never ^aue disworship / and so he mounted
upon that horse / and the haute prince had another anon / Now said the haute
prince I relece to you that maiden / for ye have won her / A said palomydes
the damoysel and I be at your commandment / So they departed and sire
Galahalt did great deeds of arms / And right so came Dynadan / and encountered

lord I pray you leave me / and take another / the haute prince knew not Dynadan
/ and left goodely for his fair words / And so they departed / but soon
there came another / and told the haute prince that hit was Dynadan / for soth
said the prince therefore am I heavy that he is so escaped from me / for with his

smote him so hard / that he went to the earth horse and man / And for to make
a short tale / he smote down three brethren of sire Gawayns / that is for to
say Mordred Gaherys and Agrauayne / O Ihesu said Arthur this is a great despyte
of a Sarasyn that he shall smite down my blood / And there with all king
Arthur was wood wroth / and thought to have made him ready to Just / That
aspyed sire Lamorak that Arthur and his blood were discomfyte / And anon he
was ready and axed Palomydes if he would any more Just / why should I not said
Palomydes / Then they hurtled to gyders and brake their speres / and all to
sheuerd them / that all the castle range of their dyntys / Then either gate
a gretter spear in his hand / and they came so fyersly to gyders / but sir
Palomydes spear all to brast and sire Lamorak did hold / there with all sire
Palomydes lost his steroppes and lay up right on his horsbak / And then sire
Palomydes returned again and took his damoysel / and sir Safere returned his
way / So when he was departed king Arthur came to sir Lamorak and thanked him
of his goodness / and prayed him to tell him his name / Sir said Lamorak wete
thou well / I owe you my seruyse / but as at this time I will not abide here /
for I see of mine enemies many about me Allas said Arthur now wot I well / it
is sire Lamorak de galys / O Lamorak abide with me / and by my croune I shall
never fail the / and not so hardy in Gawayns head / nor none of his brethren
to do the any wrong / Sire said sire Lamorak wrong have they done me and to
you both / That is troth said the king for they slew their own mother and
my sister / the which me sore greueth / It had been much fayrer and better
that ye had wedded her / for ye are a kings sone as well as they O Ihesu said
the noble Knight sire Lamorack unto Arthur her death shall I never forgete / I
promise you and make mine auowe unto god I shall revenge her death as soon as
I see time conenable / And if hit were not at the reverence of your hyhenes / I
should now have been revenged upon sire Gawayn and his brethren / truly said
arthur I will make you at acord / Sir said Lamorak as at this time I may not
abide with you / for I must to the Iustes / where is sire lancelot and the
haute prince sire Galahalt / Then there was a damoysel that was daughter to
king Bands / and there was a Sarasyn knight that hyghte Corsabryn / and he
loved the damoysel / and in no wise he would suffer her to be married / for ever
this Corsabryn noysed her and named her that she was out of her mind / and
thus he let her that she might not be married

Capitulum xliiij
So by fortune this damoysel herd tell that Palomydes did much for damoysels
sake / so she sent to him a pensel / and prayed him to fight with sire
Corsabryn for her love / and he should have her / and her lands of her faders
that should fall to her / Then the damoysel sent unto corsabryn and badde
him goo unto sire Palomydes that was a paynym as well as he / and she gaf him
warnyng that she had sent him her pensel / and if he might overcome Palomydes
she would wedde him / when Corsabryn wyste of her deeds / then was he wood
wroth and angry / and rode unto Surluse where the haute prince was / and there
he fond sire Palomydes ready the which had the pensel / So there they waged
batail either with other before Galahalt / well said the haute prince / this day
must noble knights Just / and at after dinner we shall see how ye can speed /
Then they blewe to Iustes And in came Dynadan / and met with sir Geryn a
good knight / and he threw him down over his horse croupe / and sire Dynadan
ouerthrewe four knytes moo / and there he did great deeds of arms / for he was
a good knyt / but he was a scoffer / and a Iaper and the meryest knight among
felauship that was that time living / And he had such a customme that he
loved every good knight / and every good knight loved him again / So then
when the haute prince saw Dynadan do so well / he sent unto sire lancelot
/ and bad him stryke down sire Dynadan / And when that ye have done so bring
him before me and the noble queen Gueneuer / Then sir Lancelot did as he was
required / Then sire Lamorak and he smote down many knights / and racyd of
helmes / and drofe all the knights before them And so sire Lancelot smote
down sire Dynadan / and made his men to unarm him / and so brought him to
the queen and the haute prince and they lough at dynadan so sore that they
might not stand / well said sire Dynadan yet have I no shame / for the old
shrewe sire Lancelot smote me down / So they went to dyuer / all the Court
had good sport at Dynadan Then when the dinner was done / they blewe to the
field to behold sire Palomydes and Corsabryn / Sire Palomydes pyght his
pensell in mids of the field / and then they hurtled to gyders with their
speres as it were thonder / and either smote other to the earth / And then
they pulled out their swerdes / and dressid their sheldes / and lasshed to
gyders myghtely as mighty knytes / that well nyghe there was no pyece of harneis
would hold them / for this Corsabryn was a passing folonous knight / Corsabryn
said Palomydes will thou releace me yonder damoysel / and the pensell / Then
was Corsabryn wroth out of mesure / and gaf Palomydes such a buffet that he
kneled on his knee /

Then Palomydes arose lyghtely / and smote him upon the helm / that he fell
down ryt to the earth / And there with he racyd of his helm / and said
Corsabryn yield the or else thou shall dye of my hands / Fie on the said
Corsabryn / do thy werst / then he smote of his head / And there with all
came a stynke of his body when the soul departed / that there myt no body abide
the sauoure / So was the corpse had aweye and buried in a wood by cause he
was a paynym /

Then they blewe unto lodging / and Palomydes was unarmed Then he went
unto Queen Gueneuer / to the haute prince / and to sire lancelot / Sire said
the haute prince / here have ye seen this day a great myrakel by Corsabryn /
what savor there was when the soul departed from the body / There for sire
we will require you to take the baptym upon you / and I promise you all
knights will set the more by you / and say more worship by you

Sire said Palomydes I will that ye all know / that in to this land I came
to be crystened / and in my heart I am crystened / and crystend will I be /
But I have made such an auowe that I may not be crystend till I have done
seven true batails for Ihesus sake / And then will I be crystend / And I
trust god will take mine intent for I mean truly / Then sire Palomydes
prayed Queen Gueneuer and the haute prince to soupe with him / And so they did
both sire Lancelot and sire Lamorak / and many other good knights / So on
the morn they herd their mass / and blewe the field / and then knights
made them ready /

in sir Dornard and sir Aglouale that were brethren unto sire Lamorak / and
they met with other two knights / and either smote other so hard that all
four knights and horses fell to the earth / when sire Lamorak saw his two
brethren down / he was wroth out of mesure / And then he gat a great

on the right hand and on the lift hand / and racyd of helmes and pulled down
knights that all men merueylled of such deeds of arms as he did / for he
ferd so that many knights fled / Then he horsed his brethren again and
said brethren ye ought to be ashamed to fall so of your horses / what is a
Knight but when he is on horsbak / I set not by a knight when he is on foot
/ for all batails on foot ar but pelowres batails / For there should no Knight
fight on foot / but if hit were for treason / or else he were driven thereto by
force / therefore brethren sytte fast on your horses or else fight never more
before me / with that came in the duke Chaleyns of Claraunce / and there
encountered with him the Earl Vlbawes of Surluse / and either of hem smote other

at mids of their dinner in came Dynadan and began to rail / Then he
beheld the haute prince that seemed wroth with sum fault that he saw / for
he had a customme he loved no fysshe / and by cause he was served with fysshe

the haute prince / he aspyed where was a fyss^^ with a great head / and that he
gatte betwixe two dysshes / and served the haute prince with that fysshe / And
then he said thus / sir galahalt well may I lyken you to a wolf / for he will

met so hard that either bare other down horse and man Then came there the
Earl of lambayle and helped the duke again to horse / Then came there sir
Ossayse of Surluse / and he smote the earl Lambayle down from his horse /
Then began they to do great deeds of arms / and many speres were broken /
and many knights were cast to the earth

Then the king of Northgalys and the Earl Vlbawes smote to gyders that all

we sytte here or not / So sir Dynadan departed and took his horse and met
with many knights / and did passing well / And as he was departed / sire
Lancelot desguysed him self / and put upon his armor a maidens garment
fresshely attyered / Then sire Lancelot made sire Galyhodyn to lead him
thorugh the raunge / and all men had wonder what damoysel it was / And so as
sire Dynadan came in to the raunge / sire Lancelot that was in the damoysels
array gatte Galyhodyns spear and ran unto sir Dynadan / And always sire
Dynadan looked up there as sire Lancelot was / and then he saw one sytte in
the stead of sire Lancelot armed / But when Dynadan saw a manner of a

Lancelot came on him so fast that he smote him over his horse croupe / and
then great scorns gate sire Dynadan in to the forest there beside / and

Capitulum l
NOw torn we fro this matter / and speak we of sir tristram of whom this book
is pryncipal of / and leave we the king and the queen / sir Lancelot / and
sire Lamorak / and here begins the treason of king Mark that he ordained
against sir Tristram / There was cried by the costs of Cornewaile a great
turnement and Iustes / and al was done by sir Galahalt the haut prince / and
king Bagdemagus to the intent to slay Lancelot or else utterly destroy him
and shame him / by cause sir lancelot had alweyes the hyher degree / therefore
this prince and this king made this Iustes against sire Lancelot / And thus
her cou^ceyll was discouerd unto King Mark whereof he was full glad / Then
King Mark bethoughte him that he would have sire Tristram unto that turnement
desguysed that no man should know him / to that entente that the haute prince
should wene that sir Tristram were sire lancelot / So at thise Iustes came in
sir Tristram / And at that time sire lancelot was not there / but when they
saw a Knyt desguysed do such deeds of arms / they wend hit had been sir
lancelot / And in especyal King Mark said hit was sire lancelot plainly /
Then they set upon him both King Bagdemagus and the haute prince and
their Knights that hit was wonder that ever sire Tristram might endure that
pain / Not withstanding for all the pain that he had sir Tristram wanne the
degree at that turnement / and there he hurt many Knytes and brysed them / and
they hurt him and brysed him wonderly sore / So when the Iustes were all
done / they knew well that hit was sire Tristram de Lyones / and all that were
on King marks party were glad that sir Tristram was hurt / and the remenaunt
were sorry of his hurt / for sire Tristram was not so behated as was sire
Lancelot within the Reame of England / Then came King Mark unto sire
Tristram / and said fair neuewe I am sorry of your hurtes / Gramercy my lord
said sire Tristram /

Then King Mark made sir Tristram to be put in an horse bear in great
sign of love / and said fair cosyn I shall be your leche my self / and so
he rode forth with sire Tristram and brought him to a Castle by day light /
And then King Mark made sire Tristram to ete / And then after he gaf him a
drink / the which as soon as he ^ad drunk / he fell on sleep / And when
it was night he made him to be carried to another castle / and there he put
him in a strong prison / and there he ordained a man and a woman to give him
his mete and drink / So there he was a great while / then was sir Tristram
myssed / and no creature wist where he was become when la beale Isoud herd hou
he was myssed pryuely she went unto sir Sadok and praid him to aspye where was
sir Tristram Then when Sadok wist hou sir tristram was myssed and anon aspyed
that he was put in prison by kyny mark and the traitors of Mago^s / then
sadok and two of his cosyns leid them in an enbusshement fast by the castle of
Tyntagyl in arms / And as by fortune there came riding King Mark and four
of his neuewes / and a certain of the traitors of Magouns when sir Sadok
aspyed them / he brake out of the busshement / and set there upon them / And
when king Mark aspyed sire Sadok / he fled as fast as he might / and there
sir Sadok slew all the four neuewes unto King Mark / But these traitors of
Magons slew one of Sadoks cosyns a great wound in the neck / but Sadok smote
the other to the death / Then sir Sadok rode upon his way unto a Castle that
was called Lyonas / and there he aspyed of the treason and felony of king
Mark / So they of that castle rode with sire Sadok till that they came to a
Castle that hyghte Arbray / and there in the town they fond sire Dynas the
Seneschal / that was a good Knight / But when sire Sadok had told sire Dynas of
all the treason of King Mark / he defied such a King / and said he would
give up his lands that he held of him / And when he said these words all
manner Knights said as sire Dynas said / Then by his aduys and of sire
Sadoks he let stuff all the towns and Castles within the Country of Lyones
and assembled all the people that they might make

NOw torn we unto King Mark that when he was escaped from sir Sadok / he
rode unto the Cas^el of Tyntagyl / and there he made great cry and noise / and
cried unto harneis all that might bear arms / Then they sought and fond
where were deed four cosyns of king Marks and the traitor of Magouns / Then
the king let entyere them in a chapel / then the king let cry in all
the country that held of him to goo unto arms / for he understood to the
werre he must needs / When King Mark herd and understood how sire Sadok
and sir Dynas were arysen in the Country of Lyones / he remembryd of wyles and
treason / Lo thus he did / he let make and counterfete letters from the pope
and did make a straung clerk to bear them unto king mark / the which letters
specyfyed that king Mark should make him ready upon pain of cursyng with his
host to come to the pope to help to goo to Iherusalem for to make war upon
the Sarasyns / when this clerk was come by the mean of the King / anon with
all king mark sent these letters unto sire Tristram and badde him say thus
/ that and he would goo werre upon the mescreauntes / he should be had out of
prison / and to have all his power / when sire Tristram understood this
letter / then he said thus to the Clerk / A king Mark ever have thou ben a
traitor / and ever will be / but Clerk said sire Tristram Say thou thus unto
King mark Syn the Appostle pope has sent for him / bydde him goo thither him
self / for tell him traitor King as he / is I will not goo at his
commandment / get I out of prison as I may for I see I am well rewarded for
my true seruyse / Then the Clerk returned unto king Mark and told him of
the ansuer of sire Tristram / well said King mark yet shall he be begyled / So
he went in to his chamber and counterfete letters / and the letters specyfyed
that the pope desired sire Tristram to come him self to made werre upon the
mescreauntes when the Clerk was come again to sir Tristram and took him
these letters / then sire Tristram beheld these letters / and anon he
aspyed they were of king Marks counterfetynge A said sire Tristram falls have
thou ben ever king Mark / and so wolt thou end / Then the Clerk departed
from sire Tristram and came to king Mark again / By then there were come
four wounded knights within the castle of Tyntagil / and one of them his neck
was nyghe broken in tweyn Another had his arm stryken awey / the thyrdde was
borne through with a spear / the fourth had his t^eth stryken in tweyn And
when they came before king Mark they cried and said / king / why fleest
thou not for all this country is arysen clearly against the / then was
king Mark wroth out of mesure / and in the mean while there came in to the
country sire Percyuale de galys to seek sire Tristram / And when he herd that
sire Tristram was in prison / sir Percyual made clearly the delyueraunce of sir
Tristram by his knyghtly means / And when he was so delyuerd / he made great
Joy of sire Percyuale / and so echone of other / Sir Tristram said unto sire
Percyuale / and ye will abide in these marches I will ride with you / Nay
said Percyuale in this country I may not tarry / for I must needs in to walys
/ So sire Percyuale departed from sire Tristram / and rode streyghte unto
King Mark / and told him how he had delyuerd sire Tristram / and also he told
the king that he had done him self great shame for to put sir Tristram in
prison / For he is now the knight of most renomme in this world living

And wete thou well the noblest knights of the world love sir Tristram / and
if he will make werre upon you / ye may not abide hit / That is truth said
king Mark / but I may not love sire Tristram by cause he loves my Queen and
my wife la beale Isoud / A fie for shame said sir Percyuole say ye never so more
/ Are ye not vnkel unto sir Tristram / and he your neuewe / ye should never
think that so noble a Knight as sire Tristram is that he would do him self
so great a vylony to hold his vnkels wife / how be it said sir Percyuale he
may love your Queen synles by cause she is called one of the fairest ladies of
the world / Then sir Percyuale departed from King Mark / So when he was
departed King Mark bethought him of more treson / Not withsta^dyng king mark
granted sire Percyuale never by no manner of means to hurt sire Tristram /
So anon King Mark sent unto sire Dynas the Seneschal that he should put
down all the people that he had raised / for he sent him an oath that he would
goo him self unto the pope of Rome to war upon the mescreauntes / and this is
a fayrer werre than thus to areyse the people / against your king / when sir
Dynas understood that king mark would goo upon the mescreauntes / then sire
Dynas in all the have put down all the people / and when the people were
departed every man to his home / then King mark aspyed where was sire
Tristram with la Beale Isoud / and there by treason King Mark let take him
and put him in prison contrary to his promise that he made unto sire Percyuale
/ when Queen Isoud understood that sir Tristram was in prison / she made as
great sorrow as ever made lady or gentylwoman / Then sire Tristram sent a
letter unto la Beale Isoud and praid her to be his good lady / and if hit
pleased her to make a vessel ready for her and him / he would goo with her unto
the reame of Logrys that is this land / when la beale Isoud understood sire
Tristrams letters and his intent she sent him another / and badde him be of
good comfort / for she would do make the vessel ready and all thing to purpos
Then la beale Isoud sent unto sire Dynas and to sadok and prayed hem in any
wise to take King Mark / and put him in prison unto the time that she and
sire Tristram were departed unto the Royamme of Logrys / when sir Dynas the
Seneschall understood the treason of King Mark / he promised her again and
sent her word that King Mark should be put in prison / And as they devised
hit so it was done / And then sire Tristram was delyuerd out of prison /
and anon in all the haste Queen Isoud and sir Tristram went and took their
counceyll with that they would have with them when they departed

Then la Beale Isoud and sire Tristram took their vessel / and came by water
in to this land / and so they were not in this land four days / but there came
a cry of a Iustes and turnement that King Arthur let make / when sire
Tristram herd tell of that turnement he desguysed him self / and la Beale
Isoud / and rode unto that turnement And when he came there he saw many
Knights Just and turneye / and so sir Tristram dressid him to the raunge /
and to make short conclusion / he ouerthrewe fourten Knights of the round
table / when sir Lancelot saw these Knights thus overthrown / sire
lancelot dressid him to sir Tristram / That saw la Beale Isoud how sire
lancelot was come in to the field / Then la Beale Isoud sent unto sire
Lancelot a ring / and badde him wete that it was sir Tristram de lyones
when sir lancelot understood that there was sire Tristram he was full glad
/ and would not Just / then sire Lancelot aspyed whyder sire Tristram yede /
and after him he rode / and then either made of other great Joy / And so
sire Lancelot brought sire Tristram and la beale Isoud unto Joyous guard that
was his own Castle that he had won with his own hands / And there sire
Lancelot put them in to welde for their own / And wete ye well that Castle was
garnysshed and furnysshed for a King and a queen Royal there to have soiourned
/ and sire Lancelot charged all his people to honor them and love them as
they would do him self / So sire lancelot departed unto king Arthur / and
then he told Queen Gueneuer how he that Iusted so well at last turnement
was sire Tristram / and there he told her how he had with him la beale Isoud
maulgre king Mark / and so Queen Gueneuer told all this unto king Arthur /
when king Arthur wyste that sire Tristram was escaped and comen from king
Mark / and bad brought la beale Isoud with him / then was he passing
glad / So by ^^use of sire Tristram king Arthur let make a cry / that on
may day should be a Iustes before the castle of Lonazep / And that Castle was
fast by Joyous guard / And thus Arthur devised that all the knights of this
land and of Cornewaile and of Northwalys should Just ageynste all these
countries / Irland / Scotland / and the remenaunt of walys and the country of
Gore and Surluse and of Lystynoyse / and they of Northumberland and all they
that held lands of arthur a this half the sea / when this cry was made /
many knights were glad and many were vngladde / Sire said lau^celot unto
Arthur by this cry that ye have made ye will put us that been about you in
great Ieopardy / for there be many Knights that have great envy to us /
therefore when we shall mete at the day of Iustes there will be hard skyfte
among us / As for that said Arthur I care not / there shall we preue who shall
be best of his hands / So when sir lancelot understood wherefore king Arthur
made this Iustyng then he made such purueaunce that la beale Isoud should
behold the Iustes in a secret place that was honest for her estate /

Now torn we unto sire Tristram and to la beale Isoud / how they maade great
Joy daily to gyders with all manner of myrthes that they coud deuyse / and
every day sir Tristram would goo ride on huntyng^ / for sire Tristram was that
time called the best chacer of the world / and the noblest blower of an horn
of all manner of mesures / for as books report / of sire Tristram came all
the good terms of venery and of hu^tynge and all the syses and mesures of
blowynge of an horn / and of him we had first all the terms of haukyng /
and which were beestes of chase and beestes of venery / and which were
vermyns / and all the blastes that longen to all manner of gamen / First to
the vncoupelynge / to the seeking / to the rechate / to the flyghte / to the
death / and to struck / and many other blastes and terms / that all manner of
gentylmen have cause to the Worlds end to preyse sir Tristram and to pray

So on a day la beale Isoud said unto sir Tristram I merueyle me much said
she / that ye remember not your self how ye be here in a strange country and
here be many peryllous knights / and well ye wot that king Mark is full of
treason / and that ye will ride thus to chase and to to hunte unarmed ye
might be destroyed / My fair lady and my love I cry you mercy I will no more
do so So then sire Tristram rode daily on hunting armed and hi^ men
berynge his shield and his spear / So on a day a lytyl before the monethe of

a fair well / And then sir Tristram alyghte and put of his helm to drink
of that burbley water / Right so he herd and saw the questynge be come to
the well / when sire Tristram saw that best / he put on his helm for he
demed he should here of sir Palomydes / for that best was his quest / Right so
sir Tristram saw where came a knight armed upon a noble courser / and he
salewed him / and they spoke of many things / and this knights name was
Breuse saunce pity / and right so with all there came unto them the noble
knight sire Palomydes / and either sal^wed other / and spoke fair to other
Fair knights said sir Palomydes I can tell you tidings / what is that said
tho knights / Syrs wete ye well that King Mark is put in prison by his own
knights / and all was for love of sire Tristram / for king Mark had put
sire Tristram twyes in prison / And ones sire Percyuale delyuerd the noble
knight sire Tristram out of prison

And at the last time Queen La beale Isoud delyuerd him / and went cleryly
aweye with him in to this reame / and all this while king Mark the false
traitor is in prison / Is this truth said Palomydes / Then shall we
hastily here of sire Tristram / And as for to say that I love la Beale Isoud
peramours I dare make good that I do / and that she has my seruyse above all
other ladies / and shall have the term of my life / And right so as they
stood talking / they saw before them where came a Knight all armed on a
great horse / and one of his men bare his sheld / and the other his speres / And
anon as that Knight aspyed them he gatte his shield and his spear / and
dressid him to Just

Fair felawes said sire Tristram yonder is a Knight will Just with us / let
see which of us shall encountre with him for I see well he is of the court of
King Arthur

It shall not be long or he be met with all said sire Palomydes / for I
fond never no knight in my queste of this Glastynge be / but and he would
Just I never refused him As well may I said Breuse saunce pity follow that
be as ye / Then shall ye do bataille with me said Palomydes / So sire
Palomydes dressid him unto that other Knight sire Bleoberys that was a full
noble Knight nyghe kynne unto sire Lancelot / And so they met so hard /
that sire Palomydes fell to the earth horse and all /

Then sir Bleoberis cried a loud and said thus / make the ready thou falls
traitor knight Breuse saun^e pity / for wete thou certainly I will have adoo
with the to the vtteraunce for the noble knights and ladies that thou have
falsely bitraid When this false knight and traitor Breuse saunce pity herd
him say so / he took his horse by the brydel and fled his way as fast as
ever his horse might run / for sore he was of him aferd / When sir Bleoberys
saw him flee he followed fast after thorugh thycke and thorugh thynne / And by
fortune as sir Breuse fled / he saw even before him three knights of the
table round / of the which tho one hyghte sire Ector de marys / the other
hyghte sire Percyuale de galys / the thyrdde hyghte sir Harre de fyse lake a
good knight and an hardy / And as for sir Percyuale he was called that time of
his time one of the best knights of the world and the best assured / when
Breuse saw these knights he rode streyghte unto them and cried unto them and
prayed them of res^owes / what need have ye said sire Ector / A fair knights
said sire Breuse here follows me the most traitor knight and most coward
and most of vylony / his name is Breuse saunce pity / and if he may get me he
will slay me without mercy and pity / Abide with us said sir percyuale and we
shall waraunt you / Then were they ware of sire Bleoberys that came riding
all that he might / Then sir Ector put him self forth to Just before them
all / when sire Bleoberis saw that they were four knights / and he but him
self / he stood in a doubt / whether he would torn or hold his way / Then
he said to him self I am a knight of the table round / and rather than I should
shame mine oath and my blood I will hold my way what so ever fall thereof /
And then sire Ector dressid his spear and smote either other passing sore /
but sire Ector fell to the earth / That saw sir Percyuale and he dressid his
horse toward him all that he might drive / but sir Percyuale had such a stroke
that horse and man fell to the earth / When sir Harre saw that they were
both to the earth / then he said to him self / never was Breuse of such
prowess / So sire Harre dressid his horse / and they met to gyders so
stro^ngly that both the horses and knights fell to the earth / but sire
Bleoberis horse began to recover again / That saw sire Breuse and he came
hurtlyng / and smote him over and over and would have slain him as he lay on
the ground / Then sir Harre le fys^ lake arose lyghtely and took the brydel
of sir Breuse horse and said / Fie for shame stryke never a Knight when he is at
the earth / for this Knight may be called no shameful knight of his deeds /
for yet as men may see there as he lies on the ground he has done
worshipfully / and put to the werse passing good knights Therefore will I
not let said sire Breuse / thou shalt not chese said sir Harre as at this
time / Then when sir Bruise saw that he might not chese nor have his will
/ he spak fair / Then sire Harre let him goo / And then anon he made his
horse to run over sire Bleoberys / and rasshed him to the earth like if he
would have slain him / When sire Harre saw him do so vyloynsly / he cried
traitor knyt leave of for shame / and as sir Harre would have taken his horse to
fight with sir breuse / then sir Breuse ran upon him as he was half upon
his horse and smote him down horse and man to the earth / and had nere slain
sir Harre the good knight / That saw sire Percyuale / and then he cried
traitor knight what do thou / And when sire Percyuale was upon his horse /
sir Breuse took his horse and fled all that ever he might / and sire
Percyuale and sire Harre followed after him fast / but ever the longer they
chaced the ferther were they behind / Then they turned again and came to
sir Ector de marys and to sire Bleoberys / A fair knights said Bleoberys why
have ye socoured that falls knight and traitor / why said sire Harre what
knight is he / for well I wot hit is a falls knight said sir Harre and a coward
and a felonous knight / Sir said Bleoberys he is the most coward knight / and
a deuourer of ladies and a destroyer of good Knights and specially of Arthurs
/ what is your name said sir Ector my name is Sir bleoberys de ganys / Allas
fair cosyn said Ector / forgive it me / for I am sir Ector de marys / then
sire Percyuale and sire Harre made great joy that they met with bleoberys /
but all they were heavy that sir breuse was escaped them whereof they made great
dole

Right so as they stood thus / there came sir Palomydes And when he saw the
shield of bleoberys lie on the earth / Then said Palomydes he that owes that
sheld / let him dress him to me / for he smote me down here fast by at a
fontayne / and therefore I will fight for him on foot / I am ready said
Bleoberys here to ansuer the / for wete thou well sir knyt it was I / and my
name is Bleoberys de ganys / well art thou met said Palomydes / and wete thou
well my name is Palomydes the sarasyn / and either of them hated other to the
death / Sire Palomydes said Ector were thou well there is neither thou nor none
knight that bears the life that sleeth any of our blood / but he shall dye
for hit / therefore and thou list to fight goo seche sire lau^celot or sir
Tristram and there shall ye find your match / with hem have I met said
Palomydes / but I had never no worship of them / was there never no manner of
knight said sire Ector but they that ever matched with you / yes said
Palomydes / there was the thyrdde a good knight as any of them / and of his age
he was the best that ever I fond / for and he might have lived till he had been
an hardyer man / there lives no knight now such / and his name was sire
Lamorak de galys / And as he had Iusted at a turnement / there he ouerthrewe me
/ and xxx knights moo / and there he wanne the degree / And at his departing
there met him sire Gawayne and his brethren / and with great pain they
slew him felonsly unto all good knights great damage / Anon as sir
Percyuale herd that his brother was deed sir Lamorak / he fell over his horse
mane swounynge / and there he made the grettest dole that ever maade knight /
And when sir Percyuale aroos / he said / Allas my good and noble brother sire
Lamorak / now shall we never mete / and I trow in all the wide world a man
may not find such a knight as he was of his age / and hit is to much to
suffer the death of our fader king Pellenore / and now the death of our good
brother sir Lamorak / Then in the mean wyhle there came a varlet from the
court of king Arthur and told them of the great turnement that should be at
Lonazep / and how these lands Cornewail / and Northgalys should be against all
them that would come

NOw torn we unto sir Tristram that as he rode on hunting / he met with
sire Dynadan that was comen into that country to seek sire Tristram / Then
sire Dynadan told sire Tristram his name / but sire Tristram would not tell him
his name / wherefore sir Dynadan was wroth / For such a foolysshe knight as
ye are said sire Dynadan I saw but late this day lyenge by a well / and he
fared as he slepte / and there he lay like a fool grymmynge and would not speak
/ and his shield lay by him / and his horse stood by him / and well I wot he was
a lover / A fair sir said sire Tristram are ye not a lover / mary fie on that
craft said sir dynadan / that is euylle said said sire Tristram / for a knyt
may never be of prowess / but if he be a lover / it is well said said sir
Dynadan / Now tell me your name sith ye be a lover / or else I shall do
bataille with you / As for that said sir Tristram hit is no reason to fight
with me / but I tell you my name And as for that my name shall ye not wete as
at this time Fie for shame said Dynadan art thou a knight and darste not tell
thy name to me / therefore I will fight with the / As for that said sir Tristram
I will be aduysed / for I will not do batail / but if me list / And if I do
batail said sire Tristram ye are not able to withstand me / Fie on the coward
said sire Dynadan / and thus as they houed still they saw a knight came rydyng
against them / Lo said sir Tristram see where comes a knight riding will
Just with you / Anon as sir Dynadan beheld him he said that is the same doted
knyt that I saw lie by the well neither slepyng ne wakyng / well said sire
Tristram I know that knight well with the couerd shield of asure / he is the
kings sone of Northumberland / his name is Epynegrys / and he is as great a
lover as I know / and he loves the kings daughter of walys a full fair lady
And now I suppose said sire Tristram / and ye require him / he will Just with
you / and then shall ye preue whether a lover be a better knight or ye that
will not love no lady / well said Dynadan now shall thou see what I shall do /
There with all sire Dynadan spoke on high and said sir knight make the ready
to Just with me / for it is the custom of errau^t knytes one to Just with
other / Sir said Epynegrys is yt the rule of you arraunt knights for to make a
knight to Just will he or nyll / / As for that said Dynadan make the ready /
for here is for me / And there with all they spored their horses and met to
gyders so hard that Epynegrys smote down sir Dynadan Then sir Tristram rode
to sire Dynadan and said how now me seems the lover has well spedde / Fie on
the Coward said sire Dynadan / and if thou be a good Knight revenge me / Nay
said sir Tristram I will not Just as at this time / but take your horse and
let us goo hens / God defend me said sire Dynadan from thy felaushyp / For I
never sped well syn I met with the / and so they departed / well said sir
tristram / peradventure I could tell you tidings of sir tristram God defend
me said Dynadan from thy felaushyp / for sir tristram were mykel the werse /
and he were in thy company / and then they departed / Sire said sir Tristram
yet it may happen I shall mete with you in other places / so rode sir Tristram
unto Joyous guard / and there he herd in that town great noise and cry / what
is this noise said sire Tristram / Sire said they here is a knight of this
castle that has been long among us / and right now he is slain with two
knights / And for none other cause / but that our knight said that sir
Lau^celot were a better Knight than sire Gawayne / that was a simple cause said
sir Tristram for to slay a good knight for to say well by his master / That is
little remedy to us said the men of the town / For and sire Lancelot had been
here / soon we should have been revenged upon the false knights / when sire
Tristram herd them say so / he sent for his shield / and for his spear / and
lightly within a while he had overtake them / and badde them torn and amend
that they had mysdone / What amends would thou have said the one Knight /
and therewith they took their course / and either met other so hard that sir
Tristram smote down that knight over his horse tail / Then the other knight
dressid him to sir Tristram / and in the same wise he served the other knight
/ And then they gate of their horses as well as they might and dressyd their
sheldes and swerdes to do their bataile to the vtteraunce Knights said sire
Tristram ye shall tell me of whens ye ar and what be your names / for such
men ye myte be ye should hard escape my hands / and ye might be such men of
such a country / that for all your euylle deeds ye should pass quyte / wete
thou well sire Knight said they we fear not to tell the our names / for my
name is sir Agrauayne / and my name is Gaherys brethren unto the good Knight
sire Gawayne / and we be neuewes unto king Arthur / well said sir tristram for
King Arthurs sake I shall let you pass as at this time / But hit is shame
said sire Tristram that sire Gawayne and ye be comen of so great a blood that
ye four brethren are so named as ye be / For ye be called the grettest
destroyers and murderers of good Knights that been now in this reame / for it
is but as I herd say that sir Gawayne and ye slew among you a better knight
than ever ye were / that was the noble knight sire Lamorak de galys / and hit
had pleased god said sire Tristram I would I had been by sire Lamorak at his
death / then sholdest thou have gone the same way said sir Gaherys / Fair
knight said sire Tristram there must have been many moo knights than ye are /
And there with all sire Tristram departed fro them toward Joyous guard And
when he was departed / they took their horses / and the one said to the
other / we will overtake him and be revenged upon him in the despyte of sire
Lamorak

Capitulum lvj
So when they had overtake sire Tristram / sir Agrauayne badde him torn
traitor knight / that is evil said / said sir Tristram / and there with he
pulled out his suerd / and smote sir Agrauayne such a buffet upon the helm
that he tombled down of his horse in a swoune / and he had a grievous wound /
And then he turned to Gaherys / and sire Tristram smote his swerd and his
helm to gyders with such a might that Gaherys fell out of his sadel / and
so sir Tristram rode unto Joyous guard and there he alyght and unarmed him /
So sire Tristram told la beale Isoud of all his adventure as ye have herd to
forne / And when she herd him tell of sire Dynadan / sir said she is not that
he that made the song by king Mark / that same is he said sire Tristram / for
he is the best bourder and Iaper and a noble knight of his hands / and the
best felawe that I know / and all good knights love his felauship / Allas
sire said she why brought ye not him with you / have ye no care said sir
Tristram / for he rydeth to seek me in this country / and therefore he will not
awey till he have met with me / And there sire Tristram told la Beale Isoud how
sir Dynadan held ageynste all lovers / Right so there came in a varlet and
told sir Tristram how there was come an erraunt knight in to the town with
such colors upon his sheld / that is sire Dynadan said sire Tristram / wete
ye what ye shall do said sire Tristram / send ye for him my lady Isoud / and
I will not be seen and ye shall here the meryest knight that ever ye spak with
all and the maddest talker / and I pray you hertely that ye make him good
chere / Then anon la beale Isoud sent in to the town / and prayed sir
Dynadan that he would come in to the castle / and repose him there with a lady /
with a good will said sire Dynadan / and so he mounted upon his horse and rode
in to the castle / and there he alyghte / and was unarmed / and brought in to
the castle / Anon la Beale Isoud came unto him / and either salewed other /
then she asked him of whens that he was / Madame said Dynadan I am of the
court of King Arthur / and knyte of the table round / and my name is sire
Dynadan / what do ye in this country said la Beale Isoud / Madame said he I
seek sire Tristram the good knight / for hit was told me that he was in this
country / hit may well be said la Beale Isoud but I am not ware of him / madame
said Dynadan I merueylle of sire Tristram and moo other lovers what eyleth them
to be so mad and so foted upon wymmen / Why said la beale Isoud / are ye a
Knight and be no lover / it is shame to you where for ye may not be called a
good knyte / but if ye make a quarrel for a lady / God defend me said Dynadan /
for the Joy of love is to short / and the sorrow thereof and what comes thereof
dureth over long / A said la Beale Isoud say ye not so / for here fast by was
the good knight sire Bleoberys that fought with three knights at ones for a
damoysels sake / and he wanne her before the king of Northumberland / hit was
so said sire Dynadan for I know him well for a good knyte and a noble and comen
of noble blood / for all ben noble knights of whom he is comen of / that is
sire Lancelot du lake / Now I pray you said la Beale Isoud / tell me will ye
fight for my love with three knights that done me great wrong / and in so
much as ye be a knyt of king Arthurs I require you to do batail for me /
Then sir Dynadan said I shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever I saw
any / and much fayrer than is my lady queen Gueneuer / but wete ye well at one
word I will not fight for you with three knights / Ihesu defend me / Then
Isoud lough / and had good game at him / So he had all the chere that she
might make him / and there he lay all that night / And on the morn erly sir
Tristram armed him and la beale Isoud gaf him a good helm / and then he
promised her that he would mete with sir Dynadan / And they two would ride to
gyders unto Lonazep where the turnement should be / and there shall I make ready
for you where ye shall see the turnement / Then departed sir Tristram with
two squyers that bare his sheld and his speres that were great and long /

Capitulum lvij
Then after that sir Dynadan departed / and rode his way a great paas until
he had overtake sir Tristram And when sir Dynadan had overtake him / he knew
him anon / and he hated the felauship of him above all other knights / A said
sire Dynadan art thou that coward knight that I met with yesterday / keep the
/ for thou shalt Just with me maulgre thy head / well said sire Tristram and I
am both to Just / and so they let their horses run / and sir Tristram
myssid of him a purpos / and sir Dynadan brak a spear upon sire Tristram / and
there with sire Dynadan dressid him to draw out his swerd / Not so said sir
Tristram / why are ye so wroth I will not fight / Fie on the coward said
Dynadan thou shamest all knights / As for that said sire Tristram I care not
/ for I will wait upon you and be under your protectyon / for by cause ye are
so good a knight ye may save me / The deuylle deliver me of the said sir
Dynadan / for thou art as goodely a man of arms and of thy person as ever I
saw and the most coward that ever I saw / what wolt thou do with tho great
speres that thou caryest with the I shall give them said sir Tristram to sum
good knight when I come to the turnement / And if I so you do best / I shall
give them to you / So thus as they rode talkyng they saw where came an
erraunt knight before them that dressyd him to Just / Loo said sir Tristram
yonder is one will Just now dress the to him / a shame betyde the said sire
Dynadan / Nay not so said Tristram for that knight besemeth a shrewe / Then
shall I said sir Dynadan and so they dressid their sheldes and their speres /
and they met to gyders so hard / that the other knight smote down sir
Dynadan from his horse Loo said sir Tristram hit had been better ye had left /
Fie on the coward said sire Dynadan / Then sir Dynadan starte up and gat his
swerd in his hand / and proffered to do batail on foot / whether in love or in
wrath said the other knight / let us do bataille in love said sir Dynadan
/ what is your name said that knight I pray you tell me / wete ye well my name
is sir Dynadan / A Dynadan said that knight and my name is Gareth the youngest
brother unto sire Gawayne / then either made of other great chere / for this
Gareth was the best knight of all tho brethren / and he preued a good
Knight Then they took their horses / and there they spak of sir Tristram how
such a coward he was / and every word sir Tristram herd and lough them to
scorn / Then were they ware where came a knight before them well horsed and
well armed / and he made him ready to Just / Fair knights said sir Tristram /
look betwixe you who shall Just with yonder knight / for I warn you I will
not have adoo with him / then shall I said sir Gareth / and so they
encountered to gyders / and there that knight smote down sire Gareth over his
horse croupe How now said sire Tristram unto sire Dynadan / dress the now and
revenge the good knight Gareth / That shall I not said sir Dynadan / for he
has stryken down a much bygger knight than I am / A said sire Tristram now
sire Dynadan I see and feel well your heart fails you / therefore now shall ye
see what I shall do / And then sire Tristram hurtled unto that knight /
and smote him quyte from his horse / And when sire Dynadan saw that / he
merueyled gretely / And then he demed that hit was sire Tristram / Then
this knight that was on foot pulled out his swerd to do bataille / what is
your name said sire Tristram / wete ye well said that knight my name is sire
Palomydes / what knight hate ye most said sir Tristram / Sir knyeght said he
I hate sir Tristram to the death / for and I may mete with him the one of us
shall dye / ye say well said sir Tristram / and wete ye well that I am sire
Tristram de lyones / and now do your werste when sire Palomydes herd him
say so he was astonyed / And then he said thus I pray you sir Tristram
forgive me all mine euylle will / And if I live I shall do you seruyse above
all other knights that been living / and there as I have owed you euylle
will me sore repents / I wot not what eyleth me / for me seems that ye are
a good knight / and none other Knight that named him self a good knight
should not hate you therefore I require you sir tristram take no displeasyr at mine
unkind words / Sir Palomydes said sire Tristram ye say well / and well I wot
ye are a good knight for I have seen you preued and many great enterpryses
have ye taken upon you / and well encheued them / therefore said sire Tristram and
ye have any evil will to me / now may ye right hit / for I am ready at your
hand / Not so my lord sire Tristram I will do you knyghtly seruyse in all
thing as ye will command / and right so I will take you said sire Tristram /
and so they rode forth on their ways talkyng of many things / O my lord
sire Tristram said Dynadan / foul have ye mocked me / for god knows I came in
to this country for your sake / and by the advise of my lord sire Lancelot /
And yet would not sire Lancelot tell me the certeynte of you where I should
find you / Truly said sir Tristram sire Lancelot wiste well where I was / for
I abode within his own castle /

Capitulum lviij
THus they rode until they were ware of the Castle lonazep / And then were
they ware of four honderd tentys and pauelions / and merueylous great
ordenaunce / So god me help said sire Tristram yonder I see the grettest
ordenaunce that ever I saw / Sire said Palomydes / me seems that there was as
great an ordenaunce at the castle of maidens upon the roche where ye wanne the
price / for I saw my self where ye foriusted thyrtty knights / Sir said
Dynadan and in Surluse at that turnement that Galahalt of the long Isles maade
the which there dured seven days / was as great a gadrynge as is here / for
there were many nacyons / who was the best said sire Tristram / sire it was sir
Lancelot du lake and the noble knight sire Lamorak de galys / and sir
lancelot wanne the degree / I doubt not said sir Tristram but he wanne the
degree / So he had not ben ouermatched with many knights / and of the death of
sire Lamorak said sire Tristram hit was over great pity / for I dare say / he
was the clenest myted man and the best wynded of his age / that was on live /
for I knew him that he was the byggest knight that ever I met with all but
if hit were sire Lancelot / Allas said sire Tristram full woo is me for his
death / And if they were not the cosyns of my lord Arthur that slew him / they
should dye for hit / and all tho that were consentyng to his death / And for
such things said sire Tristram I fear to draw unto the court of my lord
Arthur / I will that ye wete hit said sire Tristram unto Gare^h / Sire I blame
you not said Gareth / For well I understand the vengeance of my brethren sire
Gawayne / Agrauayne / Gaherys / and Mordred / But as for me said sire Gareth I
meddle not of their matters therefore there is none of them that loves me / And
for I understand they be murderers of good knights I left their company /
and god would I had been by said Gareth when the noble knight sire Lamorak was
slain / Now as Ihesu be my help said sir Tristram / it is well said of you /
for I had lever than all the gold betwixe this and Rome I had been there / ye wys
said palomydes and so would I had been there / and yet had I never the degree at
no Iustes nor turnement there as he was / but he put me to the werse or on foot
or on horsbak / and that day that he was slain he did the most deeds of arms
that ever I saw knight do in all my life days

And when him was given the degree by my lord Arthur / sire Gawayne and his
three brethren Agrauayne / Gaherys and sire Mordred set upon sire Lamorack in
a pryuy place / and there they slew his horse / and so they fought with him on
foot more than three hours both biforne him and behynd him / and sire Mordred
gaf him his dethes wound / behind him at his bak / and all to hew him / for
one of his squyers told me that saw hit / Fie upon treason said sir Trystram /
for hit kylleth my heart to here this tale / So it does mine said Gareth
brethren as they be mine I shall never love them nor draw in their felauship
for that deed / Now speak we of other deeds said Palomydes / and let him be /
for his life ye may not get again / that is the more pity said Dynadan / For
sire Gawayne and his brethren except you sire Gareth / haten all the good
knights of the round table for the most party / for well I wot and they might
pryuely / they hate my lord sire Lancelot and al his kynne / and great pryuy
despyte they have at him / and that is my lord sire lancelot well ware of /
and that causes him to have the good knights of his kyn about him /

Capitulum lix
Sire said Palomydez let us leave of this matere / and let us see how we
shall do at this turnement / By mine advise said Palomydes let us four hold
to gyders ageynste all that will come / Not by my counceil said sire Tristram /
for I see by their pauelions there will be four honderd knights / and doubt ye
not said sir Tristram but there will be many good knights / and be a man never
so valiant nor so bygge / yet he may be ouermatched / And so have I seen
knights done many times / And when they wend best to have won worship they
lost hit / For manhood is not worth / but if it be meddled with wisdom / And
as for me said sir Trystram hit may happen I shall keep mine own head as well
as another / So thus they rode until that they came to humber bank where they
herd a cry and a doleful noise / Then were they ware in the wind where came
a rich vessel hylled over with reed sylke / and the vessel londed fast by them
/ There with sire Tristram alyghte and his knights / And so sire Tristram
went before and entered in to that vessel And when he came within he saw a
fair bed rychely couerd / and there upon lay a deed semely knight all
armed sauf the head was al bebledde with dedely wounds upon him / the which
seemed to be a passing good knight / How may this be said sire Tristram / that
this knight is thus slain / Then sire Tristram was ware of a letter in the
deed knytes hand / Master maronners said sire Tristram what means that
letter / Sire said they / in that letter ye shall here and know hou he was
slain / and for what cause / and what was his name / But sire said the
maronners wete ye well that no man shall take that letter and read hit but if he
be a good knight / and that he will feythfully promise to revenge his death /
else shall there no knight see that letter open / wete ye well said sir Tristram
that sum of us may revenge his death as well as other And if hit be so as ye
maronners say / his death shall be revenged / And there with sire Tristram
took the letter out of the knights hand / and hit said thus / Harmaunce
king and lord of the reed Cite I send unto all knights erraunt
recommaundynge unto you noble knights of Arthurs court I byseche them all
among them to find one knight that will fight for my sake with two
brethren that I brought up of naught and felonsly and traytourly they have
slain me / wherefore I byseche one good knight to revenge my death And he that
revenged my death I will that he have my read Cite and all my castles / Sire
said the maronners wete ye well this king and knight that here lies was a full
worshipful man and of full great prowess / and full well he loved all manner
knights errauntes / So god me help said sire Tristram here is a pyteous caas
/ and full feign I would take this enterprise upon me / but I have made such a
promise that needs I must be at this great turnement / or else I am shamed For
well I wot for my sake in especyal my lord Arthur let make this Iustes and
turnement in this country / and well I wot that many worshipful people will
be there at that turnement for to see me / therefore I fere me to take this
enterprise upon me that I shall not come again by time to this Iustys Sir said
Palomydes / I pray you give me this enterprise / and ye shall see me encheue it
worshipfully / outher else I shall dye in this quarrel / well said sire Tristram /
and this enterpryce I give you with this that ye be with me at this turnement /
that shall be as this day seven night / Sire said Palomydes / I promise you
that I shall be with you by that day / if I be vnslayne or vnmaymed

Then departed sire Tristram / Gareth / and sir Dynadan / and left sire
Palomydes in the vessel / and so sir Tristram beheld the maronners how they
sailed over long humber / And when sir Palomydes was out of their syghte /
they took their horses and beheld about them / And then were they ware of a
Knight that came rydyng against them unarmed / and nothing about him but a
swerd / And when this knight came nyghe them / he salewed them / and they him
again / Fair knights said that knight I pray you in so much as ye be
knights erraunt that ye will come and see my castle and take such as ye
find there / I pray you hertely / and so they rode with him until his Castle
/ and there they were brought in to the halle that was well apparailled and so
they were there unarmed and set at a board / and when this knight saw sire
Tristram anon he knew him / And then this Knight waxed pale and wroth at
sir tristram / when sire Tristram saw his host make such chere / he
merueylled and said Sire mine host what chere make you wete thou well said he I
fare the werse for the / for I know the sir Tristram de lyones / thou slewest
my brother / And therefore I give the somons I will flee the / and ever I may
get the at large / Sir knight said sir Tristram I am never aduysed that ever I
slew any brother of yours / And if ye say that I did I will make amendys unto
my power / I will none amendys said the knyt but keep the from me / So when he
had dyned sir Tristram asked his arms and departed / and so they rode on their
ways / and within a while / sir Dynadan saw where came a knyt well armed and
well horsed without shield / sire Tristram said sir Dynadan take keep to your
self / for I dar undertake yonder comes your host that will have ado with you
Let him come said sir Tristram I shall abide him as well as I may / anon the
knight when he came nyghe sir Tristram he cried and bad him abide and keep
him / So they hurtled to gyders / but sir Tristram smote the other knight so
sore that he bare him over his horse croupe / That knight arose lyghtely and
took his horse again / and so rode fyersly to sir Tristram and smote him twyes
hard upon the helm / Sir knyte said sir Tristram I pray you leave of and smite
me no more / for I would be loathe to dele with you / and I myt chese / for I
have your mete and your drink within my body / for all that he would not leave /
and then sir Tristram gaf him such ^ buffet upon the helm that he fell up
so down fro his horse / that the blood brast out at the ventayls of his helm
/ and so he lay still lykely to be deed / Then sire Tristram said me
repents of this buffet that I smote so sore / for as I suppose he is deed /
and so they left him and rode on their ways / So they had not ryden but a
while but they saw rydyng against them two full lykely knights well armed and
well horsed and goodly servants about them / the one was Berrannt le apres /
and he was called the king with the honderd Knytes and the other was sir
Segwarydes which were renomed two noble Knights / So as they came either by
other / the King looked upon sir Dynadan that at that time he had sire
Tristrams helm upon his sholder / the which helm the king had seen to fore
with the Queen of Northgalys / and that queen the king loved as peramour / and
that helm the queen of north galys had given to la Beale Isoud / and the queen
la Beale Isoud gaf it to sir Tristram / Sir Knight said Berraunt where had ye
that helm / what would ye said sire Dynadan / for I will have adoo with the
said the king for the love of her that owed that helm / and therefore keep you
/ So they departed and came to gyders with all their myghtes of their horses
/ and there the king with the honderd knights smote sire Dynadan horse and all
to the earth / and then he commanded his servant goo and take thou his
helm of / and keep hit / So the varlet went to vnbockel his helm / What
helm / what wolt thou do said sir Tristram / leave that helm to what entente
said the king will ye sire knight meddle with that helm / Wete you well said
sir Tristram that helm shall not depart from me or it be derer boughte /
Then make you ready said sir Beraunce unto sire Tristram / So they hurtled to
gyders / and there sir Tristram smote him down over his horse tail / / and
then the king arose lyghtely / and gatte his horse lyghtely again / And
then he struck fyersly at sire Tristram many great strokes / And then sire
Tristram gaf^ sir Beraunce such a buffet upon the helm / that he fell^ down
over his horse sore stonyed / Loo said Dynadan that helm is unhappy to us
tweyne / for I had a fall for hit / and now sir king have ye another fake /

Then Segwarydes asked who shall Just with me / I pray the said sire Gareth
unto Dynadan / let me have this Iustes / sir said Dynadan I pray you take it
as for me / that is no reason said tristra^ / for this Iustes should be yours /
At a word said Dynadan I will not thereof / Then Gareth dressid him to sire
Segwarides / and there sire Segwarides smote Gareth and his horse to the earth /
Now said sir Tristram to Dynadan Just with yonder knight / I will not thereof
said Dynadan / Then will I said sir Tristram / and then sir Tristram ran
to him / and gaf him a fall / and so they left them on foot / and sire
Tristram rode unto Joyous guard / and there sir Gareth would not of his curtosy
have gone in to this castle / but sire Tristram would not suffer him to depart
/ And so they alyghte and unarmed them / and had great chere / But when
Dynadan came before la Beale Isoud he cursed the time that ever he bare sir
Tristrams helm / and there he told her how sire Tristram had mocked him /
Then was there laughyng and Iapynge at sir Dynadan that they wiste not what
to do with him

Capitulum lxj
NOw will we leave them merry within Joyous guard and speak we of sir palomydes /
then sir palomydes sailled even longes hu^ber to the costs of the sea /
where was a fair castle / And at that time hit was erly in the morning before
day / Then the maronners went unto sire palomydes / that slepte fast / Sire
knight said the maronners ye must arise / for here is a castle there ye
must goo in to / I assente me said sire Palomydes / and there with all he
aryued / And then he blewe his horn that the maronners had yeuen him / And
when they within the Castle herd that horn / they put forth many knights
and there they stood upon the walls / and said with one voys / welcome be ye
to this castle / and then it waxed clear day / and sire Palomydes entered in
to the castle / And within a while he was served with many diverse metes /
Then sire Palomyders herd about him much weeping and great dole / what may
this mean said sir palomydes / I love not to here such a sorou / and feign I
would know what it means / then there came before him one whose name was sir
Ebel that said thus wete ye well sir knight this dole and sorrow is here made
every day / And for this cause / we had a king that hight Hermaunce and he
was king of the ^^ed cite / and this king that was lord / was a noble knight
large and lyberal of his expense / And in the world he loved no thing so
much as he did erraunt knytes of king Arthurs court / and all Iustynge
hunting and al manner of knytly games / for so kind a king and knight had
never the rule of pour people as he was / and by cause of his goodenes and
gentylnesse we bemone him / and ever shall / And all kings and estates may
beware by our lord for he was destroyed in his own defaute / for had he
cherisshed them of his blood / he had yet lived with great richesse and rest
/ but all estates may beware by our king / But allas said Ebel that we shall
give all other warning by his death / Tell me said palomydes / and in what
manner was your lord slain and by whom / Sir said sir Ebel / our king
brought up of children two men that now are peryllous knights / and these two
knights our king had so in cherete that he loved no man nor trusted no man
of his blood / nor none other that was about him / And by these two knights
our king was governed / and so they ruled him peasybly and his lands / and
never would they suffer none of his blood to have no rule with our king / And
also he was so free and so gentyl / and they so falls and deceyuable that they
ruled him peasybly / and that aspyed the lords of our kings blood / and
departed from him unto their own lyuelode / Then when these two traitors
understood that they had driven all the lords of his blood from him / they
were not pleased with that rule / but then they thought to have more / as
ever hit is an old saw / give a chorle rule / and there by he will not be
suffysed / for what someuer he be that is ruled by a vylayne born and the lord
of the soil to be a gentilman born / that same vylayne shall destroy all
the gentylmen about him / therefore al estates and lords / beware / whom ye
take about you / And if ye be a knight of King Arthurs court remember this
tale / for this is the end and conclusion / my lord and king rode unto the
forest here by by the advise of these traitors / and there he chaced at the
reed dear armed at all pye^es full like a good knight / and so for labor he
waxed dry / And then he alyghte / and drank at a well / And when he was a
light by the assente of these two traitors that one that hight Helyus he
suddenly smote our king through the body with a spear / and so they left him
there / And when they were departed / then by fortune I came to the well /
and fond my lord and king wounded to the death / And when I herd his complaynte
/ I let bring him to the water side / and in that same ship I put him a live
/ And when my lord king hermaunce was in that vessel / he required me for the
true feyth I owed unto him for to write a letter in this manner /

adventure his life with these two traitors for my sake in one batail I king
hermau^ce king of the read cite freely give him all my lands and rentes that
ever I welded in my life / This letter said Ebel I wrote by my lords
commandment / and then he received his creatoure / and when he was deed /
he commanded me or ever he were cold to put that letter fast in his hand / And
then he commanded me to put forth that same vessel down humber / and I
should give these maronners in commandment never to stynte until that they
came unto Logris where all the noble knights shall assemble at this time / and
there shall sum good knight have pity on me to revenge my death / for there
was never king nor lord falslyer ne traitourlyer slain than I am here to my
death / Thus was the complaynte of our king Hermau^ce / Now said sir Ebel ye
know all how our lord was bitrayed / we require you for gods sake have pity
upon his death / and worshipfully revenge his death / and then may ye weld
all thise lands / For we all wete well / that and ye may slay these two
traitors the reed cite and all tho that been therein will take you for their
lord / Truly said sire Palomydes hit greueth my heart for to here you tell
this doleful tale / and to say the truth I saw the same letter that ye
speak of / and one of the best knights on the earth read that letter to me /
and by his commandment I came hydder to revenge your Kings death / and therefore
have done / and let me wete where I shall find tho traitors / for I shall
never be at ease in my heart till I be in hands with them / Sir said sire Ebel
then take your ship again / and that ship must bring you unto the
delectable isle fast by the reed Cite / and we in this castle shall pray for
you / and abide your again coming / for this same castle and ye speed well
must needs be yours / for our king Harmaunce let make this castle for the
love of the two traitors / and so we kept it with strong hand / and
therefore full sore are we threted / wot ye what ye shall do said sir Palomydes
what sum ever come of me / look ye keep well this castle / for and it
mysfortune me so to be slain in this quest / I am sure there will come one of
the best knights of the world for to revenge my death / and that is sir
Tristram de lyones or else sir Lancelot du lake

Then sir Palomydes departed from that castle / And as he came nyghe the Cite
/ there came out of a ship a goodly knyt armed against him with his shield on
his sholder / and his hand upon his swerd / And anon as he came nyghe sir
Palomydes he said sir knight what seek ye here / leave this queste for it is
mine / and mine it was or ever it was yours / and therefore I will have hit / Sir
knight said Palomydes it may well be that this quest was yours or it was mine /
but when the letter was take out of the deed kings hand at that time by
lykelyhode there was no knight had undertake to revenge the death of the king /
And so at that time I promised to revenge his death / And so I shall or else
I am ashamed / ye say well said the knight / but wete ye well then will I
fyte with you / and who be the better knight of us both / let him take the
bataille upon hand / I assente me said sire Palomydes / and then they dressid
their sheldes / and pulled out their swerdes and lasshed to gyder many sad
strokes as men of might / and this fytyng was more than hour / but at the
last sir Palomydes waxed bygge and better wynded / so that then he smote
that knight such a stroke / that he made him to knele upon his knees / Then
that knight spak on high / and said gentle knight hold thy hand / Sir
Palomydes was goodely and with drew his hand / Then this knight said wete ye
well knyt that thou art better worthy to have this bataille than I / and
require the of knygthode tell me thy name / Sir my name is Palomydes a knight
of King Arthurs and of the table round that hyder I came to revenge the death
of this deed king

Capitulum lxiij
Well be ye fond said the knygyte to Palomydes / for of all knights that been
on live except three I had leuest have you / The first is sire Lancelot du
lake and sir Tristram de lyones / the third is my ny cosyn sir Lamorck de galys
/ and I am brother unto king Harmaunce that is deed and my name is sir Hermynde
/ ye say well said sir Palomydes / and ye shall see how I shall speed / and if I
be there slain / goo ye to my lord sir lau^celot or else to my lord sir Tristram
/ and pray them to revenge my death / for as for sir Lamorak him shall ye never
see in this world / Allas said sir Hermynde how may that be / he is slain said
sire Palomydes by sire Gawayne and his brethren / So god me help said
Hermynd there was not one for one that slew him / that is truth said sire
Palomydes / for they were four dangerous knights that slew him / as Sir
Gawayne / sir A grauayne / sire Gaherys and sire Mordred / but sire Gareth the
fyfthe brother was awey / the best knight of them all / And so sire Palomydes
told Hermynde all the manner / and how they slew sir Lamorak all only by
treason So sir Palomydes took his ship / and aryued up at the delectable isle /
And in the mean while sir Hermynde that was the kings brother he arrived up
at the reed Cite / and there he told them how there was comen a knight of
king Arthurs to avenge king Hermaunce death / and his name is sire Palomydes
the good knight / that for the most party he follows the best Glatysaunt /
Then all the Cite made great Joy / for mykel had they herd of sire
Palomydes and of his noble prowess / So let they ordeyne a messager and
sent unto the / ij / brethren / and had them to make them ready / for there
was a knight comen that would fight with them both / So the messager went
unto them where they were at a Castle there beside and there he told them how
there was a knight comen of king Arthurs court to fight with them both at
ones / he is welcome said they / But tell us we pray you if hit be sire
lancelot or any of his blood / he is none of that blood said the messager /
then we care the less said the two brethren / for with none of the blood of
sire lancelot we keep not to have a do with all / wete ye well said the
messager that his name is sire Palomydes that yet is vncrystened a noble knight
/ well said they and he be now vncrystened / he shall never be crystend / So
they appointed to be at the cite within two days / And when sire Palomydes
was come to the Cite they made passing great Joy of him / and then they
beheld him / and saw that he was well made / clenely and byggely / and vnmaymed
of his lymmes / and neither to young nor to old / and so all the people
preysed him / and though he was not crystened yet he byleued in the best manner
/ and was fulfeythful and true of his promise / and well condycyoned / And by
cause he made his auowe that he would never be crystened unto the t^me that he
had encheued the best Glatysaunt / the which was a full wonderful be and a
great sygnyfycacyon / for Merlyn profecyed much of that be / And also sire
Palomydes auowed never to take full crystendome unto the time that he had done
seven batails within the lystys / So within the third day there came to the
Cite these two brethren / the one hight Helyus / the other hit Helake / the
which were men of great prowess how be hit that they were falls and full of
treason / and but pour men borne / yet were they noble bnytes of their hands
/ And with hem they brought forty knights to that intent / that they should be
bygge enough for the reed Cite / Thus came the two brethren with great
bo^aunce and pride / for they had put the reed Cite in fere and damage /
Then they were brought to the lystes / and sire Palomydes came in to the
place and said thus / be ye the two brethren Helyus and Helake that slew your
king and lord sir Hermaunce by felony and treason / for whom that I am comen
hyder to revenge his death / wete thou well said sir Helyus and sir Helake that
we are the same knights that slew king Harmaunce / And wete thou well sire
Palomydes sarasyn / that we shall handle the so or thou depart that thou
shall wysshe that thou werest crystened / Hit may well be said sir Palomydes /
for yet I would not dye or I were crystened / and yet so am I not aferd of you
both / but I trust to god that I shall dye a better christian man than any of you
both / and doubt ye not said sir Palomydes either ye or I shall be left deed
in this place

Capitulum lxiiij
Then they departed and the two brethren came against sir Palomydes / and he
against them as fast as their horses might run / And by fortune sir Palomydes
smote Helake thorou his shield and through the breast more than a fadom / All
this while sir Helyus held up his spear / and for pride and orgulyte he would
not smite sire Palomydes with his spear / but when he saw his brother lie on
the earth / and fawe be myt not ^el^e him self / then he said unto sir
palomydes help thy self / and there with he came hurtlynge unto sir Palomydes
with his spear / and smote him quyte from his sadel Then sire Helyus rode
over sir Palomydes twyes or thryes And there with sir Palomydes was ashamed /
and gat the horse of sir Helyus by the brydel / and therewith all the horse areryd
/ and sir Palomydes halp after / and so they fell both to the earth / but
anon sir Helyus starte up lyghtely and there he smote sir Palomydes a great
stroke upon the helm that he kneled upon his own knee / Then they lasshed
to gyder many sad strokes / and tracyd and trauercyd now bakward / now sydelyng
hurtlyng to gyders like two lores / and that same time they fell both
grouelyng to the earth / Thus they fought still without / any reposynge two
hours and never brethed / and then sir Palomydes waxed faint and weary / and
sir Helyus waxed passing strong and doubled his strokes / and drofe sir
Palomydes overthwart and endlonge all the feld / that they of the cite when
they saw sir Palomydes in this caas they wept and cried and made great dole /
and the other party made as great joye / Allas said the men of the Cite that
this noble knight should thus be slain for our kings sake / and as they were
thus weeping and cryeng / sir Palomydes that had suffered an honderd strokes that
it was wonder / that he stood on his feet / At the last sire Palomydes beheld
as he might the comen people how they wept for him / and then he said to him
self / A fie for shame sir palomydes why hangest thou thy head so low / and
there with he bare up his sheld / and looked sir Helyus in the vysage / and he
smote him a great stroke upon the helm / and after that another and another /
And then he smote sir Helyus with such a might that he fell to the earth
grouelynge / and then he rassyd of his helm from his head / and there he
smote him such a buffet that he departed his head from the body / And then
were the people of the Cite the Ioyefullest people that might be / So they
brought him to his lodging with great solempnyte / and there all the people
became his men / And then sire Palomydes prayed them all to take keep unto
all the lordship of King Hermaunce / for fair sirs wete ye well I may not as
at this time abide with you / for I must in all haste be with my lord king
Arthur at the castle of Lonazep the which I have promised / Then was the
people full heavy at his departing / for all that Cite proffered sir Palomydes
the third part of their goods / so that he would abide with hem / but in no
wise as at that time he would not abide / and so sire Palomydes departed / and
so he came unto the castle there as sire Ebel was lieutenaunt / And when
they in the castle wyste hou sire Palomydes had sped there was a Ioyeful meyny
/ and so sir Palomydes departed / and came to the castle of Lonazep / And
when he wys^ that sire Tristram was not there / he took his way over humber
and came unto Joyous guard where as sir Tristram was and la Beale Isoud / Sir
Tristram had commanded that what knight erraunt came within the Joyous guard as
in the town that they should warn sire Tristram / So there came a man of the
town / and told sire Tristram how there was a Knight in the town a passing
goodely man / what manner of man is he said sire Tristram / and what sign
bears he / So the man told sire Tristram all the tokens of him / that is
Palomydes said Dynadan / it may well be said sir Tristram / go ye to him said
sire Tristram unto Dynadan / So Dynadan went unto sire Palomydes / and there
either made of other great Joy / and so they lay to gyder that night / And
on the morn erly came sire Tristram and sire Gareth / and took them in their
beds / and so they arose and brake their fast

Capitulum lxv
ANd then sire Tristram desired sire Palomydes to ride in to the feldes and
woods / So they were accorded to repose them in the foreste / And when they
had played them a great while / they rode unto a fair well / and anon they
were ware of an armed knight that came rydyng ageynste them / and there either
salewed other / Then this armed knight spak to sire Tristram and asked what
were these knights that were lodged in Joyous guard / I wot not what they are
said sir Tristram / what knytes be ye said that knyte for me seems ye be no
knights erra^nt by cause ye ride unarmed / whether we be Knights or not / we
list not to tell the our name / will thou not tell me thy name said that
knight / then keep the for thou shall dye of my hands / and therewith he
gate his spear in his hands / and would have run sir Tristram through / that
saw sir palomydes / and smote his horse trauerse in mids of the side that man
and horse fell to the earth / And there with sire palomydes alyghte and pulled
out his swerd to have slain him / let be said sir Tristram / slay him not /
the knight is but a fool / it were shame to slay him but take awey his spear
said sire Tristram / and let him take his horse and goo where that he will /
So when this knight arose he groned sore of the fall / and so he took his
horse / and when he was up / he turned then his horse and required sir Tristram
and sir palomydes to tell him what knights they were / Now wete ye well said
sir Tristram that my name is sir Tristram de Lyones / and this knights name is
sir palomydes / when he wyste what they were / he took his horse with the spores
by cause they should not ask him his name / and so rode fast awey through thyck
and thynne / Then came there by them a knight with a bented sheld of asure
whose name was Epynogrys / and he came toward them a great wallop / whether or ye
riding said sir Tristram / my fair lords said Epynogrys I follow the falsest
knight that bears the life wherefore I require you tell me whether ye saw him /
for he bears a shield with a caas of reed over it / So god me help said
Tristram such a knyt departed from us not a quarter of an hour agon we pray
you tell us his name / Allas said Epynogrys why let ye him escape from you /
and he is so great a fo unto al erraunt knights his name is Breuse saunce
pity / A fie for shame said sire palomydes / Allas that ever he escaped mine
hands / for he is the man in the world that I hate most / Then every
knight made great sorrow to other / and so Epynogrys departed and followed the
chase after him / Then sir Tristram and his three felawes rode unto Joyous
guard / and there sir Tristram talked unto sire palomydes of his batail hou he
sped at reed Cite / and as ye have herd before so was hit ended / Truly said
sir Tristram I am glad ye have well sped for ye have done worshipfully / well
said sir Tristram we must forward to mien / and then he devised how it should
be / and sir Tristram devised to send his two pauelions to set them fast by
the well of Lonazep / and therein shall be the Queen la beale Isoud / Hit is
well said / said sir Dynadan but when sire Palomydes herd of that / his heart
was rauysshed out of mesure / Not withstanding he said but little / So when
they come to Joyous guard / sire Palomydes would not have gone in to the castle /
but as sire Tristram took him by the finger / and ladde him in to the castle /
And when sire Palomydes saw la Beale Isoud he was rauysshed so that he
might uneath speak / So they went unto mete / but Palomydes might not ete /
and there was all the chere that might be had / And on the morn they were
apparaylled to ride toward Lonazep / So sir Tristram had three squyers / and la
beale Isoud had three gentylwymmen and both the Queen and they were rychely
apparailled / and other people had they none with them / but varlets to bear
their sheldes and their speres And thus they rode forth / So as they rode /
they saw before them a route of knights / hit was the knight Galyhodyn with /
xx / knights with him / Fair felawes said Galyhodyn / yonder comen four
knights and a rich and a well fair lady / I am in will to take that lady fro
them / That is not of the best counceil said one of Galyhodyns men / but send
ye to them / and wete what they will say / and so hit was done / there came
a squire unto sire Tristram / and asked them whether they would Just or else to
lose their lady / Not so said sire Tristram tell your lord I bid him come as
many as we ben and win her and take her / Sire said Palomydes and hit please
you let me have this deed / and I shall undertake them all four / I will
that ye have it said sire Tristram at your pleasyr / Now goo and tell your
lord Galyhodyn / that this same knight will encountre with him and his felawes

Capitulum lxvj
Then this squire departed and told Galyhodyn / and then he dressid his
shield / and put forth a spear / and sir Palomydes another / and there sire
Palomydes smote Galyhodyn so hard that he smote both horse and man to the
earth And there he had an horrible fall / And then came there an other knight
/ and in the same wise he served him / and so he scrued the third and the
fourth that he smote them over their horse croupes / and alweyes sire
Palomydes spear was hole / Then came six knights moo of Galyhodyns men /
and would have been avenged upon sire Palomydes / let be said sir Galyhodyn not
so hardy / none of you all meddle with this knight / for he is a man of great
bounte and honor / and if he would ye were not able to meddle with him / and
right so they held them still / And ever sire Palomydes was ready to Just /
And when he saw they would no more / he rode unto sire Tristram / Right well
have ye done said sir Tristram / and worshypfully have ye done as a good
knight should / This Galyhodyn was nyghe cosyn unto Galahalt the haute prince
And this Galyhodyn was a king within the country of Surluse / So as sir
Tristram / sir Palomydes / and la Beale Isoud rode to gyders they saw before
them four knights and every man had his spear in his hand / the first was sire
Gawayne / the second sir Vwayne / the third sir Sagramor ledesyrus / and the
fourth was Dodynas le saueage / When sir palomydes beheld them that the four
knytes were ready to Just / he praid sir Tristram to give him / leave to have
adoo with them also long as he might hold him on horsbak / And if that I le
smyten down I pray you revenge me / well said sire Tristram I will as ye will
/ and ye are not so feign to have worship but I would as feign encreace your
worship / and there with all sir Gawayne put forth his spear / and sir
Palomydes another / and so they came so egerly to gyders that sir Palomydes
smote sire Gawayne to the earth / horse and all / and in the same wife he
served Vwayne / sir Dodynas / and Sagramore / All these four knytes sir
Palomydes smote down with dyuers^ speres / And then sire Tristram departed
toward Lonezep / And when they were departed then came thydder Galyhodyn
with his x knytes unto sir Gawayne / and there he told him all how he had sped
/ I merueyle said sire Gawayne what knights they ben / that are so arrayed in
grene / and that knyt upon the white horse smote me down said galihodyn and my /
iij / felaws / and so he did to me said gawayn / and well I wot said sire
Gawayne that outher he upon the white horse is sire Tristram or else sire
Palomydes / and that gay bysene lady is queen Isoud / Thus they talked of one
thing and of other And in the mean while sir Tristram passed on / till that he
came to the well where his two pauelions were set / and there they alyghted
/ and there they fawe many pauelions and great array / Then sire Tristram
left there sire Palomydes and sire Gareth with la beale Isoud / and sir
Tristram and sire Dynadan rode to Lonezep to harken tidings / and sire
Tristram rode upon sire Palomydes white horse / And when he came in to the
castle / sir Dynadan herd a great horn blow / and to the horn drew many
Knights / Then sire Tristram asked a Knight what means the blast of that
horn / Sir said that Knight it is all tho that shall hold against king

Surluse / the King of Lystynoyse / the king of Northumberland / and the king
of the best part of walys / with many other countries / and these draw them
to a counceylle to understand what governance they shall be of / but the
King of Irland whose name was Marhalt and fader to the good knight sir Marhaus
that sire Tristram slew had all the speech that sir Tristram might here it /
He said lords and felawes let us look to our self / for wete ye well King
Arthur is sure of many good Knights / or else he would not with so few
knights have adoo with us / therefore by my counceyl late every King have a
standard and a cognoissaunce by him self that every knight draw to their
naturel lord and then may every King and capytayne help his knytes if they
have need / when sir Tristram had herd all their counceyl / he rode unto King
Arthur for to here of his counceyl

But sir Tristram was not so soon come in to the place but sire Gawayne and
sir Galyhodyn went to king Arthur and told him that same grene Knyte in the
grene harneis with the white horse smote* us two down / and / vj / of our
felawes this same day / well said Arthur / and then he called sir Tristram and
asked him what was his name / Sire said sire Tristram ye shall hold me
excused as at this time / for ye shall not wete my name / And there sir
Tristram returned and rode his way / I have merueylle said Arthur that yonder
knight will not tell me his name / but goo thou Gryflet le fyse de dieu / and
pray him to speak with me betwixe us / Then sire Gryflet rode after him and
ouertoke him / and said him that king Arthur praid him fo: to speak with him
secretly a part / upon this covenant said sir tristram I will speak with
him that I will torn again / so that ye will ensure me not to desire to
here my name / I shall undertake said sir Gryflet that he will not gretely
desire hit of you / So they rode to gyders until they came to king Arthur /
Fair sir said King Arthur what is the cause ye will not tell me your name /
Sir said sir Tristram without a cause I will not hyde my name / upon what
party will ye hold said king Arthur / Truly my lord said sir Tristram I wot
not yet on what party I will be on until I come to the field And there as my
heart gives me / there will I hold / but to morrow ye shall see and preue on
what party I shall come and there with all he returned and went to his
pauelions / And upon the morn they armed them all in grene / and came in to
the field / and there young knights began to Just and did many worshipful
deeds / Then spacke Gareth unto sire Tristram and praid him to give him leave
to break his spear for him thought shame to bear his spear hole again / when
sir Tristram herd him say so he lough / and said I pray you do your best /
Then sir Gareth gate a spear and proffered to Just / That saw a knight that
was neuewe unto the king of the honderd knights / his name was Selyses and a
good man of arms / So this knight Selyses then dressid him unto sir Gareth
/ and they two met to gyders so hard / that either smote other down horse
and all to the earth / so they were both brysed and hurt and there they lay
till the King with the honderd knights halp Selyses up / and sir Tristram and
sir Palomydes halpe up Gareth again / and so they rode with sir Gareth unto
their pauelions / and then they pulled of his helm / And when la Beale
Isoud saw sire Gareth brysed in the face / she asked him what eyled him /
Madame said sire Gareth I had a great buffet / and as I suppose I gaf another /
but none of my felawes god thank them would not rescowe me / Forsothe said
Palomydes hit longed not to none of us as this day to Just / for there have
not this day Iusted no preued knights / and nede^y ye would Just / And when
the other party saw ye prof^red your self to Just / they sonte one to you a
passing good knight of his age / for I know him well his name is Selyses / and
worshipfully ye met with him / and neither of you are dishonored / and therefore
refresshe your self that ye may be ready and hole to Just to morrow / As for
that said Gareth I shall not fail you and I may bestryde mine horse /

NOw upon what party said Tristram is hit best / we be with all as to morn /
Sir said Palomydes ye shall have mine advise to be against King Arthur as to
morn for on his party will be sire Lancelot and many good knights of his
blood with him / And the moo men of worship that they be / the more worship we
shall we win / That is full knyghtely spoken said sir Tristram / and right
so as ye counceile me / so will we do / In the name of god said they all
So that might they were lodged with the best / And on the mo^ne when it was
day they were arrayed all in grene trap pours sheldes and speres / and la Beale
Isoud in the same color and her three damoysels / And right so these four
knights came in to the feld endlonge and through / And so they led la beale
Isoud thither as she should stand and behold all the Iustes in a bay wyndowe /
but al ways she was wympeld that no man myt see her vysage / And then these
three knytes rode straight unto the party of the king of Scotts / when King
arthur had seen him do all this he asked sir lau^celot what were these knytes
and that queen / sir said lancelot I can not say you in certain / but if sir
Tristram be in this country or sir palomydes / wete ye well it be they in
certain / and la beale Isoud / Then Arthur called to him sire kay and said
goo lyghtely and wete how many knights there ben here lacking of the table
round / for by the seges thou maiste know / So went sir kay and saw by the
writing in the ^eges that there lacked ten knights / and these ben their
names that been not here / Sir Tristram / sir Palomydes / sir Percyuale / sir
Gaherys / sir Epynogry^ / sir Mordred / sire Dynadan / sir la cote male tail
and sir Pelleas the noble knyt well said arthur sum of these I dar undertake
ar here this day against us / Then came therein two brethren cosyns unto sire
Gawayne the one hight sir Edward / that other hyte sir Sadok the which were
two good knights / and they asked of King arthur that they might have the
first Iustes / for they were of Orkeney / I am pleased said King arthur /
Then sir Edward encountered with the King of Scotts / in whose party was sire
Tristram and sir Palomydes / and sire Edward smote the King of Scotts quyte
from his horse / and sir Sadok smote down the King of Northwalys / and gaf him
a wonder great fall that there was a great cry on king arthurs party / and
that made sir Palomydes passing wroth / and so sir palomydes dressid his
shield and his spear / and with all his might he met with sir Edward of
orkeney that he smote him so hard / that his horse might not stand on his
feet / and so they hurtled to the earth / and then with the same spear sir
Palomydes smote down sire Sadok over his horse croupe / O Ihesu said arthur
what Knight is that arrayed all in grene / he Iusteth myghtely / wete you well
said sir Gawayne he is a good Knight and yet shall ye see him Just better or
he depart / and yet shall ye see said sire Gawayne another bygger Knight in
the same color than he is / for that same Knight said sire Gawayn that smote
down right now my four cosyns / he smote me down within these two days and
seven felawes moo / This mean while as they stood thus talking there came in
to the place sir tristram upon a black horse / and or ever / he stynte he smote
down with one spear four good Knights of Orkeney that were of the Kynne of
sir Gawayn / and sir Gareth and sir Dynadan eueryche of them smote down a good
Knyt / Ihesu seid arthur yo^der knight upon the black horse does myghtely and
merueyllously well / Abide you said sir Gawayne that knight with the black horse
began not yet / Then sir Tristram made to horse again the two kings that
Edward and Sadok had unhorsed at the beginning / And then sire Tristram
drew his swerd and rode in to the thyckest of the prees against them of Orkeney
/ and there he smote down knights / and rasshed of helmes and pulled awey
their sheldes / and hurtled down many knights / he ferd so that sire Arthur
and all knights had great merueille when they saw one knight do so great
deeds of arms / and sire Palomydes failed not upon the other side / but did so
merueyllously well that al men had wonder / For there king Arthur lykened sire
Tristram that was on the black horse like to a wood lion / and lykened sir
palomydes upon the white horse unto a wood lybard / and sir Gareth and sir
Dynadan unto eger wolves / But the custom was such among them that none of
the kings would help other / but all the felauship of every standard to help
other as they might / but ever sire Tristram did so much deeds of arms that
they of Orkeney waxed weary of him / and so with drew them unto Lonezep

Capitulum lxix
Then was the cry of Heraudes and all manner of common people the grene
knight has done merueyllously and beten all them of Orkeney / and there the
heraudes nombred that sir Tristram that satte upon the black horse had smyten
down with speres and swerdes xxx knights / and sir palomydes had smyten down
twenty knights / and the most party of these / l / knytes were of the house of
king Arthur / and proved knytes / So god me help said Arthur unto sir lau^celot
this is a great shame to us to see four knights beat so many knights of mine
/ and therefore make you ready for we will have adoo with them / Sir said
lancelot wete ye well that there are two passing good knights and great
worship were hit not to us now to have adoo with them / for they have this day
sore trauaylled / As for that said Arthur I will be auengyd / and therefore take
with you sire Bleoberys and sir Ector / and I will be the fourth said Arthur
/ Sire said Lancelot ye shall find me ready / and my brother sir Ector and my
cosyn sir bleberys / And so when they were ready and on horsbak / Now chese
said sir Arthur unto sir lau^celot with whom that ye will encountre with all /
Sir, said Lancelot I will mete with the grene knight upon the black horse
that was sire Tristram / and my cosyn sir Bleoberys shall match the grene
knight upon the white horse that was sir Palomydes / and my brother sire Ector
shall match with the grene knyt upon the white horse that was sir Gareth /
Then must I said sir Arthur have a do with the grene knight upon the
gryseld horse / and that was sire Dynadan / Now every man take heed to his
felawe said sir lancelot / and so they trotted on to gyders / and there
encountered sire Lancelot ageynste sire Tristram / So sir Lancelot smote sir
Tristram so sore upon the shield that he bare horse and man to the earth / but
sir lancelot wend that it had been sire Palomydes and so he passed forth /
And then sire Bleoberys encountered with sire Palomydes / and he smote him so
hard upon the shield that sire Palomydes and his white horse rustled to the
earth Then sir Ector de marys smote sire Gareth so hard that down he fell
of his horse / And the noble king Arthur encountered with sir Dynadan / and he
smote him quyte from his sadel / And then the noise turned a while how the
grene knights were slain down / when the King of Northgalys saw that sire
Tristram had a fall / then he remembryd him how great deeds of arms sir
Tristram had done / Then he made ready many knights for the customme and cry
was such that what knight were smyten down and might not be horsed again by
his felawes outher by his own strength that as that day he should be prisoner
unto the party that had smyten him down / So came in the King of Northgalys
and he rode streyghte unto sire Tristram / And when he came nyghe him / he
alyghte down suddenly and bytoke sir Tristram his horse / and said thus Noble
knight* I know the not / of what country that thou art / but for the noble
deeds that thou haste done this day take there my horse / and let me do as well
I may For as Ihesu me help thou art better worthy to have mine horse than I
my self / Gramercy said sir Tristram / and if I may shall quyte you / look
that ye goo not far from us / And as I suppose I shall win you an other
horse / And there with sire Tristram mounted upon his horse / and there he met
with King Arthur / and he gaf him such a buffet upon the helm with his swerd
that king Arthur had no power to keep his sadel / And then sir Tristram gaf
the King of Northgalis king Arthurs horse / then was there great prees about
king Arthur for to horse him again / But sire Palomydes would not suffer king
Arthur to be horsed again / but ever sir Palomydes smote on the right hand and
on the lift hand myghtely as a noble knight / And this mean while sir
Tristra^ rode thorou the thyckest of the prees / and smote down knights on
the ryt and on the lift hand and racyd of helmes and so passed forth unto his
pauelions / and left sir Palomydes on foot / and sir Tristram changed his
horse and desguysed him self all in reed horse and harneis /

ANd when the Queen la Beale Isoud saw that sire Tristram was unhorsed and she
wist not where he was then she wept gretely / But sir Tristram when he was
ready came dashing lyghtely in to the feld / And then la Beale Isoud aspyed
him / and so he did great deeds of arms with one spear that was great / sir
Tristram smote down five knytes or ever he stynte / Then sir Lancelot
aspyed him redyly that it was sir Tristram and then he repentyd him that he
had smyten him down / and so sir Lancelot went out of the prees to repose
him and lyghtely he came again / and now when sir Tristram came in to the
prees thorou his great force / he put sire palomydes upon his horse / and sir
Gareth and sire Dynadan / and then they began to do merueyllously / but sir
Palomydes nor none of his two felawes knew not who had helped them on horsbak
again / But ever sire Tristram was nyghe them / and socoured them / and they
not him by cause he was changed in to reed armor / and all this while sir

his horsbak / she was passing glad / and then she lough and make good
chere / And as hit happend sir palomydes looked up toward her where she lay in
the wyndowe / and he aspyed how she laughed and there with he took such a
reioycynge that he smote down what with his spear and with his suerd all that
ever he met for through the syghte of her he was so enamoured in her love that
he seemed at that time / that and both sir Tristram and sir Lancelot had been
both against him they should have won no worship of him / and in his heart as
the book says sire Palomydes wysshed that with his worship he might have a
do with sir Tristram before all men by cause of la Beale Isoud / Then sire
Palomydes began to double his strength / and he did so merueyllously that
all men had wonder of him / and ever he cast up his eye unto la Beale Isoud /
And when he saw her make such chere / he ferd like a lion that there might
no man withstand him / and then sire Tristram beheld him how that sire
Palomydes bestured him / and then he said unto sir Dynadan / so god me help
sir Palomydes is a passing good knight and a well endurynge / But such deeds
saw I him never do / nor never herd I tell that ever he did so much in one
day / it is his day said Dynadan / and he would say no more unto sir Tristram /
but to him self he said / and if ye knew for whose love he does all these
deeds of arms / soon would sire Tristram abate his courage / Allas said sire
Tristram that sire Palomydes is not crystened / So said King Arthur / and so
said all tho that beheld him / Then all people gaf him the price as for the
best knight that day that he passed sir lancelot outher sire Tristram well said
Dynadan to him self all this worship that sire Palomydes has here this day
he may thank the Queen Isoud For had she ben aweye this day / sire Palomydes
had not geten the price this day Right so came in to the field sir lancelot
du lake and saw and herd the noise and cry and the great worship that sire
Palomydes had he dressid him against sir Palomydes with a great mighty spear /
and alonge / and thought to smite him down / And when sire Palomydes saw
sir lancelot come upon him so fast / he ran upon sire lancelot as fast with
his swerd as he might / and as sire lancelot should have stryken him / he smote
his spear on side / and smote it atwo with his swerd / And sir palomydes
rasshed unto sire lancelot and thought to have putt him to a shame / and with
his swerd he smote his horse neck that sire lancelot rode upon / and then sir
lancelot fell to the earth / Then was the cry huge and great / see how sir
Palomydes the sarasyn has smyten down sire launcelots horse Right then were
there many knights wroth with sire Palomydes by cause he had done that d^de /
therefore many knights held there against that it was vnknyghtely done in a
turnement to kylle an horse wilfully but that hit had been done in plain batail
life for life

When sir Ector de marys saw sir lancelot his brother have such a despyte /
and so set on foot / then he gat a spear egerly / and ran against sir
palomydes / and he smote him so hard that he bare him quyte from his horse /
that saw sir tristra^ that was in reed harneis / and he smote done sir Ector
de marys quyte from his horse / then sir lancelot dressid his sheld upon his
sholder / and with his suerd naked in his hand / and so came streyt upon sir
palomydes fyersly and said wete thou well thou have done me this day the
grettest despyte that ever any worshipful knyt did to me in turnement or in
Iustes / and therefore I will be auengid upon the / therefore take keep to your
self / A mercy noble knyt said palomydes / and forgive me mine unkindly deeds
for I have no power nor myt to withstand you / and I have done so much this
day that well I wot I did never so much nor never shall in my life days / and
therefore most noble knyt I require the spare me as at this day / and I promise
you I shall ever be your knyt while I live / And ye put me from my worship now
/ ye put me from the grettest worship that ever I had or ever shall have in
my life days / well said sire lancelot / I see for to say the sothe ye have
done merueyllously well this day / and I understand a part for whose love ye
do hit / and well I wot that love is a great maystresse And if my lady were
here as she nys not / wete you well said sire Palomydes ye should not bear awey
the worship / But beware your love be not discouerd / for and sir Tristram may
know hit ye will repent hit / And sythen my quarrel is not here / ye shall
have this day the worship as for me consyderyng the great trauaylle and pain
that ye have had this day / it were no worship for me to put you from hit /
And there with all sir lancelot suffered sit Palomydes to depart / Then sir
Lancelot by great force and might gate his own horse maulgre xx knights /
So when sire Lancelot was horsed / he did many merueylles / and so did sir
Tristram / and sire palomydes in like wyso / Then sir lau^celot smote down
with a spear sir Dynadan / and the king of scotland / and the king of walys /
and the king of Northumberland / and the king of Lystynes / So then sire
lau^celot and his felawes smote down well a forty knights / Then came the
king of Irland and the king of the streyte marches to rescowe sire Tristram
and sire Palomydes / There began a great meddle / and many knights were
smyten down on both parties / and alweyes sir lancelot spared sir Tristram /
and he spared him / And sir Palomydes would not meddle with sir lancelot / and
so there was hurtelynge here and there / And then King Arthur sent out
many knights of the table round / and sir palomydes was ever in the formest
front / and sire Trystram did so strongly well that the king and all other
had merueylle / And then the king let blow to lodging / and by cause sir
Palomydes began first / and never he went nor rode out of the feld to
repose / but ever he was doing merueyllously well outher on foot or on horsbak
/ and lengest during King Arthur and all the kings gaf sir Palomydes the
honor and the gree as for that day / Then sir Tristram commanded sir
Dynadan to fetch the Queen la Beale Isoud and bring her to his two pauelions
that stood by the well / And so Dynadan did as he was commanded / But when
sir Palomydes understood and wist that sire Tristram was in the reed armor /
and on the reed horse / wete ye well that he was glad and so was sir Gareth
and sire Dynadan / For they all wend that sire Trystram had be taken prisoner
And then every knight drew to his Inn / And then king Arthur and every
knight spoke of tho knights / but above all men they gaf sire Palomydes the
price / and all knights that knew sire Palomydes had wonder of his deeds /
Sire said sir Lancelot unto Arthur as for sir Palomydes and he be the grene
knight I dare say as for this day he is best worthy to have the degree / for
he reposyd him never / ne never changed his wedys / And he began first and
longest held on / and yet well I wot said sir Lancelot that there was a better
knight than he / and that shall be preued or we depart upon pain of my life /
Thus they talked on either party / and so sire Dynadan rayled with sir
Tristram and said what the devil is upon the this day / for sir palamydes
strength febled never this day but ever he doubled his strength

ANd thou sire Tristram faryst all this day as though thou had ben a
sleep / and therefore I call the coward well Dynadan said sir Tristram / I was
never called coward or now of no erthely knight in my life / and wete thou well
sir I call my self never the more coward though sire Lancelot gaf me a fall
/ for I out cepte him of al knights / And doubt ye not sir Dynadan and sir
Lancelot have a quarrel good / he is to over good for any knight that now is
living / and yet of his sufferaunce largess / bounte / and curtosy I call
him knight pyerles / and so sire Tristram was in manner wroth with sir Dynadan
/ But all this langage sir Dynadan said by cause he would anger sire Tristram
for to cause him to awake his spyrytes and to be wroth / for well knew sir
Dynadan that and sir Tristram were thorouly wroth sire Palomydes should not
get the price upon the morn / And for this enten^e sir Dynadan said all this
raylynge and langage against sir Tristram / Truly said sire palomydes / as for
sir lancelot of his noble knythode / curtosye and prowess / and gentilnes I
know not his pyere / for this day said sire Palomydes I did full vncurtoisly
unto sire lancelot and full vnknyghtely / and full knyghtely and curtoisly he
did to me again / for and he had been as vngentyl to me as I was to him this
day I had won no worship / And therefore said Palomydes I shall be sire
launcelots knight whiles my life lasts / This talking was in the howses of
Kings / But all kings lords and knights said of clear knyghthode / and of
pure strength / of bounte / of curtosye / sir Lancelot and sir Tristram bare
the price above all knights that ever were in Arthurs days / And there were
neu^r knights in Arthurs days did half so many deeds as they did / as the
book says / no ten knights did not half the deeds that they did and there was
never knight in their days that required sir lancelot or sire Tristram of
any quest so hit were not to their shame but they performed their desire

So on the morn sire Lancelot departed and sir tristram was ready and la
Beale Isoud with sir Palomydes and sir Gareth / And so they rode all in grene
full fresshely bysene unto the forest / and sir Tristram left sir Dynadan
slepynge in his bed / and so as they rode / it happ^d the king and lancelot
stood in a wyndowe / and saw sire Tristram ride and Isoud / Sire said
Lancelot yonder rydeth the fairest lady of the world except your queen Dame
Gueneuer / who is that said sir Arthur / Sir said he / it is queen Isoud that
out taken my lady your queen she is makeles / Take your horse said Arthur / and
array you at all rytes as I will do / and I promise you said the king / I
will see her / Then anon they were armed and horsed / and either took a
spear and rode unto the forest / Sire said lancelot it is not good that ye goo
to nyghe them / for wete ye well there are two as good knights as now are
living / and therefore sir I pray you be not to hasty / For peradventure there
will be sum knights ben displeased and we come suddenly upon them / As for
that said Arthur I will see her / for I take no force whom I grieve / Sir said
lancelot ye put your self in great Ieopardy / As for that said the king we
will take the adventure / Right so anon the King rode even to her / and
salewed her / and said god you save / Sir said she ye are welcome / then the
king beheld her / and lyked her wonderly well / with that came sire palomydes
unto Arthur and said vncurtois knight what sekest thou here / thou art
vncurtois to come vp^n a lady thus suddenly / therefore withdraw the / Sir Arthur
took none head of sire palomydes words / but ever he looked stylle upon Queen
Isoud / Then was sir Palomydes wroth / and there with he took a spear / and
came hurtelynge upon King Arthur / and smote him down with a spear / when sire
lancelot saw that despyte of sir Palomydes he said to him self I am loath to
have adoo with yonder knight / and not for his own sake but for sir Tristram /
And one thing I am sure of / if I smite down sir palomydes I must have adoo
with sire Tristram / and that were over much for me to match them both / for
they are two noble knights / not withstanding whether I live or I dye needs
must I revenge my lord / and so will I what someuer befalle of me / And there
with sir lancelot cried to sir palomydes / keep the from me / And then sir
lancelot and sire Palmydes rasshed to gyder with two speres strongly / But
sire Lancelot smote sir palomydes so hard that he went quyte out of his
sadel and had a great fall / when sire Tristram saw sire palomydes have
that fall / he said to sire Lancelot / sir knight keep the / for I must Just
with the / As for to Just with me said sir lancelot I will not fail you /
for no dr^de I have of you / but I am loathe to have adoo with you and I might
chese / for I will that ye wete that I must revenge my special lord that was
unhorsed unwarily and vnknyghtely / And therefore though I reuengyd that fall /
take ye no displeasyr therein / for he is to me such a friend that I may not
see him shamed / anon sir Tristram understood by his parson and by his
knyghtely words that it was sir lancelot du lake / and verily sir Tristram
demed that it was king Arthur he that sir Palomydes had smyten down And
then sir Tristram put his spear from him / and put sire Palomydes again on
horsbak / and sir lancelot put king Arthur on horshak and so departed / So
god me help said sire Tristram unto Palomydes ye did not worshipfully when ye
smote down that knight so suddenly as ye did / And wete ye well ye did your
self great shame / for the knights came hyder of their gentilnesse to see a
fair lady / and that is every good knights part to behold a fair lady / and
ye had not adoo to play such maystryes before my lady / wete thou well hit
will turn to anger / for he that ye smote down was king Arthur / and that
other was the good knight sire lancelot / But I shall not forgete the words
of ^ire lancelot when that he called him a man of great worship / there by I
wist that it was king Arthur / And as for sire lancelot / and there had been
five honderd knights in the medowe / he would not have refused them / and yet
he said he would refuse me / By that again I wist that it was sir lancelot /
for ever he forbereth me in every place / and shows me great kyndnesse / and
of all knights I out take none say what men will say / he bears the
flower of al chyualry / say hit him who someuer will / and he be well angered /
and that him list to do his vtteraunce without any favor / I know him not on
live but sir lancelot is over hard for him / be hit on horsback or on foot /
I may never believe said Palomydes that king Arthur will ride so pryuely as a
pour erraunt knight / A said sir Tristram ye know not my lord Arthur / for
all knytes may learn to be a knight of him / And therefore ye may be sorry said
^ire Tristram of your unkindly deeds to so noble a king / And a thing that
is done may not be undone said Palomydes / Then sire Tristram sent queen
Isoud unto her lodging in the pryory there to behold all the turnement /

Then there was a cry unto all knights that when they herd an horn blow
they should make Iustes as they did the first day / And like as the brethren
sire Edward and sir Sadok began the Iustes the first day / sir Vwayne the
kings sone Vreyn and sir lucanere de buttelere began the Iustes the second
day / And at the first encountre sir Vwayne smote down the kings sone of
S^ottes / and sir Lucanere ran ageynste the king of walys / and they brake
their speres all to pyeces / and they were so fyers both / that they hurtled

sir Lucanere / And then came in sir Tristram de Lyones / and then sir
Tristram smote down sir Vwayne / and sire Lucanere and sire Palomydes smote
down other two Knights / and sire Gareth smote down other two Knights /
Then said sire arthu^ unto sir Lancelot / see yonder three knights do

Knight began not yet / but ye shall see him this day do merueyllously /
and then came in to the place the dukes sone of Orkeney / and then they
began to do many deeds of arms / When sire Tristram saw them so begin /
he said to Palomydes / how feel ye your self / may ye do this day as ye did
yesterday / Nay said Palomydes I feel my self so weary and so sore brysed of
the deeds of yesterday that I may not endure as I did yesterday / That me
repents said sire Tristram / for I shall lack you this day / Sire Palomydes
said trust not to me / for I may not do as I did / all these words said
Palomydes for to begyle sir Tristram / Sir said sir Tristram unto sir Gareth
then must I trust upon you wherefore I pray you be not far from me to
rescowe me / and need be said Gareth I shall not fail you in all that I may
do Then sir Palomydes rode by him self / and then in despyte of sir
Tristram he put him self in the thyckest prees among them of Dorkeney / and
there he did so merueyllous deeds of arms that all men had wonder of him /
for there might none s^ande him a st^oke / when sire Tristram saw sire
Palomydes do such deeds / he merueylled and said to him self / he is weary of
my company / So sir Tristram beheld him a great while and did but little else /
for the noise and cry was so huge / and great / that sire Tristram merueylled
/ from w^ens came the strength that sire Palomydes had there in the field /
Sir said sire Gareth unto sir Tristram / remember ye not of the words that sir
Dynadan said to you yesterday when he called you coward / for sothe sir he said
it for none if for ye are the man in the world that he most loves / and all
that he said was for your worship / And therefore said sir Gareth to sir
Tristram let me know this day what ye be / and wondre ye not so upon sire
Palomydes / for he enforces him self to win all the worship and honor from
you / I may well believe it said sir Tristram / And sythen I understand his
evil will and his envy / ye shall see / if that I enforce my self / that the
noise shall be left that now is upon him /

Then sire Tristram rode in to the thyckest of the prees / and then he did
so merueyllously well / and did so great deeds of arms that all men said
that sire Tristram did double so much deeds of arms as sire Palomydes had
done before hand / And then the noise went plain from sire Palomydes / and
all the people cried upon sir Tristram / O Ihesu said the people see how sire
Tristram smyteth down with his spear so many knights / And see said they
all how many knights he smyteth down with his suerd / and of how many
knights he rasshed of their helmes and their sheldes / and so he beat them al
of Orkeney before him / How now said sir lancelot unto king Arthur / I told
you that this day there would a knyt play his pagent / yonder rydeth a knyt ye
may see he does knyghtely / for he has strength and wind So god me help said
Arthur to Lancelot ye say sothe / for I saw never a better knight / for he
passes fer sire Palomydes / Sire wete ye well said lancelot hit must be so
of right / for hit is him self that noble knight sir Tristram / I may right
well believe it said Arthur / But when sire Palomydes herd the noise and the cry
was turned from him / he rode out on a part / and beheld sir Tristram / And
when sire Palomydes saw sir Tristram do so merueyllously well / he wept
passyngly sore for despyte / for he wiste well / he should no worship win that
day / for well knew sire Palomydes when sire Tristram would put forth his
strength and his manhood he should get but lytyl worship that day

Then came king Arthur and the king of Northgaly^ / and sir Lancelot du
lake and sire Bleoberis sire Bors de ganys / sir Ector de maris / these three
knights came in to the feld with sire lancelot / And then sire Lancelot
with the three knights of his kynne did so great deeds of arms that all the
noise began upon sir lancelot / And so they beat the king of walys and the
king of scotts far abak / and made them to avoid the field / but sir
Tristram and sir Gareth abode stylle in the field and endured all that ever
there came / that all men had wonder that any knight might endure so many
strokes / But ever sir lancelot and his three kynnesmen by the cammau^dement of
sir lancelot forbear sir Tristram / Then said sir Arthur is that sir
Palomydes that endures so well / nay said sir lancelot / wete ye well it is
the good knight sir Tristram / for yonder ye may see sir Palomydes beholds
and houeth and does little or naught / And sire ye shall understand that sire
Tristram weneth this day to beat us all out of the field / And as for me said
sire lancelot I shall not beat him / beat him who so will / Sir said Lancelot
unto Arthur ye may see how sir Palomydes houeth yonder / as though he were in a
dreme / wete ye well he is full heavy that Tristram does such deeds of arms /
Then is he but a fool said Arthur / for never was sire Palomydes / nor never
shall be of such prowess as sir Tristram / And if he have any envy at sir
Tristram and comes in with him upon his side he is a falls knight / As the
king and sir Lancelot thus spoke / sir Tristram rode pryuely out of the
prees / that none aspyed him / but la Beale Isoud and sir Palomydes / for they
two would not let of their eyes upon sir Tristram / And when sir Tristram came
to his pauelions he fond sire Dynadan in his bed a sleep / Awake said
Tristram / ye out to be ashamed so to sleep when knights have ado in the feld
Then sir Dynadan arose lyghtely and said sir what will ye that I shall do
/ make you ready said sir Tristram to ride with me in to the field / So when
sir Dynadan was armed be looked upon sire Tristrams helm and on his shield /
and when he saw so many strokes upon his helm and upon his shield / he said
in good time was I thus a sleep / For had I ben with you / I must needs for
shame there have followed you / more for shame than any prowess / that is in me
/ that I see well now by tho strokes that I should have been truly beten as I was
yesterdaye / Leave your Iapes said sire Tristram / and come of that we were in
the field again / what said sire Dynadan is your heart up / yester day ye
ferd as though ye had dremed / So then sir Tristram was arrayed in black
harneis / O Ihesu said Dynadan what eyleth you this day / me seems ye be
wylder than ye were yesterday / Then smyled sir Tristram and said to Dynadan
awayte well upon me / if ye see me ouermatched / look that ye be ever behind me
/ and I shall make you ready way by gods grace / So sir Tristram and sire
Dynadan took their horses / All this aspyed sir palomydes / both their going
and their coming / and so did la Beale Isoud / for she knew sir Tristram
above all other

Capitulum lxxvj
Then when sire Palomydes saw that sir Tristram was desguysed / then he
thought to do him a shame / So sire Palomydes rode to a knight that was
sore wounded that satte under a fair well from the field / Sir knight said
sire Palomydes I pray you to lene me your armor / and your shield / for mine is
over well known in this field / and that has done me great dommage / and ye
shall have mine armor and my shield that is as sure as yours / I will well said
the knight that ye have mine armor and my shield / if they may do you any
avail / So sire Palomydes armed him hastily in that Knights armoure and his
sheld that shone as any crystal or silver / and so he came riding in to the
field / And then there was neither sire Tristram nor none of king Arthurs
party that knew sir Palomydes / And right so as sir Palomydes was come in to
the feld sir Tristram smote down three Knights even in the sight of sir
Palomydes / And then sir Palomydes rode against sire Tristram / and either
met other with great speres / that they braste to their hands / And then
they dasshed to gyder with swerdes egerly / Then sire Tristram had merueylle
what knight he was that did bataill so knyghtely with him / Then was sir
Tristram wroth / for he felt him passing strong so that he demed he might
not have adoo with the remenaunt of the knytes by cause of the strength of
sire palomydes So they lasshed to gyder and gaf many sad strokes to gyders /
and many knights merueylled what knight he might be that so encountered with
the black knight sir tristram / full well knew la Beale Isoud that there was
sire palomydes that fought with sir Tristram / for she aspyed al in her wyndowe
where that she stood / as sir palomydes changed his harneis with the wounded
knight / And then she began to weep so hertely for the despyte of sir
palomydes that there she swouned / Then came in sir lau^celot with the
knights of Orkeney / And when the other party had aspyed sir Lancelot /
they cried / return / return / here comes sire lancelot du lake / So there
came knights and said sir lancelot ye must needs fight with yonder knight in
the black harneis that was sir Tristram / for he has al most overcome that
good knight that fyghteth with him with the silver shield that was sir
palomydes / Then sir lancelot rode betwix sir Tristram and sir palomydes /
and sir lancelot said to palomydes / sir knight let me have the batail / for
ye have need to be reposed / Sir palomydes knew sir lancelot well / and so did
sire Tristram / but by cause sir Lancelot was far hardyer knight than him
self / therefore he was glad / and suffered sir lancelot to fight with sir
Tristram / For well wyste he that sire lancelot knew not sir Tristram / and
there he hope that sir lancelot should beat or shame sire Tristram / whereof
sire palomydes was full feign / and so sir lancelot gaf sir Tristram many
sad strokes / but sire lancelot knew not sir Tristram / but sir Tristram
knew well sire lancelot /

And thus they fought long to gyders that la Beale Isoud was well nygh out of
her mind for sorou / then sir Dynadan told sir Gareth how y^ knyt in the
black harne is was sir tristra^ and this is lau^celot y^ fyteth with him yt
must needs have the better of him / for sir Tristram has had to much
trauaylle this day / Then let us smite him down said sire Gareth / so it is
better that we do said sire Dynadan then sir Tristram be shamed / for yonder
houeth the strong knight with the silver shield to fall upon sire Tristram
if need be / Then forth with all Gareth rasshed upon sire lancelot / and
gaf him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was astonyed And then
came sir Dynadan with a spear / and he smote sir lancelot such a buffet that
horse and all fell to the earth O Ihesu said sir Tristram to sire Gareth and
sire Dynadan fie for shame why did ye smite down so good a knight as he is /
and namely when I had adoo with him / now ye do your self great shame / and
him no disworship / For I held him reasonable hot though ye had not helped me
/ Then came sire palomydes that was desguysed and smote down sir Dynadan from
his horse / Then sir lancelot by cause sir Dynadan had smyten him before hand
/ then sir lancelot assailed sire Dynadan passing sore / and sire Dynadan
defended him myghtely / But well understood sir Tristram that sire Dynadan
might not endure sir lancelot / wherefore sir Tristram was sorry / Then came
sire palomydes fresshe upon sire Tristram / And when sir Tristram saw him
come / he thought to deliver him at ones by cause that he would help sire
Dynadan by cause he stood in great peril with sir Lancelot Then sire
Tristram hurteled unto sire palomydes and gafe him a great buffet / and then
sir Tristram gate sir palomydes and pulled him down under nethe him / And so
fell sir Tristram with him / and sir Tristram lepte up lyghtely and left sir
palomydes and went betwixe sir lancelot and Dynadan / and then they began
to do bataille to gyders / Right so sire Dynadan gat sir Tristrams horse and
said on high that sir Lancelot might here it / my lord sir Tristra^ take
yours horse / And when sire Lancelot herd him neneme sir Tristram / O Ihesu
said lancelot what have I done I am dishonored / A my lord sire Tristram said
Lancelot / why were ye desguysed / ye have put your self in great perille this
day / But I pray you noble Knight to pardone me / for and I had known you
we had not done this bataille / Sir said sir Tristram this is not the first
kyndenes ye showed me / so they were both horsed again / Then all the
people on the one side gaf sir lau^celot the honor and the degree / and on the
other side all the people gaf to the noble knyt sir tristram the honor and the
degree / but lancelot said nay there to / for I am not worthy to have this
honor / for I will report me unto all knights that sir Tristram has been
longer in the field than I / and he has smyten down many moo knights this day
than I have done / And therefore I will give sire Tristram my voice and my name
/ and so I pray all my lords and felawes so to do / Then there was the
hole voice of dukes and Earls / Barons and knights / that sir Tristram this
day is preued the best knight

Capitulum lxxvij
Then they blewe unto lodging / and Queen Isoud was led unto her pauelions
/ but wete you well she was wroth out of mesure with sir Palomydes / for she
saw all his treason from the beginning to the ending / And all this while
neither sir Tristram neither sir Gareth nor Dynadan knew not of the treason of
sir Palomydes / but afterward ye shall here that there bef^lle the grettest
debate betwixe sire Tristram and sire Palomydes that might be / So when the
turnement was done / sir Tristram Gareth and Dynadan rode with la Beale Isoud
to these pauelions / And ever sire Palomydes rode with them in their company
desguysed as he was But when sir Tristram had aspyed him that he was the same
knight with the sheld of silver / that held him so hot that day / Sir
knight said sire Tristram wete you well here is none that has need of your
^elauship / and therefore I pray you depart from us / Sire Palomydes ansuerd
again as though he had not known sir Tristram / wete you well sir knight from
this felauship will I never depart / for one of the best knights of the
world commanded me to be in this company / and till he discharge me of my
seruyse I will not be discharged / by that sir Tristram knew that it was sir
palomydes A sir palomydes said the noble knight sire Tristram ar ye such a
knight ye have been named wrong / For ye have long ben called a gentil knyt /
And as this day ye have showed me great vngentilnes / For ye had al most
brought me unto my death / But as for you I suppose I should have done well
enough / but sir lancelot with you was over much / for I know no knight
living but sire lancelot is over good for him and he will do his vttermest
/ Allas said sir Palomydes ar ye my lord sir Tristram / ye sir and that ye
know well enough / by my knyghthode said Palomydes until now I knew you not I
wend that ye had been the King of Irland / for well I wot ye bare his arms /
His arms I have said sire Tristram / and that will I stand by / For I wanne
them ones in a f^lde of a full noble knight / his name was sir Marhaus and with
great pain I wanne that knight / for there was none other recover but sir
Marhaus dyed thorugh falls leches / and yet was he never yolden to me / Sir said
Palomydes I wend ye had been turned upon sir Launcelots party / and that caused
me to torn / ye say well said sir Tristram / and so I take you and I forgive
you / So then they rode in to their pauelions / and when they were alyt they
unarmed them and wesshe their faces and hands / and so yode unto mete and
were set at their table / But when Isoud saw sir Palomydes she changed
then her colors and for wrath she might not speak / Anon sir Tristram a
spyed her countenance and said Madame / for what cause make ye us such chere
/ we have been sore travailed this day / Mine own lord said la Beale Isoud for
gods sake be ye not dyspleasyd with me / for I may none other wise do / for
I saw this day how ye were bitrayed and nyghe brought to your death / Truly
sire I saw every dele how and in what wise and therefore sir how should I suffer
in your presence such a felon and traitor as sir Palomydes / For I saw him
with mine eyes / how he beheld you when ye went out of the field / for ever he
houed stylle upon his horse til he saw you come in ageynward / And then forth
with all I saw him ride to the hurt knight and changed harn^is with him /
And then streyghte I saw him how he rode in to the field /

And anon as he had found you / he encountered with you / and thus wilfully
sir Palomydes did bataille with you / and as for him sir I was not gretely
aferd but I dred sore lau^celot that knew you not / Madame said Palomydes ye
may say what so ye will / I may not contrary you but by my knyghthode I knew

but well I wot ye spared me but little / but all is pardonned on my party /
Then la beale Isoud held down her heed and said no more at that time /

ANd there with all two knights armed came unto the pauelione / and there they

at our mete / if ye would any thing when we were in the field / there might
ye have easyd your hertes / Not so said the one of tho knights we come not for

And I am come here said the one for to see you and this knight is come for to

that I may see you / that will we do at your desire said the knights ^ /
And when their helmes were of / sir Tristram thought that he should know them

Lancelot du lake that spak unto you first / and the other is my lord King
Arthur / Then said sir Tristram unto la Beale Isoud Madame arise for here is

Sir god thank you said the noble knyt sire Tristram and Isoud / of your great

all the hole Iustes / But for what cause said king Arthur were ye sir
Tristram against us / ye are a knight of the table round / of right ye should
have been with us / Sire said sir Tristram here is Dynadan and sire Gareth your
own neuewe caused me to be against you / My lord Arthur said Gareth I may well
bear the blame but it were sir Tristrams own deeds / That may I repent said
Dynadan / for this unhappy sire Tristram brought us to this turnement / and
many great buffets he caused us to have Then the king and lancelot lough
that they might not sytte / what knight was that said Arthur that held you so

and turned to sir Tristram and all the people cried O Tristram O Tristram / And
then was sir Palomydes clean forgeten / How now said Lancelot unto Arthur /
yonder rydeth a knight that plays his pagents / So god me help said Arthur to

day wonders / Sir said Lancelot the one knight wayteth upon the other / and
enforces him self through envy to pass the noble knight sire Tristram / and he
knows not of the pryuy envy / the which sire Palomydes has to him / For all
that the noble sire Tristram does is thorou clean knygthode / And then sire
Gareth and Dynadan did wonderly great deeds of arms as two noble knights so
that King Arthur spak of them great honor and worship / and the kings and
knights of sir Tristrams side did passyngly well / and held them truly to
gyders / Then sir Arthur and sir Launceloot took their horses and dressid
them and get in to the thyckest of the prees / And there sir Tristram
unknowing smote down king Arthur / and then sire lancelot would have

and did of his armor and wayled and wept like as he had been a wood man /
Then many Knights gaf the price to sire Tristram / and there were many that

of the honor ye would give me / but I pray you hertely that ye would give your
voys to sir lancelot / for by my feythe said sire Trystram / I will give sir
lancelot my voys / but sire lancelot would not have hit / and so the price was

any man could think for he was not all only so dolorous for the departing

mysfortuned me of my sickness while that turnement endured / And as I suppose
/ I shall never see in all my life such an assemble of knights and ladies as

the first day with great noblesse / And the second day sir Trystram wanne the
degree / and the thyrdde day sire lancelot wanne the degree / well said queen
Gueneuer who did best all these three days / So god me help said these
knights sir lancelot and sire Tristram hadd^ leest dishonor / And wete ye
well sir palomydes did passing well and myghtely / but he turned against the
party that he came in with all / and that caused him to lose a great part of

then in a forest by a well sir Palomydes saw where lay a fair wounded
knight and his horse bounden by him / and that knight made the grettest do^e
that ever he herd man make / for ever he wept and there with he syghed as
though he would dye / Then sire Palomydes rode nere him and salewed him myldly
and said / fair knight why wayle ye so / let me lie down and wayle with you
/ for doubt not I am much more heuyer than ye are / for I dare say said
Palomydes that my sorrow is an honderd fold more than yours is and therefore let
us complain either to other / First said the wounded knight I require you
tell me your name / for and thou be none of the noble knights of the round
tabble / thou shall never know my name / what someuer come of me / Fair
knight said Palomydes such as I am be it better or be hit w^rse wete thou well
that my name is sire Palomydes sone and heir unto king Astlabor / and sir
Safyr and sir Segwarydes are my two brethren / and wete thou well as for my
self I was never crystened / but my two brethren ar truly crystend O noble
knight said that knight / well is me that I have met with you / and wete ye
well my name is Epynogrys the kings sone of Northumberland / Now sytte down
said Epynogrys / and let us either complain to other / Then sire Palomydes
began his complaynte / Now shall I tell you said Palomydes what woe I endure
I love the fairest Queen and lady that ever bare life / and wete ye well her name
is la Beale Isoud king Marks wife of Cornewaile / That is great folly said
Epynogrys for to love Queen Isoud For one of the best knights of the world
loves her / that is sir Tristram de lyones / that is truth said Palomydes /
for no man knows that matter better than I do / for I have been in sir
Tristrams felauship this month and with la beale Isoud to gyders / and allas
said Palomydes unhappy man that I am now have I lost the felauship of sire
Tristram for ever and the love of la beale Isoud for ever / and I am never like
to see her more / and sir Tristram and I ben either to other mortal enemies well
said Epynogrys / sithe that ye loved la Beale Isoud / loved she you ever again
by any thing that ye could thynk^ or wit / or else did ye rejoice her ever in
any pleasyr / Nay by my knyghthode said Palomydes I never aspyed that ever she
loved me more than all the world / nor never had I plesyr with her / But the
last day she gaf me the grettest rebuke that ever I had / the which shall
never goo from my heart / and yet I well deserved that rebuke / for I did not
knyghtely / and therefore I have lost the love of her and of sir Tristram for
ever / and I have many times enforced my self to do many deeds for la beale
Isoud sake / and she was the causer of my worship wynny^ge / Allas said sir
Palomydes now have I lost all the worship that ever I wanne / for never shall
me befalle such prowess as I had in the felauship of sir Tristram

Capitulum lxviij
NAy nay said Epynogrys your sorrow is but Iapes to my sorrow / for I
rejoiced my lady and wanne her with my hands / and lost her ageyn allas that
day / Thus first I wanne her said Epynogrys My lady was an Earls daughter And
as the Earl and two knytes came from the turnement of Lonezep / for her sake I
set upon this earl and on his two knights my lady there being present / and
so by fortune there I slew the earl and one of the knights and the other
knight fled / and so that night I had my lady / And on the morn as she
and I reposed us at this well side / there came there to me an erraunt
knight his name was sir Helyor le preuse an hardy knight / and this sir^
Helyor chalengyd me to fight for my lady / And then we went to bataille
first upon horse and after on foot / But at the last sir Helyor wounded me so
that he left me for deed / and so he took my lady with him / And thus my
sorrow is more than yours / for I have reioy^ed and ye reioy^ed never That is
truth said Palomydes / but sithe I can never recover my self I shall promise
you if I can mete with sir Helynor I shall get you your lady again or else he
shall beat me / Then sire Palomydes made sir Epynogrys to take his horse and
so they rode to an hermytage / and there sir Epynogrys rested him / And in the
mean while sire Palomydes walkd pryuely out to rest him under the leaves /
and there beside he saw a knight come riding with a sheld that he had seen
sir Ector de marys bear before hand / and there came after him a ten knights /
and so these x knights houed under the leaves for hete / And anon after there
came a knyt with a grene shield / and there in a white lion / ledynge a lady
upon a palfroy / Then this knyt with the grene sheld that seemed to be master
of the ten knights he rode fyersly after sire Helyor / For it was he that
hurt sir Epynogrys / And when he came nyghe sir Helyor / he badde him defend
his lady / I will defend her said Helyor unto my power / and so they ran to
gyders so myghtely that either of these knights smote other down horse and
all to the earth / and then they wanne up lyghtely and drew their swerdes
and their sheldes / and lasshed to gyders myghtely more than an hour / All
this sire Palomydes saw and beheld but ever at the last the knight with sir
Ectors shield was byggar / and at the last this knight smote sir Helyor
down / and then that knight unlaced his helm to have stryken of his head /
And then he cried mercy / and praid him to save his life and badde him take
his lady / Then sire Palomydes dressid him up by cause he wyste well that that
same lady was Epynogrys lady / and he promised him to help him / Then sir
Palomydes went streyghte to that lady and took her by the hand and asked her
whether she knew a knight that hyghte Epynogrys / Allas she said that ever he
knew me or I him / for I have for his sake lost my worship / and also his life
greueth me most of al Not so lady said Palomydes / come on with me / for here
is Epynogris in this hermytage / A well is me said the lady and he be on live /
whether wylt thou with that lady said the knight with sir Ectors shield / I
will do with her what me list said Palomydes / wete you well said that knight
thou spekest over large / though thou semest me to have at advantage / by cause
thou saw me do bataille but late / Thou wenest sir knight to have that
lady away from me so lightly / nay think hit never not / and thou were as good
a knight as is sir lancelot or as is sir Tristram or sir Palomydes / but thou
shall win her derer than ever did I / and so they went unto bataille upon
foot / and there they gaf many sad strokes / and either wounded other
passing sore / / and thus they fout stille more than an hour / Then sire
Palomydes had merueil what knight he might be that was so strong and so
well br^thed during / and thus said Palomydes / knyt I require the tell me thy
name / wete thou well said that knight I dar tell the my name / so that thou
wilt tell me thy name / I will said palomydes / Truly said that knight / my
name is Safyr sone of king As^labor and sire palomydes and sire Segwarydes are
my brethren / Now and wete thou well / my name is sir Palomydes / Then sir
Safyr kneled down upon his knees and prayed him of mercy / and then they
unlaced their helmes / and either kyssed other weeping / And in the mean while
sire Epynogrys aroose out of his bed / and herd them by the strokes / and
so he armed him to help sire Palomydes if need were

Capitulum lxxxiiij
Then sir Palomydes took the lady by the hand / and brought her to sire
Epynogrys / and there was great joy betwixe them / for either swouned for Joy
/ when they were met / Fair knight and lady said sir Safer / it were pity to
depart you / Ihesu send you Joy either of other / Gramercy gentyl knight
said Epynogrys / and much more thank be to my lord sir Palomydes / that thus
has through his prowess made me to get my lady / Then sir Epynogrys
required sire Palomydes and sire Safere his brother to ride with them unto his
castle for the sauf guard of his person / Sire said Palomydes we will be ready to
conduyte you by cause that ye are sore wounded / and so was Epynogrys and his
lady horsed / and his lady behind him upon a soft ambuler / And then they
rode unto his castle where they had great chere and Joy as great as ever sir
Palomydes and sir Safere had in their life days / So on the morn sir Safere
and sir palomydes departed and rode as fortune led them / and so they rode
all that day until after none / And at the last they herd a great weeping and
a great noise down in a manoir / Sire said then sir Safere let us wete what
noise this is / I will well said sir palomydes / and so they rode forth till that
they came to a fair gate of a manoir / and there satte an old man saying his
prayers and bedes / Then sire palomydes and sir Safere alyghte and left
their horses / and went within the gates / and there they saw full many
goodely men weeping / Fair syrs said palomydes wherefore weep ye / and make this
sorrow / Anon one of the knights of the castle beheld sir palomydes / and
knew him / and then went to his selawes and said Fair felawes wete ye well
al / we have in this Castle the same knight that slew our lord at Lonezep /
for I know him well it is sire palomydes / Then they went unto harneis all
that might bear harneis / some on horsbak / and some on foot to the nombre of
three score / And when they were ready / they came fresshly upon sir palomydes
and upon sir Safere with a great noise and said thus / keep the sire palomydes.
for thou art known / and by right thou must be deed for thou have slain our
lord / and therefore wete ye well / we will slay the / therefore defend the /
Then sir palomydes and sir Safer the one set his bak to the other / and gaf
many great strokes / and took many great strokes / and thus they foute with a
twenty knights and forty gentilmen / and yomen nyghe two hours / But at the
last though they were both sir palomydes and sir Safere were taken and yolden
and put in a strong prison / and within three days twelve knights passed
upon them / and they fond sir palomydes gylty / and sir Safyr not gylty of
their lords death / And when sir Safyr should be delyuerd there was great dole
betwixe sir palomydes and him / and many pyteous complayntys that sir Safyr
made at his departing / there is no maker can reherce the tenthe part / Fair
brother said palomydes let be thy dolor and thy sorou / And if I be ordained
to dye a shameful death welcome be it / but and I had wist of this death that I
am demed unto I should never have been yolden / So sir Safere departed from his
brother with the grettest dolor and sorou that ever made knight / And on the
morn they of the castle ordained twelve knights to ride with sire Palomydes
unto the fader of the same knight that sir Palomydes slew / and so they bound
his legs under an old s^edes belly / And then they rode with sir Palomydes
unto a Castle by the sea side that hyghte Pelownes / and there sir Palomydes
should have Justice / thus was their ordenaunce / and so they rode with sir
palomydes fast by the Castle of Joyous guard / And as they passed by that Castle
/ there came riding out of that castle by them one that knew sir palomydes /
And when that knight saw sire palomydes bounden upon a crooked courser / the
knight asked sire palomydes / for what cause he was led so / A my fair felawe
and knight said palomydes / I ride toward my death for the sleynge of a knight
at a turnement of Lonezep / and if I had not departed from my lord sir Tristra^
as I out not to have done / now myt I have been sure to have had my life saved /
But I pray you sir knight recommaunde me unto my lord sir Tristram and unto my
lady Queen Isoud / and say to them / if ever I trespaced to them / I ask them
foryeuenes / And also I biseche you recommaunde me unto my lord king Arthur
and to all the selauship of the round table unto my power / Then that
knight wept for pity of sir palomydes / and there with all he rode unto
Joyous guard as fast as his horse might run / ande lightly that knight
descended down of his horse and went unto sir Tristram / and there he told him
all as ye have herd / and ever the knight wept as he had been mad

Capitulum lxxxv
WHen sir Tristram herd how sir palomydes went to his death / he was heavy to
here that / and said how be it that I am wroth with sir palomydes / yet will not
I suffer him to dye so shameful a death for he is a full noble knyt / and then
anon sir Tristram was armed and took his horse and two squyers with him / and
rode a great paas toward the castle of pelownes where sir palomydes was Iuged
to death / and these twelve knyytes that led sir palomydes passed by a well
where as sir lau^celot was which was alyghte there and had teyed his horse to a
tree and taken of his helm to drink of that well / and when he saw these
knights / sir lancelot put on his helm / and suffered them to pass by him
/ And then was he ware of sire Palomydes bounden and led shamefully to his
death / O Ihesu said lancelot what mysauenture is befalle him that he is thus
led toward his death / Forsooth said lancelot it were shame to me / to suffer
this noble knight so to dye and I myte help him therefore I will help him
what someuer come of hit / or else I shall dye for sir Palomydes sake / And
then sir lancelot mounted upon his horse and gate his spear in his hand / and
rode after the twelve knights that led sir Palomydes / Fair knights said
sir Lancelot whyder led ye that knyt / it bysemeth him full ylle to ride
bounden / Thenye these twelve Knights suddenly turned their horses / and said
to sir lancelot / sir Knight we counceille the not to meddle with this knight
/ for he has deserved death / and unto death he is juged / that me repents
said lancelot that I may not borowe him with fayrenesse / for he is over good
a knight to dye such a shameful death / And therefore fair knights said sir
lancelot keep you as well as ye can / for I will rescowe that knight or dye for
it / Then they began to dress their speres / and sir lancelot smote the
formest down horse and man / and so he served three moo with one spear / and
then that spear brast / and there with all sir lancelot drew his swerd / and
then he smote on the right hand and on the lift hand / then within a while
he left none of tho twelve knights / but he had leyd them to the earth / and
the most party of hem were sore wounded / and then sir Lancelot took the
best horse that he fond and loused sire Palomydes / and set him upon that
horse / and so they returned again unto Joyous guard / and then was sir
Palomydes ware of sir Tristram how he came riding / And when sir Lancelot
saw him / he knew him well / but sir Tristram knew not him by cause sire
Lancelot had on his sholder a golden shield / So sir lancelot made him ready
to just with sir Tristram / that sire Tristram should not wene that he were
sire Lancelot / Then sir Palomydes cried on loud to sir Tristram O my lord
I require you just not with this knight / for this good knight has saved me
from my death / when sire Tristram herd him say so / he came a soft trottyng
paas toward them / And then sire Palomydes said / My lord sir Tristram much
am I beholdynge unto you of your great goodenes that would profer your noble
body to rescowe me undeserved / for I have gretely offended you / Not

Fair knight said sir Tristram unto sire Lancelot / of whens be ye / I am a

your name said sir Tristram / sire at this time I will not tell you / Then
sire lancelot said unto sir Tristram and to palomydes / now either of you ar
met to gyders / I will depart from you / Not so said sir Tristram I pray
you of knythode to ride with me unto my Castle / wete you well said sir
Lancelot I may not ride with you / for I have many deeds to do in other
places / that all this time I may not abide with you / A mercy Ihesu said sir
Tristram I require you / as ye be a true knight to the order of knyghthode /
play you with me this night / Then sire Tristram had a grant of sire
lancelot / how be it though he had not desired him / he would have ryden with
hem / outher soon have come after them for sir lancelot came for none other
cause in to that Country but for to see sir Tristram / And when they were
come with in joyous guard / they alyght / and their horses were led in to a
stable / and then they unarmed them / And when sire Lancelot was vnhelmed
/ sir Tristram and sir Palomydes knew him / Then sire Tristram took sir
lancelot in arms / and so did la B^ale Isoud / and Palomydes kneled down
upon his knees / and thanked sir Lancelot / when sir lancelot saw sir
Palomydes knele / he lyghtely took him up and said thus / wete thou well sir
Palomydes I and any knight in this land of worship ought of very right
socoure and rescowe so noble a knight as ye are proved and renoumed through
out all this reame endlonge and overthwart / And then was there joye among
them / and the oftyner that sire Palomydes saw la Beale Isoud / the heuyer he
waxed day by day Then sir lancelot within three or four days departed / and
with him rode sir Ector de marys / and Dynadan and sir Palomydes were there
left with sire Tristram a two months and more / But ever sire Palomydes
faded and morned that all men had merueylle wherefore he faded so aweye / So
vppn a day in the daunynge sire Palomydes went in to the foreste by him self
alone / and there he fond a well / and then he looked in to the well / and
in the water he saw his own vysage hou he was distourbled and defaded nothing
like that he was what may this mean said sire Palomydes / and thus he said to
him self / A Palomydes / Palamydes / why art thou dyffaded thou that was wont
to be called one of the fairest knytes of the world / I will no more led this
life / for I love that I may never get nor recover / And there with all he
leyd him down by the well / And then he began to make a ryme of la Beale
Isoud and him / And in the mean while sir Tristram was that same day ryden in
to the forest to chase the heart of greese / but sire Tristram would not ride on
hunting never more unarmed by cause of sir Breuse saunce pity / and so as sir
Tristram rode in to that forest up and down / he herd one sing merueyllously
loud / and that was sire Palomydes that lay by the well / And then sir
Tristram rode softely thither / for he demed / there was some knight excaunt
that was at the well

And when sire Tristram came nyghe him / he descended down from his horse and
teyed his horse fast till a tree / and then he came nere him on foot / and
anon he was ware where lay sire palomydes by the well and sange loud and
meryly / and ever the complayntes were of that noble Queen La Beale Isoud / the
which was merueyllously and wonderfully well said / and full dolefully and
pytously made And all the hole song the noble knight sire Tristram herd from
the beginning to the ending / the which grieved and troubled him sore But
then at the last when sir Tristram had herd all sir Palomydes complayntes
he was wroth out of mesure and thout for to slay him there as he lay Then
sir Tristram remembryd him self that sir Palomydes was unarmed and of the noble
name that sir Palomydes had and the noble name that him self had / and then
he made a restraynte of his anger / and so he went unto sire Palomydes a soft
paas and said sir Palomydes I have herd your complaynte and of thy treason
that thou have owed me so long And wete thou well therefore thou shall dye / And
if it were not for shame of knythode / thou sholdest not escape my hands / for
now I know well thou have awayted me with treason. Tell me said sire Tristram
how thou wolt acquyte the / Sir said Palomydes thus I will acquyte me / as for
Queen la beale Isoud ye shall wete well that I love her above all other ladies in
this world / and well I wot it shall befalle me as for her love as befelle to
the noble knight sire Kehydius that dyed for the love of la Beale Isoud / and
now sir Tristram I will that ye wete that I have loned la Beale Isoud many a day
/ and she has been the causer of my worship And else I had been the most
symplest knight in the world For by her / and by cause of her / I have won
the worship that I have / for when I remembryd me of la Beale Isoud I wanne the
worship where someuer I came for the most party / and yet had I never reward
nor bounte of her the days of my life / and yet have I ben her knight
gwerdonles / And therefore sir Tristram as for any death I dread not / for I had
as lyef dye as to live / And if I were armed as thou art / I should lyghtely
do batail with the / well have ye uttered your treason said Tristram / I have
done to you no treason said Palomydes / for love is free for all men / and
though I have loved your lady / she is my lady as well as yours / how be it I
have wrong if any wrong be / for ye rejoice her / and have your desire of her

Then said sir Tristram I will fight with you to the vttermest / I grant
said palomydes / for in a better quarrel keep I never to fight / for and I dye
of your hands / of a better knights hands may I not be slain / And sythen I
understand that I shall never rejoice la beale Isoud / I have as good will
to dye as to live / Then set ye a day said sir Tristram that we shall do
bataille / this day / xv / days said paid Palomydes will I mete with you here
by / in the medowe under Joyous guard / Fie for shame said sire Tristram; will
ye set so long day / let us fight to morn / Not so said palomydes / for
I am megre and have been long seek for the love of la Beale Isoud / and
therefore I will repose me till I have my strength again / So then sire
Tristram and sir palomydes promised feythfully to mete at the well that day xv
days / I am remembryd said sir Tristram to Palomydes / that ye brake me ones a
promise when that I rescowed you from Breuse saunce pity and ix knights / and
then ye promised me to mete me at the peron and the grave besides Camelot /
where as at that time ye failed of your promise / wete you well said Palomydes
unto sir Tristram I was at that day in prison so that I might not hold my
promise / So god me help said sir Tristram / and ye had holden your promise
this werk had not ben here now at this time / Right so departed sire Tristram
and sire Palomydes / And so sire palomydes took his horse and his harneis /
and he rode unto King Arthurs Court / and there sir palomydes gat him four
knights and four sergeaunts of arms / and so he retornod ageynward unto
Joyous guard / And in the mean while sir Tristram chaced and hunted at all
manner of venery / and about three days before the bataille should be / as sir
Tristram chaced an heart there was an Archer shot at the heart / and by
mysfortune he smote sir Tristram in the thyck of the thygh / and the arowe
slew sir Tristrams horse and hurt him / when sir Tristram was so hurt / he
was passing heavy / and wete ye well he bled sore / and then he took another
horse / and rode unto Joyous guard with great heaviness more for the promise that
he had made with sir palomydes as to do bataille with him within three days
after than for any hurt of his thy / wherefore there was neither man ne woman
that could chere him with any thing that they code make to him / neither Queen
la Beale Isoud / for ever he demed that sir lancelot had smyten him so / that
he should not be able to do bataille with him at the day set /

Capitulum lxxxviij
But in no wise there was no knight about sir Tristram that would believe that
ever sir Palomydes would hurt sir Tristram neither by his own hands nor by
none other consenting / then when the fyftenth day was come sir Palomydes
came to the well with four knytes with him of Arthurs court and three
sergeauntes of arms / And for this ententente sir palomydes brought the
knytes with him and the sergeaunt of arms / for they should bear record of the
bataille betwixe sire Tristram and sir Palomydes / And the one sergeaunt
brought in his helm / the other his spear / the third his swerd / So thus
Palomydes came in to the fold / and there he abode nyghe two hours / and
then he sent a squire unto sir Tristram / and desired him to come in to the
field / to hold his promise / when the squire was come to Joyous guard Anon as
sir Tristram herd of his coming he let command that the squire should come
to his presence there as he lay in his bed / My lord sir Tristram said
Palomydes squire wete you well my lord Palomydes abides you in the field / and
he would wete whether ye would do bataille or not / A my fair brother said sir
Tristram wete thou well that I am right heavy for these tidings / therefore tell
sire Palomydes / and I were well at ease I would not lie here nor he should have
no need to send for me / and I might outher ride or goo / and for thou shall
say that I am no liar / sire Tristram showed him his thye that the wound was
six Inches deep / and now thou have seen my hurt / tell thy lord that this
is no feigned matter and tell him that I had lever than all the gold of king
Arthur that I were hole / and tell palomydes as soon as I am hole I shall seek
him endlong and overthwart and yt I promise you as I am true knyt / and if ever
I may mete with him / he shall have batail of me his fylle / and with this the
squire departed / and when palomydes wist yt tristra^ was hurt he was glad and
said now I am sure I shall have no shame / for I wot well I should have had
hard handelynge of him / and by lykely I must needs have had the werse / For
he is the hardest knight in bataylle that now is living except sir Lancelot
/ And then departed sir Palomydes where as fortune ladde him / and within a
month sir Tristram was hole of his hurt / And then he took his horse / and
rode from countray to country / and all strange adventures he acheued where
someuer he rode / and alweyes he inquired for sire Palomydes / but of all that
quarter of summer sir Tristram could never mete with sir palomydes / But thus
as sir Tristram sought and inquired after sire Palomydes / sir Tristram
encheued many great batails where thorugh all the noise fell to sir Tristram
/ and it seaced of sir lancelot / and therefore sire launcelots brethren and
his kynnesmen would have slain sire Tristram by cause of his fame / But when
sire lancelot wyste how his kynnesmen were set / he said to them openly wete
you well that and the envy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord sire
Tristram with any hurt / shame / or vylony / as I am true knight / I shall
slay the best of you with mine own hands / Allas fie for shame should ye for
his noble deeds awayte upon him to slay him / Ihesu defend said lancelot that
ever any noble knight as sire Tristram is should be destroyed with treason / Of
this noise and fame sprange in to Cornewaile / and among them of Lyonas /
whereof they were passing glad / and made great Joy / And then they of
Lyonas sent letters unto sire Tristram of recommendacyon / and many great
yeftes to mayntene sir Tristrams estate / and ever bitwene sir Tristram
resorted unto Joyous guard where as la Beale Isoud was that loved him as her life

NOW leave we sir Tristram de lyones / and speak we of sire lancelot du lake

as the book of Frensshe reherceth Before the time that sire Galahalt was gotten
or borne / there came in an hermyte unto king Arthur upon whytsonday / as the
knights satte at the table round / And when the heremyte saw the syege
perilous / he asked the king and all the knights why that sege was void /
Sir Arthur and all the knights ansuerd / there shall never none sytte in that
syege / but one / but if he be destroyed / Then said the hermyte wot ye what
is he / nay said Arthur / and all the Knights / we wot not who is he / that
shall sytte therein / then wot I said the heremyte / for he that shall sytte
there is unborn and vngoten / and this same year he shall be gotten that
shall sytte there in that syege perilous / and he shall win the Sancgreal
when this hermyte had made this mensyon he departed from the court of king
Arthur / And then after this feeste sir lancelot rode on his adventure till
on a time by adventure he past over the pounte of Corbyn / and there he saw
the fairest toure that ever he saw / and there under was a fair Town full of
people and all the people men and wymmen cried at ones / welcome sir Lancelot
du lake the flower of all knyghthode for by the all we shall be helped out
of danger / what mean ye said sire Lancelot that ye cry so upon me / A fair
knight said they all here is within this Toure a dolorous lady that has been
therein pains many wynters and days / for ever she boyleth in scaldynge water
/ and but late said all the people sire Gawayne was here and he might not help
her / and so he left her in pain / So may I said sir Lancelot leave her in
pain as well as sire Gawayne did Nay said the people we know well that it is sir
Lau^celot that shall deliver her / well said lancelot / then show me what I
shall do / then they brought sire lancelot in to the toure And when he
came to the chamber there as this lady was the doors of iron unlocked and
vnbolted / And so sir lancelot went in to the chamber that was as hot as any
stewe / And there sir lancelot took the fairest lady by the hand / that ever
he saw / and she was naked as a nedel / and by enchaunteme^t Queen Morgan le

was called the fairest lady of that country / and there she had been five years
/ and never might she be delyuerd out of her great pains unto the time the
best knight of the world had taken her by the hand / Then the people brought
her clothes / And when she was arrayed / sire lancelot thought she was the
fairest lady of the word / but if it were Queen Gueneuer / then this lady
said to sire Lancelot / sire if hit please you will ye goo with me here by in
to a chapel that we may give loving and thanking unto god / Madame said sir
lancelot comes on with me I will goo with you / So when they came there
and gaf thankynges to god / all the people both learned and loud gaf
thankynges unto god and him / and said sir knight syn ye have delyuerd this
lady / ye shall deliver us from a serpent that is here in a tomb / Then sir
lancelot took his shield and said bring me thither / and what I may do unto
the pleasyr of god and you I will do / So when sir Lau^celot came thydder
/ he saw written upon the tomb letters of gold that said thus / Here shall
come a lybard of kings blood / and he shall s^^e this serpent / and this
lybard shall engendre a lion in this foreyn country the which lion shall
pass all other knights / So then sir lancelot lift up the tomb / and
there came out an horrible and a fyendly dragon spyttynge fire out of his
mouth / Then sir lancelot drew his swerd and fought with the dragon long
/ and at last with great pain sir lancelot slew that dragon / There with
all came king Pelles the good and noble knight / and salewed sir lancelot
and he him again / Fair knight said the king / what is your name / I require

Sir said lancelot wete you well my name is sire lancelot du lake / and my

so they went in to the Castle to take their repaste / and anon there came in
a down at a wyndowe / and in her mouth there seemed a little censer of gold /
And there with all there was such a savor as all the spyecery of the world
had been there / And forth with all there was upon the table al manner of metes
and drynkes that they could think upon / So came in a damoysel passing fair
and young / and she bare a vessel of gold betwixe her hands / and thereto the
king kneled deuoutely / and said his prayers / and so did all that were
there / O Ihesu said sir lancelot what may this mean / this is said the
king the rychest thing that any man has living And when this thing goth
about / the round table shall be broken / and wete thou well said the king
this is the holy Sancgreal that ye have here seen / So the king and sir
lau^celot ladde their life the most part of that day / And feign would king
Pelles have fond the mean to have had sire Lancelot to have layne by his
daughter fair Elayne / And for this intent the king knew well that sir
lancelot should get a child upon his daughter / the which should be named sir
Galahalt the good knight / by whom all the foreign country should be brought
out of danger / and by him the holy graale should be encheued / Then came
forth a lady that hyghte Dame Brysen / and she said unto the King / Sir wete
ye well / sire Lancelot loves no lady in the world but all only Queen Gueneuer
/ and therefore wyrche ye by counceylle and I shall make him to lie with your
daughter / and he shall not wete but that he lies with Queen Gueneuer / O
fair lady dame Brysen said the king / hope ye to bring this about sir said
she upon pain of my life let me dele / for this Brysen was one of the grettest
enchauntresses that was at that time in the world living /

Then anon by dame Brysens wit she maade one to come to sir lancelot that
he knew well / And this man brout him a ring from Queen Gueneuer like as hit

sir lancelot against night rode unto that castle / and there anon he was
received worshipfully with such people to his semyng as were about Queen
Queneuer secret So when sir Lancelot was alyghte / he asked where the
Queen was / So dame Brysen said she was in her bed / and then the people
were avoided / and sir lancelot was led unto his chamber / And then dame
Brysen brought sir lancelot a cup full of wine / and anon as he had dronken
that wyn / he was so assoted and mad that he might make no delay / but
withouten any let he went to bed / and he wend that maiden Elayne had been
Queen Gueneuer / wete you well that sir lancelot was glad and so was that lady
Elayne / that she had geten sir lancelot in her arms / For well she knew
that same night should be gotten upon her Galahalt that should preue the best
knight of the world / and so they lay to gyders until vndorne on the morn /
and all the wyndowes and holes of that chamber were stopped that no man ere of

ANd anon as he had vnshet the wyndowe the enchau^tement was gone / then he

traitresse what art thou that I have layn by all this night / thou shall dye

lancelot I may not wit this to you / but her that made this enchauntement
upon me as between you and me / and I may find her that same lady Brysens
shehalle lose her head for wytchecraftes / for there was never knight deceived
so as I am this night / And so sire Lancelot arrayed him / and armed him /
and took his leave myldely at that lady young Elayne / and so he departed /
Then she said my lord sir lancelot I biseche you see me as soon as ye may /
for I have obeyed me unto the prophecy that my fader teld me / And by his
commandment to fulfille this prophecy I have given the grettest richesse and
the fairest flower that ever I had / and that is my maydenhode that I shall

was well kept and well nourisshed / and he was named Galahalt by cause sir
Lancelot was so named at the fontayne stone / And after that the lady of the

So sire Bors made him to swear at whytsonday next coming to be at court of

Capitulum Sextum
NOw said that old man to sire Bors / goo ye to your cosyn sir Lancelot / and
tell him of this adventure the which had been most conuenyent for him of al
erthely knytes / but sin is so foul in him / he may not encheue such holy
deeds / for had not ben his sin he bad past all the knytes that ever were in
his days / and tell thou sir lancelot of all worldly adventures he passes
in manhood and prowess al other But in this spyrytuel matters he shall have
many his better / And then sir Bors saw four gentylwymen come by him pou^ely

lyte as it were a somer light / and the wymen kneled down before an altar of
silver with four pyllowes and as hit had been a bishop kneled down before that

rebukes to sir lancelot / and called him falls knight / and then sire
lau^celot told the queen all / and how he was made to lie by her by
enchau^tement in lykenes of the Queen / So the queen held sir lau^celot
excused / And as the book says king Arthur had been in France / and had made
war upon the mighty king Claudas / and had won much of his lands / And
when the king was come again / he let cry a great feast that al lords and
ladies of al England should be there / but if it were such as were rebellions
against him

ANd when dame Elayne the daughter of king Pelles herd of this feeste / she
went to her fader and required him that he would give her leave to ride to that
feast / The king ansuerd I will well ye go thither / but in any wise as ye love
me / and wile have my blessyng that ye be well bisene in the rychest wise / and
look that ye spare not for no cost / ask and ye shall have all that you
needs / Then by the advise of dame Brysen her maiden all thing was
apparaylled unto the purpose that there was never no lady more rychelyer bysene
/ So she rode with xx knytes and x ladies and ge^tilwymen to y^ nombre of an
honderd horses / And when she came to Camelot / king Arthur and queen
Gueneuer said and all the knights / that dame Elayne was the fairest and the
best bysene lady that ever was seen in that Court

And anon as king Arthur wyste that she was come / he met her / and salewed
her / and so did the most party of all the knights of the round table / both
sir Tristram / sir Bleoberys and sir Gawayne and many moo that I will not
reherce / But when sire Lancelot saw her he was so ashamed / and that by
cause he drew his swerd on the morn when he had layne by her / that he would
not salewe her nor speak to her / and yet sire Lancelot thought she was the
fairest woman that ever he saw in his life days / But when dame Elayn saw
sire Lancelot that would not speak unto her / she was so heavy that she wend her
heart would have to brast / For wete you well out of mesure she loved him / And
then Elayne said unto her woman dame Brysen the unkindness of sir Lancelot
sleeth me nere / A pees madame said dame Brysen I will undertake that this
night he shall lie with you / and ye would hold you stylle / that were me
lever said dame Elayne than all the gold that is above the earth / Let me
dele said dame Brysen / So when Elayne was brought unto queen Gueneuer
either made other good chere by countenance but nothing with hertes / But
all men and wymmen spoke of the beauty of dame Elayne and of her great
Rychesses / then at night the queen commanded that dame Elayne should sleep
in a chamber / nyghe her chamber and all under one roof / and so it was done
as the queen commanded Then the queen sent for sire Lancelot and badde him
come to her chamber that night / or else I am sure said the Queen / that ye

said sir Lancelot never say ye so For that I did was ageynste my will /
then said the queen look that ye come to me when I send for you / Madame said
lancelot I shall not fail you but I shall be ready at your commmandeme^t /
this bargayn was soon done and made bitwene them / but dame Bryson knew it by
her crafts / and told hit to her lady dame Elayne / Allas said she how shall I

by the finger and led him to her ladies bed dame Elayne / And then she
departed and left them in bed to gyders / wete you well the lady was glad
and so was sir lancelot / for he wend that he had had another in his arms /
Now leave we them kissing and clyppynge as was kyndely thing / and now speak we

to the Queen and told her all / Allas said the Queen where is that falls
knight become / Then the queen was nyghe out of her wit / and then she
wrythed and weltred as a mad woman / and might not sleep a four or five hours
/ Then sire lancelot had a condycion that he used of customme he would
clater in his sleep / and speak often of his lady Queen Gueneuer / So as sir
lancelot had waked as long as hit had pleasyd him / then by course of kind
he slepte / and dame Elayne both / And in his sleep he talked and clatered as
a Iay of the love that had been betwixe Queen Gweneuer and him / And so as he
talked so loud the Queen herd him there as she lay in her chamber / and
when she herd him so clater she was nyghe wood and out of her mind / and

sire lancelot awaked and he knew her hemynge / And then he knew well that

said / falls traitor knyt that thou art / look thou never abide in my Court
and avoid my chamber / and not so hardy thou falls traitor knyt that thou
art that ever thou come in my syghte / Allas said sir lancelot / and there

Gueneuer Madame ye are gretely to blame for sir lancelot / for now have ye
lost him / for I saw and herd by his countenance that he is mad for ever /
Allas madame ye do great sin / and to your self great dishonor / for ye
have a lord of your own / and therefore it is your part to love him / for
there is no queen in this world / has such an other king as ye have / And if
ye were not I might have the love of my lord sir Lancelot / and cause I have
to love him / for he had my maydenhode / and by him I have borne a fair sone /
and his name is Galahalt / and he shall be in his time the best knight of the
world /

Dame Elayne said the Queen when hit is day light I charge you and command
you to avoid my Court And for the love ye owe unto sire lancelot discover
not his counceylle / for and ye do / it will be his death / As for that said
dame Elayne I dar undertake he is marred for ever / and that have ye made / for

he lepte out at yonder bay wyndowe that ever I herd man make / Allas said
fair Elayne / and allas said the Queen Gueneuer / for now I wot well / we have
lost him for ever / So on the morn dame Elayne took her leave to depart and
she would no longer abide / Then king Arthur brought her on her way with mo

Allas said sire Bors betwixe you both ye have destroyed that good knight /
As for me said dame Elayne I said never nor did never thing that should in any
wise displease him / but with the rebuke that Queen Gueneuer gaf him I saw him
swoune to the earth / And when he awoke he took his swerd in his hand naked
sauf his sherte / and lepte out at a wyndowe with the grysylyest groan that
ever I herd man make Now fare well dame Elayne said sire Bors / and hold my
lord Arthur with a tale as long as ye can / for I will torn again to Queen
Gueneuer / and give her a hete / and I require you as ever ye will have my

Truly said fair Elayne I shall do all that I may do for as feign would I
know and wete where he is become as you or any of his kynne / or Queen
Gueneuer / and cause great enough have I thereto as well as any other / And wete

torn we to sire Lancelot / and speak we of his care and woo / and what pain
he there endured / for cold / honger and thirst he had plente / And thus as
these noble knights rode to gyders / they by one assente departed / and then
they rode by two / by three / and by four / and by five / and ever they
assigned where they should mete / And so sir Aglouale and sir Percyuale rode to
gyders unto their mother that was a queen in tho days / And when she saw her
two sons / for Joy she wept tendyrly / And then she said / A my dear sons
/ when your fader was slain / he l^fte me iiij sons / of the which now be
tweyn slain / And for the death of my noble sone sire Lamorak shall my heart
never be glad / And then she kneled down upon her knees to fore Aglouale
and sir Percyuale / and besoughte them to abide at home with her / A sweet
mother said sir Percyuale we may not / For we be come of kings blood of both
parties / and therefore mother it is our kind to haunte arms and noble deeds /
Allas my sweet sons then she said* for your sakes I shall lose my liking
and lust / and then wind and weder I may^ not endure / what for the death of
your fader king Pellenore that was shamefully slain by the hands of sir
Gawayne / and his brother sire Gaherys / and they slew him not manly but by
treason / A my dear sons this is a pyteous complaynte for me of your faders
death / considering also the death of sire Lamorak that of knythode had but
few felawee / Now my dear sons have this in your mind / Then there was but
weeping and sobbing in the Court when they should depart / and she fell in
swounynge in mids of the Court /

ANd when she was awaked / she sent a squire after them with spending

to ride with hem / but sent him home again to comfort their mother / prayenge
her mekely of her blessing / And so this squire was benyghted / and by
mysfortune he happend to come to a castle where dwellid a Baroune / And so
when the squire was come in to the castle / the lord asked him / from whens
he came / and whom he served / my lord said the squire I serve a good knight
that is called sire Aglouale / the squire said it to good entente / wenynge
unto him to have been more forborne for sir Aglouals sake / ^han he had said he
had served the queen Aglouals mother / well my felawe said the lord of that
Castle / for sire Aglouals sake thou shall have evil lodging / for sir
Aglouale slew my b^odr / and therefore thou shall dye on party of payement / And
then that lord commanded his men to have him aweye and slay him / and so
they did / and so pulled him out of the castle / and there they slew bym
without mercy / Right so on the morn came sire Aglouale and sire Percyuale
riding by a church yerd where men and wymmen were besy / and beheld the deed
squire / and they thought to berye him / what is there said sir Aglouale /
that ye behold so fast / A good man starte forth / and said / fair knight
here lies a squire slain shamefully this night / How was he slain fair
felawe said sir Aglouale / my fair sir said the man / the lord of this castle
lodged this squire this night / and by cause he said he was servant unto a
good knight that is with king Arthur / his name is sir Aglouale / therefore the
lord commanded to slay him / and for this cause is he slain / Gramercy said
sir Aglouale / and ye shall see his death revenged lyghtely / for I am that
same knight for whom this squire was slain / Then sir Aglouale called unto
him sir Percyuale / and badde him alyghte lyghtely / and so they alyghte both
/ and betoke their horses to their men / and so they yede on foot in to the
Castle / And also soon as they were within the castle gate / sire Aglouale
badde the porter goo thou unto thy lord and tell him / that I am sir Aglouale
for whom this squire was slain this nyt Anon the porter told this to his
lord whose name was Good wyn / anon he armed him / and then he came in to the

thou shall dye / I defye the said sir Goodewyn / then they lasshed to gyders
as egerly as hit had been two lions / and sir Percyuale he fought with all the
remenaunt that would fight / And within a while sir Percyuale had slain all
that would withstand him / For sir percyuale dealt so his strokes that were so
rude that there durst no man abide him / And within a while sir Aglouale had
sir Goodewyn at the earth / and there he unlaced his helm / and struck of his

ANd when this was done / they rode in to many countries ever enquyryng
after sir Lancelot / but never they could here of him / and at the last they
came to a Castle that hyghte Cardycan / and there sire Percyuale and sire
aglouale were lodged to gyders / and pryuely about mydnyt sir Percyuale came
to aglouals squire / and said arise and make the ready / for ye and I will ride
awey secretly / Sir said the squire I would full feign ride with you where ye
would have me / but and my lord your brother take me / he will slay me / as for
that care thou not / for I shall be thy waraunt / and so sir Percyual rode
till it was after none / and then he came upon a bridge of stone / and there
he fond a knight that was bounden with a chain fast about the wast unto a
pyller of stone / O fair knight said that bounden Knight / I require the
lose me of my bounds / what knight are ye said sir Percyuale / and for what
cause are ye so bounden / Sire I shall tell you said that knight I am a
knyte of the table round / and my name is sire Persydes / and thus by aduentur
I came this way / and here I lodged in this castle at bridge foot / and
therein duelleth an vncurtois lady / and by cause she proffered me to be her
peramour / and I refused her / she set her men upon me suddenly or ever I
might come to my wepen and thus they bond me / and here I wot well I shall dye
but if sum man of worship break my bands / Be ye of good chere said sir
Percyuale / and by cause ye are a knight of the round table as well as I / I
trust to god to break your bands / and there with sir Percyuale pulled out
his swerd and struck at the chain with such a might that he cut a two the
chain / and thoru sir Percydes hauberk and hurt him a little / O Ihesu said
sir Persides that was a mighty stroke as ever I felt one / for had not the
chain be / ye had slain me / and there with all sire Persydes saw a knight
coming out of a Castle all that ever he might flynge / Beware sir said sire
Percydes yonder comes a man that will have adoo with you Let him come said
sire Percyuale / and so he met with that knight in mids of the bridge /
and sire percyuale gaf him such a buffet that he smote him quyte from his horse
/ and over a part of the bridge that had not ben a lytil vessel under the
bridge / that knight had been drouned / and then sire percyual took the
knights horse and made sire percydes to mount up him / and so they rode unto
the castle / and bad the lady deliver sire Persydes servant / or else he would
slay all that ever he fond / and so for fere she delyuerd them all / Then
was sire Percyuale ware of a lady that stood in that toure / A madame said sire
Percyuale what use and customme is that in a lady to destroy good knights /
but if they will be your peramour / for sothe this is a shameful customme of a
lady / And if I had not a great matter in my hand / I should fordoo your euylle
custommes / and so sir Percydes broute sir percyuale unto his own castle /
and there he made him great chere all that night / And on the morn when
sir percyuale had herd mass / and broken his fast / he badde sir persydes ride
unto king Arthur / and tell the king how that ye met with me / and tell
my brother sire Aglouale how I rescowed you / and bydde him seek not after me /
for I am in the quest to seek sir lancelot du lake / And though he seek me he
shall not find me / and tell him I will never see him nor the court till I
have fond sire Lancelot / Also tell sir kay the Seneschal and to sir Mordred
that I trust to Ihesu to be of as great worthynes as either of them / for
tell them I shall never forgete their mockes and scorns that they did to me
that day that I was made knight / And tell them I will never see that Court
till men speak more worship of me than ever men did of any of them both / And
so sire percydes departed from sir percyuale / and then he rode unto king
Arthur / and told there of sire percyuale / And when sire Aglouale herd him
speak of his brother sir percyuale / he said / he departed from me unkindly /

Capitulum xiij
Sir said sire percydes on my life he shall pr^ue a noble knight as any now is
living / And when he saw sire kay and sir Mordred / sir percydes said thus
/ My fair lords both sir percyuale greteth you well both / and he sent you
word by me that he trusts to god or ever he come to the court again to be
of as great noblesse as ever were ye both and mo men to speak of his noblesse
than ever they did you / hit may well be said sir kay and sire Mordred / but at
that time when he was made knight / he was full vnly^e to preue a good knight
/ As for that said king Arthur / he must needs preue a good knight / for his
fader and his brethren were noble knights / And now will we turn unto sir
Percyuale that rode long / and in a forest he met a knight with a broken
shield and a broken helm / and as soon as either saw other redyly they made
them ready to Just / and so hurteled to gyders with all the might of their
horses / and they to gyders so hard that sire Percyuale was smyten to the
earth / and then sir Percyuale arose lyghtely / and cast his shield on his
sholder and drew his swerd / and badde the other knight alyghte and do we
bataille unto the vttermest will ye more said that knight / and there with he
alyghte / and put his horse fro him / and then they came to gyders an esy
paas / and there they lasshed to gyder with noble suerdes / and sometime they
stroke / and sometime they foyned / and either gaf other many great wounds /
Thus they fought nere half a day / and never rested but right little / and
there was none of them both that had less wounds than xv / and they bledde
so much that it was merueyl they stood on their feet / But this knight that
fought with sire Percyuale was a proved knight and a wise fighting knight /
and sire percyuale was young and strong not knowing in fyghtyng as the other
was / Then sir percyuale spoke first and said sire knight hold thy hand a
while stille / for we have fouten for a simple matter and quarrel over long /
and therefore I require the tell me thy name / for I was never or this time
matched / So god me help said that knight / and never or this time was there
never knight that wounded me so sore / as thou have done / and yet have I
foughten in many batails and now shall thou wete that I am a knight of the
table round / and my name is sir Ector de marys brother unto the good knight
sir lancelot du lake / Allas said sir percyual and my name is sire percyuale
de galys that has maade my quest to seek sir lancelot / and now I am seker
that I shall never fynysshe my quest / for ye have slain me with your hands /
It is not so said sire Ector / for I am slain by your hands / and may ^
lyuote / therefore I require you said sire Ector unto sir Percyuale ride ye here
by to a pryory / and bring me a priest that I may receive my saueour / for I
may not live / And when ye come to the court of King Arthur / tell not my
brother sire lancelot how that ye slew me / For then he would be your mortal
enemy / But ye may say that I was slain in my quest as I sought him / Allas
said sire Percyuale ye say that thing that never will be / for I am so
faynte for bledynge that I may uneath stand / how should I then take my
horse /

Then they made both great dole out of mesure / this will not avail said
sire Percyuale / And then he kneled down and made his prayer deuoutely unto
al mighty Ihesu / for he was one of the best knights of the world that at that
time was / in whom the very feythe stood most in

Right so there came by / the holy vessel of the Sancgreal with all manner of
swetnes and savor / but they could not redyly see who that bare that vessel /
but sire Percyuale had a glemerynge of the vessel and of the maiden that bare
hit / for he was a parfyte clean maiden / and forth with all they both were as
hole of hyde and lymme as ever they were in their life days / then they gaf
thankynges to god with great myldenesse / O Ihesu said sir Percyuale what may
this mean / that we be thus heled / and right now we were at the point of
dyenge / I wot full well said sire Ector what it is / It is an holy vessel that
is borne by a maiden / and therein is part of the holy blood of our lord
Ihesu crist blessid mote he be but it may not be seen said sir Ector / but if
hit be by a parfyte man / So god me help said sir Percyuale I saw a damoysel
as me thought all in white with a vessel in both her hands / and forth with all I was hole / So then they took their horses and their harneis and amended
their harneis as well as they might that was broken / and so they mounted
upon their horses / and rode talking to gyders / And there sir Ector de marys
told sire Percyuale how he had sought his brother sir lancelot long / and
never could here wetynge of him / in many strange adventures have I ben in
this queste And so either told other of their adventures /

Here ends the enleuenth book /
And here follows the twelfth boook
Capitulum primum /
ANd now leave we of a while of sir Ector and of sire Percyuale / and speak we
of sir lancelot that suffered and endured many sharp shoures that ever ran
wild wood from place to place and lived by fruit / and such as he might get
/ and drank water two year / and other clothyng had he but little / but his
sherte and his breche / Thus as sir lau^celot wandered here and there / he came
in a fair medowe where he fond a pauelione / and there by upon a tree there
henge a white shield / and two swerdes henge there by and two speres lened
there by a tree / And when sir lancelot saw the swerdes / anon he lepte to
the one swerd and took hit in his hand and drew hit out / And then he
lasshed at the sheld that all the medowe range of the dyntes / that he gaf
such a noise as ten knights had foughten to gyders / Then came forth a
dwerf and lepte unto sir lancelot / and would have had the suerd out of his
hand / and then sire lancelot took him by the both sholders and threw him
to the ground upon his neck that he had al most broken his neck / and there
with all the dwerf cried help / Then came forth a lykely knight and well
apparaylled in scarlet furred with myneuer / And anon as he saw sir lancelot
/ he demed that he should be out of his wit / And then he said with fair
speech good man leye down that swerd / for as me seems / thou had more
need of sleep and of warm clothes / than to welde that swerd / As for that
said sir Lancelot come not to ny for and thou do wete thou well I will slay
the / And when the knight of the pauelione saw that he starte bakward with in
the pauelione / And then the dwerf armed him lyghtely and so the knight
thought by force and might to take the swerd from sir lancelot / and so he
came steppynge out / and when sir lancelot saw him come so all armed with
his swerd in his hand / Then sire lancelot flewe to him with such a might
and hytte him upon the helm such a buffet / that the stroke troubled his
brains / and there with the suerd brak in three / And the knight fell to the
earth as he had been deed / the blood brastynge out of his mouth / the nose
/ and the eres / And then sir lancelot ran in to the pauelione and rasshed
even in to the warm bed / and there was a lady in that bed / and she gat
her smock / and ran out of the pauelione / And when she saw her lord lie
at the ground like to be deed / then she cried and wept as she had been mad
/ Then with her noise the knight awaked out of his swoun and looked up wekely
with his eyes / and then he asked her where was that mad man that had given
him such buffet / for such a buffet had I never of man's hand / Sir said the
dwerf it is not worship to hurt him for he is a man out of his wit / and
doubt ye not he has been a man of great worship / and for sum hertely sorrow
that he has taken he is fall^n mad / and me besemeth said the dwerfe he
resembles much unto sir Lancelot / for him I saw at the great turnement
beside Lonezep / Ihesu defend said that knight that ever that noble knight
sire Lancelot should be in such a plyte / but what someuer he be said that
knight / harm will I none do him / and this knights name was Blyaunt /
Then he said unto the dwerf / goo thou fast on horsbak unto my brother sir
Selyuaunt / that is at the Castle blank / and tell him of mine adventure / and
bydde him bring with him an horse lytter / and then will we bear this
knight unto my Castle /

Capitulum ij
So the dwerf rode fast / and he came again / and brought sir Selyuaunt with
him / and six men with an horse lytter / and so they took up the fether bed
with sire lancelot / and so carried all awey with hem unto the Castle Blank /
and he never awaked till he was within the Castle / And then they bound his
hands and his f^^t / and gafe him good metes and good drynkes / and brought
him again to his strength and his fayrenesse / but in his wit they could
not bring him ageyn / nor to know him self / Thus was sir lancelot there
more than a year and an half honestly arrayed and fair farne with all / Then
upon a day this Lord of that Castle sir Blyaunt took his arms on horsbak with
a spear to seek adventures / And as he rode in a forest there met him two
knights aduenturous / the one was Breuse saunce pity / and his brother sir
Bertelot / and these two ran both attones upon sir Blyaunt / and brake their
speres upon his body And then they drew out swerdes and made great bataill
/ and fought long to gyders / But at the last sir Blyaunt was sore wounded /
and felt him self faynte / and then he fled on horsbak toward his castle /
And as they came hurlyng under the Castle where as sir lancelot lay in a
wyndowe / and saw how two knights laid upon sir Blyaunt with their swerdes /
And when sir lancelot saw that yet as wood as he was he was sorry for his
lord sir B^yaunt / And then sir lancelot brake the chains fro his legs
and of his arms / and in the brekyng he hurt his hands sore / and so sir
lancelot ran out at a posterne / and there he met with the two knytes that
chaced sir Blyaunt / and there he pulled down sir Bertelot with his bare hands
from his horse / and there with all he wroth his suerd out of his hand / and so
he lepte unto sir Bruise / and gaf him such a buffet upon the head that he
tumbled bakward over his horse croupe / And when sir Bertolet saw there his
brother have such a fall / he gat a spear in his hand / and would have run
sir lancelot through / that saw sir Blyaunt / and struck of the hand of sir
Bertelot / And then sir bruise and sir bertelot gat their horses and fled away
/ when sire Selyuaunt came and saw what sir lancelot had done for his brother
/ then he thanked god and so did his brother that ever they did him any good
But when sire blyaunt saw that sir lancelot was hurt with the brekyng of
his yrons / then was he heavy that ever he bound him / bind him no more said
sir Selyuaunt / for he is happy and gracyous Then they made great Joy of sir
lancelot / and they bound him no more / and so he abode there an half year
and more / and on the morn erly sir lancelot was ware where came a great bore
with many hounds nyghe him / But the bore was so byg there might no hounds
tere him / and the hunters came after blowyng their horns both upon horsbak
and some upon foot / and then sir lancelot was ware Where one alyght and
teyed his horse to a tree. and lened his spear ageynste the tree /

Capitulum iij
So came sir lancelot and fond the horse bounden till a tree / and a spear
lenyng against a tree / and a swerd teyed to the sadel bow / and then sir
lancelot lepte in to the sadel and gat that spear in his hand / and then he
rode after the bore / and then sire lau^celot was ware where the bore set his
ars to a tree fast by an hermytage / Then sir lancelot ran at bore with
his spear / and there with the bore turned him nemly / and rafe out the longes
and the heart of the horse so that lancelot fell to the earth / and or ever
sire lancelot myt get from the horse / the bore rafe him on the brawne of the
thy up to the hough bone / and then sir lancelot was wroth / and up he gat
upon his feet / and drew his swerd / and he smote of the bores head at one
stroke / and there with all came out the heremyte / and saw him have such a
wound / then the heremyte came to sir lancelot and bemoned him / and would
have had him home unto his hermytage / but when sir lancelot herd him speak /
he was so wroth with his wound that he ran upon the heremyte to have slain
him / and the heremyte ran awey / and when sir lau^celot might not over get
him / he threw his swerd after him / for sir lancelot might tho no ferther
for bledyng / then the heremyte turned ageyn / and asked sir lancelot how he
was hurt / Felawe said sir lancelot this bore has beten me sore / Then
come with me said the heremyte and I shall hele you / Goo thy wey said sir
lancelot and dele not with me / Then the heremyte ran his way / and there
he met with a good knight with many men / Sir said the heremyte / here is
fast by my place the goodlyest man that ever I saw / and he is sore wounded
with a bore / and yet he has slain the bore / But well I wot said the
heremyte and he be not helped that goodly man shall dye of that wound / and
that were great pity / Then that knight at desire of the heremyte gat a
carte / and in that carte that knight put the bore and sir lancelot / for
sir lau^celot was so feeble that they might right easyly deal with him / and
so sir lancelot was brought unto the hermytage and there the heremyte heled
him of his wound / But the heremyte might not find sir launcelots sustenaunce
/ and so he enpayred and waxed feeble both of his body and of his wit for the
defaute of his sustenaunce / he waxed more wooder than he was before hand / And
then upon a day sir lancelot ran his Way in to the forest / and by
adventure he came to the cite of Corbyn where dame Elayne was that bare
Galahalt sir Launcelots sone / and so when he was entryd in to the town he
ran through the Town to the Castle / and then all the young men of that
Cite ran after sir Lancelot / and there they threw turues at him / and gaf
him many sad strokes / And ever as sire lancelot might over retche any of
them / he threw them so that they would never come in his hands no more / for
of some he brake the legs and the arms / and so fled in to the Castle /
and then came out knights and squyers and rescowed sir lancelot / And when
they beheld him / and looked upon his person / they thought they saw never so
goodly a man / And when they saw so many wounds upon him all they demed that
he had been a man of worship / And then they ordained him clothes to his body
/ and straw underneath him / and a little house / And then every day they would
throw him mete / and set him drink / but there was but few would bring him
mete to his hands

So it befelle that king Pelles had a neuewe / his name was Castor / and so
he desired of the king to be made knight / and so at request of this Castor
the king made him knight at the feast of Candelmasse / And when sir Castor
was made knight / that same day he gaf many gowns / And then sir Castor
sent for the fool that was sir Lancelot / And when he was come before sir
Castor / he gaf sir Lancelot a Robe of scarlet and all that longed unto him /
And when sir lancelot was so arrayed like a knight he was the semelyest man
in all the Court / and none so well made / So when he saw his time / he
went in to the gardyn And there sire lancelot leid him down by a well and
slepte And so at after none dame Elayne and her maidens came in to the gardyn
to play them / and as they romed up and down one of dame Elayns maidens aspyed

all she fell on weeping so hertely / that she sanke even to the earth / and
when she had thus wept a great while / then she aroos and called her
maidens and said she was seek / And so she yede out of the gardyn / and she
went streyghte to her fader / and there she took him a part by her self / and
then she said O fader now have I need of your help / and but if that ye help

awake him rudely / what he will do we al know not / But ye shall abide / and I
shall throw such an enchauntement upon him / that he shall not awake within
the space of an hour / and so she did Then within a little while after the
king commanded that all people should avoid that none should be in that way
there as the king would come / and so when this was done / these four men and
these ladies laid hand on sir lancelot / and so they bare him in to a Toure /
and so in to a chamber where was the holy vessel of the Sancgreal / and by
force sir lancelot was laid by that holy vessel / and there came an holy man

for Crystes love said sir Lancelot keep hit in counceylle / and let no man
know hit in the world / for I am sore ashamed that I have been thus myscaryed /
for I am bannysshed out of the Country of Logrys for ever that is for to say
the country of England / And so sir Lancelot lay more than a fourtenyghte or
ever that he might stere for sorenes / And then upon a day he said unto dame
Elayne these words / lady Elayne for your sake I have had much trauaill care
and anguysshe / it needs not to rehearse hit / ye know how / Not withstandyng

Now will ye for my love said sire lancelot goo unto your fader and get me a

should be sir lau^celot du lake / for or now I have seen you / sir said
lancelot ye are not as a gentyl knyt / I put caas my name were sir lau^celot /
and that it list me not to discover my name / what should it grieve you here to
keep my counceyl / and ye not hurt there by / but wete thou well and ever it lie
in my power I shall grieve you and that I promise you truly / Then sir Castor
kneled down and besout sir lau^celot of mercy / for I shall never utter what ye
be while that ye be in these parties / then sire lancelot pardonned him /
And then after this king Pelles with x knights / and dame Elayne / and
twenty ladies rode unto the Castle of Blyaunt that stood in an Island beclosed
in iron with a fair water deep and large / And when they were there / sir
lancelot let call hit the Joyous isle / and there was he called none other
wise / but Le cheualer malfet the knight that has trespaced / Then sire
Lancelot let make him a shield all of Sabel / and a queen crowned in the
mids all of silver / and a knight clean armed knelyng before her and every
day ones for any myrthes that all the ladies myt make him / he would ones every
day look toward the realm of Logrys / where king Arthur and Queen Gueneuer
was And then would he fall upon a weeping as his heart should to braste / So
hit fell that time sir lancelot herd of a Iustynge fast by his Castle within
three leghes then he called unto him a dwerf and he badde him goo unto that
Instynge / and or ever the knights depart look thou make there a cry in
herynge of all the knights / that there is one knight in the Joyous isle that
is the Castle of Blyaunt / and say his name is le cheualer malfet that will
Just ageynste knights that will come / And who that puts that knight to
the werse / shall have a fair maid and a Ierfaucon /

Capitulum septimum /
So when this cry was made / unto Joyous isle drew knights to the number
of five honderd / and wete ye well there was never seen in Arthurs days one
knight that did so much deeds of arms as sire lancelot did three days to
gyders / For as the book makes truly mencyon / he had the better of all the
five honderd knights / and there was not one slain of them / And after that
sir lancelot maade them all a great feast / and in the mean while came sir
Percyual de galys and sir Ector de marys under that Castle / that was called
the Joyous isle / And as they beheld that gay castle / they would have gone to
that Castle / but they might not for the broad water / and bridge could they
find none / Then they saw on the other side a lady with a sperhault on her
hand and sir Percyual called unto her / and asked that lady who was in that
Castle / Fair knights she said / here within this castle is the fairest lady
in this land / and her name is Elayne / Also we have in this Castle the fairest
knight and the myghtyest man that is I dar say living / and he called him
self le cheualer mal fett / how came he in to these marches said sir Percyuale
/ Truly said the damoysel / he came in to this country like a mad man with
dogs and boys chacyng him thorou the Cite of Corbyn / and by the holy vessel
of the S^nke greal he was brought in to his wit again / but he will not do
batail with no knight / but by vndorne or by none / And if ye list to come
in to the castle said the lady ye must ride unto the ferther side of the
castle / and there shall ye find a vessel that will bear you and your horse /
Then they departed / and came unto the vessel / And then sire Percyual
alyghte / and said to sire Ector de marys / ye shall abide me here until that
I wete what manner a knight he is / For it were shame unto us in as much as he
is but one knight / and we should both do batail with him / do ye as ye list
said sire Ector / and here I shall abide you until that I here of you Then
passed sire Percyual the water / And when he came to the Castle gate / he bad
the porter goo thou to the good knight within the Castle / and tell him /
here is come an errau^t knight to Just with him / Sir said the porter ride ye
within the Castle / and there is a common place for Iustynge that lords and
ladies may behold you / So anon as sir lancelot had warning / he was soon
ready / and there sir Percyual and sir lancelot encountered with such a might
/ and their speres were so rude that both the horses and the knights fell
to the earth / Then they avoided their horses / and flange out noble swerdes
/ and hew awey cantels of their sheldes / and hurtled to gyder with their
sheldes like two bores / and either wounded other passing sore / At the last
sir Percyual spoke first when they had foughten there more than two hours /
Fair knight said sire Percyuale I require the tell me thy name for I met
never with such a knight / Sir said sir lancelot my name is le cheueler mal
fet / Now tell me your name said sire Lancelot I require you gentyl knight

Truly said sire Percyual my name is sir Percyual de galis that was brother unto
the good knight sire Lamozak de galys / and king Pellenore was our fader /
and sire Agloual is my brother / Allas said sire lancelot what have I done to
fight with you that art a knight of the table round / that sometime was your
felawe

ANd there with all sire lancelot kneled down upon his knees and threw awey
his sheld and his suerd from him / when sire Percyual saw him do so / he
merueyled what he mened / And then thus he said / sire knight what someuer
thou be / I require the upon the high order of knyghthode tell me thy true
name / Then he said so god me help my name is sire lancelot du lake king
Bans sone of Benoy / Allas said sir Percyual what have I done I was sent by
the Queen for to seek you / and so I have sought you nygh this two year / and
yonder is sire Ector de marys your brother abides me on the other side of the
yonder water / Now for gods sake said sire Percyual forgive me mine offenses
that I have here done / hit is soon forgyuen said sire lancelot / Then sire
Percyual sent for sir Ector de marys And when sir lancelot had a syghte of
him / he ran unto him and took him in his arms / and then sir Ector kneled
down / and either wept upon other that all had pity to behold them / Then
came dame Elayne / and she there maade them great chere as might lie in her
power / and there she told sir Ector and sir Percyual how and in what manner
sir lancelot came in to that country / And how he was heled / and there hit
was known how long sir lancelot was with sire Blyaunt and with sir Selyuaunt
/ and how he first met with them / and how he departed from them by cause of
a bore / and how the heremyte heled sire lancelot of his great wou^d and how

NOw leave we sire lancelot in the Joyous isle with the lady dame Elayne and sir
Percyual and sir Ector playenge with hem / and torn we to sir Bors de ganys
and sire Lyonel that had sought sire lancelot nygh by the space of two year /
and never could they here of him / and as they thus rode / by adventure they
came to the house of Brandegore / and there sir Bors was well known / for he had
geten a child upon the kings daughter fyften year to forne / and his name was
Helyn le blank / And when sire Bors saw that child hit lyked him passing
well / And so tho knights had good chere of the king Brandegore / And on the
morn sire Bors came before king Brandegore and said Here is my sone Helyn le
blanck / that as it is said he is my sone / And sithe hit is so / I will that
ye wete that I will have him with me unto the Court of king Arthur / Sir said
the king / ye may well take him with you / but he is over tender of age / As
for that said sire Bors I will have him with me / and bring him to the hows
of most worship of the world / So when sire Bors should depart / there was
made great sorrow for the departing of Helyn le blanck / and great weeping was
there made / But sire Bors and sire Lyonel departed / And within a while they
came to Camelot / where was king Arthur / And when king Arthur understood
that Helyn le blank was king Bors sone / and neuewe unto king Brandegore /
Then king Arthur let him make knight of the round table / and so he
preued a good knight / and an aduenturous / Now will we torn to our matter of
sire lancelot / Hit befelle upon a day sir Ector and sir Percyual came to sir
Lancelot and asked him what he would do / and whether he would goo with them
unto king Arthur or not / Nay said sir Lau^celot that may not be by no mean /
for I was so venetreted at the Court that I cast me never to come there more /
Sir said sir Ector I am your brother and ye are the man in the world that I
love most / And if I understood that it were your disworship / ye may
understand I would never counceyle you there to / but king Arthur and al his
knights / and in especial Queen Gueneuer maade such dole and sorrow that hit
was merueyle to here and see

And ye must remember the great worship and renoume that ye be of / how that
ye have been more spoken of than any other knight that is now living / for
there is none that bears the name now but ye and sir Tristram / therefore
brother said sire Ector make you ready to ride to the Court with us / and I dar
say / there was never knight better welcome to the court than ye / and I wot
well and can make it good said sir Ector it has cost my lady the Queen twenty
thousand pound the seeking of you / well brother said sire lancelot I will do
after your counceil and ride with you / So then they took their horses and
made them ready and took their leave at king Pelles and at dame Elayne / And
when sire lancelot should depart / dame Elayne made great sorrow / My lord
sir Lancelot said dame Elayne at this same feast of Pentecost shall your sone
and mine Galahalt be made knight / for he is fully now xv winter old / do as
ye list said sir Lancelot / god give him grace to preue a good knight / As
for that said dame Elayne I doubt not he shall preue the best man of his kyn
except one / then shall he be a man good enough said sire lancelot /

Then they departed / and within five days Journey they came to Camelot /
that is called in Englyssh wynchester / And when sire lancelot was come
among them / the king and all the knights made great Joy of him And there
sire Percyual de galys and sire Ector de marys began and told the hole
adventures that sire lancelot had been out of his mind the time of his absence
/ and how he called him self le cheueler malefet / the knyt that had trespaced
And in three days sir lancelot smote down five honderd knights / And ever as
sire Ector and sire Percyual told these tales of sire lancelot queen Gueneuer
wept as she should have dyed / Then the queen made great chere / O Ihesu said
king Arthur I merueyle for what cause ye sire lancelot went out of your
mind / I and many other deem it was for the love of fair Elayne the daughter
of king Pelles / by whom ye ar noysed that ye have gotten a child / and his
name is Galahalt / and men say / he shall do merueylles / My lord said sir
lancelot if I did any folly / I have that I sout and there with all the king
spak no more / But all sire launcelots kynne knew for whom he went out of
his mind / And then there were great feestes made and great Joy / and many
great lords and ladies when they herd that sir lancelot was come to the
Court again they made great joy

Capitulum xj
NOw will we leave of this matter and speak we of sire Tristram / and of sir
Palomydes that was the Sarasyn vncrystened / when sir Tristram was come home
unto Joyous guard from his adventures / All this while that sir lancelot was
thus mist two year and more / sire Tristram bare the renomme through all the
realm of Logrys and many strange adventures befelle him and full well and manly
and worshipfully he brought hem to an end / So when he was come home la
Beale Isoud told him of the great feast that should be at Pentecost next
following / and there she told him how sir lancelot had been mist two year / and
all that while he had been out of his mind / and how he was helped by the holy
vessel the Sancgreal / Allas said sir Tristram that caused some debate betwixe
him and Queen Gueneuer / Sir said dame Isoud I know hit all / for queen
Gweneuer sent me a letter in the which she wrote me all how hit was for to
require you to seek him / and now blessid be god said la Beale Isoud he is hole
and sound and come again to the Court / thereof am I glad said sir Tristram
and now shall ye and I make us ready / for both ye and I will be at feast Sir
said Isoud and hit please you I will not be there / for thorugh me ye be
marked of many good knights / and that caused you to have much more labor
for my sake than needs you / Then will I not be there said sir Tristram /
but if ye be there / god defend said la beale Isoud / for then shall I be
spoken of shame among all Queen's and ladies of estate / for ye that are called
one of the noblest knights of the world / and ye a knight of the round table
/ how may ye be mist at that feast / what shall be said among all knights
See how sire Tristram hunteth and hawketh and coureth within a Castle with his
lady / and forsakes your worship / Allas shall some say hit is pity that ever
he was made knight or that ever he should have the love of a lady / Also what
shall Queen's and ladies say of me / hit is pity that I have my life that I will
hold so noble a knight as ye ar from his worship / So god me help said sire
Tristram unto la Beale Isoud / hit is passing well said of you and nobly
counceyled / and now I well understand that ye love me / and like as ye have
counceyled me I will do a part there after / But there / halle no man nor
child ride with me / but my self And so will I ride on tewesday next coming
and no more harneis of werre but my spear and my suerd /

Capitulum xij
ANd so when the day came / sire Tristram took his leave at la Beale Isoud /
and she sent with him / iiij knights / and within half a mile he sent them
again / and within a mile after sir Tristram saw before him where sir
palomydes had stryken down a knight / and al most wounded him to the death /
Then sir Tristram repentyd him / that he was not armed / and then he houed
stylle / with that sir palomydes knew sir Tristram and cried on high / sir
Tristram now be we met / for or we depart / we will redress our old sores
/ As for that said sir Tristram there was yet never christian man might make his
boost that ever I fled from him / and wete ye well sir Palomydes thou that
art a saresyn shall never make thy boost that sir Tristram de lyones shall flee
from the / And there with sir Tristram made his horse to run / and with all
his might he came streyghte upon sir Palomydes / and bras^e his spear upon him
an honderd pyeces / And forth with all sir Tristram drew his swerd / And
then he turned his horse and stroke at palomydes / vj / great strokes upon his
helm / and then sir Palomydes stood stylle / and beheld sire Tristram / and
merueyled of his woodenes / and of his folly / And then sir palomydes said to
him self / and sir Tristram were armed / it were hard to s^ace him of this
bataille / and if I torn again and slay him I am ashamed where someuer that I
goo Then sir Tristram spoke and said / Thou coward knight what castest thou
to do / why wolt thou not do bataille with me / for have thou no doubt I
shall endure all thy malice / A sir Tristram said Palomydes full well thou
wotest I may not fight with the for shame / for thou art here naked and I am
armed / And if I slay the / dishonor shall be mine / and well thou wotest said
sir Palomydes to sir Tristram I know thy strength and thy hardynesse to
endure against a good knight / That is truth said sir Tristram I understand
thy valiantness well / ye say well said sir Palomydes / Now I require you
tell me a question that I shall say to you / Tell me what hit is said sir
Tristram / and I shall ansuer you the truth as god me help / I put caas
said sir Palomydes that ye were armed at al rytes as well as I am / and I naked
as ye be what would ye do to me now by your true knyghthode / A said sir
Tristram now I understand the well sir Palomydes / for now must I say mine own
Judgment / and as god me bliss that I shall say / shall not be said for no
fere that I have of the / But this is all wete sir Palomydes / as at this time
thou sholdest depart from me / for I would not have adoo with the / no more will
I said palomydes / and therefore ride forth on thy way / as for that I may chese
said sir Tristram outher to ride or to abide / but sir Palomydes said sir
Tristram I merueille of one thing that thou that art so good a knight that
thou wolt not be crystened / and thy brother sir Safere has been Crystened many
a day

Capitulum xiij
AS for that said sire Palomydes I may not yet be cristened / for one auowe
that I have made many years a gone / how be it in my heart I bileue in Ihesu
crist and his mylde mother mary / but I have but one batail to do / and when
that is done I will be baptized with a good will

By my head said Tristram as for one bataille thou shat not seek it no longer /
For god defend said sir Tristram that thur my defaute thou sholdest longer
live thus a sarasyn / for yonder is a knight that ye sire Palomydes have hurt
and smyten down / Now help me that I were armed in his armor / and I shall
soon fulfylle thine auowes / As ye will said palomydes so it shall be / So
they rode both unto that knight that satte upon a bank / and then sir
Tristram salewed him and he wekely salewed him again / Sir knyt said sir
Tristram I require you tell me your right name / Sir he said my name is sir
Galleron of Galway and knight of the table round / So god me help said sir
Tristram I am right heavy of your hurtes / but this is all I must pray you to
lene me all your hole armor / for ye see I am unarmed / and I must do batail
with this knight / sir said the hurt knight ye shall have hit with a good
will / but ye must beware for I warn you that knight is wyghte / Sir said
Galeron I pray you tell me your name / and what is that knights name yt has
beten me / Sir as for my name it is sir Tristram de lyones / and as for the
knights name that has hurt you is sir Palomydes brother to the good knight
sire Safere / and yet is sir Palomydes vncrystened / Allas said sir Galleron /
that is pity that so good a knight and so noble a man of arms should be
vncrystened / So god me help said sir Tristram outher he shall slay me or I

sir Tristram said sir Galeron / your renoume and worship is well known thorou
many reames / and god save you this day from senshyp and shame / Then sir
Tristram unarmed Galeron / the which was a noble knight / and had done many
deeds of arms / and he was a large knight of flesh and boon / And when he
was unarmed he stood upon his feet / for he was brysed in the bak with a spear
/ yet so as sir Galleron might he armed sir Tristram / And then sir
Tristram mounted upon his own horse and in his hand he gat sir Gallerons spear
/ and there with all sir palomydes was ready / and so they came hurtlynge to
gyders / and either smote other in mids of their sheldes / and there with all
sir Palomydes spear brak / and sire Tristram smote down the horse / and sir
Palomydes as soon as he might avoid his horse / and dressid his sheld / and
pulled out his swerd / that saw sir Tristram / and there with all he alyght

ANd then they came to gyders as two wyld bores / lasshynge to gyders tracyng
and trauercyng as noble men / that often had been well proved in batail / but ever
sir Palomydes dredde the might of sire Tristram / and therefore he suffered him
to brethe him / thus they fought more than two hours / but often sir Tristram
smote such strokes at sir Palomydes that he made him to knele / and sire
Palomydes brake and cut awey many pyeces of sir Tristrams shield / and then
sir Palomydes wounded sir Tristram for he was a well fighting man / Then sire
Tristram was wood wroth out of mesure and rasshed upon sir Palomydes with
such a might that sire Palomydes fell grouelynge to the earth / and there
with all he l^pte up lyghtely upon his feet / and then sire Tristram wounded
Palomydes sore through the sholder / and ever sir Tristram fought stylle in
like hard / and sir Palomydes failed not but gaf him many sad strokes / And
at last sir Tristram doubled his strokes / and by fortune sire Tristram
smote sir Palomydes swerd out of his hand / and if sir Palomydes had stouped
for his swerd he had been slain / Then Palomydes stood stylle and beheld his
swerd with a sorouful heart / How now said sir Tristram unto Palomydes / now
have I the at advantage as thou had me this day / but it shall never be
said in no Court nor among good knights that sir Tristram shall slay any
knight that is wepenles / and therefore take thou thy swerd / and let us make
an end of this batail / As for to do this batail said Palomydes I dar ryt well
end hit / but I have no great lust to fight no more / and for this cause
said Palomydes / Mine offense to you is not so great / but that we may be
friends / All that I have offended is and was for the love of la Beale Isoud /
And as for her / I dar say she is pyerles above all other ladies / and also I
proferd her never no dishonor / and by her I have geten the most part of my
worship / and sythen I offended never as to her own person / And as for the
offense that I have done / it was ageynste your own person / And for that
offense ye have given me this day many sad strokes / and some I have yeuen you
again / and now I dar say I felt never man of your might / nor so well
brethed / but if hit were sir lancelot du lake / wherefore I require you my lord

sir Tristram And as ye say / so hit shall be / and all thyn euylle will god
forgive it you and I do / And here within this mile is the suffrecan of
Carl^^l that shall give you the sacrament of baptym / Then they took their
horses and sire Galleron rode with them / And when they came to the suffrecan
sire Tristram told him their desire / Then the suffrecan let fylle a great
vessel with water / And when he had hallowed hit / he then confessid clean
sir Palomydes / and sir Tristram and sir galleron were his godfaders / And

yonder ye may see him said the king / Then she went unto Lancelot and said
sir lancelot I salewe you on king Pelles behalf / and I require you come on
with me here by in to a forest / then sir lancelot asked her with whom she
dwelled / I dwell said she with king Pelles / what will ye with me said
Lancelot / ye shall know said she when ye come thither / well said he I will
gladly goo with you / So sir lancelot badde his squire sadel his horse / and
bring his arms / and in all have he did his commandment / Then came the

said the gentylwoman wete ye well he shall be with you to morn by dinner time If I

Right so departed sir lancelot with the gentylwoman / and rode until that he
came in to a foreste and in to a great valey / where they saw an Abbay of
nonnes / and there was a squire ready and opened the gates / and so they entryd
and descended of their horses / and there came a fair felauship about sir

then they ladde him unto the Abbess chamber and unarmed him / and right so

we wend to morn to have fond you at Camelot As god me help said sir lancelot
a gentylwoman brought me hither but I know not the cause In the mean while

brought with hem Galahad the which was passing fair and well made that
uneath in the world men might not find his match / and all tho ladies wept
/ Sire said they all we bring you here this child / the which we have
nourisshed / and we pray you to make him a knight / for of a more worthyer
man's hand may he not receive the order of knyghthode / Sir lancelot beheld
the young squire / and saw him semely and demure as a douue / with all manner
of good fetuo^s / that be wend of his age never to have seen so fair a man
of form

Then said sir lancelot comes this desire of him self / he and all they

term of the writing from the birth of our lord unto that day / It seems me
said sir lancelot this sege ought to be fulfilled this same day / for this is
the feast of Pentecost after the four honderd and four and fyfty year / And if
it would please all parties I would none of these letters were seen this day till
he be come that ought to enche^e this adventure / Then maade they to ordeyne

not used on this day to sytte at your mete or that ye have seen some adventure /
ye say sothe said the king / but I had so great Joy of sir lancelot and of
his Cosyns which be come to the Court hole and sound / so that I bethoughte
me not of mine old customme / So as they stood spekyng / in came a squire / and
said unto the king / Sire I bring unto you merueillous tidings / what be they
said the king / Sir there is here bynethe at the River a great stone which I
saw flete above the water / and therein I saw styckyng a swerd / the king

were precious stones wrought with subtyle letters of gold / Then the Barons
read the letters which said in this wise / Never shall man take me hens /
but only he by whose side I ought to hang / and he shall be the best knight of
the world / when the king had seen the letters / he said unto sir lancelot
/ Fair sire this suerd ought to be yours / for I am sure ye be the best knight
of the world / Then sir lancelot ansuerd full soberly / Certes sir it is not

Also sir wete ye well I have no hardynes to set my hand to / for hit longed
not to hang by my side / Also who that assayeth to take the swerd and fails

to take the suerd and at my commandment / Sire said Gawayne your
commandment I will obey / and there with he took up the suerd by the handels
/ but he might not stere hit / I thank you said the king to sire Gawayne /

My lord sir Gawayne said sir Lau^celot now wete ye well this swerd shall
touch you so sore / that ye shall will ye had never set your hand thereto
for the best Castle of this realm / Sir he said I might not withsay mine
vnkels will and commandment / but when the king herd this he repentyd hit
much / and said unto sir Percyual that he should assaye for his love / and he
said gladly for to bear sir Gawayn felaushyp / and there with he set his hand
on the swerd / and drew hit strongly / but he might not meue hit / Then
were there moo that durst be so hardy to set their hands thereto / Now
may ye goo to your dinner said sir kay unto the king / for a merueillous
adventure have ye seen / So the king and all went unto the Court / and
every knight knew his own place / and set him therein / and young men that
were knights served them / So when they were served and all seges fulfilled
sauf only the syege perilous / Anon there befelle a merueillous adventure /
that all the doors and wyndowes of the palace shut by them self / Not for
then the halle was not gretely darked / and there with they abashed both one
and other / Then king Arthur spak first and said by god fair felawes and
lords we have seen this day merueyls / but or night I suppose we shall see
gretter merueyl^ / In the mean while came in a good old man and an ancient
clothed al in white / and there was no knyt knew from whens he came / And with
him he brought a young knyt both on foot in reed arms without swerd or
sheld / sauf a scauberd hanging by his side / And these words he said pees be
with you fair lords / Then the old man said unto Arthur / sire I bring
here a young knight / the which is of kings lygnage and of the kynrede of
Joseph of Abarima thye where by the merueylles of this Court and of strange
realms shall be fully accomplysshed

Capitulum Quartum
THe king was right glad of his words / and said unto the good man / sir
ye be right welcome / and the young knyte with you / Then the old man made
the young man to unarm him / / and he was in a cote of reed s^ndel / and bare a
mantel upon his sholder that was furred with ^rmyn / and put that upon him /
And the old knight said unto the young knight / sir follows me / and anon he
led him unto the sege peryllous / where beside sat sir Lau^celot / and the
good man lift up the clothe / and fond there letters that said thus this is
the sege of Galahalt the haute prince / Sir said thold knight / wete ye well
that place is yours / And then he set him down surely in that syege / And
then he said to the old man / sir ye may now goo your way / for well have ye
done / that ye were commanded to do / and recommaunde me unto my grant sir
king Pelles / and unto my lord Petchere / and say hem on my behalf I shall
come and see hem as soon as ever I may / So the good man departed / and there
met him xx noble squyers / and so took their horses and went their way Then
all the knights of the table round merueylled gretely of sir Galahalt that he
durst sytte there in that syege perilous / and was so tendyr of age / and
wist not from whens he came but al only by god / and said this he by whom the
Sa^cgreal shall be encheued / For there sat never none / but he / but he were
mescheued / Then sir lancelot beheld his sone and had great Joy of him /
Then Bors told his felawes upon pain of my life this young knight shall
come unto great worship / this noise was great in all the Court / so that it
came to the queen / then she had merueylle what knight it might be that durst
adventure him to sytte in the syege peryllous / many said unto the queen / he
resembled much unto sire Lancelot I may well suppose said the queen / that sir
Lancelot begatte him on king Pelles daughter / by the which he was made to
lie by / by enchauntement / and his name is Galahalt / I would feign see him
said the queen / for he must needs be a noble man for so is his fader that him
begat I report me unto all the table round / So when the mete was done that
the king and all were risen / the king yede unto the syege Peryllous and
lift up the clothe / and fond there the name of Galahad / and then he
showed hit unto sir Gawayne / and said fair neuewe now have we among us sir
Galahad the good knight that shall worship us all / and upon pain of my
life he shall encheue the Sancgreal / right as sir lancelot had done us to
understand / Then came king Arthur unto Galahad and said sir ye be welcome /
for ye shall meue many good knights to the quest of the Sancgreal / and ye
shall encheue that never knights might bring to an end / Then the king
took him by the hand and went down from the paleis to show Galahad the
adventures of the stone /

Capitulum v
THe Queen herd thereof and came after with many ladies / and showed hem the
stone where it houed on the water / Sire said the king unto sire Galahad here
is a great merueylle as ever I saw / and right good knights have assayed and
failed /

Sire said Galahad that is no merueil / for this adventure is not theirs / but
mine / and for the seurte of this swerd I brought none with me / For here by my
side hangs the scau^erd / And anon he laid his hand on the swerd / and
lightly drew it out of the stone / and put it in the shethe / and said unto
the king / now hit goth better than hit did aforehand / Sir said the king / A
sheld god shall send you now have I that swerd that sometime was the good
knights Balyn le saueage / and he was a passing good man of his hands / And
with this suerd he slew his brother Balan and that was great pity for he was a
good knight / and either slew other thorou a dolorous stroke that Balyn gaf
unto my grant fader / king Pelles / the which is not yet hole / nor not
shall be till I hele him / There with the king and all aspyed where came riding
down the river a lady on a white palfroy toward them / Then she salewed the
king and the queen / and asked if that sir Lancelot was there / And then he
ansuerd him self I am here fair lady / Then she said al with weeping how
your great doing is changed sith this day in the morn / Damoysel why say ye
so said Lancelot / I say you sothe said the damoysel / for ye were this day
the best knight of the world / but who should say so now he should be a liar /
for there is now one better than ye / And well hit is preued by the adventures
of the suerd where to ye durst not set to your hand / and that is the
change and leuynge of your name / wherefore I make unto you a remembrance /
that ye shall not wene from hensforth that ye be the best knight of the world
/ As touching unto that said lancelot / I know well I was never the best /
yes said the damoysel that were ye and are yet of any synful man of the world /
And sir king Nacyen the heremyte sends the word that the shall befalle the
grettest worship that ever befelle king in Brytayne / and I say you wherefore /
for this day the Sancgreal appiered in thy hows and fed the and all thy
felaushyp of the round table So she departed and went that same way that she
came /

Capitulum vj
NOw said the king I am sure at this quest of the Sa^cgreal shall all ye of
the table round depart / and never shall I see you again hole to gyders /
therefore I will see you all hole to gyders in the medowe of Camelot to Just
and to torneye / that after your death men may speak of hit that such good
knights were holy to gyders such a day As unto that counceyll and at the
kings request they accorded all / and took on their harneis that longed unto
Iustynge but all this meuynge of the king was for this intent for to see
Galahalt preued / for the king demed he should not lightly come again unto the
Court after his departing / So were they assembled in the medowe both more
and less / Then sir Galahalt by the prayer of the king and the Queen did
upon him a noble Iesseraunce / and also he did on his helm / but shield would
he take none for no prayer of the king And then sir Gawayne and other
knights praid him to take a spear / Right so he did / and the Queen was in a
toure with all her ladies for to behold that turnement / Then sir Galahalt
dressid him in mids of the medowe / and began to break speres merueyllously
that all men had wonder of him for he there surmounted all other knytes / for
within a while he had defouled many good knights of the table round / sauf
tweyne that was sir lancelot and sire Percyuale /

Capitulum vij
Then the king at the queen's request made him to a light / and to unlace his
helm that the Queen myt see him in the vysage / when she beheld him she said
sothely I dar well say that sir lancelot begat him / for never two men
resembled more in lykenes / therefore it nys no merueyle though he be of great
prowess / So a lady that stood by the Queen said / Madame for gods sake
ought he of right to be so good a knight / ye forsothe said the queen / for
he is of all parties come of the best knights of the world and of the hyhest
lygnage / for sir lancelot is come but of the / viij / degree from our lord
Ihesu Christ / and sire Galahalt is of the nynthe degree from our lord Ihesu
Christ / therefore I dar say they be the grettest gentilmen of the world / and
then the king and al estates went home unto Camelot / and so went to
euensonge to the great mynster / And so after upon that to souper / and every
knyt set in his own place as they were to fore hand Then anon they herd
crakynge and cryenge of thonder that hem thought the place should all to drive
/ In the mids of this blast entered a son beaume more clerer by seven times
than ever they saw day / And al they were alyghted of the grace of the holy
ghoost / then began every knight to behold other / and either saw other
by their semynge fayrer than ever they saw before / Not for then there was
no knight might speak one word a great while / and so they looked every man on
other as they had been dome / Then there entered in to the halle the holy graile
couerd with white samyte / but there was none might see hit / nor who bare hit
/ And there was all the halle fulfilled with good odoures / and every knyt had
suc^e metes and drynkes as he best loved in this world / And when the holy
grayle had be borne through the halle / then the holy vessel departed suddenly
that they wyste not where hit becam / then had they all brethe to speak /
And then the king yielded thankynges to god of his good grace that he had
sent them / Certes said the king we ought to thank our lord ihesu gretely
for that he has showed us this day at reverence of this hyhe feast of
Pentecost / Now said sir Gawayn we have been served this day of what metes and
drynkes we thought on / but one thing begyled us we might not see the holy
Grayle / it was so precyously couerd / wherefore I will make here auowe / that to
morn without longer abydyng I shall labor in the quest of the Sancgreal /
that I shall hold me out a twelve month and a day or more if need be / and
never shall I return again unto the Court / till I have seen hit more openly
than it has been seen here / and if I may not speed / I shall return again as
he that may not be against the will of our lord Ihesu Christ / when they of the
table round herd sir Gawayne say so / they arose up the most party and maade
such auowes as sire Gawayne had made /

Anon as king Arthur herd this / he was gretely dyspleasyd / for he wyste well
they might not again say their auowes Allas said king Arthur unto sir
Gawayn ye have nyghe slain me with the auowe and promise that ye have made /
For through you ye have berafte me the fairest felauship and the truest of
knyghthode that ever were seen to gyders in any realm of the world / For
when they depart from hens I am sure / they all shall never mete more in
this world / for they shall dye many in the quest / And so it forthynketh me
a little / for I have loved them as well as my life wherefore hit shall grieve me
right sore the departycyon of this felauship / For I have had an old customme
to have hem in my felauship /

Capitulum Octauuum /
ANd there with the teres fylle in his eyes / And then he said Gawayne Gawayne
ye have set me in great sorrow / For I have great doubt that my true
felauship shall never mete here more again / A said sir Lancelot comfort
your self / for hit shall be unto us a great honor and much more than if we
dyed in any other places / for of death we be syker / A lau^celot said ye king
ye great love yt I have had unto you all the days of my life makes me to say
such doleful words / for never Christian king had never so many worthy men
at this table as I have had this day at the round table and that is my great
sorrow / when the Queen ladies and gentilwymmen wist these tidings / they
had such sorrow and heaviness that there might no tongue tell hit / for tho
knights had hold them in honor and chyerte / But among all other Queen
Gueneuer made great sorrow / I merueylle said she my lord would suffer hem to
depart from him / thus was all the Court troubled for the love of the
departycyon of tho knights / And many of tho ladies that loved knights would
have gone with her lovers / and so had they done had not an old knight come
among them in Relygyous clothyng / and then he spoke all on high / and
said fair Lords which have sworn in the quest of the Sancgreal / Thus sends
you nacyen the heremyte word that none in this queste led lady nor gentylwoman
with him / for hit is not to do in so high a seruyse as they labor in / for
I warn you plain he that is not clean of his sins / he shall not see the
mysteryes of our lord Ihesu Christ / and for this cause they left these ladies
and gentylwymmen / After this the queen came unto Galahad and asked him of
whens he was / and of what country / he told her of whens he was / and sone
unto Lancelot / she said he was / as to that he said neither ye nor nay / /
So god me help said the queen of your fader ye need not to shame you / for he
is the goodlyest knight and of the best men of the world comen and of the
strene of all parties of kings / wherefore ye ought of right to be of your
deeds a passing good man / and certainly she said ye resemble him much /
Then sir Galahad was a little ashamed and said Madame sithe ye know in
certain wherefore do ye ask hit me / for he that is my fader / shall be
known openly and al by times / And then they went to rest them / And in
the honor of the hyhenes of Galahad he was led in to king Arthurs chamber /
and there rested in his own bed / And as soon as hit was day the king
arose for he had no rest of all that night for sorrow / Then he went unto
Gawayne and to sir lancelot that were arysen for to here mass / And then
the king ageyn said A Gawayne Gawayne ye have bitrayed me / For never shall my
Court be amended by you / but ye will never be sorry for me as I am for you /
And there with the teres began to run down by his vysage / And there with
the king said A knight sir lancelot / I require the thou counceyle me / for I
would that this quest were undone and it might be / sir said sir lancelot / ye
saw yester day so many worthy knights that then were sworn / that they
may not leave it in no manner of wise / That wot I well said the king / but it
shall so heuye me at their departing that I wot well there shall no manner of
Joy remedy me / And then the king and the Queen went unto the mynster /
So anon lancelot and Gawayne commanded her men to bring her arms / And
when they all were armed sauf her sheldes and her helmes / then they came
to their felauship / which all were ready in the same wise for to goo to the
mynster to here their seruyse

Then after the seruyse was done / the king would wete how many had
undertake the queste of the holy grayle / and to account them he praid them
all

Then fond they by the tale an honderd and fyfty / and all were knights of
the table round / And then they put on their helmes and departed / and
recommaunded them all holy unto the Queen / and there was weeping and great
sorrow / Then the Queen departed in to her chamber / and held her / that no
man should perceive her great sorrows / when sire Lancelot mist the queen /
he went till her chamber / And when she saw him / she cried aloude / O
lancelot / lancelot ye have bitrayed me / and put me to the death for to
leave thus my lord A madame I pray you be not displeased / for I shall come
again as soon as I may with my worship / Allas said she that ever I saw you
/ but he that suffered upon the cross for all mankind he be unto you good
conduyte and saufte / and all the hole felauship / Right so departed
Lancelot / and fond his felauship that abode his coming / and so they mounted
on their horses / and rode thorou the street of Camelot / and there was weeping
of rich and pour / and the king turned awey and might not speak for
weeping / So within a while they came to a Cite and a Castle that hit Vagon /
there they entrid in to the castle / and the lord thereof was an old man / that
hight Vagon / and he was a good man of his living / and set open the gates /
and made hem all the chere that he myt And so on the morn they were all
accorded that they should depart eueryche from other / And on the morn they
departed with weeping chere / and every knyt took the way that him lyked best

NOw rydeth Galahalt yet withouten shield / and so rode four days without any
adventure / And at the fourth day after euensonge / he came to a white Abbay /
and there was he received with great reverence / and led unto a chamber / and
there was he unarmed / And then was he ware of knights of the table round /
one was sir Bagdemagus and sir Vwayne / And when they saw him / they went
unto Galahad / and made of him great solace / and so they went unto souper /
Sirs said sire Galahalt what adventure brought you hyder / Sir they said all
it is told us that with in this place is a shield that no man may bear about
his neck but he be mescheued outher deed within three days or maimed for ever /
A sir said king Bagdemagus I shall ^^re hit to morn for to assay this
adventure / In the name of God said Galahad / Sire said Bagdemagus and I may
not encheue the adventure of this shield ye shall take hit upon you / for I am
sure ye shall not fail / Sir said Galahad / I right well agree me thereto /
for I have no shield / So on the morn they aroos and herd mass / Then
Bagdemagus asked where the aduenturous sheld was / Anon a monk led him
behind an altar where the shield henge as white as any snow / but in the
mids was a reed cross / Sirs said the monk^ this sheld ought not to be
hanged about no knights neck / but he be the worthyest knight of the world /
therefore I counceylle you knights to be well aduysed / well said Bagdemagus I
wot well I can not the lest knight of the world / but I shall assay to bear hit
/ and so bare hit out of the mynstre / And then he said unto Galahad and
hit please you to abide here still till that ye wete how that I speed / I shall
abide you said galahad / Then king Bagdemagus took with him a good squire to
bring tidings unto sir Galahad how he spedde / Then when they had ryden
two mile and came to a fair valey before an hermytage / And then they saw a
knight come from that party in white armor horse and all / And he came as
fast as his horse might run / and his spear in his rest / And sir
Bagdemagus dressid his spear against him / and brake hit upon the white knight
/ but the other stroke him so hard that he braste the mayles / and sheef him
thorou the right sholder / for the shield couerd him not as at that time / and
so he bare him from his horse / And there with he alyghte and took the white
shield from him / saying knight thou have done thy self great folly / for this
shield ought not to be borne but by him that shall have no piece that lives
/ And then he (...) to Bagdemagus squire / and said bear this shield unto
the good knight sir Galahad that thou left in the Abbay and great him well by
me / Sir said the squire what is your name Take thou none head of my name said
the knyte / for it is not for the to know nor for none erthely man / Now fair
sir said the squire at the reverence of Ihesu Christ / tell me for what cause
this shield may not be borne / but if the berer thereof be meschyeued / Now
sithe thou have coniured me so said the knight this shield behooves unto no
man but unto Galahad / and ye squire went unto Bagdemagus / and asked whether
he were sore wounded or not / ye forsothe said he / I shall escape hard from
the death / Then he set his horse and brought him with great pain unto an
Abbay / then was he taken down softely and unarmed and leid in a bed / and
there was looked to his wounds / And as the book tells he lay there long /
and escaped hard with the life /

Capitulum x
Sir Galahalt said the squire that knight that wounded Bagdemagus sends you
gretynge / and bad that ye should bear this shield where through / great
adventures should befalle / Now blessid be good and fortune said Galahad / And
then he asked his arms / and mounted upon his horse / and henge the white
shield about his neck / and commanded hem unto god / and sir Vwayne said he
would bear him felauship if it pleasyd him / Sir said Galahad that may ye not /
for I must goo alone sauf this squire shall bear me f^lauship / and so departed
Vwayne / Then within a while came Galahad there as the white knight abode him
by the heremytage / and eueryche salewed other curt^isly / Sir said Galahad by
this shield ben many merueils fallen / Sir said the knight hit befelle after
the passion of our lord Ihesu Crist xxxij year that Joseph of Armathye the
gentyl knight / the which took down our lord of the holy Cross at that
time he departed from Iherusalem with a great party of his kynred with him /
and so he labored till that they came to a cite that hight Sarras / and at
that same hour that Joseph came to Sarras there was a king that hyghte
Euelake that had gret^ werre again the Sarasyns / and in especyal ageynste one
Sarasyn / the which was king Euelaks cosyn / a rich king and a mighty which
marched nyghe this land / and his name was called Tolleme la feyntes / So on a
day this two met to do bataill / Then Joseph the sone of Joseph of
Armathye went to king Euelake / and told him he should be discomfyt and slain
but if he left his bileue of the old law and by love upon the new law / And
then there he showed him the right bileue of the holy Trynyte / to the which
he agreed unto with all his heart / and there this shield was maade for king
Euelake in the name of him that dyed upon the cross And then through his good
bileue he had the better of king Tolleme / For when Euelake was in the batail
/ there was a clothe set before the sheld / And when he was in the grettest
peril he let put away the clothe / and then his enemies saw a fygur of
a man on the Cross where through they all were discomfyte / And so it befelle
that a man of King Euelaks was smyten his hand of / and bare that hand in his
other hand / and Joseph called that man unto him / and badde him goo with good
devotion touch the Cross / And as soon as that man had touched the Cross
with his hand / it was as hole as ever hit was to fore / Then soon after
there fell a great merueyll that the Cross of the sheld at one time vanysshed
awey that no man wist where it became / And then king Euelake was baptized /
and for the most party all the people of that Cite / So soon after Joseph
would depart / and king Euelake would goo with him whether he would or nold /
And so by fortune they came in to this land that at that time was called great
Bretayne / and there they fond a great felon paynym / that put Ioheph in to
prison / And so by fortune tidings came unto a worthy man that hyghte
Mondrames / and he assembled all his people for the great renomme he had herd
of Joseph / and so he came in to the land of great Bretayne and disherited
this felon paynym and consumed him / and there with delyuerd Joseph out of
prison / and after that all the people were turned to the Christian feithe

NOt long after that Joseph was laid in his dedely bed And when king
Euelake saw that / he made much sorrow / and said / for thy love I have left
my country / And sithe ye shall depart out of this world / leave me sum
token of yours that I may think on you / Joseph said that will I do full
gladly / Now bring me your sheld that I took you when ye went in to bataille
against king Tolleme / Then Iosephibled sore at the nose / so that he myt not
by no mean be staunched / And thereupon that sheld he made a cross of his own
blood / Now may ye see a remembrance that I love you / for ye shall never see
this shield but ye shall think on me / and it shall be alweyes as fresshe as it
is now And never shall man bear this sheld about his neck but he shall
repent hit unto the time that Galahad the good knyte ^ere hit / and the last
of my lygnage shall have hit about his neck that shall do many merueyllous
deeds / Now said king Euelake where shall I put this shield that this worthy
knight may have hit / ye shall leave hit there as nacyen the heremyte shall be put
after his death / For thydder shall that good knight come the fyftenth day
after that he shall receive the order of knyghthode / and so that day that
they set / is this time that he have his shield / And in the same abbay lies
Nacyen the heremyte / And then the white knight vanysshed away Anon as the
squire had herd these words / he alyghte of his hakney and kneled down at
Galahads feet and prayed him that he might goo with him till he had made him
knight / If I would not refuse you / then will ye make me a knyte said the
squire / and that order by the grace of god shall be well s^tte in me / So sir
Galahad granted him and turned again unto the Abbay there they came fro /
and there men made great Joy of sir Galahad / And anon as he was alyghte /
there was a monk brought him unto a Tomb in a Church yerd where that was
such a noise that who that herd hit should verily nyghe be mad or lose his
strength / and sire they said we deem hit is a fend

Now said the good man / goo to the Tomb and lift hit up / So he did and hird
a great noise / and pytoirsly he said that all men myte here hit / Sir Galahad
the servant of Ihesu Christ come thou not nyghe me / For thou shall make me
goo again there where I have been so long / But Galahad was no thing affrayed
but lift up the stone / and there came out so foul a smoke / and after he saw
the fowlest fygur lepe there out that ever he saw in the lykenes of a man /
and then he blessid him / and wyste well hit was a fend / Then herd he a
voyse say / Galahad I see there enuyronne about the so many angels that my
power may not dear the / Right so sir Galahad saw a body al armed lie in that
tomb and beside him a swerd / Now fair brother said Galahad let us remeue this
body for hit is not worthy to lie in this chircheyerd / for he was a falls
Christian man / And there with they all departed and went to the Abbay / And
anon as he was unarmed a good man came and set him down by him / and said
sire I shall tell you what betokens all that ye saw in the Tomb / for
that couerd body betokens the duresse of the world and the great sin that
our lord fond in the world / For there was such wretchydnesse that the fader
loved not the sone / nor the sone loned not the fader / and that was one of the
causes that our lord took flesh and blood of a clean maiden / for our
sins were so great at that time that well nyghe all was wickedness / Truly said
Galahad I bileue you right well / So sire Galahad rested him there that night
/ And upon the morn he made the squire knight / and asked him his name / and
of what kynred he was come /

Sire said he men calls me Melyas de lyle / And I am the sone of the king of
Denmark / Now fair sire said Galahad sithe that ye be come of kings and
Queen's / now looks that knyghthode be well set in you / for ye ought to be a
myrrour unto all chyualry

Sire said sire Melyas ye say sothe / But sire sythen ye have made me a knyt
ye must of ryt grant me my first desire yt is reasonable / ye say soth said
galahad / melyas said then that ye will suffer me to ride with you in this
quest of the sancgreal till that sum adventure depart us / I grant you sir

Melyas to Galahad / if hit like you to suffer me to take the way on the lift

it / And anon he saw a knight came riding after him that said / knight
set down that crown / which is not your / and therefore defends you /
Then sire Melyas blessid him and said Fair lord of heaven help and sane thy
new made knight / and then they let their horses run as fast as they myt
/ so that the other knyt smote sir melias thorou hauberk and through the lift
side that he fell to the earth nyghe deed / And then he took the crown and
went his way and sir Melyas lay stylle and had no power to stere / In the mean
while by fortune there came sire Galahad and fond him there in perille of death
/ And then he said A melyas who has wounded you / therefore hit had been better
to have ryden the other way / And when sir Melyas herd him speak / sire he
said for gods love let me not dye in this forest / but bear me unto the
Abbay here beside that I may be confessyd and have my ryghtes / It shall be done
said Galahad / but where is he that has wounded you / with that sir Galahad
herd in the leaves cry on high / knight keep the from me A sir said Melyas /
Beware / For that is he that has slain me / Sir Galahad ansuerd sir knight
come on your peril / Then either dressid to other and came to gyder as fast
as their horses might run / and Galahad smote him so that his spear went
thorou his sholder / and smote him down of his horse / and in the falling
Galahad is spear brak / with that came out another knight out of the leaves /
and brake a spear upon Galahad or ever he might torn him / Then Galahad
drew out his swerd and smote of the lift arm of him so that it fell to
the earth / And then he fled / and sire Galahad sewed fast after him / And
then he turned again unto sir Melyas / and there he alyghte and dressid him
softely on his horse to fore him for the truncheon of his spear was in his body
/ and sir Galahad sterte up behind him / and held him in his arms / and so
brought him to the Abbay / and there unarmed him and brought him to his
chamber / And then he asked his saueour / And when he had received him he
said unto sir galahad / sir let death come when it pleasyd him And there with
he drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body / And then he
swouned / Then came there an old monk which sometime had been a knight and
beheld sire Melyas / And anon he ransakyd him / and then he said unto sir
galahad I shall hele him of this wound by the grace of god within the term of
seven wekes / Then was sir galahad glad and unarmed him / and said he would
abide there three days And then he asked sir Melyas how it stood with him /
Then he said he was turned unto helpyng god be thanked

Capitulum xiiij
NOw will I depart said Galahad / for I have much on hand / for many good
knights be full besy about hit / And this knight and I were in the same quest
of the Sancgreal / Sire said a good man / for his sin he was thus wounded /
and I merueylle said the good man how ye durst take upon you so rich a thing
as the high order of knyghthode without clean confession / and that was the
cause ye were bytterly wounded / For the way on the ryt hand betokens the
high way of our lord Ihesu Christ / and the way of a good true good liver /
And the other wey betokens the way of sinners and of mysbyleuers / And when
the deuylle saw your pride and presumpcyon for to take you in the quest of the
Sancgreal / that made you to be overthrown for hit may not be eucheued but by
virtuous living / Also the writing on the cross was a sygnyfycacyon of
heavenly deeds and of knyghtly deeds in gods works and no knytly deeds in
worldly works / and pride is head of all dedely sins that caused this
knight to depart from Galahad / and where thou tokest the croune of gold /
thou synnest in couetyse and in theft / All this were no knyghtely deeds /
And this Galahad the holy knight / the which fought with the two knights /
the two knights sygnefyen the two dedely sins which were holy in this
knight Melyas / and they might not withstand you / for ye are without
dedely sin / Now departed Galahad from thens and betaught hem all unto god
Sir Melyas said my lord Galahad as soon as I may ride I shall seek you / god
sends you health said Galahad / and so took his horse and departed / and rode
many Iourneyes forward and backward as adventure would led him /

And at the last hit happend him to depart from a place or a Castle the
which was named Abblasoure / and he had herd no mass / the which he was
wont ever to here or ever he departed out of any Castle or place / and kept
that for a customme / Then sir Galahad came unto a montayne where he fond an
old chapel / and fond there no body for all all was desolate / and there he
kneled to fore the altar / and besought god of wholesome counceil / So as he
prayed / he herd a voys that said / Goo thou now thou aduenturous knight to the
Castle of maidens / and there do thou awey thy wicked custommes

Capitulum xv
When sir Galahad herd this / he thanked god / and took his horse / and he had
not ryden but half a mile / he saw in a valeye before him a strong Castle with
deep dyches / and there ran beside hit a fair river that hyghte Syuarne / and
there he met with a man of great age / and either salewed other / and Galahad
asked him the Castles name / Fair sir said he hit is the Castle of maidens /
That is a cursyd Castle said Galahalt / and all they that been conuersaunt
therein / for all pity is out thereof and all hardynesse and meschyef is
therein / therefore I counceyle you sir knight to torn again / Sir said Galahad
wete you well I shall not turn again / Then looked sire Galahad on his
arms that no thing failed him / and then he put his sheld before him / and
anon there met him seven fair maidens / the which said unto him / sir
knight ye ride here in a great folly / for ye have the water to pass over /
why should I not pass the water said galahad / So rode he awey from them / and
met with a Squire that said knight / tho knights in the Castle defyen you /
and defenden you / ye go no ferther till that they wete what ye would / Fair
sir said Galahad I come for to destroy the wicked custom of this Castle /
Sir and ye will abide by that ye shall have enough to do / go you now said
Galahad and have my needs / Then the squire entryd in to the castle / And
anon after there came out of the Castle seven knights and all were brethren
/ And when they saw Galahad / they cried knight keep the for we assure the no
thing but death / why said galahad will ye all have adoo with me at ones / ye
said they thereto may thou trust / Then Galahad put forth his spear and
smote the form^st to the earth that nere he brake his neck And there with all
the other smote him on his shield great strokes so that their speres brake

Then sir Galahad drew out his swerd / and set upon hem so hard that it
was merueylle to see hit / and so through great force he made hem to forsake
the field / and Galahad chased hem till they entryd in to the Castle / and so
passed thur the Castle at another gate / And there met sir Galahad an old man
clothed in Relygyous clothing and said / sire have here the kayes of this
Castle / Then sir Galahad opened the gates / and saw so much people in the
streets that he might not nombre them / and all said sir ye be welcome / for
long have we abyden here our delyueraunce / Then came to him a gentylwoman
and said these knights be fled / but they will come again this night /
and here to begin ageyn their euylle customme

What will ye that I shall do said Galahad / Sir said the gentilwoman that
ye send after all the knights hyder that hold their lands of this Castle /
and make hem to swear for to use the custommes that were used here to fore of
old time / I will well said Galahad / and there she brought him an horn of
Iuory bounden with gold rychely / and said sir blewe this horn which will be
herd two mile about this Castle / When sir Galahad had blown the horn /
he set him down upon a bed / Then came a priest to Galahad / and said sir
hit is past a seven year agone that these seven brethren came in to this Castle
and herberowed with the lord of this castle that hight the Duke Lyanowre / and
he was lord of all this country / And when they aspyed the dukes daughter /
that was a full fair woman / Then by their falls couyn they made debate
betwixe them self / and the duke of his goodenes would have departed hem / and
there they slew him and his eldest sone / And then they took the maiden and
the tresour of the castle / And then by great force they held all the
knights of this Castle ageynste their will under their obeyssaunce and in
great seruage and truage / robbynge and pyllynge the pour common people of all
that they had

So hit happend on a day the dukes daughter said ye have done unto me greet
wrong to slay mine own fader / and my brother / and thus to hold our lands /
not for then she said / ye shall not hold this Castle for many years / for
by one knight ye shall be ouercomen / Thus she prophesied seven years agone /
well said the seven knights / sythen ye say so / there shall never lady nor
knight pass this Castle / but they shall abide maulgre their hedes / or dye
therefore / till that knight be come / by whom we shall lose this Castle / And
therefore is it called the maidens Castle / for they have devoured many maidens
/ Now said Galahad is she here for whom this Castle was lost Nay sir said the
priest she was deed within these three nyghtes after that she was thus enforced
/ and sythen have they kept their younger sister which endures great pains
with mo other ladies / By this were the knights of the countray comen / and
then he made hem do homage and feaute to the kings douter / and set hem
in great ease of heart / And in the morn there came one to Galahad and told him
how that Gawayn / gareth and Vwayne had slain the seven brethren / I suppose
well said sir Galahad and took his armor and his horse / and commanded hem unto
god /

Capitulum xvj
NOw says the tale after sir Gawayne departed / he rode many Iourneyes both
toward and froward / And at the last he came to the Abbaye where sire Galahad
had the white sheld / and there sir Gawayne learned the way to sewe after sir
Galahad / and so he rode to the Abbay where Melyas lay seek / and there sir
Melyas told sir Gawayn of the merueyllous adventures that sir Galahad did /
Certes said sire Gawayne I am not happy / that I took not the way that he went
/ for and I may mete with him / I will not depart from him lyghtely / for
all merueyllous adventures sir Galahad encheueth / Sir said one of the monks
he will not of your felauship / why said sir Gawayne / Sir said he / for ye be
wicked and synful / and he is full blessid /

Right as they thus stood talking / there came in riding sir Gareth / And
then they made Joy eyth^r of other / And on the morn they herd mass / and
so departed / And by the way they met with sir Vwayne les auoultres / and
there sire Vwayne told sir Gawayne how he had met with none adventure sithe
he departed from the Court / Nor we / said sir gawayne / and either promised
other of tho three knights not to depart while they were in that quest but if
fortune caused it / So they departed and rode by fortune till that they came by
the Castle of maidens / and there the seven brethren aspyed the three knights
/ and said sythen we be flemyd by one knight from this Castle / we shall
destroy all the knights of king Arthurs that we may overcome for the love
of sir Galahad And there with the seven knights set upon the three knights /
and by fortune sir Gawayne slew one of the brethren / and echone of his
felawes slew another and so slew the remenaunt / And then they took the
wey under the Castle / and there they lost the way that sir Galahad rode / and
there eueryche of hem departed from other / and sir Gawayne rode tylle he came
to an hermytage / and there he fond the good man saying his euensonge of our
lady / and there sir Gawayne asked herberowe for charity / and the good man
granted hit him gladly / Then the good man asked him what he was / Sire he
said I am a kynt of king Arthurs that am in the queste of the Sancgreal / and
my name is sir Gawayne / Sire said the good man I would wete how it stands
betwixe god and you / Sir said sir Gawayne I will with a good will show you
my life if hit please you / and there he told the heremyte / how a monk of an
Abbay called me wicked knight / he might well say hit said the heremyte / for
when / ye were first made knight ye should have taken you to knyghtely
deeds and virtuous living / and ye have done the contrary / for ye have lived
mescheuously many wynters / and sir Galahad is a myd and sinned never / and
that is the cause he shall encheue where he goth / that ye nor none such
shall not atteyne nor none in your felauship / for ye have used the most
vntruest life that ever I herd knight live / For certes had ye not ben so
wicked as ye ar / never had the seven brethren be slain by you and your two
felawes / For sire Galahad him self alone beat hem all seven the day to forne
/ but his living is such he shall slay no man lyghtely / Also I may say you the
Castle of maidens betokenen the good souls that were in prison before the
Incarnacyon of Ihesu Christ / And the seven knights betokenen the seven dedely
sins that reigned that time in the world / and I may lyken the good Galahad
unto the sone of the high fader / that light within a maid and bought all
the souls out of thralle / So did sire Galahad deliver all the maidens out
of the Woeful Castle / Now sire Gawayne said the good man / thou must do
penance for thy sin / sire whal penance shall I do / such as I will give
said the good man / Nay said sire Gawayne I may do no penance / For we
knights aduenturous often suffren great woo and pain well said the good man /
and then he held his pees / And on the morn sire Gawayne departed from the
heremyte / and betaught him unto god / And by aduentur he met with sire
Aglouale and sir Gryflet two knights of the table round / And they two rode
four days without finding of any adventure / and at the fyfthe day they
departed / And eueryche held as fell them by adventure

Here leueth the tale of sir Gawayne and his felawes / and speak we of sir
Galahad /

Capitulum xvij
So when sir Galahad was departed from the castle of maidens / he rode till
he came to a waste forest / and there he met with sire lancelot and sir
Percyuale but they knew him not / for he was new desguysed / Right so sir
lancelot his fader dressid his spear and brake it upon sir Galahad / and
Galahad smote him so again that he smote down horse and man / And then he
drew his suerd / and dressid him unto sir Percyuale / and smote him so on the
helm that it rofe to the coyfe of stele / and had not the swerd swarued / sir
Percyuale had been slain / and with the stroke he fell out of his sadel /
This Iustes was done to fore the hermytage where a recluse dwelled / And when
she saw sir galahad ride / she said god be with the best knight of the world
A certes said she all alowde that Lancelot and Percyuale myt here it / And
yonder two knights had known the as well as I do they would not have
encou^tred with the / then sir Galahad herd her say so he was adrad to be
known therewith he smote his horse with his spores / and rode a great paas
toward them / Then perceived they both that he was Galahad / and up they gat
on their horses / and rode fast after him but in a while he was out of their
syghte / And then they turned again with heavy chere / let us spear some
tidings said Percyuale at yonder recluse / Do as ye list said sir lancelot
When sir Percyuale came to the recluse she knew him well enough and sir
lancelot both / but sir lancelot rode overthwart and endlonge in a wild
forest and held no pathe / but as wyld adventure led him / And at the last he
came to a stony Cross which departed two ways in waste land / and by the
Cross was a stone that was of marbel but it was so derke that sir lancelot
might not wete what it was / Then sire Lancelot looked by him / and saw an
old chapel / and there he wend to have fond people / and sir lancelot teyed
his horse till a tree / and there he did of his sheld / and henge hit upon a tree
/ And then he went to the chapel door and fond hit waste and broken / And
within he fond a fair altar full rychely arrayed with clothe of clean sylke /
and there stood a fair clean candelstyk / which bare six great candels / and
the candelstyk was of silver / And when sire lancelot saw this light / he
had great will for to enter in to the chapel / but he could find no place
where he might enter / then was he passing heavy and desmayed / Then he
returned and came to his horse and did of his sadel and brydel / and let him
pasture / and unlaced his helm / and vngyrd his swerd and laid him down to
sleep upon his shield to fore the Cross /

Capitulum xviij
ANd so he fell on sleep and half waking and slepyng he saw come by him two
palfreyes all fair and white / the which bare a lytter / therein lyenge a seek
knight / And when he was nyghe the cross / he there abode stylle / All
this sir lancelot saw / and beheld for he slepte not verily / and he herd him
say / O swe^^ lord when shall this sorrow leave me / And when shall the
holy vessel come by me / where through I shall be blessid / For I have endured
thus long / for lytyl toespace / a full great while complained the knight thus
/ and alweyes sir lancelot herd it / With that sir lancelot saw the
Candelstyk with the six tapers come before the Cross / and he saw no body
that brought it Also there came a table of silver and the holy vessel of the
Sancgreal which lancelot had seen before time in king Pescheours hows / And
there with the seek knight set him up / and held up both his hands / and
said Fair sweet lord which is here within this holy vessel / take heed unto
me that I may be hole of this maladye / And there with on his hands and on his
knees he went so nyghe that he touched the holy vessel / and kyste hit / and
anon he was hole / and then he said lord god I thank the / for I am helyd
of this sickness / So when the holy vessel had been there a great while hit
went unto the Chapel with the chaundeler and the light / so that lancelot
wist not where it was become for he was overtaken with sin that he had no
power to rise again the holy vessel / wherefore after that many men said of him
shame / but he took repentance after that / Then the seek knight dressid him
up / and kyssed the cross / anon his squire brought him his arms / and asked
his lord how he did / Certes said he I thank god right well through the holy
vessel I am helyd / But I have merueil of this slepynge knight that had no
power to awake when this holy vessel was brought hyder / I dare ryt well say
/ said the squire that he dwells in some dedely sin whereof he was never
confessid / By my feythe said the knight what someuer he be / he is unhappy /
for as I dome he is of the felauship of the round table / the which is entryd
in to the quest of the Sancgreal / Sire said the squire here I have brought you
all your arms sauf your helm and your suerd / and therefore by mine assente now
may ye take this knytes helm and his suerd and so he did / And when he was
clean armed / he took sir lau^celots horse / for he was better than his and so
departed they from the Cross /

Capitulum xix
Then anon sir lancelot waked and set him up and bethought him what he
had seen there / and whether it were dremes or not / Right so herd he a wys
that said sir lancelot more harder than is the stone / and more bitter than is
the wood / and more naked and barer than is the leef of the fygge tree /
therefore goo thou from hens / and wythdrawe the from this holy place / And
when sire lancelot herd this / he was passing heavy and wist not what to do
/ and so departed sore weeping / and cursed the time that he was borne For
then he demed never to have had worship more For tho words went to his
heart till that he knew wherefore he was called so / Then sire Lancelot went
to the Cross and fond his helm / his swerd and his horse taken away / And
then he called him self a very wretch and most unhappy of all knights /
and there he said my sin and my wyckednes have brought me unto great
dishonor / For when I sought worldly adventures for worldly desires I ever
encheued them and had the better in every place / and never was I discomfyt in
no quarrel were it right or wrong / And now I take upon me the adventures of
holy things / and now I see and understand that mine old sin hyndereth me
and shameth me / so that I had no power to stere nor speak when the holy blood
appiered before me / So thus he sorowed til hit was day / and herd the fowls
sing / then somewhat he was comforted / But when sir Lancelot mist his horse
and his harne is then he wyste well god was displeased with him / Then he
departed from the cross on foot in to a foreste / and so by pryme he came to
an high hylle and fond an hermytage and an Heremyte theryn which was going
unto mass / And then lancelot kneled down / and cried on our lord mercy
for his wicked works / So when mass was done lancelot called him and
prayed him for charity for to here his life / with a good will said the good
man / Sir said he be ye of King Arthurs Court and of the felauship of the
round table / ye forsothe and my name is sir Lancelot du lake that has been
right well said of / and now my good fortune is changed / For I am the most
wretch of the world / The Heremyte beheld him and had merueille how he was
so abashed / Sire said the heremyte ye ought to thank god more than any
knight living / for he has caused you to have more worldly worship than any
knight that now lives / And for your presumpcyon to take upon you in dedely
sin for to be in his presence where his flesh and his blood was / that
coused you ye might not see hit with worldly eyes / for he will not appiere
where such sinners ben / but if hit be unto their great hurt and unto her
great shame / and there is no knight living now / that ought to kenne god so
great thank as ye / for he has yeuen you beauty / semelynes / and great
strength above all other knights / and therefore ye are the morr beholding unto
god than any other man to love him and dread him / for your strength and
manhood will little auaylle you / and god be ageynste you /

Capitulum xx
Then sir lancelot wept with heavy chere / and said Now I know well ye say
me sothe / Sire said the good man / hyde none old sin from me / Truly said
sir Lancelot that were me full loathe to discouere / For this xiiij year I never
discouerd one thing that I have used / and that may I now wit my shame and
my disauentur / And then he told there that good man all his life / And hou
he had loved a queen immeasurably and out of mesure long / and all my great
deeds of arms that I have done I did for the most party for the queen's sake /
And for her sake would I do batail were hit right or wrong / and never did I
bataille all only for gods sake / but for to win worship and to cause me
to be the better biloued / and little or naught I thanked god of hit / Then
sir lancelot said I pray you / counceylle me / I will counceyle you said the
heremyte / if ye will ensure me that ye will never come in that queen's
felauship as much as ye may forbere / And then sire lancelot promised him
he nold by the feithe of his body / look that your heart and your mouth
acoorde said the good man / and I shall ensure you ye shall have more worship
than ever ye had / Holy fader said sire lancelot I merueylle of the wys that
said to me merueillous words as ye have herd to forehand / have ye no
merueylle said the good man thereof / for hit seems well god loves you / for
men may understand a stone is hard of kind / and namely one more than
another / and that is to understand by the sir lancelot / for thou wylt not
leave thy sin for no goodness that god has sent the / therefore thou art more
than any stone / and never would thou be maade neysshe nor by water nor by
fire / And that is the hete of the holy ghoost may not enter in the / Now take heed in all the world men shall not find one knight to whom our Lord has
yeuen so much of grace as he has yeuen you / for he has yeuen you fayrenes
with semelynes / he has yeuen the wit discrecyon to know good from evil / he
has yeuen the prowess and hardynesse and given the to work so largely /
that thou have had at al days the better where someuer thou came / and now our
lord will suffer the no longer / but that thou shalt know him whether thou
wilt or nylt / And why the voice called the bitter than wood / for where over
much sin duelleth / there may be but little swetnesse / wherefore thou art
lykened to an old roten tree / Now have I showed the why thou art harder than
the stone and bytterer than the tree / Now shall I show the why thou art more
naked and barer than the fygge tree / It befelle that our lord on palmsondaye
preched in Iherusalem / and there he fond in the people that all hardness was
herberowed in them / and there he fond in all the town not one that would
herberowe him / And then he went without the Town / and fond in mids of
the way a fygge tree the which was right fair and well garnysshed of leaves /
but fruit had it none / Then our lord cursyd the tree that bare no fruit
that betokens the fygge tree unto Iherusalem that had leaves and no fruit /
So thou sir lancelot when the holy Grayle was brought before the / he fond
in the no fruit / nor good thought nor good will and defowled with lechery
/ Certes said sir lancelot all that ye have said is true / And from hens
forward I cast me by the grace of god never to be so wicked as I have been /
but as to follow knyghthode and to do fetys of arms / Then the good man
Joined sir lancelot such penance as he might do and to sewe knyghthode /
and so assoylled him / and praid sire lancelot to abide with him all that
day / I will well said sir lancelot / for I have neither helm ne horse ne
suerd / As for that said the good man I shall help you or to morn at even of
an horse and all that longed unto you / And then sir lau^celot repented him
gretely /

Here leueth of the history of sir lancelot / And here follows of sir
Percyual de galys whiches the xiiij book
Capitulum primum
NOw says the tale that when sir lancelot was ryden after sire Galahad / the
which had all these adventures above said / Sir Percyual turned again unto
the recluse / where he demed to have tidings of that knyt that Lancelot
followed / And so he kneled at her wyndow / and the recluse opened hit / and
asked sire Percyuale what he would / Madame he said I am a knight of king
Arthurs Court / and my name is sir Percyual de Galys / when the reecluse
herd his name she had great Joy of him / for mykel she had loved him to forne
any other knyt / for she out to do so / for she was his aunt / And then she
commannded the gates to be opened and there he had all the chere that she
might make him and all that was in her power was at his commandment / So on
the morn sir Percyual went to the recluse / and asked her if she knew that
knight with the white shield / Sir said she why would ye wete / Truly madame
said sir Percyual I shall never be well at ease till that I know of that
knights felauship / and that I may fight with him / for I may not leave him
so lyghtely / for I have the shame yet / A Percyual said she would ye fight
with him / I see well ye have great will to be slain as your fader was thorugh
oultrageousnes / Madame said sir Percyual hit seems by your words that ye
know me / ye said she / I well ought to know you for I am your aunt / al
though I be in a pryory place / For sum called me sometime the queen of the
waste lands / and I was called the queen of most richesse in the world / and
it pleasyd me never my richesse so much as does my pouerte Then sire
Percyual wept for very pity when that he knew it was his aunt A fair neuewe
said she when herd ye tidings of your mother / Truly said he I herd none of
her / but I dreme of her much in my sleep / And therefore I wot not whether
she be deed or on live / Certes fair neuew said she / your mother is deed / for
after your departing from her / she took such a sorrow that anon after she
was confessid she dyed / Now god have mercy on her soul said sir Percyual hit
sore forthynketh me / but all we must change the life / Now fair Aunt tell
me what is the knight / I deem hit be he that bare the reed arms on
whytsonday / wete you well said she / that this is he / for other wise ought
he not to do / but to goo in reed arms / and that same knight has no piere
/ for he worcheth all by miracle / and he shall never be overcome of none

ALso Merlyn made the round table in tokenyng of roundenes of the world / for
by the round table is the world sygnefyed by right / For all the world christian
and hethen repayren unto the round table / And when they are chosen to be of
the felauship of the round table / they think hem more blessid and more in
worship than if they had gotten half the world / and ye have seen that they
have lost her faders and her moders and all her kynne and her Wives and her
children for to be of your felauship / It is well seen by you / For syns ye
departed fro your mother / ye would never see her ye fond such felauship at the
round table / when Merlyn had ordained the round table he said by them which
should be felawes of the round table / the troth of the Sancgreal should be Well
known and men asked him how men might know them that should best do and to
encheue the Sancgreal / then he said there should be three white bulls that
should encheue hit / and the two should be maidens / and the third should be
chaste / And that one of the three should pass his fader as much as the lion
passes the lybard both of strength and hardynes

They that herd Merlyn say so / said thus unto Merlyn / Sythen there shall be
such a knight thou sholdest ordeyne by thy crafts a sege that no man should
sytte in hit / but he al only that shall pass all other knights / Then
Merlyn ansuerd that he would do so / And then he made the sege perilous in
the which Galahad satte in at his mete on Whytsonday last past / Now madame
said sir Percyual so much have I herd of you that by my good will I will
never have a do with sir Galahad but by way of kyndenes / and for gods love
fair aunte / can ye teache me some way where I may find him / for much would I
love the felauship of him / Fair neuewe said she ye must ride unto a Castle /
the which is called Goothe / where he has a cosyn germayn / and there may ye

of Carbonek where the maimed king is there lyenge / for there shall ye here

Then departed sir Percyuale from his aunte either making great sorrow / And
so he rode till euensonge time / And then he herd a clok smite / and then
he was ware of an hows closed well with walls and deep dyches / and there he
knocked at the gate / and was let in / and he alyght and was led unto a
chamber and soon he was unarmed / And there he had right good chere all that
night / and on the morn he herd his mass / and in the monastery he fond a
priest ready at the altar / And on the right side he saw a pewe closyd with
iron / and behind the altar he saw a rich bed and a fair as of clothe of
sylke and gold / Then sir Percyual aspyed that therein was a man or a Woman /
for the vysage was couerd / then he left of his lokyng and herd his seruyse /
And when hit came to the sacrynge / he that lay within that Percloos dressid
him up and vncouerd his heed / and then him besemed a passing old man / and
he had a crown of gold upon his head / and his sholders were naked and
vnhylled unto his nauel / And then sir Percyual aspyed his body / was full of
great wounds both on the sholders arms and vysage / And ever he held up his
hands against our lords body / and cried / Fair sweet fader Ihesu Christ
forgete not me and so he lay down / but always he was in his prayers and
orysons / and him seemed to be of the age of three honderd winter / And when
the mass was done the priest took our lords body / and bare hit to the seek
king / And when he had used hit / he did of his crown / and commanded the
crown to be set on the altar / Then sir Percyual asked one of the
brethren / what he was / Sire said the good man ye have herd much of Joseph
of Armathye how he was sent by Ihesu Christ in to this land for to teache and
preche the holy christian feythe / and therefore he suffered many persecucyons the
which the enemies of Christ did unto him / and in the Cite of Sarras he
converted a king whose name was Euelake / And so this king came with Joseph in
to this land / and ever he was besy to be there as the Sancgreal was / and on a
time he nyghed it so nyghe that our lord was displeased with him / but ever
he followed hit more and more / till god stroke him al most blind / Then this
king cried mercy / and said / fair lord let me never dye till the good
knight of my blood of the ix degree be come that I may see him openly that he
shall encheue the Sancgreal that I may kiss him

Capitulum Quartum
When the king thus had made his prayers he herd a voys that said herd ben
thy prayers / for thou shall not dye till he have kyst the / And when that
knyte shall come the clerenes of your eyes shall come again / and thou shall
see openly / and thy wounds shall be heled / and erst shall they never close
/ and this befelle of king Euelake / and this same king has lived this three
honderd wynters this holy life / and men say the knight is in the Court that
shall hele him / Sir said the good man I pray you tell me what knight that
ye be / and if ye be of king Arthurs court and of the table round / ye forfoth
said he / and my name is sir percyual de Galys / And when the good man
understood his name he made great Joy of him / And then sir percyual
departed and rode till the hour of none / and he met in a valey about a
twenty men of arms which bare in a bear a knight dedely slain / And when
they saw sir percyuale they asked him of whens he was / and he ansuerd of the
Court of king Arthur / then they cried all at ones slay him / Then sir
percyual smote the first to the earth and his horse upon him / And then seven
of the knights smote upon his sheld al attones and the remenaunt slew his
horse so that he fell to the earth So had they slain him or taken him had
not the good knyte sir Galahad with ye reed arms come there by adventure in to
tho parties / And when he saw all tho knights up on one knight / he cried
save me that knights life / And then he dressid him toward the twenty men of
arms as fast as his horse might drive with his spear in the reyste / and smote
the formest horse and man to the earth / And when his spear was broken / he
set his hand to his suerd and smote on the right hand and on the lift hand /
that it was merueylle to see / and at every stroke he smote one down or put
him to a rebuke / so that they would fight no more but fled to a thyck forest
/ and sir Galahad followed them / And when sir percyuale saw him chase hem
so / he made great sorrow that his horse was awey / And then he wist well it
was sire Galahad / And then he cried alowde A fair knight abide and suffer
me to do thankynges unto the / for much have ye done for me / But ever sir
Galahad rode so fast that at last he past out of his syghte / And as fast
as sir percyual might he went after him on foot cryenge / And then he met
with a yoman riding upon an hakney the which led in his hand a great stead
blacker than any bear / A fair friend said sir percyuale as ever as I may do
for you / and to be your true knight in the first place ye will require me
that ye will lene me that black stead that I might overtake a knight the
which rydeth before me

Sire knight said the yoman I pray you hold me excused of that / for that I
may not do / For wete ye well the horse is such a man's horse that and I lent
it you or any man that he would slay me / Allas said sir Percyual / I had never
so great sorrow as I have had for losing of yonder knight Sir said the yoman
I am right heavy for you / for a good horse would byseme you well / but I dar not
deliver you this horse but if ye would take him from me / that will I not do
said sire Percyual / and so they departed / and sire Percyual set him down
under a tree / and made sorrow out of me sure / and as he was there there came
came a knight rydyng on the horse that the yoman lad / and he was clean armed /

Capitulum Quintum /
ANd anon the yoman came pryckynge after as fast as ever he might / and asked
sire Percyuale if he saw any knight riding on his blak stead / ye sir for
soth / said he / why sir ask ye me that / A sire that stead he has benome me
with strength / wherefore my lord will slay me / in what place he fyndeth me /
Well said sire Percyual what would thou that I did thou see well that I am
on foot / but and I had a good horse / I should bring him soon again / Sir
said the yoman take mine hakney and do the best ye can / and I shall sewe you
on foot to wete how that ye shall speed / Then sir Percyual alyghte upon
that hakney / and rode as fast as he might / And at the last he saw that
knight / And then he cried knight torn again / and he turned / and set
his spear against sir Percyuale / and he smote the hakney in the mids of the
breast that he fell down deed to the earth / and there he had a great fall /
and the other rode his way / And then sir Percyual was wood wroth / and
cried abide wicked knight coward and falls herted knight torn again / and
fight with me on foot / but he ansuerd not / but paste on his way / when
sir Percyual saw he would not torn he cast aweye his helm and suerd / and
said / now am I a very wretch / cursyd / and most unhappy above all other
knights So in this sorrow he abode all that day till hit was night / and
then he was faynte and leyd him down and slepte till it was mydnyghte / and
then he awaked and saw before him a woman which said unto him right fyersly
/ Sire Percyuale what do^st thou here / he ansuerd I do neither good nor great
ylle / If thou wylt ensure me said she that thou wylt fulfylle my will /
when I somone the I shall lene the mine own horse which shall bear the
whyder thou wylt / Sir Percyual was glad of her profer and ensured her to
fulfylle all her desire / then abides me here / and I shall goo fetch you
an horse / And so she came soon again and brought an horse with her that was
inly blak / when Percyual beheld that horse / he merueylled that it was so
great and so well apparaylled / and not for then he was so hardy / and he
lepte upon him / and took none head of him self / And so anon as he was upon
him / he threst to him with his spores / and so rode by a forest / and the moon shone clear / And within an hour and less he bare him four days Journey
thens until he came to a rough water the which roryd / and his horse would have
borne him in to hit

Capitulum vj
And when sir Percyuale came nyghe the brymme / and saw the water so
boystous / he doubted to ouerpasse it And then he made a sign of the cross
in his forheed / when the fend felt him so charged / he shoke of sir
Percyual / and he went in to the water cryenge and roryng making great sorrow
/ and it seemed unto him that the water burnt / Then sir Percyual perceived
it was a fend the which would have brought him unto his perdycyon / Then he
commanded him self unto god / and prayed our lord to keep him from all such
temptacyons / and so he praid all that night till on the morn that it was day
/ then he saw that he was in a wild montayne / the which was closed with
the sea nygh al about that he myt see no land about him which myte releue him
but wild beestes / And then he went in to a valey / and there he saw a
young serpent bring a young lion by the neck / and so he came by sir Percyual
/ with that came a great lion cryenge and rorynge after the serpent

And as fast as sir Percyual saw this / he merueylled / and hyhed him thither /
but anon the lion had overtake the serpent and began bataille with him / And
then sir Percyual thought to help the lion for he was the more naturel
beeste / of the two / and there with he drew his suerd / and set his shield
before him / and there he gaf the serpent such a buffet that he had a dedely
wound / when the lion saw that / he made no resemblaunt to fight with him /
but made him all the chere that a be might make a man / Then Percyuale
perceived that and cast down his sheld / which was broken / and then he
did of his helm for to gadre wind / for he was gretely enchafed with the
serpente / and the lion went always about him fawnynge as a spanyel / And
then he stroked him on the neck and on the sholdere / And then he thanked
god of the felauship of that beeste / And about none the lion took his little
whelp and trussed him and bare him there he came fro / Then was sir Percyual
alone / And as the tale tells he was one of the men of the world at that time
/ which most byleued in our lord Ihesu Christ / for in tho days there were
but few folks that byleued in god parfytely / For in tho days the sone
spared not the fader no more than a stranger / And so sire Percyual comforted
him self in our lord Ihesu / and besoughte god no temptacyon should bring him
out of gods seruyse / but to endure as his true champyon / Thus when sir
Percyual had prayed he saw the lion came toward him / and then he couched
down at his feet / And so all that night the lion and he slepte to gyders
/ and when sir Percyual slepte / he dremed a merueyllous dreme that there two
ladies met with him / and that one sat upon a lion / and that other sat upon
a serpent / and that one of hem was young and the other was old / and the
youngest him thought said sir Percyual my lord saleweth the / and sends the
word that thou array the / and make the ready / for to morn thou must fight
with the strongest champyon of the world / And if thou be overcome / thou shall
not be quyte for losyng of any of thy membrys / but thou shall be shamed for
ever to the worlds end / And then he asked her what was her lord And she
said the grettest lord of all the world / and so she departed suddenly that he
wyste not where

Capitulum vij
Then came forth the other lady that rode upon the serpent / and she said sir
Percyual I complain me of you that ye have done unto me and have not offended
unto you / Certes madame he said / unto you nor no lady I never offended / yes
said she / I shall tell you why / I have nourysshed in this place a great
while a serpent which served me a great while / and yesterday ye slew him as
he gat his pray Say me for what cause ye slew him / for the lion was not
yours / Madame said sire Percyuale I know well the Lion was not mine / but I did
hit / for the lion is of more gentiller nature than the serpent / and therefore I
slew him / me seems / I did not amys against you / Madame said he what would
ye that I did / I would said she for the amendys of my best that ye bycome my
man / and then he ansuerd that will I not grant you / No said she truly ye
were never but my servant / syn ye received the homage of our lord Ihesu crist
Therefore I ensure you in what place I may find you without keeping I shall
take you as he that sometime was my man / And so she departed from sir Percyual
and left him slepynge the which was sore trauaylled of his aduysyon / and on
the morn he aroos and blessid him and he was passing feeble / Then was sire
Percyual ware in the sea / and saw a ship come sayllynge toward him / and sir
Percyual went unto the ship and fond hit couerd within and without with white
Samyte / And at the lord stood an old man clothed in a surples in lykenes of a

/ Sir said the old man of whens be ye / Sir said sir Percyual I am of king
Arthurs Court / and a knight of the table Round / the which am in the quest
of the Sancgreal / and here I am in great duresse and never like to escape out
of this wilderness Doubt not said the good man and ye be so true a knight /
as the order of chyualry requires / and of heart as ye ought to be / ye should
not doubt that none enemy should flay you / what ar ye said sir Percyuale / sir
said the old man I am of a strange country / and hither I come to comfort
you / Sir said sir Percyuale what sygnefyeth my dreme that I dremed this night
/ and there he told him all to gyder / She which rode upon the lion
betokens the new law of holy church that is to understand / faith / good
hope / believe / and baptym / for she seemed younger than the other / hit is great
reason / for she was borne in the resurection and the passion of our lord Ihesu
christ And for great love she came to the / to warn the of thy great bataille
that shall befalle the / with whom said sire Percyuale shall I fight / with
the most champyon of the world said the old man / for as the lady said / but
if thou quyte the well thou shall not be quyte by losing of one membre / but
thou shall be shamed to the worlds end / And she that rode on the serpent
sygnefyeth the old law / and that serpent betokens a fend / And why she
blamed the that thou slewest her servant it betokens no thing / the serpent
that thou slewest betokens the deuylle that thou rodest up on to the roche /
And when thou made a sign of the Cross / there thou slewest him / and put
aw^y his power / And when she asked the amendys and to become her man / And
thou saydest thou would not / that was to make the to bileue on her and leave
thy baptym / So he commanded sir Percyuale to depart / and so he lepte over

went up unto the roche and fond the lion which alwey kept him felaushyp and
he stryked him upon the bak and had great Joy of him

BY that sir Percyuale had abyden there till myddaye / he saw a ship came

thither / and fond the ship couerd with sylke more blacker than any bear / and
therein was a gentilwoman of great beauty / and she was clothed rychely that
none might be better / And when she saw sir Percyuale / she said who
brought you in this wyldernes where ye be never like to pass hens / for ye

the best man of the world / and in his seruyse he will not suffer me to dye /
for who that knocks shall enter / and who that asks shall have / and who
seeks him / he hydeth him not / But then she said sir Percyual wot ye what
I am / ye said he / Now who taught you my name said she / Now said sire
Percyuale I know you better than ye wene / And I came out of the waste forest
where I fond the reed knight with the white sheld said the damoysel / A

now shall I tell you / I saw him in the foreste chacynge two knights unto a

dread of death / and the two knights passed over / and the r^ed knight passed
after / and there his horse was drenched / and he thoro^ great strength escaped
unto the land / thus she told him / and sir Percyuale was passing glad thereof
/ Then she asked him if he had ete any mete late / Nay madame truly I ete no
mete nyghe this three days / but late here I spa^ with a good man that fed me
with his good words and holy / and refresshyd me gretely / A sir knight said
she that same man is an enchauntee and a multyplyer of words / For and ye
believe him ye shall plainly be shamed and dye in this roche for pure honger and
be eten with wild beestes and ye be a young man and a goodly knight / and I
shall help you and ye will what are ye said sir Percyual that proffered me thus
great kynd^nes / I am said she a gentylwoman that am disheryted / which was
sometime the rychest woman of the world / Damoysel said sir Percyual who has
disheryted you / for I have great pity of you / Sir said she I dwellid with the
grettest man of the world and he made me so fair and clear that there was none
like me / and of that great beauty I had a lytil pride more than I ought to
have had / Also I said a word that pleasyd him not / And then he would not
suffer me to be any longer in his company / and so drofe me from mine heritage
/ and so disheryted me / and he had never pity of me nor of none of my
counceylle / nor of my Court / And sythen sir knight hit has befallen me so
/ and through me and mine I have benome him many of his men / and made hem to

much more / Thus I and al my servants were against him night and day /
Therefore I know now no good knyt nor no good man but I get hem on my side
and I may And for that I know that thou art a good knyt / I byseche you to

there was set enough upon the table / and thereon so much yt he had merueil

the strengest wyn that ever he drank / him thought / and there with he was a

and him thought / she was the fairest creature that ever he saw / And then
sire Percyual proferd her love and prayed her that she would be his / Then she
refused him in a manner when he required her for the cause he should be the more
ardant on her / and ever he seized not to pray her of love / And when she
saw him well enchauffed / then she said sir Percyuale wete you well I shall
not fulfylle your will / but if ye swear from hensforth ye shall be my true

us eueryche as we have deserved / Then looked lancelot up to the heaven / and
him seemed the clouds did open / and an old man came down with a company of
angels / and alyghte among them / and gafe unto eueryche his blessing and
called them his servants / and good and true knights / And when this old
man had said thus he came to one of tho knights and said I have lost all that
I have set in the / For thou have ruled the ageynste me as a warryour and
used wrong werres with vain glory more for the pleasyr of the world than to
please me / therefore thou shall be confounded without thou yield me my tresour
/ All this aduysyon saw sir Lancelot at the Cross / And on the morn he
took his horse and rode till mydday / and there by adventure he met with the
same knight that took his horse / helm and his suerd when he slepte when the
Sancgreal appiered before the cross / when sire lancelot saw him / he
salewed him not fair but cried on high / knight keep the / for thou have
done to me great unkindness / And then they put before them their speres / and
sir lancelot came so fyersly upon him / that he smote him and his horse down
to the earth / that he had nyghe broken his neck / Then sir Lancelot took
the knights horse that was his own before hand / and descended from the horse he
sat upon and mounted upon his own horse and ^eyed the knights own horse to a
tree that he might find that horse when that he was arysen

Then sir lancelot rode till night / and by aduentur he met an heremyte /
and each of hem salewed other / and there he rested with that good man all
night / and gaf his horse such as he might get / Then said the good man
unto Lancelot / of whens be ye / sir said he I am of Arthurs court / and my
name is sir lancelot du lake / that am in the Quest of the Sancgreal / And
therefore I pray you to counceylle me of a vysyon the which I had at the
Cross / And so he told him all /

Capitulum quartum
LOo sir lancelot said the good man / there thou mytest understand the high
lygnage that thou art comen of / And thine aduysyon betokens after the
passion of Ihesu Criste forty year Joseph of Armathye preched the vyctory of
king Euelake / that he had in the batails the better of his enemies and of the
seven kings and the two knights / the first of hem is called Nappus an holy
man / and the second hyghte Nacyen in remembrance of his grant sire / and in
him dwelled our lord Ihesu Christ / And the third was called Hellyas le gross /
and the fourth hight Lysays / and the fyfthe hyghte Jonas / he departed out of
his country and went in to walys / and took there the daughter of Manuel /
where by he had the ^^nd of Gaul / and he came to dwell in this country /
And of him came king lancelot thy grant sire / the which there wedded the
kings daughter of Irland and he was as worthy a man as thou art / and of him
came king Ban thy fader the which was the last of the seven kings / And by the
sir lancelot hit sygnefyeth that the Angels said thou were none of the seven
felauships / And the last was the ix knight / he was sygnefyed to a lion / for
he should pass all manner of erthely knights / that is sire Galahad / the
which thou gate on king Pelles daughter / and thou ought to thank god more
than any other man living / for of a sinner erthely thou have no piere as in
knygthode nor never shall be / But lytyl thank have thou given to god for all
the great virtues that god has lent the /

Sir said Lancelot ye say that that good knyt is my sone That outest thou to
know and no man better said the good man / For thou knew the daughter of
king Pelles flesshely / and on her thou begattest Galahad / And that was he
that at the feast of Pentecost satte in the sege peryllous / And therefore make
thou hit known openly that he is one of thy begetynge on king Pelles daughter
/ for that will be your worship and honor and to all thy kynred /

And I cou^ceyle you in no place prece not upon him to have adoo with him / well
said lancelot / me seems that good knight should pray for me unto the high
fader / that I fall not to sin again / Trust thou well said the good man
thou faryst mykel the better for his prayer / but the sone shall not bear the
wyckednes of the fader / Nor the fader shall not bear the wyckednes of the
sone / but eueryche shall bear his own burden / And therefore beseke thou only
god / and he will help the in all thy needs / And then sir lancelot and
he went to souper / and so leyd him to rest / and the hair prycked so sir
launcelots skin which grieved him full sore / but he took hit mekely / and
suffered the pain / And so on the morn / he herd his mass and took his arms
/ and so took his leave /

Capitulum Quintum
ANd then mounted upon his horse / and rode in to a forest / and held no hyhe
way / And as he looked before him / he saw a fair plain / and beside that a
fair Castle / and before the Castle were many pauelions of sylke and of diverse
hew / And him seemed that he saw there five honderd knytes riding on horsbak
/ and there were two parties / they that were of the Castle were all in blak
horses and their trappours blak / and they that were without were al on white
horses and trappours / and eueryche hurteled to other that it merueylled sir
lancelot / And at the last him thought they of the castle were put to the
werse / Then thought sir lancelot for to help there the weyker party in
encrecynge of his chyualry And so sir lancelot threst in among the party of
the Castle and smote down a knight horse and man to the earth / And then he
rasshed here and there and did merueyllous deeds of arms / And then he drew
out his suerd / and struck many knights to the earth / so that all tho that
saw him merueylled that ever one knight might do so great deeds of arms /
But alweyes the white knights held them nyghe about sir lancelot for to
tyere him and wind him /

But at the last as a man may not ever endure sire Lancelot waxed so faint
of fytyng and trauaillyng and was so weary of his great deeds / but he might
not lift up his arms for to give one stroke so that he wend never to have
borne arms / and then they all took and led him awey in to a forest / and
there made him to alyghte and to rest him / And then all the felaushyp of
the castle were overcome for the defaute of him / Then they said all unto
sir lancelot blessid be god / that ye be now of our felaushyp / for we shall
hold you in our prison / and so they left him with few words / And then
sir lancelot made great sorrow / for never or now was I never at turnement nor
Iustes but I had the best / and now I am shamed / and then he said now I am
sure that I am more synfuller than ever I was / thus he rode sorowynge / and
half a day he was out of despair / till that he came in to a deep valey / And
when sir lancelot saw he might not ride up in to the montayne / he there
alyghte under an Appel tree / and there he left his helm and his shield / and
put his horse unto pasture / And then he leid him down to sleep / And then
him thought there came an old man before him / the which said A lancelot of
euylle feythe and pour believe / wherefore is thy will turned so lyghtely
toward thy dedely sin / And when he had said thus / he vanysshed away / and
lancelot wist not where he was become / Then he took his horse and armed him
/ And as he rode by the way he saw a chapel where was a recluse which had
a wyndowe that she might see up to the Altar / And all aloude she called
lancelot / for that he seemed a knight erraunt / And then he came and she
asked him what he was / and of what place / and where about he went to seek

Capitulum Sextum
ANd then he told her all to gyder word by word and the truth how it
befelle him at the turn meant / And after told her his aduysyon that he had had
that night in his sleep / and prayed her to tell him what hit might mean / for
he was not well content with hit /

A Lancelot said she as long as ye were knight of erthely knyghthode / ye
were the most merueillous man of the world and most aduenturous / Now said
the lady sythen ye be set among the knights of heavenly adventures / if
adventure fell the contrary at that turnement / have thou no merueille / for
that turnement yesterdaye was but a tokenynge of our lord / And not for then
there was none enchauntement for they at the turnement were erthely knights /
The turneme^t was a token to see who should have most knights outher Clyazar
the sone of king Pelles or Argustus the sone of king Harlon / But Clyazar was
all clothed in white / And Argustus was couerd in blak the which were comen /
All what this betokens I shall tell you / The day of Pentecost when king
Arthur held his court / it befelle that erthely kings and knights took a
turnement to gydrs / that is to say the quest of the Sancgr^al / The erthely
knights were they / the which were clothed al in black / and the covering
betokens the sins whereof they be not confessid / And they with the
covering of white betokens vyrgynyte / and they that chosen chastyte / And
thus was the quest begone in them / Then thou beheld the sinners and the
good men / and when thou saw the sinners ouercome^ / thou enclynest to that
party for bobaunce and pride of the world / and all that must be left in that
quest / For in this quest thou shalt have many felawes and thy betters / For
thou art so feeble of euylle trust and good believe / this made hit when thou
were there where they took the / and led the in to the forest / And anon
there appiered the Sancgreal unto the white knights / but thou was so f^ble
of good believe and feyth that thou myghtest not abide hit for all the techynge
of the good man / but anon thou tornest to the sinners / and that caused thy
mysauenture that thou sholdest know good from euylle / and vain glory of the
world / the which is not worth a pere And for great pride thou made great
sorrow that thou had not overcome all the white knights with the keueryng
of white by whom was betokens vyrgynyte and chastyte / and therefore god was
wroth with you / for god loves no such deeds in this quest / and this
aduision signefyeth yt thou were of evil feythe and of pour believe / the
which will make the to fall in to the deep pytte of hell if thou keep the
not

Now have I warned the of thy vain glory / and of thy pride / that thou have
many times erryd against thy maker beware of everlasting pain / for of all
erthely knights I have most pity of the / for I know well thou have not thy
pyere of any erthely synful man / And so she commanded sir lancelot to dinner
/ And after dinner he took his horse and commanded her to god / and so rode in
to a deep valeye / and there he saw a river and an hyhe mntayn / And thorou
the water he must needs pass / the which was hydous / and then in the name
of god he took hit with good heart / And when he came over / he saw an armed
knight horse and man black as any bear without any word he smote sir
launcelots horse to the earth / and so he passed on he wist not where he was
become / And then he took his helm and his shield / and thanked god of his
adventure

Here leueth of the story of sir lancelot
And speak we of sir Gawayne the which is the xvj book
Capitulum primum
When sire Gawayne was departed from his his felaushyp / he rode long
without any adventure / For he fond not the tenth part of adventure as he was
wont to do / For sire Gawayn rode from whytsontyde until Mychelmasse And
fond none adventure that pleasyd him / So on a day it befelle Gawayne met
with sir Ector de marys / and either made great Joy of other / that it were
merueylle to tell / And so they told eueryche other and complained them
gretely that they could find none adventure /

Truly said sire Gawayne unto sire Ector I am nyghe weary of this quest / and
loath I am to follow further in strange Countries / one thing merueilled me
said sire Ector I have met with twenty knights felawes of mine / and al they
complain as I do / I have merueille said sir Gawayne where that sir lancelot
your brother is / Truly said sire Ector I can not here of him nor of sir Galahad
/ Percyuale nor sir Bors / let hem be said sire Gawayne / for they four have
no pyeres / And if one thing were not in sir lancelot / he had no felawe of
none erthely man / but he is as we be / but if he took more pain upon him /
But and these four be met to gyders / they will be both that any man mete
with hem / for and they fail of the Sancgreal / hit is in waste of all the
remenaunt to recover hit / Thus as Ector and Gawayne rode more than eyghte
days / And on a saturday they fond an old chapel the which was wasted that
there seemed no man thither repaired / and there they alyghte / and set their
speres at the door / and in they entryd in to the chapel / and there made
their orysons a great while / And then set hem down in the seges of the
chapel / And as they spak of one thing and other / for heaviness they fell on
sleep / and there befelle hem both merueyllous adventures / Sir Gawayn him
seemed he came in to a medowe full of herbs and flowers / And there he saw a
rake of bulls an honderd and fyfty that were proud and blak sauf three of hem
were al white and one had a blak spot / and the other two were so fair and
so white that they might be no whyter / And these three bulls which were so
fair were teyed with two strong cords / And the remenaunt of the bulls said
among hem goo we hens to seek better pasture / and so some went / and some
came again / but they were so lene that they might not stand up right / and
of the bulls that were so white that one came again and no mo / But when
this white bulle was come again among these other / there rose up a great
cry for lack of wind yt failed them / And so they departed one here and
another there / this aduysyon befelle Gawayne that night

Capitulum secundum
But to Ector de marys befelle another vysyon the contrary / For hit seemed him
that his brother sire lancelot and he alyghte out of a chayer and lepte upon
ij horses / and the one said to the other go we seek that we shall not find /
and him thought that a man beat sir lancelot / and despoylled him / and
clothed him in another array the which was al full of knottes / and set him
upon an ass / and so he rode till he came to the fairest well that ever he
saw / and sire Lau^celot alyghte and would have drunk of that well / And when
he stouped to drink of the water the water sanke from him / And when sire
lancelot saw that he turned and went thither as the head came fro / And in
the mean while he trowed that him self and sir Ector rode till that they came to
a rich man's hows where there was a wedding / And there he saw a king / the
which said sir knight here is no place for you / and then he turned again
unto the chayer that he came fro / Thus within a while both Gawayne and Ector
awaked / and either told other of their aduysyon / the which merueylled them
gretely / Truly said Ector I shall never be merry till I here tidings of my
brother lancelot /

Now as they sat thus talkyng they saw an hand shenyng unto the elbowe / and
was couerd with reed Samyte / And upon that henge a brydel not right rich /
and held within the fyst a great candel which brenned right clear / and so
passed before them / and entryd in to the chapel / and then vanysshed awey
and they wist not where / And anon came done a voyse which said knights full
of euylle feyth and of pour by leave these two things have failed you / and
therefore ye may not come to the adventures of the sancgreal / Then first spak
Gawayne and said Ector have ye herd these words / ye truly said sir Ector I
herd all / Now goo we said sire Ector unto some heremyte that will tell us
of our aduysyon / for hit seems me we labor all in vain / and so they
departed and rode in to a valeye and there met with a squire which rode on
an hakney / and they salewed him fair / Sire said Gawayne can thou teache us to
any heremyte / Here is one in a little montayne / but hit is so rough there may
no horse go thither / and therefore ye must goo upon foot / there shall ye
find a pour hows / and there is nacyen the heremyte which is the holiest man
in this country / and so they departed either from other / And then in a
valey they met with a knight al armed which proffered hem to Just as fer as
he saw them / In the name of god said sir Gawayne / sithe I departed from
camelot / there was none proffered me to Just but ones / and now Sir said Ector
let me Just with him / Nay said Gawayne ye shall not / but if I be beat /
hit shall not forthynke me then if ye goo after me / And then either
enbraced other to Just and came to gyders as fast as their horses might run
/ and brast their sheldes and the mayles / and the one more than the other /
and Gawayne was wounded in the lift side / but the other knight was smy^en
thorou the breast / and the spear came out on the other side / and so they
fell both out of their sadels / and in the falling they brak both their
speres / Anon Gawayne aroos and set his hand to his suerd / and cast his
sheld before him / But all for naught was it / for the knight had no power to
arise again him / Then said gawayne ye must yield you as an overcome man /
or else I may slay you / A sir knight said he I am but deed / for gods sake
and of your gentilnes led me here unto an Abbay that I may receive my creator
/ Sire said Gawayne I know no hows of relygyon here by / Sir said the knight
set me on an horse to fore you / and I shall teache you / Gawayne set him up
in the sadel / and he lepte up behind him for to sustene him / and so came to
an Abbay where they were well received / and anon he was unarmed / and received
his creator / Then he prayed Gawayne to draw out the truncheon of the spear
out of his body / Then Gawayne asked him what he was that knew him not / I
am said he of king Arthurs court / and was a felawe of the round table / and
we were brethren sworn to gyders / and now sir Gawayne thou have slain me /
and my name is Vwayne les auoultres that sometime was sone unto king Vryens /
and was in the quest of the Sancgreal / and now forgive it the god / for hit
shall ever be said that the one sworn brother has slain thotherr /

Capitulum Tercium
ALlas said Gawayne that ever this mysauenture is be fallen me / No force said
Vwayne sithe I shall dye this death / of a much more worshypfuller man's hand
might I not dye / but when ye come to the Court / recommaunde me unto my
lord king Arthur and all tho that been left on live / and for old brotherhode
think on me / Then began Gawayne to weep and Ector also / And then
Vwayne him self and sire Gawayne drew out the truncheon of the spear / and
anon departed the soul from the body / Then sir Gawayne and sir Ector
beryed him as men ought to berye a kings sone / and made written upon his name
/ and by whom he was slain / Then departed Gawayne and Ector as heavy as
they might for their mysauentur / and so rode til that they came to the rou
montayne / and there they teyed their horses and went on foot to the
heremytage / And when they were come up / they saw a pour hows / and beside
the chapel a lytyl courtelage / where Nacyen the heremyte gadred wortes as he
which had tasted none other mete of a great while And when he saw the
erraunt knights / he came toward them and salewed them / and they him again /
Fair lords said he what aduentur brought you hither / Sir said Gawayn to
speak with you for to be confessid / Sir said the heremyte I am ready / then
they told him so much that he wist well what they were / And then he
thought to counceylle hem if he might / Then began gawayne first and told
him of his aduysyon that he had had in the Chapel / and Ector told him all as
it is before reherced / Sir said the heremyte unto sir Gawayne the fair medowe
and the rak therm ought to be understand the round table / and by the medowe
ought to be understand humylyte and pacyence / tho ben the things which ben
alweyes grene and quyck / for men may no time overcome humylyte and pacyence /
therefore was the round table fou^den and the Chyualry has been at all times /
so by the fraternity which was there that she might not be ouercomen / For
men said she was founded in pacyence and in humylyte at the Rake ete an honderd
and fyfty bulls / but they ete not in the medowe / for their hertes should be
set in humylyte and pacyence / and the bulls were proud and blak sauf only
three By the bulls is to understand the felaushyp of the round table which
for their sin and their wyckednes ben black / Blaknes is to say without
good or virtuous works / and the three bulls which were white sauf only one
that was spotted / The two white bitokenen sir Galahad and sir percyual for
they be maidens clean and without spotte / And the third that had a spot
sygnefyeth sir Bors de ganys / which trespaced but ones in his vyrgynyte / but
sythen he kept him self so well in chastyte that all is forgyuen him and his
misdeeds And why tho three were teyed by the necks / they be three knights in
vyrgynyte and chastyte / and there is no pride smyten in them / And the blak
bulls which said goo we hens / they were tho which at Pentecost at the
hyhe feast took upon hem to goo in the quest of the Sancgreal / without
confession they might not enter in the medowe of humylyte and pacyence / And
therefore they returned in to waste countries / that sygnefyeth death / for
there shall dye many of them / eueryche of them shall slay other for sin /
and they that shall escape / shall be so lene that hit shall be merueylle
to see them / And of the three bulls without spotte / the one shall come
again / and the other two never

Capitulum Quartum
Then spak Nacyen unto Ector sothe hit is that lancelot and ye came down of
one chayer / the chayer betokens maistership and lordshyp which ye came
down fro / But ye two knights said the heremyte ye goo to seek that ye shall
never find that is the Sancgreal For hit is the secret thing of our lord
Ihesu Christ / what is to mean that sire Lancelot fell down of his horse /
he has left pride / and taken him to humylyte / for he has cried mercy loud
for his sin and sore repented him / and our lord has clothed him in his
clothyng which is full of knottes that is the hair that he weryth daily / And
the ass that he rode upon is a be of humylyte / For god would not ride upon
no stead nor upon no palfrey / So in ensample that an ass betokens mekenes
that thou saw sir Lancelot ride on in thy sleep / and the well where as
the water sanke from him when he should have taken thereof / And when he saw
he might not have it / he returned thither from whens he came / for the well
betokens the high grace of god / the more men desire hit to take hit / the
more shall be their desire / So when he came nyghe the Sancgreal / he meked
him that he held him not a man worthy to be so nyghe the holy vessel / for he
had been so defouled in dedely sin by the space of many years / yet when he
kneled to drink of the well / there he saw great preuydence of the Sancgreal
/ And for he had served so long the deuylle / he shall have vengeance four
and twenty days long / for that he has been the deuyls servant four and
twenty years / And then soon after he shall return unto Camelot out of
this country and he shall say a part of such things as he has fond Now
will I tell you what betokens the hand with the candel and the brydel /
that is to understand the holy ghost where charity is ever / and the brydel
sygnefyeth abstynence / For when she is brydeled in Christian man's heart / she
holds him so short that he falls not in dedely sin / And the candell
which shows clerenesse and syghte sygnefyeth the ryt way of Ihesu Christ /
And when he went and said knights of pour feythe and of wicked believe /
these three things failed charity / abstynence / and troth / therefore ye may
not atteyne that hyhe adventure of the Sancgreal

Capitulum Quintum
CErtes said Gawayne / sothely have ye said that I see it openly / Now I pray
you good man and holy fader tell me why we met not with so many adventures
as we were wont to do / and comynly have the better / I shall tell you
gladly said the good man / The adventure of the Sancgreal which ye and many
other have undertake ye quest of it and find it not / the cause is / for it
appiereth not to sinners / wherefore merueylle not though ye fail thereof and
many other / For ye be an untrue knight / and a great murderer / and to good
men sygnefyeth other things than murder / For I dar say as synful as sire
lancelot has been sithe that he went in to the quest of the Sancgreal / he
slew never man / nor naught shall till that he come unto Camelot again / for
he has taken upon him for to forsake sin / And nere were that he nys not
stable / but by his thought he is lykely to torn again / he should be next
to encheue it sauf Galahad his sone / but god knows his thought and his
vnstabylnesse / and yet shall he dye right an holy man / and no doubt he has
no felawe of no erthely synful man / Sir said Gawayne hit seems me by your
words that for our sins it will not auaylle us to trauaylle in this quest
/ Truly said the good man / there ben an honderd such as ye be / that never
shall prevail / but to have shame / And when they had herd these voices
they commanded him unto god / Then the good man called Gawayne and said it
is long time passed sith that ye were made knight / and never sythen thou
seruedest thy maker / and now thou art so old a tree that in the is neither
life ne fruit / wherefore bethynk the that thou yield to our lord the bare
rynde / sithe the fend has the leaves and the fruit / Sir said Gawayne and I
had leyser I would speak with you / but my felawe here sir Ector is gone and
abides me yonder bynethe the hylle / well said the good man thou were better to
be counceylled / Then departed Gawayne ande came to Ector / and so took
their horses and rode till they came to a fosters hows which herberowed them
ryt well / And on the morn they departed from their hooste / and rode long or
they could find any adventure

Capitulum Sextum
When Bors was departed from Camelot / he met with a Relygyous man riding
on an ass / and sire Bors salewed him / Anon the good man knew him that he
was one of the knytes erraunt that was in the quest of the Sancgreal / what are
ye said the good man / Sire said he / I am a knyte that fayn would be
counceylled in the quest of the Sancgreal / For he shall have much / erthely
worship that may bring it to an end / Certes said the good man that is sothe
/ for he shall be the best knight of the world and the fairest of all the
felauship / But wete you well there shall none atteyne it but by clennes that is
pure confession / So rode they to gyder till that they came to an heremytage /
And there he prayed Bors to dwell all that night with him / and so he
alyghte and put awey his armor / and prayed him that he might be confessid /
and so they went in to the chapel / and there he was clean confessid / and
they ete bread and drank water to gyder / Now said the good man I pray the
that thou ete none other / till that thou sytte at the table where the Sancgreal
shall be / Sir said he I agree me thereto / but how wete ye that I shall sytte
there / yes said the good man that know I / but there shall be but few of
your felawes with you / All is welcome said sir Bors that god sends me / Also
said the good man / instead of a sherte and in sign of chastysement ye shall
were a garment / therefore I pray you do of al your clothes and your sherte /
and so he did / And then he took him a scarlet cote so that should be instead of his sherte / till he had fulfilled the quest of the Sancgreal / and
the good man fond him in so marueillous a life / and so stable / that he
merueilled and felt that he was never corrupt in flesshely lusts / but in
one time that he begat Elyan le blank / Then he armyd him and took his leave
and so departed / And so a little from thens he looked up in to a tree / and
there he saw a passing great bird upon an old tree / and hit was passing
dry without leaves / and the byrd sat above and had birds the which were
deed for honger / So smote he him self with his bek the which was great and
sharp / And so the great byrd bledde till that he dyed among his birds / And
the young birds token the life by the blood of the great byrd / when Bors saw
this he wist well it was a great tokenynge / For when he saw the great byrd
arose not / then he took his horse and yede his way / So by euensonge by
aduentur he came to a strong toure and an hyhe / and there was he lodged gladly
/

Capitulum Septimum
ANd when he was unarmed / they ledd him in to an hyhe toure where was a lady
young / lusty and fair / And she received him with great Joy / and made him
to sytte down by her / and so was he set to soupe with flesh / and many
deyntres / And when sire Bors saw that / he bethought him on his penance
and badde a squire to bring him water / / And so he brought him / and he
made soppes therein / and ete them / A said the lady / I trow ye like not my
mete / yes truly said sir Bors / god thank you madame but I may ete none other
mete this day / then she spak no more as at that time / for she was loathe to
displease him / Then after souper they spak of one thing and other / with
that came a squire and said / Madame ye must purueye you to morn for a

excepteye can find a knyt that will fyghto to morn in your quarrel against

Sir said she I shall tell you there was here a king that hyghte Anyause which
held all this land in his keeping / So hit myshapped he loved a gentilwoman a
great dele elder than I So took he her all this land to her keeping / and all
his men to govern / and she brought up many euylle custommes where by she
put to death a great party of his kynnesmen / And when he saw that / he
let charce her out of this land / and bytoke hit me / and all this land in
my demenys / but anon as that worthy king was deed / this other lady began
to werre upon me / and has destroyed many of my men / and turned hem ageynste

toure that she left me And yet she has promised me to have this Toure
without I can find a knight to fight with her Champyon / Now tell me said
sir Bors / what is that Prydam le noyre / sire said she / he is the most
doubted man of this land / Now may ye send her word that ye have fond a knight
that shall fight with that Prydam le noyre in gods quarrel and yours / Then
that lady was not a little glad / and sent word that she was purueyed / and
that night Bors had good chere / but in no bed he would come / but leyd him
on the floor / nor never would do otherwise till that he had met with the quest
of the Sancgreal /

ANd anon as he was a sleep / him befelle a vysyon / that there came to him
two birds / the one as white as a swan / and the other was merueyllous blak /
but it was not so great as the other / but in the lykenes of a Raven / then
the white byrd came to him / and said / and thou would give me mete and serve
me / I should give the all the riches of the world / And I shall make the as
fair and as white as I am / So the white byrd departed / and there came the
blak byrd to him and said / and thou wolte serve me to morrow and have me in no
despyte / though I be blak / for wete thou well / that more avails my blaknes
than the others whytnes / and then he departed / and he had another vysyon /
him thought / that he came to a great place which seemed a chapel / and there
he fond a chayer set on the list side which was worm eten / and feeble /
And on the right hand were two flowers like a lylye / and the one would have
benome the others whytnes But a good man departed hem that touched not the
other / and then out of eueryche flower came out many flowers and fruit
great plente / Then him thought the good man said / should not he do great
folly that would let these two flowers perysshe for to socoure the rotten tree
that hit fell not to the earth Sir said he / it seems me that this wood
might not avail Now keep the said the good man that thou never see such
adventure befalle the / Then he awaked and made a sign of the cross in
mids of the forhede / and so rose / and clothed him and there came the lady
of the place / and she salewed him / and he her again / and so went to a
chapel and herd their seruyse And there came a company of knights that the
lady had sent for to lead sir Bors unto bataille / Then asked he his arms
And when he was armed / she prayed him to take a lytyl morsel to dyne / Nay
madame said he / that shall I not do till I have done my bataille by the grace
of god / And so he lept upon his horse / and departed all the knights and men
with him / And as soon as these two ladies met to gyder / She which Bors
should fight for complained her and said madame ye have done me wrong to
bireue me of my lands that king Anyaus gaf me / and full both I am there
should be any bataille / ye shall not chese said the other lady or else your
knight withdraw him / Then there was the cry made which party had the
better of tho two knights that his lady should rejoice all the land / Now
departed the one knight here / and the other there / Then they came to
gyders with such a raundon that they perced their sheldes and their hauberkes
/ and the speres flewe in pyeces / and they wounded either other sore / Then
hurteled they to gyders so that they folle both to the earth / and their horses
betwix their legs / and anon they arose and set hands to their swerdes /
and smote ^chone other upon the hedes that they made great wounds and deep
that the blood went out of her bodies / For there fond sir / Bors gretter
defense in that knight more than he wend / For that Prydam was a passing good
knight / and he wounded sir bors full evil and he him again / but ever this
Prydam held the stoure in like hard / That perceived sire Bors and suffered him
till he was nyghe attaynte / And then he ran upon him more and more / and
the other Went bak for dread of death So in his withdrawynge he fell up right
/ and sire Bors drew his helm so strongly that he rent hit fro his head /
and gafe him great strokes with the flat of his swerd upon the vysage / and
had him yield him or he should slay him / Then he cried him mercy and said
Fair knight for gods love slay me not / and I shall ensure the never to
werre against thy lady / but be alwey toward her / Then Bors let him be /
then the old lady fled with all her knights

So then came Bors to all tho that held lands of his lady / and said he
should destroy hem / but if they did such seruyse unto her as longed to their
lands / So they did their homage and they that would not were chaced out of
their lands / Then befelle that young lady to come to her estate again by
the mighty prowess of sir Bors de ganys So when all the country was well set
in pees / then sire Bors took his leave and departed / and she thanked him
gretely / and would have given him great richesse but he refused hit / Then he
rode all that day till night / and came to an herberowe to a lady which knew
him well enough / and maade of him great Joy / Upon the morn as soon as the
day appiered / Bors departed from thens / and so rode in to a foreste / unto
the hour of mydday / and there bifelle him a merueyllous adventure / So he
met at the departing of the two ways two knights that led lyonel his
brother al naked bounden upon a strong hakney / and his hands bounden to fore
his breast And eueryche of hem held in his hands thorns where with they went
betynge him so sore that the blood trayled down more than in an honderd places
of his body / so that he was al blood to fore and behind / but he said never
a word as he which was great of heart / he suffered all that ever they did to
him as though he had felt none anguysshe / Anon sire Bors dressid him to
rescowe him that was his brother / and so he looked upon the other side of him /
and saw a knight which brought a fair gentylwoman / and would have set her in
the thyckest place of the forest for to have been the more surer out of the way
from hem that sought him / And she which was no thing assured cried with an
high voys Saint mary socoure your maid

And anon she aspyed where sire Bors came riding / And when she came nygh
him / she demed him a knight of the round table / whereof she hoped to have
some comfort / and then she coniured him by the feythe that he ought unto
him in whose seruyse thou art entryd in / and for the feythe ye owe unto the
high order of knyghthode / and for the noble king Arthurs sake that I suppose
that made the knight that thou help me / and suffer me not to be shamed of this
knight / When Bors herd her say thus / he had so much sorrow there he
nyst not what to do / For if I let my brother be in adventure he must be
slain / and that would I not for all the earth / And if I help not the maid /
she is shamed for ever / and also she shall lose her vyrgynyte / the which she
shall never get again / Then lift he up his eyes and said weeping / Fair
sweet lord Ihesu Christ whoos lyege man I am keep Lyonel my brother that these
knights slay him not / and for pity of you / and for Mary sake I shall
socoure this maid /

Capitulum x
Then dressid he him unto the knight / the which had the gentylwoman / and
then he cried sir knight let your hand of that maiden or ye be but deed /
and then he set down the maiden / and was armed at all pyeces sauf he
lacked his spear / Then he dressid his sheld / and drew out his swerd / and
Bors smote him so hard that it went through his shield and haberion on the
lift sholder / and through great strength he beat him down to the earth /
and at the pulling out of Bors spear there he swouned /

Then came Bors to the maid / and said how seems it you of this knight /
ye be delyuerd at this time / Now sir said she I pray you led me there as
this knight had me so shall I do gladly / and took the horse of the wounded
knight and set the gentylwoman upon him / and so brought her as she desired
/ Sir knight said she / ye have better sped than ye wend / for and I had lost
my maydenhede / five honderd men should have dyed for hit / what knight was he
that had you in the forest / by my feithe said she / he is my cosyn / So wot I
never with what engyn the fend enchauffed him / for yesterday he took me from
my fader pryuely / for I nor none of my faders men mystrusted him not / And if
he had had my maydenhede / he should have dyed for the sin and his body
shamed and dishonored for ever / Thus as she stood talking with him there
came twelve knights sekyng after her / and anon she told hem all how Bors
had delyuerd her / then they maad great Joy and besoughte him to come to her
fader a great lord and he should be right welcome / Truly said Bors that may not
be at this time / for I have a great aduentur to do in this country / So he
commanded hem unto god and departed / Then sir Bors rode after Lyonel his
brother by the trace of their horses / thus he rode sekyng a great while /
Then he over took a man clothed in a Relygyous clothing / and rode on a
strong black horse blacker than a bery / and said sire knyte what seek you /
Sire said he I seek my brother that I saw within a while beten with two
knights / A Bors discomforte you not / ne fall in to no wanhope / for I shall
tell you tidings such as they ben / for truly he is deed / Then showed he
him a new slain body lyenge in a busshe / and it seemed him well that it was
the body of Lyonel / and then he made such a sorrow that he fell to the
earth all in a swoune / and lay a great while there / And when he came to him
self / he said Fair brother sith the company of you and me is departed shall
I never have Joy in my heart / and now he which I have take unto my master /
he be my help / And when he had said thus / he took his body lyghtely in his
arms / and put hit upon the arson of his sadel / And then he said to the
man can thou tell me unto sum chapel where that I may burye this body /
Come on said he / here is one fast by / and so long they rood till they saw a
fair Toure / and before it there seemed an old feeble chapel / And then they
alyght both and put him in to a Tomb of marbel

Capitulum xj
NOw leave we him here said the good man / and goo we to our herberowe till to
morrow we will come here again to do him seruyse / Sir said Bors be ye a
priest / ye forscthe said he / then I pray you tell me a dreme that befelle
to me ye last nyt / Say on said he / then he began so much to tell him of
the great byrd in the forest / And after told him of his birds one white /
another black / and of of the rotten tree and of the white flowers / sire I
shall tell you a part now and the other dele to morrow / The white foul
betokens a gentylwoman fair and rich which loved the peramours / and has
loved the long

And if thou warn her love she shall goo dye anon if thou have no pity on
her / that sygnefyeth the great byrd / the which shall make the to warn her
/ Now for no fere that thou have ne for no dread that thou haste of god / thou
shalt not warn her but thou would not do hit for to be holden chaste for to
conquer the boos of the vein glory of the world / for that shall befalle the
now and thou warn her that La^ncelot the good knight thy cosyn shall dye /
And therefore men shall now say yt thou art a man sleer / both of thy brother
sire Lyonel and of thy cosyn sire lancelot du lake / the which thou myghtest
have saved and rescowed easyly / But thou wenest to rescowe a maid which
perteyneth no thing to the Now look thou whether hit had been gretter harm of
thy broders death or else to have suffered her to have lost her maydenhode /
Then asked he him haste thou herd the tokens of thy dreme the which I have
told to you / Ye forsothe said sire Bors / all your exposycyon and declarynge
of my dreme I have well understand and herd / Then said the man in this black
clothing / then is hit in thy defaute if sire Lancelot thy cosyn dye / Sire
said bors that were me loathe / for wete ye well there is no thing in the world
but I had lever do hit than to see my lord sire lancelot du lake to dye in my
defaute

These ye now the one or the other said the good man / And then he led sire
Bors in to an high Toure / and there he fond knights and ladies tho ladies
said he was welcome / and so they unarmed him / And when he was in his
dobblet / men brought him a mantel furred with ermyn and put hit about him
/ and then they made him such chere that he had forgeten all his sorrow
and anguysshe / and only set his heart in these delytes and deyntees / and
took no thought more for his brother sire Lyonel neither of sire Lancelot du
lake his cosyn / And anon came out of a chamber to him the fairest lady that
ever he saw and more rycher bysene than ever he saw Queen Gueneuer or any
other estat Lo said they sire Bors here is the lady unto whom we owe all our
seruyse / and I trow she be the rychest lady and the fairest of all the world
/ and the which loves you best above all other knights / for she will have
no knight but you And when he understood that langage he was abashed / Not
for then she salewed him / and he her / and then they satte down to gyders
and spak of many things / in so much that she besoughte him to be her love /
for she had loved him above all erthely men / and she should make him rycher
than ever was man of his age / when Bors understood her words / he was right
evil at ease / which in no manner would not break chastyte so wist not he how
to ansuer her /

ALlas said she Bors shall ye not do my will / Madame said Bors / there is
no lady in this world whose will I will fulfylle as of this thing / for my
brother lies deed which was slain right late / A Bors said she I have loved
you long for the great beauty I have seen in you / and the great hardynes that
I have herd of you that needs ye must ly^ by me this night / and therefore I
pray you grant it me / Truly said he I shall not do hit in no manner wise /
then she made him such sorrow as though she would have dyed / well Bors said
she unto this have ye brought me nyghe to mine end / And there with she took
him by the hand / and badde him behold her / and ye shall see how I shall dye
for your love / A said then he that shall I never see / Then she departed
and went up in to an hyhe batilment / and led with her twelve gentylwymmen /
and when they were above one of the gentylwymmen cried and said A sir Bors
gentil knight have mercy on us all / and suffer my lady to have her will And if
ye do not we must suffer death with our lady for to fall down of this hyhe
tower / And if ye suffer us thus to dye for so little a thing / all ladies
and gentilwymmen will say of you dishonor / Then looked he upward they
seemed all ladies of great estate and rychely and well bysene / then had he
of hem great pity / not for that he was vncounceiled in him self that lever he
had they all had lost their souls than he his / and with that they fell
adoune all at ones unto the earth / And when he saw that / he was al abashed
/ and had thereof great merueylle / with that he blessed his body and his vysage
/ And anon he herd a great noise and a great cry as though all the fendes of
hell had been about him / and there with he saw neither toure ne lady ne
gentylwoman nor no chapel where he brought his brother to / Then held he up
both his hands to the heaven and said / fair fader god I am grievously escaped
/ and then he took his arms and his horse and rode on his way / Then he
herd a clok smite on his right hand / and thydder he came to an Abbay on his
right hand closyd with hyhe walls / and there was let in / then they
supposed that he was one of the quest of the Sancgreal / So they led him in
to a chamber and unarmed him / Syrs said sir Bors if there be any holy man in
this hows / I pray you let me speak with him / Then one of hem led him
unto the Abbot which was in a Chapel / And then sir Bors salewed him / and
he him again / sir said Bors I am a knight erraunt / and told him all the
adventure which he had seen / Sir knight said the Abbot I wot not what ye be

grace of our lord Ihesu Christ / Not for then ye shall go unto your rest / for
I will not counceyle you this day / hit is to late / and to morrow I shall

ANd that night was sire Bors served rychely / and on the morn erly he herd
mass / and the Abbot came to him / and had him good morrow / and Bors to him
again / And then he told him he was a felawe of the quest of the Sancgreal /
and how he had charge of the holy man to ete bread and water / Then our lord
Ihesus Christ showed him unto you in the lykenes of a soul that suffered great
anguysshe for us syn he was put upon the cross / and bledde his heart blood
for mankind / there was the token and the lykenes of the Sancgreal that
appiered before you / for the blood that the great foul bled reuyued the
chyckens from death to life / And by the bare tree is betokened the world which
is naked and without fruit but if hit come of our lord / Also the lady for
whom ye fought for and king Anyaus which was lord there to fore betokens
Ihesu Christ / which is king of the world / and that he fought with the
champyon for the lady / this hit betokens / for when he took the bataille
for the lady / by her shall ye understand the new law of Ihesu Christ and
holy church / and by the other lady ye shall understand the old law and the
fend which al day werrith against holy church / therefore ye did your bataille
with right For ye be Ihesu Crystes knights / therefore ye ought to be
defenders of holy church / And by the black byrd might ye understand holy
church which says I am blak / but he is fair And by the white byrd might
men understand the fend / and I shall tell you how the swan is white
without forth and blak within / hit is ypocrysy which is without yelowe or
pale / and seems without forth the servants of Ihesu Christ but they ben
within so horrible of fylthe and sin and begyle the world euylle / Also
when the fend appiered to the in lykenes of a man of relygyon and blamyd the
that thou left thy brother / For a lady so led the where thou semyd thy
brother was slain / but he is yet on live / and all was for to put the in
error and bring the unto wanhope and lechery / for he knew thou were tendyr
herted / and all was / for thou sholdest not find the blessid adventure of the
Sancgreal / and the thyrdde foul betokens the strong bataille against the
fair ladies which were all deuyls / Also the dry tree and the white lylye
the dry tree bitokeneth thy brother Lyonel which is dry without virtue / and
therefore many men ought to call him the rotten tree and the worm eten tree /
for he is a murderer and does contrary to the order of knyghthode / And the
two white flowers sygnyfyen two maidens / the one is a knight which was
wounded the other day / and the other is the gentylwoman which ye rescowed and
why the other flower drew nyghe the other / that was the knight which would
have defowled her and him self both / and sir Bors ye had been a great fool
and in great peril for to have seen tho two flowers perysshe for to socoure
the roten tree / for and they had sinned to gyder they had been dampened / and
for that ye rescowed hem both / men might call you a very knight and
servant of Ihesu Christ /

Capitulum xiiij
Then went sir Bors from thens and commanded the Abbot unto god / And
then he rode all that day and herberowed with an old lady / And on the morn
he rode to a Castle in a valey / and there he met with a yoman going a great
paas toward a foreste / Say me said sire Bors can thou tell me of any
adventure / Sire said he / here shall be under this Castle a great and a
merueyllous turnement / of what folks shall hit be said sir Bors / The earl of
playns shall be in the one party / and the ladies neuew of Heruyn on the other
party / the^nne bors thout to be there if he myt mete with his brother sir
Lyonel or any other of his felaushyp / which were in the quest of the
Sancgreal / And then he turned to an hermytage that was in the enter of the
foreste / And when he was come thither / he fond there sir Lyonel his brother
which sat al armed at the enter of the Chapel door for to abide there
herberowe till on the morn that the turnement shall be / And when sir Bors
saw him / he had great Joy of him / that it were merueil to tell of his Joy
/ And then he alyghte of his horse / and said fair sweet brother when came ye
hydder / Anon as Lyonel saw him he said A Bors ye may not make none auaunt /
but as for you I myt have been slain when ye saw two knytes ledyng me awey
betyng me ye left me for to socoure a gentilwoman / and suffered me in peril
of death / for never erst ne did no brother to another so great an untruth /
And for that mysdede now I ensure you but death / for well have ye deserved it /
therefore keep the from hensforward / and that shall ye find as soon as I am
armed / when sir Bors understood his broders wrath / he knelyd down to the
earth / and cried him mercy / holdyng up both his hands and prayed him to
forgive him his evil will / Nay said Lyonel that shall never be and I may
have the hyher hand that I make mine auowe to god / thou shall have death for it
for it were pity ye lived any longer / Right so he went in and took his
harneis and mounted upon his horse / and came to fore him and said / Bors keep
the from me / for I shall do to the as I would to a felon or a traitor / for ye
be the vntruest knight that ever came out of so worthy an hows / as was king
Bors de ganys / which was our fader / therefore starte upon thy horse / and so
shall ye be most at your advantage And but if ye will / I will run upon
you there as ye stand upon foot / and so the shame shall be mine / and the
harm yours / but of that shame ne reke I naught / when sir Bors saw that he
must fight with his brother or else to dye / he nyst what to do / then his
heart counceyled him not thereto in as much as Lyonel was borne or he / wherefore
he ought to bear him reverence / yet kneled he down before Lyonels horse feet /
and said fair sweet brother have mercy upon me / and sle me not / and have in
remembrance the great love which ought to be bitwene us tweyne / what sir
Bors said to Lyonel he roughte not / for the fend had brought him in such a
will that he should slay him / Then when Lyonel saw he would none other / and
that he would not have risen to give him bataille / he rasshed over him so that
he smote Bors with his horse feet upward to the earth / and hurt him so sore
that he swouned of distress / the which he felt in him self to have dyed
without confession / So when Lyonel saw this / he alyghte of his horse to
have smyten of his head / And so he took him by the helm / and would have
rent hit from his heed / Then came the heremyte rennyng unto him which was
a good man and of great age / and well had herd all the words that were
bitwene them / and so folle down upon sire Bors

Capitulum xv
Then he said to Lyonel A gentyl knight have mercy upon me and on thy b^oder
/ for if thou slay him / thou shalt be deed of sin / and that were sorouful
/ for he is one of the worthyest knights of the world / and of the best
condycyons / So god me help said Lyonel sir priest / but if ye flee from him I
shall slay you / and he shall never the sooner be quyte / Certes said the good
man I have lever ye slay me than him / for my death shall not be great harm
not half so much as of his / well said Lyonel I am greed / and set his hand
te his swerd and smote him so hard that his head yede bakward / Not for that
he restrained him of his evil will / but took his brother by the helm and
unlaced hit to have stryken of his head / and had slain him without fail but
so it happed Colgreuaunce a felawe of the round table came at that time thither
as our lords will was / And when he saw the good man slain he merueylled
much what it might be / And then he beheld Lyonel would have slain his
brother / and knew sire Bors which he loved ryt well Then starte he down and
took Lyonel by the sholders and drew him strongly abak from Bors / and said
Lyonel will ye slay your brother the worthyest knight of the world one / and
that should no good man suffer / why said Lyonel / will ye let me / therefore
if ye entermete you in this I shall slay you and him after / why said
Colgreuaunce is this sothe that ye will slay him / slay him will I said he /
who so say the contrary / For he has done so much against me / that he has
well deserved it / and so ran upon him / and would have smyten him through the
head / and sir Colgreuaunce ran betwyx them and said and ye be so hardy to do
so more we two shall meddle to gyders / when Lyonel understood his words / he
took his sheld before him / and asked him what that he was / and he told him
Colgreuaunce one of his felawes / Then Lyonel defied him / and gaf him a
great stroke through the helm / Then he drew his suerd / for he was a
passing good knyte / and defended him ryt manfully / so long dured the batail
that Bors rose up all anguysshly and beheld Colgreuaunce the good knight
fought with his brother for his quarrel / then was he full sorry and heavy / and
thought if Colgreuaunce slay him / that was his brother / he should never have
Joy / And if his brother slew Colgreuau^ce the shame should ever be mine / Then
would he have risen to have departed them / but he had not so much might to
stand on foot / so he abode him so long till Colgreuaunce had the werse /
for Lyonel was of great chyualrye and right hardy / for he had perced the
hauberk and the helm that he abode but death / For he had lost much of his
blood that it was merueylle that he might stand up right / Then beheld he
sir Bors which sat dressynge him upward and said A Bors why come ye not to
cast me out of peril of death wherein I have put me to socoure you which
were right now nyghe the death / Certes said Lyonel that shall not avail you
for none of you shall bear others waraunt / but that ye shall dye both of my
hand / when Bors herd that / he did so much he rose and put on his helm /
Then per^^yued he first the heremyte priest which was slain / then made
he a merueillous sorrow upon him /

Capitulum xvj
Then often Colgreuaunce cried upon sire Bors / why will ye let me dye here
for your sake / if it plese you that I dye for you the death / it will please
me the better for to save a worthy man / with that word sire Lyonel smote of
the helm from his hed^ / Then Colgreuaunce saw that he might not escape /
then he said Fair sweet Ihesu that I have mysdoo have mercy upon my soul /
For such sorrow that my heart suffers for goodenes and for alms deed that I
would have done here / be to me a lygement of penance unto my souls health /
At these words Lyonel smote him so sore that he bare him to the earth / so
when he had slain Colgreuaunce / he ran upon his brother as a fendly man /
and gaf him such a stroke that he made him stoop / and he that was full of
humylyte prayed him for gods love to leave this bataille / For and hit befelle
fair brother that I slew you or ye me / we should be deed of that sin / Never
god me help but if I have on you mercy and I may have the better hand / Then
drew Bors his suerd al weeping and said / Fair brother god knows mine
entente / A fair brother ye have done full euylle this day to slay such an
holy p^^est the which never trespast / Also ye have slain a gentyl knight
and one of our felawes / And well wot ye that I am not a ferd of you gretely /
but I dread the wrath of god / and this is an unkindly werre / therefore god
show miracle upon us both / Now god have mercy upon me / though I defend my
life against my brother / with that Bors lift up his hand / and would have smyten
his brother /

Capitulum xvij
ANd then he herd a voice that said flee bo^s and touch him not / or else
thou shall slay him / Right so alyt a cloud betwixe them in lykenes of a fire
and a merueyllous flamme / that both her two sheltes burnt / Then were they
sore affrayed that they fell both to the earth / and lay there a great while
in a swoune / And when they came to them self Bors saw that his brother had
no harm / then he held up both his hands / for he dradde god had taken
vengeance upon him / with that he herd a voice say Bors go hens and bear thy
brother no longer felaushyp / but take thy way anon right to the sea / For
sire Percyual abides the there / Then he said to his brother fair sweet
brother forgive me for gods love all that I have trespaced unto you / Then
he ansuerd God forgive it the and I do gladly / So sir Bors departed from him
and rode the next way to the sea / And at the last by fortune he came to an
Abbay which was nygh the sea / That night Bors rested him there / and in his
sleep there came a voice to him and badde him go to the sea / then he starte
up and made a sign of the Cross in the mids of his forhede and took his
harneis and made ready his horse / and mounted upon him / And at a broken wall
he rode out / and rode so long till that he came to the sea / And on the
strond he fond a ship couerd all with white samyte / And he alyghte and bitoke

in to the sea and went so fast that him seemed the ship went fleing / but hit
was soon derke so that he might know no man / and so he slepte till hit was
day Then he awaked and saw in mids of the ship a knyt lie all armed sauf
his helm / Then knew he that hit was sir Percyual of walys / and then he
made of him ryt great Joy / but sir Percyual was abashed of him / and he
asked him what he was / A fair sir said Bors know ye me not / Certes said he I
merueylle how ye came hither / but if our lord brought you hydder him self /
then sire Bors smyled and did of his helm / Then Percyual knew him / and
either made great Joy of other that it was merueylle to here /

Then Bors told him how he came in to the ship / and by whoos ammonysshement
/ and either told other of they^^ temptacyons / as ye have herd to fore hand /

So went they douneward in the sea one while bakward another while forward /
and eueryche comforted other / and often were in their prayers / then said
sire Percyual we lak no thing but Galahad the good knight

And thus ends the syxtenth book which is of sire Gawayne / Ector de marys /
and sire Bors de ganys and sir percyual
And here follows the seuententh book which is of the noble knight sire
Galahad /
Capitulum primum
NOw says this story when Galahad had rescowed Percyual from the twenty
knights / he yede tho in to a waste foreste / wherein he rode many Iourneyes /
and he fond many adventures / the which he brought to an end / whereof the
story makes here no mencyon / Then he took his way to the sea on a day /
and hit befelle as he passed by a Castle where was a wonder turnement / but
they without had done so much / that they within were put to the werse /
yet were they within good knights ynou / when Galahad saw that tho with in
were at so great a meschyef that men slew hem at the enter of the Castle /
then he thought to help hem / and put a spear forth / and smote the
first that he flay to the earth / and the spear brak to pyeces / then he
drew his suerd / and smote there as they were thyckest / and so he did
wonderful deeds of arms / that all they merueylled / then hit happed that
Gawayne and sir Ector de marys were with the knights without / But when
they aspyed the white shield with the reed Cross / the one said to the other
yonder is the good knight sir Galahad the haute prince / Now he should be a
great fool / which should mete with him to fight / So by adventure he came
by sire Gawayne and he smote him so hard that he claf his helm and the coyfe
of iron unto his head / so that Gawayn fell to the earth / but the stroke was
so great that it slented down to the earth and ^arfe the horse sholder in two
/ when Ector saw Gawayne down he drew him aside / and thought it no
wisdom for to abide him / and also for naturel love that he was his vnkel /
Thus through his great hardynesse he beat abak all the knights without / And
then they within came out and chaced hem all about / But when Galahad
saw there would none torn again / he stale awey pryuely so that none wist
where he was bicome / Now by my head said Gawayn to Ector now are the wonders
true that were said of Lancelot du lake / that the swerd which stak in the
stone should give me such a buffet yt I would not have it for the best Castle
in this world / and sothely now hit is preued true for never ere had I such a
stroke of man's hand / Sir said Ector me seems your quest is done / and yours
is not done said Gawayn but mine is done I shall seek no ferther / Then
Gawayne was borne in to a Castle and unarmed him / and leyd him in a rich
bed / and a leche fond that he might live / and to be hole within a month /
Thus Gawayne and Ector abode to gyder / For sire Ector would not awey til
Gawayne were hole / and the good knyt Galahad rode so long till he came that
night to the Castle of Carboneck / and hit befelle him thus / that he was
benyghted in an hermytage / So the good man was feign when he saw he was a
knight erraunt / tho when they were at rest / there came a gentilwoman knockyng
at the door / and called Galahad / and so the good man came to the door to wete
what she would / Then she called the heremyte sire Vlfyn I am a gentylwoman
that would speak with the knight which is with you / Then the good man awaked
Galahad / and badde him arise and speak with a gentylwoman that seems has
great need of you / Then Galahad went to her and asked her what she would /
Galahad said she I will that ye arm you and mou^te upon your horse and follow
me / for I shall show you within these three days the highest adventure that
ever any knight saw / Anon Galahad armed him and took his horse and commanded
him to god / and badde the gentilwoman go and he would follow there as she lyked
/

Capitulum ij
So she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her tylle that she came to the sea / the which was called Collybe And at the night they came unto a Castle
in a valeye closed with a rennynge water and with strong walls and hyhe / and
so she entered in to the Castle with Galahad and there had he great chere for
the lady of that Castle was the damoysels lady / so when he was unarmed /
then said the damoysel madame shall we abide here all this day / Nay said
she but tylle he has dyned and till he has slepte a lytyl / so he ete and
slepte a while till that the maid called him / and armed him by torche light /
And when the maid was horsed and he both the lady took Galahad a fair child
and rich / and so they departed from the Castle till they came to the sea side
/ and there they fond the ship where Bors and Percyual were in / the which
cried on the shyps board sir Galahad ye be welcome / we have a^yden you long /
And when he herd them / he asked them what they were / Sir said she leave your
horse here / and I shall leave mine and took her sadels and her brydels with them
and made a cross on them / and so entryd in to the ship / and the two
knights received hem both with great Joy / and eueryche knew other / and
so the wind aroos / and drofe hem through the sea in a merueyllous place / And
within a while it dawyd / Then did Galahad of his helm and his suerd / and
asked of his felawes from whens came that fair ship / Truly said they ye wot
as well as we but of gods grace / and then they told eueryche to other of
all their hard adventures / and of her great temptacyons / truly said Galahad
ye are much bounden to god for ye have escaped great adventures and had not
the gentilwoman ben / I had not comen here / for as for you I wend never to
have fond you in these strange countries / A Galahad said Bors if lancelot
your fader were here / then were we well at ease / for then me seemed we
failed no thing / That may not be said Galahad / but if it pleasyd our lord
/ By then the ship went fro the land of Logrys / and by adventure it
arrived up betwix two roches passing great and merueyllous / but there they
might not land / for there was a swalowe of the sea / sauf there was another
ship / and upon it they might goo without danger / Goo we thither said the
gentylwoman / and there shall we see adventures / for so is our lords will
/ And when they came thither / they fond the ship rich ynou / but they fond
neither man ne woman therein / But they fond in the end of the ship two fair
letters written which said a dredeful word and a merueyllous / Thou man which
shall enter in to this ship beware thou be in steadfast bileue for I am feith
and therefore beware hou thou entrest / for and thou fail I shall not help the /
then said the ge^tilwoman Percyual wot ye what I am / Certes said nay to my
wetynge / wete you well said she that I am thy sister / which am daughter of
king Pellenore / And therefore wete ye well ye are the man in the world that I
most love / And if ye be not in parfyte believe of Ihesu Christ enter not in no
manner of wise / for then should ye perysshe the ship for he is so parfyte /
he will suffer no sinner in him / when Percyual understood that she was his
very sister / he was inwardly glad and said / fair sister I shall enter
therein / For if I be a mys creature or an untrue knight there shall I perysshe

Capitulum Tercium
IN the mean while Galahad blessed him / and entrid therein / and then next
the gentylwoman / and then sir Bors and sir Percyual / And when they were in
/ it was so merueyllous fair and rich that they merueylled / and in mids of
the ship was a fair bed / and Galahad went thereto / and fond there a crown
of sylke / And at the feet was a swerd rich and fair / and hit was drawn
out of the shethe half a foot and more / and the suerd was of diverse facyons
/ and the pomel was of stone / and there was in him all manner of colors that
any man might find / and eueryche of the colors had diverse virtues / and
the skalys of the hafte were of two rybbes of diverse b^estes / the one be
was a serpent which was conuersaunt in Calydone / and is called the serpent of
the fend And the bone of him is of such a virtue that there is no hand that
handeleth him shall never be weary nor hurt / and the other be is a fysshe
which is not right great / and haunteth the flood of Eufrate / and that fysshe
is called Ertanax / and his bones be of such a manner of kind that who that
handeleth hem / shall have so much will that he shall never be weary and he
shall not think on Joy nor sorrow that he has had But only that thing that
he beholds before him / And as for this suerd there shall never man begrype
him at the handels but one / but he shall pass all other / In the name of
god said Percyual I shall assaye to handle hit / So he set his hand to the
suerd / but he might not begrype hit / by my feyth said he now have I failed /
Bors set his hand thereto and failed Then Galahad beheld the suerd and saw
letters like blood that said / let see who shall assaye to draw me out of my
shethe / but if he be more hardyer than any other / and who that draws me /
wete ye well that he shall never fail of shame of his body or to be wounded to
the death / By my feyth said galahad I would draw this suerd out of the shethe
/ but the offendynge is so great that I shall not set my hand thereto Now
sirs said the gentilwoman wete ye well that the drawing of this suerd is warned
to all men sauf al only to you Also this ship aryued in the realm of Logrys /
and that time was dedely werre between king labor which was fader unto the
maimed king and king Hurlame which was a Sarasyn / But then was he newely
crystend / so that men held him afterward one of the wyttyest men of the
world / and so upon a day hit befelle that king Labor and king Hurlame had
assembled their folk upon the sea where this ship was aryued / and there king
Hurlame was discomfyte / and his men slain / and he was aferd to be deed / and
fled to his ship and there fond this suerd and drew hit / and came out and
fond king Labor the man in the world of al crystendom in whom was then the
grettest feythe / And when king Hurlame saw king Labor he dressid this suerd
/ and smote him upon the helm so hard that he clafe him / and his horse to the
earth with the first stroke of his suerd / and hit was in the realm of Logrys
/ and so bifelle great pestylence and great harm to both Realms / for sythen
encrecyd neither corn ne grass nor well nyghe no fruit / ne in the water was
no fysshe werfor men callen hit the lands of the two marches the waste land /
for that dolorous stroke / And when king Hurlame saw this suerd so keruyng /
he t^rned again to fetch the scaubard / And so came in to this ship and
entered / and putt up the suerd in the shethe / And as soon as he had done it /
he fell down deed before the bed / Thus was the swerd preued that none ne
drew it but he were deed or maimed / So lay he there till a maiden came in to
the ship / and cast him out / for there was no man so hardy of the world to
enter in to shypthat for the defense /

Capitulum quartum /
ANd then beheld they the scaubard / hit seemed to be of a serpents skin /
And thereon were letters of gold and silver / and the gyrdel was but pourely to
come to and not able to sustain such a rich suerd / and the letters said /
he which shall welde me ought to be more harder than any other if he bear me
as truly as me ought to be born For the body of him which I ought to hang
by he shall not be shamed in no place while he is gyrd with this gyrdel / nor
never none be so hardy to do awey this gyrdel / for it ought not be done
away but by the hands of a maid / and that she be a kings daughter and
queen's / and she must be a maid all the days of her life / both in will and
in deed / And if she break her vyrgynyte she shall dye the most vylaynous
death that ever did any woman / Sir said Percyual torn this suerd that we may
see what is on the other side / and hit was reed as blood with blak letters as
any cole / which said / he that shall praise me most / most shall he find
me to blame at a great need and to whom I should be most debonair shall I be
most felon / and that shall be at one time / Fair brother said she to Percyual
it befelle after a forty year after the passion of Ihesu Christ that Nacyen thy
brother in law of king Mordrayns was boren in to a Town more than xiiij days
Iourneye from his country by the commandment of our lord in to an isle / in
to the parties of the west that men clepyd the isle of Turnaunce / So befelle
hit that he fond this ship at the enter of a roche / and he fond the bed and
this suerd as we have herd now / Not for then he had not so much hardynesse
to draw hit / and there he dwellid an eight days / and at the nynythe day
there fell a great wind which departed him out of the isle and brought him to
another isle by a roche / and there he fond the grettest gyaunt that ever man
might see / therewith came that horrible gyaunt to slay him / and then he
looked about him aad myghde not flee / and he had no thing to defend him with
/ So he ran to his suerd / and when he saw hit naked / he praised it much
/ and then he shoke it / and there with he brak it in the mids A said Nacyen
the thing that I most praised ought I now most to blame / and there with he
threw the pyeces of his suerd over his bed / And after he lepte over the
board to fight with we gyaunt / and slew him And anon he entryd in to the
ship again / and the wind arose / and drofe him through the sea / that by
adventure he came to another ship where king Mordrayns was / which had been
tempted full evil with a fend in the port of peryllous roche / And when
that one saw the other / they made great Joy of other / and either told other
of their adventure / and how the swerd failed him at his most need / when
Mordrayns saw the suerd he praised hit much / but the brekyng was not to do
/ but by wyckednes of thy self ward / for thou art in sum sin / and there
he took the suerd / and set the pecys to gyders / and they soudered as fair
as ever they were to fore / and there put he the swerd in the shethe / and
leyd it down on the bed / Then herd they a voice that said go out of this
ship a little while / and enter in to the other for dread ye fall in dedely
sin / for and ye be fond in dedely sin ye may not escape but perysshe /
and so they went in to the other ship / And as Nacyen went over the board he
was smyten with a swerd on the right foot that he fell down noselynge to
the shyps board / and there with he said O god how am I hurt / and then there
came a voice and said / take thou that for thy forsette that thou dydest in
drawing of this suerd / therefore thou receyuest a wound / for thou were never
worthy to handel it / the writing makes mencyon / In the name of god said
galahad ye ar ryt wise of these works

Capitulum v
Sir said she there was a king that hyghte Pelles the maimed king / And while
he might ride / he supported much crystendome and holy church / So upon a
day he hunted in a wood of his which lasted unto the sea / and at the last
he lost his hounds / and his knights / sauf only one / and there he and his
knight went till that they came toward Irland / and there he fond the ship /
And when he saw the letters and understood them / yet he entryd / for he was
right parfyte of his life / but his knight had none hardynes to enter and there
fond he this suerd and drew it out as much as ye may see / So there with
entryd a spear where with he was smite him through both the thyes / and never
sithe might he be helyd ne naught shall to fore we come to him / Thus said she
was not king Pelles your grant sir maimed for his hardynesse / In the name
of god damoysel said Galahad / so they went toward the bed to behold al
about hit / and above the head there henge two swerdes / Also there were two
spyndels which were as white as any snow / and other that were as reed as
blood / and other above grene as any emeraude / of these three colors were the
spyndels and of naturel color within and without any payntynge / These
spyndels said the damoysel were when synful Eve came to gadre fruit / for
which Adam and she were put out of paradyse / she took with her the bough
on which the Appel henge on / Then perceived she that the branch was fair
and grene / and she remembryd her the loss which came fro the tree / Then
she thought to keep the branuche as long as she might / And for she had no
cofer to keep hit in / she put it in the earth / So by the will of our lord
the branch grew to a great tree within a lytil while / and was as white as
any snow / branches / bows / and leaves that was a token a maiden planted hit
/ But after god came to Adam and bad him know his wife flesshly as nature
required / So lay Adam with his wife under the same tree / and anon the tree
which was white and full grene as any grass and all that came out of hit /
and in the same time that they meddled to gyders there was Abel begoten / thus
was the tree long of grene color / And so it befelle many days after / under
the same tree Caym slew Abel / whereof befelle great merueil For anon as Abel
had received the death under the grene tree he lost the grene color and becam
reed and that was in tokenyng of the blood / and anon all the plants dyed
thereof / but the tree grew and waxed merueyllously fair / and hit was the
fairest tree and the most delectable that any man might behold and see and so
did the plants that grew out of it tofore that Abel was slain under it / So
long dured the tree till that Salamon king Dauyds sone reigned / and held the
land after his fader / This Salamon was wise and knew all the virtues of
stones and trees / and so he knew the course of the sterres and many other
diverse things This Salamon had an euylle wife / where through he wend that
there had been no good woman / and so he despised hem in his books / So
ansuerd a voice him ones / Salamon / if heaviness come to a man by a woman / ne
reke thou never / For yet shall there come a woman whereof there shall come
gretter Joy to man an honderd times more than this heaviness gives sorrow /
and that woman shall be borne of thy lygnage / Tho when Salamon herd these
words / he held him self but a fool / and the truth he perceived by old
books / Also the holy ghoost showed him the coming of the glorious vyrgyne
marye / Then asked he of the voice / if hit should be in the yerde of his
lygnage / Nay said the voice but there shall come a man which shall be a
maid / and the last of your blood / and he shall be as good a knight as duke
Iosue / thy brother in law

Capitulum vj
NOw have I certefyed the of that thou stodest in doubt / then was Salamon
glad that there should come any such of his lygnage / but ever he merueylled
and studied who that should be / And what his name might be / his wife perceived
that he studied / and thought she would know it at some season / and so she
waited her time / and asked of him the cause of his studyenge / and there he
told her all to gyder how the voice told him / well said she / I shall let
make a ship of the best wood and most durable that men may find / So
Salamon sent for all the Carpenters of the land and the best / And when they
had made the ship / the lady said to Salamon / sir said she / syn hit is so
that this knight out to pass all knights of cheualry which have been to fore
him / and shall come after him / More over I shall tell you said she ye shall
goo in to our lords temple where is king Dauyds suerd your fader / the
which is the merueylloust and the sharpest that ever was taken in any knights
hand / therefore take that / and take of the pomel / and thereto make ye a pomel
of precious stones that it be so subtylly made that no man perceive it / but
that they be al one / and after make there an hylte so merueyllously and
wonderly that no man may know hit / And after make a merueyllous sheth / And
when ye have made all this / I shall let make a gyrdel there to such as
shall please me / All this king Salamon did let make as she devised / both
the ship and all the remenaunt / And when the ship was ready in the sea to
sail / the lady let make a great bed and merueyllous rich / and set her
upon the beds head couerd with sylke / and leyd the suerd at the feet / and
the gyrdels were of hemp / and there with the king was angry / Sir wete ye
well said she that I have none so high a thing which were worthy to sustain
so hyhe a suerd / and a maid shall bring other knights there to / but I wot
not when hit shall be ne what time / and there she let make a covering to
the ship of clothe of sylke that should never rote for no manner of weder / yet
went that lady and maade a Carpenter to come to the tree which Abel was slain
under / Now said she ^arue me out of this tree as much wood as will make me
a spyndyl / A madame said he / this is the tree / the which our first mother
planted / Do hit said she or else I shall destroy the / Anon as he began to
work / there came out drops of blood / and then would he have left / but she
would not suffer him / / and so he took aweye as much wood as myte make a
spyndyl / and so she made him to take as much of the grene tree and of the
white tree / And when these three spyndels were shapen / she made hem to be
fastened upon the selar of the bed / when Salamone saw this / he said to
his wife ye have done merueyllously / for though all the world were here right
now / he could not deuyse wherefore all this was made / but our lord him self /
and thou that have done hit / wotest not what it shall betoken / Now late hit be
said she / for ye shall here tidings sooner than ye wene /

Now shall ye here a wonderful tale of king Salamon and his wife / Capitulum vij
THat night lay Salamon before the ship with little felauship / And when he was
on sleep / him thought / there come from heaven a great company of angels and
alyghte in to the ship and took water which was brought by an angel in a
vessel of silver / and sprente all the ship / And after he came to the suerd
and drew letters on the hylte / And after went to the shyps board / and wrote
there other letters / which said thou man that wylt enter within me / beware
that thou be full within the feythe / for I ne am but feythe and believe / when
Salamon aspyed these letters he was abashed / so that he durst not enter /
and so drew him abak / and the ship was anon shouen in the sea / and he
went so fast that he lost syghte of him within a lytyl while / And then a
lytyl voice said / Salamon / the last knight of thy lygnage shall rest in
this bed / Then went Salamon and awaked his wife / and told her of the
adventures of the ship /

Now says thystory that a great while the three felawes biheld the bed / and
the three spyndels / than they were at certain that they were of naturel
colors without payntynge / Then they left up a clothe which was above the
ground and there fond a rich purse by semynge / and Percyual took hit / And
fond therein a writ / and so he read hit / and devised the manner of the
spyndels and of the ship whens hit came / and by whom it was made / Now said
Galahad where shall we find the gentylwoman / that shall make new gyrdels to
the suerd / Fair sire said Percyuals sister / desmaye you not / For by the leave
of god I shall let make a gyrdel to the suerd such one as shall long thereto
/ And then she opend a box and took out gyrdels which were semely wroughte
with golden thredys / and upon that were set full precious stones and a rich
buckel of gold / lo lords said she / here is a gyrdel that ought to be set
about the suerd / And wete ye well the grettest part of this gyrdle was made
of my here which I loved well while that I was a woman of the world / But as
soon as I wist that this adventure was ordained me I clypped of my here / and
made this gyrdel in the name of god / ye be well y fond said sir Bors / for
certes ye have put us out of great pain wherein we should have entryd ne had
your tidings ben / Then went the gentilwoman and set hit on the gyrdel of
the suerd / Now said the felauship what is the name of the suerd / and what
shall we call hit / Truly said she the name of the suerd is the suerd with
the strange gyrdels and the shethe meuer of blood / for no man that has
blood in him ne shall never see the one party of the shethe which was made of
the tree of life / Then they said to Galahad In the name of Ihesu Christ / and
pray you that ye gyrd you with this suerd which has been desired so much in
the Realm of Logrys / Now let me begin said Galahad to grype this swerd for
to give you courage / But wete ye well hit longs no more to me than it does to
you / And then he gryped about hit with his fyngers a great dele / And
then she gyrte him about the myddel with the swerd / Now rek I not though I
dye / for now I hold me one of the blessid maidens of the world which has
made the worthyest knight of the world / Damoysel said Galahad ye have done so
much that I shall be your knight all the days of my life / Then they
went from that ship / and went to the other / And anon the wind droofe hem
in to the sea a great paas but they had no vytaille / but hit befelle that they
came on the morn to a Castle that men call Carteboyse / that was in the
marches of Scotland And when they had passed the port / the gentilwoman said
lords here be men aryuen that and they wyste that ye were of king Arthurs
court / ye should be assailed anon / Damoysell said Galahad he that cast us
out of the Roche shall deliver us from hem

Capitulum Octauum
So hit befelle as they spoken thus / there came a squire by them / and asked
what they were / and they said they were of king Arthurs hows / is that sothe
said he / Now by my head said he ye be ylle arrayed / and then turned he ageyn
unto the clyff fortress / And within a while they herd an horn blow / Then
a gentylwoman came to hem and asked hem of whens they were / and they told her
/ Fair lords said she for gods love torn again if ye may / for ye be come
unto your death / Nay they said we will not torn again / for he shall
help us in whose seruyse we ben entered in / Then as they stood talking /
there came knights well armed and bad hem yield them or else to dye / that
yeldyng said they shall be noyous to you / and there with they let their horses
run / and sir Percyual smote the formest to the earth / and took his horse /
and mounted thereupon / and the same did Galahad / Also Bors served another so
for they had no horses in that country / for they left their horses when they
took their ship in other countrayes / And so when they were horsed / then
began they to set upon them / and they of the Castle fled in to the strong
fortress / and the three knights after them in to the Castle / and so alyghte
on foot / and with their swerdes slew them down and gate in to the halle /
Then when they beheld the great multitude of people / that they had slain /
they held them self great sinners / Certes said Bors / I wene and god had loved
hem that we should not have had power to have slain hem thus / But they have
done so much ageyn our lord that he would not suffer hem to regne no longer /
Say ye not so said Galahad / for if they mysdyd against god / the vengeance
is not ours / but to him which has power thereof / So came there out of a
chamber a good man which was a priest and bare gods body in a coupe / And
when he saw hem which lay deed in the halle / he was all abashed / and
Galahad did of his helm and kneled down / and so did his two felawes / sire
said they have ye no dread of us / For we ben of king Arthurs court / Then
asked the good man how they were slain so suddenly / and they told it him Truly
said the good man and ye might live as long as the world might endure / ne
might ye have done so great an alms deed as this / Sire said Galahad I
repent me much in as much as they were crystened / Nay repent you not said
he for they were not crystened / and I shall tell you hou that I wot of this
Castle / here was lord Earl Hernox not but one year / and he had three sons
good knights of arms and a daughter the fairest gentylwoman that men knew /
so tho three knights loved their sister so sore that they burnt in love / and
so they lay by her maulgre her head / And for she cried to her fader / they
slew her and took their fader / and put him in prison / and wounded him nygh
to the death / but a cosyn of hers rescowed him / And then did they great
untruth / they slew clerks and priests / and made beat down chapels that
our lords seruyse might not be served ne said / and this same day her fader
sent to me for to be confessid and houseld / but such shame had never man as
I had this day with the three brethren / but the earl badde me suffer / for he
said they should not long endure / for three servants of our lord should
destroy them / and now hit is brought to an end / And by this may ye wete
that our lord is not displeased with your deeds Certes said Galahad and hit had
not pleasyd our lord / never should we have slain so many men in so lytyl a
while / and then they brought the earl Hernox out of prison in to the
mids of the halle that knew Galahad anon / and yet he saw him never before
but by reuelacyon of our lord

/ but for gods love holds me in your arms that my soul may depart out
of my body in so good a man's arms as ye be / Gladly said Galahad / And then
one said on high that all herd / Galahad / well have thou avenged me on
gods enemies / Now behooves the to goo to the maimed king as soon as thou
may / for he shall receive by the health which he has abyden so long /
and there with the soul departed from the body / and Galahad made him to be
buried as him ought to be / Right so departed the three knights and Percyuals
sister with them / And so they came in to a waste foreste / and there they
saw before them a white heart which four lions ladde / Then they took hem to
assent for to follow after / for to know whydder they repaired and so they
rode after a great paas til that they came to a valeye / and there by was an
hermytage where a good man dwellid and the heart and the lions entryd also /
so when they saw all this / they turned to the chapel / and saw the good
man in a relygyous wede and in the armor of our lord / for he would sing mass
of the holy ghoost / and so they entryd in and herd mass / And at the
secretys of the mass / they three saw the heart become a man / the which
merueyled hem and set him upon the altar / in a rich sege / and saw the
four lions were changed / the one to the form of a man / the other to the
form of a lion / and the third to an Egle / and the fourth was changed unto
an ox / then took they her sege / where the heart sat / and went out
through a glass wyndowe / and there was no thing perysshed nor broken / and they
herd a voice say in such a manner entered the sone of god in the womb of a maid
mary / whose vyrgynyte ne was perysshed ne hurt / and when they herd these
words they fell down to the earth / and were astonyed / and there with was a
great clerenes / And when they were come to their self ageyn they went to
the good man and prayed him that he would say hem truth / what thing have ye
seen said he / and they told him all that they had seen / A lords said he ye
be welcome / now wot I well ye be the good knights / the which shall bring
the Sancgreal to an end / For ye ben they unto whom our lord shall show
great secrets / and well ought our lord be sygnefyed to an heart / For the
heart when he is old / he waxes young again in his white skin / Right so
comes again our lord from death to life / for he lost erthely flesh that
was the dedely flesh / which he had taken in the womb of the blessid vyrgyn
mary / and for that cause appiered our lord as a white heart without spot /
and the four that were with him is to understand the four euuangelystes
which set in writing a part of Ihesu Crystes deeds that he did sometime
when he was among you an erthely man / for wete ye well never erst ne might no
knight know the truth / for oftymes or this our lord showed him unto good
men and unto good knights in lykenes of an heart / But I suppose from hens
forth ye shall see no more / and then they Ioyed much / and dwelled there
all that day / And upon the morrow when they had herd mass / they departed
and commanded the good man to god and so they came to a Castle and passed by
/ So there came a knight armed after them and said lords herke what I shall
say to you

Capitulum x
THis gentylwoman that ye led with you is a maid / Sir said she / a maid I
am / Then he took her by the brydel / and said by the holy cross ye shall
not escape me to fore ye have yolden the customme of this Castle / let her go
said Percyual ye be not wise / for a maid in what place she comes is free /
So in the mean while there came out a ten or twelve knights armed out of
the Castle / and with hem came gentylwymmen which held a dysshe of silver /
and then they said this gentylwoman must yield us the customme of this Castle
/ sir said a knight / what maid passes here by shall give this dysshe full
of blood of her right arm / blame have he said Galahad that brought up such
custommes / and so god me save I ensure you of this gentylwoman ye shall fail
while that I live / So god me help said Percyual I had lever be slain / and I
also said sir Bors By my truth said the knight / then shall ye dye / for
ye may not endure ageynste us / though ye were the best knights of the world
/ then let they run each to other / and the three felawes beat the ten
knights / and then set their hands to their swerdes and beat them down
and slew them / Then there came out of the Castle a three score knights
armed / Fair lords said the three felawes have mercy on your self and have
not adoo with us / Nay fair lords said the knights of the Castle we counceyl
you to withdraw you / for ye ben the best knights of the world / and therefore
do no more for ye have done enough / We will let you go with this harm but
we must needs have the customme / Certes said Galahad for naught speak ye / well
said they / will ye dye / we be not yet come thereto said Galahad / then
began they to meddle to gyders / and Galahad with the strange gyrdels drew
his suerd / and smote on the right hand and on the lift hand and slew what
that ever abode him / and did such merueils that there was none that saw him
/ they wend he had been none erthely man but a monstre / and his two felawes
halp him passing well / and so they held the Journey eueryche in like hard till
it was nyt / then must they needs depart / So came in a good knight / and
said to the three felawes / if ye will come in to night / and take such
herberowe as here is / ye shall be right welcome / and we shall ensure you by
the feyth of our bodies / and as we be true knights to leave you in such estat
to morrow as we find you without any falshede / And as soon as ye know of
the custom we dare say ye will accord therefore for gods love said the
gentylwoman goo thither and spare not for me / Go we said Galahad / and so they
entryd in to the chapel / And when they were alyghte / they made great Joy of
hem / So within a while the three knights asked the customme of the Castle and
wherefor it was / what hit is said they we will say you ^othe /

Capitulum xj /
There is in this Castle a gentylwoman which we and this castle is hers and
many other / So it befelle many years agone there fylle upon her a maladye /
And when she had layne a great while she fell unto a mesel / and of no leche
she could have no remedy / But at the last an old man said and she might have a
dysshe full of blood of a maid and a clean vyrgyn in will and in work / And a
kings daughter / that blood should be her hele / and for to anoynte her with
all / and for this thing was this customme made

Now said Percyuals sister fair knytes I see well yt this gentylwoman is but
deed / Certes said Galahad and ye blede so much ye may dye / Truly said she
/ and I dye for to hele her / I shall get me great worship and sowles health /
and worship to my lygnage / and better is one harm than tweyn And therefore there
shall be no more batail but to morn I shall yield you your customme of this
castle / and then there was great Joy more than there was to fore / For else
had there ben mortal werre upon the morn / not withstandyng she would none
other whether they would or nold / that night were the three felawes easyd with
the best / and on the morn they herd mass / and sir Percyuals sister bad
bring forth the seek lady / so she was / the which was euylle at ease /
then said she who shall let me blood / So one came forth and let her blood
/ and she bled so much / that the dysshe was full / then she lift up her
hand and blessid her / And then she said to the lady / Madame I am come to
the death for to make you hole / for gods love prays for me / with that she
fell in a swoune / Then Galahad and his two felawes starte up to her and
lift her up and staunched her but she had bled so much that she might not
live / Then she said when she was awaked fair brother Percyual I dye for the
helynge of this lady / So I require you that ye berye me not in this country
/ but as soon as I am deed / put me in a ^ote at the next haven / and let me
goo as adventure will led me / And as soon as ye three come to the Cite of
Sarras there to encheue the holy graile ye shall find me under a Tower arrived
/ and there bery me in the spyrytual place / for I say you so much there
Galahad shall be buried and ye also in the same place / Then Percyual
understood these words and granted it her weeping / And then said a voice
lords and felawes to morrow at the hour of pryme ye three shall depart
eueryche from other / till the adventure bring you to the maimed king / Then
asked she her saueour / and as soon as she had received hit / the soul
departed from the body / So the same day was the lady helyd when she was
enoynted with all / Then sir Percyuale made a letter of all that she had
helped hem as in strange adventures / and put hit in her right hand and so
leyd her in a barge / and couerd it with blak sylke / and so the wind aroos /
and drofe the barge from the land and all knights beheld hit / till it was
out of their syghte / Then they drew all to the Castle / and so forth
with there fell a sodeyne tempest and a thonder layte and rain as all the
earth would have broken / So half the castle turned up so down / So it
passed euensonge or the tempest was seaced / Then they saw before hem a
knight armed and wounded hard in the body and in the head that said O god
socoure me for now it is need / After this knight came another knight / and a
dwerf which cried to hem after / stand ye may not escape / Then the wounded
knight held up his hands to god that he should not dye in such trybulacyon /
Truly said Galahad I shall socoure him for his sake that he calls upon / Sir
said Bors I shall do hit / for it is not for you / for he is but one knight
/ Sir said he I grant / So sir Bors took his horse and commanded him to god /
and rode after to rescowe the wounded knight

Now torn we to the tw^ felawes / Capitulum xij
NOw says the story that al night Galahad and Percyual were in a chapel in
her prayers for to save sir Bors / So on the morrow they dressid hem in their
harneis toward the Castle to wete whatwas fallen of them there in / And when
they came there / they fond neither man ne woman that he ne was deed by the
vengeance of our lord / with that they herd a voice that said / this
vengeance is for blood shedynge of maidens / Also they fond at end of the
chapel a Church yerd / and therein might they see a three score fair tombs /
and that place was so fair and so delectable that it seemed hem there had been
none tempest / For there lay the bodies of all the good maidens which were
martred for the seek ladies sake / Also they fond the names of eueryche / and
of what blood they were come / and all were of kings blood and twelve of them
were kings daughters / Then they departed and went in to a foreste / Now
said Percyual unto Galahad we must depart / so pray we our lord that we may
mete to gyders in short time / then they did of their helmes and kyssed to
gyder / and wept at their departing

Capitulum xiij
NOw says the history that when lancelot was come to the water of Mortoyse as
hit is reherced before / he was in great peril / and so he leyd him down
and slepte / and took the adventure that god would send him /

So when he was a sleep / there came a vysyon unto him and said Lancelot
arise up and take thyn armor / and enter in to the first ship that thou shall
find / And when he herd these words he starte up and saw great clerenes
about him / And then he lift up his hand and blessid him and so took his
arms and made him ready / and so by adventure he came by a stronde / and fond
a ship the which was without sail or ore / And as soon as he was within the
ship there he felt the most swetnes that ever he felt / and he was fulfilled
with all thing that he thought on or desired / Then he said Fair sweet
fader Ihesu Christ I wot not in what Joy I am For this Joy passes all
erthely Joys that ever I was in And so in this joy he leyd him down to the
shyps board / and slepte till day / And when he awoke / he fond there a fair
bed and therein lyenge a gentylwoman deed / the which was sir percyuals sister
/ And as lancelot devised her / he aspyed in her right hand a writ / the
which he read / the which told him all the adventures that ye have herd to
fore / and of what lygnage she was come / So with this gentylwoman sir
lancelot was a month and more / if ye would ask how be lived / he that fed
the people of Israel with manna in deserte / so was he fed / For every day
when he had said his prayers / he was sustained with the grace of the holy
ghoost / So on a night he went to play him by the water side / for he was
somewhat weary of the ship / And then he lystned and herd an horse come / And
one riding upon him / And when he came nygh he seemed a knight / And so he
let him pass / and went there as the ship was / and there he alyghte / and
took the sadel and the brydel and put the horse from him / and went in to the
ship / And then Lancelot dressid unto him and said ye be welcome / and he
ansuerd and salewed him again / and asked him what is your name / for much my
heart gives unto you / Truly said he my name is lancelot du lake / sir said
he / then be ye welcome / for ye were the begynner of me in this world / A
said he ar ye Galahad / ye forsothe said he / and so he kneled down and asked
him his blessing / and after took of his helm and kyssed him / And there was
great Joy bitwene them / for there is no tongue can tell the Joy that they
made either of other / and many a frendely word spoken bitwene / as kind would
/ the which is no need here to be reherced / And there eueryche told other of
their adventures and merueils that were befallen to them in many Iourneyes
sithe that they departed from the court / Anon as Galahad saw the
gentilwoman deed in the bed / he knew her well enough / and told great worship
of her that she was the best maid living and hit was great pity of her d^the /
But when Lancelot herd how the merueylous swerd was gotten / and who made hit
/ and all the merueyls reherced before / Then he prayed galahad his sone that
he would show him the suerd / and so he did / and anon he kyssed the pomel and
the hyltes and the scaubard / Truly said lancelot never erst knew I of so
hyhe adventures done and so merueyllous and strange / So dwellid Lancelot and
Galahad within that ship half a year / and served god daily and nyghtly with
all their power / and of ten they aryued in yles far from folk / where
there repaired none but wild beestes / and there they fond many strange
adventures and peryllous which they brought to an end / but for tho
adventures were with wild beestes / and not in the quest of the Sancgreal /
therefore the tale makes here no mencyon thereof / for it would be to long to
tell of all tho adventures that befelle them

Capitulum xiiij
So after on a mondaye hit befelle that they aryued in the edge of a foreste
to fore a cross / and then saw they a knight armed al in white and was
rychely horsed / and led in his right hand a white horse / and so he came to
the ship and salewed the two knights on the high lords behalf / and said
Galahad sir ye have been long enough with your fader / come out of the ship /
and starte upon this horse / and goo where the adventures shall led the in the
quest of the sancgreal / then he went to his fader and kyst him swetely and
said / Fair sweet fader I wot not when I shall see you more till I see the body
of Ihesu Christ / I pray you said lancelot pray ye to the high fader that he
hold me in his seruyse and so he took his horse / and there they herd a voice
that said think for to do well / for the one shall never see the other before
the dredeful day of dome / Now sone galahad said lau^celot syn we shall depart
/ and never see other / I pray to ye hy fader to conserve me and you both /
Sire said Galahad no prayer auaylleth so much as yours / And there with
Galahad entryd in to the foreste / And the wind aroos and drofe Lancelot more
than a month through out the sea where he slepte but lytyl but prayed to god
that he might see some tidings of the Sancgreal / So hit befelle on a night
at mydnyghte he aryued before a Castle on the bak side which was rich and
fair / and there was a posterne opened toward the sea / and was open without
any keeping / sauf two lions kept the enter / and the moon shone clear / Anon
sir lancelot herd a voice that said Lancelot goo out of this ship / and
enter in to the Castle / where thou shall see a great part of thy desire /
Then he ran to his arms and so armed him / and so went to the gate and
saw the lions / Then set he hand to his suerd and drew hit / Then there
came a dwerf suddenly and smote him on the harm so sore that the suerd fell
out of his hand / Then herd he a voice say O man of euylle feyth and pour
believe wherefore trowest thou more on thy harneis than in thy maker / for he
might more avail the than thyn armor in whose seruyse that thou art set /
Then said lancelot / fay u fader ihesu Christ I thank the of thy great
mercy that thou repreuest me of my mysdede / Now see I well that ye hold me for
your servant / then took he again his suerd and put ^it up in his shethe
and made a cross in his forhede / and came to the lions / and they made
semblaunt to do him harm / Notwithstanding he passed by hem without hurt
and entryd in to the castle to the chyef fortress / and there were they al at
rest / then Lancelot entryd in so armed / for he fond no gate nor door but
it was open / And at the last he fond a chamber whereof the door was shytte /
and he set his hand thereto to have opened hit / but he might not

Capitulum xv
Then he enforced him mykel to undo the door / then he lystned and herd a
voice which sange so swetely that it seemed none erthely thing / and him
thought the voice said Joy and honor be to the fader of heaven / Then
Lancelot kneled down to fore the chamber / for well wist he that there was the
Sancgreal within that chamber / Then said he Fair sweet fader Ihesu Christ if
ever I did thing that pleasyd the lord / for thy pity ne have me not in despyte
for my sins done before time / and that thou show me some thing of that I
seek / And with that he saw the chamber door open and there came out a great
clerenes / that the hows was as bryghte as all the torches of the world had been
there / So came he to the chamber door / and would have entryd / And anon a
voice said to him / Flee lancelot / and enter not / for thou ought not to
do hit / And if thou enter / thou shall forthynke hit / Then he withdrewe
him abak right heavy / Then looked he up in the mids of the chamber / and
saw a table of silver and the holy vessel couerd with reed samyte / and many
angels about hit / whereof one held a candel of wax brennyng and the other
held a cross and the ornementys of an altar And before the holy vessel he
saw a good man clothed as a priest / And it seemed that he was at the sacrynge
of the mass And it seemed to Lancelot that above the priests hands were three
men whereof the two put the youngest by lykenes bitwene the priests hands /
and so he lift hit up right hyhe / and it seemed to show so to the people /
And then lancelot merueyled not a lytyl / For him thout the priest was so
gretely charged of the figure that him seemed that he should fall to the earth /
And when he saw none about him that would help him / Then came he to the
door a great paas and said / Fair fader Ihesu Christ ne take hit for no sin
though I help the good man which has great need of help / Right so entryd
he in to the chamber and came toward the table of silver / and when he came
nyghe he felt a brethe that him thought hit was entremedled with fire which
smote him so sore in the vysage that him thought it burnt his vysage / and
there with he fell to the earth and had no power to arise / as he that was so
araged that had lost the power of his body and his herynge and his seeing

Then felt he many hands about him which took him up / and bare him out
of the chamber door / without any amendynge of his swoune / and left him
there semyng deed to of the chamber door and left him there semynge deed to al
people / So upon the morrow when it was fair day they within were arysen / and
fond Lancelot lyenge before the chamber door / All they merueylled how that
he came in / and so they looked upon him and felt his pouse to wit whether
there were any life in him / and so they fond life in him / but he might not
stand nor stere no membre that he had / and so they took him by every part
of the body / and bare him in to a chamber and leyd him in a rich bed far
from all folk / and so he lay four days / Then the one said he was on
live / and the other said Nay / In the name of god said an old man / for I do
you verily to wete / he is not deed / but he is so fulle of life as the
myghtyest of you all / and therefore I counceylle you that he be well kept till
god send him life again /

Capitulum xvj
IN such manner they kept lancelot four and twenty days and also many
nyghtes that ever he lay stylle as a deed man / and at the xxv day byfelle
him after myddaye that he opened his eyes / And when he saw folk he made
great sorrow and said why have ye awaked me / for I was more at ease than I am
now / O Ihesu Christ who might be so blessid that might see openly thy great
merueyls of secretenes there where no synnar may be / what have ye seen said
they about him / I have seen said he so great merueyls that no tongue may tell
/ and more than any heart can think / and had not my sone ben here before me I
had seen much more / Then they told him how he had layne there four and
twenty days and nyghtes / then him thought hit was punysshement for the
four and twenty years that he had been a sinner wherefore our lord put him in
penance four and twenty days and nyghtes Then looked sir lancelot before him
/ and saw the hair which he had borne nyghe a year / for that he forthoughte
him ryte much that he had broken his promise unto the heremyte which he had
auowed to do / Then they asked how hit stood with him / for sothe said he I
am hole of body thanked be our lord / therefore syrs for gods love tell me
where that I am / then said they all that he was in the Castle of Carbonek /
there with came a gentylwoman / and brought him a sherte of small lynen clothe /
but he changed not there / but took the hair to him again / Sir said they
the quest of the Sancgreal is encheued now right in you / that never shall ye
see of the Sancgreal no more than ye have seen / Now I thank god said Lancelot
of his great mercy of that I have seen / for it suffyseth me / for as I suppose
no man in this world has lived better than I have done to enchere that I have
done / And there with he took the hair and clothed him in hit / and above that
he put a lynen sherte / and after a Robe of Scarlet fresshe and new / And
when he was so arrayed / they merueylled all / for they knew him that he
was lancelot the good knight And then they said all O my lord sir
lancelot be that ye and he said Truly I am he / Then came word to king
pelles that the knight that had layne so long deed was sir lancelot / then
was the king right glad / and went to see him / And when lancelot saw him
come / he dressid him ageynste him / and there made the king great Joy of him
/ and there the king told him tidings / that his fair daughter was deed /
Then lancelot was right heavy of hit / and said / sire me forthynketh of the
death of your daughter / for she was a full fair lady / fresshe / and young /
and well I wot she bear the best knight that is now on earth or that ever was
since god was borne / So the king held him there four days / and on the morrow
he took his leave at king Pelles and at all the felauship and thanked them of
the great labor / Right so as they sat at her dinner in the chyef sale /
then was so befalle that the Sancgreal had fulfilled the tables with all manner
of metes that any heart might think /

So as they sat / they saw all the doors and the wyndowes of the place were
shitte without mannys hand / whereof they were al abashed / and none wyste
what to do

And then it happed suddenly a knight came to the chyefe door and knocked /
and cried / undo the door / but they would not / and ever he cried undo / but
they would not / And at last it noyed hem so much that the king him self
arose and came to a wyndowe there where the knight called / Then he said sir
knight ye shall not enter at this time while the sancgreal is here / and
therefore goo in to another / For certes ye he none of the knytes of the quest /
but one of them which has served the fond / and have left the seruyse of
our lord / and he was passing wroth at the kings words / Sir knight said
the king syn ye would so fayn enter / say me of what country ye be / Sir said
he I am of the Realm of Logrys / and my name is Ector de marys / and brother
unto my lord sir lau^celot / In the name of god said the king / me forthynketh
of that I have said for your brother is here within / and when Ector de marys
understood that his brother was there / for he was the man in the world that he
most dredde and loved / And then he said A god now doubleth my sorrow and
shame / full truly said the good man of the hylle unto Gawayne and to me of our
dremes / Then went he out of the court as sast as his horse might / and
so through out the Castle

Capitulum xvij
Then king Pelles came to sire Lancelot and told him tidings of his brother
whereof he was sorry that he wyste not what to do / So sir lancelot departed
and took his arms and said he would goo see the realm of Logrys / which I
have not seen in a twelve month / and there with commanded the king to god /
and so rode through many realms / And at the last he came to a white Abbay /
And there they made him that night great chere / And on the morn he aroos and
herd mass / and before an altar he fond a rich Tomb which was newely made /
And then he took bid / and saw the sides written with gold / which said
Here lies king Bagdemagus of Gore which king Arthurs neuew slew and named
him sir Gawayn / Then was not he a little so^y / for lancelot loved him much
more than any other and had it ben any other than Gawayn he should not have
escared from death to life / and said to him self A lord god this is a great
heart unto king Arthurs court the loss of such a man / And then he
departed / and came to the Abbay where Galahad did the adventure of the tombs
/ and ^anne the white sheld with the reed cross / and the^e had he great chere
all that night / and on the morn he turned unto Camelot / where he fond
king Arthur and the queen / But many of the knights of the round table were
slain and destroyed more than half / and so three were come home / Ector
Gawayn and Lyonel and many other that neden not to be reherced / and all the
Court was passing glad of sir lancelot / and the king asked him many
tidings of his sone Galahad / and there Lancelot told the king of his
adventures that had befallen him syn he departed / and also he told him of the
adventures of Galahad Percyuale and Bors which that he knew by the letter of
the deed damoysel / And as Galahad had told him Now god would said the king
that they were all three here / that shall never be said lancelot / for two of
hem shall ye never see but one of hem shall come again /

Now leave we this story and speak of Galahad Capitulum xviij
NOw says the story Galahad rode many Iourneyes invayne / And at the last he
came to the Abbay where king Mordrayns was / And when he herd that he thoute he
would abide to see him / And upon the morn when he had herd mass Galahad
came unto king Mordrayns / And anon the king saw him the which had leyne
blind of long time And then he dressid him against him / and said Galahad the
servant of Ihesu christ whose coming I have abyden so long / Now enbrace me
and let me rest on thy breast / So that I may rest bitwene thyn arms / for
thou art a clean vyrgyn above all knights as the flower of the lyly / in
whom vyrgynyte is sygnefyed / and thou art the rose the which is the flower
of al good virtue / and in color of fire / For the fire of the holy ghoost is
take so in the / that my flesh which was al deed of oldenes / is become young
again / Then Galahad herd his words then he enbraced him and all his
body / Then said he / Fair lord Ihesu Christ now I have my will Now I require
the in this point that I am in thou come and vysyte me / And anon our lord
herd his prayer / there with the soul departed from the body / And then
Galahad put him in the earth as a king ought to be / and so departede /
and so came in to a perilous foreste where he fond the well / the which
boy^ed with great wawes as the tale tells to fore / And as soon as Galahad
set his hand thereto it sea^^d / so that it burnt no more / and the hete
departed / for that it burnt hit was a sign of lechery the which was that
time much used / but that hete might not abide his pure vyrgynyte / and this
was taken in the country for a myrakle / And so ever after was it called
Callahadys well / Then by adventure he came in to the country of Gore and in
to the Abbay where lancelot had been to fore hand and fond the tomb of king
Bagdemagus / but he was founder thereof Joseph of Armathyes sone and the Tomb
of Symyan where lancelot had failed Then he looked in to a Crofte under the
mynster / and there he saw a Tomb which brent full merueyllously / Then
asked he the brethren what it was / Sir said they a merueyllous aduentur /
that may not be brought unto none end / but by him that passes of bounte and
of knyghthode al them of the round table / I would said Galahad that ye would
led me there to / Gladly said they / and so led him till a cave / and he went
down upon gresys / and came nyghe the tomb / and then the flammynge failed
and the fire staunched the which many a day had been great / Then came there
a voice that said much are ye behold to thank our lord / the which has

to put them in to the Joys of paradys / I am of your kynred the which have
dwelled in this hete this three honderd winter and four and fyfty to be purged
of the sin that I did against Joseph of Armathye / then Galahad took the
body in his arms and bare it in to the mynster And that night lay Galahad in
the Abbay / and on the morn he gaf him seruyse and put him in the earth
before the high Altar

Capitulum xix
So departed he from thens / and commanded the brethren to god / and so he
rode five days till that he came to the maimed king / And ever followed
Percyual the five days asking where he had been / and so one told him / how
the adventures of Logrys were encheued / So on a day it bifelle that they came
out of a great foreste / and there they met at trauers with sir Bors the
which rode alone / hit is none need to tell if they were glad / and hem he
salewed / and they yielded him honor and good adventure / and eueryche told
other / Then said Bors hit is more than a year and an half that I ne lay ten
times where men dwelled / but in wild forestes and in montayns / but god was
ever my comfort / Then rode they a great while till that they came to the
castle of Carbonek / And when they were entryd within the Castle king Pelles
knew hem / then there was great Joy / For they wist well by their coming
that they had fulfilled the quest of the Sancgreal / Then Elyazar king
Pelles sone brought to fore hem the broken suerd where with Joseph was stryken
through the thygh / Then Bors set his hand thereto / if that he might have
souded hit again but it would not be / Then he took it to Percyual but he had
no more power there to than he / Now have ye hit again said Percyuall to
Galahad / for and it be ever encheued by any bodily man / ye must do hit / and
then he took the pyeces and set hem to gyders and they seemed that they had
never ben broken / and as well as hit had been first forged / And when they
within aspyed that the adventure of the suerd was enchened / then they gaf
the suerd to Bors / for hit might not be better / set / for he was a good
knight and a worthy man / and a little before even the suerd arose great and
merueyllous / and Was full of great hete that many men fell for dread / And
anon alyght a voys among them and said they that ought not to sytte at the
table of Ihesu Christ / arise / for now shall very knights ben fed / So
they went thens all sauf king Pelles and Elyazar his sone / the which were
holy men and a maid which was his nece / and so these three felawes and they
three were there no mo / Anon they saw knights al armed came in at the halle
door and did of their helmes and their arms and said unto Galahad / Sire we
have hyed right much for to be with you at this table where the holy mete
shall be departed Then said he ye be welcome / but of whens be ye / So three
of them said they were of gaul / and other three said they were of Irland / and
the other three said they were of Denmark / So as they satte thus / there came
out a bed of tree of a chamber / the which four gentylwymmen brought / and
in the bed lay a good man seek / and a crown of gold upon his head / and there
in the mids of the place they set him down and went again their way /
Then he lift up his head and said Galahad knight ye be welcome / for much
have I desired your coming / for in such pain and in such anguysshe I have been long / But now I trust to god the term is come that my pain shall be
alayed that I shall pass out of this world so as it was promised me long ago
/ there with a voice said there be two among you that be not in the quest of
the Sancgreal and therefore depart ye

Capitulum xx
Then king Pelles and his sone departed / and there with all besemed them
that there came a man and four angels from heaven clothed in lykenes of a Bishop
/ and had a cross in his hand / and these four angels bare ^ him up in a
chayer / and set him down before the table of silver where upon the
Sancgreal was / and it seemed that he had in mids of his forhede letters the
which said / See ye here Joseph the first Bishop of Crystendome the same
which our lord socoured in the Cite of Sarras in the spyrytuel place / Then
the knights merueylled / for that Bishop was deed more than three honderd year
to fore / O knights said he / merueyle not / For I was sometime an erthely man
/ with that they herd the chamber door open / and there they saw Angels and
two bare candels of wax / and the third a towel / and the fourth a spear
which bled merueillously that three drops fell within a box which he held
with his other hand / And they set the candels upon the table / and the third
the towel upon the vessel / and the fourth the holy spear even up right upon
the vessel / And then the Bishop made semblaunt as thou he would have gone to
the sacrynge of the mass / And then he took an vbblye which was made in
lykenes of breed / And at the lyftynge up / there came a fygur in lykenes of a
child / and the vysage was as reed and as bryghte as any fire and smote him
self in to the breed / so that they all saw hit that the breed was formed of a
flesshely man / and then he put hit in to the holy vessel again / and
then he did that longed to a priest to do to a mass / And then he went
to Galahad and kyssed him / and badde him goo and kiss his felawes / and so
he did anon / Now said he servants of Ihesu Christ ye shall be fed before
this table with sweet metes that never knights tasted / And when he had said
/ he vanysshed awey And they set hem at the table in great dread and made
their prayers / then looked they and saw a man come out of the holy vessel
that had all the signs of the passion of Ihesu Christ bledynge all openly /
and said my knights and my servants and my true children which ben come
out of dedely life in to spyrytual life I will now no longer hyde me from you /
but ye shall see now a part of my secrets and of my hid things / Now
holds and receives the high mete which ye have so much desired / Then
took he him self the holy vessel and came to Galahad / and he kneled down /
and there he received his saueour / and after him so received all his felawes
/ and they thought it so sweet that hit was merueillous to tell / Then
said he to Galahad / sone wotest thou what I hold betwixe my hands / Nay said
he / but if ye will tell me / This is said he the holy dysshe wherein I ete the
lamb on sherthursdaye / And now have thou seen that thou most desired to see /
but yet haste thou not seen hit so openly as thou shall see it in the Cite of
Sarras in the spyrituel place Therefore thou must go hens and bear with the this
holy vessel For this night it shall depart from the Realm of Logrys / that
it shall never be seen more here / and wotest thou wherefore for he is not
served nor worshypped to his right by them of this land / for they be turned
to euylle living / therefore I shall disheryte them of the honor which I have
done hem / And therefore goo ye three to morrow unto the sea where ye shall find
your ship ready / and with you take the suerd with the strange gyrdels and no
mo with you but sire Percyual and sire Bors / Also I will that ye take with you
of the blood of this spear for to enoynte the maimed king both his legs and
all his body and he shall have his he^e / Sire said Galahad why shall not
these other felawes goo with us / for this cause For right as I departed my
postels one here and another there so I will that ye depart / and two of you
shall dye in my seruyse / but one of you shall come again and tell tidings /
Then gaf he hem his blessing and vanysshed away /

Capitulum xxj
ANd Galahad went anon to the spear which lay up on the table / and touched
the blood with his fyngers and came after to the maimed king and anointed his
legs / and there with he clothed him anon / and starte upon his feet out of
his bed as an hole man / and thanked our lord that he had helyd him / and
that was not to the world ward / For anon he yielded him to a place of Relygyon
of white monks and was a full holy man / That same night about mydnyght came
a voice among hem which said my sons and not my chyef sons my friends and
not my werryours / goo ye hens where ye hope best to do and as I bad you / A
thanked be thou lord that thou will vouchesaufe to call us thy sinners Now
may we well preue that we have not lost our pains / And anon in all haste
they took their harneis and departed But the three knights of Gaul one of them
hyghte Claudyne king Claudas sone / and the other two were great gentylmen /
then praid galahad to eueryche of them that if they come to king Arthurs
court that they should salewe my lord sir lancelot my fader and of hem of the
round table / and prayed hem if that they came on that party that they should not
forgete it / Right so departed Galahad / Percyual / and Bors with him / and
so they rode three days / and then they came to a Ryuage and fond the ship
whereof the tale speaks of to fore / And when they came to the board / they
fond in the mids the table of silver / which they had left with the maimed
king and the Sancgreal which was couerd with read samyte / Then were they
glad to have such things in their felaushyp / and so they entryd / and
maade great reverence there to / and Galahad fell in his prayer long time to
our lord that at what time he asked that he should pass out of this world /
so much he prayed till a voice said to him Galahad thou shall have thy request
/ And when thou ask the death of thy body thou shall have it / and then
shall thou find the life of the soul / Percyual herd this / and prayed him of
felauship that was bitwene them to tell him wherefore he asked such things /
That shall I tell you said Galahad / the other day when we saw a part of
the adventures of the Sancgreal I was in such a Joy of heart that I trow
never man was / that was erthely / And therefore I wot well when my body is deed
/ my soul shall be in great Joy to see the blessid Trynyte every day / and
the mageste of our lord Ihesu Christ So long were they in the ship / that
they said to Galahad sir in this bed ought ye to lie / for so says the /
scripture / and so he leyd him down and slepte a great while / And when he
awaked he looked before him and saw the Cite of Sarras And as they would have
landed / they saw the ship wherein Percyual had put his sister in / Truly
said Percyual in the name of god / well has my sister holden us covenant /
Then took they out of the ship the table of silver / and he took it to
Percyual and to Bors to goo to fore / and Galahad came behind / and right so
they went to the Cite / and at the gate of the Cite they saw an old man crooked
/ Then Galahad called him and bad him help to bear this heavy thing / Truly
said the old man / it is ten year ago that I myt not goo but with crouchys /
Care thou not said Galahad and arise up and show thy good will / and so he
assayed / and fond him self as hole as ever he was / Then ran he to the
table / and took one part against Galahad / and anon arose there great noise
in the Cite that a cryppyl was maade hole by knights merueyls that entryd in
to the Cite / Then anon after the three knights went to the water / and
brought up in to the paleys Percyuals sister / and buried her as rychely as a
kings daughter ought to be / And when the king of the Cite which was cleped
Estorause saw the felaushyp / he asked hem of whens they were / and what thing
it was that they had brought upon the table of silver / and they told him the
truth of the Sancgreal and the power which that god had set there / Then
the king was a Tyrant / and was come of the line of paynyms / and took hem /
and put hem in prison in a deep hole

Capitulum xxij
But as soon as they were there our lord sent hem the Sancgreal / through
whoos grace they were al way fulfilled while that they were in prison / So at
the years end hit befelle that this king Estourause lay seek and felt that
he should dye / Then he sent for the three knights and they came before him /
and he cried hem mercy of that he had done to them / and they forgaf hit him
goodely and he dyed anon / when the king was deed / all the Cite was
desmayed and wist not who might be her king / Right so as they were in
counceille there came a voice among them / and badde hem chese the youngest
knight of them three to be her king for he shall well mayntene you and all
yours / So they made Galahad king by all the assente of the hole Cite / and
else they would have slain him / And when he was come to be hold the land /
he let make above the table of silver a cheste of gold and of precious stones
that hylled the holy vessel / And every day erly the three felawes would come
before hit / and make their prayers / Now at the years end and the self day
after Galahad had borne the croune of gold / he arose up erly and his felawes /
and came to the palais / and saw to fore hem the holy vessel / and a man
knelynge on his knees in lykenes of a Bishop that had about him a great
felaushyp of Angels as it had been Ihesu Christ him self / and then he arose
and began a mass of our lady / And when he came to the sacrament of the
mass / and had done / anon he called Galahad and said to him come forth the
servant of Ihesu christ and thou shall see that thou have much desired to see
/ and then he began to tremble right hard / when the dedely flesh began
to behold the spyrytuel things / Then he held up his hands toward heaven /
and said lord I thank the / for now I see that that has been my desire many a
day / Now blessed lord would I not longer live if it might please the lord /
and there with the good man took our lords body betwixe his hands / and
proferd it to Galahad / and he received hit right gladly and mekely / Now
wotest thou what I am said the good man / Nay said Galahad / I am Joseph of
Armathye the which our lord has sent here to the to bear the felaushyp /
and wotest thou wherefore that he has sent me more than any other / For thou
have resemblyd in to things in that thou have seen the merueyls of the
Sancgreal in that thou have ben a clean maiden as I have been and am / And
when he had said these words Galahad went to Percyual and kyssed him and
commanded him to god / and so he went to sire Bors / and kyssed him / and
commanded him to god / and said Fair lord salewe me to my lord sir lancelot
/ my fader / And as soon as ye see him / bid him remember of this unstable
world And there with he kneled down tofore the table / and made his prayers /
and then suddenly his soul departed to Ihesu Crist and a great multitude of
Angels bare his soul up to heaven / that the two felawes might well behold hit
/ Also the two felawes saw come from heaven an hand / but they saw not the
body / And then hit came right to the vessel / and took it and the spear / and
so bare hit up to heaven / Sythen was there never man so hardy to say that he
had seen the Sancgreal /

Capitulum xxiij
When Percyual and Bors saw Galahad deed / they made as much sorrow as ever
did two men / And if they had not ben good men / they might lightly have fallen
in despair / and the people of the country and of the cite were ryt heavy And
then he was buried / And as soon as he was buried sire Percyual yielded him
to an hermytage out of the cite / and took a relygyous clothing / and Bors
was always with him / but never changed he his seculer clothyng for that he
purposed him to goo again in to the Realm of Logrys / Thus a year and two
months lived sir Percyual in the hermytage a full holy life / and then passed
out of this world and Bors let bery him by his sister and by Galahad in the
spyrytueltees / when Bors saw that he was in so fer countries as in the
parties of Babyloyne he departed from Sarras / and armed him and came to the sea
/ and entryd in to a ship / and so it befelle him in good adventure / he came
in to the Realm of Logrys / and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot where
the king was / and then was there great Joy made of him in the Court / for
they wend all / he had been deed / for as much as he had been so long out of
the country / and when they had eten / the king made great clerks to come
before him / that they should cronycle of the high adventures of the good
knights / When Bors had told him of the adventures of the Sancgreal such as
had befalle him / and his three felawes that was lancelot / Percyual / Galahad
/ and him self There Lancelot told the adventures of the Sancgreal / that he
had seen / All this was made in great books / and put up in almeryes at
Salysbury / And anon sir Bors said to sire Lancelot / Galahad your own sone
salewed you by me / and after you king Arthur / and all the Court / and so
did sir Percyual / for I buried hem with mine own hands in the Cite of Sarras
/

Also sire Lancelot Galahad prayed you to remember of this vnsyker world as ye
behyght him when ye were to gyders more than half a year / This is true said
lancelot / Now I trust to god his prayer shall avail me / then Lancelot
took sir Bors in his arms / and said gentyl cosyn ye are right welcome to me /
and all that ever I may do for you and for yours ye shall find my pour
body ready at all times / whiles the spyryte is in hit / and that I promise
you feythfully / and never to fail And wete ye well gentyl cosyn sire Bors that
ye and I will never depart in sonder whylest our lives may last / Sir said
he I will as ye will

Thus ends thistory of the Sancgreal that was breuely drawn out of Frensshe
in to English / the which is a story cronycled for one of the truest and the
holiest that is in this world / the which is the xvij book /
And here follows the eyghtenth book
Capitulum Primum
So after the quest of the Sancgreal was fulfilled / and all knights that
were left on live were comen again unto the table round as the book of the
Sancgreal makes mencyon Then was there great Joy in the court / and in
especyal king Arthur and queen Gueneuer made great Joy of the remenaunt that
were comen home / and passing glad was the king and the queen of sire
lancelot and of sire Bors / For they had been passing long away in the quest
of the Sancgreal / Then as the book says sir lancelot began to resort
unto queen Gueneuer again / and forgot the promise and the perfectyon that he
made in the quest / for as the book says had not sire Lancelot ben in hie
preuy thoutes and in his minds so set inwardly to the queen as he was in
semyng outeward to god / there had no knight passed him in the queste of the
Sancgreal / but ever his thoughts were pryuely on the Queen / and so they
loved to gyder more hotter than they did to fore hand / and had such preuy
draughtes to gyder that many in the Court spak of hit / and in especial sir
Agrauayne / sir Gawayns brother / for he was ever open mouthed / So bifel that
sire Lancelot had many resortes of ladies and damoysels that daily resorted
unto him / that besoughte him to be their champyon / and in all such matters
of right sir lancelot applied him daily to do for the pleasyr of our lord
Ihesu crist And ever as much as he might he withdrewe him from the company
and felaushyp of Queen Gueneuer for to eschew the sklaunder and noise /
wherefore the queen waxed wroth with sir Lancelot / and upon a day she called
sir lancelot unto her chamber and said thus / Sir lancelot I see and feel
daily that thy love begins to slake / for thou have no Joy to be in my
presence / but ever thou art out of this Cource / and quarrels and matters thou
have now a days for ladies and gentilwymmen more than ever thou were wont to
have before hand / A madame said lancelot / in this ye must hold me excused
for diverse causes / one is / I was but late in the quest of the Sancgreal /
and I thank god of his great mercy and never of my deserte that I saw in that
my quest as much as ever saw any synful man / and so was it told me / And if
I had not had my pryuy thoughts to return to your love again as I do I had
seen as great mysteryes as ever saw my sone Galahad outher Percyual or sir
Bors / and therefore madame I was but late in that quest / wete ye well madame hit
may not be yet lyghtely forgeten the hy seruyse in whom I did my dylygent
labor / Also madame wete ye well that there be many men speken of our love in
this court / and have you and me gretely in a wait / as sire Agrauayne and
sir Mordred / and madame wete ye well I dread them more for your sake / than
for any fere I have of them my self / for I may happen to escape and ride my
self in a great need where ye must abide all that will be said unto you / And
then if that ye fall in any distress through wylfulle folly / then is there
none other remedy or help but by me and my blood / And wete ye well madame the
boldenes of you and me will bring us to great shame and sklaunder / and that
were me loathe to see you dishonored / and that is the cause / I take upon me
more for to do for damoysels and maidens than ever I did to forne that men
should vnterstande my Joy and my delight is my pleasyr to have adoo for
damoisels and maidens

Capitulum ij
All this while the queen stood stylle and let sir lancelot say what he
would / And when he had all said she brast out on weeping / and so she
sobbed and wept a great while / And when she might speak she said / lancelot
now I well understand that thou art a falls recreau^t knight and a common
lecheoure / and love and hold other ladies / and by me thou have desdayne
and scorn / For wete thou well she said now I understand thy falshede / and
therefore shall I never love the no more / and never be thou so hardy to come in
my syghte / and right here I discharge the this Court that thou never come
within hit / and I forfende the my felaushyp / and upon pain of thy head that
thou see me no more / Right so sire Lancelot departed with great heaviness /
that uneath he myt sustain him self for great dole making Then he called
sir Bors sir Ector de marys and sir Lyonel and told hem how the queen had
forfendyd him the Court and so he was in will to depart in to his own
Country / Fair sir said sire Bors de ganys / ye shall not depart out of
this land by mine advise / ye must remember in what honor ye are renoumed and
called the noblest knight of the world / and many great matters ye have in hand
/ and wymmen in their hastynes will do oftymes that sore repents hem / and
therefore by mine advise ye shall take your horse / and ride to the good
hermytage here beside wyndsoure that sometime was a good knight / his name is
sir Brasias / and there shall ye abide till I send you word of better tidings
/ Brother said sir lancelot wete ye well I am full loathe to depart out of this
realm / but the queen has defended me so hyhely / that me seems she will
never be my good lady as she has been / Say ye never so said sir Bors / for
many times or this time she has been wroth with you / and after it she was the
first that repented it / Ye say well said lancelot / for now will I do by
your counceylle and take mine horse and my harneis and ride to the heremyte sir
Brasias / and there will I repose me until I here sum manner of tidings fro
you / but fair brother I pray you get me the love of my lady Queen Gueneuer
and ye may /

Sire said sire Bors ye need not to meue me of such matters For well ye wot I
will do what I may to please you / and then the noble knight sire
Lancelot departed with right heavy chere suddenly / that none erthely creature
wyste of him / nor where he was become / but sir Bors / So when sir lancelot
was departed / the queen outward made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of
his blood nor to none other / But wete ye well inwardly as the book says she
took great thought but she bare it out with a proud countenance / as though
she felt nothing nor danger

Capitulum Tercium /
ANd then the queen let make a preuy dinner in london unto the knytes of the
round table / and al was for to show outward that she had as great Joy in all
other knights of the table round as she had in sir lancelot / al only at that
dinner she had sir Gawayne and his brethren / that is for to say sir Agrauayn
/ sir Gaherys / sire Gareth and sire Mordred / Also there was sir Bors de ganys
/ sire Blamor de ganys / sir Bleoberys de ganys / sire Galyhud / sir Galyhodyn
sire Ector de marys / sir Lyonel / sire Palomydes / sir Safyr his brother / sir
la cote male tail / sir Persaunt / sir Ironsyde / sire Brandyles / sir kay le
Seneschal / sir Mador de la port / Sire Patryse a knight of Irland / Alyduk /
sir Astamore / and sir Pynel le saueage / the which was cosyn to sire Lamorak
de galys the good knight that sir Gawayne and his brethren slew by treason /
and so these four and twenty knights should dyne with the queen in a preuy
place by them self / and there was made a great feast of al manner of deyntees /
but sire Gawayne had a customme that he used daily at dinner and at souper that
he loved well al manner of fruit / and in especial appels and perys / And
therefore who someuer dyned or feested sire Gawayne would comynly purueye for
good fruit for him / and so did the queen for to please sir Gawayne / she
let purueye for him al manner of fruit / for sir Gawayn was a passing hot
knight of nature / and this Pyonel hated sire Gawayne by cause of his kynnesman
sir Lamorak de galys and therefore for pure envy and hate sir Pyonel enpoysond
certain appels for to enpoysonne sir Gawayn / and so this was well unto the
end of the mete / and so it befelle by mysfortune a good knight named Patryse
cosyn unto sire Mador de la port to take a poysend Appel / And when he had
eten hit / he swalle so till he brast / and there sire Patryce fell down
suddenly deed among hem / Then every knight lepte from the board ashamed and
araged for wrath nyghe out of her wits / For they wyste not what to say
considering Queen Gueneuer made the feast and dinner / they all had suspecyon
unto her / My lady the queen said Gawayne / wete ye well madame that this dinner
was made for me / for all folks that known my condycyon understand that I
love / well fruit / and now I see well / I had nere be slain / therefore madame I
dread me lest ye will be shamed / Then the queen stood stylle and was sore
abashed / that he nyst not what to say / This shall not so be ended said sir
Mador de la port / for here have I lost a full noble knight of my blood / And
therefore upon this shame and despyte I will be revenged to the vtteraunce /
and there openly sir Mador appeled the queen of the death of his cosyn sir
patryse / then stood they all stylle that none would speak a word against him
/ for they all had great suspecyon unto the queen by cause she let make that
dinner / and the queen was so abashed that she could none other ways do but
wept so hertely that she fell in a swoune / with this noise and cry came to
them king Arthur / And when he wist of that trouble / he was a passing heavy
man

Capitulum iiij
ANd ever sir Mador stood stylle before the king / and ever he appeled the
queen of treason / for the customme was such that time that all manner of
shameful death was called treason / Fair lords said king Arthur me repents
of this trouble / but the caas is so I may not have adoo in this matter / for I
must be a ryghtful Judge / and that repents me that I may not do batail for
my wife / for as I deem this deed came never by her / And therefore I suppose she
shall not be all distayned / but that sum good knight shall putt his body in
Ieopardy for my queen rather than she shall be brent in a wrong quarrel / And
therefore sir Mador be not so hasty / for hit may happen she shall not be all
frendeles / and therefore desire thou thy day of bataille / and she shall
purueye her of sum good knight / that shall ansuer you or else it were to me
great shame / and to all my court / My gracyous lord said sir Mador ye must
hold me excused / for though ye be our king in that degree / ye are but a
knight as we are / and ye are sworn unto knyghthode as well as we / and therefore
I biseche you that ye be not displeased / For there is none of the four and
twenty knights that were boden to this dinner / but all they have great
suspecyon unto the queen / what say ye all my lords said sir Mador / then
they ansuerd by and by that they could not excuse the queen / for why she made
the dinner / and outher hit must come by her or by her servants / Allas said
the queen I made this dinner for a good entente / and never for none evil so
almighty god me help in my right as I was never purposed to do such euylle
deeds / and that I report me unto god / My lord the king said sir Mador I
require you as ye be a ryghtuous king give me a day that I may have Justice /
well said the king I give the day this day xv days that thou be ready armed on
horsbak in the medowe beside westmynster / And if it so fall that there be
any knight to encounter with you / there may thou do the best / and god
speed the right / And if hit so fall that there be no knight at that day /
then must my queen be burnt / and there she shall be ready to have her
Judgment / I am ansuerd said sir Mador / and every knight went where it lyked
hem / So when the king and the queen were to gyders / the king asked the
queen how this caas bifelle / the queen ansuerd / so god me help I wot not how
nor in what manner / where is sir lancelot said king Arthur / and he were here
he would not grutche to do betaille for you / Sire said the queen I wot not
where he is / but his brother and his kynnesmen deem that he be not within this
Realm / that me repents said king Arthur / For and he were here / he would
soon stynte this stryf / Then I will counceyle you said the king and unto
sire Bors that ye will do bataille for her for sir launcelots sake / And upon
my life he will not refuse you / For well I see said the king that none of
these four and twenty knights that were with you at your dinner where sir
Patryse was slain that will do batail for you nor none of hem will say well
of you / and that shall be a great sklaunder for you in this Court / Allas
said the queen and I may not do with all but now I mys sir lancelot / for
and he were here / he would put me soon to my hertes ease / what eyleth you
said the king ye can not keep sir lancelot upon your side / for wete ye well
said the king who that has sire Lancelot upon his party / has the most
man of worship in the world upon his side / Now goo your way said the king
unto the queen / and require sir Bors to do bataille for you for sire
launcelots sake

Capitulum quintum /
So the queen departed from the king / and sent for sir Bors in to her
chamber / And when he was come she besought him of socour / Madame said he /
what would ye that I did / for I may not with my worship have adoo in this
matter by cause I was at the same dinner for dread that any of tho knights would
have me in suspecyon / Also madame said sir Bors now mys ye sir lancelot / for
he would not have failed you neither in right nor in wrong / as ye have well
preued when ye have been in danger / and now ye have driven him out of this
country / by whom ye and all we were daily worshypped by / therefore madame I
merueylle how ye dar for shame require me to do any thing for you in so
much ye have chaced him out of your country / by whom we were borne up and
honored / Allas fair knight said the queen I put me holy in your grace / and
all that is done amys / I will amend as ye will counceyle me / And therewith
she kneled down upon both her knees / and besought sir Bors to have mercy
upon her / outher I shall have a shameful death and thereto I never offended /
Right so came king Arthur / and fond the queen knelyng before sir Bors / then
sir Bors pulled her up / and said Madame ye do me great dishonor / A gentil
knight said the king have mercy upon my Queen curtois knight / for I am now in
certain she is untruly defamed And there for curtois knight said the king /
promise her to do bataille for her / I require you for the love of sir
lancelot / My lord said sir Bors ye require me the grettest thing that any
man may require me / And wete ye well if I grant to do bataille for the queen
I shall wrath many of my felauship of the table round / but as for that said
Bors I will grant my lord / that for my lord sir launcelots sake and for
your sake I will at that day be the queen's champyon / onles that there come
by adventure a better knight than I am to do batail for her / Will ye promise
me this said the king by your feythe / ye sir said sir Bors / of that I will
not fail you / nor her both / but if there came a better knight than I am /
and then shall he have the bataille / Then was the king and the queen
passing glad / and so departed / and thanked him hertely / So then sir
Bors departed secretly upon a day / and rode unto sire lancelot there as he
was with the heremyte sir Brastias / and told him of all their adventure A
Ihesu said sir Lancelot this is come happily as I would have hit / and therefore
I pray you make you ready to do bataille / but look that ye tarry till ye see me
come as long as ye may / For I am sure Mador is an hot knight when he is
enchaufed / for the more ye suffer him the hastyer will he be to batail / sir
said Bors let me dele with him / Doubt ye not ye shall have all your will
/ then departed sire Bors from him / and came to the Court again ^ Then
was hit noysed in all the Court that sir Bors should do bataill for the queen
/ wherefore many knights were displeased with him / that he would take upon him
to do batail in the queen's quarrel for there were but fowe knights in all the
court but they demed the queen was in the wrong / and that she had done that
treason / So sire Bors ansuerd thus to his felawes of the table round / wete
ye well my fair lords it were shame to us all and we suffered to see the most
noble queen of the world to be shamed openly considering her lord / and our
lord is the man of most worship in the world and most crystend / and he has
ever worshipped us all in all places / Many ansuerd him again / As for our
most noble king Arthur we love him and honor him as well as ye do / but as
for queen Gueneuer we love her not by cause she is a destroyer of good knights
Fair lords said sir Bors me seems ye say not as ye should say / for never
yet in my days knew I never nor herd say / that ever she was a destroyer of
any good knight / But at all times as far as ever I could know / she was
a mayntener of good knights / and ever she has been large and free of her
goods to all good knights / and the most bountenous lady of her yeftes and
her good grace that ever I saw or herd speak of / And there for it were shame
said sire Bors to us all to our most noble kings wife / and we suffered her to
be shamefully slain / And wete ye well said sire Bors I will not suffer it /
for I dare say so much the queen is not gylty of sir Patryse death / for she
owed him never none ylle will / nor none of the four and twenty knights that
were at that dinner / for I dar say / for good love she bad us to dinner / and
not for no male engyne / and that I doubt not shall be preued here after /
for how someuer the game goth / there was treason among us / Then some said
to sire Bors we may well bileue your words / and so some of them were well
pleasyd / and sum were not so

Capitulum vj
THe day came on fast until the even that the bataille should be / Then the
queen sent for sir Bors and asked him how he was disposed / Truly madame said
he I am disposed in like wise as I promised you / that is for to say I shall
not fail you / onles by adventure there come a better knight than I am to do
batail for you / then madame am I discharged of my promise / will ye said
the queen that I tell my lord Arthur thus / does as it shall please you madame
/ Then the queen went unto the king and told him the ansuer of sir Bors /
have ye no doubt said the king of sir Bors / for I call him now one of the
best knights of the world and the most profytelyest man / And thus it past on
until the morn / and the king and the queen and all manner of knights that
were there at that time drew them unto the medowe bysyde wynchester where the
bataylle should be / And so when the king was come with the Queen / and many
knights of the round table / than the queen was put there in the Conestables
ward and a great fire made about an iron stake / that and sir Mador de la
port had the better / she should be burnt / such customme was used in tho
days / that neither for favor neither for love nor affynyte / there should be
none other but ryghtuous Judgment as well up on a king as upon a knight / and
as well upon a Queen as upon another pour lady / So in this mean while came
in sir Mador de la port / and took his oath before the king / that the queen
did this treason until his cosyn sir Patryse / and unto his oath / he would
preue it with his body hand for hand who that would say the contrary / Right so
came in sire Bors de ganys and said that as for queen Gueneuer she is in the
right and that will I make good with my hands / that she is not culpable of
this treason that is put upon her / Then make the ready said sir Mador / and
we shall preue whether thou be in the right or I / Sir Mador said sir Bors
wete thou well I know you for a good knight / Not for then I shall not fere
you so gretely / but I trust to god I shall be able to withstand your
malice / But thus much have I promised my lord Arthur and my lady the queen
that I shall do bataille for her in this caas to the vttermest / onles that
there come a better knight than I am / and discharge me / Is that all said
sire Mador / outher come thou of / and do batail with me / or else say nay /
Take your horse said sire Bors / and as I suppose ye shall not tarry long / but
ye shall be ansuerd / then either departed to their tentys and maade hem
ready to horsbak as they thought best / And anon sir Mador came in to the field
with his shield on his sholder and his spear in his hand And so rode about
the place cryenge unto Arthur bid your champyon come forth and he dare /
Then was sir Bors ashamed and took his horse / and came to the lystes end /
And then was he ware where came from a wood there fast by a knight all armed
upon a white horse with a strange shield of strange arms / and he came
riding all that he might run / and so he came to sir Bors and said thus
Fair knight I pray you be not displeased / for here must a better knyt than ye
are have this bataille / therefore I pray you withdraw you / For wete ye well I
have had this day a right great Iourneye / and this bataille ought to be mine /
and so I promised you when I spak with you last / and with all my heart I
thank you of your good will / Then sire Bors rode unto king Arthur and
told him how there was a knyt come that would have the bataille for to fight
for the Queen what knight is he said the king / I wot not said sire Bors /
but such covenant he made with me to be here this day Now my lord said sir
Bors here am I discharged /

Capitulum vij
Then the king called to that knight / and asked him / if he would fight
for the queen / Then he ansuerd to the king therefore came I hydder / and
therefore sir king he said tarry me no longer for I may not tarry / For anon as I
have fynysshed this bataille I must depart hens / for I have a do many matters
else where / For wete you well said that knight this is dishonor to you all
knights of the round table to see and know so noble a lady and so curtoys a
queen as queen Gueneuer is thus to be rebuked and shamed amongst you / then
they all merueylled what knyt that might be that so took the bataille upon
him / For there was not one that knew him but if it were sire Bors / Then
said sir Mador de la port unto the king / now let me wete with whom I
shall have adoo with all / And then they rode to the lystes end / and
there they couched their speres / and ran to gyder with all their myghtes /
and sire Madors spear brake all to pyeces / but the others spear held / and
bare sire Madors horse and all bakward to the earth a great fall / But
myghtely and suddenly he avoided his horse / and put his sheld before him / and
then drew his suerd / and badde the other knight alyghte / and do batail
with him on foot Then that knight descended from his horse lightly like a
valiant man / and put his sheld before him and drew his suerd / and so they
came egerly unto bataille / and either gaf other many great strokes tracynge
and trauercynge / racynge and foynynge / and hurtlyng to gyder with her suerdes
as it were wyld bores / thus were they fighting nyghe an hour / For this sir
Mador was a strong knight / and myghtely proved in many strong batails / But
at the last this knight smote sir Madore grouelynge upon the earth / and the
knight stepped nere him to have pulled sir Mador flatlynge upon the ground /
and there with suddenly sir Mador aroos / and in his rysynge he smote that
knight through the thyck of the thyes that the blood ran out fyersly / And
when he felt him self so wounded / and saw his blood / he let him arise
upon his feet / And then he gaf him such a buffet up on the helm / that he
fell to the earth flatlynge / and therewith he strode to him to have pulled of
his helm of his head / And then sir Mador prayed that knight to save his life
/ and so he yielded him as overcome and relecyd the queen of his quarrel / I
will not grant the thy life said that knight only that thou freely relece the
queen for ever / and that no mencyon be made upon sir Patryces tomb that ever
Queen Gueneuer consented to that treason / All this shall be done said sir
mador I clearly discharge my quarrel for ever / Then the knytes parters of the
lystes took up sire Mador / and led him to his tente / and the other knight
went streyghte to the steyer foot where sat king Arthur / and by that time
was the queen come to the king / and either kyssed other hertely / And when
the king saw that knight / he stouped down to him / and thanked him / and
in like wise did the queen / and the king prayed him to put of his helmet /
and to repose him / and to take a sop of wyn / and then he put of his helm
to drink / and then every knight knew him that it was sire Lancelot du
lake / Anon as the queen wist that / he took the queen in his hand / and yode
unto sir lancelot and said sir grant mercy of your great trauaille that ye
have had this day for me and for my queen / My lord said sir lancelot wete
ye well I ought of right ever to be in your quarrel / and in my lady the queen's
quarrel to do batail / for ye ar the man that gaf me the high order of
knyghthode / and that day my lady your queen did me great worship / and else I
had been shamed for that same day ye made me knight / through my hastynesse I
lost my suerd / and my lady your queen fond hit / and lawed hit in her train /
and gafe me my suerd when I had need thereto / and else had I ben shamed emonge
all knights / and therefore my lord Arthur I promised her at that day ever to
be her knight in right outher in wrong / Grant mercy said the king for this
iourneye / and wete ye well said the king I shall acquyte your goodenes / and
ever the queen beheld sir lancelot / and wept so tendyrly that she sanke all
most to the ground for sorrow that he had done to her so great goodenes where
she showed him great unkindness / Then the knights of his blood drew unto
him / and there either of them made great joy of other / And so came all the
knights of the table round that were there at that time / and welcomed him /
And then sir Mador was had to leche craft / and sire lancelot was helyd of
his wou^d / And then there was made great Joy and myrthes in that court

ANd so it befelle that the damoysel of the lake / her name was Nymue / the
which wedded the good knyt sir Pelleas / and so she came to the Court / for
ever she did great goodenes unto king Arthur / and to all his knytes through
her sorcery and enchauntementes / And so when she herd how the queen was an
angered for the death of sire Patryse / Then she told it openly that she was
never gylty and there she disclosed by whom it was done and named him sir
Pynel / and for what cause he did it / there it was openly disclosed / and so
the queen was excused / and the knyt Pynel fled in to his country / Then was
it openly known that sir Pynel enpoysond the appels at the feast to that
entente to have destroyed sire Gawayne / by cause sir Gawayne and his brethren
destroyed sir Lamorak de galys / to the which sire Pynel was cosyn unto /
Then was sire Patryce buried in the church of westmestre in a tomb / and
there upon was written / Here lies sire Patryce of Irlond slain by sire Pynel
le saueage / that enpoysoned appels to have slain sire Gawayne / and by
mysfortune sire Patryce ete one of tho appels / and then suddenly he brast /
Also there was written upon the tomb that Queen Gueneuer was appelyd of treason
of the death of sire Patryce by sir Mador de la port / and there was made
mencyon how sire lancelot fought with him for queen Gueneuer / and overcame
him in plain bataille / All this was written upon the tomb of sir Patryce in
excusing of the queen / And then sir Mador sewed daily and long / to have the
Queen's good grace / and so by the means of sire lancelot he caused him to
stand in the queen's good grace / and all was forgyuen / Thus it passed on till
our lady day assupcyon / within a xv days of that feast the king let cry
a great Iustes and a turnement that should be at that day at Camelot that is
wynchester / and the king let cry that he and the king of Scotts would
Just against all that would come against hem / And when this cry was made /
thydder came many knights / So there came thither the king of Northgalys and
king Anguysshe of Irland / and the king with the honderd knights / and
Galahaut the haute prince / and the King of Northumberland / and many other
noble dukes and Earls of diverse countries / So king Arthur made him ready to
depart to thise Iustys / and would have had the Queen with him / but at that
time she would not / she said / for she was seek and might not ride at that
time / That me repents said the king / for this seven year ye saw not such
a noble felaushyp to gyders except at wytsontyde when Galahad departed from
the Court / Truly said the queen to the king / ye must hold me excused / I
may not be there / and that me repents / and many demed the queen would not
be there by cause of sir lancelot du lake / for sire lancelot would not ride
with the king / for he said / that he was not hole of the wound the which
sire Mador had given him / wherefore the king was heavy and passing wroth / and
so he departed toward wynchestre with his felaushyp / and so by the way the
king lodged in a Town called Astolot / that is now in Englyssh called Gylford
/ and there the king lay in the Castle / So when the king was departed / the
queen called sir lancelot to her / and said thus / Sire lancelot ye are
gretely to blame thus to hold you behind my lord / what trow ye what will
your enemies and mine say and deem / naught else but see how sire launcolot
holds him ever behind the king / and so does the queen / for that they would
have their pleasyr to gyders / And thus will they say said the Queen to sir

MAdame said sir Lancelot I allow your wit / it is of late come syn ye were
wys^ / And therefore madame at this time I will be ruled by your counceylle /
and this night I will take my rest / and to morrow by time I will take my
way toward wynchestre /

But wete you well said sir Lancelot to the queen / that at that Iustes I will
be against the king and ageynste al his felaushyp / ye may there do as ye
list said the Queen / but by my counceylle ye shall not be against your king
and your felaushyp / For therein ben full many hard knights of your blood as
ye wot well enough / hit needs not to reherce them / Madame said sire
Lancelot I pray you that ye be not displeased with me / for I will take the
adventure that god will send me / And so upon the morn erly sire lancelot
herd mass and brake his fast / and so took his leave of the queen and departed
/ And then he rode so much until he came to Astolat that is Gylford / and
there hit happed him in the euentyde he came to an old Barons place that hight
sir Bernard of Astolat / And as sire lancelot entryd in to his lodging /
king Arthur aspyed him as he did walk in a gardyn beside the Castle how he
took his lodging / and knew him full well / It is well said king Arthur unto
the knights that were with him in that gardyn beside the casstel / I have now
aspyed one knight that will play his play at the Iustes / to the which we
be gone toward / I undertake he will do merueils / who is that we pray you tell
us said many knights that were there at that time / ye shall not wete for me
said the king as at this time / And so the king smyled / and went to his
lodging / So when sire lancelot was in his lodging / and unarmed him in his
chamber the old baron and heremyte came to him making his reverence and
welcomed him in the best manner / but the old knight knew not sire Lancelot /
Fair sir said sir lancelot to his hooste I would pray you to lone me a shield
that were not openly known / for mine is well known / Sir said his host ye
shall have your desire / for me seems ye be one of the lykelyest knights of
the world / and therefore I shall show you friendship Sire wete you well I have
two sons that were but late made knights / and the eldest hyghte sir Tirre /
and he was hurt that same day he was made knight that he may not ride / and
his sheld ye shall have / For that is not known I dare say but here / and in
no place else / and my youngest sone hight Lauayne / and if hit please you / he
shall ride with you unto that Iustes / and he is of his age strong and wight
/ for much my heart gives unto you that ye should be a / noble knyte therefore I
pray you tell me your name / said sir Bernard As for that said sire lancelot
ye must hold me excused as at this time / And if god give me grace to speed
well at the Iustes / I shall come again and tell you / but I pray you said
sir lancelot in any wise let me have your sone sire lauayne with me / and
that I may have your broders shield / All this shall be done said sir
Bernard / This old baron had a daughter that time that was called that time the
fair maiden of Astolat / And ever she beheld sir lancelot wonderfully / And
as the book says she cast such a love unto sir lancelot that she could never
withdraw her love / wherefore she dyed / and her name was Elayne le blank / So
thus as she came to and fro / she was so hot in her love that she besoughte
sir lancelot to were upon him at the Iustes a token of hers Fair damoysel
said sir lancelot / and if I grant you that ye may say I do more for your
love than ever I did for lady or damoysel / Then be remembryd him that he
would goo to the Iustes desguysed / And by cause he had never fore that time
borne no manner of token of no damoysel Then he bethoughte him that he would
bear one of her that none of his blood there by might know him / and then
he said Fair maiden I will grant you to were a token of yours upon mine
helmet / and therefore what it is / show it me Sir she said it is a reed sleue
of mine of scarlet well enbroudred with great perlys / and so she brought it him
/ So sire Lancelot received it / and said never did I erst so much / for no
damoysel / And then sir lancelot bitoke the fair maiden his shield in keeping
/ and praid her to keep that until that he came again / and so that night he
had merry rest and great chere / For ever the damoysel Elayne was about sire
Lancelot all the while she might be suffered

So upon a day on the morn king Arthur and al his knights departed / for
their king had tarried three days to abide his noble knights / And so when
the king was ryden / sir lancelot and sire Lauayne made hem ready to ride /
and either of hem had white sheldes / and the reed sleue sir Lancelot let
carry with him / and so they took their leave at sir Bernard the old baron /
and at his daughter the fair maiden of Astolat / And then they rode so
long til that they came to Camelot that time called wynchestre / and there was
great prees of kings / dukes / Earls / and barons / and many noble knights /
But there sir lancelot was lodged pryuely by the means of sir lauayne with a
rich burgeis that no man in that town was ware what they were / and so they
reposed them there til our lady day assumpcyon as the great feast should be /
So then trumpets blewe unto the field / and king Arthur was set on high
upon a skafhold to behold who did best / But as the Frensshe book says / the
king would not suffer sire Gawayn to goo from him / for never had sir Gawayn
the better and sire lancelot were in the field / and many times was sir Gawayn
rebuked when lau^celot came in to any Iustes desguysed / Then some of the
kings as king Anguysshe of Irland and the king of Scotts were that time
turned upon the side of king Arthur / And then on the other party was the
king of Northgalys / and the kymge with the honderd knights / and the king
of Northumberland / and sire Galahad the haut prince / But these three kings
and this duke were passing weyke to hold against king Arthurs party / for
with him were the noblest knights of the world / So then they withdrewe hem
either party from other / and every man made him ready in his best manner to do
what he might / Then sire Lancelot made him ready / and put the reed sleue
upon his head / and fastened it fast / and so sire lancelot and sire Lauayne
departed out of wynchestre pryuely / and rode until a little leuyd wood /
behind the party that held against king Arthurs party / and there they held
them stylle till the parties smote to gyders / and then came in the king of
Scotts and the king of Irland on Arthurs party / and against them came the
king of Northumberland / and the king with the honderd knights smote down
the king of Northumberland / and the king with the honderd knights smote
down king Anguysshe of Irland / Then sire Palomydes that was on Arthurs
party encountered with sire Galahad / and either of hem smote down other / and
either party halpe their lords on horsbak again / So there began a strong
assail upon both parties / And then came in sir Brandyles / sire Sagramor

fyse de dieu / sir Mordred / sir Melyot de logrys / sir Ozanna le cure hardy /
sir Safyr / sir Epynogrys / sir Galleron of Galway / All these xv knights
were knights of the table round / So these with moo other came in to gyders /
and beat on bak the king of Northumberland and the king of Northwalys / when
sir lancelot saw this as he houed in a lytil leued wood / then he said
unto sire lauayn / see yonder is a company of good knights / and they hold
them to gyders as bores that were chauffed with dogs / that is truth said
sire Lauayne

NOw said sire Lancelot / and ye will help me a little / ye shall see yonder
felauship that chaseth now these men in our side that they shall go as fast
bakward as they went forward / Sir spare not said sire Lauayne / for I shall
do what I may / Then sire Lancelot and sire Lauayne came in at the thyckest
of the prees / and there sire lancelot smote down sir Brandyles / sire
Sagramore / sire Dodynas / sir Kay / sir Gryflet / and all this he did with
one spear / and sire Lauayne smote down sire Lucan de buttelere / and sir
Bedeuere / And then sire Lancelot gat another spear / and there he smote
down sir Agrauayne / sire Gaherys / and sir Mordred and sir Melyot de Logrys /
and sir Lauayne smote down Ozanna le cure hardy / and then sir Lancelot
drew his suerd and there he smote on the right hand and on the lift hand and
by great force he vnhorced sir Safyr / sire Epynogrys / and sir Galleron / and
then the knights of the table round with drew them abak after they had
gotten their horses as well as they might / O mercy Ihesu said sire Gawayne what
knyte is yonder that does so merueyllous deeds of arms in that field / I wot
not what he is said king Arthur / But as at this time I will not name him /
sire said sire Gawayne I would say it were sir lancelot by his riding and his
buffets that I see him dele / but ever me seems it should not be he for that he
bears the reed sleue upon his head / for I wist him never bear token at no
Iustes of lady nor gentilwoman / Let him be said king Arthur / he will be
better known / and do more or ever he depart / Then the party that was
against king Arthur were well comforted / and then they held hem to gyders
that before hand were sore rebuked / Then sir Bors sir Ector de marys and sir
Lyonel called unto them the knytes of their blood / as sir Blamor de ganys /
sire Bleoberys sir Alyduke / sir Galyhud / sire Galyhodyn / sir Bellangere le
beuse / so these nine knights of sir launcelots skin threste in myghtely /
for they were al noble knights / and they of great hate and despyte that they
had unto him thought to rebuke that noble knight sir lancelot and sire
lauayne / for they knew hem not / and so they came hurlynge to gyders / and
smote down many knights of northgalys and of northumberland And when sire
lancelot saw them fare so / he gat a spear in his hand / and there
encountered with him al attones sir bors sir Ector and sire Lyonel / and all
they three smote him at ones with their speres / And with fors of them self
they smote sir launcelots horse to the earth / and by mysfortune sir bors smote
sire lancelot through the shield in to the side / and the spear brake / and the
head left stylle in his side / when sir Lauayne saw his master lie on the
ground / he ran to the king of scotts / and smote him to the earth / and by
great force he took his horse / and brought him to sir lancelot / and maulgre
of them al he made him to mount upon that horse / and then lancelot gat a
spear in his hand / and there he smote sire Bors horse and man to the earth / in
the same wise he served sire Ector and sire Lyonel / and sire Lauayne smote
down sir Blamore de ganys / And then sir lancelot drew his suerd for he
felt him self so sore y hurt that he wend there to have had his death / And
then he smote sire Bleoberys such a buffet on the helmet that he fell down
to the earth in a swoun And in the same wise he served sir Alyduk / and sir
Galyhud And sire Lauayne smote down sir Bellangere that was the sone of
Alysaunder le orphelyn / and by this was sire Bors horsed / and then he came
with sire Ector and sir Lyonel / and all they three smote with suerdes upon
sire launcelots helmet / And when he felt their buffets / and his wound the
which was so grievous than he thought to do what he might while he might
endure / And then he gaf sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow his
heed passing low / and there with all he raced of his helm / and might have
slain him / and so pulled him down / and in the same wise he served sire
Ector and sire Lyonel / For as the book says he might have slain them / but
when he saw their vysages / his heart might not serve him thereto / but left
hem there

And then afterward he hurled in to the thyckest prees of them all and did
there the merueyloust deeds of arms that ever man saw or herd speak of / And
ever sire Lauayne the good knight with him / and there sire Lancelot with his
suerd smote down and pulled down as the Frensshe book makes mencyon moo than
thyrtty knights / and the most party were of the table round / and sire
Lauayne did full well that day / for he smote down ten knights of the table

when he saw that he was from the field nyghe a mile that he was sure he might
not be seen / Then he said with an hy voys / O gentyl knight sir Lauayne
help me that this truncheon were out of my side / for it stycketh so sore
that it nyhe sleeth me / O mine own lord said sir Lauayne I would fayn do that
myt please you / but I dread me sore / and I pulle out the truncheon that ye
shall be in peril of death / I charge you said sir lancelot as ye love me
draw hit out / and there with all he descended from his horse / and right so
did sir Lauayn / and forth with all sir Lauayn drew the truncheon out of his
side / and gaf a great shryche and a merueillous grysely gro^e / and the blood
braste out nyghe a pynt at ones that at the last he sanke down upon his
buttoks and so swouned pale and dedely / Allas said sire Lauayne what shall I
do And then he turned sir lancelot in to the wind / but so he lay there
nyghe half an hour as he had been deed / And so at the last sire Lancelot
cast up his eyes / and said O Lauayn help me / that I were on my horse / for
here is fast by within this two mile a gentyl heremyte that sometime was a fulle
noble knight and a great lord of possessions / And for great goodenes he has
taken him to wylful pouerte / and forsaken many lands / and his name is sire
Baudewyn of Bretayn and he is a full noble surgeon and a good leche / Now let
see / help me up that I were there / for ever my heart gives me that I shall
never dye of my cosyn germayns hands / and then with great pain sir Lauayne
halpe him upon his horse And then they rode a great wallop to gyders / and
ever sir Lancelot blodde / that it ran down to the earth / and so by
fortune they came to that hermytage the which was under a wood / and a great
clyf on the other side / and a fair water rennynge under it / And then sire
Lauayn beat on the gate with the but of his spear / and cried fast / Let in
for Ihesus sake / and there came a fair child to them / and asked hem what they
would / Fair sone said sir Lauayne / goo and pray thy lord / the heremyte for
gods sake to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded / and this day
tell thy lord I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I herd say that any
man did So the child went in lyghtely / and then he brought the heremyte
the which was a passing good man / when sir lauayne saw him he prayed him for
gods sake of socour / what knight is he said the heremyte / is he of the hows
of king arthur or not / I wot not said sire Lauayne what is he / nor what is
his name / but well I wot I saw him do merueylously this day as of deeds of
arms / On whose party was be said the heremyte / sire said sire Lauayne he was
this day against king Arthur / and there he wanne the price of all the
knights of the round table / I have seen the day said the heremyte / I would
have loved him the werse / by cause he was against my lord king Arthur / for
sometime I was one of the felauship of the round table / but I thank god now I
am otherwise disposed / But where is he / let me see him / Then sir Lauayne
brought the heremyte to him

Capitulum xiij
ANd when the heremyte beheld him as he sat lenynge upon his sadel bow ever
bledynge pytously / and ever the knight heremyte thought that he should know
him but he could not bring him to knouleche / by cause he was so pale for
bledynge / what knight are ye said the heremyte / and where were ye borne / My
fair lord said sire Lancelot I am a stranger and a knight auenturous that
labors thur out many Realms for to win worship / Then the heremyte
aduysed him better / and saw by a wound on his cheke that he was sir Lancelot
/ Allas said the heremyte mine own lord why layne you your name from me / For
sothe I ought to know you of ryt / for ye are the most noblest knight of
the world / for well I know you for sire lancelot Sire said he sithe ye know
me / help me and ye may for gods sake / for I would be out of this pain at
ones / outher to death or to life / Have ye no doubt said the heremyte ye shall
live and fare right well / and so the heremyte called to him two of his
seruauytes / and so he and his servants bare him in to the hermytage / and
lyghtely unarmed him / and leyd him in his bed / And then anon the
heremyte staunched his blood and made him to drink good wyn so that sir
lancelot was well refresshed and knew him self / For in these days it was not
the guyse of heremytes as is now a days For there were none heremytes in tho
days but that they had been men of worship and of prowess / and tho heremytes
held great household / and refresshyd people that were in distress / Now torn
we unto king Arthur and leave we sir lancelot in the hermytage / So when the
kings were comen to gyders on both parties / and the great feeste should be
holden king Arthur asked the king of Northgalys and their felaushyp where was
that knight that bare the reed sleue / bring him before me that he may have
his lawde and honor and the price as it is right / Then spoke sir Galahad
the haute prince and the king with the honderd knights / we suppose that
knight is mescheued and that he is never like to see you nor none of us all /
and that is the grettest pity that ever we wyste of any knight / Allas said
Arthur how may this be / is he so hurt / what is his name said king Arthur /
Truly said they all we know not his name / nor from whens he came nor whyder he
would / Allas said the king this be to me the werst tidings that came to me
this seven year / For I would not for all the lands I welde to know and wete
it were so that that noble knight were slain / know ye him said they al / As
for that said Arthur / whether I know him or know him not / ye shall not know
for me what man he is but almighty ihesu send me good good tidings of him and
so said they all / By my head said sire Gawayn if it so be that the good
knight be so sore hurt / hit is great dommage and pity to all this land /
For he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw in a field handle a
spear or a suerd / And if he may be found I shall find him / For I am sure
he nys not f^r fro this town / bear you well said king Arthur / and ye may
find him onles that he be in such a plyte that he may not welde him self /
Ihesu defend said sir Gawayne / but wete I shall what he is and I may find
him / Right so sire Gawayne took a squire with him up on hakneis and rode al
about Camelot within vj or seven mile / but so he came again and could here
no word of him / Then within two days king Arthur and all the felaushyp
returned unto london again / And so as they rode by the way / hit happed sir
Gawayne at Astolat to lodge with sir Bernard / there as was sir Lancelot
lodged / and so as sire Gawayn was in his chamber to repose him / sir Barnard
the old Baron came unto him and his daughter Elayne to chere him and to ask
him what tidings and who did best at that turnement of wynchester / So god me
help said sire Gawayne there were two knights that bare two white sheldes /
but the one of hem bare a reed sleue upon his head / and certainly he was one
of the best knights that ever I saw Just in field / For I dare say said sire
Gawayne that one knight with the reed sleue smote down forty knights of the
table round / and his felawe did right well and worshypfully / Now blessid be
god said the fair maiden ^ of Astolat that that knight sped so well / for he
is the man in the world that I first loved / and truly he shall be last that
ever I shall love / / Now fair maid said sir Gawayne is that good knight
your love / Certainly sir said she / wete ye well he is my love / then know
ye his name said sire gawayne / Nay truly said the damoysel / I know not his
name nor from whens he comes / but to say that I love him I promise you and
god that I love him / how had ye knouleche of him first said sire Gawayne

Capitulum xiiij
Then she told him as ye have herd to fore / and houher fader betoke him her
brother to do him seruyse / and how her fader lent him her broders sir Tyrreis
shield / and here with me he left his own sheld / For what cause did he so
said sir Gawayne / For this cause said the damoysel / for his sheld was to well
known among many noble knights / A fair damoysel said sir Gawayne please hit
you let me have a syghte of that sheld / sire said she it is in my chamber
couerd with a caas / and if ye will come with me / ye shall see hit / Not so
said sire Barnard till his daughter let s^nde for it So when the sheld was
comen / sir Gawayne took of the caas / And when he beheld that sheld he knew
anon that hit was sir launcelots shield / and his own arms / A Ihesu mercy
said sir Gawayne now is my heart more heuyer than ever it was tofore / why said
Elayne / for I have great cause said sire Gawayne / is that knight that owes
this shield your love ye truly said she my love he is / god would I were his
love / So god me speed said sire Gawayne fair damoysel ye have right / for and
he be your love / ye love the most honorable knight of the world and the man
of most worship / So me thought ever said the damoysel / for never or that
time for no knight that ever I saw / loved I never none erst / God grant
said sire Gawayne that either of you may rejoice other / but that is in a
great adventure / But truly said sir gawayne unto the damoysel / ye may say ye
have a fair grace for why I have known that noble knight this four and twenty
year / and never or that day / I nor none other knight / I dare make good /
saw / nor herd say that ever he bare token or sign of no lady / gentilwoman
/ ne maiden at no Iustes nor turnement / And therefore fair maiden said sire
Gawayne ye ar much beholden to him to give him thanks / But I dread me said
sire Gawayne that ye shall never see him in this world / and that is great
pity / that ever was of erthely knight / Allas said she / how may this be / is
he slain / I say not so said sire Gawayne / but wete ye well / he is grievously
wounded by all manner of signs and by men's syghte more lykelyer to be deed
than to be on live / and wete ye well he is the noble knight sire lancelot /
for by this sheld I know him Allas said the fair maiden of Astolat / how may
this be / and what was his hurt / Truly said sire Gawayne the man in the world
that loved him best / hurt him so / and I dare say said sir Gawayne / and
that knight that hurt him knew the very certaynte that he had hurt sire
Lancelot / it would be the most sorrow that ever came to his heart / Now fair
fader said then Elayne I require you give me leave to ride and to seek him /
or else I wot well I shall go out of my mind / for I shall never stynte till
that I find him / and my brother sire Lauayne / Do as it lyketh you said her
fader / for me sore repents of the hurt of that noble knight Right so the
maid made her ready and before sire Gawayne making great dole / Then on the
morn sir Gawayne came to king Arthur / and told him how he had fond sire
Launcelots shield in the keeping of the fair maiden of Astolat / All that
knew I before hand said king Arthur and that caused me I would not suffer you
to have adoo at great Iustes / for I aspyed said king Arthur when he came in
till his lodging full late in the evening in Astolat / But merueille have I
said Arthur that ever he would bear any sign of any damoysel / For or now I
never herd say nor knew that ever he bare any token of none erthely woman / By
my head said sir Gawayne the fair maiden of Astolat loves him merueyllously
well / what it means I can not say / and she is ryden after to seek him / So
the king and all came to london / and there sire Gawayne openly disclosed to
all the Court that it was sire Lancelot that Iusted best

A sire Bors have ye herd say how falsely sir lancelot has bytrayed me / Allas
madame said sire Bors / I am aferd / he has bytrayed him self and us all / No

/ Madame said sir Bors I pray you say ye not so / for wete you well / I may
not here such langage of him / why sire Bors said she / should I not call him
traitor when he bare the reed sleue upon his head at wynchestre at the great
Iustes / Madame said sire Bors that sleeue beryng repents me sore / but I dar
say he did it to none euylle entente / but for this cause he bare the reed
sleue that none if his blood should know him / For or then we nor none of us
all never knew that ever he bare token or sign of maid / lady / ne
gentylwoman / Fie on him said the queen / yet for all his pride and bobaunce
there ye proved your self his better / Nay madame say ye never more so for he
beat me / and my felawes / and might have slain us and he had would / Fie on
him said the queen / For I herd sir Gawayne say before my lord Arthur that it
were merueil to tell the great love that is bitwene the fair maiden of
Astolat and him / Madame said sire Bors I may not warn sir Gawayne to say
what it pleasyd him / But I dare say as for my lord sire Lancelot that he
loves no lady gentil woman nor maid / but all he loves in like much / and
therefore madame said sir Bors / ye may say what ye will / but wete ye well I
will haste me to seek him / and find him where someuer he be / and god send
me good tidings of him / and so leave we them there / and speak we of sire
lancelot that lay in great peril / So as fair Elayne came to wynchestre /
she sought there al about / and by fortune sir Lauayne was ryden to play him
to enchauffe his horse / And anon as Elayne saw him she knew him / And then
she cried on loud until him / And when he herd her / anon he came to her /
and then she asked her brother how did my lord sire lancelot / who told you
sister that my lords name was sir Lancelot then she told him how sire
Gawayne by his sheld knew him / So they rode to gyders till that they came to
the hermytage / and anon she alyghte / So sir Lauayne brought her in to sire
lancelot / And when she saw him lie so seek and pale in his bed / she
might not speak / but suddenly she fell to the earth down suddenly in a swoun /
and there she lay a great while / And when she was releuyd / she stryked /
and said my lord sire Lancelot Allas why be ye in this plyte / and then she
swouned again / And then sir Lancelot prayed sire Lauayne to take her up /
and bring her to me / And when she came to her self sire Lancelot kyst her /
and said / Fair maiden why fare ye thus / ye put me to pain wherefore make ye
no more such chere / for and ye be come to comfort me / ye be ryt welcome /
and of this little hurt that I have I shall be right hastily hole by the grace

And then sir lancelot compast in his mind that sire Gawnyne would tell
Queen Gueneuer / how he bare the reed sleue / and for whom / that he wist well
would torn unto great anger / So this maiden Elayne never went from sir
lancelot / but watched him day and night / / and did such attendaunce to him
that the frensshe book says / there was never woman did more kyndelyer for man
than she / Then sir Lancelot prayed sir Lauayne to make aspyes in wynchestre
for sire Bors if he came there / and told him by what tokens he should know him

discolored / anon sir Bors lost his countenance / and for kyndenes and pity

might speak / he said thus / O my lord sire lancelot god you bliss / and send
you hasty recover / And full heavy am I of my mysfortune and of mine unhappiness /
for now I may call my self unhappy / and I dread me that god is gretely
displeased with me that he would suffer me to have such a shame for to hurt
you that are all our leder / and all our worship / and therefore I call my
self unhappy / Allas that ever such a caytyf knight as I am should have power
by unhappiness to hurt the most noblest knight of the world / where I so
shamefully set upon you and ouercharged you / and where ye might have slain
me ye saved me / and so did not I / For I and your blood did to you our
vtteraunce / I merueyle said sire Bors that my heart or my blood would serve me
/ wherefore my lord sir lancelot I ask your mercy / Fair cosyn said sire
Lancelot ye be right welcome / and wete ye well / over much ye say for to
please me / the which pleases me not / for why I have the same y sought / for
I would with pride have overcome you all / and there in my pride I was nere
slain / and that was in mine own defaute / for I might have give you warnyng
of my being there / And then had I had no hurt / for it is an old said
saw / there is hard bataille there as kynne and friends do bataille either
ageynste other / there may be no mercy but mortal war / Tlerfor fair cosyn
said sir lancelot / let this speech ouerpasse and all shall be welcome that
god sends and let us leave of this matter / and let us speak of sum
reioycynge / for this that is done may not be undone / and let us find a
remedy how soon that I may be hole / Then sire Bors lened upon his beds
side / and told sire Lancelot how the queen was passing wroth with him / by
cause he ware the reed sleue at the great Iustes / and there sir Bors told him
all how sir Gawayne discovered hit by your sheld that ye left with the fair
maiden of Astolat / Then is the queen wroth said sir lancelot / and therefore
am I right heavy / for I deserved no wrath / for all that I did was by cause I
would not be known / Right so excused I you said sir Bors but all was in vain
/ for she said more largelyer to me tha^ I to you now / But is this she said
sire Bors that is so besy about you / that men call the fair maiden of
Astolat / She it is said sire lancelot that by no means I can not put her
from me / why should ye put her from you said sire Bors / she is a passing
fair damoysel and a well bisene and well taught / and god would fair cosyn said
sire Bors that ye could love her / but as to that I may not / nor I dare not
counceyle you / But I see well said sir Bors by her dylygence about you that
she loves you entierly / that me repents said sir Lau^celot / sir said sir
Bors / she is not the first that has lost her pain upon you / and that is the
more pity / and so they talked of many moo things / And so within three days

Then sire Bors told sire lancelot how there was sworn a great turnement
and Iustes betwixe king Arthur and the king of Northgalys that should be upon
al halowmasse day beside wynchestre / is that truth said sir lancelot /
then shall ye abide with me still a little while until that I be hole / for I
feel my self right bygge and strong / Blessid be god said sir Bors / then
were they there nygh a month to gyders / and ever this maiden Elayn did ever
her dylygente labor night and day unto sir lancelot / that there was never
child nor wife more meker to her fader and husband than was that fair maiden of
Astolat / wherefore sir Bors was gretely pleasyd with her / So upon a day by
the assente of sir lancelot / sire Bors and sire lauayne they made the
heremyte to seek in woods for diverse herbs / and so sir lancelot made
fair Elayne to gadre herbs for him to make him a bayne / In the mean while
sir lancelot made him to arm him at all pyeces / and there he thought to
assaye his armor and his spear for his hurt or not And so when he was upon
his horse / he stered him fyersly / and the horse was passing lusty and fresshe
by cause he was not labored a month before / And then sir Lancelot couched
that spear in the reest / that courser lepte myghtely when he felt the spores
/ and he that was upon him the which was the noblest horse of the world
strayned him myghtely and stably / and kept stylle the spear in the reest /
and there with sire Lancelot strayned him self so straytly with so great
force to get the horse forward that the buttom of his wound brast both within
and without / and there with all the blood came out so fyersly that he felt
him self so feeble that he might not sytte upon his horse / And then sir
Lancelot cried unto sir Bors / A sir Bors and sir Lauayne help for I am come
to mine end / And there with he fell down on the one side to the earth like a
deed corpse / And then sir Bors and sir Lauayne came to him with sorrow making
out of mesure / And so by fortune the maiden Elayn herd their morning / and
then she came thither / and when she fond sir Lancelot there armed in that
place / she cried and wept as she had been wood / and then she kyst him /
and did what she might to awake him / And then she rebuked her brother and
sir Bors / and called hem falls traitors / why they would take him out of his

came the holy heremyte sir Bawdewyn of bretayne / And when he fond sir
lancelot in that plyte / he said but little / but wete ye well he was wroth /
and then he bad hem / let us have him in / And so they all bare him unto
the hermytage / and unarmed him / and laid him in his bed / and eu^r more his
wound bledde pytously / but he stered no lymme of him / Then the knight
heremyte put a thing in his nose and a little dele of water in his mouth / And
then sir lancelot waked of his swoune / and then ^he heremyte staunched
his bledynge / And when he might speak / he asked sir lancelot / why he put
his life in Ieopardy / Sir said sire Lancelot by cause I wend I had been
strong / and also sire Bors told me / that there should be at al halowmasse a
great Iustes betwixe king Arthur and the king of Northgalys / and therefore I
thought to assaye hit my self / whether I might be there or not / A sir
lancelot said the heremyte / your heart and your courage will never be done
until your last day / but ye shall do now by my counceylle / beat sire Bors
depart from you / and let him do at that turnement what he may / and by the
grace of god said the knight heremyte by that the turnement be done and ye

whom me ought to recommaunde me unto / and I pray you / enforce your self at
that Iustes that ye may be best for my love / and here shall I abide you at
the mercy of god till ye come again and so sir Bors departed and came to the
court of king arthur and told hem in what place he had left sir lancelot /
that me repents said the king / but syn he shall have his life we all may
thank god / and there sire Bors told the Queen in what Ieopardy sire Lancelot
was / when he would assaye his horse / and all that he did madame was for the
love of you / by cause he would have been at this turnement / Fie on him recreaunt
knight said the queen / For wete ye well I am right sorry and he shall have his
life / his life shall he have said sir Bors / and who that would other wise
except you madame / we that been of his blood should help to short their
lives / but madame said sir Bors ye have been oftymes displesyd with my lord sir
lancelot / but at all times at the end ye find him a true knight and so he
departed / And then every knight of the round table that were there at that
time present made them ready to be at that Iustes at all halowmasse and thither
drew many knights of diverse countries And as al halowemasse drew nere /
thydder came the king of Northgalys / and the king with the honderd knights
/ and sir Galahaut the haute prince of Surluse / and thydder came king
Anguysshe of Irland / and the king of Scotts / so these three kings came on
king Arthurs party / and so that day sire Gawayne did great deeds of arms /
and began first And the herowdes nombred that sir Gawayne smote down xx
knights / Then sir Bors de ganys came in the same time and he was nombred
that he smote down twenty knights / And therefore the price was given betwixe
them both / for they began first and lengest endured /

Also sir Gareth as the book says did that day great deeds of arms / for he
smote down and pulled down thyrtty knights / But when he had done these
deeds / he tarried not / but so departed / and therefore he lost his price / and
sir Palomydes did great deeds of arms that day / for he smote down twenty
knytes / but he departed suddenly / and men demed sire Gareth and he rode to
gyders to sum manner adventures / So when this turnement was done / sir Bors
departed / and rode till he same to sire lancelot his cosyn / and then he
fond him walking on his feet / and there either made great Joy of other / and
so sire Bors told sir lancelot of all the Iustes like as ye have herd / I
merueille said sir lancelot that sire Gareth when he had done such deeds of
arms that he would not tarry / thereof we merueyled al said sir Bors / for but
if it were you or sir Tristram or sire lamorak de galys I saw never knyt bear
down so many in so little a while as did sir Gareth / And anon as he was gone
we wyste not where / By my head said sir lancelot he is a noble knight / and
a mighty man / and well brethed / and if he were well assayed said sir Lancelot
/ I would deem he were good enough for any knight that bears the life / and he
is a gentyl knight / curtois / true / and bounteuous / meke and mylde / and in
him is no manner of male engyn / but plain / feythful and true / So then
they made hem ready to depart from the heremyte / and so upon a morn they took
their horses and Elayne le blank with them / And when they came to Astolat /
there were they well lodged and had great chere of sire Bernard the old baron /
and of sir Tyrre his sone / and so up on the morn when sir Lancelot should

For I report me to your self that my profer is fair / and me repents said

lord sir lancelot I could never depart from him nor naught I will and I may
follow him / Then sir Lancelot took his leave / and so they departed / and
came unto wynchestre / And when Arthur wyste that sir lancelot was come hole
and sound / the king maade great joy of him / and so did sir Gawayn and all
the knytes of the round table except sir Agrauayn and sire Mordred Also queen
Gueneuer was wood wroth with sir lancelot and would by no means speak with
him / but enstraunged her self from him / and sir lancelot made all the
means that he might for to speak with the queen / but hit would not be / Now
speak we of the fair maiden of Astolat that made such sorrow day and night
that / he never slepte / ete / nor drank / and ever she made her complaynt unto
sir L^uncelot / so when she had thus endured a ten days / that she febled so
that she must needs pass out of this world / then she shryued her clean /
and received her creatoure / And ever she complained stylle upon sire lancelot
/ Then her ghoostly fader bad her leave such thoughts / Then she said why
should I leave such thoughts / am I not an erthely woman / and all the while
the brethe is in my body I may complain me / for my believe is I do none
offense / though I love an erthely man / and I take god to my record I loved
never none but sir lancelot du lake nor never shall / and a clean maiden I am
for him and for all other / and sythen hit is the sufferaunce of god / that I
shall dye for the love of so noble a knight / I byseche the high fader of
heaven to have mercy upon my soul / and upon mine innumerable pains that I
suffered may be allygeaunce of part of my sins / For sweet lord Ihesu said
the fair maiden I take the to record / on the I was never great offenser
against thy laws / but that I loved this noble knight sire lancelot out of
mesure / and of my self good lord I might not withstand the fervent love
wherefore I have my death / And then she called her fader sire Bernard and her
brother sir Tyrre / and hertely she praid her fader that her brother might write
a letter like as she did endyte hit / and so her fader granted her / And when
the letter was written word by word like as she devised / Then she prayed her
fader that she might be watched until she were deed / and while my body is hot
/ let this letter be putt in my right hand / and my hand bound fast with the
letter until that I be cold / and let me be put in a fair bed with all
the rychest clothes that I have about me / and so let my bed and all my
rychest clothes be laid with me in a charyot unto the next place where Temse
is / and there let me be put within a barget / and but one man with me /
such as ye trust to stere me thither / and that my barget be couerd with blak
samyte over and over / Thus fader I byseche you let hit be done / so her
fader granted hit her feythfully / all thing should be done like as she had
devised / Then her fader and her brother made great dole / for when this was
done / anon she dyed / And so when she was deed / the corpse and the bed
all was led the next way unto Temse / and there a man and the corpse and all
were put in to Temse / and so the man styred the barget unto westmynster / and
there he rowed a great while to and fro or any aspyed hit

Capitulum xx
So by fortune king Arthur and the queen Gueneuer were speaking to gyders at
a wyndowe / and so as they looked in to Temse / they aspyed this blak barget /
and had merueylle what it mente / then the king called sire kay / and
showed hit him / Sir said sir kay wete you well there is some new tidings /
Goo thither said the king to sir kay / and take with you sire Brandyles and
Agrauayne / and bring me ready word what is there / Then these four knights
departed and came to the barget and went in / and there they fond the fairest
corpse lyenge in a rich bed and a pour man sittyng in the bargets end and
no word would he speak / So these four knights returned unto the king again
and told him what they fond / That fair corpse will I see said the king And
so then the king took the queen by the hand / and went thydder / Then the
king made the barget to be holden fast / and then the king and ye queen
entered with certain knytes with them / and there he saw the fairest woman lie
in a rich bed couerd unto her myddel with many rich clothes / and all was
of clothe of gold / and she lay as though she had smyled / Then the queen
aspyed a letter in her right hand / and told it to the king / Then the king
took it and said / now am I sure this letter will tell what she was / and why
she is come hydder / So then the king and the queen went out of the
barget / and so commanded a certain to wait upon the barget / And so when
the king was come within his chamber / he called many knights about him /
and said that he would wete openly what was written within that letter / then
the king brake it / and made a clerk to read hit / and this was the ^entente
of the letter / Most noble knight sir Lancelot / now has death made us two
at debate for your love I was your lover that men called the fair maiden of
Astolat / therefore unto all ladies I make my moan / yet pray for my soul and
bery me at leest / and offer ye my mass penny / this is my last request and a
clean maiden I dyed I take god to wytnes / pray for my soul sir lancelot as
thou art pierles / this was all the substance in the letter / And when it was
read / the king / the queen and all the knights wept for pity of the
doleful co^playntes / Then was sire Lancelot sent for / And when he was
come / king Arthur made the letter to be read to him / And when sire
lancelot herd hit word by word / he said my lord Arthur / wete ye well I am
right heavy of the death of this fair damoysel / god knows I was never causer
of her death by my willing / and that will I report me to her own brother /
here he is sir Lauayne / I will not say nay said sire Lancelot / but that
she was both fair and good / and much I was beholden unto her / but she
loved me out of mesure / Ye might have showed her said the queen sum bounte
and gentilnes that might have preserved her life / madame said sir lancelot /
she would none other ways be ansuerd / but that she would be my wife / outher else
my peramour / and of these two I would not grant her / but I proferd her for
her good love that she showed me a thousand pound yerly to her / and to her
heirs / and to wedde any manner knight that she could find best to love in
her heart / For madame said sir lancelot I love not to be constrained to love
/ For love must arise of the heart / and not by no constraynte / That is
troth said the king / and many knights love is free in him self / and never
will be bounden / for where he is bounden / he loses him self / Then said
the king unto sire Lancelot / hit will be your worship that ye over see that
she be entered worshypfully / Sire said sire Lancelot that shall be done as I
can best deuyse / and so many knights yede thither to behold that fair maiden
/ and so upon the morn she was entered rychely / and sir lancelot offryd her
mass penny / and all the knytes of the table round that were there at that time
offryd with sir lancelot / And then the pour man went again with the
barget / Then the queen sent for sir Lancelot / and prayed him of mercy /
for why that she had been wroth with him causeles / this is not the first time
said sir lancelot that ye have been displeased with me causeles / but madame
ever I must suffer you / but what sorrow I endure I take no force / So this
paste on all that winter with all manner of hunting and hauffyng / and
Iustes and torneyes were many betwixe many great lords / and ever in all places
sir Lauayne* gate great worship / so that he was nobly renomed among many
knights of the table round

Capitulum xxj
THus it past on till Crystmasse / And then every day there was Iustes made
for a dyamond / Who that Iusted best should have a dyamond / but sir lau^celot
would not Just but if it were at a great Iustes cried / but sir lauayne Iusted
there all that Crystemasse passyngly well / and best was praised / for there
were but few that did so well / wherefore all manner of knights demed that
sir lauayne should ^e made knight of the table round at the next feeste of
Pentecost / So at after Crystmasse king Arthur let call unto him many
knights / and there they aduysed to gyders to make a party and a great
turnement and Iustes / and the king of Northgalys said to Arthur / he would
have on his party king Anguysshe of Irland / and thekynge with the honderd
knights / and the king of Northumberland / and sire Galahad the haute prince
/ and so these four kings and this mighty duke took party against king
Arthur and the knyghte^ of the table round / and the cry was made that the day
of the Iustes should be beside westmynstre upon candylmas day whereof many
knights were glad / and made them ready to be at that Iustes in the freyssheyst
manner / Then queen Gueneuer sent for sir lancelot / and said thus I warn
you that ye ride ny more in no Iustes nor turnementys / but that your
kynnesmen may know you / And at thise Iustes that shall be ye shall have of
me a sleue of gold / and I pray you for my sake enforce your self there that
men may speak of you worship / but I charge you as ye will have my love that ye
warn your kynnesmen / that ye will bear that day the sleue of gold upon
your helmet / Madame said sir lancelot it shall be don / and so either made
great joy of other / And when sire Lancelot saw his time / he told sir Bors
that he would depart / and have no more with him but sir Lauayne unto the good
heremyte that dwellid in that forest of wyndsoore / his name was sire Brastias
/ and there he thought to repose him / and to take all the rest that he
might by cause he would be f^^sshe at that day of Iustes / So sire Lancelot
and sire Lauayne departed that no creature wist where he was become / but the
noble men of his blood / And when he was come to the hermytage / wete you well
he had good chere / and so daily sir lancelot would goo to a well fast by the
hermytage / and there he would lie down / and see the well spring and bu^byl
/ and sometime he slepte there / So at that time there was a lady dwellid in
that forest / and she was a great huntresse / and daily she used to hunte / and
ever she bare her bow with her / and no men went never with her / but always
wymmen / and they were shoters / and could well kylle a dear both at the stalk
and at the trest / and they daily bare bows and arowes / horns and wood
knyues / and many good dogs they had / both for the string and for a bate /
So hit happed this lady the huntresse had abated her dog for the bow at a
barayne hynde / and so this barayne hynde took the flyghte over hedges and
woods And ever this lady and part^ of her wymmen costed the hynde and chekked
it by the noise of the hounds to have met with the hynde at sum water /
and so hit happed the hynde came to the well where as sire lancelot was
slepyng and slomberynge / And so when the hynde came to the well / for hete
she went to soil / and there she lay a great while / and the dogs came
after / and vmbecast about / for she had lost the very parfyte feaute of the
hynde / Right so came that lady the huntres that knew by thy dog that she
had that the hynde was at the soil in that well / and there she came styfly
and fond the hynde / and she put a broad arowe in her bow / and shot at
hynde / and over ^hotte the hynde / and so by mysfortune the arowe smote sir
Lancelot in the thyck of the buttok over the ^arbys / when sir lancelot
felt him self so hurt / he hurled up woodely / and saw the lady that had
smyten him / And when he saw she was a woman / he said thus / lady / or
damoysel what that thou be / in an euylle time bare ye a bow / the deuylle
made you a shoter /

Capitulum xx
NOW mercy fair sir said the lady I am a gen tilwoman that uses here in this
forest hunting / and god knows I saw you not / but as here was a barayn
hynde at the soil in this well and I wend to have done well / but my hand
swarued / Allas said sire lancelot ye have mescheued me / and so the lady
departed / and sir lancelot as he might pulled out the arowe / and left
that head still in his buttok / and so he went weykely to the hermytage ever
more bledynge as he went / And when sir Lauayne and the heremyte aspyed that
sir lancelot was hurt / wete you well they were passing heavy / but sire
Lauayne wist not how that he was hurt nor by whom / And then were they
wroth out of mesure / then with great pain the heremyte gat out the arowes
head out of sir launcelots buttok / and much of his blood he shed / and the
wound was passing sore / and vnhappyly smyten / for it was in such a place
that he might not sytte in no sadyl / A mercy Ihesu said sir Lancelot I may
call my self the most vnhappyest man that lives for ever / when I would
faynest have worship / there befalls me ever sum unhappy thing / Now so
Ihesu me help said sir lancelot / and if no man would but god / I shall be in
the field upon candelmasse day at the Iustes what someuer fall of hit so
all that might be gotten to hele sir lancelot was had / So when the day was
come / sir lancelot let deuyse that he was arrayed / and sir Lauayne and their
horses as thou they had been sarazyns / and so they departed and came nygh to
the field / The king of Northgalys with an honderd knights with him / and the
king of Northumberland brought with him an honderd good knights / and king
Anguysshe of Irland brought with him an honderd good knights ready to Just /
and sir Galahalt the haute prince brought with him an honderd good knights /
and the king with the honderd knights brought with him as many / and all
these were proved good knights / Then came in king Arthurs party / and there
came in the king of Scotts with an honderd knights / and king Vryens of
Gore brought with him an honderd knights / And king Howel of Bretayne broute
with him an honderd knights / and Chalaunce of Claraunce brought with him an
honderd knights / and king Arthur him self came in to the field with two
honderd knights and the most party were knights of the table round that were
proved noble knights / / and there were old knights set in skaffoldes for
to Judge with the queen who did best /

Capitulum xxij
Then they blewe to the field / and there the king of northgalys encountered
with the king of scotts / and there the king of Scotts had a fall / and
the king of Irland smote down king Vryens / and the king of Northumberland
smote down king Howel of Bretayne / and sir Galahaut the haute prince smote
down Challenge of Claraunce / And then king Arthur was wood wroth / and
ran to the king with the honderd knytes / and there king Arthur smote him
down / and after with that same spear king Arthur smote down three other
knights / And then when his spear was broken / king Arthur did passyngly
well / and so there with all came in sir Gawayne and sir Gaheryse / sire
Agrauayne and sir mordred / and there eueryche of them smote down a knight /
and sir Gawayne smote down four knytes and then there began a strong
meddle / for then there came in the knights of launcelots blood / and sir
Gareth and sire Palomydes with them / and many knights of the table round /
and they began to hold the four kings and the mighty duke so hard that
they were discomfyte / but this duke Galahad the haut prince was a noble knight
/ and by his mighty prowess of arms / he held the knights of the table
round s^^ayte enough / All this doing saw sir lancelot / and then he came
in to the field with sir Lauayne as hit had been thonder / And then anon sire
Bors and the knights of his blood aspyed sir lancelot / and said to them all
I warn you beware of him with the sl^ue of gold upon his head / for he is him
self sir lancelot du lake / and for great goodenes si Bors warned sir Gareth /
I am well apayed said sir Gareth that I may know him / but who is he said they
all that rydeth with him in the same array / That is the good and gentyl knight
sir Lauayne said sir Bors / So sire Lancelot encou^tred with sir Gawayne /
and there by force sir lancelot smote down sir Gawayne and his horse to the
earth / and so he smote down sir Agrauayne and sire Gaherys / and also he
smote down sir Mordred / and all this was with one spear

Then sir Lauayne met with sir Palomydes / and either met other so hard
and so fyersly that both their horses fell to the earth / And then were
they horsed again / and then met sir Lancelot with sir Palomydes / and
there sire Palomydes had a fall / and so sir lancelot or ever he stynte as
fast as he might get speres / he smote down thyrtty knights and the most
party of them were knytes of the table round and ever the knights of his blood
withdrewe them / and made hem adoo in other places where sir lancelot came not
/ and then king Arthur was wroth ^^an he saw sir Lancelot do such deeds
/ and then the king called unto him sir gawayn sir Mordred / sir kay / sir
Gryflet / sir Lucan the butteler / sire Pedeuer / sir Palomydes / Sir Safyr his
brother / and so the king with these nine knights made hem ready to set upon
sir Lancelot / and upon sir Lauayne / All this aspyed sir bors and sir Gareth
/ Now I dread me sore said sir Bors that my lord sir lancelot will be hard
matched / By my head said sir Gareth I will ride unto my lord sir lancelot
for to help him / fall of him what fall may / for he is the same man that
made me knight / ye shall not so said sir Bors by my counceylle / onles that
ye were desguysed / ye shall see me dysguysed said sire Gareth / and there
with all he aspyed a walysshe knight where he was to repose him / and he was
sore hurt before hurt by sir Gawayne / and to him sire Gareth rode / and praid
him of his knyghthode to lene him his shield for his / I will well said the
walysshe knight / And when sir Gareth had his shield / the book says / it
was grene with a maiden that seemed in hit / Then sir Gareth came dryuynge to
sir Lancelot all that he might / and said knight keep thy self / for yonder
comes king Arthur with nine noble knytes with him to put you to a rebuke /
and so I am come to bear you felaushyp for old love ye have showed me /
Gramercy said sir lancelot / sir said sir Gareth / encountre ye with sir
Gawayne / and I shall encountre with sire Palomydes / and let sir Lauayne
match with the noble king Arthur / And when we have delyuerd hem / let us
three hold us sadly to gyders / Then come king Arthur with his nine knytes
with him / and sir lancelot encountered with sir Gawayne / and gafe him such a
buffet / that the arson of his sadel brast / and sire Gawayne fell to the
earth / Then sir Gareth encountered with the good knight sir Palomydes / and
he gaf him such a buffet that both his horse and he dasshed to the earth /
Then encountered king Arthr with sire Lauayne / and there either of hem smote
other to the earth horse and all that they lay a great while / Then sir
lancelot smote down sir Agrauayne and sire Gaheryse / and sir Mordred / and
sir Gareth smote down sir kay / and sir Safyr and sir Gryflet / And then sir
lauayne was horsed again / and he smote down sire Lucan the butteler and sir
Bedeuer / and then there began great thrange of good knights / Then sire
Lancelot hurtlyd here and there / and racyd and pulled of helmes / so that at
that time there might none sytte him a buffet with spear nor with suerd / and
sir Gareth did such deeds of arms that all men merueylled what knight he was
with the grene sheld / For he smote down that day and pulled down moo than
thyrtty knights / And as the frensshe book says sir Lancelot merueylled when
he beheld sir Gareth do such deeds what knight he might be / and sir
Lauayne pulled down and smote down twenty knights / Also sir lancelot knew
not sir Gareth / for and sir Tristram de lyones / outher sir lamorak de galys
had been alive / sir lancelot would have demed he had been one of them tweyne /
So ever as sir lancelot / sir Gareth / sir lauayn faughte / and on the one
side sir bors sir Ector de marys / sir lyonel / sir lamorak de galys / sir
bleoberys / sir Galyhud / sir Galyhodyn / sir Pelleas / and with moo other of
king Bans blood fought upon another party and held the king with the
honderd knights and the king of Northumberland right strayte /

Capitulum xxiiij
So this turnement and this Iustes dured long / till hit was nere night / for
the knights of the round table releued ever unto king Arthur / for the king
was wroth out of mesure / that he and his knights might not prevail that
day / Then sire Gawayne said to the king I merueile where all this day sir
Bors de ganys and his felaushyp of sire launcelots blood / I merueylle all this
day they be not about you / hit is for sum cause said sir Gawayne / By my
head said sire Kay sire Bors is yonder all this day upon the right hand of
this field / and there he and his blood done more worshypfully than we do / it
may well be said sir Gawayne / but I dread me ever of gyle / for on pain of my
life said sir Gawayne this knight with the reed sleue of gold is him self sir
lancelot / I see well by his riding / and by his great strokes / and the other
knight in the same colors is the good young knight sir lauayne / Also that
knight with the grene shield is my brother sir Gareth / and yet he has
desguysed him self / for no man shall never make him be against sir lancelot
by cause he made him knight / By my head said Arthur neuewe I believe you /
therefore tell me now what is your best counceyll / Sir said sir Gawayne ye
shall have my counceylle / let blow unto lodging / for and he be sir
Lancelot du lake and my brother sir Gareth with him with the help of that good
young knight sir Lauayne / trust me truly it will be no bote to strive with
them / but if we should fall ten or xij upon one knight / and that were no
worship but shame / ye say truth said the king / and for to say sothe said
the king it were shame to us / so many as we be to set upon them any more /
for wete ye well said king Arthur / they ben three good knights / and namely
that knight with the sleue of gold / So then they blewe unto lodgyng / but
forth with all King Arthur let send unto the four kings / and to the mighty
duke / and praid hem that the knight with the sleue of gold depart not fro
them / but that the king may speak with him / Then fourth with all king
Arthur alighte and unarmed him / and took a litill hakney / and rode after sir
Lancelot / for ever he had a spy upon him / and so he fond him among the
four kings / and the duke / and there the king prayed ^em all unto souper /
and they said they would with good will / And when they were unarmed / then
king Arthur knew sire lancelot / sir Lauayne and sir Gareth / A sire
Lancelot said king Arthur / this day ye have heted me / and my knights /
so they yede unto Arthurs lodging al to gyder / and there was a great feast
and great revel / and the price was given unto sir lancelot / and by he rowdes
they named him / that he had smyten down fyfty knights / and sire Gareth five
and thyrtty / and sir Lauayne four and twenty knights / Then sir Lancelot
told the king and the Queen how the lady huntresse shote him in the foreste of
wyndesoore in the buttok with a brood arowe / and how the wound thereof was that
time six Inches deep / and in like long / Also Arthur blamed sir Gareth by
cause he left his felaushyp / and held with sir lancelot / My lord said sir
Gareth / he maade me a knight / And when I saw him so hard bestadde / me
thought it was my worship to help him / for I saw him do so much / and so
many noble knights against him / and when I understood that he was sir
lancelot du lake / I shamed to see so many knights against him alone / Truly
said king Arthur unto sire Gareth ye say well and worshypfully have ye done
and to your self great worship / and all the days of my life said king Arthur
unto sir Gareth wete you well I shall love you / and trust you the more better
For ever said Arthur hit is a worshypful knights deed to help an other
worshypful knight when he sees him in a great danger / for ever a
worshipful man will be loathe to see a worshipful shamed / and he that is of no
worship and fares with cowardyse / never shall he show gentilnes / nor no
manner of goodness where he sees a man in any danger / for then ever will a
coward show no mercy / and always a good man will do ever to another man as
he would ben done to him self / So then there were great feestes unto kings
and dukes / and ^^uel / game and play / and al manner of noblesse was used /
and he that was curt^is / true and feythful to his friend was that time
cherysshed

Capitulum xxv
ANd thus it past on from candylmas until after ester that the month of may
was come / when every lusty heart begins to blosomme / and to bring forth
fruit / for like as herbs and trees bryngen forth fruit and florysshen in
may / in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a lover spryngeth and
floryssheth in lusty deeds / For it gives unto al lovers courage that lusty
month of may in some thing to constrayne him to some manner of thing more in
that month than in any other month for diverse causes / For then all
herbs and trees renewen a man and woman / and in like wise lovers callen
again to their mind old gentilnes and old seruyse and many kind deeds that
were forgeten by neclygence / For like as winter rasure does always a raze and
deface grene somer / so fares it by unstable love in man and woman / For in
many persons there is no stabylyte / For we may see al day for a little blast of
wynters rasure anon we shall deface and lay a part true love / for little or
naught that cost much thing / this is no wisdom nor stabylyte / but it is
feebleness of nature and great disworshyp who someuer uses this / Therefore like
as may month floreth and floryssheth in many gardyns / So in like wise let
every man of worship florysshe his heart in this world / first unto god / and
next unto the joy of them that he promised his feythe unto / for there was
never worshypful man nor worshipful woman / but they loved one better than
another / and worship in arms may never be foiled / but first reserve the
honor to god / and secondly the quarrel must come of thy lady / and such love
I call virtuous love / but now a days men can not love seven nyte but they
must have all their desires that love may not endure by reason / for where
they ben soon accorded and hasty hete / soon it keleth / Right so fares
love now a days / sone hot soon cold / this is no stabylyte / but the old
love was not so / men and wymmen could love to gyders seven years / and no
lycours lusts were bitwene them / and then was love truth and feythfulnes
/ and loo in like wise was used love in king Arthurs days / wherefore I lyken
love now adays unto somer and winter / for like as the one is hot / and the
other cold / so fares love now a days / therefore all ye that be lovers /
call unto your remembrance the month of may / like as did queen Gueneuer /
For whom I make here a little mencyon that while she lived / she was a true
lover / and therefore she had a good end

Explicit liber Octodecimus /
And here follows liber xix /
Capitulum primum
So it befelle in the month of May / queen Gueneuer called unto her knytes of
the table round / and she gafe them warning that erly upon the morrow she would
ride on mayeng in to woods and feldes beside westmynstre / and I warn you
that there be none of you but that he be well horsed / and that ye all be
clothed in grene outher in sylke outher in clothe and I shall bring with me
ten ladies / and every knight shall have a lady behind him / and every
knight shall have a squire and two yomen / and I will that ye all be well
horsed / So they made hem ready in the fresshest manner / and these were the
names of the knights / sir Kay the Seneschal / sir Agrauayne / sir Brandyles /
sir Sagramor le desyrus / Sir Dodynas le saueage / sir Ozanna le cure hardy /
sir Ladynas of the forest saueage / sir Persaunt of Inde / sire Ironsyde that
was called the knight of the reed laundes / and sire Pelleas the lover / and
these ten knights made hem ready in the fresshest manner to ride with the queen
/ And so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen / and rode on
mayenge in woods and meadows as hit pleasyd hem in great Joy and delytes /
for the queen had cast to have been again with king Arthur at the ferthest by
ten of the clok / and so was that time her purpoos / Then there was a
knight that hyghte Mellyagraunce / and he was sone unto king Bagdemagus / and
this knight had at that time a castle of the yefte of king arthur within seven
mile of westmynstre / And this knight sir Mellyagraunce loved passing well
Queen Gueneuer / and so had he done long and many years / And the book says
he had layne in a wait for to stele away the queen / but evermore he forbear
for by cause of sir lancelot / for in no wise he would meddle with the queen /
and sir Lancelot were in her company / outher else and he were nere hand her /
and that time was such a customme / the queen rode never without a great
felaushyp of men of arms about her / and they were many good knights / and
the most party were young men that would have worship / and they were called the
queen's knights and never in no batail / turnement / nor Iustes / they bare
none of hem no manner of knoulechynge of their own arms / but plain white
sheldes / and there by they were called the queen's knights / And then when
it happed any of them to be of great worship by his noble deeds / then at the
next feast of Pentecost / if there were any slain or deed / as there was none
year that there failed / but sum were deed / Then was there chosen in his
stead that was deed the most men of worship that were called the queen's
knights / And thus they came up all first or they were renoumed men of
worship / both sire Lancelot and all the remenaunt of them / But this knyte
sir Mellyagraunce had aspyed the queen well and her purpos and how sir
lancelot was not with her / and how she had no man of arms with her but the
ten noble knights all arrayed in grene for mayeng / then he purueyed him a xx
men of arms and an honderd archers for to destroy the queen and her knights
/ for he thought that time was best season to take the queen /

So as the queen had mayed and all her knights / all were bedasshed with
herbys mosses and flowers in the best manner and fresshest / Right so came out
of a wood sire Mellyagraunce with an eyghte score men well harnysed as they
should fight in a batail of a reeste and had the queen and her knights abide /
for maulgre their hedes they should abide / Traytoure knight said queen
Gueneuer what cast thou for to do / wolte thou shame thy self / bethynke the
how thou art a kings sone / and knight of the table round and thou to be
about to dishonor the noble king that made the knight / thou shamest all
knyghthode and thy self / and me I let the wete shalt thou never shame / for
I had lever cut mine own throat in tweyne rather than thou sholdest
dishonor me / As for all this langage said sir Mellyagraunce be it as it be
may / for wete you well madame I have loved you many a year / and never or now
could I get you at such an advantage as I do now / and therefore I will take
you as I find you / then spoke all the ten noble knights at ones and said
/ Sir Mellyagraunce wete thou well ye ar about to Ieoparde your worship to
dishonor / and also ye sast to Ieoparde our persons / how be it we ben
unarmed / ye have us at a great avail / for hit seems by you that ye have
laid watch upon us / but rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and
us all / we had as leef to depart from our lives / for and if we other ways
did / we were shamed for ever Then said sir Mellyagraunce dress you as well
as ye can / and keep the Queen / Then the ten knights of the table round
drew their swerdes / and the other let run at them / with their speres /
and the ten knights manly abode them / and smote awey their speres / that no
spear did them none harm Then they lasshed to gyder with swerdes / and anon
sire Kay / sir Sagramor / sir Agrauayn / sir Dodynas / sir Ladynas and sir
Ozanna were smyten to the earth with grymly wounds / Then sir Brandyles and
sir Persaunt of Ironsyde / sire Pelleas fought long / and they were sore
wounded / for these ten knights or ever they were laid to the ground slew xl
men of the boldest and the best of them / So when the Queen saw her knights
thus dolefully wounded / and needs must be slain at the last / then for pity
and sorrow she cried sir Mellyagraunce slay not my noble knights / and I will
go with the upon this covenant that thou save hem / and suffer hem not to be
no more hurt with this that they be led with me where someuer thou ledest me
/ for I will rather slay my self than I will goo with the / onles / that
these my noble knights may be in my presence / Madame said Mellyagrau^ce for
your sake they shall be led with you in to mine own Castle with that ye
will be ruled and ride with me / Then the queen prayed the four knights to
leave their fighting / and she and they would not depart / Madame said sir
Pelleas we will do as ye do / for as for me I take no force of my life nor
death / For as the Frensshe book says sir Pelleas gaf such buffets there that
none armor might hold him /

Capitulum Tercium
Then by the queen's commandment they left batail and dressid the wounded
knights on horsbak some syttyng sum ouerthwarte their horses / that hit was
pity to behold them / And then sir Mellyagraunce charged the queen and al
her knights that none of al her felaushyp should depart from her / for full
sore he dradde sir lancelot du lake lest he should have any knoulechynge / All
this aspyed the Queen / and pryuely she called unto her a child of her chamber
that was swyftly horsed to whom she said / Go thou when thou see thy time /
and here this ring unto sir lancelot du lake / and pray him as he loves me
that he will see me / and rescowe me if ever he will have Joy of me / and
spare not thy horse said the queen nouther for water neither for land / So the
child aspyed his time / and lyghtely he took his horse with the spores and
departed as fast as he might / And when sir Mellyagraunce saw him so flee /
he understood that hit was by the queen's commandment for to warn sir
lancelot / Then they that were best horsed chaced him and shot at him / But
from hem all the child went suddenly / and then sire Mellyagraunce said to
the queen / Madame ye are about to bitraye me / but I shall ordeyne for sir
lancelot that he shall not come lyghtely at you / And then he rode with her
and they all to his castle in all the haste that they might / And by the
way sire Mellyagraunce laid in an enbusshement the best archers that he might
get in his country to the nombre of a thyrtty to awayte upon sir Lancelot
chargyng them that if they saw such a manner of knight come by the way upon
a white horse that in any wise they slay his horse / but in no manner of wise
have not adoo with him bodyly / for he is over hard to be ouercomen / So this
was done / and they were comen to his castle / but in no wise the queen would
never let none of the ten knights and her ladies out of her syghte / but
always they were in their presence / for the book says sir Mellyagraunce
durst make no maystryes for dread of sir lancelot in so much he demed that
he had warning / So when the child was departed from the felauship of sir
Mellyagraunce within a while he came to westmynstre / And anon he fond sir
lancelot / And when he had told his message / and delyuerd him the queen's
ring / Allas said sir Lancelot now am I shamed for ever onles that I may
rescowe that noble lady from dishonor / then egerly he asked his armor /
and ever the child told sir lancelot how the ten knights fought
merueyllously / and how sir Pelleas and sire Ironsyde and sir Brandyles and sir
Persaunt of Inde fought strongly / but namely sir Pelleas / there might none
withsta^de him / and how they all foute till at the last they were laid to the
earth / and then the queen made apoyntement for to save their lives / and goo
with sir Mellyagraunce / Allas said sir Lancelot / that most noble lady that
she should be so destroyed / I had lever said sir lancelot than all France
that I had been there were well armed / So when sire lancelot was armed / and
upon his horse / he prayed the child of the Queen's chamber to warn sir Lauayne
how suddenly he was departed / and for what cause / and pray him as he loves
me that he will hyhe him after me / and that he stynte not until he come to
the castle where sir Mellyagraunce abides / or dwells / for there said sire
lancelot he shall here of me / and I am a man living / and res^owe the queen
and the ten knytes the which he traitoursly has taken / and that shall I
preue upon his head and all them that hold with him /

Capitulum iiij
Then sir lancelot rode as fast as he might / and the book says / he took
the water at westmynstre bridge / and made his horse to swymme over Temse unto
lambehythe / And then within a while he came to the same place there as the
ten noble knights fought with sire Mellyagraunce And thanne sir lancelot
followed the trak until that he came to a wood / and there was a strayte way /
and there the xxx archers bad sir lancelot torn again / and follow no
longer that trak / what commandment have ye there to said sir lancelot to
cause me that am a knight of the round tuble to leave my right way / This way
shalt thou love / outher else thou shall goo it on thy foot / for wete thou
well thy horse shall be slain / that is little maystry said sire lancelot to
slay mine horse / but as for my self when my horse is slain I give right naught
for you / not and ye were five honderd moo / So then they shot sir launcelots
horse / and smote him with many arowes / and then sir lancelot avoided his
horse / and went on foot / but there were so many dyches and hedges betwixe
them and him that he might not meddle with none of hem / Allas for shame said
lancelot that ever one knight should bitraye another knight / but hit is an old
saw / a good man is never in danger / but when he is in the danger of a
coward / Then sir lancelot went a while / and then he was foul combred
of his armor / his sheld and his spear and all that longed unto him / wete ye
well he was full sore annoyed / and full both he was for to leave any thing that
longed unto him / for he drad sore the treason of sir Mellyagrau^ce Then by
fortune there came by him a charyot that came thither for to fetch wood / Say me
carter said sir lancelot what shall I give the to suffer me to lepe in to thy
charyot / and that thou bring me unto a castle within this two mile / thou
shall not come within my charyot said the carter / for I am sent for to fetch
wood for my lord sir Mellyagraunce / with him would I speak / thou shall not go
with me said the carter / then sir lancelot lept to him / and gaf him such
a buffet that he fell to the earth stark deed / then the other carter his
felawe was a ferde and wend to have gone the same way / and then he cried
fair lord save my life / and I shall bring you where ye will / then I charge
the said sir lancelot that thou drive me and this charyot even unto sir
Melliagaunce yate / lepe up in to the charyot said the carter / and ye shall
be there anon / So the carter drofe on a great wallop / and sir launcelots
horse followed the charyot with more than a xl arowes broad and rough in him /
and more than an hour and an half dame Gueneuer was awaytynge in a bay wyndowe
with her ladies / and aspyed an armed knight standing in a charyot / See
madame said a lady where rydeth in a charyot a goodly armed knight / I suppose
he rydeth unto hangyng / where said the queen / then she aspyed by his shield
that he was there him 'self sir lancelot du lake / And then she was ware
where came his horse ever after that charyot / and ever he trade his guts and
his paunche under his feet / Allas said the queen now I see well and preue that
well is him that has a trusty friend / Ha a most noble knight said queue
Gueneuer I see well thou art hard bestad when thou rydest in a charyot / then
she rebuked that lady that lykend sir lancelot to ride in a charyot to
hanging / hit was foul mouthed said the queen and euylle lykened so for to
lyken the most noble knight of the world unto such a shameful death / O Ihesu
defend him and keep him said the queen from all mescheuous end / By this was
sir Lancelot comen to the gates of that Castle / and there he descended down
and cried that all the Castle range of it where art thou falls traitor sir
Melliagraunce and knight of the table round / now come forth here thou traitor
knyte thou and thy felauship with the / For here I am sir lancelot du lake
that shall fight with you / and there with all he bare the gate wide open upon
the porter / and smote him under his ere with his gauntelet that his neck brast
in sonder /

Capitulum v
When sir Mellyagrau^ce herd that sir Lancelot was there / he ran unto
queen Gueneuer / and fell upon his knee / and said mercy madame now I put me
holy in to your grace / what eyleth you now said queen Gueneuer / For sothe I
might well we^e sum good knyt would revenge me / though my lord Arthur wyste
not of this your work / Madame said sir Mellyagraunce / all this that is
amys on my part shall be amended right as your self will deuyse / and holy
I put me in your grace / what would ye that I did said the queen / I would no
more said Mellyagraunce but that ye would take all in your own hands / and
that ye will rule my lord sir lancelot / and such chere as may be made him
in this pour castle ye and he shall have until to morn / and then may ye
and all they return unto wesimynster / and my body and all that I have I shall
put in your rule / ye say well said the queen / and hetter is pee^ than ever
werre / and the less noise / the more is my worship / then the queen and her
ladies went down unto the knight sir lancelot / that stood wroth out of
mesure in the Inner court to abide bataille / and ever he had thou traitor
knight come forth Then the queen came to him and said sire Lancelot why be
ye so mo^ued / Ha madame said sire Lancelot why ask ye me that question / Me
seems said sir lancelot ye out to be more wroth than I am / for ye have the
hurt and the dishonor / For wete ye well madame my hurt is but little for the
killing of a mares sone / but the despyte greueth me much more / than all my
hurt / truly said the queen ye say troth but hertely I thank you said the
queen / but ye must come in with me peasyble / for all thing is put in my hand
/ and all that is euylle shall be for the best / for the knight full sore
repents him of the mysauenture that is befallen him / Madame said sire
Lancelot / sith it is so that ye ben accorded with him / as for me I may not
be ageyn it / how be it sir Mellyagraunce has done full shamefully to me and
cowardly / A madame said sir Lancelot / and I had wist ye would have been so
soon accorded with him / I would not have made such haste unto you / why say
ye so said the queen / do ye forthynke your self of your good deeds / wete
you well said the Queen I accorded never unto him for favor nor love that I
had unto him / but for to lay down every shameful noise

Madame said sir lancelot ye understand full well I was never willing nor
glad of shameful sklaunder nor noise And there is neither king / queen ne
knight that bears the life except my lord king Arthur and you madame should
let me / but I should make sir Mellyagraunce heart full cold / or ever I
departed from hens / That wot I well said the queen / but what will ye more ye
shall have all thing ruled as ye list to have it / Madame said sir lancelot
/ so ye be pleasyde I care not / as for my part ye shall soon please / right
so the queen took sir lancelot by the bare hand / for he had put of his
gauntelet / and so she went with him till her chamber and then she
commanded him to be unarmed / and then sir lancelot asked where were the
ten knights that were wounded fore / so she showed them unto sir lancelot /
and there they made great Joy of the coming of him / and sir lancelot made
great dole of their hurtes and bewailed them gretely / and there sir lancelot
told them how cowardly and traytourly Mellyagraunce fette archers to slay his
horse / and how he was feign to put him self in a charyot / thus they
complained eueryche to other / and full fayn they would have been reuengid but
they peaced them self by cause of the Queen / Then as the Frenssh book says
/ sir lancelot was called many a day after le cheualer du charyot / and did
many deeds and great adventures he had / and so leave we of this tale le
Cheualer du Charyot and torn we to this tale / So sir Lancelot had great
chere with the queen / and then sir lancelot made a promys with the queen
that the same night sir lancelot should come to a wyndowe outward toward a
gardyn / and that wyndowe was y bareyd with iron / and there sir lancelot
promised to mete her when all folks were on sleep / So then came sir
lauayne dryuynge to the gates cryeng where is my lord sir lancelot du lake /
then was he sent for / and when sir lauayne saw sir Lancelot / he said my
lord I fond well how ye were hard bestad / for I have fond your horse that was
slain with arowes / As for that said sir lancelot I pray you sir Lauayne
sprke ye of other matters / and let ye this pass / and we shall right hit
another time when we best may

Capitulum vj
Then the knights that were hurt were serched / and soft salues were leyd
to their wounds / and so hit past on till souper time / and all the chere
that might be made them / there was done unto the queen and all her knytes /
then when season was / they went unto their chambres but in no wise the
queen would not suffer the wounded knytes to be fro her / but that they were
laid within draughtes by her chamber upon beds and pylowes that she her self
might see to them that they wanted no thing / So when sir lancelot was in
his chamber that was assygned unto him / he called unto him sire Lauayne / and
told him that night he must goo speak with his lady dame Gueneuer / Sir said
sir Lauayne / let me goo with you and hit please you / for I dread me sore of
the treason of sir Mellyagraunce / Nay said sir lancelot I thank you / but I
will have no body with me / then sir Lancelot took his suerd in his hand /
and pryuely went to a place where he had aspyed a ladder to fore hand / and
that he took under his arm / and bare it through the gardyn / and set it up
to the wyndowe / and there anon the queen was ready to mete him / and then
they made either to other their complayntes of many diverse things / and
then sir lancelot wysshed that he might have comen in to her / wete ye well
said the queen / I would as feign as ye / that ye might come in to me would ye
madame said sire lancelot with your heart that I were with you / ye truly
said the queen / Now shall I prove my might said sir Lancelot for your love /
and then he set his hands upon the bars of iron / and he pulled at them
with such a might that he brast hem clean out of the stone walls / and
there with all one of the bars of iron kytte the braune of his hands through
out to the bone / and then he lepte in to the chamber to the queen / make ye
no noise said the queen / for my wounded knights lie here fast by me / So to
pass upon this tale sir Lancelot went unto bed with the queen / and he took
no force of his hurt hand / but took his plesau^ce and his liking until it
was in the daunynge of the day / and wete ye well he slepte not but watched /
and when he saw his time that he might tarry no longer / he took his leave and
departed at the wyndowe / and put hit to gyder as well as he might again and
so departed unto his own chamber / and there he told sir Lauayne how he was
hurt / then sir lauayn dressid his hand and staunched it / and put upon it
a glove that it should not be aspyed / and so the queen lay long in her bed
until it was nine of the clok / then sir Mellyagraunce went to the queen's
chamber / and fond her ladies there ready clothed / Ihesu mercy said sir
Mellyagraunce what eyleth you madame that ye sleep thus long / and right there
with all he opened the curteyn for to behold her / and then was he ware
where she lay and all the shete and pylowe was bebled with the blood of sir
Lancelot and of his hurt hand / when sir mellyagraunce aspyed that blood /
then he demed in her that she was falls to the king / and that some of the
wounded knights had layne by her all that night / A madame said sir
Mellyagraunce / now I have founden you a falls traytresse unto my lord Arthur /
For now I prove well it was not for naught that ye laid these wounded knights
within the bands of your chamber / therefore I will call you of treason
before my lord king Arthur / and now I have proved you madame with a shameful
deed / and that they ben all falls or sum of them I will make good / for a
wounded knight this night has layne by you / That is false said the Queen and
that I will report me unto them all / then when the ten knights herd sir
Mellyagraunce words / they spak al in one voys and said to sire Mellyagraunce
thou say falsely / and wrongfully put upon us such a deed / and that we
will make good any of us chese which thou list of us when we are hole of our
wounds / ye shall not said sir Mellyagraunce away with your proud langage / for
here ye may all see said sir Mellyagraunce that by the queen this night a
wounded knight has layne / then were they al ashamed when they saw that
blood / and wete you well sir Mellyagraunce was passing glad that he had the
queen at such an advantage / For he demed by that to hyde his treson / so
with this ramoure came in sir lancelot and fond them al at a great array /

Capitulum septimum
WHat array is this said sir Lancelot / then sir mellyagraunce told hem what
he had fond and showed hem the queen's bed / Truly said sir lancelot ye did
not your part nor knytly to touch a queen's bed while it was drawn / and she
lyeng therein / for I dar say my lord Arthur him self would not have displayed
her courteyns she being within her bed / onles that it had pleasyd him to have
layne down by her / and therefore ye have done vnworshipfully and shamefully to
your self I wot not what ye mean said sir Mellyagraunce / but well I am sure
there has one of her wounded knytes layne by her this nyte / and therefore I will
prove with my hands that she is a traytresse unto my lord Arthur / beware what
ye do said lancelot / for and ye say so and ye will preue it / it will be taken
at your hands / My lord sir Lancelot said sire Mellyagraunce I read you
beware what ye do / for thou ye are never so good a knight as ye wot well ye ar
renomed the best knyt of the world yet should ye be aduysed to do batail in a
wrong quarrel / for god will have a streke in every batail / As for that said sir
lancelot god is to be drad / but as to that I say nay plainly / that this
nyte there lay none of these ten wounded knytes with my lady queen Gueneuer /
and that will I preue with my hands that ye say untruly in that now / Hold said
sir Mellyagraunce here is my glove that she is traytresse unto my lord king
Arthur / and that this night one of the wounded knytes lay with her / and I
receive your glove said sir Lancelot / and so they were sealyd with their
sygnettys / and delyuerd unto the x knytes At what day shall we do batail to
gyders said sir lancelot / this day viij days said sir Mellyagraunce in the
field beside westmynstre / I am agreed said sir Lancelot / but now said sir
mellyagraunce / sythen it is so that we must fyte to gyders I pray you as ye be
a noble knyt awayte me with no treason / nor none vylony the mean while / nor
none for you / so god me help said sir lancelot ye shall ryte well wete I was
never of no such condycyons / for I report me to al knytes that ever have
known me I ferd never with no treason / nor I loved never the felauship of no
man that ferde with treson / Then let us go to dinner seid melliagrau^ce. and
after dinner ye and ye queen and ye may ride all to westmester / I will well
said sir lau^celot / then sir Mellyagraunce said to sir lancelot pleases it
you to see the estures of this castle / with a good will said sir Lancelot /
and then they went to gyders from chamber to chamber / for sir Lancelot
drad no peryls / for ever a man of worship and of prowess / dredeth lest
always perils / For they wene every man be as they ben / But ever he that
fares with treason puts often a man in great danger / So it befell upon sir
lancelot that no peril dredde / as he went with sire Mellyagraunce he trade
on a trap and the board rollyd / and there sir Lancelot fell down more than
ten fadom in to a cave full of straw / and then sir Mellyagraunce departed
and made no fare as that he nyst where he was / And when sir lau^celot was thus
myssed / they merueylled where he was bycomen / and then the queen and many
of them demed that he was departed as he was wont to do suddenly / For sir
Mellyagraunce made suddenly to put away on side sir Lauayns horse that they
might all understand that sir lancelot was departed suddenly / So it past on
till after dinner / and then sir Lauayne would not stynte until that he ordained
lyttyers for the wounded knights that they might be lad in them / and so with
the queen and them al both ladies and gentilwymmen and other. went unto
westmynster / and there the knytes told king arthur hou Mellyagrau^ce had
appelyd the queen of high treason / and how sir Lancelot had received the
glove of him / and this day eyghte days they shall do batail a fore you / By
my head said king Arthur I am aferd sire Mellyagraunce has taken upon him a
great charge / but where is sir Lancelot said the king / Sir said they all
we wot not where he is / but we deem he is ryden to sum adventures as he is
oftymes wont to do / for he has sir Lauayns horse / let him be said the
king / he will be founden but if he be trapped with sum treason

Capitulum octauum
So leave we sir Lancelot lyenge within that cave in great pain / and every
day there came a lady and brout him his mete and his drink / and wowed him to
have layne by him / and ever the noble knight sire Lancelot said her nay /
sir Lancelot said she ye are not wise / for ye may never out of this prison /
but if ye have my help and also your lady queen Gueneuer shall be burnt in
your deffaulte on les that ye be there at the day of bataille / God defend
said sir Launcesot that she should be burnt in my deffaute / and if hit be so
said sir Lancelot that I may not be there hit shall be well understand both
at the king and at the queen and with all men of worship that I am deed /
seek / outher in prison / For all men that know me / will say for me that I
am in sum evil caas and I be not there that day / and well I wot there is
sum good knight outher of my blood or some other that loves me that will
take my quorel in hand / and therefore said sir lancelot wete ye well ye shall
not fere me / and if there were no more wymmen in all this land but ye / I will
not have adoo with you / then art thou shamed said the lady / and destroyed
for ever / As for worlds shame Ihesu defend me / and as for my dystresse it
is welcome what so ever hit be that god sends me / so she came to him the
same day that the batail should be / and said sir lancelot / me thinks ye are
to hard herted / but would thou but kiss me ones I should deliver the and
thyn armor / and the best horse that is within sir Mellyagraunces stable / As
for to kiss you said sir lancelot I may do that and lose no worship / and
wete ye well and I understood / there were any disworship for to kiss you / I
would not do hit / then he kyssed her / and then she gat him and brought
him to his armor / and when he was armed / she brought him to a stable /
where stood xij good coursers / and bad him chese the best / Then sir
lancelot looked upon a white courser the which lyked him best / and anon he
commanded the kepers fast to sadle him with the best sadel of werre that
there was / and so it was done as he badde / then gatte he his spear in his
hand and his suerd by his side / and commanded the lady unto god / and said
lady for this good deed I shall do you seruyse if ever hit be in my power /

Capitulum Nonum
NOw leave we sir Lancelot wa^^op all that he might And speak we of Queen
Gueneuer / that was brought to a fire to be brent / for sire Mellyagraunce was
sure / him thought that sir lancelot should not be at that bataille /
therefore he ever cried upon king Arthur to do him Justice / outher else bring
forth sir lancelot du lake / then was the king and all the Court full sore
abashed and shamed that the queen should be burnt in the defaute of sir
Lancelot My lord Arthur said sir Lauayne ye may understand that it is not
well with my lord sir lancelot / for and he were on live / so he be not seek
outher in prison / wete ye well he would ben here / for never herd ye that ever
he failed his part for whom he should do batail for / and therefore said sir
lauayne / my lord king Arthur I byseche you give me license to do batail here
this day for my lord and master / and for to save my lady the queen / Gramercy
gentil sir Lauayne said king arthur / for I dar say all that sir Mellyagraunce
puts upon my lady the Queen / is wrong / for I have spoken with all the ten
wounded knights / and there is not one of them and he were hole and able to
do bataille / but he would preue upon sir Mellyagraunce body that it is false
that he puts upon my queen / so shall I said sir lauayne in the defense of
my lord sir lancelot and ye will give me ^eue / Now I give you love said
king Arthur and do your best / for I dar well say there is some treason done
to sir lancelot / Then was sir Lauayne armed and horsed / and suddenly at the
lystes end he rode to perform this bataille / and right as the herowdes
should cry / besses les aler / Right so came in sir lancelot dryuynge with
all the force of his horse / and then Arthur cried ho / and abide / then
was sir Lancelot called on horsbak tofore king Arthur / and there he told
openly to fore the king and all how sire Mellyagraunce had served him first
and last / And when the king and the queen and all the lords knew of the
treason of sir Mellyagraunce / they were all ashamed on his behalf / then
was queen Gueneuer sent for / and set by the king in great trust of her
champyon And then there was no more else to say / but sir Lancelot and sire
Mellyagraunce dressid them unto bataille / and took their speres / and so they
came to gyders as thonder / and there sir lancelot bare him down quyte over
his horse croupe / And then sire Lancelot alyghte and dressid his sheld on
his sholder with his ^uerd in his hand / and sir Mellyagraunce in the same wise
dressid him unto him / and there they smote many great strokes to gyders / and
at the last sire Lancelot smote him such a buffet upon the helmet that he
fell on the one side to the er^he / and then he cried upon him alowde /
Most noble knight sir lancelot du lake save my life / for I yield me unto you
/ and I require you / as ye be a knight and felawe of the table round slay me
not / for I yield me as over comen / and whether I shall live or dye I put me
in the kings hands and yours / then sir Lancelot wyste not what to do /
for he had had lever than all the good of the world / he might have been
revenged upon sir Mellyagraunce / and sir Lancelot looked up to the Queen
Gueneuer / if he might aspye by any sign or countenance what she would have
done / And then the queen wagged her head upon sir Lancelot / as though she
would say slay him / Full well knew sir lancelot by the waggynge of her head
that she would have him deed / then sir lancelot bad him rise for shame and
perform that bataille to the vtteraunce / nay said sir Mellyagraunce I will
never arise until ye take me as yolden and recreaunt I shall profer you large
profers said sir Lancelot / that is for to say / I shall unarm my head and my
lift quarter of my body all that may be unarmed and let bind my lift hand
behind me / so that it shall not help me / and right so I shall do
bataille with you / then sir Mellyagraunce starte up upon his legs / and
said on high My lord Arthur take heed to this profer / for I will take hit /
and let him be dysarmed and bounden according to his profer / what say ye
said king Arthur unto sire lancelot / will ye abide by your profer / ye my
lord said sir lancelot / I will never goo fro that I have ones said / Then
the knights parters of the field disarmed sir lancelot first his head / and
sythen his lift arm and his lift side / and they bond his lift arm behynd
his bak without sheld or any thing / and then they were put to gyders / Wete
you well there was many a lady and knyt merueylled that sir lau^celot would
Ieopardy him self in such wise / Then sire Mellyagraunce came with his suerd
all on high / and sire lancelot showed him openly his bare head and the bare
lift side / and when he wend to have smyten him upon the bare head / then
lightly he avoided the lift leg and the lift side / and put his right hand
and his suerd to that stroke / and so put it on side with great sleyghte /
and then with great force sir lancelot smote him on the helmet such a
bu^^et that the stroke kerued the head in two parties / then there was no
more to do / but he was drawn out of the field / and at the great Instaunce
of the knights of the table round / the king su^^red him to be entered and
the mencyon made upon him who slew him / and for what cause he was slain /
and then the king and the Queen made more of sir Lancelot du lake / and more
he was cherysshed than ever he was before hand

Capitulum x
Then as the Frenssh book makes mencyon there was a good knight in the
land of Hongre his name was sir Vrre and he was an aduenturous knight and in all places where he might here of any deeds of worship there would he be / So it
happend in Spain there was an Earls sone his name was Alphegus / and at a
great turnement in spayn this sire Vrre knight of Hongry and sir Alphegus of
spain encountered to gyders for very envy / and so either undertook other to
the Vtteraunce / and by fortune sire Vrre slew sir Alphegus the earls sone of
Spayn / but this knight that was slain had yeuen sire Vrre or ever he was
slain seven great wounds / three on the head / and four on his body / and upon
his lift hand / and this sir Alphegus had a mother / the which was a great
sorceresse / and she for the despyte of her sons death wrought by her subtyl
crafts that sir Vrre should never be hole / but ever his wounds should one time
feyster and another time blede / so that he should never be hole until the best
knight of the world had serched his wounds / and thus she made her auaunt
where through it was known that sire Vrre should never be hole / Then his
mother let make an horse lytter / and put him theryn under two palfroyes / and
then she took sir Vrres sister with him a full fair damoysel / whose name was
Felelolye / and then she took a page with him to keep their horses / and so
they led sir Vrre through many countries / For as the Frensshe book says she
led him so seven year through all lands crystened / and never she could
find no knight that might ease her sone / So she came in to Scotland and in
to the bands of England / and by fortune she came nyghe the feeste of
pentecoste until Arthurs Court that at that time was holden at Carleil / And
when she came there then she made it openly to be known how that she was
come in to that land for to hele her sone

Then king Arthur let call that lady / and asked her the cause why she
brought that hurt knight in to that land My most noble king said that lady
/ wete you well I brought him hydder for to be heled of his wounds / that of
all this seven year he might not be hole / and then she told the king
where he was wounded and of whom / and how his mother had discouerd in her
pride / how she had wroughte that by enchauntement / so that he should never be
hole until the best knight of the world had serched his wounds / and so I
have passed through all the lands crystned to have him heled / except this
land / And if I fail to hele him here in this land I will never take more
pain upon me / and that is pity for he was a good knight and of great
noblenes / what is his name said Arthur / My good and gracyous lord she said /
his name is sir Vrre of the mount / In good time said the King / and sithe ye
are come in to this land / ye are right well come / and wete you well here shall
your sone be helyd / and ever any christian man may hele him /

And for to give all other men of worship courage / I my self will assay to
handle your sone / and so shall all the kings dukes and Earls that been here
present with me at this time thereto will I command them / and well I wot
they shall obey and do after my commandment

And wete you well said king Arthur unto Vrres sister I shall begin to
handle him and search unto my rower not presumyng upon me that I am so worthy
to hele your sone by my deeds / but I will courage other men of worship to
do as I will do / And then the king commanded all the kings dukes and
earls and all noble knytes of the Round table that were there that time
present to come in to the medowe of Carleil / and so at that time there were
but an honderd and ten of the round table / for xl knights were that time awey
/ and so here we must begin at king Arthur as is kyndely to begin at him
/ that was the most man of worship that was crystned at that time

Capitulum xj
Then king Arthur looked upon sire Vrre. and the king thought he was a full
lykely man when he was hole / and then king Arthur made him to be take
down of the lytter and laid him upon the earth / and there was laid a cusshyn
fo gold that he should knele upon / And then noble Arthur said fair knight me
repents of thy hurt / and for to courage all other noble Knights / I will
pray the softly to suffer me to handle your wounds / Most noble crystned
king said Vrre do as ye list / for I am at the mercy of god and at your
commandment / So then Arthur softely handelyd him / and then sum of his
wounds renewed upon bledynge / Then the king Claryaunce of Northumberland
serched and it would not be / And then sir Baraunt le apres that was called
the King with the honderd Knights he assayed and failed / and so did king
Vryence of the land of Gore / So did King Anguyssaunce of Irland / So did
King Nentres of Garboth / So did King Carados of Scotland / So did the duke
Galahalt the haute prince / So did Constantyn that was sir Carados sone of
Cornewail / So did duke Challyns of Claraunce / So did the Earl Vlbause / So
did the Earl Lambaile So did the earl Arystause

Then came in sir Gawayne with his three sons sir Gyngalyn / sir Florence /
and sir Louel / these two were begoten upon sir did the earl Lambayle / So did
the Earl Arystause

Then came in sire Gawayne with his three sons sir gangalayne / sir Florence
and sir Louel these two were gotten up on sir Brandyles sister / and al they
failed / Then came in sir Agrauayne / sir Gaherys / sir Mordred / and the good
knyt sir Gareth that was of very knyghthode worth all the brethren / So came
knights of Launcelots kynne / but sir lancelot was not that time in the
court / for he was that time up on his adventures / Then sir Lyonel / sir
Ector de marys / sir Bors de ganys / sir Blamor de ganys / sir Bleoberis de
ganys / sir Gahalantyne / sir Galyhodyn / sir Menadeuke / sir Vyllyars the
valiant / sir Hebes le renoumes / Al these were of sir launcelots kynne / and

sir Petypase of wynchelsee / sire Galleron of Galway / sir Melyon of the
montayne / sir Cardok / sir Vwayne les aduoultres / and sir ozanna le cure
hardy / Then came in sir Astamor and sir Gromere grummors sone / sir
Crosselme / Sir Seruause le breuse that was called a passing strong knight /
for as the book says the chyef lady of the lake feested sir lancelot and sir
Seruause le breuse / And when she had feested hem both at sundry times she
prayed hem to give her a bone / and they granted it her / and then she prayed
sir Seruause that he would promise her never to do batail against sir lancelot
du lake / and in the same wise she prayed sir Lancelot never to do batail
against sir Seruause / and so either promised her / For the Frensshe book
says / that sir Seruause had never courage nor lust to do batail against no
man but if it were against gyaunts and ageynste dragons and wild beestes / So
we pass unto them that at the kings request made hem all that were there at
that hy feast as of the knytes of the table round for to search sir Turre / to
that entente the king did hit / to wete which was the noblest knight among
them

Then came sir Aglouale / sire Durnore / sir Tor that was bygoten upon Aryes

wanne upon a bridge in sire Kayes arms / sir Guyart le petyte / sire
Bellangere le beuse that was sone to the good knight sir Alysander le orphelyn
that was slain by the treason of King Mark / Also that traitor king slew
the noble Knight sire Trystram as he sat harpyng a fore his lady la Beale
Isoud with a trenchaunt glayue / for whose death was much bewailing of every
knight that ever were in Arthurs days / there was never none so bewailed as
was sire Tristram and sir lamorak / for they were traytoursly slain / sir
Trystram by king Mark / and sir lamorak by sir Gawayne and his brethren /
And this sire Bellangere revenged the death of his fader Alysander and sir
Tristram slew King Mark and la Brale Isoud dyed swounyng up on the cross of

Capitulum xij /
MErcy Ihesu said king Arthur where is sir lancelot du lake that he is not
here at this time / Thus as they stood and spak of many things / there wa^
aspyed sir lancelot that came rydyng toward them / and told the king / Pees
said the king let no ma^er thing be said until he be come to us / So when
sir lancelot aspyed King Arthur / he descended from his horse and came to the
king / and salewed him / and them all / Anon as the maid sire Vrres sister
saw sir lancelot / she ran to her brother there as he lay in his lyttar /
and said brother here is come a knight that my heart gives gretely unto / Fair
sister said sir Vrre so does my heart light against him / and certainly I
hope now to be heled for my heart yeueth unto him more tha^ to al these yt have
serched me / Then said Arthur unto sir Lancelot ye must do as we have done
/ and told sir lancelot what they had done / and showed him them all / that
had serched him / Ihesu defend me said sir Lancelot when so many kings and
knights have assayed and failed / that I should presume upon me to encheue that
all ye my lords might not encheue / Ye shall not chese said king Arthur /
for I will command you for to do as we all have done / My most renoumed
lord said sir Lancelot ye know well I dar not nor may not disobeye your
commandment / but and I might or durst / wete you well I would not take upon
me to touch that wounded knight in that entente that I should pass all other
knights / Ihesu defend me from that shame / Ye take it wrong said king
Arthur / ye shall not do it for no presumpcyon / but for to bear us felaushyp in
so much ye be a felawe of the table round / and wete you well said king
Arthur / and ye prevail not and hele him / I dare say / there is no knight in
this land may hele him / and therefore I pray you / do as we have done / and
then all the kings and knights for the most party prayed sir Lancelot to
search him / and then the wounded knight sir Vrre set him up weykely / and
praid sir Lancelot hertely saying / curtois knight I require the for gods
sake hele my wounds / for me thinks ever sythen ye came here / my wounds
greuen me not / A my fair lord said sir lancelot Ihesu would that I might
help you I shame me sore that I should be thus rebuked / for never was I able
in worthynes to do so high a thing / Then sire Lancelot kneled down by
the wounded knight saying / My lord Arthur I must do your commandment /
the which is sore against my heart / And then he held up his hands / and
looked in to the eest / saying secretly unto him self / thou blessid fader /
sone and holy ghoost I byseche the of thy mercy / that my simple worship and
honest be saved / and thou blessid Trynyte thou may give power to hele this
seek knight by thy great virtue and grace of the / but good lord never of my
self And then sir Lancelot prayed sir Vrre to let him see his head / and
then deuoutely knelyng he ransaked the three wou^des that they bled a lytyl /
and forth with all the wounds fair heled / and seemed as they had been hole a
seven year / And in like wise he serched his body of other three wounds and
they heled in like wise / and then the last of all he serched the which was
in his hand / and anon it heled fair / Then king Arthur and all the kings
and knights kneled down and gaf thankynges and louynges unto god and to his
blessid mother / And ever sire Lancelot wept as he had been a child that had been beten / Then king Arthur let array priests and clerks in the most
deuoutest manner to bring in sir Vrre within Carleil with singing and loving
to god / And when this was done / the king let clothe him in the rychest manner
that could be thought / and then were there but few better made knights in
all the court / for he was passyngly well made and bygly / and Arthur asked
sir Vrre how he felt him self / My good lord he said I felt my self never so
lusty / will ye Just and do deeds of arms said king Arthur / Sir said Vrre
and I had all that longed unto Iustes I would be soon ready /

Capitulum xiij
Then Arthur made a party of honderd knights to be ageynste an honderd
knights / and so upon the morn they Iusted for a dyamond / but there Iusted
none of the dangerous knights / and so for to shorten this tale sir Vrre and
sir Lauayn Iusted best that day / for there was none of hem but he ouerthrewe
and pulled down thyrtty knights / and then by the assente of all the kings
and lords sire Vrre and sir Lauayn were made knights of the table round / and
sir lauayn cast his love unto dame Felelolle sire Vrres sister / and then
they were wedded to gyder with great Joy / and king Arthur gaf to eueryche of
hem a Barony of lands / and this sire Vrre would never goo from sire Lancelot
/ but he and sir Lauayn awayted evermore upon him / and they were in all the
court acounted for good knights / and full desirous in arms / and many noble
deeds they did / for they would have no rest / but ever sought adventures /
thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and Joy long time / But
every night and day sire Agrauayne / sir Gawayns brother awayted Queen Gueneuer
and sir Lancelot du lake to put them to a rebuke and shame And so I leave
here of this tale and over hyp great books of sir Lancelot du lake / what
great adventures he did when he was called le cheualer du charyot / For as the
Frensshe book says by cause of despyte that knytes and ladies called him the
knight that rode in the charyot like as he were Iuged to the galhous / Therefore
in despyte of all them that named him so / he was carried in a charyot a twelve
month / for but lityl after that he had slain sir Mellyagraunce in the queen's
quarrel / he never in a twelve month came on horsbak / And as the Frensshe book
says / he did that twelve month more than xl batails / And by cause I have
lost the very matter of la cheualer du charyot / I depart from the tale of sir
Lancelot / and here I goo unto the morte of king Arthur / and that caused
sire Agrauayne

Explicit liber xix /
And here after follows the most pytous history of the morte of king Arthur
/ the which is the xx book
Capitulum Primum
IN May when every lusty heart floryssheth and burgeneth / For as the season is
lusty to behold and comfortable / So man and woman reioycen and gladen of
somer coming with his fresshe flowers / for winter with his rou wyndes and
blastes causes a lusty man and woman to coure / and sytte fast by the fire /
So in this season as in the monethe of May it byfelle a great anger and unhap /
that s^ynted not til the flower of chyualry of all the world was destroyed and
slain / and all was long upon two unhappy knights the which were named
Agrauayne and sire Mordred that were brethren unto sir Gawayne / for this sir
Agrauayne and sir mordred had ever a preuy hate unto the Queen dame Gueneuer
and to sir lancelot / and daily and nyghtly they ever watched upon sir
Lancelot / So it myshapped sir Gawayne and all his brethren were in king
Arthurs chamber / and then sir Agrauayne said thus openly and not in no
counceylle that many knights might here it / I merueylle that we all be not
ashamed both to see and to know how sire Lancelot lies daily and nyghtly by
the queen / and al we know it so and it is shamefully suffered of us all that
we all should suffer so noble a king as king Arthur is so to be shamed /
Then spak sir Gawayne and said / brother sir Agrauayn I pray you and charge
you meue no such matters no more before me / for wete ye well said sir Gawayne I
will not be of your counceylle / So god me help said sir Gaherys and sir
Gareth we will not be knowing brother Agrauayne of your deeds / Then will I
said sire Mordred I leave well that said sire Gawayne / for ever unto all
unhappiness brother sir Mordred there to will ye grant / and I would that ye
left all this / and made you not so besy / for I know said sir Gawayne what
will fall of hit / Fall of hit what fall may said sir Agrauayne / I will
disclose it to the king / Not by my counceylle said sir Gawayne / for and there
rys^ war and wrake betwyx sir lancelot and us / wete you well brother there
will many kings and great lords hold wit^ sir Lancelot / Also brother sir
Agrauayne said sire Gawayne ye must remember how oftymes sir Lancelot has
rescowed the king and the queen / and the best of us all had been full cold at
the heart rote / had not sir lancelot ben better than we / And that has he
preued him self full often / And as for my part said sir Gawayne I will never
be against sir lancelot for one days deed when he rescowed me from king
Carados of the dolorous toure / and slew him and saved my life / Also brother
sir Agrauayne and sir mordred in like wise sir Lancelot rescowed you both and
three score and two from sir Turquyn / Me thinks brother such kind deeds and
kyndenes should be remembryd / do as ye list said sir Agrauayne for I will
layne it no longer / with these words came to them king Arthur / Now brother
stynte your noise said sire Gawayne / we will not said sir Agrauayne and sir
Mordred / will ye so said sir Gawayne / then god speed you for I will not
here your tales ne be of your counceyll / no more will I said sir Gareth and
sir Gaherys / for we will never say euylle by that man / for by cause said sire
Gareth sir lancelot made me knight by no manner owe I to say ylle of him /
and there with all they three departed making great dole / Allas said sir Gawayn
and sir Gareth now is this Realm holy mescheued / and the noble felaushyp of
the round table shall be disparplyd / so they departed

Capitulum ij
ANd then sir Arthur asked hem what noise they made / my lord said Agrauayye
I shall tell you that I may keep no longer / here is I and my brother sire
Mordred brake unto my brother sir Gawayne / sir Gaherys / and to sire Gareth /
how this we know all that sir Lancelot holds your queen and has done
long / and we be your sister sons / and we may suffer it no longer / and all
we wot that ye should be above sir lancelot / and ye are the king that made
him knight / and therefore we will preue hit that he is a traytoure to your
person / if hit be so said sir Arthur we^e you well he is none other / but I
would be both to begin such a thing but I might have preues upon hit / for
sir lancelot is an hardy knight / and all ye know / he is the best knight
among us all / / and but if he be taken with the deed / he will fight with
him that brings up the noise / and I know no knyt that is able to match him
/ Therefore and it be sothe as ye say I would he were taken with the deed / For
as the Frensshe book says the king was full both thereto that any noise should
be upon sir lancelot and his queen / for the king had a demynge / but he would
not here of hit / for sir lancelot had done so much for him and the queen
so many times that wete ye well the king loved him passyngly well / My lord
said sire Agrauayne ye shall ride to morn on hunting / and doubt ye not sir
lancelot will not goo with you / Then when it draws toward night / ye
may send the queen word that ye will lie out all that night / and so may ye
send for your cokes and then upon pain of death we shall take him that
night with the queen / and outher we shall bring him to you deed or quyck / I
will well said the king / then I counceylle you said the king take with you
sure felaushyp / sire said Agrauayne my brother sir Mordred and I will take with
us twelve knights of the round table / Beware said king arthur / for I warn
you ye shall find him wyghte / let us dele said sir Agrauayne and sir
Mordred / So on the morn king Arthur rode on hunting / and sent word to the
queen that he would be out all that night / Then sir Agrauayne and sire
Mordred gate to them twelve knights / and did them self in a chamber in the
Castle of Carleyl / and these were their names / sir Colgreuaunce / sir Mador
de la port / sire Gyngalyne / sir Melyot de Logrys / sire Petypase of
wynchelsee / sir Galleron of Galway / sir Melyon of the montayne / sir Astamore
/ sire Gromore somyr Ioure / sir Curselayne / sir Florence / sir Louel / So
these twelve knights were with sir mordred and sir Agrauayne / and al they
were of Scotland outher of sir Gawayns kynne / outher well willers to his
brethren / So when the night came sir Lancelot told sire Bors how he would
goo that night and speak with the queen / Sir said sir Bors ye shall not go
this night by my cou^ce^l why said sir lancelot / Sir said sir Bors I dread
me ever of sir Agrauayn that way^eth you daily to do you shame and us al / and
never gaf my heart against no going that ever ye went to the Queen so much
as now / for I mystrust that the king is out this night from the queen by
cause perauentur he has layne sum watch for you and the Queen / and therefore
I dread me sore of treason / Have ye no dread said sir Lancelot / for I shall
goo and come again and make no taryenge / Sir said sir Bors that me repents
/ for I dread me sore that your going out this night shall wrath us all
Fair neuewe said sire Lancelot I merueylle much why ye say thus sythen the
queen has sent for me / and wete ye well I will not be so much a coward /
but she shall understand I will see her good grace / God speed you well said
sir bors and send you sound and sauf again

So sir Lancelot departed and took his swerd under his arm / and so in his
mantel that noble knight put him self in great Ieopardy / and so he past
till he came to the queen's chamber / and then sir lancelot was lytely put
in to the chamber / And then as the Frensshe book says the queen and
Lancelot were to gyders / And whether they were a bed or at other manner of
disportes / me list not hereof make no mencyon / for love that time was not as
is now adays / But thus as they were to gyder / there came sir Agrauayne and
sire Mordred with twelve knytes with them of the round table / and they said
with cryenge voys / Traitor knight sir lancelot du lake now art thou taken
And thus they cried with a loud voys that all the Court might here hit /
and they all xiiij were armed at al points as they should fight in a bataille

Lancelot is there here any armor within your chamber that I might cover my
pour body with all / And if there be any give hit me / and I shall soon
stynte their malice by the grace of god Truly said the queen I have none armor
sheld swerd nor spear / wherefore I dread me sore / our long love is come to a
myscheuous end / for I here by their noise there ben many noble knights /
and well I ^ote they ben surely armed / ageynste them ye may make no resystence
/ wherefore ye are lykely to be slain / and then shall I be burnt / For and
ye might escape them said the queen / I would not doubt but that ye would
rescowe me in what danger that ever I stood in / Allas said sir Lancelot in
all my life thus was I never bestadde that I should be thus shamefully slain
for lack of mine armor / But ever in one sir Agrauayne and sir Mordred cried
Traitor knight come out of the Queen's chamber / for wete thou well thou art
so besette that thou shalt not escape / O Ihesu mercy said sir Lancelot this
shameful cry and noise I may not suffer / for better were death at ones than
thus to endure this pain / then he took the queen in his arms / and kyste
her / and said most noble christian Queen I byseche you as ye have been ever my
specyal good lady / and I at al times your true pour knight unto my power /
and as I never failed you in right nor in wrong sythen the first day king
Arthur made me knight that ye will pray for my soul / if that I here be
slain / for well I am assured that sir Bors mine neuewe and all the remenaunt of
my kynne with sir Lauayne and sir Vrre that they will not fail you to rescowe
you from the fire / and therefore mine own lady recomforte your self what someuer
come of me that ye go with sire Bors my neuew and sir Vrre / and they all will
do you all the pleasyr that they can or may / that ye shall live like a Queen
upon my lands / Nay lancelot said the Queen / wete thou well / I will never
live after thy days / but and thou be slain I will take my death as mekely for
Ihesus Crystus sake / as ever did any christian Queen / well madame said lau^celot
/ sithe hit is so that the day is come that our love must depart / wete you
well I shall selle my life as dear as I may and a thousand fold said sir
Lancelot I am more heuyer for you than for my self / And now I had lever than
to be lord of al crystendome that I had sure armor upon me / that men might
speak of my deeds or ever I were slain / Truly said the Queen I would and it
might please god / that they would take me and slay me / and suffer you to

might drew that deed knight within the chamber door / and sir Lancelot with
help of the Queen and her ladies was lyghtely armed in sir Colgr^uaunce armor
/ and ever stood sir Agrauayn and sir Mordred cryenge traytoure knight come
out of the queen's chamber / leave your noise said sir lancelot unto sir A
grauayne / For wete you well sir Agrauayne ye shall not prysone me this night /
and therefore and ye do by my counceylle / goo ye all from this chamber door
and make not such cryeng and such manner of sklaunder as ye do / for I
promise you by my knyghthode and ye will depart and make no more noise / I shall
as to morn appiere before you all before the king / and then let it be seen
which of you all outher else ye all that will accuse me of treason / and there
I shall ansuer you as a knight should that hydder I came to the queen for no
manner of male engyne / and that will I preue and make hit good upon you with my
hands / Fie on the traitor said sir Agrauayn and sir Mordred / we will have
the maulgre thy head / and slay the if we list / for we let the wete we have
the choice of king Arthur to save the or to slay the / A sirs said sir
lancelot / is there none other grace with you / then keep your self So
then sir Lancelot set al open the chamber door / and myghtely and knyghtely
he strode in amongst them / and anon at the first buffet he slew sir
Agrauayne and twelve of his felawes after within a little while after he laid
hem cold to the earth / for there was none of the twelve that might stand sir
launcelo^ one buffet / Also sir Lancelot wounded sir Mordred and he fled
with all his might / And then sire lancelot returned again unto the Queen
and s^yd madame / now wete you well all our true love is brought to an end /
for now will king Arthur ever be my foo / and therefore madame and it like you
that I may have you with me / I shall save you from all manner adventures
dangerous / that is not best said the queen / me seems now ye have done so
much harm / it will be best ye hold you stylle with this / And if ye see
that as to morn they will put me unto the death / then may ye rescowe me as
ye think best / I will well said sir lancelot / for have ye no doubt while I
am living / I shall rescowe you / and then he kyste her / and either gaf
other a ring / and so there he left the queen / and went until his lodging

Capitulum Quintum /
When sire Bors saw sir lancelot / he was never so glad of his home
coming as he was then / Ihesu mercy said sir Lancelot why be ye all armed
what means this / Sir said sir Bors after ye were departed from us / we all
that been of your blood and your well wyllers were so dretched that sum of
us lepte out of our beds naked / and some in their dremes caughte naked
swerdes in their hands / therefore said sir Bors we deem / there is some great
stryf at hand / and then we all demed that ye were betrapped with some treason
/ and therefore we made us thus ready what need that ever ye were in / My fair
neuewe said sir lancelot unto sir bors now shall ye wete all that this nyt I was
more harder bestad wan ever I was in my life and yet I escaped / And so he told
hem all how and in what manner as ye have herd to fore / And therefore my
felawes said sir Lancelot I pray you all that ye will be of good heart in
what need someuer I stand for now is war come to us all / Sir said sir Bors
all is welcome that god sends us / and we have had much well with you and
much worship / and therefore we will take the woe with you as we have taken the
well / And therefore they said all there were many good knights / look ye take
no discomforte / for there nys no bandys of knights under heaven / but we
shall be able to grieve them as much as they may us And therefore discomforte
not your self by no manner / and we shall gadre to gyders that we love / and
that loves us / and what that ye will have done shall be done /

And therefore sir Lancelot said they we will take the woo with the well / Grant
mercy said sir Lancelot of your good comfort / for in my great distress my
fair neuewe ye comfort me gretely / and much I am beholding unto you But this
my fair neuewe I would that ye did in all haste that ye may or it be forth days
that ye will look in their lodging that been lodged here nyghe about the
king which will hold with me and which will not / for now I would know
which were my friends fro my foes

Sir said sir Bors I shall do my pain / and or it be seven of the clok I
shall wete of such as ye have said before who will hold with you

Then sire Bors called unto him sire Lyonel / sir Ector de marys / sir Blamor
de ganys / sir Bleoberys de ganys / sire Gahalantyne / sir Galyhodyn / sir
Galyhud / Sir menadeuke / sir Vyllyers the valiant / sir Hebes le renoumes /
sir lauayne sir Vrre of Hongry / sir Nerouneus / sire Plenorius / These two
knights sire lancelot made / and the one he wanne upon a a bridge / and
therefore they would never be against him / And Harre le fyse du lake and sire
Selyses of the dolorous Toure / and sir Melyas de lyle / and sire Bellangere
lebeuse that was sir Alysanders sone le orphelyn / by cause his mother Alys la
Beale pelleryn and she was kynne unto sir Lancelot / and he held with him /

So there came sire Palomydes and sir Safyr his brother to hold with sir
lancelot / And sire Clegys of Sadok and sir Dynas / sir Claryus of Cleremont /
So these two and twenty knights drew hem to gyders / and by then they were
armed on horsbak / and promised sir Lancelot to do what he would / Then
there fell to them what of Northwalys and of Cornewaile for sir Lamoraks sake
and for sire Tristrams sake to the nombre of a four score knights

My lords said sire Lancelot wete you well / I have been ever syns I came in to
this Country well wylled unto my lord king Arthur / and unto my lady Queen
Gueneuer unto my power / and this night by cause my lady the queen sent for
me to speak with her / I suppose it was made by treason how be hit / I dare
largely excuse her person / not withstanding I was there by a fore cast nere
slain / but as Ihesu provided me I escaped all theyir malice and treason /

And then that noble knight sire Lancelot told hem al how he was hard bestad
in the queen's chamber / and how and in what manner he escaped from them / And
therefore said sir Lancelot wete you well my fair lords I am sure there nys but
werce unto me and mine / And for by cause I have slain this night these
knights I wot well as is sire Agrauayne sir Gawayns brother / and at the least
twelve of his felawes / for this cause now I am sure of mortal war / for
these knights were sent and ordained by king Arthur to bitraye me / And
therefore the king will in this hete and malice Judge the queen to the fire /
and that may not I suffer that she should be burnt for my sake / for and I may
be herd and sufferd and so taken / I will fight for the Queen that she is a
true lady unto her lord / but the king in his hete I dread me will not take
me as I ought to be taken

Capitulum vj
MY lord sire Lancelot said sir Bors by mine aduys ye shall take the woe with
the well / and take hit in pacyence / and than^e god of hit / And sythen hit is
fallen as hit is / I counceylle you keep your self / for and ye will your
self / there is no felaushyp of knights crystened that shall do you wrong /
Also I will counceyll you my lord sir Lancelot / that and my lady queen
Gueneuer be in distress / in so much as she is in pain for your sake that
ye knyghtly rescowe her / and ye did other ways / all the world will speak of
you shame to the worlds end / in so much as ye were taken with her / whether
ye did right or wrong / It is now your part to hold with the queen that she
be not slain and put to a mescheuous death / for and she so dye / the shame
shall be yours / Ihesu defend me from shame said sire Lancelot and keep and
save my lady the queen from vylony and shameful death / and that she never be
destroyed in my defaute / wherefore my fair lords my kynne and my friends said
sir Lancelot what will ye do / Then they said all we will do as ye will
do / I put this to you said sir lancelot that if my lord Arthur by evil
counceyll will to morn in his hete put my lady the Queen to the fire there to
be burnt / Now I pray you counceylle me what is best to do / Then they
said all at ones with one voys / Sire us thinks best that ye knyghtly
rescowe the queen in so much as she shall be burnt / it is for your sake /
and it is to suppose and ye might be handelyd ye should have the same death or
a more shamefuller death / and sire we say all that ye have many times rescowed
her from death / for other men's quarrels / us seems it is more your worship
that ye rescowe the queen from this peril / in so much she has it for your
sake

Then sir lancelot stood still and said / my fair lords wete you well I would
be loathe to do that thing that should dishonor you or my blood / and wete
you well I would be loathe that my lady the queen should dye a shameful death / but
and hit be so that ye will counceylle me to rescowe her / I must do much
harm or I rescowe her / and peradventure I shall there destroy sum of my
best friends / that should much repent me / and peradventure there be sum /
and they could well bring it about / or disobeye my lord king Arthu^ they
would soon come to me / the which I were loath to hurt / and if so be yt I
rescowe her where shall I keep her / that shall be be the least care of us all
said sir Bors / how did the noble knight sire Tristram by your good will
kept not he with him la beale Isoud nere three year in Joyous guard / the which
was done by your elthers deuyse / and that same place is your own / and in
like wise may ye do and ye ^yst / and take the Queen lyghtely away / if it so
be the king will Judge her to be burnt / and in Joyous guard ye may keep her
long enough until the hete of the king be past /

And then shall ye bring again the queen to the king with great worship /
and then peradventure ye shall have thank for her bringing home and love
and thank where other shall have maugre / That is hard to do said sir
lancelot / for by sir Tristram I may have a warning / for when by means
of treatyce sir Tristram brought again la Beale Isoud unto king Mark from
Joyous guard look what be fell on the end / how shamefully that falls traitor
king mark slew him / as he sat harpynge before his lady la beale Isoud / with
a groundyn glayue he threst him in behind to the heart / hit greueth me said
sir lancelot to speak of his death / for all the world may not find such a
knight / All this is truth said sire Bors / but there is one thing shall
courage you and us all / ye know well King Arthur and king mark were never
like of condycyons / for there was never yet man could preue king Arthur
untrue of his promise / So to make short tale they were all consented that
for better outher for worse / if so were that the queen were on that morn
brought to the fire / shortly they al would rescowe her / And so by the advise
of sir lancelot they put hem all in an enbusshement in a wood as nyghe
Carleil as they might And there they abode stylle to wete what the King would
do /

Capitulum vij
NOw torn we again unto sire Mordred / that when he was escaped from the
noble knight sire Lancelot he anon gat his horse and mounted upon him / and
rode unto King Arthur / sore wounded and smyten / and all forbled / and there
he told the king all how hit was / and how they were all slain sauf him
self al only / Ihesu mercy how may this be said the King / took ye him in the
queen's chamber / Ye so god me help said sir Mordred there we fond him
unarmed / and there he slew Colgreuaunce and armed him in his armor / and
all this he told the king from the beginning to the ending

Ihesu mercy said the king he is a merueyllous knight of prowess / Allas me
sore repents said the King that ever sir lancelot should be against me / Now
I am sure the noble felaushyp of the round table is broken for ever / for with
him will many a noble knight hold / and now it is fallen so / said the King
/ that I may not with my worship / but the queen must suffer the death / So
then there was made great ordinance in this hete / that the queen must be
Iuged to the death And the law was such in tho days that what someuer they
were / of what estate or degree / if they were fond gylty of treson / there
should be none other remedy but death / and outher the men or the taking with
the deed should be causer of their hasty Judgment / and right so was it
ordained for queen gueneuer / by cause sir Mordred was escaped sore wounded /
and the death of thyrtten knights of the round table / these preues and
experyences caused king Arthur to command the queen to the fire there to be
burnt / Then spoke sir gawayn and said my lord Arthur I would counceylle you
not to be over hasty / but that ye would put it in respyte this Judgment of my
lady the queen for many causes / One it is though it were so that sir Lancelot
were fond in the queen's chamber / yet it might be so that he came thither for
none euylle / for ye know my lord said sir gawayne that the queen is much
beholden unto sir lancelot more than unto any other Knight / for oftymes he
has saved her life / and done batail for her when all the Court refused the
queen / and parauenture she sent for him for goodenes and for none evil to
reward him for his good deeds that he had done to her in times past / And
peradventure my lady the queen sent for him to that entente that sir Lancelot
should come to her good grace pryuely and secretly / wenynge to her that hit
was best so to do in eschewyng and dredyng of sklaunder / for oftymes we do
many things that we wene it be for the best / and yet peradventure hit torneth
to the werst / For I dare say said sire Gawayne my lady your Queen is to you
both good and true / And as for sir Lancelot said sir Gawayne I dare say he
will make hit good upon any knight living that will put upon him self
vylony or shame / and in like wise he will make good for my lady dame Gueneuer
/ that I believe well said king Arthur / but I will not that way with sir
Lancelot for he trusts so much upon his hands and his might that he
doubts no man / and therefore for my Queen he shall never fight more / for
she shall have the law / And if I may get sir Lancelot wete you well he
shall have a shameful death / Ihesu defend said sir Gawayn that I may never see
it / why say ye so said king Arthur / For soth ye have no cause to love sir
Lancelot / for this night last past he slew your brother sir Agrauayne a full
good knight / and al most he had slain your other brother sir mordred And
also there he slew thyrtten noble knights / and also sir Gawayne remember ye
he slew two sons of yours sire Florence and sir Louel / my lord said sir
Gawayne of all this I have knouleche of whose dethes I repent me sore / but in
so much I gaf hem warning / and told my brethren and my sons before hand
what would fall in the end / in so much / they would not do by my counceyll
I will not meddle me thereof nor revenge me no thing of their dethes / for I told
hem it was no bote to strive with sir lancelot / how be it I am sorry of the
death of my brethren and of my sons / for they are the causers of their own
death / For oftymes I warned my brother sir Agrauayne / and I told him the
peryls the which ben now fallen

Capitulum viij
Then said the noble King Arthur to sire Gawayne / dear neuewe I pray you
make you ready in your best armoure with your brethren sire Gaherys and sire
Gareth to bring my Queen to the fire there to have her Judgment and receive
the death Nay my most noble lord said sir Gawayne that will I never do / for
wete you well / I will never be in that place where so noble a Queen as is my
lady dame Gueneuer shall take a shameful end / For wete you well said sire
Gawayne my heart will never serve me to see her dye / and it shall never be
said that ever I was of your counceylle of her death / Then said the king to
sir Gawayne / suffer your brother sir Gaherys and sir Gareth to be there / my
lord said sire Gawayne wete you well / they will be both to be there present
by cause of many adventures the which ben like there to fall / but they are
young and full unable to say you nay / Then spak sire Gaherys and the good
knight sire Gareth unto sire Arthur / sire ye may well command us to be there
/ but wete you well it shall be sore against our will / but and we be there
by your strayte commandment / ye shall plainly hold us there excused / we
will be there in peasyble wise and bear none barneis of war upon us / In the
name of god said the king then make you ready / for she shall soon have her
Judgment anon / Allas said sir Gawayne that ever I should endure to see this
woeful day / So sir Gawayne turned him / and wept hertely / and so he went
in to his chamber and then the queen was led forth without Carleil / and
there she was despoylled in to her smok And so then her ghoostly fader was
brought to her to be shryuen of her misdeeds / Then was there weeping and
waylynge and wryngynge of hands of many lords and ladies / But there were but
few in comparyson that would bear any armor for to strength the death of the
queen / Then was there one that sire Lancelot had sent unto that place for
to aspye what time the queen should goo unto her death / And anon as he saw
the queen despoylled in to her smok / and so shryuen / then he gaf sir
lancelot warning / then was there but sporynge and pluckynge up of horses /
and right so they came to the fire / And who that stood ageynste them there
were they slain / there might none withstand sir Lancelot / so all that
bare arms and withstoode hem there were they slain full many a noble knight /
For there was slain sir Bellyas le or^^lous / Sir Segwarydes / Sir Gry^let /
sir Brandyles / sire Agloual / sir Tor / sir Gauter / sire Gyllymor / sir
Reynolds iij brethren / sir Damas / sir Pryamus / sir Kay the stranger / sir
Dryaunt / sir Lambegus / sir Hermynde / sir Pertylope / sire Perymones two
brethren that were called the grene knight and the reed knight / And so in
this rassynge and hurlyng as sire Lancelot thrange here and there / it
myhapped him to slay Gaherys and sir Gareth the noble knight / for they were
unarmed and unware / For as the Frensshe book says / sir Lancelot smote sir
Gareth and sir Gaherys upon the brain pannes where thorou they were slain in
the field how be hit in very truth sir lancelot saw hem not / and so were
they fond deed among the thyckest of the prees / Then when sir lancelot
had thus done and slain / and put to flyghte all that would withstand him /
Then he rode streyghte unto dame Gueneuer and maade a kyrtyl and a gown to
be cast upon her / and then he made her to be set behind him / and prayed
her to be of good chere / wete you well / the Queen was glad that she was
escaped from the death / And then she thanked god and sir Lancelot / and so
he rode his way with the Queen as the Frensshe book says unto Joyous guard /
and there he kept her as a noble knight should do / and many great lords and
sum kings sent sir Lancelot many good knights / and many noble knights
drew unto sir Lancelot when this was known openly that king Arthur and sire
lancelot were at debate / many knights were glad of their debate / and many
were full heavy of their debate

Capitulum ix
So torn we again unto king Arthur that when it was told him / how and in
what manner of wise the queen was taken awey from the fire / And when he herd of
the death of his noble knights / and in especyal for sir gaheris and sir
Gareths death / then the king swouned for pure sorou And when he awoke of his
swoun / then he said Allas that ever I bare croun upon my head / For now have
I lost the fairest felaushyp of noble knights that ever held christian king
to gyders / Allas my good knights ben slain aweye from me / now within these
two days I have lost xl knytes / and also the noble felaushyp of sir lau^celot
and his blood / for now I may never hold hem to gyders no more with my worship
/ Allas that ever this werre began / Now fair felawes said the king I charge
you that no man tell sir gawayn of the death of his two brethren / for I am
sure said the king when sir Gawayne hereth tell that sir Gareth is deed he
will goo nyghe out of his mind / Mercy Ihesu said the king why slew he sire
Gareth and sire Gaherys / for I dar say as for sire Gareth he loved sir
Lancelot above al men erthely / that is truth said some knights / but they
were slain in the hurtlyng as sir lancelot thrange in the thyck of the prees
/ and as they were unarmed he smote hem / and wist not whom that he smote /
and so vnhappyly they were slain / The death of them said Arthur will cause
the grettest mortal werre that ever was / I am sure wyste sir Gawayne that sir
Gareth were slain I should never have rest of him till I had destroyed sir
launcelots kynne and him self both / outher else he to destroy me / and therefore
said the king wete you well my heart was never so heavy as it is now / and
much more I am soryer for my good knights loss / than for the loss of my
fair queen / for queen's I might have ynowe / but such a felaushyp of good
knights shall never be to gyders in no company / and now I dare say said king
Arthur there was never christian king held such a felaushyp to gyders / and
allas that ever sir lancelot and I should be at debate / A Agrauayn Agrauayn
said the king Ihesu forgive it thy soul / for thyn evil will that thou and thy
brother sire Mordred had unto sir lancelot has caused all this sorrow / and
ever among these complayntes the king wept and swouned

Then there came one unto sir Gawayne and told him / how the Queen was ladde
away with sir lancelot / and nygh a xxiiij knights slain / O Ihesu defend
my brethren said sir gawayne / for full well wist I that sir lancelot would
rescowe her / outher else he would dye in that field / and to say the troth he
had not ben a man of worship had he not rescowed the queen that day / in so
much she should have been burnt for his sake And as in that said sir Gawayne he
has done but knytly / and as I would have done my self and I had stand in like
caas / but where ar my brethren said sir Gawayne / I merueyll I here not of
hem / Truly said that man sir Gareth and sir Gaherys be slain / Ihesu defend
said sir Gawayne / for all the world I would not that they were slain / and in
especyal my good brother sir Gareth / sir said the man he is slain and that is
great pity / who slew him said sir Gawayn Sir said the man Lancelot slew hem
both / that may I not believe said sir Gawayne that ever he slew my brother
sire Gareth / For I dar say my brother Gareth loved him better than me and all
his brethren / and the king both / Also I dare say and sir Lancelot had
desired my brother sir Gareth with him / he would have been with him against the
king and us al / and therefore I may never believe that sir lancelot slew my
brother. Sir said this man it is noysed that he slew him

Capitulum x
ALlas said sire Gawayne now is my Joy gone / and then he fell down and
swouned / and long he lay there as he had been deed / And then when he a
roos of his swoune / he cried out sorowfully and said Allas / and ryte so sir
Gawayne ran to the king cryenge and weeping O king Arthur mine vnkel my
good brother sir Gareth is slain and so is my brother sir Gaherys / the which
were / ij / noble knights / Then the king wept and he both / and so they
fell on swounynge / And when they were reuyued then ne spak sir Gawayne / sir
I will go see my brother sir Gareth / ye may not see him said the king / for I
caused him to be entered and sir gaherys both / For I well understood that ye
would make over much sorrow / and the syghte of sir Gareth should have caused
your double sorrow / Allas my lord said sir Gawayne how slew he my brother sir
gareth mine own good lord I pray you tell me / Truly said the King I shall
tell you as it is told me / sire Lancelot slew him and sir Gaheris both /
Allas said sire gawayne they bare none arms against him neither of hem both / I
^^ote not how it was said the king / but as it is said sire lancelot slew
them both in the thyckest of the prees / and knew them not / and therefore let
us shape a remedy for to revenge their dethes / My King my lord and mine vnkel
said sire Gawayne wete you well now I shall make you a promise that I shall
hold by my knyghthode / that from this day I shall never fail sir lancelot
until the one of us have slain the other / And therefore I require you my lord
and king dress you to the werre for wete you well I will be revenged upon sire
lancelot / and therefore as ye will have my seruyse and my love now haste you
thereto and assaye your friends / For I promise unto god said sir Gawayne for
the death of my brother sir gareth I shall seek sir lancelot thorou out seven
kings Realms / but I shall slay him or else he shall slay me / ye shall not
need to seek him so far said the King / for as I here say sir lancelot
will abide me and you in the Joyous guard / and much people draws unto him as
I here say / That may I believe said sir gawayne / but my lord he said assaye
your friends / and I will assaye mine / it shall be done said the king / and
as I suppose I shall be byg ynou to draw him out of the byggest toure of his
Castle / So then the king sent letters and wryttes thorou out all England
both in the length and the bread / for to assomone all his knights / And
so unto Arthur drew many knights dukes and Earls / so that he had a great
host / And when they were assemblyd the king informed hem how sir lancelot
had berafte him his queen / Then the king and all his host made hem ready to
lay syege about sir Lancelot where he lay within Joyous guard / Thereof herd
sir Lancelot and purueyed him of many good knights / for with him held many
knights / and some for his own sake and sum for the queen's sake / Thus they
were on both parties well furnysshed and garnysshed of all manner of thing that
longed to the werre / But king Arthurs host was so bygge that sir lancelot
would not abide him in the field / For he was full both to do batail against
the king / but sire lancelot drew him to his strong castle with all manner of
vytail / And as many noble men as he might suffyse within the Town and the
Castle / Then came king Arthur with sire Gawayne with an hughe host / and
laid a syege al about Joyous guard both at the Town and at the Castle / and
there they made strong werre on both parties / but in no wise sire Lancelot
would ride out nor go out of his Castle of long time / neither he would none of
his good knights to issue out neither none of the Town nor of the Castle
until xv / wekes were past

Then it befell upon a day in heruest time / sir lancelot looked over the
walls / and spak on high unto King Arthur and sir Gawayne / my lords both
wete ye well al is in vain that ye make at this syege / for here win ye no
worship but maulgre and dishonor / for and it list me to come my self out
and my good knights I should full soon make an end of this werre / Come forth
said Arthur unto Lancelot and thou dare / and I promise the / I shall mete
the in mids of the field / God defend me said sir Lancelot that ever I
should encountre with the most noble king that made me knight / Fie upon thy
fair langage said the king / for wete you well and trust it I am thy mortal fo
/ and ever will to my death day / for thou have slain my good knights / and
full noble men of my blood that I shall never recover again / Also thou have
layne by my Queen and holden her many wynters / and sythen like a traitor
taken her from me by force / my most noble lord and king said sir lancelot ye
may say what ye will / for ye wot well with youreself will I not strive / but
there as ye say I have slain your good knights I wot well that I have done so
/ and that me sore repents / but I was enforced to do batail with hem / in
saving of my life or else I must have suffered hem to have slain me / and as for
my lady Queen Gueneuer except your person of your hyhenes / and my lord sire
Gawayne there is no knight under heaven that dar make it good upon me / that
ever I was traitor unto your person / And where hit please you to say that
I have holden my lady your Queen years and wynters / unto that I shall ever
make a large ansuer / and preue hit upon any knight that bears the life
except your person and sire Gawayne that my lady Queen gueneuer is a true
lady unto your person as any is living unto her lord / and that will I make
good with my hands / how be it / it has lyked her good grace to have me in
chyerte and to cherysshe me more than any other knight / and unto my power I
again have deserved her love / for oftymes my lord ye have consented that she
should be burnt and destroyed in your hete / and then it fortuned me to do
batail for her / and or I departed from her adversary they confessid their
untruth / and she full worshypfully excused / And at such times my lord
Arthur said sir Lancelot ye loved me / and thanked me when I saved your queen
from the fire / and then ye promised me for ever to be my good lord / and now
me thinks ye reward me full ylle for my good seruyse / and my good lord me
seems I had lost a great part of my worship in my knyghthode / and I had
suffered my lady your Queen to have been burnt / and in so much she should
have been burnt for my sake / For sythen I have done batails for your Queen in
other quarrels than in mine own / me seems now I had more right to do batail
for her in right quarrel / and therefore my good and gracyous lord said sir
lancelot take your queen unto your good grace / for she is both fair true and
good / Fie on the false recreaunt knight said sire Gawayne / I let the wete my
lord mine vnkel King Arthur shall have his Queen and the maulgre thy vysage /
and slay you both whether it please him / It may well be said sire Lancelot /
but wete ye well my lord sire Gawayne / and me list to come out of this Castle
ye should win me and the queen more harder than ever ye wanne a strong
bataille / Fie on thy proud words said sir Gawayne / as for my lady the Queen
I will never say of her shame / but thou falls and recreaunt Knight / said
sire Gawayne what cause had thou to slay my good brother sir Gareth that
loved the more and than al my kynne Allas thou made him knight thyn own
hands / why slew thou him that loved the so well / for to excuse me said sir
Lancelot it helps me not / but by Ihesu / and by the feyth that I owe to the
high order of knythode / I should with as a good will have slain my neuewe sir
Bors de ganys / at ye time / but allas that ever I was so unhappy said
lau^celot ye I had not sone sir Gareth and sir Gaherys / Thou lie recreaunt
knight said sir Gawayne / thou slewest him in despyte of me / And therefore wete
thou well I shall make war to the / and all the while that I may live / That
me repents said sir Lancelot / for well I understand it helps not to seek
none accordement while ye sir Gawayne ar so mescheuously set / And if ye
were not / I would not doubt to have the good grace of my lord Arthur / I
believe it well falls recreaunt knight said sir Gawayne / for thou have many long
days over ladde me and us all / and destroyed many of our good knights / ye
say as it pleases you said sir lancelot / and yet may it never be said on me
/ and openly preued that ever I before cast of treason slew no good knight as
my lord sire Gawayne ye have done / And so did I never / but in my defense
that I was driven thereto in saving of my life /

A falls knight said sire Gawayne that thou menest by sire Lamorak / wete thou
well I slew him / ye slew him not your self said sir lancelot / hit had been
over much on hand for you to have slain him / for he was one of the best
knights crystned of his age / and it was great pity of his death /

Capitulum xij
Well well said said sir Gawayne / to Lancelot sythen thou enbraydest me of sire
Lamorak / wete thou well I shall never leave the till I have the at such
auaille that thou shalt not escape my hands / I trust you well enough said
sir lancelot / and ye may get me / I get but little mercy / but as the
Frensshe book says / the noble king Arthur would have taken his Queen again /
and have been accorded with sir Lancelot / but sir Gawayne would not suffer him
by no manner of mean / And then sire Gawayne made many men to blow upon sir
lancelot / And all at ones they called him falls recreaunt knight / Then when
sir Bors de ganys sir Ector de marys and sir lyonel herd this out cry / they
called to them sire Palomydes sir Safyrs brother / and sir Lauayne with many moo
of their blood / and all they went unto sir lancelot and said thus / My lord
sir lancelot wete ye well we have great scorn of the great rebukes / that we
herd gawayn say to you / wherefore we pray you and charge you as ye will have
our seruyse / keep us no longer within these walls / for wete you well
plainly we will ride in to the feld / and do bataille with hem / for ye fare
as a man that were aferd / and for all your fair speech it will not avail you
/ For wete you well / sire Gawayne will not suffer you to be accorded with
king Arthur / and therefore fight for your life and your right and ye dar /
Allas said sire lancelot for to ride out of this Castle and to do batail I
am full loathe / Then sire lancelot spak on high unto sir Arthur and sire
Gawayne my lords I require you and biseche you sythen that I am thus required
and coniured to ride in to the field / that neyder you my lord king Arthur nor
you sire Gawayne come not in to the field / what shall we do then said sir
Gawayne / is this the kings quarrel with the to fight / and it is my quarrel to
fight with the sir lau^celot / by cause of the death of my brother sire Gareth /
Then must I needs unto bataill said sir lancelot / now wete you well my lord
Arthur and sire Gawayne ye will repent it when someuer I do bataylle with you
/ And so then they departed either from other / and then either party made
hem ready on the morn for to do batail / and great purueaunce was made on
both sides / and sir Gawayne let purueye many knights for to wait upon sir
lancelot for to ouersette him / and to slay him / And on the morn at vndorne
sire Arthur was ready in the field with three great hoostes / And then sir
launcelots felaushyp came out at three gates in a full good array / and sire
lyonel came in the formest batail / and sir lancelot came in the myddel / and
sire Bors came out at the third gate / Thus they came in order and rule as full
noble knights / and always sir lancelot charged all his knights in any wise
to save King Arthur and sir Gawayne

Capitulum xiij
Then came forth sir Gawayne from the kings host and he came before and
proferd to Just / and sir Lyonel was a fyers knight / and lyghtely he
encou^tred with sir Gawayne / and there sir Gawayne smote sir lyonel through
out the body / that he dasshed to the earth / like as he had been deed / And
then sir Ector de marys and other more bare him in to the Castle / then
there began a great stoure and much people was slain / and ever sir
lancelot did what he might to save the people on king Arthurs party / for sir
palomydes and sir Bors and sir Safyr overthrow many knights / for they were
dedely knights / and sire Blamor de ganys / and sir Bleoberys de ganys with
sir Bellangere le bewse / these six knights did much harm / and ever king
Arthur was nyghe about sir lancelot to have slain him / and sir lancelot
suffered him / and would not stryke again / So sir Bors encountered with king
Arthur / and there with a spear sir Bors smote him down / and so he alyghte
and drew his swerd / and said to sir lancelot / shall I make an end of this
werre / and that he mente to have slain King Arthur Not so hardy said sir
lancelot upon pain of thy head / that thou touch him no more / for I will
never see that most noble king that made me knight neither slain ne shamed /
and there with all sir lau^celot alyght of his horse and took up the king and
horsed him ageyn / and said thus / my lord Arthur for gods love stynte this
stryf / for ye get here no worship / and I would do mine vtterau^ce / but
alweyes I forbere you / and ye nor none of yours forbereth me / my lord
remember what I have done in many places / and now I am euylle rewarded Then
when king Arthur was on horsbak / he looked upon sir lancelot / and then the
teres brast out of his eyes / thynkyng on the great curtosy that was in sir
lau^celot more than in any other man / and therewith the King rode his wey /
and might no longer behold him / and said Allas that ever this werre began /
and then either parties of the batails withdrewe them to repose them / and
buried the deed / and to the wounded men they leid soft salues / and thus they
endured that nyt till on the morn / and on the morn by vndorne they made hem
/ ready to do bataille / And then sir Bors led the forward / So upon the
morn there came sire Gawayne as brym as any bore with a great spear in his
hand / And when sir Bors saw him / he thought to revenge his brother sire
Lyonel of the despyte that sir Gawayn did him the other day / And so they that
knew either other feutryd their speres / and with all their myghtes of their
horses and hem self / they met to gyder so felonsly / that either bare other
through / and so they fell both to the earth / and then the batails joined
/ and there was much slaughter on both parties / Then sir lancelot
rescowed sir Bors and sent him in to the Castle / But neyder sir Gawayne nor
sir Bors dyed not of their wounds / For they were all helped / Then sir
Lauayne and sir Vrre prayed sir Lancelot to do his pain / and fyte as they
had done / for we see / ye forbere and spare / and that does much harm
therefore we pray you spare not your enemies no more than they done you /
Allas said sire Lancelot I have no heart to fight against my lord Arthur /
For ever me seems I do not as I ought to do / My lord said sir Palomydes
though ye spare them all this day / they will never conne you thank And if
they may get you at avail / ye are but deed / So then sir Lancelot
understood that they said him troth and then he strayned him self more than
he did before hand / and by cause his neuewe sir Bors was sore wounded / And
then within a little while by euensong time sire Lancelot and his party
better stood / for their horses went in blood past the fytloks / there was so
much people slain / And then for pity sir lancelot withhelde his knights
/ and suffered king Arthurs party for to withdraw them on side / And then
sir launcelots party withdrewe hem in to his Castle / and either parties buried
the deed / and put salf unto the wounded men / So when sire Gawayne was
hurt / they on king Arthurs party were not so orgulous as they were to fore
hand to do bataill / Of this ^erre was noysed thorou al crystendome and at the
last it was noysed before the pope / and he consyderyng the great godenes of
king Arthur / and of sir lau^celot that was called the most noblest knights
of the world wherefore the pope called unto him a noble Clerk that at that
time was there present / the Frensshe book says / hit was the Bishop of
Rochestre / and the pope gaf him bulls under led unto king Arthur of England
/ chargynge him upon pain of enterdytynge of al England that he take his queen
dame Gueneuer unto him again and accord with sir Lancelot /

Capitulum xiiij
So when this Bishop was come to Carleyl / he showed the king these bulls /
And when the king understood these bulls / he nyst what to do / full feign he
would have been accorded with sir lancelot / but sir Gawayne would not suffer him
/ but as for to have the queen / there to he agreed But in no wise sire Gawayne
would not suffer the king to accord with sir Lancelot / but as for the queen
he consented / And then the Bishop had of the king his great seal / and his
assurance as he was a true ennoynted king / that sire Lancelot should come
sauf / and goo sauf / and that the queen should not be spoken unto / of the
king / nor of none other / for no thing done before time past / and of all
these appoyntementes / the Bishop brought with him sure assurance and
writing to show sir Lancelot / So when the Bishop was come to Joyous guard /
there he showed sir lancelot how the pope had written to Arthur and unto him /
and there he told him the peryls if he withhelde the queen from the king / It
was never in my thought said lau^celot ^o withholde the queen from my lord
Arthur / but in so much she should have been deed for my sake / me seems it
was my part to save her life and put her from that danger till better recover
might come / and now I thank god said sir Lancelot that the pope has made
her pees / for god knows said sir lancelot I will be a thousand fold more
gladder to bring her again than ever I was of her taking away / with this I
may be sure to come sauf / and goo sauf / and that the queen shall have her
lyberte as she had before / and never for no thing that has been surmysed
before this time / she never fro this day stand in no peril / for else said sir
lancelot I dare adventure me to keep her from an harder shoure than ever I
kept her / It shall not need you said the Bishop to dread so much / For wete
you well the pope must be obeyed / and it were not the popes worship nor my
pour honest to wete you distressyd neither the queen / neither in peril nor
shamed / And then he showed sir lancelot all his writing / both from the
pope and from king Arthur / this is sure enough / said sir Lancelot / for full
well I dare trust my lords own writing and his seal / for he was never
shamed of his promise

Therefore said sir Lancelot unto the Bishop / ye shall ride unto the king
before / and recommaunde me unto his good grace / and let him have knowlechynge
that this same day eyghte days by the grace of god / I my self shall bring
my lady Queen Gueneuer unto him / and then say ye unto my most redoubted
king that I will say largely for the queen / that I shall none except for
dread nor fere / but the king him self and my lord sire Gawayn / and that is
more for the kings love than for him self / So the Bishop departed and came
to the king at Carleyl / and told him all how sir lau^celot ansuerd him / and
then the teres brast out of the kings eyes / Then sire Lancelot purueyed
him an honderd knights / and all were clothed in grene velowet / and their
horses trapped to their heles / and every knight held a branch of olyue in
his hand in tokenyng of pees / and the queen had four and twenty gentylwymmen
following her in the same wise / and sir Lancelot had twelve coursers following
him / and on every courser sat a young gentylman / and all they were arrayed in
grene velvet with sarpys of gold about their quarters / and the horse trapped in
the same wise down to the helys with many ouches y set with stones and
perlys in gold to the nombre of a thousand / and she and sir Lancelot were
clothed in white clothe of gold tyssew / and right so as ye have herd as the
Frensshe book makes mencyon / he rode with the queen from Joyous guard to
Carleyl / and so sir Lancelot rode thorou out Carleyl and so in the castle
that all men myt behold / and wete you well there was many a weeping eyes / and
then sir Lancelot him self alyghte and avoided his horse and took the queen /
and so led her where king Arthur was in his seat / and sire Gawayn sat before
him / and many other great lords / So when sire lancelot saw the king /
and sir Gawayne / then he lad the queen by the arm / and then he kneled
down and the queen both Wete you well then was there many bold knight there
with king Arthur that wept as tendyrly / as though they had seen all their
kynne before them / So the king sat stylle / and said no word / And when sire
Lancelot saw his countenance / he arose and pulled up the queen with him /
and thus he spak full knyghtely

Capitulum xiiij
MY most redoubted king ye shall understand by the popes commandment and
yours I have brout to you my lady the queen as right requires / And if there
be any knight of what someuer degree that he be except your person that
will say or dar say but that she is true and clean to you / I here my self
sir Lancelot du lake will make it good upon his body that she is a true lady
unto you / but liars ye have lystned / and that has caused debate betwixt you
and me / For time has been my lord Arthur that ye have been gretely plesyd with
me when I did batail for my lady your queen / and full well ye know my most
noble king / that she has been put to great wrong or this time / and sythen it
pleasyd you at many times that I should fight for her / me seems my good lord
I had more cause to rescowe her from the fire in so much she should have been
burnt for my sake / For they that told you tho tales were liars / and so it
fell upon them / for by lykelyhode had not the might of god ben with me / I
might never have endured fourten knights and they armed and before purposed
and I unarmed and not purposed / for I was sent for unto my lady your queen I
wot not for what cause / but I was not so soon within the chamber door but
anon sire Agrauayn and sir mordred called me traitor and recreaunt knight /
They called the right said sir Gawayn

My lord sire Gawayn said sire Lancelot in their quarrel they preued hem self
not in the right / well well sir lancelot said the king / I have given the no
cause to do to me as thou have done / For I have worshypped the and thyn more
than any of all my knights / My good lord said sire lancelot so ye be not
displeased / ye shall understand / I and mine have done you often better
seruyse than any other knights have done in many diverse places / and where ye
have been full hard bestadde diverse times / I have my self rescowed you from
many dangers / and ever unto my power I was glad to please you and my lord sir
Gawayne both in Iustes and turnementes and in batails set both on horsbak
and on foot / I have often rescowed you and my lord sir Gawayne and many moo
of your knytes in many diverse places / for now I will make auaunt said sir
lancelot I will that ye al wete that yet I fond never no manner of knight /
but that I was over hard for him and I had done my vtteraunce / thanked be god
/ how be it I have been matched with good knights as sir Tristram and sir
lamorak / but ever I had a faueour unto them and a demyng what they were / and
I take god to record said sir lancelot I never was wroth nor gretely heavy
with no good Knight and I saw him besy about to win worship / and glad I
was ever when I fond any knight that might endure me on horsbak and on foot
/ hou be it sir Carados of the dolorous toure was a full noble knyte and a
passing strong man / and that wot ye my lord sir Gawayne / for he might
well be called a noble knight when he byfyne force pulled you out of your
sadel / and bond you over t^warte before him to his sadel bow / and there my
lord sire Gawayne I rescowed you and slew him before your site Also I fond
his brother sir Turquyn in like wise ledyng sir Gaherys your brother bounden
before him / and there I rescowed your brother and slew that Turquyn / and
delyuerd three score and four of my lord Arthurs knights out of his prison
And now I dare say said sir lancelot I met never with so strong knights
nor so well fyghtyng as was sir Carados and sir Turquyn / for I fought with them
to the vnttermest / and therefore said sir lancelot unto sir Gawayne me seems
ye ought of right to remember this / for / and I myt have your good will I
would trust to god to have my lord Arthurs good grace

Capitulum xvj
THe King may do as he will said sire Gawayne But wete thou well sire
Lancelot thou and I shall never ben accorded while we live / for thou have
slain three of my brethren / and two of them ye slew traytourly and pytously
/ for they bare none harn^is against the nor none would bear / god would they had been armed said sire Lancelot / for then had they ben on live

And wete ye well sire Gawayne as for sire Gareth I love none of my kynnesman so
much as I did him / and ever while I live said sir lancelot I will bewail
sir Gareths death not al only for the great fere I have of you / but many causes
causen me to be sorouful / one is / for I made him knight / another is / I
wot well he loved me above all other knights And the third is / he was
passing noble / true curteys and gentyl / and well condycyoned / the fourth is
/ I wist well anon as I herd that sir Gareth was deed / I should never after
have your love but everlasting werre betwixe us / and also I wist well that ye
would cause my noble lord Arthur for ever to be my mortal foo / And as Ihesu be
my help said sir Lancelot I slew never sir Gareth nor sir Gaherys by my will
/ but allas that ever they were unarmed that unhappy day / But thus much I
shall offer me said sir lancelot if hit may please the kings good grace and
you my lord sire Gawayne I shall first begin at Sandwyche / and there I shall
goo in my shert bare foot / And at every ten miles end I will found and
garmake an hows of relygyon of what order that ye will assygne me with an hole
Covent to sing and read day and night in especyal for sir Gareths sake and
sir gaherys / And this shall I perform from Sand Wyche unto Carleil / And every

lyuelode in Crystendom / and there nys none of al these relygyous places / but
they shall be performed / furnysshed and garnysshed in all things as an holy
place ought to be / I promise you feythfully /

And this sir Gawayne me thinks were more fayrer holyer and more better to
their souls than ye my most noble king and you sire Gawayne to war upon me /
for there by shall ye get none avail / Then all knights and ladies that
were there wept / as they were mad / and the teres fell on king Arthurs
chekes / Sire Lancelot said sir Gawayne I have right well herd thy speech /
and thy great profers / but wete thou well / let the king do as hit pleasyd
him / I will never forgive my broders death / and in especyal the death of my
brother sire Gareth / And if mine vnkel king Arthur will accord with the / he
shall l^se my seruyse / for wete thou well / thou art both falls to the king
and to me / Sir said lancelot he bears not the life / that may make that good
/ And if ye sir Gawayne will charge me with so high a thing / ye must
pardonne me / for then needs must I ansuere you / Nay said sir Gawayne we
are past that at this time / and that caused the pope / for he has charged mine
vnkel the king that he shall take his Queen again / and to accord with the
sir Lancelot as for this season / and therefore thou shalt goo sauf as thou
came / But in this land thou shalt not abide past xv days such somons I
give the / so the king and we were consented and accorded or thou came / and
else said sire Gawayne wete thou well thou sholdest not have comen here / but if
hit were maulgre thy head / And if it were not for the popes commandment said
sire Gawayne I should do bataille with mine own body against thy body / and
preue it upon the / that thou have ben both falls unto mine vnkel king arthur
and to me both / and that shall I preue upon thy body when thou art departed

Then sir lancelot syghed / and there with the teres fell on his chekes /
and then he said thus / Allas most noble Christian Realm whom I have loved
above al other realms / and in the I have geten a great part of my worship /
and now I shall depart in this wise / Truly me repents that ever I came in
this realm that should be thus shamefully bannysshed undeserved and causeles /
but fortune is so varyaunt / and the whele so meuable / there nys none
constaunte abiding / and that may be preued by many old Cronykles of noble
Ector and Troylus and Alysander the mighty Conqueror / and many moo other /
when they were most in their Royalte / they alyghte lowest / and so fares it
by me said sir Lancelot / for in this realm I had worship and by me and mine
all the hole round table has been encrecyd more in worship by me and mine blood
than by any other And therefore wete thou well sire Gawayne I may live upon my
lands as well as any knight that here is / And if ye most redoubted king
will come upon my lands with sir Gawayne to werre upon me / I must endure you
as well as I may / But as to you sir Gawayne if that ye come there I pray you
charge me not with treason nor felony / for and ye do / I must ansuer you /
do thou thy best said sir Gawayne / therefore hyhe the fast that thou were gone
/ and wete thou well we shall soon come after and break the strengest Castle
that thou have upon thy head / That shall not need said sir Lancelot / for
and I were as orgulous set as ye are / wete you well I should mete you in
mids of the field / Make thou no more langage said sire Gawayne / but deliver
the queen from the / and pyke the lyghtely out of this Court / well said sir
Lancelot / and I had wist of this short coming / I would have aduysed me
twyes or that I had comen hyder / for and the Queen had be so dear to me as ye
noise her / I durst have kept her from the felaushyp of the best knights
under heaven And then sir Lancelot said unto Gueneuer in heryng of the king
and hem all / Madame now I must depart from you and this noble felauship for
ever / and sythen it is so / I byseche you to pray for me / and say me well /
and if ye be hard bestad by any falls tongues / lightly my lady send me word /
and if any knights hands may deliver you by bataill / I shall deliver you /
and there with all sir lancelot kyst the Queen / and then he said al openly
now let see what he be in this place that dar say the Queen is not true unto
my lord Arthur let see who will speak and he dar speak / And there with he
brought the Queen to the King / and then sir Lancelot took his leave and
departed / and there was neither King duke / ne earl / baron ne knight / lady
nor gentylwoman / but all they wept as people out of their mind / except
sir Gawayn / and when the noble sir Lancelot took his horse to ride out of
Carleyl / there was sobbing and Weeping for pure dole of his departing / and
so he took his Way unto Joyous guard / And then ever after he called it the
dolorous guard / And thus departed sir Lancelot from the court for ever / And
so when he came to Joyous guard he called his felaushyp unto him / and asked
them what they would do / then they ansuerd all holy to gyders with one voys
they would as he would do / my fair felawes said sir Lancelot I must depart
out of this most noble realm / and now I shall depart / hit greueth me
sore / for I shall depart with no worship / for a flemyd man departed never
out of a realm with no worship / and that is my heaviness / for ever I fere
after my days that men shall cronykle upon me that I was flemed out of this

Queen Gweneuer and I should never have departed / Then spak many noble
knights as sir Palomydes / sir Safyr his brother / and sir Bellangere le bewse

this land / there nys none of the good knytes that here ben will fail you / for
many causes / One is / All we that been not of your blood shall never be

your distress and heaviness in this realm / wete you well it shall like us as
well to goo in other countries with you / and there to take such part as ye

thank you / and ye shall understand such lyuelode as I am borne unto I shall
depart with you in this manner of wise / that is for to say / I shall depart
all my lyuelode and all my lands freely among you / and I my self will have

TRuly said sir Lancelot I thank you all of your good saying / how be it /

might I did my deuoyr / and well I am sure I knew many rebellyons in my days
that by me were peased / and I trow we all shall here of hem in short space
/ and that me sore repents / For ever I dread me said sir lancelot that sir
Mordred will make trouble / for he is passing enuyous and applies him ^o
trouble / So they were accorded to go with sir Lancelot to his lands / and to
make short tale / they trussed and paid all that would ask hem / and holy an
honderd knights departed with sir lau^celot at ones / and made their auowes /
they would never leave him for well nor for wo^ / and so they shypped at Cardyf /
and sailed unto Benwyk / sum men call it bayen and sum men call it Beaume
where the wyn of beaume is But to say the sothe / sire Lancelot and his
neuewes were lordis of all France and of all the lands that longed unto
France / he and his kynred rejoiced it all through sir Lau^celots noble prowes
/ And then sir Lancelot stuffed and furnysshed and garnysshed all his noble
towns and castles / Then all the people of tho lands came to sir Lancelot
on foot and hands / and so when he had stabled all these countries / he
shortly called a parliament / and there he crouned sir Lyonel king of France /
and sire Bors crouned him king of al king Clandas lands and sir Ector de
marys / that was sir lancelot youngest brother / he crouned him King of Benwyk
and king of all Gyan that was sir lancelot own land / and he made sir Ector
prince of them all / and thus he departed / Then sir Lancelot auaunced all
his noble knights / and first he auaunced them of his blood / that was sir
Blamor / he made him duke of Lymosyn in gyan / and sir Bleoberys he made him
duke of poyters / and sir Gahalantyn he made him duke of Querne / and sir
Galyhodyn he maade him duke of Sentonge / and sir Galyhud he made him earl of

SO leave we sir Lancelot in his lands / and his noble knights with him / and

will do you no faueour / and they may handle you / Then said sir Lyonel
that was ware and wise My lord sir Lancelot I will give this counceylle / let
us keep our strong walled Towns until they have hongre and cold / and blow
on their nails / and then let us fresshely set upon him / and shrede hem
down as sheep in a field / that Alyaunts may take ensample for ever how they
land upon our lands / Then spak king Bagdemagus to sire Lancelot / sire
your curtosy will shende us all / and thy curtosy has waked all this sorrow
/ for and they thus over our lands ride / they shall by process bring us
all to naught whiles we thus in holes us hyde / Then said sire Galihud unto
sir Lancelot / sire here ben knights come of kings blood that will not long
droupe / and they are within these walls / therefore give us leave like as we ben
knytes to mete them in the feld and we shall slay them / that they shall curse
the time that ever they came in to this country / Then spak seven brethren
of northwalys / and they were seven noble knights / a man might seek in seven
kings lands or he might find such seven Knights / Then they all said at
ones / sir lancelot for crystes sake let us out ride with sir Galyhud / for
we be never wont to coure in castles nor in noble Towns / Then spak sir
Lancelot that was master and governor of them all / my fair lords wete
you well I am full ^othe to ride out with my knights for shedynge of christian
blood and yet my lendes I understand ben full bare / for to sustain any host
a while / for the mighty wars that why lome made king Clandas upon this
country upon my fader king Ban and on mine vnkell King Bors / how be it we will
as at this time keep our strong walls / and I shall send a messager unto my
lord Arthur a treatyce for to take for better is pees than always war / So
sir lau^celot sent forth a damoysell and a dwerfe with her / requyrynge King
Arthur to leave his warrynge upon his lands / and so she sterte upon a palfroy
/ and the dwerf ran by her side / And when she came to the pauelione of king
Arthur / there she alyghte / and there met her a gentyl knight sir Lucan the
butteler / and said / fair damoysel come ye from sir Lancelot du lake / ye sir
she said / therefore I come hyder to speak with my lord the king / Allas said
sir Lucan my lord Arthur would love lancelot / but sir Gawayne will not suffer
him / And then he said I pray to god damoysel ye may speed well / for all we
that been about the king would sir lancelot did best of any knight living /
And so with this lucan led the damoysel unto the king where he sat with sir
Gawayne / for to here what she would say / So when she had told her tale / the
water ran out of the kings eyes / and all the lords were full glad for to
advise the king as to be accorded with sir lancelot / sauf al only sire
Gawayne / and he said my lord mine vnkel / What will ye do / will ye now torn
again now ye are past thus fer upon this Journey / all the world will speak
of you vylony / Nay said Arthur wete thou well sir Gawayne I will do as ye will
advise me / and yet me seems said Arthur his fair profers were not good to be
refused / but sythen I am comen so fer upon this Journey / I will that ye give
the damoysel her ansuer / for I may not speak to her for pity / for her
profers ben so large

Capitulum xx
Then sir Gawayne said to the damoysel thus / Damoysel say ye to sir
lancelot that it is wast labor now to sewe to mine vnkel / for tell him / and
he would have made any labor for pees / he should have made it or this time /
for tell him now it is to late / and say that I sir Gawayn so send him word
/ that I promise him by the feythe I owe unto god and to knyghthode / I shall
never leave him / till he have slain me / or I him / So the damoysel wept and
departed / and there were many weeping eyes / and so sir lucan brought the
damoysel to her palfroy / and so she came to sir lancelot where he was among
all his Knights / and when sir lancelot had herd this ansuer / then the
teres ran down by his chekes / And then his noble knights strode about
him / and said sir lancelot / wherefore make ye such chere think what ye are /
and what men we are / and let us noble knights match hem in mids of the
field / that may be lyghtely done said sir Lancelot / but I was never so
loathe to do batail / and therefore I pray you fair sirs as ye love me be
ruled as I will have you / for I will alweyes flee yt noble king / that made
me knight / And when I may no ferther / I must needs defend me / and that
will be more worship for me and us all / than to compare with that noble king
whom we have all served / Then they held their langage / and as that
night they took their rest / And upon the morn erly in the daunynge of the
day / as knights looked out / they saw the Cite of Benwyk byseged round
about / and fast they began to set up ladders / and then they defied hem
out of the Town / and beat hem from the walls wyghtely / Then came forth
sire Gawayne well armed upon a styf stead / and he came before the chyef gate
with his spear / in his hand cryenge / sir Lancelot where art thou / is there
none of you proud knights dare break a spear with me / Then sir Bors made
him ready / and came forth out of the Town / and there sir Gawayne encountered
with sire Bors And at that time he smote sire Bors down from his horse / and al
most he had slain him / and so sire Bors was rescowed and borne in to the
Town / Then came forth sir Lyonel brother to sir Bors / and thought to
revenge him / and either feutryd their speres / and ran to gyder / and there
they met spytefully / but sir Gawayn had such grace that he smote sir Lyonel
down / and wounded him there passing sore / and then sir Lyonel was
rescowed / and borne in to the town / And this sir Gawayne came every day /
and he failed not / but that he smote down one knight or other / So thus
they endured half a year / and much slauter was of people on both parties /
Then hit befelle upon a day / sir Gawayne came before the gates armed at all
pyeces on a noble horse with a great spear in his hand / and then he cried
with a loud voys / where art thou now thou falls traitor sire Lancelot / why
hydest thou thy self within holes and walls like a coward / look out now thou
falls traitor knight / and here I shall revenge upon thy body the death of my
three brethren / All this langage herd sir lancelot every dele and his kyn
and his knights drew about him / and all they said at ones to sir Lancelot
/ Sir Lancelot now must ye defend you like a knight / or else ye be shamed
for ever / for now ye be called upon treason / it is time for you to stere /
for ye have slepte over long and suffered over much / So god me help said
sire Lancelot I am right heavy of sire Gawayns words / for now he charged me
with a great charge / And therefore I wot it as well as ye that I must defend
me / or else to be recreaunt / Then sir lancelot badde sadel his strongest
horse / and bad let fetch his arms / and bring all unto the gate of the
Toure / and then sir Lancelot spak on high unto king Arthur / and said my
lord Arthur and noble king that made me knight / wete you well / I am right
heavy for your sake / that ye thus sewe upon me / and alweyes I forbere you /
for and I would have been vengeable / I might have met you in mids of the
field / and there to have made your boldest knights full tame / and now I have
forborne half a year / and suffered you and sire Gawayne to do what ye would do
/ and now I may endure it no longer / for now must I needs defend my self /
in so much sir Gawayne has apeeled me of treason / the which is gretely
ageynste my will that ever I should fight against any of your blood / but now I
may not forsake hit / I am driven there to as a best till a baye / Then sir
Gawayne said sir Lancelot / and thou dare do batail / leave thy babblynge /
and come of / and let us ease our hertes / Then sir Lancelot armed him
lyghtely / and mounted upon his horse / and either of the knights gat great
speres in their hands / and the host without stood stylle all a part / and
the noble knights came out of the Cite by a great nombre / in so much that
when Arthur saw the nombre of men and knights / he merueylled and said to him
self / Allas that ever sir lancelot was against me / for now I see he has
forborne me / and so the covenant was made / there should no man nyghe hem /
nor dele with hem / till the one were deed or yeldin

Capitulum xxi
THan sir Gauwayn and sir Lancelot departed a great way in sonder / and than
they came to gyder with all their horse might as they might run and either smote
other in mids of their sheldes / but the knights were so strong and their
sperys so bygge that their horses myt not endure her buffettes / and so their
horses fyl to therthe / and than they avoided their horses and dressyd her
sheldes before them / Than they stood to gyders and gaf many sad strokes on
diverse places of their bodies that the blood braste out on many sides and
places / Then had Sir Gauwayn such a grace and gift that an holy man had
given to him That every day in the year from vnderne till hye none his might
encreaced the three hours as much as thryse his strength / and that caused
sir Gauwayn to win great honor / And for his sake king Arthur maad an
ordenaunce that al manner of bataylles for any quarellys that should be done
before king Arthur should begin at vndern / and al was done for Sir Gawayns
love / that by lyklyhode if Sir Gauwayn were on the one part he should have the
better in batayl while his strength endured three hours / but there were but
few knights that time living that knew this advantage that sir Gauwayn had
/ but king Arthur allonelye / Thus sir Lancelot faught with sir Gauwayn / and
when sir Lancelot felt his might ever more encreace sir Lancelot wondered and
dredde him sore to be shamed For as the frensshe book says Sir Lancelot wend
when he felt sir Gauwayn double his strength that he had been a fend and none
erthely man / wherefore Sir Launcelotte traced and trauersyd and couerd him self
with his shield and kept his might and his brayde during three hours / And
that while Sir Gauwayn gaf him many sad br^^tes And many sad strokes that
all the knights that beheld sir Lancelot meruaylled how that he myt endure
him / but full little understood they that trauaylle that Sir Lancelot had for
to endure him And then when hit was paste none Sir Gauwayn had no more but
his own might / Then sir Lancelot felt him so come down / than he
stratched him up and stood nere sir Gauwayn / and said thus my lord sir Gauwayn
now I feel ye have done / now my lord sir Gauwayn I must do my part for many
great and grievous strokes I have endured you this day with great pain / Than
sir Lancelot doubled his strokes and gaf sir Gauwayn such a buffet on the
helmet that he fyl down on his side / and sir Lancelot wythdrewe him fro him /
why withdrawest thou the said sir Gawayn now torn ageyn falls traitor knight
and flee me / for and thou leave me thus when I am hole I shall do batayl with
the ageyn / I shall endure you sir by gods grace / but wit thou well sir
Gauwayn I will never smite a fellyd knight / and so sir Lancelot went in to
the cite / and sir Gauwayn was borne in to king arthurs pauyllyon / and leches
were brought to him and serched and salued with soft oynementes / and than sir
Lancelot said now have good day my lord the king for wit you well ye win no
worship at this wallys / and if I would my knights out bring there should many
a man deye / Therefore my lord Arthur remember you of old kyndenes / and how
ever I fare Ihesu be your gyde in all places

Capitulum xxij
ALas said the king that ever this unhappy war was begone / for ever yr
Lancelot forbereth me in all places / and in like wise my kynne / and that is
seen well this day by my neuew sir Gauwayn / Than king Arthur fyl seek for
sorrow of sir Gauwayn that he was so sore hurt / and by cause of the war
betwyxt him and sir Lancelot / So than they on king arthurs party kept the
syege with little war withoutforth / and they withinforth kept their walls /
and deffended them when need was / Thus sir Gauwayn lay seek three wekes in his
tents with al manner of leche craft that myt be had. and as soon as sir Gawayn
myt goo and ride / he armyd him at al points and sterte upon a courser and
gate a spear in his hand / and so he came rydyng before the chyef gate of
barwyk / and there he cried on heyght where art thou sir Lancelot come forth
thou falls traitor knyt and recreante for I am here sir Gauwayn will preue this
that I say on the / All this langage sir Lancelot herd / and than he said
thus / sir Gawayn me repentys of your foul saying that ye will not sease of
your langage for you wot well Sir Gauwayn I know your might and all that ye
may do / And well ye wot sir Gauwayn ye may not gretelye hurt me / Come down
traitor knight said he and make it good the contrary with thy hands / For it
myshapped me the last bataylle to be hurt of thy hands Therefore wit thou
well I am come this day to make amendys / For I wene this day to lay the as
low as thou laydest me / Ihesu deffende me said sir Lancelot that ever I be
so far in your danger as ye have been in mine / for than my days were done /
But sir Gauwayn said sir Lancelot ye shall not think that I tarry long / but
sythen that ye so vnknyghtelye call me of treson ye shall have both your
hands full of me / And than sir Launc^lot armed him at al points and mounted
upon his horse / and gate a great spear in his hand and rode out at the gate /
And both the hoostes were assembled / of hem without and of them within / and
stood in a raye full manlye / And both parties were charged to hold them
stylle / to see and behold the bataylle of these ij noble knights / And
then they laid their speerys in their reystys and they came to gyder as
thondre / and sir Gawayn brake his spear upon sir Lancelot in an hundred
pyeces unto his hand / and sir Lancelot smote him with a gretter might that
sir Gauwayns horse fete raised / and so the horse and he fyl to the earth /
Then sir Gauwayn delyuerlye auoy / ded his horse and put his shield before him
/ and eygyrlye drew his sword and bad Sir Lancelot alyghte traytoure knight
/ for if this marys sone has faylled me / wit thou well a kings sone and a
queen's sone shall not faylle the / Than sir Lancelot avoided his horse and
dressyd his shield before him and drew his sword and so stood they to gyders
and gaf many sad strokes that all men on both parties had thereof passing great
wonder / But when sir Lancelot felt Sir Gawyns might so meruayllously
encrees / He than with held his courage and his wind / and kept him self
wonder covert of his might / and under his shield he trasyd and trauersyd here
and there to break sir Gauwayns strokes and his courage / and sir Gauwayn
enforced him self with all his might and power to destroy sir Lancelot for as
the frensshe look says / Ever as Sir Gawayns might increased Right so
encreasyd his wind and his evil will / Thus sir Gawayne did great pain unto
Sir Lancelot three hours that he had right great pain for to deffende him /
And when the three hours were passyd that sir Lancelot felt that sir Gawayn
was comen to his own propre strength / Then Sir Lancelot said unto sir
Gawayn now have I prouyd you twyse. That ye are a full dangerous knight and a
wonderful man of your might / and many wonderful deeds have ye done in your
days / For by your might encresyng you have dysseyued many a full noble and
valyaunte knight / And now I feel that ye have done your mighty deeds / Now
wit you well I must do my dedys / And then Sir Lancelot stood nerre sir
Gauwayn / and then sir Lancelot doubled his strokes / And sir Gauwayn
deffended him myghtelye But nevertheless sir Lancelot smote such a stroke
upon sir Gauwayns helm / and upon the old wound that sir Gauwayn synked down
upon his one side in a swounde / And anon as he did awake he wauyd and foyned
at sir Lancelot as he lay / and said traitor knight wit thou well I am not
yet slain / Come thou nere me and perform this bataylle unto the vttermyst /
I will no more do than I have done said sir Lancelot / For when I see you on
foot I will do bataylle upon you all the while I see you stand on your feet
/ But for to smite a wounded man that may not stand god deffende me from such
a shame / and then he turned him and went his way toward the cytee / And
sir Gauwayn evermore calling him traitor knight / and said wit thou well sir
lancelot when I am hoole I shall do bataylle with the ageyn For I shall never
leave the till that one of us be slain / Thus as this syege endured and as sir
Gauwayn lay seek nere a monthe / and when he was well recouerd and ready within
three days te do bataylle ageyn with sir Lancelot Right so came tidings unto
Arthur from England that made king Arthur and al his host to remeue /

Here follows the xxi book
Capitulum primo
AS sir Mordred was rular of all england he did do make letters as though that
they came from beyond the sea / and the letters specefyed that King Arthur
was slain in bataylle with sir Lancelot / Wherefore Sir Mordred made a
parlemente / and called the lords together / and there he made them to chese
him king and so was he crowned at caunterburye and held a feast there xv
days / and afterward he drew him unto wynchester / and there he took the
Queen Gueneuer and said plainly that he would Wedde her / which was his vnkyls
wife and his faders wife / And so he made ready for the feast / And a day prefyxt
that they should be wedded / wherefore queen Gweneur was passing heavy / But she
durst not dyscouer her heart but spoke fair / and agreyd to sir Mordredes
will / Then she desired of sir Mordred for to goo to London to bye all
manner of things that longed unto the weddyng / And by cause of her fair
speech Sir Mordred trusted her well enough / and gaf her leave to goo / And so
when she came to London she took the toure of London / and sodeynlye in all
haste possible she stuffed hit with all manner of vytaylle / and well
garnysshed it with men and so kept hit / Than when Sir Mordred wyste and
understood how he was begyled he was passing wroth out of mesure / And a
short tale for to make he went and laid a mighty syege about the toure of
London / and made many great assaults thereat / And threw many great engynes
unto them / and shot great gonnes / But all might not preuaylle Sir mordred
/ For queen Gueneuer would never for fair speech nor for foul would never
trust to come in his hands ageyn / Then came the bishop of caunterburye
the which was a noble clerk and an holy man / and thus he said to Sir mordred
/ Sir what will ye do / will ye first dysplese god and sythen shame your self /
and al knyghthode / Is not king Arthur your uncle no ferther but your moders
brother / and on her him self king Arthur bygate you upon his own sister /
therefore how may you wedde your faders wife Sir said the noble clerk leave this
oppynyon or I shall curse you with book and belle and candell / Do thou thy
werst said sir Mordred wit thou well I shall defye the / sir said the bishop and
will you well I shall not fere me to do that me out to do / also where ye noise
where my lord Arthur is slain / and that is not so / and therefore ye will make
a foul work in this land / Pees thou falls priest said sir Mordred for and
thou chauffe me any more / I shall make stryke of thy heed / So the bishop
departed and did the cursyng in the most orgulist wise that might be done /
And than Sir mordred sought the bishop of caunterburye for to have slain him
/ Than the bishop fled and took part of his goods with him and went nygh
unto glastynburye / and there he was as priest Eremyte in a chapel / and lived
in pouerte and in holy prayers / For well he understood that myscheuous war
was at hand / Than Sir Mordred sought on queen Gueneuer by letters and sondes
and by fair meanys and foul meanys for to have her to come out of the toure of
london / but all this auaylled not / for she answered him shortelye / openly and
pryuelye that she had lever slay her self than to be married with him / Than
came word to sir Mordred that king Arthur had araysed the syege / For Sir
Lancelot and he was coming homeward with a great host to be avenged upon sir
Mordred wherefore sir Mordred maad write wryttes to all the barownry of this
land and much people drew to him For than was the common voys emonge them that
with Arthur was none other life but war and stryffe / And with Sir Mordred was
great Joy and bliss / Thus was sir Arthur depraved and evil said of. And many
there were that king Arthur had made up of naught and given them lands might
not than say him a good word / Lo ye al englissh men see ye not what a
myschyef here was / for he that was the most king and knight of the world and
most loved the felyshyp of noble knights / and by him they were al vpholden /
Now might not this englyssh men hold them content with him / Loo thus was the
old custom and usage of this land / And also men say that we of this land
have not yet lost ne foryeten that custom and usage / Alas this is a great
defaulte of us english men / For there may no thing plese us no term And
so faryd the people at that time they were better plesyd with sir Mordred than
they were with king Arthur / and much people drew unto sir Mordred and said
they would abide with him for better and for werse / and so sir Mordred drew
with a great host to Dover / for there he herd say / that sir Arthur would
arryue / and so he thought to beat his own fader from his lands / and the
most party of all England held with sire mordred / the people were so new
fangle

ANd so as sire mordred was at Dover with his host there came king Arthur with
a great nouye of ships and galeyes and Carryks / and there was sir Mordred
ready awaytynge upon his ^ondage to let his own fader to land up the land
that he was king over / then there was launcynge of great botes and small /
and full of noble men of arms / and there was much slaughter of gentyl
knights and many a full bold baron was laid fullowe on both parties / But
king Arthur was so couragyous that there might no manner of knights let him
to land / and his knights fyersly followed him / and so they landed maulgre
sir mordreds and all his power / and put sir mordred abak that he fled and
all his people / So when this batail was done / king Arthur let burye his
people that were deed / And then was noble sir Gawayne fond in a great bote
lyenge more than half deed / when sir Arthur wist that sire Gawayne was laid so
low he went unto him / and there the king made sorrow out of mesure / and
took sire Gawayne in his arms / and thryes he there swouned / And then when
he awaked / he said / allas sir Gawayne my systers sone / here now thou lyggest
the man in the world that I loved most / and now is my Joy gone / for now my
neuewe sire Gawayne I will discover me unto your person / in sir Lancelot and
you I most had my Joy / and mine affyaunce / and now have I lost my Joy of
you both / wherefore all mine erthely Joy is gone from me / Mine vnkel king
Arthur said sir Gawayn wete you well my death day is come / and all is thorou
mine own hastynes and wilfulnes / for I am smyten upon thold wound the which
sir lancelot gaf me / on the which I feel well I must dye / and had sir
lau^celot ben with you as he was / this unhappy werre had never begone / and
of all this am I causer / for sir lau^celot and his blood thorou their prowes
held all your cankeryd enemies in subiectyon and daungere And now said sir
Gawayne ye shall mysse sir Lancelot / But allas I would not accord with him /
and therefore said sir Gawayne I pray you fair vnkel that I may have paper /
pen / and ynke / that I may write to sire Lancelot a cedle with mine own
hands / And then when paper and ynke was brought / then Gawayn was set up
weykely by king Arthur / for he was shryuen a little tofore / and then he
wrote thus as the Frensshe book makes mencyon / Unto sire Lancelot flower of
all noble knights that ever I herd of / or saw / by my days / I sire
Gawayne king Lottes sone of Orkeney / sister sone unto the noble king Arthur /
send the gretynge / and let the have knowleche that the tenth day of may I
was smyten upon the old wound that thou gave me / before the Cite of Benwyck /
and through the same wou^d that thou gave me / I am come to my death day / And
I will that all the wo^ld wete / that I sir Gawayne knight of the table round
/ sought my death / and not thorou thy deseruynge / but it was mine own
seeking / wherefore I byseche the sir lancelot / to return again unto this
realm / and see my tomb / and pray some prayer more or less for my soul /
And this same day that I wrote this sedyl / I was hurt to the death in the
same wound / the which I had of thy hand sir Lancelot / For a of a more
nobler man might I not be slain / Also sir Lancelot for all the love that
ever was betwyxe us / make no taryenge / but come outer the sea in all haste /
that thou may with thy noble knights rescowe that noble king that made the
knight / that is my lord Arthur / for he is full streyghtly bestadde with a
falls traitor / that is my half brother sir Mordred / and he has let croune
him king / and would have wedded my lady queen Gueneuer / and so had he done
had she not put her self in the toure of london / And so the / x / day of May
last past / my lord Arthur and we all landed upon them at dover / and there we
put that falls traitor sire Mordred to flyghte / and there it mysfortuned me
to be stryken upon thy stroke / And at the date of this letter was written but
two hours and an half before my death written with mine own hand / and so
subscrybed with part of my hertes blood / And I require the most famous
knight of the world that thou wylt see my Tomb / and then sir Gawayne wept
and king Arthur wept / And then they swouned both / And when they awaked
both / the king made sir Gawayn to receive his saueour / And then sir
Gawayne praid the king for to send for sir lancelot / and to cherysshe him
above all other knights / And so at the hour of none sir Gawayn yielded up
the spyryte / and then the king let entiere him in a chapel within dover
Castle / and there yet all men may see the sculle of him / and the same wound
is seen that sir Lancelot gaf him in bataill / Then was it told the king
that sir Mordred had pyghte a new feld upon Baramdoune / And upon the morn
the king rode thither to him and there was a great bataille betwixe them / and
much people was slain on both parties / but at the last sir Arthurs party
stood best / and sir Mordred and his party fled unto Cau^turbery

Capitulum iij
ANd then the king let search all the towns for his knights that were
slain / and enteryd them / and salued them with soft salues that so sore were
wounded / Then much people drew unto king Arthur / And then they said
that sir Mordred warred upon king Arthur with wrong / and then king Arthur
drew him with his host down by the sea side westward toward Salysbury / and
there was a day assygned betwixe king Arthur and sire mordred that they should
mete upon a down beside Salysbury / and not far from the sea side / and this
day was assygned on a monday after Trynyte sunday / whereof king Arthur was
passing glad that he might be auengyd upon sire Mordred / Then sir Mordred
areysed much people about london / for they of kente Southsex and Surrey /
Estsex and of Southfolke and of Northfolk held the most party with sir Mordred
/ and many a full noble knight drew unto sir Mordred and to the king / but
they loved sir Lancelot drew unto sir Mordred So upon Trynyte sunday at
night king Arthur dremed a wonderful dreme / and that was this / that him
seemed / he satte upon a chaflet in a chayer / and the chayer was fast to a
whele and thereupon satte king Arthur in the rychest clothe of gold that might
be made / and the king thought there was under him fer from him an hydous deep
blak water / and there in were all manner of serpents and worms and wild
bestes foul and horrible / and suddenly the king thought the whele turned up
so down / and he fell among the serpentys / and every be took him by a
lymme / and then the king cried as he lay in his bed and slepte / help /
And then knights squyers and yomen awaked the king / and then he was so
amassed that he wist not where he was / and then he fell on slomberynge ageyn
not slepynge nor thorouly waking / So the king seemed verily that there came
sir Gawayne unto him with a nombre of fair ladies with him And when king
Arthur saw him / then he said welcome my systers sone / I wend thou had
ben deed / and now I see the on live / much am I beholdynge unto almighty
Ihesu / O fair neuewe and my systers sone / what ben these ladies that hydder
be come with you / Sir said sir Gawayne / all these ben ladies for whom I
have foughten when I was man living / and all these are tho / that I did
batail for in ryghteuous quarrel / and god has given hem that grace at their
great prayer / by cause I did bataille for hem / that they should bring me
hydder unto you / thus much has god given me leave for to warn you of your
death / for and ye fight as to morn with sire Mordred / as ye both have
assygned / doubt ye not / ye must be slain / and the most party of your
people on both parties / and for the great grace and goodenes that almighty
Ihesu has unto you and for pity of you / and many moo other good men there
shall be slain God has sent me to you of his specyal grace to give you
warning / that in no wise ye do bataille as to morn / but that ye take a

noble knights and rescowe you worshipfully / and slay sir mordred and all

vaynquysshed And anon the king called upon his knights squyres and yemen and
charged them wyghtly to fetch his noble lords and wise bysshoppes unto him /
And when they were come the king told hem his auysyon what sir Gawayn had
told him / and warned him that if he faught on the morn he should be slain /
Than the king commanded sir Lucan de butlere And his brother sir Bedwere with
two bysshoppes with hem and charged them in any wise and they might take a
traytyse for a monthe day with Sir mordred / And spare not proffre him lands
and goods as much as ye think best / So than they departed and came to sir
Mordred where he had a grymme host of an hundred thousand men / And there they
entreted sir Mordred long time and at the last Sir mordred was agreyd for to
have Cornwayl and kente by Arthures days After all England after the days of
king Arthur /

Capitulum iiij
THan were they condesended that King Arthure and sir mordred should mete
betwyxte both their hoostes and eueryche of them should bring fourtene
persons And they came with this word unto Arthure / Than said he I am glad
that this is done And so he went in to the field / And when Arthure should
depart he warned al his host that and they see any sword drawn look ye come
on fyersly and slay that traitor sir Mordred for I in no wise trust him / In
like wise sir mordred warned his host that and ye see any sword drawn look
that ye come on fyersly and so slay all that ever before you stondeth / for
in no wise I will not trust for this treatise / For I know well my fader will be
avenged on me / And so they met as their poyntemente was and so they were
agreyd and accorded thorouly / And wyn was fette and they drank / Right so
came an adder out of a little hethe busshe and hit stonge a knight on the foot
/ and when the knight felt him stongen he looked down and saw the adder / and
than he drew his sword to slay the adder / and thought of none other harm /
And when the host on both parties saw that sword drawn than they blewe
beamous trumpettes and horns and shouted grymly And so both hoostes dressyd
hem to gyders And king Arthur took his horse and said allas this unhappy day and
so rode to his party And sir mordred in like wise / And never was there seen a
more doolfuller bataylle in no christian land / For there was but russhyng and
rydyng fewnyng and strykyng and many a grymme word was there spoken eyder to
other and many a dedely stroke But ever king Arthur rode thorugh out the
bataylle of sir Mordred many times / and did full nobly as a noble King should /
and at al times he faynted never and sir Mordred that day put him in deuoyr and
in great peril And thus they faughte all the long day and never stynted till
the noble knights were laid to the cold earth / and ever they faught stylle
till it was nere night and by that time was there an hundred thousand laid
deed upon the down / Then was Arthure wode wroth out of mesure when he saw
his people so slain from him / Then the king looked about him / and then was
he ware of al his host and of al his good knights were left no moo on line
but two knights that one was Sir Lucan de butlere and his brother Sir Bedwere /
And they were full sore wounded / Ihesu mercy said the king where are al my
noble knights becomen Alas that ever I should see this doleful day / for now
said Arthur I am come to mine end / But would to god that I wyste where were
that traitor Sir mordred that has caused all this myschyef / Then was king
arthure ware where sir Mordred lenyd upon his sword emonge a great hepe of
deed men / Now give me my spear said Arthur unto Sir Lucan / For yonder I have
espied the traitor that all this woo has wrought / Sir late him be said Sir
Lucan for he is unhappy / And if ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right
well reuengyd upon him Good lord remember ye of your nyghtes dreme / and what
the spyryte of Sir Gauwayn told you this night / yet god of his great goodness
has preserved you hyderoto / Therefore for gods sake my lord leave of by this
/ for blessed by god ye have won the field / For here we ben three on line /
and with sir Mordred is none on live / And if ye love of now this wicked day of
desteynye is paste / Tide me death betyde me life says the king now I see him
yonder allone he shall never escape mine hands / For at a better auaylle shall I
never have him / God speed you well said sir bedwere / Then the king gate his
spear in both his hands and ran toward sir Mordred cryeng tratour now is
thy death day come / And when sir Mordred herd sir Arthur he ran until him
with his sword drawn in his hand And there king Arthur smote sir mordred
under the shield with a foyne of his spear thorughoute the body more than a
fadom / And when sir Mordred felt that he had his dethes wound / He thryst
him self with the might that he had up to the bur of king Arthurs spear / And
right so he smote his fader Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands
on the side of the heed that the sword persyd the helmet and the brain pan
/ and therwythall sir Mordred fyl stark deed to the earth / And the nobyl
Arthur fyl in a swoune to the earth / and there he swouned often times / And sir
Lucan de butlere and sir Bedwere oftymes heue him up / And so waykely they
led him betwyxte them both to a little chapel not far from the sea side /
And when the king was there he thought him well eased / Then herd they people
cry in the field / Now goo thou sir Lucan said the king and do me to wit what
bytokenes that noise in the field / So sir Lucan departed for he was grievously
wounded in many places And so as he yede he saw and herkened by the moon light
how that pyllars and robbers were comen in to the field To pylle and to rob
many a full noble knight of brochys and bedys of many a good ring and of many
a rich Jewel / and who that were not deed al out / there they slew them for
their harneys and their richesse / when sir Lucan understood this work he came
to the king as soon as he might and told him al what he had herd and seen /
Therefore be my read said sir Lucan it is best that we bring you to sum
town I would it were so said the king /

But I may not stand mine head werches so / A Sir Lancelot said king Arthur
this day have I sore mist the / Alas that ever I was against the / for now have
I my death / whereof sir Gauwayn me warned in my dreme / Than sir lucan took up
the king the one part And Sir Bedwere the other part / and in the lyftyng the
king sowned and sir Lucan fyl in a sown with the lift that the part of his
guts fyl out of his body / And therwyth the noble knights heart braste /
And when the king awoke he beheld^ sir Lucan how he lay foomyyg at the mowth
and part of his guts lay at his feet / Alas said the king this is to me a
full heavy sight to see this noble duke so deye for my sake / for he would have
helped me that had more need of help than I / Alas he would not complain him /
his heart was so set to help me / Now Ihesu have mercy upon his soul / than
sir bedwere wept for the death of his brother / leave this morning and weeping
said the king for all this will not auaylle me / for wit thou well and I might
live my self / the death of sir Lucan would grieve me ever more / but my time
hyeth fast said the king / Therefore said Arthur unto sir Bedwere take / thou
Excalybur my good sword and goo with it to yonder water side / and when thou
come there I charge the throw my sword in that water and come ageyn and
tell me what thou there see / My lord sad Bedwere your commandment shall be
done and lightly bring you word ageyn So sir Bedwere departed / and by the
way he beheld that noble sword that the pomel and the hafte was al of
precious stones / and then he said to him sef if I throw this rich sword
in the water thereof shall never come good but harm and loss / And then sir
bedwere hid excalybur under a tree / And so as soon as he might he came ageyn
unto the king and said he had been at the water and had thrown the sword in to
the water / What saw thou there said the king / sir he said I saw no thing
but wawes and wyndes / That is untruely said of the said the king / Therefore
goo thou lyghtelye ageyn and do my commandment as thou art to me leef and
dear spare not but throw it in / Than sir bedwere returned ageyn and took the
sword in his hand / and than him thought sin and shame to throw away that
nobyl sword / and so efte he hid the sword and returned ageyn and told to
the king that he had been at the water and done his commandment / what saw
thou there said the king Sir he said I saw no thing but the waters wappe and
wawes wanne A traitor untrue said king Arthur now have thou betrayed me twyse
/ who would have went that thou that bast been to me so leef and dear and thou
art named a noble knight and would betraye me for the richesse of the sword /
But now goo ageyn lightly for thy long taryeng puts me in great Ieopardye
of my life / For I have taken cold / and but if thou do now as I bid the / if
ever I may see the I shall slay the mine own hands / for thou would for my
rich sword see me deed Then Sir Bedwere departed and went to the sword
and lightly took hit up / and went to the water side and there he bound the
gyrdyl about the hyltes / and then he threw the sword as far in to the
water as he might / and there came an arm and an hand above the water and
met it / and caught it and so shoke it thryse and braundysshed / and than
vanysshed away the hand with the sword in the water / So sir Bedwere came
ageyn to the king and told him what he saw Alas said the king help me hens
for I dread me I have tarried over long / Than sir Bedwere took the king upon
his back and so went with him to that water side / and when they were at the
water side / enyn fast by the bank houed a lytyl barge with many fair ladies
in hit / and emonge hem al was a queen / and al they had black hoodes / and al
they wept and shryked when they saw King Arthur / Now put me in to the barge
said the king and so he did softelye / And there received him three queen's with
great morning and so they set hem down / and in one of their lappes king
Arthur laid his heed / and than that queen said a dear brother why have ye
tarried so long from me / Alas this wound on your heed has caught ouermoche
cold / And so than they rowed from the land / and sir bedwere beheld all
tho ladies goo from him / Than sir bedwere cried a my lord Arthur what shall
become of me now ye goo from me / And leave me here allone emonge mine enemies /
Comfort thy self said the king and do as well as thou may / for in me is no
trust for to trust in / For I will in to the vale of auylyon to hele me of my
grievous wound And if thou here never more of me pray for my souls / but ever
the queen's and ladies wept and shryched that hit was pity to here / And as soon
as sir Bedwere had lost the sight of the b^arge he wept and waylled and so
took the foreste / and so he went all that night / and in the morning he was
ware betwyxte two holtes hoar of a chapel and an ermytage /

THan was sir Bedwere glad and thither he went and when he came in to the
chapel he saw where lay an heremyte grouelyng on al four there fast by a
tomb was new graven / when the Eremyte saw sir Bedwere he knew him well /
for he was but little tofore bishop of caunterburye that sir Mordred flemed /
Sir said Sir Bedwere what man is there entered that ye pray so fast fore / Fair
sone said the heremyte I wot not verayly but by demyyng / But this night at
mydnyght here came a nombre of ladies / and brought hyder a deed cors / and
prayed me to berye him / and here they offeryd an hundred tapers and they gaf
me an hundred besauntes Alas said sir bedwere that was my lord king Arthur that
here lies buried in this chapel / Than sir bedwere swowned and when he awoke
he prayed the heremyte he might abide with him stylle there / to live with
fasting and prayers / For from hens will I never goo said sir bedwere by my
will but all the days of my life here to pray for my lord Arthur / Ye are
welcome to me said the heremyte for I know you better than ye wene that I do
/ Ye are the bold bedwere and the full noble duke Sir Lucan de butlere was your
brother / Then sir Bedwere told the heremyte all as ye have herd tofore /
so there bode sir bedwere with the hermyte that was tofore bishop of
Caunterburye / and there sir bedwere put upon him pour clothes / and served
the hermyte full ^owly in fasting and in prayers Thus of Arthur I find never
more Wryt^n in boookes that been auctorysed nor more of the very certente of
his death herd I never read / but thus was he led aweye in a ship wherein
were three queen's / that one was king Arthurs sister queen Morgan le fay / the
other was the queen of North galys / the third was the queen of the waste
lands / Also there was ^ynyue the chyef lady of the lake / that had wedded
Pelleas the good knight and this lady had done much for king Arthur / for she
would never suffer sir Pelleas to be in no place where he should be in danger
of his life / and so he lived to the vttermest of his days with her in great
rest / More of the death of king Arthur could I never find but that ladies
brought him to his buryellys / and such one was buried there that the hermyte
bare witness that sometime was bishop of caunterburye / but yet the heremyte
knew not in certain that he was verayly the body of king Arthur / for this

YEt sum men say in many parties of England that king Arthur is not deed /
But had by the will of our lord Ihesu in to another place / and men say that

shall be so / but rather I will say here in this world he changed his life / but
many men say that there is wryton upon his tomb this verse Hic iacet Arthurus
Rex qondam Rex que futurus / Thus leave I here sir Bedwere with the hermyte that
dwelled that time in a chapel beside glastynburye and there was his ermytage /

Than was sir Lancelot wroth out of mesure and said to his kynnesmen alas that

for much shame has he done unto my lord Arthur for all I feel by the doleful
letter that My lord sir Gauwayn sent me / on whose soul Ihu have mercy / that

noble knight as ever was borne / and in an unhappy hour was I borne that ever
I should have that unhappy to slay first sir Gauwayn sir Gaheris the good knight
and mine own friend sir Gareth that full noble knight / Alas I may say I am

and hit will be well done that ye see sir Gauwayn^ tomb / and secondly that ye

thorugh gods grace that after my death to have a sight of the blessed face of

absteyne you from such works and they departed but there was never so hard
an herted man but he would have wept to see the dolor that they made / for
there was la^mentacyon as they had be stungyn with sperys / and many times they
swouned / and the ladies bare the queen to her chamber / and sir Lancelot awok
and went and took his horse and rode all that day and al nyt in a forest weeping /
and at last he was ware of an Ermytage and a chapel stood betwyxte two
clyffes / and than he herd a little belle ring to mass / and thither he rode
and alyght and teyed his horse to the gate and herd mass / and he that sange
mass was the bishop of caunterburye / both the bishop and sir Bedwer knew
sir Lancelot / and they spoke to gyders after mass but when sir Bedwere had
told his tale al hole sir Launcelottes heart almost braste for sorrow / and sir
Lancelot threw his arms abroad / and said alas who may trust this world /
and than he knelyd down on his knee and prayed the bishop to shryue him and
assoyle him / and than he besought the bishop that he might he his brother /
Than the bishop said I will gladly and there he put an habyte upon Sir
Lancelot / and there he served god day and nyt with prayers and fastings /
Thus the great host abode at dover and than sir Lyonel took fyftene lords
with him and rode to london to seek sir Lancelot / and there sir Lyonel was
slain and many of his lords / Then Sir Bors de ganys made the great host
for to goo hoome ageyn And sir boors / sir Ector de maris / Sir Blamour / sir
bleoloris with moo other of sir Launcelottes kynn^ ^oke on hem to ride al
england overthwart and endelonge to seek sir Lancelot / So sir Bors by fortune
rode so long till he came to the same chapel where sir Lancelot was / and so
sir Bors herd a little belle knylle that range to mass / and there he alyght
and herd mass / and when mass was done the bishop sir lancelot and sir
Bedwere came to sir Bors / and when sir bors saw sir Lancelot in that manner
clothyng / than he preyed the bishop that he might be in the same sewte / and
so there was an habyte put upon him / and there he lived in prayers and fasting
/ and within half a ye^^ there was come sir Galyhud / sir Galyhodyn / sir
Blamour / sir Bleoheris / sir wyllyars / sir Clar^^s / and sir Gohaleamyne / So
al these vij noble knytes there abode still and when they saw sir Lancelot
had taken him to such perfeccion they had no last to depart / but took such
an habyte as he had / Thus they endured in great penance syx year / and than
sir Lancelot took thahyte of preesthod of the bishop / and a twelve monthe ^e
sange mass / and there was none of these other knights but they read in
books / and help for to sing mass and range b^llys and did ^odoly al manner
of service / and so their horses went where they would / for they took no
regard of no worldly rychesses / for when they saw sir Lancelot endure such
penaun^e in prayers and fastings they took no force what pain they endured
for to see the nobleste knight of the world t^ke such abstynaunce that he
waxed full lene / and thus upon a night there came a vysyon to sir Lancelot and
charged him in remyssyon of his sins to haste him unto almysbury and by
then then come there thou shall find queen Gueneuer deed / and therefore take
thy fellows with the and pareuey them of an horse bear / and fetch thou the
cors of her / and burye her by her husbond the noble king Arthur / So this
auysyon came to Lancelot thryse in one night

THan sir Lancelot rose up or day and told the heremyte It were well done said

Than sir Lancelot took his un fellows with him and on fore they yede from
glastynburye to almysburye the which is little more than xxx mile / and (...)
they ^^me within two days for they were wayke and feeble to goo / and when sir
Lancelot was come to almysburye within the Nunerye queen gueneuer deyed but
half an our before / and the ladies told sir Lancelot that queen Gueneuer
told hem al or she passyd that sir Lancelot had been priest nere a twelve
monthe / and hyder he comes as fast as he may to fetch my cors. and beside
my lord king Arthur he shall berye me / wherefore the queen said in heryng of hem
al / I beseech almighty god that I may never have power to see sir Lancelot
with my worldly eyes / And thus said all the ladies was ever her prayer these
two days till she was deed / Than sir Lancelot saw her vysage bat he wept
not gretelye but syghed / and so he did all the obseruaunce of the service him
self both the dyryge / and on the m^^ne he sange mass / and there was
ordained an horse bear / and so with an hundred torches ever brennyng about the
cors of the queen / and ever sir Lancelot with his viij fellows went about
the horse bear syngyng and redyng many an holy oryson / and frankensens upon the
corpse encensed / Thus sir Lancelot and his eight fellows went on foot from
almysburye unto glastynburye / and when they were come to the chapel and the
hermytage there she had a dyryge with great devotion / and on the morn the
heremyte that sometime was bishop of canterburye sa^ge the mass of requyem

and than in a coffyn of marbyl / and when she was put in therth sir Lancelot
swouned and lay long stylle while the hermyte came and awaked him / and said
ye be to blame / for ye dysplese god with such manner of sorrow making / Truly
said sir Lancelot I trust I do not dysplese god / for he knows mine entente /
For my sorrow was not nor is not for any reioysyng of sin / but my sorrow may
never have end / For when I remember of her beaulte and of her noblesse / that
was both with her king and with her / So when I saw his corpse and her corpse
so lie togyders / truly mine heart would not serve to sustain my careful body /
Also when I remember me how by my defaute and mine orgule and my pride / that
they were both laid fullowe that were pereles that ever was living of christian
people wit you well said sir Lancelot this remembered of there kyndenes and mine
unkindness sanke so to mine heart that I myt not sustain my self so the

Then sir Lancelot never after ete but little mete nor drank till he was deed

bishop nor none of his fellows myt not make him to ete and little he drank
that he was waxen by a kyhbet shorter than he was / that the people could not
know him / for evermore day and nyt he prayed but sometime he slombred a broken
sleep / ever he was lyeng grouelyng on the tomb of king Arthur and queen
Gueneuer / and there was no comfort that the bishop nor sir Bors nor none of
his fellows could make him it auaylled not / So within syx wekye after sir
Lancelot fyl seek and lay in his bed and then he sent for the bishop
that there was heremyte and al his true fellows / Than Sir Lancelot said with
drery steven / sir bishop I pray you give to me al my ryghtes that longs to
a christian man / It shall not need you said the heremyte and al his fellows / It
is but heaviness of your blood ye shall be well mended by the grace of god to
morn / My fair lords said sir Lancelot wit you well my careful body wy^ in to
therthe I houe warnyng more than now I will say / therfo^^ give me my ryghtes /
So when he was howselyd and enelyd / and had all that a christian man ought to
ha^^ he prayed the bishop that his fellows might bear his body to Joyous gar^e
/ Sum men say it was anwyk / and sum may say it was hamborow how be it said
sir Lancelot me repents sore but I made mine auowe sometime that in joyous
guard I would be buried / and by cause of brekyng of mine auowe I pray you al
led me thither / Than there was weeping and wryngyng of hands among his fellows
/ So at a seson of the night they al went to their beds for they all lay
in one cham^^^ / And so after mydnyght against day the bishop then was hermyte

against him / It is but dretchyng of sweuens said sir Bors for I doubt not sir
Lancelot ayleth no thing but good / It may well be said the bishop goo ye to
his hedde and than shall ye prove the soth / So when sir Bors and his fellows
came to his bed they found him stark deed / and he lay as he had smyled
and the swettest savor about him that ever they felt / than was there weeping
and wryngyng of hands / and the grettest dole they made that ever made men /
and on the morn the bishop did his mass of requyem / and after the bishop
