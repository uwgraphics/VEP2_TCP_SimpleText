THE MERRY HISTORY, OF THE THRIE FRIARS OF BER^^^KE.

Printed at Aberdene, By Edward Raban, For David Melvill, 1622.

THE THREE FRIARS OF BERWICKE.
AS it befell, and happened in deed,
Upon a River, which is called Tweede:
At Tweedes fair Mouth, there stands a Noble Town,
Where many Lords have been, of great Renown:
And many a worthy Lady, fair of Face:
And many a fresh lusty Gallant was:
Into this Town, which called is Berwicke,
Upon the Sea there stands none it like.
For it well Walled is about with Stone:
And double Stankes are casten, many one.
And then the Cas^le is so strong, and wight:
With stately Towers, and Turrets on the hight.
The Car-Walles closed craftily: with-all,
The (...) most subtillie to fall,
(...) they please to draw them up on hight:
(...) Folks by any kind of Might
(...) win the same, by Craft, or Subtlety.
(...) within is fair Artille^ie.
(...) my days, where ever I have been,
(...), most goodly, and most well beseene:
(...) Town, the Water, the Castle, and the Land:
(...) Ualleyes green, upon the other hand.
(...) gr^^t Cross Kirk, and eeke the Maison Dew:
The Iacobines, they Friars are of white hew.
The Carmelites, and the Minouries eeke:
The four Orders of Friars were not to seek,
These Friars were in Berwicks Town once dwelling,
Where as it happened in a fair May Morning,
That two of the Iacobine Milke-whyte Friars,
As they were wont, and used many years,
To walk amongst their Brethren up on Land.
Those silly Friars passed forth from hand.
Fri^^ Allane was one: Friar Robert the other:
As Friars fashion is, with Wyves could well gloother.
Right wondrous well they pleased the Wyves:
And told them fair Tales, of Holy Saints lyves:
Till Night was at hand, and they should go home.
But right tired, and wet, was Friar Allane.
For he was old, and might not well travel,
Because he had some spyce of the Gravel.
Friar Robert was young, could bide Rain and Wind:
H^e bare both their Gowns, yet bode not behind.
Yea, bore all their Gear: ^or he was full wight.
By that it drew near toward the Night:
And they were coming to the Town full near.
Friar Allane said, Robert, good Brother dear,
It is so late, I fear the Yate be closed:
And we are tyrde, and wondrous ill disposed
To (...) out of the Town: except that we
(...) House this (...)
So there did dwell a wondrous good Hostl^er^^
Without Berwicke, in-to a fair Manniere:
Simon Laurel he called was by name:
A fair blythe Wife he had, and comely Dame:
But she was something duike, and dangerous.
These silly Friars came then to that Man's House;
Saluting her: and becked courteously:
And she to them did answer perfectly.
Friar Robert then inquirde for the Good Man?
And in this wise she quickly answered than:
He went from Home, GOD wots, on Wedn^sday,
In the Country, to seek for Corn and Hay,
And other things, where-of we stand in need.
Friar Allane ^ayde, I pray Great GOD him speed,
And keep him safe and sound in his travail.
Friar Robert said, Dame fill a Stoop with Aile,
That we may drink: for I am wondrous dry.
With that the Good-wyfe went full speedilye,
And filde the Stoop, and brought them Bread and Chiese^
They ate, and drank, and sat at their own ease.
Friar Allane said to the Good-wyfe in hye,
Come hither, Dame, and set you down me by,
And fill once again the Stoop, I you pray,
Before we go full well we will you pay.
The Friars were blythe, and merry Tales ^ould tell.
But even with that they heard their own Prayer Bell,
Within the Abbie, and were sore aghast,
For then they knew the Yates were closed fast,
That they might not from thence-foorth get entry.
The Good-wyfe then they prayde for Charity,
To grant them Lodging, on^lie for one night.
But she to them did answer high on hight,
Mine Husband is from Home, as I you told:
And I, GOD knows, dare no ways be so bold,
To harber Friars within the House with me.
What would (...) Simo^ (...) Benedicitie^
(...) I durst never look intill his Face:
(...) Lady Mari^ keep me from such a case:
(...) of perrill, and from Shame.
(...) Friar Allan^ said, Fair Dame,
(...) Gods sake hear me, what I soon shall say,
(...) us out, we shall be dead ere day.
(...) way is ill, and we are tyrde, and wet:
(...) know) it is so very late:
The (...) closde, that we can not get in:
(...) in no cas^ we may win.
(...) it does behoove us to bide still,
And put us wholly, Dame, in-to your will.
The Good-wyfe looked on those Friars tway,
And at the last unto them did she say:
Ye bide not here, by Him that has us coft,
Except ye list to lie up in yonde Loft,
Which is well wrought even in-to the Halles end:
Ye shall find Straw, and Clothes I shall you send.
If ye list not, then pass your ways in feire:
None other ways will I repair you hee^e.
^er Maiden then she sends up before,
And ^ade them follow both, and stay no more.
They were full blythe, and did as she them kende,
And up they went, to lodge at the Halles end.
Intill a Loft, the Maid with Corn and Hay,
Did make their Bed: and then she went her way,
Closing the Trappe: and they remained still.
In to that Lo^t they had not all their will.
Friar Allane lay down, as he best might.
Friar Robert said, I vowde to walk this Night:
Who wots? perchance some Sportes I may espy.
Thus in the Loft I let the Friars lie,
And of the Good-wyfe now will I spea^^ ^ore.
She was right glad the Friars were closde ther^
For she had made a Tryst that selfsame Night,
Friar John her Love his Supper for to dight.
And she would have none other Company,
Because Friar John that Night with her should lie:
Who dwelling was in-to that selfsame Town:
And a Black Friar he was, of great Renown.
He governed all whole the Abbacie:
Silver and Gold he had abundantly.
He had a privy Posterne of his own,
That he might ishe, and pass away unknown
But thus in Berwickes Town I leave him still,
Byding his time: and turn again I will,
To this fair Wife. Now she the Fire (...)
And throng the fattest Capons on the Spitte:
And eeke fat Conies to the Fire she say:
And bade her Maiden, in all haste she may,
To flame, and turn, and roast them tenderlye:
Then to her Chamber is she gone in hye.
She pulde her Makin, gave it buffets tway
Upon the Cheek: and till it can she say,
Thou should be blythe, and glad at my Request:
These Mulles of thine are called to a Feast.
She puts on a Kirtle fine of Read:
A fair white Courtch she binds about her Head.
Her Belt was wrought of Silk, and Silver fine:
Embrodred Purse: her Keys hung clincking syne.
On every Finger she put on Ringes two:
And was as proud as any Papingo.
She laid on a Board-cloath of costly Green:
Of Silver-Worke she was full well foreseen.
Then forth she came, in-to the Hall, anon,
And asked her Maid, if she heard any one?
With that Friar John was knocking at the Yate:
Whose knock she knew, and quickly him in let.
She well-comde him upon a good manniere.
(...) her: and said, Mine own Love dear,
H^^^e there a pair of Bottles, good, and fine:
They hold a gallon (full) of Gascoin Wine.
(...) pa^^^ of Partri^h, even new slain:
(...) a ^aund full Bread, of fynest Maine.
This have I brought to you, mine only Dear:
That you and I therewith might make good Cheer.
Since it is so that Simon is from Home,
I will talk right homely with you, Madame.
She ^ayeth, Ye are full heartli^ well-come heere^
In such a wise, when that you will appear.
^ith that she smyled wondrous love^omlie.
Again he thrust her Hand right privilie.
Thus at their Spor^e I will them yet leave still,
Till other time: and turn again I will,
And tell you of those ^illie Friars two.
Were locked in the Loft, amongst the Straw.
Friar Allane on his Cou^h ^ull still did lie.
Friar Robert had a little jealousye:
For in his Heart he had great perceiving:
And through the Boardes he mad^ (with some sharp thing)
A little Hole, in such a wise got he,
That all they did below he could well see:
Yea, ^verie word he heard which they did say:
When she was proud, and wondrous fresh, and gay.
And what she wo^re upon her Head above.
She called him both Lemman, Heart, and Love.
Full Prelate-lyke he sat in to the Chair:
And she did round Epistles in his Ear.
Thus sport they them, and make great Melody.
And when she saw the Supper was r^adie,
She quickly went, and de^kt the Board anon:
And then the pair of Bottels has she taken,
And set them ^^wne, upon the Board, her by.
And even with that they heard the Good Man cry:
Who knocked at the Yate, and shouted fast.
When they him heard, then were they all aghast.
And good Friar John was something in effray:
Full soon start up, and would have been away.
But all for naught: he might no way win out^
The Good-wyfe spak^ then with a visage stout,
Yonde is Simon, tha^ makes all this deray,
Whom I might those had bidden yet away.
I Will quyte him this, if I live half a year,
For troubling us, when we should make good Cheer.
Because of him we may not bide together:
I do repent at this time ye came hither.
We were so well, if he had bidden away.
What shall I do? Alace, Friar John can say.
The Good-wyfe said, I hold it for the best,
That I you hyde, till he be brought to rest,
In-to yonde Trogh, which ^tandeth in the Nooke,
Would hold six Bowls of Me^le when that she book.
There-under then she ca^sde him creep in hye,
Where he had rowme enough a ease to lie.
She closed him, and then wen^ on her way?
And to her Maiden softly can he say,
Take way this Gear, and s^aken out the Fyrs:
Go, close the Boarde, and take away yonde Chair.
Soon, lock up all, with-in the Panterie:
Both Meat, and Drink: ha done full speedily.
The Comes, Capons, and the wild Fowls fine:
The Maine-shot Bread, the ^ottels with the Wine.
She locked up all, and ^ight ^he House so clean,
That no likeness of Feast ^ight there be seen.
The Good-wyfe then, with-^ut longer delay,
Did quickly put off all her ^^esh Array:
And then she went in-to her Bed anon,
And let her Husband knock without, alone.
UUhen he with knocking tired was, (...) ^ryde,
And went about un-to the other side:
Unto a Window, stood at her Beddes-head,
Saying, Alison, awake, for CHRIST'S dead.
When Allison had tholde him long to cry,
As half a-sleepe, she answearde crabbedlye,
How? Who is that, that knows so well my name?
Go hence, quod she, mine Husband is from Home.
And I will harber here no Guestes, P^rfay:
Therefore, I pray you, wend on, wend on, your way:
For at this time ye may not lodged be.
Then Simon spoke, Dear Wife, ken ye not me?
I am your Simon, God-man of this Place.
Are ye that, Simon? my Spouse, she says, Alace!
Through miss-knowledge I had almost miss-done.
Who would have thought ye should so late come Home?
She starteth up, and gets Light in hye,
And opens then the Yate full speedilye.
She let him in on the most heartlie wise,
And took from him the Gear, as was the guyse.
He bade the Maiden (...) on the Fire,
And get him (...) she should have good Hyre.
The Good-wyfe s^^de, Sweet Simon ye may trow,
Here is no Meat this ^ight that gains for you.
At least, Good Dame, g^e fetch me Chiese and Bread:
Go fill the Stoop, and hold it to mine Head.
For I am hungry, weary, wette, and cold.
Then up she rose, (as Reason bade she should:)
Covered the Boarde, an^ set on Bread of Rye:
A sowst Neats foot, a Sheep head set she by.
Even such cold Meat she brought to him belyve,
And filde the Stoop. (...) Simon waxed blythe.
He ate, and drank, and ^^^de, By All-hollow,
I fare right well, had I b^^ one Good Fellow.
Dame, drink with me, and eat, I do you pray.
The Good-wyfe said, The Devill-a-bitte I may:
It were more meet now in your Bed to be,
Than here to sit, desyring Company.
Friar Robert said unto his Brother dear,
Alace, I would the Good Man kende us here.
Who wots? Perchance some better might he fare.
For sure it is, mine Heart will aye be sore,
If yonde course meat with Simon birnis^^ (...),
While dainty Cheer sta^des in the Panterie.
And with that word he coached loud anon.
Till Simon heard, and asked, Who is yonde?
The Good-wyfe said, Yonde are your Friars twey.
Quoth Simon then, Tell me what Frier^ are they?
She said, Friar Robert, and silly old Allane,
Who all this day have walked in great pain.
UUhen they came here it was so very late,
Prayer Bell was rung, and closed was their Yate:
There-fore above I gave them Harberie.
The Good Man said, So GOD have part on me,
The selfsame Friars are heartlie well-come hither:
Go call them down, that (...) may drink together.
The Good-wyfe said, I (...) let them be:
They had rather sleep, nor sit in ^^^panie.
Unto the Maiden spoke the Good Man than,
Go, pray them both to come to me fr^^ hand.
The Maiden soon did open the Trappe Door,
And said, Ye Friars, come down^ upon the Floor.
Friar Robert swear, and said, By sweet Saint John,
The Good Man is even right well-come home.
Alace, he had ill traveling this day.
And we shall come unto him, ye may say.
Then suddenly they start up both anon,
And down the Trappe, with right good speed, they came:
Saluted Simon, as soon as they him see.
And he again did halsse them courteously,
And said, Come here, ^^ne own poor Brethren dear:
And sit you down, even beside me, here:
For I am now alone, as ye may see:
Where-fore, I pray you, bear me company:
And take a part of such Cheer as I have.
Friar Allane said, I pray GOD you to save.
For here is enough of GODS Graces good.
Then Simon answered, Now by the Roode,
(...) Crown of Gold for me,
(...) Meat, and Drink amongst us three.
(...) said, UUhat Meat now would ye have?
Or els^ what Drink^ desire y^e for to crave?
For I (...) sundry Pracktic^es well discearnde,
Beyond^ t^^ S^as, in Pari^, which I learnde:
The wh^^h I gladly prove will for your sake,
And for our Dames, who did us lodging make.
Il^ take in hand, if ye will counsel keep,
To c^use you see, even hee^^, before ye sleep,
Of the best Meat that is in this Country,
And Gascoin Wine, if ani^ that there be.
Or if it be with-in an hun^reth mile,
It shall be here, with-in ^^honnie while.
The Good Man had (...)vell at this Tale,
And said, Dear (...), mine Heart will nere be heal,
Excep^ ye^ try^ your S^ill before we part,
Through your Science, Necr^mancie, or Art,
To make us Sport. And then the Friar up rose:
Taking his Book, un-to the Floor he goes.
He turns the Leaves, and reads a little space:
And to the East he turns about his Face.
Then to the West he turns, looking down.
And closde the Book, and said an Orasoun.
But still his Eyes were on the Panterye,
And on the Trogh, where-in Friar John did lie.
Then sat he down, and (...) abacke his Hoode:
Most fearfullie gaping as he^ were wood.
UUhiles sat he still, his Hands abroad fast spreading
And other whiles up-on his ^^oke was reading.
And whiles with Hands and Heels full loud would clap:
And other whiles he would both glowre, and gape.
Thus did Friar Robert read the House about:
Five, or six times, so lowly could he stoop,
When that he came near^ hand the Panterye:
Where-at our Dame had won^er great envye.
For in her Heart she had some perceiving,
That Friar Robe^t knew well her governing.
She saw him give the Panterie such state,
Until her-sel^e she said, (full well I wate)
I am but shent, the Friar knows all my thought:
UUhat shall I do? ^lace, what have I wrought!
If Simon know, it will be a dear Doing.
By that the Friar had left his studying:
Most furious^^e he stampeth on the Floor,
Then came again, and said, All hayle, my Cure.
Now is it done, and ye shall have plenty,
Bread, Meat, and Wine, the best in this Countri^:
There-fore, fair Dame, get-up full speedily,
And go your ways, in-to (...) Panterie:
Soon open it, and see ye bring us fine
A pair of Bottles, full of Ga^^^^m Wine:
UUhich hold more than a Gallon, I warrant:
And bring us eeke the Maine-Bread in the Maund.
Two roasted Conies, fat, and hot with-all:
The Capons eeke to us, Dame, bring ye shall.
Four Partriches, I know there is no less:
Of Ploovers, Dame, see that ye bring a mess.
The Good-wyfe saw Rob made no variance:
She knew that he had seen her governance.
And thought it was no boot for to deny,
But quickly went un-to the Panterye:
Then she brought forth, together with her Maid,
All that the Friar before un-to her said:
Starting abacke, as she were in effray:
Then crossed her-selfe, and smyling can she say,
Ha, Benedicitie, who has here been?
Or who has ever such like Marvels seen?
So great a wonder is now happened here:
UUhat shall I say? he is an holy Friar.
I find it sooth (...) all that he did say:
Maid, take all forth, and on the Boarde it lay.
(...) and Wy^e, and other good things more:
(...), Capons, as ye have heard before.
Partriches, Ploovers, to the Board she brought.
Friar Rob knew all, and saw there wanted naught:
But all was sooth, she brought at his devyse.
When Simon saw it happened on this wise,
He had much wonder, and swear by the Moon,
That Friar Robert full well his deed had done.
Thou art, quod he, a Man of great Science,
That have so soon made thus great Purveyance.
Thou bring here, through thy great Subtlety,
And by thine Art, and great Philosophy.
In full good time it was, that thou came hither.
(...) power out Wine, ^^d let us drink together,
And make good Ch^^^^, ^^^er this longsome day:
For I have (...)ous wildsome way.
Now GOD be^ pr^ys^e, here is sufficiance,
To serve us all, through your good governance.
And then anon they drank all round about:
Of Gascoin Wine, the Friars playde still Cup-out.
They sported them, and made full merry Cheer,
And eeke full loud sang Simon, and the Friar.
Even an this wise the darksome Night ore-drave,
Wanting no-thing that they could wish to have.
The Good Man s^^de to the Good-wyfe in hye,
Come hither, Dame, an^ ^et you down me by,
And take a part of such (...) we have here,
But first of all, I pray (...), thank the Friar,
For his benign business^, and great cure,
Which he has done to (...) upon the Floor:
He brought fine Meat, and Wine abundantly,
The^e-fore, forsooth, let us right merry be.
But sing, or say, or use what sport they please,
Unto our Dame it was but little ease.
An-other thing she had into her thought,
How she might escape, and not ^o Shame be brought,
On Friar Robert she looked grie^ouslie,
And thought through him she should discov^red be^^
And in her heart she did despa^e lyke-wyse,
That they did e^te her Dainties in that gu^se.
Yet still she sat, and durst not make her moan.
What ever they did, she let them aye alone.
^ut she drank with them in-to company,
With f^igned cheer, and heart sad and heavy.
But they were blythe enough, GOD wots, and sang,
For aye the Wine was raking them amang.
Till at the last, that they w^^^ drunk each one,
Then Simon said un-to the Friar anon.
Forsooth I marvel much ho^ this can be,
In so short time, that ye so suddenly,
Has brought to us such sto^^ of ^^intie Cheer.
Thereof have ye no marve^^ (quod the Friar)
I have a Page full privy of mine own,
When ere I please, will come to me unknown,
And bring to me such things as I would have:
Look what I please, I need it not to crave.
There-fore be blythe, and live in patience,
And trust me, Sir, I Will do my diligence,
If that ye please at this time to have more,
You shall it have: my life shall stand there-fore.
Incontinent that same heer^ shall ye see:
If ye protest ye will kee^^ secrecy.
Let no man know that I ca^ do such thing.
The Good Man swear, an^ said, By Heavens King,
It shall be kept full secret, (...) for me.
But, Brother dear, your ^ervant would I see,
If it you pleased, that we might drink together:
For I wot not if ye may aye come hither,
To have your Friendship, in such case as this.
The Friar sa^de, Sir, a^ I would feign have Bliss,
Although ye should him se^, I you warrant,
It can-not be, ye shall ^^ell understand,
(...) ye may see him in his kind,
(...) ye, a^^^e, would run out of your mind.
He is so soul, and uglie for to see,
I dare not venture for to take on me
To bring him hither, even in-to your sight:
And namely now, so late with-in the Night.
Except it be in such a sort of wise,
Him to trans-forme, or else to dis-a-guyse
From his own shape, in-to some other state.
Then Simon said, Let us have no d^bate,
As pleases you, that lyke-wyse pleases me.
^ee as he will, yet feign I would him see.
In-to what shape would ye he should appear?
The Good Man said, In likeness of a Friar,
In Habit white, like as your selves are aye:
For the white Sprites do no man harm, they say.
Friar Robert said, That ways it may not be:
That dare I not gr^unt un-to you, truly,
That he appear in-to our Habit white:
It were un-to our Or^er great despyte,
That any such un-worthie Wight as he
In-to our Habit any man should see.
Yet since it pleases you, he shall appear,
Ye shall him see in likeness of a Friar,
In Habit gray, which he^-usde for to wear:
In such a wise, that he s^^ll no man d^^re.
If you please this, then do^ as I addyse,
Hold you full close, and ^^^ll in any wy^e.
What ever it be ye eyth^^ ^ee, or hear,
Speak ye no word, nor make no kind of ^^iere,
But hold you still, till I have done my Cure.
And ye, Good Man, must stand upon the Floor,
With hardy Heart, a good Staff in your Hand^
Have ye no dread: I shall you aye warran^^
Then Simon said ^ assent (...) so:
Then up he start, and got (...)
In-to his Hand: and on the Flo^re he star^,
Something affrayde, though stalward was his Heart.
Un-to the Friar then spoke the Good Man soon,
Now tell me, Master, what ye^ would have done?
No-thing, quod he, but hold you clos^, and still:
What ever I do, take ye good heed there-till.
Near hand the Door go hyde you privilie:
When I ^id you stryke, then lay on hardilie.
Up-on the Neck be sure to hit him right.
I Will warrant that (quoth he) with all my might.
Thus on the Floor I leave him standing still,
Hyding himself, and turn again I will
To Friar Robert, who took his Book in hye,
And turned over the Leaves full busilye,
A full long space. And when he had done so,
Towa^des the South, without speaking words more,
He went apace: and on this wise spoke he,
Hay, hoe, Hurls-baigs, rise, I now conjure thee:
Stand up, foul F^ende, and so^^e to me appear,
In Gray Habit, and likeness^ of a Friar,
From out the Trogh, where thou a-long do^st lie:
Stretch forth thy Limbs, cast off the Stone in hye.
Now tumble over the Trogh, that we may see
Thy form, and shape, before us openly.
With-in this place see that thou no man grieves:
But draw thine Hands far in, with-in thy Slieves.
And pull thy Cowle low down up-on thy Face,
And thank thy God thou gettest so good grace.
With speed go pack thee, to thine own Receate.
Let this be done, and make no more debate.
And as thou passest see thou make no Fray,
W^^h any wight, but swiftly pass away.
But I command, and charge thee here before,
That in this place thou come not any more.
Now over the Staire see that thou get good speed.
For (...) will more Perils breed.
(...) that Friar John, who under the Trogh lay,
Stretche^ him ^^one: but was in great effray.
Yet up her rose, it might no better be,
And off the Trogh (...) Stone soon tumbled he.
All what Fri^r Rob had said, he did ere long:
Toward the Door he ^owned for to gang,
UUith heavy chea^e, and drierie countenance.
For ne^ before had happened him such ch^^^ce.
And when Friar Robert (...) him passing by,
Un-to the Good Man full (...) can he cry,
Stryke, Simon, stryke: (...) now is time for thee.
UUith that Simon full fellon Flappes let fli^.
UUith his Burdoun he hit him on the Neck:
He^ was so fierce he fell quyt^ ^re a Secke,
And brake his Head up-on (...) ^ustard Stone.
UUith that Friar John (...) over the Staire is gone^
In such a wise, for-sooth, he mist the Trappe,
And in a Ditch he fell, such was his hap,
Well forty foot of death, under the Staire.
Yet he got out, with Clothing no-thing fair.
Full drierilie up-on his (...) he stood.
That myrie hole had done him little good.
Yet over the Wall he climbe^ hastily,
UUas made all round about, with Stones, full hie.
And of his escape in Heart he was full feign.
I think he should be l^^th (...) come again.
At last Friar Robert (...) aba^ke, and saw,
UUhere the Good Man was ly^^^ wondrous low,
Up-on the Floor: and bleedin^ was his Head:
He caught him up, thinking he had been dead.
Friar Robert then th^ught go^^ (...) stay no more,
But presently took Simon to (...).
And when the ^^^de had well (...) his Face,
He did revive, with-in a little (...)
And then Friar Robert asked (...)
UUhat ayled him to be so (...)
He said, Yonde Fiende has made me in (...).
Let be, quod Rob, the worst is now away.
Be merry, Man, and see ye mourn no more,
For ye have stricken him quyte over the Staire.
I saw him slip, if I the sooth may tell:
Under the Staire in-to a Mire he fell.
Tush, let him go, ^ee was a Grace-lesse Guest:
And bowne ye to your Bed, ^ hold it best.
Thus Simons Head up-on (...) Stone was broken:
And eeke Friar John in-to the Mire is loppen.
He wette his Head, and dressed his Clothes full ill.
And the Good-wyfe could not get half her will.
This is a Feate, which happe^^^ of a Friar.
The LORD help us, and CH^^^T His Son so dear.
Finis.
