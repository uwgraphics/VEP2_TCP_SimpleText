TO THE REVEREND AND HONORABLE, THE VICE-CHANCELOUR And the Body of the
CONVOCATION In the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD.
HONOVR'D SIRS,
THough I am Confident I need not to refresh my former desires for the Election
of the Master of the Rolls for one of the University Burgesses in the ensuing
Parliament, yet understanding the severe opposition against him, I must needs
take leave to tell you, that I had never desired that favor either for my
Self or any Other, had I not apprehended you as ready to grant it, as I was
free and cheerful to ask it: And I have reason yet to believe, that I could
not so much mistake those Worthy persons, that gave Me a Tender herein, as to
imagine a greater favor to my self, then they or you intended Me. Gentlemen,
it is really the desire of my Heart, to be an instrument in the hand of God, to
do good in my best Services, both to your Selves, and the whole Nation, and
had I known any Person more able and ready to assist in that Great Work, I had
certainly with the same freedom proposed him: But you must give me leave to
say, it was not Favor but Choice, and that in order to the best Ends, that
fixed and determined my Thoughts upon that Worthy Person; And therefore
notwithstanding his Modesty, and self-denial herein to me, I take the
freedom still to insist upon my first desires; your Condescension whereunto
will oblige him to continue his Regards to You and the Whole Church, and much
gratify

GENTLEMEN Your very humble Servant G. Monk.
