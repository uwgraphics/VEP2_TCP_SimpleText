The mirroure of gold for the sinful soul.

THis present book is called the Mirror of gold to the sinful soul / the
which has been translated at parice out of laten in to frensshe / and after
the translacion seen and corrected at length of many clarkis / Doctors / and
masters in divinity / and now of late translated out of french in to
Englisshe by the right excellent princess Margaret mother to our souerain
lord king Henry the.vii. and Countess of Richemond and derby. The wise man
in his book named Ecclesiastes consideringe the miserye and fraylete of the
world says / that it is vanite of all vanites And all things that been in
the world present ought to be called vanites / and therefore says the holy
doctor saint Gregory that there is noon more acceptable sacrifice to god: then
is good zele / that it is to say an hernest desire to the weal of souls / For
the which cause I have willed to make and accomplisshe this present trety /
gederinge and assemblinge many diverse auctoriteis / of holy doctors of the
church / to thentent that the pore sinful soul troubled by the fraud of
enmye and often overcome: May by holy monicions and auctorites / be addressed to
the light of justice and troth / And so led by the mean of the holy gooste
that the sheep that were perisshed may be reduced and led again to their grene
paster. And to the end also that the pore soul redressed and reuokinge his
error / knowinge his sin / and by inward sorrow of concricion conuertinge
him to god / and therewith to do such penance as he fynably may with all the
saints possede the life eternal / as says Crisostome since it is so that
from day to day vanyte of all vanyteis abuses us and them that in the delites
of this my scheuous world is co^uersant they ought in their yatis / wallis and
habitacions / and their clothinge and all places where most ordinately they
use to be: that they should write and make to paynte but principally in their
conscience this fair authority vanitas vanitatu^ et om^ia vanitas. To the end
that often of the day / and of the night. they may have if before their Iene
and feel it in their heart. And for somoche that paynters / and Images of
foulysshe pleasures / deceyueth them that so deliteth? It is right confienable
and helthfull in every company as well in e^ynge and drinking as other
occupacions. often to sing and resite th^^s present wordis / vanite of all
vaneties and all thing of this world is vanite. Certainly so says
crisostome all thingis passes / but oonly the service and love of god / And
for to know the order and manner how to proceed in this little book. It is to
know it shall be divided in.vii. chapitours after the vii. days of the weke. To
thentent that the sinful soul solyed and defowlyd by sin may in every
chapitoure have a new mirror / wherein he may be hold and consider the face
of his soul.

Of the vileness and myserie of man.
Jeremy.
THe prophet Jeremy consideringe the freylte and myserie of mankind by manner
of lamentacion in writing says thus Alas I poor creature wherefore was I borne
out of the womb of my mother / to se the labor and sorrow of this world / and
to consume my days in confusion. Alas if this holy man Jeremy the which
almighty god sanctified in the womb of his mother he him self said and proffered
so piteous words: what may I say yt am engendered and conceived in the womb of
my mother by syn^e And to yt purpose says saint Barnard / Study to know thy
self for that is the thing most auayllable and more praysable to thy weal to
know thy self: then it should be to know the course of sterres / the strengeth
of herbs / or the compleccion of all men. The naturis of beestes / or the
science of all erthly thing / For in that knowleige thou know not what to
thy soul is profitable / Now consider / and behold thou mortal and
miserable man what was of the before thy nativity / And what is it of the now
sithe thou was borne / And what shall be of the to the hour of thy death / and
what shall be of the after this mortal life Certainly thou haste been from thy
beginning a thing vile / stinkynge / detestable and abhomynable / conceived
in fylthe rotennes of flesh / and stynkynge fylthy concupiscence: and in
theimbraceme^t of stinkyng lechery / and that worse is conceived in the unclean
spots of sin. and if thou behold and consider well what mete thou art
norisshed within thy moders womb: truly noon other but with corrupt and i^fect
blod / as well is known by many philosophers and other great clerks. and
after thy natiuite thou that haste ben norisshed of so foul and vile nature in
thy moders womb / as before is said: thou art also ordained to wepinges and
criynges / and to many other miseries / i^ the exile of this sorrowful world.
and that / that is more grievous / thou art also subject to thy death the which
every true criste^ man ought daily to remember / and think upon / Behold then
and consider in thy life / that among all thing that almighty god has created
and fourmed man is made of the most foul and abhomynable matter / that is to
know of the slyme of therth the which earth is the lest worthy of al other
Elime^tis / god has made the planetes and sterres of the nature of the fire.
The winds and birds of the air / the fisshes of the water / the men and
other beestes of the earth Now consider the^ the things of old a^tiquite and
thou shall find thy self most foul / and when thou shall know the other
bodies which of the fire has been made and brought forth. thou shall among al
other creto's repute thy self right vile / and miserable / and thou shall not
will or may say or think thy self semblable to celestial things / or shall be
bold to prefer thy self before the thingis erthely / but if thou will
company thy self with any creator a company the to brute be estis and thou
shall find thy self to thyem most Semblable and like / For so says the wise
Salamon / man and brute beestes semblably be comen of the earth / and to therthe
they shall return / know then how noble thou art in this world / and take heed that the beauty / the praysinge of people / the strengeth and the heat of
youth / the Riches and thonours of the world / may not keep the from
knowinge of the vilite of thy birth / And if more plainly thou desire to know
what is of the harken to the story of doctors holy saint Augustine that
spekyth in this manner Alas miserable creature what am I what is of me Certainly
I am a sake full of sin and Rotennes filled with stenche / and with blind
horror / pore / naked and subgiet to all miserable necessities / and
tribulacions / ignorante of my Enter / and outgoynge unknowing. miserable and
deedly / of the which the day passes suddenly and lightely as the shadow. And
the life waneth as the moon / and as the grene lefe on the tree that by a
little heat of son is sone dry: and with a little wind is sone beten
down. I am miserable Earth the sin of Ire / a vessel full of pride /
engendered by vileness and fylthy living in misery / and mortal / in pain /
anguisshe / and sorrow / to the which purpose says saint Bernarde that a man
is noon other thing then a foul stynkynge frothe / and a sack fulle of
rotennes / and mete to worms. And for so much as it is a thing that shewyth
by experience? behold and consider what goothe from thy mouth / thy nose /
and other condittis of thy body / And thou shalt say th^e can not be found a
more vile dunghyll / of the which thing speaks ^i^e Innocent fynable saiynge
thus. O vile noughty condition of man / behold and consider the herbs and
trees / they bring forth of them branches flowers / and fruytis / And thou
bring fourth nyttis / and stynkynge vermyn. They bring forth from them
wine / oil / and precious Bawme / and thou bring forth spetyll vryne / and
dirty corrupcion / they floresshe and odoure with swetenes and suauyte / And
thou yeldest from the thabomynacyon of stynke / for other thing can not be
brought out of the / for such as the tree is / such is the fruit / And man
is noon other thing after the form? but a tree turned up so down / of the
which the heyir be the rootys / and the block is the heed and neck / the
stokke is the breast and tharme hooles / the great branches be the arms /
and the legs / and the little branches be the fyngers / and the Tooes / And
the man is as the leef in the wind and as the stubble dried with the son /
of the which says Iobe / the man is boon of the woman / lyuyge breue and
short space of time / and replenysshed with many miseries / the which commyth
and grows as the flower / that suddenly is beaten down and flies and passes
as the shadow that never in oon self astate abides / wherefore it is spoken in
the third of genesie. That god said to man remember thou art but duste / and
too duste thou shalt turn / And for somoche says Iobe lord remember thou
haste made me as mire and duste / and thereto shall I turn again Alas pore
creature that art but slyme and mire whereof ought thou too be proud? thou
that art butte duste wherefore sholdest thou lift up thy self? thou that art
but ashes / wherefore sholdeste thou gloryfye thy self. See and consider that
thou art conceived in sin. Thy nativity in pain / and traueyll thy life in
miserye and labor / And too the death necessaryly obligide. Alas wherefore
norysshes thou thy flesh with dilycyousse meetys / and apparelles / thy self
with rich and precious habitis / when within a few days the worms shall
devour the in the earth / And thou take no head to anowrne thy pore soul
with good condicio^s and werkis the which if thou did not let it: should be
presented to god thy creator and his aungellis in the Joy of heaven / wherefore
settis thou at naught thy soul and lettes and suffers thy cursid flesh have
senyorie and governance / know it suerly that it is a great foul abusion to
make a Chamberer a maistres and a maistres a Chamberer and servant O soul
thou haste an evil household of Enmies thy friend is to the an adversary and
yeldeth a retribucion to the evil for good / and under the likeness of good is
thy cruel enmye / O cursed flesh as often times as thou sechest to norisshe
and feed it diliciously. thou addresses and lyftes up again the thy mortal
enmy / And as often as thou apparellis and ordeyns to thy self diverse and
precious vest^mentis thou armest thine enmye again the / and dispoyleth thy
self from all the faier and precious ournamentis celestial. O pore flesh
consider and be hold what thou shalt do / and what shall be come of the
after this mortal life. Certainly thou shalt be but carrion vile / and
stynkinge corrupcion And miserable meat and fedinge / to wormys. Behold the
sepulcres and toumbes of them that be asswed out of this mortal life And
thou shall furde noon other thing but asses vermen horror and stynche / I wys
they have been as thou art / and thou shalt be seche as they be. They were men
as thou art / and have even and dronken and passed the days in Joys and
delitis of this would and in a momet they be dissended in to hell / and their
flesh has be en^en with worms. And the sorrow full pour soul is deputed
to be piteously treated and tourmented in the fiere of hell unto the great
day of Judgment / after the which day both body and soul shall be buried in
eternal dampnacino. Then see what has prouffited to the cursed sinner the
vain glory of this world for they that have been folowars and follows in the
pleasant and delitis of sin be now in like wise in the tourmentis of hell
what has prouffited to them their short gladness the myghtis of the world the
delitis of the flesh and the great concupiscence of false riches. Tell me
now where be their laghingis where be now their Joys. their plays: their
vanites. and organs. O what Intolerable sorrow is be comen of thies great
Joys with the grace and bitter distres / for so little time of voluptuoes
delites as to be cast and over thrown in eternal pain ever duringe / Think
then think and often for think in thy heart / that so as to them is haponed
it may happen to the for thou art man and man is of therthe / And for so
much as thou art earth to the earth thou shall turn when the hour of death
shall come / the which is uncertain and unknown. when how or in what place
it shall come for every place alweys death watchith and geuith attendaunce. And
therefore if thou be wise. thou shall always in every place give sure
attendau^ce for him / And of them that so much loves their delites and
pleasures of the world speaks Isoder in this manner Right dear friends we
ought well to remember the little and breue time / that the felicite of this
world durith and how little the Joy of this world is and how frail / and
faylinge is the temporal might of this world Now say presently what thou may
say. where be the kings. the princis. the Emperors with the Riches / and the
powers of the world. They be as the shadow vanisshed / they seche and ask
for them And they be departed / but what shall I say you further the kings
and the princes be deed / of the which many of them thought to live long /
and had went they had been such men as death might not noye. O cursed
mischeuous pore soul / lest and of all for getton / and cast out without any
memory for thy miserable and abused sins / is not so ordained that death shall
come? certainly ye shall dye and as well a prince as other shall fall / Saint
Bernard spekinge of the condition of man after the death? says that there is no
thing more stinkinge or horrible then Carione of a deed man / for he of whom
in his life the enbrasementis and collingis were sweet and plesaunte: In the
death it is horrible / and detestable to behold. And for so much he said
after man? the worms. after the worms: stike / and horror. what proffettis
then in this present world Riches delitis and honor. The reches deliuerith
not the soul from death. The delitis deliueryth him not from worms / ne the
honors from stink: and of the seluesame saint John^ crisostome / how much
has it prouffited to them that in lechery and in voluptuoies of the body
has continued to the last day of this present life.

How lechery causes many euellis to come to man.
LEchery is enmy to all virtues and to all goodness / and for that says Boice
in his third book of consolacion / that he is happy that lives without
lechery / for lechery is a sweet sykenes / and bringith a man to death or ever
he perceive it / as witnessith valerie in his.ix. book the which valerie also
in his.iiii. book tells how Josephus in his age demaundide of on if he were
not lecherous / And he answered I pray the speak to me of so^me other thing /
For as I am advised I have had a great victory that I may by age eschew
lechery / For by lechery all euyllis commythe and to that creature all good
things be troubled / Alas what was the cause of the distruccion of the people
of Sichen? but for violacion of digne the daughter of Jacob / the which would
goo to see to the daunces / and there rauisshed as it apperith in the book of
Ienesie in the.xxiii. Chapitour. we read also of many that is to say moo then
fifty thousand were slain by cause of the lecherye comytted with the womon of
leuite / as it apperith in the.xx. Chapitour of the book of Iugis / And aman
was slain for the lechery of absolon his brother / for somoche that he had
defouled Thamar his suster / as it apperith in the secounde book of kingis in
the.x. chaptour / Abnar by his lechery knew the concupiscens of his fader
hisboseth / but within short while after they were both slain / as it
apperith in the secounde book of kings in the.iiii. Chaptour / what was the
cause of the diluuye but lechery / Behold in the sepulcres if thou find any
token of ventalse or certain signs of lechery or of Riches / See and behold
if thou find any token of precious clothinges or rich anourmentis. where be
now thabu^daunce of folisshe worldly plesauce / with great diverse / and
servants / their Joys / their solace / their inmoderate gladness / where be
they? for all memory and remembraunces thou shall find in their tombs worms
ashes / and stynkinge filthe / Remember the then that such is the end of the
most dear and Rich frendis how be it they have passed their days in such
Ioious delitis of the world / Now would it please god that thou might
perfitely think in thine heart. with contynuall labor / al these thingis. But
the cursed sons of Adam leauith the true and helthfull studies and demands
things passinge and transitorye / and therefore if thou will in thyn heart by
right deliberacion dreme and consider the vilete of this life? and fle pride /
and follow mekenes? in knowing that pride is the syn^e by the which the deuyil
dyuideth and knows his? from other. wherefore Job says i^ his.xlv. chapitur /
the devil is king over all the so^nys of pride / and saint gregory says? that
the true sign of evil me^ is pride / and the sign of good is meknes / and by
these.ii. signs be known the servants of god / and the servants of the
devil and furthermore Isodor says / yt the proud soul is left of god? and
made a habitacle of deuilles / to the which purpose says the wise man / yt
pride is to be hated of god and man. so as it well apperith. For pride cast out
lucifer from heaven / and ada^ from peradise / pride made pharao drowned i^
these / with all his army pride put saul from his relame / by pride
nabigodonosor was turned to liknes of a be / by pride anthiochus sufferd a
vilous death / by pride harod had ye persecucio^ of his tu^g

Of sins Ingenerall.
HE that does or comyttith sin is servant to the devil / the which from
his beginning comytted sin: And so as it is written in the first Canone of
saint John^ the first chapitour / syn is a deed so heavy that the heaven will not
suffer it / nor in the end the earth shall not susteyn it / but it shall discende
in to hell with him that committed it / And we ought to know also as saint
Augustyne says all things said or done by desire of concupiscence against the
law of god is sin / the which thing all creatours that willyth or desires
their salvation ought with all their diligence flee and withsta^de / and
principally for.iii. things. The first is for somoche as sin is right
displesaunt to god. The secounde is above all thingis it is pleasure to the
devil. The third for somoche that sin is most noyaunce to man. O pore
sinner and miserable man I say unto the that thou ought with souerayn diligence
flee and withstand all sin / by cause it is the thing to god thy creature
displeasau^t / Also that thou may consider and think what god has done for
hate and detestacion of sin. For god our creator for the displeasure of
sin? distroyed and put to an end nighe all his werkis That is to know all
the world by the flode of noe as it is written in the.vii. of genesie. Also we
ought to know that god has not wasted and distroyed as other kings and
princis ded waste and distroye the lands of their enmyes / for their damage
and defaultis: but god has distroyed and wasted his oonly propre land / for
the displeasure of sin / that was entered in to it in so great abundance
that all his land perisshed / And furthermore god has not sin in his
displeasour oonly but also he has displeasure with all that touches or is
perticipant with sin. And so ought we to know that god is not as the men /
for they cast not their cups pottes / and pecis of silver / and gold in to
the sea / for the corrupt wine that is within them / but they cast out the
stinkyng wine and kepith their vessels in suertie / but god does not in this
manner with syn^e for he casts not only sin away: but with that he casts
and puttith to perdicion the vessels of sin / That is to know the
reasonable creatours / whom he has made to the semblaunce of his Image / And
with his precious blood bought again from dampnacion. The which pore souls
for sin he shall cast in to the great and deep see of hell / and they so
dye. And therefore it is said in the book of sapience in the.ix. chapitour The
sinner and his sin is most in the Dignacion of god / For god has not so good
a friend in heaven: ne in earth: but that he hates to the death / if he find in
him one only mortal sin / for and saint peter had dyed in sin when he the
third time denied our lord not withstanding that he loved ihu^ crist more
bre^nyngly then any of the other apostels. He had been co^de^pned by the divine
Justice of almighty god / Secu^dly it is well showed us How almighty god
hatyth sin when he for sins of the world would make his oonly and pure
Innocent son piteously to dye the which thing witnessith Isaye in his book
the fyfty and fourth Chapitour sayng I have delivered and given my only son
to death for sin of people / for the son of god so as it is written i^ the
same book of Isaye? has willed to deliver his soul to death / to distroye
sin. Now consider who is he then that for the hate of his enmye would make
his oonly and propre son to dye. Thirdely this same self thing is showed in
that almighty god in the first beginning cast sin out of heaven / And god
seeing yet that syn^e continued in the earth: he of his mercyful goodness and
frewyll. Descended from heaven in to the world and put out sin / And at the
day of Judgment he shall cast and close sin in to the pytte of hell.
wherefore Michee says in the last Chapitour he shall cast in to the depth of
the sea our sin / For god in the great day of Judgment shall cast in the
deep see of hell the sinners with their sins Fourthly it is to show that
god souerainly has sin in open detestacion by this similitude / for the
good mother has inwardly the thing in hate by the which she should put her
son in brennynge fire and never take him out. So in like wise is it of almighty
god. For not withstandinge he has loved his children with so brennynge love.
That for them he had will to dye / when the day of Judgment shall come he
shall condemn them in to everlasting fire if he find in them one only
mortal sin / And thou pore sinful soul then for so much that thou see
and understands how much almighty god hates / and has abhomynacion of
sin: if thou will please him: thou ought before all thy workis flee and
withstand all sin / And give him in the no place / ne habitacyon. For thou
well know that the wife should be right untrue that would ley in her bed a
man that should pursue the death of her housbounde / whereby many euyllis might
come to him. Now is it so then that sin is the thing that our lord Ihu^
cast the true spowse of souls which he has so much willed to love that by
their contynuau^ce of syn many euillis has hapened them / and fynably the
death / And therefore right dear friend think of thy salvation / and flee sin
/ and harken the monicion of David the prophet the which says i^ this manner
O my almighty god I pray the give me a fyrme / pure / and clean heart / And
that it lists to renew my inward perties / with thy holy and sacrid
spirit. Secoundely thou ought souerainly and with all diligence flee sin /
principally deedly sin for that is the thing that most pleases and
reioisith our goostely enmye the devil / as thou may know by three signs /
The first is that the fend askethe noon other disporte or winning but only
the souls. wherefore it is written i^ the.xl. chapitour of genesie that the
devil spoke to god: saying to him in this manner / give me the souls of thy
creatures / and all the remnaunt keep to thy self. And saint Gregory says /
that the devil estemyth or Iuges no thing done that pleasithe him: if it
hurt not the soul. with the darte of deadly sin / For he does as the bird
for his pray. He sercheth nor askith noon other thing for his refeccion but
the heart / In likewise the devil asks of man no thing but the soul / The
secounde thing is that the devil above all desires and loves sin / For his
co^tynuall temptacion / For in co^myttyng of sin / he was never weary ne over
traueled. For he has been purchasing sin by the space of.vi. M. year and
more / and never was weary nor fatigate / but always sercheth and enquireth the
new manner to make the creatur to committee syn^e. For as it is written in the
first chapitur of Iobe that when almighty god asked of the devil from whens he
come he answered that he had circuyed all therth / The which is a sign he
occupied always to move sin / and never can take rest / and for this cause is
the auctorite following taken i^ the book of Iobe i^ the.iii. chapitour saying
in this manner / they yt devour me slepith not. The third sign whereby it may
be known that the fe^de is souerainly pleased with syn^e For so much he was
never satisfied with syn^e / not withstanding yt he has by sin deuored
infinite thousands of men / and yet is he always hu^gry as the ragious lion
ever sechi^g how he may devour moo / And as saint Peter says he is not only
hungry of mete but with yt he thurstith for drink / whereof says Iobe the
flode is horrible and the devil merueleth not thereof / for he has trust that
the flode of Iordane shall enter in to his throat that is to say in to hell /
and the flode that the deuell so swaloeth without meruelinge is the sins
coming day / and night in to the swallowinge of hell / the which he desires
souerainly to devour / And more clerly to prove that the devil takith in syn^e
his dilectacion we have an example in the life of faders / in the chapitour of
deuylles. how one of them a monge other was praised and honored of his prince
of deuylles / and was set i^ a chair before all other / in sign of victory
Because that he had led / and brought to the sin of fornicacion a monk / the
which by the space of.lxiii. year before he might not draw to sin / Now
therefore synful soul weep bitterly / as long as thou have rejoiced against
the? thy enmies. That is to know the fendis / whom thou have rejoiced / as
many times as thou have mortally sinned / And for the time to come? order the
by pure confession / and worthy satisfaccion? to make thy lord god Joy in the
/ with all his aungellis. for as says saint Luke in his xv. chapitour / the
aungelles of heaven reioyces them. when a sinner is converted and does
penance / Thrydely thou ought studiously to flee and withstand sin / for
it annoyeth the / and is more contrary to the then any other thing / in
somoche that by sin we beparted from the love of god / and be made his
enmyes. as says the prophet Isaye in his.xix chapitour Our iniquities has
put division bitwene god and us / And our sins has withdrawn his face from
us / that is to say from our vision. For there is noon in paradise so just
nor so holy? if he committed sin? but a noon he should fall in to he. and
lose the love of god / to the which purpose says saint Augustyne / he that
co^mytteth fault or sin against his true and most true friend? ought to be
reputed greatly reprouable Now then it behooves the to know and understand
that by a more strong reason he that co^myteth fault or sin against the
souerayn and debonayre all mighty god? ought well to be reputed and of al
holden abhomynable. Four thely it is to know that by sin the sinner is Iuged
to the Iebet of hell / and for so much as the law of god is not far
different fro the law of man? Therefore in like manner all the brekers of the
law of man? which does trespace against the kingis Royal magestie? be
worthy to death / and ought to be punysshed corporally. So in sembliable wise
the pore and miserable sinners: which have offended not oonly the temporal
prince: but to the heavenly king: ought well to be condemned and to be hanged
in hell perpetually / as it is written in the book of Esdras the.xiiii.
chapitour / And in like wise in decre of daryous / in the which he says thus
/ it ought to be showed that who so ever trangresseth and breketh the law
yeuen and written as touching the sin of co^myssion: or ellis dispises it: as
touching the sin of omyssion: they ought to take of the propre wode that is
to say of the gardeyn of their propre conscience / for in the conscience growyth
a tree whereon the sinner is hanged / and his good deeds be forfeated and
ascribed / For by cause he has offended and despised the law of his prince.
Also in like wise the punysshemente of sins in wicked creatures: retourneth
to the glory of the heavenly king as the reward of glory is Joyful to him:
of them that be good. So may thou se that the law of man does bodily / and
the law of god does spiritually / and that same almost is read in the.vii.
Chapitour of hester / where it is said / take a man and hang him on the Iebet
/ by a man is understand a sinner which the heavenly king shall command to
be hanged on the Iebet of hell / if he find him in mortal sin / Fyftely
sin dispoylethe man in this world from all goodness and grace And in the
other world from eternal Joy / so as it is written in the.xiiii. chapitour
of proverbs / sin / makes man pore and miserable / for truly the sinner
ought well to be called pore when he has no thing but has lost him self by
dedly sin / and from fredome is entered in to the seruytute of the devil /
yet ought the sinner to be called more pore / for he may no thing wine being
in such astate / nor may do any works meritorious or agreeable to god / and
finably / may be called right pore / for noon may give to him any thing yt good
is / for it shall profit him no thing to the health of soul / for he has
no life but only in the body / the soul is as ded. whereof Boice says in
his.iiii. book of consolacion / an evil man is noon other wise to be called
but a deed man. For man by sin is departed from the light of god / and
derkely blyndide. For as it is written in the sophologie in the first
chapitour / They shall walk as blind / that have sinned against god. And as
the psalmyste says / they have not known ne seen the way of their health /
And therefore they walk in derkenes / to this purpose says saint Jerome / The
soul polluted by sin? is depryued and beaten down / to the end that he is
not worthy or has power to behold on high / And it is to be known that
sin is as the rotennesse in an apple / for as the putrifaccion takes from
the apple the color and odoure? So does sin take from man the odor of
good renown / and of Joy? the colloure and beauty / with the savor of grace
wherefore sin of good right? well may be called rotennesse / of the which
speaks Isaye in his.xv. chapitour / saiynge / he that does sin ledeth a more
foul life? then is the myere or any rotennes of therth. And saint Augustyne
says and recitith / that it is a more sweet odor to man to smell a nold
stynkinge roten deed dog: then is a sinful soul to god and of this matter
spekith saint augustine in a sermon the which he made / and by him was drawn.
A syn^er there p^sent? in to the way of salvation. Now advise and consider
pour and miserable sinner. what avails to the thy cofer full of wordly
goods / if thy conscience be void from all good works / and dedis thou
couetys to have worldely goods / and thou will not be good thy self. Art thou
not ashamed to have thy house full of goodis: And thou replenisshed with so
many euyllis. Now answer me to this question what is it that thou woldeste
have euyle. First thou would not have a neuyle wife / evil children / nor
euile servants / nor yet evil gown / nor evil hoseen. And yet thou cursed
and herted in thy sin. would lead stylle a cursed life. Now I pray the
for thine own health: love not more deerly thy hosen then thy self / that is
to say so as thou would not have euile hose^ which is one of the semplest
aparelmentis of thy body: will not thou to led an euile life. for the good life
is oon of the fairest apparel of the soul all the thingis that thou see
fair and plesaunte: thou holds them and reputis them as dear / But and thou
see well thy self: thou shall repute the as vile / and stinking and think
thou verily if the gooddes wherewith thy house is filled had power to speak they
would cry against the / saying with an high voice / thou would have and
possede us after thy appetite / and will / and we would have a good true lord.
harken how they cry against the in addressinge their desires to god. O true
god creator of the world why have thou yeue^ to this man so much good and he
is so euyle what may it prouffite him the great goods that he possesses.
when he has no in him the true love of god. that all has yeuen him /
Sixtely it is to be noted / that by sin man is be come a brute be / And
therefore says Boice in his.iiii. book of co^solacion / A man good / Just /
and true: if his wisdom and Justice be left: he is no more man. For as soon as he yeueth him to sin: he is converted to a brute be / And the
phelosopher in his Ethiques says / That he is not oonly a be but worse and
more detestable then a be. To the which accordith David the prophet
saying in this manner / man duringe the time that he was in honor: and to god
agreeable: had no will to understand his health but fell from god / wherefore
he is compared to brute bestis: and foul / and is made to them semblable. for
the.vii. and last point it is to be noted / that of sin is borne deuilles
servitude. whereof writes saint John^ in his first Canonique in his third
Chaptour: he that makes or co^mytteth sin: is servant to the devil.
wherefore all these thingis considered: thou pore soroufull and miserable sinner
have mercy and pytie of thy soul. and have no will to put thy soul. in to
sin: butte remember how by thy cursed sins thou haste offended and wrathed
thy lord god. And that thou haste rejoiced thy great enmye the deuylle. and
done / damage to thine neyboure. Now then I pray the pore sinful man know
the noblenes of thy soul and how great and grievous has be the wou^des of
her comytted by sin. For the which of necessite the son of god has
suffered so grievous passion. For certainly if the wounds of thy soul had been
mortal: the son of god had never suffered death for their remedy will not
then to desoule and disprayse. when thou see and know that his right high
mageste has had so much pytye and compassion of his soul. And says it is
so that he has shed tearis and wepinges for the / wasshe thou then thine bed
nightly with tearis of penance and co^tricion. He has shed his blood for the
/ shede thou thy tearis for him by contynuall penance. Behold not that / that
the flesh would / but consider that which the soul secheth and demau^dith:
For as says saint Gregory / for asmoche as the flesh in this world lives
swetely in the delytes and pleasauntis thereof whithin a short space of time
after the life corporal: the soul eternally shall be tourmented. and asmoche
more as the flehe in this world shall be chastised so much more shall the soul
have Joy and glory in the other world. wherefore says saint Augustine let
us leave and put behind us for the honor of Ihesu criste: the thingis that be
to be left and that lettyth the health of our souls / to the end that for
things transitorye: we lose not eternal / and consider that if it were said
to the take and use at will the goods and delites of this world / asmoche as
shall please the / on that condition: that after thy Iene shall be taken from
the / and thou shall all the remenau^t of thy life contyune in lang wish /
hungre / pain / and myserie. certainly I am sure thou woldeste never then
desire such temporal gooddes: Now consider and rise diligently then / For
all the course of the life of man is not to compte one monethe or one day / or
one hour / of space or time: in regard or comparison of the perpetual
curside pains of hell / that has noon end. And to the which noon other
pain is semblable nor hable to be compared.

How we ought with all diligence do penance.
SAint Mathewe in his.xiiii. Chapitour says that our lord wyllinge and
admoneshinge the creature to do penance: spekith in this manner / He that
takes not his cross and follow me? is not worthy to have me / by this cross
we be taught and given to understand penance / the which all sinners ought
to take and bear perseuerauntly / if he desire in the beatitude eternalle to
reign with Ihesu criste For as says saint Jerome in apistole that he wrote
to Susanne saying thus / penance is to the sinner necessary / and ought to be
so much / that it be sufficient for the crime done against god / or for the
more merit that the penance excede the sin / And as saint Augustyne says
who that will be saved / it behooves him and is to him necessary: often to
purge and wasshe his conciens / with tearis / from all the filthes / and
uncleanness where with he has poluted and defilyde him self from the time of
his baptism: But perauenture thou that have given and had all thy pleasure
of the world: will say in this manner. Thy sermond and the words that thou
sayste to me in aduising me to do penance: me seems very hard / For I may
not dysprayse the world / another correct / ne chastyse my flesh / Alas
poor sinner herkyn the / Doctrine not of me / but of holy saint Jerome / that
says in this manner. It is inpossible that a man may use and Joy the goods of
this present world here: in fyllynge his Belly and accompliss hynge his will
and thought: And after this world thinkith to have the delitis in the heavenly
world / for he can not have his Joy in this earth here: and have the great
glory in heaven. The which sentence confermeth sancte Gregory saying thus: many
there be that couite and desire to flee from the present exile of this would
/ in to the glory and Joy of peradise: but yet would they not leave their
worldly delitis / the grace of our lord Ihu^ calls them / But the cursed
concupiscence of this world reuoketh and with draws them / They would
gladly dye as right wise people does: but they would not lie as they do. And
therefore they shall everlastingly perysshe / and follow their works in to
holles / and there to be in perdurable dampnacion. To this purpose speaks
saint Barnarde to the sinners that refuse penance / O miserable syn^ers know
consider in your hearts the life and strayte co^uersacio^ of glorious saint
John^ Baptiste / which strayte life and conversation: is to all delicious
sinners not willing to do penance: the very messenger of eternal death Alas
we pore miserable and unreasonable bestes and worms of therth: wherefore be we
proud / dispyteous and displesau^t to do penance / since that we see that he
that among al men was borne the most great: has wylled his holy body pure /
clean / and Innocent / to chastise by penance / And we desire to clothe and
anourne our sinful bodies with precious clothinge / And the good holy saint:
had none other clothinge to his boody but the hard sharp skin of a Camyl we
couete and desire to drink delicious wynes: and saint John^ the Baptiste that
glorious friend of god drank in the deserte noon other thing but clean and
pure water / behold than miserable sinner: Ought thou then flee doing of
penance and follow worldely pleasures: I wys nay / for certainly it is not the
way to paradise / and more to move thine heart to penance and to flee the
delitis of this world: remember the of the evil Rich man / that was lord and
master of so great Riches / and was daily clothed with precious habitis / of
purpyll / the which / not withstandyng all the delitys that he had in this
world: after his mortal life was passed: might not atteyne to have in the
necessyte of his brennynge and heat one oonly drope of water / for to
refresshe and cool his tunge Therefore remember these things dear friend and
do penance while thou have time and space / and trust not to much of length
of days / For though almighty god have promiside perdone and mercy to them
that will do penance / he has not promisyd them certain time to leave / nor
yet a day hour ne mynute. And if thou will know what is penance I say unto
the it is weeping tears of co^tricion for thy sins passed / with fyrme
purpose never to committee them more / For as says saint Augustine the penance
is vain: which sin following defilith. And the weeping no thing profetith
whenne they return again to syn^e. Nor to ask perdon of god: and will to
fall again to sin. And for more declaracion thou ought to know and note
that there be three manners of penance / that is contricion with heart /
confession with mouth / and Satisfaccion with warkes / For that three manners we
offend god that is to know. The delectacion of thought by inprudence of words
/ and by warkes of pride / and for that / that by the contrare it must be
curide: we must make satisfaccion to god in three other manners / puttinge
contricion against the delectacion of sin / confession against inprude^ce
of words / Satisfaccion against the warkis of pride. Now see thou first what
is contricion / Contricion is a sorrow wilfully taken for sins committed and
done / with full purpose to abstain to make true confession and dew
satisfaccio^ / and as says saint Barnard the sorrow ought to be in iii. manners
/ that is to say sharp / more sharp / and sharpest / Right sharp: for cause
we have offended our sovereign lord god creator of all things. And more
sharp: for we have inpungued our celestial fader that so swetly has norisshed
and fed us / And in that we so have offended him: we may be reputed wors then
dogs / for the dogs of their nature: louyth and folowes them that
norissheth and fedith them. Thirdly contricion ought to be most hard and
sharp: For so much that in co^mytting sin we offend god. And crucify and
tourment our redemer / that has bought us with his propre blood: and delivered
us from the bonds of sin / and has delivered us from the cruelte of
deuylles / and the pains of hell / wherefore we ought to have sorrow and
displeasu^ce of three thingis. That is to wit of syn^e committed by good deeds
left and time lost as spekith saint Augustyne saiynge contricion of heart is
more worth: then all the pylgrimages of the world / and in a clause made upon
the psalm Ad du^m cum tribularar. It is said god can not despise ne
withstand the repentance of a contrite heart: that with very co^tricion
besechith his mercy / And in like wise says saint John^ Crisistome /
Contricion is that oonly thing that makith a soul to hate the fresshe habitis
/ and makes him ready to love sharp clothinge of hear / to love tearis / to
hate and flee plesauntis and laughingis / for there is no thing that so
conioyneth and vnityth the soul to god: as the tearis of a penytente. And to
the contrary says saint Augustyne we may not give the devil morre sharp
sorowis: then to heal our wounds of sin by confession and penance. But
alas how be it that by penance and contricion we may get so much weal: And
yet few folkis be that would do penance / wherefore thus our lord
complains him / spekinge by Ieremye / there is no man spekyth that good is:
nor that would do penance for sin committed and done. The secounde that is
to say confession is laufull and sufficient occasion and declaracion of
sinners trespace / before the priest: For this word confession is as much to
say / as an hole shewinge or shewinge of all to geder. For he truly
confessithe him hoilly: that says all / Confession also as says Isodore in
the book of his ethimologies / is that thing by which the secreat sekenes of
the soul under hope of pardone and mercy is made open to the praysinge of god
/ of the virtue of which saint Ambrose upon the psalm beati inmaculati says:
the vengaunce of god seassith: if mannys confession make him self clean. And
Cassidore upon the psalm of. Confiteantur tibi populi deus says / that god
is not as Judge / But as an advocate for them that by true confession condemns
and yeldith them self gilte: And pore leo says that the sin abidith not to
condemn man in judgment which by confession has been purged. And saint
Augustyne in the book of penance says confession is the health of soul / the
mynyshere and consumer of sin / restorer of virtues / And the withstander and
ouercomer of the devil / and what more / confession shettes the gates of hell /
And openith the gates of paradise / And for these forsaide causis right dear
friend trust the counsel of Isaye. Tell thyn iniquite so as thou may be
Justified For the beginning of Justice is confession of sin: wherefore it
behouith to confess the of all thy sins holy of the which thou canste know
any remembrance to one priest which has power to assoyle the / so that thou
tell not perte of thy sins to one priest: and perte to an other. For if thou
should confess the after such manner / another the oon priest ne the other
might assoyle the / for as says saint Barnard / he that deuidethe his
confession to diverse co^fessours: has no perdone / For it is detestable
faynyng of him / that deuideth and withholdeth his sin from showing the
verray profoundenes of his sin enteerly. And they that makith such
confession / receives exco^municacion for absolucion / and malidiccion for
blessing Sushe divisions and co^fessions is made by ypocrisie For they show
their great grievous sin to the prestes which they know not. And to thyem
that be of their familier knowledge: they show their most light sins / whereof
says saint Augustine as it is written in the decree / He that deuideth his
confession is not to be praised in no condition / For he kepith counsel
from the on / that he shows to the other / the which thing he does by
manner of ypocrisie / to thentent to be praised. Now let us speak then of
satisfaccion the which Saint Augustyne Diffynyth in this manner / Satisfaccon
is to withstand and leave the causis of sin: and not to favor his
suggestions ne admonicions: saint Gregorye says we make not satisfaccion by
seassynge of sin: if we leave not the voluptuous bylongeing thereto. And show
wepinge and lamentacion unfeigned / for our sin to the which purpose says
Crisostome such as the offense before has been comysed: such wise ought
again to follow the reconsiliacion and satisfaccion. And asmoche to be
inclyned to wepyngis and lamentacion as thou haste been inclyned to sin. And
to take as great / devotion to penance: as thou haste had great intent to
commytte sin. For thy great and mighty sins desires the great
lamentacions whereof says Eusebeus bishop / by light contricion may not
be paid the deibte the which is due to the death eternal: For sin / ne
with little satisfaccion the fire eternal that is made read for the evil may
be quenched / but many be soon weary in this mortal life to do penance and
return from the way of satisfaccion / lokynge bakwarde as did the wife of
loathe: against the which spekythe saint Barnarde in a sermonde: and says /
he that perfectely felythe and perceuyth the peysaunt deeds of sin and the
lesyon and sekenes of the soul: can not lyghtely feel and perceive the pains
of the body / nor repute the labors any thing: by the which he may do a
way sins passed and withstand them that be to come / And as saint
Augustine says upon the.xv. psalm / many be that have no shame to committee
sin / but they have great shame to do penance / O vnbelefull creature and
far out of thy reason / canste thou not have shame and horror of the great
wou^des of sin: See thou not what foul stink and Rotennes is therein run
to the medicyne and do penance and say my lord god my creature I know mine
Iniquite / and so clerly: that my sin is always against me / to the oonly I
have committed sin which is oonly withouten sin / Farthermore it is to be
known that satisfaccion is in three things / that is to wit in prayer /
alms and in fasting. To the end that the noumbre of three be opposite against
three falce and deuely sins / prayer against pride / Fasting against
concupiscence of the flesh / and alms against Covetous / And for all thing
that is committed against god is ordened prayer / And for the sin against
his neighbor is ordained alms: and for the sin against him self / is
ordained fasting / And for more declaracion of satisfaccion he fpekyth somewhat
of alms Alms is as much to say after the manner of spekinge: as
commandment of mercy. And in this manner ought this word to be written
Elemosina by E and some time they write Elimosina by I then is it asmoche to
say as the commandment of god / For he him self commanded it to be done
with his own propre mouth: whereof says Ieremye / give alms: and all
things shall be you pure and clean / Or thirdly Alms may be said after sum the
water of god / for as water quenches fire of alms deed quenches sin.
wherefore it is to know that three things principally ought to move us to do
and accomplisshe alms / and works of mercy. The first is / for mercy bieth
again the gilte of sin / for so much as it is wirtten in the proverb in
the.xvi. Chapitour / by mercy vanite and iniquity is bought again / And
danyell resitith in his xiiii. chapitour speking of a woman that put in all the
vessellis that she had a little quantite of oil. And a noon the oil grew
i^ such manner that she paid and pacified her creditours. The vessellis of the
woman / betokens the poor people which we should call in to our housis:
For as says Isaie in his.liii. chapitour led and call the poor to thy house
and keep them: And with that thou haste: that is to say distrybute part of
thy substance to this pore vessels / much like to that says Thobye if thou
have little to give yet study to give and departith the pore wyllingly / For
then shall grow the oil of mercy / when by gracious meritis. the sinful
soul has made satisfaccion to god for his sins. The secounde thing that
ought to meue us to give alms is / for it increases and multiplyes the
temporal goods / as says saint Gregory in his dialoge / worldly substance
be multiplied. For so much as they be destribute and yeuen to the poor. we
have example in the third book of kings in the xvi. chapitour of the widow
that fed healy / to whom almighty god multiplied booth bread and oil /
whereby it is vnderderstande that more is to almous profitable to them that
fedeth the pore: then to the pore that receives it. Thirdly wherefore we ought
to do alms and works of mercy is: for that / that almous keeps the alms
yeuer / of the hour of death / and ledeth with clernes and Joy his soul to
the Realm of heaven. And therefore says saint Ambrose / that mercy is the oonly
help to them that been passed. O what felyshyppe is it of alms to him that
dies / leave not then so true and so good a servant / nor put such an
advocate behind thy back / ne do not as they that in their life withholddeth
their goods by such brennynge Covetous: that never with their propre hands /
departed alms to the pore / For such be semblable to him that for to see
clerly his ways berith his light behind his back / but do as is taught to
the by Ecclesiasticus / say not to thy friend of thy soul that is to say to
Ihesu criste: or to the pore that shall ask the alms. My friend goo and come
again to morrow and then I shall give the / All be it that that thou may
give him. when he askyth it. For it is to be known that the rich of whom
the poor asks alms: ought to consider three things First who it is that
asks / for god him self loves so much the poor that all that is yeuen to
them in the honor of him: he repentis to him self. And for so much as it
is written in the third Chapitour of saint Mathewe / all that ye shall do to
any / oon of the leest seruauntis: ye do it to me / god by the pore demands
alms of the Rich / and the rich demands of god the realm of heaven / so
that the rich ought well to dread to refuse or deney his almous to the poor /
leest that almighty god will deny his prayer and asking of the Realm of
heaven. For it is written in the proverbs in the.xxi. Chapitoure / He that
closes his eers when he hereth the poor cry: the time shall come that he
shall cry and god shall not here him. Secoundly / the rich should well
consider what thing it is that god asks when by his poor people he askethe
almous / Certainly he asks no thing of ours / But god asks his oonly
owen / wherefore he may well be called unkind to god: when he denies to the
poor his necessary almous: when he has metys and drynkes with other
goods aboundauntely: the which things well considered David: where he says
in paralipomynone in his.xxix. Chapitour. Oo my god and my lord all thing be
thine: and we have noon other thyngis to give the but oonly that / that we have
received and taken of thy hand. For trewely our lord god asks by the poor
no thing: butte that is his: and apperteynethe to him: and not to have yeuen
/ butte oonly to lean it / And not oonly to yield therefore the dowble or
third part: but as an vsuret will encreace it a hundredth times more^ O poor
sinner do then after the saiynge of saint Augustyne / give to god for usury
and thou shalt take an.C. times more and possede the life eternal To much
thou art unkind if thou will not give to god. For god to vsuri as thou would
do to a Jew or a sarasyne. And therefore consider all these thyngis / and I
derely pray the assemble to gether the pore / and by them make thy treasour
in henen / in doing the works of mercy: and make not thy tresoures here in
the Earth / but the heart of a covetous man is as a pytte without a bothome.
The more it receives the more it would have And yet it is never full / And so
says Ecclesiasticus in the.vii. Chapitour. The covetous man shall never be
fulfilled with money / for the heart always folowith the treasour / sorrow may
be said to them that in perlyous exile of this world makyth their treasoure
/ and upon that says crisostome: assemble thy substance in place and
country: where shall be thy dwelling / for he that makith his tresoure but in
the earth: shall noon have in heaven when he no thing has put there / And believe
suerly that the thing thou shall find there: is oonly the good thou haste
yeuen to the poor. The goods be not a mannys which he may not guide ne bear
with him / Now understand the fair auctorite of saint Ambrose / he says that
no thing is of so great co^mendacion toward god as pity and charity / the
good doctor said I have behold many books and scriptures butte I can not
remember that I have found of any man: that wyllingly has excersised the
works of mercy and pytie and viliously dyed And pope leo says he yeueth and
sends to god precious and encere fruytis: that never lectyth the pore depart
from him dispurneid or sorrowful. For the virtue of mercy is so great / that
without that: all the other may not prouffite. And how be it that a man be
true chaste / sobyre / garnisshed / and adryched with many other virtues: if he
be not mercyful and piteous never shall he find mercy. And this that I have
said of virtues / Alms and works of mercy / conceruyng the pore people
suffisyth / And now we shall return to the purpose of the beginning of this
Chapitour / where it is said: he that takes not his cross and co^myth after
me: is not worthy to be with me. this cross ought to be taken in the time of
youth / and strenghte to the which purpose it is said in the secou^de
chapitour of Ecclesiastice: remember the of thy ceator in the days of thy
youth / For then it profityth a man most: and most pleasyth god / In like
wise he says / son tarry not to co^uerte the to god: and differ not from
day to day / For his Ire shall come on the sodeinly. And in the time of
vengeance he shall distroye the / But against the helthefull counsel of the
wise / the devil yeueth and promises to man enyl and damnable hope of long
life saying thou art young and shall live and thou may goo to confession and
do penance. O thies poor sinners how they be deceived that so lightly
believes in his deceytis: and in the false hoope of long life / purposynge in
their aige to currecte them self / and amend / and then comes soden death
/ and fynably rauyssheth and takes them to dampnacion. And for so much as it
is said in Ecclesiastico in the.xxix. chapitour That by the promission and
hope of long life many be put to perdicion. Now is it then to note that
such deuilishe promise of long life and thinking to do penance in age: is
full euylle / for it is against right and reason / And yet is it worse / For
it is also against the sinner him self / And more evil it is against the
sovereign bou^tie of god / and that it is against right and reason it apperith
by three ensamples / the first example is: that who that had.x. asses and
should give the gretest burden of charge to bear to the most feeble: he should
do against reason and good Justice. And so will he that oonly will give to him
self in his aige the charge and burden of the sins that he has committed
in his youth / and strength / for then he yeueth the burden to the most
feeble ass: that is to say to the debilitie of age / For in age man has no
strength ne virtue to bear labor or pain. And they that so differ their
penance: deserves malediccion of god as it is written in zacaria in the
first chapitour / The man full of fraud is cursed that in his bestiall life
has done many euyllis / and makyth sacrifice to god of the worste / and the
most poor amendment. And in like wise is he cursed that in the delitis of
this world passes the time of his youth and strength / and differreth to
make true sacrifice unto almighty god: till the time of feeble and old aige
come upon him / And therefore says Isodore / he that lives the conuenable
time of penance / It shall be to him but as void thing to come to the yate of
god to pray. The secounde example is / that he that in his strength and power
is not hable to lift a ferdell in his youth: and when he comes to feebleness
of aige then would take upon him the charge: might welbe reputed a very
fool. So in like wise is he that in his youth whiles strength is in him: woll
not take upon him the deeds of penance which then may be to him light.
And hops better to do them in his age when there shall be augmented in him:
great debilite and feebleness / he well may be resembled to a fool. whereof as
it is said in the life of faders that one went and kutte a fagotte of wood
and then assayed to lift it / and found it to heuye. And yet he went to an
other wood and put in more / and would have lyfted it / and found it so
much more heavy to bear / In this manner does the sinners when they take the
charge of sins and leueth to do penance / from day to day putting and
adioynynge sin upon sin. For as says saint Gregory / the sins that by
penance is not purged and taken away: of his nature desyrith and drawyth to
him other sins. The third example is / he that all his life has had
great study and cure with work men to prepayre and make an house in the
which he never has purpose ne hoope to inhabit ne dwell / And the house
which he desires to dwell in would utterly distroye to his power: It were a
just cause to repute him a defamed fool. Now ought men then to know and
understand that so is it of the syn^er yt unto the death desires to turn him
to god and always desires and coueteth to live in the delytis and voluptuysnes
of this sorrowful and miserable world: following evil companyes / by the
which he has great occasions to commytte many deedly sins / by the mean
whereof: He all the time of his life is making ready and prepayreth his house in
hell / where no man should will to dwell. And therefore ought they to dred
and doubt the sentence of sancte Paul / who says / he that gooth and does
against his conscience: he edifieth him self an house and lodging in hell.
And for to show and prove that the promise and hoope of long life is yet more
evil against the sinner. It apperethe and is to us clerly showed by two
examples. whereof the first is he that should desire rather to be seek then
hole and in servitude rather then in lybertye: and to have no thing lever then
to possess his perte of all the goods of the world: he should be against him
self In like condition is the sinner when he tarieth to do penance For he
loves better to be in sin which is the spiritualle sekenes of soul. And
not oonly sykenes but eternal death. Desires rather his dedly sykenes then his
eternal life / whereby it clearly apperith that of the obstinate syn^er it
ought well to be said that he is evil against him self so that he loves
sekenes better then health and death then life / servitude / then fredome /
evil then good / As says saint John^ in his canonique / He that does sin
is in the servitude of sin / And saint Augustyne says that a man good just
/ and true. Not withstanding that he be in servitude is in his bounte keep
always free and in his fraunchies / But the evil sinful man not withsta^dynge
he reign and be dred and honored in this world he shall always dwell in
cursed servitude / and that worse thing is to say: as long as he shall
endure in the boundage of vices and sins He shall be in the boundage of evil
lords and reulers. The secounde example is this / he that should owe a great
sum of money to a usurer which should grow and be augmented from day to day
So that he should not be in power to pay it but would ever tarry as long as he
might. He should greatly do against him self / so to purpose asmoche more as
the sinful man shall dwell in sin: so much more shall he be bound to pain
whereof it is written in the book of apocalips in the.xvi. chapitour asmoche as
the sinner glorifieth him in his delitis so much more he yeueth him self to
tourmente weeping and pain. Thyrdely the promise of long life is right euylle
and dangerous / in so much as it is against the will of god / as it the
apperyth by.iii. examples / the first is if it were that a young man were
impungnynge and contrary to his master: of the which he should have all his
weall by the space of his life. And that he then left his propre lord and
master / for to serve the Enmye of the same during the time of his strength
and youth. And when he should comme at impotencie and be atteynted with aige
and feebleness: thanne would return to his first master in offering him his
service for the remmenaunte of his life: such a servant might well be
reputed of evil and untrue condition / and no thing to be thought agreeable
to the service of such a man In this manner is it of the sinner / he offends
god and seruyth his enmye the devil / endurynge his strength and youth and
purposith / to serve god in his feeble aige. The secounde example is / if there
were any that had received of his lord gerate gyftis and goods whereby he
might have great winning and advantage: and if he would dispende and waste
them for naught: he might well be called a fool / and unkind to his
master / the which thing does the sinner indirectely doing against the
goodness of god. And in committing sin dispendeth foleously and wastethe
unkindly the goods that his creatoure has yeuen him / that is to know /
the soul / the body / the wit by the which his soul is enoblisshed / the
strenght and virtue of his body / his worldely goodis temporal / the space of
his life / and many other fair and great yeftys and benyfictis that of god
he has received / saint Gregory speaking of the soul: which god has given
us as a precious tressoure / to use reasonably in doing meritorious works: by
the which we may get the Realm of paradyse says in this manner / Curses
and sorrows be to me if I by my neclygence fail to keep the Treasoure and
Iowell that the precious lamb undefiled Criste Ihesu has wylled full derely
to bye again. And for the time that god has given us in this mortal life as
says the said saint Gregory: thou haste not in this world day / hour / ne
mynett / ne space of time. whereof thou ne shalt yield acco^mptis before god /
How and in what operacions thou haste inployed thy time. The third example is
if the seruauntis which have the dispendinge of their lords goods give to
strangers and his Enmyes the best bread and wynes and give and mynystre to his
lord the vitaylly that be corrupt rotten and stynkynge: He should do
unjustly and falsely against the will of his master / and right so does the
sinner that all the best time of his years that is to say in his youth
geuyth him self to the world and to the devil: which be the enmyes of Ihesu
criste and purposes to give to god the worste which is the old end of their
life: Alas did not thus which said / my god my creatoure my strength my
beauty and my youth: will I oonly to thy service keep and to this purpose it
is said in ecclesiatices give not to god the rottennes and dregs of thine
aige butte present unto him the free wine pure and clean of thy florisshinge
youth / Item saint Gregory spekythe of them / Also that defer to do
penance / and says the sinner is to far strange from the faith and love
of god that for doing of penance abides the time of his age / For he then
has not in his power any time or hour of his life wherefore and through the
counsel of Isodore every power sinner ought diligently with all his might
whenne he may return him to god for who that does not penance. when he
may: when he would he shall not do it. Do then penance and tarry not to
the end that thou be not enclosed without heaven with the folisshe virginys.

How we ought to despise and hate the world.
SAint John^ in his first canonique shewith us that we ought not to love the
world ne the thi^gis that be in the world / And says in this manner / love ye
not the world ne thyngis that be therein / if there be any that loves the
world the charity of god is not with him. Also the concupiscence of the world
passes and vanysshith away / And saint Augustyne treatinge upon the same
words demands in this manner / O thou pore creator whice would thou chese
of thies two: would thou love / the world and the temporal things and pass
the time with them: or despise the world and live eternaly with god / if thou
love the world: it will desceyue the / for the world calls and draws
swetely to him who that loves and follows him / but in their need he fails
them / and may not supporte ne socour them and certainly the world is as one
excu^municate / for so as the excommunicate i^ the church is not prayed for so
our lord Ihu^ criste prays not for the world / the which all times prayed
for his persecutours / and them that crucified him / Alas to much is he a
fool that serves such a master and has such a lord that in the end chaseth
and kesteth out his servant naked and pore and without hyre / for so the
world does: we read of the Saulden of Babylon the which being seek in the
city of damasens of a mortal desease confessing him self of the shortn^es
of his life and of nighnes of his death piteously and in great lamentacions
called to oon of his seruantis / and said to him in this manner / Thou were
wounte to bear in my batayllis the banner and the sign of mine Arms / by
tryumphant victory / Now a noon take and bear the sign of my sorrowful death /
that is to know this pore cloth and miserable shete and cry with an high /
voice by all the City thies words / see the king of all the oriental
parties the which dyinge and fynysshynge his days bears with him noon of
all the richesses of this world but oonly this old and poor clothe or shete
/ And semblably we read of a young prince king of loreyn being in infirmity
of sekenes / considering his days were short / and his death nigh / beholdynge
his palaces houses and great edifiynges: cried in castyng many sighs and
pyteous tears. O my god my creator Ihesus / at this hour I see and may
know that the world ought well to be despised. Alas I have had in this
world many sumptuous palacis: houses / and lodges with great Riches / and now
know I not whether to goo: another any creature that will take and receive me
this night in to his house / Consider thies things poor and miserable sinner
and leave thy god and thy felicite / that is to know this diceyuable world /
before that by him: and of him / than be left in so great and miserable
pouertye / harken what Saint Iamys says / he that is friend of this world:
is Enmye of god. And saint Gregory says / so much more as the man is nyghe
the love of the world: so much farther is he fro the love of god / for the
which thing manifestly our Lord Ihesu criste at the hour of his passion
went out of the City of Iherusalem all naked to be crusifyed and suffer
death / willing to show that they ought to flee the world and his
community yeuenge ensample that he that would follow the fruit and merit of
his passion: ought to Issue out of the world at the leest by affection / in
fleing the worldly conversation / and desyringe the spiritual. And for so
much our Lord Ihesu criste spoke to Ieremye / saying / flee and goo out of
Babylon / to the end that every parsone may save his soul. By babylon as says
Saint Iero^me is understand the house of confusyon / and that house
represents the world where / In all parties reyneth confusyon as well in
the clarge as in the commune people. And in Relygyous as in seculars / and in
old: as in young / and generally as well in men as in women / in such manner
as saint John^ says veritably and with good right / All the world is evil:
and to all evil it is obedient / wherefore saint Barnard counsayllynge to flee
the world and use a religious life: says on this wise / flee out from the
mids of Babylon that is to say fro the world and save your souls: fle to
the Cite of resuge that to to the relygious life: and there ye may for the
euylles passed do penance / and get the Joy Eternal. wherefore a basshe you
not ne dread the hardenes or pain of doing penance / For the passions and
affeccions of this present world: be not worthy ne sufficient: for to perdon
the euylles and sins passed before / And therefore think of the reward that
is promised by doing penance in the house of god / which is the heavenly
realm eternal And for more ample declaracion of this matter: it is to be noted
/ that we ought to flee this fynfull and miserable world for.iiii. causes /
First thou ought to consider / that the wise wyllyngly would depart for the
conseruynge and keeping of their health: placis corrupt with pestilence / and
principally if they feel and perceive sekenes of disposicion dangerous / In
this manner is the world / for it is infecte with corrupt pestilence by
thabboundaunce of sin / And in so much as sin is right contagious sekenes:
So it is to be fled and left. And also the company of wretched sins / For it
is unsure and unwholesome to them that be hole in all their members: to follow
and use the company of them that be lepris and unclean / In like wise it can
not be thing sure to man: that will be pure and clean: to follow this synfulle
world fulfilled with all vices / To the which purpose it is said in
ecclesiastices in the.xiii. Chapitour. He that touches pitche in berynge
thereof: shall take so^me to wche of fowlnes. And he that is companyed with
proud: shall find some apparel or clothinge of pride. And to say the troth:
It is a thing Inpossible that he abide long in good works that often
frequenteth with evil parsones. And for so much says the psalmyste / with
the holy: thou shalt find the holy / and with the evil: thou shall find
the evil / and so as evil conversation is noysaunt and hurtefull: right so
is the good company good and profitable / for he that fyndethe good company:
fyndeth helthfull life and haboundaunt in riches. And for a true declaracion:
believe verayly that full seldom it is seen: butte a man becomes good or
evil: after the company / where he is enterteyned / And as says Saint Jerome
the hartis of children is as it were a clean pure table: In the which no
thing is painted / wherefore it is a true lykenes: that the works and
co^dicions that they learn in youth: be it good or evil: they will follow in
their aige / Then let us withdraw from this world: as from an evil
neighbor / For in this world is there not a worse neighbor: nor that so
much may annoy us: as the affinite and affeccion of sins / wherewith this
world is replenysshed. Secoundly the wise of their nature withdrawith and
departeh from the places where they have doubt to be trayed / sold / or
delivered to the handis of their Enmyes which the world does from day to day
/ wherefore the words of Judas that betrayed his master: is propre to that
purpose: which said he that I shall kiss take and hold him / for he is
that I should deliver you / such or resemblable words says the world to the
devil For he that the world clippeth and kysseth and lyftith up in great
honor: he betrayeth and yeueth them into the handis of their great Enmye the
devil. wherefore thou ought well to note that in this world there is no
suertie ne troth / For as says saint Jerome the most great and manifest
sign of dampnacion: is to have and follow in this corporal life the pleasures
/ the sportis: and felicities thereof and to be byloued of the world. For he
erreth and far goes out of the way of Justice. that by riches and delitis
enforsith him to please the world. Thyrdly the wise withdrawith him from that
place where he weneth there be perell / certainly so is the world a place
right perlious / which is called a See as says the psalmyst / the world is
a great see spacious / of the which as says saint Barnarde the difficulte of
passage: and the multitude of passers proves the daungier / as in the sea of
marcell if there be.iiii. ships oon scarslye can pass without perell So is
it of the Sea of this world / of.iiii. souls one among them with pain
comes to salvation. This world is like the diluuie where few folks be
saved in respect of them that perisshe. It is as the fournes of Babylon /
enbraced with the fire of hell / wherefore above all thing: man ought to dread
and flee it / For by the wind of in a little word: man is enbraced to the
fire of Ire / And for the beholding of oon woman: is enbraced with the fire of
lechery / and for the beholdynge of one precious Iuell: is enbraced with the
fire of covetous concupiscence. Fourthly we see by experince that man gladly
withdrawith and departith from him that desires him / and principally from
his Capital Enmye / And our capitalle Emnyes the deuell / prince of the
world that night and day manysseth our death / from whom withdraw us: when
we forsake the whrld / And for so much says Ecclesiastices in the.ix.
chapitour hold the always far from a man that has power to slay the by the
which man is understand the devil / that man is ouerco^me by as says saint
Mathewe in his.xiiii. chapitour such things be done by the evil man
understanding the devil our gostly Enmye. For which cause above said: we
ought to know and understand that the sovereign remedy to overcome the world
is to flee and depart therewith / And to this purpose we read in the life of
faders / yt saint Agryme being resu^dunt and dwelling i^ the palace of the
Emperor: made his Orison to god saying / lord I pray the address me in the
way of health / in the which Orison making came to him a voice: saiynge / Agrym
fle the world and the men thereof: and thou shall be saved / And a noon after
the holy man went in to a devout Religion / in the which place he prayed
semblaby as he had don before / lord address and show to me the way of health
And again a voice answered him / again fle overcome / keep silence / and rest
the / Thies be the rotes to fle sin / by the fleing: is overcome the
co^cupissence of the flesh / by keeping silence: is overcome pride / by rest
and seassinge the love and desires of the world: couetise / and auaricie is
overcome. Item Isodor she with us i^ this manner to dispraise the world if thou will live i^ rest: take away and put from the all things that may noie: or
take from the: thy good purpose / be come to the world as deed / and so ye
world to the another care for the glory of the world more then thou were deed /
dispraise i^ thy life: the things that thou may not have after thy death / of
this matter spekith saint Jerome in this wise / O life of the world: not life but
death / a life false and deceyuable / a life mixed / and meddled with disters / A
life shadowed with lies / now as a fresshe flower: and a noon dry / a life
fragile and caduke / O life miserable: to the true life contrary / that the more
he grows: the more he mynyssheth / the more he goes forth: The nygher is the
death: O life full of snares. How many haste thou in this world: of miserable
men: taken and wrapped in thy lases / how many have thou led and daily
leads: in to the tourmentis infernal. how much is he blessed that may
know thy sotelties / much more is he blessid that has no cure of the / and
disprayseth thy blandysshinges and right blyssed ought he to be called: that is
deprived from the saint Augustyne says the world cries: I shall fail the at
need and / the flesh cries. I shall fall all to corrupcion / Now advise the
miserable syn: which thou wylt follow / Alas right dear friend if chies
things beforsaide / move the not to despise and condemn the world / harken
the speaking of saint Bernard to them that loves this sorouful world /
sorrow / pain / and travail / be to them to the which is p^payred the mete
of worms / labor / flames of fire / thurst / contynuall weeping / and
gnastinge of teith. And also the horrible face and look of deuillis / And
sorrow may be said to them: yt be in that perpetual tourment: where death is
desired night and day / and never shall come / for cursed sinners in that
tourment: demands death / but / dye shall they not / for incessauntly they
shall be tourmented in everlasting horroures Now miserable sinners think ye
now: what sorrow and lamentacions shall be when the pore sinners shall be separate
and put out from the company of the just people / And when they shall be given
to the power of deuellis / and shall goo with him to eternal tourment.
Deprived and departed from the glory and felicity of paradise / in sorrow and
pain perdurably dwelling in hell / where the fendis without ceasing: shall
always travel and troument them He that thus shall be tourme^ted: shall never
dye but ever live without hope or mercy / and for more augmentacion of sorrow:
the dampened shall live without death / and dye without being consumed wherefore it
is to be noted what Isodore says / if thou have the wit of Solamo^: the
strength of Sampson: the time and long life that Enec had: the might of
tholomeus: the riches of Cresie: what might all these profit the at that
hour / when thy stynkynge infecte flesh shall be yeuen to the worms / and
thy soul to hell / with the soul of the cursed rich man: there myserably to
be tourmented without end / Item an other thing ought to move and a^monisshe
the to flee and despise the world / that is to know: the short space and time
of life / and the hour of death that to us is uncertain. wherefore says saint
Gregory / the miserable obstinate syn^ers: do purchase and desire their cursed
vice / under the shadow and hope: of long life / and the good and just:
leauith the gyltes of sin: because they know and Judge in them self. The
shortenes and little while enduringe of this present right miserable world /
whereof speaks saint Iamys i^ the.iiii. chapitour of his canonique / what
thing says he / is our life: but a vapor lightly apperinge: and a noon
adinchiled and lost / And as saint Augustyne says / How short is the life
of man from his childehode unto the decreped aige: for if Adam had lived
sithen the time god fourmed him unto this day: and now dyed: what profit
should be to him the length of his life. For what is our life but the course
to the death / which may not be let / but it behooves us always to attend
the hour: that our sovereign lord and god has lymytted / For in him only is
our hour certainly determined / to the which purpose says Senec / from
day to day we shall dye / for every day is taken from us acertayne of our
life. O my dear friend if thou weal consider and look upon thy self geuynge
head to these words before written: and perseuerantly prynte them in thine
heart: thou shall have no mind to sing any other song: in this wretched
world: but oonly this / I languysshe in myserie / and contynually goo to my
death / forgetting the time of long life in this p^sent world / For truly thou
art deceived and thou hope of long life / And thereby to possede many years the
temporal Ioes and delytis of this deceyuable world / not so my friend not so
/ for daily thou see the contrary / and as the spalmyste says man is made
semblable to vanity: which lightly passheth and consumes: as a shadow.

Of the vain Joy / might / dignite / honors / and riches of the world.
IF thou would know what is the Joy / might / dignite / honors / and riches
of the world understand and harken the pro^^phete Baruc in his third
chapitour / the which demands in this manner / where be the princes of the
people: that had seignyorie and dominacion of the bestis of therth / and that
played and disported with the birds of heaven / where be the men that gadereth
gold and silver: and affye them in their treasour / never satisfied with
getting / I wys they be all passed and deed / and descended in to hell / and
other beco^me in their placis / which now Joy and use of their goods that
they lest / And where be the grate clerks and the creatours: or where be the
great diverse in excess and superhaboundaunce of meats or they that have put
their pleasau^ce to norisshe horses / palfreys / and such other / And where be
the p^^^s / Emperors / kings / dukes / princes / Marquis / Earls / Barons /
noble Burgeis / Merchants / laborers / and folks of all estates / they be
all in powder and rottennes / and of the most great: there is no more but a
little memory upon their sepulcre / In lr^es contained / but goo see in their
sepulcres and tombs / and look and thou can well know / and truly Judge:
which is thy master: and which is the verlet / which bones be of the pore:
and wiche be of the rich / divide if thou may: the laborer from the king /
the feeble from the strong the fair / from the foul / and deformed / Now
certainly it is well to be understand that this worldely Joy: what that ever
may come of it: is to be fled / First for it is right vile of conditions.
Secou^dly / for it is right false of promise: Thirdly for it is right frail /
and vain in endurynge / Fourthly for the retribucion is right cursed / and
dampnable I say then first that the Joy of the world is to be fleed: for so
much that of his nature: it is right vile and detestable / whereof it is
written in the first of Machabeus / in the secounde chapitour / the Joy of
the world is donge / worms / and corrupcion / which this day is lift up
and set on high: and to morrow no thing shall be found / behold then among
all things / what is more detestable then donge / and among the beestes more
vile then the worm / And thou shalt say that the Joy of the world is noon
other thing: butte donge and worms / which ought to be withstand and
dispraysed of men. The Joy of the world also / is as the roten wood / of the
which the philosopher techeth / and thexperiens appreueth / for of the night:
it shyneth / and is pleasant / and on the day: it apperyth rotten / and
naught what other thing is a man full of vain glory (that in himself takes
such pleasure) but oonly a light and clernes faynte and deceyuable: which the
Ieen of the pore creaturis: that be weyke / feeble / and sekely Iugeth
byholdynge outwardly: to be the true Joy of felicite / But when the pytuous
day of Judgment shall come: In the which almighty god shall illumyne the
hid and secret thyngis that now be in derkenes: and shall beclare and open
the counsayll of hertis: then they that now seem and appear glorius: shall
then appear foul / and fulle of Rotennes / and of all people cast out and
refused / as stynkynge and abhomynable. For such folkis that has the Riches
and tuyssaunce of the world: be semblable to a back: that in the night flies
and shines: and in the day withdrawith / and hides him / and apperith alie
black Alas if thyes poor and miserable people that in their vain riches
puttyth their glory: which here after shall return into duste: with fylchynes
of their flesh: and now in this miserable world by dignite and great power
be exalted: whereby they oppress and overcome the power: whose pride shall
shortly be swaged / by cruel death then apperynge black / and rotten / world
consider thyes things before said. I can not think butte they would
condemn and have in abhominacion: the temporal glory of the world / seeing
and considering the opynion of saint Jerome / that says: it is impossible
that man in this world and in the other: shall appear glorious / For the
secounde we ought to flee and leave the glory of the world: for it is right
frail / and never assured ne conformed in stabilite But falce and defective /
as is che smoke or vapor and odor of the flower / The smoke is of that nature
that the more it proceeds in higheth: so much it mynyssheth of his puyssaunce
/ and substance / In so much that fynably in mountynge so high: it
consumes and vanisshith / The flower semblably which has great odoure: and
for a little short time in sauoure and color noble and pleasant / by a
little wind or haete of the son: it is dead / and dried and leasith both
sauoure / color and odor / So is the Joy of this world / as writes Isaye in
the.iiii. Chapitour / all things that god has created in flesh: is as the
hey / and all the glory of the flesh is as the flowers / of the same: the
hey be comes dry / and leasyth his color and flower / so is the glory of
the world vain / and infructuous / light and transitory. And so be they that
loves the world / as the hey sone dry and deed / a noon as they become out
of the earth / wherefore says ecclesiastices / all temporal myghtis / all
corporal life / is this day duringe: and on the morrow ded / and at an end /
Behold where is now the glory of king assurey: which beheld under his
seignorie and dominacion: the nombre of.xxvi. provinces / where is the glory of
king Alexaunder: that put all the earth under his subieccion / and obeysaunce:
so as it is written in the first of machabeus / where is now the glory of all
his empire or the realms: that he put under his obeysau^ce / where be the
princes: wriche had domynacion on the beestes of therth: be they not all
passed: as well the pilgrymes as the hosts of all sorts: what was their
contynuau^ce: but shortly goon and suddenly departed in the space of one day
They have in vanitye passed their days: and their years: in a short season /
and like wise in vanity they be departed and vanyshed and noon is abiding /
for it is common to all thing creat to dye / and death is of such condition:
that it beholds neither honor: ne Riches / but is so cruel that it spares
none / his course: and law by all the world is so common: and egall: that it
sparith no more the Emperor / king / or great astate: than it does the most
caytefe / or power creature / for not withstanding that the rich and mighty
is norisshed in this world with dilicious metis: folowinge his voluptuous
pleasures: by the which his soul is defouled: i^ the end he shall bear no more
with him then the most pore. Thirdly the glory of the world is to be fleed
for it is right falce and deceyuable / and holds to noon his promise / not
withstanding that it may not give any man one moment or space of time / yet
it promises man suertie of life / behold who may compare with king
Alexander / and with the glory that he had in the world he lost never
battle: but often overcome great multitude of his Enmyes: he beseged never
City but he wan it / there was no province but he subdued it / to his
domynacion yet not withstanding all his might / at the hour that he had went to
have ruled and governed all the world in peace: by a little venom he was
constrained to dye / and so depart / and leave all that worldly glory /
wherefore man do thou follow the Joy of this world that in the end may not
socoure the / of the which says Petir blesense in a pistell / the falce
deceiuable glory of the the world: abuses and deceyueth his lovers / For what
so ever he promisith for the time to come: or what so ever he pretends for
the time present: is thing of naught / soden and passable as water Rynnynge /
Fourthly the glory of the world is to be despised and fled / for it is right
cursed / and of evil retribucion / it ledeth a man to no Joy but to all pain
/ and confusion / of the which thing speaks Osey in the.iiii. chapitour /
saiynge the Joy of the world shall turn to blame / and confusion: the
puyssaunce in to debilitie / the wisdom in to folly / the love and
delectacion: in to tribulacion and pain / for by Just mesure and quantite for
the gylt / shall be in the end pain equiuolant / whereof saint Jerome spekyth
in this manner to them that loves the glory of the world: sorrow and mysery
be to you that will haste to goo to the Joy of heaven: by the way of your
Richesse / For it is a lyghter thing for a Camel to pass the hole of a
nedyll ye: then a rich man to enter to the Realm of heaven / And for more
great probacion he says / note not my words: but the words of Ihesu criste
/ that says the heaven / and the earth / shall pass and take end: but my
words shall ever be true: ferme: and stable Therefore wake and weep ye
miserable sinners / vnstablisshed with the wind of inconstaunt fortune / that
confou^deth and dispiseth other / ye be derked and blinded with goods of
vanity: and with digniteis: that ye have frauddently / and malyciously: gotten
in the world / The term of your life shall be peraue^ture this night: kytt and
broken / your soul in hell without end and without term: in the
intolerable and miserable tourmentes / for as ye have not been with the good
men continual helpyng in labor ne suffered them to live by their labor / but
of your might has diffouled and extorted them: so shall ye not only be
intourment with men: but perpetually with all the deuylles in hell / and so
much more as ye have had Joy and gladness: so much more in hell shall be
prepared your grieve and pain / and more shall I say you our savior and
redemer Ihu^ criste chase in this world xii. Appostelles / of the which there
was of noble lynage but only one / which was saint Barthelmewe / and one
rich: that was Mathewe / and all the other were pore fisshers / leuynge in
pain and travel of their body. Now since it so is: that god is just and
true: and all thingis procedinge of his mouth is pure troth: veraily I think
with great pain among all the nobles and Rich of this world oon might be
found co^uenable and worthy to helthfull election / but enough may be found:
that be propre and conuenable to the service of dampnacion. And for a little
while being / in hell they shall receive their salarie / And if by adventure:
any / derke or blinded from the true light: would have meruayll / and
question of this words: I should answer in this manner / whether we believe
that for one deadly sin a man shall be damnyed: if he dye therein / is to be
answered so it is. whereby it is to be concluded that thies thingis considered
among an hundred thousand with pain one uneath may be saved / An other
question is this what is the rich with all his delytes and pleasures / Truly
noon other thing: butte a vessellful of sin / replete with pride / lechery /
and covetous pryncipally to the rich mighty and noble: reignyth many time all
sin and malidiccions. And they ought to be called thieves / for violently they
Rob and steal from the power: their salarye / and defoulleth and puts to
death them: that they ought to sustain and norysshe / with the goodis that
almighty god has yeuen to sustain the pore / certainly the mischeuous and
miserable sinners that in their oonly richesses takes their felicite / ought
to give to the pore and in large them: with the superfluens goods that they
put in their colthynge and their array. They take it to them self: to their
Ruen and dampnable confusion / Butte alas they se the pore me^bres of Ihesu
criste naked / and dispurueyd: dyeng for hungre / and thirst: and therefore
they forse not / but always put their Tresoure from the poor / that is to
wit: the superfluyte and superaboundaunce of their Richesses in sumptuous
edyfienge of great palacis / that may be pleasure to the sight of mortal men
/ to behold: prepayringe great diverse: the Rich: to the rich: furnisshynge
their disshes full of dyuersse meatis / and fyllyng their belleis: and their
caren bodies: with the delytis of the world / having no pytye / mercy / nor
compassion: of the pore that they see dye for hungre. O miserable creature what
other thyngis is it then sin: such a dampnable life consider then / that
as soon as the belly is filled with haboundaunce of meatis: the falce dampnable
lechery is present / at the yate / to draw the to eternal death / what
woldes thou that I said more of such folkis / that in the honor and riches
of this world: thus passes thyer days / Certainly all the tunges of mortalle
men: cane not say nor determyn the enorme euylles / and sins they commytte
For they be think them not of god: ne of the death / but if it be by adventure
/ in their sleep: slepynge / or dremynge. Suerly he lyghtely falls in sin:
that thynkyth not him self mortal / and knowyth not god to be his Judge / Too
much an ignoraunte fool is he: that of thyes things have no mind / and
flees not this light temptacions / setting naught by them / and for to
say the truth I believe that if they had perfight knowlogyng of god their
creatoure: and knew them self to be mortalle: they should not so offend god
by sin: at the least so boldly and so grievously. Alas what does such
sinners in the church / and in placis of devotion: certainly they goo full
synfully to see and behold the beautye of women / whenne they ought to think
of god and salvation of their soul. Their thoughtis is how they may saylle
upon the Sea / for to gedder and assemble tresours and worldly riches for
them: and for their children / thinking also how they may apparel and
clothe their bodies: with precious clothinge to the world most plesaunt / and
how they may make diverse plays and turmentes / with such other disportis /
and dilicate meatis / to get and purchase the favor of women: to accomplisshe
the concupuscence of their cursed flesshely desires / O pore miserable and
cursed sinners: ye be to ignoraunte / what do ye / Alas ye distroye your
bodies / before the time of your days / and put your souls to mortal death.
whereof think ye comes so many soden sekenes: but of to much great
haboundaunce and excess of meatis and drinkis / with che cursed detestable
frequentacion of women / ye think to play you with god / and abuse your self
/ ye for get that the soul should obey to the body / and in so doing ye
distroye soul and body / before the time / And for a little short time of
Joyous and songis here / it behooves you after / to langour in eternal
tourment / and weeping without end / drink ye / eat ye / clothe you with
diverse habitis / in the often chau^gynge of them / to the end that your
noblenes be raised: and that no mortal man in honor excede you: and in hell
shame and confusion ye shall receive / where shall be then your great diverse
of dilicate and precious meatis / the wines of aromotike and confectid with
diverse spicis / eat now and ye shall be dronken: for after your death ye may
no more do so / but ye shall be in hell with the cursed Rich that so daily
lived in this delites / And then axed but oon drope of water for to quench his
heat and might not have it / do evil works and so we the seeds of good
works in corrupcion: and in sorrow and cursydnes ye shall gader your seed at
the day of judgment when it shall be said to you cursed sinners to the eternal
fire of dampnacio^ / which is to the devil and to his folkis made ready / Alas
heart more hard then is the stone: would thou abide that day so terryble and
so horrible: in the which thou shall not only yield acco^mpte of thy lecherous
clothinges: dronkenes: and of evil spent time: how thou haste lived but with
that: it shall behoue the to yield acco^mpte of every vain word / O miserable
syn^er why doste thou not amend the / wherefore tariest thou from day to day
to turn the to god / why doste thou not repent thyn evil dedis / thy death
is nygh / that day and night is abought to overthrow the. The devil is as
nighe to take and receive the / Thy riches shall fail the at need / the worms
habideth thy flesh / that thou so derely has norisshed / for to devour and
gnawe it unto the time that / after the day of Judgment it be conjoined to the
soul: that they may suffer to gather eternal pain O abused creature thou
sechest and hops to find by the vanites of this world Joy / disporte / and
infinite riches / and they be noon / but and thou wylt find Joy: and perpetual
filicite: labor diligently to seche the blessed realm of heaven / for there
thou shall find infynite Joy. The which never Iye saw / or ear ever hard /
nor heart of man can co^prehe^de or think / the Joy p^pared for the lovers of
almighty god. Now leave then thies vain things / that in so short space be
gone / to the end: that thou may have in possession the goodis and felicite of
the Joy eternal. Alas what shall be of them that neither for the love of god:
the dread of death: ne the tourmentis of hell: woll leave their sins / But be
sorrowful and displeasaunte: whenne they may not have their cursed pleasures
at their will and desire / which is so great displeasure to god. O ye
wretched folkis: sorrow upon sorrow shall be to you / that laugh and rejoice you
so in this sorowefull world / for after in anguisshe and sorrowful weeping: ye
shall have eternal sorrow / Rest yet a little and imploye your days / fill
the measour of your myseries and malices / so that the i^dignacion of god:
shall come upon you / be fervent in this little time: in using your outrageous
plays dau^ces / dronke^nes / letting the time vainly pass asse^bling to your
childer honors / Richesses mightes and powers / augme^tyng your noblenes and
renown: to the end that your children may follow your life: and with you
perpetually be dampened / But perauenture so^me may say that god is benign
and merciful / and ready to receive all sinners / that to him would turn / I
confess it to be true / and not only benign: but more benign: then any may
think / and perdoneth al the^ that truly tourneth to him / Alas is not god
right benign: that endures so many Injuries: and suffers and yeueth space
and time / to the sinners to amend and correct them self / but of one thing
I will assure the / in that god is pyteous and merciful: in sufferinge of the
sinner: as much is he just in punisshynge the evil and iniquities / yet
again it may be said that a man which has by long space of time lived and
in his days has done no good dead: and if any he have done: it has been
very little / Albe it in tharticle of death he shall take penance / and shall
opteyne pardone of his misdeeds / O folysshe and vain cogitacion of man:
cursed and dampnable hope: that so would habide to convert him to god / at
that dangerous need / for among an hundred thousand men / that ledeth such
cursed life: it shall be hard to find one that at that time: can seche to god
for mercy or pardone / O lord what gift / what grace: what mercy may man axe
of god: ingendered and norisshed in sin: and never lived after the laws of
god / ne never knew ne would here speak of him / ne yt ever would knowleige his
own sin / ne what it is to do penance / but if he knew it in slepynge /
what grace might that man ask of god so knytte and drowned in seculare
business / the which incessauntly thinks what pain it is to leave and for
sake his children / on the one part: whom sekenes constreyneth and oppressith
on the other part: the riches and temporal goods that he beholds and must
leave to the world: what sorrow what heaviness may toche that heart: when he
sees that of all goods te^porall he is perpetually deprived / and they may
not socour him at need / vain and little aualour shall be to him then: taking
of penance / for if he hoped of health he would not ask pardon / and to make a
breue conclusion: he that in his youth did not shame to offend god: in the end
he shall not deserve to have indulgence of god / what penance may it be to man
that takes it when he sees to have no modayes in this world / And if he
should perchauns be worse then he was before / And in effect: when he knowith
the days and time of his life at an end: then will he ask mercy of god to do
penance And after the retourning to health of body: he should be worse of
living / for truly as says saint Jerome / I hold and afferme and by many
experientis it is to be known: that them whose life in this world has always
ben evil: can not be a good end / which fearid not to sin: but always leuyd
after the concupiscence and pleasure of this world For the which / right dear
friend consider in thy heart these things beforesayd / condemn and disprayse
the world with the vain Joy / and deceyuable reioyses / for thonoure of him:
that is above all things / Alas what profit may be to man the wynnyng of all
the world: and after to suffer perdicio^ and distruccion of his soul Remember
the that thou art man and that thonour of the world is the very lettynge of
grace and that worse is: it is the loss of eternal health where have we read
of any: putting their delites in the world here: that has entered the
everlasting Joy / O how falce and vain is the Joy of this world which me^
so greatly desires / and they never seche for the great Joy of heaven: that
co^myth only of god / if man would be p^ferred above other and have over them
domynacion and seignore: Is not he like to lucifer that said: I shall put my
seat in the north and I shall be like to him that is most high / then look
thou proud man to him that would have had that high astate: which for his
pride was cast into eternal Ruin Therefore says saint Augustine / he is well
blessid and happy: that puttith his only desire i^ the heavenly Joy And
reioyseth not him self in prosperity of this world / another in adversity is
shamed or abashed / he yt thynkith that no thing i^ this world is to be loved:
fearith little to lose and for sake the gods and prospereriteis of this world
for gods sake. The Joy of this world is noon other but as a blaste of wind:
passing by the earis of man / weerfore miserable sinner be hold how thou art
blinded if thou desire this worldly Joy / For as says saint Anselme / thou
maiste not be in worldly honor without pain and labor / Thou maiste not be
in prelacie: without inuye and trouble / nor in honor and high dignite:
without vain glory / and therefore if thou wylt withstand the danger and
parell to the which thou Ru^nyst: in desiryng te^porall honor and Joy of the
world: without doubt it is necessary to the: to leave flee and renounce the
miserable vanities of the same.

How men ought always to attend and dread death
Remember the often yt deeth follows the and tarieth not / for it is written i^
Eccleciastices yt much is it profitable to the health of man for to have often
meditaco^n and mind of death / which is declared i^ diverse places of holy
scripturis / whereof the said Eccleciastices says to the same purpose /
Remember and record the last things that is to say death / the Ioys of
paradyse / and the pain of hell: and thou shall never committee sin to thy
dampnacion / And to this puropse says saint Barnarde / the most sovereign
felicite: is contynually to think of death / for that man that berythe with him
the remorse of conscience: and the often thinking of deeth: shall never do
sin to be dampened fore / and Saint Augustyne confermynge the same: says /
that there is no thing that so much reuoketh sin fro man: as often to
think that he must needs dye / for it makith man to meke him / and despise
all vain things / and ready to accept penance / For as says saint Jerome
/ he lightly dyspisyth all thingis: that thinks always to dye / For he
despisith first the concupiscence of his Ien: that considerith how suddenly he
must leave all thyngis in this world: to the world / and the concupiscence of
the flesh is despised: when he considerith that his body in one instante:
shall be worms meat / Pride is despised: when he considerith in his heart:
that he that will in this world be above other: in a little while after:
shall be put under the feet of all other / I would that princis and kings would
understand and consider: how piteously it shall be houe them to leave their
Richesses / and the glory of this world to be borne and lodged: in an old
foul and strayte sepulcre low in the earth / to leave also their shynynge and
beautiful palacis: for to enter in to a sepulcre horrible / and derke / full of
stynke and corrupcion / void of all Joy / and riches / and full of misery /
having neither children ne loving seruauntis / O where then shall be the
pomp and pride the time passed with the multitude of seruauntis / that followed
them / or their rich shynynge clothynges / Certainly he that has had this
worldly Joy and folewed in filicite this day: to morrow may be in his sepulcre
/ sorously gnawen and eten of worms / whereof spekith pope Innocent in this
manner / my brethren understand and behold ye see aman not long a goo
living in his house: noble / rich and mighty and suddenly pore and naked from
all goodis in his sepulcre / He that so much has had tryumphe and honor
in his hall and palace: lies now disformed under a tomb / He that was
accustomed with delicious meatis and drinks in his perlour: is now eaten and
consumed with worms in his sepulcre / And like to this purpose writes peter
damyan / spekyng of the memory of death in a pistole that he sent to a
Countess / O almighty god how meruellous is it to remember and think on the
bitter sorrow and dread that the pore sinful soul susteyneth and suffers /
when it sees and knowith that the world shall fail and that the flesh
shall be departed from it / How sharp and bytynge prikkynges: shall then
tourment the soul / whenne it remembrith the sins that it has committed in
this world / brekynge the co^maundementis of god: and by necligence has
left taccomplysshe them / It plaineth and wepeth the time taken in vain /
which was granted and yeuen to him to do penance / dredynge the strayghte
vengeance of Judgment vnreuocable that he sees apere / It is constreyned to
leave the body / then would he make amendis for the faultis of the time
passed but it shall not be hard / It beholds bakwarde the time of mortal
life passed and gone: it seems him but a little way / a soden course / and a
light passage. Then he wepeth for that he has lost in so little and short
time: the love of all sayntis / and for so little transitory Joy: has lost
the sweet Joy and glory perpetual / and has shame that he has obeyed to
that carien body: which is the meat of worms / which soul should have been
presented in the company of aungelles / when he co^sydereth at that hour the
Riches of mortal men by the which they be put to perdicion: he wepith and in
him self is utterly confounded / for the loss of the sovereign clerenes in
heaven / he knowith That which he loved in this world: is but derkenes / At
that hour and that sorrowful contemplacion: the Iyen begin to marvel and
for fear turn in the head. The breast begins to tremble and to beat. The
throat is horose / and the breath short. The tethe beco^me black. The lyppis
and the mouth: dedly and pale and all the members be shronke to gedder / And
the veins of the heart: brekyth / for forowe / And the forsayde signs shall be
neghbours doing seruise to death. There shall be present the horrible and evil
sins / The false thoughtis and unlawful desires / The ydell words that
has be spoken: shall not be absent / but ready to bear bitter witness
against the doer of them / there shall all thingis be made open and known /
where no creature shall flee: but straightly give attendau^ce / The horrible
and fearful company of deuylles: shall there be present. And also the
blessed company of aungelles to thentente that every creature shall be rewarded
according to their demearitis / For if the soul be found without sin: the
holy company of aungelles shall represente it before god / with great melody
and sweet song / never to depart from glory. And on the contrary part: if
it be found in sin: the blakenes and fearefulnes of deuellis: anon with
intolerable fear: shall strike and smyght the cely soul / with so great
violence: that it shall be thrown down / and compelled to deperte out: from
the body of miserable flesh / Then goth the soul about to every membre of
the body / first to the lippis: To whom the lippis does say / O soul what will thou do / It answerith saiynge / I must deperte and go out of this body / The
lippis geuyth answer saiynge / thou came not in to the body by us: nor by us
shall go out / Then the cely soul goth to the ears and to the nose thirlis:
and they make answer to it in like wise / Afterward it gooth to the Ien By
whom it entered in to the body: and up to the crown of the head. And
lokynge about hither and theder: it takith great thought / if it be dampened /
saiynge: unto it self / O I cursed soul of the exco^icate / thief / ad
adulterer / fornicator / periurer / extorcioner / And anon it lokith oboute
and seith the vesture which it had at the founte of baptism / whight and
undefiled: and now blacker then pytche: with a great voice it cries and
wepith saiynge Alas alas who has changed my vesture / which was so fair and
precious whiter then snow clerer then cristall / At this sorrowful clamor
apperith unto him the deuell that to this: has guyded and gouernyd him
saiynge in this manner. O my soul and my lover marvel the not / For it am I
that has made ready to the this clothinge / take conforte to the / for thou
art not a lone: but accompanied with the most part of the world. Then says
the soroufull soul: what art thou that spekyth to me / The deuell shall
answer I have told the I am he that has made ready this clothing to the / I
have showed my life to the in the world. Thou haste obeyed and believed me in
all thyngis and with me labored / Thou haste done and acco^plisshed all my
cou^saylles: And therefore thou shall come and abide with me in the realm
where is and shall be ever lasting sorrow without Joy hungre without meat /
thurst without drink derkenes without light / putrifaccion and stynke without
any good odor or smell / sorrow without comfort / waylynge without remedy /
wepinge without end / noyes and piteous clamacions without silence / howling
without Joy or rest / brynnynge fire without any quensshyng / wind without
tranquilite / cold without a temperaunce or mean / heat without end / and
all evil without hope of good / And therefore my friend rise thou and come
with me / se here the Angels of hell that comes to mete the: and shall sing
right bitter songis of sorrow and heaviness / And then on the other part
shall appear the good Angel / to whom he was committed by god. And he shall
say in this manner blesshed and happy be they in this world that flees and
withstandeth this right foul and cursed clothinge or garment / O cursed soul
of the devil / O unhappy creatur / that of almighti god is cursed I in this
world have dwelled with the and thou have not seen me I have taught the / and
thou woldeste not understand me / I have yeuen the counsayll: and thou would
not here me. And therefore go in to the hands of the deuilles / in to the place
of perpetual tourmente which is prepayred and made ready: for the / for thy
cursed works: thou art now condemned / Alas who may think or deuyse the
bitter company of deuylles / waytinge with sorrow: risynge on every part: and
beringe darts and speres of hell / by the which: the poor cursed soul is
taken and led with great sorrow / to tourme^tis / saying to him / O sorouful
caytif how proud have thou ben till now: how viciously haste thou lived with
how rich and precious habitis haste thou been in the world: now say unto us
/ wherefore eatest not thou now thy dilicious meats / why art thou not cloched
with rich clothing / wherefore haste thou not now care and thought of thy
Riches / wherefore comfortis thou not the with thy wife / children / and
frendis: wherefore spekeste not with them / And after these words the
soroufull soul with wepinge and lame^tacions: cursyth the body saiynge in this
manner / O temple of the devil Thy cursed works and operacion has polluted and
filed me / O cursed earth: O habitacion of sathanas: Rise up and come with me /
to the end that thou may see the place of tourmentis: that by the to me is
made ready in the which I shall be without rest tylle the day of Judgment /
and after that day: thou shalt be with me in eternal dampnacion / Cursed be
thine Iyen that would not see the light of troth / And the way of Justice of
god Cursed be thyn ears that would not here the words of eternal life /
Cursed be thy nose thirles that would not receive the odor of holy virtues /
Cursed be thy lyppes and thy tongue: that would not taste the Joy and eternal
glory / that would not open the door of praysynge: to thonour and exaltacion
of their creator / Cursed be thine handis for by them: almos has not been
yeuen and presented to the poor / Cursed be the inward partis of thy heart:
which has in this world yeuen and brought forth many false and evil
counsaylles / Cursed be thy feet: that of the church of god / has not
vysited the paths and steps: Cursed be all thy members: which never desired
celestyall Joys / Cursed be thy works: which has taken / chosen / and
excepted: the everlasting tourme^tis / Behold my dear friend: of how great
parell thou myghtest deliver the: and how great fear thou myghtest flee: if
in this world: thou be fearful and thinking of death. Study to life so in
this world: that at the hour of death: thou may have more cause to rejoice
then to dread / of fear / learn now to dye in this world: and disprayse
all worldely things / to the end that thou may haste the: with Ihesu Criste
unto Joy / Chastes thy body with penance in this world: to the end that after
thy death: thou may have sure and parfite hope of eternal life. Oo how
happy is he and wise: that takythe thought and inforseth him self to live so
in this life: he that wylleth and desires so to be found after his death.
Alas work thou and purchase with all thy might and power / thy health: during
the time that thou haste space / for thou kowest not whenne thou shalt dye /
nor what thou shlate find after / have no hope ne trust to thy friends nor
kyndesmen / For certainly they will sooner forgette the: then thou thynkeste
/ if thou have not now cure and remembrance of thy self. who will have it
for the after thy death / Alas it is much better in this world to provide
hastily for thy necessytiees in doing so^me good for thy self: then to have
hope and abyd of the help or aid of other as long as thou haste space:
assemble and gather to gether immortal Riches: by largely yeuynge of almos /
purches and get unto the in this world: hominable friends / that is to say:
the saintis of paradyse / to the end that by thy good and meritoriouse workis:
they may receive the to the Joys celestyall / for as saint Gregorye says /
we ought daily with weeping tears remember and have in mind / how the prince
of this world at the hour of our departing will demand or ask of us
the acco^mptis of all our works / Saint Barnarde says / O my soul what
manner of fear and dread shall it be: when it shall be houe the to leave all
manner of thingis / of the which the presence was to the right Ioyus / and the
sight right agreeable / and all alone left: shall thou goo and enter in to a
region unknown / and thou shall see come against the: monsters hugly / and
abhomynable with horns / who is he that shall come to socoure the at that
day / of great necessity / who shall keep the from Ramping lions:
prepaired fode and meat Then may no body give to the comfort ne consolacion
/ But other wise it shall be of true and just souls / for the holy aungelles
shall come against them: the which shall constayne and put a back the
deuyllis: so that they shall not let ne trouble the holy souls. And the
same: unto heaven with Joy and melodye shall bear / Saint Barnarde spekyng of
the sinful soul: says / in this manner. That at the out gate or issuynge of
the body. It has dread: fear: shame: and confucion / to the regard of the
great Joy of god / whereof is written in the spalmes that the death of sinners:
is right evil / it is evil in the leasing of the world / It is worse: at
the departing of seperacion of the soul and the body / And very grievous for
the bytinge of the stynkynge vermyn / And for the great heat and brinnynge of
everlasting fire / And worste of all: is the loss and the seperacyon of the
sight of god / For which things right dear friend consider that death can not
fail nor be put back / the hour can not be known / And the time of god
ordained: can not be meaued / And therefore certainly: when the assured life is
accept in devotion: the death of the right wysman is good / For.iii things /
First it is good for rest. It is better by renewynge: and best for the
suernes and Stedfastnes thereof

Of the Joys of paradyse / and pains of hell.


IT is written by saint Paul in a pistole that he sent to the correnthioes in
the.v. Chapitoure that the Iye of man has not seen: not the ear hard: or
heart can think: the Joys that our lord god has and prepayred to his
friends and lovers O pore wretched and sinful soul give head diligently: what
Joys / how great Joys / and how many they be: which be prepared in heaven:
to the lovers of god / to the^tent that all things in this world: may be to
the: vile / and adiecte / for certainly it is to be known / that the Joys of
heaven be so great and many in number: that all arsmetricious by their numbres:
can not number ne mesure them / nor all the gramarions and ritoriciens with
all their fair spechis: can or may declare them / For as it is said before:
neither Ie may see them: nor Ear here: another the heart of man may
comprehend them / For certainly in the glory eternal: all the saints shall
Joy them in the vision of god / Above them: they shall Joy the beauty of
heaven / and of other spiritual creatures / they shall Joy within them: of the
glorificacion of the body / and nigh unto the^: the associacion and company of
aungelles and men / A worthy doctor named anselme puts and declares.vii.
yestes of the soul / that the just people shall have in the celestial
beatitude / First he puts the yestes of the body / as beauty lyghtnes /
strengeth / liberty / and health / Of the beauty of Just people: says this
doctor: it shall be seven times more shynynge then the son is now / the which
witnessith the scripture saiynge thus / the virtuous persons shall shine: as
the son: in the Realm of their fader swetnes shall so accompany just
lyuers: that it shall make them semblable or like: to the aungelles of heaven /
which from heaven unto the earth: and from therth unto heaven: transporte them
self lyghter and sodenlyer: then the mouynge of a finger / Of the which
swetnes is made a familiar example by the beamys of the son / the which
rysyng in the Est: attaineth and touchest the farthest part of the west / that
by the said example: we may have true hope and trust: not to be In possible
that is spoken: of our swestnes to come / wherefore they that shall accompany
them self with the Cytezens of the sovereign city: shall excede and pass
all other: in virtue and strength / as in moouynge / in tournynge or / in any
other act doing / and in all thexcercisynge of their workis shall not suffer
ne endure no more labor or travel: then we suffer in the mouyng of our Ien
/ And therefore I pray and require the / that no thing excede thy soul /
which has taken the similitude of the aungelles Given of almighty god unto it
/ wherrfor it must needs follow: that like wise as we may receive the power and
similitude of aungelles: so we may have the suertie and liberty of the^ / for
certainly like as unto an^gelles may be no lettyng nor gaynsayng in this world:
but at their own will: In like wise shall there be noon obstacle nor let to
hinder us / nor wall ne clausure: to keep us out / nor yet Element: which unto
our will: may withstand or annoye / and as to speak of thelth: what thing can
there be better to just people: then health and rest / what sykenes may anoaye
them that shall be.ix. the port of true health / and in effect we ought to
believe vndoubtably: to hold and afferme thelth of the life to come: to be so
noble / in corruptible / and i^mouable: that it fylleth man with an Insuperable
swetnes of health / which swetnes can not be rehearsed / So that all hurtes:
suspecious / and contrarieties: be there consumed / Item in the life to come
there is a desire of delites: that fylleth and replenissheth the good people:
with such an Inestimable swetenes: that it is felt in every perte of the body
/ that is to say in the Iyen / Ears / mouth / hands / fete / and heart /
with all the parts of the body and all the members by order each one singulerly
/ and also al in one: shall be fulfilled with that sweet dileccio^ inestimable /
In such manner: that every oon with the provision and glory eternal: shall be
fulfilled / wherefore he is right ignorante of his health: that will set his
thought his heart: and his affeccion: to the pleasures of this world / which
is vile and faylyng / Furthermore they that shall be in the Joy eternal: shall
live perdurably / not oonly the life: as wordely creatures desire here: but
they shall have such life: as is / written: that is to know: the rightwyse
true people of god shall dwell with him and with saints in paradyse eternally
/ many other things be and ought to be adjoined to the soul: which god has
created so nobly / that is to know: amittie / sapiens / concord / might
honor assurance / and Joy / And as to the first: Sapience shall be such in
the life to come: that the souls shall know all things: what they will / by
the gift of almighty god / which knowith all thingis present: passed: and to
come / For i^ that Joy sigulerly eueryche knowith other And then no thing may
be counseled or hid: of what people: of what country: or what kynrede place
or works: they have been: or excercised in their life / in such manner: that by
love: the divine puisau^ce and faruent dileccion: shall make them perfyte / in
true and steadfast love / as vnied and co^muned in one oonly body / of the
which our lord Ihu^ criste is chief and head / which is the true peace and
perfyte love / for all shall love to gether / the oon the other / as the
members of their propre bodies / For thou shall love other as thy self: and
other shall love the as their self / and thou shall be habou^daunt with all
dileccion: as thy true and pure possession / And therefore behold and remember
him that all thies things shall give unto the / And so by a swetnes unable to
be spoken: thou shall love him more then thy self / So shall there be among
them that be saved seen such co^corde: that thou shall not feel or perceive
any thing contrary to thy will / we shall be also one only body / and one oonly
soul: weded to our lord Ihu^ criste / and more discord shall there not be
among us: or discencion: then now is in the members of one body / and as thou
see and know the moving of thine Iyen: of what perte the oon turns the
other anon after follows: so shall it be of the / for where thy will shall be:
thou shall be suddenly / And yet that more great is to recyte: the will of god
shall not be contrary / nor diverse to thy will / but so as thou would he
shall will: and his will shall be fermely thine / for the head never contrayes to
the members Consider then whenne thou shalt have god concorded and vnied at
thy will: thou may nothing desire: but at thy will it shall be done / For
thou shall have the will of almghty god: according in all thingis to the /
Now then sith thou may have so much in thy possession: thou oughteste well
to be content and to esteem in thy self: that that thou then shall be in
assurance of life perpetual / which shall never part from the / and be
discharged from all diversities / for noon enmy may perse this inestimable Joy
/ nor shall atteyne: for the multitude of them that there be possessed / which
be thousand thousands / and innumerable thousands that has fruicion and
Joy: with one hole blessedness / in such condition: that eueryche of them
takyth delectacion as much in the weal of other As in them self. And
furthermore / they enjoy them in the vision of god / the which above them
self they shall love / For the which thing it is to be considered / that
sith it is so that the blessed shall be fulfilled with such filicite and Joy:
the poor miserable dampened sinners: shall be on the contrary part / tourmented
with innumerable pains / For so as mercy / strength / beautye / lyghtnes /
fredome of will / shall be to the right wise people. So by the contrary: shall be
to the sinners / stynkynge dread / langoure / sorrow / and tourmentis / with
all manner of pains / for the perpetual Joy that the rightwyse shall have /
shallbe to the sinners intermynable pain and tourmente. And for to speak of
the sapience of the rightwyse / It is to be understand / that their knowledge:
shall be to their augmentacion of Joy / honor / and exultacion. And to the
sinners: their knowledge shall be: werynges / confusion / diminission / and
lamentacion / And of the amity with the which the rightwyse be to geder
bound: if any portion of Amity be in the dampened. It shall be to the
Augmentacion of their tourmente / For as much more as oon has loved an other
in unlawful love: The more shall be their sorrow / tourmente / and pain / for
they shall have discord with all cretures / and all shall discord with them
/ For all difourmitie and calamity: shall follow them / and shall be yeuen to
them such malediction: that the thing which they desire they shall not have:
and all that they would not have: they shall have / And so in stead of good
thy shall obtain perpetual shame / and inestimable dyspisinge / by the which
they shall be withouten end: closed and depryued from all Joy / and filicite /
And as the friends of god their sovereign creator: shall be fermely assured:
never to lose the goodis and glory eternal: So the miserable and dampened
senners / shall ever be in desperacion / for so much: as they shall know ever
to deperte from the pain sorrow and tourment perdurable / and so as the good
shall be reco^pensed with Joy: the evil shall have for their heritage: sorrow
inestimable / like as says the good doctor anselme / all they that by
concupiscens of the flesh passes their days in this world: have with them
in company all the deuilles of hell / And saint Augustine says to this purpose
/ god shall make glad / comfort / and enjoy: all the felingis and wits of
the blessed people / by a spiritual dilectacion / For he is thobiect of all
wites / our lord shall also be a glass unto their sight / an harp of swetnes
to their hering / hunny to their tastinge / Bawme to their smellyng / and a
flower to their touching / And for so much god was made man: to the end that
man should holy be blessed in him: so that thinwarde vnderstanstynge be in the
contemplacion of his humanity / and breuely to speak after the saiynge of
saint Augustyne and saint Gregory / in the glory of heaven there is so great
beauty with Justice / so much Joy with eternal light: that if it were
laufull and possible to abide and live there but oonly the space of one day.
For that: the innumerable days of this life full of worldly pleasures and
abundance of temperall goods: ought of very right: to be despised / For it
was not spoken of a little and untrue effect of david: saiynge on this wise /
Oon day to abide in thy dwelling place good lord: is much better then a
thousa^de in this miserable life / whereof speaks Saint Barnarde who in this
life may think or conceive in his mind: how great felicite and pleasure
the blessed saints have in heaven / First to se almighty god to live with
almighty god / to be with almighty god / which does operacion in all things /
and is above all things / to have god: which is all good / And where so ever
is all goodness: there is most Joy and mirth / there is also verey liberty /
perfect charity / and everlasting felawship and suertie to the same agreith
saint Augustine: saying in this manner / O Joy above all Joys: to see god:
which made man / which saved man / which glorified man / and endued him:
with the vision of his most holy face / which is the most high goodness / the
Joy of Angels and of all saints / Saint Gregorye askith this question / is
not god of so inestimable fayrenes: that the Angels which be seven times
brighter then the son does desire to look upon his most holy face: and to
him minister besily in great company / Also saint Augusten of the Joys of
heaven spekith on this manner In heaven is no manner of malice / there is no manner
of mysery of the flesh / there is another will: another power to syn^e or do a
mysse / but all Joy and gladness / all creatures saved: shall have in
possession those same Joys felawshipped with aungelles / O pore soul now
thou haste hard how great the Joys of rightwyse people / how great gladness
/ how great clerenes / and how great mirth: is the heavenly City / O blessed
mirth / O how merry felicitye is it: to see the saints / and to have god
euerlastyngly if we should daily suffer pain and tourmentrye though it were as
great as the pains of hell: so that it might have an end / to thentent that
at the last we might see almghty god in his glory / and to be fellawshipped
with his sayntis: were it not worthy and proffitable that we should suffer them
And in conclusion to be part takers of everlasting Joys truly / wherefore
good soul let us desire of almghty god that grace: to flee from the company
of them that desires inordinat pleasures / of worldly things. And so utterly
putting away the grugeynges of unlawful thoughts: from the secret place
of our hearts: and desyringe inwardely the love of the heavenly company: we may
turn unto the celestial City / whereof we be written and decreed to the
Cytezens / and part takers / like unto saintis: and the householde seruauntis
of god / and and right inheritours of criste / and after this present life to
come and be with him in eruerlastyng Joy / peradventure some will ask this
question how this might be done: and by what manner of means / To this it is
answered on this / wise / Every thing to be done is in the free will of him
that shall do it / So it is in our free will: whether we will desire to have
the kingdom of heaven or not / if thou will ask what is the price of the
kingdom of heaven truly noon other but thy self / give thy self to it by good
warkes in this world and without doubt thou shalt have it / Criste gave him
self to suffer passion to thentent that thou should be part taker of the
kingdom of heaven / give thy self to him and thou shall have his kingdom. And
i^ any wise let no sin abide in thy mortal body / O wretched and sinful
soul / if thyes excellent Joys wherein the saints and chosen people of god
shall Joy euerlastyngly in the kingdom of heaven can not move and styre the
by penance and virtuous doingys too comme by the grace of god to the said
kingdom of heaven: I will advise the fear: quake / and consider with great
dread: the miserable conditions and penalities of hell / the city of the
devil / that by the fear and dread of them: thou may rise again from sin and
be turned unto thy lord god with all thy heart / Of the which pains it is
to be known: that like as the souls that be dampened has diversity of
sins: so like wise: is to them diversity of pains / whereof speaks saint
Gregory on this wise / Oon fire of hell is to be believed / but it bre^neth not
al sinners in like manner / For eueryche one of them according to the greuousnes
of their sins: shall suffer condign pain / as by oon fire: chafe is brent
/ wood is brent / and Iron is brent: but not by oon manner / The fire of hell
is so flamed in and kyndeled by the Ire and wrath of the everlasting Judge: that
it shall never be que^shed / butte dure everlasting / whereof it is spoken of
Iobe the.xxi. chapitour / the fire of hell shall devour them that be dampened /
which shall never be quenched. Of the sharpenes of the fire of hell spekyth
Saint Sebastiane / to whom an Angel appeared saiynge on this manner / this
material fire which we see and use Daily: is no more unto the fire of hell:
then is the fire painted upon a wall like unto the said sensible and usual
fire / And Isodore says / that in hell shall be a cretayne vision of a derke
and obscure light: by the which they that be dampened: may se in what manner of
wise: they suffer pain / but no thing by the which: they may Joy / And
the dampened spretes shall see there in pain with them: those people which
they loved i^ordinatly i^ this world to thetent that like wise as they had
worldely pleasure in ordinatly to gether: so they shall suffer pain
everlasting in hell / here may a question be asked whether that the dampened
sprites may se the glory of saints / to the which answers saint Gregorye:
In an omelie of the rich man that set all his felicite and pleasure in
eating and drinking And inordinate apparel / saiynge on this wise / It is to
be believed that before the reward of thextreme Judgment of god: the
vnrightwyse people do see the rightwyse people in rest and quietenes / and /
seeing them in Joy: they be not oonly crucified by their own pain: but also
they be crucified by the sight of them in Joy / The rightwyse people and they
that be saved seth always the vnrightwyse and dampened souls / to thente^t that
their Joy may increase / For why: they behold the intolerable pain which
by the great grace and mercy of god: they have avoided and escaped. And for so
much they give more thankinges unto their creator and maker: In how much
theyse yt pain i^ other: which they should have suffered: if they had done as
they did: and made no sutisfaccion before they departed this miserable world
/ And as the same saint Gregory says i^ an other place. The open pain of
them that be repreued of god does not frustrate another hurt the bless of
them that be saved / For why: there shall be no compassion of misery / and the
Joy of those blessed souls may in no wise be made less / And all though:
those blessed souls be merciful of their nature: nevertheless they be so
Joined to gether in so great rightwysnes: that in no wise they may be moved
to be dampened souls with any compassyon or pytye / And more over it is added:
that then the misery of their childer / of their fader and mother / and of their
wives: shall not make the blessed souls to be sorye / the dampened spretys
before the day of Judgment shall see the blessed creatures / not in that
manner wise to know their Joy what it is: but only they shall know them to
be in a Joy unable to be told / And by that sight: they shall sore be
crucified / greatly Inuyinge: the great felecitie of blessed souls / by the
sight of the godhede / of the which sight: the dampened spretis shall be deprived
/ and their pain shall be in no wise minisshed but in created / because they
shall have in mind the Joy of the blessed creatures which Joy they did see
in the Judgment or before the Judgment / and that shall be to them great
tourmentry and pain / And moreover they shall be scorged: in that they shall see
them self: to be reputed and taken as unworthy: to see to Joy which the
holy saints does see contynually / A question may be asked whether the
dampened souls may se and know what is done in this would / to this Saint
Gregory treatinge upon this text of Iobe the.ix. chapitour. They do
understand whether their children be noble / or unnoble: say the oon this
manner / they that be alive in this world know not where the souls be of
them that be dead / so like wise: they that be dead know not the
disposicion of them: which be left on therth For the life of the soul is
far from the life of the flesh / Nevertheless it is to be known: that
they which have the inward knoleyge of the clerenesse of god: may in no
wise be ignorante of outward effectis or dedis / And for this cause it is to
be thought that the good people in heaven: does see what is done amongis erthely
creatures in the world / And not the dampened people / per chance thou will
say the Joy of the souls that be saved: is a great way forther from the
souls that be dampened: then the acetis and deeds of the world / wherefore they
might see sooner the dedis of the world: then the Joys of blessid souls / It
is answered oon this wise / that those thingis which be done in the world:
may not grieve or vex the dampened souls no thing so much if they might se
them: as the beholdynge of the Joy that the blessed souls be in. Therefore they
be not showed to them / visebly / Theyse be the suffraunce of god such
things that may incresse most their sorrow but no thing that should be to
their Joy or comfort So^me perauenture would ask this questyon whether the
dampened souls in hell: would that every creature should be dampened as they
be. To this may be answered / that like as perfyght charity is convenient and
according ever to be with the holy souls: So among the dampened souls:
shall ever be perfyght hate and envy / then thus / The holy and blessed souls
shall ever Joy in all good deeds: and on the contrary: the dampened shall be sorry
for every good deed / The consideringe of the Joy and felicite of saints: is
to them great affeccion / Therefore they would all good people should be dampened /
The envy of them shall be so great: that being in eternal pain they shall
Inuye the Joy of their naybours that be saved / and of them with whom / they
have been conuersaunte in this world / A questyon might be moved whether the
dampened souls would have their naybours acquayntau^ce dampened with them
as well as all other: It may be answered thus / that they be not so enuyous to
their acquayntaunce or naibours: with whom they have committed and vsyd
sensual pleasures and delyghtis in the world: as they be to all other /
willing to have them dampened as they be / for this cause. If their companyons
should be dampened as they be: their tribulacion should be increased
accidentally / in so much as they that be dampened: were part takers with
their acquayntaunce of their pleasures and vicious concupiscence of their
pleasures and vicious concupiscence in the world: they must of equity be
part takers of their pain And so should they not only suffer sorrow for their
own gilt: but also for the gylte of their fellows / and acquayntaunce / An
example is put of the dampened rich man / which being in pain eternal
desired that his brethern a life: might have knowleige what pain he endured /
to thentent they might have grace: to save them self / for if they should be
dampened with him: which was the cause of their misdoynge in this world: his
pain should be increased / For he should suffer with them perte of their pain
/ And though by the multitude of the dampened souls the pain of iche oon of
them singularie is increased: yet their envy and hatered is so great: that
they couyt more to suffer tribulacion and tourmentrie with a great multitude:
then with one alone / For it is a common saiynge wretches be glade and desirous
/ to have fellawshyp in pain / Aquestion might be moved / whether they that
be deed: namely that be dampened: may know or have any remembrance of those
thyngys that they had knowledge of: in the world. To this may be said / that in
the dampened souls shall be a consyderacion of things which they did know
before And that knowledge or considerasion: shall be as amateriall cause of their
sorrow / And no thing of love nor comfort / They shall also consider the
sins that they have committed / wherefore they be dampened / and they shall
have in remembrance the good deeds: which they might have done: and would not
/ And for both: they shall suffer pain / Farthermore in hell shall be two
diverse pains / oon is called pena Da^ni which is the wantinge of the syghte
of god: the other is called pena sensus: which crist touchith in a gospel of
mathewe the.vii. Chaptour: saying / every tree that bearith no good feuyte:
shall be cut down and cast in to the fire Of the pain which is called pena
sensus: spekith saint Gregory upon the gospel of mathewe the.viii. Ehapitour
/ The dampened soul shall be cast out into the outward derkenesse. This said
pena sensus has many diuersiteis of kinds / and as I think innumerable /
su^me of them be showed and spoken of in this wise / In hell shall be cold
unable to be ouercomyn / Fire never to be quenched / worms that be mmortall /
intolerable stynke / derkenes palpable / Scorges of deuyllis / the horrible
sight of deuelles / the confusion of sins / and despair of all goodness / The
dampened souls shall be full of every sorrow and heaviness / They shall also have
contynuall weeping in their Iyes / gnastynge in their teeth / stynke in their
nose thirles / wailyng and criyngis in their voices / ferefulnes in their ears
/ Bands upon their hands and feet / And a co^tynuall fire and heat: in all
their members / whereof a certain doctor spekith on this manner / hell is a
deadly diche or pytte: heaptd full of all pains and wretchedness / And as it is
written in the.xiii. chapitour of ysaye / every dampened soul shall be feared of
other / Their facis and countenance shall be flamynge as fire / It is written in
the.ii. chapitour of Baruch / yt their facis shall be black of the smoke and
according to the same: it is spoken in the.ii. chapitour of Iohell / All the
facis of sinners shall be turned as black as a pot / Also the sharpnes of the
pains of hell may be consideryd by the weeping and gnastyng of teeth / by the
desire of death By the eatinge of their tunges / and by the blasphemynge of
their maker / with many other that be there to come: As it is open in many
placis of scripture / whereof it is written in the appocalippes the xix.
chapitour on this wise / For the great and intolerable sorrow: they did eat
their own tunges and blasphemed god of heaven: for their wounds and
tribulacions / The sharnes of their pain shall be so great: that they shall
despise life which is naturally desired of every creature: and desires deeth
that every creature naturally does flee / As it is written in the appocalippis
the.ix. chapitour / In thoo fearful days and at that fearful time: men
shall seek death: which they shall not find / they shall desire to dye: and
deeth shall flee from them / saint Crisostome says on this manner / what shall
we do there / what shall we answer / where no thing is but gnastynge of
teeth / howlynge And weeping / no help to be gotten / to late to do penance /
On every side and in every perte vexed incessauntly with pains intolerable /
And never to have any part of solace. There shall no creature appear before
our Iyen: but only the mynesters and tourmentours of hell / to minester pains
in every side / and that worste is of all: there shall be no comfore of the air
another of sight / O good lord what fear shall be to them that shall suffer
these pains / what breakyng of bowelles / what crushinge of members / what and
how many diverse crucifiyngis shall be in every sensible part of body and
soul: truly no creature may express by any mean / Saint Crisostome speaking
of the loss of the sight of good which is called pena da^ni says these
words / perauenture su^me and many folk do think no pain to great of
these forsaid pains: if they might escape the danger of hell / but I call
much more grievous pains than hell: to be removed / excluded / and cast out:
from the grace of god / from all goodness prepared and made ready for good and
holy people / And most of all: the priuacion and lakke of the sight of god /
to be hated of criste / and to her of him this ferefull word: I know you not
/ For sothe it is better a thousand times: to suffer lightnynge / then to
see that blessed lord full of mekenes and pyty against us / as our aduersarye
/ And to suffer the Iyen of all tranquillite and rest to behold us. O meke
son of god: we beseech the / let us not suffer theys pains / another have
in experience: the intolerable and horrible tourmentrie / woo shall to us that
think not another have any remembrance of these foresaid pains / For we do
now as men that by necligence: and thinkith them self sure: taking no head
of body nor soul / But gooth without let: in to the said pains of hell
/ perauenture su^me man will say that it semethe god to be vnrightwyse / for
man is punysshed eternally for one deadly sin done in one hour / Saint
Gregorye askith the said question: and geuyth solucion to it on this manner /
Almighty god which is a streyghte Judge: does not consider the words of men
oonly: but also he payseth the hertys. And so it is: that if the wykked people
might live in this world ever: they would perseuerantly continue in their
wyckydnes / and never amend them self / For truly they that never will leave
sin: shewyth and desyryth always to live in sin. Therefore it longyth to /
the great rightwysnes of god: to punysshe them by eternal pain: which in
this life would never be out of sin / And that noone end of pain be given to
the sinful creature: that whilis he lived in this world: would have noone
end of sin. And other reason why that oon deadly sin byndith a man to
eternalle pain may be taken: considering him to whom the offense is done /
which is the god of all goodness and might. Therefore the offense done: is
worthy eternal / pain / For as aristotill says i^ the.vii. of his ethic In
how much the person is greater indignity to whom the offense or trespace
is done: so much more it ought to be punysshed / and Crisostome according to
the same says / An Iniure or wrong done to a person: is to be considered as
the person is / A little offense done to a great person indignite: is great /
And great crime committed to a simple body: is compted but as a little fault
/ O my dear and well-beloved friend: knowing and often remembrynge in thine heart
these pains before rehearsed besely take heed and see: for the health of thyn
own soul / And ever behold inwardly the great pains of hell to be believed
/ Consider in thy self what things be profitable and wholesome to thy soul /
whether it is better to wayle / to be sorye / and often to ask mercy for thy
sins in this world: than to weep in everlasting fire / without remedy or
profit / thou shall deserve i^ short time of this world: if thou will / by
penance and sorrow for thy sins: forgeuenes / and everlasting comfort.
Therefore be sorry for thy sins here in this little time: to thentente thou may
hereafter be deliued form the sorrow everlasting / Meke thy self in this
world: that peradventure thou be not made meke in the pains of hell / and be
cast in to the fire unable to be quenched Blessed is that creature that in
this world hatyth and makyth him self ready to be found hable at the day of
Judgment: with the people that be worthy to be saved / And wretched is that
creature which by his sin has made him self unable to have the glory of
our lord / At the hour of the day of Judgment by the power of god: the
clouds shall take up to heaven: body and soul of them that be saved / And
the deuellis shall take body and soul of the dampened creatures: Casting
them in to the fornase the of brennynge fire of hell. who shall give to mine
head a great portion of water: and to mine Ien the founten of tears: besely
flowinge out / that I my self may weep / day and night / besechynge our
lord I be not found unstable in the hour of his coming: And that I may
deserve: not to here the fearful sentence of our lord / whenne he shall
say: Goo fro me: ye that has been the doers of wickedness / I know not what
ye be / which our lord Ihesu Criste: turn a way from us / that leueth
and reigns for evermore. Amen.
