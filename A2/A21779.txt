By the Queen.
A Proclamation for adjournement of part of Michaelmas Term.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty our sovereign Lady, is credibly informed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places in and
about the City of London, and in other places near adjoining to the same,
whereas by the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of
her loving Subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her
most royal person, but also unto her most loving subjects, repairing thither
for their suites and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of
the same in other parts of the Realm: Her Majesty for the said necessary
causes and considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of
Almighty God, with the coldenesse of the year, and such wholesome orders as
are to be taken in her said City, the rather cease by the adiournement of
part of this next term is Saint Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the
same, until the fourth return of the said Tearine, called Mensis Michaelis,
next coming: Her Majesty therefore of her especial favor and clemency, is
pleased and contented, to adiourne the said term of saint Michael, that is to
say, from the vtas thereof, until the said fourth return of the said
term, called Mensis Michaelis, next coming. Which her Majesty signifies to
all and singular her loving subjects of this her Realm, to the intent, that
they, and every of them, which has cause or commandment to appear in any of
her highness courts at Westminster, in, or at any day or time, from, and after
the said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their
business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to an^ of the said Courts for
that cause, before Mensis Michaelis, next coming, and that without danger
forfeiture, penalty, or contempt, to incur toward her Highness in that
behalf. And nevertheless her Highness pl^asure is, that two of her Justices,
that is to say, of either bench one, shall the first day of Michaelmas term,
called O^tabis Michaelis according to the ancient order of her Laws, keep the
essoines of the said Octabis Mi^ at which vtas of Saint M^chael, writtes of
adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices, giving t^^m authority to
adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to say, from the vtas
thereof, vnt^ll (...)Michaelis, as before is said: And the said adiournement
shall be made in the first day of the sa^de vtas, commonly called the day of
essoines. And further her Majesty's pleasure is, that all matters causes and
suites, depending in any of her other Courts between party and party, as in
her Highness Courts of Chauncerie, Star chamber and Exchequer, Courts of
wards and liueries, Duchy of Lancaster, and Courts of Requests shall have
continuance, and the parties shall have day from the date of these unto Mensis
Michaelis, as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Shetiffes, and other accomptants, and all other persons
that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of
her Majesty's court of Exchequer, court of wards and liueries, or of her
Duchy of Lancaster, or many of them, or to enter into any account in any of
the same courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster, where
her Highness has appointed such officers and ministers, as for that purpose
her Maie^^ie (...) thought expedient, and there to pay, and do in every
behalf, as though no such Proclamation of ad^^^^^^ment had been had or made:
And her Highness further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs (...)
return their Writtes and Process against all such accomptants and debtors at
the days therein appointed, And all other Writtes and process directed unto
them out of any of the Offices of her Majesty's Remembrancer, or the Treasorers
Remembrancer in her Highness said Court of Exchequer. And if any person or
persons who ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money to her
Majesty in any the Courts and places aforesaid, do make default therein. That
then her Highness writtes and Process shall be awarded, and sent forth against
every such person and persons, and the same to be duly and orderly served and
returned by the Sheriffs and Officers thereunto appointed, in such like manner
and form as the same should have been, if this present proclamation had not
been made. And if any Sheriff or other Officer shall make default, or be
negligent in serving, executing and returning of any the writtes and Process
aforesaid: That then every such Sher^ffe and other Officer shall incur such
pains and penalties, as by the said Courts, or any of them shall be taxed and
assessed: Willing and commanding all and every her Majesty's Sheriffs,
officers, ministers and subjects, to whom it does or shall appertain, to
observe and keep their assemblies and apparances, with all their returns and
certificats in her Highness said Courts at Westminster in Mensis Michaelis
nert coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to do their
offices and duties in every behalf, in like manner and form as they should
or ought to have done, if this present Proclamation had not been had or made,
as they will answer to the contrary at their perils.

Given at Lowghborowes, the xxii day of September, in the twentieth year of
our Reign.
