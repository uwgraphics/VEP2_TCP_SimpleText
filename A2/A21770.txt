By the Queen.
Forasmuch as the Queens Majesty our fourraigne Lady is credibly enfourmed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places in and
about the city of Westminster, whereas by the continuance thereof, through the
greater repair and resort of her loving subjects, great peril and danger
might not only ensue unto her most royal person, but also to her most loving
subjects repayring thither for their suits and causes, and thereby also give
occasion of dispearsyng of the same in other parts of the Realm: Her Majesty
for the said necessary considerations, and hoping that the same will by the
goodness of almighty God, with the coldness of the year, the rather cease by
the adiournment of part of this next Term of Saint Michael now at ^and, from
the vtas of the same, until the return, commonly called Mense Michaelis: Her
Majesty thereby of her especial favor and clemency, is pleased and
contented to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to say, from
the vtas thereof, unto the said time of Mense Michaelis, which her Majesty
signifies to all singular her loving subjects of this her Realm, to the
^^^^nt that they and every of them which has cause or commandment to appear
in any of her highness courts at Westminster, in, or at any day or time from
and after the said vtas of Saint Michael, ^^^y tarry at their dwellings, or
where their business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to any of the said
Courts for that cause, before the said Mense Michaelis next coming, and that
without danger of forfeyture, penalty, or contempt, to incur toward her
highness in that behalf. And nevertheless, her Majesty's pleasure is, that
two of her Justices, that is to say of either Bench one, shall the first day of
Michaelmas Term, called Octabis Michaelis, according to the ancient order of
her laws, keep the ^^soignes of the said Octabis Michaelis, at which vtas of
Saint Michael, writtes of adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices,
giving them aurthoritie to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is
to say, from the vtas thereof, until the same Mense Michaelis as before is
said, and the same adiournement s^al be made in the first day of the said
vtas, commonly called the day of the essoigns. And further her Majesty's
pleasure is, that all matters, causes, and suites depending in any of her other
Courts between party and party, as in her highness Courts of Chauncerie,
Star chamber, and the Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, and Duchy
of Lancaster, shall have continuance, and the party shall have day from the
date of these presents, unto Mense Michaelis as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectours, Receauers Sheriffs, and other accomptaunts, and all other persons
that ought or should account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of her
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, or of her Duchy
of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any account in any of the
same Courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster, where her
highness has appointed such officers and ministers, as for that purpose her
Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every behalf, as
though no such Proclamation of adiournment had been had or made: any thing
mentioned in this present Proclamation, or in any writ of adiournement to the
contrary, notwithstanding. ^illing and commanding all and every of her
Majesty's officers, ministers, and subjects, to whom it does or shall
appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and apparaunces, with all
their returns and certificates, in her highness said Courts at Westminster in
Mense Michaelis next coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there
to do their offices and duties in every behalf, in like manner and form as
they should or ought to have done, if this present Proclamation had not ben had
or made, is they will answer to the contrary at their perils.

Given at her Majesty's Town of Redyng, the xxix. day of September, 1576. the
xviii. year of her Majesty's reign.

Imprinted at London by Richard Judge, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
