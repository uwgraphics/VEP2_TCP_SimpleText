A Proclamation declaring his Majesty's pleasure concerning the dissoluing of
the present Conuention of Parliament.
ALbeit the Assembling, Continuing, and Dissoluing of Parliaments be a
Prerogative so peculiarly belonging to Our Imperial Crown, and the times and
seasons thereof so absolutely in Our own power, that we need not give account
thereof unto any: yet, according to Our continual custom, to make Our good
Subjects acquainted with the reasons of all Our public resolutions and
actions; We have thought it expedient at this time to declare, not only Our
pleasure and resolution therein, grounded upon mature deliberation, with the
advice and uniform consent of Our whole Privy Council; but therewith also to
note some especial proceedings moving Us to this resolution: And that chiefie
to this end, that as God, so the World may witness with Us, that it was Our
intent to have made this the happiest Parliament, that ever was in Our time:
And that the lettes, and impediments thereof being discerned, ail
misunderstandings and iealousies might be removed, and all Our people may
know and believe, that We are as far from imputing any of those ill
accidents, that have happened in Parliament, to any want or neglect of duty, or
good affection toward Us, by them in general, or by the greater and better
number of Parliament men, as we are confident (the true causes discovered) they
will be far from imputing it to any default in Us; there having in the beginning
of this late Assembly passed greater and more infallible tokens of love and
duty from Our Subjects to Us their Sovereign, and more remarkable testimonies
from Us of Our Princely care and zeal of their welfare, then have been in any
Parliament met in any former Age.

This Parliament was by Us called, as for making good and profitable Laws, so
more especially, in this time of miserable distraction throughout Christendom,
for the better settling of peace and Religion, and restoring Our Children to
their ancient and lawful patrimony, which We attempted to procure by peaceable
treaty, at Our own excessive charge, thereby to save and prevent the effusion
of Christian blood, the miserable effect of war, and dissension; yet with
full purpose, if that succeeded not, to recover it by the sword; and therefore,
as a necessary means conducing to those ends, the supply of Our Treasures was
to be provided for.

This Parliament beginning in January last, proceeded some months with such
harmony between Us and Our people, as cannot be paralleld by any former
time: For as the House of Commons at the first, both in the manner of their
supply, and otherwise, she wed greater love, and more respect then ever any
House of Commons did to Us, or (as We think) to any King before Us: So We,
upon all their complaints, have afforded them such memorable, and rare examples
of Justice, as many ages past cannot show the like; wherein, that We preferred
the weal of Our people before all particular respects, the things themselves
do sufficiently prove, Our Justice being extended, not only to persons of
ordinary rank and quality, but even to the prime Officer of Our Kingdom. And
although, after their first Recesse at Easter, We found that they misspent a
great deal of time, rather upon the enlarging of the limits of their
liberties, and diverse other curious, and unprofitable things, then upon the
framing and proponing of good and profitable Laws: Yet We gave them time and
scope for their Parliamentary proceedings, and prolonged the Session to an
unusual length, continuing it until the eight and twentieth day of May,
before We signified Our purpose for their Recesse; and then We declared, that
We would make a Recesse on the fourth day of June next following, but only for
a time, and in such manner, as might be without disturbance to any their
businesses in hand, expressing out of Our Grace (though We needed not) the
causes of that Our purpose, which were the season of the year, usually hot,
and unfit for great assemblies, Our Progress approaching, the necessity We
had to make use of Our Council attending in both houses, both to settle Our
weighty affairs of State before We went, and to attend Us when We went Our
Progress, the dissurnishing of Our ordinary Courts of Justice so many Terms
together, the long absence of Justices of Peace, and Deputy Lieuetenants, whose
presence was needful for making and returning of musters, and for subordinate
government of the Country; and therefore We appointed to adiourne the
Parliament on the fourth day of June, giving that warning longer then usual,
that they might set in order their businesses, and prepare their greeuances,
which We promised both to hear and answer before that Recesse, for
presenting whereof We appointed them a time. This message graciously intended
by Us, was not so well entertained by some, who in a short time dispersed and
spread their iealousies unto others, and thereby occasioned coffeehouse in
the House, for being adiourned without passing of bills; Yet made not their
address to Us, as had been meet, but desired a conference with the Lords; and
at that conference, the nine and twentieth day of May, under color of desiring
to petition Us for some further time, to perfect and pass some special Bills,
were imboldened, not only to dispute, but to refell all the reasons that We
had given for the adiournement, which being made known unto Us, We again
signified Our pleasure to both Houses, that on the fourth day of June the
Parliament should rise, but We would then give Our Royal assent to such
bills, as were or should be ready and fit to be then passed, continuing all
other businesses in state they were by a special Act to be framed for that
purpose.

The Lords with all duty and respect, submitted to Our resolution, passed the
Act, and sent it with special recommendation to the house of Commons; but they
neither read it, nor proceeded with businesses, but forgetting that the time
was Ours and not theirs, continued their coffeehouse, as they pretended, for
being so soon dismissed. We (though it were strange to observe such auersnes
for Our resolving upon such weighty reasons, that wherein We needed not to be
measured by any other rule, but Our own Princely will) yet were contented to
descend from our own Right, to alter Our resolution, and to continue the
Session for a fortnight more, wherein they might perfect such public Bills,
as were esteemed of most importance: for which purpose, We Our self came in
person unto the Higher house of Parliament, and made offer thereof unto them,
which being, in effect, as much as the Commons had formerly desired, was no
sooner offered, but yielding thanks to Us, the said Commons resolved the same
day directly, contrary to their former desire, to refuse it, and to accept Our
first Resolution of an adiournement; but attending Us at Greenwich, presented
no grieuances: This inconstancy, as We passed by with a gentle admonition; so
for the matter of grieuances, as well of England, as Ireland, We promised to
take them into Our own care, though not presented to Us, and really performed
the same so far forth, as time, and the advice of Our Council of each Kingdom
could enable Us, as is witnessed by Our several Proclamations, published in
both Realms, as like wise in granting at the same time those three suites
which were proponed unto Us by the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the request,
and in the name of both the Houses: But in conclusion the house of Commons
making it their choice, We made a Recesse by adiournement of the Parliament,
the fourth day of June: Though indeed We must do them this right, that at the
said Recesse, taking into their serious consideration the present estate of Our
children abroad, and the general afflicted estate of the true Professors of
Religion in foreign parts, they did with one unanimous consent, in the name of
themselves, and the whole body of the Kingdom, make a most dutiful and
solemn protestation, that if Our pious Endeauours, by treaty to procure their
peace and safety, should not take that good effect which was desired, (in the
treaty whereof, they humbly besought Us, not to suffer any long delay) then,
upon signification of Our pleasure in Parliament, they would be ready, to the
uttermost of their powers, both with lives and fortunes to assist Us, so as
that by the divine help of Almighty God, We might be able to do that by Our
sword, which by peaceable courses should not be effected.

But during the time of this long Recesse, having to Our great charges mediated
with the Emperor, by the means of Our Ambassador, the Lord Digbie, and
having found those hopes to fail, which we had to prevail by treaty, We in
confidence of the Assistance of Our people, thus freely promised and protested
in Parliament, did instantly shorten the time of the Recesse, (which We had
before appointed to continue until the eighth day of February,) and did
reassemble Our Parliament, the twentieth day of November last, and made known
unto them the true state and necessity of Our Childrens affairs, declaring Our
resolution unto them, of taking upon us the defense of Our Childrens patrimony,
by way of Arms, since We could not compass it by an amicable treaty; and
therefore expected the fruit of that their declaration, whereby We were invited
unto this course: wherein, how beit We are well satisfied of the good
inclination of the most part of Our House of Commons, testified by their ready
assent to the speedy payment of a Subsidy, newly to be granted, yet upon this
occasion some particular members of that House took such inordinate liberty,
not only to treat of Our high Prerogatives, and of sundry things, that without
Our special direction were no fit subjects to be treated of in Parliament; but
also to speak with less respect of foreign Princes, Our Allies, then were
fit for any Subject to do of anointed Kings, though in enmity and hostility
with Us. And when, upon this occasion, We used some reprehension toward those
miscarriages, requiring them not to proceed but in such things as were within
the capacity of that House, according to the continual custom of Our
Predecessors, then by the means of some evil affected and discontented
persons, such heat and distemper was raised in the House, that albeit
themselves had sued unto Us for a Session, and for a general pardon, unto both
which at their earnest suit We assented, yet after this fire kindled, they
rejected both, and setting apart all businesses of consequence and weight
(notwithstanding Our admonition and earnest pressing them to go on) they
either sat as silent, or spent the time in disputing of Privileges,
descanting upon the words and syllables of Our Letters and messages, which for
better clearing of truth, and satisfaction of all men, We are about to publish
in Print, so soon as possibly We can. And although in Our Answer to their
petition, We gave them full assurance that we would be as careful of the
preservation of their Privileges, as of Our own Royal Prerogative, and in
Our explanation after sent unto them by Our Letters, written to Our Secretary,
We told them that We never meant to deny them any lawful privileges that
ever that House enjoyed in Our predecessors times; and that whatsoever
privileges or liberties they enjoyed by any Law or Statute, should ever be
inuiolablie preserved by Us; and We hoped Our posterity would imitate Our
footsteps therein; and whatsoever privileges they enjoyed by long custom, and
uncontrolled and lawful Presidents, We would likewise be as careful to
preserve them, and transmit the care thereof to Our posterity, confessing Our
selves in justice to be bound to maintain them in their Rights, and in grace,
that We were rather minded to increase, then infringe any of them, if they
should so deserve at Our hands, which might satisfy any reasonable man, that
We were far from violating their privileges. And although by Our Letters
written to their Speaker, We advised them to proceed, and make this a Session,
to the end, that Our good and loving subjects might have some taste, as well of
Our grace and goodness toward them, by Our free pardon and good Laws to be
passed, as they had both by the great and unusual examples of Justice since
this meeting, and the so many eases and comforts given unto them by
Proclamation. And although We had given order for the Pardon to go on, and
that in a more gracious and liberal manner then has passed in many years
before, and signified Our willingness, that rather then time should be
misspent, they might lay aside the thought of the Subsidy, and go on with an
Act for continuance of Statutes, and the general Pardon; yet all this
prevailed not to satisfy them, either for their pretended Privileges, or to
persuade them to proceed with Bills for the good of themselves, and those that
sent them. But as the Session and Pardon were by them well desired at first; so
were they as ill rejected at the last; and not withstanding the sincerity of
Our protestations, not to invade their Privileges; yet by the persuasion of
such as had been the cause of all these distempers, they fall to carue for
themselves, and pretending causelessly to be occasioned thereunto, in an
unseasonable hour of the day, and a very thin House, contrary to their own
Custom in all matters of weight, conclude, and enter a protestation for their
liberties, in such ambiguous and general words, as might serve for future
times to invade most of our inseparable Rights and Prerogatives, annexed to Our
Imperial Crown: whereof not only in the times of other Our Progenitors, but
in the blessed Reign of Our late Predecessor, that renowned Queen ELIZABETH,
We found Our Crown actually possessed; an usurpation that the Majesty of a
King can by no means endure. By all which may appear, that howsoever in the
general proceedings of that House, there are many footsteppes of loving and
well affected duty to Us: yet some ill tempered spirits, have sowed tares
among the corn, and thereby frustrated the hope of that plentiful and good
harvest, which might have multiplied the wealth and welfare of this whole land;
and by their cunning diuersions have imposed upon Us a necessity of
discontinuing this present Parliament, without putting unto it the name or
period of a Session.

And therefore, whereas the said assembly of Parliament was by Our Commission
adiourned until the eight day of February now next ensuing, We, minding not to
continue the same any longer, and therefore not holding it fit to cause the
Prelates, Noblemen, and States of this Our Realm, or the Knights, Citizens and
Burgesses of the same Parliament to travail thereabout, have thought fit to
signify this Our resolution, with the reasons thereof unto all Our Subjects,
inhabiting in all parts of this Realm, willing and requiring the said
Prelates, Noblemen and States, and also the said Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, and all others, to whom in this case it shall appertain, that they
forbear to attend at the day and place prefixed by the said adiournement; and
in so doing, they are and shall be hereby discharged thereof against us. And We
do hereby further declare, that the said Conuention of Parliament, neither is,
nor after the ceasing and breaking thereof shall be, nor ought to be esteemed,
adjudged, or taken to be, or make any Session of Parliament.

And albeit We are at this time enforced to break off this Conuention of
Parliament: yet Our will and desire is, that all Our subjects should take
notice, for avoiding of all sinister suspicions and iealousies, that Our intent
and full resolution is, to govern Our people in the same manner, as Our
Progenitors and Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm of best
government, have heretofore done; and that We shall be careful, both in Our
own person, and by charging Our privy Counsel, Our Judges, and other Our
Ministers in their several places respectively, to distribute true Justice and
right unto all Our people; and that We shall be as glad to lay hold of the
first occasion in due and convenient time, which We hope shall not be long, to
call and assemble Our Parliament, with confidence of the true and hearty love
and affection of Our subjects, as either We, or any of Our Progenitors have
been at any time heretofore.

Given at Our Palace at Westminster, the sixth day of January, in the
nineteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save
the King.

most Excellent Majesty. M. DC. XXI.
