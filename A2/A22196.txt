Defender of the Faith, etc.

Officials: Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons: And also to

Borough of Lymmington in our County of Southampton, as also by a Certificate
from the Mayor and other Inha^ta^ts of Lymmington aforesaid, and of the
Parishes adjoining, sealed with the usual Seal of the Corporation of Lymmington:
That our said poor Subject John Long has always been a man of honest life
and conversation, and one that lived in good reputation, until such time as it
pleased God to visit him with great losses by Sea, who being owner of a Barque
called the Ioane of Lymmington, and lading her with iron and Timber, in the
year 1612, to be transported from Lymmington to Famouth in Cornwall, it so
happened, that the said Barque in her return homewards being reladen with Tyn
and other Marchandizes was through tempestuous weather cast away with the loss
of Three men's lives at Bigbury Bay, together with all the good in her,
Amounting in all to the value of Six Hundred and Ten Pounds or there abouts, To
the utter undoing of our said poor Subject, who before this untimely accident
lived well, and was able to defend the world, but has little or no means now
left to help himself, or to sustain his poor wife and Children, who live in
great want, and are like to continue the rest of their days in great misery
unless they be charitably helped and relieved by the good devotion and
benevolence of our loving and wel-disposed Subjects, in this their great
necessity.

KNOW ye therefore, that we (tendering the lamentable and distressed estate
of our said poor Subject) of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion, have
given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant unto our
said poor Subject John Long, and unto Robert Clarke his Deputy, and to their
Deputy and Deputies, the bearer or bearers hereof, full power, license and

benevolence of all our loving Subjects whatsoever Inhabiting within our
Counties of Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, and Essex, with our Cities of
Westminster, Canterbury, Rochester, and the Cinque Ports: And in all other
Cities, Towns corporate, privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and in all
other places whatsoever within our said Counties, and not elsewhere, for and
toward the recovery of his said losses, and the relief and maintenance of
himself, his poor wife and Family.

WHEREFORE we will and command you, and every of you, that at such time and
times as the said John Long, and Robert Clarke his Deputy, or their Deputy or

Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, for the better stirring up of a charitable
devotion, deliberately to publish and declare the Tenor of these our Letters
