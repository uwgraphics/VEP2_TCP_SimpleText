HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Queen.
A Proclamation against certain seditious and scismatical Books and Libelles,
etc.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty being given to understand that there are
sent from the parts beyond the seas, sundry seditious, scismaticall, and
erroneous printed Books and libelles, tending to the deprauing of the
Ecclesiastical government established within this Realm, set forth by Robert
Brown and Richard Harrison, fled out of the Realm as seditious persons,
fearing due punishment for their sundry offenses, and remaining presently in
Zealande: which several books, do manifestly contain in them very false,
seditious, and scismatical doctrine and matter, and have notwithstanding been
secretly sold, published, and dispersed in sundry places within this Realm,
to the end to breed some scisme among her Majesty's subjects, being persons
vnclearned, and unable to discern the errors therein contained: Her highness
therefore perceiving the wickedness of these evil spirits, and the malicious
disposition of lewd and evil disposed persons to be ready to violate and
break the peace of the Church, the Realm, and the quietness of her people,
and knowing it also to be most requisite and convenient for her highness to
use those means which God has appointed for preventing thereof, does will,
and also straightly charge and command that all manner of persons what so
ever, who have any of the said Books or any of like nature in his or their
Custody, that they and every of them do forthwith upon the publishing
hereof, bring in and deliver up the same unto the Ordinary of the Diocese, or
of the place where they inhabit, to the intent they may be burned, or utterly
defaced by the said Ordinary. And that from henceforth no person or persons
whatsoever, be so hardy as to put in print or writing, sell, set forth,
receive, give out or distribute any more of the same or such like sedicious
books or libels, as they tender ber Majesty's good favor, and will answer
for the contrary at their uttermost perils, and upon such further pains as the
Law shall inflict upon the offenders in that behalf, as persons maintayning
such seditious actions, which her Majesty myndeth to have severely executed.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Greenewich the last day of June, in the five
and twentieth year of her highness Reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
