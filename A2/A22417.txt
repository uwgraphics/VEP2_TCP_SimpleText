Anno primo Caroli Regis.
An Act to enable the Kings Majesty to make Leases of Lands, parcel of his
Highness Duchy of Cornwall, or annexed to the same.
WHereas the King Our Sovereign Lord, being in the life time of His Royal
Father of blessed memory, seized of the said Dukedom of Cornwall, did
bargain and contract for Leases and Estates to be made of diverse Messuages,
Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, parcel of the said Dukedom of Cornwall,
which Leases and Estates, His Majesty was enabled to have made in His said
Fathers life time, by an Act of Parliament made in the last Session of
Parliament, entitled, An Act to enable the most Excellent Prince Charles to
make Leases of Lands, parcel of His Highness Duchy of Cornwall, or annexed
to the same. And because His Majesty, having received diverse Fines, and sums
of Money, according to the said Contracts, and having entered into Treaty with
diverse others for like Estates, the finishing of which Contracts, and making
the said Leases, was prevented by His Majesty's access to the Imperial Crown
of this Realm, is graciously pleased for the good of his poor Tenants of the
said Duchy Lands, to proceed to the full accomplishment of the Contracts, and
Leases of the premises.

Be it therefore enacted by our said Sovereign Lord the King, the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and
by authority of this present Parliament, That all Leases to be made within the
space of three years now next ensuing by our said Sovereign Lord the King, by
letters Patents, Indentures, or other writings under His great Seal of
England, or Seal of the Court of Exchequer, of any Manors, Lands, Tenements,
or Hereditaments, parcel of the possessions of the said Duchy of Cornwall,
or annexed to the same, shall be good and effectual in Law, according to the
purport and content of the said Leases, against our said Sovereign Lord the
Kings Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and against all and every person or
persons, that shall hereafter have, inherit or enjoy the said Dukedom of
Cornwall, by force of any Act of Parliament, or other limitation whatsoever.

Provided always, That every such Lease so to be made, of any Manors, Lands,
Tenements, or Hereditaments in possession, shall be made but for three lives
or fewer, or for one and thirty years or under, or some other term of years
determinable upon one, two, or three lives, and not above. And if such Leases
be made in reuersion, That then the same, together with the Estates in
possession, do not exceed three lives, or the term of one and thirty years,
and not in any wise dispunishable of waste: And so as upon every such Lease
shall be reserved the ancient or most usual Rent, or such Rent as has been
yielded or paid for the greater part of twenty years next before the making of
the said Leases, and shall be reserved due and payable, by, or to him or her
that shall have the inheritance or other Estate, of the said Manors, Lands,
Tenements, or Hereditaments. And where no such Rent has been reserved or
payable, that then, upon every such Lease, there shall be reserved a reasonable
Rent, not being under the twentieth part of the clear yearly value of the
Manors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments contained in such Lease.

And be it further ordained and enacted by authority of this present
Parliament, That all Covenants, Conditions, and Reseruations, and other
agreements contained in every Lease so to be made, as aforesaid, shall be good
and effectual in Law, according to the words and contents of the same, as well
for, and against them, to whom the Reuersion of the same Manors, Lands,
Tenements, or Hereditaments shall come, as for and against them to whom the
said Leases shall come, respectively: As if our said Sovereign Lord the Kings
Majesty at the time of the making of such Covenants, Conditions, and
Reseruations, and other agreements were seized of an absolute and indefeizible
estate in Fee simple, in the same Manors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments:
Saving always to all and every person and persons, bodies Politic and
Corporate, their Heirs and Successors, Executors, Administrators, and
Assigns, (other then our said Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty and his
Heirs, and all and every person and persons that shall hereafter have,
inherit, or enjoy the said Dukedom of Cornwall, by force of any Act of
Parliament, or other limitation whatsoever) all such Rights, Titles, Estates,
Customs, Interests, Terms, Claims, and Demands whatsoever, of what kind,
nature, or quality whatsoever, of, in, to, or out of the said Manors, Lands,
Tenements, or Hereditaments, or any of them, as they or any of them had, or
ought to have had before the making of this Act, to all intents and purposes,
and in as large and ample manner and form, as if this Act had never been had
or made: This Act or any thing therein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding.
