A new Ballet of the strange and most cruel Whippes which the Spaniards had
prepared to whippe and torment English men and women: which were found and
taken at the overthrow of certain of the Spanish Ships in July last past.
1588.
To the tune of the valiant Soldiour.
Whippes for the women.
Whippes for the men.


AL you that list to look and see
what profit comes from Spain,
And what the Pope and Spaniards both,
prepared for our gain.
Then turn your eyes and bend your ears,
and you shall hear and see,
What courteous minds, what gentle hearts
they bear to thee and me.
They say they seek for Englands good,
and wish the people well:
They say they are such holy men,
all other they excel.
They brag that they are Catholics,
and Christ's only Spouse:
And what so ere they take in hand,
the holy Pope allows.
These holy men, these sacred Saints,
and these that think no ill:
See how they fought against all right,
to murder, spoil and kill.
Our noble Queen and Country first,
they did prepare to spoil:
To ruinate our lives and lands,
with trouble and turmoyle.
And not content by fire and sword
to take our right away:
But to torment most cruelly
our bodies night and day.
Although they meant with murdring hands
our guiltless blood to spill:
Before our deaths they did devise
to whip us first their fill.
And for that purpose had preparde
of whips such wondrouse store,
So straungely made, that sure the like
was never seen before.
For never was there Horse nor Mule,
nor dog of currish kind,
That ever had such whips deuisde
by any sauadge mind.
One sort of whips they had for men,
so smarting fierce and fell:
As like could never be deuisde
by any devil in hell.
The strings whereof with wyerie knots,
like rowels they did frame,
That every stroke might tear the flesh
they laid on with the same.
And plucked the spreading sinews from
the hardened bloody bone,
To prick and pearce each tender vein,
within the body known.
And not to leave one crooked ribbe,
on any side unseen:
Nor yet to leave a lump of flesh
the head and foot between.
And for our seely women eke,
their hearts with grief to clogge,
They made such whips wherewith no man
would seem to strike a dog:
So strengthened eke with brazen tagges,
and filde so rough, and thin
That they would force at every lash
the blood abroad to spinne.
Although their bodies sweet and fair,
their spoil they meant to make:
And on them first their filthy lust
and pleasure for to take.
Yet afterward such sower sauce
they should be sure to find,
That they should curse each springing branch
that comes of their kind.
O Ladies fair what spite were this,
your gentle hearts to kill:
To see these deuilish tyrants thus
your childrens blood to spill.
What grief unto the husband dear,
his loving wife to see
Tormented so before his face
with extreme villainy.
And think you not that they which had
such dogged minds to make
Such instruments of tyranny,
had not like hearts to take
The greatest vengeance that they might
upon us every one:
Yes, yes, be sure, for godly fear
and mercy they have none.
Even as in India once they did
against those people there,
With cruel Curres in shameful sort
the men both rent and tear:
And set the Ladies great with child
upright against a tree,
And shoot the^ through with pearcing darts,
such would their practice be.
Did not the Romans in this land,
sometime like practice use,
Against the Britains bold in heart,
and wonderously abuse
The valiant King whom they had caught
before his Queen and wife,
And with most extreme tyranny
dispatched him of his life?
The good Queen Voadicia,
and eke her daughters three:
Did they not first abuse them all
by lust and lechery:
And after stripped them naked all,
and whipped them in such sort:
That it would grieve each Christian heart
to hear that just report.
And if these ruffling mates of Rome
did Princes thus torment:
Think you the Romish Spaniards now
would not show their desent.
How did they late in Rome rejoice,
in Italy and Spain:
What ringing and what Bonfires,
what Masses sung amain.
What printed Books were sent about,
as filled their desire:
How England was by Spaniards won,
and London set on fire.
Be these the men that are so mild,
whom some so holy call:
The Lord defend our noble Queen,
and Country from them all.
