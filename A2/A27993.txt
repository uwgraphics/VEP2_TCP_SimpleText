Reverendo Viro JOHANNI WALL, S S. Theologiae Doctori, and Aedis CHRISTI Oxon.
Praebendario.
MItto ad te (Vir Reverende) (...) Poematii versionem Lyrico-Anglicanam; id ut
facerem quae me potissimum commoverunt paucis si vacaverit accipias; Conatibus
meis Metricis jam tum primis, trepidulis, lucem and compita non expertis ut
Janum spectarent atque Vertumnum extitisti author; audere ipsos, in ^ublicum se
dare, censorculum quemvis si non contemhere saltem negligere fecisti non
improbanda; Quod igitur Tentata via sit, etc. quod ex Oblivionis specu
fortassis emerserim, tibi debeo acceptum refer, and refero; siquidem illi per
quem tota messis crescit primitias non obtulisse religio est: Deinde prodierunt
non ita pridem Londini Bib. Poliglotta VI. Tomis comprehensa, nec non and
Criticorum SS. volumina IX. quae duo opera si eruditionis Theologicae Thesauri
(...), Templique nostri Jachin and Boaz hoc soeculo non audiverint, Pascitur in
vivis livor. -- Criticos ij ediderunt qui e typis stanneis circulos argenteos
conflare amant, Bibliorum impressionem viri tum in rep. tum in Ecclesia
illustres collatis sumptibus adjuverunt; horum tu numerum foelicissime claudis;
Ego vero sic existimo, nullam posse cujusvis libri Biblici a^t Ecphrasin, aut
Paraphrasin, aut Metaphrasin proelum subire, quae non horum alicui jure optimo
Danda, Dicanda, and Consecranda sit; ex his autem omnibus te primum occurrisse
mihi, eandem scilicet Aedem Celeberrimam in qua tu emines incolenti, non erit
cur mireris: Recipe igitur in clientelam foetum hunc nostrum, inque erudito
sinu fove; metuit sibi male Uzae Dominus ne potuerit -- ignem meruisse secundum
Ut male descriptus, -- ne ipsi Sabaeos Chaldaeosque Lectorculi severiores
praestent; Tu Magno Toleratori interposito Patrocinii tui umbone subveni,
extrema nisi subveneris bis passuro: Non me latet esse quamplurimos qui
(Saeculum (...) cum (...) confundentes) solos Pseudo- Chaldaeos, solos Sabaos
imaginarios Heroi nostro vim contulisse, ipsiusque Jobi and Nomen fictitium
fuisse and Personam mere Dramaticam contendunt; Verum cum in initio Libri tum
Verbum Substantivum tum Pronomen Demonstrativum non sine emphasi quadam
usurpentur (quod in Parabolis and narrationibus lusoriis non fit) imo in
commate illo prooemiali bis repetantur, (...) Isch hajah -- vehajah haisch
hahu, ut videatur Scriptor (...) velle hujusmodi dubitationibus occurrere,
dicendo, Extitit autem Ille Vir, Ille ipse, inquam; cumque pronuntiet Deus Opt.
Max. Ezech. 14.20. Licet Noachus, Daniel, and Job in ea essent, liberarent
tantum animas suas; adeoque aperte significet Jobum aeque versatum fuisse in
vivis ac Noachum aut Danielem, homines plusquam Pyrrhonice incredulos nisi ad
solemn culminantem statuerint coecutire Historiam istam inter honestiores
Fabulas numerare qui possint non intelligo; Facturusque operae pretium fum si
tempora tua tantisper morer dum nonnihil etiam de Loco in quo habitavit hic
nostes, nonnihil etiam de Tempore quo vixit hic adjiciam: Locum (Terram Uz)
investiganti mihi si extraneos in auxilium voco frustra sum; ^^us Heylinius
nost^as dubio procul rem confecit; fuitque nodus tanto vindice non indignus:
istum Asiae tractum, qui primum ^edar, deinde Arabia Desenta audiit, hodie
Beriara dicitur, decantatissimae huic Tragicom oediae schenam praebuisse
sequentia evincunt: Tres tantum regiones hanc appellationem sortitae in Sacro
Codice occur^unt; quarum prima (sic d. ab Uzo fill. Arami, Genesis 10.23.) ad
Boream and Damascum jacuit; ad Boream, inquam, a Judaea, etsi non ab integra
Palestina; in Judaea autem jam Palestinae part tantum and a caeteris 10
tribubus avulsa versatum fuisse hujusce Historiae concinnatorem ex infra
dicendis de Tempore editionis colligetur; Verum enim vero Terram UZ patient^
Jobo consciam ab hac Judaea ad Orientem positam Scriptura docet: Deinde, quis
hominum qui modo (...) non fuerit, animura facile induxerit ut credat Chaldeas
Euphratis accolas, and Sabaeos F^oelicis Arabiae incolas poene ad fontes
Jordani idque per praerupta viarum praedandi causa excurrisse regeretur
(opinon) non Mortalium C^neos sed triste Caco-daemonum agmen huc penetrasse,
cui curiofissime alato nullum longum est iter, nulli montes impervii; At
proderes se and malitiam suam hac ratione Dux gregis Satanas non minus ac si
vestigia sulphurea post se relinqueret; certo certius noluit vaferrimus ille
Agyrta dum hominem indueret veterem exuere Serpencem, and per imprudentiam
aliquid admittere quod Uzitis suspicionem creare possit; cum latrones Syros aut
sicarios Trans-jordanenses aeque facile simulasset, and sub eorum specie melius
latuisset: proinde in hac regione Jobus ipsum sedulo quaerentibus Non Est
Inventus; pereuntque Chartae Geographicae Pinedaea-Adrichomianae: Alia erat
regio Uz apud Idumaeos, (cujus meminit Jerem. Thren. 4.21. Laetare, oh filia
Ed^m, quae habitas in terra Uz,) sic d. ab Uzo fill. Dishani e posteris Esau;
hoec autem sita fuit a Judaea versus Austrum, neque Syros Chaldaeosque valde
vicinos habuit; adeoque quae contra illam alteram allata sunt, contra hanc
etiam si repetuntur faciunt: Restat Tertia hujus nominis regiuncula in Arabia
Deserta fita, haec ea est de qua quaeritur; quam sic d. ab Uzo fill. Nachoris
fratris Abrahami, Genesis 22.21. dudum observavit D. Hieronymus, and argumentum
inde duxit quo Terram Uz non procul a Charra celebri Mesopotamiae urbe probaret
jacuisse; Deinde, in Arabia Deserta regio erat (test Geographorum principe

neque in Iduma^ versatus est hic cujus patientiam suspicimus laudamusque (ut

miseriam; e lite^is Tetragrammato^ con^icientibus siqua exciderat damnum ingens

ipsissimus annus in quo exaratus est Liber iste omnes and singulos aeque latet
ac finis propter quem exararetur; siquidem existimant nonnulli eo spectare haec
omnia ut afflictissimis Judaeis inque captivitatem abductis animus firmaretur,
alii (inter quos Atlas ille Litterarum Batavus in Gallia,) ut allicerentur
posteri Esau ad verum Dei cultum retinendum, alii aliter; id modo certum est,
sero admodum scriptam fuisse hanc Historiam, quippe cui vocum Hebraicarum Novus
fere Orbis inferatur ante Davidis and Solomonis tempora plane Incognitus;
nonnulla vocabula partim Symaca, partim Ismaelitica invenias; novi etiam flores

unde proclivis est inferentia, Librum non antequum verba exotica insolitaeque

donarentur; adeoque sero editum: Ad haec, multas habet Liber iste e Psalmis,
Proverbiis ac Ecclesiaste citatas sententias. De Authore (ea epistolam claudet
annotutiuncula) constat; S. Spiritum cum fuisse Codex ipse (quisquis fuit ille

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
I Am not so sensible that these ensuing lines come short of the anciently
admired and now happily reviving Pindarick strain, as I am sure it must be
allowed me by all serious and judicious Readers, that does much more of the
Original height of this Sacred Poem: By what may be gathered from the writings
of some Fathers, and the ghesses of many modern, calm Critics it plainly
appears (let Jo. Scaliger be as angry as he will) that this History fell from
the holy Pen man thereof in Verse; and therefore how proper it is that it should
be thus rendered, I need not contend: As for the kind of Verse here pitched
upon, how suitable that is in this case, he who shall but consider what sort of
Verse the Hebr^w runs in, Alsted. Encyclopoed l. 26. c. 13.
which is Metrum solo syllabarum numero constans, citra similem Terminationem,
and withal the nature of this wherein there is In genere Lyrico multimoda and
incerta compositio respectu tum Colorum tum Stropharum, Id. lib. eod. cap. 14.
will abundantly satisfy himself: For my own particular, if it be asked why I
would venture upon this incomparable strain, and how I dared so much as to
attempt the transcribing of so Divine a Copy, the same Answer will serve for
both Interrogatories, though I had rather it should be applied to the last,
viZ. That Imitation seems to be nothing else but Admiration so well employed,
and so far improved as to deserve the epithet of Industrious.

Concerning the truth of this Histo^y of Job, the Place where, and Time when he
lived, I have spoken already in a more proper Dialect; and therefore shall only
add here, that, if any thing in this or other Scripture-relations seem absurd
or improbable, the reason thereof is not because of any real absurdity or
fiction in the relation it self, but of our either mistaking the sense of the
place, or being ignorant of some material passage, which we missing of may not
presently perceive the consistency of the rest one with another: Thus some
think it ridiculously said in the 42. chap. of this book, ver. 10. The Lord
gave Job twice as much as he had before, because in the 13. v. his Children are
found to be but just as many as he had at the first; when as (alas!) the Holy
Ghost does in those words tacitly condemn the Sadduces and Psychopannychists,
by esteeming the House, Cattle, etc. which were once consumed utterly perish't,
but reckoning the deceased Sons and Daughters among the living; and Job had at
the same time twice ten Children (as well as twice seven thousand Sheep, twice
three thousand Camels, etc.) though not all in the same world existent: Thus
likewise Naamah is looked upon by some as too far from the land of Uz for
Zophar to come from thence to visit Job, as b^ing situated in the South part of
the t^ibe of Judah; whenas indeed it is not necessary that should be the town
from whence Zophar came, but there might have been another of that name as near
Job's habitation as we have elsewhere found there was a Shuah, and a Teman,
though our Geographer has not been so kind as to direct us to it as well as to
the other two.

The Book it self (here made Verse) is well known to consist partly in a brief
Narrative of Job's Ruin and Restoration, partly in a large discourse which
the Deity entered into with him, and a larger which he maintained with his four
Friends; in the latter whereof the design of his Visitants on the one side was
to baffle him into a self condemnation, and his on the other side to stand upon
his defense, and make good what he held, viz. That we cannot truly judge of a
man by his outward condition: And in this his opinion the World has found him
seconded by Heaven it self confuting his Opponents to their faces, and also by
all Nations in all ages, as it would be easy to show; To instance only in the
Romans, among them -- Careat successibus opto, etc. was as good sense as Latin
before their Language was corrupted; and they still express themselves to the
same effect in modern Italian thus, Villano non e chi ni villa sta, ma villano
e chi villainy fa. I need not with Pineda or Sanctius state the Question, and
formally dispute, Whether Job was an Absolute Prince or no, since, whatsoever
quality he was of whom Providence in those days singled out to be successively
the Subject of the extremest misfortune and greatest prosperity, we are sure
that part has in this Age been acted by a Mighty Monarch; against whom there
have risen up such as by their actions surely meant to prove the Sabaean
plunderers unskilful in their own art, and the Chaldaean robbers conscionable
men; whose stately Palaces have been thrown down by the violence of a blasting
Vote from out of a thin, desolate, and Desert House; whose goods, and every
thing in which he might justly delight or glory, have been destroyed by the
help of that Artificial fire, which, though the Grand enemy of mankind were not
in every piece of iron that vented it, yet some are resolved to believe he
first found out in the shape of a German Monk; who, in short, has been a most
notable example to demonstrate (as it were) that to Heaven's Favorites Loss is
Gain, and that Patience is a Crowning virtue; for his Friends are double the
number they were at the first, seeing those who not many years ago were his
(because his Father's) Enemies, have kindly faced about, and been successful
practitioners in Loyalty; how much his Treasures are increased, let his
Exchequer speak; and how his Territories shall be more and more enlarged, I
leave to future Victories, and the year 1666. to declare; And so content my
self at present with what I find written of this our famous Sufferer in the
more habitable part of Arabia the D^sert: That never too much adored piece
which sets forth his Life and Death (I mean so much of either as the Sacred
Records acquaint us with) has often been Translated into English, but with
what very great success. I am not here to determine; It would well become men
of abilities in this way to let themselves be provoked to undertake the the
task, and perform what others only endeavor, that so by degrees this excellent
History may appear in such an English dress as it deserves: (...), etc. (I
confess) has been, is, and will be too well grounded a Proverb to the end of
the world; And it is true,

Sheph. Call. October. lin. 61.
-- Moecenas long ago is dead,
And great Augustus is yclad in clay,
And all the Worthies lie ywrapt in lead, etc.
However the late Prince of English Poets has not in that his just complaint
given us his friends, or other his successors so great a wound, but the present
Emperor brings as broad a plaster, where he sets forth the small and therefore
noble Fortunes of this His hireless Science, Condib. l. 2. cant. 5. stan. ult.
and of all alone
The Liberal, -- the rest each State
In pension treats, but this depends on none;
Whose worth they rev'rendly forbear to rate.
Poesy then must have the honor to be (Vertue-like) its own reward; neither
will there be wanting those who being truly enamoured on her will embrace her
without a dowry: Such as these may be pleased to be hereby excited to employ
their Time and Parts on a Theme sufficiently worthy of both, at least they may
receive no small delight from the perusal of what was my last-moneths
Recreations.

PATIENTIA VICTRIX; OR, The BOOK of JOB: In LYRICK Verse.
I.
1. IN that famed Quarter of the world, the East,
Where light expiring in the Atlantic Main
So gloriously revives again,
The Uzzites a large tract of ground possessed,
And here lived Job among the rest;
Holiness his delight he made,
Of God and Sin he was afraid,
That is, of the highest good and greatest ill,
That he adored, this he avoided still:
2. The God whom he adored
Ten Children did to him afford;
Sev'n of 'um were to weild the sword,
Three were to sit at home and spin,
And work in silk the victories those sev'n should win.
3. For every lusty lad
A thousand Sheep he had,
For every maid
About his house as many Camels strayed,
His grounds five hundred yoke
Of Oxen broke,
Wherein as many Female asses brayed;
He had m'ny a spat'ous mead
Where-in so many Sheep might feed;
He had as many goods as might suffice
To make those laden Camels rise;
And all those Kine were scarce enough
His fields to plow;
And all those Asses were to work and breed,
Their milk his healthy people did not need:
Yet his estate was not so large
But he had as great a charge,
Which he so nobly saw maintained
That the Surname of Most Magnificent he gained.
4. His young men in their turns Sympos'archs were,
And to provide good commons did not spare,
And with their sisters to prevail
That they would not fail
To come and take a share
In their (so termed) ordinary fare:
5. Now when the course was done,
And every one
Had took and given a collation,
Job ordered a Parasceue,
And on the foll'ing day
By light just rising offered
A Holocaust for every head;
And, every time he fired, said;
Oh Thou who heaven, and earth, and sea have made,
If such or such an one have done amiss,
If he have bowed his knee
To that vile Drunken Deity,
And secretly blasphemed thee,
Oh for his crime accept the life of this,
And spare thou his!
As often as they renewed their feast,
He acted both the Prince and Priest:
6. Now when the solemn time drew near
For those blessed Spirits who above remained,
And what they had been born withal retained
Before their Great King-Father to appear,
Out a bright creature sprang
And the Quis sicut Deus sang;
Another did proclaim that Light
Where-of himself was one weak beam;
Another showed forth his Makers Might
Where-of himself a part did seem;
Another Anthems did indite,
And made that Spring of Health his theme
Where-of himself was one poor stream;
Mich'el gazed,
^^r'el blazed,
Gabriel gave a Victor's sho^t,
Raphael joyful acclamat'ons raised,
The other Angels lay his throne about,
And their Almighty Sovereign praised:
Seraphims the Service led,
Holy, holy Majesty
Was the substance of their cry,
Cherubims loudly answered:
Domin'ons with their nature did dispense,
And would be no Domin'ons now;
Powers their power did disavow;
Principalities did bow;
Virtues resigned their influence;
Thrones were ambit'ous to do reverence:
All came to own their Lord, and homage do,
So likewise did the Grand Apostate too;
7. And being asked, Satan, whence come you?
By him who that and all things knew,
I come (quoth he)
From land and sea;
From the poles, and from the line;
From Syria, Arab'a, Palestine;
From among Graec'ans, Pers'ans, Moors,
Their City-gallants and their Country-boors;
I have been rambling too and fro,
For from my way I cannot go;
Where any travel, there is my road,
Where any live, there is my abode;
Where last of all I was I have forgot,
But come in general from yonder spot:
8. There Is one cried up, Vz gave him birth,
(Quoth the high Majesty of heaven and earth)
And he gives that a lasting name;
Took you no notice of this Man of fame,
As through Arabia you came?
Satan, I challenge Hell,
And all those env'ous ones that with thee fell,
What is it where-of you can my Job accuse?
What ill does he embrace? what good refuse?
There is not such a Saint on earth as he;
My honor on his holy life I Will trust,
He Is so made up of purity,
To me so pious, and to men so just,
Speaking the truth and shaming thee:
9. I know him well, the Enemy replied,
From Mount Seir's top I have his lands descried;
I have observd his dwelling towers,
I have surveyed his pleasure-bowr's,
And I have counted his devot'on-hours;
Well may he serve his God and holy be,
What servant ever such wages had as he?
So rich an income's a good salary:
10. So well improved a Stock! so sweet a Soil!
It seemed another Paradise to me,
Which I was thinking how to spoil;
But it is not spoild, nor like to be;
My Strength not much, my Art but little can,
I cannot here through the Woman tempt the Man;
He will not hear me in her call,
He will not from his Innocence fall;
For why, your Angel does his Eden guard,
He lives so well, 'cause you so well reward:
But alter now your course a while,
Cease on your Favorite to smile;
His cattle give away
To the Pickeerers for a prey,
In harvest time his harvest stay,
The fruit of his own body slay,
Be fur'ous now, and blow his palace down,
He Will give you wrath for wrath, and frown for frown;
And, if let in into this place,
His holiness will curse you to your face.
With that these words were utterd from the Throne,
^o then, Abhaddon, go,
And as thy name is, be thou so;
Destroy all that he calls his own,
Only his person let thou that alone:
Then Satan went his way,
And being gone made no delay
To exercise the power he had gained,
13. When not long after that, Job's eldest son
His hospitality begun,
And's brothers and his sisters entertained:
He on his near relat^ons spent
The double port'ons Heaven had sent;
They lovingly sat down, and did not fear
To fall to their untasted cheer,
For fatal figs were yet unknown,
Nor did they send away their souls
Ever they durst venture on their bowls,
For riot was not yet a custom grown:
Their Sire at home in his apartment fate,
Both in himself and them yet fortunate;
But now the Tragedy began,
Now the indeed Desert Arabian
Was in Afflictions furnace to be tried,
For in came one and cried,
14. Sir, We were plowing up a piece of land,
And so your Oxen were employed;
The Asses not far off did stand,
And what the close allowed enjoyed;
15. When out came the Sabaean bands,
I need not tell you what to do,
Having their steel Commissions in their hands
Your beasts they plundered, and your servants slew;
Oxen and Asses, Sir, are borne away,
Yesterday yours, but theirs to day;
Your men that then were now are not,
Only I away have got,
I only escaped to you to run,
To signify what they have done:
Thus having said, aside he stepped,
16. And in another leapt,
And, Sir, (quoth he) the element of Fire
Is held still upwards to aspire,
But it lately downwards fell
Bringing from heaven a hell;
And having burned
Your flocks of Sheep,
And those you sent those flocks to keep,
Up to its proper place again returned;
I only escaped the greedy flame,
To live to let you know the same:
17. His tale was scarcely finished yet,
When another in did get,
He seemed doubly wet,
First with tears and then with swet;
Ill news! (cried he) your Camels, Sir, are taken,
Three troops came scouring o'r the plain,
And having seized the beasts went back again;
Your neighbors of Assyria they were,
(If all are neighbors that live near)
They seemed that way the prize to bear;
We fought 'um, but in vain,
For being overpow'rd your men are slain;
I only escaped their thirsty sword,
To live to come and bring you word:
18. He scarce had done,
When in another rush't, and thus begun,
Your Son, (ah Sir!) your eldest Son
Who now shall never be your heir,
Lately a banquet did prepare,
And made his private house
The common Rendesvouz
For all to whom you Father are,
And they accordingly assembled there;
Thither both Sexes came to dine,
19. But as they eat
Their pleasant meat,
And quaff't the riches of the Vine,
19. There suddenly was heard a ruffling sound,
From the wilderness a mighty tempest blew,
And down the corners of the house it threw,
With which the whole fell to the ground,
And th'guests with ruin were incompass't round;
Who having no way left to fly,
Now buried in the rubbish lie;
I only escaped the dismal fall,
To live to come and tell you all.
20. Then arose Job,
And rent his robe,
His decent locks he laid by,
Where formerly they grew
There did he ashes strew,
Acquitting thus the angry Deity;
Which, while his body on the earth did ly,
Aloft his spirit soared,
And in humility adored;
21. Naked came I from the womb,
And naked must I to the tomb;
I may no goods of any sort
From hence export;
God gives, and what he gives retakes,
Of poor men rich, of rich men poor he makes;
Let him do what he please, I thank him for it:
22. Though wind and fire,
Saboean and Chaldoean troops conspire
Twisted destruction upon Job to bring,
He Is still unchangd, he is still the same,
He throws not up though cross the game,
He does no impious devices frame,
No traitorous thoughts against his Maker and his King.
II.
1. A Second time the Angels did appear
'Forc their dread Sovereign,
And in their train
The long-since banished Mutineer
Who could his former luster feign,
Did for some space a readmission gain;
Among the children came that slave,
Among the morning-stars that cloud,
The cursed Spirit was allowed
Once more to thrust into the blessed crowd,
And like a loyal Courtier himself behave:
2. Who being asked as before,
Satan, whence come thou?
As he had answered then, he answered now,
The Center-globe I have been rambling over,
Cross the seas, along their shore,
Where trav'llers were I made one more,
And whither Seamen bore I hoar,
In short I come into this world from yonder lower:
3. God asked on, and said,
Have thou of Job no observation made?
That Grand Exemplar of Integrity,
Who cannot imitated be,
Loving all goodness and its author Me.
Hating all evil and its father thee,
And adding unto true Religion Constancy;
He Is not from Me 's old Master to be won,
Though I to satisfy thy lust
Have been toward him (I Would almost said) unjust,
And he o'rewhelmd with misery be quite undone:
4. O'rewhelmed (quoth the Enemy)
With misery!
This seems not misery to be,
His goods, his men, his children are not he;
When was ever such folly show'n
As for one not to let his beasts be taken.
His men and children slain,
And give their lives to save his dearer own?
5. All these Relation-crosses are in vain,
Now in his Person give him pain,
Strike him with diseases sick.
His sides with aches prick.
Do but touch him to the quick,
Do but break a bone,
And then your servant will not stick
To talk unto you in another tone:
6. Why, then descend
(Replied the Deity)
Thy rage upon his body satisfy;
Let him no pain escape, no penalty
Which does not unto Life extend:
7. With that away the Great Destroyer went
To all the World to show
What angry Fate can do,
Where-of he had leave to be the Instrument,
He entered Job at every pore,
All over his body nasty boils he spread,
He covered him with scurff from foot to head,
His flesh he mangled, and his skin he tore,
That rags of both the wretched Uzzite wore,
And where was any thing of him there was a sore;
8. Hard by into a heap much rubbish grew,
Hither the servants broken vessels threw,
Hither the house its filth did vent,
Down upon this heap Job fell
And took some potsherd, stick, or dirty shell
Wherewith to scrape off that vile stuff he meant
Which inward venom to his outward parts had sent:
9. And then out came his wife, and thus began,
What ails this everlasting Puritan?
As godly now as at the first!
Come, curse this God of thine, for when he is cursed
He can but kill thee, let him do his worst:
10. Ah silly soul! (replied he)
These words are fit indeed for thee,
Thou like to those of thy own sex do speak
Who are in judgment as in body weak;
I know you will confess
We 're to express
Our Thankfulness
For that estate which Heaven has sent,
And, are we not to be content
When it calls in the sums it lent,
And we are of our goods bereft?
Is God all right hand? has he not a left?
Thus was Job all along
As to profane expressions dumb;
Nothing but what might Pat'ence-self become:
11. Now over all those parts the rumor run
How the rich Uzzite was undone;
And thereupon alarumed by fame,
Eliphaz did from Teman- town descend,
Bildad from Shuah Southward came,
Zophar from Naamah did Eastward tend;
These did to one another send
To come and first condole, and then cheer up their friend:
12. Who, as they did before 'um look
And notice of the forlorn Creature took,
They could him not for their acquaintance own,
This Job to them being quite unknown,
He was in such a piteous case,
So disfigured was his face,
That it extorted from 'um many a groan;
Then, each man tearing his Imper'al gown,
Dust upon their heads they threw
Having heaven in their view,
And on the dunghill with their friend sat down;
13. Sev'n times arose the unregarded light,
Sev'n times it yielded to the silent night,
While they that silent night did imitate,
His grief by words not seeking to abate,
For they despaired ever to assuage
His Melancholy rage,
It new was grown s'immeasurably great.
III.
1. JOb at length his silence brake,
2. And thus he spoke
Cursing the time of his nativity,
3. That day, oh that unlucky day (quoth he)
Where-in her son my mother bore!
Oh, may it be a day no more;
And oh! that fatal night
Where-in the Plastic power began
To shape what I was made of into man,
May it for ever be forgotten quite:
4. May darkness seize that day,
May God there-in his influ'nce stay,
May heaven dart there-on no ray:
5. If there-in the Moon
Herself with lucid azure shall adorn,
May her robe be torn,
Or stained with spots astonishingly dark,
And may Death set thereon her dismal mark;
If the light should dare to rise,
May't all-beclowded never reach humane eyes;
If ever day was justly called the Black,
May this of that is unfortunateness nothing lack:
6. Let that dark night be darker yet;
Let him which the Errata shall correct
Which in the Solar year he may detect,
Those four and twenty hours neglect;
And he that shall the Lunar year new-set,
Oh let him that unhappy time forget:
7. Let all men there-in Hermits be,
Let 'um take no pleasant walk,
Let 'um have no cheerful talk,
But banish all Sociability:
8. You who your misfortunes rue,
And Tragedies out of true Story frame,
You who against Time declame,
Here Is a fit subject, a fit theme for you:
9. Let that day's stars, if culminant they grow,
Leave their shine below;
Or, if their rays behind them will not stay,
Let 'um (as some have fondly thought they do)
Beams emit of a sable hue;
Let heaven that light which is my birth-day's due
Bestow upon the Northern world's short day:
And when men think the dawn is near,
Sun, come not nigh this Hemispshere,
But see thou shun
From our Horizon the eighteenth degree,
That must a new Tropic be,
And thou at sight thereof must backward run:
10. This I desire, this I Will have done,
'Cause that day hindered not my fathers wife
From traveling with me her son,
Nor me from entering into so sad a life:
11. Why was I safely hither hurld?
Why went I not, as to this world
Out of the belly of my mother,
So out of this into another?
12. Woe worth the time I had my nurses hug;
Woe worth the time I had my mothers dug;
Had one never set me on her knee,
Or the other never suckled me,
13. I had been quiet now, and found ever this
That Summum Bonum, that eternal bliss
Which weary Sophists seek in vain;
Into a sleep I had been cast,
I should have slept so fast
As never to have been wak't with any kind of pain:
14. These had my compan'ons been,
On one side some great Potentate,
On that side some Chief Minister of State,
Here one styled Wise, there one styled Great,
Who made the day, yet cared not to be seen;
But to anticipate
That happiness which death would bring too late,
From all mankind did separate,
Some place of retirement got,
Prepared some Grot,
Some unknown cell
Wherein alone to dwell,
And there the world forgot,
Bidding her when she smiled most, Farewell:
15. I had at rest with Princes lain
Who had been each the Landlord of a Mine,
Whose grounds were famous for the Silver-vein,
Whose Courts did with that metal shine:
16. I had been like that too too forward breed
Whose life (as 't were) before begun was past,
Who 'nto this world made too much haste,
And accordingly did speed;
Who what Light is did never know.
Nor what those evils are which Light does show:
17. I should have been where Trouble never appears,
Where no Tyrant domineers,
Where people cease their fears,
Not caring for his Instruments nor him
Where Is case both for the heavy heart and weary limb:
18. Who into dungeons were prisoners cast,
There find their Liberty at last;
There they are no more oppressed,
No ruffling Jailer there disturbs their rest;
19. There worthless Peasants be,
And there be men of Dignity,
There Servants from their Masters free
Enjoy an Age of Jubilee:
20. Why does the Light arise
And look at one that is plunged in misery?
Why do they breath at all
With whom to sigh's to breath,
Who do their restless souls to heaven bequeath,
Their bodies to the earth beneath,
Whose spirits have surfeited on grief, are drunk with gall?
21. Who earnestly do their dismiss'on crave,
But what they beg for cannot have;
They dig as if rich oar they would find,
But the only thing designed
Is to prepare themselves a grave;
22. Whose life has in it this only joy,
That death that life is coming to destroy:
23. Why do thou shine on him, imprudent day,
Who by thy light cannot find his way,
But must t'eternity in prison stay;
I am shut in by Providence,
This is her Labyrinth, and I shall never get hence:
24. With cruel groans my fast I break,
Tears my mornings draught I make;
So do I roar,
That with their noise to fright the Egypt'an shore
The Cataracts from me example take:
25. With petty enemies I Have fought,
And was against them as fortunate as stout;
But sure Destruct'on now has found me out;
And where I was least able to resist,
At that part she has aimed, and has not mist:
26. I never did presume
To place my safety in a wall,
Or trust for rest unto my bed of plume;
He was my strength, my rest, my all,
And yet see into what a case he lets me fall:
IV, V.
1, 2. IF we the point should undertake,
If we (quoth Eliphaz) should answer make
Would you not grieve?
However, with or without leave,
Let your heart or hold or break,
We cannot contain our selves, but needs must speak:
3. Thou help'dst the weaker head to understand,
Thou helpd'st to work the weaker hand;
4. Into the dying man of soul berest,
Thou breath'dst a piece of thine, as 'twere,
Thou taught'st those knees their bulk to bear,
Which Sense and Motion had left;
5. But yet what thou deserv'dst, is come at last,
It Is come, and all the strength thou have
Cannot the force thereof endure;
It Is come and brought along with it thy distress,
6. This it is to be so safe, so sure,
So confident, and so secure;
This it is to fancy a fine Right'ousness:
7. Go, ask the Sun if he did ever see
Goodness co-subjected with misery;
Or if the Sun
When such a thing begun
May be suspected to have hid his face,
Time in anc'ent records trace,
And see if ever an unhappy end
Did on a holy life attend:
8. I in my time have seen
They that plow vice, they that sow sin,
The fruits thereof at harvest gathered in,
And answerable to the seed the crop has been:
9. But breathed upon
They Are gone and gone;
God blasteth them, and that they sow,
That neither does to full perfect'on grow:
10. The fiercest Lions roaring voice,
I^ proves but an empty noise;
The lusty Lion in his vigorous youth
Has much ado
His meat to chew
With scarcely half a tooth;
11. While the decrepit one
Often pines away
For want of prey,
His kind provider being gone;
And the stout old ones whelps about are thrown:
12. Now I Will communicate what I have found,
I found it though I know not where,
It gently brusht my ear
Like to some Eccho's just expiring sound:
13. About the time when Mortals on their beds
Strange apparitions spy,
And their affrighted eye
Awakes their heads;
When fancy's high, thoughts are as deep
And thereunto proport'on keep,
When sense is fast locked up by sleep;
14. A Vis'on made me fear, it made me shake,
It made my dislocated bones to quake;
15. A thing did pass
Before my face
Some Incorpor'al Substance 'twas;
At the unus'al fight
My hair grew stiff and stood upright;
16. Its mot'on seemed to gull my eye,
Afterward it fixed stood,
But that would do no good,
I could not yet its shape descry,
Something indeed I saw confusedly;
Heaven and Earth and all in them was still,
At last these words my ears did fill,
Words formed in the air,
And to my apprehension these they were;
17. What? will the stream
Absurdly dream
Of being purer than the Fountain is?
Will frail mortality
More just than the Creator be?
Will miserable man contend with bliss?
18. The Officers which in his Court did move,
Some were unwise, some did unfaithful prove
And basely from their station fell,
They had no arts,
They had no parts,
Or if they had, they used 'um to rebel;
God would not trust them who he knew
Would much weakness show,
And be to him and to themselves untrue,
19. Much less can he put any trust
In men who live in kindred dust,
Whose houses rot and slide away
Being founded but on clay,
And whom moths animated feathers slay;
20. On those that rose in health and ease
Noontide distempers seize;
O'r whom the midday dangers pass
A sure destruction at night does fall;
And, like white-powder in the hollow brass,
They Are light, go out, and make no noise at all:
21. Their glorious youth must yield to age,
Their noble souls like those which we
Brand with Irrationality
Must one day take their leave of their spruce earthly cage.
1. GO make a noise unto the rising Sun,
Let the hereabout so Sacred Fire
First hear and then accomplish thy desire,
To Angels or men now Immortal run;
Which of 'um all
When thou do call
Will free thee from the torturing gout?
Which save thy tooth from being taken out?
Which will the stone within thee break?
Which cause thy head no more to ache?
Which cause thy Palsie-arm no more to shake?
2. Their healing power cannot be so strong
But men more powerful are themselves to wrong;
Angers flame burns up their hearts,
And Envy's canker eats away their inward parts:
3. My self a fool have often seen,
By fool a wicked man I mean,
I Have seen him surely fixed at rest,
Friends, wife, children, meat,
Cattle, goods, estate, and seat,
He had of every thing the best,
And him that heaven blessed I also blessed;
But soon that best was turned to worst,
His sap soon dried,
His root soon died,
And him that heaven cursed I also cursed:
4. As for his luckless progeny,
Where Safety is I cannot tell,
But where it is not know very well,
It Is far, far enough off when they are nigh;
They Are mis'rably pressed out of bre^th,
In the gates built to keep out death
Their ruin they receive,
While no man brings or pardon or reprieve:
5. All that the field
At reaping time does yield
Is made a prey to puny-starv'ling-thieves;
And then for their household stuff,
In comes a vilain bold and strong enough,
And the poor orphans of their goods bereaves:
6. Thistles (I know) not looked to sprout,
Briers from untilled earth spring out;
But sorrows pricks, and cares black thorns,
Soul-wounding crosses,
Undoing losses,
Biting mocks and cutting scorns,
None of these can ever grow,
But what an unseen hand does sow:
7. That fire which the Creator blends
With water, air, and chiefly earth,
To give the sons of Adam birth,
It has no weight and so ascends;
But that wherewith he is pleased to try mankind
It Is very ponderous, we find,
And unto us as to its center tends:
8. You cannot know
By weal or woe
Whether a man be just or no;
Therefore unto a higher Court I fly,
His Verdict shall be past on me,
HE shall be my Referree,
9. Into whose works we cannot see,
Nor comprehend how many, or how great they be;
10. Who does proportionately pour
On every bower
Its proper shower,
And does his universal dew
Over the universal Earth renew:
11. Look any wheel upon,
Observe it and its motion;
The fortune of the World is such;
His finger gives the World a touch,
And there-with-all the lowest spoke ascends.
And there-with-all the highest downward tends:
12. He gulls State-Artists in such sort,
That they of their designs come short;
13. The cur'ous threads of Policy they spin
Prove halters for to hang them in;
The wisest plot of every peevish soul
Sent out from Reasons Capitol,
From thence as from a precipice does headlong roll:
14. Twelve at Midday and twelve at Night
Is all alike to their dull sight,
And they at both those hours are blind;
Nor can they soon
At very Noon
What Is just before 'um find:
15. 'Twas their intent
To seize upon the innocent,
Who by the help of God escape
Their grasping claws,
Their gaping jaws,
16. And so those claws now no more grasp, jaws no more gape:
17. Ah! happy man, who is by God chastis'd!
Such chastisements are not to to be despised;
18. For where he causes it he lays the pain,
He wounds and cures that wound again:
19. If trouble chance six times to rise,
Six times he will deliver thee,
If you are assailed by seven miseries,
Sev'n times invulnerable thou shall be:
20. Thou shall not food for famine be;
The sword when drawn shall not be sheathed in thee;
21. No, thou shall be secure,
And never endure
The lashes of a cruel jeer;
Nor shall Destruct'on ever make thee fear:
22. No thoughts of ruin shall disturb thy ease,
No thoughts of famine spoil thy feasts;
Bears, tigers, wolves shall be no more wild beasts;
Thou the stones shall please,
And much more sense-indued these;
23. The very stones, brute-beasts, and thou
Though seeming diversely compounded now,
Shall make a covenant, and agree
As well as when you were not three,
When yet you were one element,
Ere stones were from their quarry sent,
And thou and beasts from softer earth were rent:
24. Thou and they shall both possess
The self-same happiness;
And there shall only be this difference.
They of their fortune ha'nt a sense,
But thou reflecting on thy peace
Shall make the same increase;
I, thou shall see
Thy palace furnished with prosperity;
It shall be such as thou may glory in,
And yet that glory'ng be no sin:
25. Thou shall see
Thy progeny
Rising, thriving, growing great;
It shall like the grass be seen,
Whose spikes are infinite and color green,
It shall be like the grass in every thing but height
26. Thou thy self thy bough shall lop,
And from the Tree of Life most freely drop,
As now not caring longer there to grow;
And a ripe Wheat-sheaf for thy Crest shall show
Thy mot'on to thy grave was slow:
27. This did we try,
This we found to be no ly,
And therefore under-write Probatum est:
Copy it out, and make thereof your best.
VI, VII.
1. JOb by way of Answer said,
2. Oh that my heavy heart were fully weighed,
And what I suffer in the balance laid!
3. The sand of the sea put in the contrary scale
While this sunk down aloft would rise;
And therefore does my Rhet'rick fail,
For to set forth such grief no words suffice:
4. Poisoned darts from Heaven shot
Into my flesh have got,
These prey upon my vital wet,
And by their numbers I Am beset:
5. Brays the wild Ass
Over his grass?
Does the Ox low
Where he finds fodder grow?
6. Did ever care to eat
Insipid meat
Wherein no borrowed salts corroborate
The otherwise-not-tastable innate?
The milky Jelly taken from the nest
Ere it is consolidated into flesh,
Can thou therewith make a feast?
Can thou therewith thy hungry self refresh?
7. What I did formerly refuse
Now as my melancholy cheer I choose:
8. Oh that my God would grant what I require!
Oh that he would give me what I so desire!
9. Oh that I might but have my doom!
Oh that he would give his arm full room
To strike me so
As that I may not need a second blow!
10. Would he would show the utmost of his spite!
'Twould be some comfort that I knew the same;
Then I Would defy him and his might;
For why, the holy heavenly flame
Down into my bosom came,
And I have never smothered the light:
What strength have I
From whence any hope to raise?
How terrible a thing is it to die,
That I should lengthen out my days?
12. Am I so strong as if composed of flint?
Or has my flesh brass mixed in it?
13. Am I so silly in your sight
As that to help my self I have no might?
Cannot this brain
Study to rid this body of its pain?
Has wisdom taken from this breast her flight?
14. When a man's unfortunate,
His neighbors should his case commiserate;
But you absurdly cry,
It Is for his high Impiety
He Is justly brought into this sad estate:
15. My nearest kinsfolks most deceitful seem,
When I on my relat'ons look,
Methinks they are like the failing brook,
They Are like the waters of a shallow stream;
16. All over whom an icy cover grows,
And when that cover once does crack
The treasuries of snow it did enclose
Are not so white as they are black:
17. In summer they boil quite away,
The sultry air their water drinks,
Or into the earth their water sinks
Not able to endure the scorching day:
18. They Are from their wonted channel gone,
Themselves have lost the tide,
So faintingly they glide,
And are so strangely dried
As if they would suffered an annihilation:
19. The Temanites with thirst and mot'on burned
Thitherward for refreshment turned,
The Sheba-Merchants thought
To borrow thence a cooling drought,
20. But ah! in what confusion they stood
Seeing instead of water mud,
And a large furrow for a flood;
They could not find what they desired,
But like so many fools retired;
Brim-full of hope they came,
But they retreated back as full of shame:
21. Just such Comforters are ye;
Ye dare not, now my fall ye see,
Own me in this my misery:
22. Did I bear for my Motto, Give?
Did the rewards I gat
Diminish that
On which my neighbors were to live?
23. Was I afraid,
Or ever said,
Oh! yonder comes the Enemy,
For mercy's sake now now lends your aid
And from my dreadful foe deliver me?
24. Instruct me, and I Will silently attend;
Show me wherein I ever did offend:
25. Oh the great power of Rhet'rick! oh its force
But oh the vanity of your discourse!
26. Does your spleen it self prepare
To laugh at what I utter in despair
And carp at words, which are but empty air?
27. Hellward ye tend and dig a pit,
And tumble in poor orphans into it:
And after them your dearest friend
Is forced thither headlong to descend;
28. Therefore pray give me leave,
Mark what it is I say,
And see (as easily you may,)
My words are not intended to deceive:
29. Come, leave this talk, I wish you, I entreat,
Lest at the Grand Sess'ons time
At the Almighty's bar this prove your crime
That you dared thus to take his Judgment sea
Leave off this rash accusing me,
For now I stand on my delivery:
30. Do You find, Sirs, I Have a naughty tongue?
Has my soul lost her taste to judge of right and wrong?
1. IS there not set a certain day
Beyond the which I shall not stay,
But must away
Out of this worlds tempest'ous Ocean,
And make into Eternity's calm bay,
Live I not here like to some Journy-man?
2. Servants long for the approaching night,
Their Flower turns only to the setting Sun;
Hirelings in that sweet hour delight
Where-in their work's rewarded because done;
3. They wait and wait, I wait no less,
While Time attends Heavens Trav'ller through the Signs,
Days into weeks, weeks into mon'ths it twines,
That empty casket a rich nothing lines,
Whole mon'th-fulls I of Expectation possess:
4. Going to bed, Oh when! oh when! I cry,
When will the morning shine?
When will be drawn the black curtains of the sky.
That so I may draw mine?
Now on my pillowbeir I madly ride,
Now to the beds feet I slide,
Now in the midway Down my self I hide,
Whose every feather proves a wing
And sloth instead of ease new motion bring,
Hither there-on I fly, thither I spring,
Forward I jerk and back again I fling;
While through twelve glasses Time away does slide,
For every sand that rolls I change a side;
Now on my left I lie, now on my right;
Till the Eastern heaven blushes at th'unseemly sight:
5. The Silkworms out of their rich store
Served me before,
Their bowels neatly wove I wore,
But now that stock is done,
Those nasty ones which we so loath
Into a covering for me are spun,
Whom dirt and they but dirt inliv'ned cloth:
6. The shuttle moves not o'r the loom
Faster than my short days never to return consume:
7. Consider that my breath is but a blast,
The good allotted me is past
And I my eye on more shall never cast:
8. They who have notice of my glory took
No more shall see
Or that or me,
He must put on Invisibility
Whom thou do into nothing look:
9. The clouds that once are rarifi'd
In the air no more shall ride,
No more so re-condense as to be spied;
And he who once has died,
Who once in's grave has lain
No Resurrection shall gain,
Shall never shake off that Earth which does his body hide:
10. His house and he
No more shall one another view,
Nor have an opportunity
Their old acquaintance to renew:
11. Therefore my lips must move, they cannot refrain,
I Will speak, or (if you will) not I,
But this my bitter Agony;
My soul shall from the rack, as 'twere, complain:
21. Princes sometimes build forts along the strand
The under-rolling surges to command,
And Mariners observe the Whale
Which way that floating Isle does sail;
Am I this, or am I that,
That I Am so strictly looked at,
And of a watchful guard must never fail?
13. Thus have I often repined,
And what to do have mused as often,
My silks (thought I) and dounes are soft,
The ease I cannot elsewhere in them I Will find:
14. But as soon as I Am a-bed,
In the upper Reg'on of my Head
Such Met'ors fly
As my beholding fancy terrify;
That which has no shape I see,
That which has no voice I hear,
I make what neither was not is appear;
No things so fair their being owe to Thee,
But quite as ugly ones owe theirs to me,
I give to new Hobgoblins entity,
And then my own creatures fear:
15. So that methinks upon the fatal Tree
Grows all delight and true Nobility,
And it is far better not to be than be:
16. Life! the only thing I hate,
The only thing I fear will end too late;
Far be it from me, Propit'ous Fate,
To be s'unfortunately fortunate
As to meet here with an Eternal state:
Therefore forbear to comfort me,
For t'ent a life I lead, but vanity;
This Time it is but a not'on, but a toy
Incapable of true substant'al joy:
17. Lord, how has man such favor won
That he should be placed so high,
Even on the top of the Creation?
What Is he that he should be so much set by?
18. Why should Thou visit mortals thus
As often as Light this Hemisphere does climb?
Or what are we, that Thou should fill up time
With new Experiments concerning us?
19. When will thou hide thy frighting brow,
Dispatch those wrinkles, send away that frown,
One lucid Interval to me allow,
One moment but to let my spittle down?
20. Ah! I have broke thy Laws,
I have transgrest indeed;
What shall I do? how shall I plead?
Oh thou the Universal Cause
Both Procreative and Conservative,
By whom we were at first, and still do live:
Hark, hark,
Methinks I hear the whizzing dart;
It tends directly to my heart;
Ah! wherefore make thou that thy mark,
That my existence is my smart?
21. Rather wipe out, wipe out my score,
Remember my transgressions no more;
For I am going under ground
Where I a long nights sleep shall have;
To morrow I shall not be found
If fought for any where but in the grave.
VIII.
1. WIth that the Shuhite made reply,
How long intend you at this rate to speak?
How long for words shall tempests from you fly?
3. Does Heaven the course of Justice break,
And cease to be a Court of Equity?
4. If your jov'al girls and boys
That sat down innocent did nocent rise,
Must God accept your Sacrifice
Or be unjust if Sinners he destroys?
5. If thou did follow Morning-pray'r,
And call betimes upon the Deity,
6. If thy Act'ons blameless were,
He Would wake and rise, and act for thee,
And to thy Virtue and Prosperity,
This should as well as that thy Inmate be:
7. Thy stock, though at the first 'twere never so small,
Ere very many years be over
Should differ from what 'twas before
As much as they from beggars differ that have All:
8. Go, search into Antiquity,
See what discoveries our Sires have made;
(9. For but of one days-standing we
Of nature can but little see;
Our Life not only for'ts uncertainty
But also for its darkness seems a shade;)
10. The Fathers sage instruct'on will impart,
And, as if Souls like Lamps could meet
And kindle one at the others heat,
Send knowledge from their own into thy heart:
11. You cannot find rushes where no mire is found;
The flag will not grow except in moorish ground;
12. Which when 't has to some Verdure grown
It soon preventeth being mown;
(The fittest plant to be
The Emblem of Mortality!
It is so quickly up, so quickly down;)
13. So shall Relig'ons cheats decay
Who whom they seem to serve remember not,
Forgetting him themselves shall be forgot;
Their Hopes shall die and fade away;
14. What ever they trusted in
Shall quite consume;
Webs of Hope these Spiders spin,
But there is a brush, but there is a broom:
15. The Sinner on his house himself shall cast,
But all in vain,
For why, it shall not his weight sustain;
But, when he holds it fast,
Slide through his grasping hand and never last:
16. He is so green, that the beholding Sun
Wonders to see what his own rays have done,
His garden-slips as bravely show;
17. His roots well-earthed thither run
Where stones in subterran'ous quarries grow:
18. But now if God the wretch dethrone,
And make him from his Palace fly;
And strip him of his Majesty,
His Highness Court its Master will disown
And swear that such a one there-in was never known:
19. This is the Sinners sad Catastrophe,
This is that he nicknames mirth;
Thus must he removed be
To make more room upon the Earth
To give his coming Successors a birth:
20. But take it from me
The Right'ous Deity
Will never Virtues friends despise;
Those that are Virtues enemi^s
He will as little patronize:
21. If thou art once truly his
He from his service will thee not dismiss,
Until all thy Grief be gone
And Laughter to that Grief succeed,
Till Joy in thy each look we read,
And thy each word's an Epinicion:
22. Who malice toward thee express
They shall shortly blush all over,
The palaces of wickedness
Shall be a little while, and after that no more.
9, 10.
1. JOb soon retorts, the Shuhite stopping here,
2. All you have said is very true;
But can you me the method show
My self at Gods tribunal how to clear?
3. If he once be severe,
If he accuse a man ten thousand times,
That man cannot so just appear
As t'answer one of those ten thousand crimes:
4. He has great wisdom his great strength to wield:
And what foolhardy foes
Did him in battle ever oppose,
And not with disadvantage leave the field?
5. He teaches Mountains motion,
Though no Soul Sensitive that motion guides;
They Are soon dismounted when he chides,
And down into the filling Valleys gone:
6. Out of her place (now Planet-) Earth he shakes;
At his approach her very Basis quakes:
7. If he forbid no Sun can rise,
If he forbid no spangles deck the skies;
8. It Is he, it is only he
That wrought the spreading Azure Canopy,
He only can tread water in the Sea:
9. He placed that Lamp betwixt the Bawters thighs;
He bad the Starry Giant rise
He made the glor'ous Seven;
And he adorned those stately Galleries
Of the Antartick Heaven:
10. His works we cannot fathom they are so great;
We cannot his miracles enumerate:
11. Perchance he passes by just here;
Yet can I not discern him though so near;
There he may go, and yet not to my sight appear:
12. When he intends men's goods to take away,
Who can withstand his rude design?
Who dare rise up and say
Why medlest thou with what is none of thine?
13. If (fur'ous once) he will be fur'ous still,
Self-saviors must soon submit,
And ridd of their Ambitious fit
Confess 'twas wind not substance did their bottles fill:
14. Much less may I pretend my self to purge,
And studied arguments most stoutly urge:
15. Had I obtained Purity,
Yet from that Purity I Would fly
Unto his Mercy-seat, and there for mercy cry
16. If I had prayed, and he had smiled,
Yet should I not have Faith ever to believe
He did me with a smile receive,
But rather thinks some dream had me beguiled:
17. My vessel's in Afflict'ons tempest broke;
And causelessly I Have many, many a stroke:
18. He will not let me breathe pure Air;
For Air I suck in anguish and despair;
19. He is Omnipotent as to his Power,
In doing Justice so exact
That I even tremble at that hour
When I must own my sin, and answer for the fact:
20. Which when I go about to do,
My words will call themselves untrue;
When I seem perfect to my flattering eye
My tongue will give my eye the lie:
21. Could I to full perfect'on rise,
I Would not my self too highly prise,
I would my self my own so useless life despise:
22. It Is a sad truth, but such as I Will maintain,
He lets the Good and Bad alike be slain:
23. When to chastise the World he does prepare,
When men by Death arrested are
Before they are aware,
When his great Trial-Furnace none does spare,
But Golden ones too tumble in
Who have in them no dross of sin,
It makes him sport to see them glowing there:
24. H'has given all to Cain's posterity,
The Earth is their own large Elysium;
People for Justice to their Judges come,
There Is never a Judge can see
How to do Equity,
For why, he hoodwinks and he muffles 'um;
If he is Existent any where it must be he:
25. The flying Post is by my days out flown,
Let him ride never so fast
They make more haste;
But of them all there is never a feasting one;
26. As well built ships when under sail
Along the billows glide, away they glide;
As Eagles when their meat does fail
Cross the Air swiftly slide, away they slide:
27. If I begin once in a jolly tone,
What folly's this to sit and groan!
Hence, ye distracting cares, be gone;
Hence, Melancholy, sad complexion,
I Am now for the Sanguine merry one:
28. When thus my griefs before me stand
Rendesvouz'd but to disband,
With thoughts thereof my mind I dare not trust,
Because I know thou wilt not account me Just:
29. Though that I am, Just is plain,
For why else should I talk in vain?
30. Though I should bathe my self in melting snow,
Though never so clean my hands should grow,
31. He would unwhiten me anon,
Into the mire he would me throw,
He would besmear and dawb me so
That my own clothes should scorn to be put on:
32. For I am I, and He is He,
I nothing, He Infinity,
Nor can I Plaintiff, He Defendant be;
33. Nor can I any Umpire see
Whose hands should join and make us both agree,
This being laid on him, and that on me:
34. If he would lay aside his rod,
If to his rage obnox'ous I
Did not under Duress lie,
If he would be a loving God;
35. Then you should see, I would be bold,
I Would quickly talk to the purpose then; but hold
1. I Long to hear it said from heaven Die,
I long to word my deep anxiety,
And now, what ever s the shame,
What e'r's the blame,
I am resolved to word the same,
And keep proport'on to my Agony;
2. I Will even unto my Judge, and make request
That he would not yet sentence pass,
I Will ask what misdemeanor 'twas
Which stirred him up with me thus to contest:
3. Is It fitting thou should tyrannize?
Or is it proper (Righteousness) for thee
When Varlets dev'llish plots devise
To turn thy face to them, thy back to me?
4, 5, 6. Do carn'ous tunicles fill up thy eyes?
Are thy days measured by the winding Sun?
Does thy Eternity in glasses run?
Or see thou objects Decussat'on-wise?
Art thou in Durance or in Sight like us
That thou need'st to observe my failings thus?
7. Of my Integrity thou do not doubt,
Thou know it is for no sin of mine
I fall into those hands of thine
Out of which they that once fall in shall never get out.
8 Nature seems to be thy Art,
One of whose Masterpieces Men am I;
Thou gav'st me matter, color, symmetry;
And now thou spoilest what thou did impart:
9. Consider how thy hand to give me breath
Small clods of clay together laid;
Will thou unmake what thou have made?
And shall I be again reduced to earth?
10. Did thou not pour me out like milk in th'womb?
Did not thy Rennet make my members come?
11. This flesh I wear
Thou did prepare,
This double skin
Thou wrapp'st me in;
Here stand my bones, my arteries run there;
With those thou have my body fortified,
With these thou have my parts together tied:
12. Alive thou keep'st me, do me favor show;
Thou look to me, and I Am well looked to:
13. All this thou think on often unknown to me,
All this (I Am sure) thou have in memory:
14. If I grow toward such a father rude
Thou mark st it well
And wilt me of my rudeness tell,
And never acquit me of Ingratitude:
15. If I do any thing unjust
I Am sure the penalty to undergo,
Or if I conquer sinful Lust
Yet ha'nt I confidence my head to show:
I do'nt know what I do, I Am at a loss;
Look on my grief, and poise my heavy cross:
16. My Cross does heav'r now, and heav'er prove
Whilst Lion thou do me pursue,
Anon again, thy bowels move,
And Mercy does her miracles renew:
17. Soon after up and down such Symptoms fly
As too too well thy fury testify:
The Springtide thereof rises high;
God fights against me with variety:
18. Was it for this that I was born?
Was it for this my mothers womb was torn?
Was it for this she underwent such pain,
And groaned some hours, and then rejoiced again,
That I my self all my life long might mourn?
Oh that I but once had cried!
Oh that I in my Nurses arms had died!
19. Oh that I had never been seen!
Then I had been and yet not been,
I h'd found a bur'al in my mother Earth
As soon as the other ever had gi'n me birth:
20. The days which I have yet to see
How scarcely worth the numbering they be!
Then give me room to draw my breath,
And sing a little just before my death;
21, 22. Before I go unto that boundless shade
Where there is no Mot'on Retrograde,
Before I go into that darksom dale,
Before I sink into that deadly vale,
Where Order is Confusion,
And Night eternal muffles up the Sun.
XI
1, 2. THen up stood the Naamathite,
And, Shall Not we all these words with words requite?
Shall Not we, quoth he, this prating fool indite?
3. What? shall your Auditors dispense
With Falsehood backed by Impudence?
Shall Not we take notice of your Pride
Which makes you others so deride,
And with a Medium from thence
Make you those scornful looks in blushes hide?
4. For you appear secure
Both that your Doctrine's pure,
And that your life will Heavens test endure:
5. Now oh that God his lips and heaven would move,
And thee in these thy Reasonings disprove!
6. Oh that he would his Wisdom show
In its every mystery,
Whereof thou only half do see!
In the mean time I Would have you know,
His wrath is short of thy Impiety:
7. Can thou the full Dimensions take
Of the Great All in all?
Can thou of him a Definition make
Which shall be Essential?
8. His works as high as heaven swell?
What thereof can thou tell?
They reach below the lowest hell;
What thereof can thou spell?
9. The Length thereof is more
Than by Earths Axis can be measured;
The Breadth thereof exceeds the space that is spread
'Twixt Ez'on-gaber and the Ophir shore:
10. If he by sword or sickness Thousands slay,
If Myr'ads in fast hold he lay,
Bundles of life suppose he throw away,
Who can him in his fury stay?
11. He knows, he knows our vanity,
He sees how impious we be;
And w'ont he make use of what he does see?
12. A whimsy it is possesses some,
That they will needs be thought Prudential,
Although into the world they come
As silly Colts from the wild Asses fall:
13. If thy heart upward rise,
Thy Index-hand still pointing to the skies;
14. If what was faulty yester-night
This morning's Reformat'on right;
And no uncleanness in thy lodging lies;
15. Thou shall show thy honest face,
And challenge Physiognomy
Any thing there-in to descry
Which she can construe unto thy disgrace;
Thou shall be nobly bold,
And shall not fear to be controlled:
16. For thou shall former misery forget;
In new Joys Oc'an that absorp't shall be;
As any petty Rivulet
Is in th'adjoyning vast Arab'an Sea:
17. The glor'ous Sun when Culminant
Shall much of thy splendour want,
And when he rises and first visits us,
Himself shall look like thy Parelius:
18. Confidence always is secure,
And thou shall on just grounds be confident,
Walls thou shall build, but not thy self immure,
Building them not for Strength but Ornament:
They Will only serve thy Art or State to show;
For when thou go to sleep,
Providence the Guard shall keep
And Safeties-self shall be thy bedfellow;
Thou shall no Alarm hear,
Thou shall no Scalado fear;
Nothing shall disturb thy rest
But some unseasonably-made request:
20. While the great Patrons of Impiety
They shall be blind as to prosperity,
That they never shall epsy,
But Ruin they shall see too nigh,
And have this only comfort left, They can but dye.
12, 13, 14.
1. YEs, by all means, (Job replies)
2. Take you away, and where is the Wise?
When you die Art and Knowledge dies;
3. But stay, I have my understanding too,
I have as well indu'd a soul as you;
Who could not tell all this you have said was true?
4. Just persons have Heaven open to their cry,
Yet their bold neighbors at their prayer mock;
You're some of these, and one of those am I;
You make a holy Saint your laughing stock:
5. A man that is under God's afflicting hand
People will slight
As Seamen do the Directing Light
When in a dark tempest'ous night
They find themselves arrived safe on Land:
6. Thieves live in stately Palaces
And those which heaven seemed to scale
God cannot choose but bless,
And see that their provis'on never fail!
Ask now the Oxen in the stall,
Inquire of the inhab'tants of the Air,
Consult with this gross earthy Ball,
On the Sea's scaly people call;
Beasts, birds, earth, fishes will these things declare;
9. Who of all these does not well understand
The World was made by that Almighty hand
10. Which the Repository is of Souls;
And all our breaths within its hollow holds?
11. Han't words their Judge as well as meat?
Does not the ear
Try what we hear
As well as the Palate what we eat?
12. In failing bodies thriving souls are found,
The hoary head is with Pan-laurels crown d
13. God is the Strong, the Knowing one;
What Is to be done can best by him be shown:
14. None can rebuild that Citadel
Which once at his commandment fell;
Whom he confines unto their Cell,
The wall's so high, they cannot get o'r,
So thick they cannot through it bore,
But must therein for ever dwell:
15. He bids the waters cease to roar,
And they away in silence dry;
Out at his sign again they fly,
And bear along with them the shore:
16. To be Wise, and to be Strong,
Unto his nature do belong;
Legerdemain's chief Masters he commands
And likewise those who lose by theft;
The gulled, the guller, both are in his hands,
That in his right, this in his left:
17. He takes and rifles Counselors of State,
Judges he does infatuate;
18. The reins he wresteth from the Magistrate,
And makes them draw who in the Royal char'ot sat:
19. He seiseth on and plunders mighty Kings;
And o'r great Princes Epinic'ons sings:
20. He strikes the confident Declamers dumb
That they cannot finish their Exordium;
Those that are wise men by their age
He turns their Understanding into Rage:
21. Princes into contempt he brings;
And makes puissant Warr'ours puny things:
22. He through the Ocean of Darkness wades,
And fetches thence what lay hid there;
Thither he sends enlightened air
Where Death sits Queen in her eternal shades:
23. His blessing makes the Nat'ons multiply,
Anon he cuts 'um off as fast;
He gives 'um room wherein at ease to lie,
And recontracts that room at last:
24. That unto which a Man does owe
His being so,
That which when it is once ceas't,
The Man turns Beast,
He takes from him who the Worlds scepter swa
And, where there is no Inhabitant
But Wildness, Solitude, and Want,
Where passengers never come because they cannot,
Thither he sends him out to grase:
25. Barons, Dukes, Emp'rors of their way do miss
For which they all be-nighted feel,
And like those to whom Wine bad ballast is
Up and down they rudely reel.
1. THis I my self have seen, I Have heard it too;
If I know ought, I know all this is true:
2. I understand as much as you can do,
You Have taken no Degree which I cannot claim;
Our Faculties by Nature are the same,
And I Have improved mine as well as you:
3. To change some words with God is my intent;
Fain would I urge to him one argument:
But you! you're even Practitioners in lies,
Mere Conscience-quacks whom no body will prize:
W'ud you would hold your peace at length!
That would be your wisest way;
6. Mind my discourse, and wherein lies its strength,
And hear what the Defendant has to say:
7. Will you for that God who so holy is
In so profane a fashion contend?
Will you the God of truth defend
With such sophistry as this?
8. Will you on purpose judge amiss
That so the conquest may be his
Who is so Great, and the best rewards can send?
9. Wilt make for you that he should find you out?
For such your dealings now with him appear
As men do men you your Creator jeer;
This seems Offic^ousness, but it is a flout:
10. He Will punish you for partiality
Although the person you accept be he:
11. And can his Light and your weak eyes agree?
Can y'unastonished such Glory see?
12. Come, all these stories which you call to mind,
So little use they serve unto,
Your words like ashes in the air you strew;
Your bodies seem to be but bits of clay conjoined:
13. Silence a while, Sirs, and give way to me;
For I must speak what ever the issue be:
14. What makes me mad-man-like my flesh to gnaw?
What makes me ready on my self to draw?
15. Well, though in running thither I Am undone,
Into my Makers arms I Will run
But it shall well appear that I am pure;
16. Down into his bosom I will lie secure,
Who cannot the sight of hypocrites endure:
17. My Manifesto hear attentively,
And whether what I says to the purpose try;
18. Ready to plead with any here stand I,
I Am sure my self fully to justify;
19. Send me out some disputing enemy,
For if I Have none to plead withal I die:
20. And grant me (God) this double courtesy,
And from thy presence I no more will fly;
21. Let not thy rod for ever on me lie,
And don't thou fright me to eternity;
Take off thy dreadful vizard, hold thy hand,
22. And what thou will demand of me,
I shall not fear to answer thee,
Or Answer thou to what I shall demand:
23. Let me my misdemeanors see,
How many and how great they be,
Acquaint me with their Either Quantity:
24. Ah! wherefore do thou turn away thy face,
And count me one of thy Antagonists?
25. Will thou take with an Aspen-leaf the Lists?
Is the dry stubble worthy of thy chase?
26. For thou prepar'st against m' a long black bill;
That is not past which I thought past;
A note of my youth-sins thou have,
Which on my conscience thou urgest still:
27. Fast in the stocks my self I feel,
And thou thy Spies where ever I go do lay;
My feet are locked in heavy steel,
The marks whereof appear upon my heel;
28. And thus poor Job like dirt consumes away,
Or like the cloth which moths have made their prey.
1. WHo-e'r he be that is of a woman born,
If his Lands be well survay'd
He Will find 'um bearing naught but thorn,
He Will find his Lease but for few years is made;
2. Like Flowers he sprouts up, like them he does fade,
And quickly flies away as flies the shade:
3. Deignest Thou then to look on me?
Will Thou with Job commence a suit,
And must I go to Law with Thee?
4. What? evince his purity
Who Is utterly impure! there is none can do 't:
5. Frail Man! his time is set, alas;
Thou know the minutes of his glass;
The Months that Heaven gives
Those Months indeed he lives,
But never can beyond that number pass:
6. Let him alone, that he may take some ease;
E're Death, when is work is done, the hireling seize:
7. The Tree, whose branches this days Axe does pare,
May again to morrow bear,
May a new bark to morrow wear,
And get fresh boughs, and put on other hair:
8. Though underground the root decay,
Though the stock Age rot away;
9. The scent of water its cold limbs new-warms,
And makes it rear its head, and spread its arms:
10. But man once dead
Does irrecoverably waste;
And who knows whither he is fled
When once h'has breathed his last?
11. The Sea is qnaff't up by the Sun,
And Floods dried up no longer run;
12, So is 't with Man, so down he lies,
No more to wake; no more to rise,
Till at the day of Doom
The shrivelled Heavens consume,
Then he may chance to rub, and open his eyes:
13. Come, I 'le be buried alive,
Into the deepest sea I 'le dive
Where nothing is but Night and Secrecy;
Thither I 'le hie,
And there I 'le lie,
Until Avenging Thou art passed by;
Until thy Anger (like ascending fire)
Growing still less and less at last expire:
Hasten, oh, hasten that sweet day
When thou with Mercy wilt thy-self array,
And (this grim vizard being laid aside)
Thy native colors wilt no longer hide;
And when Thou 'rt pleased such to be
As flesh and blood may safely see,
Forget not then to cast an eye on me:
14. If from this body this foul take her flight,
And I in pieces fall;
Will thou my limbs together call?
Will thou my scattered parts unite?
Strong Hope and never wearied Constancy
Shall carry me through every change and turn,
Till my last change come, my urn;
And then this great Experiment I 'le try:
15. Then Thou to Glory's feast wilt me invite,
And then up I shall start
And go and take place next thy heart,
Thy bosom-darling, and thy souls delight,
Always thy Creature, then thy Favorite:
16. Though now indeed thou art severe,
My Mot'ons are Excentrical
And Thou do calculate them all;
One eye does watch me here, the other there;
17. Thou have a bag for every sin;
This fact Thou seal'st up, that Thou sowest in.
18. That Mountain which so proudly stands,
The boundary of diverse lands,
The Pioneer can crumble into sands
And teach to move;
And, when in them the delver delves,
We find the very Rocks themselves
Of Immobility ill Emblems prove:
19. Drops hollow stones they fall upon;
So sweeps away Thy deluge fertile dust
And all that ever grew there-on,
And thou spoil'st all where-in poor Man does trust:
20. Thou strikest and away goes he
Disposed of to Eternity;
His eyes grow dark, his cheeks grow pale,
Those Di'monds wink, these Roses fail,
And he thus metomorphis'd down does fly:
21. He does not see
The Infamy
Which his posterity incurrs,
Nor hears he of the Honor which they gain;
No, but his Sense endures its proper pain,
His Understanding hers.
XV.
1. THe Noble Temanite replies,
2. This is not handsome (Sir) for one so wise
To give himself to Not'ons such as these,
This is to feed upon an Eastern breeze;
3. Such a one should not this day Method take,
Or such unprofitable speeches make:
4. Thou have so little of the Orator,
Thy Auditors thou car'st not for,
But boldly carry'st on thy speech begun,
Substracting what
Thou add'st too much to that
From thy unperfected Devotion;
Thy Prayer-incense, which of late
Arab'as perfumes did perfume,
Like those gross odours now is taught
To spend with using and consume:
5. That Mouth wherewith thou used'st heaven to greet
Now speaks not ought
But what is naught
Thy Tongue has proved of late an arrant Cheat:
6. I would thee willingly acquit,
But thou by talking thus wilt not permit,
Thou thy own Dirge do sing,
No witness need against thee rise,
It will abundantly suffice
Thy self against thy self to bring:
7. Why, Joh! art thou the Protoplast?
Or (prithee say)
Were thou molded out of clay
Ever this ruff superficies'd ball was cast?
8. Has heaven acquainted you with that Decree
Which had lain hid from all Eternity?
Does wisdom only appertain to thee?
Have thou a grant of the Monopoly?
9. What know thou that we never knew?
What do perceive that we perceive not too?
10. The reverend White upon our heads appears;
Thy father, lived he, would want of our years:
11. We'd have you only own your fault,
And upon true Contrit'ons feet
Step and fetch Comfort from the Mercy-seat;
And is this Comfort proffered ye worth naught?
Have you in Divinity
More skill than we?
And can you even into Gods closset see?
12. Whither away by thy proud heart art born?
Why read we in thy winking eye such scorn?
13. Why d' you (one man) oppose our Common Lord?
Why cannot you better words at least afford?
14. Alas! what is discursive dust
That he should be accounted just?
Where is there now the Eve
A Right'ous Abel to conceive?
15. His greatest Saints God dares not trust;
They and the Heaven they are heirs unto
Are both impure as to his view,
Who in his Saints sees vice, in the heavenly Spangles rust;
16. Much filthy'r 's Man who quaffs Iniquity
17. As does Leviathan the Sea:
17. Harken, and I shall let you understand
(What I my self have seen and understood;
18. What Volumes treat of writ before the flood,
And thence derived down from hand to hand;
And what was held by men as Great as Good,
19. Who had the world at their command;
Whose neighbors never incroach't upon their land;
20. How that the Sinner does in torment live,
And travail with the plots he does devise,
Not knowing how long he has to tyrannise;
21. He hears strange tones and frighting cries;
And when they cease; and he in quiet lies,
He Is set upon by Enemies
Which quarter neither use to take nor give:
22. He quite despairs of scaping those black foes,
Of getting out of those eternal woes
To which, the sword now sending him, he goes:
23. Hungry he grows,
And then to every one he shows
His me^ger face, his hollow eye,
And Oh, some Bread, some Bread's his cry;
The terrible Night-day is nigh,
And that he knows:
24. His sin shall trouble, trouble sorrow bring,
The pangs of both which he already feels;
Fear charges him like some puissant King
With a great Army at his heels:
25. For he has gi'n his Maker the first blow,
And thinks to deal with an Almighty foe;
26. Whom he does therefore fur'ously assail,
Whose very throat he makes at,
Ready but he will come at that
To cut through's thick-boss't Shields and Coats of Mail:
27. Large level valleys of Fat smooth his face,
Mountains thereof his pampered sides do grace;
28. Such to Mankind is his antipathy,
He dwells in towns and rooms from concourse free,
Towns where no man lives but he,
And houses which ever long will rubbish be:
29. His bags, when most, they shall be quickly told,
In their enjoyment he shall not grow old;
H' has got him an estate, but that shall not hold:
30. He shall be cast on that Blind rock the Grave,
Never from thence to launch;
And there the flame no light shall have,
But heat enough to quite dry up his branch;
He shall be blown by the Almighty's b^eath
Below the Center, beyond Hell and Death:
31. It is not meet
Men on themselves should put so great a cheat
As to expect high things from being Vain,
Alas! a Golden Nothing's all they gain;
32. The emolument for which they do so strive
Like an Abortive birth shall thrive;
The Auto-focus shall about 'um move,
But never their branches into green improve:
33. Look on the Sinner as a Vine,
His raw grapes make but sour wine;
Look on him as an Olive Tree,
His flower as soon as such shall cease to be:
34. Death and Destruction shall exercise
New tricks, new fallacies
On the Grand Masters of the same;
Bribes shall not stave off the raging flame
From Palaces which by their heaps did rise:
35. Fond hypocrites believe
They something really conceive,
But this conception at last we find
To be a Tympany, and caused by wind;
They do with Sin
(As 'twere) lie in,
And therefore that which they bring forth
Accordingly must be little worth
XVI, XVII.
1. JOb this sober Answer gave,
2. I Have often seen such thundering Preachers rave,
I Have heard 'um vent upon this head their rage;
Is this the comfort I shall have?
You give worse words than ever they gave,
And you increase the grief you should assuage:
3. Surcease your nonsense-argument;
Methinks you're something confident
So many fond object'ons to invent:
4. If you were I, and I were you,
I could keep a prating too;
I could give words as odd,
I could give as shrewd a nod;
5. I could do so; but would that be discreet?
Sure I should utter what would be more meet;
Each word that from my lips should fall
Should prove a Cordial;
I Would you another story tell,
Every syllable I Would say
Should be a powerful spell
To drive your evil melancholy sp'rit away:
6. Ah me! I cannot attain the rest I seek
Though never so much I speak,
Nor does my sorrow cease
Though never so long I hold my peace;
7 Ah! weary, weary; ah! my spirirs fail,
Thou draw'st them out, and they exhale;
I am left all alone,
Thou fright'st away my friends, and they are flow'n:
8. Thou, Cruel --, with thy heavy plough
Have draw'n these wrinckles on my brow;
Each hollow in my withered cheeks
Abundantly my sad condit'on speaks:
9. I am a proof how man can act the Bear,
How in his fury he can tear;
I such an Enemy have met
As does his teeth on one another set,
Showing them what with me they are to do,
And seems his eyes to whet
Looking me therewith through and through:
10. Men stretch their jaws,
And on me gape,
And against all Civility's known laws
Without a box on the ear I seldom escape;
Worse affronts yet, I fear, they coin;
For lo, into a body now they join:
11. God gives me over to such rogues as these,
They may do with me what they please:
12. My joints he has asunder took
Which lately had such Symmetry,
H' has every limb of me in pieces shook
Unless my neck, perchance, the which he held me by;
And making me the unhappy spot
13. He pours upon me showers of shot,
Whole woods of crooked yew beset me round;
The parts where-in my life lay bound
Are loosly scatter d on the ground;
Here one, and there another rein does fall,
And yonder lies my useless gall:
14. He leaves no member sound,
But gives me blows
Not unlike those
Which on his foes
A Giant when enraged bestows,
And makes my body one continued wound:
15. Sackcloth upon my flesh I bind
And ashes spread
Upon that head
Which with a double White of Age and Glory shined:
16. My face was foul before,
And washing it with tears I foul it more;
While Death as one that did begin
Into my house to enter in
Already stands before my eye her door:
17 And why all this? I do no harm;
I never robbed a town,
And having robbed it, burnt it down,
My hands at such a fire to warm;
My Orphan-gormandizing throat
With an unsanctified note
The holy Temple never yet profaned;
With my infected sheep
Offered because it would not keep
The holy'r Altar never yet was stained:
18. Oh earth, oh earth, find thou a tongue
While I am silent to proclaim my wrong;
And do thou teach
My blood the blood of Abels speech,
That it may cry, and crying heaven reach:
19. I Am righteous in heavens eye,
The stars have seen and know my purity:
20. Scoff then, not Enemy but Friend,
Of a far better friend I shall not fail;
My tears like water Midday-beams exhale
The heavenly towers know how to scale,
And in his bosom dry themselves to whom the ascend:
21. Oh might I be so bold
As this pure hand up at his bar to hold,
And cry Not guilty there and pl^^d
As one man for another at his need:
22. Oh might I! but I wish in vain,
I have not long to stay,
To morrow's Execut'on-day,
And when that comes I must away
Never to return again
Unto my dungeon from whence I Am taken.
1. MY breath does stink, my strength's decayed,
The Sexton also my last bed has made;
2. Death bends her bow, and Jeerers too let fly,
Methinks I have them in my eye
Who do my failing age upbraid:
3. Give me a man that dares to stake,
That in the Chain of Amity
A Link will make,
And forfeit if that Chain he break;
Give me the man that will in earnest be
My other self to me,
And of my mirth and of my grief partake;
4. Dull people will not this mot^on entertain,
Thou will not let 'um be so wise,
Thou will them not such honor deigne
That they should up unto true Friendship rise:
5. He that himself a friend to all will make,
But is not that which he pretends,
His Children they shall seek for friends,
But ever they find out one their eyes shall ache:
6. Ah! He has spun me a hard destiny,
I Am made the But which all men ^it,
The silly thing on whom all try their wit,
As formerly I was their melody
When they their Tabr^t laid aside to play on me
8. What with tear and what with sigh
My eye is grown so dim,
Such little clouds there-in do swim
I cannot see my hand therewith;
Or if I could, I have no hand to see;
There where my hand should be
Hangs a piece of Vacuity;
My hand, and arm, and foot, and thigh, and knee,
Which while vigor through them ran
Had a shadow of their own,
Now that that Vigor's gone
Seem but the shadow of other man:
9. The right'ous soul, that pure and cleanly Dove,
On in his milky path shall move;
And the Arm that never did wrong
Shall be found truly strong,
And shall its strength contin'ally improve:
10. But as for you, I Would have you stay,
Come back, and take another way;
The road where-in so fast you ride
Of that City leads wide
Where Wisdom does her choicest treasures hide:
11. My glass is run,
My work not done;
Death my deep designs prevents,
And my intents prove but intents:
12. I force some few half-hours out of the night,
And by such fires as oil and art
To them that want the Sun impart
Regain the time which lengthened darkness wins from light:
13. If I with hopes of happiness am fed,
For Lodgings a cold Tomb I meet,
And for Tent-cloaths a Winding Sheet,
And go to Darkness when I should to bed:
14. Rottenness I Father call,
If you would my Female-kindred have
Look but about the Grave,
Here creeps my mother, there my sisters crawl:
15. And where is my Hope now? I have none;
Hope to Heaven back is flown;
See! now she lessens, now she is out of sight!
16. I and my fellow-men make haste away,
I from my Zenith hasten, so do they;
And, though we have a diverse Day,
We all at length shall have in the dust the self-same Night.
XVIII.
1. THe Princely Shuhite then begun;
2. When will this long discourse be done?
When will you cease to bawl?
Our turn is come,
You must be dumb;
3. Why are we counted brutish things
Even amidst our Reasonings?
Why look thou on us through a glass
Through which our Spec'es (alas!)
While to thy eye they pass
Must needs be very small,
So small as scarcely to be seen at all?
4. The man's outrageous
To tear himself in pieces thus:
Shall Rightousness her flight to Heaven take
And leave this lower globe
To pleasure Job?
Shall rocks be moved for thy sake?
5. No, no, (my friend) Justice Divine
Shall gloriously shine
Whilst the Sinners day grows dark,
And his dead fire sends forth no glittering spark:
6. The light which round the Universe does fly
Shall be no light his tent about,
His lamp shall sink in'ts socket and go out,
He into's grave shall fall and therein rotting lie:
7. He into streights shall run
Struggle he never so strong therein to stick,
And most unfortunately Politic
Shall be by his own wit undone:
8. He shall by his own traitorous feet be led
Where snares are set,
A crafty net
Where ever he goes shall be spread:
9. The grin shall hold him by the heels
While he the fury of the Rifler feels:
10. Nimrodists along the way
Here shall prepare
For him a snare,
There they a secret trap shall lay:
11. His fancy shall besiege him round
And make him take his feet and fly;
12. Comfort which feeds the soul shall not be found,
But he shall have enough of misery;
13. Misery shall his beauty waste,
And in its flower his manhood blast,
And of Deaths bitter cup he first shall taste:
14. Hope from his Court away shall hie,
Or if it tarry there
Hope it self shall turn to Fear,
And he shall die
The slave of Crowned Cruelty;
15. Despair, Hells Envoy, shall abate his bliss,
And with sulphur'ous streams from that Abyss
Annoy the Palace which is none of his;
Which from a better man he keeps,
And therefore therein never soundly sleeps;
When slumber scarce has closed his eyes
Up he starts, and Treason, Treason cries,
Then down again he lies,
And by and by again must rise,
And rising to another bed he creeps;
But there likewise
Fresh horrors him surprise,
Some dream the Tyrant terrifies,
Every wall strange shapes assumes,
Those pictures of his King he spies
Which hang themselves all round their Masters room;
His feigned fears His real Majesty,
And sees him just approach, and thinks him nigh;
Though he (alas!) through foreign lands does fly,
And with what heaven sends content
Sweetly endures a twelve years banishment,
Does customs, men, and neighboring realms descry,
Making a virtue of necessity;
Till the appointed time be come
For God to call his own Anointed home,
And give his Deputy his own,
For sacred oil up to the top to slow,
For puddle-water to sink down below;
And then, then down the Wretch does go
Not from the Coach-box but the usurped Throne;
16. Neither his root nor branch shall thrive;
His root that shall be choked below,
His branch so pruned as never to grow;
17. What was his name no verse shall show,
Nor any marble keep his deeds alive;
18. He shall Beings shun with speed
And Light by which he should those Beings see,
And only have the company
Of Darkness and Nonentity;
19. None shall the Father in the Children read,
Nephew or Neice he shall have none
No brothers daughter nor no sisters son,
Nor be immortal in an endless seed:
20. Those cur'ous ones who time and parts abuse,
And will those things and men reveal
Which heaven would conceal,
Finding out him themselves shall lose;
A life so sad,
So strange an end he had,
That his Contemporaries at the sight
Astonished e'n ran mad,
And these shall be in full as great a fright:
21. They who fly away apace
From that which gave 'um feet,
Who though a Deity they meet
In every field, in every street,
Yet they are resolved they will not see it,
Such is their goal, and such is their unresting place.
XIX
1, 2. WIth that, how long, quoth Job, will ye go on
My very heart to tear?
To limb me as it were
With these fierce disputat'ons pro and con?
3. Ten times some biting Irony
In your discourse has taken place;
Nay, you have had the face
To bear your selves like strangers toward me:
4. What if Het'rodox I be!
On me lies that Het'rodoxiety:
5. But since int' other men's affairs you thrust,
And bravely urge an Argument
Only to this intent
To baffle me, and prove I am unjust,
6. I tell you God has my destruct'on wrought,
H' has caught me in his net, and I am caught:
7. I show the world my injury,
But none takes notice of my cry,
I cry yet louder, louder yet,
Yet cannot any satisfaction get:
8. Blocks in the path where I should go he lays,
Nor do I know
Whither or how to go
He does so darken my now Inky ways:
9. He has eclyps'd my glor'ous rays,
And robbed my head of its Imper'al bays:
10. I am beset with misery,
It does me hence and thence accost,
So that whole Job is lost;
There 's no more hope of me
Than of a rotten withered tree:
11. His Anger against me glows,
And he still reckons me among his foes?
12. He musters up his Regiments;
His pioneers raise battlements,
And compass in my tents;
13. Far enough off he all my brethren sends,
I seek in vain my friends among my friends:
14. Such as to me in blood were join d,
Any of them I cannot find;
Such as with me their Friendship-loves combined,
I Am out of sight with them and out of mind:
15. My Inmates and Maidservants on me stare
As on some stranger in an Antic dress,
Some of whom discreetly ghess
I Am dropped from the cold Reg'on of the Air;
One calls me Chaldee, to other Syrian,
A third says I Am some broken Persian,
A fourth, I Am sneak't out of some threadbare Isle,
A fifth dare swear I Am escaped out of the Nile
Half-eaten up by some old Crocodile;
Another viewing my strange hue a while
Whom adust matter and black scurff defile,
Takes me to be an Ethiopian;
I Am sprung from Japhet, Sem, and Ham;
I Am every thing but what I am
The formerly well-known Arabian:
16. My servant seems not for my call to care,
I Am fain to speak my servant fair:
17. My wif^ cannot my breath endure,
There Is nothing can my scornful Lady move;
The living pl^^g^s of our former love
Cannot me a sight of her procure:
18. I am abused by every brat;
I cannot rise but I Am their chat:
19. My bosom friends cannot abide my sight;
My love is recompensed with slight:
20. My flesh, my skin, my bone
Cling all together but disorderly,
Some of my teeth alone
Are to their covering as they ought to be:
21. See, Sirs, what I have undergone,
And show me some compassion,
For God, I Am sure, has shown me none
22. Why do you on your distressed neighbor play
Having unhandsomly presumed
T'intitle God to what you do and say?
My flesh long since is all consumed
And you would make my soul too pine away:
23. Oh that my words, which now 'll prove vain,
Were by a ready writer taken
For ever on record to lie!
Oh that Typography
Which, as the knowing Sophist sings,
Shall be in time found out by Westerlings
Might now be hansell'd with my Threnody!
24. Oh that this were in brass ingravened,
And wrought even in the rock there to be read
In well-set Characters of lasting lead*
25. For on my Sav'our I rely
A Second Person in a Trinity,
I have his Pass'on in my eye,
I ken the top of Calvary,
Hither (methinks) I hear him cry,
Eli, Eli, Lamaschabactany!
I hear him give one groan, and die;
And therefore he endures such pain,
Therefore he groans, therefore he dies,
That I now groaning joy may gain,
And dying I to life may rise;
I see the marks of his dear feet,
They Are plain on s cred Olivet;
There he twice his feet shall set,
There I at last shall my Redeemer meet:
26. Although these eyes are sure to wink,
And like Lamps in their sockets sink
Although Death stop these ears, rot off these knee^,
Although Corruption my body seize,
New Lamps shall in those sockets burn,
Acousticks organs shall return,
My knee shall rise out of their ^rn;
27. I shall have eyes which for themselves shall see,
My Nature clothed with Divinity;
I shall have ears to bear him bid me Come,
Come (Job) into my Kingdom, and thy home;
I shall have better knees, and yet the same
To bow unto that holy Name,
Though time and worms destroy this goodly frame;
28. This (Friends) in brief
Is my Belief,
And We, you should say, it approve,
And therefore need the man no more to more;
Si^^e he has go^
A true and lively faith,
Though outwardly he blosso^ (...)
The heavenly seed within he has:
29. There i^ V^^^^^ti^e Justice, look you to^^,
For wrath with wrath does su^^,
And God with angry one^ and angry he;
You have your sword, and so has he;
You now rashly judge of me,
There Is one in time will judge of thee, and thee, and thee.
XX.
1, 2. I, This, this does my Rhetoric engage,
This forces me in haste to take the stage,
Replied the Naamathite,
3. If I perceived not how you put me to it
I had been mute,
I had not sought your Satyr to confute,
But now I must retort, so deep you bite:
4. You Have often sure of this been told,
For it is as true as heaven and earth are old;
5. Hypocrites, I suppose, you know
Let 'um make never so gay a show
Their triumphs are but pageantries,
As soon as ever it is born their comfort dies:
6. Though Lucifer lend the proud man his pride
And prompt him to do as himself had done,
Teach him t'attempt the Char'ot of the Sun,
Though on the clouds the Sinner ride;
7. Yet never to return he must away,
And be thrown off like his own excrement;
They that enjoyed him the other day
Shall stare about, and say,
Why, whither? whither's our old Crony sent?
8. A dream soon vanishes, and so shall he;
Such a Substant'al Nothing he shall be
As in the empty air by night our fancies see:
9. He that saw him heretofore
Gods banished wretch never again descries;
His house with all her stately window-eyes
Beholds her Master now no more:
10. His children seek the poorest folks to please,
And he gives back all that he did unjustly seize:
11. The youthful Sinner's punished in the old;
Lust which at Thirty was so hot
Makes his bones at Sixty rot,
Which in the grave at length with him grows cold:
12. Though vice delight the palate of his soul,
Though the sweet lumps long in his mouth he roll,
13. Though he fall to and do not spare,
Though he chew the cud (as 'twere)
Being loath quite to let down his dainty fare,
14. His Maw is but a bag of nasty snakes
Which of his meat instead of Chyle it makes:
15. He used on Gold to dine, on Silver sup,
But both upon his stomach lie,
He must refund 'um by and by,
God makes him disimbogue and cast 'um up:
16. That Asps are venomous shall grow a doubt,
For he shall suck their poison out;
He shall leave goods, and wife, and children stung
By the Viper's forked tongue:
17. Lakes shall stand, and rivers grow,
Oceans themselves shall flow
With hony's sweetness, and with butter's fat,
But he shall never enjoy or this or that:
18. He shall restore all he has got,
One crum thereof he swallows not;
He shall Restitut'on make,
And making Restitut'on break,
For all his gain
He by couz'ning did obtain,
And so nothing shall remain
Where-in he full delight may take:
19. Because he has the poor oppressed,
And what another built possessed,
20. His purse shall so quite empty be of g^in
As his wide paunch shall be brim-full of pain:
21. Of all his Chattels he shall be bereft,
There shall so small a st^ck be left
So mean a table and so pit'ous fare
As none shall care
To be designed by Will his heir:
22. When he shall seem with all things to abound
He destitute of all things shall be found;
And he shall be
An Axine Sea,
Exposed to all kind of storms,
Mater'a prima to all luckless Forms:
23. When he sits down to eat
Heaven shall him unkindly greet,
And, when he (poor man!) shall think
His pleasant food
Shall do him good,
Rain down to it a most unpleasant drink;
24. Assailed by his armed foe
In his grim face he shall not dare to look,
He shall fly from the iron bow
But flying shall thereby be overtook:
25. Now, now the dart
Pierces his heart,
And now the weeping Surg'on pulls it out;
Out of his gall
The sword does fall.
Terrors and terrors compass him about:
26. His closset seems Darknesses black ^eat,
He melts away with unblown heat;
And they that in his tabernacle are
Shall fare the worse for being there:
27. In the Stars there shall be writ,
Though not his Fate, his sin that causes it;
Burst clouds above against him shall declame,
Earthquakes bene'th shall thunder out his shame;
Heaven it self shall then tell tales,
And Earths large hollow vales
Shall echo back the sound they thence receive;
28. To his incoming crop
There shall be put a fatal stop,
His goods their Masters falling house shall leave:
29. This is the prize by the ungodly won
This is the port'on God allows his Rebel son.
XXI.
1. JOb returned, Friends, give me leave,
2. Lend me both your ears, I pray,
To what in short I have to say,
Some consolat on thence you may receive;
3. Suspend your scoff
Till I break off,
When I have spoken all
Then be most bitterly Satirical:
4. Do I to mortals make my moans?
Or if I did
What does forbid
But I may so communicate my groans?
5. Mind me, and be afraid,
And let your hands upon your mouths be laid:
6. When to my thoughts these things appear,
And come into my mind afresh,
Horror seizes me and fear,
And Tremulative Motions my flesh:
7. Why have the wicked in the earth a place?
Why live they any, why so many years?
Why still are the As'an Peers
Of the accursed race?
8. Their Children they well settled see,
They see the rooting of their Family;
9. They Are safe enough from any fright,
Nor does the rod
Of an avenging God
Upon their habitations light;
10. Their Bull his like does procreate,
Nor does his generative power abate,
Their Cow comes swelling from her mate,
And never does her calf precipitate:
11. Their pretty Babes in swarms go out,
Their hopeful Children dance about;
12. Timbrels they tune, to harps they sing,
And sweetly finger every string,
The Organ 's drowned with their joyful shout:
13. Long is the life in luxury they spend,
But short the pains that luxury attend;
Deaths feeble dart
Brings but one moments smart,
And there is of them and of their pains an end:
14. Therefore they profanely cry
Fly, Thou Eternal Being, fly,
Fly hence unto thy proper sphere the sky,
We all thy holy ways defy;
15. What Is this Almighty that you talk of thus?
What title has he over us?
If as a Master we shall him obey,
What wages will our Master pay?
If as a Deity we him adore,
What shall we have that we had not before?
16. These wretches what they have they have not,
They'ld use their goods aright but can 't;
Though indeed whether they do or no,
What trade they drive,
What plots contrive
I neither do nor care to know:
17. How often their lamps extinguished
Choked by that oil wherewith it should be fed!
How often they into ruin fall!
On them God no reward bestow;
But sorrows and afflict'ons throws,
For here his Justice is Vindictive all:
18. They 're like the tossed and tumbled leaves
Which every blast of rest bereaves;
They Are like the chaff which from the winnow'd corn
By every puff away is born:
19, 20. Of every wicked word and deed
Record is in heaven taken
To be in time produced again
To the pain of Speakers and of Actors seed;
The Sinner in 's own life may read
How after him his sons shall speed;
A portion of thoughtfulness and care,
Of trouble, and of Fear,
Of killing grief, and of Despair
Such as Almighty fury does prepare
He shall be forced to drink up,
And they shall pledge him in the self-same cup:
21. What Is house and land to him when he wants brea^^,
To what end last they when he is done,
When once his thread is cut short off by death
Whereof one only half was spun?
22. Then think not ever to be Gods Counselor,
For where is the man
So much a Politician
That he dare be so, or can?
Since God abases those which lofty are,
And brings even Judges to his bar:
23. One goes off robust'ously,
And does without anxiety,
Without or care or torment die,
Falling without a Metaphor asleep;
24. His bones, his breasts
No drought infests,
Blood thorough these disguised in white does creep,
And those well marrow'd their due temper keep:
25. Another dying undergoes
As many pangs, as many woes
As a capac'ous soul can feel,
He dies ere he has made one merry meal:
26. Unlike they go to their last bed,
But all alike therein they ^e;
The worms which do their flesh o'rspread
Find in their food no great variety:
27. I know what devilish thoughts within you rise,
I know what lies
Against me you devise,
And how malic'ously you Syllogise;
28. Your argument is this,
The man whose palace is we know not where,
It cannot be found nor here, nor there,
Such a one a Sinner is,
But -- Therefore Somebody has done amiss;
29. Ask any Traveller that, passes by,
He Will prove it to ye unansw'rably,
30. That there is a day, a rec^^^ng day
When sinners still consumed shall not consume;
Now they are secure, but at that day of doom
Then to their trial our come they:
31. There Is none dares undertake
A Tyrant sensible to make
How from Right'ousness he swerves,
There Is none dares handle him as he deserves;
32. Yet shall he to his dust return
And dwell for ever in his u^;
33. He shall find sweetness in the ^lay
With which he must bolow be minded o^^e,
Thousands o^e thither gone before,
And he to Myriads shall lend the way:
34. Therefore (my Friends) your labor spare,
Comforters-would be, pray, forbear;
The he^rt, I see, goes not along
With the dissembling tongue,
One thing you utter here, but mean another there
XXII.
1. ELiphaz then to the company appealed;
2. Can Policy, which may our Fortunes build,
To our Creator any profit yield?
3. Suppose thy thoughts thy words, thy ways be right,
How should this cause his delight?
How should the Deity be richer by it?
4. Will he only gently chide
As fearing for to curb thy stubborn pride?
Or is there any need
He should in Court show thee thy Life-misdeed?
5. Are not thy Vices Cardinal?
Each slip of thine has it not been a fall?
6. Thou took'st Substant'al pawns for trifling ware
Of him who was thy common mothers son;
From him whose rags could scarcely be put on
Thou snatchedst them and made him yet more bare:
7. Thou never did fetch
Water for the thirsty wretch,
The hungry soul thou have not fed;
But when they cried
Have barb'rously denied
The one a cup of drink, the other a crust of bread:
8. But he that had the longest arm,
He that best could Nimrodize,
And higher than his Fellow-mortals rise,
The whole town his house, the whole country was his farm:
9. Widows for thee could not enjoy their own;
Orphans little better fared,
With whom to lose but limbs was to be spared;
10. Therefore where-e'r thou go there lies a snare,
And wheresoe'r thou stay'st there terrors are;
11. Into a dark abyss you are thrown,
And with a flood of misery o'rflown:
12. Does not God sit enthroned on high
In heaven whose every star
Is from our earth so far
That Parallaxes cannot its height descry?
13. He does indeed; thou will reply;
And therefore of what here below is done
I wonder how he should be told,
I wonder how he should my Action
Through Clouds the Quintessence of mists behold:
14. Within those clouds he is confined,
And there he has his work assigned
To be some nobler Orbs Intelligence,
But never or to move or see from-thence:
15. Have thou observed paths of Impiety
Which, if Records are true,
Of old vile Caitiffs used to
16. Whom Time scarce brings unto our memory,
(His sith was sooner on them than his eye)
Whose palace rotted with the blood they shed
And yielded to that undermining Sea of Red;
17. When God arproacht, they entertained him thus,
Be gone (thou useless Deity)
Be more and more Invisible to us,
We slight all thou can do and thee;
18. Such language unto him they gave
Who made their sides so fat, their backs so brave,
Though what returns they make,
What kind of course they take,
I have no knowledge, neither care to have:
19. The Right'ous God's proceedings see
And triumph at the Sinners misery;
20. Who, while the house and treasure of the just
Was and is as it should be,
That is not turned to dust,
This is not impaired by rust,
Loses by fire what escaped the plund'ring enemy:
21. Keep up the trade 'twixt Heaven and Earth,
That intercourse increases mirth;
And, while thy soul ascending thither
Returns richly laden hither,
There shall be no spirit'al poverty nor dearth:
22. In every man, God sets a light,
Soberly use the light he does impart;
His Law in the two hollows of thy heart
As on two living Tables write:
23. Return to him and thou shall thrive,
And from thy much improving hive
All rascal drones away shall drive:
24. The treasures of the Ophir mine
Shall make themselves by moving Westward thine;
Consistent yellow Earth shall fill thy hand
As looser sands o'rspread the strand;
What we call Stony now
Shall quickly be
The Golden Araby
And the possessor there of thou:
25. I, God himself to thee
Shall be wooden walls at Sea,
God shall be Iron works ^n Land;
And thou with Silver shall abound,
As if what is or shall be found
Were all at thy command:
26. Thy vessel in Joy's Ocean shall (...),
And thou shall have a full, full view of Him
27. Thou need^st not fear,
He will thee hear;
Find thou a tongue, he 'll find an ear;
And thou thy justly taken oaths shall keep;
28. Whatsoever thou do intend
Shall Not fail to have a prosperous end;
To follow thee, and light to lend
The very Sun shall from the Ecliptic leap:
29. Thy scale shall mount as other scales do sink;
God rights him whom men abuse,
God honors him who honor does refuse,
Thus thou with thy self shall noise,
Thus thou shall have suffic'ent cause to think:
30. The harmless he delivers from the grave,
The sufferings of one Royal Job
^ix a great Canton of the tottring globe,
And just now-drowning Islands save.
XXIII, XXIV.
1, 2. YOu hear, my friends, ( quoth Job again)
How I complain,
Yet my complaint is less than my distress,
Much I confess
I do express,
But I much more sustain:
3. Were but the way into his presence known,
Might I but cast my self before his throne;
4. I Would set my Answers in array,
I Would quickly have enough to say,
5. What he could charge me with I Would soon detect,
I Would soon discover what he could object:
6. Would he against me use his Dignity?
And should I from the Bench accused be?
Upon good grounds I make no doubt
He Would rather in my pleading help me out:
7. With him good men in favor are,
And freely with their Judge dispute;
With him I Am certain well to fare,
For I my mighty Tryer should confute:
8. I directly on proceed
But cannot with him meet,
Then again backward I retreat
Yet cannot ^p^ed;
9. My left hand feels his Energy,
But my sight of him does miss;
On my right hand he surely is,
But so as not to be discerned by humane eye:
10. Thus being on every side
He cannot but know
Which way and how there-in I go,
Only he will have me tried,
That so like Gold I may the brighter show:
11. I walk as uprightly as they must do
Who tread the paths which God does show;
12. What he enjoined I have accounted Good,
My life's the transcript of his words,
What Nature for our sustenance affords
Could not compare
With what they are,
For I could better want my daily food:
13. But oh that Attribute! it strikes me dead,
He is Immutable, we know,
And being so
Can by no humane force be altered;
14. He will perform his own desire;
His own decree
Concerning me,
He Will actuate, and go yet high'r:
15. It Is this my trouble does create,
This styles me Job the most unfortunate;
When of his powerful power I think,
Those thoughts within me make me sink;
16. His arm lies heavy on my heart
Whose little finger causes endless smart;
He me into this misery has hurled
Who can into far greater throw the World;
Therefore I grieve
For the damage I receive
From my not setting with my setting Sun,
And my not ending ere this fatal night begun.
1. SInce Times may in the Eternal One be seen,
Those that with that Eternal One have been
How come they of the sight thereof to m^ss?
Why see they not in that bright Glass
When our Sin-working days away shall pass,
And those blessed days begin we may call His?
2. Some men their ant'ent bounds w'ont keep,
But throw the common stakes away,
Enter their neighbors grounds, and seize his sheep,
Which dressed unto their table they convey:
3. Into their field the Orphans Ass is drawn,
In their stall stands the Widows Ox a pawn:
4. Poor Footmen leave the road to them that ride,
And seek some hole which will them kindly hide:
5. Just like wild Asses in the woods they stray,
Like them in every thing but ease,
For they never work, and so do these,
These rise to work, that is, to seek their prey;
And what the barren Desert bears
Must be for food to them and theirs:
6. If toward home their course they bend
They Are made to toil with reapers in the fields;
Their Tyrants these their vassals send
To get in for them what the Harvest yields;
7. Whom they find clothed they of their clothes bereave,
And whom they naked find they naked leave,
And will not take 'um in to bed,
But let 'um lie in the cold uncovered:
8. They make 'um when it rains apace
Those showers with their bodies intercept
Which heaven upon the mountains would have wept,
And the light shelter of a rock embrace:
9. Orphans off from the dug they rudely shake,
And poor men's whole estates in pledges take;
10. Tottered they make 'um go and torn,
And rob the hungry of their sheaf of corn:
11. Their bondslaves labor in their Olive-yard,
But with the oil they make shall not shine,
They squeeze out tuns of wine
But shall not have one cup for their reward:
12. The hearty sighs of the oppressed ones
Frequently drown
The noise of the town,
Out through their wounds to heaven ascend their groans;
And all this while the World God vainly rules,
Proving none of these cruel Politic'ans fools;
13. Politic'ans that can baulk
Their enlightened Conscience.
And with its reproofs dispense,
And will not walk as that would have them walk:
14. He who forgets Thou shall not kill
Rises with the rising light
Like common water poor men's blood to spill,
A murderer by day, a thief by night:
15, He who forgets Thou shall not fornicate
Does for the dusky evening wait,
When every thing that looks like light is gone;
For now there is hopes of Secrecy,
Thus sweetly to himself sings he,
And puts his periwig and patches on:
16. Night will not wicked men betray,
She rather them occas'on sends
To break up houses which by day
They did survey
To see where the booty lay;
But light and they
Are far enough from being friends:
17. They Would rather have Deaths curtain o'r them drawn
Than be or'taken by the dawn;
If any neighbor chance to spy
That neighbor has a Cockatrices killing eye:
18. They Are borne away by the swift tide of Sin,
They Are of the cursed Family;
The Vineyard-road never wants company,
And you shall never find 'um ride therein:
19. When the weather 's hot and dry
Snow melts away,
No otherwise do they decay
Who have been Patrons of Impiety:
20. Their dam shall say she never the monsters bore;
The worm shall seize on them for meat
And find them sweet,
And they shall be remembered no more;
Trees quickly broken show their rottenness,
And Vice not holding shall betray it self no less:
21. The Tyrant barren women uses hard,
Nor does he widows (fruitful once) regard:
22. He catches strong ones in his well wrought snares,
And makes 'um know their lives are none of theirs:
23. Thus is he of Felicity possessed,
And there in sinfully dotly rest
Yet God can very well endure
To look upon, and keep the wretch secure:
24. Now he is in place of dignity,
Now he like the Most High does grow,
But he is degraded by and by
And falls as low;
He goes away as other mortals shall,
And falls as ears of corn when reaped fall:
25. Who can disprove me now in what I say,
And show in hearing me they have but lost a day.
XXV.
1. THe Prince of Shua made reply,
2. HE lives and reigns above the sky,
Empire sure fixed and shaking Fear stand by;
There War never yielded yet to Peace,
For what begins not cannot cease:
3. Can any Numerat'on tell
The Myr'ads which his colors bear?
Or can Geometry declare
Where his enlivening beams ne 'r fell?
4. How then can Man, that heap of dust,
When God makes trial of him escape as just?
At lights tribunal how shall he be freed,
Whose generat'on was so dark a deed?
5. The very Moon, why, in his sight
It is eclipsed every night;
The Stars as out of credit quite
Seem to borrow no more light;
6. Much less can heated clay his sight endure,
Much less can Earth-worm Man be pure,
Or his dim glowworm race be counted bright.
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.
1. THen up stood Job and answered,
2. It Is a good Lecture you have read,
I like your words, but fain would see your deeds;
Who ever relies on you and speeds?
How have you ever the helpless saved from harm?
How have you strengthened the strengthless arm?
3. How have you ever gi'n advice
To him who could not his adviser fee?
How hav' you patronized Verity,
Biased by Consc'ence, not by Avarice?
4. What kind of words do you let fly?
What spirit are you acted by?
5. He whom you lately spoke of, he
Does influence the deepest Sea,
And in the bottom of it does create
Things animate and things inanimate:
6. He does the Center of the world espy;
The place where sinful mortals fry,
Where souls still dying never dye,
He reaches with his All-beholding eye:
7. The Frozen Oc'an he does glaze,
The snowy mountains he does raise,
Those unknown reg'ons he stretches forth,
Making that place
Which was but space,
And filling it with that thou call'st the North,
He bids the Earth thou tread'st upon
Be its own building and foundation:
8. Those vapors which from hence the Sun exhales
With knobs of clotted water he ingrails;
Let subtle Physiologists declare
How that weak Element the Air
Bodies more heavy than it self should bear:
9. Bold Artists with their Optic tubes alone
Intend to see their Makers very throne,
But then in steps a ragged cloud or two,
And their short sight through that can nothing view:
10. He gives command
Unto the sand
The overflowing waters to withstand,
As long as an ensuing night
Shall bound the overflowing light:
11. If the stars twinkle, it is this causes it,
They Are taken with a trembling fit;
Heavens Arch, Pylasters, Pedestal,
All totters, shakes, and slides,
All Is ready down to fall,
Astonished as often as he chides:
12. When the Sea too high does flow,
Too mad, too boisterous does grow,
And of its limits too forgetful seems,
His hand divides it into diverse streams,
And so ^bates the fury of the flood;
Proud Man is far more fur'ous than the Main,
He has his storms too, which are laid again,
While God lets out and cools his heated blood:
13. He by his wisdom did the Heavens frame,
And by his wisdom he adorned the same;
He rounded and he gilded every Sphere,
There he fixed Stars, Planets he placed here;
He bid the Snake in such bright curls to flow,
As here with us Meander does below:
14. But all the Stars which shine in that
Are but dim lamps to see our Maker at;
Some of his works we have looked ore,
But that which is unseen is more;
That must have end which terminates our sight,
But what of him 's unseen is infinite;
That power which makes the thunder rore
We cannot comprehend, and therefore must adore,
1. HEre having stopped a while, As sure, quoth he,
As the Immortal God is God,
Whose dealings with me are so odd
That though I am not void of piety
He by his Act'ons so interprets me;
2. As sure as he has any might
Who is so mighty to oppress,
And my so well known Right^ousness
With such a desolat'on to requite;
3. While that my mouth above and lungs beneath
Their correspondence (as they use to do)
Through the Rough Artery renew,
While God is pleased in me to breathe;
4. That Air which I so pure into me draw
Shall Not doubly, whilst returned, be defiled
By immixt Fumes and naughty Phrases too;
My Auditors shall not be beguiled
By my relating any thing untrue:
5. Far be 't from me I should you justify
Who to unjustifie me strive;
No, as long as I Am alive
I Will still be I,
On my own merits I will still rely:
6. With my Sincerity I will not part,
But am resolved to stick unto 't,
Lest my Consc'ence me confute
And ring Memento's in my beating heart:
7. To my Oppressor I can wish no worse
Than that the Sinners fortunes may be his;
When for my Foe I would invent a Curse,
The cruell'st I can think upon is this,
May he obtain the Swearers heaven, the Drunkards bliss!
8. For what delight can the dissembler have
In his purchased Estate,
When God calls in the breath he gave,
And which when it is called in he must repay't?
9. Then, when he s just in sight of's grave,
He ll seek commerce with Heaven, but shall he ha 't?
10. Is God his Joy, his Sweet, his Dear?
At present he may chance to pray,
But will he so the next, and follow'ng day?
Will he in his Devot'on persevere?
11. That strength which Heaven does me spare
I Will spend in teaching yo^,
I will abundantly declare
What God is wont to do;
12. Though having seen 't as well as I
Why don't you leave these follies? why?
13. This port'on God affords the unjust wretch,
And this is all he lets the mighty Hunter catch:
14. The only reason why
His Children multiply
Is 'cause the Sword with them is to be fed;
But they themselves in vain shall cry,
Their crying shall procure but little bread:
15. His for ever-cursed seed
Shall die indeed, be buried indeed;
And when he to his grave is born
His widow shall not mourn,
She to his death shall take so little heed:
16. He hoards up Silver as 'twere dust,
And lays up Clothes as if as cheap as clay;
17. Silver and Clothes prepare he may;
But one shall prove the Right'ous peoples prey,
The other be of use unto the Just:
18. Observe the Palace which he rears,
A Moth 's as good an Architect;
That trifling Booth the weather better bears
Which the Keeper does ex tempore erect:
19. The rich man shall into the ground be put,
But not into the Vault off's Family;
His eye shall give one glance to see
If there be hopes of a recovery,
And then never to re-open, close and shut:
20. Terrors about him make a tempest round,
But one shall prove the Right'ous peoples prey,
Wherein he is overwhelmed, he sinks, he 's drowned;
See his frail vessel on a Dead Sea ride,
Hurried away by the fury of the tide:
21. While he on his Deathbed lies
Horrible winds arise,
And bear away this loathsome prize;
Massy trees dance about, and point at him
When he begins to die;
Oaks, Elms, and Pines had learnt before to swim,
Now they attempt the air and fly;
As if they did officiously desire
To be fuel for his urn,
But they (alas!) when kindled can expire.
And therefore they are useless to that fire
Where-in such Malefactors burn:
Thus to the shades the Tyrant goes,
A Hurricano fetches him away,
Whence all see, whither no man knows
And his last puff makes a tempestuous day:
22. For God does lay upon him, and not spare
Till the wretch be quite destroyed;
Fain he would, but can 't avoid
That mighty Arm which reaches every where:
23. At him shall all 's Spectators clap their hands
Not in kind applause but scoff;
Though now upon the Royal Stage he stands,
Hisses shall quickly send him off.
1. THere 's in the Macro-cosme a Mine
Which with its rivulets of Silver seems
To ape the Micro-cosmes purple streams;
And somewhere Artists Gold refine:
2. These force Iron from the place
Where it ingend' red was,
And others out of melted Oar make Brass:
3. God does the finite Darkness bound;
He vieweth all things that perfect on have,
Black Rocks, and light-less quarries under ground,
And sees into Deaths shady cave:
4. Those Miners when their Mine is made
And they go down into 't,
Their passage by a flood is staid
Through which for m'ny an age no foot
Had been observed to wade;
And which dries by and by away,
And does them or their work no longer stay:
5. Earths surface does recruit our Butt'ry-store,
Her bowels send our Chimneys coals;
6. There lurk Sapphires in their holes
There grows the yellow oar:
7. There is a path which scapes the Vulturs eyes,
Which never any fowl yet saw,
8. Which has no print of any Lions paw,
Or of a bigger or a lesser size:
9. He but his hand thereto applies,
And up by the roots the mountain flies:
10. Among the Rocks he makes streams run;
And sees whatever rareness makes good;
11. He bridles up the swelling flood;
And things that never saw't before he shows the Sun:
12. But where is Wisdom? who can tell?
And where does Understanding dwell?
13. Men know not what its price may be;
'Tent above ground,
'T ent among Mortals to be found;
14. It Is not in me,
Cries the vast Sea;
I have it not, answers Profundity:
15. It cannot be purchased for Gold,
Talents of Silver will in vain be told;
16. Ophire ingots will not do 't,
Onyx and Saphyre's nothing to 't:
17. Low will be Golds and Chrystals rate,
Crystal will be but common glass,
Gold but for common dirt will pass;
Nay, you shall not ha 't
Though you would give for it houses full of plate:
18. Coral may blush and pearls look pale,
This may be vexed, that ashamed
Because with her not to be named;
Rubies as worthless must to Wisdom vail:
19. The Ethiop'an Topaz to her does not shine,
Nor will she be compared to the Golden mine:
20. Come then, Philosopher, and show me this,
Whence Wisdom comes, and where it is:
21. Alas! there is none alive can tell;
When she is the thing they would find
Eagles are blind,
And Vultur's know not how to smell;
22. Death and Destruct'on know all things too well,
Yet even these declare
How ignorant of her they are,
Only her Fame (they say) has reached their cell:
23. God fully knows
Whither she goes,
And where she grows;
24. For Earth to him its secrets shows,
And all things under Heaven themselves to him disclose:
25. He looks about
The World throughout
To poise the rudely rumbling wind,
The Ocean in unseen scales to lay,
And there the Waters weigh,
And see 'um keep the measure he assigned:
26. And when h' ordained how Rain the Earth should wash,
How Thunder crack, how Lightning flash,
When he did her and all things frame,
27. He looked through and through the same,
He pleased to study that which he had made
And gave report thereof, and said,
28. Here-in Understanding lies,
To fear thy God is to be wise;
And Practical Theology alone
Is all the Arts and Sciences in one.
1. JOb farther yet replied,
2. Oh that Times tide
Might backward flow,
And I might no more sorrow know
Than I did twelve and twelvescore moons ago,
When God still interposed 'twixt me and woe;
3. When of his servant careful he
Held out of heaven a candle unto me;
With whose fair beams my face was ray'd,
And with whose aid
I feared no shade,
But could through Oceans of Darkness wade;
4. When yet no down upon my chin did rise,
When Gods more general Providence
To guard my house did not suffice,
But I felt too his secret Influence;
5. When he brought with him Heaven into my tent;
When my children round me went,
I being Center, they Circumference;
6. When I had so rich a soil
I trod on butter as I went it round;
And, as if every day I had been crowned,
The very rocks were found
To run continually with oil;
7. When I went through the town to the Judgment Seat,
And rode in state along the street;
8. For then the young that did me meet
Stole privately away;
Up also rose the gray
And would not see me but upon their feet:
9. To talk the Princes were afraid,
Upon their mouths their hands they laid:
10. And men of noble blood
Quite speechless stood,
Their tongue now failed
As if within their mouths 't were nailed:
11. Who ever my story heard applauded me;
Passengers seeing me cried This is he:
12. For I help Innocence against might,
And righted Orphans whom none else would right:
13. They whom I saved in their extremity
Thank't God first for the life He gave,
And then they thank't him for creating me
That their expiring life to save;
I taught their Widows too their melody:
14. Holiness was my Royal gown,
I put on Justice for a crown:
15. Sight to the sightless I became,
And Loco-mot'on to the lame:
16. I studied (Father-like) the poor man's cause,
To find what I for him might say;
17. I broke the persecutors cruel jaws,
And snatched from thence the bleeding prey:
18. Then thus my self I blessed,
Here in my nest,
Here I until my glass be done shall rest;
Which glass of mine will not be done
Till Natures stock of sand be through it run:
19. My root, as by the waterside I grew,
I did far and wide diffuse;
The breath of Heaven condensed into dew
Did it self amongst my branches lose:
20. I found my blooming Glory still renew;
My hand was fertile earth to the growing crooked yew:
21. All men my discourse approved,
All heard with silence whatso-e'r I moved:
22. My words once spoke were never opposed by theirs,
They dropped so sweetly from my mouth into their ears:
23. They longed for them as earnestly
As the parch't fields do for rain,
And as, when they 're again adry,
They long in harvest time to drink again:
24. If being pleasant for a while
On any I bestowed a smile,
They to themselves did seem
To be in a sweet sanguine dream,
Not able to believe they did possess
Truly and really such happiness;
My favorable looks were Light,
Whose very dawn none of 'um all would slight:
25. In every serious affair
I took the chair,
And was Lord Paramount in the Field;
I was looked upon as born
To help my friends when helpless and forlorn,
And comfort unto my afflicted country yield.
1. BUt now young fellows me their Seno'r mock,
Fellows whose Grandsires were so base
I Would never allow 'um place
Among those currs I keep to guard my flock:
2. For how could such ever stand a man in stead
Whose strength, though they still breathed, was dead?
Through fourscore Zod'acks Time had run
Since first he had begun
To scatter Fourscore's whiteness on their head:
3. To strange by-holes and wildnesses they fled,
Famine forced them away
To Deserts unto which no footsteps led
Whose first Inhabitants were they:
4. Mallows by the bushes they cut up to eat,
Juniper-roots to them were fragrant meat:
5. From their acquaintance they were made to fly,
And were pursued with an Hue and Cry:
6. Into the solitary vale they went
Where Nature found '^m clifts, Art dug 'um caves,
The Rock too an unusull monument
Lent the yet-living wretches graves:
They lay along the hedges side
And there for Alms they cried;
The nettles did the couchant vermin hide:
8. The foolish Two's that joined to give 'um birth
Very little understood;
They were mere muck-worms, sons of earth,
Sons of earth! said I? they were not so good:
9. These, these men's sons make me their melody,
When they want one to jeer they think on me:
13. They loath me, and they run from me apace,
And every tag-rag spitteth in my face:
11. For God the reins out of my hand has took,
My happiness and power is ceas't,
And now the Multitude that heady beast
The late coercive bridle off has shook:
12. The 'pprentices soon armed
Trip up the heels of Government;
And they new ways invent
How I may be farther harmed:
13. They spoil the path where I should go,
And to procure my woe
They of Auxiliaries have no need,
They Are able of themselves to do the deed:
14. (Surely) Dead Seas break in upon my soul,
Floods of corroding waters on me roll;
15. Fears and Terrors (certainly)
Themselves in humane shapes array,
And upon me as swift as tempests fly;
As with a cloud the tempests roughly play,
And carry the weak Met'or quite away,
Even so deal these with my tranquillity:
16. My vital moisture owzes through my skin;
My merry days are past, my sad begin:
17. Where marrow ought to flow
There needles seem to grow,
My pointed marrow does my bones infest;
And through immod'rate heat
My pulse so high does beat
That all my other members take no rest:
18. It Is a disease that is strong enough
To stain the very clothes I wear;
I Am girt about as 'twere
With long congealed clods of putrid stuff:
19. Into the mire I Am headlong thrown;
Dust and Ashes I am grown:
20. I beg, and beg, but cannot be heard;
I stand, and wait
At Heaven-gate,
Yet my petition cannot be preferred:
21. Thy Being, for ought I understand,
's but one continued Act of Tyranny;
And thy strong, resistless hand
Has set it self to work my misery:
22. What a Guardian have I!
I am some Evil Spirits care
Who does me bear
I know not where,
Upon and through the Clouds I fly,
And when I Am there
Evaporate into the thinnest air:
23. The life Thou gave me I Am sure to lose;
Thou Wilt bring me to the General Rendevouz:
24. Thou, whose Tutelary power
Does not extend unto the grave;
Men call upon Thee at their dying-houre.
But at their dying-houre thou will not save:
25. Looked not I
Still with a watery eye
On people plunged into distress?
Did not I pity them no less
Whom I beheld reduced to Poverty?
26. Yet when I look to have all things serene
There Is no Serenity 'll be seen;
My self with hopes of Day I feed,
But still one Night another does succeed,
And no Day intervene:
27. My bowels in me tumults raise;
Through heat boiled water rises, they through strife;
My Fasting and my mourning days
I find the greater part of all my life:
28. The Sun to me might always set,
No need of his bright Rays to make me cry;
As soon as the Assembly met
Presently up stood I,
And entertained them with my Tragedy:
29. Certain strange creatures in the Desert are,
They Are plated o re with scales,
They Have long and bearded tails,
Their bulk huge massy wings can hardly bear;
You may in them the Image spy
Of Heavens degraded Hierarchy;
And I am one of their Fraternity:
There is another winged race
With a thick neck, and broader face,
Which does all day in Ivy-thickets lie
Ashamed of its deformity,
And then when others cease, begin to fly;
And I am free of this rare Company:
30. Adust matter blacks my skin,
And preternat'ral heat within
Burns up my bones;
31. I to tune my Harp begin,
But make therewith only melod'ous groans,
My whining Organ sends out naught but doleful tones.
1. MY eyes did lately undertake
Nothing through them us passage make
But they would it, if vain, control;
Why should any Spec'es then
Pleasing to wanton men
Pass through them into my soul?
2. That heart for th'truly lovely One cannot seek
In which the pictures hudled lie
Of a jet brow, a di'mond eye,
A ruby lip and cheek;
Into that room
Where candles come
Must not heaven but dimly shine?
Will not the Carnal Love extinguish the Divine?
3. And then when that does once expire
Is there not kindled strait a dismal fire?
They that delight in wickedness
What can they gain
But endless pain?
What can they look for but astonishing distress?
4. As if he did not fully know
How I step, and where I go!
5. If with sin
I have struck in,
If I have practiced foolish feats,
And gadded after cheats,
6. Ballance-trial here I claim
To prove of how full weight I am:
7. If I have gone a^ry,
And, when my eye
Has fondly glanc't,
After it my heart has danced,
And if my ravished hands have lost their purity;
8. Then let my en^mies sith cut what I sow,
And let his sword my childrens children mow:
9. If I have doted on some comely lass,
And watch't when she by the next door did pass;
10. Then let my wise a strumpet be,
And so dishonor both her self and me:
11. Should I have such unclean desires,
Should I nourish such strange fires,
Those fires would quickly find their vents,
Their flame would rise,
And bring me in as guilty at the Assize.
12. They spoil my Country-rents,
And damnifie my Candle-tenements:
13. If I to do my servants right refused,
If I my man because my man abused,
Or wronged my maid because my maid;
14. When God appears, as he will do ere long,
When he makes Inquisition for wrong,
What Is my Apology? what can for me be said?
15. Why should I with my servant disagree?
I have no reason to do so;
He is my fellow quondam-Embrie;
And he that formed him has formed me:
16. If I have gulled the afflicted ones,
Lessened their goods, increas't their groans;
If I the widows did neglect,
And made them long but all in vain expect;
17. If by my self in state I dined
While Orphans at my door with hunger pined;
If all on my own gut I spent
And to the poor no crumbs of comfort sent;
18. Then -- But the party that had none
A father found in me,
And when the widow made her moan
A husband to her I never scorned to be:
19. If surlily I bid poor folks be gone
When they begged something to put on;
If these eyes could ever behold
Sad wretches starve with cold;
20. If I did never care
My sheep to sheare
And so my flocks to cold condemn
To provide warm coats for them;
If they me as their Cloather never blessed;
21. If I have basely those assailed
Whom help in their deceased father failed
When I the works and upper ground possessed;
22. Then let this arm rot off in torturing pain,
Never to be in wrath lift up again:
23. But this is not my case,
I saw how right'ous Heaven was;
I saw destruct'on against Tyrants dash,
They escaped it not,
The bullet hot,
And I took warning by the flash:
I saw what God did on Oppressors send,
And seeing dared not that way offend:
24. If with the thoughts of gold my soul I fed,
If in my money I ever gloried,
25. Either as such,
Or as so much,
Or if I rested on full bags my head;
26. If my affections had run
After the affect'on-worthy Sun,
Whose buried beams Earth cannot hold,
They Are dug up clods of gold,
Had I made these the object of my love,
Or doted on him culminant above;
Had I been Luna's worshipper,
Or gazed too much upon the face in her;
27. Had I been into vanity trapann'd,
Had my mouth idolized my thrifty hand;
28. Had this been so, God might have done with me
As Judges with convicted persons do;
I had denied his Deity,
Owning my self for one, and there cannot be two:
29. If in's distress my foe I jeered,
If at his fall I domineered,
Then -- 30. But his ruin was against my will,
I neither did nor wished him ill;
Such projects I still let alone
Whereby mad Politicians are known
Other men's souls to curse and wound their own:
31. My servants never had cause to cry,
Oh for some vict'als that would satisfy!
Oh for a bit of what our Master eats!
His sav'ry dishes, his substant'al sweets!
We cannot live on these empty meats;
32. Strangers that chance't to come that way
Never had cause to say
Oh might we but within doors lie!
Here cold o'recomes our vitals, and we die;
Lodgings to them I did afford,
I was free of bed and board:
33. If I confessed not of my own accord,
But dodg'd and cried The woman, Lord,
34. If I have been of multitudes afraid,
Or cared what whole families have said,
If seeing them begin
To scoff and grin
I held my tongue and kept with-in;
25. Then indeed -- But you shall find
I Am quite of another mind;
It Is my desire 'twere once agreed
That I might plead,
And that the Judge would take his Judgment Seat,
And I might there my Adversary meet;
I long to see him with his fatal bill,
36. Which, if I might, I would embrace,
And my proud forehead with it grace,
37. Which also I my self would help to fill;
I would new matter of indictment bring,
I Would show him where aside I stepped,
What laws I have, what laws I have not kept,
And I would reverence him e'n as I would my King:
38. If what I call my land
Should against me plaintiff stand,
If the furrows like so many mouths should gape
And accuse their Lord of rape;
39. If I into my barns have brought
The income of that ground I never bought;
If I have seized upon ought
By cutting of the owners throat;
40. Then let me'nstead of wheat wild thistles grind,
And when I seek for barley cockle find.
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.
1. THus urged he;
The other three
Hereat grew mute,
And ceased farther to dispute
Seeing their Friend so strangely Resolute;
They would persuade him that he was unjust,
But he would believe no more than needs he must:
2. Then on Elihu fell,
( Sprung from the loins of Berachel,
As he from Ram, and Ram from Buz)
Foully he fell upon the Prince of Uz
For thinking ill of God, and of himself too well:
3. He fell too on the company,
Because of all that Job relates
None ought denies, none ought evalidates,
Yet they would deny him his Integrity:
4. Thus long staid he
Till they and Job and all had done
Ere he begun,
Out of respect to Seniority:
5. But when he saw them stand, and stare, and gaze,
When all their Eloquence was spent,
Then began Angers flame within to blaze,
6. Which the bold Buzite thus did vent;
I am brown, and you are gray,
And therefore what I thought I feared to say;
7. Old Age (quoth I) and long Experience,
They, they shall talk in Justices defense;
8. But if my self I rightly prize
My soul too has her noble Faculties;
Knowledge descends, and he is wise,
Who utters what is whispered from the skies:
9. Wit does not always upon power attend,
And Age and Judgment are not always Twins,
But sometimes one comes to its end
When the other but begins:
10. This reason to my self I gave
Why I should dare your best attent'on crave,
And show you what opinions I have:
11. I long your Answers did expect,
I heard and conn'd your Argument;
I waited whilst you o'r the Topics went
To find out something which you might object:
12. I looked to have what you should speak
Stownd this conceited Saint,
But found your Answers faint,
And your Convictives very weak:
13. So that you have no cause, you see,
To boast you have done the deed by Sophistry;
But if Job humbled be
And have a sense of his impurity,
It Is God, not you, makes the discovery:
14. I a'nt against him prejudiced
For his taunting Ironies,
And therefore will not such retorts devise
As you incensed by his cutting jeers devised:
15, 16. They loo'kt on one another o'r and o'r
Surprised with strange stupidity,
I looked on them, and they on me,
Standing like stocks, and answering no more:
17. Nay then, thought I, the turn is come to me,
And now to give my verdict I am free:
18. I Am full of sense, full to the brim,
I have a Prompter in my breast
It Is he my matter does suggest,
And I, whate'r it is, must follow him:
19. Spirit'ous wine too close in bottles pent
The temper of my soul does represent,
As that its earthen, this its fleshly pr'son does rent:
20. I Will out with what I cannot hold,
And for my easement will make bold:
21. I do'nt desire to complement, not I;
Nor shall my tongue relate for true
(As your Sycophants will do)
What in my heart I know to be a lie,
Or any man's small merits magnify;
22. Should I Panegyricks frame,
And adding fuel to Ambit'ons flame
Words for a better use intended waste,
I should finely earn my Death,
Essent'al Truth would quickly stop my breath,
'Twould be the read'est way for me to speak my last.
1. THerefore, my honest friend,
To my plain discourse attend;
2. Since through my mouth my thoughts have found their vent,
Since my tongue has once begun
Into a long discourse to run,
And answer'ng Natures wise intent
Prove useful Speeche's chiefest Instrument;
3. Into my words I Will put my heart,
And make the honesty thereof appear;
Solid knowledge I Will impart,
And in imparting it I will be clear:
4. Gods Sp'rit did me my being give;
He breathed life into me, and I live:
5. If thou art able to dispute,
And what I assert gainsay,
Put thy self into a way,
Hold up thy face, and boldly do 't:
6. You see you have your own desire;
It pleases the Great Deity
By proxy to contest with thee,
And here you are to answer me
Made like your self out of consistent mire:
7. I have no dreadful glory thee to fright,
I cannot crush thee by my might;
I have no Golden-rayed head,
I have no hand of Lead:
8. Come, come, I have heard your Cant,
I Have heard you to this purpose rant;
9. I have done naught amiss,
Look m' o'r and o'r, you will find in me no spot;
The Child unborn less harmless is,
And for Iniquity, I know it not;
10. Where I never gave offense, offense he takes,
And needs will make me his Antagonist;
11. My feet fast in the Stocks he makes;
And notes where I Have done right, where I have mist:
12. Sir, under favor, it is a lie,
And what I say I Will justify,
That God is far superior to thee;
13. What ails thee to keep such a do?
He will no Reason of 's proceedings show,
But ever was in them and ever will be Free:
14. God speaks, and speaks, and speaks again,
But of his speaking there is no notice taken;
Men though awake asleep they seem;
15. And therefore in some vision or dream
He makes 'um make as 'twere when they should sleep;
Then he at their bedside appears,
16. And lets in his Instruct'on through their ears,
Which they when once it is in shall ever keep:
17. And wherefore, think you, does he thus?
It Is to teach frail man to shun
That into which he else would run,
And keep him from to be Ambitious;
18. So that his soul, as things are brought about,
Shall not down to the hid'ous vault,
Though the proud Faulch'on did the same assault
Just ready to have let it out:
19. Yet by and by, poor man! he bedridden lies;
Now, oh my back! now, oh my hip! he cries.
20. He cannot believe his bread is sweet,
He finds no daintiness in dainty meat:
21. What he had of flesh is gone,
That cannot be discerned as it has been;
And so his till-now-latent bones are seen
And represent him a mere Sceleton:
22. His soul draws nigh
To the devouring grave,
And he a prey does lie
To those who no man's life will save:
23. Then if there come a Malachy,
An Orthodox Divine,
One worth nine hundred ninety nine;
For while so many uselesly stand by,
And to the sad dark wretch no light supply,
This one does gloriously shine,
And shows him how himself to justify;
24. And so the Eternal Word is heard to say,
Throw not his soul into the pit,
Stay, recall, deliver it,
My self will to my self its ransom pay:
25. His withered flesh
Shall be as fresh
As when he was but five months old,
Infancy's heat shall drive out Ages cold:
26. He of his pardon shall not miss,
But when he does for mercy cry
Find favor in his Judges eye;
God shall display himself to him in bliss,
And give the just man what is his:
27. God often does the World survey;
And, if there is any found therein to say
Ah! guilty before heaven here I stand,
And whatsoever went
For a thing indifferent
I made it bad by taking it in hand;
What profit's in my Act'ons? what great gain?
Whilst the poor Penitent does thus complain,
Heavens hollow Arch re-eccho's back Great Gain:
28. He once was to have been
A brand where damned spirits are
Eternal Love does change the scene,
And shows him heaven and makes him there a star:
29. This course with man God often takes,
And a Prince of a prisoner makes,
30. Bringing him from the dung'on to the Throne,
From Darkness to Lights Beatifick Vision:
31. Mind me (my Friend) in what I say,
Bridle your tongue, and give me way;
32. If thou have an Apology
Thou may there on dilate,
I Am on thy side, and would thee justify;
33. If thou have not, attend, and cease to prate;
I have some knowledge to communicate.
1. FVrther he urged, and pray (quoth he) attend,
You who for Virtuoso's go,
An ear unto me lend,
You who would be thought to know;
3. The taste is judge of grosser meat,
The ear is judge of what the soul must eat:
4. Integrity is variously defined,
Let us consider every kind
Which therof's commonly assigned,
And what is found to be the best
Let Us hold to that, and flight the rest;
Let us among our selves agree
What that which we will own for Good shallbe:
5. Our friend here, Job is ma^^ ^er^,
And needs will his own Right'ousness assert;
God (cries he) has done me wrong;
6. I will no^ wrong my self too by a lie,
By fearing my own deeds to justify;
I never deserved this, not I,
Yet I Am undone without recovery,
This is the impious burden of his imp'ous song:
7. Did ever the Word the like to Job produce?
When drunk to, it is his use
Proudly to pledge his friends with an abuse:
8, 9. He uses most to them that are profane,
He is their fellow traveller;
He Is not ashamed to aver
That to converse with Heaven's all in vain:
10. Now you (whom Knowledges whole self does fill)
Please you, while I discourse, be still;
Far be it from Jehovah to do ill,
And act by a corrupted Will:
11. When he men's Act'ons shall requite,
Their work shall be the measure of their pay,
They shall find several Inns at night
According as they ride a several way:
12. God will not Providence commit,
Nor other sentence give than what is fit:
13. Who put the World to him to rule, rehearse;
Who chose him Monarch of the Universe?
14. If h' have a mind no more to lend,
If he will no longer trust,
But for the life and breath we borrow send,
15. All of us crumble into dust:
16. As you have Reason, my discourse endure;
17. Shall he be set distempered States to cure
Who himself a Leper is,
And hates what is not amiss?
Will thou esteem even Crown-gold impure?
18. Is It fit to bring a Monarch to the bar?
Is it not Sacred Majesty,
And (as such) from reck'nings free?
Must not only Heaven o'rsee
Those Kings which only Heavens Stewards are?
When Clouds in the lower Reg'on rise,
Trouble our State, or cast its skies,
Charge we that darkness on our Polar Star?
Is 't fit to go to Men of high Degree,
And tell one to his face
Thou want grace,
And cry to another There Is no Light in thee?
19. Much less may you him condemn
In whole account
The Spade 's as good as the Dradem,
And Princes but to Pe^sants do amount,
For he alike created these and them:
20. They shall receive their doom
Sooner than Sol shoots out a ray;
When they to sleep assay
Terrors shall frighten sleep away;
The Commons shall consume,
The Grandees shall be slain, and none shall know by whom:
21. There Is no mot'on cheats his eye,
He does the walks of Mankind mark,
22. Prevaricators he 'll descrie
As in the shade by night they lie,
Be that shade never so thick, be that night never so dark:
23. And when he has them and their act'ons seen,
Accordingly with them he will deal;
How heinous their offense has been
They in their punishment shall feel,
And shall not to any other Judge appeal:
24. He Will take Commanders, be they never so high,
And the one against the other throw
Till they all into shivers fly,
And upon others what they had bestow;
25. Well does he know
They are not right,
And therefore turns 'um off by night
Off they are turned and away they go:
26 They like condemned malefactors die
Public Examples as it were,
Acting their own Tragedy
Upon the Worlds wide Amphi-theatre:
27. For they from him Apostatized,
And all his holy ways despised:
28. They did their fellows (too) too much despise,
Men of their make, though not so richly lined;
Who b'ng oppressed send up to heaven their cries,
Up get those cries to heaven, and there admittance find:
29. When he Wars tumults does assuage,
Who can alarm and disturb the town?
And when he flings away in rage
Who can endure his frown?
Who dares with an incensed God engage,
When he a person fills with discontent,
Or when he breeds a Nat'ons dissettlement?
30. For both oftentimes does he,
Lest some dissembling General
By vows he makes, by tears which he lets fall
Should cheat the Many into slavery,
Grasp Empire, make himself their Lord
By Inspirat'on and a longer Sword:
31. You should fall down at your Creators feet,
And there adore, and thus him greet,
What thou inflictedst (Lord) I kindly bore,
For I had sinned, but I will sin no more;
32. Teach me what I do not know,
And, if I Have done amiss before,
Now for the future I will not do so:
33. Is It reasonable your Will the World should sway?
Or give you way,
Or cry you Nay,
He, while I
Only stand by,
As men have wrought will them their wages pay;
Now out with what you have to signify:
34. And let men that are wise
With me about these things advise;
And in the interim my words obey:
35. For, Job's discourse! it is not fit,
His tongue so runs before his wit;
26. Yet, now I think on it, what he has to say,
Let him be heard it out to day;
Lest if we stop abruptly here,
All Self-justiciaries domineer;
37. Convince him now, it is high time,
Since he so stiffly justifies his crime;
Long of a silly Argument
He triumphs thus
O'r baffled us,
And grows toward his Creator more than Impudent.
1. ELihu further goes, and pleads,
2. Are you in earnest then?
Must the Almighty yield to men?
Think thou thy justice his exceeds?
3. For so thy words seem to import;
If I leave sin,
What do I win?
If sin I choose,
What do I lose?
Integrity! I Am never the better for 't;
What I in other men reward,
That he in me does not at all regard:
4. I Will undertake the point with you
And your unbelieving crew;
5. The skies and starry heavens see,
The clouds survey
Lower than they,
Yet higher far than thee;
6. Who framed these, must certainly be such
As thy impiety can never touch;
Do thou amiss,
It is no loss of his;
Do what is right,
He gains not by 't;
He Is unconcerned in what thou do;
8. Although some men get by thy being just,
Others be holocausted to thy Lust:
9. Lust, said I? Lusts I should have s^id,
Tyrannique man sends out
Armies thereof the World throughout,
And by their aid
People not born his slaves are made;
They suffer so much harm,
The strokes of such a weighty arm,
That you might well esteem them stone,
Rather than made of flesh and bone,
Were 't not that they make their moan
In a kind of humane tone,
For bitterly they sigh and groan;
10. But not a man for God enquires
Who fills with joy the vessels that he made,
Who when his darlings down to sleep are laid
Turns their bed-chambers into quires;
Who in the silent night makes us to sing;
11. Who gives us such a noble soul,
That on our Judgments feet, and Fancy 's wing
W' outrun the swiftest beast, w' outfly the swiftest fowl.
12. Ah me! how the inslaved wretches lie?
Who have this comfort in their misery,
It is permitted them to call and cry,
But they cannot reach the proud Oppressor's ear;
For who so deaf as they that will not hear?
13. Well, let worldly Vanity
In its own thoughts grow never so high,
It shall not reach the Almighty's eye;
No notice shall thereof by him be taken,
No, it shall be it self, it shall be vain:
14. Thy deeds, thou cry'st,
How just soever they have been,
Yet are they not so much as seen;
Nay, but they are, they are, thou lie;
He does behold, he does approve be sure,
And thou, were unbelief away,
Did not that thy reas'nings sway,
Might on that approbation rest secure:
15. It is thy horrid unbelief
Which unto thee unknown does cause thy grief;
16. So that of this dispute there is no need,
Thy foolish lips are moved indeed,
But what it is from them does proceed
Thou seem to take little heed;
The have arguments enough,
But what they prove, or how,
We neither can perceive, nor know thou.
1. THen having made a little pause,
2. Hear me (quoth he) another clause,
Pardon my being so prolix,
And I will on some certain med'um fix
Which I shall use in my great Masters cause;
3. I Will pierce the bowels of the Earth,
Where richest Min'rals have their birth;
Down to the bottom of the Sea I Will go,
Where prec'ous shells so thick do grow;
From those remotest parts from thence
Some fetch pearls, and some fetch gold,
I Will reach an' Argument from thence,
And pleading for my Maker will be bold:
4. Mark me, for of the truth I shall not miss,
Wisdom it self my prompter is:
5. How large and absolute is God's command!
Yet is it not attended with disdain;
Notice by him of every one is ta ne,
Who has both a strong head and hand:
6. He Will have no Malefactors death deferred;
He Will have all honest men be fully heard:
7. The righteous by him are owned, and owned,
They are the Nobles, they are the only Peers,
So settled in the State they have no fears
Of being ever dethroned:
8. But then again when once his favor fails,
And they prove only fit to people Jails,
When they are laid in hold
Shackled with pains
As common prisoners are with chains,
9. Then of their former deeds they are told,
And shown where-in they have been too free,
Where-in they have taken too much liberty:
10. Their lately Adder-ear
Quickly wide open does appear
Unto Afflict'ons charm,
By which when once admonished they begin
To leave their heav'n-provoking sin,
And cease to do their neighbors harm;
11. If they obey
And mind what Miseries sharp voice does say,
Obed'ence sure Felicity shall bring;
Their days shall all
Be Festival,
And all the Quarters of their year be Spring;
12. If otherwise, unhappy they!
The Sword shall send 'um e'n like brutes away:
13. But they that so demurely act their part
As to be rotten in their heart,
And yet in appearance sound,
Do but for themselves invent
New Degrees of punishment
While far enough from to Relent
Though in Adversities strong fetters bound:
14. In their Prime they are snatched away;
As the unclean die, so die they:
15. He saves the poor in their distress;
It Is in design he does oppress,
That so his Counsel they may heed
And follow'ng it be freed,
16. He has helped thousands at their need,
And would, be sure, have helped thee no less;
He would have brought thee out of all thy straits,
Thy Sitnah Rehcboth had been,
Thy Zoar a whole Palestine,
And he that at thy table waits
Nothing but marrow should have served in:
17. But now what plagues to them are due
Which from Right'ousness do swerve,
All those your Actions deserve,
And Justice now does justly seize on you:
18. He has an Attribute
Which we his Justice call,
'Twill be your wisdom to look to it
Lest under that you fall,
For then whole worlds paid down upon the nail
To ransom your lost soul cannot prevail;
19. He will with scorn behold
Thy bags of Gold,
And slight thy sword, and shield, and coat of mail:
^^. Wish not among those Millions to lie
Who Are sent by night to endless woe or rest,
21. Such imp'ous thoughts detest
Which to thy breast
Some evil spirits suggest
Making thee wish rather outright to dye
Than live and suffer farther misery:
22. Be 't known unt' ye
The Almighty one alone is he
Who places men in high degree,
And he best teaches peasants Emperors to be:
23. Who is it can order him what way to take?
Or say, he does the Righteous path forsake?
24. Forget not, Sir, to have a reverend thought
Of him who this rare frame has wrought;
25. This Frame which men are born to look upon,
And which they see
Though never so far they be,
For still they are near to some part of th'Creation:
26. He Is so transcendentally great
That Metaphysick's but a cheat,
Which does so vainly of his Essence treat;
And such is his Eternity,
That we no shore can ever see
'Twixt which the Ocean thereof should beat:
27. Humid Molecula's which we call Rain
Upon the parched Earth he pour's;
Vapors drawn up drop down again,
And turn to showr's;
28. Showers, which down from the hollow heaven drill
As from the head of some vast Still,
And man's beloved Earth with moisture fill:
29. I wonder who will declare
Whence it is the clouds so great a breadth should bear,
Whence it is they make such noises in the air:
30. Through these His light on us does glance,
Who hides with waves the bottom of the sea;
31. These testify how Just is He,
How well he deals with him, and thee, and me;
These help the Earth to yield us sustenance:
32. These he is used to interpose 'twixt us
And yonder Sun the source of Light,
So that the Sun's no longer bright
By these Opacities eclipsed thus:
33. As with a less or greater noise they move,
The tempest does or less or greater prove;
The Sign does with the Signified agree;
Quick-sighted beasts th'ascending Vapor see
And thence foretell what kind of shower it is like to be.
1. HEreat my heart within me strangely stirred;
With trembling struck
A leap it took
Down from the Second Ventr'cle to the Third:
2. Hark, hark,
The Thund'rer speaks;
Mark, how he rattles, mark;
When his mouth opens, what a noise he makes!
3. A noise, which under the whole heaven he sends;
His Lightning sees where Nature ends:
4. That goes before, his Thunder follows;
His Excellency loudly hollows;
Then weep the clouds and hardly cease,
When once he has discharged the warning piece:
5. You hear the Thunders rumbling noise,
That Thunder's but his ordinary voice;
His Achievements are so great,
Our Fancy to them is not adequate:
6. Sometimes he gives command unto the Snow,
Go, thou harmless Met'or, go,
Take up thy quarters now below;
Thy myr'ads of pure flakes display
Which rather Whitenesses appear than White,
Those Ends of Light,
Those minutes of a super-added day;
Particles of that wool whose greater flocks
Silver the Summer-Equinox;
There six stupendous branches show
Which in such equal Length and Number grow,
That they who into Natures works inquire
Their var'ous figure may admire,
And wonder more at me who made them so
Sometimes again
He gives command unto the Rain,
Go Drops, ye gentle ones and small,
On such and such sown Acres fall
And with your moisture feed
The usefully corrupting seed,
And help it to grow tall;
Sometimes he gives the mighty Showers a call,
Go Drops of great bulk and strength,
Dark such a peoples air, and then at length
Beat down their standing Corn and spoil it all:
7. When Artists go to work, he makes 'um stay,
At his command
Numness attacques their active hand;
That so while they
Keeping a ted'ous Holy Day
Of their Act'ons cannot vaunt,
His Actions alone may be predominant:
8. He sends Brute-animals home to their cell,
Thither they go, and there they idly dwell:
9. From his South point the Whirlwind rowls,
His freezing Guards send cold;
10. He breaths forth frost,
And then the Waters former breadth is lost:
11. He uses swelling Clouds to drain
By squeezing out their rain;
Smooth-painted ones he scatters all about,
And so the cur'ous Bow goes out:
12. Round go they at his decree,
And so fulfill
The Eternal will,
And order things as he would have 'um be:
13. As 't pleases him about they 're hurled,
Either his people to annoy
Or to increase their joy,
Or else in common Love to all the world:
14. You, Job, attend; sit to 't, and ruminate
Upon Gods wondrous works which I relate:
15. Can thou the time design
When at his beck the Clouds in order join,
And some above their fellows shine?
16. Come, little-knowing Vzzite, come,
Confess thy Ignorance,
Thou know not how the Clouds above thee dance
In such an aequilibrium;
Thou can not to a sight attain
Of the Achievements of the Deity,
Which does so all things know, and all things see,
That nothing does for thee to know, or see remain:
17. Thou can not tell
How borrowed wool should warm thy back so well;
Thou can not find
How the rude Southern wind
Should make the te^ming Earth to swell:
18. Prithee were thou the mighty Workman's mate
When he the heaven did excavate,
That immense, admirable Glass
So rarely cast,
Fixed so fast,
That it for polish't Steel may rather pass:
19. Pray will you help us make our Speech,
And how we must pronounce it teach;
We know not how our words to place,
Darkness within hides all their outward grace:
20. I cannot speak, and therefore will be mute;
No Messenger to heaven shall journies make,
And there relate I my Defense will make;
Seeing to talk were a devouring Gulf to shoot:
21. Look but on yonder Cloud,
Which now Laveers against the Sun;
See how the Rays into it run,
How fast they run, how thick they crowd,
Themselves there-in to shroud:
When Arts here-after shall have crossed the Sea,
And Greece in Wisdom shall instructed be,
A Superstit'ous Socrates
Consid'ring these
May worship 'um in stead of Goddesses;
But vulgar people do not care
To mark their mot'ons through the air
Their var'ous postures in that Element;
How strangely into curls they flow,
How through them the wind does blow,
Carrying off with it then Excrement:
22. Out of the North
God sends forth
A sure though unseen Scavenger,
Who shall take order that the Air be clear,
Yet let the Air never so serene appear,
He himself's far more serene,
And with such Majesty is seen,
As may at once raise our Delight and Fear:
23. Let Staffs, and Bows, and Astro-labes be tried;
Let the Three-corner'd brass be rectified;
Let streaks of Light be spun into a thread;
Reason into a bead be thickened;
Ninety Infinities drawn on the Limb;
Still all is too short to take the height of him:
Our feeble sight
Cannot view his Light,
Nor can his Altitude
By any Art of Man be showed:
He is not Mighty, he is Might,
He is not Righteous, but Right'ousness;
So strong as on Great Sinners to do right,
So Just as not the Small ones to oppress:
24. To such, to such a Deity
Each honest soul due homage trembling pays;
He slights the wombs of Policy
And temples crowned with well-deserved Bays.
38, 39, 40, 41.
1. THus he; and then a sudden storm arose,
And out of the whirlwind God to Job replied,
2. What is the man's design,
The thing he clearly should define
In obscure not'ons thus to hide?
Why does the fool still talk more than he knows?
3. Come, for a dispute prepare,
Show how Rat'onal you are,
And answer to the Quest'on I propose:
4. Where were it Atome-thou? rehearse;
What pore contained thee,
When I gave order to a point to be
The Basis of the Universe?
I wisdom had, and showed the same
In forming this so glor'ous frame,
Thou by telling how show thine;
5. Who was 't did thus indeed (...)?
What Mason used plummet here or line?
6. What Is this huge building founded on?
Who was it laid the cornerstone?
If thou art able to divine, divine:
7. Who was it first bade things to be,
When the Spheres had their Harmony,
And many Morning-stars in consort joined,
When th'Heav'nly-high-born Family
Into one shout its var'ous joys combined?
8. Pray satisfy me who was he
Who first of all the uncheck't Sea
Up in its caverns pent?
Who was 't an Order sent
Unto the waves only thus far to come,
When they sought for themselves a vent
And brake from their old home
As if some new-made warry Element
Issued out of Natures womb?
9. I did an Atmosphere provide
To cloth as 'twere my fluid creature round,
Which when the night the same does hide
Now in its darker colored swaddling bands is bound;
10. I dug the waters room to tumble in;
Their title to the space they hold
Being as strong as old
By my decrees and with them did begin;
I placed smooth sands, and craggy shores
To be in stead of bars and doors;
11. I gave command,
Sea, here arrive, and here arrived stand,
Thy tenth and proudest wave
Shall no farther passage have,
I Will let it dash against, but not o'r flow this strand
12. Have thou since thy being born
Unto the dawning Morn
Its way to the Horizon showed?
Have thou enjoined the Sun
His diurnal race to run,
And rise at such or such an Amplitude?
13. His light scarce ends where Nature ends,
And its dominion o'r the World extends;
It makes the sky so clear,
Dark works soon with their Authors disappear:
14. What the seal is to the clay
To the Creat'on is the Day,
When that about the air does flow
The several parts their figures show,
The Orbs their blue, the Fields their green display:
15. Those wretches with whose will the Sun never shone
They Would have no light, they shall have none;
Their day shall yield to the incroaching shade,
And their puissant arm drop from their shoulder blade:
16. Have thou ever been
Where the Ocean does in bubbles rise?
Have thou so much salt water seen
That thy discoveries.
To draw a perfect Chart suffice?
17. Did ever Fate
Show thee her iron grate?
Or did thou of that place a view ever take
Through which she does such frequent sallies make?
18. Did ever thy Mathematics try
How far Nature walks in dry?
If thou have found the Earths extent,
Come, publish thy Experiment;
If thou do want a pupil, here am I:
19, 20. Direct me where the Day does dwell,
And show me whereabouts is Nights dark cell;
Alas! thou do not know, thou can not tell;
Have thou by thee
A draught of its Ichnography?
Have thou an Itinerary
Where-in a passenger may read
What paths, what turnings thereunto do lead?
21. Know thou where Light and its Privat'on be
As one that did them in their cradles see,
And come something near Eternity?
22. Did ever survey my treasuries of Snow,
Or the Exchequer where my Hail does grow?
23. These I reserve against those bloody days
When Wars harsh notes drown Peace's gentler sways,
When private fact'ons public tumults raise,
When showers of darts eclipse those Midday-rays
Which glittering Armor helped to blaze,
When here the Sword, and there the Engine slays,
And then this my Artillery from Heaven plays;
24. How parts the old night from the infant day?
How comes the dawning light to climb the skies?
How is it it finds so readily its way
While the East Wind does Cosmically rise?
25. Who taught the water into drops to grow,
And the fields so neatly wash?
Who added Mot'on to that flash
Which still accompanies the thundering blow;
26. That so the heaven may send down showers
Upon that wild and barren ground
Where no inhabitant is found
And whereupon no mortal water poures;
27. That so the thirsty earth may drink,
And the drops which down into her sink
May be again returned herbs and flowers?
28. Whom does the rain its Father call?
From whose loins is it the Dew does fall?
29. In whose close matrix did the Ice ever grow?
To whom does Frost its generation owe?
30. The Sea consistent now, fluid before,
How cur'ously it is enameled over!
31. Look where the Sev'n bright Sisters are
From your Aldebaran not far;
Can you any hindrance bring
Unto their shine
As that they shall not make fine
Their Lady Spring,
Nor teach the airy Choristers to sing?
Yonder Is Orion glitters in the sky,
His Girdle's hung with Frost, and Snow, and Hail;
Can thou that Girdle ever unty
That these may all asunder fly,
And so the Winter they compose may fail?
32. Have you such power or th'Southern hemisphear
As to make Mazzaroth appear,
And usher in the hot part of the year?
Do you remember him to take his turn,
And with the burning Sun to burn?
Every one knows the rich-imbossed Wain,
Hard by Arcturus may be seen as plain
Betwixt the logs of the renowned Swain;
Thy sons were all at once extinct,
His sons yet re'lly never winkt;
Can thou sons and fire so drive
That while they hasten to look on
Summer sooner may be gone,
And its successor Harvest sooner thrive?
33. Have thou the true, true Systeme of the Wo^d?
Know thou how the Planets dance,
Now retreat and then advance,
Hither and thither but in method hurled?
Can solve their mot'ons and not fly to Chance?
Do thou dispense
To Intersect'on-lines,
To Horoscopes and Signs,
To Opposit'ons, Quartiles, Trines,
Their less or gre^ter Influence?
34. Will the Clouds with thy breath disso^ve?
Will they fall
When thou do it c^ll,
And in a sudden deluge thee involve?
35. Will Lightning at thy beck appear,
And to thy Summons answer Here?
36. Who gave the soul its Faculties?
Who made the He^rt
A Bank of Art?
Who bade that lump of flesh be wise?
37, 38. Wheres's he that can such skill attain
As that he can the clouds enumerate?
When showers the looser dust coagulate
And with their moist that is soft abate,
Where Is he that can heavens sluices shut again
Ere those vast bottles let fall all their rain?
39. Suppose the Lions meat grow scant,
Will thou go catch his prey he cannot overtake?
Suppose his cubs their us'al morsels want,
Will thou for them provis'on make?
40. Close they lie within their den,
But when the prey is once in ken
They that are Couchant now, will soon be Rampant then:
41. Who is it feeds the Raven? who:
His young ones when they are hungry cry;
But, satisfy me, why
Unto the Deity;
Up and down for food they fly,
Every hole and corner try
Something that is eatable to spy,
But what is that Instinct moves 'um so to do?
1. ARe you the cunning man that knows
When the Wild-goats young will fall,
Whilst the rock we barren call
In a sense now fruitful grows,
Since the wild brood to it its as wild cradle owes?
Or are you he whose Calculat'on finds
When the infant-calves must drop down from the hinds?
2. Can you true reckoning keep
From the first time the Sal'ent point does leap
Till the eyes, the keel, the brain
And every part perfect'on gain,
And out into this light the fetus creep,
And tell the dams what hour shall end their pain?
3. They when their time approaches bend
And forth at once their burdens and their sorrows send,
4. Their young-ones have not long been born,
But quickly left forlorn
Away they hie
And feed upon loose ears of corn
Which scattered o'r the country lie;
Healthy, comely, strong they are,
And thrive on their ex-temp're fare;
The old-one when she did them bear
She had her pangs, her grief, her care,
But now ne r to return again they are fled
And trouble her no more in being bred:
5. See the wild Asses liberty,
Who gave it him but I?
I sent him out to feed, and he is gone,
Gone, and has no shackles on:
6. There where thy scent can nothing find,
There where thy skill can nothing carve,
Where there is naught to reap, and naught to grind,
But thou must pine away and starve,
Where thou can never keep thy self alive
There does this creature feed, and live, and thrive:
There where naught has ever been sown,
And less than naught has grown,
In those vast wildnesses where light scarce shone,
There lives this braying Monk alone
Who and his fellows me for their Great Founder own:
7. Far from the City and its dust he flies,
No Lorldly drivers o'r him Tyrannize;
8. The mountain's his, he traverseth the ground,
Food for the Ranger does therein abound;
No herb therein does rise,
But he the same espies,
No corner but into 't he pries,
No walks escape his feet, no herbs his eyes:
9. Will the brave Unicorn
Unto thy crib be sworn?
Will Not he thee and thy service scorn?
10. Will he be tied
Thy seed in softer earth to hide?
Will he ever endure to hale
Thy massy harrow o'r the plowed vale?
11. Thou will not think him fit for all his strength
Either to sow or re^p one length;
12. Nor trust him to bring home thy corn
And therewith thy c^p^c'ous barn adorn:
13. Spre^d'st thou those wings upon the Peacocks b^ck?
Or did thou the Ostrich fletch?
14. That simple wretch
Which does so due discret'on lack
She lays her eggs in the hot sand to warm,
15. Forgetting that they are there exposed to harm,
Which there the wild beasts feet may crush, their teeth may crack;
16. Within her Storgick mot'ons no more stir
Than if the steel she is thought to eat
Did turn indeed to meat,
Which meat must turn at last to her;
Her bowels yearn as little tw'ards her young
As if from thence they had not sprung;
Her Labour-p in
Is all in vain,
So little care of what she bears is t'ane;
16. Since God to her does not impart
An understanding heart,
Nor foldeth cur'ously enough her brain;
18. But then from hence
She has some recompense,
In that her streng^h so great appears,
That when the Warr'or mounts his Palfrey's back
She nothing of his height does lack
When aloft herself she rears;
Let horse and man
Do what they can
She none of these your Artific'al Centaures fears:
19. Made thou the Horse unc^p ble of ch^ck?
Did thou h^ng thunderbol^s about his ^eck?
20. Will he shun like a Grasshopper thy sight?
Can thou those terror breathing nostrils fright?
21. His play-fellow luxur'ant Earth he stri^es,
And tumbles in the valleys too and fro
Seeming his own strength to know,
And then his next sport is to charge the Pikes:
22. No otherwise does he know ^ear
Than we those things we mean to jeer;
Swords cannot stop him in his full career:
23. In vain the quiver rattles in the field,
In vain against him shine the Spear and Shield,
These may overcome his eye, never make his heart to yield:
24. Such is his fierceness, such his rage,
As if in jest his hunger to assuage
He Would make but just one morsel of the Earth;
The Trumpets mart'al threatening voice
To him 's no mart'al threatening noise,
It seems too musical, too full of mirth;
25. He answers the Tantara ra
With a re-ecchoing Ha, ha;
And noses Skirmishes afar;
When the Commanders hollow,
And the commanded Leg'ons follow,
He understands the language of the Men of War:
26. Do thou the Hawk inspire
And teach her her swift flight to take,
To spread her wings and Southward make
Toward the Middle Zone's refreshing fire?
27. Does the Eagle mount
On thy account,
Mount so high
As if she 'd fly
To that part of the Starry sky
Where we her glittering mate descry,
And there with him make a new Gemini?
Do thou direct her on the cliffs to lie
And plant her feathered nursery
There whither thou can reach neither with hand nor eye?
28. The rock so steep
That thither no Terrestr'als creep,
This is her house, her cit^del,
Here the Royal fowl does dwell
Here she her Court does keep;
29. No sooner has any poor bird
In the Aires vast oc'an stirred,
But hence she kenns it with her piercing eyes,
Hence she sets out and makes it lawful prize;
30. Then home again she goes
And there her young ones shows
First to dare dip their bill
In the blood which she does spill,
Then sip, then sup, then drink thereof their fill;
A sure retainer unto those
Who make 't their trade and business to be killed and kill.
1. FVrther he pleased to go, and said;
2. Suppose an Earthen vessel not afraid
To strive with him who the frail thing has made,
Suppose that man with God should take the list
Am I so ignorant, alas!
That I must be informed of the case
By my contentious Antagonists?
Answer, who ever thou art, audacious Soul,
That dare thy Creator thus control:
3. The man of Pat'ence made reply,
4. I answer thee!
How can that be?
My Oratory is as bad as I;
As I have lived, just so I speak,
And therefore will not silence break,
But rather, having naught to say,
Knowing nor Elocutions intent,
Nor what 's by comely Gestures meant,
One of my own instead of all invent,
Whilst thus my hand upon my mouth I lay;
5. I blurted out an answer once before,
But I Will not do as I have done,
And now a new Exordium is begun,
But here will I leave off, and prate no more:
6. With that into these words the whirlwind broke,
Or rather God that in the whirlwind spoke;
7. Come, buckle to 't, and play thy part,
I by a Question or two
My skill will show,
Thou by thy Answers show thy art;
8. What? will thou undertake
What I shall order void to make?
Will thou my Right'ousness dethrone,
And then set up a new one of thy own?
9. Can thou destroy as God destroys?
Or can thou imitate his thundering noise?
Have thou an arm so long?
Have thou a voice so strong?
10. Array thy self with glory round,
With triple diadems be crowned,
Such lovely looks put on and such a grace
As to deserve the name of Boniface;
11. Let thy anger burn and glow,
And all about the world its fireballs throw;
Let Princes tremble at thy checks,
And trample thou upon Imperial necks;
The lofty ones do thou abase,
12. Those that with pride pufft up do fill much place
Contract into their own and lesser space,
Do thou the Spoilers spoil,
13. In deep dug dungeons make 'um sure,
Teach 'um for silver iron to endure,
With dirt their fine and stately countenance soil;
14. And then my self will do thee right,
I Will trumpet forth thy might,
I to the world will openly aver
Job, powerful Job 's his own deliverer:
15. Behemoth thy fellow creature see,
The ox does feed on grass, and so does he;
16. His loins a mine of iron prove,
He on his navel lays the stress,
Of all his force and heaviness,
As mighty Engines on their center move:
17. When he does wag his tail and fawn
A mighty Cedar seems to shake,
The sinews of his stones such figures make
As tangled skeins of wyre not thinly drawn,
18. All his flat bones are fl^kes of brass,
His oblong ones for iron ones may pass,
19. The clearest Hieroglyphick he
Of his Creators boundless power
And the Almighty One in Three
That built this fleshy tower,
When he built it did think fit
To leave a secret passage into it,
Which should be known
And accessable to none
But to himself and to his sword alone:
20. The hills which happy beasts as theirs do claim,
(Happy because themselves are not the game,)
Where-in they play,
And safely may,
For Tyrant-hunters in the same
No pits do dig, no gins do frame,
All in these not more high than fruitful grounds
Fodder for Behemoth and them abounds;
21. Among the reeds at night he lies,
Where the trees whose pleasant shade
The setting Sun so long has made
To cover him may now suffice;
22. The trees are m^de his canopy,
And if you look
Along the brook
His willow-woven curtains there you see:
23. To quench his thirst down he does rivers take,
And will not run
When he has done
The owners of the ground to shun,
But half another draught of Jordan make;
24. His eye first drinks it up,
Then he himself begins to sup
Till he have supt it all away,
Nor can snares his passage stay,
For with his useful snout
He digs himself a safe and certain passage out.
1. VVIlt thou to Sea, thou silly man,
And angle for Leviathan?
Will thou design
To catch him with a casting-line?
2. Will he with a bait be took?
Will thou delight
To see him bite,
And then strike through his jaws thy hook?
3. Will he a petit'on make,
And beg of thee for pity's sake,
And with a Pray Sir his long silence break?
4. Will he require
Thou should him hire
To serve thee for a certain time?
5. Or will he choose
As Sparrows use
Up thy beck'ning hand to climb?
Will he be prisoner in a cage,
And with his cheerful folly
Thy doting Melancholy
And thy young daughters childish grief assuage?
6. Will your cunning Merchants join
And what of him is sweet
Turn that to meat,
And what is otherwise to coin?
7. Can thou with javelins tipped with steel
Fill his back and belly full?
Can thou take spears which others quickly feel
And therewith pierce this fishes scull?
8. Rather forbear, since he is above your match,
And no new stratagems against him hatch;
The other bout
You had the rout,
And all the power you brought was broke;
Therefore in time give over,
Hold up your hand no more
Unless therewith to g'him a gentle stroke:
9. Hope the victory to gain
Fixes her Anchors in his sides in vain;
His looks alone, his very fight
The confidentest Combatants affright;
10. There 's none that dare so much as try his rage,
There Is none dare with Leviathan engage;
How mighty then and terrible am I,
Who stockt him with such terribility?
11. What he is or ever can be
He stands engaged for it to me,
Though I to others do not so;
He owes me all who nothing owe,
Who Landlord am all earth, all heaven over,
And therefore cannot run on score:
12. His members, and the strength those members have
I will describe who one and to other gave;
Nor will I spare
His rarest beauty to declare,
Or to set out those Symmetries
Wherein that beauty lies:
13. Where are the men so bravely bold
That they dare his back bestride,
And rein him in so long till they behold
What kind of stuff his nakedness does hide?
14. Where 's he that will such valor show
As to un-hasp the casement of his eye,
Or make his mouths vast portal open fly,
And so expose those more than tusks to view?
15. If on his scales an eye he chance to cast,
How the proud fish it self does please!
Art never sealed any thing so fast
As Nature seals these;
16. They 're riveted so close together,
Having betwixt them such a little space,
Gross Earthy bodies through them cannot pass,
Nor Airy atoms neither;
17. Any external force sufficient
To drive these hither,
Send those thither,
Contrary unto Natures first intent,
They neither do nor shall they find
Till at the great approaching day
All things else as well as they
Shall so dissolve as never to be again rejoined:
18. His neezings make the air so bright
As if the purgings of his head were Light;
And when he opens his eyes
Two Suns at once seem to arise:
19. Perchance you have been told
Of Dragons never used to sle^p,
And therefore fondly thought to keep
Orchards whose Apples are of Gold;
How coals out of their nostrils fly,
How their breath o'recasts the sky;
Fables of them in him are History;
If he but breathe
20. Some caldron seems
While it does seethe
To rarifie whole Oc'ans into streams,
21. The Fume which from his mouth he sends
Is Met'oriz'd by its own heat,
Though mariners which on their poop do see it
Shall never know any good that it portends:
22. Strength in his thick neck does dwell
As in her royal citadel,
And that which others mourn at he likes well;
His clods of flesh so fast are tied
As one from to other never to slide;
24. A rock supplies him in the place of heart,
25. And mighty ones when he approaches smart;
Those that to yield to him refuse
He does so wound, he does so bruise,
That for to wash away the putrid stuff
The water that he swims in 's scarce enough:
26. The trusty blade
Which ever at him made
Returning does to shivers fall;
From his unhurt unpierced side
Long darts and longer javelins glide,
As feeble rays do from a w^ll;
27. What we count straw he iron counts.
Brass to no more than rotten wood amounts;
28. The barbed arrow he will meet,
Those sling-stones too
With scorn he ll view,
The force whereof in time a boy shall show
By laying therewith a huge Giant at his feet:
29. Whizzing darts he dares to court;
If you draw near
And brandish your death-threat'ning spear,
As fencers do, you will only make him sport;
30. Pieces of iron, heaps of stones,
Edged, pointed, sharp'ned ones,
They are as smooth as he will ever desire,
And down with him they go into the mire:
31. What it may be
That swells the Sea
By nice observers is not yet descried,
I tell y', he makes it boil, and that s the Tide;
The Oc'an he moves arises higher,
As water seething o'r the fire;
And when it with his sperm o'reflows,
It like a pot of ointment shows:
32. Where-e'r he swims there a new way is shown,
And all along that way
The Sea does look so gray
As if with its own Rag-wort 't were o'regrown:
33. Nothing like him
In the Sea does swim,
Nothing like him the Earth does bear,
Who wants that Epidemick Passion Fear;
34. Along the streets let the proud Peacock stalk,
Let the look't-on Lion walk,
Let the stately Pers'an Bride
Nothing of her glory hide,
Leviathan will go beyond them all in pride.
XLII.
1. It Is true, replied Job, it is true,
2. There Is nothing I can think but thou can do;
There Is no design, no secret plot,
Which thy Great Eye beholds not;
3. Oh how ridiculous is he
Who although ignorant he be,
Yet will strange not'ons and hard words devise,
That so the vulgar may account him wise?
How bravely I have talked it all this while!
How rich my matter, and how high my style!
All I have uttered alas!
I understood not what it was;
I ment'on'd matters in my cur'ous speech
Which never came within my Judgments reach;
4. But I have done, oh thou All-knowing One,
Be thou now pleased to take the Chair alone;
And let my doubts be satisfied from thence,
For I desire Zetetick to commence:
5. Thy Fountain-Glory fills my open eye,
Of which I heretofore did only hear:
Reflection brought thee then unto mine ear,
I do thee now Directly soy:
6. When Heaven and Time began their round
Thou call'dst, and at the powerful sound
Out of the dust in Paradise
I in my Great-great-grandsire had my rise;
And now that thou again do call,
And do appear
In glory here,
Into my dust again I fall;
Shame forces me
At sight of thee
Ashes both to put on and be:
7. Thus Job was lesson'd by the Deity,
And thus to his great Master answered he
Then God with Eliph^z begun,
I Am angry with thee (thou bold Temanite)
And with this Shuhite, that Naamathite;
Your dealing with your neighbor was not right,
You have into too bitter language run,
You have not spoke so well of me as he has done,
8. Sev'n Rams and seven Bullocks therefore take,
And all upon my Altar lay,
But get the Sinner Job to pray,
He the burnt beasts a Sacrifice must make;
He shall intercede for you,
Three for one man's sake I Will spare,
Else if your selves still surlily ye bear,
I Will punish this your present sin and former too:
9. They did as they from heaven were taught,
Their Bullocks and their Rams they brought,
And Job their pardon soon attained;
10. Who whilst he prayed for his friends
God turned the tide, and made him full amends;
What he had lost was but the half of what he gained
11. And then came all that were to him of ki^
And all his old acquaintance in,
And down with him to dinner sat;
Their table-talk was to debate
The strangeness of this turn in his estate;
How little lately, how much now he had;
They showed themselves for his Afflictions sad,
And for his Restaurat'on as glad;
It was indeed unheard of misery
Into which he had bean cast,
But it was gone, but it was past,
Thus did they urge and try to be
Far better Comforters than were the other three.
Nothing for Job was thought too dear;
They all for presents Coins did bear,
And Golden Pendants to adorn ^is ear:
12. Thus the grievous flood was o'r,
Which much improved the ground
That it so long had drowned,
Thus Job again with all things did abound,
Heaven adding to his former store,
To his Sev'n thousand Sheep Sev'n thousand more,
His Camels from Three -- to Six thousand grew,
For every Two he could Four Oxen show,
And then She-Asses twice as before as before:
13. Sev'n other hopeful Sons sprung from his bed;
And Three more Daughters in the others stead;
So fair that from their faces
Greek Painte^-poets drew their Graces;
14. The first appeared so bright
Her Father for her luster called her Light;
The next so sweet and delicate
He pleased Cass'a her to nominate;
The youngest was well known to Fame
By bearing Beauty's Cornu-cop'a in her name:
15. So illustr'ously they shone
As'a all Three for Par gons did own;
How to put down the Argent day,
How to baffle Verdant May
They gave example unto all, but took from none;
And Job, when Lands to's Children he assigned,
Had their Relat'on to him in his mind,
But their ignobler Sex forgot;
So each according to their lot
Females as well as Males possess'ons got:
16. Now, now does Job in state and glory sit
Monopolizing bliss,
The Universe is his,
H'has Gold enough at least to purchase it;
Gold, with their several portions in which
Fourth-generat'on heirs are growing rich;
And whilst the moving Source of heat
Sev'n-score times does Northward climb
And to the South as often retreat
It always finds him in his prime:
No sitting on the dunghill now,
For potsheards now no more he seeks;
No briny showers water his blubbered cheeks,
No cares enlarge the furrows of his brow:
Of grief there is no Cause nor Sign,
None all his family through-out repine;
Only his Grand-childs Grandchild cries
That piece of him which in the cradle lies;
17. And now decrepit Age does throw
Upon his happy head her welcome Snow,
With which he kindly melts away at last, and dies.
FINIS.
