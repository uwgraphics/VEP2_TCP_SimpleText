THE MOCK-DUELLIST, OR, The French Vallet. A COMEDY.

Acted at the THEATER ROYAL, By his Majesty's Servants.

Written by P. B. Gent.

Licensed May 27. 1675. Roger L'Estrange.

LONDON: Printed by J. C. for William Crook, at the Green Dragon without
Temple Bar. 1675.

TO THE VIRTUOUS ACCOMPLISHED Lady, MADAM S. C.
MADAM,
THe French Vallet, according to his natural Insolence, throws himself at your
feet; not in his broken English, with a Begar Madam, me voul ave it de so, but
in that Dialect used by the most refined Wits, -- Vous supplye tres humblement
Le regarder d'un aspect favorable.

Which blessing he vows is a sufficient saveguard against those three
Fatalities of Books; Envy, Spite, and Malice. I know, Madam, that to have
shrouded under your generous protection all that the greatest Gallantry of the
two most Polite Nations of the world could have wound up to the highest
sublimity of Wit, had worn some face of Justice, which might have rendered the
presumption excusable; it being so generally known, that none with more reason
than your self, could undertake the Censure of what is so much your own; I mean
La parfaite cognoissance du beau Monde. But Champagne's Crime can plead no
excuse; and being beyond the reach of ^rdinary Clemency, can have no other
hopes, than in that goodness which shines with so much Luster ^hroughout all
your actions. Take pity of him, Madam; and while your hand is in, pardon also
the ^iberty which his Advocate takes, of subscribing himself,

Madam, Your most humble Servant, P. B.

THE PROLOGUE.
YE who will judge, and ye that can indeed,
(And Right, rather than long Prescription plead,)
To both we equally do bow this night,
Owning the Power of one and th'other's right.
Our Poet says, h'as brought you a new Play,
Or if no new dish -- dressed another way,
And better too, he thinks -- Plot, Humor, Wit,
(The Devil's in it if it do not hit)
Leading you not through horrid rugged ways;
Knows better how to please, than to amaze.
Of Lines of Wonder you have had enough,
That pose your Intellect, and the Authors too;
And to this Ages spite will live perplex't,
To dare the Understanding of the next.
His easier Scene no big-swoln rumbling speaks,
That while you look on it, like a Bubble breaks,
Tumbling along with an amazing noise;
But his accoast is gentle Nature's voice.
In this conceit he brisks, begins to swell,
And swears he shall come off at least as well
As some applauded Freemen of the Trade,
Whom neither Art nor Nature Poets made.
'Twere brave if 't would go thus, and you should be
Persuaded to believe't as well as he.
But he will go less; for all this little Huff,
At other intervals he is tame enough,
And wisely then considers what is due*
From his bold weakness, to such Powers as you;
You whose Prerogative is understood
To give the stamp, and make the Mettle good,
With Privilege as great and unconfined
As his, who Leather into Money coined.

ACT I. SCENE I.
Shift, Thief. Shift. ONce more I tell thee, Boy, thou shall have Gold:
Will thou not take my word? By these two Relics.

Thief. Prithee hold fast; thou have but little hold.

Shift. Why, there is the thing, that is it whets my revenge;
The little flesh I lost on either side,
Through the severity of old Sir Amorous
The Justice that lives in that Corner-house,
Has swollen my spleen to that excess of rage,
That nothing but the greatest of Revenge
I can invent, is able to allay it.

Thief. It was sharp dealing, I must needs confess.

Shift. Most certain. Hear, what I Have already done
In order to this business.

Thief. Out with it, man.

Shift. I am of late possessed with the affections
Of a young Lady at a Boarding-school,
Who, notwithstanding her severe restraint,
Has made a shift to give me her consent
To Marry me.

Thief. To Marry thee, say thou?
In The name of Fortune, for what do thou pass?

Shift. For nothing less than a Lords younger Brother,
What with my Tongue, my Person, and Gay Clothes:
My stories have so tickled her young heart,
She wishes hard this day be at an end,
That in the darkness of the succeeding night
I might (as I have promised) steal her hence.

Thief. But what is all this to Sir Amorous Frost?
Let Us hear what thy revenge prompts thee to do.

Shift. Why thus: in this servile sort of disguise
Thou see, I have oftentime met our Justice;
As often pre-possest him with the love
Of my new Miss unto his Worship's person;
Insomuch, that what with Letters and Bills,
Together with some other circumstances
Too long to tell, I have so filled his head
With fingle-fangles, that he is resolved
This night (through her desires, as he thinks)
To get her off, by a Ladder of ropes,
And then to marry her. Now comes the sport:
Get you in readiness, 'twixt two and three
This very night, half a dozen stout Lads
Fitly disguised to act the Watch-mens parts;
Your rendezvous shall be at the street-end.
Fail not in this, and leave me to the rest.
I had almost forgot to let thee know,
That French man whom I cunningly got off
The last Sessions but two*

Thief. An excellent Rogue!

Shift. I have disposed of to our Amorous Knight,
As a present from his Miss.

Sir Amorous, Champagne. Look, look, yonder he comes; step you aside:
We'll both in here, and mark what he will do.
Sir Am. Come, come, turn out I say.

Champ. Jerny me voul
Et den your Madmoisel turn de you out:
Begar me go tell de her you no propre
To make de Gentleman; you no most have
De French Vallet, dat is geanty, galland,
No fit for de you dat: Jerny most have
De doll, de Diable, de simple English man
To serve de you, dat can no tesh de you
De Gallantry; no so mosh as de spoke.
Fee, fee, begar, no me shame for de you
Jerny, me voul go, no.

Sir Am. Should he in spite
Aside Go tell my Mistress this, it might spoil all,
When I consider that she put him to me,
By the means of her confident, that man
Who interchangeably conveys our Letters,
The sole Correspondencie we ever had,
Through her severe restraint: I must submit.
Champagne, do but reflect on what you have done.
You Have stolen my Linen, lost your Hat and Clothes,
Spent all that Money I Would given you to lay out,
Which was five or six pounds.

Champ. Me lay it ote, Jerny.

Sir Am. On your own self, and give me no account.
Home you come naked, hundred Boys at your heels;
Then fit your self afresh from my best store,
All without License.

Champ. Begar, it is no de fasson
De Franshe serviteur de ask de permission;
Look de your Papier, and you voul see
It is de me devoir to sheet de you.
Begar, you no understand de Civilite
Francoise; you call de sheet, dat is simplement
De gaillardise, de tour d'addresse, Jerny.
It is meskin, begar.

Sir Am. I must be quiet,
And for the present wink at all his faults;
But time will come, I shall alter the Scene.
Well, well, Champagne, upon condition
That for the future you will live orderly,
All shall be now forgot. I will allow you
A Crown a day, and you shall promise me
That you will be honest, and cheat me no more.

After a pause, Champ. Champ. Vell, tosh de la? do me lose be de bargain,
Me vould oblige de you. Come, give l'argent.

Sir Am. Well, well, let us in, and I Will give it thee there.

As Sir Am. is going in, Shift steps to him, and gives him a Letter. Sir Am.
Another Letter?

Shift. Lest the former should fail,
In speaking not clear enough her intentions.

Sir Am. How does she do? Does she look briskly on it?
Thou see I do: speak; Is she cheerful, man?

Shift. As her Impatiencie, Sir, will permit.

Sir Am. Take this for thy reward.

Shift. I thank your Worship.

Sir Am. It Is a very small hand: where are my Spectacles?
Now let me see.
My dearest Knight;
Since you have been so punctual to observe all my Injunctions, I can no more
doubt of your real Affections; I shall think the time long till I am clasped
within the loving Circle of your arms. This night if you will come to receive
me as yours, 'twixt one and two, I shall impatiently expect your presence at
the second window next the Garden, where you will find

Yours wholly, Kath. Noble.



Sir Am. Let me see that again?
Yours wholly, Kath. Noble? it is just so.
I must not doubt your secrecy in this?

( To Shift. Shift. I Will be as secret to you as your thoughts.

Sir Am. It Is very well; that Virtue is a Jewel
Which must be set in Gold. Here, take the rest.
Only an earnest of my future love.
Thou must assist me in this my design,
In this Amorous Theft.

Shift. Sir, I am yours.
I Will not be wanting: be you but disguised,
And I Will secure you all.

Sir Am. Trust me for that
I can do it naturally, as it were.
What odd disguise do thou think would do best?

Shift. A woman's dress, nothing were better, Sir.

Sir Am. Thou Art in the right: but how should I come by it
Without suspicion?

Shift. Leave that, Sir, to my care.

Sir Am. I prithee do, and be sure not to fail
Precisely at the appointed time and place.

Shift. I Would as soon disappoint a Rich young wife,
As fail your Worship, Sir. This night at two
I shall be punctual, Sir -- to plague your heart.

Exit Shift winks at Champ. Sir Am. Champagne, come here.
How do thou like me now?

Champ. O! ver vell --
Begar you look de no, Justement,
Comme de young Gallant: you have de odre day*
De bougre de hair all vitt, et no you have
De Peruque frisee; you vant
No more, Jerny, que de feat, vensh et drink.

Sir Am. Fight, wench, and drink? I Am old-dog at that.
This Love is a strange thing: I Am young again.
Henceforth to Justice I must bid adieu;;
That becomes not my Youth. Judge thou Champagne
Whether this Wig and Suit would fit the Bench.

Champ. No par ma foy, es bettre too sand tim
For de la Commedy*

Sir Am. How do I walk?

(Struts. Champ. O ho! me tosh you dat.

Sir Am. And sing? fa-la-la-la-

Champ. Me tesh you dat.

Sir Am. And fence? ha ha!

(Makes a Pass. Champ. Me tesh you dat.

Sir Am. Oddsniggs* I had forgot
My French, Champagne.

Champ. Oh! me no tesh* you dat.
Odnigg, odnigg, dat pitiful, Jerny,
Dat justement come de poor diable.
Alon donc? Qu'on prenne sa lecon
Par la Mort, par la Test.

Sir Am. Par la Mort, par la Test.

(Sir Am. say after him. Champ. Bon, Jerny.

Sir Am. Bon Jerny.

Champ. Aye? no say bon Jerny.

Sir Am. Aye? no say bon Jerny.

Champ. Diable soit de la best.

Sir Am. Diable soit de la best.

Champ. Ah! Jerny, holl, holl: no say after me,
Stops Sir Am. mouth. Je done au diable Mademoiselle.

Sir Am. Je done, etc.

Champ. Si je ne suis le plus humble serviteur.

Sir Am. Si je ne suis, etc.

Champ. De tous les serviteurs de vos Valets.

Sir Am. De tous les serviteurs, etc.

Champ. Very goot! alon, encore!

Sir Am. Very goot, alon, encore.

(Stops Sir Am. mouth. Champ. Non! Mademoiselle je suis rany d'avoir done
Jusques dans la Contre escarpe de vos bonnes graces.

Sir Am. Mademoiselle, etc.

Champ. Fort bien? no for de dance, Alerte Jerny.
Stand de you very strait, just come de me.
So, very goot.

(dance. Stands stooping. Sir Am. Now let me see whether I have observed
Exactly her Commands: this is her Note,
Written with her own hand. In the first place,
(Kisses the Note. You are to be apparelled in the French Mode,
To have this French Vallet, Companion rather,
Who is to teach you to Dance, Sing, and Fight,
To speak a Norman, or a Gascon French;
To Swear and Curse, in the same Dialect;
And cheat you of your Linen, Clothes, and Cash,
Before your face; at which you must but laugh.

Champ. Oh! O! do you see no? pray observe dat.

Sir Am. And swear by Jove, it is a witty Knave.

Champ. Un Crown de day? me loose be de bargain.

Sir Am. Then I must have you court some Gaysome Lady,
To accustom your self against you have me.
Jerny, Champagne, je had forgot this last.
Have vous incontinent to Monsieur Coggin,
Et know quand je can wait upon the Madmoisell.
Madmoisell Phill. Airy, pour kiss her bais les mains.

Champ. Ha! ha! ha! me go presentement.

(Calls back Champ. Sir Am. Champagne, did thou not laugh at me, just now?

Champ. Ma foy un little.

Sir Am. There Is for thy pains. Be gone.
At thy return thou't find me in the Hall.

Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Street.
Per. Phill. Phan. and Siss at a distance. Per. in a Riding habit; the Women in
Morning-dresses, and Vizard-masks. Phill. I Had intelligence a fortnight since
Of his coming to Town to woo the Widow.

Per. The Widow Lovewealth, say?

Phill. The very same
Which put me on the business you shall hear.

Per. Out with it; I long to hear't.

Phill. Thus in short.
You are to know my adversion toward Crosby
Being grown up unto a hatred of him,
By the sad narrative which Madam Phanny
Had made me of his base treachery toward her,
Caused on the other hand a sudden growth
To those well-wishings I had for Sir Coggin
Into affections --

Per. Otherwise called Love.

Phill. It shall be what you please. This made me seek
All handsome means to break off those concerns
Which my Knight had, with th'interest Lady Lovewealth.
I soon made with his Sister a firm league,
And did so order things, it is now a week
That I lie in their Lodgings, where I have had
More opportunity to work my ends.
Last night I did contrive so, that a Letter
Was delivered into Sir Coggins's hands
In presence of me, with this Message to it*
That it was sent from an unknown Lady*
In which was mentioned, that he should meet this day
In the Piazza at four a clock a person
That likely would inform him of some things
Of his nearest concerns. He read the Note,
And presently assured the Messenger
He should not fail the assignation.
I had just parted with him, when I met
Timothy Clay, with his Man and his Dog,
Inquiring earnestly of each he met
Concerning me, who was but just gone by*
When I met you.

Per. Well, but what said Sir Cogging?
Did he not know thee, think?

Phill. Not in the least.
I told him in a counterfeited voice,
The Lady Lovewealth did despise him so,
That a Rival was entertained by this
In his own room: if therefore he would desist
His pursuit in that place, a worthy Lady
Would entertain his Love, who surely had
Such an esteem for's person, as would amount
To the making him her Husband.

Per. What said he?

Phill. I did not give him time, but added strait,
That if he would meet me in that place again
'Twixt five and six, I should inform him further.
To which he answered, that he would not fail.

Per. How durst thou venture thy self all-a-lone
Without company with thee? Where is Siss?

Phill. Those two persons you see there --

Per. Who be they? Do thou know them?

Phill. Yes, I do.
The one is Madam Phanny, the other Siss.
Thus all-along they have kept me company,
At such a distance as you see they observe.
Enter Clay, Clunch, and Dog. Here Is Tim. Clay, Brother, we must not be known.

Per. Let me alone for that: art sure it is he?

Phill. My life on it, man. It Is best I should retire,
And leave him to your handling: if he bite,
Bring him in the back-way, there I Will confirm
Whatever you have said.

Per. Say no more, wench.

Exeunt Woman. Clay. Do you know our Neighbor?

Clunch. Where she lives?

Per. Perhaps I might, did I but know her name.

Clay. Why her name is pretty Mistress Phill. Airy.
What say you now?

Per. That I do know the person;
And if you please, I shall conduct you to her.
I am her servant, Sir,

Clay. Say thou me so, friend?
A-gad-a-mercie fecks; give him a groate,
Clunch; come, dispatch, a shall have a gray groate.

Clunch. Oye, oye, soft there, pray let him earn it first.

Clay. But hark you now, what kind of servant pray?

Per. My Profession, Sir --

Clay. Oye, oye, let us hear, what is that?

Per. Is to instruct both Gentlemen and Ladies
In The art of Compliments; besides, I show
To such strangers as you, the Town and Court,
The Gallantry thereof, and the Intrigue --

Clay. Intrigue? what place is that?

Per. By that I mean
Th'ingenious conversation 'twixt the Wits
Of either Sex, both in the Court and City.

Clay. You say that you teach Compliments?

Per. I do so, Sir.

Clay. Why then I Will tell you friend, 'twixt you and I,
I Am come to town to court a certain Lady,
Who is already courted to my hands;
But that for fashion-sake (a murrain on it!)
I must bestow some few upon her Chaps.
Therefore, if you can help me to a brase
Of The newest of them at reasonable Rate,
I Will be your Chapman: I have money enough;
Have I not, Clunch?

Clunch. Why, who dares question that?

(Holds up his Bat. Per. I do not in the least.

Clunch. You were not best.

Per. But so few Complements, I am afraid
Will scarce serve turn.

Clay. Then keep them to your self,
For I could never yet learn how to write,
Scarce how to read; and do you think that I
Will burden my membry with Complements?

Per. What if I teach you the new Mode of Courtship,
In which you will need but one single Complement,
And all the rest is voluntary Wit?

Clay. I marry, now you say something indeed;
But what do you mean by voluntary Wit?

Per. It Is high Hyperboles, Anglice Nonsense.
No matter, Sir, how wide it is from the matter,
So you but keep your Countenance, go on,
And scarce take time to breathe.

Clay. Those what you call --
Hyper-bullies, and Anglice Nonsense,
I shall never learn without book, I Am afraid.

After a pause. Per. Well, Sir, suppose I have a way for that?
What can you then object?

Clay. I am not, Sir,
For your objects, I Am for one Complement:
And if so, why then so. Fecks you and I
Will be better acquainted.

Per. Well, in short,
Because we are strangers to one another,
For further satisfaction, if you please
To let me wait on you to the Lady Airy,
She will inform you of my Capacity
In my Profession.

Clay. Gad-a-mercie fecks;
A dad a speaks, Clunch, like an honest man:
Come, we'll along.

Exeunt. SCENE III. Lady Lovewealth's house.
Lady Lovewealth, Prew. Prew. I Hope your Ladyship will none of him.

Lady. Of whom talk thou?

Prew. Mr. Timothy Clay.

Lady. Thou silly thing! is he not wondrous Rich?

Prew. Yes, Madam, and that is all.

Lady. It Is all indeed:
For in that word is comprehended all
That I aspire at. Suppose he be
The ill-bred Chip of a rough-hewn block;
Impertinent, absurd, given to drink,
And to all sottishness; what is that to me?
I Will endeavor somewhat to polish him:
If I cannot succeed, he take that course,
And I will even take this --

Prew. Which, Madam, pray?

Lady. I Will give my self all the freedom I can
In modesty enjoy; take th'advantages
Of all his beastly extravagancies.
I Will insinuate my self i the management
Of the Estate; lull him asleep with ease;
Yield a full scope to all his appetites,
While I will work my ends, hoord up his Gold,
And spend on it at my list, on this, or that;
Eat, drink, wear what I please; as often change:
Go out, come in again, early or late,
Without control; have servants for my turn:
All this, and all things else, as I think fit.
What more can I desire? would he were come:
I long to see the man.

Prew. Sir Coggin, Madam,
Th'obliging Knight, what must become of him?

Lady. Faith, Prew, even as he pleases; here 'twon't
I Am for the Richest still.

Enter Boy. Boy. The Tailor, Madam
Has brought some Patterns for your Ladyship.

Exeunt. SCENE IV.
Per. Phill. Clay, Clunch and Tray. Phill. SIr, in a word, he is the only man
On all accounts of Gallantry, you could
Have pitched upon.

Clay. Avads I think a be?

Phill. And for your sake, I Will dismiss him my service;
He shall be wholly yours.

Clay. Neighbor, good thanks.
You hear, Sir? henceforth you are to be mine;
Our Neighbor says the word.

Per. Sir, I am yours.

( To Per. Clay. Why very well. Now, because I Am in haste,
I Would have you dogmentise me instantly.
Was not that a hard word?

Per. Most excellent!

Clay. Nay, sometimes I hit on um, do you see?
Come, give me some distructions.

Per. Very well.
Now, Sir, observe, since I Am fully informed
You do not care for troubling of your self
With Compliments, I Will teach you the new Mode
A la Soldate.

Clay. Hy-day! what is that, I pray?

Per. That is to say, Soldierlike Courtship, Sir;
A kind of rough-hewn way newly come up,
Which takes wondrous well in Court and City:
It Is generally used.

Clay. I long to know it.

Per. Why thus in short: suppose that Lady there
Were your Maitress

Per. comes up to Phill. in an affected way. Clay imitates redicul. Clay.
That Is Latin for my Lady?

Per. No, Sir, it is French: thus I make my approach.
It Is very well.

Clay. Nay fecks let me alone
To speak all the dumb Courtship, do you see?

Per. Thus having kissed her hand, you must begin
Your Compliment.

Clay. Cannot I do it without speaking?

Per. Not without speaking, Sir: but do you mark,
That you may have no use of memory,
I Will write you down a Compliment.

Clay. Nay, nay,
That will not do: for to tell you the truth,
I could never yet read a written hand,
Except it were in print.

Per. It shall be so.
This done, and handsomely conveyed within your hat,
Which holding thus you shall read to you Lady,
She knowing not but you deliver it

Viva voce -- Clay. That Is French again; oye oye.
Efecks it will be brave.

Per. Your Compliment
Delivered as is said, you must begin
Either to whistle, sing, hop up and down --

Clay. Or else play with my dog. But tell me though,
Suppose my Lady speaks some Complements
To me again, what then?

Per. Why, if she do,
She will not greatly mind what you will say,
Neither must you mind her.

Clay. It Is very true.
For why should I mind her, and she not me?
Let me alone for that. That is, you say --
A la -- what do you call it?

Per. A la Soldat.

Clay. I Will defy any single man in town
To do it better than I. Me thinks I Am at it.
Hie Tray! alas poor rogue!

(Struts and whistles. Per. That Is very well.
It is done to the life. After a while,
If you do find the Lady to be silent --

Clay. So let her be! so I would have her fecks.

Per. You must begin --

Clay. No Complements, I hope?

Per. No, Sir.

Clay. Nay, then it will do well enough.

Per. Only make use of some familiar talk:
As for example, What is most in fashion,
What News abroad, or else of some new Play.

Clay. Or of my dog Tray; or else, do you see,
Tell her how many Beasts, Sheep, Hogs; and Geese
My Father left me, besides, Money and Lands
In ready Cash.

Per. There Is nothing better, Sir.

Clay. But yet, suppose she has an itching mind
To Complement?

Per. Then you must let her know
That being of opinion that Complements
Are of too soft a nature for a man
(Especially of metal) for to use,
You Have hired me to supply in that part.

Clay. Effecks it will be rare.

Per. Then will I court --

Clay. The Lady, as for me.

Per. It Is very right.

Clay. Oddsniggs, I had forgot where we are to go.

( To Clunch. Where shall I meet you 'bout an hour hence?
Per. Sir, where you please.

Clay. Let it be in yond place --

Per. The Piazza, Sir.

Clay. Oye there an hour hence.
Neighbor Airy go to: you have won my heart,
With leaving me your man.

Phill. Your servant, Sir.

Clay. Nay, nay, no Complements; and so farewell.

Exeunt Clay, Clunch, Tray. Phill. Brother, what think you on it?

Per. Nothing but good.

Phill. In my opinion, if I ben't mistaken,
Here is a fortune flung into your arms:
You cannot avoid it man, it must be so;
You are the man designed to have the Lady
When all is done.

Per. I hope no less, e'faith,
As I shall carry it on: for I intend,
As you may well perceive by this beginning,
That under the pretense of good instructions,
I Will make this credulous shallow-pated fool
Appear to be such an impertinent Sot,
As will oblige the widow without doubt
To see her folly in it if she once moves.
Then will I take fair opportunity
By the fore-top, and speak to her for my self.
That, Girl, must be the way.

Phill. A good one too.
Where Is our brother Dick? would he were here:
Have you not heard of him?

Per. By the last Post.
This is the day he is to be in town.
The fatal pass, which so infortunately
He was compelled to make in's own defense
Upon his enemy, is no more thought on:
For underhand he has of late composed,
And (though with great expense) is gotten clear.

Phill. I fear of's money as well as his troubles.

Per. It cannot be helped.

Phill. He deserves better things.

Per. His Ingenuity will never let him want.

Phill. I hope 'twill not.

Enter Man. Man. Madam, Mr. Crosby
Demands admittance to your Ladyship.

Phill. Why let him come; I shall soon dispatch him.

Per. Mean time I Will go about the Compliment
Of such a nature --

Phill. Into my Closet there.

Exit Per. Enter Crosby. Crosby. Your humble Servant, Madam.

Phill. Your Servant, Sir.

Crosby. Madam, I come to ease my poor sick heart.

Phill. If you are serious, you will be best alone.
I have, Sir, other business now in hand.

Crosby. Let me beg you will be pleased but to consider,
You can have none that may with greater Justice
Be taken to your thoughts, than such a passion
As I have always manifested to you,
By the saddest protests --

Phill. Those you call such
I must suppose are of your making so,
Perhaps it is your custom: I not the first
To whom you have made those sad protests you call.

Crosby. Let me but only vent --

Phill. At leisure, Sir.
Exit Phrill
Crosby. There Is something more than ordinary in the wind.
Should she have had intelligence of late
Of my former Amors with Madam Phanny?
But how should she come by it? I need not fear't.
I must confess she ever did receive
All my addresses with reluctancie;
Would often twit me with her friends consent
Which I had got: but now of later days
She Has not so much as common complaisance.
Well, I Am resolved once more to see this Miss,
And pump out, if I can, the cause of this.
Exit.

Exit biting his fingers. SCENE II.
Sir Cog. leading Phill. Noble, Diana, Lysse, Siss.

Sir Cog. ON my word, Madam, there was no such thing.

Phill. But what then may it be?

(They whisper. Nob. Love, Madam, may,
And with such fierceness drive on these designs
As will compass his ends --

( To Sir Cog. Dian. Not always, Sir --
Brother, say what you please, but let me think:
Go out so suddenly, come home in dumps,
Have not a word to say; nay scarce afford
Common respect to your most worthy guests,
Is somewhat strange.

Phill. He knows I am not his,
But your poor tenant, Madam.

Sir Cog. I must confess,
That an odd business coming unexpected,
Has somewhat discomposed me for the present,
For which I humbly beg your pardon, Madam.

Phill. You have it;
But under favor, Sir, may we not know
What sort of business 'twas you had in hand?

Dian. I hope it was no quarrel?

Sir Cog. Not at all.

Phill. Was it not some gay Lady's assignation?
That Note that was delivered you last night,
In my mind, spoke so much.

Sir Cog. To tell the truth,
It was that very thing: I had intelligence
Of an amor.

Enter Boy: whispers Diana, and Phill. Exeunt Ladies. Diana. What now, Sirrah?

Sir Cog. Moving already, Ladies?

Phill. To th'next room.

Sir Cog. Once more, Sir, you are welcome to this house,
And wish you quick success in your addresses
Unto my Sister, who already's informed
Of your own worth; and do believe that she
Will not be o're-severe in the reception
Of your love beyond what is to be allowed
To the modesty of her Sex.

Nob. Your Generosity
Is so surprising, that I Am to seek for words
To return you those thanks that might proportion
With your civilities.

Sir Cog. You Are still beforehand: my Sisters Portion, Sir,
Is yet entire, though I Have had the misfortune
To loose my share of what we had inherited
From our Parents.

Nob. Had I any thoughts
That in the least should reflect upon interest,
'Twould render me unworthy the possessing
So rich a Jewel as that Lady, Sir.

Sir Cog. You Are too obliging, Sir, -- who have we here?

Sir Amorous leading Phill. and Diana singing. Sir Am. Falla-la-la; Jerny
Madmoisell vostre tres humble serviteur.
( To Phill. Niece! how is it, Girl? Monsieur je suis a vous.
( To Nob. Nephew! how do thou like this Peruque? ha!
This Trimming, Cravat, these Gloves, Sword and Belt?
The whole Apparel? hum? falla-la-la.

(Struts singing. Aside. Sir Cog. What the devil's the matter?
What your judicious Gravity approves,
I am not to contest --

Dian. Sure he is mad?

(Aside. Sir Am. I Have always told you, Nephew, that delays
Nob. courts Diana. Were ever of a dangerous consequence;
And now you are like to know it by experience.
You know how often I Have advised you to marry,
That I might see some likelihood of Heirs
To be successors to that fair Estate
I have acquired, by my assidual pains.
You have had time enough, yet nothing done: --
It Is those neglects of yours, have put me on
This great necessity of marrying
In these more riper years.

(Aside. Sir Cog. The wench guest well --
I suppose, Sir, this is to try me with?

Sir Am. Mistake not; I Am in earnest, and in haste.

Phill. Why, Sir, the Gentleman is young enough;
And his lost time may easily be repaired
(I Am of opinion) if it pleases him.
It Is in his choice yet, to outstrip you there.

Sir Am. Where, prithy? where?

Phill. I mean in Marriage, Sir,
My Knight takes me not yet; I dare no more --

(Aside. Sir Am. I thought you knew the person, I protest.
I shall scarce marry these three or four days,
And you may get a dozen wives by then;
(Scoffingly to Sir Cog. But he must make good haste, or come too short.

(Aside. Sir Cog. You say three or four days?

Sir Am. Yes, thereabouts.

Sir Cog. Well, Sir, will you but yield that if I marry --

Sir Am. The widow Lovewealth? I Will put a spoke there.

(Aside. Sir Cog. A Lady young and brisk, 'twixt this and when
You have appointed for your marriage-day,
You will --

Sir Am. I Will tell thee, nephew, what I Will do:
He that is first married of us two,
Shall bar the other from procuring Heirs
To my Estate.

Sir Cog. A match, a match, e'faith.

Phill. And if Sir Cogging, Sir, does get the day,
You Will declare him your Heir immediately?

Sir Cog. What say you, Sir, to that?

Sir Am. A match, a match;
I Will not deny you sweet: you must run post?

( To Sir Cog. Nobl. It Is very well.

Diana. We'll all be witness to it.

Sir Am. And to my wedding also morrow-morn.
To which you are all invited.

Sir Cog. How? so soon, Sir?
Y'allow'd a longer time.

Phill. Three or four days?

Sir Am. Nay, Sir, it is so; now make what haste you can;
Whip, whip, and spur, you had need, or lie behind.
I Will stick to the Contract; so Gentles, adieu.
Exit Am.
Sir Cog. What a mad Scene is this?

Diana. It Is unexpected --

Noble. And sudden too, I think.

Sir Cog. These the first news;
But now, what is to be done?

Phill. Even cross his Match.

Diana. But how is it to be done?

Sir Cog. We Are left in the dark:
Did we but know where he makes his address,
There would be some hopes yet.

Lysse. Sir, as for that,
I think I have a way which may succeed.

Sir Cog. Prithy what is it?

Lysse. You know, he has of late
Entertained a French servant.

Phill. What of that?

Lysse. The fool, who pretends kindnesses to me,
Is doubtless privy to his Masters love;
And if so, Sir, I make no question then,
But to get knowledge of this secrecy.

Nob. No better way.

Sir Cog. Lysse, if thou do this,
Thou will deserve our further care of thee.

Lysse. Let me alone to worm out this French fellow;
Sir, fear it not.

Exit Lysse. Phill. Come, cheer up, Sir.

Sir Cog. Madam, you may do so,
Who have assurances of your amors
By a Contract --

Phill. A Contract say you, Sir?
(Curse be the cause of this suspicion in him.)
(Aside. It Is with my Parents then, never with me.
And likely enough that bargain's yet to make
Between the Gentleman you mean, and me.

Diana. Brother, let me advise you strait to go
To the Lady Lovewealth; learn if 'twere the hopes
Of your Uncles Estate made her accept
The tender of your services, or whether it be
A real affection does cause her to have
An esteem for your person. If the last,
Inform her how you are driven --

Phill. Not amiss.
So now it works as I would have it, just.

(Aside. Sir Cog. Sir, if you please to honor me so far
As to lend me your company t'her house --

Noble. It must be then with these two Ladies leave.

Sir Cog. I Will but call by the way at the Rose-tavern.

(Exeunt Ladies. Noble. In the mean time, according to my promise,
I Will speak two words at the School in next street.

Sir Cog. Very well, Sir, we'll meet at the Piazza
An hour hence.

Noble. Till then, your servant, Sir.

Exeunt. SCENE III. The School-house.
Kitty Noble, at a window; Shift in the street, in a fine Garb. Shift. NOw I Am
a Prince again, in show at least.
Hem! hem!

Kitty. Hist, hist.

Shift. It Is I; is the coast clear?

Kitty. I Will look about -- I see none we may fear.
Why did you stay so long?

Shift. How does my Love?

Kitty. As well as hopes can make me,
And yet my thinks this day is cruel long.

Shift. It draws toward its end.

Kitty. Does the time hold?

Shift. 'Twixt two and three: be sure the ^^ght be out;
Our work requires none.

Kitty. How shall we do
To get off in the dark? the Moon by twelve
Will yield us no more light.

Shift. So I would hav't.

Kitty. It will be very dark: how shall I know
When you are come, or whether it be you?

Shift. Here, here; secure these half a dozen Keys:
When I am got up to the Ladder-top,
I Will in the Room, and seek you in the dark,
Where when you find you are taken by the hand,
Conclude it is I. By the help of these Keys
I Will open every door to the Garden-side,
And that way we'll get off. Speak not a word,
Nor whisper then.

Kitty. And where must we go then?
Not far, I hope.

Shift. Only to the Church Porch,
Where a Parson shall wait to tie the Knot,
And then --

Kitty. Away, away, the Beldam comes.

Shift. Farewell till night.

(Kitty shuts the window. Exit Shift. Kitty. Farewell.

SCENE. IV.
Noble, Crostitch. Crossed. FOr these same reasons, Sir, a stricter Eye
I Have kept upon her actions than before;
And till some two months since, or thereabouts,
I could not find she had any commerce
Beyond these walls; which made me grant to her
A little more liberty than before.
But it could not last long: for one bright night,
About the hour of two, I heard a noise
On the backside; I stole gently down stairs,
And there, you will scarce believe't --

Nob. Yes, I Will believe that she has not her like.

Crossed. I found the Gentlewoman
Letting down of a bucket full of stones
Into a Well.

Nob. How Is that, pray? full of stones?

Crossed. Yes, Sir.

Nob. For what?

Crossed. I stood still close behind,
And she was so attentive at her work,
That she perceived me not: now mark, I pray!
Anon at the other end of the Well-rope,
Up comes, what do you think, Sir? pray you guess.

Nob. The Devil sure.

Crossed. No, Sir, but one of's friends,
Dressed in a humane shape; a fine young man,
Who, as I thought, none but the Devil himself
Could have brought there. The Gallant spying me
Standing behind, twitches the rope she held,
And gently poises himself down again.
At this she turns, and so espies me out.
You must needs think she was much discomposed
At the sight of me?

Nob. I know not what to think.

Crossed. Wounderfully! she in a laughing tone
Cries out, E'faith, you came in the nick of time,
Or else by this, I Would gin you the go-by.
With that, in a great laughter up she runs,
Where having locked her self, she 'gan to sing,
Oh! Love is a dilicate thing. In The morning
I visited the Well, and in it found
Toward the middle, a window that did answer
Into a neighboring Vault. I had a pump
Set in the place, to prevent for the future
Such like attempts. Seeing no remedy
But close confinement of her in a Room
Under good locks and keys, I Have mewed her up,
Where she does still remain.

Nob. Cannot be helped.
I pray let her not know of my return
Till I see you again. Till then, farewell.
I see it is easier the Ocean to span,
Than keep by force a young maid from a man.

Exeunt severally. ACT III. SCENE I.
Crosby, as he is going in, meets Siss. Crosby. NOw for to know my doom. Your
Lady, Siss?

Siss. She Is gone to take the Air.

(Stops the Passage. Crosby. Come, let me in.
I shall grow angry else.

Enter Phill. Siss. Here comes some Rescue?

Crosby. Your obedient Servant, your Woman, Madam,
Denied you to me.

Phill. She did nothing, Sir,
But what she had in charge.

Crosby. Madam, it is like
(My fate's the harder) that I am ariv'd
Upon some newer interest.

Phill. Your own
Was not so considerable, Sir, before,
Nor had it so much name you need to fear
That any should succeed it.

Crosby. If there be any one dares own a favor
That Is to my prejudice, let him look, Madam,
You hide him in your bosom, if he would not
Have this sword through him.

Phill. Sir, you must prescribe
No Laws to me: that person I shall choose
To throw my favors on, shall know to answer
Whatever heats you bring.

Crosby. Why be it so.

Exit Crosby. Phill. This care is over.

Siss. A fair riddance, doubtless.

Phill. This is not all, I have another plot,
To bring about my ends 'twixt Madam Phanny,
And this unworthy man, that I must do,
Or I Have done nothing yet.

Siss. Seriously, Madam,
I pity that poor Lady at my heart,
She is so melancholy --

Phill. Where is she now?

Siss. At her old trade of weeping.

Phill. I Will cheer her up
E're long; if things do hit.

Siss. Pray Heavens they may.

Phill. Let Us in, and there consult with her about it,
Lest we be troubled with this impertinent.

SCENE II.

Exit Champ. SCENE III. Lovewealth's house.
Two Chairs. Lady Lovewealth, Prew. Lady. PRew? go to my Closet, and fetch me
the Letter
I now received from Sir Amorous Frost.
Exit Prew. It is both short and sweet. While I took care
How to dismiss Sir Coggin of his suit,
There is provision made; I need no more,
When he is come in, but to show him this Note:
Sure that will do it. How now?

Enter Boy. Boy. Sir Coggin, Madam,
Is new set down at door, desires admittance
To your Ladyship.

Lady. Why, bring him in -- that is well:
( To Prew. I am prepared.

Sir Cog. Noble. Sir Cog. Madam, I have made bold --

Lady. You have so, Sir.

Sir Cog. Yet I hope the offense
Is not so great but that I may find pardon?

Lady. It Is of that nature, Sir, as must not hope
To find excuse, much less a pardon for it.

Nob. Madam, I hope, it is not on my account
My friend is thus neglected by your Ladyship?

Lady. No such thing, Sir; if you are rich you are welcome:
( To Nob. But for that Gentleman, (your friend you call)
That knows himself to be wretchedly poor,
Beyond all hopes, and yet pretend to me,
Is such a thing as I must not forgive.

Sir Cog. It Is likely, Madam, that some Rival here
Is hapyer than I?

Lady. He is so, if more Rich:
That is the only thing, Sir, that sways me.

Sir Cog. Madam, in the opinion of the general,
There are other things to be considered
In the choice of a Husband.

Lady. The Vulgar, say you?
That commonly runs false; and I Will be singular,
Sir, thus in short: were you in full possession
Of as fair an Estate as is your Rival,
Your person, Sir, might pass muster with me;
I like that well enough.

Nob. Come, come away;
For shame, Sir, do not spend one single thought
Upon so interest a thing as this,
Who is a scandal to her gentler Sex.

Lady. Indeed! are you of that Religion too?
( To Nob. Here, Sir, read this, and then tell me your mind?

( To Sir Cog. Sir. Cog. reads. Madam,
I hope you will attribute these few lines of advice to my diligent care of
your Welfare, since they tend to no other end, than the giving you notice that
I am in mind to have Heirs of my own getting, and leave my Nephew to his
Ingenuity. I make no question but you know my meaning: So conclude,

Madam, yours, Amorous Frost


Nob. Your Uncle has been too quick for you here.

Sir Cog. Madam, since it is so, yet give me leave
To congratulate my Rival e're I go.

Lady. Sir, To speak the truth, I had intelligence
He would be here this day; but yet, not come.
In The evening, Sir, if you please to be here,
You Will witness our Contract.

Nob. And Marriage too?

Lady. If he has a mind to it.

Sir Cog. Madam, I Will come.

Lady. Your Friend too, Sir.

Nob. Your thrifty Servant, Madam.

Exeunt men. Lady. So much for that: now shall I think it long
Till my new Lover comes. I wonder what
His Compliment will be?

Prew. By relation, Madam,
He cannot say, as a body should say,
As one should say, boh! to a Goose.

Lady. Go to:
How goes the day?

Prew. Madam, on its decline.

Lady. And not come yet?

Enter Boy. Boy. A strange Gentleman, in as strange a dress,
Madam, demands access unto your Ladyship,
Both for himself, his mouth, his man, and dog.

Lady. What Is this thou say?
Admit him here.
Sure this is he, by the Message he sent.
I dread his coming in, who just before
Wished he were here: I must receive him now.
It is too late to think.

Enter Clay, Per. Clunch, Tray. Clay takes his Compliment from Per. pins it to
his Hat, comes up to the Lady, makes a Leg, then falls back again, hems, spits,
and Coughs; blows his Nose on the ground, then wipes it on his sleeve. Clay.
Come here, poor Rogue.

(To Tray. Per. Now mind your business, Sir.

Clay Reads. Clay. Madam, super Excellent, and the sole supreme Mistress of my
sober Passions, ( hem, pat the Dog) paron -- hum -- pardon, that my peregrine
self entreats the Mixifick effects of the sweet Influentials of your, of your,
-- your -- Loxogonos -- phe -- ri-cal Intuition. You sublime Lady alone, are
able to nurce up this -- ( hem again.) ( a pox of these hard words) ex -- exta
-- extatickal embryo of your more than thrice supedaneous Admirer. ( hem again.
Give me leave super Mundaine Lady, to supplicate at the (nownow again)
sub-t-e-r-ter-sel of your feet; and pardon him who subscribes himself your
slave, as far beneath your pity, as a Myrmidonial Insect to highest of Stairs;
no, Stars I mean.


(Vnpins the Paper, gives it to Per. Clay. So much for the Compliment Clunch,
want it well done? efecks, 't has made me sweat. This thing called wooing, is a
most pest'lant thing. Lady, if you would have more, I Have brought my mouth with me,
do you see, to speak for me.


(Per. bows. Lady. Sir, in few words, you are welcome to my house.

Clay. It is not quite so big as our new Barn:
(Walks whistling. What thinks thou, Clunch?

Clunch. Yea, thereabouts.

Lady. There Is nothing can be more ridiculous:
It Is the mere abstract of impertinencie;
Worse cannot be.

Per. I am glad to hear that.

(Aside. Lady. What have I done?

Clay. How do you like my Dog?
(Holds up his Dog to the Lady. Do you see, Madam, en't it a fine thing?

Lady. Oh! very fine indeed, and nothing finer.

Clay. Come hither, Tray? what do you think's his name?

Lady. Why Tray I think.

Clay. Efecks you are in the right;
Clay sets him down, sets Tray in another chair, leaves the Lady standing. That
you should guess, do you see, so well at first!
Did she not, Clunch?

Clunch. Yea, yea, what was it you said?

Clay. Effecks, I Am glad to see you well: sit down.
Ho! fetch a stool for my Lady to sit.
Clay plays with the Dog, whistles so loud, be drowns all that they say. Mouth,
do you talk to my Lady a little,
While I play with my Dog.

Per. I am commanded
Madam --

Lady. Heavens deliver me from this Impertinent!

Per. and the Lady as in discourse, while Clay is stalking up and down
whistling, etc. Clay. Oye, oye, let him alone for Compliments.
I stoo-her, mouth: he will give you your belly full
Of Compliments, and Courtship, and what not?
I Will play him against any in Town or Country
At either of those Weapons for a great.
Oye, stick closs to her man, oye, oye, look on.
(Lady looks on him. I know it is all for me he speaks to you:
For why? he is my mouth, are you not, mouth?
How do you like him, Lady?

(Rushes upon them. Lady. Very well.

Clay. It Is all the better for me still, I cry.
(Seats himself first. I pray sit down. This London, Lady mine,
Is a chargeable place. Nay, look on me;
Lady minds not Clay, looks on Per. He is only to speak, not to look on.
What do you think 't has cost me, do you see,
Since I Am in Town, on me, on Clunch, and Tray?

Lady. What is it you said?

Clay pulls her, to make her hear. Clay. Well, Lady, for this bout
I will not pose you in it; but in a lump
(She minds Per. 'T has cost me just seven Nobles, do you see.

Lady. What person, Sir, is this you have brought with you?

Clay. It is my Mouth; I told you so before,

Lady. A Gentleman?

Clay. Gentleman, do you see, that will speak you --

Lady. And are you sure he is a Gentleman?

Clay. Our Neighbor Airy told me so, I Am sure;
(Angrily. And this I know, she would not lie for th'matter.
I tell you once more, he is a Gentleman
Every inch on him: do but try him else;
He Will give you, do you see, your belly full.

Per. This works for me beyond imagination.

(Aside. Clay. Nay, but pray hear me out: I brought him here,
That in case you loved Compliments, do you see,
A should sit your turn, Lady, t'a Cow's thumb,
As one should say: for, for my part,
I naturally hate these Compliments.
Look on him, Lady, pray.

Lady. A good presence.

(Aside. Clay. Effecks I Am woundy dry: Clunch fetch two Pots
To make my Lady drink.

(Gives Clunch Money. Lady. Sir, use my Cellar:
It is the fittest place for such a beast.

(Aside. Clay. Efecks a match, a match; come hither Tray.
Nay, well all go: I Will lead in Tray, do you see?
And you, Clunch hand my Lady: As for Mouth,
He is only to talk.

Lady. Hands off.

Clunch offers to take the Lady by the hand, she flies off. Exeunt Clay and
Clunch. Clunch. Choose chub.

Lady. Now I begin t'abhor that foolishness
Which possessed me so late. I am justly punished
For my covetousness; plainly foresee
I shall become a laughing stock to all.

Per. Madam, if that --

Lady. Pray, Sir, answer me first:
Are you a Gentleman?

Per. I am so, Lady.
But Madam, give me leave to let you know
My miseries, the crossness of my Stars,
Those fatal Influences did preside
At th'hour of my Birth --

Lady. What, Sir, can make you
So unhappy a man, as you endeavor
To represent your self?

Per. Madam, it is this:
That being extracted of a Gentile stock
Honorably derived, have been imbued
With a proportioned breeding to my Birth,
I should want that great Idol of the world,
A futable Estate to all those things
I have but newly mentioned.

Lady. A comely man;
Me thinks I am concerned at his relation:
Pray, Sir, how long have you known Mr. Clay?

Per. Only since morning, Madam, have I seen
This man possessed with that great lump of treasure
Which renders him ridiculous to the world;
While the hundred part of that vast Estate
Might entitle some worthy gentleman
To your consideration.

Lady. Would I were certain
This person were of a Gentile extraction.
(Aside. When're I cast my Eye upon his preson,
Me thinks I do him wrong to question it.
I feel somewhat within me takes his part,
That will not let me rest, but whisperes still
Unto my heart, This man's to be preferred
With his bare virtue, before that other thing
With all its wealth. Come, Sir, we'll in an see
What is become of Mr. Timothy Clay
And his followers.

Per. Madam, I Will wait upon you.

(Per. takes the Lady by the hand, Exeunt.) SCENE IV. Covent Garden.

For my Amorous Theft: you must assist

Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I.
Young Airy solus, in Riding habit. DIck Airy, thou art in London once again;
And now, what is to be done? I know not faith:
I Will examine my Pockets, see what is left
Of Lands, Chattels, and Goods, Money and all;
All I have in the world is in this place.
Let Us see, what have we here? just seven Guinies;
I Will to the Ordinary, there I Will try
Whether these seven pieces I have left
Are good breeders or not; if not, why then
I shall but lose what would do me no good
To keep, except 'twere more: however, then
I shall be thoroughly cleared of that small stock
Which never did me good since the first hour
My Father left it me. How he came by it
I know not; let that pass: then will I try
What I can do of my own self to live:
What know I but Fortune would prove more kind
Were this gone also?
Unwilling peradventure I should owe
My happiness to any thing but she.
I Will try her once; Fortune, an't be thy will
To have me loose this Gold, yet help me then,
Merely out of stark kindeness and pure love.

Enter Lysse. Begar Mademoiselle you come de very goot tim.
Autrement me have kill de Rogue.

Champ. Par ma foy is just go.

Lysse. I am glad on it.

And kill de him for your service.

Lysse. I promise here, Champagne, to Marry you.

Champ. Aye! Monsieur Champagne?

Lysse. Monsieur Champagne, I mean.
At the same hour your Rogue-Master shall wed
That Mistress he is about.

Champ. Toshe de hand:
(Takes her aside, and whispers. Me tell de you in secret --

Table out. Enter Sir Cog. Phill. Nob. Dian. Siss. Phill. I suppose, Sir, that
you are now returned
From th'assignation?
What did the Lady say?

Sir Cog. Madam, I will inform you punctually
Of all that past between us. The Lady come
At the appointed place, caused the Chair
She was in to be stopped, and thus began.
There is a Lady not far from this place,
Of Beauty, Youth, Birth, and Estate to boot,
Not inferior to the rich Lady Lovewealth,
Has such Esteem, Affection, if not Passion,
Or rather Love for your personal worth,
As cannot be expressed in lesser terms
Than making you her Husband.
Sir, you must know,
This night she does intend in a disguise,
To Mascarade it at the Lady Lovewealth --
Where I Will be sure to accompany her.
Madam, here is all
That has past 'twixt the Lady and my self.

Exit Champ. To them Lysse. Phill. I find I am not in the least suspected.

(Aside. Sir Cog. Well Lysse, what news now?

Lysse. None, Sir, but good.
These were his words, as well as he could speak,
Or I them understand. Me Mastre's Mistress is a
Young Lady whose name is Mrs. Kitty Noble.

Nob. How, Kitty Noble, say thou?

Lysse. Just so, Sir.

This night, at three, my Master de Rogue and I steel her away, and cheat me
Master the fool of his fine Miss by a Ladder of Ropes, out of a window next to
the Garden-wall at the Boardingschool in our own street. He added, that this
Master was to be disquis'd like a Woman, and he he knew not yet. This did he
jabber in his Gibberish tone.


Nob. Come, come, fear nothing, Sir, all will do well;
This works as I could wish: your assignation
At the Lady Lovewealth once at an end,
If you do not succeed, we'll watch the old Knight,
And seize upon that most villainous Rogue
That sets him on merely for his own ends,
As we may clearly see beyond dispute
By Lysse's late intelligence: we know the hour --
And there is no fear but to compass our ends.

( To Nob. Sir Cog. Madam, if that --

( To Phill. Phill. Sir, I hope you will excuse
(She interrupts Sir Cog. My absence this night from the Lady Love wealths?

Sir Cog. And do you leave me, Madam?

Dian. She is not well.

Phill. I shall wish you good sport, and good success.

Sir Cog. Come Sister, you will along?

Phill. Yes, she shall go,
And Lysse too.

Nob. Come, come, let us loose no time.
Madam, your humble Servant.

( To Phill. Sir Cog. Servant, Lady.

Exeunt all but Phill. and Siss. Phill. Have thou got all things ready?

Siss. Madam, I have.

Phill. Cupid prosper and crown this last nights work!

Siss, watch their goings forth, and in what dress
Sir Coggin is accoutred; and when they are gone,
Advertise me, that we may after them
With diligence. Surely it is impossible
I should be known in a Torch-bearer's habit,
With such a Mask as will hide all my face?
Thou being the Lady too?

Siss. I must confess,
That this change put upon them, will help much
To your concealment.

Phill. It will: be gone; make haste.
Exit Siss.
Who Is this that knocks? I would not be seen now:
(A knocking. I Will hide the light, and then let them in.
(Puts the light out of doors. Who Is there?
Enter Brave. Brave. A Friend.

Phill. It Is more than I know yet.

Brave. I cannot help that. Sir Coggin? is it you?

Phill. The very same.

Brave. I Am glad I Have met you, Sir, though in the dark:
I have but some few words --

Phill. Your business, pray?

Brave. My business is but short: Mr. Crosby,
From whom I came, has desired me to say
You had not, Sir, that Title in Phill. Airy,
Or any of that worthy Ladies Virtues,
As he himself has, and does hold by right;
And on the same account, desires to see you
In the Piazza with your sword in hand,
At six this morning.

Phill. I Will wait upon him, Sir.

Brave. It will be requisite you take a friend;
Your Rival honors me.

Phill. That shall be done.

Brave. I am your Servant, Sir.

Phill. Sir, I am yours.

Exit Brave. Now am I challenged: O! here comes my Second.
Enter Siss. Siss. I come to tell you that the coast is clear.

Phill. Come, let us to the Coach, and as we go
I Will tell thee the best Jest that ever was.

Exeunt. SCENE III. Lovewealth's house.
Two Chairs out. Lady Lovewealth, Per. Clay, Clunch, Tray, Prew.
Clay. A Vadds, now, do you see, my head does ache
Like any wildfire? hark you, my Lady?
Now, do you keep of all these sorts of Liquors
In your own Cellar, all the year about?

Lady. Yes, yes, why not?

Clay. Why then you are woundy rich.
What Is your name, Prew?

Prew. My name is Prudence, Sir.

Clay. I prithy look my head.

Sets himself on a Chair, his legs over the Ladies lap, and his dog in his.
Lady rises in anger, discourses with Per. Lady. No flesh and blood
Can bear this insolence.

Clay. It Is very cold;
Fecks we will to Blind-man's-bluff: 'twill heat us all.
Clunch shall be hid.

Clunch. Not I; I know your tricks.

Clay. I am waggish sometime, Lady, do you see,
And he is wary of me: come, I Will hide.

Clunch. I Will blind you then.

Clay. No, my Lady shall do it.

Clunch. No, no, do you mark me, I Will have no such cheating.

Clay. So, o-brave Clunch, that calls my Lady cheat!
Thou Art so mistrustful -- come along simpleton:
Hold, hold, Clunch, not so hard.

(Clunch blinds him. Clunch. Is it well now?

Clay. Oye, oye, do you see, I Will have no goings out.

Clunch. No, no, come on.

They rush upon the Lady. Lady. Heavens! what will this be?

Per. A cure I hope to your brains and my fortune.

(Aside. Clay. Have at you Clunch; you do not clap your hands.
I warrant you this was Clunch. I taught him that.
I Will fit him for it.

Clunch lays himself down, Clay falls over him. Enter Maskers. Clunch. Ods
wowks, what have we here?

(Run's away. Clay. I Will tell you what, if I do catch you, Clunch.
Oh! have I caught you now, Clunch? Devil, Oh!

Catches the Wheel barrow, runs away crying. Per. What Is this insolency for?

Lady. But Mascarades.
How his anger ^^comes him? all he does
Has so much grace --

Clay. I would I were a whom.

Lady. I would to Heaven thou had never been here.

Clay. Had I know, Lady, that your house was haunted,
I Would never a come so far to marry you.
What do I know, do you see, but when we two
Were in one bed minding of somewhat else,
We should have these Hobgobblings come to us,
And so mar all our sport? Pray now how long
(To the Lady; she turns off. Has your house been haunted? what say you Mouth?
Will Not they hurt Tray? nor Clunch? nor you? nor me?

Per. Observe, they dance.

After the Dance exeunt all the Maskers, but the Wheel-bar. Clay. They Are merry
Devils fecks.

Dance here. Clunch. Hy-day; more Devils yet?

Enter Sir Amorous and Champagne in a Spanish Garb. Dance here. Champ. dances a
Saraband, or Antique. Clay. Whow! Hell's broke loose.

Siss. Sir, if you dare put confidence in me,
( To Sir Cog. Here I protest that in every respect
She is to Madam Phill. Airy equal,
If not to be preferred.

Sir Cog. Well, Madam, since
I must not hope to see the Lady's face
Before I Have given my hand, and must confess
You have been just in all you have hitherto
Declared to me; my life and fortunes both,
I put into your hands, to dispose of
As you shall best think fit.

Siss. Then give me leave
To speak you at this time a happy man:
Some minutes, Sir, will make you say the same.

Sir Cog. Madam, I am all faith.

Siss. Give me your hand,
To dispose with your heart, as I think fit.

She gives it to Phill. he starts at the habit. Sir Cog. What, wedded to a boy?
Madam, what is this?
( To Siss. Sure I am not so tame as you imagine,
To have this put upon me thus?

Siss. Now, Madam,
It is time to discover.

( To Phill. Sir Cog. How, Madam, say you?

Siss. But show your face, then you clear all suspicion
In this Gentleman.

Phill. Will this, Sir, serve the turn?.

(Discovers only to Sir Cog. Sir Cog. Heavens!
But once more let me gaze; my happiness
Is so wonderful great, I cannot believe it.

Phill. What think you now?

(Discovers again. Sir Cog. What think I Madam?
I cannot think, nor speak, nor see, nor hear.

Phill. Peace, not a word: hold up the humor still,
That we may not disturb my Brother in his Amor.
Your Sister and I, Sir, will borrow your Coach
While you two catch the Old Knight in's own trap:
Then we'll expect you home. Run in no danger.
Remember you are mine.

Sir Cog. Be pleased, Madam,
In The interim, to partake of our Banquet?

They open the Wheel-barrow, take out the Sugar-plums that lie at top, throw
them about, then present the sweetmeats to the Ladies. Dian. It Is likely, Sir,
you know not your own mind?

Nob. I Will give it you under what Oath you please.

Dian. That, Sir, perhaps is too serious a thing
For any thing you mean. And then, besides,
Do but consider our young acquaintance, Sir,
Which is not a month old.

Nob. An Age in Love!
Who with industrious wings should leave behind
The formal hours, nor is our meeting, Madam,
To be assigned to any portion of them,
Since it was meant as soon as we took breath;
And is but reconciled to accidents
That make it up.

Dian. A new Philosophy?
Well, Sir, go on.

Clay. A mumble, Clunch?
Hye Tray, there; mumble boys.

Nob. And should we add to it (I mean that time)
A cheap account of years, they cannot give
The more authority to my Vows, nor wrong
The honorable Favors you may shower
Upon your Servant. These things well considered,
You must conclude, Madam, it is with a form,
An idle custom, you would now comply
Against my happiness.

Dian. Well, Sir, in short,
Since by my Brother I Am informed you are
A person much deserving, and that besides
I Am wholly guided by him in this choice,
You promising so fair, henceforth you will have
More than a Mistress in title of me;
And for the future, it is like I'it command:
Think how you can obey.

Nob. Obsequiously;
Nothing within the circle of my power
To be exempted, Madam.

Dian. On these conditions,
I may be bold, Sir, to give you my hand.

Nob. And I to seal them, Madam,
On the white authors of my happiness.

(Kisses her hand. Sir Cog. presents the Heart to Phill. other parts to the
other Ladies. Phill. Sure, Sir, that is done already, is it not?
Or I have lost by the bargain.

Sir Cog. It Is so, Madam;
And this is merely Emblematical.

Dian. Now for some Hyppochras!

Nob. White or red, Madam?

Dian. Either, Sir, both.

Sir Cog. How do you like your Liquors?

Wrest an arm, draw Claret, draw white as from the Bladder. Phill. They are
good.
I Will try your skill once more; some Jelly now:
Open the head, take Jelly. What are his brains turned to that substance too?

Clay. They are the kindest Devils that e're I saw;
Are they not, Clunch?

Phill. my Brother plies it close;
I hope he will carry the Widow.

Lady. Whoever you are accept my hearty thanks
For your most pleasant and seasonable pastimes.
Exeunt Maskers. No longer between interest and love
Shall my heart wavering be, but choose
The latter for his god, and with disdain
Renouncing Pluto, Cupid's slave remain.

Gives her hand to Per. ACT V. SCENE I. Covent Garden.
Young Airy* solus in the dark. Y. Airy. WHy this is well: when things are at
the worst,
They commonly do mend; so may my fortune.
But first let me be sure there is none o'th'dregs
Of the late stock behind, lest that a little
Of the old leaven should ferment that Mass
Which is to come; send it after the rest
To the Devil headlong: what have I got here?
Enter Parson. Airy searches his Pockets, finds a Guiny, weighs it in's hand.
Another Devil in a golden dress?

Par. No, Sir, Heavens defend, I am the Parson
You have appointed to marry you this night.

Airy. What Is this you say?

(Airy startles. Par. That five hundred a year,
And a young handsome Wife in the bargain, Sir,
Should make you diligent, and loose no time.

Airy. Hold Fortune; not so fast, lest I should surfeit.
(Aside. How, fawning of a sudden? Here, take this.

(Gives the Parson the Guiny. Par. I thank you, Sir; there needs not so much
haste;
I could a stayed till the business were done.
Sir, I Will be gone, and wait at the Church Porch,
Where first you did appoint me for to be:
There I Will expect you both to tie the Knot.

(Runs out. Airy. Hist! hist! -- the Devil I gave him but now
Kitty lets fall the Lander of ropes on him, (...). Has carried him away, and
with him all
The budding hopes I had -- How now? what is this?
A Rope? it is so: ready fastened for use?
I thank thee Fortune however for this,
But beg your pardon if I slight your favor.
(Feels again. A Ladder of Ropes? there is something in the wind,
Some Lover's assignation, or some thieves;
It may be either. Should it be the last,
It were but charity to warn the house.
If It proves the first, as probably it may,
As far as I can guess, by the late discourse
I had with him my Devil took away;
Why may not I expect from a Ropes end,
What was denied me by all other means,
An end of all my miseries at once,
As many find? I Will up and try The Event,
Whatsoever it be.

Enter* Sir Am. Shift, Champ. Per. After, Enter Nob. Cog. and Slye. They grope
in the dark for the Ladder. Shift. We must grope for this Ladder in the dark.

These 3 lines are spoken while Airy gets up the Ladder. Sir Am. Go you one
way, and I Will another take.
And he that finds the Ladder first, gets up.

Gets up the Ladder into the window, feels out Kitty, takes her by the hand;
she seems surprised. Kitty. I Am glad you are come;
I thought you very long: is the Minister
At the Church Porch?

Airy, Peace, peace.

(Presses her hand with both his. Kitty. Come, let me lead,
I know the way of the house better than you.
Once more remember what a wise you get,
Young, Rich, and, though I say it, handsome to boot:
I hope, Sir, you will deserve this happiness,
He answers not, but Kisses her hand. By your tender love to me.

Leading her by the hand, by chance a glimpse
Of a neighboring light discovered her to me.

To that Gentleman; which he owned to be true.

Nob. She is undone for ever! quite undone!
Where is she now?

Where she said she would stay till you came to her.

Exit Crossed. This business managed well, Sir, may be worth
A thousand pounds a year.

While you will do well to go to the old man
And try what you can do, while he is yet
In's pannick fears.

Sir Cog. Be sure I Will do my best.

Nob. I Will take my Sister with me to your house.

Sir Cog. My house is yours, you know; Now must I go
To the old Knight with a most griveous story,
No less than Burglary and rape in the Gase,
And those with aggravations --

Enter Sir Am. Sir Am. Nephew, undone!
Undone for ever in my Reputation.

Sir Cog. I hope not so, dear Sir, though had enough.

Sir Am. What Is become of the rest? Oh! fatal hour!

Not far from hence.

Sir Am. Now Child, what is to be done?

Sir Cog. Sir, for the present I have stopped all proceedings,
Though 'twill break out again.

Sir Am. Too soon, I fear.
Well Nephew, though it is late, I see my fault,
And most deservedly am punished for it:
I put my self, and Reputation both,
Into your hands; preserve them both as yours.
I shall requite you, and in consideration
Of The wrong I would of late have done you, Nephew,
I will allow you, during my whole life,
A thousand pounds a year; and at my death,
The whole reversion of all my Estate.
Let Us in, and there I Will confirm the Deed to you
Before sufficient witnesses, till I can
Get the Writings drawn up.

Sir Cog. Honored Sir,
My life and honor shall for evermore
Stand between you and any sort of danger.
That no time may be lost, I Will instantly
To th'company, and take upon my self
The whole adventure. I hope I shall find friends
To get me off for some small sum of money.
It will be said of me, it was my youth.
Thus, Sir, your Reputation will be safe,
Your Person out of danger, and --

Sir Am. I instantly
Will send to have the Writings drawn up,
With all the haste that may be.

Sir Cog. Sir, good night.

Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. Sir Cog. house.
Phill. Phan. Siss. Phill. PRethy, dear heart, content thy self a while;
The appointed hour was between five and six,
And 't has but just struck five.

Phan. My dearest friend,
Pardon my Jealousies --

Phill. Be cheerful then;
I Will lay my life 'twill do.

Phan. Should your plot fail,
I were undone past all hopes of repair.
Is the Parson come yet?

Siss. Yes, long ago;
Waits in the Chamber next my Ladies closet,
Has but cold comfort on it.

Phill. He Is in the dark.

Siss. H'as neither fire, nor light,
And is locked up.

Phill. Come Siss, along with me to the Piazza.

Siss. Madam, I cannot fight.

Phill. No matter, Wench,
I Am stout enough for both.

Siss. Without a sword?

Phill. I Will leave you, Madam; you must have no light:
Let me alone to put the Change upon him.
Here comes some company, retire quick.

Enter Diana, Lysse. Dian. Well, Madam Sister, have you done your do?

Phill. Faith, dear Sister, not yet; but one plot more,
And then no more: Where Is your Brother, Madam,
And Mr. Noble?

Dian. Not yet returned, you see;
But sure they will not be long.

Phill. Well, I must go,
I shall not stay 'bove half an hour, at most.
I hope at my return to find all here.

Dian. Madam, how dare you venture all alone
At this unseasonable hour?

Phill. I fear no Colors!

Exit with Siss. Dian. This new Sister of mine is a mad thing.
What strange things she has acted here of late!
And still with good success.

Lysse. She has her ends.
Siss has told me, her Mrs. made no question
But that she would procure her self a Husband,
And her Brother a wife, in two days space;
And had her other Brother been in Town,
'Twould have gone hard but she would a fitted him
With a wife also.

Dian. She has done pretty well,
Having made sure for her self of my Brother,
Has put hers also in so fair a way
To th'Lady Lovewealth, it is ten to one
But he will carry her: but here he is,
Enter Per. and Lady Lovewealth. And by his cheerful looks I hope all is well.

Per. The night being far spent, and knowing, Madam,
There was such work in hand as would detain you
From your accustomed rest, we have made bold,
This fair Lady and I, to wait upon you.

Lady. Madam, I had no sooner given this Gentleman
A power over me, but he has made use of it
In commanding me hither.

Per. By your advice.

Dian. I am o'rejoy'd, Sir, to see your success,
And wish your Ladyship all happyness
In this your choice.

Lady. As I do you in yours.

Dian. I humbly thank your Ladyship, dear Madam.

Per. Nay, for my part, I Am fully persuaded
That all the Stars are in a close conjunction
This very night: but, Madam, where is the rest?
My Sister, Madam --

Dian. Gone about some new plot.

Per. Madam, here comes your Brother and his Mate.

Enter Sir Cog. Phill. Phill. Brother, speak, have thou sped?

Lady. I Will answer for him.
Madam, he may thank your politic head
For having me.

Per. And my well acting in it.

Phill. I hope by this I Have made an other match
Since I went hence.

Sir Cog. As how? pray let us hear.

Phill. Mr. Crosby being highly incensed
Against you, Sir, whom he knew was his Rival,
Was pleased this night to send a Challenge to you.
I in your absence, by the help of the dark,
Received that Message, which he thought he had given
To your own self. I was but just returned
From the Rendezvous, where finding the mistake
His Second had made, with some fair words,
And a promise of Marriage, I Have brought him home.

Sir Cog. How! a promise of Marriage, do you say?

Phill. Yes, yes, which by this time I have made good
I hope, and yet no prejudice to you,
(Sir Cog. startles. As you shall hear. The abused Lady Phanny
Through his wildness, as you know I had above,
And a Parson in readiness in the dark,
Under pretense of not being discovered,
He gave consent it should be without light:
There having brought Mr. Crosby, just now
l've slipped my hand from his, and in exchange
Have given him the Lady Phanny's hand:
I left them in this posture, the Minister
Doing his office readily without book.
So giving them the slip, I am come hither.
Enter Crosby, and Phanny. By this, I hope they are fast.

Sir Cog. I wish it so.

Per. Why here is plot enough to make a Play!

Phill. Oh! here they come, and by their countenance
I hope all is well.

Crosby. Where Is my Trappanner, ho!

Phill. I hope, Sir, you have pardoned my deceit.

Crosby. I thank your goodness for it, and do confess
You are that happy Star has guided me
To this shunned haven which will prove my Bliss,
Since I have paid that debt which through my Vows
I had contracted here. Your pardon, Sir,
( To Sir Cog. For those thoughts I once harbored against you
My Rival then, but now I hope my friend,
What say you, Sir?

Sir Cog. That here you may command
Your Lady too.

Enter Noble, Airy, Kitty. Phill. How now? who have we here?
My Brother sure, or I am in a dream?

Nob. Our Brother, Madam.

Pereg. It Is impossible, sure.

Y. Airy. Nay, it is even so: I am a married man,
And this my Lady, Brother.

Kitty. Thank your fortune!

Nob. Sister, and so may you, that he is yours.
For your sake, Sir, I Will forget her late folly,
( To Airy. And thank the Heavens for designing her yours
At the same time she sought her own destruction.

Y. Airy. You are all goodness, Sir, to pardon thus
My late presumption.

Nob. All shall be now forgot:
This is a night of Jubilee; from hence
We must banish all sorrow.

Phill. Pray let me come,
I Am Mrs. of the house, am I not, Sir?

( To Sir Cog. Sir Cog. And of me too.

Phill. I thought so much at least;
Therefore, dear Brother, I must bid you welcome,
And to your Lady.

Y. Airy. Dear Sister, humble thanks.

Kitty. Madam, for your sake, I Will praise him the more.

Enter Sir Am. Sir Am. My very good friends all, I am come here
To make my recantation, own my fault,
And willingly set a fine on my head
For my late folly: I therefore in presence
Of all are here, declare this Gentleman, my Nephew,
Sole Heir to my Estate, after my death:
During my life, allow him every year
One thousand pound. To this pray witness all,
Till I have made it good in lawful form
Under my Hand and Seal.

Sir Cog. and Phill. We thank you, Sir.

Nob. All these joynings of hands, and no dance to it?

Phill. Come, come, I Am for a dance, in which you will see,
Though distinct Couples, we can all agree.

The Dance. After which, Enter Slye haling of Champagne. Slye. O! have I caught

With me presently, or prepare to die.

Champ. Ha! ha! ha! Begar me tink de fellow is made;
Vat pox do you no see dat de la Commedy is finish? look de
Your part, you will find no sush ting: go, go, and let de me
