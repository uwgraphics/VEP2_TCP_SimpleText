happening upon Monday, being the sixtenth day of May, last past before the date

quenched, until it had quite burnt and consumed the said Brew House, together
with his ^welling house, Barn, Stables, and other outhouses, and goods and
Chattells therein, amounting to the value of a thousand pounds at the least, to
the utter undoing of him, his poor wife and chidren, who having heretofore
lived in wealth and plenty, are now like to perish for want of things
necessary, unless, the Charitable benevolence, of our loving and well disposed
subjects, be effectually extended toward them in this their great want and
misery.

Subject) of our especial grace and Princly compassion have given and granted,
and by these our Letters Pattents do give and grant unto our said poor
subject John Butler, and to his Deputy or Deputies, the Bearer or Bearers
