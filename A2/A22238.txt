JAMES By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens
and Headboroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties, as without, to whom these presents shall
come, greeting:
WHEREAS we are credibly given to understand, by a Certificate under the
hands of our right trusty and well-beloved Cosen William Earl of Sal^sbury,
Henry Lord Hunsdon, Sir John Butler, Sir Thomas Po(...) Blunt, and Sir Henry
Goodere Knights, Justices of the Peace within our County of Hartford, That our
poor distressed Subjects George Ballard, John Bridgman, and Alice Hughes,
Widow of Bishops Hatfield in our foresaid County, are now fallen into great
want and poverty by reason of a sudden and fearful Fire happening on the Tenth
day of October last past, which in short time between Eight and nine of the
clock in the night, consumed and burnt down eighteen bays of Housing, in
Barnes, Stables, and other houses, together with Four and twenty Loades of Hay
and also Wheat, Oats and Pease, with other goods and substance, and also sire
Poulters Horses with their furniture and some of their loading, Amounting in
the whole loss to the value of Two hundred and Fifty pounds or thereabouts,
to the utter undoing of our said poor Subjects, who before this untimely
accident lived well of themselves without any help from others, and gave
relief unto the poorer fort, but they are not now able to help themselves
having lost their only means and substance, which should support and sustain
both themselves Families, who through mere want of things necessary are
enforced to crave the Alms and charitable benevolence of our loving and
weldisposed people, not doubting but that all good Christians well weighing
with themselves the fickle estate of man through these inevitable accidents,
will be ready and willing as feeling members one of another miseries, to
extend their contributions toward the relief and comfort of our said poor
Subjects in this their great necessity, none knowing how soon nor whose chance
may next happen into the like Calamity.

KNOW ye therefore, That of Our especial Grace and Princely Compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents, do give and grant
unto our said poor Subjects George Ballard, John Bridgman, and Alice Hughes,
and to their Deputy and Deputies, the bearer or bearers hereof, full power,
license, and Authority to ask, gather, receive, and take the Alms and
charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects whatsoever, Inhabiting within
our Counties of Hertford, Bedford, Buckingham, Middlesex, Kent, Essex, and
Cambridge, with our City of Westminster and the Liberties thereof, and in our
Cities of Canterbury, Rochester, and the Cinque Ports, with our University of
Cambridge, and Isle of Ely, And in all other Cities, Towns Corporate,
Privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and in all other places whatsoever
within our said Counties and not else, for and toward the recovery of their
said losses and the relief and maintenance of themselves and their Families.

WHEREFORE we will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times, as the said George Ballard, John Bridgman, and Alice Hughes, or their
Deputy or their Deputies, the bearer or bearers hereof, shall come and repair
to any your Churches, Chapels, or other places, to ask and receive the
gratuities and charitable benevolence of our said Subjects, quietly to permit
and suffer them so to do, without any manner your lets or contradictions, And
you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curates, for the better stirring by of a
charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and declare the Tenor of these our
Letters Patents, unto our said Subjects upon some Saboth day, when as the same
shall tendered unto you. Exhorting and persuading them to extend their liberal
contributions in so good and charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of
every Parish, where such Collection is to be made (as aforesaid) to collect and
gather the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects, as well
Strangers as others, and what shall be by you so gathered ^o deliver it to the
bearer or bearers of these our Letters Patents and to no other person, when as
thereunto you shall be required. And last^y whereas we are informed of the great
abuse which is now crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Lycences
unto some other ^erson, whereby men's charity goes not the right way, but unto
such as deserve it least: That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that
if it may appear unto you or any of you, that the said George Ballard, John
Bridgman, and Alias Hughes, have contracted any bar^ains, or made or shall make
sale of these our Letters Patents, whereby the benefit should pass from them
to any other person, That thereupon these our Letters Patents shall be void
and of none effect. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance, or Provision, heretofore made
to the contrary in any wise not withstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused those our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next after the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster, the Fourth ^^y of December, in the Eighteenth
year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of ^cotland the Four
and Fiftieth. 1620. Steward.
