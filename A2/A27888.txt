To the KING.
OUr graver Muse from her long Dream awakes,
Peneian Groves, and Cirrha's Caves forsakes:
Inspired with Zeal, she climbs the Ethereal hills
Of Solyma, where bleeding Balm distills;
Where Trees of Life unfading Youth assure,
And Living Waters all Diseases cure:
Where the Sweet Singer, in celestial Lays,
Sung to his solemn Harp Iehovah's Praise.
From that fallen Temple, on her Wings she bears
Those Heavenly Raptures to your sacred Ears:
Not that her bare and humble Feet aspire
To mount the Threshold of th'harmonious Quire;
But that at once she might Oblations bring
To God; and Tribute to a god-like King.
And since no narrow Verse such Mysteries,
Deep Sense, and high expressions could comprise;
Her laboring Wings a larger compass fly,
And Poesy resolves with Poesy:
Lest she, who in the Orient clearly rose,
Should in your Western World obscurely close.
To the QVEEN.
O You, Who like a fruitful Vine,
To this our Royal Cedar join:
Since it were impious to divide,
In such a Present, Hearts so tied;
Urania your chaste Ears invites
To these her more sublime Delights.
Then, with your zealous Lover, daign
To enter David's numerous Fane.
Pure thoughts his Sacrifices are;
Sabaean Incense, fervent Prayer;
This holy Fire fell from the Skies;
The holy Water from his eyes.
O should You with your Voice infuse
Perfection, and create a Muse!
Though mean our Verse, such Excellence
At once would ravish Soul and Sense:
Delight in Heavenly Dwellers move;
And, since they cannot envy, Love:
When they from this our Earthly Sphere
Their own Celestial Music hear.
To my Noble Friend, Mr. GEORGE SANDYS, Upon his Excellent Paraphrase on the
PSALMS.
HAd I no Blushes left, but were of Those,
Who Praise in Verse, what they Despise in Prose:
Had I this Vice from Vanity or Youth;
Yet such a Subject would have taught me Truth:
Hence it were Banished, where of Flattery
There is nor Use, nor Possibility.
Else thou had cause to fear, lest some might Raise
An Argument against thee from my Praise.
I therefore know, Thou can expect from me
But what I give, Historick Poetry.
Friendship for more could not a Pardon win;
Nor think I Numbers make a Lie no Sin.
And need I say more than my Thoughts indite,
Nothing were easier, than not to write.
Which now were hard; for wheresoever I Raise
My thoughts, thy several Pains extort my Praise.
First, His Travels, wherein he relates the History of the Pyramids.
that which does the Pyramids display:
And in a work much lastinger than they,
And more a wonder, scorns at large to show,
What were Indifferent if True or No:
Or from its lofty Flight, stoop to declare
What All men might have known, had all been There.
But by thy learned Industry and Art,
To Those, who never from their Studies part,
Does each Lands, Laws, Belief, Beginning show;
Which of the Natives but the Curious know:
Teaching the frailty of all Humane things;
How soon great Kingdoms fall, much sooner Kings*
Prepares our Souls, that Chance cannot direct
A Machin at us, more than we expect.
Athens.
We know, That Town is but with Fishers Fraught,
Where Theseus Governed, and where Plato Taught*
Greece.
That Spring of Knowledge, to which Italy
Ows all her Arts, and her Civility,
In Vice and Barbarism supinely rowls;
Their Fortunes not more slavish than their Souls.
Eastern Churches.
Those Churches, which from the first Heretics wan
All the first Fields, or led (at least) the Van;
In whom those Notes, so much required, be;
Of Doctrine.
Agreement, Miracles, Antiquity:
Which can a Never-broke Succession show
Of Persons.
From the Apostles down; (Here bragged of so:)
So best conf^^e Her most Immodest claim,
As Antiock.
Who scarce a Part, yet to be All does aim;
Lie now distressed, between two Enemy-Powers,
Whom the West damns, and whom the East devours.
What State than Theirs can more Unhappy be,
Threatened with Hell, and sure of Poverty.
The small Beginning of the Turkish Kings,
And their large Growth, show us that different Things
May meet in One Third; what most Disagree,
May have some Likeness: For in this we see,
A Mustard Seed may be resembled well
To the Two Kingdoms, both of Heaven and Hell.
Their Strength, and wants this work has both unwound;
Turks.
To teach how these d' increase, and that confound:
Relates their Tenets; scorning to dispute
With Errors, which to tell, is to confute:
Shows how even there, where Christ vouchsafed to Teach,
Their Dervices dare an Impostor Preach. Priests.

For whilst with private Quarrels we Decaid,
We way for them, and Their Religion made:
And can but Wishes now to Heaven prefer,
May they gain Christ, or We his Sepulcher.
Next Ovid calls me; Ovids Metamorphosis.
which though I admire,
For Equalling the Authors quickening Fire,
And his pure Phrase: yet More; remembering It
Was by a Mind so much distracted Writ:
Business and War, Ill Midwives to produce
The Happy Offspring of so sweet a Muse:
Whilst every unknown Face did Danger Threat;
For every Native there was twice a Get.
More; when (returned) thy Work reviewed, Commentar.
exposed
What Pith before the hiding Bark enclosed:
And with it that Essay, Virg. A^^. lib. 1.
which lets us see
What by the Foot, what Hercules would be.
All fitly offered to his Princely Hands;
By whose Protection Learning chiefly stands:
Whose Virtue move more Pens, than his Power Swords;
And Theme to those, and Edge to these affords.
Who could not be displeased that his great Fame, Panegyric.

So pure a Muse, so loudly should proclaim:
With his Queens praise in the same Model cast;
Which shall not less, than all their Annals, last.
Yet, though we wonder at thy Charming Voice;
Perfection still was wanting in thy Choice:
And of a Soul, which so much Power possessed,
That Choice is hardly Good, which is not Best.
But though thy Muse were Ethnically Chaste,
When most Fault could be found; yet now Thou have
Diverted to a Purer Path thy Quill;
And changed Parnassus Mount to Sions-Hill:
So that blessed David might almost Desire
To hear his Harp thus Echoed by thy Lyre.
Such Eloquence, that though it were abused,
Could not but be (though not Allowed) excused.
Joined to a Work so choice, that though Ill-done,
So Pious an Attempt Praise could not shun.
How strangely does it darkest Texts disclose,
In Verses of such sweetness; that even Those,
From whom the unknown Tongue conceals the Sense,
Even in the Sound, must find an Eloquence.
For though the most bewitching Music could
Move Men, no more than Rocks; thy Language would*
Those who make with their Curse, who spend their Brain,
Their Time, and Art, in looser Verse, to gain
Damnation, and a Mistress; till they see
How Constant that is, how Inconstant she;
May from this great Example learn, to sway
The Parts they are Blest-with, some more Blessed way.
Fate can against Thee but two Foes advance;
Sharp-sighted Envy, and Blind Ignorance:
The first (by Nature like a shadow, near
To all great Acts) I rather Hate than Fear:
For them, (since whatsoever most they Raise
In Private, That they most in Throngs Dispraise;
(...).
And know the Ill they Act Condemned within)
Who envies Thee, may no man envy Him.
The last I Fear not much, but Pity more:
For though they cannot the least Fault explore;
Yet, if they might the high Tribunal Clime,
To Them thy Excellence would be thy Crime:
For Eloquence with things Profane they join;
Nor count it fit to Mix with what is Divine;
Like Art and Paintings laid upon a Face,
Of it self sweet; which more Deform than Grace,
Yet, as the Church with Ornaments is Fraught,
Why may not That be too, which There is Taught?
And sure that Vessel of Election, Paul,
Who Judais'd with Jews, who All to All:
So, to Gain some, would be (at least) Content,
Some for the Curious should be Eloquent:
For since the Way to Heaven is Rugged, who
Would have the Way to that Way be so too?
Or thinks it fit, we should not Leave obtain,
To learn with Pleasure, what we Act with Pain?
Since then Some stop, unless their Path be Even,
Nor will be led by Soloecismes to Heaven;
And (through a Habit scarce to be controlled)
Refuse a Cordial, when not brought in Gold;
Much like to them to that Disease Inured, Tarantula

Which can be no way, but by Music cured;
I Joy in Hope, that no small Piety
Will in their Colder Hearts be Warmed by Thee.
For as none could more Harmony dispense;
So neither could thy flowing Eloquence
So well in any Task be used, as this:
To Sound His Praises forth, whose Gift it is.
-- Cui non certaverit ulla
Aut tantum fluere, aut totidem durare per annos.
Virg. Georg. 2. FALKLAND.
An ODE to my worthy Kinsman, Mr. GEORGE SANDYS, Upon his excellent Paraphrase
on the PSALMS.
O Breath again! that holy Lay
Did convay,
Unto my soul so sweet a Fire,
I desire,
That all my Senses charmed to Ear,
Should fix there.
O might this sacred Anthem last,
'Till Time's past:
Until we warble forth a higher,
In the Quire
Of Angels, till the Spears keep time,
To your Rhyme.
Amphion did a City raise,
By his Lays:
The Stones did dance into a Wall,
At his call.
But your divinely-tuned Air
Does repair
Even Man himself, whose stony Heart,
By this Art,
Rebuildeth of its own accord,
To the Lord,
A Temple breathing holy Songs,
In strange Tongues.
You fit both David's Lyre, and Notes,
To our Throats.
See, the green Willow now not wears,
Of their Tears.
The sadly silent Trophyes, we
From the Tree,
Take down the Hebrew Harps, and reach,
In our speech,
What ever we do hate, what fear,
What love dear.
Now in faint Accents praising God,
For his Rod:
Since that his punishing a Child,
Must be styled
A Blessing. But our thankful Lays
Do his Praise
Sound in the loudest Key, when e're
He draws near
In Mercy, not affrighting Power;
In that Hour,
New Life approaches: Then our Joy
Does employ
Each Faculty, and Tune each Air
To a Prayer.
But by and by our Sins do cause
A sad Pause.
Our Hands lift-up, and cast-down Eyes,
Our faint Cries,
Do in their sadly-pleasing Tones
Speak our Mones.
In stead of Harps we strike our Breasts:
All the Rests
Attend his Music, are a Tear,
Which Sighs bear,
In their soft Language, up on high,
To the Sky;
Whence God, delighted with our Grief,
Sends Relief.
Thus unto You we owe the Joys,
The Sweet Noise
Of our ravished Souls; we borrow
Hence our Sorrow;
Repentant Sorrow, which does glad,
Not make sad.
We weep in your Lines, we rejoice
In your Voice:
Whose pleasing Language fans the Fire
Of Desire,
Which flames in Zeal, and calmly fashions
All our Passions.
Which you so sweetly have expressed,
Some have guest,
We Hallelu-jahs shall rehearse,
In your Verse.
Then be secure, your well-tuned Breath
Shall now outlive the Date of Death;
And when Fate pleases, you shall have
Still-Musick in the silent Grave:
You from Above shall hear each day
One Dirge dispatched unto your Clay,
These your own Anthems shall become
Your lasting Epicedium.
Dudly Digges.

A PARAPHRASE Upon the FIRST BOOK OF THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM I.
^ Cantus.

THat Man is truly blessed, who never strays
^ Bassus.

^
By false advice, nor walks in Sinners ways;
^
^
Nor sits infected with their scornful pride,
^
^
Who God contemn, and Pi-e-ty deride.
^
But wholly fixes his sincere delight
On heavenly Laws; those studies day and night.
He shall be like a Tree that spreads his Root
By living Streams, producing timely Fruit:
His Leaf shall never fall: the Lord shall bless
All his endeavors with desired success.
Men lost in Sin, unlike rewards shall find,
Dispersed like Chaff, before the furious Wind:
Their guilt shall not that horrid day endure,
Nor they approach the Assemblies of the Pure:
For God approves those ways the Righteous tread
But Sinful Paths to ^ure Destruction lead.
PSALM II.
Cantus.
^
HOw are the Gentiles all on fire! Wh^^
Bassus.
^
^
rage they with vain menacings; Earths haughty
^
^
Potentates and Kings, Against God against his
^
^
Christ conspire: Break we, say they, their fervile
^
^
bands, And cast their cords from our free hands.
^
But God from his Celestial Throne
Shall laugh, and their attempts deride;
Then high incenst, thus check their pride;
^His Wrath in their confusion shown)
Lo, I my King have Crowned, and will
Inthrone on Sions sacred Hill.
That great Decree I shall declare:
For thus I heard Jehovah say;
Thou art my Son begot this day:
Request, and I will grant thy Prayer;
Subject all Nations to thy Throne;
And make the Sea-bound Earth thine own.
Thou shall an Iron Scepter sway,
Like earthen Vessels, break their Bones.
Be wise, O you who sit on Thrones;
And Judges grave advice obey:
With joyful Fear, O serve the Lord;
With trembling Joy embrace his Word.
In due of Homage kiss the Son,
Lest He his wrathful looks display;
And so you perish in the way,
His anger newly but begun:
Then blessed only are the Just,
Who on the Anointed fix their trust.
PSALM III.
Cantus.
^
MY God, how are my foes increast!
Bassus.
^
^
What multitudes against me rise! Who say, gi^^
^
^
we his Soul no rest; Whom God forsakes,
^
^
and Men despise.
^
But thou art my Support, my Tower,
My Safety, my choice Ornament.
Before thy Throne my Prayers I power,
Heard from thy Sions high ascent.
No fears affright my soft repose;
Thou my Night-watch, my Guard by Day:
Not Miriads of Armed Foes,
Nor Treasons secret hands dismay.
Arise, O vindicate my Cause!
My Foes, whom wicked Hate provoke,
Thou, Lord, have smit their cankred Jaws,
And all their Teeth asunder broke.
Thou, Lord, the only Hope of those,
Who thee with Holy Zeal adore;
Whose all-protecting Arms enclose
Their Safety, who thy Aid implore.
PSALM IV.
^ Cantus.

THou Guardian of my Truth and me,
^ Bassus.

^
That from these straits have set me free,
^
^
O hear my Prayer! Be I Thy Care;
^
^
For Mercy lives in Thee.
^
You Sons of Men, how long will you
Eclipse my Glory, and pursue
Loved Vanities;
Delight in Lies,
To Man, to God untrue?
Know, God my innocence has blessed,
And will with sovereignty invest:
His gentle Ear
Prepared to hear
My never vain request.
Sin not, but fear; surcease, and try
Your Hearts, as on your Beds you lie:
Pure gifts present
With pure intent,
And place your hopes on high.
But Earthly Minds false Wealth admire,
And toil with uncontrol'd desire.
With clear aspect
Thy Beams reflect,
And Heavenly Thoughts inspire.
O let my Joy, exempt from Fears,
Their Joys transcend, when Autumn bears
His pleasant Wines
On clustred Vines,
And Grain-replenish'd Ears.
Now shall the peaceful hand of Sleep
In heavenly Dew my senses steep;
Whom thy large wings,
O King of Kings,
In shades of Safety keep.
PSALM V.
^ Cantus.

TO hear me, Lord, be thou inclined;
^ Bassus.

^
My thoughts O ponder in thy mind: And
^
^
let my cries acceptance find. Thou hear'st my
^
^
Morning Sacrifice: To thee, before the
^
^
Day Star Rise, My Prayers ascend, with
^
^
steadfast eyes.
^
Thou love no vice; none dwells with thee;
Nor glorious Fools thy Beauty see;
All Sin-defil'd detested be
^^ars shall sink beneath thy hate;
^ho thirst for Blood, and weave deceit,
^hy Rage shall swiftly ruinate.
I to thy Temple will repair,
Since Infinite thy Mercies are;
And thee adore with Fear and Prayer.
My God, conduct me by thy Grace;
For many have my Soul in chase.
Set thy strait Paths before my Face.
False are their Tongues, their Hearts are hollow,
Like gaping sepulchers they swallow;
^^wn, and betray even those they follow.
With Vengeance girt these Rebels round;
In their own counsels them confound;
Since their Transgressions thus abound.
Joy they with an exalted Voice,
That trust in thee, who guard'st thy Choice:
Let those who love thy Name rejoice.
Thy Blessings shall in showers descend;
Thy favor as a shield defend
All those, who righteousness intend.
PSALM VI.
LOrd, As the 3 d.
thy deserved Wrath assuage;
Nor punish in thy burning Ire;
Let Mercy mitigate thy Rage*
Before my fainting Life expire.
O heal! my Bones with anguish ache;
My pensive Heart with sorrow worn.
How long will thou my soul forsake!
O pity, and at length return!
O let thy Mercies comfort me,
And thy afflicted Servant save!
Who will in death remember thee?
Or praise thee in the silent Grave?
Vexed by insulting enemies,
My Groans disturb the peaceful Night;
My Bed washed with my streaming Eyes:
Through Grief grown old, and dim of sight.
All you of wicked life depart;
The Lord my God has heard my cry:
He will recure my wounded Heart,
And turn my Tears to tides of Joy.
Who hate me, let dishonor wound,
Let fear their guilty souls affright;
With shame their haughty looks confound,
And let them vanish from my sight.
PSALM VII.
Cantus.
^
O Thou that art my Confidence,
Bassus.
^
^
And strong Defense; From those who my sad
^
^
fall intend, Great God, defend: Lest Lion-
^
^
like, if none control, They tear my perse-
^
^
cuted Soul.
^
If I am guilty; if there be
Deceit in me;
If Ill I ever to my Friend
Did but intend;
Or rather have not succored those
Who were my undeserved foes:
Let them my stained Soul pursue,
With hate subdue;
Let their proud feet in Triumph tread
Upon my head:
My life out of her mansion thrust,
And lay my Honor in the dust.
Against my dreadful Enemies,
Great God, arise.
Just Judge, thy sleeping Wrath awake,
And Vengeance take:
Then all shall Thee adore alone.
O King of Kings, ascend thy Throne!
Part 2.
Judge thou my Foes; as I am free,
So judge thou me:
Declare thou my integrity;
For thou do try
The Heart and Reins; The Just defend;
The Malice of the Wicked end.
God is my Shield; he help imparts
To sincere hearts;
The Good Protects, but menaceth
The Bad with Death;
Nor will, unless they change, relent:
He whets his Sword, his Bow is bent.
Dire Instruments prepared has
Of deadly Wrath:
And will at those, who persecute,
swift Arrows shoot:
Who wicked thoughts conceived; now great
With Mischief, travel; hatch Deceit.
Who dug a pit, first fell therein,
Caught by his Sin;
On his own head his outrage shall
Like ruins fall.
But I, O thou eternal King,
Will of thy Truth and Justice sing.
PSALM VIII.
^ Cantus.

LOrd, how Illustrious is thy Name!
^ Bassus.

^
Whose Power both Heaven and Earth proclaim!
^
^
Thy Glory thou have set on high, Above the
^
^
Marble-arched Sky.
^
The wonders of thy Power thou have
In Mouths of Babes and Sucklings placed:
That so thou might thy Foes confound,
And who in malice most abound.
When I pure Heaven, thy Fabric, see,
The Moon and Stars disposed by thee;
O what is Man, or his frail Race,
That thou should such a Shadow grace!
Next to thy Angels most renowned;
With Majesty and Glory crowned:
The King of all thy Creatures made;
That all beneath his feet has laid:
All that on Dales or Mountains feed,
That shady Woods or Deserts breed;
What in the Airy Region glide,
Or through the rolling Ocean slide.
Lord, how illustrious is thy Name!
Whose Power both Heaven and Earth proclaim.
PSALM IX.
Cantus.
^
THee will I praise with Heart and Voice
Bassus.
^
^
Thy wondrous Works aloud resound: In
^
^
thee, O Lord, will I rejoice; Thy Name with
^
^
Zealous Praises Crowned.
^
My Foes fell by inglorious flight,
Before thy terrible Aspect:
Thy powerful Hands support my Right;
Thou Judgment justly do direct.
The Proud are fallen, the Heathen fly;
Oblivion shall their names Intomb:
Destruction, O thou Enemy,
Has now reciev'd a final Doom.
Thou Towns and Cities have destroyed;
Their memory with them decays:
But God for ever shall abide,
And high his Throne of Justice raise.
A righteous Scepter shall extend;
And Judgment distribute to all:
He will oppressed Souls defend,
That in the time of Trouble call.
Who know thy Name in thee will trust;
Thou never wilt forsake thine Own.
Praise Sions King, O praise the Just,
And make his noble Actions known.
Blood s^apes not his revenging Hand;
He vindicates the Poor man's Cause.
Lord, my insulting Foes withstand,
And draw me from Deaths greedy Jaws;
That I may in the Royal Gate
Of Sions Daughter, raise my Voice;
Thy ample Praises celebrate,
And in thy saving health rejoice.
They (fallen into the Pit they made)
Are caught in Nets themselves prepared.
The Lord his Judgments has displayed:
The Wicked in their works ensnared:
The Wicked down to Hell shall sink,
And all that do the Lord disdain.
But God will on the Needy think;
Nor shall the Poor expect in vain.
Lord, let nor Man prevail; arise;
The Insulting Heathen judge: O then
Let trembling Fear their heart surprise;
That they may know they are but Men.
PSALM X.
^ Cantus.

WIthdraw not, O my God, my guide:
^ Bassus.

^
In time of Trouble do thou hide thy cheerful
^
^
face? Who want thy Grace, The poor pur-
^
^
sue with cruel pride: O be they by their
^
^
own In-ven-tions o-ver-thrown.
^
The wicked boast of their success;
The covetous profanely bless,
By Thee, O Lord,
So much abhorred.
Their pride will not thy power confess;
Nor have thy favor sought,
Or had of thee a thought.
They in oppression take delight;
Thy Judgments far above their sight:
Their enemies
Scoff and despise:
Who say in heart, No opposite
Can us remove, nor shall
Our greatness ever fall.
Their mouths detested curses fill
Fraud, mischief; ever prone to ill:
In secret they
Lurk to betray;
The Innocent in corners kill:
His eyes with fierce intent
Upon the poor are bent.
Part 2.
He like a Lion in his den,
Awaits to catch oppressed men,
Who unaware
Light in his snare.
His couched limbs contracts, that then
With all his strength he may
Rush on his wretched prey.
His heart has said, God has forgot;
He hides his face; he minds it not.
Arise, O Lord,
Draw thy just sword,
Nor out of thy remembrance blot
The poor and desolate:
O shield them from his hate!
Why should the wicked God despise,
And say he looks with careless eyes?
Their well seen spite
Thou shall requite.
The poor, O Lord, on Thee relies;
Thou help'st the Fatherless,
Whom cruel men oppress.
A sunder break the arms of those,
Who ill affect, and good oppose:
Their crimes explore,
Until no more
Lurk in their bosoms to disclose.
Eternal King, thy Hand
Has chased them from thy Land.
Lord, thou have heard thy Servants prayer;
Thou will their humble hearts prepare:
Thy gracious Ear
Inclined to hear.
The Fatherless, and worn with care
Judge thou; that Mortals may
No more with outrage sway.
PSALM XI.
As the 9th.
MY God, on Thee my hopes rely:
Why say they to my troubled Soul,
Arise, up to your Mountain fly;
Fly, quickly, like a chaced Fowl?
For lo, the Wicked bend their bows,
Their arrows fit with secret Art;
That closely they may shoot at those,
Who are upright and pure in heart.
If their foundation be destroyed,
What can the Righteous build upon?
God in his Temple does abide;
Heaven is the Great Jehovah's Throne.
His Eyes behold, his Eyelids try
The Sons of Men; allows the best:
But such as joy in cruelty
The Lord does from his Soul detest.
Snares, horrid Tempest, Brimstone, Fire,
(Their portion) on their heads shall light:
The entirely Just affects the Entire;
For ever precious in his sight.
PSALM XII.
Cantus.
^
HElp Lord, for Godly men decay;
Bassus.
^
^
From Mortals Faith, enforced, flies: And
^
^
with their sins Companions, they, Talk of af-
^
^
fected Vanities: Their flattering Tongues a-
^
^
bound with Lies; Their double Hearts bent
^
^
to betray.
^
God shall those flattering Lips confound,
And Tongues which swell with proud Disdain:
Whose boastings arrogantly sound;
Our Tongues the conquest shall obtain;
They are our own, who shall restrain?
Or to our Wills prescribe a bound?
But for the Oppression of the Poor,
And Wretches sighs which pierce the Skies,
Who pity at his Throne implore,
The Lord has said, I will arise,
And from their Foes, who them despise,
Deliver all that me adore.
Gods Word is pure; as pure as Gold
In melting Furnace seven times tried:
His Arms for ever shall infold
All those, who in his truth abide.
The wicked range on every side,
When vicious men the Scepter hold.
PSALM XIII.
Cantus.
^
HOw long! Lord, let me not for e-ver
Bassus.
^
^
be forgot! How long, my God, will thou
^
^
Contract thy clouded brow! How long in
^
^
mind perplexed Shall I be daily vexed.
^
How long shall he control,
Who persecutes my soul!
Consider, hear my cries;
Illuminate mine eyes;
Lest with exhausted breath
I ever sleep in Death;
Lest my insulting Foe
Boast in my overthrow;
And those who would destroy,
In my subversion joy.
But I, Thou ever Just,
Will in thy Mercy trust;
And in thy saving Grace
My constant Comfort place:
My Songs shall sing thy Praise,
That have prolonged my Days.
PSALM XIV.
Cantus.
^
THe fool has said in his false heart;
Bassus.
^
^
God cares not what to Man succeeds. Abomi-
^
^
nable are their deeds; All Ill affects from
^
^
Good depart.
^
Jehovah Man's rebellious Race
Beheld from his celestial Throne;
To see if there were any one
That understood, or sought his Face.
All from forsaken Truth are flown;
Corrupt in Body, such in Soul,
Defiled within, without as foul;
None Good endeavors, no, not One.
Are all, that work Iniquity,
By Ignorance so blindly led?
My People they devour like Bread;
Nor call on him who sits on high.
Their Consciences with terror quake;
Since God does with the Just abide:
For Poor men's Counsels they deride,
Who him for their Protection take.
O that unto thy Israel
Salvation might from Sion Spring!
When God shall us from Bondage bring,
No joy shall Jacob's joy excel.
PSALM XV.
^ Cantus.

WHo shall in thy Tent a -- bide?
^ Bassus.

^
On thy Holy Hill reside? He that is Just and
^
^
Innocent; Tells the truth of his intent;
^
Slanders none with venomb'd Tongue;
Fears to do his Neighbor wrong;
Fosters not base Infamies;
Vice beholds with scornful Eyes;
Honors those who fear the Lord;
Keeps, though to his loss, his Word;
Takes no Bribes for wicked ends,
Nor to Use his Money lends:
Who by these directions guide
Their pure steps, shall never slide.
PSALM XVI.
As the 8.
PReserve me, my undoubted Aid:
To whom, thou, O my Soul, have said,
Thou art my God; no good in me,
Nor Merit can extend to Thee;
But to thy blessed Saints that dwell
On Earth, whose Graces most excel:
Those Ravish me with pure Delight.
Their sorrows shall be infinite,
Who other Gods with Gifts adore:
Their bloody Offerings I abhor;
Nor shall their Names my Lips profane.
But God my Lot will still maintain:
He is my Portion, he bestows
The Cup that with his Bounty flows.
I have a pleasant Seat obtained,
A fair and large Possession gained.
The Lord will I for ever praise,
Whose Counsels have informed my Ways:
And my inflamed Zeal excite
To serve him in the silent Night.
He is my Object; by his Hand
Confirmed, immovable I stand.
Joy has my Heart and Tongue possessed:
My Flesh in constant Hope shall rest.
Thou will not leave my Soul alone
In Hell; nor let thy Holy One
Corruption see: But that Highway
To Everlasting Life display.
Thy Presence yields entire delight:
At thy Right hand Joys infinite.
PSALM XVII.
LOrd, As the 31.
grant my just Request; O hear my cry,
And Prayers that lips, untoucht with guile unfold!
My Cause before thy High Tribunal try,
And let thine Eyes my Righteousness behold.
Thou prov'st my Heart even in the Nights recess,
Like Metal try'st me, yet no Dross have found:
^ am resolved, my Tongue shall not transgress;
But on thy Word will all my Actions ground.
So shall I from the Paths of Tyrants fly:
O, lest I slip, direct my Steps by Thine!
Thee invoke; for Thou will hear my Cry:
Thine Ear to my afflicted Voice incline.
O show thy wondrous Love! Thou from their For
Preservest all that on thy Aid depend.
Lord, as the Apple of the Eye enclose,
And over me thy shady Wings extend.
Part 2.
For Impious Men, and such as deadly hate
My guiltless Soul, have compast me about;
Who swell with Pride, enclosed with their own fa^^
And words of contumely thunder out.
Our traced steps entrap as in a Toil;
Low-couched on the Earth with flaming Eyes;
Like famished Lions eager of their Spoil,
Or Lions Whelps; close lurking to surprise.
Arise! prevent him, from his Glory hurled;
My pensive Soul, from the Devourer save:
From men which are thy scourge, men of the wor^^
Who in this Life alone their Portion have.
Filled with thy secret Treasure, to their Race
They their accumulated Riches leave:
But I with Righteousness shall see thy Face;
And rising, in thy Image, joy receive.
PSALM XVIII.
As the 72.
MY Heart on Thee is fixed, my Strength my Power,
My steadfast Rock, my Fortress, my high Tower,
My God, my Safety, and my Confidence,
The Horn of my Salvation, my Defense.
My Songs shall thy deserved Praise resound:
For at my Prayers thou will my Foes confound.
Sorrows of Death on every side assailed,
and dreadful floods of Impious Men prevailed:
^^rrows of Hell my compast Soul dismayed;
and to entrap me, deadly Snares were laid.
(...) this Distress I cried, and called upon
^^e Lord, who heard me from his Holy Throne.
^^e trembling Earth in his fierce Anger struck;
^^h' unfixed roots of airy Mountains shook;
^^oke from his Nostrils flew; devouring Fire
^rake from his Mouth; Coals kindled by his Ire.
(...) his Descent bowed Heaven with Earth did meet,
and gloomy Darkness rolled beneath his Feet,
A Golden-winged Cherubin bestrid,
And on the swiftly flying Tempest rid.
He Darkness made his secret Cabinet; Part 2.

Thick Fogs, and dropping Clouds about him set:
The Beams of his bright Presence these expel;
Whence showers of burning coals and hailstones fell.
From troubled Skies loud claps of Thunder brake;
In Hail and darting Flames the Almighty spoke:
Whose Arrows my amazed Foes subdue;
And at their scattred Troops his Lightning threw.
The Ocean could not his deep Bottom hide;
The Worlds concealed Foundations were descri'd
At thy rebuke, Jehovah; at the blast
Even of the breath which through thy Nostrils past.
He with extended arms his Servants saves,
And drew me sinking from the enraged waves:
From my proud foes by his assistance freed,
Who swollen with hate, no less in strength exceed.
Without his Aid, I in that stormy Day
Of my affliction, had become their prey:
Who from those straits of danger by his Might
Enlarged my Soul; for I was his delight.
Part 3.
The Lord according to my innocence,
And Justice, did his saving grace dispense.
The narrow Path by him prescribed, I took;
Nor like the wicked, my Great God forsook.
For all his Judgments were before mine eyes;
I with his statutes daily did advise,
And ever walked before him, void of guile:
No act or purpose did my soul defile.
For this he recompensed my righteousness
And crowned my innocence with fair success.
The merciful shall flourish in thy Grace;
Thy Righteousness the Righteous shall embrace:
Thou to the Pure thy Purity wilt show;
And the perverse shall thy averseness know.
For thou will thy afflicted People save;
The proud cast down, down to the greedy grave.
Thou Lord wilt make my taper to shine bright,
And clear my darkness with celestial Light.
Through Thee I have against an Host prevailed;
And by thy aid, a lofty Bulwark scaled.
Part 4.
Gods Path is perfect, all his Words are just;
A Shield to those that in his promise trust.
What God is their in Heaven or Earth but ours!
What Rock but He, against assailing Powers!
He breathed new strength and courage in the day
Of Battle, and securely cleared my way.
He makes my feet outstrip the nimble Hind,
Up to the Mountains, where I safety find.
It Is he that teaches my weak hands to fight:
A Bow of steel is broken by their might.
Thou did thy ample Shield before me set;
Thy Arm upheld, thy Favor made me great.
The passage of my steps on every side,
Thou have enlarged, left my feet should slide.
^llowed, overtook; nor made retreat,
^till victorious in my Foes defeat;
^ charged with wounds, that they no longer stood;
^t at my feet lay bathed in their blood.
^ou arm'st me with prevailing Fortitude*
^^d all that rose against me have subdued:
^^eir stubborn necks subjected to my Will,
^^at I their blood, who hate my Soul, might spill.
^^ey cried aloud; but found no succor near:
^ thee, Jehovah; but thou would not hear.
^ounded them like dust, which Whirle-winds raise* Part 5.

^od under-foot as dirt in beaten ways.
^om Popular Fury thou have set me free;
among the Heathen have exalted me;
whom unknown Nations serve: as soon obey
^s hear of me; and yield unto my sway.
^he Stranger-born, beset with horror, fled;
and in their close Retreats betray their dread.
^ praise the living Lord, the Rock whereon
^ build; the God of my Salvation!
^is he who rights my wrongs; the People bends
^o my Subjection; from my Foe defends.
^hou raisest me above their proud control;
and from the violent Mar have freed my Soul.
^he Heathen shall admire my Thankfulness:
My Songs shall thy immortal Praise express.
A great and manifold Deliverance
God gives his King: his mercy does advance
(...) his Anointed; and will shower his Grace
^ternally on David and his Race.
PSALM XIX.
As the 8 th.
GOds Glory the vast Heavens proclaim;
The Firmament, his mighty Frame.
Day unto Day, and Night to Night
The wonders of his Works recite.
To these nor speech nor words belong,
Yet understood without a Tongue.
The Globe of Earth they compass round;
Through all the world disperse their sound.
There is the Suns Pavillion set;
Who from his Rosy Cabinet,
Like a fresh Bridegroom shows his face;
And as a Giant, runs his race.
He rises in the dawning East,
And glides obliquely to the West:
The World with his bright Rays repleat;
All Creatures cherished by his heat.
Gods Laws are perfect, and restore
The Soul to life, even dead before.
His Testimonies, firmly true,
With Wisdom simple men indue.
Part 2.
The Lords Commandments are upright,
And Feast the Soul with sweet delight.
His Precepts are all Purity,
Such as illuminate the Eye,
The fear of God, soiled with no stain,
Shall everlastingly remain.
Jehovah's Judgments are Divine;
With Judgment he does Justice join:
Which men should more than Gold desire,
Then heaps of Gold refined by Fire:
More sweet than Honey of the Hive,
Or Cells where Bees their Treasure slive.
Thy Servant is informed from thence:
They, their Observers recompense.
Who knows what his Offenses be?
From secret sins O cleanse thou me!
And from presumptuous Crimes restrain;
Nor let them in thy Servant reign:
So shall I live in Innocence,
Not spotted with that great Offense.
My Fortress, my Deliverer;
O let the Prayers my Lips prefer,
And Thoughts which from my Heart arise,
Be acceptable in thine Eyes.
PSALM XX.
THe Lord in thy Adversity As the 7.

Regard thy cy;
Great Jacobs God with Safety arm,
And shield from harm:
Help from his Sanctuary send,
And out of Sion thee defend.
Thy Odors, which pure flames consume,
Be his Perfume:
May he accept thy Sacrifice,
Fired from the Skies.
For ever thy endeavors bless;
And crown thy Counsels with success.
We will of thy Deliverance sing,
Triumphant King:
Our Ensigns in that pray'd^for Day
With Joy display;
Even in the Name of God. O still
May he thy just Desires fulfill!
Now know I his Anointed He
Will hear, and free;
With saving Hand and Mighty Power,
From his high Tower.
These trust in Horse; in Chariots those;
Our trust we in our God repose.
Their wounded limbs with anguish bend,
To Death descend:
But we in fervor of the fight
Have stood upright.
O save us, Lord; thy Suppliants hear:
And in our aid, Great King, appear.
PSALM XXI.
As the 15.
LOrd, in thy Salvation,
In the Strength which thou have shown,
Greatly shall the King rejoice.
How will Joy exalt his Voice!
Thou have granted his request;
Of his Hearts desire possessed;
Blessed with Blessings manifold;
Crowned with sparkling Gems and Gold.
Praid-for Life thou granted have;
Length of Days which never waste;
By thy Safeguard glorious made;
With high Majesty arrayed:
Of resistless Power possessed;
By thy favors ever blessed.
Lo! his Joys are infinite;
Joy reflected from thy sight:
For the King in God did trust.
Through the Mercy of the Just,
He shall ever fixed stand.
For thy Hand, thy own right Hand,
Shall thy Enemies destroy,
Who would in thy ruin joy.
When thy Anger shall awake,
Them a flaming Furnace make.
God shall swallow in his Ire,
And devour them all with fire.
From the Earth destroy their Fruit;
Never let their Seed take root.
Mischievous was their intent;
All their Thoughts against me bent;
Thoughts, which nothing could perform.
Let thy Arrows, like a Storm,
Put them to inglorious flight;
On their daunted faces light.
Lord, aloft thy Triumphs raise,
While we sing thy Power and Praise.
PSALM XXII.
^ Cantus.

MY God! O why have thou forsook!
^ Bassus.

^
Why, O so far, withdrawn thine Aid!
^
^
Nor when I roared, pity took! My God, by
^
^
day to Thee I prayed, And when Nights
^
^
Curtains were displayed: Yet would not
^
^
Thou vouchsafe a look.
^
Yet thou art Holy; throned on high;
The Israelites thy Praise resound.
Our Fathers did on thee rely;
Their Faith with wreaths of Conquest crowned
They sought, and thy Deliverance found;
They trusted, and thy Truth did try.
But I, a worm, no man, am made
The scorn of men; despised by all:
Who shake their Heads, make mouths, upbraid.
Let God, say they, redeem from thrall,
On whom thy Hopes so vainly call:
Now let him his Beloved aid.
Thou drew'st me from the Womb; by Thee
Confirmed at my Mothers breast:
When born, Thou took'st the charge of me;
Even from my Birth, my God professed.
O succor me with fear distressed!
Thou can alone thy Servant free.
Incensed Bulls about me stare; Part 2.

Strong Bulls of Bashan girt me round:
Who their inflamed mouths prepare,
Like ravenous Lions, to confound.
I Am spilt like water on the ground;
And all my Bones disjointed are.
My Heart like Wax within me thaws;
My vigor as a Pot-sheard dried:
My thirsty Tongue cleaves to my jaws;
In dust of Death thou do me hide:
Dogs compass me on every side;
And multitudes, who hate thy Laws.
My Hands and Feet transfixed are;
Bones, to be told, with anguish waste:
This seen with joy, my robes they share;
Lots on my seamless garment cast.
My Strength, to my redemption haste!
Nor O be deaf to my sad prayer!
Let not the Sword thy Servant wound;
My Dearling from the Dog protect:
From Lions that in rage abound;
From Unicorns guard thy Elect.
I then my Brethren will direct;
Among the Saints thy Praise resound.
Part 3.
O praise him you who fear the Lord;
You Sons of Jacob, God adore:
Let Isreal's Seed his praise record;
For from their cries who help implore,
His Face he hides not, nor the Poor
In their Affliction has abhorred.
I in the great Assembly shall
Declare his Works, which words exceed;
And pay my Vows before them all.
The Meek abundantly shall feed;
The Faithful praise their Help at need,
Nor by the stroke of Death shall fall.
All who behold the Suns Up-rise,
Shall God profess, and serve alone:
And all the Heathen Families
Shall cast themselves before his Throne;
Because the Kingdom is his own:
For over all his Empire lies.
Who in prosperity abound,
Nor undeserved Honors gain;
Who poorly creep upon the ground,
And scarce their needy lives sustain;
Shall eat, and to his easy reign
Submit, with joys eternal crowned.
Their sanctified Posterity
Shall ever celebrate his Name;
Adopted Sons of the most High:
They shall his Righteousness proclaim,
And Works of everlasting fame,
To their believing Progeny.
PSALM XXIII.
THe Lord my Shepherd, As the 8.
me his Sheep
Will from consuming Famine keep.
He fosters me in fragrant Meads,
By softly-sliding waters leads;
My Soul refreshed with pleasant juice:
And lest they should his Name traduce,
Then when I wander in the Maze
Of tempting sin, informs my ways.
No terror can my courage quail,
Though shaded in Deaths gloomy vail;
By thy Protection fortified:
Thy Staff my Stay, thy Rod my Guide.
My Table thou have furnished;
Powered precious Odors on my head:
My Mazer flows with pleasant Wine,
While all my Foes with envy pine.
Thy Mercy and Beneficence
Shall ever join in my Defense;
Who in thy House will sacrifice,
Till aged Time close up mine eyes.
PSALM XXIV.
As the 8.
THe round and many-peopled Earth,
What from her womb extract their birth,
And whom her foodful breast sustains,
Are his, who high in glory raigns.
The Land in moving Seas has placed,
By ever-toiling Floods embraced.
Who shall upon his Mountain rest?
Who in his Sanctuary feast?
Even he, whose hands are innocent;
His heart unsoil'd with foul intent;
Whom swollen Ambition, Avarice,
Nor tempting Pleasures can entice:
Who only their infection fears;
And never fraudulently swears:
The Lord his Savior him shall bless,
And cloth him with his Righteousness.
Such are of Jacobs Faithful Race,
Who seek him, and shall find his Face.
You lofty Gates, your Leaves display*
You everlasting Doors, give way;
The King of Glory comes. O sing
His Praise! Who is this glorious King?
The Lord in Strength, in Power complete;
The Lord in Battle more than great.
You lofty Gates, your Leaves display;
You everlasting Doors give way;
The King of Glory comes. O sing
His praise! Who is this glorious King?
The Lord of Hosts, of Victory,
Is King of glory; throned on high.
PSALM XXV.
ON Thee with Confidence I call, As the 2.

To thee my troubled Soul erect:
Lord, let not shame my look deject,
Nor Malice triumph in my fall.
Thy Servants save; but those confound,
Who Innocence with slander wound.
In thy disclosed paths direct;
Thy Truth, that leading Star display:
O my Redeemer! every day
My dangers thy relief expect.
Think of thy Mercies shown of old;
Thy Mercies more than can be told.
The sins of my unbridled Youth,
Nor frail Transgressions call to mind:
Let those that seek, thy Mercy find,
Even for the honor of thy Truth.
God, ever just and good, the way
Of life will show to such as stray.
The Meek in righteousness shall guide;
To such his heavenly Will express*
Which shall with Truth and Mercy bless
All such as in his Laws abide.
My sins, so numerous and great
O ^or thy honor, Lord, forget!
What Is he who fears The ever-Blest? Part 2.

To him shall he his Paths disclose:
His Soul refreshed with calm repose;
The Land by his fair Race possessed:
To him his Counsels shall impart,
And seal his Covenants in his heart.
On thee with fixed Eyes I wait:
My feet enlarge thou from their snares.
O pity me so worn with cares;
Despised, poor, and desolate!
The troubles of my mind increase;
Lord, from their galling yoke release!
Behold thou my affliction,
The toil and straits, wherein I live*
My sins, so infinite, forgive.
Behold my Foes, how potent grown!
How are they multiplied of late,
Who hate me with a deadly hate!
Deliver, O! from shame protect;
Since from my Faith I never swerve:
Let Innocence and Truth preserve,
Who constantly thy aid expect.
Redeem thy chosen Israel,
And sorrow from his breast expel.
PSALM XXVI.
LOrd, judge my cause: thy piercing Eye
As the 4 th.
Beholds my Souls integrity.
How can I fall;
When I, and all
My hopes on thee rely?
Examine, try my reins and heart;
Thou, Mercies Source, my object art:
Nor from thy Truth
Have I in Youth,
Or will in Age depart.
Men sold to sin offend my sight;
I hate the two-tongu'd Hypocrite:
Those who devise
Malicious lies,
And in their crimes delight.
But will, with hands immaculate,
And offerings, at thy Altar wait:
Thy Praise disperse
In grateful verse;
Thy Noble Acts relate.
Thy House, in my esteem, excels:
The Mansion where thy Glory dwells.
My life O close
Not up with those,
Whose sin thy Grace expells!
Who guiltless blood with pleasure spill:
Subverting bribes their right-hands fill;
Bold in offense.
But Innocence
And Truth shall guard me still.
Redeem; O with thy Grace sustain!
My feet now stand upon the plain.
Thy Justice I
Will magnify,
With those who fear thy Name.
PSALM XXVII.
As the 10.
GOd is my Savior, my clear light:
Who then can my repose affright?
Or what appear
Worth such a fear,
My life protected by his Might?
Vain hatred, vain their power,
That would my life devour.
These fell, when they against me fought:
The Wicked suffered what they sought.
Though troops of foes
At once enclose,
Of fear I would not lodge a thought:
Should Armies compass me;
So confident in thee.
One thing I have, and shall request;
That I may in thy Mansion rest,
Till Death surprise
My closing eyes:
That they may on thy beauty feast;
That in thy Temple still
I may enquire thy Will.
When storms arise on every side,
He will in his Pavillion hide:
How ever great,
In that retreat
I shall concealed and safe abide.
He, to resist their shock,
Has fixed me on a Rock.
Now is my head advanced, renowned
Above my foes, who gird me round;
That in my Tent
I may present
My sacrifice with Trumpets sound:
There I thy praise will sing,
Set to a well-tuned string.
O hear thou my afflicted cry; Part 2.

Extend thy pity, and reply.
When thus the Lord
In sweet accord;
Seek thou my Face with searching Eye.
Directed by thy Grace,
Lord, I will seek thy Face.
Thy Face O therefore never hide!
Nor in thine anger turn aside
From him that has
Served thee with faith.
Forsake me not, my ancient Guide;
So often in dangers known:
O leave me not alone.
Although my Parents should forsake;
Yet, Lord, thou would to Harbor take.
O lest I stray,
Teach me the Way,
And in thy Precepts perfect make:
Because my enemies
Watch like so many Spies.
Expose me not to their desire;
For lying witnesses conspire,
Who in their breath
Bear Wrath and Death.
My Soul had sunk beneath their ire,
But that I did rely
On thy benignity.
In hope to see (within the Land
Of those that live) thy saving hand.
He shall impart
Strength to thy heart.
Wait on the Lord, undaunted stand;
His heavenly Will attend,
Who timely aid will send.
PSALM XXVIII.
As the 5th.
MY God, my Rock, regard my Cry;
Lest I unheard, like those that die,
In shades of dark Oblivion lie.
To my ascending Grief give ear,
When I my hands devoutly rear
Before thy Mercy-seat with fear.
With wicked men mix not my Fate;
Nor drag me with the Reprobate,
Who speak of Peace, but foster hate*
Such as their works, their dire intent,
And practices to circumvent;
Such be their dreadful punishment.
Since they will not thy Choice renown,
But hate whom thou intend'st to crown;
O build not up, but pull them down!
He hears! His Name be magnified!
My Strength, secured on every side,
^ince all my hope on him relied.
These Seas of Joy my Tears devour.
My Songs shall celebrate thy Power,
O thou that art to thine a Tower.
O thou my strong Deliverance,
Thy People, thine Inheritance,
Bless, feed, preserve, and still advance.
PSALM XXIX.
^ Cantus.

YOu that are of Princely Birth,
^ Bassus.

^
Praise the Lord of Heaven and Earth; Glory
^
^
give, his Power proclaim; Magnify and
^
^
praise his Name.
^
Worship; in the Beauty bless,
Beauty of his Holiness.
From a dark and show'ring Cloud,
On the floods that roar aloud,
Hark! his Voice with terror breaks:
God, our God in Thunder speaks.
Powerful in his Voice on high,
Full of Power and Majesty:
Lofty Cedars overthrown,
Cedars of steep Libanon,
Calf-like skipping on the ground.
Libanon and Sirion bound,
Like a youthful Unicorn,
Laboring Clouds with Lightning torn.
At his Voice the Desert shakes;
Kadish, thy vast Desert quakes.
Trembling Hindes then calve for fear;
Shady Forests bare appear:
His renown by every tongue
Through his Holy Temple sung.
He the raging Floods restrains:
He a King for ever raigns.
God his People shall increase,
Arm with Strength, and bless with Peace.
PSALM XXX.
MY Verse shall in thy praises flow: As the 14.

Lord, thou have raised my head on high;
Nor suffered the proud Enemy
To triumph in my overthrow.
I cried aloud; thy Arm did save;
Thou drew'st me from the shades of Death,
Repealing my exiled breath,
When almost swallowed by the Grave.
You Saints of his, oh sing his praise!
Present your Vows unto the Lord;
His perfect Holiness record,
Whose Wrath but for a Moment stays.
His quickening Favor life bestows:
Tears may continue for a night;
But Joy springs with the Morning Light;
Long-lasting Joys, soon-ending Woes.
In my Prosperity I said, Part 2.

My feet shall ever fixed abide:
I, by thy favor fortified,
Am like a steadfast Mountain made.
But when thou hid'st thy cheerful Face;
How infinite my Troubles grew!
My cries then with my grief renew,
Which thus implored thy saving Grace:
What profit can my blood afford,
When I shall to the Grave descend?
Can senseless Dust thy Praise extend?
Can Death thy living Truth record?
To my Complaints attentive be;
Thy Mercy in my aid advance:
O perfect my Deliverance,
That have no other Hope but Thee!
Thou, Lord, have made the Afflicted glad;
My Sorrow into Dancing turned:
The Sackcloth torn wherein I mourned,
And me in Tyrian Purple clad:
That so my Glory might proclaim
Thy Favors in a joyful Verse;
Uncessantly thy Praise rehearse,
And magnify thy sacred Name.
PSALM XXXI.
Cantus.
^
WHo trusts in Thee, O let not
Bassus.
^
^
shame deject! Thou ever Just, my chased
^
^
Soul secure: Lord, lend a willing ear, with
^
^
speed protect; Be thou my Rock; with
^
^
thy strong Arm immure.
^
My Rock, my Fortress, for thy Honor aid,
And my engaged feet from Danger guide:
Pull from their subtle Snares in secret laid,
O thou my only Strength so often tried.
To thy safe Hands my Spirit I commend,
O my Redeemer, O thou God of Truth.
Who Lies invent, or unto Idols bend,
I have abhorred, but loved Thee from my Youth.
I will rejoice, and in thy Mercy boast,
That in his trouble would thy Servant know:
Deliver, when in expectation lost;
Nor yield him to the Triumph of his Foe.
Part 2.
Now help the Comfortless: my Sight decays,
My Spirits faint, my Flesh consumes with care:
My Life is spent with grief, in sighs my Days;
My Strength through Sin dissolves, my Bones impare^
To all my Foes I am become a scorn;
Nor least to those, who seemed in love most near
By all my late familiar Friends forlorn;
Who when they meet me, turn aside for fear.
Forgot like those, who in the Grave abide,
And, as a broken vessel, past repair:
Traduced by many, (fear on every side)
Who counsel take, and would my life ensnare.
But, Lord, my Hopes are on thee fixed: I said,
Thou art my God; my Days are in thy Hand*
Against my furious Foes oppose thy Aid;
And those, who persecute my Soul, withstand.
O let thy Face upon thy Servant shine;
Save for thy Mercies sake; from Shame de^end.
Shame cover those who keep no Laws of thine;
And undeplored to the Grave descend.
Part 3.
The lying lips in endless silence close,
That with despite and pride traduce the Just.
What Joy have thou reserved! what wrought for thos^
(In sight of all) who fear, and in thee trust!
Those shall Thou in thy secret Presence hide
From their Oppressors violence and wrongs;
They in thy close Pavilion shall abide,
Secured from the strife of envious Tongues.
Blessed he! who in a walled City has
To me his wonderful Affection shown.
I rashly said, I am the food of Wrath;
Cut off; for ever from his Presence thrown.
Yet thou, O ever blessed, heard'st my Prayer,
When to thy Mercy I address my Cry.
O love the living Lord, all you that are
His chosen Saints, and on his Aid rely.
For he the Faithful ever will preserve;
And render to the Proud their full deserts.
Courageous be all you, who hope, and serve
The Lord of Life, who will confirm your hearts.
PSALM XXXII.
^ Cantus.

Blessed, O thrice blessed is he, Whose
^ Bassus.

^
Sins remitted be; And whose Im-pi -- e -- ties
^
^
God covers from his Eyes.
^
To whom his Sins are not
Imputed, as forgot:
His Soul with guile unstained.
While silent I remained,
My bones consumed away;
I roared all the day:
For on me day and night
Thy Hand did heavy light.
My moisture dried throughout,
Like to a Summers drought.
I then my Sins confessed,
How far I had transgrest:
When all I had revealed,
Thy Hand my Pardon sealed.
For this, who Godly are
Shall seek to Thee by Prayer;
Seek, when thou may be found;
In Deluges undrown'd.
Thou art my safe Retreat,
My Shield, when dangers threat;
Shall my Deliverance
With Songs of Joy advance.
I will instruct, and show
The way which thou should go;
The way to Piety;
And guide thee with mine eye.
Be not like Mule and Horse,
Whose reason is their Force;
Whose mouth the Bit and Rein,
Lest they rebel, restrain.
Innumerable Woes
The Wicked shall enclose:
But those who God affect,
His Mercy shall protect.
O you, who are upright,
In God your God delight:
You Just, his blessed Choice,
In Him with Songs rejoice.
PSALM XXXIII.
TO God, As the 8th.
you Just, your Voices raise;
It you beseems to sing his Praise.
O celebrate the King of kings
On Instruments strung with ten Strings:
To Harp and Lute new Dities sing:
Sing loud with skillful fingering.
His Words are crowned by their event;
And all his Works are permanent.
Justice and Judgment he affects:
His Bounty upon all reflects.
His Word the arched Heavens did frame;
His Breath, the Stars eternal Flame.
He the collected Seas confines,
And folds the Deep in Magazines.
The Lord, O all you Nations, fear;
All whom the Earths round shoulders bear.
He spoke, 'twas done as soon as said;
At his Commandment steadfast made.
The People counsel take in vain;
Their Projects no success obtain.
The Counsels of the Lord are sure;
His Purposes no Change endure.
Blessed they, whose God Jehovah is;
The Nation set apart for his.
The Lord looks from the lofty Skies;
On careful Mortals casts his Eyes:
The Lord looks from his Residence;
The Sons of men beholds from thence.
He fashioned their hearts alone:
To him their Thoughts and deeds are known.
No King is saved by an Host;
No Giant in his strength should boast:
There rests no Safety in a Horse;
None are delivered by his force.
Gods eyes are ever on the Just,
Who fear, and in his Mercy trust;
To free their Souls from swallowing Earth,
And keep alive in time of Dearth.
Our fervent Souls on God attend,
Our help, who only can defend:
In whom our Hearts exult for joy;
Because we on his Name rely.
Great God to us propitious be,
As we have fixed our Hopes on thee.
PSALM XXXIV.
^ Cantus.

THe Lord I will for ever bless; My
^ Bassus.

^
Tongue his praises shall profess, In him my
^
^
Soul shall boast: The Meek shall hear the
^
^
same, and joy: His Name, with me, O magnify;
^
^
Extol the Lord of Hosts.
^
My Prayers ascending pierced his ear;
Who snatched me from those storms of fear.
The Meek who God expect,
Who flow to him like living Brooks,
Shame never shall distain their looks,
Nor with foul guilt infect.
This Wretch in his adversity
(Then men shall say) to God did cry,
Whose Mercy him secured.
The Angels of Jehovah those,
Who fear him, with their Tents enclose,
By Strength divine immured.
How good our God, O taste and see!
Who trust in him thrice happy be*
You Saints, O fear him still:
Such feel no want; the Lions rore
For hunger; but who God implore,
He shall with Plenty fill.
Come children, with attention hear,
I will instruct you in his fear.
What man delights in life?
Seeks to live happily and long?
From evil guard thy wary Tongue*
Thy lips from fraud and strife*
Do good, and wicked deeds eschew;
Seek sacred Peace, her steps pursue.
Gods Eyes are on the Just;
Their cries his open Ear attends:
But on the Bad his wrath descends,
Their Names reduced to dust.
He hears the Righteous, and their cry;
^reserv'd in their adversity:
A broken heart affects,
And Souls contrite which in Him trust.
Great are the afflictions of the Just;
But He in all protects:
Keeps every bone of theirs entire.
The Wicked swallows in his Ire,
And who the Righteous hate.
The Lord his Servants shall redeem;
Those ever dear in his esteem,
Who on his Promise wait.
PSALM XXXV.
LOrd, As the 3.
plead my cause against my foes;
With such as fight against me, fight:
Arise, thy ample Shield oppose,
And with thy Sword defend my right.
Address thy Spear; those in their way
Encounter, who my Soul invade:
To her O let thy Spirit say,
I am thy God, and saving Aid.
Let those, who my disgrace contrive,
Hang down their heads, for flight designed:
Who seek my fall, let Angels drive
Like Chaff before the blustering wind.
Obscure and slippery be their path;
Let winged Troops pursue their foil;
Since they for me with causeless wrath
Have dig'd a pit, and pitched a Toil;
Let sudden ruin them destroy;
Mesht in the Nets themselves had laid:
Then in the Lord my Soul shall joy,
And glory in his timely Aid.
My Bones shall say, O who like thee,
That arm'st the Weak against the Strong;
That do the Poor and Needy free
From outrage, and too powerful wrong?
Part 2.
False witnesses against me stood,
Who unknown accusations brought:
That Evil rendered for Good,
And closely my confusion sought.
I in their sickness did condole;
Unfainedly in Sackcloth mourned:
With fasting humbled my sad Soul,
And often to my Prayers returned:
Him visited both Night and Day,
As if an ancient Friend or Brother:
In Black upon the Earth I lay,
And wept as for my dying Mother.
Yet these rejoiced in my woe,
False Comforters about me crowd;
And least I should their cunning know,
They rent their Cloths, and cried aloud.
Like Hypocrites at Feasts, they jeer;
Whose gnashing teeth their hate profess:
O Lord, how long will thou forbear,
And only look on my distress?
O save from those, who smile, and kill;
My Dearling from the Lions Jaws:
I in the great Assembly will
Then praise thy Name with full applause.
Part 3.
Let not my causeless Enemies
Rejoice in my afflicted state:
Nor wink at me with scornful eyes,
Who swell with undeserved hate.
Of Peace they speak not; rather they
The peaceable with fraud pursue:
Who wry their mouths at me, and say,
Ha, Ha! our eyes thy ruin view.
This seen, O stand no longer mute;
Nor, Lord, desert my Innocence.
Awake, arise: O prosecute
My Cause, and plead in my Defense.
With Justice Judge: nor let them say
In triumph; We our wish possess:
Not in their mirthful hearts, Ha, Ha!
W' have swallowed him in his distress.
Wrath and confusion seize on those,
Who in my tribulation joy:
Let them who glory in my woes,
Be clothed with shame and infamy.
Let those eternally rejoice,
Who favor and assist my right:
For ever with exalted voice
The goodness of our God recite.
And say, O magnify his Name,
Who glories in his servants peace.
My tongue his Justice shall proclaim,
Nor ever in his praises cease.
PSALM XXXVI.
WHen I the bold Transgressor see, As the 34.

My thoughts thus whisper unto me;
He never feared the Lord:
He smooths himself in his own eyes,
'Till his secure impieties
Become of all abhorred.
Their words are vain, and full of guile:
They Wisdom from their hearts exile;
Forsaken Virtue hate:
Who mischief on their Beds contrive;
Through by-ways to bad ends arrive,
And vices propagate.
Thy Mercy, Lord, is throned on high;
And thy approved Fidelity
The lofty Sky transcends:
Thy Justice like a Mountain steep;
Thy Judgments an unfathomed Deep;
Who man and beast defends.
O Lord, how precious is thy Grace!
The sons of men, their comfort place,
Beneath thy shady wings:
They with thy Household dainties shall
Be fully satisfied, and all
Drink of thy pleasant Springs.
For O! from thee the Fountain flows,
Which endless Life on thine bestows;
Inlight'ned with thy Light.
On such as know thee shower thy Grace;
O let thy Justice those embrace,
Who are in heart upright.
Let not the feet of Pride defeat;
Nor such as are in mischief great
My guiltless Soul surprise.
The workers of iniquity
Are fallen like Meteors from the sky:
Cast down, no more to rise.
PSALM XXXVII.
VEx not thy self at the impiety As the 1.

Of wicked men, nor their frail height envy.
^or they shall soon be mowed, like Summers Hay;
And as the verdure of the Herb decay.
^rust thou in God; do good, and long in peace
Possess the Land; refreshed by her increase.
Be he thy sole delight; He shall inspire
Thy raised thoughts, and grant thy hearts desire.
Rely, and to his care thy ways commend,
Who will produce them to a happy end.
He shall thy Justice, like the Light display,
And make thy Judgment as the Height of Day.
Rest on the Lord, and patiently attend
His Heavenly Will: nor let it thee offend,
Because the wicked in their courses thrive;
And prosperously at their desires arrive.
Abstain from anger, heady wrath eschew:
Nor fret thou, lest ill Deeds ill Thoughts pursue.
God will cut off the Bad, the Faithful bless;
Who shall the ever-fruitful Land possess.
After a while the Unjust shall cease to be; Part 2.

Thou shall his place consider, but not see.
The Meek in heart shall reap the Lands increase,
And solace in the multitude of Peace.
Against the Godly wicked Men conspire,
Gnash their malicious Teeth, and foam with ire;
But God shall laugh at their impiety;
Because he knows their Day of Doom is nigh.
They draw their bloody Swords, their Bows are bent
To kill the Needy, Poor, and Innocent.
But their proud hearts shall perish by the stroke
Of their own Steel, their Bow's asunder broke*
That little which the Righteous has, excells
The abundant wealth, wherein the Wicked swells.
For God the arms of violent Men will break:
But shield the Righteous, and support the Weak*
His eyes behold the sufferings of the Poor:
Their firm possessions ever shall endure.
They in the time of danger shall not dread;
But shall in Famin's rage be filled with Bread.
When vicious men shall speedily decay:
And those who slight Jehovah, melt away
As fat of Lambs, which sacred Fires consume;
And forthwith vanish like the rising fume.
Part 3.
The Wicked borrow, never to restore:
The Just are gracious and relieve the Poor.
Whom God shall bless, they shall the Land enjoy*
Whom God shall curse, them vengeance shall destro^
The steps of Righteous men the Lord directs;
For He, even He, their ordered paths affects.
Although they fall; yet fall to rise again:
For his His Care and powerful Hand sustain.
I have been young, am old; yet never saw
The Just abandoned; nor those, who draw
From him their birth, with beggary oppressed.
He lends in mercy, and his Seed are blessed.
Do good, shun evil, and remain unmoved;
For Righteous Souls are of the Lord beloved:
His undeserted Saints protecting still;
Their Plants up-rooting, who transgress his Will.
Just men inherit shall the promised Land;
And dwell therein, while Mountains steadfast stand
The Righteous Soul of sacred Judgment speaks, Part 4.

And from his Lips a spring of Wisdom breaks.
Gods Law is in his Heart; his Light, his Guide;
Nor shall his Feet in slippery places slide.
Men seek his blood; but God defends: nor shall
He by the sentence of the Wicked fall.
Wait on the Lord, nor his straight paths transgress;
And evermore this pregnant Soil possess.
But those who in iniquity delight,
Shall be cut off, and perish in thy sight.
The Wicked I have seen in wealth to flow,
Exceed in power, and like a Laurel grow:
Yet vanish hence, as he had never been;
I sought him, but he was not to be seen.
Observe the perfect, and the pure of heart;
They die in peace, and happily depart.
But the Ungodly are at once cut down,
And perish without pity, or renown.
The Lord is the salvation of the Just;
Their strength in trouble, since in him they trust:
Will those assist, who on his aid depend;
Deliver, and from impious Foes defend.
PSALM XXXVIII.
NOT in thy wrath against me rise; As the 4.

Nor in thy fury, Lord, chastise:
Thy Arrows wound,
Nail to the Ground,
Thy hand upon me lies.
No Limb from pain and anguish free;
Because I have incensed thee:
Nor rest can take,
My bones so ache;
Such sin abounds in me.
Like Billows they my head transcend;
Beneath their heavy load I bend:
My Ulcers swell,
Corrupt, and smell;
Of Folly the sad end.
Perplexed in mind I pine away,
And mourning waste the tedious day;
My Flesh no more
Then all one Sore;
All parts at once decay.
Much broken; all my strength o're-thrown;
Through anguish of my Soul I groan.
Lord, thou do see
My thoughts and me*
My Sighs to thee are known.
My sad Heart pants, my nerves relent,
My Sight grows dim; and to augment
My miseries,
All my Allies
And Friends themselves absent.
Part 2.
Who seek my life, their Snares extend;
Their wicked thoughts on Mischief bend:
Calumniate,
And lie in wait
To bring me to my end.
But I as deaf to them appear,
As mute, as if I tongueless were:
My passion ruled,
Like one that could
At all not speak nor hear.
Because my hopes on thee rely:
My God, I said, O hear my cry;
Lest they should boast,
Who hate me most,
And in my ruin joy.
For O! I droop, with struggling spent:
My thoughts are on my sorrows bent.
My sins excess
I will confess;
In showers of tears repent.
My foes are full of strength and pride;
Who causeless hate, are multiplied:
Who good with ill
Repay; would kill,
Because I just abide.
Depart not, Lord; O pity take!
Nor me in my extremes forsake!
Salvation
Is thine alone;
Have to my succor make.
PSALM XXXIX.
^ Cantus.

I Said, I will my ways observe, Lest
^ Bassus.

I should swerve: With Bit and Reins my
^
^
Tongue keep in, Too prone to Sin. Nor

^
I, like a Statue, silent stood,
Dumb even to good:
My Sorrows boiling in my breast
Exiled my rest:
But when my Heart incenst with wrong
Grew hot, I gave my Grief a tongue.
Of those few days I have to spend,
And my last End,
Inform me, Lord; that I may so
My Frailty know.
My time is made short as a Span;
As nothing is the Age of man.
Man nothing is but Vanity,
Though throned on high;
Walks like a shadow, and in vain
Turmoils with pain:
He heaps up wealth with wretched care,
Yet knows not who shall prove his Heir.
Lord! what expect I? thou the Scope
Of all my Hope:
Him from his loathed Transgressions free,
Who trusts in Thee:
Nor O subject me to the Rule,
And proud derision of a Fool!
With silence, since thy Will was such,
I suffered much:
O now forbear! lest instant Death
Force my faint breath.
When thou do with thy Rod chastise
Offending man, his courage dies.
His Beauty wasted, like a cloth
Gnawn by the Moth:
Himself a short-lived vanity,
And born to dye.
Lord, to my Prayers incline thine Ear,
And thy afflicted Servant hear.
Nor these salt rivers of mine Eyes,
My God, despise:
A Stranger, as my Fathers were,
I sojourn here.
O let me gather strength, before
I pass away, and be no more.
PSALM XL.
As the 2.
FOr God I patiently did look;
He to my cries inclined his Ear:
And when environed with fear,
From that Abyss of horror took:
Drew from the Mud, and on a Rock
Established, to endure the shock.
Then did into my mouth convey
Songs of his Praise, un-sung before.
Many shall see, with fear adore;
And trusting in the Almighty, say:
Who on the Lord depend, are blessed;
Who Liers, and the Proud detest.
Many, and full of wonder, are
The Works, O Lord, which Thou have wrought:
What Thou to raise our joys have thought,
O who in order can declare!
'Twere lost endeavor to express
Their number, that are numberless.
Thou Gifts, nor Offerings do desire:
But pierced have thy Servants ear:
To Thee Oblations are not dear,
Nor Sacrifice consumed with fire.
Then said I; Lo, I come: thus it
Is of me in Thy Volume writ.
Thy Laws are written in my Heart:
My Joy Thy Pleasure to fulfill.
I in the great Assembly still
Thy Righteousness to all impart.
My lips are unrestrained by me,
Which, Lord, is only known to Thee.
Thy Justice I have not concealed
Within the closure of my breast:
But Thy Fidelity professed;
And saving health at large revealed:
Amidst the Congregation
Thy constant Truth and Mercy shown.
Withdraw not, Part 2.
Lord, thy longed for Aid;
With Truth and Mercy still enclose;
For O! innumerable woes
On every side my Soul invade:
So changed with Iniquities,
That they even blind my fearful eyes.
In number they my hairs exceed;
My fainting heart pants in my breast:
Be pleased to succor the Distressed;
And Lord deliver me with speed.
Let shame at once confound them all,
That seek my Soul, and plot my fall.
Be they repulst with Infamy,
Who persecute with deadly hate:
Deservedly left desolate,
Who Ha, Ha! in derision cry.
Let all who seek thy Help, rejoice,
And praise Thee with a cheerful Voice.
Let them, who thy Salvation love,
Still say; The Lord be magnified!
Though I be poor, and cast aside;
Yet he regards me from above.
My Safety, my Deliverer,
No longer thy relief defer.
PSALM XLI.
As the 7.
WHo duly shall the Poor regard,
Has his Reward:
The Lord in time of Trouble, shall
Prevent his fall:
He shall among the Living rest,
And with the Earths increase be blessed.
Lord, render him not up to those,
Who are his Foes:
When he in sorrow languisheth,
Near unto Death;
Let him by Thee be comforted,
And in his Sickness make his bed.
I said, O Lord, thy Mercy show,
And Health bestow:
For O! my Soul the loathsome stains
Of Sin retains.
My Foes have said, When shall he die,
And yet outlive his Memory?
^f any visit, they devise
Deceitful Lies:
Their hollow Hearts with Mischief load,
Divulged abroad:
Who hate me, whisper, and contrive,
How they may swallow me alive.
Behold, say they, this Punishment
From Heaven is sent:
He from the bed whereon he lies,
Shall never rise.
Yea, even my Friend, my Confident,
My Guest, his heel against me bent.
But, Lord, thy Mercy I implore;
My Health restore:
O raise me! that forthwith I may
Their Hate repay.
^n this thy Love thou do express,
That none triumph in my distress.
For thou art of my Innocence
The strong Defense.
^ shall, inlighted by the Grace,
Behold thy Face.
^ehovah, Isreal's God, be blessed;
While Day and Night the World invest.
Amen, Amen.
A PARAPHRASE Upon the Second BOOK OF THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM XLII.
As the 34.
LOrd! as the Heart, imbost with heat,
Braies after the cool Rivulet:
So sighs my Soul for thee.
My Soul thirsts for the living God:
When shall I enter his Abode,
And there his Beauty see!
Tears are my Food both Night and Day;
While, Where Is thy God; they daily say.
My Soul in plaints I shed;
When I remember, how in throngs
We filled thy House with Praise and Songs;
How I their Dances led.
My Soul, why art thou so deprest!
Why O thus troubled in my breast!
With Grief so overthrown!
With constant Hope on God await:
^yet his Name shall celebrate,
For Mercy timely shown.
My fainting Heart within me pants:
My God, consider my Complaints;
My Songs shall praise thee still:
Even from the Vale where Jordan flows;
Where Hermon his high Forehead shows,
From Mitsars humble Hill.
Deeps unto Deeps enraged call, Part 2.

When thy dark Spouts of waters fall,
And dreadful Tempest raves:
For all thy Floods upon me burst,
And billows after billows thrust
To swallow in their Graves.
But yet by Day the Lord will charge
His ready Mercy to enlarge
My Soul, surprised with cares:
He gives my Songs their Argument;
God of my life, I will present
By night to thee my prayers.
And say; My God, my Rock, O why
Am I forgot, and mourning die,
By Foes reduced to Dust!
Their words like weapons pierce my bones;
While still they Echo to my Groans,
Where is the Lord thy Trust?
My Soul, why art thou so deprest!
O why so troubled in my breast!
Sunk underneath thy Load!
With constant Hope on God await:
For I his Name shall celebrate;
My Savior, and my God.
PSALM XLIII.
As the 34.
MY God, thy Servant vindicate:
O plead my Cause against their hate,
Who seek my utter spoil!
Deliver from the Merciless,
Who with bold Injuries oppress,
And prosper in their guile.
For of my Strength thou art the Lord.
Why like to one by thee abhorred
Do thou my Soul expose!
Why wander I in black araid!
My body worn, my mind dismayed!
Pursued by cruel Foes!
Thy Favor and thy Truth extend;
Let them into my Soul descend,
Conducted by their light;
Conducted to thy holy Hill,
And House blessed with thy Presence still;
There to enjoy thy sight.
Then will I to thy Altar bring
An acceptable offering,
That do such Joys afford:
There on a tuneful Instrument,
With Songs that join in sweet consent,
Thy sacred praise record.
My Soul, why art thou so deprest!
Why O thus troubled in my breast!
Sunk underneath thy load!
With constant hope on God await;
For I his Name shall celebrate,
My Savior and my God.
PSALM XLIV.
LOrd! As the 3.
we have heard our Fathers tell
The Wonders wrought by thee of old,
To them by their great Grandsires told;
How by thy Hand the Heathen fell;
Of fruitful Canaan dispossessed,
And Israel planted in their room;
They perished by a fearful Doom,
While ours in growth and strength increast.
Not their own Swords that pleasant Land
Did conquer, and their Foes eject;
Nor did their arms their lives protect:
It was thy Arm and powerful Hand;
It was the Splendour of thy Face;
And by thy Favor they o're-came.
My King, my God, O still the same!
Salvation send to Jacobs Race.
For by thy Aid our Enemies
Lay bleeding on the stained ground;
And in thy Name we did confound
Who ever durst against us rise.
Our Sword's unable to defend;
We will not trust in our weak Bows.
Thou, Lord, have saved us from our Foes,
And brought them to a shameful end.
Part 2.
For this with praises we adore,
And ever celebrate thy Name:
But now Thou casts us off to shame,
Nor lead'st our Armies as before.
Our faces from our Foes reverst;
A Spoil to such as hunt for blood:
Thou giv'st us up as Sheep for food,
Among the uncircumsised dispersed.
For naught thou do thy People sell,
Nor art enriched by their price;
Our Neighbors in our fall rejoice;
A Scorn to all that near us dwell.
A Byword to the Heathen grown,
Who shake their heads in our disgrace:
My shame is still before my face;
My Eyes to Earth with blushes thrown.
Sprung from the bold blasphemers taunts,
And proud Avengers threatening look:
Yet, Lord, we have not thee forsook,
Nor falsify'd thy Covenants.
Part 3.
Our hearts have not their Faith dissolved;
Our Steps the Path prescribed keep:
Though Thou have crushed us in the Deep,
And with the shades of Death involved.
^or should we from the Lord depart,
Or to strange Gods our hearts uprear;
O would not this to him appear,
Who knows the Secrets of our Heart?
Yet for thy sake are daily slain;
For slaughter marked like butchered Sheep.
Awake, O Lord, why do thou sleep?
Rise, nor for ever Us disdain.
O to thy Own at length return!
Why do Thou hide thy cheerful face?
Withdrawing thy accustomed Grace
From such as in Affliction mourn?
For lo! our Souls, are wrapped in dust;
Our bellies to the Center cleave:
O, for thy Mercies sake receive,
And succor those who in Thee trust!
PSALM XLV.
WIth heat divine inspired, As the 8.
I sing
A Panegyric to the King:
High Raptures in a numerous style
I with a ready Pen compile.
Much fairer than our Humane Race;
Whose lips like Fountains flow with Grace:
For this the Lord thy Soul shall bless
With everlasting Happiness.
Gird, O most Mighty, on thy Thigh
Thy Sword of Awe and Majesty:
In triumph, armed with Truth, ride on;
By Clemency and Justice drawn.
No mortal vigor shall withstand
The fury of thy dreadful Hand.
Thy piercing Arrows in the Kings
Opposers hearts shall dye their wings.
Thy Throne no wast of Time decays;
Thy Scepter sacred Justice sways.
Thou Virtue love; but have abhorred
Deformed Vice: for this, the Lord
Has thee alone preferred, and shed
The Oil of Joy upon thy head.
Thy Garments, which in Grace excel,
Of Aloes, Myrrh, and Cassia smell;
Brought from the Ivory Palaces:
Which more than other Odors please.
Kings Daughters to augment thy State,
Among thy noble Damfels wait.
The Queen enthroned on thy right hand,
Adorned with Ophyr's golden Sand.
Part 2.
Hark Daughter, and by me be taught;
Thy Country banish from thy thought,
Thy House and Family forget,
His Joy upon thy Beauty set.
He is thy Lord; O bow before,
And him eternally adore!
The Daughters of Sea-circled Tire
Shall bring their Purple, and desire
(Even they whom Wealth and Honor grace)
To see the sweetness of thy Face.
Her Mind all Beauties does infold;
Her fair limbs clad in purfled Gold,
She shall unto the King be brought,
In Robes with Phrygian Needle wrought:
While Virgins on her Train attend,
Whose Faith and Friendship know no end:
Whom they with joy shall lead along;
Eternized in a Nuptial Song:
And with renewed Applauses bring
Unto the Palace of the King.
Thou in thy Royal Fathers place,
Of Sons shall see a numerous Race;
Who over all the Earth shall sway,
While the clear Sun directs the Day.
My Song shall celebrate thy Name,
And to the World divulge thy Fame.
PSALM XLVI.
^ Cantus.

GOd is our Refuge, our strong Tower;

^
Securing by his Mighty Power, When
^
^
Dangers threaten to devour. Thus Armed, no
^
^
fears shall chill our blood; Though Earth no
^

longer steadfast stood, And shook her Hills

into the flood.
^
Although the troubled Ocean rise
In foaming billows to the Skies;
And Mountains shake with horrid noise.
Clear streams purl from a Crystal Spring,
Which Gladness to Gods City bring,
The Mansion of the eternal King.
He in her Center takes his place:
What Foe can her fair Towers deface,
Protected by his early Grace?
Tumultuary Nations rose,
And armed Troops our walls enclose;
But his feared Voice unnerv'd our Foes.
The Lord of Hosts is on our side;
The God by Jacob magnified;
Our Strength, on whom we have reli'd.
Come, see the wonders he has wrought;
Who has to desolation brought
Those Kingdoms, which our ruin fought.
He makes destructive War surcease;
The Earth, deflowered of her Increase,
Restores with universal Peace.
He breaks their Bows, unarms their Quivers,
The bloody Speer in pieces shivers,
Their Chariots to the Flame delivers.
Forbear, and know, that I the Lord
Will by all Nations be adored;
Praised with unanimous accord.
The Lord of Hosts is on our side;
The God by Jacob magnified;
Our Strength, on whom we have reli'd.

^
Whole Nations of our Foes
Beneath our Feet has thrown:
A fair Possession chose,
For us that are his Own:
The dignity
Of Israel;
Beloved so well
By the most High.
In Triumph God ascends,
With Trumpet shrill, and Shalmes;
Praise him, who his defends;
O praise our King with Psalms!
For God is King
Of all the Earth;
With sacred Mirth
His Praises sing.
God over the Heathen reigns;
Sits on his Holy Throne:
All whom the Earth sustains,
Shall worship him alone.
His Shield extends
In their Defense;
His Excellence
All height transcends.
PSALM XLVIII.
THe Lord is most Majesticall; As the 8.

Most highly to be praised by all,
Within the City of our God,
And Mansion blessed by his abode.
Fair Sion has a pleasant Site;
Of Earth the Beauty and Delight:
Upon the North-side bordering,
The City of the Mighty King.
God dwells within her lofty Towers;
Secured from all assailing Powers.
Conspiring Kings her ruin sought;
Who armed Troops before her brought.
Part 2.
At once they saw, admired, and fled;
Their hearts surpised with sudden Dread.
Such fear, such pangs possessed our foes,
As women suffer in their Throws.
At thy command black Eurus rores,
And spreads his wracks on Tharsian shores.
We, what we heard our Fathers tell,
Have seen, who in this City dwell;
The City of our God, which He
Shall ever from destruction free.
Thy Favors, Lord, with Thankfulness
We in thy Temple still profess.
As is thy Name, thou God of Might,
So are thy Praises infinite;
And stretch to Earths remotest Bound:
Thy Hand for Justice far renowned.
O Sion, Judah's Diadem,
You Daughters of Jerusalem,
Unite your Joys, and glory in
His Judgment, which your eyes have seen.
Go walk the Round of Sion; tell
Her Towers; observe her Bulwarks well:
On her fair Buildings cast thine eye;
Declare it to Posterity.
For God will still our God remain,
And us unto our Last sustain.
PSALM XLIX.
ALL you who dwell upon the foodful Earth; As the 1.

Both Rich and Poor; of base and noble birth;
Attend: my Tongue deep wisdom shall impart;
And knowledge from the fountain of my heart.
I unto light dark Parables will bring,
And to my solemn Harp Aenigmaes sing.
In Misery and Age why should I fear,
When Sin pursues my steps, and Death draws near?
O you, who Riches as your God adore,
And glory in your scarce possessed Store:
Who can redeem his Brother for one Day,
Or to the Lord his high-prais'd Ransom pay?
(For O, not all the Gold, which Streams conceal,
Or Hills enclose, can banished Life repeal,)
That he might live unto Eternity,
Nor in the Earths corrupting Entrails lie.
They see the Wise, and Fools, to Death descend,
While others their congested treasures spend:
Yet hoping to perpetuate their fame,
Proud Structures raise, and call them by their name.
But Man in honor is a Vanity, Part 2.

That fleets away; and as a Beast must die.
In this vain course, they circularly move,
And their Posterity their words approve.
Death shall as Sheep devour them in the Dust;
Till that great Day subject them to the Just.
Their Strength and Beauty shall to nothing wast:
All naked, from their sumptuous Houses cast.
But God shall from the greedy Sepulcher
My Soul redeem, and to his Joys prefer.
Despair not, when a man grows Opulent,
And that the Glories of his House augment:
For with his thread of Life his Riches end;
Nor shall his Honors with his Soul descend.
Though here he live in luxury and ease;
And those are praised, who their own Genius please;
Yet as his Fathers, he shall set in Night;
Nor ever rise to see the cheerful Light.
Man high in honor, whose ignoble breast
No knowledge holds, shall perish like a beast.
PSALM L.
As the 1.
THe God of gods, Jehovah, shall convent
All from the Orient to the Suns descent.
From Sions Towers (of Beauty the Divine
And full Perfection) shall his Glory shine.
Nor silent comes: devouring flames before,
And round about him horrid Tempests rore.
The righteous Judge, to judge his People, shall
High Heaven and conscious Earth to witness call.
Assemble all my Saints, who with one mind
My Testaments with Sacrifice have signed.
Then thundering Sky shall make his Justice known;
When he our God ascends his Judgments Throne.
My People, hear; Thy God, O Israel!
Will thee convince, and thy Transgressions tell.
I blame not thy unfrequent Sacrifice,
Nor fumes, which rarely from my Altars rise:
I from thy Stall will take no well-fed Steer,
Nor from thy Folds a Male-goat of that year:
For all are Mine, that Woods or Deserts breed,
And Herds which on a thousand mountains feed:
^ know all Fowl, which Hill or Valleys yield,
And number all the Cattle of the Field.
Will I, Part 2.
if hungry, unto Thee complain,
When all is Mine which Sea and Land contain?
Will I eat flesh of Bulls? or can thou think,
That I the blood of shaggy Goats will drink?
A thankful heart upon my Altar lay;
And righteous Vows to high Jehovah pay.
Then call on me in trouble; I will raise
Thy Soul from Death, and thou my Name shall praise.
But O thou Hypocrite! Dare thou explain
My Law; My Covenants with thy lips profane?
That scorn'st instruction; do my Word despise;
Consent'st with Thieves, and have adulterous eyes?
Deceit, and slander tip thy impious tongue:
Thy brother woundst with Infamy and Wrong.
Thus did thou; this did I with silence see,
^o as thou thought, that I was like to thee.
^ut I will thy Hypocrisy uncase;
And lay thy ugly crimes before thy face.
Consider this, O you, who God neglect:
^est I destroy you, when none can protect.
Who praise for Incense offer, honor Me;
And upright Souls shall my Salvation see.
PSALM LI.
LOrd, As the 3.
to a sinner Mercy show:
Which since in Thee so infinite;
Let all thy streams of Mercy flow,
And purify me in thy sight.
O wash thou my polluted Soul!
O cleanse me from my bloody Deed
That to my self appears so foul;
And now in true Contrition bleed.
My sins, unmasked, before Thee lie;
Who have deserved thy wrath alone:
Which I confess, to testify
Thy Truth, and make thy Justice known.
In sin conceived, brought forth in sin;
Sin sucked I from my Mothers breast:
Thou love a heart sincere within,
Where Wisdom is a constant guest.
With Hysop purge, from blemish clear;
O wash, then falling Snow more white!
Lord, let me thy remission hear:
The Bones, which thou have broke, unite.
Blot out my crimes; O separate
My trembling Guilt far from thy view!
A clean Heart in my breast create;
A Mind, to Thee confirmed, renew.
Part 2.
Nor cast me from thy Presence, Lord:
Nor O thy holy Spirit withdraw!
But thy life-quick'ning Grace afford;
Enlarge my Will to embrace thy Law.
Then Sinners I with heavenly Food
Will feed, directed in thy Ways:
O my Redeemer, cleanse from blood
The Soul, that will thy Mercy praise.
Give thou my Verse an argument;
And they thy Goodness shall resound.
No Sacrifice will Thee content;
Nor Altars with Oblations crowned.
Else, I would Hecatombs impart:
True sorrow is thy Sacrifice.
A broken and a contrite Heart,
My God, Thou never wilt despise.
Thy Sion with accustomed Grace
(Lest my foul crimes her shame procure)
In thy protecting Arms embrace;
And fair Jerusalem immure.
Then we, with due Solemnity,
To Thee our grateful Vows will pay;
And Bulls, which never Yoke did try,
Upon thy flaming Altar lay.
PSALM LII.
O Thou in Mischief great, As the 32.

Why boasts thou in deceit?
Gods greater Mercy will
Protect his Servants still.
Thy Tongue with fraud abounds,
And like a Rasor wounds;
All evil do affect;
All that is good neglect.
Lies are thy low delight;
To Virtue opposite:
Thy words with treachery
The innocent destroy.
God shall repay thy hate,
Thy Structures ruinate;
And make thee curse thy birth:
Then tear thee from the Earth.
The Just thy fall shall see,
Fear Him, and laugh at thee.
Lo he, who God forsook,
Nor for his refuge took;
Self-strength'ning with excess
Of Wealth, and Wickedness.
But I shall planted be,
Like a green Olive Tree,
In Gods own House; and will
Trust in His Mercies still.
For this, I evermore
Shall thy great Name adore:
Thy Promises expect;
The joy of thy Elect.
PSALM LIII.
As the 12.
FOols, flattering their own vices, say
Within their hearts; God is a Name
Devised to make the Strong obey;
To fetter Nature; quench her flame:
When all this Universal Frame
The hands of potent Fortune sway.
Secure and prosperous in ill,
The fear and thought of God exile,
To follow their rebellious will;
Think nothing that delights them vile:
Their Souls with wicked thoughts defile;
And all their foul Desires fulfill.
God from the Tower of Heaven his Eyes
On men, and their endeavors, threw:
Not one beheld beneath the Skies,
That sought him, or his Statutes knew:
All Vice with winged Feet pursue;
But none forsaken Virtue prise.
O deaf to good! in knowledge blind!
By Sin through clouds of error led!
Dull sensual Forms, without a Mind!
Not slow, though certain, Vengeance dread!
The Righteous they devour like bread;
All piety at once declined.
These, idle terrors shall affright;
Their sleeps disturbed by guilty fear.
God shall their Bones asunder smite,
Who impious Arms against him bear;
Nor they their Infamy out-wear;
Since despiseable in his sight.
O that unto thy Israel
The Day Star might from Sion spring!
And all the shades of Night expel!
When Thou shall us from Bondage bring,
How would we Lord thy Praises sing!
No joy shall Jacobs joy excel.
PSALM LIVE.
LOrd, As the 4.
for thy Promise sake defend,
And Thy All-saving Shield extend:
O hear my cries,
Which with wet Eyes
And sighs to Thee ascend!
For cruel men my life pursue;
And who thy Statutes never knew.
Suppress my Foes:
O side with those,
Who to my soul are true!
With vengeance recompense their Hate,
And in an instant ruinate.
Then will I bring
My Offering,
And thy great Acts relate.
Thy Name for ever praised be;
Who from those snares have set me free:
For lo, these eyes
My Enemies
Desired subversion see.
PSALM LV.
As the 39.
LOrd, to my Prayers incline thine Ear;
The afflicted hear:
Nor be thou Deaf to my complaint;
For O I faint!
Regard the sighs, the groans, the cries,
Which from my pensive Soul arise.
Raised by the threatenings of my Foe,
Which storm-like grow;
And by blood thirsty Violence;
Truth my offense:
Who slander with their wounding Tongues,
And press me unto Death with wrongs.
My heart, a stranger unto rest,
Throbs in my breast:
The terrors of approaching Death
Exhaust my breath.
My sinews trembling Fear dissolves,
And Horror all my Powers involves.
O that with Dove-like wings I might
Take my swift flight,
To calm Retreats of rest, where I
Concealed might lie!
Then would I find some Wilderness,
Removed far from man's access.
Then all these Tempests, which arise
With hideous noise;
And with their dreadful Tumults make
My Heart to quake;
I would, far swifter than the Wind,
Or winged Lightnings leave behind.
Lord, Part 2.
swallow those, who swell with pride;
Their Tongues divide:
For Strife, and Violence, bent to kill,
The City fill:
Both Day and Night they walk the Round;
Rape, Mischief, Tears, within abound.
Wild Outrages her streets profane,
And boldly reign:
Fraud lurking in her Palaces,
Conspires with these.
For I, had he his hate professed,
Had shunned, or should his wrongs digest.
But thou, my Friend, even of my Heart
The better Part;
To so entire a union grown,
As if but one:
Gods House we daily visited,
Both sweetly by one Counsel led.
Let Death devour them; let them dive
To Hell alive.
With mischief their proud roofs abound
Their hearts unsound:
But God my Soul shall dis-enthrall;
For I upon his Name will call.
Part 3.
My Prayers shall with the Suns uprise,
Ascend the Skies;
Renewed, when he at Noon displays
His fervent Rays;
When he behind the Earth descends,
And Day, out-worn with labor, ends.
My Cries shall penetrate the Spears,
And pierce his Ears.
He shall my captive Soul release,
And crown with Peace.
For in the Fervor of the Fight,
His Angels shall protect my Right.
The Eternal Judge, Jehovah, shall
Confound them all;
Who only change from bad to worse,
Nor fear his Curse.
Sweet Peace he violated has,
And broken his obliged Faith.
His Words than Butter smoother far;
His Thoughts of War:
Words softer than the fluent Oil;
Yet bent to Spoil.
But thou, my Soul, thy cares impose
On God, who will redress thy woes.
The Just he shall confirm with Joy;
The Unjust destroy.
Those who in blood and fraud delight,
Shall set in Night,
Before their Noon of Life be past.
But I on God my hopes have placed.
PSALM LVI.
O Lord, As the 4.
protect me by thy Power,
From such as would my Life devour;
Who merciless
Strive to oppress;
Nor grant me Truce one hour.
That would devour me every Day,
And make my chased Life their prey:
Yet, Lord, will I
On thee rely;
When Dangers most dismay.
Thy Promise I will celebrate;
In constant hope thy Pleasure wait;
With patience bear
Thy Stay; nor fear
Frail man, or his vain hate.
My words and deeds they daily wrest,
And in their thoughts my fall digest;
Unite in ill,
And lurk to kill:
My Feet can find no rest.
O shall they with impunity*
Escape, and thus their sins enjoy!
Let Death thy rage
Alone assuage;
Them in their guilt destroy.
My Wand'rings thou have numbered;
Even every Tear mine Eyes have shed
Thy Vial holds:
All in the Folds
Of thy large Volume read.
Assured, that when on God I call,
My Foes shall by his Fury fall.
His Promise I
Will magnify;
His Truth divulge to All.
To him my ready Vows will pay;
My Vows of Thanks, both night and day:
In whom I trust:
Nor shall the Unjust
My steadfast Hopes dismay.
For he has snatched me from the Night
Of Death, and kept my foot upright:
That I may still
Observe his Will,
And see the cheerful Light.
PSALM LVII.
O Thou, As the 10,
from whom all Mercy springs,
Compassionate my Sufferings;
And pity me,
That trust in Thee!
O shelter with thy shady Wings,
Until these storms of Woe
Clear-up, or over-blow!
Thee I invoke, O thou Most High,
Thou All-performer! from the Sky
Thy Angels send;
Let them defend
My Soul from him that would destroy:
O send thy Mercy down;
With Truth thy Promise crown!
For Salvage Lions girt me round,
And they whose Malice knows no bound;
Their cruel Words
More sharp than Swords;
Their Teeth like Spears and Arrows wound.
To Heaven thy Glory raise;
Let Earth resound thy Praise.
They subtle snares prepared have,
And bowed my Souleven to the Grave:
With wicked wit
Have dug a pit,
From which themselves they could not save*
But justly fell therein,
Intrapt by their own Sin.
My ravished Heart flames with desire;
I to the Music of my Lyre,
Eternal King,
Thy Praise will sing.
Awake my Glory! Zeal inspire!
Awake my Harp and Lute,
Nor in his Praise be mute!
To thee, before the Morning rise,
My Lips their Calves shall sacrifice:
Thy Mercy far
The highest Star,
Thy Truth transcends the lofty Skies.
To Heaven thy Glory raise;
Let Earth resound thy Praise.
PSALM LVIII.
As the 46.
PErnicious Counselors! Give you
Sincere advice? to Justice true?
Or Virtue but in show pursue?
Your Hearts are still on Mischief bent;
Your Hands impure and violent;
Nor favor Truth, nor Wrong prevent.
Even from the womb they blindly stray;
Born, and perverted in one day;
Lie, slander, flatter, and betray:
Like Serpents, with black poison swell;
And charm the Inchanter never so well,
More deaf than Asps, his Charms repel.
Lord, slit their Tongues, before they speak;
Strike out their Teeth, which tear the Weak;
And the young Lions grinders break.
As Sun-beat Snow, so let them thaw;
And when their weak'ned Bows they draw,
Let their cracked Arrows fly like straw.
Let them like Snails consume away;
And as untimely Births decay,
Which never saw the cheerful Day.
Before their pots can feel the brier,
God in the Whirlwind of his Ire,
Shall blast alive, and burn with fire.
Sin with Revenge at length shall meet;
The Godly shall rejoice to see it;
And in their blood shall wash their feet.
Then erring Mortals shall confess,
There are Rewards for Righteousness,
And Plagues for such as do transgress,
PSALM LIX.
LOrd, As the 34*
save me from mine Enemies;
From those, who thus against me rise,
Like an incensed Flood:
From those, who in Impiety
Place their delight, and long to die
Their hands in guiltless blood.
Lo! for my Soul they lie in wait:
The Mighty join their power and hate,
Without my blame or crime.
Without my crime they weapons take;
And persecute my soul. Awake
My God! assist in time.
Great God of Hosts, of Israel,
These all-oppressing Tyrants quest;
Nor be to Mercy won:
At night their mischief they begin;
Incenst like snarling Dogs they grin,
And through the City run.
Behold! they vomit bitter words;
Between their lips they brandish swords;
Yet say; Can these be known?
But, Lord, thou shall their threats deride;
The empty terror of their pride
And Malice, vainly shown.
Part 2.
I and my strength are in thy Power.
In thee I trust, my Shield! my Tower!
Thy Mercy, Lord, how great!
My Foes subjectest to my will:
Subdue, and scatter; but not kill,
Lest we thy Truth forget.
O be they in their Pride surprised!
Even for the Lies they have devised,
Their curses, and close Arts.
Consume them, from the Land expel:
To show, God reigns in Israel,
To Earths remotest parts.
Hopeless let them return with Night,
Like grinning Dogs bark, but not bite;
About the City rome:
Pale, meager, and half famished;
Like vagabonds howl they for bread;
Without or food, or home.
But I, before the Day Star spring,
Will of thy Power and Mercy sing;
My safety in distress.
Thou art my Rock, my strong Defense;
My living Verse thy Excellence
And Bounty shall express.
PSALM LX.
CAst off, As the 2*
and scattered in thine Ire:
Lord on our woes with pity look.
The Lands enforced Foundations shook;
Whose yawning ruptures Sighs expire.
O cure the Breaches Thou have rent,
And make Her firmly permanent!
Our Souls thou have with sorrow fed;
And made us drink of deadly Wine:
Yet now thy Ensigns giv'st to Thine,
Even when beset with trembling dread;
That we thy Banner may display,
Whilst Truth to Conquest makes our way
O hear us, who thy Aid implore;
Lord, with thy own Right hand defend:
To thy Beloved succor send.
God by his Sanctity thus swore;
I Succoths Valley will divide;
In Shechems Spoils be magnified.
Mine Gilead is, Manasseh mine;
Ephraim my strength, in battle bold;
Thou Judah shall my Scepter hold:
I will triumph on Palastine.
Base servitude shall Moab waste;
Over Edom I my shoe will cast.
Who will our forward Troops direct,
To Rabbah strongly fortified?
Or into sandy Edom guide?
Lord, wilt not thou, that did reject,
Nor would before our Armies go,
Now lead our Host against the Foe?
O then, when Dangers most affright,
Do thou our troubled Souls sustain!
For lo! the help of Man is vain.
Through Thee we valiantly shall fight:
Our flying Foes thou shall tread down;
And Thine with wreaths of Conquest crown.
PSALM LXI.
As the 13.
MY God, thy Servant hear;
O lend a willing ear*
In exile my sad heart,
From Earths remotest part,
Overwhelmed with Miseries,
To Thee for succor cries.
To that High Rock O lead,
So far above my head!
That were, and art my Tower,
Against oppressing Power.
For to thy sacred Court
I ever shall resort;
Secure beneath thy wings,
From all their menacings:
Even Thou my suit have signed;
A King by Thee designed,
To govern such as will
Thy Holy Law fulfill.
Whom Thou long life wilt give,
His Ages shall outlive;
He Throne shall stand before
Thy Face for evermore.
Thy Mercy, Lord, extend;
Him for thy Truth defend.
Then I in cheerful Lays
Will celebrate thy praise;
And to Thee every day
My Vows devoutly pay.
PSALM LXII.
LOrd, As the 15.
thou art the only Scope
Of my never-fainting Hope;
My Salvation, my Defense,
Refuge of my Innocence:
Thou the Rock I build upon,
Not by man to be o're-thrown.
How long will you machinate!
Persecute with causlels hate!
You shall like a tottering wall,
Like a battered Bulwark, fall.
All conspire to cast me down;
From my brows to tear my Crown:
Full of fraud, they bless in show,
When their Thoughts with curses flow.
Yet my Soul on God attends;
All my Hope on him depends;
He the Rock I built upon,
Not by man to be o're-thrown.
He my Glory, he my Tower,
Guards me by his saving Power.
You, who are sincere and just,
In the Lord for ever trust:
Power your Hearts before his Throne;
His, who can protect alone.
All that are of high Descent,
To the Poor and Indigent,
Nothing are but Vanity;
Nothing but deceive and lie:
Balanced, altogether they
Lighter than a Vapor weigh.
In Oppression trust thou not;
Nor in Wealth by Rapine got:
If thy Riches multiply,
See thou prize them not too high.
God said once; twice have I heard;
Power is his, by Him conferred:
His is Mercy, He rewards,
And, as we deserve, regards.
PSALM LXIII.
As the 34.
TO Thee, O God, my God, I pray,
Before the dawning of the Day.
My Soul and wasting flesh,
With thirsty Ardor Thee desire,
In Soils scorched with ethereal Fire,
Whose draught no showers refresh:
That in thy Sanctuary I
May see thy Power and Majesty,
Once more with ravished eyes:
My lips shall celebrate thy Praise;
Thy Goodness, more than length of days,
Or life it self, I prise.
Extolled while I have utterance:
To Thee will I my Palms advance;
That wilt with marrow feast.
My Verse thy Wonders shall recite;
Remembered in the silent Night,
As on my Bed I rest.
Secured beneath thy shady Wing,
I will in sacred Raptures sing;
And to thy Promise cleave.
Thy Hand upholds; but who with hate
My Soul seek to precipitate
Hells entrails shall receive.
The raging Sword shall shed their blood;
A prey for Wolves; for Foxes, food.
Yet God his King shall bless;
And such as swear by his great Name:
But those, whose Tongues the Just defame,
Confusion shall suppress.
PSALM LXIV.
As the 10.
THou great Protector, hear my Cry;
Save from my dreadful Enemy:
O vindicate
From their close hate,
Who for my Soul in ambush lie.
From their blind Rage protect,
Who Truth and Thee reject.
Who whet their Tongues, more sharp than Swords,
Their Arrows draw, even bitter words;
To wound the Upright,
With fierce delight,
When Time to their desire accords:
Then on a sudden shoot;
Nor fear divine pursuit.
Confirmed in skilful Malice; they
Conspire, their Nets in secret lay:
And say; What eye
Can this descry?
First counsel take; and then betray:
On mischief set their hearts,
Pursued by wicked Arts.
But God shall let his Arrows fly;
Wound in the twinkling of an Eye:
Each deadly stung
By his own Tongue,
Shall with that fatal Poison die.
Who this behold, or hear,
Shall tremble with cold fear.
Men shall their Eyes with wonder raise,
Rehearse his Deeds, and sing his Praise.
Eternity
Shall crown their Joy,
Who walk in his prescribed ways.
He to the Pure of Heart
His Glory shall impart.
PSALM LXV.
DUe Honors, As the 8.
Lord, on Thee attend,
Where Sions sacred Towers ascend:
There thy devoted Israelites
Shall pay their Vows, with solemn Rites.
To Thee shall all Mankind repair:
Since thou vouchsaf'st to hear our Prayer.
Our Sins thy Mercies expiate,
When burdened with their loathed weight.
Thrice happy he, of whom thou make
Thy Choice; and to thy service take;
That may within thy Courts reside;
There with thy Goodness satisfied;
And taste of that sincere Delight,
Which never cloys the Appetite.
From thee, O God, our Safety springs;
Thy Judgment threatens dreadful things.
Their Hope, whom Soils remote sustain;
Who flote upon the toiling Main.
Great is thy Power: propt by thy Hand,
Cloud-touching Mountains steadfast stand.
Thou with thy Scepter do appease
The roaring of the high-wrought Seas:
And the tumultuary jarrs
Of People breathing Blood and Wars.
Part 2.
Who dwell upon the Earth's Confines,
They tremble at thy fearful Signs.
Where first the Sun his beam displays;
And where he sets his golden Rays,
They triumph in the fruits of Peace;
Enriched by the Earth's increase.
He Rain upon her Bosom powers;
His swelling Clouds abound with Showers:
And so prepares the lusty Soil
To recompense the Reapers toil.
Mellows the Glebe with fatning juice,
Whose furrows hopeful blades produce:
With Plenty crowns the smiling Years,
Shed from the influence of the Spears:
The Desert with sweet Claver fills;
And richly shades the joyful Hills.
Flocks cover all the higher Plain:
The rancker Valleys clothed with Grain.
These in Abundance solacing,
Without a tongue thy Praises sing.
PSALM LXVI.
As the 29.
HAppy Sons of Israel,
Who in pleasant Canaan dwell,
Fill the Air with shouts of Joy;
Shouts redoubled from the Sky.
Sing the great Jehovah's Praise;
Trophies to his Glory raise:
Say; How wonderful thy Deeds!
Lord, thy Power all power exceeds!
Conquest on thy sword does sit;
Trembling Foes through fear submit.
Let the many-peopled Earth,
All of high and humble birth,
Worship our eternal King;
Hymns unto his honor sing.
Come, and see what God has wrought;
Terrible to humane thought.
He the Billows did divide;
Walled with waves on either side,
While we passed safe and dry:
Then our souls were wrapped with joy.
Endless his Dominion;
All beholding from his Throne.
Let not those, who hate us most;
Let not the Rebellious boast.
Bless the Lord; his Praise be sung,
While an Ear can hear a Tongue.
He our feet establishes;
He our souls redeems from Death,
Lord, Part 2.
as silver purified,
Thou have with Affliction tried:
Thou have driven into the net;
Burdens on our shoulders set:
Trod on by their Horses hooves;
Theirs, whom Pity never moves.
We through fire, with flames embraced;
We through raging floods have passed:
Yet by thy conducting hand,
Brought into a wealthy Land.
I will to thy House repair;
Worship, and thy Power declare:
Offerings on thy Altar lay;
All my vows devoutly pay,
Uttered with my heart and tongue,
When oppressed with powerful Wrong.
Fatlings I will Sacrifice;
Incense in perfumes shall rise;
Bullocks, shaggy Goats and Rams
Offered up in sacred flames.
You, who great Jehovah fear,
Come, O come, you blessed, and hear
What for me the Lord has wrought,
Then, when near to ruin brought.
Fervently to Him I cried;
I his Goodness magnified.
If I Vices should affect,
Would not He my Prayers reject:
But the Lord my Prayers has heard,
Which my tongue with tears preferred.
Sour^e of Mercy, be Thou blessed,
That have granted my Request.
PSALM LXVII.
As the 47.
LOrd, shower on us thy Grace,
Enrich with Gifts divine:
Let thy illustrious Face
Upon thy Servants shine:
That all below
The arched Sky,
May Thee, and thy
Salvation know.
Let all thy Praise rehearse,
With one united Voice:
Sing in melodious Verse;
Eternally rejoice.
Thy Power obey,
Whose Justice shall
Dispose of All;
All Scepters sway.
Let all extol thy Worth:
Then shall the smiling Earth
Her pleasant fruits bring forth;
Nor ever mourn in Dearth.
We who implore,
Thy Blessings find;
And all Mankind
With fear adore.
PSALM LXVIII.
LEt God, As the 8.
the God of Battle, rise;
And scatter his proud Enemies.
O let them flee before his face,
Like smoke, which driving tempests chase.
As Wax dissolves with scorching Fire;
So perish in his burning Ire.
But let the Just with joy abound:
In joyful Songs his Praise resound:
Who riding on the rolling Spears,
The Name of great Jehovah bears.
Before his Face your joys express:
A Father to the fatherless.
He wipes the tears from Widows eyes;
The single Plants in Families;
Enlarging those who late were bound:
While Rebels starve on thirsty Ground.
When he our numerous Army led,
And marched through Deserts, full of dread;
Heaven melted, and Earths Center shook,
With his majestic Presence struck.
When Isreal's God in Clouds came down,
High Sinai bowed his trembling Crown.
Part 2.
He in the approach of meager Dearth,
With showers refresht the fainting Earth:
Where his own Flock in safety fed;
The Needy unto plenty led.
By Him we conquer: Virgins sing
Our Victories, and Timbrels sing.
He Kings with their vast Armies foils;
While women share their wealthy spoils.
You who among the Pots have lain
In Soot and Smoke, shall shine again;
Bright, as the silver-feather'd Dove,
Whose wings with golden Splendour move.
When he the Kings had overthrown,
Our Land like snowy Salmon shone.
Gods Mountain Bashans Mount transcends;
Though he his many Heads extends.
Why boast you so, ye meaner Hills?
God with his Glory Sion fills:
This his beloved Residence;
Nor ever will depart from hence.
Part 3.
His Chariots twenty thousand were,
Which Myriads of Angels bear;
He in the midst, as when he crowned
High Sinai's sanctified ground.
Lord, Thou thy Self have raised on high;
Thou captivat'st Captivity.
Decked with the trophies of his Foes,
The gifts received on his bestows:
Reducing those who did rebel;
That both might in his Sion dwell.
O praised be the God of gods,
Who his with daily blessings loads:
The God of our Salvation,
On whom our hopes depend alone.
The Controverse of Life and Death
Is arbitrated by his Breath.
He on their heads his Foes shall wound;
Their hairy scalps, whose sins abound,
And in their trespasses proceed.
Thus spoke Jehovah; Jacobs Seed
I will from Bashan bring again,
And through the bottom of the Main:
That Dogs may lap their enemies blood;
And they wade through a crimson Flood.
We in thy Sanctuary late, Part 4.

My God, my King, beheld thy State.
The sacred Singers marched before;
Who instruments of Music bore,
In order followed: Every Maid
Upon her pleasant Timbrel played.
His Praise in your Assemblies sing,
You, who from Isreal's Fountain spring.
Nor little Benjamin alone,
But Judah from his Mountain-throne;
The far removed Zebulun;
And Naphtali which borders on
Old Jordan, where his stream dilates;
Joined all their Powers and Potentates.
For us his winged Soldiers fought:
Lord, strengthen, what thy hand has wrought.
He that supports a Diadem,
To Thee, divine Jerusalem,
Shall in Devotion treasure bring,
To build the Temple of his King.
Part 5.
Break through their Pikes; the multitude
Of Bulls, with savage strength indu'd;
Till they with gifts sweet Peace invite:
But scatter those, whom Wars delight.
Far off from Sunburned Meroe,
From falling Nilus; from the Sea
Which beats on the Egyptian shore,
Shall Princes come, and here adore.
You Kingdoms, through the World renowned,
Sing to the Lord; his praise resound:
He who Heavens upper Heaven bestrides,
And on her aged shoulders rides:
Whose voice the Clouds asunder rends;
In Thunder terrible descends.
O praise his Strength; whose Majesty
In Israel shines, his Power on high.
He from his Sanctuary throws
A trembling horror on his Foes:
While us his Power and Strength invest*
O Israel, praise the Ever-blest.
PSALM LXIX.
As the 22.
LOrd, snatch me from the raging Flood;
Now in deep Eddies almost drowned:
That struggle in the yielding mud,
There, where no bottom can be found:
The rising waves my head surround,
And with their terrors chill my Blood.
Tired with complaining; hoarse, and sore;
Sight fails my long-expecting Eyes:
My Hairs are not in number more
Than my uninjur'd Enemies.
The great in wrong against me rise;
I, what I never took, restore.
My God, Thou know my Innocence:
Let not the faithful blush for me,
Traduced by slanderous Impudence;
Nor O! let those that call on Thee,
Their shame in my Confusion see;
Since Thou art our professed Defense.
For Thee I suffer Calumnies;
To Men become a general scorn;
Deserted by my near Allies;
By children of my Mother born:
Through zeal unto thy Honor worn,
While thy reproach upon me lies.
I fasted, wept, in Sackcloth mourned;
My anguish in my looks expressed:
Yet this to my derision turned;
By Drunkards sung at every Feast:
Even Judges at my sorrow jest;
My Innocence by slander spurned.
Yet shall my Prayers and Sighs ascend Part 2.

Even in an acceptable hour.
Thy Mercy, gracious Lord, extend;
And save by thy Almighty Power.
Let not the swallowing mud devour:
Preserve from such a shameful end.
Deliver from the insulting Foe;
My struggling Feet from sinking keep:
Let not the Billows overflow,
Nor Whirl-pits suck into their Deep.
O pity Thou the Eyes that weep:
And thy Transcendent Mercy show.
Hear, and redeem without delay;
Nor in my trouble hide thy Face:
Lest I become a wretched prey
To such as have my Soul in chase.
My shame, indignities, disgrace
And all their crimes before Thee lay.
Reproach my bleeding heart has pierced:
Was ever Sorrow half so great!
Compassion has her Eyes averst;
My Grief no comfort could entreat:
They gave me bitter Gall to eat;
And Vinegar to quench my Thirst.
O be their board a snare to those!
Prosperity it self a Bait!
Their Eyes in clouds of darkness close;
And let them fall by their own weight:
Pour on them thy Eternal hate;
With vengeance multiply their woes.
Part 3.
In Ruins let their Houses lie;
None in their silent Tents be found;
That would, whom thou have smit, destroy;
And wounded Souls with slander wound.
Let their Iniquities abound,
Nor ever in thy Mercy joy.
Their names out of thy Volume blot;
Nor with the Just inthrone their Days.
Though poor; to misery begot;
Yet Thou shall my dejection raise:
Then will I celebrate thy Praise:
My thankful Heart no time shall spot.
This will Jehovah more delight,
Than Bulls prepared for Sacrifice:
Their gilded Horns with Garlands dight.
This shall the Meek with pleased Eyes
Behold, and centuple their joys:
Their Day shall never set in Night.
For God the Poor regards, and those,
Who for his sake affliction try.
Round Earth, deep Seas, what Seas enclose;
You Orbs, that move so orderly;
Our great Jehovah magnify,
Who crowns his Saints with sweet Repose.
For God his Sion shall immure,
And Judah's Cities build again:
Where they shall ever live secure;
A fair inheritance obtain:
There shall their blessed Seed remain;
And safely that rich Soil manure.
PSALM LXX.
As the 5.
Have, Lord; from such as would devour,
Defend by thy almighty Power:
Delay not in so feared an Hour.
But let confusion seize on those,
Who seek my soul; to shame expose:
Be sudden in their overthrows.
Let those with infamy return;
Dejected, and unpittyed, mourn;
Who laugh, and blast me with their scorn.
Who love thy Name, with joy invest:
Let them in shades of Safety feast;
And ever say, The Lord be blessed.
But I am poor, and full of need:
Have, Lord; deliver me with speed;
Our Strength, our Help, from Thee proceed.
PSALM LXXI.
As the 34.
I To thy Wing for refuge fly;
Protect me from foul Infamy;
Lord, in thy Justice ^ave.
Deliver from their treacherous Snares:
O favorably hear my Prayers;
Snatch from the yawning Grave.
Be thou my Fortress of Defense;
There let me fix my Residence.
O Thou, my Rock! my Tower!
Who have thy Angels given in charge,
That they thy Servants should enlarge
From circumventing Power.
Deliver from their cruel might,
Whose wicked hands in blood delight:
Lest I their pray become.
Thou art my hope; even from my Youth
Have I relied upon thy Truth;
By Thee kept in the womb:
From thence extracted by thy Care.
Though, as a Prodigy they stare
On me with wondering eyes;
Yet Thee, my strength, my Song shall praise,
And to the Stars thy glory raise,
While Suns shall set and rise.
O cast not off, Part 2.
when full of days;
Forsake not, when my Strength decays:
Watched by conspiring Foes.
God has abandoned him, say they;
Now let us make his life our prey:
Who shall our power oppose?
My God, close to thy servant stand,
And help him with a speedy hand:
Those in their pride confound,
Who persecute my wretched Soul;
Let Death their impious rage control,
And with dishonor wound.
But I will ever hope, and raise
My Voice to multiply thy Praise;
Thy Righteousness display,
Thy manifold Deliveries:
Which O! no number can comprise;
Thus spend the harmless Day.
I in thy Strength, though old and weak,
Will walk, and of thy Justice speak;
Of thine, even thine alone.
Thou have informed me from my Youth:
I, to this hour, with single Truth,
Thy wondrous works have shown.
Part 3.
Now in the Winter of my years;
When Time has snow'd upon my hairs,
Abandon not, O Lord;
Till I unto this Age proclaim
Thy Mighty Power; in Songs the same
Unto the next record.
Thy Counsels depth our search exceeds:
How admirable are thy Deeds!
O who is like to Thee!
Thou have afflictions on me lain;
Yet shall thou quicken me again,
And from Earths entrails free*
Still thou my glory wilt increase,
And comfort with the joys of Peace.
I, in a living verse,
Unto my warbling Harp will sing
Thy praises, O eternal King;
Thy noble Acts rehearse.
Unto my Voice, and Instrument
Shall my exalted Soul consent;
By Thee redeemed from Death:
Thy Justice every Day proclaim:
That now have clothed my Foes with Shame,
Dispersed by thy breath.
PSALM LXXII.
^ Cantus.

He King, Jehovah, with thy Justice
^ Bassus.

^
crown; And in a God-like reign his Son renown.
^
^
He shall with e -- qui -- ty thy People sway;
^
^
And Judgment in the scales of Justice weigh.
^
Then little Hills shall riot with increase;
And Mountains flourish in the fruits of Peace.
He shall the Poor from Violence protect;
Exalt the Humble, and the Proud deject.
They, while the restless Sun directs the Year;
While Moons increase and wain, thy Name shall fear.
He shall descend like plenty-dropping Showers,
Which cloth the earth, and fill her lap with flowers.
The Just shall flourish in his happy Days,
And Peace abound, while Stars extend their Rays.
He shall from Sea to Sea enlarge his Reign;
From swift Euphrates to the farthest Main.
The wild Inhabitants, that live by prey
In scorched Deserts, shall his Rule obey.
His Foes shall lick the Dust, rich with their Spoils.
Kings of the Ocean, and Sea-grasped Isles,
Shall orient Pearl, and sparkling Stones present;
Gold from the Sunburned Aethiopians sent.
The swart Sabaeans and Panchaia's King,
Shall Cas^ia, Myrrh, and sacred Incense bring.
Part 2.
All Kings shall homage to this King afford;
All Nations shall receive him for their Lord.
He shall the Oppressed hear, the Poor defend;
The Needy save, and such as have no friend:
Redeem their Souls from Fraud, and Violence;
And shall with Blood revenge their Bloods expense.
For this, he long and happily shall live:
To him they shall the Gold of Sheba give.
The People for their King shall hourly pray:
His Praises sing, and bless him day by day.
Rank crops of Corn shall on high Mountains grow,
And shake like Cedars, when rough Tempests blow.
The Citizens shall prosper and abound;
Like blades of Grass, which cloth the pregnant ground.
His Name shall last to all Eternity:
Even while the Sun illuminates the Sky.
All Nations shall in Him be blessed: Him all
The habitable Earth shall blessed call.
O praised be our God! that King of kings,
Who only can accomplish wondrous things!
For ever celebrate his glorious Name,
And fill the World with his illustrious Fame.
Amen, Amen.
Here end the Prayers of David the Son of Jesse.
A PARAPHRASE Upon the Third BOOK OF THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM LXXIII.
As the 1.
THat Power of powers, who Israel protects,
The Pure of heart eternally affects.
Yet I began to stagger in my Faith;
My Feet almost had swerved from his Path,
When I the Fool beheld with envious eyes;
Saw prosperous Vice to Wealth and Honor rise.
Their Thread of Life is close and firmly spun;
Whom feeble Age, and pale Diseases shun.
They, while we suffer, surfeit in content;
As if alone exempt from punishment.
Pride hangs like precious Chains about their necks;
And Violence in robes of Purple decks.
Their swollen eyes shine with uncontrolled excess;
Who more, than what their hearts can wish, possess.
Even glory in their foul Impiety;
And speak like Thunder from the troubled Sky.
Dire Blasphemies against high Heaven they cast;
The suffering Earth their Pride and Slander blast.
The Good not seldom through their Scandal stray,
And pressed with Miseries, in Passion say;
O how can we the Lord All-seeing call!
Or think he cares what unto men befall!
When lo! the Wicked with success are crowned,
And in the pleasures of this world abound.
I to no end have purged my heart of stain;
In Innocence have cleans'd my hands in vain;
That thus with daily punishments am worn,
And still chastised with the rising Morn.
If I gave words unto such thoughts as these, Part 2.

I should the assemblies of thy Saints displease:
For then, what were it to be just, or good?
My Soul this secret never understood;
Till I into thy Sanctuary came,
And there beheld their Honor end in Shame.
Thou have on slippery hights their greatness placed;
Down Headlong from their Noon of glory cast.
How are they unto Desolation brought!
Consumed in the moment of a thought!
Such as a pleasant dream when Sleep forsakes
Our flattered sense; so, when thy Wrath awakes,
Thou in thy dreadful fury shall destroy
Their empty and Imaginary joy.
These former thoughts did my weak Soul molest;
So ignorant; so vain; so like a beast.
Yet I by thy Divine supportance stand:
Thou held'st me up by thy Almighty hand.
Thou by thy counsel shall direct my ways;
And after to eternal Glory raise.
For whom have I but Thee in Heaven above?
Or what on Earth can my Affections move?
My Thoughts and Flesh are frail: yet Lord, thou art
My Portion, and the Vigor of my Heart.
Who thee abandon, shall to Death descend;
And they whose knees to cursed Idols bend.
I as my duty, will to God repair;
On Him rely, and his great Acts declare.
PSALM LXXIV.
As the 14.
LOrd; why have Thou abandoned!
O why for ever! shall thine Ire
Consume, like a devouring Fire,
The Sheep which in thy pastures fed!
O think of those, who were thy own;
By Thee of old from bondage brought:
The Inheritance which thou have bought,
And Sion thy affected Throne.
Come, O come quickly, and survey
What spoil the barbarous Foe has made.
Lo! all in heaps of ruins laid;
Thy Temple their accursed prey.
Like Lions, with sharp Famine whet,
They in thy Sanctuary roar;
All purple in thy Peoples gore;
And there their conquering Ensigns set.
It was esteemed a great renown
With Ax to square the Mountain Oaks:
Now they demolish with their strokes,
And hew the carved Fabric down.
Who lo! with all-infolding flame,
The beauty of the Earth devour:
Profanely prostrate on the floor
That Temple sacred to thy Name.
Now (said they) with a sudden hand,
Give we a general End to all.
By Fire the holy structures fall,
Through this depopulated Land.
No Miracles amaze our Foes; Part 2.

There are no Prophets to divine,
That might our miseries decline;
None know the period of our woes.
Ah! how long shall our Enemies
Exult, and glory in our shame!
How long shall they Blaspheme thy Name,
Great God, and thy slow Wrath despise!
Thy hand out of thy Bosom draw;
Nor longer thy Revenge withold:
My God, thou wast our King: The old
Amazed World thy Wonders saw.
Thou struck'st the Erythaean waves,
When Seas from Seas in tumult fled;
Brak'st the Egyptian Dragons head,
And made the joining Floods their Graves.
That great Leviathan of Nile,
To Beasts and Serpents, which possess
The dry and foodless Wilderness,
By Thee delivered for a Spoil.
Thou clav'st the Rock, from whose green wound
The thirst expelling Fountain brake:
Thou made the heady Streams forsake
Their Channels, and become dry ground.
Part 3.
The cheerful Day, Night clothed in shade;
The Moon and radient Sun are Thine:
Thy Bounds the swelling Seas confine;
Summer and Winter by Thee made.
Great God of gods, forget not those
Who Thee reproachfully despise.
Remember, Lord, the Blasphemies,
Cast on thee by our frantic Foes.
O! to the wicked Multitude
Surrender not thy Turtle-dove:
Nor from thy tender care remove
The Poor, by powerful Wrong pursued.
Thy Covenant, bound by Oath, maintain:
For Darkness over-spreads the Face
Of all the Land; in every place
Destruction, Rape, and Slaughter reign.
Let not the oppressed return with shame;
But crown thee with deserved applause:
O patronize thy proper Cause:
Remember, Fools revile thy Name.
O let their Sorrows never cease,
Who blast Thee with their Calumnies.
The tumults of their Pride, who rise
Against Thee, every day increase.
PSALM LXXV.
THy Praises; As the 8^.
O eternal King,
Our Souls in sacred Verse will sing.
The wonders of thy Works declare
Thy Presence in thy Power and Care.
When I shall wear the Hebrew Crown,
High Justice shall my Reign renown.
The Land with weak'ning Discord rent,
The People without Government,
Faint and dissolve. Her Pillars I
Support, her Breaches fortify.
Proud Man, I said, renounce thy Pride;
Thou Fool, thy Folly cast aside.
Do not so high your Horns erect;
Nor bellow, as with yoke uncheckt.
Preferment from the Orient,
Nor from the Evening-Suns Descent,
Nor Desert comes: God guides our Fates;
He raises, and He ruinates.
A cup of red and mingled Wine
He pours out to me and mine:
But every Rebel in the Land
Shall drink the Dregs, squeezed by his Hand*
His noble Acts I will relate;
The God of Jacob celebrate;
Suppress the Wicked, and their ways;
The Just to Wealth and Honor raise.
PSALM LXXVI.
As the 29.
GOd in Judah is renowned;
Salem with his Temple crowned:
He in sacred Sion dwells;
Israel his wonders tells.
He their flying Ensigns tears;
Shivers the Assyrian Spears.
He their Swords, Shields, Arrows, broke;
Killed, subdued, without a stroke.
Thou more excellent than they,
That on Iuries Mountains prey:
Who the Great in battle foiled;
Of their lives and honors spoiled.
Not the Mighty could withstand,
Nor so much as find a hand.
Princes, by thy only Breath,
With the Vulgar, sleep in Death.
Terrible unto thy Foes:
O, who can thy Wrath oppose!
When as they thy Thunder hear,
Mortals stand amazed, and fear:
When from thy eternal Rest
Thou descend'st, to save the Oppressed.
Malice but it self betrays;
And converts into thy praise.
Future rage thou shall restrain,
Making their endeavors vain.
Jacobs Seed, with one accord,
Pay your Vows unto the Lord.
Holy Levites, Offerings bring;
Of his glorious Conquest sing.
He, who Princes overthrows,
O, how fearful to his Foes!
PSALM LXXVII.
TO God I cried; As the 5.
He heard my cries:
Again, when plunged in miseries,
Renewed with raised hands and eyes.
My festred wounds ran all the Night;
No comfort could my Soul invite
To relish long out-worn delight.
I called upon the Ever-blest:
And yet my troubles still increast;
Almost to Death by sorrow pressed.
Thou keep'st my galled eyes awake:
Words fail my grief; sighs only spoke,
Which from my panting bosom brake.
Then did my Memory unfold
The wonders, which thou wrought'st of old,
By our admiring Fathers told.
The Songs, which in the Night I sung;
When deeply by affliction stung:
These thoughts thus moved my desperate tongue;
Will thou for ever, Lord, forsake!
Nor pity on the afflicted take!
O shall thy mercy never wake!
Will thou thy promise falsify!
Must I in thy displeasure die!
Shall Grace before thy Fury fly!
This said; I thus my Passions checked:
His changes on their ends reflect,
To punish and restore the Elect.
Part 2.
His great Deliverance shall dwell
In my Remembrance; I will tell
What in our Fathers days befell.
His counsels from our reach are set;
Hid in his sacred Cabinet.
What God like ours! so Good! so Great!
Who wonders can effect alone;
His Peoples great Redemption;
To Jacob's Seed, and Ioseph's known.
The yielding Floods confess thy Might;
The Deeps were troubled at thy Sight;
And Seas recoiled in their affright.
The Clouds in storms of rain descend;
The Air thy hideous Fragors rend;
Thy arrows dreadful flames extend.
Thy Thunders rorings rake the Skies;
Thy fatal Lightning swiftly flies;
Earth trembles in her agonies.
Thy Ways even through the Billows lie:
The Floods then left their Channels dry;
No Mortal can thy steps descry.
Like Flocks through Wilderness of Sand,
Thou led'st us to this pleasant Land;
By Moses and by Aarons hand.
PSALM LXXVIII.
MY People, As the 42.
hear my Words; I will unfold
Dark Oracles, and Wonders done of old;
By our great Ancestors both heard and known,
Successively unto their Children shown;
Which we will to Posterity relate;
That People, yet unknown, may celebrate
Gods Power, his Praise, and glorious Acts: since He
Will's this Tradition by Divine Decree;
Until one Day shall give the World an end:
That all their hopes might on his Help depend.
Nor ever let his noble Actions sleep
In dark oblivion, but his Statutes keep.
Unlike their rebel Sires, a stubborn Race;
Who fell from God, nor sought his slighted Grace.
The Ephraimites, though expert in their Bows,
Though armed, ignobly fled before their Foes:
Who vainly brake the Covenant of their God;
Nor in the ways of his prescription trod,
Forgot his famous Acts, his Wonders shown
In Zoan; and the Plains by Nile o'reflown.
He brought them through the bowels of the Flood;
The parted Waves like solid Mountains stood.
By day with leading Clouds affords a shade;
By night a flaming Pyramid displaid.
Hard Rocks, He in the thirsty Deserts, clave,
And drink out of their stony Entrails gave:
Even from their barren sides the waters gusht,
And down in rivers through the valleys rusht.
Yet still they sinned, Part 2.
and meat to satisfy
Their Lust demand, provoking the most High.
Blaspheming thus; Can God our wants redress?
A Table furnish in the Wilderness?
Though from the cloven Rocks fresh Currents drill,
Can he give Bread? with Flesh the hungry fill?
Thus tempted by their hourly murmurings,
He to his long retarded Wrath gives wings:
Their infidelity enraged the Just,
That would not to his sure Protection trust.
Who all the Curtains of the Skies withdrew,
And made the clouds resolve into a dew.
With Manna, Food of Angels, Mortals fed;
And filled with plenty of caelestial Bread.
Then caused the early Eastern winds to rise,
And bad the dropping South obscure the Skies:
Whence showers of Quails descend; as thick as sand
On Sea-wash'd shores, or dust on Sun-dry'd Land*
Which fell among their Tents: They their delights
Enjoy, and feast their deadly appetites.
For lo! while they those fatal Dainties chew,
And their inordinate Desires pursue;
The Wrath of God surpised them, and cut down
The choice of all; even those of most renown.
Nor, by their own mis-haps admonished,
Would they his Works believe, or Judgments dread.
So he their spirits quenched with daily fears;
In Vanity and Toil consumed their years.
Part 3.
But when by Slaughter wasted, the forlorn
Returned, and sought Him in the early Morn:
They then confessed, and said; Thou art our Tower,
Our Strength; alone protectest by thy Power.
Yet their sly Tongues did but their Souls disguise;
Full of deluding flatteries and lies.
Their faithless hearts revolted from his Will;
Nor ever would his just Commands fulfill.
How often would He, whose Mercy has no bound,
Their pardon sign! nor in their Sins confound!
How often did He his burning wrath assuage!
How often divert the fury of his Rage!
Considered them as flesh, in frailty born;
A passing Wind, that never can return.
Yet still would they his sacred Laws transgress;
Provoked him in th'unpeopled Wilderness:
Confined the Holy One of Israel;
Against their Savior frantickly rebel:
Forgetful of his Power, nor ever thought
Of that great day, when from long bondage brought.
His dreadful Miracles to Egypt known,
And Wonders in the Field of Zoan shown.
The River changed into a Sea of Blood;
Men faint for thirst, to avoid the infected Flood.
Huge swarms of unknown Flies display their wings,
Which wound to death with their envenomed stings.
Loathed Frogs even in their Palaces abound;
And with their filthy slime pollute the ground.
Their early Fruits the Caterpillars spoil: Part 4.

And Grasshoppers devour the Plow-mans toil.
Long Vines with storms their dangling burdens lost:
The broad-leav'd Sycamores destroyed with frost.
Their Flocks beat down with Hailstones, breathless lie:
Their Cattle by the stroke of Thunder die.
The Vengeance of his Wrath all forms of woes,
More Plagues, then could be feared, upon them throws
Whom evil Angels to their sins betray.
He to the Torrent of his Wrath gave way;
Nor would with man or sinless beasts dispense;
^hot by the Arrows of his Pestilence.
^ew all the flower of Youth; their Firstborn Sons;
There where old Nilus in seven channels runs.
But like a flock of Sheep his People led;
Safe and secure through Deserts, full of dread:
Even through unfathomed Deeps: which part and close
Their tumbling waves to swallow their proud Foes.
Then brought them to his consecrated Land;
Even to his Mountain purchased by his Hand.
Cast out the Giant-like Inhabitants;
And in their rooms the Tribes of Israel plants.
Yet they (O most ungrateful!) falsify
Their vows, and still exasperate the most High:
Who in their faithless Fathers traces go;
And start aside; like a deceitful Bow.
Their Altars on the tops of Mountains blaze,
While they their hands to cursed Idols raise.
Part 5.
These objects fuel to his wrath afford:
Whose Soul revolted Israel abhorred.
The ancient Seat of Shiloh then forsook;
Nor longer would that hated Mansion brook.
His Ark even to Captivity declined;
His Strength and Glory to the Foe resigned:
And yielded up his People to the Rage
Of barbarous swords; nor would his wrath assuage.
Devouring flames their able Youth confound;
Nor are their Maids with Nuptial Garlands crowned.
Their Mitred Priests in heat of Battle fall;
No Widows weeping at their Funeral.
Then as a Giant, folded in the Charms
Of Wine and Sleep, starts up and cries, To arms:
So roused, his Foes behind, Jehovah wounds;
And with Eternal Infamy confounds:
Yet would in Joseph's Tents no longer dwell;
Nor Ephraim chose, who from his Covenant fell:
But Judah's Mountain for his Seat elects;
And sacred Sion, which he most affects.
There our great God his glorious Temple placed,
Firm as the Center, never to be rased.
And from the bleating Flocks his David cho^e,
When he attended on the yeaning Ews;
And raised him to a Throne, that he might feed
His people; Israel's selected Seed.
Who fed them faithfully; and all the Land
Directed with a just and equal hand.
PSALM LXXIX.
THe Gentiles waste thy Canaan, As the 39.
Lord,
With Fire and Sword.
Thy holy Temple they profane;
With Slaughter stain.
Beneath her ruins Salem groans;
Now nothing but a heap of Stones.
The dead no Funeral pomp attends,
Nor weeping friends:
Their carkases our barbarous Foes
To Beasts expose:
The ravenous Wolves become their tomb
Or else the greedy Vultures womb.
With blood of Saints, the Streams grow red,
Like Watershed:
Thy People now a general
Reproach to all.
The Syrian, and base Edomite
Deride, and in our woes delight.
How long, Lord, shall thy jealous ire
Devour like Fire!
Thy Anger, in a dreadful shower
Of vengeance, power
On those, who know not thy great Name:
And think thy Worship but a shame.
Part 2.
For they have laid our Country waste:
Our Cities ras't.
Lord, O remember not the crimes
Of former times!
But for thy tender mercy save
Our souls; now humbled to the grave.
Lord, for the glory of thy Name,
Redeem from shame.
O purge us, and propitious be!
From thraldom free.
Why should the Heathen thus blaspheme,
And say, Your God is but a Dream!
Against them let thy Vengeance rise;
Before our eyes:
And for our blood, shed by their guilt,
Let theirs be spilt.
O hear the sighing Prisoners cry!
And save, whom they have doomed to die.
Our spiteful Neighbors, Lord, deride
Thee, in their pride.
With sevenfold vengeance recompense
Their insolence.
So we, thy flock, our God will praise;
And to the Stars thy Glory raise.
PSALM LXXX.
THou Shepherd of thy Israel, As the 3.

That, Flock-like, leadest Joseph's Race:
Who 'twixt the Cherubims do dwell,
O hear! show thy inlightning Face.
Exalt thy saving power before
Manasseh, Ephraim, Benjamin:
O from Captivity restore!
And let thy beams upon us shine.
Great God of Battle, will thou still
Be angry, and our prayers despise?
Bread, steeped in tears, our stomachs fill;
We drink the rivers of our eyes.
Our scoffing Neighbors fall at strife
Among themselves, to share our right:
Great God, restore the dead to life;
And comfort by the quickening light.
This Vine, Part 2.
from Egypt brought, (the Foe
Expelled) was planted by thy hand:
Thou gav'st it room and strength to grow,
Until her branches filled the Land.
The Mountains took a shade from these,
Which like a grove of Cedars stood:
Extending to the Tyrian Seas,
And to Euphrates rolling Flood.
O why have thou her Fences ras't?
Whilst every Stragler pulls her Fruit:
The browsing Heard her branches waste;
And salvage Boars plow-up her root.
Great God, return; this trampled Vine
From Heaven behold with mild aspect:
Once planted by that Hand of thine;
The branches of thy own Elect.
Which now cut down, wild Flames devour;
Through thy fierce wrath to ruin brought:
Protect thy People by thy Power;
And perfect what thy self has wrought.
Revived, we will thy Name adore;
Nor ever from thy Pleasure swerve.
O from Captivity restore,
And by thy powerful grace preserve!
PSALM LXXXI.
As the 8.
TO God our Strength your voices raise:
In sacred numbers sing his praise.
The warbling Lute, sweet Viol bring,
And solemn Harp: loud Timbrels ring.
The new Moon seen, shrill Trumpets sound;
Your sacred Feasts with Triumph crowned.
These Rites our God established,
When Israel He from Egypt led:
Their necks with Yokes of bondage wrung;
Inured to an unknown tongue.
Your burdens I have cast away,
Said he, and cleans'd your hands from clay:
Then saved, when in your fears you cried;
And from the thundering Cloud replied.
I tried you; heard your murmurings,
At Meribah's admired Springs.
You Sons of Israel, give ear;
I will instruct you, would you hear.
Beware; no foreign gods adore;
Nor their adulterate Powers implore.
Part 2.
I Thee alone brought from the Land
Of Bondage, with a mighty Hand.
I know, and will supply thy need;
When naked, cloth; when hungry, feed.
Yet would not they my Counsel brook;
But desperately their God forsook:
Whom I unto their lusts resigned,
And errors of their wandering Mind.
O that they had my voice obeyed,
Nor from the paths of Virtue straid!
Then Victory their brows had crowned:
Their slaughtered Foes had spread the ground:
Then had I made their enemy
Submit, and at their mercy lie:
Themselves blessed with eternal Peace;
Enriched with the Earths increase:
With flour of Wheat, and Honey filled,
From breaches of the Rock distilled.
PSALM LXXXII.
GOd sits upon the Throne of Kings, As the 4.

And Judges unto judgment brings:
Why then so long
Maintain you wrong,
And favor Lawless things?
Defend the Poor, the Fatherless;
Their crying injuries redress:
And vindicate
The Desolate,
Whom wicked men oppress.
For they of Knowledge have no Light,
Nor Will to know; but walk in Night.
Earths Bases fail;
No Laws prevail;
Scarce one in heart upright.
Though Gods, and Sons of the most High;
Yet you, like common men, shall die;
Like Princes fall.
Great God, judge all
The Earth, thy Monarchy.
PSALM LXXXIII.
LOrd, sit not still, as deaf unto our cries:
As the 1.
For lo! our Enemies in tumults rise.
Even those, who thy Omnipotence deny,
And hate thy Name, advance their Crests on high:
Dark counsels take, and secretly contrive
Their slaughter, whom thy Mercy keeps alive.
Come, say they, let us with incessant strokes,
Hew down this Nation, like a grove of Oaks,
Till they no longer be; and Israel die
Both in his Race, and ruined Memory.
They all, in one confederacy, have made
A solemn League; supplied with foreign aid.
Fierce Idumaeans, who in Nomades stray,
And shaggy Ismaelites, that live by prey;
The incestuous Race, that border on the Lake
Of salt Asphalthis: Savage Thieves, who take
Their name from servile Hagar; they, who dwell
In Gebal; Ammonites, who Peace expel;
Stern Palaestines; and wild Amalekites;
False Tyrians; Ashur with Lots Sons unites.
Let them like Midian fall, Part 2.
by mutual wounds;
Like Siscra; fall like Iabin, on the bounds
Of Endor, where swift Kison takes his birth;
Who lay like Dung upon the fa^ned Earth:
Like Zeb, and Orebs Princes; made a prey
For Wolves: like Zeba and proud Za^muna:
Who said, let us these Israelites destroy,
And all the Cities of their God enjoy.
O let them, like a wheel be hurried round;
Like chaff, which whirlwinds ravish from the ground;
As Woods grown dry with age, embraced with fire,
Whose flames above the singed Hills aspire:
So in the Tempest of thy Wrath pursue;
And with thy Storms thy trembling Foes subdue.
O fill their hearts with grief; their looks with shame;
Till they invoke thy late blasphemed Name.
Confound them with eternal Infamy;
That they, through anguish of their Souls, may die.
That men Jehovah's Wonders may rehearse;
The great Commander of this Universe.
PSALM LXXXIV.
O How amiable are As the 29.

Thy Aboads, great God of War!
How I languish through restraint!
How my longing Spirits faint!
Lord, for thee I daily cry;
I^ thy absence hourly die.
Sparrows there their young ones rear;
And the Summers Harbinger
By thy Altar builds her nest,
Where they take their envied rest.
O my King! O thou most High!
Arbiter of Victory!
Happy men! who spend their Days
In thy Courts; there sing thy Praise!
Happy! who on Thee depend!
Thine their Way, and thou their End.
Who through Baca traveling,
Make that thirsty Vale a Spring;
Or soft Showers from Clouds destill,
And their empty Cisterns fill:
Fresh in strength, their course pursue,
Till they thee in Sion view.
Lord of Hosts, incline thine Ear.
O thou God of Jacob hear!
Thou our Rock, extend thy Grace;
Look on thy Anointed's Face.
One Day in thy Courts alone.
Far exceeds a Million.
Let me be contemned and poor;
In thy Temple keep a Door:
Then with wicked men possess
All that they call Happiness.
O thou Shield of our Defense!
O thou Sun, whose influence
Sweetly glides into our Hearts!
Thou, who all to thine imparts!
Happy! O thrice happy he,
Who alone depends on Thee!
PSALM LXXXV.
AT length thou have thy Mercy shown; As the 2.

Drawn from the Babylonian yoke;
Our Sins removed, which did provoke
Thy Wrath; even that now overblown.
Great God, our ruined State restore;
And let thy Anger flame no more.
O shall it like a Comet reign!
Extending to the yet unborn!
Will thou not quicken the forlorn;
That thine in Thee may joy again!
O shower thy Mercy from above;
Preserve, and fix us in thy love!
I will the Voice of God attend,
Who to his People speaks of Peace.
Such as in Sanctity increase;
Nor to their Sins again descend:
These soon with Freedom shall be blessed,
That Glory may our Land invest.
Those Days shall consummate our Bliss:
Sweet Clemency with Truth shall meet;
High Justice gentle Peace shall greet,
Saluting with a holy Kiss:
For Truth shall from the Earth arise,
And Righteousness look from the Skies.
Then shall Jehovah distribute
His Blessings with a liberal Hand:
The rich, and ever grateful Land
Abundantly produce her fruit.
For Justice shall before him go,
And her fair steps to Mortals show.
PSALM LXXXVI.
MY God, thy Suppliant hear;
As the 13.
Afford a gentle Ear:
For I am comfortless,
And labor in distress.
My righteous Soul relieve,
So ready to forgive.
Thy Servant, Lord, defend;
Whose hopes on Thee depend.
Me from the Grave restore,
Who daily Thee implore:
From wasting Sorrow free
The Heart long vowed to Thee.
For thou art God alone,
To tender pity prone,
Propitious unto all,
Who on thy Mercy call.
O hear my fervent prayer,
And take me to thy care:
Then ready to be found,
When troubles most abound.
What God, like Thee, O Lord,
Of all by men adored!
Or underneath the Sun,
Such miracles has done.
Part 2.
Zeal shall all hearts inflame
TO adore and praise thy Name.
For thou art God alone;
Thy Power in Wonders shown.
Direct me in thy Way;
So shall I never stray.
My thoughts from Tempests clear;
United in thy Fear.
My Soul shall celebrate
Thy Praise; thy Power relate,
That have advanced my head,
And raised me from the Dead.
The Proud against me rise,
And powerful Enemies
(All Rebels to thy Will)
My guiltless blood would spill.
But, O thou King of kings,
From Thee sweet Mercy springs;
Still gracious, slow to wrath;
True to thy Servants Faith.
Lord, for thy Mercies sake,
Into thy Bosom take:
Thy Handmaids Son O save
From the devouring Grave!
Some happy Sign expose
To my ashamed Foes;
That they thy Hate may see
To them; thy Love to me.
PSALM LXXXVII.
THe Lord has with his Temple crowned As the 8.

Moriah, by his Choice renowned.
Not all the Tents of Israel,
Or Mountains which in height excel,
He so affects, or celebrates,
As lofty Sions stately Gates.
Jerusalem, thou Throne of Kings,
Of Thee they utter glorious things.
Not by Iudea's narrow bounds
Prescribed; the Land which Nile surrounds,
Great Babylon, proud Palaestine,
Rich Tire, which circling Seas confine;
And black-brow'd Aethiopians,
Shall yield thee Citizens and Sons.
All sorts of People, foreign-bred,
As Natives there indenized;
In Sion, built by immortal Hands:
Firm as the Mountain where it stands.
The Lord in his eternal Scroll,
Shall these, as Citizens, inroll.
Their Music shall the Affections raise,
And Songs sung in Jehovah's praise;
Whose Blessings on this City shall,
Like Streams from Heavenly Fountains, fall.
PSALM LXXXVIII.
As the 39.
MY Savior! both by night and day
To Thee I pray.
O let my Cries transcend the Spears,
And pierce thy Ears!
Lest Sorrow stop my fainting breath;
Now near the Jaws of greedy Death.
My light extinguished, numbered
Among the Dead:
Like men in battle slain; the womb
Of Earth their Tomb:
Forgotten, as if never known;
By thy tempestuous Wrath over thrown.
By Thee lodged in the lower Deeps,
Where Horror keeps;
In Dungeons, where no Sun displaies
His cheerful Rays.
Crushed by thy Wrath; on me thy Waves
Rush, like so many rolling Graves.
My old Familiars, now my Foes,
Deride my Woes.
My House becomes my Goal; where I
In Fetters lie.
Blind with my tears; with crying hoarse;
Hands raised in vain; a walking Coarse.
Will thou to those thy Wonders show, Part 2.

Who sleep below?
The Dead from their cold Mansions raise,
To sing thy Praise?
Shall Mercy find us in the Grave?
Or will thou in Destruction save?
Will thou thy Wonders bring to light,
In Deaths long Night?
Or shall thy Justice there be shown,
Where none are known?
I have, and still to Thee will pray;
Before the Sun restore the Day.
O, why have thou withdrawn thy Grace,
And hid thy Face;
From me, who from my Infancy
But daily die?
Whilst I thy Terrors undergo;
Distracted by these storms of woe,
Thy Anger, like a Gulf, devours
My trembling Powers:
With troops of Terrors circled round;
In Sorrow drowned;
Deprived of those, that loved me most;
To all in dark oblivion lost.
PSALM LXXXIX.
As the 72.
OUr grateful Songs, O thou eternal King,
Shall ever of thy boundless Mercies sing:
And thy unalterable Truth rehearse
To after Ages, in a living verse.
For what is by thy Clemency decreed,
Shall orderly, and faithfully succeed:
Even like those never resting Orbs above,
Which on firm hinges circularly move.
Thus God unto his servant David swore;
This Covenant made: I will for evermore
Thy seed establish, and thy Throne sustain;
Whilst Seas shall flow, or Moons increase, and wain.
The heavenly Hierarchy thy Truth shall praise;
The Saints below thy glorious Wonders blaze.
For who is like our God above the Clouds!
Or who so great, whom humane frailty shrowds!
He to his Angels terrible appears;
And daunts the Tyrants of the Earth with fears.
Great God! how great, when dreadful Armies join!
What God so strong! what Faith so firm as thine!
Part 2.
Thy Bounds the Billows of the Sea restrain;
Thou calm'st the tumults of the incensed Main.
Proud Rahab, like a Coarse, with blood imbrued;
Hew'n down: the strong with greater strength subdued.
Thine are the Heavens; those Lamps which guild the Skies;
Round earth, broad ^eas, and all which they comprise.
Thou made the Southern and the Northern Pole,
Whereon the Orbs celestial swiftly roll.
Hermon invested with the Morning Rays,
And Tabor with the Evenings, sing thy praise.
Thy Arm excells in Strength: thy hands sustain
The World they made: And guide it with a rein.
Justice with Judgment joined, thy Throne uphold:
Mercy and Truth thy sacred brows infold.
Thrice happy they, who, when the Trumpet calls,
Throng to thy celebrated Festivalls!
They of thy Beauty shall enjoy the sight,
And guide their Feet by that informing light:
Thy Name shall daily in their mouths be found;
And in thy Justice shall their Joys abound.
Our Ornament in Peace, Part 3.
our Strength in Wars;
Thy Favor shall exalt us to the Stars.
Thou, Holy One of Israel, our King;
Thou, our defense; secure beneath thy Wing.
Thus spoke Jehovah by his Prophets voice;
Of strenuous David have I made my choice,
(On that Hero powered my Sacred Oil)
To guide my People, and preserve from spoil.
^ will support him with my powerful Arm;
No ^oe shall tribute force: nor Treason harm:
His enemies before his Face shall fly,
And those, who hate his Soul, by slaughter die.
Our Truth and Clemency shall crown his Days,
And to the Firmament his Glory raise.
He, from the Billows of the Tyrian Main,
To swift Euphrates shall extend his Reign.
Who in his often renewed Devotions shall,
^e Father, God, and great Protector call.
My Favorite he shall be, and my First birth;
Raised above all the Princes of the Earth.
My Mercy him for ever shall preserve:
And from my Promise I will never swerve.
His Seed shall always reign; his Throne shall last,
While days have light, and nights their shadows cast.
Part 4.
If they my Judgments slight, forsake my Law,
My Rites neglect, and from my Rule withdraw;
Then I with whips will their offenses scourge,
With labor, misery, and sorrows urge:
Yet will not utterly my King forsake;
My Vow infringe, or alter what I spoke.
I by my Sanctity to David swear,
That he, and his should never want an Heir,
To sway the Hebrew Scepter, while the Sun
His usual Race should through the Zodiac run;
While Men, the Moon and radiant Stars should see,
The faithful witnesses of my Decree.
But thou art angry with thy own Elect,
And do thy late affected King reject;
Infringe the Covenant to thy Servant sworn;
Thou from his Brows his Diadem have torn,
Cast down the Rampire, which his strength renowned
And all his Bulwarks levelled with the ground:
Whom now his Neighbors scorn; a common prey,
And spoil to all that travail by the way.
Part 5.
Thou addest strength and courage to his Foes,
Who now rejoice and triumph in his woes;
Rebatest his sharp Sword, unnerv'st his might,
And make him shrink in fervor of the fight:
His splendour have Eclipsed; his renown
In ruins buried, and his Throne cast down:
His Youth consumed with untimely Age;
Marked out for shame; the object of thy Rage.
How long shall he in thy displeasure mourn!
Still shall thy Anger like a Furnace burn!
O call to mind the shortness of my days;
That dream of Man, which like a Flower decays.
Who lives, that can the stroke of Death defend;
Or shall not to the silent Grave descend?
Where is thy ancient Love! thy plighted Troth,
Confirmed to David by a solemn Oath!
Remember the Reproaches I have born;
Those of the Mighty; and their bitter scorn:
Traduced; by thy enemies abhorred.
Yet, O my pensive Soul, praise thou the Lord.
Amen, Amen.
A PARAPHRASE Upon the Fourth BOOK OF THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM XC.
As the 34.
O Thou the Father of us all,
Our refuge from the Original;
That were our God, before
The a^ry Mountains had their birth,
Or Fabric of the peopled Earth;
And art for evermore.
But frail man, daily dying, must*
At thy Command return to Dust:
Or should he Ages last;
Ten thousand years are in thy sight
But like a quadrant of the Night,
Or as a Day that is past.
He by thy Torrent swept from hence;
An empty Dream, which mocks the Sense,
And from the Fancy flies:
Such as the beauty of the Rose,
Which in the dewy Morning blows,
Then hangs the head and dies.
Through daily anguish we expire:
Thy anger a consuming Fire,
To our offenses due.
Our sins (although by Night concealed,
By shame, and fear) are all revealed,
And naked to thy view.
Thus in thy wrath our years we spend;
And like a sad discourse they end,
Nor but to seventy last:
Or if to eighty they arrive,
We then with Age, and Sickness strive;
Cut off with winged have.
Who knows the terror of thy wrath, Part 2.

Or to thy dreadful anger has
Proportioned his due fear?
Teach us to number our frail Days,
That we our hearts to Thee may raise,
And wisely sin forbear.
Lord, O how long! at length relent!
And of our miseries repent;
Thy Early Mercy show:
That we may unknown comfort taste:
For those long days in sorrow past,
As long of joy bestow.
The works of thy accustomed Grace
Show to thy Servants: on their Race
Thy cheerful beams reflect,
O let on us thy Beauty shine!
Bless our attempts with aid divine,
And by thy Hand direct.
PSALM XCI.
As the 9.
WHo makes the Almighty his retreat,
Shall rest beneath his shady Wings;
Free from the oppression of the Great,
The rage of War, or wrath of Kings.
Free from the cunning Fowlers train;
The tainted airs infectious breath:
His Truth in perils shall sustain,
And shield thee from the stroke of Death.
No terrors shall thy sleeps affright;
Nor deadly flying Arrows slay:
Nor Pestilence devour by Night,
Or Slaughter massacre by Day.
A thousand and ten thousand shall
Sink on thy Right hand and thy Left:
Yet thou secure shall see their fall;
By vengeance, of their lives bereft.
^^nce God thou have thy Refuge made,
And do to him thy Vows direct;
No evil shall thy strength invade,
Nor wasting plagues thy roof-infect.
Thee shall his Angels safely guide;
Upheld by winged Legions,
Lest thou at any time should slide.
And dash thy Foot against the Stones.
Thou on the Basilisk shall tread;
The Mountain Lion boldly meet,
And trample on the Dragons Head;
The Leopard prostrate at thy Feet.
Since he has fixed his love on me,
Says God, and walked in my ways;
I will his Soul from danger free,
And from the reach of Envy raise.
To him I his desires will give;
From danger guard; in honor place:
He long, long happily shall live,
And flourish in my saving Grace.
PSALM XCII.
THou, As the 29.
who art enthroned above;
Thou, by whom we live, and move;
O how sweet, how excellent,
Is It with tongue and hearts consent,
Thankful hearts and joyful tongues,
To renown thy Name in Songs!
When the Morning paints the Skies,
When the sparkling Stars arise;
Thy high favors to rehearse,
Thy firm faith, in grateful Verse.
Take the Lute, and Violin;
Let the solemn Harp begin;
Instruments strung with ten strings;
While the Silver Cimbal rings.
From thy Works my joy proceeds:
How I triumph in thy Deeds!
Who thy Wonders can express!
All thy Thoughts are fathomless;
Hid from Men in Knowledge blind;
Hid from Fools to Vice inclined.
Who that Tyrant Sin obey;
Though they spring like Flowers in May;
Parched with Heat, and nipt with Frost,
Soon shall fade, for ever lost.
Part 2.
Lord, thou art most Great, most High;
Such from all Eternity.
Perish shall thy Enemies,
Rebels that against thee rise.
All, who in their Sins delight,
Shall be scattered by thy Might.
But thou shall exalt my Horn,
Like a youthful Unicorn;
Fresh and fragrant Odors shed
On thy crowned Prophets head.
I shall see my Foes defeat,
Shortly hear of their retreat:
But the Just like Palms shall flourish,
Which the Plains of Judah nourish:
Like tall Cedars mounted on
Cloud ascending Lebanon.
Plants set in thy Court, below
Spread their roots, and upwards grow;
Fruit in their Old Age shall bring;
Ever fat and flourishing.
This Gods Justice celebrates;
He, my Rock, Injustice hates.
PSALM XCIII.
NOw great Jehovah reigns, As the 47.

With Majesty aray'd;
His Power all powers restraines,
By men and gods obeyed.
The round Earth hung
In liquid Air;
Established there
But by his Tongue.
Thy Throne more old than Time,
And after, as before.
The Floods in billows clime,
And foming loudly rore.
With horrid Noise
The Ocean raves,
And breaks his Waves
Against the Skies.
But thou more to be feared,
More terrible than these:
Thy Voice in Thunder heard;
Thy Nod rebukes the Seas.
Thee Truth renowns;
Pure Sanctity
Eternally
Thy Temple crowns.
PSALM XCIV.
As the 10.
GReat God of Hosts, revenge our Wrong
On those, who are in Mischief strong.
Upon thy Foes
Inflict our woes:
For Vengeance does to Thee belong.
Judge of the World, prevent
The Proud and Insolent.
How long shall they the Just oppress,
And triumph in their Wickedness!
How long supplant!
Ah! how long vaunt,
And glory in their dire success!
Thy Saints asunder break,
Insulting over the Weak!
Who Strangers, and poor Widows kill;
The blood of wretched Orphans spill:
And say, Can he
Or hear, or see?
Does God regard what is good or ill?
Brute Beasts, without a mind!
O Fools in knowledge blind!
Shall not the Almighty see and hear,
Who formed the Eye, and framed the Ear?
Who Nations slew,
Not punish you?
Who taught, not know? to him appear
Dark Counsels, secret Fires,
Vain Hopes, and vast Desires*
But O! Part 2.
thrice blessed he, whom God
Chastises with his gentle Rod;
Informs, and aws
By sacred Laws.
In storms brought to a safe abode:
While the Unrighteous shall
By winged Vengeance fall.
For he will not forsake the Elect;
Nor who adore his Name reject:
But Judgment then
Shall turn again
To Justice, and her Throne Erect:
Who are in Heart upright
Shall follow that clear Light.
What mortal will the Afflicted aid?
Defend when impious Foes invade?
Lord, had not thou,
My Soul e're now
In silent shades of Death had laid:
For he my Outcries heard;
And from the Center reared.
When Grief my laboring Soul confounds;
Thou powrest Balm into her wounds.
Shall Tyranny
With thee comply?
Who Mischief for a Law propounds?
Who swarm to circumvent,
And doom the Innocent.
But thou, O Lord, art my Defense,
My Refuge, and my Recompense.
The Vicious shall
By Vices fall;
By their own Sins be swept from hence.
God shall cut off their breath,
And give them up to Death.
PSALM XCV.
As the 34.
COme Sing the great Jehovah's Praise,
Whose Mercies have prolonged our Days;
Sing with a joyful voice.
With bending Knees, and raised Eyes
Adore your God: O sacrifice;
In sacred Hymns rejoice.
Great is the God of our Defense,
Transcending all in eminence:
His Hand the Earth sustains;
The Depths, the lofty Mountains made;
The Land and liquid Plains displaid,
And curbs them with his Reins.
O come, before his Footstool fall,
Our only God, who formed us all;
Through Storms of danger led.
He is our Shepherd, we his Sheep;
His Hands from Wolves and Rapine keep,
In pleasant Pastures fed.
The Voice of God thus spoke this Day;
Repine not as at Meribah,
As in the Wilderness:
Where your Forefathers tempted me;
Who did my Works of Wonder see,
And to their shame confess.
When vexed for forty years, I said;
This People in their hearts have strayed;
Rebellious to command:
To whom I in my Anger swore,
That Death should seize on them, before
They knew this pleasant Land.
PSALM XCVI.
NEw composed Ditties sing As the 29.

To our Everlasting King:
You, all you of Humane birth,
Fed and nourished by the Earth,
Celebrate Jehovah's Praise,
Daily his Deliveries blase.
His Glory let the Gentiles know;
To the World his wonders show.
O how gracious! O how great!
Earth his Footstool, Heaven his Seat.
To be feared and honored more
Than those gods, whom Fools adore;
Idols by their Servants made:
But our God the Heavens displayed.
Honor, Beauty, Power Divine,
In his Sanctuary shine.
All, who by his Favor live,
Glory to Jehovah give;
Glory due unto his Name,
And his Mighty Deeds proclaim.
Offerings on his Altar lay;
There your Vows devoutly pay.
Part 2.
In his beauteous Holiness
To the Lord your Prayer address.
All, whom Earths round shoulders bear,
Serve the Lord with Joy and Fear.
Tell Mankind, Jehovah reigns:
He shall bind the world in Chains,
So as it shall never slide;
And with sacred Justice guide.
Let the smiling Heavens rejoice;
Joyful Earth exalt her Voice:
Let the dancing Billows rore;
Echoes answer from the Shore:
Fields their flowery Mantles shake;
All shall in their Joy partake:
While the Woods Musicians sing
To the ever-youthful Spring.
Fill his Courts with sacred Mirth;
He, He comes to judge the Earth.
Justly He the World shall sway,
And his Truth to men display.
PSALM XCVII.
As the 8.
O Earth! joy in Jehovah's Reign;
You numerous Isles, clasped by the Main.
Him rolling Clouds and Shades infold.
Judgment and Truth his Throne uphold.
Who fiery Darts before him throws;
With winged flames consumes his Foes.
His Lightning made a day of night;
Earth trembled at so feared a sight.
The Mountains at his Presence sweat,
Like pliant Wax dissolved with Heat;
At his Descension from the Sky,
Who rules the Worlds great Monarchy.
The Heavens declare his Righteousness;
His Glory wondering men confess.
Let those with shame to Hell descend,
Whose Knees to cursed Idols bend;
Whose rocks for Deities implore:
O all you gods, our God adore.
Rejoicing Sion heard her King:
Her Daughters of his Judgments sing.
Thou art exalted above all
Mankind, and Powers Angelical.
Those Saints thy shady Wings protect,
Who Sin abhor, and thee affect.
For thou have sown the Seeds of Light,
And joy, which shall invest the Upright.
You Just, your joyful Hearts elate;
His blessed Memorial celebrate.
PSALM XCVIII.
SIng to the King of kings, As the 47.

Sing in unusual Lays;
That has wrought wondrous things,
His Conquest crown with Praise:
Whose Arms alone,
And sacred Hands,
Their impious Bands
Have overthrown.
He justice brings to light;
His saving Truth extends,
Even in the Gentiles sight,
To Earths remotest Ends.
His Heavenly Grace
At full displayed,
And promise made
To Jacobs Race.
Let all that dwell on Earth
Their high Affections raise,
With universal Mirth,
And loudly sing his Praise:
To Music join
The warbling Voice,
Let all rejoice
With Joy divine.
The sprightly Trumpet sound;
The shrill-voic'd Cornet bring^
Let all with Joy abound
Before the Lord our King.
Rore out you Seas,
You spangled Skies,
All you comprise,
Rejoice with these.
Floods clap your thronging waves,
You Hills exalt your mirth:
He, who his People saves,
Now comes to judge the Earth:
The round World shall
With Justice try;
His Equity
Dispenst to all.
PSALM XCIX.
LEt our Foes with terror quake; As the 29.

Let the Earths Foundations shake:
Now the Lord his Reign begins,
Throned between the Cherubins.
O how great in Sions Towers!
High above all Mortal Powers.
Great and terrible his Name:
Since so holy, praise the same.
Judgment his great Power affects;
Yet by Equity directs.
These celestial Twins embrace;
These reflect on Jacobs Race.
O how holy! above all
Honor; at his Footstool fall,
Moses; Aaron heretofore
Among those who Mitres wore:
Samuel by Vow desired,
Among those who were inspired.
These to him their Prayers preferred,
These by him as soon were heard.
These his Statutes rarely brake:
Unto these the Almighty spoke
In the Pillar of a Cloud:
To his Service ever vowed.
He did their Petitions hear,
Merciful, and yet severe.
The Holy on his Holy Hill
Glorify, and worship still.
PSALM C.
As the 47.
ALL from the Suns uprise,
Unto his Setting Rays,
Resound in Jubilees
The great Jehovah's Praise.
Him serve alone;
In triumph bring
Your Gifts, and sing
Before his Throne.
Man drew from Man his Birth,
But God his noble Frame
Built of the ruddy Earth,
Filled with caelestial Flame.
His Sons we are;
Sheep by him led,
Preserved, and fed
With tender care.
O, to his Portals press
In your divine resorts:
With Thanks his Power profess,
And praise him in his Courts.
How good! how pure!
His Mercies last:
His Promise past
For ever sure.
PSALM CI.
OF Justice I and Mercy sing, As the 46.

Which, Lord, from thee, their Fountain spring;
The Graces that adorn a King.
Grave Wisdom shall my steps direct,
No Vice my heart nor Roof infect.
When will thou visit thine Elect!
No pleasure shall mine eyes misguide:
Who from the Tract of Virtue slide,
Just Hate shall from my Soul divide.
Who mischief in their Hearts contrive,
Delight in Wrong, in Factions strive,
I from my peaceful Court will drive.
Who has his Friend with Slander struck,
I will cut off; nor ever brook
A proud Heart, and a haughty Look.
Mine Eyes the Faithful shall observe;
Those in my Family shall serve,
Who never from pure Virtue swerve.
But who are exercised in Guile,
Whose Tongues malicious Lies defile,
I from my Presence will exile.
And all the Wicked in the Land
Will cut off with a timely Hand;
Nor shall they in Gods City stand.
PSALM CII.
ACcept my Prayers, nor to the Cry
As the 22.
Of my Afflictions stop thine Ear:
Lord, in the time of Misery
And sad restraint serene appear:
The Sighings of my Spirit hear;
And when I call, with speed reply.
As Smoke, so fleets my Soul away;
My marrow dried, as Hearths with heat:
My heart struck down, like withered Hay;
Through Sorrow I forsake my meat,
While meagre cares my Liver eat:
The clinging Skin my Bones display.
Like Desert-haunting Pelicans;
In Cities not less desolate:
Like Screech-Owls, who with ominous strains
Disturb the Night, and daylight hate:
A Sparrow, which has lost his Mate,
And on a Pinnacle complains.
Reviling Foes my Honor blast,
And frantic men my ruin swear.
For Bread, I roll'd-on ashes taste;
Each drop I drink mixed with a tear.
For, Lord, O who thy Wrath can bear,
Thou raisest, and do headlong cast.
My Days short, as the Evening shade;
As Morning dew consume away:
As G^ass cut down with Sithes, I fade,
Or like a flower crop'd yesterday:
But, Lord, thou suffer'st no decay:
Thy Promises shall never vade.
For thou shall from thy Rest arise,
(Since now the appointed time draws near)
And look on Sions miseries,
Her Walls and battered Buildings rear;
Whose ruins to thy Saints are dear;
For they her Dust as sacred prise.
Thy Name then shall the Gentiles praise; Part 2.

All Kings thy Honor celebrate:
For when the Lord shall Sion raise,
His Glory shall ascend in State:
So prone to hear the Desolate,
And succor them in all assaies.
Unto eternal Memory
Our Histories shall this record;
And all that are created by
His powerful Hand, shall fear the Lord,
Who does such Grace to his afford,
And on the Earth looks from on high;
To hear the pensive Captives groan;
The Sons of Death by him unbound:
His Name again in Sion known,
That Salem may his Praise resound:
When in his Service all the Round
Of Earth shall there be joined in one.
Yet, Lord, amidst these Hopes thou have
Consumed my strength, abridg'd my years:
Before my Noon of Life be past
Let me not die thus drowned in tears.
Time wastes not thee, which all out-wears;
Thy happy Days for ever last.
Thou made the Earth, thou did display
The Heavens in various motion rolled:
These and their Glories shall decay;
But thou shall thy existence hold:
They like a Garment shall grow old,
And in their changes pass away.
But thou art still the same: before
The World, and after shall remain.
You blessed Souls, who God adore,
With Patient Hope your harms sustain:
For you shall prosper in his Reign
And yours, subsist for evermore.
PSALM CIII.
As the 8.
MY Soul, and all my Faculties
Jehovah praise; sing till the Skies
Re-eccho his ascending Fame:
My Soul, O celebrate his Name!
Nor ever let the memory
Of his surpassing Favors die.
He gently pardons our misdeeds,
And cures the Wounds which inward bleeds.
Has from the Chains of Death unbound;
With Clemency and Mercy crowned.
With Food our Hunger he subdues:
And Eagle-like our Youth renues.
His Justice he extends to all;
Oppressors by his Vengeance fall.
His sacred Paths to Moses shown;
His Miracles to Israel known:
From Him the Springs of Mercy flow;
Swift to forgive, to anger slow.
For he will not for ever chide;
Nor constant to his Wrath abide:
But mildly from his Rage relents,
And shortens our due Punishments.
For as the Heavens in amplitude
Exceed the Center they include:
So ample is his Clemency
To all who on his Grace rely.
As far as the bright Orient Part 2.

Is distant from the Suns Descent;
So far he sets from his Aspect
Their Guilt, who him with fear affect.
And as a Father to his Child,
So soft, so quickly reconciled.
He knows the Fabric of us all;
That dust is our Original.
Man flourishes like Grass, a Flower
That blows and withers in an hour:
By scorching heat, by blasting Wind
Deflower'd, and leaves no print behind.
But his firm Mercy shall embrace
His Saints for ever, and their Race:
Those who his equal Laws fulfill,
Remember, and perform his Will.
In Heaven the great Jehovah reigns,
And governs all that Earth contains:
You Angels, who in strength exceed,
Who him obey with winged speed;
You ordered Hosts of radiant Stars;
O you his flaming Ministers;
All, whom his Wisdom did create;
Through his large Empire celebrate
His glorious Name with sweet accord:
Join thou, my Soul, to praise the Lord.
PSALM CIV.
As the 72.
MY ravished Soul, great God, thy praises sings;
Whom Glory circles with her radiant Wings,
And Majesty invests: then Day more bright;
Clothed with the beams of new-created Light.
He, like an all-infolding Canopy,
Framed the vast concave of the spangled Sky:
And in the Air-imbraced Waters set
The Basis of his hanging Cabinet.
Who on the Clouds, as on a Chariot, rides;
And with a reign the flying Tempest guides.
Bright Angels his attendant Spirits made;
By flame-dispersing Seraphims obeyed.
The ever-fixed Earth clothed with the Flood;
In whose calm bosom unseen Mountains stood;
At his rebuke it shrunk with sudden dread,
And from his voices Thunder swiftly fled.
Then Hills their late concealed Heads extend,
And sinking Valleys to their Feet descend.
The trembling Waters through their bottoms wind,
Till they the Sea, their Nurse and Mother, find.
He to the swelling Waves prescribes a bound,
Lest Earth again should by their rage be drowned.
Springs through the pleasant Medows pour their drills,
Which Snake-like glide between the bordring Hills;
Till they to Rivers grow; where beasts of prey
Their thirst assuage, and such as man obey.
In neighboring Groves the Ayr's Musicians sing, Part 2.

And with their Music entertain the Spring.
He from celestial Casement showers distills,
And with renewed increase his Creatures fills.
He makes the food-full Earth her fruit produce;
For Cattle Grass, and Herbs for humane use.
The spreading Vine long purple clusters bears,
Whose juice the hearts of pensive Mortals chears:
Fat Olives smooth our brows with suppling Oil;
And strengthening Corn rewards the Reapers toil.
His Fruit affording trees with sap abound.
The Lord has Lebanon with Cedars crowned:
They to the warbling Birds a shelter yield,
And wandering Storks in lofty Fir-trees build.
Wild Goats to craggy Cliffs for refuge fly;
And Conies in the Rocks dark entrails lie.
He guides the changing Moons alternate face:
The Suns diurnal and his annual Race.
'Twas he that made the all-informing Light;
And with dark shadows clothes the aged Night.
Then Beasts of prey break from their Mountain Caves;
The roaring Lion pinched with hunger craves
Food from his hand. But when Heavens greatest Fire
Obscures the Stars, they to their Dens retire.
Men with the Morning rise, to labor pressed;
Toil all the Day, at Night return to rest.
Part 3.
Great God! how manifold, how infinite
Are all thy Works! with what a clear foresight
Did thou create and multiply their birth!
Thy riches fill the far extended Earth.
The ample Sea; in whose unfathomed Deep
Innumerable sorts of Creatures creep:
Bright scaled Fishes in her Entrails glide,
And high-built Ships upon her bosom ride:
About whose sides the crooked Dolphin plays,
And monstrous Whales huge spouts of water raise.
All on the Land, or in the Ocean bred,
On Thee depend; in their due season fed.
They gather what thy bounteous Hands bestow,
And in the Summer of thy Favor grow.
When thou contract'st thy clouded Brows, they mourn;
And dying, to their former dust return.
Again created by thy quickening breath,
To re-supply the Massacres of Death.
No Tract of Time his Glory shall destroy:
He in the Obedience of his Works shall joy:
But when their wild revolts his Wrath provoke,
Earth trembles, and the airy Mountains smoke.
I all my life will my Creator praise;
And to his Service dedicate my Days.
May he accept the Music of my Voice,
While I with sacred Harmony rejoice.
Hence you profane, who in your Sins delight;
God shall extirp, and cast you from his Sight.
My Soul, bless thou this all-commanding King:
You Saints and Angels, Hallelujah sing.
PSALM CV.
TO God, As the 72.
O pay your vows; invoke his Name,
And to the World his noble Acts proclaim!
O sing his praises in immortal Verse,
And his stupendous Miracles rehearse!
You Saints, rejoice, and glory in his Grace;
His power adore; for ever seek his Face.
Old Abraham's Seed, you Sons of the Elect;
You Israelites; O you, who God affect,
Report the Wonders by his finger wrought,
When in your cause the inferior creatures fought.
Jehovah rules the many-peopled Earth;
His judgment known to all of humane birth.
He never will forget his Promise past;
His Covenants inviolable last,
Which he to faithful Abraham made before,
And after to the holy Isaac swore:
To Jacob signed, confirmed to Israel;
That their large Offspring should in Canaan dwell.
When they, but few in number, wandered
In unknown Regions, and their Cattle fed:
He did their lives from violence protect,
And for their sakes even mighty Princes checked.
Touch not, said he, my Anointed; fear to wrong
Those sacred Prophets, who to Me belong.
When raging Famine in these Climates reigned, Part 2.

He broke the Staff of Bread, which life sustained:
But Joseph sent before them; sold to save
His Brethren, by whose envy made a slave.
There for the Accusers guilt in prison thrown;
With galling fetters bound, for crimes unknown;
Tried with affliction, at the time decreed,
At once by Pharaoh both advanced and freed.
He of his Household gave him the command,
And made him Ruler over all his Land:
His Princes to his government Subjects.
The prudent Youth grave Senators directs.
Then aged Jacob into Egypt came,
And sojourned in the fruitful Fields of Ham.
God in that Land his people multiplied;
Their Foes, which now their greater strength envied,
Hate what they fear; he alienates their hearts,
To seek their ruin by deceitful Arts.
Part 3.
Then Moses on a sacred Embassy
And Aaron sent; the Elect of the most High.
There wrought his dreadful Wonders; from the Isle
Of Sea-girt Pharo's, to the Falls of Nile.
He bade Cimmerian darkness dim the Day:
The assembled Vapors his commands obey.
He their seven chanell'd Waters turned to Blood;
The Fishes strangled in their native Flood.
Frogs from the slimy Earth in Millions spring;
And skip about the Chambers of the King.
All parts with swarms of noisome Flies abound:
And Lice, like quickened dust, crawl on the ground.
He storms of killing Hail, for Showers, bestows;
And from the breaking clouds his lightning throws:
Blasts all the Vines, and Fig Trees in the Land;
The Woods, with Tempests torn, or naked stand.
Innumerable Locusts these succeed;
And Caterpillars on their leavings feed:
They bite the tender Herb, the bud, and flower;
And all the verdure of the Earth Devour.
Their Strength (the Firstborn) slew: which filled their ears
With Female screeches, and their hearts with fears.
Then He the Hebrews out of Goshen brought, Part 4.

In able health, with Gold and Silver fraught.
The Inhabitants, whose tears augment the Nile,
At their departure Joy, and Fear exile.
A Cloud to shade them from the Sun was spread;
And Nightly by a flaming Pillar led.
At their request he sends them showers of Quails;
And Bread from Heaven, like Coriander, hails*
Cleaves the hard Rocks, from whence a Fountain flows,
And unknown Rivers to those Deserts shows:
For he his sacred Promise called to mind,
To Abraham his Friend and Servant signed.
Thus he his People brought from servitude,
Whose long-felt miseries in joy conclude.
From hence the Heathen by our Weapons chased;
And us his sons in their possessions placed:
That from his Statutes we might never swerve.
O praise the Lord, and him devoutly serve!
PSALM CVI.
WIth grateful hearts Jehovahs praise resound; As the 72.

In goodness great; whose Mercy has no bound.
What Language can express his mighty deeds,
Or utter his due praise, which words exceeds!
Thrice blessed they, who his commands observe,
Nor ever from the tract of Justice swerve.
Great God, O with benevolent aspect
(Even with the love thou bear to thine Elect)
Behold and succor; That my ravished Eyes
May see a period of their miseries,
Who Thee adore: that I may give a voice
To thy great Acts, and in their joy rejoice.
We as our Fathers, have thy Grace exiled;
Revolted, and our Souls with Sin defiled.
They, of thy Miracles in Egypt wrought
So full of Fear and Wonder, never thought;
Thy Mercies, than their hairs in number, more:
But murmured on the Erythraean Shore.
Yet for his Honor saved them from the Foe,
That all the World his wondrous Power might know.
There the commanded Sea asunder rent,
While Israel through his dusty Chanel went*
Whom He from Phaeroah and his Army saves;
The swift-returning Floods their fatal Graves.
Part 2.
Then they his Word believed, and sung his Praise;
Yet soon forgot: and wandered from his Ways.
Who long for flesh to pamper their excess;
And tempt him in the barren Wilderness.
He grants their wish, and with a Flight of Fowls,
Sent meager Death into their hungry Souls.
They, Moses gentle Government oppose;
And envy Aaron, whom the Lord had chose.
The yawning Earth then in her silent womb
Did Dathan and Abirams Troops intomb.
A swiftly-spreading Fire among them burns,
And those Conspirators to Ashes turns.
Yet they, the slaves of Sin, in Horeb made
A Calf of Gold, and to an Idol prayed.
The Lord, their Glory, thus exchanged they
For the Image of a Beast that feeds on Hey:
Forgot their Savior, all his Wonders shown
In Zoan, and the Plains by Nile o're-flown;
The Wonders acted by his powerful Hand;
Where the Red Sea obeyed his stern Command.
God has pronounced their ruin: Moses then,
His Servant Moses, and the best of Men,
Stood in the Breach, which their Rebellion made;
And by his Prayer the hand of Vengeance staid.
Yea they this fruitful Paradise despised, Part 3.

Nor his so-oft-confirmed Promise prized:
But mutined against their faithful Guide,
And basely wished, they had in Egypt died.
For this, the Lord advanced his dreadful Hand,
To overthrow them on the Arabian Sand;
To scatter their rebellious Seed among
Their Foes; exposed to poverty and Wrong.
Besides; Baal-Peor they adored, and fed
On Sacrifices offered to the Dead.
Thus their Impieties the Lord incense,
Who smote them with devouring Pestilence.
But when with noble anger Phineas slew
The bold Offenders, He his Plagues withdrew.
This was reputed for a righteous Deed,
Which should for ever consecrate his Seed.
So they at Meribah his Anger moved;
The sacred Prophet for their sakes reproved:
Their Cries his Saint-like sufferance provoke;
Who rashly in his Souls distemper spoke,
Nor ever entered the affected Land.
They, still rebellious to divine Command,
Preserved those Nations by his Wrath subdued;
Mixed with the Heathen, and their Sins pursued.
Their cursed Idols serve with Rites profane,
(Snares to their Soul) and from no Crime abstain.
Part 4.
Their Sons and Virgin daughters sacrifice
To Devils; and look on with tearless eyes.
Defiled the Land with innocent blood, which sprung
From their own loins, on flaming Altars flung.
Unto adulterate Deities they prayed,
And worshipped those Gods their hands had made.
These crying Sins exasperate the Lord;
Who now his own Inheritance abhorred:
Given up unto the Heathen for a Prey;
Slaves to their Foes; who hate them most, obey.
Delivered often; as often his Wrath provoke,
And with increasing Sins renew their Yoke.
Yet he compassionates their miseries,
And with soft pity hears their mournful Cries:
His former Promise calls to mind, relents;
And in his Mercy, of his Wrath repents.
In salvage Hearts unknown Compassion bred,
By whom but lately into thraldom led.
Great God of gods, thy Votaries protect,
And from among the Barbarous recollect:
That we to Thee may dedicate our Days,
And jointly triumph in thy glorious Praise.
Blessed, O for ever blessed, be Isreal's King:
All you his People, Halelujah sing.
Amen, Amen.
A PARAPHRASE Upon the Fifth BOOK OF THE PSALMS of DAVID.
PSALM CVII.
Extol, As the 8.
and our good God adore,
Whose Sea of Mercy has no Shore.
O you by Tyrants late oppressed,
Now from your servile Yokes releast;
Praise him, who your Redemption wrought,
And home from barbarous Nations brought.
From where the Morn her Wings displays;
From where the Evening crowns the Days;
Beneath the burning Zone, and near
The Influence of the freezing Bear.
They in unpeopled Deserts straid;
The Heavens their Roof, the Clouds their shade:
Their Souls with thirst and hunger faint;
None by, to pity their Complaint:
When to the Lord their God they cried,
His Mercy their extremes supplied.
He led them through the Wilderness,
And gave them Cities to possess.
O you, his Goodness celebrate!
His Acts to all the World relate!
For he in foodless Deserts fed
The Hungry with celestial Bread.
From wondering Rocks new Currents roll,
To satisfy the thirsty Soul.
Part 2.
Those Rebels, who his Counsel slight,
Imprisoned in the shades of Night;
Horrors of Guilt their Souls surprise:
When humbled with their miseries,
They to the Lord addressed their Prayers;
His Mercy comforts their Despairs,
From Darkness draws, dissolves their Grieves;
And from Deaths Jaws preserves their lives.
O you his Goodness celebrate!
His Acts to all the World relate?
He breaks Steel-bars, and Gates of Brass,
To force a way for His to pass.
Those Fools, whom pleasing Sins entice,
Are punished by their darling Vice.
Their Souls all sorts of Food distaste:
Whom Troops of pale Diseases waste.
When they to God direct their Prayers,
His Mercy comforts their Despairs.
His Word restores them from their Graves,
And from a dreadful Ruin saves.
O you his Goodness celebrate!
His Acts to all the World relate!
Due Praises to his Altar bring,
And of your great Redemption sing.
Who sail upon the toiling Main, Part 3.

And traffic in pursuit of Gain,
To such his Power is not unknown,
Nor wonders in the Ocean shown.
At his Command black Tempests rise;
Then mount they to the troubled Skies,
Thence sinking to the Depths below.
The Ship Hulls as the Billows flow;
And all Aboard at every seel,
Like Drunkards on the Hatches reel.
When they to God direct their Prayers,
His Mercy comforts their Despairs.
Forthwith the bitter Storms assuage,
And foming Seas suppress their Rage:
Then, singing, with a prosperous Gale,
To their desired Harbor sail.
O you his Goodness celebrate!
His Acts to all the World relate!
His Fame in your Assemblies raise,
And in the sacred Senate praise.
He Rivers turns to a Wilderness; Part 4.

^prings dried up by the Suns access.
To scourge their Sins, he makes the Soil
Ungrateful to the Owners toil:
Turns sandy Deserts into Pools,
And parched Earth with Fountains cools:
There plants his hungry Colonies,
Where strongly-fenced Cities rise:
The Fields their yellow Mantles wear,
And spreading Vines full clusters bear.
They infinitely multiply:
Their Herds of no diseases die.
^ut when their Sins his Wrath incense,
Then Famine, War, and Pestilence,
Their miserable Lives devour:
Their Princes he deprives of Power,
Who in the Path-less Wilderness
Concealed themselves from Man's access.
The Poor he raises from the ground;
Their Families like flocks abound.
The Just shall this with Joy behold;
The Unjust with fear and shame controlled.
The Wise these Changes will record,
That they may know and serve the Lord.
PSALM CVIII.
As the 2.
MY Thoughts the Lord their Object make;
Before the ruddy Morning spring,
My Glory of his Praise shall sing:
Awake, my Lute; my Harp, awake;
While I to all the World rehearse
His praises in a living Verse.
Thy Mercy (O how great!) extends
Above the Starry Firmament;
Still unto tender pity bent:
Thy Truth the soaring clouds transcends.
Thy Head above the Heavens erect;
Thy Glory on the Earth reflect.
O hear us, who thy aid implore;
And with thy own Right hand defend:
To thy Beloved Succor send.
God by his Sanctity thus swore;
I S^^coths Valley will divide:
In Sichems Spoils be magnified.
Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine:
Ephraim my Strength, in Battle bold.
Thou Judah, shall my Scepter hold.
^ will triumph over Palaestine.
Base Servitude shall Moab waste.
Over Edom I my Shoe will cast.
Who will our forward Troops direct
To Rabbah strongly fortified?
Or into sandy Edom guide?
Lord, wilt not thou, that did reject,
Nor would before our Armies go,
Now lead our Host against the Foe?
When Death and Horror most affright,
Do thou our troubled Souls sustain.
For O, the help of Man is vain!
Lead; and we valiantly shall fight.
Thy Feet our Foes shall trample down;
Thy Hands our Brows with Conquest crown.
PSALM CIX.
MY God, As the 1.
my Glory, leave not in Distress;
Nor let prevailing fraud the truth oppress.
They who delight in subtilties and wrongs,
Afflict me with the poison of their tongues,
With Slander and Detraction gird me round,
And would, without a Cause, my life confound.
Good turns with evil proudly recompense,
And Love with Hate; my Merit, my offense.
But I in these Extremes to thee repair,
And pour out my perplexed Soul in Prayer.
Subject him to a Tyrants stern command;
Subverting Satan place at his Right hand;
Found guilty, when arraigned: in that feared time
Let his rejected Prayers augment his Crime.
May he by violence untimely dye,
And let another his Command supply.
Let his distressed Widow weep in vain;
His wretched Orphans to deaf Ears complain.
Let them the wandering Paths of Exile tread,
And in unpeopled Deserts seek their bread.
Let griping Usurers divide his spoil;
And Strangers reap the harvest of his toil.
Part 2.
In his long misery may he find no Friend;
None to his Race so much as Pity lend.
Let his Posterity be overthrown;
Their Names to the succeeding Age unknown.
Let not the Lord his Fathers Sins forget;
His Mothers Infamy before him set.
O let them be the Object of his Eye,
Till he out-root their hated Memory:
That to the wretched would no Mercy show;
But cruelly pursued his Overthrow.
Laid Trains to kill the Broken and Contrite.
On his own head let his dire Curses light.
He hated Blessing; never be he blessed:
Let cursing like a Robe his Loins invest;
And like a fatal Girdle gird him round;
As he with Execrations did abound.
Let them like Water in his Bowels boil,
And eat into his Bones like burning Oil.
Thus let the Lord reward my Enemies,
Who seek to blast me with malicious lies.
But, Part 3.
Lord, in my deliverance proclaim
Thy Mercy, for the honor of thy Name.
For I am poor, with misery oppressed;
My wounded heart bleeds in my panting breast.
I like the Evening shadow am declined,
And like the Locust, tossed with every wind.
My feeble Knees beneath their burden bend;
My Flesh with fasting falls, my Bones ascend.
Reproach has seized on me; my Foes revile;
And in derision, shake their heads, and smile.
My God, O snatch me from the swallowing grave!
Thy servant with accustomed Mercy save:
That they may know it was thy powerful Hand;
And how I by divine Supportance stand.
Still may they vainly curse whom thou do bless;
And pine with envy at my good success.
Let them be clothed with shame: O be their own
Confusion on them like a Mantle thrown.
But I thy praise will duly celebrate;
And to the multitude thy Deeds relate:
That have the afflicted Soul from sorrow freed,
And from their snares who had his death decreed.
PSALM CX.
THe Lord unto my Lord thus spoke, As the 34.

Sit at my right hand, till I make
A Footstool of thy Foes.
He will thy Rod from Sion send,
Unto whose Power all powers shall bend,
That dare thy Rule oppose.
Thy People willingly shall pay
Their vows in that triumphant Day,
With their united Powers:
Aray'd in Ephods; nor so few
As are those Pearls of Morning-dew,
Which hang on Herbs and Flowers.
He swore, who never Oath did break,
Of the order of Melchisedeck,
That thou a Priest should reign:
Even while the Sun dispersed his Light;
While Moons shall rule the alternate Night,
Or Stars their course maintain.
God, in that Day at thy right hand,
Their Blood, who Tyrant-like command,
Shall in his fury spill.
He, in his Justice shall confound
The Heathen, and the purple ground
With heaps of slaughter fill.
Who over many Nations sway,
And only their own Wills obey,
Shall sink beneath his rage.
Then shall this all-subduing King
With Water of the Crystal spring
His burning thirst assuage.
PSALM CXI.
^ Cantus.

MY Soul the honor of our King,
^ Bassus.

^
Shall in the great Assembly sing. Great are the
^
^
wonders He has shown; With joy by their
^
^
admirers known. His glorious deeds all praise
^
^
transcend; His equal Justice knows no end.
^
Left in eternal Monuments;
Whose Mercy Death and Hell prevents:
Feeds those who fear his Name, and will
His Promise faithfully fulfill.
Who planted with a powerful Hand
His People in this pleasant Land.
Just Judgment executes; directs
By sacred Laws; and Truth affects.
These fretting Time shall never waste;
But squared by Justice ever last.
His Word to us confirmed by deed;
So often from oppression freed.
His Name is terrible to all:
His fear is the Original
Of Wisdom; and they only wise
Who make his Laws their Exercise.
His praise, while men have memory,
And power of speech, shall never dye.
PSALM CXII. Hallelu-jah.
As the 111
THat man is blessed who fears the Lord,
And cheerfully obeys his Word.
His Seed shall flourish on the Earth;
Their Offspring happy from their birth.
His House with riches shall abound:
His truth with endless honor crowned.
To him in darkness light ascends:
Mild, gracious, just in all his ends.
His bounty for the poor provides:
Discretion all his actions guides.
No violence shall cast him down;
No time deface his just renown;
Nor rumors shake his confidence:
The Lord his Hope, and strong Defense:
Confirmed in fearless fortitude,
Till he have all his Foes subdued.
He the necessitated feeds.
The honor of his virtuous Deeds
Shall live in sacred memory;
His Glories shall ascend on high.
The unjust enraged their teeth shall grind,
And languish with the grief of mind:
Pale envy shall their flesh consume,
And all their hopes convert to fume.
PSALM CXIII. Hallelu-jah.
O You, As the 111
who serve the living Lord,
Due praises to his Name afford:
Now and for ever celebrate;
Let all his noble Acts relate.
Even from the purple Morn's uprise,
To where the Evening flecks the Skies.
All power to his Dominion bends:
His Glory the bright Stars transcends.
What God can be compared with ours?
Who Throned in Heavens superior towers
Submits himself to guide and move
All that is done in Heaven above:
And from that height vouchsafes to throw
His eyes on us, who creep below.
The poor he raises from the Dust:
Even from the Dunghill lifts the Just;
Whom he to height of honor brings,
And sets him in the Thrones of Kings.
He fructifies the barren Womb;
The Childless, Mothers now become.
Hallelu-jah.
PSALM CXIV.
As the 111
WHen Israel left the Egyptian Land,
Freed from a tyrannous command;
God his own People sanctified,
And he himself became their Guide.
The amazed Seas, this seeing, fled;
And Jordan shrunk into his Head:
The cloudy Mountains skipt like Rams;
The little Hills like frisking Lambs.
Recoyling Seas, what caused your dread?
Why Jordan, shrunk'st thou to the Head?
Why, Mountains, did you skip like Rains?
And why you little Hills, like Lambs?
Earth, tremble thou before his Face;
Before the God of Jacobs Race;
Who turned hard Rocks into a Lake;
When Springs from flinty intrails brake*
PSALM CXV.
WE nothing can of merit clame: As the 9.

Not for our sakes thy aid afford;
But for the honor of thy Name,
Thy Mercy, and unfailing Word.
Why should the insulting Heathen cry;
Where Is now the God they vainly praise?
Our Lord enthroned above the Sky,
All underneath at pleasure swaies.
Their Gods but Gold and Silver be,
Made by a frail Artificer:
For they have eyes, that cannot see;
Dumb mouths and ears, that cannot hear.
Fools on their Altars incense throw,
Who nothing smell; their Feet are bound,
Nor have they power to move or go:
Their throats give passage to no sound.
Their hands can neither give nor take;
Unapt to punish or defend:
As senseless they who Idols make,
Or to their carved Statues bend.
Your hopes on God, Part 2.
O Israel, place;
He is your Help, and strong Defense:
Be he, you Priests of Aarons Race,
The object of your confidence.
In him, all you that fear him, trust;
He shall protect you in distress.
The Lord is of his Promise just,
And will his faithful Servants bless:
The House of chosen Israel,
And Aarons holy Family:
The poor, and who in power excel;
That love, and on his aid rely.
They shall a mighty People grow;
Their Children happy from their birth:
He will increase of gifts bestow,
Whose hands created Heaven and Earth.
He in the Heaven of Heavens resides,
And over all his Creatures reigns:
Among the sons of men divides
The Earth, and all that Earth contains.
Who sleep within the vaults of Death,
No Offerings to his Altars bring:
O praise his Name, while we have breath;
And loudly Halelu-jah sing.
PSALM CXVI.
As the 4.
MY Soul entirely shall affect
The Lord, whose ears my groans respect
In misery
He heard thy cry;
To him thy Prayers direct.
Sorrows of Death my Soul assailed;
The greedy jaws of Hell prevailed:
Deprest with grief,
When all relief,
And humane pity failed;
I cried; My God, O look on me;
Thou ever Just, the afflicted free.
O from the Grave
Thy Servant save;
For mercy lives in thee.
The Innocent, and long distressed;
The humble mind by wrongs oppressed;
Thy Favor still
Preserves from ill:
My Soul then take thy rest.
God staid my feet, and dried my tears;
Redeemed from Death, and deadly fears:
That still I might
Walk in his sight,
And number many years.
Thus with a firm belief I prayed: Part 2.

Yet in extremes of trouble said;
All on the Earth
Of mortal birth,
Even all of Lies are made.
What shall I unto God restore
For all his Mercies? Fall before
His holy Throne,
And him alone
With sacred Rites adore.
I will perform my Vows this day,
Where they frequent, who God obey.
Right precious is
The Death of His:
He sees, and will repay.
Lord, I am thine, thy Handmaids Seed:
By Thee from raging Tyrants freed.
My Prayers shall rise
In Sacrifice;
My thanks thy Altar feed.
I will perform my Vows this day,
Where they frequent who God obey:
Even in his Court;
Within thy Fort,
Renowned Solyma.
PSALM CXVII.
As the 47.
YOu Nations of the Earth,
Our great Preserver praise.
All you of humane birth,
To Heaven his Glory raise:
Whose Mercy has
No end, nor bound:
His Promise crowned
With constant Faith.
PSALM CXVIII.
As the 111
PRaise our good God, that King of kings,
From whom eternal Mercy springs.
Let Israel, let Aarons Race,
Let all that flourish in his Grace,
Confess, that from the King of kings
Eternity of Mercy springs.
He in my trouble heard my Prayers,
And freed me from their deadly snares:
He fights my Battails; then how can
^ fear the Power of feeble Man?
Assists my Friends; my Enemies

Far better to have Confidence
^n God, than trust to man's Defense:
On him much safer to rely,
Than on the strength of Monarchy.
The Nations all at once assailed;
But by his Aid my Sword prevailed.
Their Armies had beset me round;
^ with their Bodies strewn the ground.
Though they like Bees about me swarm;
His holy Name and powerful Arm
Shall soon consume their numerous powers,
As Fire the crackling Thorn devours.

Whom great Jehovah's Hands sustain.

By him preserved from powerful Wrong.
Our Tents with public Joy shall ring:
The Just of their Deliverance sing.
He with his own Right hand has fought;
His own Right hand has Wonders wrought.
^ shall not dye, but live to praise
The Lord, who has prolonged my Days.
He with his Scourge my Sin corrects;
^et from the Darts of Death protects.
You to his Service sanctified,
The Temple Doors set open wide;
That I may enter in his Name,
And celebrate his glorious Fame.
Those are the Doors, at which all they
Shall enter, who his Will obey.
His Praise with Hymns immortallize!
My Savior, who has heard my Cries.
Part 3.
That Stone the Builders from them cast;
Is highest on the corner placed.
God has revealed these Mysteries,
So full of Wonder, to our Eyes.
This is his Day; a Day of Joy;
Of everlasting Memory.
Great God of gods, thy King protect;
Propitious prove to thy Elect.
O blessed be he, whom God shall send!
We, who within his Courts attend,
You from his Sanctuary bless;
And daily pray for your success.
God, even the Lord, has shed his light
Into our Souls, and cleared our sight.
Bind to the Altars horns, a Lamb,
New-weaned from the bleating Dam.
Thou art my God; my Songs shall praise,
And to the Stars thy Glory raise.
Praise our good God, The King of kings;
From whom eternal Mercy springs.

Who feed on Hope, and joy in thy Command.
Prolong my life, that I thy Praise may sing.
Lord, thy strayed Sheep back to thy Pasture bring.
PSALM CXX.
As the 5.
Distressed, and in my mind dismayed,
When destitute of humane aid,
To Thee successfully I prayed.
Lord, shield me from the Fraudulent;
From those that are on malice bent;
Who envious Calumnies invent.
O thou false tongue, steeped in the gall
Of Serpents! what reward, for all
Thy mischief, shall to thee befall!
Like Arrows shot from Parthian strings,
Fired Juniper, and Scorpions stings;
Such art thou, O thou worst of things!
Wo's me, that I from Israel
Exiled, must in Mesech dwell;
And in the Tents of Ismael!
O how long shall I live with those,
Whose savage minds sweet Peace oppose;
Where Fury by disswasion grows:
PSALM CXXI.
As the 15.
TO the Hills thine Eyes erect,
Help from those alone expect.
He who Heaven and Earth has made,
Shall from Sion send thee aid.
God thy ever-watchful Guide,
Will not suffer thee to slide.
He, even he, who Israel keeps,
Never slumbers, never sleeps.
He, thy Guard, with Wings displayed,
Shall refresh Thee in their Shade:
Suns shall not with heat infect,
But their temperate beams reflect:
Nor unwholsom Serene shall
From the Moons moist influence fall.
When thou travel'st on the way,
When at home thou spend'st the Day,
When sweet Peace thy life delights,
When imbroyl'd in bloody Fights,
God shall all thy steps attend,
Now, and evermore defend.
PSALM CXXII.
O Happy Summons! As the 111
to the Court
And Temple of the Lord resort.
Jerusalem, our Feet shall tread
Within thy Walls: O thou the Head
Of all the Earth and Judah's Throne;
Three Cities strongly joined in one!
The Tribes in throngs to Thee ascend;
The Tribes which on the Lord depend:
Fat Offerings to his Altar bring,
And his immortal Praises sing.
There shall he his Tribunal place,
The Judgement-feat of David's Race.
Your joys shall with your days increase,
Who love and pray for Salems Peace.
May Peace within thy Walls abound;
Thy Palaces with joy resound:
Even for my Friends and Kindreds sake,
May never War thy Bulwarks shake:
Even for the hope of Israel,
And House, where God vouchsafes to dwell.
PSALM CXXIII.
As the 34.
THou mover of the rolling Spears,
I through the Glasses of my Tears,
To Thee my Eyes erect:
As Servants mark their Masters hands:
As Maids their Mistresses commands,
And liberty expect:
So we, deprest by enemies,
And growing troubles, fix our Eyes
On God, who sits on High:
Till he in mercy shall descend
To give our miseries an end,
And turn our tears to joy.
O save us, Lord, by all forlorn;
The subject of contempt and scorn.
Defend us from their pride,
Who live in fluency and ease;
Who with our woes their malice please,
And miseries deride.
PSALM CXXIV.
BUt that God fought for us, As the 72.
may Israel say;
But that God fought for us, in that sad Day;
When men inflamed with wrath; against us rose:
We had alive been swallowed by our Foes:
Then had we sunk beneath the roaring Waves,
And in their horrid entrails found our graves:
Then had their violence, like torrents poured
From melting Hills, our wretched lives devoured.
O blessed be God! who has not given our blood*
To quench their thirst, nor made our flesh their food.
Our Souls, like Birds, have escaped the Fowlers Net;
The snares are broke, which for our lives were set.
Our only confidence is in his Name,
Who made the Earth, and Heavens immortal frame.
PSALM CXXV.
THey, As the 9.
who the Lord their Fortress make,
Shall like the Towers of Sion rise;
Which dreadful Earthquakes never shake,
Nor raging tumults of the skies.
Lo! as the Hills of Solyma
Divine Jerusalem enclose:
So shall his Angels in the Day
Of danger, shield them from their Foes.
The Wicked shall not long subject
Their holy Race; lest through despair
They should the Laws of God neglect,
And be as their Commanders are.
Lord, to the Good be good; the Just
Protect: Their punishments increase,
Who follow their rebellious lust:
But crown thy Israel with Peace.
PSALM CXXVI.
As the 111
WHen God had our deliverance wrought,
And Sion out of Bondage brought;
It seemed to us a Dream; who were
Distracted between Hope and Fear.
Then sacred Joy filled every Breast:
In flowing Mirth, and Songs expressed.
The wondering Heathen often would say;
How good! how great a God have they!
Great things for us the Lord has wrought;
Above the reach of humane thought:
We therefore will his praises sing.
The Remnant, Lord, from Bondage bring;
As Rivers through the parched Sand,
Or showers which fall on thirsty land.
Who sow in Tears, shall reap in Joy.
We after long Captivity,
Unto our native Soil retire;
The scope and crown of our desire.
PSALM CXXVII.
As the 7.
UNless the Lord the house sustain,
They build in vain;
In vain they watch, unless the Lord
The City guard.
In vain you rise before the Light,
And break the slumbers of the Night.
In vain the bread of sorrow eat,
Got by your sweat;
Unless the Lord with good success
Your labors bless:
For he all good on his bestows,
And crowns their eyes with sweet repose.
Increasing sons, his Heritage,
Renew their age;
The pledges of their fruitful love,
Given from above:
As formidable to the Foe,
As Arrows from a Giants bow.
He is beloved of God, and blessed
Above the rest;
Whose Quivers with such Shafts abound;
By men renowned:
Nor shall his adversary dread;
When they at the Tribunal plead.
PSALM CXXVIII.
HAppy he, As the 15.
who God obeys,
Nor from his direction strayes:
Thou shall of thy labors feed;
All shall to thy wish succeed:
Like a fair and fruitful Vine,
By thy House, thy Wife shall join:
Sons, obedient to command,
Shall about thy Table stand;
Like green plants of Olives, set
By the moistning rivulet.
He who fears the Power above,
Thus shall prosper in his love.
God shall thee from Sion bless;
Thou shall joy in the success
Which the Lord will Salem give,
While thou have a day to live:
Thou shall see our Isreal's peace,
And thy childrens large increase.
PSALM CXXIX.
As the 111
Often from my early youth have they
Afflicted me, may Israel say:
Often from my early youth assailed;
As often have their endeavors failed.
My back with long deep furrows wound;
As Plow-shares ear the patient ground.
The ever Just has broke their bands,
And saved me from their cruel hands*
Let Sions Foes with infamy
Be clothed, and untimely dye.
Be they like Corn on Houses tops,
Which Reapers sickle never crops,
Nor Binder in his bosom bears:
But withers still before it ears.
No Travailer their labors bless,
Nor say, We wish you good success.
PSALM CXXX.
OUt of the horror of the Deep, As the 10.

Where fear and sorrow never sleep,
To the my cries
In sighs arise:
Lord from despair thy servant keep:
O lend a gracious ear,
And my petitions hear.
For if thou should our sins observe:
And punish us, as we deserve:
Not one of all
But then must fall;
Since all from their obedience swerve:
Yet art not thou severe,
That we thy Name might fear.
Thy Mercies our misdeeds transcend:
My hopes upon thy Truth depend:
Disconsolate
On thee I wait;
As weary Sentinels attend
The cheerful Morns uprise
With long-expecting eyes.
O you that are of Jacobs Race,
^n him your Hopes, and Comforts place;
His praises sing;
The living Spring
Of Mercy and redundant Grace:
For he will Israel
Redeem from Sin and Hell.
PSALM CXXXI.
As the 32.
THou Lord my witness art;
I am not proud of heart;
Nor look with lofty eyes;
None envy, nor despise;
Nor to vain pomp apply
My thoughts, nor sore too high:
But in behavior mild;
And as a tender child,
Weaned from his Mothers breast,
On thee alone I rest.
O Israel, adore
The Lord for evermore:
Be He the only scope
Of thy unfainting hope.
PSALM CXXXII.
As the 72.
REmember David, Lord; remember Thou
His Troubles; thy Redemptions; and the Vow
He to the mighty God of Jacob made;
Bound by an Oath; and in these words conveyed:
No Roof shall cover me, nor sweet repose
Refresh my Limbs, or sleep my eyelids close,
'Till I have found a place for his abode;
Even for the Temple of the living God.
The Ark, we heard, in Ephrata long stood;
And found it in the valley clothed with Wood.
We will into thy Tabernacle go,
And there our selves before thy Footstool throw.
Ascend to thy eternal Rest at length;
^hou, and the Ark of thy admired strength.
^ let thy Priests be clothed with sanctity,
and all thy Saints sing with triumphant joy:
^or David's sake, receive into thy Grace:
from thy Anointed never turn thy Face.
^or thus thou swor'st who never wilt forget;
^hy Son shall long possess thy royal Seat:
and if thy Children my commands ob^erve,
^or from the rules of my prescription swerve;
their Offspring shall the Hebrew Scepter sway,
^ven while the Sun illuminates the Day.
^or Sion I have chosen; Sion great
(...) my affections; my eternal Seat.
^ will abundantly increase her store;
And with the flower of Wheat sustain her poor:
Her Priests shall blessings to her People bring;
Her joyful Saints in sacred measures sing.
There shall the Horn of David freshly sprout;
Their lamp of glory never shall burn out:
His Diadem shall flourish on his head:
But Nets of shame his Foes shall overspread.
PSALM CXXXIII.
O Blessed estate! As the 111
blessed from above!
When Brethren join in mutual love.
It Is like the precious Odors shed
On consecrated Aarons head:
Which trickled from his Beard and Breast,
Down to the borders of his Vest.
It Is like the pearls of Dew that drop
On Hermons ever-fragrant top:
Or which the smiling Heavens distill
On happy Sions sacred Hill.
For God has there his favors placed,
And joy, which shall for ever last.
PSALM CXXXIV.
As the 47.
YOu, who the Lord adore,
And at his Altar wait;
Who keep your watch before
The threshold of his Gate;
His praises sing
By silent Night,
Till cheerful light
In the Orient spring.
Your hands devoutly raise
To his divine Recess;
The Worlds Creator praise,
And thus the People bless;
The God of Love,
From Sions Towers,
To you and yours
Propitious prove.
PSALM CXXXV.
As the 72.
O You, who Ephods wear and Incense fling
On sacred flames; Jehovah's praises sing.
You, who his Temple guard, O celebrate
His glorious Name; his noble Acts relate.
How great a joy with such sincere delight
To crown the Day, and entertain the Night!
For Israel is his choice; and Jacobs Race
^is treasure, and the object of his Grace.
(...) power how infinite! how much before
those mortal gods, whom frantic men adore!
^ll on his Will depend; all Homage owe,
(...) Heaven, in Earth, and in the Depths below.
^t his command exhaled Vapors rise,
and in condensed clouds obscure the Skies.
from thence, in showers He horrid Lightning flings;
And from their Caves the struggling Tempests brings.
He the firstborn of Men and Cattle slew;
^resh streams of blood the Towns and Plains imbrew.
The Inhabitants that drink of Nilus flood,
At his confounding Wonders trembling stood.
Great Princes, Part 2.
who excelled in fortitude,
And mighty Nations by his power subdued.
Strong Sihon, whom the Amorites obeyed;
And strenuous Og, who Bashans Scepter swayed;
With all the Kingdoms of the Canaanites,
Who to the Conquerours resign their rights:
To whom he their dismantled Cities grants,
And in those fruitful fields his Hebrews plants.
Thy Name shall last unto Eternity;
And thy immortal Fame shall never dye.
Thou do thy Servant pardon and protect;
Advance the Humble, and the Proud deject.
Those helpless gods, adored in foreign Lands,
Are Gold and Silver; wrought by humane hands:
Blind Eyes have they, deaf Ears, still silent Tongues*
Nor breath exhale from their unactive Lungs.
Who made, resemble them; and such are those,
Who in such senseless stocks their hopes repose.
O praise the Lord, you who from Israel spring;
His Praises, O you Sons of Aaron, sing:
You of the House of Levi praise his Name:
All you who God adore, his Praise proclaim.
From Sion praise the only Good and Great;
Who in Jerusalem has fixed his Seat.
PSALM CXXXVI.

Those Orbs that move so orderly.
Firm Earth above,
The Floods that move
Displayed, and raised the Hills on high.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
Who Sun and Moon informed with Light,
To guide the Day, and rule the Night:
The fixed Stars,
And Wanderers
Created by divine foresight.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
The firstborn of Egyptians slew;
Whose wounds the thirsty Earth imbrew:
And from that Land,
With powerful hand,
The oppressed sons of Jacob drew.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
The parted Seas before them fled,
Who in their empty channels tread:
The joining waves,
Egyptian graves:
And his through food-less Deserts led.
For from the King of kings
Eternal mercy springs.
Who numerous Armies put to flight,
And mighty Princes slew in fight:
Og prostrate laid,
Who Bashan swai'd;
And Sihon the crowned Amorite.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
By his strong hand those Giants fell;
And gave their Lands to Israel:
Confirmed by deed
Unto their Seed:
Who in their conquered Cities dwell.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
Remembered us in our distress;
And freed from those, who did oppress.
He food does give
To all that live.
The God of Heaven, O Israel, bless.
For from the King of kings
Eternal Mercy springs.
PSALM CXXXVII.
As the 1.
AS on Euphrates shady banks we lay,
And there, O Sion, to thy Ashes pay
Our funeral tears: our silent Harps, unstrung.
And unregarded, on the Willows hung.
Lo, they who had thy desolation wrought,
And captived Judah unto Babel brought,
Deride the tears which from our Sorrows spring;
And say in scorn, A Song of Sion sing.
Shall we profane our Harps at their command?
Or holy Hymns sing in a foreign Land?
O Solyma! thou that art now become
A heap of stones, and to thy self a Tomb!
When I forget thee, my dear Mother, let
My fingers their melodious skill forget:
When I a joy disjoined from thine, receive;
Then may my tongue unto my palate cleave.
Remember Edom, Lord; their cruel pride,
Who in the Sack of wretched Salem cried;
Down with their Buildings, raze them to the ground,
Nor let one Stone be on another found.
Thou Babylon, whose Towers now touch the Sky,
That shortly shall as low in ruins lie;
O happy! O thrice happy they, who shall
With equal cruelty revenge our fall!
That dash thy Childrens brains against the stones:
And without pity hear their dying groans.
PSALM CXXXVIII.
MY Soul, As the 46.
applaud our glorious King;
Before the Gods his praises sing:
His Mercy an eternal Spring.
For this, on consecrated ground
Will I adore; thy Truth resound;
Thy Word above all Names renowned.
Thou heard'st me, when to thee I cried;
When Danger charged on every side;
By thee confirmed and fortified.
All those, who awful Scepters bear,
When they of thy Performance hear,
Shall worship thee with reverent fear.
They shall his Truth and Mercy praise,
Who all the World with justice swaies;
Whose Wonders Adoration raise.
Although enthroned above the Skies,
He on the lowly casts his eyes,
But does the Insolent despise.
Though storms of Troubles me enclose;
Yet thou shall save me from my Foes,
And raise me in their overthrows.
For God his Promise will effect;
The Faithful faithfully protect;
Nor ever his own Choice reject.
PSALM CXXXIX.
As the 111
THou know me, O thou only Wise;
See when I sit, and when I rise;
Can my concealed thoughts disclose;
Observ'st my Labors and Repose;
Know all my Counsels, all my Deeds,
Each word which from my Tongue proceeds:
Behind, before, by thee enclosed;
Thy Hand on every part imposed.
Such knowledge my capacity
Transcends; so wonderful, so high!
O which way shall I take my flight?
Or where conceal me from thy sight?
Ascend I Heaven; Heaven is thy Throne:
Dive I to Hell; there art thou known.
Should I the Mornings wings obtain,
And fly beyond the Hesperian Main;
Thy powerful Arm would reach me there,
Reduce, and curb me with thy fear.
Were I involved in shades of Night;
That Darkness would convert to Light.
What Clouds can from discovery free!
What Night, wherein thou can not see!
The Night would shine likes Days clear flame;
Darkness and Light, to Thee the same.
Thou sift'st my reins, even thoughts to come:
Thou cloth'dst me in my Mothers womb.
Great God, that have so strangely raised
This Fabric, be thou ever praised.
O full of Admiration Part 2.

Are these thy Works! to me well-known.
My Bones were to thy view displaid,
When I in secret shades was made;
When wrought by thee with curious art,
As in the Earths inferior part.
On me, an Embryon, did thou look:
My members written in thy Book
Before they were: which perfect grew
In time, and open to the view.
Thy Counsels admirable are;
And yet as infinite as rare.
O could I number them, far more
Than Sands upon the murmuring shore!
When I awake, thy Works again
My thoughts with wonder entertain.
The Wicked thou will surely kill.
Hence you, who blood with pleasure spill.
Their tongues thy Majesty profane;
They take thy sacred Name in vain.
Lord, hate not I thy Enemies?
And grieve, when they against thee rise?
I hate them with a perfect hate;
And, as my Foes, would ruinate.
Search and explore my heart: O try
My thoughts, and their Integrity.
Behold, if I from Virtue stray:
And lead in thy eternal Way.
PSALM CXL.
As the 14.
LOrd, save me from the Violent;
From him who takes delight in ill:
Whose heart Deceit and Mischief fill;
On bloody War and Outrage bent.
Their wounding Tongues, like Serpents whet;
Poison of Asps their Lips enclose.
O save from fierce and Wicked Foes;
Who toils, to overthrow me, set!
The Proud have hid their cords and snares;
Spread all their Nets; their Gins have laid.
To God, Thou art my God, I said;
O gently hear thy Suppliant's prayers.
My strong Preserver in the fight,
As with a Helm, my head defends.
Let not the Wicked gain their ends;
Lord, lest their pride rise with their might.
Themselves let their own Slanders wound:
Destroy Him who their fury leads.
Let burning coals fall on their heads;
And quenchless flames embrace them round.
Cast them into the Depths below;
From thence, O never let them rise!
Let Death the Slanderer surprise;
And Mischief salvage Wrath overthrow.
God to the Afflicted aid will give;
The Poor defend from Death and Shame.
The Just shall celebrate thy Name;
And ever in thy Presence live.
PSALM CXLI.
TO Thee I cry; Lord, hear my cries; As the 22.

O come with speed unto my aid:
Let my sad Prayers before Thee rise,
Like Incense on the Altar laid;
Or as when I, with hands displaid,
Present my Evening Sacrifice.
Before my mouth a Guardian set;
My Lips with bars of Silence close.
O let me not thy Laws forget;
And wickedly combine with those,
Who Thee, and all that is good, oppose;
Nor of their deadly Dainties eat.
But let the Just wound and reprove;
Such stripes and checks, an argument
Of their sincere and prudent love;
Like Odours of a fragrant Scent,
Poured on my head, no breaches rent.
My prayers shall for their safety move.
Among Rocks their Chiefs in ambush lie,
Yet have my sufferings understood.
Our severed bones are scattered by
The mouths of graves, like clefts of Wood.
Lord, save from those, that hunt for blood:
On Thee with faith I cast mine eye.
O from their Machinations free,
That would my guiltless Soul betray;
From those who in my wrongs agree,
And for my life their engines lay.
May they by their own craft decay;
But let me thy Salvation see.
PSALM CXLII.
As the 4.
WIth sighs and cries to God I praid;
To him my supplication made;
Poured out my tears,
My cares and fears;
My wrongs before him laid.
My fainting spirits almost spent:
He knew the path in which I went.
Yet in my way
Their snares they lay,
With merciless intent.
My Eyes I round about me throw;
None see, that will the Oppressed know;
No refuge left;
Of hope bereft;
Vain pity none bestow.
Then unto God I cried, and said,
Thou art my Hope, and only Aid,
The Portion
I build upon,
While with frail flesh araid.
O Sourse of Mercy, hear my cry,
Lest I with wasting sorrow die:
Shield from my foes,
Who now enclose;
Since of more strength than I.
My Soul out of this Prison bring,
That I may praise thee, O my King.
Who trust in thee,
Shall compass me,
And of thy Bounty sing.
PSALM CXLIII.
LOrd, to my cries afford an ear, As the 39.

The afflicted hear;
According to thy Equity,
And Truth reply;
Nor prove severe: for in thy sight
None living shall be found upright.
The Foe my Soul besieges round,
Strikes to the ground:
In darkness has inveloped,
Like men long dead:
My mind with sorrow overthrown;
My heart within me stupid grown.
I call to mind those ancient Days
Filled with thy praise:
Thy Works alone possess my thought,
With wonder wrought.
To thee I stretch my zealous Hand;
Desired like rain by thirsty land.
Part 2.
Approach with speed; my Spirits fail;
Thy Face unveil:
Least I forthwith grow like to those,
Whom graves enclose.
O let me of thy Mercy hear,
Before the morning Sun appear.
My God, thou art the only scope
Of all my hope:
O show me thy prescribed way,
Lest I should stray.
For to thy Throne I raise mine eyes;
My Soul, and all my faculties.
Save from my Foes: to Thee lo I
For refuge fly:
Inform me, that I may fulfill
Thy sacred Will.
My God, let thy good Spirit lead,
That in thy paths my Feet may tread.
O for thy Honor quicken me,
Who trust in Thee:
Out of these Straights, for Justice sake,
Thy Servant take.
In mercy cut thou off my Foes,
Whose hate has multiplied my woes.
PSALM CXLIV.
As the 111
THe Lord, my Strength, be only praised;
The Lord, who has my courage raised:
In doubtful Battle given me might,
And skill how to direct, and fight.
My Fautor, Fortress, high-built Tower;
My Rock, Redeemer, Shield and Power;
My only Confidence; who still
^ubjects my People to my will.
Lord, what is Man, or his frail Race,
That thou should such a vapor grace!
Man nothing is but vanity;
A shadow swiftly gliding by.
Great God, stoop from the bending Skies,
The Mountains touch, and Clouds shall rise;
from thence thy winged Lightning throw;
Rout and confound the flying Foe;
Stretch down thy hand, which only saves,
And snatch me from the furious Waves.
Free from rebellious Enemies,
^^ur'd to perjuries and lies:
Their Hands defiled with fraud and wrong.
Then will I in a new-made Song,
Unto the softly-warbling string,
Of thy Illustrious Praises sing.
Thou Kings preserv'st; have me preserved; Part ^.

Even David, who thy Will observed;
^ree from rebellious Enemies,
Inured to perjuries and lies:
Foul deeds their violent hands defile;
Hands prone to treachery and guile:
That in their Youth our Sons may grow
Like Laurel Groves; our Daughters show
Like polished pillars decked with Gold;
Which high and Royal roofs uphold:
Our Magazines abound with Grain,
Provision of all sorts contain:
Increasing Flocks our Pastures fill,
And well-fed Steers the Fallows till;
That no incursions Peace affright;
No Armies join in dreadful fight;
No daring Foe our Walls invest,
Nor fearful shrieks disturb our rest.
Blessed People! who in this estate
Enjoy your selves without debate!
And happy, O thrice happy they,
Who for their God, the Lord obey!
PSALM CXLV.
As the 111
I Still will of thy Glory sing;
Thy Name extol, my God, my King.
No day shall pass without thy praise;
Praised while the Sun his Beams displays.
Great is the Lord, whose praise exceeds:
Inscrutable are all his Deeds.
One Age shall to another tell
Thy Works, which so in power excel.
The Beauty of thy Excellence,
And Oracles intrance my Sense.
Men shall thy dreadful Acts relate;
My Verse thy Greatness celebrate;
To memory thy Favors bring,
And of thy noble Justice sing.
For in Thee Grace and Pity live;
To anger slow, swift to forgive.
All on thy Goodness, Lord, depend:
Thy Mercies all thy Works transcend;
Even all thy Works shall praise thy Name;
Thy Saints shall celebrate the same:
Of thy far-spreading Empire speak;
Thy Power, to which all Powers are weak:
To make thy Acts to Mortals known,
And glory of thy awful Throne.
Thy Kingdom never shall have end: Part 2

Thy Rule beyond Times flight extend.
The Lord shall those, who fall, sustain;
And Souls dejected raise again.
All seek from Thee their livelihood;
Thou in due season giv'st them food:
Thy liberal Hand, Men, Birds, and Beasts,
Even all that live, with plenty feasts.
The Lord is Just in all his Ways,
Who Mercy in his Works displaies;
^s present by his power with all,
Who on his Name sincerely call:
For he will their desires effect;
Regard their cries; from Foes protect.
Who love Him, Safety shall enjoy:
The Lord the Wicked will destroy.
My Tongue his Goodness shall proclaim.
Mankind, for ever praise his Name.
PSALM CXLVI. Hallelu-jah.
O My Soul, praise thou the Lord: As the 29.

Whilst thou liv'st, his praise record.
Whilst I am, eternal King,
I will of thy praises sing.
O, no hope in Princes place;
Trust in none of humane race;
Who can give no help at all,
Nor prevent his proper fall.
When his parting breath expires,
He again to Earth retires.
Even in that uncertain day
All his thoughts with him decay.
Happy he, whom God protects;
He, on whom his Grace reflects.
Happy he, who plants his trust
On the only Good and Just.
He who Heavens bl^w Arch displayed;
He who Earths Foundation laid;
Spread the Land-imbracing Main;
Made what ever all contain:
True to what his Word professed;
He revengeth the oppressed;
Hungry Souls with food sustains,
And unbinds the Prisoners chains:
To the blind restores his sight;
Rears, who fall by wicked might.
Righteousness his Soul affects.
Friendless Strangers he protects,
Widows, and the Fatherless;
Those confounds who these oppress.
Zion, God, thy God shall reign,
While the Poles their Orbs sustain.
Hallelu-jah.
PSALM CXLVII.
As the III
JEhovah praise with one consent.
How comely! sweet! how excellent,
To sing our great Creators praise!
Whose hands late ruined Salem raise,
Collecting scattered Israel,
That they in their own Towns may dwell:
He cures the sorrows of our minds;
Our wounds imbalms, and softly binds.
He numbers Heavens bright-sparkling Flames,
And calls them by their several Names.
Great is our God, and great in might;
His Knowledge O most infinite!
The Humble unto Thrones erects;
The Insolent to Earth dejects.
Present your thanks to our great King;
On solemn Harps his Praises sing;
Who Heaven with gloomy Vapors hides,
And timely Rain for Earth provides.
With grass he clothes the pregnant Hills,
And hungry beasts with Herbage fills.
He feeds the Ravens croaking brood,
(Left by the Old) that cry for food.
He cares not for the strength of Horse, Part 2.

Nor man's strong limbs, and matchless force:
But those affects, who in his Path
Their feet direct with constant Faith.
O Solyma, Jehovah praise;
To God thy Voice, O Sion, raise:
Who has thy City fortified*
Thy streets with Citizens supplied:
Firm peace in all thy borders set,
And fed thee with the flower of Wheat.
He sends forth his Commands, which fly
More swift than Lightning through the Sky:
The Snow-like Wool on Mountains spreads;
And hoary Frosts like Ashes sheds;
While solid Floods their course refrain,
What Mortal can his cold sustain?
At his Command, by Wind and Sun
Dissolved the unfettered Rivers run.
His Laws to Jacob he has shown;
His Judgments are to Israel known.
Not so with other Nations deals,
From whom his Statutes he conceals.
PSALM CXLVIII. Hallelu-jah.
As the 29.
YOu, who dwell the Skies,
Free from humane miseries;
You whom highest Heaven imbowers,
Praise the Lord with all your powers.
Angels, your clear Voices raise;
Him you Heavenly Armies praise:
Sun, and Moon with borrowed light;
All you sparkling Eyes of Night:
Waters hanging in the air;
Heaven of Heavens his Praise declare.
His deserved Praise record;
His, who made you by his Word;
Made you evermore to last,
Set your bounds not to be past.
Let the Earth his Praise resound:
Monstrous Whales, and Seas profound;
Vapors, Lightning, Hail, and Snow;
Storms, which when he bids them, blow:
Flowery Hills, and Mountains high;
Cedars, neighbors to the Sky;
Trees that fruit in season yield;
All the Cattle of the Field;
Salvage beasts; all creeping things;
All that cut the Air with wings.
You who awful Scepters sway;
You inured to obey;
Princes, Judges of the Earth;
All of high and humble birth;
Youths, and Virgins, flourishing
In the beauty of your spring:
You who bow with Ages weight;
You, who were but born of late:
Praise his Name with one consent:
O how great! how excellent!
Than the Earth profounder far;
Higher than the highest star.
He will his to honor raise.
You his Saints, resound his Praise;
You who are of Jacobs Race,
And united to his Grace.
Hallelu-jah.
PSALM CXLIX.
TO the God, whom we adore, As the 29.

Sing a Song unsung before:
His immortal Praise rehearse,
Where his Holy Saints converse.
Israel, O thou his Choice,
In thy Makers Praise rejoice:
Zions Sons, rejoice, and sing
To the Honor of your King.
In the Dance his Praise resound;
Strike the Harp, let Timbrels sound.
God in Goodness infinite,
In his People takes delight.
God with safety will adorn
Those, whom men afflict with scorn.
Let his Saints in glory joy;
Sing as in their Beds they lie:
Highly praise the living Lord;
Armed with their two-edged Sword,
All the Heathen to confound;
And the Nations bordering round;
Binding all their Kings with cords;
Fettring their captived Lords:
That they in divine pursuit,
May his Judgments execute;
As it is writ, such Honor shall
Unto all his Saints befall.
Hallelu-jah.
PSALM CL. Hallelu-jah.
As the 29.
PRaise the Lord enthroned on high;
Praise him in his Sanctity;
Praise him for his mighty Deeds;
Praise him who in Power exceeds;
Praise with Trumpets, pierce the Skies;
Praise with Harps and Psalteries;
Praise with Timbrels, Organs, Flutes;
Praise with Violins, and Lutes;
Praise, with silver Cymbals sing;
Praise on those which loudly ring.
Angels, ^ll of humane birth,
Praise the Lord of Heaven and Earth.
Hallelu-jah.
FINIS.
