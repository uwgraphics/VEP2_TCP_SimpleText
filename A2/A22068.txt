HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas We are daily informed by the Officers of Our Mint and otherwise, That
as well diverse of Our natural borne Subjects, both Goldsmithes, Merchants, and
men of other Trades; As also Strangers inhabiting within this Our Realm of
England, have presumed for their private lucre and gain, and daily do presume
to weigh all sorts of Moneys current within this Our Realm of England, to the
end to cull out the old and new Moneys, which either by not wearing, or by any
other accident in the making thereof are more weighty then the rest, Some part
of which Moneys so culled out, We have found (when it pleased Our self to
enter into the examination thereof) to be daily openly sold to Goldsmithes, and
by them employed for the making of Plate, and Vessel of all sorts within this
our Realm of England; And some part to be Transported into foreign parts for
private men's particular gain, whereby there is a great scarsitie of good Money
likely to ensue, if present remedy be not provided for the same: We therefore
in Our Princely care intending with all convenient speed to redress so great
and insufferable a mischief, Do by this Our Proclamation make known unto all
men, that Our will and pleasure is, And We do hereby straightly charge and
command, That no Goldsmith, or other person or persons of what estate soever he
or they be, (other then the Master and Officers of Our Mint, for the service
and employment thereof) presume or enterprise to melt any Moneys of Gold or
Silver, being the proper Coins of any Our Realms or Dominions, or current
within the same, or any of them, either to make Plate or Vessel thereof, or
for any other use whatsoever, or do presume to cull or choose out from the rest
any weighty Moneys, to the intent to convey the same out of the Realm, or to
melt, or otherwise to alter it from Coin, upon pain of Our heavy
displeasure, and of such pains and punishments, as upon the contemners of Our
Royal commandment, grounded upon the public good, may be inflicted.

Given at Our Manor of Greenwich the eighteenth day of May, in the ninth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO 1611.
