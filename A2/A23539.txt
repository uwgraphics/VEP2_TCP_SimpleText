A godly ditty or Prayer to be song unto God for the preservation of his
Church, our Queen and Realm, against all Traitors, Rebels, and Papisticall
Enemies.
Preserve thy Servant Lord,
Elizabeth our Queen:
Be thou her shield and sword,
Now let thy power be seen.
That this our Queen anointed,
May vanquish al her foes:
And as by thee appointed,
Let her lay sword on those.


Give Lord true faithful hearts,
To us her Subjects al:
That we play not the parts,
Of these Traitors that fall
Both from their God and Prince,
And from their lawful oaths:
All such O Lord convince,
And give them overthrows.
Sing this after the tune of the.cxxxvij. Psalm, which begins When as we sat
in Babylon. Or such like.

Our living God to thee we cry,
Now tend unto our playnt:
Behold thy Church and family,
Which enmies seek to faint.
And though our syns have moved thee
Just plagues on us to pour:
Yet let thy Christ's death shortly
Thy wrath up clean devour.
Correct us Lord by thine own hand,
And leave us not to those:
That do thee and thy truth withstand
Like diulysh deadly foes.
For better is it for us Lord
Into thy hands to fall:
Then unto them for to accord,
Which in hell perish shall.
Behold (O Lord) thine enmies rage
Against thee and thy Christ:
Not our syns they seek to aswage,
But thy truth to resist.
And shall our syns then be a let
For thee them to withstand:
Seeing against thee they be set?
No Lord, set to thy hand.
For thine the glory is, not ours
Which they seek to suppres:
Bend therefore Lord thine host of powrs
And this thy cause redres.
Resist these Rebels and Traitors,
With Papists every one:
Which thy poor people so deuours
In every nation.
Let not the wicked thus prevail,
To vex thy Church and Saints:
But stroy them from the head to tail,
Let none bewail their playntes.
Lord hear the cry of Fatherles.
And Wyddowes which do moan:
The which these enmies do oppres
With mischiefs many one.
Defend O God our gracious Queen,
From Pope Rebel, and all:
And as by her thy works be seen,
So let thy wrath now fall
Upon all those that vex thy truth,
Our Queen, our Realm and state:
And let their vicious prankes of ruth
Light upon their own pace.
So shall thy name be magnified,
So shall thy power be known:
So shall our Christ be sanctified,
By them that be his own.
Wherefore O Lord grant our requests
Which here to thee we make:
And make us love and live thy hestes,
For thy Christ Jesus sake.
FINIS.
Quoth Ioh. Awdely.
