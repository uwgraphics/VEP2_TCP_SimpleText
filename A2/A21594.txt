By the Queen.
FORASMVCH as contrary to good order and express laws made by Parliament, in
the xxxiii. year of the Reign of the Queens Majesty's most noble father of
worthy memory King Henry the eight: Many men do daily use to ride with
Handgonnes and Dagges, under the length of three quarters of a yard, whereupon
have followed occasions for sundry lewd and evil persons, with such unlawful
Gonnes and Dagges now in time of peace to execute great and notable Robberies,
and horrible murders: As of late in certain Shyres of this Realm has
pityfully ben put in ure.

Her Majesty consydering, with the advise of her Couusayle, how beneficial a
law the same is, and specially at this time most needful of dew execution, and
how negligently it is of late observed: Straightly therefore charge and
commands, not only all manner her loving subjects from henceforth to have
good and special regard to the due execution of the same Statute, and of
every part thereof, but also that all Justices of peace in their next Sessions,
according to the tenor thereof, cause the same exquisitely to be inquired upon
and executed.

Yeuen at our Palayce of Westmynster, the xvii. day of May, the first year of
our raygne. God save the Queen.
Imprinted by Richard Judge and John Cawood Printers to the Queens Majesty.

Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
