The Gold and Silver Exported for India, from the second of March 1673. to the
eleventh of March 1674. was by Entry at the Custom-house, for the Port of
London, Five hundred sixty and odd thousand pounds, besides what was Entered in
the Out Ports, and without Entry Exported.

The Company Exporting so great quantities of Gold and Silver, has inhanced
the price of Standard Silver, from under Five shillings the Ounce, to Five
shillings and four pence, which is Ten per Cent. and a Twenty shillings piece
of broad Gold to Twenty and four shillings, which is Twenty per Cent. and
Guinneys in proportion, which is so much in Value above his Majesty's Coin,
that it does not only hinder the Bullion of Gold and Silver, Imported, from
being Coined, but has occasioned all the weighty Coin to be Culled out and
melted into Bullion.

So that there is not above Fifteen or Twenty pound of Current money in One
hundred pound, when the light and clipped money is taken out.

It is thought there is not above Four or Five millions of money left in the
Kingdom, which is not sufficient to manage the Trade which is reputed to be
above Forty millions a year.

The Free Exporting of Gold and Silver, and laying so great Impositions by
Mulct, on all the Commodities and Manufactures of this Kingdom, hinde^s the
Exporting thereof; which has brought down the prizes of Land, Lead, Tin, Wool,
and all Woollen and other Manufactures.
