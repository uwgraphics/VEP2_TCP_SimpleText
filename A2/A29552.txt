THE Baiting of the TIGER: OR, A true Relation of a bloody Rencounter that
lately happened between a foreign Cat, and four great English Dogs, at the
Cockpit Royal near St. James's Park, in the presence of several Dukes, Lords,
Knights, Ladies, Squires, and Cits: Together with a particular Relation how the
first Dog was slain, and the rest dangerously wounded. Set forth in a piece of
Doggrel, for the benefit and satisfaction of the Public.
I Have read of Bull Fights,
Rencounters of Knights,
Dog-fighting, and such sport as that:
I have seen Dogs and Bears
Together by the Ears,
And a Rabble a worrying a Cat.
I have heard much of Don,
And of Sancho his Man,
Of Bevis, of Guy, and Orlando;
How St. George slew the Dragon,
An Exploit we still brag on,
And from ruin delivered the Land O.
I have seen a fierce Beau,
That has made a fine show,
Undergoing a sharp Bastinado:
Seen a Squire in a Muff,
Endure Kick and Cuff,
Without lugging out to make a-do.
But this is mere Tattle,
Compared to the Battle
Between the great Dogs and the Tiger:
And had you been there,
You Would have said, I dare swear,
You never saw a Cat of more vigor.
The first that came at him,
Had you seen how he scrat him,
How he raked off his Skin and his Fur:
How he sucked out his vital,
Oh! who can recite all,
But must needs lament the poor Cur?
The second indeed
Did better succeed,
And gave him a snap on the Snout.
But yet for all that,
He'ad been slain by the Cat,
Had the Battle been fairly fought out.
The third and the fourth,
Came scurvily off;
But withal did bravely distinguish
Themselves more fool hardy,
Than any ways tardy;
In short, the Dogs were true English.
The Sport was sublime,
Too big for my Rhyme,
And who would think much of a Guinea
To see a Cat scratch and bite,
Houl, grin, p -- and sh --
There Is no Man, I Am sure, but a Ninny.
I appeal to the Ladies,
To those that now adays
Are neither quite virtuous nor common,
If they ever saw a Brute
So fiercely dispute,
On his Back, the grand posture of Woman?
Indeed for the squabble,
Between the Gentry and Rabble,
That was not so well I confess:
I Will tell you by the by,
When 'twas you Lie, and you Lie,
I wished my self out of the Press.
To conclude, tho the Sport
Was the first of the sort,
'Twas damnable dear of a Guinea;
If a thing be but new,
Let what will ensue,
Ye follow't as the Devil were in ye.
