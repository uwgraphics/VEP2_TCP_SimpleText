Printed in the year, 1641.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and all the
Commons of England, against Sir Richard Weston Knight, one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, impraching him as follows.
1. THat the said Sir Richard Weston about the month of November, Anno Domini
1635. then being one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, and
having taken an oath for the due Administration of Justice to his Majesty's
liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed
his name to an opinion in haec verba: I am of opinion, etc. ut supra in Sir
Robert Berkley's Charge.

2. That in or about the month of February, Anno Domini 1636 the said Sir
Richard Weston (being then one of the Barons of the said Court of Exchequer)
subscribed an extraiudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a Letter from
his Majesty in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned,
etc, utsupra.

3 That the said Sir Richard Weston (being then one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer) did deliver his opinion and judgment in the
Exchequer chamber against John Hampden Esquire in the Case of shipmoney, That
he the said John Hampden, etc. as in Judge Crawley's Charg.

4. That where as in the month of April 16. Carol, the Officers of the
Custom House having seized a ship of one Samuel Warner's, laden with Tobacco,
being the goods of the said Warner, the bulk of the said ship not being
broken, and no information exhibited for the King, according to the course of
the Exchequer for any duty, the Barons were moved, that the said ship might be
restored to the Proprietors, giving security to pay such duties as did belong
to the King: But, upon the allegation of the Kings Attorney, that there needed
no information, because there was no penalty, the said Sir Richard Weston
(being then one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together
with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court) did (contrary to his oath,
and contrary to the Laws of this Realm) deny the restitution of the said
ship, unless all the duties demanded by the Farmers of the Custom House were
first paid. Hereupon the said Warner brought an action of Trover upon the case
in the Office of Pleas in the Exchequer against the said Officers that seized
his ship and goods: Whereupon the Kings Attorney General exhibited an
Information by English Bill in the Exchequer-chamber against the said Warner,
setting forth, that Customs and Subsidies upon Merchandise were a great part
of the Kings revenue, and payable to him, and that the said ship was seized for
non-payment of the aforesaid duties: Notwithstanding the said Warner the
proprietor prosecuted the Officers upon a Suit at Law, and prays that he may
answer the said information before any further proceedings be had at Law.
Thereupon the said Sir Richard Weston, together with the rest of the then
Barons of the said Court of Exchequer, ordered that the proprietor moving for
delivery of his said goods, should first answer to the Information, after which
the said Warner demurred to the said Information, in regard no title for any
certain duty was set forth by the Information: Which demurrer yet remains not
overruled, but the said Sir Richard Weston (with the said other Barons)
without overruling the demurrer, ordered (because Warner had put in a demurrer,
and not answered to the said Information) that he should not proceed upon the
action of Trover. The proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy by action
at Law, sued forth a Replevin, and (upon pretense of viewing the said goods)
caused them to be brought forth of a Cellar, hired by a Deputy to the Farmors
to that use, and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriffs of
London, by virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of the
taking, as aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the president,
inrolls his case; the said Sir Richard Weston, with the said other Barons,
adjudged that the said goods were not replevisable, and granted an Iniunction
to maintain the possession of them, as they were before.

And the said house of Commons by Protestation, saving to themselves only the
liberties of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Sir Richard Weston, and also of replying to the
answer that he, the said Sir Richard Weston shall make unto the said Articles,
or any of them, or of offering proof of the premises, or any of their
impeachments or accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the case shall
(according to the course of Parliaments) require, do pray, that the said Sir
Richard Weston, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, may be
put to answer, etc.

The Articles of impeachment of Sir Robert Berkley Knight, one of the Justices
of the Court of the Kings Bench; by the Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, in their own name, and in the name of all the Commons of England, in
maintenance of their accusation, whereby he stands charged with high treason,
and other great misdemeanors.
1. INprimis, that the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices
of the said Court of Kings Bench, has traitorously, and wickedly endeavored to
subvert the fundamental Laws, and established government of the Realm of
England; and in stead thereof, to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical
government against Law, which he has declared by traitorous and wicked words,
opinions, judgments, practices, and actions appearing in the several Articles
ensuing.

2. Whereas by the Statute made in the five and twentieth year of the reign
of the late King Henry the eight, prices of victuals are appointed to be rated
in such manner, as in the said Statute is declared: But it is manifest by the
said Statute, Corn is none of the victuals thereby intended. Nevertheless
some ill affected persons endeavoring to bring a charge upon the subjects
contrary to Law, did surmise that the prices of Corn might be rated, and set
according to the direction of that Statute, and thereupon great gain might be
raised to his Majesty, by licenses and dispensations, for selling Corn at
other prices: And a command from his Majesty being procured to the Judges, and
sent to them by William Noy Esquire, his Majesty's then Attorney general, to
deliver their opinions touching the question, whether Corn was such victuals
as was intended to have the price rated within the said Statute: In answer to
which demand, the said Sir Robert Rerkley then being one of his Majesty's
Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, in furtherance of the said unlawful
charge, endeavored to be imposed, as aforesaid, he thirtieth day of Novem in
the eight year of his now Hajesties Reign, did deliver his opinion, that
Corn was such victual as was intended to have the price rated within the said
Statute, which said opinion was contrary to Law, and to the plain sense and
meaning of the said Statute; and contrary to his own knowledge, and was given
and delivered by him, with a purppose and intention, that the said unlawful
charge might be imposed upon the Subject.

3. That an information being preferred in the Court of Star Chamber by the
said William Noy, his Majesty's then Attorney general, against John Overman
and fifteen other Soape-makers Defendanes, charging them with several
pretended offenses, contrary to diverse Letters Patents, and Proclamations,
touthing the making and uttering Soape, and using the trade of Soape-makers,
and other offenses in the said Information mentioned, whereunto the Defendants
did plead, and demurre as to part, and answer to other part of the said
Information: And the said Plea and demurrer being over ruled, for that the
particulars therein insisted upon, would appear more fully after answer and
proof; therefore the Defendants were ordered to answer without prejudice, and
were to be admitted to such exceptions to the said Information, and advantages
of the matter of the Plea and demurrer upon the hearing as shall be material;
and accordingly the Defendants did put in their answers, and set forth several
Acts of Parliament, Letters Parents, Charters, Customs, and Act of Common
Council of the City of London, and other matters materially conducing to their
defense; and in conclusion pleaded not guilty. The said Sir Robert Berkler then
being one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, upon the 30. day of
March, in the eighth year of his Majesty's now Reign, upon an Order of
Reference to him and others by the said Court of Star Chamber, to consider of
the impertinency of the said answers, did certify the said Court of
Star Chamber, that the whole answers, excepting the four words, and ten last
lines, should be expunged, leaving thereby no more substance of the said
answers, then the Plea of not guilty. And after upon a Reference to him and
others, by order of the said Court, of the impertinency of the Interrogatories
and depositions of witnesses taken on the Defendants part; in the same case the
said Sir Robert Berkley, upon the second day of May, in the eighth year of his
now Majesty's Reign, certified that nine and thirty of the said
Interrogarories, and the deposi^ions upon them taken, should be suppressed
with answers (except as aforesaid) and depositions, although the same did
contain the said Defendants most material defense. Yet were expunged and
suppressed according to the said certificates; both which said certificates
were contrary to Law and Justice, and contrary to his the said Sir Robert
Berkley's own knowledge, and contrary to the said former order, whereby the
advantages were saved to the Defendants, as aforesaid: And by reason thereof,
the said John Overman, and the said other fifteen Defendants, were sentenced
in the said Court of Star Chamber, to be committed prisoners to the Fleet, and
disabled from using their trade of Soap-makers: And one of them fined in a
thousand five hundred pounds; two of them in a thousand pound a piece; four of
them in a thousand Mark a piece; which fines were estreated into the Exchequer
without any mitigation: And the said Defendants according to the said sentence
were imprisoned, and deprived of their trade and livelihood, tending to the
utter rnine of the said Defendants, and to the overthrow of free trade, and
contrary to the liberty of Subjects.

4. That he the said Sir Robert Berkley then being one of the Justices of the
Kings Bench, and having taken an oath for the due administration of Justice,
according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, to his Majesty's Liege
people; on or about the last of December subscribed an opinion in haec verba;
[I am of opinion, that as where the benefit does more particularly redound to
the good of the Ports or Maritime parts, (as in case of Pyracy or D^predations
upon the Seas) there the charge has been, and may be lawfully imposed upon
them, according to presidents of former times; so where the good and safety of
the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in danger (of
which his Majesty is the only Judge) there the charge of the defense ought to
be borne by all the Realm in general; this I hold agreeable both to Law and
reason.]

5. That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid; In Febru. 1636. subscribed
an extrajudiciall opinion, in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty,
in haec verba;

Charles R.

When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole Kingdom in danger; Whether may not the King by writ under the great
Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this Kingdom, at their charge to
provide and furnish such number of Ships, with Men, Victuals, and Munition;
and for such time as he shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril? And by Law compel the doing thereof in
case of refusal, or refractorinesse? and whether in such case is not the King
the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when and how the same is to be
prevented and avoided?

C. R.


May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have according to your Majesty's
command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together, taken into
serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty, and
enclosed in your Royal Letter: And we are of opinion, that when the good and
safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may by writ under the great Seal of England, command all
your subjects of this your Kingdom, at their charge to provide and furnish
such number of Ships, with Men, Victual, and Munition; and for such time as
your Majefly shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the Kingdom
from such danger and peril; And that by Law your Majesty may compel the doing
thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are also of opinion
that in such case, your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger, and when
and how the same is to be prevented and avoided.

William Jones, George Crook, Thomas Trevor, George Vernon, Robert Barkley,
Francis Crawley, Richard Westone.

6. That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid, did on the (...) deliver
his opinion in the Exchequer Chamber against John Hampden Esquire, in the Case
of Ship-mony, that he the said John Hampden upon the matter and substance of
the Case, was chargeable with the money then in question: A coppie of which
proceeding and judgment, the Commons of this present Parliament have delivered
to your Lordships.

7. That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and one of the Justices of Assize for the County of
York; did at the Assizes held at York in Lent, 1636. deliver in his charge to
the grand Jury, that it was a lawful and inseparable flower of the Crown,
for the King to command not only the Maritime Counties, but also those that
were Inland to find ships for the defense of the Kingdom. And then likewise
falsely, and maliciously affirmed, that it was not his single judgment, but
the judgment of all his brethren, witnessed by their subscriptions: And then
also said, that there was a rumor that some of his Brethren that had
subscribed, were of a contrary judgment; but it was a base and unworthy thing,
for any to give his hand contrary to his heart; and then wished for his own
part that his hand might rot from his arm, that was guilty of any such crime,
when as he knew that Mr. Justice Hullen and Mr. Justice Cro^k^, who had
subscribed, were of a contrary opinion, and was present when they were
persuaded to subscribe; and did subscribe for conformity, only because the
major number of the Judges had subscribed. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley
then also said, that in some Cases the Judges were above an Act of Parliament;
which said, falls malicious words were uttered, as aforesaid, with intent and
purpose to countenance and maintain the said unjust opinions, and to terrify
his Majesty's Subjects that should refuse to pay Ship Money, or seek any
remedy by Law against the said unjust and illegal taxation.

8. That whereas Richard Chambers Merchant, having commenced a suit for
trespass and false impr^sonment against Sir Edward Bromfield Knight, for
imprisoning him the said Chambers for refusing to pay Shipmony, in the time
that the said Sir Edward Bromfield was Lord Mayor of the City of London, in
which sure the said Sir Edward Bromfield did make a special justification: The
said Sir Robert Berkley then being one of the Justices of the Court of Kings
Bench, in Trinity Term last, then sitting on the Bench in the said Court, upon
debate of the said case, between the said Chambers and Sir Edward Bromfield,
said openly in the Court, that there was a rule of Law, and a rule of
government: And that many things which might not be done by the rule of Law,
might be done by the rule of government: and would not suffer the point of
legalitie of Ship Money to be argued by the said Chambers his Council; all
which opinions, declarations, words and speeches, contained in the third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth Articles, are destructive to the
fundamental Laws of this Realm, the Subjects right of property, and contrary
to former resolutions in Parliament, and to the petition of right: which
resolution in Parliament, and petition of right were well known to him, and
resolved, and enacted, when he was the Kings Sergeant at law, and attendant in
the Lords house of Parliament.

9. That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Judges of the
Court of Kings Bench, and being in commission of the Peace, and duly sworn to
execute the office of a Justice of Peace in the County of Hertford, on or
about the seventh of January, 1638. at which time the general Sessions of the
Peace for the said County were there holden: The said Sir Robert Berkley, then
and there sitting on the Bench, did revile and threaten the grand Jurie
returned to serve at the said Sessions, for presenting the removal of the
communion Table in All Saints Church in Hertford aforesaid out of the place
where it anciently and usually stood, and setting it Altar-waies, against the
Laws of this Realm, in that Case made and provided, as an innovation in
matters concerning the Church; the said grand Jurie having dilivered to them in
charge at the said Sessions, by Master Sergeant Atkins a Justice of the Peace
of the said County of Hertford, that by the oath they had taken, they were
bound to present all innovations concerning Church matters. And he the said Sir
Robert Berkley compelled the foreman of the Jurie, to tell him who gave him
any such information, and thereby knowing it to be one Henry Brown, one of the
said grand Jurie, he asked the said Brown how he durst meddle with Church
matters; who affirming that in the said charge from Master Sergeant Atkins, the
said Jurie was charged to do; he the said Sir Robert Berkley told the said
Brown, he should therefore find suerties for the good behavior: and that he
the said Sir Robert Berkley would set a great fine on his head, to make him an
example to others; and thereupon the said Brown offered sufficient bail, but
he the said Sir Robert Barkley, being incensed against him refused the said
bail, and committed the said Brown to prison, where he lay in Irons till the
next morning, and used to the said Brown and the rest of the Jurors many other
reviling and terrifying speeches; And said he knew no Law for the said
presentment, and told the said Brown that he had sinned in the said
presentment: And he compelled the said grand Jurors to say they were forty for
what they had done in that presentment; and did bid them to trample the said
presentment under their feet, and caused Brown to tear the said presentment
in his sight. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley, when as John Houland, and
Ralph Pemberton, late Mayor of Saint Albons, came to desire his opinion on
several Indictments against John Brown Parson of Saint Albons, and Anthony
Smith Vicar of Saint Peter's in Saint Albons, at the quatter Sessions held at
the said town of Saint Albons, on the four and twentieth of June, 1639. for
the removal of the Communion Table out of the usual place, and not
administering the Sacrament according to Law in that Case provided. He the said
Sir Robert Berkley then told them that such an Indictment was before him at
Hertford, and that he quashed the same, and imprisoned the Promoters; by which
threatening and reviling speeches, unjust actions and declarations, he so
terrified the Jurors in those parts, that they durst not present any
Innovations in the Church matters, to then great grief and trouble of their
consciences.

And whereas several Indictments; were preferred against John Brook Parson of
Yarmou^h, by John Ingram and John Carter, for refusing several times to
administer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to them without any lawful cause,
at the Assizes held at Norwich in (...) 1633. He the said Sir Robert Berkley
then being one of the Judges of the Assize, proceeded then to the trial on the
said Indictments; where the matter in issue being, that the said Brook^ refused
to administer the said Sacrament, because the said Ingram and Corter would not
receive tickets with their Sir names before their Christen names, which was a
course never used amongst them but by the said Brook. He the said Sir Robert
Berkley did then much discourage the said Ingrams Counsel, and over rule the
cause for matter of Law, so as the Jury never went from the Bar, but there
found for the said Brook. And the said Sir Robert Berkley bound the said
Ingram to the good behavior for the prosecuting the said Indictments, and
ordered him to pay costs to the said Brook for wrongfully inditing him. And
whereas the said Carter, not expecting the trial at the same Assizes he
preferred his Indictment, was then absent, whereupon the said Sir Robert
Berkley did cause to be entered upon the said Indictment, a v^^at quia non
sufficiens in lege, and ordered an Attachment against the said Carter, which
said proceedings against the said Ingram and Carter, by the said Sir Robert
Berkley, were contrary to Law and Justice, and to his own knowledge.

10. That the said Sir Robert Berkley, being one of the Justices of the Court
of Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid, in Trinity term 1637. deferred
to discharge or bail Alexender Jenings prisoner in the Fleet, brought by
Habeas Corpus to the Bar of the said Court, the return of his Commitment being
that he was committed by two several warrants from the Lords of the Council,
dated the fifth of November, 1636. the first being only read in Court expressing
no cause, the other for not paying Messengers fees; and until he should bring
a certificate that he had paid his Assessement for Ship money in the County of
Bucks, but remitted him: And in Michaelmas Term after, the said Jenings being
brought by another Habeas Corpus before him as aforesaid, and the same
returned; yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, refused to discharge or bail
him, but remitted him. And in Easter Term, after several rules were given for
his Majesty's Council to show cause why the said Jenings should not be bailed,
a fourth rule was made for the said Jenings, to let his Majesty's Attorney
general have notice thereof, and notice was given accordingly; and the said
Jenings by another Habeas Corpus, brought to the Bar in Trinity Term after,
and the same return with this addition of a new Commitment of the fourth of
May, suggesting he the said Jenings had used diverse scandalous words in
derogation and disparagement of his Majesty's government: He the said Ienings
after several rules in the end of the said Trinity Term, was again remitted
to prison. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley did on the fifth of June last,
defer to grant his Majesty's writs of Habaas Corpus for William P^rgiter and
Samuel Danvers, Esquires, Prifoners in the Gate house, and in the Fleet: And
afterward having granted the said writ of Habeas Corpus, the said Pargiter and
Danvers were on the eight of June last brought to the Bar of the said Court,
where the returns of their Commitments were several warrants from the Lords
of the Council, not expressing any cause; yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley,
then sitting in the said Court, deferred to bail the said Pargiter and
Danvers, and the eighteenth of June last, made a rule for a new return to be
received, which were returned the 25. of June last, in haec verba:

Whereas his Majesty finding that his Subjects of Scotland, have in rebellious
and hostile manner assembled themselves together, and intend not only to shake
off their obedience unto his Majesty, but also as enemies to invade and infest
this his Kingdom of England to the danger of his Royal Person, etc.

For prevention whereof, his Majesty has by the advice of his Councell-board,
given special commandment to all the Lord Lieutenants of all the Counties of
this Realm, appointed for their Randezvouz, in their several and respective
Counties, there to be conducted and drawn together into a body for this
service. And whereas his Majesty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this
realm, and the constant custom of his Prodecessours, Kings and Queens of
this Realm, has power for the defense of this kingdom, and resisting the
force of the Enemies thereof, to grant forth Commissions under his great Seal
to such fit persons as he shall make choice of, to array and arm the Subjects
of this kingdom, and to compel those who are of able body, and of able
estates, to arm themselves; and such as should not be able of bodies, but of
ability in estate, to assesse them according to their estates, to contribute
toward the charge of arraying and arming others being able of body, and not
able in estate to arm themselves. And such persons as should be contrariant to
commit to prison, there to remain until the King should take further order
therein.

And whereas the Earl of Exeter, by virtue of his Majesty's Commission to him
directed, for the arraying and arming of a certain number of persons in the
County of Northampton, has assest William Pargiter being a man unfit of body
for that service, but being of estate and ability fit to contribute amongst
others, to pay the sum of five shillings toward the arraying and arming of
others of able bodies, and wanting ability to array and arm themselves.

And whereas we have received information from the said Earl, that the said
William Fargiter has not only in a wilful and disobedient manner refused to
pay the said money assessed upon him toward so important a service, to the
disturbance and hinderance of the necessary defense of this kingdom; but also
by his ill example has misled many others, and, as we have just cause to
believe, has practiced to seduce others from that ready obedience which they
owe, and would otherwise have yielded to his Majesty's just command, for the
public defense of his person and kingdom; which we purpose with all
convenient speed to enquire further of and examine.

These are therefore to will and require you, to take into your custody the
persons of the said Willam Pargiter, and Samuel Danvers; and them safely to
keep prisoners till further order from this Board, or until by due course of
Law they shall be delivered: Yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, being
desired to bail the said Pargiter and Danvers, remitted them, where they
remained prisoners till the ninth of November last, or thereabouts, although
the said Ienings, Pargiter, and Danvers, on all and every the said returns,
were clearcly baileable by Law; and the council of the said Ienings, Pargiter,
and Danvers offered in Court very sufficient bail. And he the said Sir Robert
Berkley being one of the Justices of the Court of the Kings Bench, denied to
grant his Majesty's writs of Habtas Corpus to very many others his Majesty's
subjects; and when he had granted the said writs of Habeas Corpus to very many
others his Majesty's subjects, and on the return no cause appeared, or such
only as was clearly baileable by Law; yet he remanded them, where they
remained prisoners very long; which said deferring to grant the said writs of
Habeas Corpus, and refusals, and delays to discharge prisoners, or suffer them
to be bailed, contained in this Article, are destructive to the fundamental
Laws of this Realm, and contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and to
the petition of Right; which said resolutions and petition of Right were well
known to him the said Sir Rebert Berkley, and were resolved on and enacted,
when he was the Kings Sergeant at Law, and Attendant in the Lords House in
Parliament.

11. That whereas there was a cause depending in the Court Christian at
Norwich, between Samuel Booty Clerk, and (...) Collard for two shillings in
the pound, for tithes for rents and houses in Norwich, and the said Collard
moved by his Council in the Court of Kings Bench for a prohibition to stay
proceedings in the Court Christian at Norwich, and delivered into the said
Court of Kings Bench his suggestions, that the said cause in the said Court
Christian was only for tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, which was
determinable by the Common Law only: yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, being
one of the Justices of the said Court of Kings Bench, and sitting in the said
Court, deferring to grant a prohibition to the said Court Christian in the said
cause, although the Council did move in the said Court many several times, and
several terms for a prohibition: And he the said Sir Robert Berkley deferred
to grant his Majesty's writ of prohibition, to several other Courts on the
motions of diverse others of his Majesty's subjects, where the same by the Laws
of this Realm ought to have been granted, contrary to the Laws of this
Realm, and his own knowledge.

All which words, opinions, and actions, were so spoken and done by him the
said Sir Robert Berkley traitorously and wickedly to alienate the hearts of his
Majesty's liege people from his Majesty, and to set a division betwixt them,
and to subvert the fundamental Laws and established government of his
Majesty's Realm of England: For which they do impeach him the said Sir Rebert
Berkley one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, of high treason
against our Sovereign Lord the King his Crown and dignity, and of the
misdemeanors above mentioned.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the liberties
of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment
against the said Sir Robert Berkley, and also of replying to the answer, that
he the said Sir Robert Berkley shall make to the said Articles, or any of them,
or of offering proof of the premises, or any other impeachments or accusations
that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall according to the course of
Parliaments require, do pray that the said Sir Robert Berkley, one of the
Justices of the Court of Kings Bench may be put to answer to all and every the
premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trialls, judgments, and
executions, may be upon every of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law and
Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir John Bramston Knight, Lord chief Justice of
the Court of Kings Bench, impeaching him as follows.
1. THAT the said Sir John Bramston, then being Lord Chief Justice of the
Court of Kings Bench, and having taken an oath for the due administration of
Justice to his Majesty's Liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm, did, on or about the last of November, 1635. subscribe his name to
an opinion, in haec verba: [I am of opinion, that as where the benefit does
more peculicaly redound to the good of the Ports, or Maritime parts (as in case
of Pyracy or Depredations upon the Seas) there the charge has been, and may
be lawfully imposed upon them, according to presidents of former times; so
where the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole Kingdom in danger (of which his Majesty is the only Judge) there the
charge of the defense ought to be borne by all the Realm in general: this I
hold agreeable both to Law and Reason]

2. That he the said Sir John Bramston, then being Lord chief Justice of the
Court of Kings Bench, about the Month of February, 1635. did subscribe an
extrajudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty,
which letter, questions and answers follow, in haec verba;

Charles R.

When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole Kingdom in danger, whether may not the King by writ under the great
Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this Kingdom, at their charge to
provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual, and Munition; and
for such time as he shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril; and by Law compel the doing thereof in
case of refusal, or refractorinesse? And whether in such case is not the King
the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when and how the same is to be
prevented and avoided?

C. R.


May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question assigned by your
Majesty, and enclosed in your Royal Letter: And we are of opinion, that when
the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole
Kingdom in danger, your Majesty may by writ under the great Sealt of England,
command all the Subjects of this your Kingdom, at their charge, to provide and
furnish such number of Ships, with Men, Victual, and Munition; and for such
time as your Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril: And that by Law your Majesty may compel
the doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse. And we are also of
opinion, that in such case, your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger,
and when, and how the same is to be prevented and avoided.

Which said opinions contained in the first and second Articles, are
destructive to the fundamental Laws of this Realm, the subjects right of
property, and contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and to the petition
of Right.

3. That he the said Sir John Brampston, then Lord chief Justice of the Court
of Kings Bench, about Trinity Term, 1637. refused to bail or discharge
Alexander Iennings, prisoner in the Fleet, brought by habeas Corpus to the
bar before him, the return of this Commitment being two several warrants
from the Lords of the Council, dated the fifth of November 1635. the first
expressing no cause, the other for not paying Messengers fees; and until he
should bring certificate that he had paid his Assesment for ship money in the
County of Bucks: And the said Sir John Brampston, the first warrant being only
read, then said, The cause of his Commitment did not appear; and that it was
not fit for every Jailer to be made acquainted by the Lords of the Council,
why they committed, and therefore remitted him. And in Michaelmas Term after,
the said Iennings being brought by another habeas Corpus, as aforesaid, and the
same returned, yet he the said Sir John Brampston, refused to discharge or
bail him, but remitted him. And in Easter Term next, after several rules
for his Majesty's Council to show cause why he the said Iennings should not
be bailed, a fourth rule was made for the said Iennings, to let his Majesty's
Attorney have notice, which notice was given accordingly, yet he remitted him.
And the said Iennings by another habeas Corpus brought to the Bar, as
aforesaid, in Trinity Term after, and the same return with the addition of a
new Commitment of the fourth of May, 1638. suggested, that he the said Iennings
had used diverse scandalous words in derogation and disparagement of his
Majesty's government: After several rules, in the end of the said Trinity
Term, he again remitted him to prison. And he the said Sir John Brampston,
about the 9. of July after, at his chamber in Sergeants Inn, being desired by
Master Me^wtis one of the Clerks of the Councell-boord, to discharge the said
Iennings, for that he the said Iennings had entered into a bond of one-thousand
pounds, to appear before the Lords of the Council the next Michaelmas Term
after, and to attend de die in diem; yet the said Sir John Brampston refused to
discharge the said Iennings until he entered into Recognizance to appear the
next Term, and in the mean time to be of his good behavior. And the said
Iennings was continued on his said Recognizance till Easter Term after. And
the said Sir. John Brampston did on the fifth of June 1640. defer to grant
his Majesty's writ of habeas Corpus for Samuel Danvers, and William Pargiter
Esquites, prisoner^ in the Gate house, and in the Eleet; and when he had
granted the said Writ, the said eight of June after the return, being the
order of the Council Table, not expressing any cause, he the said Sir John
Bramston deferred to bail the said Pargiter. And the eighteenth of June after,
made a rule for a new return to be received, which was returned the five and
twentieth of the said June, in haec verba:

Whereas his Majesty finding that his Subjects of Scotland, have in rebellious
and hostile manner assembled themselves together, and intend not only to shake
off their obedience unto his Majesty, but also as enemies to ^avade and infest
this his Kingdom of England to the danger of his Royal Person, etc.

For prevention whereof, his Majesty has by the advice of his Councell-board,
given special commandment to all the Lord Lieutenants of all the Counties of
his Realm, with expedition to array and arm a certain number of able men in
each County, to be prepared ready to be condacted to such places as should be
appointed for their Randezvouz, in their several and respective Counties,
there to be conducted and drawn together into a body for this service. And
whereas his Majesty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this realm, and
the constant custom of his Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm,
has power for the defense of this kingdom, and resisting the force of the
Enemies thereof, to grant forth Commissions under his great Seal to such fit
persons as he shall make choice of, to array and arm the Subjects of this
kingdom, and to compel those who are of able boly, and of able estates, to
arm themselves; and such as should not be able of bodies, but of ability in
estate, to assesse them according to their estates, to contribute toward the
charge of arraying and arming others being able of body, and not able in estate
to arm themselves. And such persons as should be contrariant to commit to
prison, there to remain until the King should take further order therein.

And whereas the Earl of Exeter, by virtue of his Majesty's Commission to him
directed, for the arraying and arming of a certain number of persons in the
County of Northampton, has assest William Pargiter being a man unfit of body
for that service, but being of estate and ability fit to contribute amongst
others, to pay the sum of five shillings toward the arraying and arming of
others of able bodies, and wanting ability to array and arm themselves.

And whereas we have received information from the said Earl, that the said
William Pargiter has not only in a wilful and disobedient manner refused to
pay the said money assessed upon him toward so important a service, to the
disturbance and hinderance of the necessary defense of this kingdom; but also
by his ill example has misled many others, and, as we have just cause to
believe, has practiced to seduce others from that ready obedience which they
owe, and would otherwise have yielded to his Majesty's just command, for the
public defense of his person and kingdom; which we purpose with all
convenient speed to enquire further of and examine.

These are therefore to will and require you, to take into your custody, the
person of the said Willam Pargiter, and him safely to keep prisoner till
further order from this Board, or until by due course of Law he shall be
delivered: (And the like return was then made in all things, mutatis mutandis,
concerning the said Danvers for not paying a sum of money assessed upon him)
Yet he the said Sir John Bramston deferred to bail the said Danvers, and
Pargiter, but remitted the said Danvers to the Fleet, where he remained till
the 12. of July 1640. and the said Pargiter to the Gate House, where he
remained till the ninth of November last, although the said Ienings, Danvers,
and Pargiter, upon all and every the said returns, ought to have been
discharged or bailed by Law; and the Council of the said Ienings, Danvers, and
Pargiter, offered in Court very sufficient bail.

And he the said Sir John Brampston being chief Justice of the Court of Kings
Bench, denied to grant his Majesty's Writ of Habeas Corpus to very many others
his Majesty's subjects; and when he had granted the said writs of Habeas
Corpus to very many others his Majesty's subjects, and on the return no cause
appeared, or such cause only as was clearly baileable by Law; yet he remanded
them, where they remained prisoners very long; which said deferring to grant
the said writs of Habeas Corpus, and refusals, and delays to discharge
prisoners, or suffer them to be bailed, contained in in this Article, are
destructive to the fundamental Laws of this Realm, and contrary to former
resolutions in Parliament, and to the petition of Right; which said resolutions
and petition of Right were well known to him the sud Sir John Brampston.

4. That whereas there was a cause depending in the Court Christian at Norwich,
between Samul Booly Clerk, and (...) Collard for two shillings in the pound for
tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, and the said Collard moved by his
Council in the Court of Kings Bench for a prohibition to stay proceedings in
the Court Christian at Norwich, and delivered into the said Court of Kings
Bench his suggestions, that the said cause in the said Court Christian was for
tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, which was determinable by the Common Law
only; yet he the said Sir John Brampston, being chief Justice of the said
Court of Kings Bench, and sitting in the said Court, deferred to grant a
prohibition to the said Court Christian in the said cause, although the
Counsel did move in the said Court several times, and several terms for a
Prohibitions And he the said Sir John Bramston deferred to grant his Majesty's
writs of prohibition to several other Courts on the motions of diverse others
of his Majesty's subjects, where the same by Laws of this Realm ought to have
been granted, contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and his own knowledge.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the liberties
of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment
against the said Sir John Brampston, and also of replying to the answer that he
the said Sir John Brampston shall make unto the said Articles, or any of them,
or of offering proof of the premises, or any of their impeachments or
accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall (according to
the course of Parliaments) require, do pray that the said Sir John Brampston,
Lord chief Justice of the Court of Kings Bench, may be put to answer to all
and every the premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trials, and
judgments, may be upon every of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law and
Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Francis-Crawley Knight, one of the Justices of
his Majesty's Court of Common Pleas, impeaching him as follows.
1. THAT he about the month of November, Anno Dom. 1635. then being one of the
Justices of the Court of Common Pleas, and having taken an oath for the due
administration of Justice to his Majesty's liege people; according to the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed an opinion in haec verba: [I am of
opinion, that as where the benefit does more peculiarly redound to the good of
the Ports, or Maritime patts, (as in case of Piracie, or Depredations upon the
Seas, there the charge has been, and may be lawfully imposed upon them,
according to presidents of former times; so where the good and safety of the
Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in danger, (of which
his Majesty is the only Judge) there the charge of the defense ought to be
borne by all the Realm in general: This I hold agreeable both to Law and
Reason.]

2. That he in or about the Month of February, Ann. Dom. 1636. then being one
of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, subscribed an extrajudiciall
opinion, in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R.

When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole Kingdom in danger, whether may not the King by writ under the great
Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this Kingdom, at their charge,
to provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual, and Munition;
and for such time as he shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril? And by Law compel the doing thereof in
case of refusal, or refractorinesse? and whether in such case is not the King
the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when and how the same is to be
prevented and avoided?

C.R.


May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have according to your Majesty's
command, severally every man by himself, and all of as together, taken into
serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty, and
enclosed in your Royal Letter: And we are of opinion, that when the good and
safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may by writ under the great Seal of England, command all
the subjects of this your Kingdom, at their charge to provide and furnish such
number of Ships, with Men, Victual, and Munition; and for such time as your
Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the Kingdom from
such danger and peril; And that by Law your Majesty may compel the doing
thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are also of opinion
that in such case, your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger, and when
and how the same us to be prevented and avoided.

3. That he then being one of the Justices of the said Court of Common pleas,
delivered an opinion in the Exchequer Chamber against John Hampden Esquire, in
case of Ship Money; that he the said John Hampden upon the matter and substance
of the case, was chargeable with the money then in question (a copy of which
proceedings and judgment, the Commons of this present Parliament have already
delivered to your Lordshis.)

4. That he then being one of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas,
declared and published in the Exchequer Chamber, and Westminster Circuit, where
he went Judge, That the Kings Right to Ship Money was so inherent a Right in
the Crown, as an Act of Parliament could not take it away And with diverse
malicious speeches enveighed against, threatened and discountenanced such as
refused to pay Ship money: All which opinions and judgments contained in the
first, second, and third Articles are destructive to the fundamental Laws of
this Realm, the Subjects right of property, and contrary to former resolutions
in Parliament, and to the petition of Right, which said resolutions and
petitions of Right were well known to him.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the Liberties
of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or impeachment against
the said Sir Francis Crawley, and also of replying to the answer that he the
said Sir Francis Crawley shall make unto the said Articles, or any of them, or
of offering proof of the premises, or of any of their impeachments or
accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall according to the
course of Parliaments require, Do pray that the said Sir Francis Crawlty, one
of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, may be put to answer to all
and every the premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trials, and
judgments may be upon every one of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law
and Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Humphrey Davenport Knight, Lord chief Baron of
his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, impeaching him as follows.
THAT whereas in the month of October, in the fourth year of his Majesty's
reign, the Farmours and Officers of the Custom House, having seized great
quantities of Currants, being the goods of Samuel Vassal Merchant, and having
conveyed them into certain Store houses at the Custom House, and detained
them, because the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay an imposition of five
shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of the said Currants, pretended
to be due upon, and demanded by the said Farmours and Officers on his
Majesty's behalf for the said Currants, whereas no such imposition was due or
parable for the same; but the said imposition was and is against the Laws of
this Realm.

And whereas also in M^chaelmas Term, in the said fourth year of his
Majesty's reign, his Majesty's then Attorney general, exhibited an
information by English Bill in the Exchequer against the said Samuel Vassal,
setting forth that King James by his Letters Patents, dated tertio November. in
the second year of his reign, did command the said imposition of five
shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of Currants should be demanded
and received. And that his Majesty that now is, by his Letters Patents dated
the six and twentieth day of July, in the second year of his Reign, did, by
advice of his Privy Council, declare his will and pleasure to be, that
Subsidies, Customs and Impost should be levied in such manner as they were in
the time of King James; and the same, and the Farms thereof to continue until
it might receive a settling by Parliament, and commanded the levying and
receiving the same accordingly; and that the said Sam. Vassal before the said
first day of October. then last before the said information exhibited, did bring
into the port of London in ships four thousand six hundred thirty eight
hundred weight of Currants, Richard Carmarthen Surveyour (...) the said port of
London, the said first day of October. demanded of the said Samuel Vassal the
said Imposition of five shillings six pence for every hundred weight of the
said Currants, and that the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay the said
imposition, and unjustly detained it from the King: To which information the
said Samuel Vassal appeared, and pleaded the Statute of Magna Charta, and the
Statute of De Tallagio non concedendo, and that he was a Subject borne under
the Kings Allegiance, and a Merchant of London using that trade, and that the
said sum of five shillings six pence-upon every hundred weight of Currants,
was and is malum talentum, and not antiq^a seu recta consuetudo, and that it
was imposed without assent of Parliament: to which Plea the said Attorney
General demurred in Law, and the said Samuel Vassal joined in demurrer with
him; and when the said cause came to be argued, viz. in Trinity Term, in the
sixth year of his Majesty's Reign, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport being then
Lord chief Barron of his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, did contrary to
his oath, and contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and to the great
impoverishment of the said Samuel Vassal, publicly deny to hear the
Counsel of the said Samuel Vassal to argue for him, and said, that the case
of the said Samuel Vassal would fall under the same rule with the case of one
Bates, and therefore was already judged: and when the Council of the said
Samuel Vassal answering that they had nothing to do with Bates his Case, but
desired to argue for Master Vassal, the said Sir Humphrer Davenport replied,
that they knew the opinion of the Court, and should be heard no further, and
said, that the King was in possession, and that they (meaning the said Court of
Exchequer) would keep him in possession: And the said Sir Humphrey Davenport
shortly after did (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court
of Exchequer) imprison the said Samuel Vassal for not paying such sums of
money as were pretended by the said Officers of the Custom House, to be due to
his Majesty, and did delay the said Samuel Vassal from time to time, from
having restitution of his said goods, being often in Court moved thereto, with
intention to force the said Samuel Vassal to pay the said unlawful imposition,
and did also give his opinion and judgment upon the said Information for the
King, and against the said Samuel Vassal, and by several orders for that
purpose made, did continue the possession of the said goods in the King, and
the said Samuel Vassal could never obtain any restitution at all of his said
goods; whereas it was commanded to the Sheriff of the County of York, by Writ
under the Seal of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, dated the sixteenth day of
May, in the seventh year of his Majesty's Reign that now is, That he should
distraine James Maleverer Esquire, to appear before the Barons of his
Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, in the Octaves of the Holy Trinity then next
following, to make fine to the KING for his trespass and contempt in not
coming to the presence of the KING before the one and thirtieth day of
January, in the first year of his said Majesty's Reign, to take upon him the
order of Knighthood, according to the form of a Proclamation in that behalf
formerly made, at which day of the said Octaves of the Holy Trinity, the f^id
James Maleverer did appear, and pleaded to the said Writs, that although his
said Majesty, the said one and thirtieth day of January, and for three days
next before the said one and thirtieth day of January was resident and
remaining at his Palace at White Hall in the County of Middlesex, and that the
said James Malaeverer the said one and thirtieth day of January, and three
days next before the said one and thirtieth day of January, was resident and
remaining at Ancliffe in the said County of York, which is distant from the
said Palace of White Hall the space of one hundred and fourscore miles; and
that the said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth day of January
aforesaid, or at any time before, had no lands or rents in his own hands, or
in the hands of Feoffees, to his use, out of the said County of York, and that
that part of the said County of York which is nearest to the said Palace of
White hall, is distant from the said Palace of White Hall the space of one
hundred and thirty miles; and that no Proclamation by virtue of any Writ of
Proclamation, for the appearance of any persons whatsoever, to take the said
Order of Knighthood, was made in any part of the said County of York before
the thirtieth day of January in the said first year of his Majesty's Reign,
by reason whereof the said James Malaverer could not personally come to the
presence of his said Majesty to take the said Order of Knighthood before the
said one and thirtieth day of January in the said first year of his Majesty's
said Reign, yet the said James Maleverer for his fine in the premises did
humbly submit himself to the said Court, and demanded to be discharged of the
said issues returned and imposed upon him by reason of the premises; yet
notwithstanding the said Plea and submission of the said James Maleverer, and
after the same was made as aforesaid, and entered upon Record in his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, and the said Court moved for stay of the Process, and
discharge of the issues, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport being then Lord chief
Baron of the said Court of Exchequer, contrary to his oath, and contrary the
Laws of this Realm, and to the great impoverishing of the said James
Maleverer, did (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court)
refuse to impose any fine whatsoever upon the said James Maleverer, and told
him that the said Court had no power to fine him, and that he must compound
with certain Commissioners for that puropose appointed. And did farther order
and direct several other writs of Distringas, to issue forth of his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, under the Seal of the said Court, directed to the
several high Sheriffs of the said County of York, whereby the said Sheriffs
were commanded further to distraine the said James Maleverer to appear as
aforesaid; upon which said writs of Distringas, several great and excessive
issues were returned upon the lands of the said James Maleverer, amounting to
the sum of two thousand pounds, or thereabours; a great part whereof, the
said James Maleverer was enforced to pay; and in like manner the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court
of Exchequer) did order and direct such and the like unjust and undue
proceedings, and the said proceedings were had and made accordingly against
Thomas Moyser Esquire, and against several other persons his Majesty's
subjects in several parts of this Realm, to the utter undoing of many of them.

2. That a sentence of Degradation being given by the high Commissioners of the
Province of York, against Peter Smart, Clerk, one of the Prebends of the
Church of Durham, for a Sermon by him formerly preached against some
Innovations in the Church of Durham, a trial was afterward had, viz. in
August in the seventh year of his said Majesty's Reign, before the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport, Knight, then one of the Judges of Assizes and Nisi crius
for the County Palatine of Durham, concerning the Corpse of the Prebend of the
said Mr. Smart, which was then pretended to be void by the said sentence of
Degradation, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport contrary to his oath, and contrary
to the Laws of this Realm, and to the destruction of the said Master Smart,
upon reading the writ dehaeret co comburendo, did publicly on the Bench, in
the presence of diverse his Majesty's subjects then attending, declare his
opinion to be that the said Prebends place was void, and gave directions to
the Jury then at Bar to find accordingly: and being then informed that
although the said Master Smart had been dead or deprived, yet the profits of
his Prebend had been due to his Executors till the Michaelmas following, the
said Sir Numphrey Davenport then answered, that though the said Master Smart
was not dead, yet if he had had his desert, he had been dead long ago, for
he deserved to have been hanged for the said Sermon, and that he was as
wicked a man as any lived in the world; call him no more Master Smart, but
plain Smart. And when the said Jury had found against the said Mr Smart, the
said Sir H. Davenport, in scandal of his Majesty's Government and Justice, and
of the proceedings of his Majesty's Judges, did publicly as aforesaid speak
words to this effect; that the said Jury had well done, and that the said Smart
had no remedy save by appeal to the King; and there he should find but cold
comfort, for the King would not go against his own Prerogative, upon which
the Judges and high Commissioners did depend, and therefore would not contradict
one another Acts.

That the said Sir Humphrey Davenport about the Month of November, Anno Dom.
1635. then being Lord chief Baron of his Majesty's Court of exchequer, and
having taken an oath for the due administration of Justice to his Majesty's
Liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of that Realm, subscribed
his name to an opinion, in haec verba: [I am of opinion, that as where the
benefit does more particularly redound to the good of the Potts, or Maritime
parts (as in case of Pyracy or Depredations upon the Seas) there the charge
has been, and may be lawfully imposed upon them, according to presidents of
former times; so where the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is
concerned, and the whole Kingdom in danger (of which his Majesty is the only
Judge) there the charge of the defense ought to be borne by all the Realm in
general: this I hold agreeable both to Law and Reason.]

That in or about the Month of February Anno Dom: 1636. the said Sir Humphrey
Davenport, then being Lord chief Baron of the said Court of Exchequer,
subscribed an extrajudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a letter from
his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R.

When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole Kingdom in danger, whether may not the King by writ under the great
Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this Kingdom, at their charge to
provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual, and Munition; and
for such time as he shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril; and by Law compel the doing thereof in
case of refusal, or refractorinesse? And whether in such case is not the King
the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when and how the same is to be
prevented and avoided?

C. R.


May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question assigned by your
Majesty, and enclosed in your Royal Letter: And we are of opinion, that when
the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole
Kingdom in danger, your Majesty may by writ under the great Seal of England,
command all the Subjects of this your Kingdom, at their charge, to provide and
furnish such number of Ships, with Men, Victual, and Munition; and for such
time as your Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
Kingdom, from such danger and peril: And that by Law your Majesty may compel
the doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse. And we are also of
opinion, that in such case, your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger,
and when, and how the same is to be prevented and avoided.

That whereas an action of Battery was brought by one Richard Leg against
Robert Hoblins, to which the said Hoblins pleaded Justification de son assault
de mesme, and the said cause came to trial at the Assizes holden for the
County of Gloucester in Summer, 1636. before the said Sir Humphrey Davenport,
then one of the Justices of Assize and Nisiprius for that County: At the said
trial the said Robert Hoblins did begin to make proof of his said
Justification, and produced one Robert Tily a witness in the cause, who proved
upon oath, that the said Richard Leg did make the first assault upon the said
Robert Hoblins, and that the occasion thereof was, that the said Richard Leg,
and others, came upon the Lands then in possession of the said Hoblins, and did
take and drive away eighteen Cowes of the said Hoblins, pretending they had a
warrant from the Sheriff to distreine the same for forty shillings assessed
upon the said Hoblins, for Shipmoney: And when the said Hoblins (being present)
endeavored to hinder the said Leg, and others, from taking away his said
Cattle, the said Leg struck the said Hobilins with a staff, who after
defended himself: That upon the opening of the matter the said Sir Humphrey
Davenport, would not suffer the said Hoblins to produce any more witnesses on
his behalf (though the said Hoblins desired that other of his witnesses then
present, and sworn, might be heard) nor his Council to speak for him; but
being informed that the said Hoblins (when Ship Money was demanded of him)
answered, that he would not pay the same, because it was not granted by
Parliament, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport did then (openly in the hearing of
a great number of his Majesty's liege people then assembled, and attending the
Court) in great passion reprove the said Hollins, and told him that the King
was not to call a Parliament to give him satisfaction; and did then and there
also falsely and of purpose, to prevent his Majesty's loving subjects from the
due and ordinary course of Law, and contrary to his oath, and the Laws of the
Realine, publish, declare, and affirm, that it was adjudged by all the Judges
of England, that Ship Money was due to the King, and directed the Jury sworn
in that cause, to find a verdict for the said Richard Leg: And the said Jury
did accordingly, and gave him twenty pound damages. And the said Humphrey
Daverport did then also, without any cause, imprison the said Robert Hoblins,
and bound him to the good behavior.

That whereas in the month of April, Decimo sexto Caroli; the Officers of the
Custom House having seized a Ship of one Samuel Warner, laden with Tobacco,
being the goods of the said Warner, the Bulk of the said Ship not being broken,
and no information exhibited for the King, according to the course of the
Exchequer for any duty, the Barons were moved, that the said Ship might be
restored to the Proprietors, giving security to pay such duties as did belong
to the King; But upon the allegation of the Kings Attorney, that there needed
no information, because there was no penalty, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport,
being then Lord chief Baron of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together with
the rest of the then Barons of the said Court, did (contrary to his Oath, and
contrary to the Laws of this Realm) deny the restitution of the said Ship,
unless all the duties demanded by the Farmours of the Custom House were first
paid.

Hereupon the said Warner brought an action of Trover in the Office of Pleas in
the Exchequer, against the said Officers that seized his Ship and Goods:
Whereupon the Kings Attorney general exhibited an information by English Bill
in the Exchequer Chamber against the said Warner; setting forth, that Customs
and Subsidy. upon Merchandise, were a great part of the Kings revenne, and
payable to him: And that the said Ship was seized for non-payment of the
foresaid duties; notwithstanding the said Warner, then Proprietor, prosecuted
the Officers upon a suit at Law, and prays that he may answer the said
information before any further proceedings be had at Law.

Thereupon the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, together with the rest of the then
Barons of the said Court of Exchequer, ordered that the Proprietor moving for
the delivery of the said goods, should first answer to the Information: after
which the said Warner demurred to the said Information, in regard no title for
any certain duty was set forth by the Information, which demurrer yet remains
not overruled; but the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, with the said other
Barons, without overruling the demurter, ordered, because Warner had put in a
demurrer and not answered to the said Information, that he should not proceed
upon the action of Trover. The proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy by
Action at Law, sued forth a Replevin, and upon pre^ence of viewing the said
goods, caused them to be brought forth of a Cellar, hired by a Deputy to the
Farmours to that use; and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriffs
of London, by virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of
the taking, as aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the President
inrolls the case; the said Sir Hemphrey Davenport, with the said other Barons,
adjudged, that the said goods were not Replevisable, and granted an Injunction
to maintain possession of them as they were before.

And the said house of Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the
liberties of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Sir H. Davenport, and also of replying to the
answer that he the said Sr Humphrey Davenport, shall make unto the said
Articles, or any of them, or of offering proof of the premises, or any of
their impeachments or accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case
shall (according to the course of Parliaments) require, do pray that the said
Sir Hamphrey Davenport, Lord chief Baron of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer,
may be put to answer to all and every the premises; and that such
proceedings, examinations, trials and judgments, may be upon every of them had
and used, as is agreeable to Law and Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Thomas Trevor Knight, one of the Barons of his
Majesty's court of Exchequer, impeaching him as follows.
1. THat in or about November, 4. Car. diverse goods and merchandises (whereof
John Rolls, George Moore, and other Merchants of London were Proprietors) being
seized and conveyed into certain Storehouses at the Custom House, by Sir
John Worstenham, Abraham Dawes, and others the Farmors and Officers of the
Customs, and by them there detained; because the said Proprietors refused to
pay the Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, pretended to be due, and demanded by
the said Farmours and Officers on his Majesty's behalf for the said
Merchandises, whereas no such subsidy or duty of Tonnage or Poandage was due or
payable for the same, no Subsidy of Tonnage, and Poundage having been granted
by Parliament to his Majesty. The said John Rolls, and other the Proprietors of
the said goods, having by reason of such unlawful seizure and detainer, as
aforesaid, sued forth one or more writ or writs of Replevin, directed to the
Sheriffs of London (being the proper remedy provided by the Law to regaine the
possession of goods taken and withheld from the owners contrary to Law) the
said Sir Thomas Trevor Knight, then, and yet one of the Barons of his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, together with the rest of the then Barons of the said
Court, upon information to them given, that the said Proprietors, or some of
them, had sued forth, and did prosecute such writ, or writs of Replevin for the
delivery of the said goods, did order an Injunction under Seal of the said
Court to issue forth, directed to the Sheriffs of London, commanding them
thereby not to execute the said writ or writs of Replevin, or any like writ
thereafter to be sued forth by any person or persons for the delivery of any
goods in the like nature detained: And did declare and order publicly in the
said Court of Exchequer, that the said goods by Law were not Replevisable,
alleging for cause that the said goods were in the Kings own possession,
whereas the same did not judicially appear to them, and they did well know,
that the said goods were at that time in the possession of the Farmours and
Lessees of the said Customs, and no lawful cause to them appearing or
suggested of the taking and detaining of the said goods: which Injunction and
Declaration so granted and made, were and are against the Laws of the Realm,
and in subversion of the common right, and remedy of the Subject for regaining
the possession of his goods, being taken and withheld from him without
lawful cause.

That the Sheriffs of London for the time being served with the said
Injunction, did forbear to execute the said writ or writs, of Replevin: By
means whereof the said good, continued so detained as aforesaid, contrary to
Law, from the said month of November, until the month of June next following.

That the said Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons aforesaid, knowing the said
goods, to be unlawfully seized and detained for the pretended duties and
Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, whereas no such were payble by Law, did from
time to time delay the respective Proprietors from having restitution of their
said goods, being often in Court moved therein, with intention thereby to force
the said Proprietors (by wanting their goods, and the use thereof) to pay all
such sums as the said Officers of the Customs pretended to be due to his
Majesty.

That to the end aforesaid the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and the said other
Barons refused to accept of any security to be given by the said Proprietors,
upon restitution had of their goods, for payment of all such duties as should
to made appear to be made payable to his Majesty in such manner as the said
Barons should direct. That the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons
aforesaid, knowing that the said sums demanded on his Majesty's behalf, by
the said officers of the Customs not to be due by Law, did refuse to order
restitution of any part of those goods, (so detained as aforesaid) to the
Proprietors thereof, unless the said Proprietors would deposite all such
sums of money as the said Officers respectively demanded of them for
pretended duties to his Majesty; and the said Proprietors refufing to deposite
the said sums demanded, the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons
aforesaid, did order the said Officers, to detain double the value of the
sums by them demanded for pretended duties to his Majesty, and to restore the
residue: The said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the said Barons, then knowing
that the pretended sums demanded by the said Officers, were not by Law due or
payable to his Majesty.

2. That in or about January 4. Car. the said Officers having seized several
Merchandise of the goods of Richard Chambers Merchant, upon the pretenses
aforesaid, did detain the same; and the said Chambers prosecuting by plaint to
have his said goods replevied, tho said Sir Thomas Trevor, together with the
said other Barons, did in like manner, in the said Court of Exchequer, declare
the said Chambers his goods not to be replevisable, and enjoined the Sheriffs
of London to proceed no further therein, no cause to them appearing of such
seizure or detainer. And the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons of
the said Court, refused to order the delivery of the said Chambers his goods,
upon good security offered by him to pay all such sums as should be made
appear to be due, and for which the said goods were pretended to be detained,
and the said Barons being often moved in Court; therein, did refuse to order
restitution of any part of the said Chambers goods, until the 23. of November,
5. Carol, and then ordered that the said Officers should detain in their hands
double the value of the sums by them demanded, and restitution of the residue
to be made to the said Chambers, no cause of detaining any part of the said
goods to them in any wise appearing.

3. That whereas in the month of October, in the fourth year of his said
Majesty's reign, the Farmers and Officers of the Custom House having seized
great quantities of Currants, being the goods of Samuel Vassal merchant, and
having conveyed them into certain store houses at the Custom house and
detained them, because the said Samuel Vassal refased to pay an imposition of
five shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of the said currants
pretended to be due, and demanded by the said Farmours and Officers on his
Majesty's behalf for the said currants, whereas no such imposition was due or
payable for the same, but the said imposition was and is against the Laws of
this Realm.

And whereas also in Michaelmas Term, in the said fourth year of his
Majesty's reign, his Majesty's then Attorney General exhibited an information
by English Bill in the Exchiquer-chamber against the said Samuel Vassal,
setting forth that King James, by his Letters Patents dated the 3. of November
in the second year of his Reign, did command that the said imposition of 5.
s. 6. d. upon every hundred weight of Currants should be demanded and
received: And that his Majesty that now is, by his Letters Patents dated the
six and twentieth day of July, in the second year of his Reign, did, by advise
of his Privy Council, declare his will and pleasure to be, that Subsidies,
Customs, and imposts should be levied in such manner as they were levied in
the time of King James; and the same, and the Farmers thereof to continue
until it might receive a settling by Parliament, and commanded the levying and
receiving the same accordingly; and that the said Samuel Vassal before the
first day of October then last past before the said Information exhibited, did
bring into the port of London in ships, four thousand six hundred thirty eight
hundred weight of currants, and that Richard Car^iarthen, Surveyour in the said
port of London, the said first day of October, demanded of the said Samuel
Vassal the said impofition of five shillings six pence for every hundred
weight of the said currants, and that the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay
the said imposition, and unjustly detained it from the King: To which
Information the said Samuel Vassal: appeared, and pleaded the Statute of Magna
Charta, and the Statute of De Tallagio non concedendo, and that he was a
Subject born under the Kings Allegiance, and a Merchant of London using that
trade, and that the said sum of five shillings six pence upon every hundred
weight of Currants, was and is malum calnetum, and not antiqua seu recta
consuetudo, and that it was imposed without assent of Parliament: to which Plea
the said Attorney General demurred in Law, and the said Samuel Vassal joined
in demurrer with him.

That the said Sir Thomas Trevor, being then and yet one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together with the rest of the then Barons of the
said Court, knowing the said Currants to be unlawfully seized and detained for
the pretended duty of five shillings six pence imposition upon every hundred
weight of the said Currants (whereas no such imposition was payable by Law) did
from time to time delay the said Samuel Vassal from having restitution of his
said goods, being often in Court moved therein, with intention thereby to force
the said Samuel Vassal (by wanting the said goods, and the use thereof) to pay
all such sums as the said Officers of the Customs pretended to be due to his
Majesty, and imprisoned the said Samuel Vassal, because he refused to pay
such sums of money as were demanded of him for the said unlawful imposition,
and that in Trinity Term in the sixth year of his Majesty's reign, the said
case coming to be argued in open Court upon the demurrer, the said Sir Thomas
Trevor, contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and to
the great impoverishment of the said Samuel Vassal, did (together with the
rest of the then Barons of the said Court of Exchequer) give his opinion and
judgment upon the said information of the King, and against the said Samuel
Vassal, and by several Orders for that purpose, did continue the possession
of the said goods in the King, and the said Samuel Vassal could never obtain
any restitution at all of the said Currants.

4 Whereas it was commanded to the Sheriff of the County of York, by Writ
under the Seal of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, dated the sixteenth day of
May in the seventh year of his Majesty's Reign that now is, That he should
distraine James Maleverer Esquire, to appear before the Barons of his
Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, in the Octaves of the holy Trinity then next
following, to make fine to the King for his trespass and contempt in not
coming to the presence of the King before the 31. day of January in the first
year of his said Majesty's Reign, to take upon him the order of Knighthood,
according to the form of a Proclamation in the behalf formerly made; at which
day of the said Octaves of the holy Trinity the said James Maleverer did
appear, and pleaded-to the said writ, that although his said Majesty, the said
31. day of January, and for three days next before, that said 31. day of
January was resident and remaining at his Palace at White Hall in the County of
Middlesex, and that the said James Maleverer, the said one and thirtieth day of
January, and three days next before the said one and thirtieth day of January,
was resident and remaining at Ancliffe in the said County of Youke, which is
distant from the said Palace of White Hall the space of one hundred and four
score miles; and that the said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth day
of January aforesaid or at any time before, had no lands or rents in his own
hands, or lin the hands of Feoffees to his uses, out of the said County of
York, and that that part of the said County of York, which is nearest to the
said Palace of White Hall, the space of one hundred and thirty miles, and that
no Proclamation by virtue of any writ or Proclamation, for the appearance of
any persons whatsoever, to take the said order of Knighthood, was made in any
part of the said County of York before the thirtieth day of January in the
said first year of his Majesty's reign, by reason whereof the said James
Maleverer could not personally come to the presence of his said Majesty, to
take the said order of Knighthood, before the said one and thirtieth day of
January in the said first year of his said Majesty's reign, yet the said
James Maleverer for his fine in the premises, did humbly submit himself to the
said Court, and demanded to be discharged of the said issues, returned and
imposed upon him by reason of the premises; yet notwithsanding the said Plea
and submission of the said James Maleverer, and after the same was made as
aforesaid, and entered upon Record in his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, the
said Sir Thomas Trevor (being then one of the Barons of his Majesty's said
Court of Exchequer) contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws of th's
Realm, and to the great impoverishing of the said James Maleverer, did
(togeter with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court) refuse to impose
any fine whatsoever upon the said James Maleverer, and told him that the said
Court had no power to fine him, but that he might compound with certain
Commissioners for that purpose appointed. And did further order and direct
several other writs of D^stringas, to issue forth of his Majesty's said Court
of Exchequer under the Seal of the said Court, directed to the several high
Sheriffs of the said County of York, whereby the said Sheriffs were
commanded further to distraine the said James Maleverer to appear, as
aforesaid: upon which said writs of Distringas, several great and excessive
issues were returned upon the lands of the said James Maleverer, amounting to
the sum of two thousand pounds or thereabouts, a great part whereof, the said
Ianes Maleverer was enforced to pay; and in like manner the said Sir Thomas
Trevor. (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court of
Exchequer) did order and direct such and the like proceedings, and the said
proceedings were had and made accordingly against Thomas Moyser Esquire, and
against several other persons his Majesty's subjects in several parts of this
Kingdom, to the utter undoing of many of them.

5 That he the said Sir Thomas Trevor, about the month of November, Anno.
Domini, 1635. then being one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer,
and having taken an oath for the due administration of Justice to his Majesty's
liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed
his name to an opinion, in haec verba: I am of opinion, etc. ut suprain Baron
Davenports Charge, page 30.

6 That in or about the month of February, Anno Domini 1636. (then being one
of the Barons of the said Court of Exchequer) he subscribed an extrajudiciall

Charles R.

When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, etc. ut
supra loco citato, and subscribed ut prius.


7 That the said Sir Thomas Trevor (being then one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer) did deliver his opinion, and judgment in the
Exchequer chamber against John Hampden Esquire, in the case of Ship Money; That
he the said John Hampden upon the matter and substance of the case, was
chargeable with the money then in question: a copy of which proceedings and
judgment, the Commons in this present Parliament have already delivered to
your Lordshippes.

8. That whereas in the month of April, 16. Car. the Officers of the
Custom House having seized a Ship of one Samuel Warner's laden with Tobacco,
being the goods of the said Warner, the Bulk of the said ship not being
broken, and no information exhibited for the King, according to the course of
the Exchequer, for any duty, the Barons were moved that the said Ship might be
restored to the Proprietor, giving security to pay such duties as did belong to
the King; But upon the allegation of the Kings Attorney that there needed no
information, because there was no penalty, the said Sir Thomas Trevor, (being
then one of the Barons of his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, together with
the rest of the then Barons of the said Court) did (contrary to his oath, and
contrary to the Laws of this Realm) deny the restitution of the said Ship,
unless all the duties demanded by the Farmors of the Custom House were first
paid. Hereupon the said Warner brought an action of Trover in the office of
Pleas in the Exchequer against the said Officers that seized his Ship and
goods: whereupon the Kings Attorney general exhibited an information by
English Bill in the Exchequer chamber against the said Warner; setting forth,
that customs and Subsidies upon Merchandise were a great part of the Kings
revenue, and payable to him; and that the said Ship was seized for non-payment
of the aforesaid duties, notwithstanding the said Warner then Proprietor,
prosecuted the Officers upon a suit at Law, and prays that he may answer the
said Information before any further proceedings be had at Law: Thereup- the
said Sir Thomas Trevor, (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said
Court of Exchequer,) ordered, that the Proprietor moving for delivery of the
said goods, should first answer to the said Information; after which the said
Warner demurred to the said Information, in regard no title for any certain
duty was set forth by the Information, which demurrer yet remains not
overruled; but the said Sir- Thomas Trevor, with the said other Barons,
(without overruling the demurrer) ordered, (because Warner had put in a
demurrer and not answered to the said Information, that he should not proceed
upon the action of Trover. The Proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy by
action at Law, sued forth a Replevin, and (upon pretense of viewing the said
goods) caused them to be brought forth of a Cellar, hired by a deputy of the
Farmors to that use; and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriff
of London, by virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of
the taking, as aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the President,
inrolls his case; the said Sir Thomas Trevor, with the said other Barons,
adjudged, that the said goods were not Replevisable, and granted an Iniunction
to maintain the possession of them as they were before.

And the said house of Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the
liberties of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and also of replying to the
answer that he the said Sir Thomas Trevor shall make unto the said Articles, or
any of them, or of offering proof of the premises, or any of their impeachments
or accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the case shall (according to
the course of Parliaments) require, do pray that the said Sir Thomas Trevor,
one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, may be put to answer to
all and every the premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trials,
and judgments may be upon every of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law
and Justice.
