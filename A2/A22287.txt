By the King.
A Proclamation prohibiting interloping and disorderly trading to New England
in America.
AS it has ever been held a principal Office of Christian Kings, to seek by
all pious means the aduaucement of Christian Religion; so the consideration
thereof, has been a special motive unto Us, from time to time, as often as
cause has required, to further, by Our Royal authority, the good disposition
of any of Our well affected Subjects, that have a will to attempt the
discovering and planting in any parts of the World, as yet savage and
vnpossessed by the Subjects of any Christian Prince or State. And now for that,
by Gods sacred favor, there is likely to ensure great advancement of his
glory, Our Crown, and State, by reason of Our grant heretofore made to the
Counsel for the managing of the affairs of New England in America, being in
breadth from forty degrees of Northerly latitude from the Equinoctial line, to
forty eight degrees of the said Northerly latitude, and in length by all the
breadth aforesaid, thorowout the maine land from Sea to Sea; We cannot but
continue Our speticall respect and favor unto them in their endeavors, and
exercise Our Royal authority against the hinderers thereof. Wherefore, having
receined certain information of many and intolerable abused offered by sundry
interlopers, irregular and disobedient persons, that seeking principally their
present and private profits, have not only impeached some of the Planters
there, of their lawful possessions, but also taken from them their Limber
without giving any satisfaction, as in justice they ought to have done: and not
there with contented, have rined whole woods to the utter ruin of the same for
ever after; as also, by casting of their ballast in the harbors of some of
their Islands, have almost made them unserviceable: And yet not so contented, by
their promiscuous trading, as well Mariners as Masters with the Savages, have
overthrown the trade and commerce that before was had, to the great profit of
the Planters, and which were in deed their principal hopes for the advancement
of that plantation, next unto the commodities that coast affords of Fishing:
Neither heerwith satisfied, but as if they resolved to omit nothing that might
be impious and intolerable, they did not forbear to barter a way to the
Savages, Swords, Pikes, Our kets, Fowling pieces, Match, Powder, Shot, and
other warlike weapons, and teach them the use thereof, not only to their own
present punishment (diverse of them being shortly after slain by the same
Savages, whom they had so taught, and with the same weapons which they had
furnished them withal) but also to the hazard of the lives of Our good
subjects already planted there, and (as much as in them lay) to the making of
the whole attempt it self (how pious and hopeful soever) frustrate, or so
much the more difficult. We, for reformation and prevention of these or the
like evils hereafter, and for the more clear declaration of Our Kingly
resolution and just intents, both to maintain Our Royal grant already made,
and to uphold and encourage by all ways and means the worthy dispositions of
the undertakers of those designs, have thought fit, and do heerby straightly
charge and command, That none of Our Subjects whatsoever, (not Adventurers,
Inhabitors or Planters in New England) presume from henceforth to frequent
those Coasts, to trade or traffic with those people, or to intermedle in the
woods or freehold of any the Planters or Inhabitants (otherwise then by the
license of the said Counsel, or according to the orders established by Our
Privy Counsel for the relief or ease of the transportation of the Colony in
Virginia) upon pain of Our high indignation, and the confiscation, penalties
and for feitures in Our said Royal grant expressed: Leaving it nevertheless,
in the mean time, to the discretion of the said Counsel for New England, to
proceed against the foresaid offenders according to the same, especially,
seeing We find the arms of the said Counsel to be open to receive into that
plantation any of Our loving Subjects, who are willing to join with them in
the charge, and participate in the profits thereof.

Given at Our Court at Theobald, the sixth day of November, in the year of Our
Reign of England, France, and Ireland, the twentieth, and of Scotland the six
and fiftieth.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXII.
