TRusty and wel-beloued We greet you well:
Whereas We have been already pleased at the humble suit of the Mayor and
Citizens of our City of Lincoln, to grant unto them license, as well by our
Letters Patents under our great Seal of England, as by our special Letters
under our Sign Manual, to levy moneys by way of Collections, in sundry our
Shires, for the scowring and making navigable of an ancient watercourse called
Fosse Dike, near unto our said City, whereby trade and co^merce may be drawn
to our said poor decayed City to the enriching thereof, and of all the parts
thereunto adjoining. Whereupon some of those Counties, and particular persons
unto whom we addressed our Letters, have (to our great contentment) freely and
liberally contributed thereunto. Forasmuch as the work is now well advanced,
and that the moneys already collected (though carefully managed and employed to
the best advantage) will nothing near counteruaile the charge thereof, as we
are informed by our right trusty and right wel-beloued Cosen the Earl of
Rutland, and diverse other personages of qualite of those parts. We having ever
been pleased to vouchsafe our Princely furtherance to public works, and more
especially to this, to which we gave beginning, and therefore cannot now but
cherish the Progress, and much tender the perfection thereof, have thought good
to direct these our special Letters to you and every of you respectively,
requiring you that at the next Assizes to be held within your several Circuits
in our several Counties, you our Justices of Assize do deal effectually with
the High Sheriffs and Justices of the Peace in each our said Counties, not
only themselves to contribute liberally to so worthy a work, but by their
examples and best endeauours to excite the Gentry and all other loving Subjects
throughout all Cities, Corporations, privileged and other places within our
said several Counties, freely to extend their bounty to the finishing o^ the
same. And further our pleasure is, because we would have you put a difference
between these our Letters Patents which this bearer will show you, and such
Briefes as are ordinarily granted for loss by fire and other casualties, that
you our High Sheriffs and Justices of the Peace of the said several Counties,
do not only take such course as in your discretions you shall think fit for
the raising of those moneys to some proportion answerable to our expectation,
and the greatness of the work, but also give order to all the Constables,
Headboroughs, and other our inferior Officers and Ministers in your Precincts,
for ^he speedy leuying of the said contributions to the best ease and benefit
of the said Citizens; And likewise that the money so leuyed, be delivered to
Robert Morecroft Alderman of our City of Lincoln, or his Deputy or Deputies,
of whom we expect particular account of the same. And lastly, we expect your
and every of your best care and diligence in this business, the success
whereof we much affect, and will not fail to retain a gracious remembrance of
what futherance soever we shall understand you have given it.

JAMES, By the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials: Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons: And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens,
and Headboroughs: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughs, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties as without, to whom these presents shall
come, greeting.
WHEREAS We have heertofore been truly certified as well by diverse Petitions
exhibited unto Us by our true and Loyal Subjects the Mayor and Citizens of our
poor decayed City of Lincoln, as also by a Certificate from our right trusty
and wel-beloued Cosen Francis Earl of Rutland, and diverse others Knights
Baronets, Knights, and Esquiors, Justices of the Peace within our County of
Lincoln: That it was a thing most needful, convenient and commodious, for to
open, scowre and cleanse the old Draine (...) called Fosse, first made by our
Noble Progenitor Henry the first, for the bringing of traffic and Merchandise
to our said City, the which now is stopped up and not nauigable for vesse;ls
of any burden, whereby our said City is much impouerished, ^^y^ated a decayed,
and become so poor for want of trading there again, as unless the same be
forthwith restored and continued, that ancient City in short time is like to
be utterly subverted and overthrown. Upon consideration whereof, we did
heertofore in our Princely care for the good of our said City and futherance
of this worthy and commendable act, give order to the Lords of our Privy
Counsel to send their Letters to the Nobility and Gentry of our said County of
Lincoln, for the collecting and gathering of such sums of money within the
said County as then was thought fit, toward the opening and scowring of the
said Draine, but finding the charge of the work to be far greater then could
be raised in that manner, the same being estimated by men experienced in
those affairs, to amount to the Sum of Three Thousand Pounds, We then sent
our own Letters under our Privy Signet, to the Nobility and Gentry within our
Counties of York, and Nottingham, for like contrbution to be made on this
behalf: After all which the said City being in ye way of our Progress
toward Scotland, Our self was an Eyewitness of the ruynes and decays
thereof, and being then more fully informed and assured of the undoubted benefit
which by this good work was likely to redound, as well to the City and
Counties neerunto adjoining, as also to the public good of the Commonwealth,
We were then graciously pleased upon further Petition made unto Us, to grant
our Letters Patents under our great Seal of England, dated the Twelueth day of
July in the fifteenth year of our Reign of England, etc. for a Collection to
be made within Eight Counties of this our Realm, with special request and
desire to all Archbishops, Earls, Bishops, Barons, Baronets, Knights, and
Gentlemen, not only themselves to be bountiful and liberal in their
contributions, but also to the uttermost of their power to move all other
eurlouing subjects according to their ability to do the like. NOW for as much
as we have been lately certified as well by a Certificate from our foresaid
right trusty and wel-beloued Cosen Francis Earl of Rutland, as also by another
Certificate from diverse Justices of Peace near unto our foresaid City of
Lincoln, that the Citizens there have of themselves to the uttermost of their
ability, with the help of the foresaid contributions (wherewith We were much
contented) disbursed about this good work the Sum of One Thousand Marks, which
has well advanced the same and brought it into a good forwardnes, yet We are
informed that unless some further course be forthwith taken for present
supply of moneys to proceed therein, the foresaid work now stands at a stay
and must shortly perish, and the charge and cost already bestowed be utterly
lost, notwithstanding our great care and desire we have had from the beginning
of the prosperity of this business, to which we gave beginning, and cannot now
but much cherish and tender the progress and perfection thereof; And therefore
We have thought good not only to renew our foresaid Letters Patents for a
general Collection to be made throughout our Realm of England, where no
former Collection has been, but also to direct our Letters Sign Manual to
all our Judges of Assize, requiring them and every of them within their
several Circuits, as well to deal effectually with our high Sheriffs and
Justices of Peace; not only themselves to contriibute liberally herein, but by
their examples and best endeavors to excite the Gentry, and all other our
loving Subjects within any City, Town corporate, privileged or other places
whatsoever throughout our Realm of England, to extend their liberal
contribution in like manner toward the finishing of this good work. And also
to take further order yt Constables, Headboroughs and other inferior Officers
and Ministers within their precincts or Parishes, shall make speedy Collection
of every Inhabitant or other sufficient person within their Parish, and to
deliver the Sum and Sums of money so collected, unto our true and faithful
Subject Robert Morecroft Alderman of our said City of Lincoln, or his Deputy
or Deputies the bearer or bearers heerof of whom we expect a particular
Account. And We will and command all Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, for the
better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and
declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents, or Brief thereof, unto our
said Subjects, Exhorting and persuading them to extend their liberal
contributions in so good and charitable a work. And lastly We will you and
every of you that are appointed Collectors herein, that there be a sufficient
book kept by you, wherein you shall set down every particular Sum and Sums by
you collected of any Nobleman, Knight, or man of worth and quality, or in any
Church or civil society that give and contribute heereunto, whereby we may be
certified how much our said Subjects shall regard our pleasure and request in
this behalf. Any Statute, Law Ordinance, or provision heertofore made to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding. IN witness whereof, we have caused
these our Letters to be made Patents for the space of One whole year next
after the date heerof to endure.

Sixteenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland
