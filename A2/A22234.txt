By the King.
A Proclamation against Tenant-rights.
WHereas it has been oftentimes, by Decrees and Judgments at Law declared
and settled, That Tenant-rights, since the most happy Union of these two
renowned Kingdoms of England and Scotland in Our person, are utterly by the
ancient and fundamental rule of Law of this Our Kingdom of England,
extinguished and abolished, being but dependances of former separation and
hostility; And that there is the like settled Rule and constant practice in
Scotland since the Union; And yet nevertheless diverse Suits are continually
raised and prosecuted in Our Courts of Justice here in England, grounded upon
the said claim of Tenant-right, or Customarie estate of Inheritance, under
that pretense, whereby not only the memory of the said Tenant-right is
continued, which ought to be damned to a perpetual oblivion, but also both
parties do sustain needless charge, and impouerishment, in questioning of
that which is beyond all dispute; which may also (in regard of combination of
Tenants, and general Taxes, to pursue their Landlords upon a common purse)
open a way to turbulent and seditious attempts: We, out of Our Princely and
never intermitted care, to avoid these inconveniences aforesaid, Have both
recommended the matter to all Our Judges, to suppress and surcease strifes and
suits of this nature, And have also given express charge and commandment, to
all the principal Officers and Ministers of Our selves and Our dearest Son
the Prince, That in Our own Lands, and like wise in those of Our dear Son
the Prince (near or bordering upon Scotland where such Tenant-rights have
been claimed) they do let all Estates, whether for Lives of Years, be it for
Fine or improuement of Rent, by Indenture only, and not otherwise, To the end
to cease and discontinue the said Claim:

And further, to the end the same course may be uniform and general amongst
Our loving Subjects, We do by these Presents wish and expect from all Our
loving Subjects in those parts, that they shall follow and conform themselves
to the same example, for Leasing such Lands in manner aforesaid, But here
withal We do strictly command, That no Entry in any Court-Roll, hereafter,
either of Our own Honors or Mannours, or of the Princes, or of any of Our
Subjects, do mention any Estate termed of Tenant-right, or Customarie Estate,
pretended for Border-seruice; On the other side Our express pleasure is, That
good and dutiful Tenants, who shall willingly submit themselves to such
Estates, be used with all favor and moderation, which We doubt not but the
Landlords will do; Yet if any shall be found to do the contrary, Our Courts
of Equity shall ever be open and ready to overrule such Landlords, As on the
other side, both Our Courts of Law and Equity, shall be to bridle and eiect
all such unreasonable Tenants as shall withstand it.

Given at Our Court at Charlton the eight and twentieth day of July, in the
eighteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
