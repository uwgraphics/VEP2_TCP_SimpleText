Britains Honor.
In the two Valiant Welchmen, who fought against fifteen thousand Scots, at
their now coming to England passing over Tyne; whereof one was killed manfully
fighting against his foes, and the other being taken Prisoner, is now (upon
relaxation) come to York to his Majesty.

The tune is, How now Mars etc.

YOu noble Britains bold and hardy,
That justly are derived from Brute,
Who were in battle never found t rdy,
But still will fight for your repute;
against any he,
What ever a'be,
Now sor your credit list to me,
Two Welchmens valor you shall see.
There two undaunted Trojan worthies,
(Who prized honor more then life,)
With Royal Charles, who in the North is,
To salve (with care) the ulcerous strife;
Which frantic sots,
With conscious spots,
Bring on their souls; these two hat shots,
Withstood full fifteen thousand Scots.
The manner how shall be related,
That all who are King Charles his friends
May be with courage animated,
Unto such honorable ends;
These cavaliers,
Both Musketeers,
Could never be possess with fears,
Though the Scots Army nigh appearee.
Within their works near Tyne entrenched
Some of our Sovereigns forces lay;
When the Scots Army came, they flinched,
And on good cause retired away;
Yet blame them not,
For why the Scot,
Was five to one, and came so hot,
Nothing by staying could be got.
Yet these two Martialisto so famous,
One to another thus did say;
Report hereafter shall not shame us,
Let Welchmen scorn to run away;
Now for our King.
Let Us do a th^^g
Whereof the world shall loudly ring
Unto the grace of our offspring.
The vaunting Scot shall know what valor,
Does in a Britains breast reside;
They shall not bring us any dolor;
But first we will tame some of their pride.
What though we die,
Both thee and I?
Yet this we know assuredly,
In life and death there is victory.
