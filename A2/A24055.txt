In Anno Septimo of the King, there was one entire Subsedie granted by the
Laiety throughout all England, for which was paid into the Receipt of the
Exchequer, by the Collectors thereof, the Sum of 69666 l. and so by estimation,
a subsedie is so valued, which for more particularity is here distinguished as
it is Collected in each several Shire of England, and as each Shire pays,
viz.

l. Berk. 963 Buck. 1526 Bed. 721 Cantabr. 1205 Cestria. 871 Cumberl. 516
Cornub. 1784 Dunolme. 61 Dorset 1239 Derb. 644 Devon. 5821 Essex 2653 Eboru.
4070 Glouc. 1748 Hertff. 1221 Hereff. 1105 Hunt. 553 Kancia 3042 Lanc. 978

980 Norff. 2840 Northumberl. 129 Oxon. 1109 Rutl. 174 Salop. 787 South. 2412
Staff. 681 Suff. 2824 Surr. 2286 Sussex 1705 Somerset 4249 Wigorn. 1178
Westminster 102 Wiltes 2240 War. 918 Of the Nobility 3180 Within the Kings
house 1101 Shires in Wales. Angliss. Bercon. Carnarvon. Carmarth. 101 Cardigan.
Denbigh. Flint Glamorgan Merioneth. 120 Mountgomery Pembroc. Radnor. 44 Total
of the whole Collection in England and Wales, amounts to 69666

The reason why most of these Welsh Shires stand with blancks is because they
pay no Subsedies, now they are charged with the Mizes, they pay unto the Prince
of Wales. And until this seventh year of the King, the Shires of
Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmerland, never paid any subsedie or
fifteenth, because they were at a Continual charge in defense of the Borders
against Scotland.

One xvth. and xth. of the Layety comes unto 36500 l.

Every City, Hundred, Town and Village pay in for Fifteenths and Tenths no more
then they are chargeable by the Ancient Roll and Tax set upon them, so that
their payments are certain.

the Towns of Ulushing and Brill, in recompense of the loss of their places
upon Surrender of the said Towns, to the Lords the States of the United
