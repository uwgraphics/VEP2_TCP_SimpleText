The Confession of FAITH.
FIRST, I believe, That nothing is without beginning but God, no Nature, no
Matter, no Spirit, no essence, but one only, and the same God: That God, as he
is Eternal, Almighty, only wise, only good in his Nature, so he is
Eternally Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in three persons.

I believe, that God is so holy, pure, and zealous, that it is impossible for
him to be pleased in any creature, though the work of his own hands, so that
neither Angel, Man, nor World could stand, or can stand one moment in his
eyes, without beholding the same in the face of a Mediator: And therefore that
before him with whom all things are present, the lamb of God was slain before
all worlds; without which eternal Counsel of God it was impossible for him to
have descended to any work of Creation, but should have enjoyed the blessed
and individual society of the three persons in the Godhead only for ever,
but that out of his eternal and infinite goodness and love, purposing to
become a Creator, and to communicate with his Creatures, that so in the person
of the Mediator, the true Ladder might be fixed, whereby God might descend to
his Creatures, and his Creatures might ascend to God; so that God by the
reconcilement of a Mediator, turning his Countenance toward his Creatures,
though not in the same height, and degree, made way unto the disposition of his
most holy and sacred will, whereby some of his Creatures might stand, and keep
their estates, others might fall, and be restored unto their estates, but yet
remain in being, though under wrath, and corruption, all in the virtue of a
Mediator, which is the great mystery, and perfect Center of all Gods ways
unto his Creatures, and unto which all his other Works and Wonders do but
serve and refer.

That he chose according to his pleasure man to be that Creature to whose
Nature the eternal Son of God should be united, and amongst the generations
of men he elected a small flock in whom by the participation of himself he
purposed to express the Rays of his Glory, all the ministration of Angels,
damnation of Devils and Reprobates, universal administration of all
Creatures, and dispensation of all times, have no other ends but as the ways
and Ambages of God to he further glorified in his saints who are one with the
Mediator, who is one with God.

That by the virtue of God his Eternal Counsel touching a Mediator, he
descended at his own good pleasure, and according to the times, and seasons to
himself best known to become a Creator, and by his eternal word created all
things, and by his eternal spirit does comfort, and preserve them.

That he made all things in their first estate good, and removed from himself
leaving the beginning of all evil, and vanity unto the liberty of the
creature, but reserving in himself the beginning of all restitution, and the
liberty of his Grace, using never thelesse, and turning the falling, and
defection of the Creature, which to his prescience was eternally known, to make
a way to his eternal Counsel touching a Mediator, and the work he purposed
to accomplish in him.

That God created Spirits, whereof some kept their standings, and others fell,
he created heaven, and earth, and all their Armies and Generations, and gave
unto them constant and everlasting laws, which we call nature which is nothing
but the laws of the Creation, which lawsneverthelesse have had three changes,
or times, and are to have their fourth and last.

The first, when the matter of Heaven and Earth was created without form.

The second by the Interim of every days work.

The third, by the curse which notwithstanding was no new Creation, but a
privation of part of the first Creation.

And the fourth and last, at the end of the world the manner whereof is not yet
revealed. So as the Laws of nature which now remain, and govern inviolably
till the end of the world began to be in force when God rested from his work,
and ceased to create, but received a revocation in part by the curse since
which time they change not.

That notwithstanding God has rested from creating since the first Sabbath,
yet nevertheless he does accomplish, and fulfill his divine will in all
things, great and small, general, and particular, as fully, and exactly by
providence as he could do by miracle, and new Creation, though his working be
not immediate, and direct, but by compass, not violating nature which is his
own Law upon his Creatures.

That as at the first the soul of man was not produced of heaven, or earth,
but was breathed immediately from God, so that the ways, and proceedings of God
with Spirits are not included in nature that is in the laws of heaven or
earth, but are reserved to the law of his secret will, and grace whereby God
works still, and rests not from the work of Creation, as he does from the
work of Redemption, but continues working to the end of the world, at what
time also that work shall be accomplished, and an eternal Sabbath shall ensue.

Likewise that whenever God does break the laws of nature by miracles (which
ever are new Creations) he never comes to that point, or pass, but he has
regard to the work of Redemption which is the greater, and whereunto all Gods
Saints and Martyrs do refer.

That God created man in his own Image, or likeness, in a reasonable soul in
innocence, and sovereignty, that he gave him a law and command which was in
his power to keep, but he kept it not.

That man made a total defection from God, presuming to imagine that the
laws, and prohibitions of God were not the rules of good, and evil, but that
good and evil had their principles, and beginnings, and lusted after the
knowledge of those imaginary beginnings to the end to depend no more upon Gods
will revealed, but upon himself and his own light as a God, then the which
there could not be a sin more opposite to the law of God.

That yet nevertheless this great sin was not originally moved by the malice
of man, but was insinuated by the Instigation, and suggestion of the Devil,
who was the first defected creature, and fell of malice, and not by temptation.

That upon the fall of man, death, and vanity entered by the Justice of God,
and the Image of God in man was defaced, and Heaven and Earth which were made
for man's use, were subdued to corruption by his fall, but then that instantly,
and without intermission of time after the word of gods law, because through the
fall of man frustrate as to obedience there succeeded the greater word of the
promise, that the righteousness of God might be made, and wrought by faith.

That as well the word of God as the word of his promise endure the same for
ever, but that they have been revealed in several manners according to the
dispensation of times, for the Law was first imprinted in that remnant of light
of nature which was left after the fall being sufficient to accuse, it was
more manifestly expressed in the written Laws, it was yet more opened by the
Prophets; And lastly expressed in the true perfection of the Son of God, the
great Prophet, and perfect Interpreter of the Law.

That likewise the word of the promise was manifested, and revealed first by
immediate Revelation and Inspiration, after by figures which were of two
natures, the one the rights and Ceremonies of the Law, the other the
continual histories of the old world, and Church of the Jews, which though it
be literally true, yet it is pregnant of a perpetual Allegory, and a shadow
of the work of Redemption, which was to follow, the same promise, or Evangell
was more clearly revealed, and expressed by the Prophets, than by the Son
himself, and lastly by the Holy Ghost, which illuminateth the CHVRCH to the
end of the world.

That in the fulness of time according to the promise, and oath of GOD, of a
chosen lineage descended the blessed seed of the Woman (Jesus Christ, the only
begotten Son of GOD) and Savior of the World, who was Conceived by the Power,
and overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, and tookflesh of the Virgin MARIE.

That the Word did not only take flesh, or was joined to flesh, though without
conconfusion of Substance, or Nature, so as the Eternal Son of God, and ever
blessed Son of Mary was one person, so one as the blessed Virgin may be
truly and Catholikely called Dei para, the Mother of GOD, so one, as there is
no unity in universal Nature, not that of the soul and body of man so
perfect, for the three Heavenly Unities, whereof that is the second, exceeds
all natural Unities, that is the unity of the three persons in the Godhead,
the Unity of God and Man in Christ, and the unity of Christ in the Church;
the Holy Ghost being the worker of both these latter unities: for by the Holy
Ghost was Christ regenerate in the flesh, and by the Holy Ghost is man
regenerate and quickened in the Spirit.

That JESUS, the Lord, became in the Flesh a Sacrificer, and a Sacrifice for
sin, a satisfaction and price to the justice of God, a Meriter of Glory, and
of the Kingdom, a pattern of all Righteousness, a Preacher of the Word,
which himself was a finisher of the Ceremonies, a Corner stone, to remove the
separation between Jew and Gentile; an Intercession for the Church; a Lord of
Nature in his Miracles: a Conqueror of death, and the power of Darkness in his
Resurrection, and that he fulfilled the whole Counsel of GOD performed his
whole sacred Office, and anointing upon Earth, and accomplished the whole work
of Redemption, and Restitution of man to a state superior to the Angels, where
the state of his Creation was inferior, and reconciled, and established all
things according to the will of the Father.

That in the fullness of time, JESUS the Lord was borne, in the days of Herod,
and suffered under the Government of Pontius Pilate, being Deputy of the
Romans, and under the High Priesthood of Caiphas, and was betrayed by Judas,
one of the twelve Apostles, and was Crucified at Jerusalem, and dyed after a
true and natural death, and His Body laid in the Sepulcher, the third day He
raised Himself from the Bonds of Death, and arose, and showed Himself to many
chosen Witnesses, by the space of diverse days; and in the end of those days
in the sight of many He ascended into Heaven, where He continues his
Intercession, and shall come in His appointed time in greatest Glory for to
judge the World.

That the sufferings and Merits of Christ as they are sufficient to do away
the sins of the whole World, so they are effectual to such as are Regenerate
by the Holy Ghost, who breaths where He lists of free Grace; which Grace,
as a Seed incorruptible, quickneth the spirit of Man, and conceives him a new
the son of GOD, and a member of CHRIST, so that CHRIST having Man's flesh, and
Man having CHRIST'S Spirit, there is an open passage, and Imputation whereby
sin and wrath is conveyed from Man to Christ; and Merit and Life is conveyed
from Christ to Man, which Seed of the Holy Ghost first figureth in us the Image
of CHRIST slain, or Crucified in us in a Holy Faith, and then renews in us
the Image of God in Holiness and Righteousness, though both imperfectly, and
in degrees far differing even in GODS Elect, as well in regard of the office
of the Spirit, as the Illumination, which is more or less in a large
proportion, as namely in the Church before CHRIST, which nevertheless was
partaker of one and the same salvation with us.

That the work of the Spirit, though it be not tied to any means in Heaven,
or in Earth, yet it is ordinarily dispensed by the preaching of the Word, and
administration of the Sacraments, the Covenants of the Fathers upon the
Children, Payers, Reading, the Censures of the Church, the society of the
godly, the cross and afflictions, Gods benefits, his judgments upon others,
his great Miracles, the Contemplation of his Creatures, all which (though some
be more principal) God uses as the means of Vocation and Conversion of his
Elect, not derogating from his power to call immediately by his grace, and at
all hours, and moments of the day, that is, of man's life, according to his
good pleasure.

That the Word of God, by which his Will is revealed, continued in revelation
and tradition, until Moses, and that the Scriptures were from Moses time
until the time of the Apostles, and Evangelists, in whose age, after the
coming of the Holy Ghost, the searcher of all trtuh, the Book of the
Scriptures is shut up, and closed, and cannot receive any new addition, and
that the Church has no power after the Scriptures to teach or command any
thing contrary to the written Word; but is as the Arc wherein the Tables of
the first Testament were kept and preserved; That is to say, the Church has
only the custody and deliverie over of the Scriptures committed unto the fame
together with the Interpretation of them; that there is an Universal, or
Catholic Church of GOD dispersed over the face of the Earth, which is Christ's
Spouse, and Christ's body being gathered of the Fathers of the old world of the
Church of the Jews, of the spirits of the faithful dissolved, of the spirits
of the faithful militant, and of the Names yet to be borne, which are already
written ^n the Book of Life,

That there is also a visible Church distinguished by the outward works of
GODS Covenant, and the renewing of the holy doctrine with the use of the
mysteries of GOD, and the Invocation, and Sanctification of his holy name: that
there is also an holy succession in the Prophets of the new Testament, and the
Fathers of the Church from the time of the Apostles, and Disciples, which saw
our Savior in the flesh, unto the Consummation of the work of the Ministry,
which persons are called of GOD by gift or Inward anointing, and the vocation
of GOD followed by an outward calling, and ordination of the Church: I believe
that the souls of those that dye in the Lord are blessed and rest from their
labors, and enjoy the sight of God yet so as they are in farther expectation
of their glory in the last day, at which time all fleshof man shall arise, and
be changed, and shall appear and receave from Jesus Christ eternal judgment,
and the glory of the Saints shall then be tull, and the Kingdom shall be
given to God the Father, from which time all things shall continue for ever in
that being, and estate which then they shall receive, so there are three
times, if times they may be called, or parts of Eternity.

The first, the time before Beginning, when the Godhead was without the being
of any Creature.

The second, the time of the Mystery, which continues from the Creation to
the Dissolution of the world.

And the third, the time of the Revelation of the Saints of God; which time is
the last, and is everlasting without change.

FINIS.
