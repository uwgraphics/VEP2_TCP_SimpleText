revealed?

Printed in the year. 1602.

R.G. the translatour of M. Iunius his letters: To the Christian Reader.
SVch as of late years have rent themselves from the holy service of God,
used im the public congregations and Churches of England, being destitute of
any sound warrant from the word of God, have sought from time to time so much
the more earnestly (as the manner of such is) to shroude themselves under the
shadow of humane authority. Hence it came to pass that Master Francis
Iunius, a man of great learning, and godliness, was solicited by some of them
(as may appear by these letters ensuing) in the year 99. to be a favourer of
their erroneous opinions and of their unchristian disordered and undutiful
proceedings: whose answer, being delivered by himself to a religious and
worshipful knight, and so coming to my hands, I have presumed to communicate
with thee, by the motion of some godly and well disposed, hoping that through
the blessing of God, and thy prayers it may prove a good means to stay such
as are wavering, to confirm such as do stand, and to recover such as are
fallen. For although he do not enter into an exact discussing of the question
with arguments, objections, and answers: yet he uses a very grave and godly
admonition, which is oftentimes of greater fruit, then a long and learned
disputation. And whosoever does diligently study the book of God, shall find,
that the holy Prophets and Apostles do in many places insist upon a plain and
simple asleve^ation of the truth rather then upon multitude of proof and
arguments. Besides, if we observe the story of the holy Martyrs of our own
Church and others, we may preceive that by the sound profession of their faith,
and suffering for the same, they have glorified God and advanced the kingdom
of Jesus Christ as well as others have done by arguments and reasons. And yet
notwithstanding if thou do well observe these letters of Master Iunius, thou
shall find in them not vain and empty words: but weighty and sound
reasons grounded upon the holy Scriptures of God. Thus praying thee to take
these first fruits of my poor labors in this kind in good part, and
beseching god to give a blessing hereunto; I bid thee heartily farewell in the
Lord.

Thine in the Lord, R.G.

The Answer to R.G. his Epistle prefixed before Mr. Iunius letters.
SUch as have separated themselves / from the corrupt service of God / used in
the public congregations and parishes of England being persecuted with
af^lictions reproaches and slanders both at home and in the land when now they
live exiles: have been constreyned to publish to the world / the confession of
their Christian faith / and causes of their departure from the foresaid English
synagogues for clearing of the truth of God and witnesses of the same / both
which were much and many ways calumniated. More specially they dedicated that
little book to al Christian universities near about to be discussed / approved
or reproved by the godly learned in them And sending one in particular to the
hands of M.H. Iunius, a man of great learning and godliness / dwelling near unto
them to be by him and the rest of his brethren of the university at Leyden
judged of they received from him a letter lately by one R.G. translated and
printed in English whether with the authors consent or not is yet unknown: but
the copy (as the publisher says) was given out by the author himself / who
might had done well to have given a copy of the answer likewise* or if he did /
the translator has not dealt indifferently to publish one and not an other.
How ever it were / al men may see how just and necessary occasion those eriled
Christians now have / to print their answer also which upon the receipt of his
Letter they sent unto him / but hitherto have spared to give out any one copy
either of his or theirs: whether for doubt of their own cause or reverend
regard rather of that man / let the sequel declare / and let the discrete
reader by it judge / whether party has most advantage.

As for the translators censure that they sought to shroud themselves under the
shadow of humane authority. this brief narratio^ of the carriage of the matter
/ and the plain apology which they make unto Mr. Iunius of their proceedings
/ will show it (unto al godly wise) to be but the surmise of a malicious heart.
And were it not that the weakness and badnes of their cause compels them thus
to do it might seem strange that any of the church of England would publish
such a writing as this in their own defense / as if it approved their estate /
and condemned those foresaid Christian exiles: when any whose eyes ar in his
head / may see by Mr Iunius his writing unto them / as Christian brethren / and
refusing at al to undertake the maintenance of those English parishes or
conviction of such as separate from them how far it is from justifying those
synagogues estate. Yea al wiseharted may and will we doubt not easily discern
how naked and helpless they be which neither by their friends at home / nor
the most learned abroad can otherwise be ^elieved then by such things as
hitherto they have printed Or howsoever this present generation shall judge of
these things / yet the ages to come / (which will be less partial) will easily
give sentence.

The better to certify thee* good reader of the whole cause / and carriage
thereof / here is with these Lecters set forth also their Confession of faith /
with the Epis^le and preface as it is in Latin. And whereas there is since that
time published also a second epistle of Mr. Iunius there is now the answer to it
set forth likewise: which answer was presently written upon the receipt of his
Letter / but not then sent for causes partly before noted and now more fully
signified and sent to Mr. Iunius himself. The things which here are mentioned
of corruptions in some other churches and dealings that have passed about the^
ar yet spared from being published in print at large til further occasion and
provocation be. Only the general and brief h^^ds of the matter in controversy
/ at now printed (as they were sent unto Mr. Iunius / although we were loath to
do it but that their was necessary occasion given by things which passed in
the Letters / as al me^ may see. Moreover it is not to be omitted / how in the
printed copy of Mr. Iunius Letter / For proof hereof see Mr. Iunius own words
noted in the margin of his letter herafter following, and compare also this
edition of it, with the translators before published.
some things were corrupted / by alteration omission / and c. Otherwise then in
the original by himself first sent / they do stand and ar yet to be seen. This
it is not likely Mr. Iunius himself would do but was (perhaps) the printers
fault / or rather indeed the translators evil mind for his mother churches
advantage / who^ falsehood seeks to uphold / when syncerity and truth has
forsaken her. It shall therefore rest upon him / as the first fruits of his evil
labors in this kind, til he clear himself.

The Apostles and Prophets / and Martyrs by him mentioned / dealt not so.
Neither yet did they always insist upon a plain and simple asseveration of
the truth, but mainteyned it also with proofs and arguments from scripture /
and sound reason / against such as oppugned the same. Act. 17.2.3. and 18.28.
and 28.23. Rom, 1.17. and 3.4.10. and 4.3.7.17. and
9.7.9.12.13.17.20.25.27.29.33. and 10.5.11.15.19.21. and 11.2.9.26. 1 Cor.
15.3.4.25.27.45.54.55. Gal. 3.6 8.10.11.13.22. and 4.21.22.27.30. Esa. 40.12.
and 41.21.22.23.24. and 44.6. and c. Mal. 4.4. Acts and monuments in the
history of Mr. Brute, Thorp, Lambert, Ridly, Philpot, Bradford, and many
others. And though the Apostles and Prophets had / yet no ma^s asseveratio^ now
/ may be compared with theirs / but must be tried by their writings. And so
these Christian exiles / published to that end their faith unto the world /
against which to this day / neither Mr. Iunius nor any else of that or the other
universities / have to our knowledge used any one weighty and sound reason
grounded upon the holy scripture of God, as this translator would bear men in
hand he does / and as the Prophets did in all their asseverations / taking their
ground from the law before given. Mat. 22.40. The Lord rebuke Satan / and make
bright the glory of his name and Gospel / and turn to the profit of every
faithful soul / these things now published by his unworthy and contemned
servants / to his own eternal praise in Christ. Amen.

The Confession of faith of certain English people / living in exile / in the
Low countries. Together with the Preface to the Reader Which we wish of all
may be read and considered.
2. Cor. 4/13. We beleev: therefore have we spoken.


Harmony of Confess. in the preface set before it, in the Name of the French
and Belgic Churches.
The Prelates and Priests do alvvay cry out, that we are Heretics,
Schismatics, and Sectaryes. Howbeit let the^ know, that the crime of Heresy
is not to be imputed to the^, whose faith does wholy rely upon most sure
grounds of the Scripture: That they are not Schismatics, who entierly cleave
to the true Church of God, such as the Prophets and Apostles do describe unto
us: Nor they to be counted Sectaryes, who embrace the truth of God which is
one and alvvayes like it self.

To the reverend and learned men, the Students of holy Scripture, in the
Christian Universities of Leyden in Holland, of Sanctandrewes in Scotland* of
Heidelbergh, Geneva, and the other like famous schools of learning in the Low
countries, Scotland, Germany, and France.

The English exiles in the Low countries, wish grace and peace in Jesus Christ.

THis true confession of our faith, in our judgment wholly agreeable to the
sacred Scripture, we do here exhibit unto all to be discussed: and unto you
(reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two causes. First, for that we know you are
able in respect of your singular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are
willing in respect of your sincere piety, to convince our errors by the light
of Gods word, if in any thing we be out of the way. Secondly, that this
testimony of Christian faith, if you also find it agree with the word of truth,
may by you be approved, either in silence or by writing, as you shall think
best.

It may be, we shall be thought very bold, that being despised of all, yet
doubted not to solicit you so many and so great learned men. But this we did,
partly at the request of others to whom we would not deny it: partly with
desire to have the truth through your help better defended and further spread
abroad: partly co^streyned by our exile and other calamityes almost infinite:
partly also moved with love of our native country, and of these wherein now we
live, and others else where: wishing that all may walk with a right foot to the
truth of the Gospel, and praying daily unto God, that the great work of
restoring Religion and the Church decayed, which he has happily begun in these
latter times, by our Gracious Sovereign and the other Princes of these
countries and ages (his servants) he would fully accomplish, to the glory of
his name and eternal salvation in Christ of his elect in all places of the
earth.

As for the causes which moved us to publish this Confession of faith, and to
forsake the Church of England as now it stands, we have truly and as briefly
as we could related them in the Preface to the Reader, hereafter following: and
therefore thought here to omit the repetition of them. The Lord Jesus always
preserve you and your Vniversityes to the praise of his name, the orname^t of
good learning, the propagation and maintenance of his pure Religion. From
Amsterdam in the low countries. The year of the last patience of the saints,
1598.

The preface to the Christian Reader.
IT may seem strange unto thee (Christian Reader) that any off the Englysh
nation should for the truth of the Gospel be forced to forsake their natyve
contrye / and lyve in exile / especially in these days / when the Gospel
seems to have free passage / and flourish in that land. And for this cause
have our exile been hardly thought of by many / and evil spoken of by some who
know not (as it seems) either the true estate of the Church of England or
causes of our forsaking and separating from the same / but hearing this sect
(as they call it) to be every where spoken against have (with out at all
further search) accounted and divulged us as heretics / or Schismatickes at
the least. Act. 28, 22
Yea some (and such as worst might) have sought the increase of our afflictions
/ even here also if they could, which thing they have / both secretly and
openly attempted. This has Satan added unto all our former sorrows / envying
that we should have rest in any part of the Rev. 12.
inhabyted world / and therefore cease not to make war with the remnant of
the woman's seed / which keep the commaundeme^ts of God and have the testimony
of Jesus Christ. But the Lord that Psalm. 105, 13, 14.
brought his former Israel out off Egypt / and when they walked about from
nation to nation / from one Kingdom to an other people / suffered no man to do
them wrong / but reproved kings for their sakes: the same Lord yet lyveth to
maynteyne the right off his afflicted servantes / whom he has severed / and
daily gathers out off the world / to 1 Pet* 2.9.
be unto himselff a chosen generation / a royal priesthood a peculiar people
and Israel off God: He Psalm. 46.1.
is our hope and strength and help in trobles ready to be found / he will hyde
us under his wings / and under his feathers we shall be sure until these
myseries be over past. And though we could for our parts well have borne this
rebuke off Christ in silence / and left our cause to him who judges justly all
the children off men: yet for the manyfestation and clearing of the truth off
God from reproach off men / and for the bringing off others together with our
selves to the same knouwledge and fellowship off the Gospel / we have thought
it needful and our duty to make known unto the world / our vnfeyghned faith
in God / and loyal obedience toward our Prince / and all Governors set over
us in the Lord / together with the reasons off our leaving the ministry
worship and Church off England. Which are not (as they pretend) for some few
faults and corruptions remaining / such as we acknowledge man be found in the
perfectest Church on earth: Neither count we it lawful for any member to
forsake the fellowship off the Church for blemyshes and imperfections / which
every one according to his calling should studeously seek to cure / and to
exspect and further it until either there follow redress or the disease be
grown incureable / and the Apoc. 2, 5.
candlestick be moved out off the place. But we having through Gods mercy
learned to discern betwixt 2 Cor 6, 14, 15, etc. Psalm 9^, 20. 2 These. 2, 3.
the true worship off God / and the Antichristian leitourgie / the true
ministry off Christ and Antichristian priesthood and prelacy / the ordinances
off Christ's testament and popysh cannons: have also learned to leave Psa. 37,
27 Ier. 51, 6. Rev. 18, 4. and 14, 1.
the evil and choose the good to forsake Babell the land off our captyvitie /
and get us unto Sion the mount of the Lords holiness / and place where his
honor dwells.

But first we desire thee / good Reader to understand / and mind that we have
not in any dislyke of the civil estate and politic government in that common
wealth / which we much like and love separated our selves from that Church:
Neither have we shaken of our allegiance and dutyfull obedyence to our
Sovereign Prince Elezabeth her honorable Consellers and other Magistrates set
over us but have always and still do reverence love and obey them every one in
the Lord / opposing our selves against al enemies foreign or domestical:
against all invasions / insurrections / treasons or conspiracies by whom
soever intended against her Majesty and the State / and are ready to adve^ture
our lyves in their defense / if need require. Neiter have our greatest
adversaryes ever been able to attaint us of the least disloyalty in this
regard. And though now we be exiled / yet do we daily pray and will for the
preservation peace and prosperity off her Majesty and all her domynions

And whereas we have been accused off intrusion into the Magistrates office / as
goeing about our selves to reform the abuses in that land / it is a mere
malicious calumny / which our adversaries have forged out of their own heart.
Neh. 6, 6.7.8.
We have always both by word and practice showed the contrary / neither ever
attempted or purposed any such thing: but have indevored thus only to reform
our selves and our lyves according to the rule off Gods word / by absteyning
from all evyll and keeping the commandments off Jesus: leaving the suppressing
and casting out off those remnants of Idolatry / unto the Magistrates / to
whom it belongs.

And further we testifye by these presents unto all men / and desire them to
take knowledge hereof that we have not forsaken any one point of the true
ancient catholic and apostolic faith professed in our land: but hold the
same grounds of Christian religion with them still / agreeing likewise herein
/ with the Dutch / Scottysh / Germane / French / Heldetian / and all other
Christian reformed Churches round about us / whose confessions publyshed / we
call to witness our agreement with them in matters of greatest moment / being
co^ferred with these articles of our faith following. Harmon of confess.
The things then only against which we contend / and which we mislyke in the
Englysh parish assemblyes / are many relics of that man off Sin (whom they
pretend to have abandoned) yet retained among them / and with a high hand
maynteyned / vpholden / and imposed. The partici^ers whereof being almost
infinite) cannot well off us besett down / and would be tedious and yrksome to
thee (good Reader:) But the principal heads we will truly relate / and that
so briefly as in so large and confuse a subject we can.

First in the planting and constituting of their Church (at the beginning of
our Queen Elizabets reign) they receved at once into the body of that Church
/ as members / the whole land / which generally then stood for the most part
professed Papists who had revolted from the profession / which they made in
the days of king Edward off happy memory / and shed much blood off many
Christian Martyrs in Queen Maryes days. This people yet standinge in this
fearful sinful state / in idolatry / blyndnes superstition and all manner
wickedness / without any professed repentance / and without the means theroff /
namely the preaching off the word goeing before / were by force and aucthority
of law only compelled / and together receved into the bosom / and body of
the Church / their seed baptized themselves receved and compelled to the Lords
supper / had this ministry and servyce (which now then use) enjoined and set
over them / and eversynce they and their seed remain in this estate / being
all but one body commonly called the Church of England* Here are none exempted
or excluded / be they never so profane or wretched no athiest / adulterer /
thief / or murderer / no liar / perjured / witch or coniurer and c. all are
one fellowship one body / one Church. Now let the law off God be looked into /
and there will be found / that such persons 1 Pet. 2, 5. Ier. 51, 26
are not fit stones for the lords spiritual house / no meet members for
Christ's glorious body. Act. 2, 38 40, 41 and 8, 36, 37 and 15 9. Ioh. 10, 3.4
5. Esa. 35, 8.9
None of years may be receved into the Church without free professed faith
repentance and submission unto the Gospel of Christ and his heavenly
ordynances: Neither may any contynew Ioh. 15, 2.5 Mat ^8, 15, 17 Lev. 13, 46.
Numb, 4.13
there longer then they bring forth the fruytes off faith walking as becomes
the Gospel of Christ. Christ Ioh 15, 19. and 17.14, 16. Mat. 3, 12 Lev. 20.24
26. 1. Ioh. 4.5.6
Jesus has called and severed his servants out of and from the world. How then
should this confused and mixed people be esteemed the orderly gathered true
planted and right constituted Church of God.

Secondly as they have retained the whole rout of the popysh multitude without
any distinction / for members of their Church: so have they set over them (as
reason was) the same popysh Clergy and Prelacy / which they receved from the
Romysh Apostasy and this day is to be found in the popysh Churches: About
forty ecclesiastical popish offices are at this day in the Church of England
never a one appointed by Christ in his testament.
to wit^ / Archbs, Primats, Bbs, Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeaco^s,
Deanes, Chauncellors, Commissaries, and the rest of that rabble / which rule and
govern these assemblyes according to the popysh cannons / rites / and
customs. These have the power and authority in their hands to set forth
injunctions / to make and depose ministers* to excomunicate both priest and
people which they do very exquisitly if they yield not unto them their due
homage and obedience. These have both Ecclesiastical and civil authority /
to reign as Princes in the Church and lyve as Lords in the common wealth /
to punysh imprison / and persecute eve^ to death all that dare but once mutter
against their unlawful proceedinges. Of these prelates tyranny cruelty and
unlawful aurthoritie the better sort both of preachers and people have cried
out / and long time sued unto the Prince and parliament to have them removed
out of the Church / as being the lymmes of Antichrist. Apoc. 13.
But not prevayling they are now content (for avoiding of the cross of Christ
/ to submitt them selves and their souls to this Antichristian Hierarchy /
and bear the sinful yoke and burden of their traditions / and to receve and
carry about the dreadful and detestable mark of the beast upon them.

Thirdly / The inferior ministry of that Church / consists of Priests /
Parsons / Vicars / Curats / hired preachers / or Lecturers, with Clerks,
Sextons, etc. all which have receved their offices callings and authority
from their ^orenamed Lords the Prelates, to whom they have sworn their
canonical obedience / and promised to perform it with all reverence and
submission. with what words and rites, in what habit and gesture, these things
are to be done, they are taught in their rub^ik
Their office is to read over the servyce book and Bps. Decrees, thereby to
worship God / to marry / to bury / to church women / to visit the sick / give
him the Sacrament / and forgyve him all his sins: and if their lyvinges or
benefices (as they are called) amount to a certain sum of money in the
Queens book / then must they preach / or get some other to preach for them
four sermons in a year in their parish / where also must be noted that the
most part of these Priests are utterlye unlearned / and cannot preach at all:
whereby it comes to pass that most of the people are as blind as they were in
the dark days of popery. These ministers generally / as well preachers as other
/ lyve in fear and servitude under their foresaid Lords the Bbs. for as
without their license written and sealed they cannot preach / so upon their
displeasure and for not obeying their injunctions / they are many times
suspe^ded degraded / and if they will not be ruled / put in prison: so that
sundry of them have been suspended and imprisoned for preaching against the
Prelates, not subscribing to their devised articles and book of common prayer
not wearing the square capp and surplus / not reading the service book / and
be tied to the same / not coming to the Bishops courts / visitations /
inquisitions / and c. till now of late being wearyed with these trobles / they
give place to their tyranny / and are content to conform themselves / and
yield their canonical obedience according to their oathe / keeping now silence
/ yea going back / bearing and bolstering the things / which heretofore by
word and writing they stood against so long as there was any hope that the
Queen and Counsel would have harkened unto them / and put these adversary
Prelates out of the Church.

Fourthly / for the administration / which is by law imposed upon all both
Clergy and Laity, (for so they distinguish them) they have gathered their
service book verbatim out of the mass boo^^ / turning out of latin into
englysh the Suffragies, Prayers, Letany, Collects, etc. (leaving on^ some of
the gross points therein) keeping still the old fashyon of Psalms Chapters
Pistles / Gospells / versicles respondes / also Te Deum, Be^edictus,
Magnificat, Nunc dimittis, Our Father, Lord have mercy upon us, The Lord be
with you, O Lord open t^ow my lyps, Glory to God on high, Lift up your hearts, O
come let us rejoice, Glory be to the Father, Quicunque vult, etc. These do
they read daily morning and evening all the year long in their priestly
vestures / Surplus / cope / and c. some they say / and some they singe having
in their Cathedral Churches / the Organs, Queristers, singing men and boys as
in times past in popery. Many popysh errors yet remain in that book which
their own preachers have noted / and found fault with* There are they
prescribed what prayers to read over the dead / over the corn and grass /
some time in the year. Some of them in certain English books se^ forth, have
reckned above 100. popish corruptions yet retained in this church.
By it are they enjoined to keep their holy days to their Lady (as they call
her) to all Saints and Angels / to all Christ's Apostells / (except Paul and
Barnabas) whose eves they are commanded to fast / as also their Lent and Ember
days / besides frydayes / and satardayes through out the whole year. By this
book are the ministers instructed how to marry with the sign of the Ringe /
and c. to baptize in the hallowed Font with sign of the cross / with
Godfathers and Godmothers / asking the child whether it will forsake the
devyll and all his works / and c. to minister also their other sacrament or
communion to the people kneeling / as when in popery they receved their maker /
the words of Christ's institution altered and others in stead of them taken
out of the popes portuis / with innumerable such like enormyties and fopperies
wherewith it swarmeth. And this is all the worship and service which many
parishes have contynually / except peradventure some written homelyes which the
unlearned priests read unto them. This service must first be read / and has
the preeminence even on the Lords days before any preaching yra before the
Bible it self: He that can read this book distinctly is fit enough with them
to be priest / yea many that have been Artificers / as Shoemakers / Taylers /
Weavers / Porters / and c. and with out any giffes or knowledge at all / save
only to read Englysh / have been and are admytted and to this day maynteyned by
the prelates in the ministry. To these Churches ministers and servyce must all
the people there come every day / yea though they have in the next parish a
preacher / and in their own a dumb unlearned priest / yet are they all tied
to their own Church / and minister / and must at the least twice a year receve
the Sacrament at his hands. If they refuse this / or do not ordinaryly come to
their parish Church then are they summoned / excommunicated / and imprisoned /
till they become obedient. In this bondage are our countrymen there held under
their Priests and Prelates: and such as by the word of God witness against and
condemn these abominations / they hate punysh put to death / and persecute
out of the land. Who now in whom any spark of true light is cannot plainly
perceive this their ministry worship and Church to be false and adulterate?
does Christ's eternal testament or deyne and approve of such popish Lords
and Prelates to reign over his Church? are these those Christian Bishops /
that is Romans 12 1. Cor. 12. Ephesians. 4.
Pastors / Teachers and Elders / which he has set in his Church and over his
own people unto the worlds end? Or can chose preachers which are thus created
and deposed by / thus sworn and obedient unto / their spiritual lords / be
deemed true teachers of the Gospel of Christ lawfully called and ordained to
that ministerye? Is that their Englysh Mass the true and John. 4, 24 Mat 15, 9
spiritual worship of God according to his own will? we are taught in the
scriptures Deu 6, 4, 5 Mat. 16, 6 2. Cor. 6, 14 15 Psalm 106, 34 35.36.
that there can be no agreement made betwixt Christ and Antichrist / betwixt the
Laws of God and men's traditions: that the servants of Jesus may not submytt
unto or receve the mark of that beast / neither drink of the cup of the whore
of Babylons fornycations / or buy any of her wares: but must Jude: ver. 3
contend for the mayntena^ce of that faith / which was once gyven unto the
saints / keeping their* souls and bodies pure from Antichristian pollutions
/ touching 2 Cor. 6, 17.
no uncle anethinge Ephesians. 5, 11.
nor having any fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness / Reb. 18, 4
and 14, 10, 11.
least by partaking with their suns they receve also of their plagues / and
drink of the wine of the wrath of God / and be tormented in fire and
brimstone / before the holy Angels and before the lamb for evermore.

If Christ be God let us follow him: but if the pope be God / what shall we
say? why have we left him / his Church and ministry / his worship and
jurisdiction / or what halting and mocking with the Lord is this / to put away
the popes person and retain his prelacy and ministry his Laws / Traditions
and Cannons / his worship and service: Mat. 6, 24.
or at the least to frame unto our selves a worship ministry and Church after
the pattern and mould of the Apostacye of Room / which what other thing is it
/ them to make an Image of that first wild beast / and force men to worship it?
2. King. 16, 10, 11, 12. Apoc, 13, 12 14, 15.


Thus see thou briefly (good Christian Reader) the things which we mislike
in the Church of England / and for which we have separated our selves / as God
commands. Ier. 51, 6. Mich. 2, 10. Rev. 18, 4. 2 Cor. 6, 17. Act. 2, 40.
To all these / if we were amongst them / s -- uld we be forced to submytt our
bodies and souls / or else suffer violence at the hands of the Prelates / and
end our lyves by violent death or most miserable imprisonment / as many of our
brethren before us have done. For so great is the malice and power of those
romysh priests / that they persecute unto death such as speak against them:
and such poor Christians as they cast into their noisome prysons / can seldom
or never get out (except with shipwreck of conscience) until they be carried
forth upon the Bear. Neither is there any care taken for their relief in this
case: but being thus cast into prison / there they are deteyned without any
alloweance of meat or money for their mayntenance / be their want and poverty
never so great. If they have any thing of their own / there they are driven to
spend it up: if they have nothing / there they are left by the Prelates to feed
on the air. And that they may more readily be sterved / or weakened in the
truth / they are commonly shut up in close prison / their friends and
acquayntance being not suffered to come at them: Nay even their wyves and
children being kept and debarred from them by the tyranny of these bloddye
Prelates and their instruments: whose hard hearts and unnatural cruelty / if
thou did understand (gentle Reader) as many of us have felt / and to this
day yet feel it would make thy heart to bleed / considering their unmercifully
and barbarous dealing. And how many souls have perished in their prisons
through miserable usage / how many have been put to death and how many banyshed
/ though we could to their eternal infamy relate to all the world / yet will we
not blaze abroad their acts (for we take no delight in laying open their shame)
but mourn for them in secret / commytting our cause to God that judges justly
/ knowing that he Ps. 9.12*
that makes inquisition for blood remembers it / and will not forget the
complaint of the poor. And thou (Christian Reader) voutch safe to remember
unto God in thy prayers such as yet remain in bands and prison amongst them
for the testymony of Jesus / enduring a hard fight of afflictions / and having
the sentence of death in themselves are like (if the Lord send not unexpected
delyverance) there to end their days. Heb. 13, 3*


Concerning our selves who through the mercy of God have found a place of rest
in this land / for which benefyt we are always and every where humbly
thanckfull: we desire (Christian Reader) thy charitable and Christian opinion
of / and holy prayers unto God for us / whose kingdom we seek / whose
ordinances we desire to establysh and obey: protesting with good consciences /
that it is the truth of his Gospel only for which we stryve against those
cursed relics of Antichristian apostasy: unto which we dare in no wise
submytt our selves / no not for a moment. For if it be not lawful for
Christians at this day to receive the ceremonye^ of Moses Law together with
the Gospel as the Passover / Circumcision / the Priesthood / Sacrifices / and
c. A Gal. 4.4.5 6. and 5.1.2.
which yet were once commanded by God himself: Heb. 8. and 9 and 10. chap.
how can we think it tolerable to observe the odious ceremonies of
Antichrist or submytt our selves to his laws / Priesthood / Hierarchy and
traditions / which the Lord never allowed / and which never entered in to his
heart: yea which he has so severely for bydden / with fearful judgments
threatened unto all hat shall so do. But because we have been very grievously
sla^dred in our own nation / and the bruit thereoff has followed us unto this
land / whereby we have been hardly deemed of by many without cause / we have
been forced at length to publysh this brief but true confession of our faith /
for the clearing of our selves from sclander / and satisfying of many who
desired to know the things we hold. Wherein if in any thing we err (as who
is so perfect that he erreth not) we read (good reader) thy Christian brotherly
censure and information / promysing always (through the grace of God) to yield
unto the truth when it shall be further showed us / and leave our errors when
by the light of his word they shall be reproved. In like manner it shall be thy
part and duty to acknowledge and submytt unto the truth / by whom soever it is
professed / looking always rather to the preciousnes of the treasure it self
then to the baseness of the vessels which conteyne it / or the infirmities of
those that witness the same / in whose mortal bodies thou shall see nothing but
the marks and dyeing of our lord Ihesus Christ. 2 Cor. 4, 7
But hold not thy faith in respect of men's persons / neither be thou moved at
the evyl reports which have been raised of us: Iam. 2, 1
Here have thou the true sum of our Christian faith / try all things by the
true light of Gods word: and if thou shall reap and profit by these our
labors / gyve God the glory / and remember us unto him in thy prayers.
Farewell in Christ Jesus. 1596.

Elders, Deacons, Helpers, to the instruction, government, and service of his

20 This ministry is craftily Romans 12.7.8. Ephe. 4.11.12. with the Epist. to

may vsurp or execute a ministry but such as are ri^tly called by the Church
whereof they stand ministers, unto such offices, and in such manner, as God has
prescribed in his word. And being so called, they ought Act. 20.28. 1 Cor. 1.^.

to give all diligence to fulfill their ministry, to be found faithful and
unblameable in all things.

22. This ministry is alike given to every Christian congregation, with like
and equal power and commission to have and enjoy the same, a^^ God offerith
(...) men and means, the same rules given to all for the election and
execution thereof in all places. Mar, 28, 20, 1 Cor 4.^^. and 12, 4, 5.6.7, and
14, 33, 36, and 16.1, Ephesians, 4, 10.11.12, 13, Revel. 1.20. 1 Cor. 3.21, 22, 23.
Mar, 18, 17, see besides these, the Article 20. before.


23. As every christian congregation Act. 6.3.5.6. and 14.23. and 15.2.3.22.23.
2 Cor. 8.19. 1 Timothy 3.10. and 4.14. and 5.22. Numb. 8.9.10. 1 Cor. 16.3.
has power and commandment to elect and ordeine their own ministry
according to the rules in GOds word prescribed, and whilst they shall
faithfully execute these office, to have them 1 Timothy 3.10. and 5.22. Romans
16.17. Phil. 3.2. 1 Timothy 6.3.5. Ez^. 44.12.13. Mat. 18.17.
In super abundant love for their work sake, to provide for them, to honor
them and reverence them, according to the dignity of the office they execute:
So have they also 1 The^ 12.13. 1 Timothy 5.3.17.18. Heb. 13.17. 1 Cor. 9.7. etc.
Gal. 6.6.
power and commandment when any such default, either in their life, doctrine,
or administration breaks out, as by the rule of the word debarreth them from,
or depriveth them of their ministry, by due order to depose them from the
ministry they exercised: yea if the case so require, and they remain
obstinate and impenitent, orderly to cut them of by excommunication.

24. Christ Psalm. 122.3. Act. 2.47. Romans 16.2. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor 5.4. 2 Cor.
2.6.7.8. Lev. 20.4.5. and 24.14. Number. 5.2.3. Deu. 13.9.
has given this power to receive in or to cut of any member, to the whole
body together of every Christian congregation, and not to any one member
apart, or to more members sequested from the whole, or to any other
congregation to do it for them: Yet so, as each Congregation ought to use the
Act. 15.2.22. with 1 Cor. 3.5.22. and 12.20. and 14.33.
best help they can hereunto, and the most meet member they have to pronounce
the same in their public assembly.

25 Every member of each Christian congregation, how excellent, great, or
learned soever, ought to be subject to this censure and judgment of Christ: Yet
ought not the Church without great care and due advise to proceed against such
public persons. Lev. 4. chap. 2 Chro. 26.20. Psalm. 2.10.11.12. and 141.5. and
149.8.9. Act. 11.^ 4. 1 Timothy 5.19.20.21.


26 As Christ has for the keeping of this Church in holy and orderly
communion, placed some special men over the Church, who by their office are to
govern, oversee, visit, watch etc. So Mar. 13.34.^^. Luke 17.3. Gal. 6.1. 1
These. 5.11. Iud. ver. 3.20 Heb. 10.24.25. and 12.15
lykwise for the better keeping thereof in all places, by all the members, he
has given authority and laid duty upon them all to watch one over another.
^ct 20.17.28. Heb. 13.17.24. Song. 3.3. Esa. 62.6. Ezekiel. 33.2. Mat. 24.45. Luke
12.42. 1 These. 5.14.


27 Finally, whilst the Ministers and people thus remain together in this
holy order and christian communion, each one endevoring to do the will of God in
their calling, and thus to wallie to the glory of God, in the obedience of
faith, Christ has promised to be present with them, to bless and defend them
against all fraud and force of their enemies, so as the gates of hell shall not
prevail against them. Mat. 28.20* Luke 12.35.36.37.38. Romans ^6.19.20. Deuteronomy. 28
1. etc. Zach. 2.5. and 12.2.3.4. Psalm. 25 2 and 132.12.13. etc. Mat. 16.18.


28 But when and where this holy order and diligent watch was intermitted,
neglected, violated: Antichrist that m^n of sin did together with other
points of Christian faith corrupt and alter also the holy ordinances, offices,
and administrations of the Church: and in stead thereof brought in and erected
a strange new forged ministry, Leitourgy and government. Yea and the nations
kingdoms and inhabitants of the earth were made drunken with this cup of
fornications and abominatio^s and all people enforced to receive the beasts
mark and worship his image and so brought into confusion and babilonish
bon^age. 2 Thessalonians. 2.3.4.8.9.10.11.12 Apoc. 9. and 13. and 17 and 18. cap 1 Timothy

Pe^icanons Archdeacons, Chancellors, Commissaries, Priests, Deacons or
Halfpriests, Parsons, Biccars, Curats, Hireling roving Preachers,
Churchwardens, Parish-clerkes: Also their Doctors, Proctors, and other
officers of there spiritual courts (as they call them) together with the whole
rabble of the Prelates and their Servitou^s from and under them ^et over these
Cathedral and Parishionall Assemblies in this confusion are a strange and
Antichristian ministry and offices: and are not that ministry above named,
instituted in Christ's Testament, n^^ placed in or over his Church. Apoc. 9.3.

preceden. 1.7.12.13.14.19.20.21, 22, 23, 24, 28:


30 These their Popish offices, Entrance, Administration and maintenance, with
their names, titles, privileges, and prerogatives: also the power and rule they
usurp over and in these Ecclesiastical assemblies over the wholl ministry,
wholl ministration and affairs thereof, yea one over another, creating Priests,
citing, suspending, silencing, deposing, absoluing, excommunicating, etc. Their
confounding of Ecclisiasticall and civil jurisdiction, causes and proceedings
in their persons, courts, commissions, visitations, the Priests of less rule,
taking their ministry from and exercising it under them by their prescription
and limitation, swearing canonical obedience unto them, administering by their
devised imposed, stinted popish Leitourgie, etc. Finally, the dispensations
which they use for plurality of benefices, licenses of non residency, license
to mary and eat flesh (both which with them are on certain days and times
forbidden etc. These (we say) are sufficient proofs of the former assertion,
the perticulars therein being duly examined by and compared to the rules of
Christ's Testament. Not to speak here, of Baptism administered by midwives, of
the Cross used in Baptism, of questions propounded to the infants, of the
Priests surplice, prayer over the dead, at burial, kneeling at the Lords
supper, and other the like popish corruptions, almost infinite, retained and
allowed among them. Confer this article with the precedent 1.7.12.13 14, 19.

31 These Ecclesiastical Assemblies, remaining thus in, confusion and bondage
under this Antichristian Ministry Cour^^, Canons, worship, Ordinances etc.
without freedom and power to redress any enormitie among them, cannot be said
in this confusion and subjection, truly to have Christ their Prophet Priest and
King, neither can be in this estate, (whilst we judge them by the rules of
Gods word) esteemed the true, visible orderly gathered, or constituted

36 Thus being righly gathered, established, and still proceeding in christian
communion and obedience of the Gospel of Christ, none is to separate for falts

themselves every way to be acknowledged / reverenced and obeyed according to

44 And thus, we labor to give unto God that which is Gods, and unto Caesar
that which is Cesars, and unto all men, that which be longs unto them:
Endevoring our selves to have always a clear conscience toward God and
toward men: And having hope in God that the resurrection of the dead shall be of
the just unto life, and of the unjust unto condemnation, everlasting.

Now if any take this to be heresy: then do we with the Apostle freely
confess that after the way which they call heresy, we worship God the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ: believing all things that are written in the Law, and
in the Prophets and Apostles: And what soever is according to this rule of
truth published by this State or holde^ by any reformed Churches in their
Confessions abroad in the world. We do also reject and detest all strange and
heretical opinions and doctrines of all Heretics both old and new whatsoever.

45 Finally, whereas we are much flandered and traduced as if we denied or
misliked that form of prayer commonly called the Lords prayer: we thought it
needful here also concerning it to make known that we believe and acknowledge
it to be a most absolute and most excellent form of prayer, such as no men nor
Angels can set down the like. And that it was taught and appointed by our Lord
Jesus Christ not that we should be tied to the use of those very words, but
that we should according to that rule make all our requests and thanksgyuing
unto God, forasmuch as it is a perfect form and pattern containing in it
plain and sufficient directions of prayer, for all occasions and necessities,
that have been, are, or shall be, to the Church of God, or any member thereof, to
the end of the world. Mat. 6, 9-13 Luk, 1 1, 2, 3, 4, with Mat, 14.30 and 26,

Now unto him that is able to keep us that we fall not, and to present us
faltlesse before the presence of his glory with joy, that is, to God only wise
our Savior, be glory and majesty, and dominion, and power, both now and for
ever, Amen.

MASTER JUNIUS HIS FIRST LETTER, CONCERNING THE CONFESSION OF FAITH AFORESAID.
To his beloved in Christ the Brethren of the English Church, now abiding at
Amsterdam.
GRace mercy and peace from God the Father and our Savior Jesus Christ. I
have received of late (belooved Brethren in Christ) a little book by one of
your company; which is entitled, The confession of faith of some English men
banished in Belgia, and have known your desire partly by the speech of the
same messenger, partly by the preface of the writing. But as concerning my
self, beloved brethren, whom M. Iunius his words are, propter vicinitatem
which R.G. in his translation has omitted.
for nearnes sake peradventure ye have thought meet to be called upon a part,
I verily see not how much I can do in this cause, or how I can fit your
purpose. For I know that now long since every man does abound in his own
sense; and that those that are other wise minded are Fraterno animo.
with a brotherly mind so fare to be borne with, holding the head and
fundation, til the Lord reveal things further unto them. I know it is my part
not to play the busy body, but that I should serve the truth and charity in
my standing and measure which the Lord has bestowed upon me, in Christian
modesty and simplicity, as far as my skill and ability will stretch unto.
Certainly when I considered Caus^^ hau^.
this cause more diligently, I thought nothing more commodious or more safe for
the public and for you and my self, in all this matter, the^ that we should
embrace a holy silence, if there be any thing, wherein we be offended, and that
we commit our cause to the Lord, the author of our faith, and righter of our
cause. But because after a sort, you will not suffer me to be silent, and to
co^dole in secret for the wounds of the Church, which is rent more then
enough, by actions, especially being thrust forth in publik in this our age; I
will declare faith fully, and with a good conscience before God what I think:
beseeching him who is author of truth and peace that he would lead both you
and me alike into all truth according to his promise, and also dispose each of
our minds and affections to interpret brotherly one another requests,
answers, admonitions, and finally all our duties, although (as it comes to
pass, and is incident to man) disagreeing from our sense and taste.

I observe therefore that there are three heads or chief points in your little
book, wherein you desire our counsel and judgment. The first head is of
doctrine, which you profess in your little book. The second is of fact,
whereof ye accuse the English Churches. Lastly the third is, of the
conclusion, which you infer by comparing that your doctrine with that
practice of England; namely that ye cannot with good conscience entertain a
communion with those Churches, but that ye do abhor them with all your
hearts. Therefore I will speak briefly of these 3. things, Vt sentio.
what I think, entreating you brotherly to take my answer in good part.

I marvel that the point of doctrine, or little book of your confession,
beloved brethren, is sent over to me. I marvel that it was sent over to all
the students of holy Scriptures in all Christian Universities; for if there be
a certain consent of doctrine as you pretend it, truly I do not see what need
there was, that you should set forth a new confession in this consent of holy
and ancient doctrine. But if there be a dissension peradventure in the
doctrine, or rather a difference, that in deed ought not to be dissembled, if
so be that ye thought it necessary, that your doctrine should be declared.

Besides, in that you send to me; yea that you send to public view,
Confessionem.
your confession, I marvel, brethren, yea I greatly marvel, what your meaning
should be, both in respect of the end and the fact. For if ye have set it
forth to that end, that ye might purge your selves, I pray you brethren,
wherefore do ye desire, to purge your selves with so many souls; who have
not known you as yet to be accused; who can never take knowledge of the right
or wrong of your accusation; and who are not called unto it by any lawful
means? and (that which is worse) wherefore would ye have this done before so
many Infestis.
deadly enemies to God and the Church, who thirst after nothing so much as the
blood of the Church of God, and do rejoice that we indiscreetly make a
publishing of these wounds: that they by these very wounds might spoil the
Church, that precious body of Christ, of the blood of verity, and juice of
charity? Finally, why do ye this before so many weak ones, who not yet
knowing, that ye are borne (as I may so say) are offended, rather with a
carcasselike stink of schisms in the Church, before they know certainly the
body whereunto they may cleave? Alas brethren, is your purgation so much worth
unto you that therefore the public good of the Church should be brought into
so great danger? A Christian an humble, and godly mind ought to be otherwise
affected, and setting aside the respect of their own private good, constantly
thus to determine, let the earth rather first swallowe me up (as the Poet
says) and let me rather be accursed for my brethren, then that by me, and
for my credit sake even one of these little ones should be offended and kept
from coming to Christ, and abiding in Christ my Savior. Verily let what will
of my estimation go to wrack, who am a Christian, let me be trampled under
all men's feet, so that by my fact, I take nothing from Christ, from his body,
no not the lest thing. Atque hoc quide^ fratres vobis esse constitutum
deliberatu^q. huc adlaborare consilia vestra, ta^ sum persuasus, etc.

Sed quem fin^m in communi habetis, ab eo etc. videmini aberrasse.


And that you my brethren are thus determined and resolved bending all your
counsels to this end; I am as strongly persuaded, as he that is most. But the
end which you have in common, alas for grief, in this particular case (pardon
if I speak more freely, for ye would have me to speak) from it ye seem to
have erred. For herein, if I see any thing, the contemplation of your cause
has deceyved you, which thing I trust ye your selves without doubt will mark
if ye would go a little from that your particular sense A causa vestra.
from your cause.

I have showed that there is some error in that end. Let us come to the fact.
In the fact ye frame a purgation of your selves. That thing is denied to none,
if there be cause, if measure, if place, if time. But where fore with me
brethren, who do neither hear these accusations of yours; neither if I should
hear them, would I receive them rashly? Wherefore in public? where ye know
that it falls out for the most part, that they who purge them selves, before
they be accused, either bewray themselves, or raise suspicio^s against
themselves more easily the^ they can afterward wash away. Ye know that the
public voice is neither a just judge oftentimes, nor at any time almost a
lawful Judge; so greatly does evil prevail and bear sway in the public.
Therefore ye appeal to these Judges, who can neither judge, not take
knowledge: finally, they are not only no Judges, but not so much as witnesses:
so the private cause is not furthered, and the public is many ways hindered.
Ye will say the^, who shall be? What judges, what witnesses shall we call upon?
Your own preface shall answer ye for me. For when, ye pronu^ce that ye have
found a place of rest by the mercy of God in these places (ye do acknowledge I
think your own words) ye plainly signify two things. One, that if ye have
found a place of rest, ye shall do wisely, if ye do not stir, where ye may
be in quiet. The other that where you have a lodging, and a quiet seat that
there in deed you must receive the judgment of your doctrine and faith, if ye
will have the same lawfully known and approved. Ye are in a Church furnished
with the servants of God, whose piety, learning, and brotherly love to the
members of Christ good men do know. It is an unlawful course verily, to omit
those among whom ye are and to call upon an other Church, or the whole publik
state, Aut Academiam hanc.
or this University, or me who am a weak member therein, either in part, or in
common. This order is godly, just, lawful, and tends to peace, and
edification, which you ought first, modestly to have regarded, and to which I
being a weak brother, am bounden by brotherly duty, to recall my brethren,
that go astray, and not to be carried headlong, and to rush upon the knowledge
of things by this means offered; besides all equity and good order. Till ye
shall do this, I admonish, exhort, pray, and beseech by the most sacred and
holy name of Christ, that ye would not call upon me, neither any other, neither
the public it self: for by this preposterous course (as we may so say) ye do
not disburthen your selves, as ye think, of envy and blame (if there be any)
but ye do with suspicion and praejudice burden your own cause, Cui ego
quide^ nullu^ praejudiciu^ facio, religiose dico coram Domino.
which I verily do not prejudice at all, I speak it religiously before the Lord.
Let them speak first, with whom ye soiourne, whom ye deny not to be your
brethren. But if peradventure they shall not satisfy you, or ye shall not
satisfy them, then let a new course be taken by lawful order* This no good
man will deny, but till this be attempted, it will be unprofitable to you, and
hurt full to the Church, to take another course. But neither I, nor my
Colleagues, nor other wise men, will ever be so unwise as to prevent or take
this thing out of the hands of them, to whom the knowledge thereof does of
right appertain. And so much of the doctrine.

I come to the accusation which ye use against the Church of England, as ye
write. In this accusation beloved brethren, I do lovingly entreat you, that
ye would not take it in ill part, if I do admonish ye of a few things which
I think, I may of right do. First, what need is there, that ye should accuse
them? Ye have given place, ye have (as we may so speak) passed over into
another Court: Wherefore you have given place, no body desires to know, or
does trouble you. If wrong be done you in England (that I may grant there was
done: it belongs not to me, Vt them ^irisse facta^.
to affirm or deny who have not known it) yet this injury has ceased to
prosequute you being departed from them. What compels you to be moved, and
to take upon you, the burden of accusation? Why are ye not quiet being
without the danger of any hurt? Why do ye not rather pass over the injury
that is past? Why do ye not bear it (if there be yet any) in silence and
hope, rather then to move that which is in rest? It is plainly a Christian
part, if thou bear it, and a prudent part, if thou abstain from stirring the
evil that is well appeased, an impotent thing, if thou do contrariwise.
Impotens.


And to what end I pray you is it? To the end that you might purge your selves?
But here is no man that does repeat anew, or lay these accusations against
you. Wherefore serves this purgatio^? that ye may be even with them against
whom ye complain? But this is not the part of a Christian. I do not think
that this is your meaning. Is it to reform them? This indeed is an holy
endeavor. But if ye could not do this when ye were present, consider what
ye can do when ye are absent. But first of all consider with your selves, by
what means ye take this way, namely to accuse to me, to others, to the
public, in the theater of the Church, in the circle of the world* Ah beloved
brethren, was it ever heard of, that any private man (to say nothing of a great
community) was ever amended by this course Further consider I pray you before
whom ye bring these things. I will speak of my self, to whom alone ye would
commit this your little book; I know not whether in this your little book ye
call upon me, as an intercessor, or examiner, or a Judge. For if as an
intercessor, were it not better that your co^plain^s were kept secret, then
laid open (which tends to reproach) and the Church of Christ, innumerable
souls, weak, strangers, to be beaten with the types of your impression. It is
most manifest, that they against whom ye deal, will be more provoked Hoc gravi
aculeo.
by this grievous sting If as an examiner, by what right can I do it? who have
no lawful authority from God, from the Church, from the Magistrate, or from
both the parties: neither if it should be committed, would I easily accept it;
I am so privy to my self, of my own insufficiency; for who am I? or what am
I? that I should be able, thoroughly to see every particular thing, concerning
you, and them, which are required to a just examination. And this the right
course of examination does require, otherwise (as Seneca wisely says) he that
judges one party being not heard, albeit he judges that which is right, yet
he is unjust. Ye are not a little deceived in this your judgment beloved
brethren: Ye almost do me an injury, when ye call me to be a busy body, or
think that I will take upon me the part of an examiner, or (that which is more
subject to envy and far from duty) of a Judge. And brethren, that which I
say of my self, think that is the answer of the other brethren Qui vbiuis
locorum sunt.
which are any where else in Churches and Universities. No wise man will rashly
go down these steps, or clime up to this seat of judgment. In deed
concerning your faith and doctrine something may be said, if you expound it,
and if the thing be done in order. But touching the accusation of your
cou^treymen and of mattets passed to and fro; no wise man by my consent, will,
Hac lege.
on this condition take upon him the burden of judging.

And for Gods sake, consider the event of this fact. For I pray you whom would
it profit if that were done which ye desire? Certainly neither would it profit
you nor the^, nor these with whom ye soiourne, nor the Church of God.
Contrariwise whom would it not hurt? This thing would set you more on fire: Res
ista vos magis inflamma^^t, prout contentiones magis f^rv^ facere solent quo
moventur magis. Illos magis abaliena^et, quos iniquius abalienatos a vobis esse
ob^enditis, etc.
as contentions are wont the more to make hot, the more they are stirred. It
would more alienate them whom ye pretend to be to injuriously enstranged from
you: For this is not the way of teaching, nor of informing, nor of seeking
reconciliation. It would rent asunder the good men whose hospitality ye do
now commodiously use either from you, or amongst themselves (which duty they
have not deserved of you by their hospitality,) It would set a more grievous
fire on the whole Church, and spread through all her joints, which God turn
away. And that Imprude^^m.
unwise man which should usurp this authority, it would make a scorn to ill
tongues, while good men would pity his vain labor and your expectation.
Lastly (that I may also add this, and mark brethren, how sincerely and
brotherly I deal with you) albeit I might and would lawfully give sentence
both of your faith which ye declare, and also of the fact of accusation which
ye bend against your countrymen: Yet ye by this course and manner of dealing
have taken from me the authority of doing that which ye require touching your
fact; your selves by this manner of request do hinder your own desire. Ye will
marvalle perhaps at that which I say, and yet it is so. For you do so require
my judgment as you do also with all require the judgment of all Universities
and Students. If you request this in common; then you do not desire that I
should do it alone: but if particularly, do you think that any of us will be
so mad, that when the judgment of so many good men and diligence is desired,
some one Palamon should take upon him the chiefest parts: and should by him
self speak of that thing, which is required of so many as learned, yea better
learned, and better furnished with pi^^ie, judgment, and experience, which
requires a serious consultation, an holy communication, and a ripe inoffensive
judgment.

But now of the third thing what shall I say? Ipsi opinor, fratres charissimi,
animadvertitis, si de antecedentibus illis duobus capitibus nec possum ea lege,
nec debeo respo^sum dare, id plane iniquu^ fore si de ea conclusione, etc.
your selves I think, beloved brethren, do mind that if I cannot on this
condition, neither ought, to give answer concerning the two points a foresaid*
it would be utterly unjust if I should as yet determine any thing on either
side towching the conclusion which you draw from thence, that is, from those
premises. But I verily suspe^d my judgment, brethren I suspend my judgment
in this cause, even as God and nature, and reason, and al laws command me to
do. Ye know I think the causes by these things which ye have now read, and shall
learn besides by other things which God shall minister unto you (I hope) by the
spirit of truth and wisdom. I ought not to judge with my self of matters
unknown, at least not so evident, neither yet with such forward boldness to
pronounce among you or others, the matter being not sufficiently manifest to my
self. God knows and judges, Cui stant.
to whom stand or fall as many as are his servants. Otherwise I trust ye are
not ignorant that there are three things which eue^ from the very infancy of
the Church, the holy fathers would have to be distinguished by the word of God,
among the people of God, namely, faith or doctrine, conversation or manners,
and the order of discipline. And all wise men have taught this with one
consent, and delivered it to posterity, that where the foundation of the truth
of doctrine remains, which is the pillar of salvation, although with most
corrupt manners and discipline, there the Church remains, and that no man
ought rashly to separate himself from that Church (whiles he may tarry in it
without ship wrack of faith and conscience) or take from it the name of a
Church, especially seeing every Church consists of Pastors and flock, which
if some Pastors or Prelates trouble, yet it is unmeet that this name either
should be taken away from the other Pastors, which Christ does witness by the
doctrine of truth, or from the flock which Christ has purchased with his own
blood, and does daily sanctify with the washing of the new birth by the
word. This ought to be sufficient for you if any thing have offended you at
home, quod jam. etc.
that now the fatherly and merciful providence of God has provided for you
elsewhere. Certainly whiles ye inueigh against those Churches, ye shall make
that your cause never the better, neither more probable with good men: which
thing if ye have not yet considered and conceived by my advise and counsel,
and by the admonition of those which wish you well, experience it self at last
(God grant it be not to late, and he inform you in good) will prove all th^se
things unto you. For by the truth of doctrine, holiness of life, by the work
of faith and patience, and by the duties of charity even toward them of
whom ye profess that ye are wronged, ye shall rather approove your selves
and your cause, the^ by outcryes and publishing of writings, even as our
Savior is said to bring judgment to victory not by filling the streets
with shouting and clamours, but by blowing gently into the smoking flax and
tender handling the bruised reed.

Which things seeing they be so, I beseech you most loving brethren in Christ
by that most holy name of Christ which ye profese, by those bowels mercy,
wherewith Christ has embraced us from on high, that ye would think of
another course, that ye would take another way to salvation, to edificatio^,
to peace. Si consensio est.
If there be consent, shake not your faith, which is not to be winnowed again
by new reasons. This course is suspicious. But if it must needs be sifted, let
it suffice you that it be first approved by those servants of God among whom
ye dwell: this is certainnly a lawful course: Forgive the former injuries if
any have been, by Christian charity to them from whom ye have received the
same, and hide them from others by Christian wisdom. There is no fear, that
by so doing ye should Rumpamini.
be burst: God will enlarge your hearts by the spirit of charity most
co^modiously. Look to your selves that overcomming al sharpness and al
bitterness of mind ye may be acceptable to Christ and profitable to the
Church, and that Odor suavissimus.
the sweet odor of your piety may be spread in speech, in life, in order to
all the godly without the stench of enmity and schism. Judge not that ye be
not judged: But abstain from those heavy determinations and conclusions (as
they call them) against othermen, neither labor either to get Abetters or
partakers in that your former judgment (which would be said in you to be a
spice of faction in them of imprudencie, or else to draw them to an
unseasonable, uncivil, inconvenient and dangerous delivery of opinions. Pity
your selves I beseech you (most loving brethren) and the whole flock which is
gathered among you. Have pity of them whom thorough error and infirmity ye
cry out be hurt. Pity your entertainers among whom it were a most i^iurious
thing that ye should sow these tates, especially being admonished. And it
would be a great indignity by clamours and writings to bread in them
suspicions and sinister opinions, either of your selves or of those your
adversaries (as you count them) or else of both. Finally pity the Church of
Christ, which verily it is not comely, nor expedient neither in any case
tolerable among so many and grievous wounds which are Universe, universally,
or, every where
universally given unto it, to be further galled with this particular wound. So
let God almighty love you and Jesus Christ that most merciful Lord, and our
Savior be merciful unto you. And if I shall be able to do any good in the
public cause and yours, assure your selves that I will spare no diligence, no
labor, no pains, that you with us and all together may be filled with
sa^ctimony (without which none shall se God) with the good things of the Lord in
his house, and before his face. And the God of peace which has raised from the
dead our Lord Jesus that great sheepeheard of the sheep, by the blood of the
eternal covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will,
working in you, that which is acceptable in his sight by Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory for ever and ever, Amen. And I pray you brethren suffer this word of
exhortation, which I have briefly written unto you. The grace of God be with
you all, Amen. From Leyden this Saturday the 9. of January. 1599.

Yours in the Lord Francis Iunius.

The answer to the Letter aforesaid.
To the Reverend and learned Mr. Francis Iunius, our beloved brother in Christ,
At Leyden in Holland.
GRace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
Reverend Sr. and beloved brother in Christ / we have lately received your
letter / which you sent unsealed to the Ministers of the Dutch and french
Churches / that it might first be read of the^ / and them be delyvered to us.
We have also read and weighed it / and thought it meet to write again / partly
to thank you that vouched safe to write unto us: partly to satisfy you (if we
can) in some things wherein we see you are mistaken: In the writing whereof /
we humbly request that speaking freely that which the thing it self requires
you would take it in good part / as you are woo^t. Many things indeed you have
written which we do willingly acknowledge and consent therein with you. Those we
will not touch at all. The rest we will prosequute in the same order / as by
your self ^hey are propounded.

Whereas there was a little book exhibited unto you by one of us / it is not so
to be taken / as if you were called upon alone or apart from others. For the
brother which delyvered you the book certified us / that this passed between
you / that by you it should be communicated with your Colleagues the governors
of that University / and that you took upon you to do it. Now if you have so
done / how is it that you alone write back again? why also do you so often
repeat and seem to reprehend that you / you (we say) alone / apart / are
called upon? If you have not done it / mind then on whom the blame lies that
it is not communicated with the^ in that University / to whom by us it was
dedicated. And we do now again entreat you / that being myndfull of your
promise you would perform it: that so you with the other learned and godly men
and brethren there / may either convynce our faith and cause of error / or else
together with us conted for this says once gyven to the Saints. The one of
these we take it must needs be done. And we gather it by comparing together
Iam. 5.19.12. with Jude ver. 3. This also is the very thing which we did desire
and still do desire in that Epistle dedicatory. And let these things once
spoken / suffyce (we pray you) for the crimination of calling on you apar^,
which in this letter of yours you have so often objected and repeated.

Next you propound three tinges to be considered in the book it self / of
which you promise to speak / briefly and brotherly / what you think.

1. The first head (you say) is of the doctrine, which we profess in our
book. Be it so indeed. Here we expected (because you purpose to write of the
doctrine we profess) that you would have discussed the articles of our faith /
and reproved the errors (if there be any) by the light of Gods word. And who
would not have expected this? But behold / there is not a word of the doctrine
and faith it self. What may this mean? Is it because your self beleeu this
faith to be trew-sound grounded on the word of God and agreeable thereunto? If so
why the^ writing these things / do you not profess it? Why do you dissemble
it? specially / when you hear that this faith is traduced as schism / as
heresy? but you see perhaps that in the doctrine of faith we err from the
truth. If it be so / why then write you / and yet show not the errors? why do
you not (as much as in you is) bring into the way such as do err? Do not when
request is made that the errors may be showed by the light of the holy
Scripture* Certainly your godlynes persuades otherwise: yea / God himself
requires otherwise. Iam. 5.19.20.

Yet now when you touch not the doctrine it self / what is it that you write in
this behalf? Even this only / that you would persuade we have erred herein that
we have publyshed the confession of our faith. First of all this concerns the
manner / not the matter it self. But yet let us weigh your reasons: If (say you)
there be a certain consent of doctrine: then there was no need that we should
set forth a new Confession in this agreement of holy and ancient doctrine. Do
you indeed speak as you think? How is it then that some while since / when the
Germane and French Churches had before publyshed their Confessions of faith /
yet afterward the Belgic / Scottish / and other Churches set forth theirs also
/ notwitstanding that they agreed with them in the holy and anncient doctrine?
Yea tell us (we pray you) what you think of that godly and learned Mr. Beza his
pryvate Confession of faith lately publyshed? Not to speak of many other
written and divulged by many of the martyrs also / in their several ages. Do
not all these agree in the holy and anncyent doctrine of Godlynes? Or should
not therefore these Confessions have been publyshed? What soever you shall say
for them / mind the same also as spoken for us. Secondly you say, if there be
any dissension in doctrine, that ought not to be dissembled, etc. But what is
this to us / who have plainly showed and reckned up the things wherein we
dissent from the Church of England / with whom we have to do in this behalf?
Neither that only / but have also in our Confession not obscurely signified /
concerning the things wherein the other Churches of this city and ours as yet
do not agree.

After these things / you come to discuss the end and fact of our publyshing
this Confession. Touching the end, we have showed it in the epistle and preface
set before the book it self. And we answer further / that we did this to the
same end / that all the reformed Churches of late did publysh theirs. For proof
whereof / let the preface of the Harmony of Confessions / compared with ours /
speak for us. If you take away the reasons by both alleged / we yield. But if
you cannot / then see whether both here and other where often in this letter
you do not through our sides strike at all these Churches likewise. Our cause
and clearing, we commyt to God and to all godly that love the truth. Such as
before knew not our cause they may now by this means have knowledge thereof.
Such as be enemies of God / of the Church / of the truth / have nothing by this
book of ours / whereof to rejoice. They will rather be grieved when thus they
shall see Antichrist that man of sin to be more and more discovered / whom
the Lord in the end will wholly consume and abolysh / with the spirit of his
mouth in the testimony (not in the silence) of his servants. 2. These. 2.8. with
Rev. 12.11. and 14 6 7 8. and 20.4. Finally / such as be weak and by reason of
the stink of schisms know not the true body of Christ whereunto they should
join themselves / they may by this means be better instructed and induced
more certainly to know and embrace the true Church and faith of Christ. Thus
desire we that the publyck good of the Church be holy forward / that Christ
may have the preeminence over all. And thus have we spoken of the end / in
which as yet we see not any mistaking or error.

Touching the fact, we answer in like manner as before concerning the end. Yea
and the things which here you bring / for not doing it in publyck / you may
urge the very same likewise against all the reformed Churches / against
Athanasius, Origin, Augustine, Tertullian, and others of the fathers / against
Zuinglius, Luther, Calvine, Beza, and many other of these ages / godly men /
and diverse of them also Martyrs of Jesus Christ: who have set forth in publyck
their Confessions of faith private their apologies complaynts / disputations /
yea and their letters concerning matters in religion publyckly controverted.
But these things perhaps came not in your mind / whiles there was before your
eyes only the contemplation of our particular cause: which thing your self (we
trust) will perceive / if you turn your eyes a little from us unto others
approved by your self. Moreover howsoever the evil (whereof you write) do
prevayte in publyck: yet always and every where wisdom is justified of her
children / as Christ has taught / Mat. 11.16.19. And this shall suffice us and
all that are godly. Lastly / in a case of such weight and necessity / who
should rather be called upon then the students of the holy Scriptures in
Christian vniversityes? Who (we pray you) are esteemed to be of better or
sounder judgment? Whom does it more concern to take knowledge / of the truth
and errors in religion? Who should better instruct in the truth / or convince
falshoold? And to conclude / who can or ought to attend more to the discussing
of these things?

But you object / that seeing we have here found place of rest, here also we
must receive the judgment of our doctrine and faith, if we will have the same
lawfully known and approved, etc. Here come many things to be considered.
First what if the rest and breathing / which here we enjoye / come unto us /
not by the Ministers (of whom you speak) but by the Magistrates: which we do
always and every where acknowledge with thanckes. Secondly what if these
ministers (men indeed learned and wise) should be of the same mind with you /
that they would not hear or speak any thing concerning our faith and cause:
inasmuch as they would not be either intercessours, or examiners, or Judges?
Furthermore / what if our Confession of faith have been exhibited to them above
three years since / that by them it might either be approved / or the errors
(if there be any) convinced? What if some of them have denounced us as
heretics and schismatics? What if they have received certain articles full
of lies and sclaunders / spread abroad against us / and yet to this day have
not gyven us a copy of them / no though they were desired? What if upon
occasion offered we have dealt with them touching certain corruptions yet
remaining in their Churches / which notwithstanding they would not so much as
acknowledge? And finally / what if we after the concealing and not regarding of
all these things / have now again this last year delyvered them the
Confession of our faith in writing / before it was put forth in print? You see
what we could answer in this behalf: but we would rather have burned these
things in forgetfulness / if you had not so urged us as from you they might not
now be concealed. Pardon you therefore and let them also (we entreat) pardon us
/ that we speak freely: for you would have us speak / yea you constreyne us
against our will to write these things / which we would have covered in silence
/ hoping hereafter for better. Besides these / we answer also that in the
preface before our Confession is signified / that not here only but almost
every where we are traduced as heretics / and schismatics: and that therefore
it concerned us / to declare our faith and cause not to these only but unto
all. The very thing which before us on like occasion (as is aforesaid) both
dyvers of the ffathers have don of old / and in later wines almost all the
reformed Churches / and of the Martyrs not a few.

And hitherto of your reasons alleged against the publyshing of our our
faith: Which how weak they are now judge your self. But suppose they were strong
/ and that therefore herein we had erred / that our Confession came forth in
publyck: yet now it is publyshed / the errors (if any be found in it) are
certeynly to be showed and convinced by the word of God.

Otherwise you may easily gather that we shall be more confirmed in this faith.
And seeing you (Learned Sr.) do purposely write concerning the Doctrine which we
profess / and yet show not any one error in the Doctrine: consider well what
you have done. Will you be ready to help them who err (as you think) in the
manner and circumstances? and will you afford no help at all in the matter and
faith it self? Far be this from you from your godlynes learning / wisdom /
charity. And thus much of the first point which you noted concerning doctrine.

2 The second head is of the fact whereof (as you say) we accuse the Englysh
Churches. Here also we expected / that you would have discussed those four
points / which are particularly rehearsed in the preface of this book / and
which we showed to be done and used by / them daily in their divine worship:
for which also we testified that we are banished and have departed from them.
But of these neither / have you not one word And yet this was the special fact
/ which we noted for to be considered in that Church. That other of the Prelates
tyranny and persecution of us / we touched but by the way and in a few words.
We marvel therefore / yea and greatly marvel that these things which directly
concern the matter and cause it self / should thus every where be let pass by
you / who yet pretend to bring into the way such as do err. But les us see
nevertheles what the things are which you do here so much urge.

The first is / that those Churches from which we have departed, should not by
us be accused About the word accusation we will not contend: Only this we say
/ we use it no^ (that we remember) except when we treat of our own cause who
by them are accused of heresy schism sedition etc. Of which for as much as we
are accused among them / here and every where: what good man will deny unto us
place of defense: But you say / no man desires to know why we came thence, and
that the injury also has left to prosequute us being departed from them How
these things escaped you we marvel. For in both of them you write other wise
then the thing is. For both many do daily desire to know why we came thence /
and the injury has prosequuted us being departed / into this place to this
very day Of the former we need cite no witnesses: for they are almost infinite.
Of the latter / besides the Latin books publyshed at home by our own
contreymen / besides the libels which they have sparsed against us in this city
besides the sclaunders wherewith then do also pursue us every where: besides
all these (we say) the Ministers them selves of the Churches Dutch and French
both here at Amsterdam and at Dordrecht are able to testifye* they have
received (as we said before) certain articles full of lies and sclaunders /
written against us / and yet still they have them for ought we know* Moreover /
if none of these things had fallen out openly before the world yet who knows
not that Antichrists retinew (such as be the Prelates) do still resemble the
nature and conditions of the Dragon / who out of his mouth cast waters like a
flood after the woman / that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood
whom being present he could not devour. Rev. 12. and 13 chap.

As for that you annexe of concealing injuryes, it has been observed by us / as
much as we could. For neither have we in particular related them / neither can
we if we would. We have noted only in general / that these Prelates have done
the very things / which the Scripture foretold should by the Beast and
Antichrist be committed Neither are we in this kind of writing either the first
/ or alone. Thus heretofore have many of the servants of God written / who in
their several countries have been many ways ve^ed by Antichrist. Neither that
only / but they have also noted down the particular persons / names / places /
times / martyrdomes / causes / actions / injuryes. Search (if you please) the
ecclesiastical writers almost of everye age: search the Acts and momments of
the martyrs / in this country in ours / in Scotland / in France / in the other
countries almost all here about: yea search the Acts of the Apostles / and see
if such particular historyes be not there also recorded. Yet further / tell us
(we pray you) if this course had been held by all / which you seem to exact of
us: from whence then could you or any other have that knowledge and evidence, as
now is had / of the fulfilling (throughout several ages / of those prophecyes
which are in the Scriptures / of the Beast / of the false Prophet / of
Antichrist / of his mystery / exaltation / tyranny / merchants discovery / fall
/ etc. How should from their own Acts / the adversaryes mouths be so stopped
/ as now we see / hear and read / is daily done by the martyrs and servants of
Christ? Lastly / how could your self and other learned men have so expounded
that divine book of the Revelation (not to speak of other Scriptures likewise
interpreted) as you have now already done / which great fruit / and gratulation
of all the godly?

Of the end which here again you urge / we have spoken both before in this
letter / and in the epistles prefixed to the book it self. Add hereunto / that
if the Prelates and other adversaryes of the truth be not by these and the like
wrytinges amended / they shall yet doubtless be made the more vnexcuseable.
The visard also by which they have deceyved you (as it seems) and almost all
others / was to be pulled of. But this could not be done for the knowledge of
all (as was mee^) otherwise then by publyck writing. To omytt others / we
appeal unto your conscience (learned S.) whether you did think the estate of
that Church and of those Prelates to be such in any measure touching their
Antichristian constitution / leitourgy / ministry / Hierarchy (which your self
acknowledge to be that other beast / in Rev. 13, 11.18.) as now for certain you
hear and see it in that book as it were painted out before your eyes. But of
these things enough is said in the book it self Surely these and the like their
unfruitful works of darkness / were to be reprooved / not dissembled / not
allowed: Ephesians. 5.11. Reb. 18.6*7 Ier. 50.14.
especyally seeing they are so stiffely by them retained / defended / urged: and
that under a pretense of the Gospel / with which they have no more agreement
then darkness has with light / Beliall with Christ. Neither is this to take up
burdens of Accusations, but to take away the visard of Antichristian apostasy
/ and to witness the truth of Jesus Christ against Antichrist. which duty our
Lord and Savior Christ requires of you / of us / of all the godly: the Lord
(we say) who in these latter times has begun to discover that lawles man of
sin / and will at length consume him with the spirit of his mouth / by the
word of the testimony of his servants. So far of is it / that they should be
accounted busy bodies, which perform this duty to Christ: or that we herein
have don you any injury. So far of also is it / that we should think what you
speak of your self, the same to be answered us by the rest of the brethren
that are any where else in Churches, in Vniversityes. Not to speak of others /
we know that Mr. Beza that worthy servant of God has in causes not much unlike
answered otherwise. But of this matter more herafter. In the mean time (that
we also may deal syncerely and brotherly with you) mind we pray you / whether
you have not done your self injury / whiles you have climed into this seat so
confident^^ to pronounce that of others* whereof (as we think) you cannot any
way have certain knowledge: yea whiles you alone determyne of that matter /
which (to use your own words) requires serious consultation and holy
communication.

Touching the event, we commit it to God / who (we certeynly hope) will worck
al these things for good both to us / and to the^ by whom we are exiled and to
these among whom we sojorne / and to the Church of God every where. And to
whom (we pray you) would it not be good / if that were done / which we des^er?
ffor our selves, if we err / let the righteous smite and reprove us / it
shall be a benefyt and precious ointment unto us. For our adversaries, if they be
the more estraunged / it shall be their own fault not ours / nor theirs that
shall godlyly and freely testify what they see in this cause: And who knows
/ whether by this means they may be brought to consider more then heretofore
both of the unlawful constitution of that Church / and of their outrageous
cruelty: and thereupon seriously endeavor a godly redressing of the former /
and an utter repressing of the latter? For the good among whom we sojourne,
they shall have better knowledge of our faith and cause: they may also grow up
together more strongly in the truth of the Gospel / whiles thus they are
stirred up more carefully to endeavor that the corruptions wherewith their
Churches yet are faulty may be duly abolyshed / and whiles such as are seduced
by the errors of the Papists / Anabaptists / and other heretics troubling
these Churches are upon this occasion drawn from such estate and stirred up to
search / know / and embrace the truth of Gospel. Finally for the whole
Church, we hope it shall hence also receive much profyt / if this faith and
cause (which now a long time has been condemned for schism and heresy) if
also that Antichristian Apostasy (which now a long time under the visard of
godlynes has deceived the world in the mystery of iniquity) if these things we
say / being of so great moment / be examyned and discussed by the canon of the
Scriptures / of so many and so worthy men furnyshed with learning / godlynes
judgment / wisdom. And thus much of the second point which was concerning the
fact.

The third (you say) is of the conclusion inferred upon comparing together the
doctrine and fact aforesaid. Here first you affirm / you with^^ould your self
in suspense in this cause. Be it so. It is God that can reveal this also unto
you / and persuade your conscience by his Spirit and word. Then you annex some
things concerning the doctrine and consent of the fathers and all wise men in
all ages: but you propound them so doubtfully that (as touching our cause) we
cannot perceive what your meaning is. Your words may so be understood / as we
most willingly consent with you in this matter: again / they may be so taken /
as we dissent from you not a little nor without cause. We are persuaded / that
separation should not be made from any Church either rashly / or at all so long
as we may remain with sound faith and conscience. You must therefore speak more
plainly / what you think of our separation if you suppose we have erred in
this behalf: all those things being discussed by the word of God / which we
have menc^oned in the preface and Confession aforesaid. In the mean time hear
and ponder well (we pray you) what Mr. Beza that learned man and well deserving
of the Church of Christ has written and publyshed some while since concerning
this question. Thus he has in his epistles publyshed / in the right epistle
sent to Ed: Grir dall heretofore P^elate of London wherein writing of the state
and corruptions of the Church of England he says, If it be true which is
commonly reported, and whereof my self am not yet persuaded, that private
Baptism is there permitted to women, I see not what is to turn back again
from whence men came, if this be not: etc But if those things ^e true, which I
think are not lykely, to wit, that the Metropolytanes retain in use those
most fil^hy abuses (then which the Church of Antichrist has not any thing more
intolerable) namely, pruralyties of benefyces, lycences of non residency,
l^cences to mary and eat flesh, and other the like: this were cert^nly (which I
speak with horror) not a corruption of Christianity, but a manifest defection
from Christ: and therefore they not to be condemned* but commended rather, which
oppose them selves to such endeavors, etc. These and many other the like
sayings he has in his epistles and other books publyshed. Now as touching the
things which he thought not to be so much as lykely, we know them to be most
true: neither these only but almost an hundredth the like / as we have touched
in the preface of our Confession. Among which we bes^ec^ you consider these
three specially (yet so as you turn not your eyes away from the rest) the
confirmation of such a^ have be^^ baptized (when now they are waxen older)
administered by the Prelates themselves unto this day: Their holy Orders of
Clergy: The discipline and sanctions of the Cannon Law (as they call it) yet
retained in that Church: and tell us (we pray you) freely and syncerely / what
now you think of the estate of that Church / and of our separation. ^erily (if
we conceive you right) your self expound the mark, the name, and the number of
the name of the Beast, to be understood of these, three last aforesaid
abhomynations of Antichrist: In your exposition of Rev. 13. ver, 16.17.18. And
to receive these / you know also well i^ forbidden unto all under pain of
eternal damnation. Rev. 14.9.10 11. and 18.4.5.

But to return to M. Beza again / in him there are many things (concerning
our cause) to be carefully observed: first / that his private epistles he set
forth in publyck: secondly / that in t^^ he di^ not dissemble / but freely and
ingeniously declare his judgment of the estate of the Church of England:
thirdly that yet he was n^ busibody* or unwise which would clime into th^^
seat / or by provoking that church made his cause the worse with good me^ etc.
fourthly / if there were nothing else yet by this we may well think / that what
you say of your self / is not the answer of the other brethren which are in any
place in Churches and Vniversityes: lastly that he should not have burst, if he
had dissembled these things / nor yet while he wrote the godly and faithfully /
was factious uncivil, or sowed any ^a^es, but have witness to the truth of the
Gospel of Christ and did truly show that ^e trod in the steps of the Apostle
who writes and testifyet thus of himself and of all the faithful servants of
Christ / we cannot ^o any thing against the truth, but for the truth. 2 Cor.
13.8 But these things by the way: Yet so as you may well consider with your
self (beloved Brother) whether the things which here and there in your letter
you seem to insinuate against us fall not upon the very head of that most godly
man Mr. Beza by like right or rather indeed by like wrong. Of other like godly
and learned (...) we will not now speak: it shall suffice here to have
mentioned him / alone. And where you seem to acknowledge for true Pastors the
Prelates and Priests by the^ created (such as the English ministry is known to
be) mind how well you have done this and how agreably with the Spirit of God /
which calls such / Locusts, false Prophets, the whores merchants / etc. But
touching that which you speak of Christ our Savior how he brought judgment to
victory, not by crying out and filling the streets with clamours, but by
blowing softly upon the smoking flax and handling tenderly the bruised reed.
This we do indeed most willingly acknowledge / and pray that we may always
follow this his most sacred example. Nevertheless / this also must be
remembered that Christ dealt after one manner with the weack (of whom here the
speech is) after an other with the * Scribes and Pharisees and other the like
sworn enemies of the truth: Mat. 16.3.4 and 23. cap.
such as at this day be the Prelates and their accomplices: which who is it that
does not know? who is it that does not acknowledge. The same also may be see^ in
the Apostles of Christ and in their dealing with Simon Magus, Elymas,
Hymenaeus, Alexander, Philetus, Diotrephes, etc.

Which things being so we humbly beseech you (reverend and beloved Sr. by that
most holy name of Christ / which you profess / by the mercyes of God wherewith
he has loved us in Christ / that you would thnik of another course (then such
as yet it seems you allow) that you would take an other way for discovering
and destroying the defection of Antichrist for setting forward the salvation
edificatio^ and peace both of us and others. Hold on to defend the true faith
(as now a good while you have done with great praise and fruit of the godly)
and discover errors: maynteyne good causes and forsake evil: Strive for
Christ and the truth of his Gospel / and fight against Antichrist and the
remnants of his Apostasy. Let it be manifest to all / what your mind and
judgment is / not only concerning the faith of Christ / but also concerning the
mystery / Apostasy / and iniquity of Antichrist: ffinally / as touching our
selves in special / if you write again / we do humbly and earnestly entreat /
if any where we have erred in our faith and choose / that you vouchsafe to show
it us by the light of Gods word* Otherwise it will be suspected / seeing you
bestow so much pains in discussing these things which concern the manner and
not the matter it self that either you do dissemble your judgment (what soever
it be) or that in very deed you are of the same mind with us: specially seeing
now you have written / that you do not any prejudice at all to our cause, and
have spoken this religiously before the Lord.

Pity^ (we pray you) our Church, here exiled every where reproched / eaten up
in a manner with deep poverty despised and afflicted well nere of al against
which satan has now a long time attempted all utmost extremyties. Pity them,
from whom we have departed, who under pretense of the Gospel contynew still
in Antichristian defection / and do so stifley hold and eagerly maynteyne it /
as there is scant any among them that dare so much as hiss against it. Pity
these Churches (among whom we sejourne) in which wheter you look at the
publyck prayers / or the Administration of the Sacraments / or the execution of
discipline / there be sundry ^a^es, (if they may be called ^ares) or rather
corruptions / and those also not of small moment: at which as is reported the
Anabaptists / and others not a few that lyve here do stumble: of which also we
have heretofore conferred friendly with the ministers of these Churches (men
indeed learned and our brethren beloved) but hitherto we do not accord
therein: yet hope for better consent herafter / by the blessing of God / and
throug the help of you and other godly men. Finally / pity the whole Church of
Christ, which verily it is not meet nor expedient neither indeed ought among so
many and grievous wounds of hers universally inflicted / to be further galled
with this particular wound / that you should not take it in good part to have
by us the true faith of Christ publyshed and the remnants of Antichrists
Apostasy discovered.

And thus have we written freely and boldly unto you / good Sr whom we do
unfeignedly acknowledge to be godly / learned / and well deserving of the Church
of Christ. For we had rather / that men should find fault with our boldness /
then that Christ should reprove us for leaving his cause. Neither doubt we but
your self according to your wonted and commendable humanity / will pardon us
this fault / whereinto we have been drawn / not with a mind to contradict / but
with love of verity and affection of charity. And God himself even our father /
which has loved and called us in Christ / and has given us eternal
consolation and good hope through grace / fulfill in you all the gracious
pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power / that the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you / and you in him. The grace of our
God and Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

Mr. Iunius his second Epistle.
To his beloved brethren the English people at Amsterdam. Grace and peace from
the Lord.
YOur Letters (loving Brethren) I received yesterday and read. If your
messe^ger had showed me before, to whom, or whither I should have written,
the matter had been other wise carried: but I sought and waited a whole month,
being uncertain to whom I might send. If any thing were done otherwise then we
would, it was your own fault. That ye give no place to false suspicion, I did
nothing without the knowledge of my brethren and Colleagues. To you I gave
counsel: if it please you not, you may let it alone for me: it becomes not
us to be contentious: for it is not our custom, nor the custom of the
Churches of God. Now that Messenger of yours spoke only to me, without
letters, and called not on any of my Colleages: What the^ is the blame you lay
upon me? Nemo vetuit ut solus consilium darem.
none forbad me to give counsel alone. You asked indeed about a matter of
faith, but we thought good rather to deal about giving you co^sell. What? if
a man answer not according to your prescript, is it by and by an injury? Give
us leave, brethren, I pray you, to use our own judgment: we thought it fitter
to give you counsel, then to make an answer to your demaundes, and that this
we might do unto you in brotherly duty. If we might not, Si non licuit
nobis, at nos aequiores erimus erga vos: licet per nos abstinere, literas licet
descindere, etiam nobis dissimulaturis.
yet will we be more indifferent toward you: you may for us abstain, you
may rent the Letters, and we also will concele it. I wrote as touching
counsel, because I thought there was need of it. I wrote not of the question,
because I thought the time was not for it. Otherwise I had never thought of
you, or your matters, no not so much as in my dream: so greatly do I shun to
be a medler in other men's matters. You will say, why was not the time for it?
Surely because the matter was not clear to me, to have been handled in order,
and good manner: Whereunto by giving you counsel, I called you back. For if you
kept good manner and order, you might have showed it: if you kept it not, you
might have returned unto it and observe it. I knew nothing at all, either by
you, or by any other, which I speak, to the end that you suspect none that is
innocent. Our manner is to make answer in order, to them that ask according
unto order: if any ask not in order, our manner is to call them back to
order, as is meet: yea if any urge us a hundred times besides order: we will
call him back an hundred times unto order; or else by silence take order for
our own quietness and security. Will you therefore take the thing in
question for granted: Pardon me^ (dear brethren:) this is more the^ either
y^ririe or charity does teach. He that speaks a thing different, speaks
neither this not that De questione.
of the question: but he who upon advice does speak a different thing, does
defer his judgment, giving sentence on neither side If you will not permit
me to do this, which every man may lawfully do, Vnum mili assumam pro jure
meo, silentium, etc.
I will take this one thing as my right, to keep silence, that I may free my
speech from cauillations. He that shall say Qui me confessum dixerit in
veritatem impinget sciens.
I confess the thing, shall wittingly offend against the truth.

Others have set forth confessions. I know it, and I commend it: for either
they seemed and were said to stagger in the hands of their persecutors, or else
Religione adducti.
moved of conscience they did it orderly with the consend and approbation of
the Church: but he who writes with a mind to dissent, writes against order,
and sifteth the soars of the Church against the law of charity. But you
profess, that if there be any dissension, you do not dissemble it* Surely in
your confession I see no token whereby I may be certainly persuaded of it. Have
me excused: my senses are to dull to smell out things that are so secret. And
yet now I thank you eue^ for this, that you acknowledge your dissent in some
things from the ministers of the Church of Amsterdam: and I thank God which
moved me to suspend my judgment. Therefore I did well who being altogether
ignorant of your matters, did yet so write that I prevented a thing by you
dissembled, (or at least obscurely set down) by whole some counsel.

The end, which is the clearing of your selves (although I knew nothing of you)
you shall sooner attain in one day by dealing with the Church wherein you are,
then in an hundred year (if you should live so long) by writing to other
Churches Huc illuc.
hither and thither. You do not yet persuade me that you have dealt orderly: if
we stick constantly to order, and you dislike it, at least bear with us. For
whereas you say that you are every where proclaimed heretics, etc. I knew
nothing of you, neither should yet have known any thing if you had held your
peace: so strongly are my ears stopped against al rumors. Of the fact of the
English Churches, I have not certain knowledge: why would you have us speak?
You might have been silent as I admonished you by my letters, and will you not
let us be so? Vos (...) novistis probe, (...) vos (...) potest^s: Se^ in vulga
id peo (...) etc. non potestis.
You may if so be you know the thing so well, have the judgment of it with
your selves: but to publish it among the people, to call for abettors of it,
and to exact like judgment of us you cannot. Keep your confidence to your
selves, and leave us our modesty, who have resolved not to speak of other men's
matters, except we know them thoroughly. You think that other good me^ will
say otherwise, but I think better of them who in my persuasion are furnished
with knowledge, skill, and wisdom from heaven, that they would sooner
subscribe to our modesty, then to this your judicial confidence. To look to
the event, is a point of wisdom: which if you regard not, I pray God the
author of all wisdom to give you discretion.

Touching the conclusion, (Brethren) what shall I say otherwise then I have
said? I verily have resolved neither for you, nor for any mortal man to be
headie and inconsiderate in judging: especially when it neither belongs to me
to do it, neither can it be done with any fruit. If you can do it rightly,
we do not hinder you: but let us who cannot, profess this one thing to you,
that we can be no judges. Touching others whom we know, we have spoken else
where: but touching them, because we know the^ not, Ne adhue quidem dicimus.
we do not yet speak. Concerning Beza (how excellent a man) that which you
often say, take heed Brethren, you be not deceived. He spoke by way of
supposition, which you express in your letters: we, because we see, and
experience does teach us, that his words being spoken by way of supposition,
are understood of many as spoken simply, dare not so much as answer by way of
supposition. Is this such an heinous and capital fault with you? be it far
from you Brethren, be it far from you to take that course with good men,
which God, reason, and the times have taught us to be dangerous. Rash and
headie judgments are not to be required, not to be endured, not to be heard.
That God of truth might justly punish us, if casting a side discretion (which
is most needful in these times) we should answer always to all questions
according to the laws prescribed by such as propounde the same. These three
things according to God and under him are a law to us, verity, charity, and
discretion. If any one of these bewanting, we are afraid to offend. We crave of
you (brethren) that at least, you would leave us this our religious fear,
till all things be made more plain and easy unto us: and if you think your
selves more strong in judging, bear with us as with weak ones, til by godly
quietness and holy study, we may attain to more high and certain things.
That which we may do, truly, godlily, brotherly, wisely, we will never be
slack to do, if we may profit you and the Church of Christ. The Lord
furnish you (beloved Brethren) with his Spirit, and direct you to verity and
charity in holy wisdom and faith to the glory of his name, the edification
of his body, and obtaining of your own salvation, Amen.

Leyden, Wednesday, the 10 of March. 1599. Yours unfeignedly, Fran Iunius.

The answer to Mr. Iunius his second Letter.
To the learned and our beloved Brother in Christ Mr. Francis Iunius at Leyden
in Holland.
GRace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Revere^d Sr.
your letters were delyvered us: which when we had read / we thought thus with
our selves: If we write again / it will be thought perhaps ^ontentious if we
hold our peace it may prove hurtful to the truth. What is then to be done? We
must absteyne from contending / yet so as the truth be not forsaken for which
the Apostle exhorts even to ^omesty. Thus then (worthy Sr.) receive our
answer briefly. Jude ver* ^
In that you did nothing in this matter, without the knowledge of your brethren
and Colleagues, we therefore give you thanckes: for now you have had
consultatio^ together / yet show you nor any one error in our faith and cause.
Touching that we rested not in your counsel, we had many and weighty reasons
so to move us which we signified to you in our former letters / but you have
her^ in silence passed by them. Until you take them away / we think it cannot
be showed that in this matter we have done any thing otherwise then in good
manner^ and order meet and needful. Publyck infamy requires public apology.

Others that have set forth their Confessions, are by you acknowledged and
commended We belyke only have offended in so doing: and that which every Church
man lawfully do (and almost every man upon just cause) yet to us and our Church
you will not permit it. So indifferent are nou toward us. Neither when they
set forth their Confessions did the whole. Ca^holick Church consent: and if you
speak of ^^e consent and approba^^on of a particular Church / so also was our
Confession publyshed But they wrote dissenting from the Church of Rome and the
like / being moved of conscience. And the very same thing have we likewise done
/ dissenting from a daughter of the Romysh Church / touching her Leitourgy /
hierarchy / constitution to wit the Church of England. Yet they thus writing
neither wrote against order, nor sifted the soars of the Church against the
law of charity. No^no^ we neythre And touching: he dissension not conceal,
what need we write otherwise then as before we have done? It is with the Church
of England / that we had and still have to deal in this behalf: and that
difference we did by name and under certain h^ad^^ particularly relate: as both
the thing it self and our exile did necessarily require. Now although in some
things we* differ from the ministers of these Churches / yet were they not
before they despise admonition to be dealt with There (...) one conditi^n of a
fa^e church ^^other of a (...) (though co^rupted) ^ven till it despise
admonition
in like sort. Else you might indeed some what rightly urge order and the law
of c^^rity, if their names and pe^uliar description of that difference had be^
by us particvlarly specifyed in that book. Nevertheles whosoever know and
consider the practice of these ^hurches (and of such only we speak) they may by
that practice and our Confess^on compared together pe^ceive there is difference
between them and us Yea we know that some have so observed. Otherwise if it be
as you pretend that in our Confession you see not a^y token whereby you may*
^e^ certainly persuaded there of* how is it that in so great agreement they
should by so many be judged as true Churches in the right faith we as
heretics? Besides that even by this you do also grannt that you see not but
they consent in one with us / touching the corruptions of the Church of
England, and our separation from them: seeing he that has but half an eye man
there see these most plainly propounded. In which behalf we give thancks both
to you / and to God that has brought you to give this judgment and testimony,
For this is the very thing wherein we desired your opinion. And by this
appears also how needful it was for us to set forth the Confession of our
faith / as now we have done in respect of the Church of England with which we
have to do and from which for that we dissent / we are accused as heretics
and schismatics / ill reported of and dryven into crile.

Touching the end, fact, and event, they being all in our former letters
discussed / we will now speak no more of them again: save this only / that in
the Preface besides other things we noted this / that we therefore publyshed
the Confession of our faith / to the end the truth of God (what lay in us)
might be cleared from reproach of men / and that others might be brought
together with our selves to the same knowledge and fellowship of the Gospel. Of
the like wrytings and acts of others / approved by all the godly we need say
nothing. Neither will we speak more of the many and grievous afflictions which
for this faith now a long time we have sustained. Only we will mention (because
you do thus urge us again) a little book written by your self of your own
life. In which you relate many troubles and afflictions which heretofore you
have suffered for religion sake / being pursued by the enemies of Christ and
his truth. Vita D.F. Iunij, publyshed in the year 1595
Now if any should object against you / That many godly men knew not these
things concerning you) neither should yet have known them if you ^ad held your
peace, that you have given place, and have passed over into another Court, that
former injuryes, if any have been, should by your self be borne in silence and
hope, be forgiven by Christian charity, to those from whom you received them,
and hid from others by Christian wisdom, that there is no fear, least by so
doing you should be burst, that every one should rather approve him self and
his cause* by dueryes of piety, and charity, then by outcryes and publyshing of
wrytings, that the adversaries are no^ by this means made better, but more
provoked by such a grievous sting: that you might, if so be you knew the thing
so well, have the judgment of it with your self, and not publysh it abroad,
that you should not take up burth^ens of accusations, nor have judicial
confidence, that it is a point of wisdom, to look to the event: that rash and
heady judgments are not to be required, not to be endured, not to be heard,
etc. If any (we say) should object these things against you which you do
against us: would you not think it were unjustly done of the^? Why then do you
that to others / which you would not have done to your self? Why urge you these
things so unjustly against this Church of Christ and all the members of it*
which has suffered mo afflictions of all sorts / mo reproaches imprisonments /
losses / banishments deaths / then your self and diverse other good men (yea
though your troubles were te^ times doubled) whose particular stories
notwithstanding are written / publyshed / and approved. But we will let these
things pass: for neither do we like this course of aunting / disdayning
wynding away from the point in hand so often used by you in your letters
unworthily: Neither do we deny but your aflictions were as you have related /
heavy and to be lamented which also / if you contynew faith full to the end /
the Captain of our faith and beholder of our warfare will abundantly reward in
the heavens even Jesus Christ / to whom we commytt and commend this whole
cause:

The Conclusion also has been debated before / And now what others think of our
cause we refer to themselves either by silence to be insinuated / or other
wise (as they think best) to be expressed. In the mean time we cannot omit M
Bezaes modest and yet confident judgment: whose supposition, because it is,
known to be of things most true and certa^ne / it is all one as if it had b^n
simply propounded. And thus to collect we are persuaded is neither to deal ^ll
with good men / neither has God, reason or the times ever taught it to be
dangerous. Nay, this rather do all these teach us to be full of danger when
as men are content to wink at the defection and remnants of Antichrist / and do
not so much as by way of sup^osition bear witness to the truth of Christ
against them / being called into^ question. And here (if you please) ponder
with your self the first original of that Antichrist his growth his
exaltation* Bez. epis. 8.
Which Beza considering / judged (...) dangerous / as in the same epistle he
professes / that it puts him ingreat ho^rour and fear, as often as he
thinks of these things, and foreseeth the same or indeed more grievous
punishments to hang over the heads of many people who at first did gladly
re^ive the Go^pell / ^to which now by little and little they fall away. As
touching our selves we are not then who either can or will prescribe la^es
unto others. We are of al men the meanest and weakest. And this w^ do freely
and syncerely profess: and by all means we desire to absteyne from to much
confidence and to follow after an holy modesty. And now of you (learned Sr.)
and of other like godly learned / strong / discreet men / we desire to be
instructed and informed yea to be brought again into the way / if any where we
be found to err in our faith and cause. This also do those three things which
according to God and under him ought to be a law to all men / verity, charity,
and discretion instantly call for at your hands. In which respect we exhort /
pray / and beseech you by the most sacred name of Christ that you come to help
the Lord among the mighty. Religious fear (which in all and every where is
commendable) will nothing hinder this Day it will further rather: whiles we
consider that we are so to fear least we offend / as we do still remember
withal / that God has not gyven us the spirit of fearefulnes / but of
strength and love / and soundnes of mind: that we should not be ashamed of the
testimony of our Lord / neither of them that be his prisoners exiles /
witnesses. 2 Timothy 1.7.8. Pardon (we pray you) that we write thus freely unto
you. The regard of the truth and love of you wringeth it from us. For we are
studious of the truth of God / and also of your name and estimation. If there
be any thing wherein we may be serviceable unto you without hinderance of the
truth and love / you shall command us. And we trust you will require nothing
of us otherwise. Farewell in Christ Jesus: to whom we do heartily commend your
holy and profitable labors and studyes. Amsterdam: the 18, of March 1599.

Yours with entier affection in the Lord: The brethren of the English Church at
Amsterdam / exiles of Jesus Christ.

Another letter of the same Church to Mr. Francis Iunius, wherein their second
aforesaid was included and sent unto him.
HEre included (learned Sir) we send the answer to your second letter (long
since delyvered us) which we wrote the day after we had received yours: not
afterward thought we needed not send it (unless some other occasion were
offered) both because your self intimated as if you would be silent / if we
wrote again / and because in very deed you did in those letters yield us the
cause and answered nothing at all to any purpose / either touching our
Confession of faith which was publyshed / or touching our former letters /
which we sent unto you thereabout. Of all which things / now let the Reader
judge. If you ask / why we changed our purpose / and have now sent you this
letter / which was written so long since: ^o here this little book included
withal / to wit / your letters translated into English and set forth in
print. Whereupon we are constreyned / not only to send these written unto you /
but to set them forth in publyck also in the English tongue. Yet let nothing
here offend you: for it is we / if any / that are injuried yea and the truth it
self: inasmuch as your first letter was publyshed alone / without our answer
which you receyved from us. By whose fault / to what end / with what equity /
mind you well. Sure that Priest which translated yours / writes in his preface
(how truly you know) that your self delyvered the copy of your first letter to
a worshipful knight / of who^ he receved it / and turning it into English
imprinted it, Yet have we not hitherto gyve^ unto any so much as a copy either
of yours or our own: providing (what we could) for your credyt / ye so / as we
neglected our own our selves / and were traduced by others / as now by this
book publyshed will appear unto all. But perhaps in this matter you purposed
one thing / he another. Whatsoever it were / now you cannot but see / how the
Prelates and Priests of our country do so interpret your letters / as if they
had been written against the truth of the Gospel of Christ / which we profess
/ and for defense of the Antichristian Apostasy and tyranny / wherein they
persist. Which thing we leave unto you / to be weighed seriously before the
Lord.

Neither is it to be omitted / that your private letters are set forth in
publyck: yours (we say) who took it so ill that the Confession of faith of this
whole Church should be made publyck: whom these very letters of yours wrote so
much of the publyck view, of publishing the wounds of the Church,
indiscreetly, before so many deadly enemies of God and the Church: of not
offending any one of Christ's disciples of not provoking Churches: of every one
abounding in their own sense, etc. It is marvel if your translatour turn not
your own words upon your self and tell you / that a Christian an humble and
godly mind ought to be otherwise affected, and setting a side the respect of
their own pryvate regard. etc. But this the more unjustly if he made your
letters publyck without your knowledge. Which we indeed at first did suspect:
till we saw your second Epistle come forth some while after the other. Neither
could we well think other wise of the matter / specially seeing you wrote unto
us / that we might rent the letters, and that you also would conceal it. Know
moreover / that in the edition of your letters / there be certain clauses
wherein the translation is not answerable to yours in latin sent unto us: which
we by your original amend in our edition now ready to be published.

These (and many other things which yet we conceal) seem unto us to be of some
moment. But we are deceived perhaps in our own cause: and therefore you and
your Translatour would / omytting all co^futation / that others should have the
judgment thereof: you in delyvering / he in publyshing your letters. But why
then did you not douchsafe to give us any knowledge thereof? At least / why did
you not so provide as that letter of ours which was in your hands / should
also be translated and published? Did you thinck that Pro. 18, 1^ Consider here
also your own ^llegation out of Seneca before Page 35.
he which is first in his own cause is just? Why then did you not also mind /
that his neighbor coming after him will make inquiry of him, that so both
parties being heard / judgment may be gyven according to truth and equity? For
which cause / though we have hitherto borne this / yet will we hereafter meet
with such dealing by the best and fyttest means we can. Neither doubt we / but
all these things (howsoever now they stand) will at length fall out for good
both to us and to all other / which love Christ with all his ordinances / and
hate Antichrist with all his abominations. And having this hope / we will
expect and endure whatsoever it shall please God / who is the Lord and
faithful maynteyner of his servants.

Concerning the differences (whereof you write again in your letters) which are
between us and the dutch Church of this city / it needs not that we write
unto non of the particulars otherwise then as before we have done. If you do
yet desire more we give you to understand that above a year since we delyvered
in writing the true and particular narration of the whole matter / to the
ministers and whole eldership of that Church: who (if yet they have not) man
now communicate it with you. By it also will appear / that we have done what
was our duty and as brotherly as we could. If not / let the error be showed
and it shall be corrected God willing. In the mean time / because we are both
pryvatly and publyckly so much urged by you hereunto / we will briefly note
the chief heads / wherein we differ from them / and where about we have had
dealing with them / both before and since you wrote unto us.

They are these which follow: 1. The estate of the Dutch Church at Amsterdam:
is so confused as the whole Church can never come together i^ one: the
ministers can never together with the flock sanctify the Lords ^a^e the
p^esence of the members of the Church cannot certeynly be known: and finally
no publyck action whether ex^ommunication or any other can rigg^ip be
performed. Which is contrary to these Scriptures, 1. Cor. 12.27. and 11.20, 23.
Math. 18, ^7. with 1. Cor. 5, 4. Act. ^.2.5. Numb. 8.9, Act. 20, 28. 2. They
baptize the seed of them who a^e not members of any visible Church of whom
moreover they have not care as of membe^s / neither admytt their parents to the
Lords Supper. Genesis 17, 7.9.10.11. 1. Cor. 7, 14. Exodus 12.48. with 2. Caron 30*
6. etc. Numb. 9.13. Hos. 2, ^, 4. with Rev. 17.1. Ezech 16, 59, etc. 3. In the
publyck worship of God / they have devysed and use an other form of prayer
besides that which Christ our lord has prescribed Mat. 6. reading out of a
book certain prayers invented and imposed by man. Exodus 20, 4, 5. and 30, 9.
with Psalm. 141.2. and Rev. 8, 3. Lev. 10, 1. Esa. 29, 14. with Mat. 15.9. Romans
8, 26. Ephesians. 4.8. 1. Pet. 2, 5. 4. That rule and commandment of Christ / Mat.
18, 15, 16, 17. they neither observe nor suffer rightly to be observed among
them. 5. They worship God in the Idol temples of Antichrist. Exodus 20.4. with
Deuteronomy. 12, 2, 3. 2. King. 10, 26* 27, 28. and 18, 4. Act. 17, 23. Rev. 18, 11,
12, etc 6 The Ministers have their set mayntenance after another manner then
Christ has ordained / 1. Cor 9, 14. And that also such / as by which any
Ministry at all / whether popish or other whatsoever might be maynteyned. 7.
Their elders change yearly / and do not continue in their office according to
the doctrine of the Apostles and practice of the Primitive Churches Romans 12, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8. 1. Cor. 12, 11, 12, etc Act 20.17.28. 1. Pet. 5.1. / 2.3 4 See
also* Numb. 8.24. etc. 8. They celebrate Marriage in the Church / as if it were
a part of the Ecclesiastical administration / whereas it is in the nature of it
merely civil. Ruth. 4. chap. 9. They use a new censure of Suspension, which
Christ has not appointed. Mat. 28.20. Gal. 3.15. 2. Tim. 3.16 17. 10. They
observe days and times consecrating certain days in the year to the
Nativity, Resurrection, Ascension of Christ etc. Exodus 20. commandment / 2.
and 4. Rev. 1.10. 1 Cor. 1^.1.4.2. Act 20.7. Col. 2 16.17. Esa. 66, 23. Gal
10.11. 11 They recei^e vnrepe^tant excommunicates to be members of their
Church: which by this means becomes one body with such as be delivered unto
Satan. 1. Cor. 5.5 1. Tim. 1.20.


These (among other) are the corruptions of the church aforesaid: which they
are neither able to defend nor willing to forsake. Herein therefore we differ
from them as they which know this estate of theirs may perceive by our
confession compared with their errors noted before: which the Lord give them
to see and mind. And for your self (good Sir) take you heed in godlynes* that
in this cause you do not in any respect with hold the duty which you ow unto
them / or defense which you ow unto the truth. So let God almighty also love
you / and Christ our Savior be merciful unto you. And this you may do truly /
Godly / brotherly / wisely with great profit to us and the Church of Christ
every where* Therefore we exhort and beseech you in the lord that you be
careful always to help (no way to hurt / the Church and cause of Christ) by
your studyes endev^urs / labors: which being thus directed the Lord Jesus
bless to the glory of his name / and your own comfort for ever. Amen.

A third letter, written by Mr. Iunius, upon receipt of the* last aforesaid,
and of his two former imprinted before in England, and thereupon by us sent
unto him included withal.
To his beloved brethren in Christ the English people at Amsterdam. Salutations
in Christ.
AN huge bundell of letters, beloved brethren, I received from you yesterday in
the evening. I gave you counsel to rest from questions: you command me to
enter into questions. I continue still in my purpose: for I esteem more of
peace in the Church then of the seeds of strife: they that are fed with these
seeds, shall reap the fruit. Where you conclude and pronounce that I do
therefore assent unto you, it is a false conclusion: As towching the matter I
have enjoined my self silence: and although I be an hundred times called upon
by letters, I will continue still in the argument of counsel till I see
another course taken. If it like you not, let it alone: neither do I like the
handling of questions in this time. It is more according to God that I be
silent from questions in this estate of things, then that I power forth my self
and you together into them. You move many things in your letters, I will rest
from those things, and will occupy my self religiously in the work of the Lord.
Christian wisdom will never suffer me to speak of questions controverted, the
one party being unheard.

That my letters unto you, were translated into English, I have now first
known it by you: I knew not that it was done. You object that my letters were
not showed by you. I beleev it: for both by letters and reports of many I have been certifyed that they were not showed. If it please you, show them, for me
you may. All shall see, how false reports have been given forth concerning the^.
I neither am ashamed of them, neither ever will be. But I pity you (I speak it
unfeignedly) who for my letters give forth in public your conclusions. With
good men good dealing should be used. That the copyes of my letters were
carried into England, your selves may easily co^jecture, by what means it came
to pass. About te^ months since, the Sovereign Queen's Ambassador was there
and two of your company dined with him. What happened at that dinner you can
remember. He came hither unto me: he marveled at the fact of your departure: I
told him that I had written unto you, he desired a copy. To you I gave
counsel: whosoever gave it forth in public, has done it without my
knouwledg: I will not answer for an others doing, but for mine own. In the
mean while I will pray God that he frame your mynds unto the truth, wisdom,
love, and peace, and all our mynds unto his glory. Farewell in the Lord. From
Leyden in Holland.

The 16. day of July. 1602. Yours unfeignedly, Fr. Iunius.

The Answer to Mr. Iunius his third letter.
To the reverend and our beloved brother in Christ Mr. Fr. Iunius at Leyden in
Holland. Grace and peace in Jesus Christ.
YOur third and very brief letter (beloved Sir) we received this last week.
They were your letters imprinted and included that made the ^uge bundell, if so
it were. It is not well said of you / that term the Confession of Christian
faith and defense of publishing it to be questions and se^ds of strife, nor
that you say we co^man^ you to enter into questions. For the conclus^on,
whether it be true or false / now let others judge which shall see your letters
together with ours. Towching the matter, you have enjoined your self silence.
Yea and towching the manner and other things also where you can find no answer
neither. Yet for the matter it self if so be that with the Papists Anabaptists
or any the like we did err from the true faith* we doubt not but you would
open your mouth to answer / to refute / to convince. But because in our faith
you can show no error / and yet in this time and estate of things like not ^o
stand for us and this cause it is safest to be silent. Wisely done in deed but
not according to God / who denou^cing by the Prophet has said / Cursed be he
that does the worck of the Lord fraudule^tly, ^er. 48.10. Psa. 137.8.^
and cursed be he that keeps back his sword from bloo^: On the contrary /
Blessed be he that shall reward thee, as thou have rewarded us o daughter of
Babel to be destroyed: Blessed be he that shall take and scattering dash thy
children against the stones. If this against Moab and the material Babylon how
much more against Antichrist and the spiritual Babylon with all the daughters
and abominatio^s thereof? If this against the shadow and type how much more
against the substance and body it self? Of the argument of co^nsell enough is
said. If you repeat it a thousand times / and yet take not away our answer and
reasons alleged in our first letters / we will always repeat the same answer
again. Those many things which are contained in your letters and ours do now
come forth in public. Neither doubt we but this is the work of the Lord. See
therefore that you be occupied therein religiously. That any should speak of
things controverted, we desire not otherwise then the reformed Churches and
those godly me^ and Martyrs of Jesus who with like purpose have published their
confessions of faith and causes of their troubles being so constreyned.

That your letters were not showed by us, we wrote not but this that we gave
not a copy of them to any: for what cause / we wrote in our former. Showed they
were and read in the public meeting of our Church If your mind were to have
them showed to others that knew we not. But now that you write this is your
mind / we shall show them together with ours publicly unto all And if any have
give^ forth any false reports con^erning them, let the^ now be ashamed. In the
mean time your self provided by sending yours at first unsealed / that they
should be showed to others and be read also of others before us. Neither does
it excuse the matter / which you wrote in your second, that ^^e messenger
showed you not to w^o^er whither you should have written, and that therefore
you sought and waited an whole month, being uncertain thereof. For we did
signify both these expressly / in the Epistle dedicatory prefixed before that
book which by the messenger was delivered unto you. Else how knew you at the
months end more the^ before whither and to who^ to send? Or when you knew /
why did you not seal your letters? Was it because you would have the showed?
We beleev it: as also that for the same cause / the copyes of the^ were carried
into England. And this too we knew / before they were translated in English:
but we held our peace / waiting to see what would follow thereupon. Now your
self see they are translated and given forth in public. For them therefore and
with them / we translate and publish ours: by which will appear that we have
dealt well with good men. You may call them as you please: it skilleth us
little: this is the very thing we desire and endeavor / that the simplicity of
the Gospel of Christ / the iniquity of the defectio^ of Antichrist / may more
and more be made known unto all. If for this thing you pity us, we will bear
it: praying that God in Christ would pity you. Where you write / that two of
our company dined with that honorable Ambassador / it is not true / that we
know of. Neither can we cell / what happened at that dinner. He sent not for us
to come unto him / neither did we like to intrude our selves. If by us he would
have been certifyed of our cause / we would have done it willingly and
syncerely. And you also / when he demanded of you / might have showed our
letters with your own / and the confession of our faith / and given also
copyes of both the letters. So might the Translatour have given forth both in
public. So had you provided / that sentence should not be given / the one
party being unheard. Which thing Christian wisdom, your self say, suffers not
^o be done in questions controverted. In this behalf therefore you have erred /
and this by you is to be answered: notwithstanding that for his doing / himself
is to answer / that translated and published yours without your knowledge. For
our selves / if any where we err / show it (we pray you again and again) by
the word of God / that is / by the only rule of truth / and we shall yield most
willingly. And thus we pray God that he would guide you together with us and
all his always unto Jesus Christ / and that he would keep us in him / who only
is the way, the truth, and the life. Whose name be blessed for ever. Amen.
