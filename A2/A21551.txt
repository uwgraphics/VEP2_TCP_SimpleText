here begins a little treatise schortely compyled and called ars moriendi /
that is to say the craft for to deye for the health of man's soul.
When any of lyklyhode shall deye / then is most necessary to have a
special friend / the which will hertly help and pray for him and therwyth
counseyll the syke for the well of his soul / and more over to see that all
other so do about him / or else quyckly for to make hem depart. Then is to
be remembered the great benefeytes of god done for him unto that time / and
specially of ye passion of our lord / and then is to be read sum story of
saints or the vij psalms with ye letanye or our lady psalter in part or hole
with other And ever the image of the crucyfyxe is to be had in his sight with
other. And holy water is oftymes to be cast upon and about him for auoydyng of
evil spirytes ye which then^e be full ready to take their advantage of the
soul if they may. And then and ever make him cry for mercy and grace and
for the help of our blessed Lady and of other saints in whom before he had
a synguler trust and love and thereupon to make his prayers if he may. When death
comes or any grievous pangys / or other great sykenes / then prayer or
devotion asswageth / wherefore it is wisdom for one to pray before any
sykenesse come / and also when one may in his sykenes if he will not be
deceived. So he is happy and may be glad that such a time of most need has a
feytfull friend and that will say beside ye prayers a fore rehearsed and cause
other also to say devoutly in remembrance of ye charity of Ihu christ and of
his passion and for to have ye rader his mercy and help iij pr^ nosters and
iij auees with a credo And therewith to exhort him by a pressed or for need by an
other in the manner as it follows.

Brother or sister remember well that god seyth by his prophet and eua^gelyst.
Blyssed be tho that deye and depart in our lord / that is to say from the
world and his pleasurys and deye in the true faith of the church and
repentance for her sins. Sir ye have great cause to be glad for to depart
from this wretchyd world and fall of all mysery / and think that ye needs
must depart / and desire hertely to be with Ihesu christ your maker redemer /
and lord god / for he shall give to you now your enherytau^ce that he did bye
for you with his precious passion and blood / wherefore this time of your
departing shall be better to you than the time of your birth / for now all
sykenesse sorrow and trouble shall depart now from you for ever. Therefore be
not agreuyd with your sykenesse and take it not with grutchyng but take it
rather by all gladness See at all times that ye be stabse in your faith and
believe and say your Credo if that ye may or else desire a another hertely to
do it for you here before us openly. And arm you ever with the sign of ye
cross as a christian man for your defense against your ghoostly enemies / in ye
which doing / god will be greatly pleased and the rather take you for one of
his folk by proteccyon and grace and as his child of salvation. Have ever a
good and true believe / and no thing may be Impossyble unto you And ever beware
that ye fall not in dyspeyre for that greatly would dysplease god / and can not
be remedyed. And remember ye sins done a fore time shall never hurt you as to
dampnacyon / if they please you not now and that ye be sorry for hem. Saint
Jerome seyth / if one should take his sickness or his death with grutchyng / it
is a token that he loves not god suffycyently / all is ryghtwyse that we
suffer. Desire with saint austyn of our lord here to be cut with trybulacyon
and to be brenned with sykenes and sorrow / so ye ye may be saved herafter for
ever. Now meke your self and be sorry that ye have been so unkind to please and
to keep his commandments and presume not as of your self any goodness / and
say with all me kenesse thus. Good lord Ihesu christ I knowleche that I have
sinned grievously / and by thy grace I will gladly amend me if I should live /
have mercy now of me for thy bitter passion.

Than ask him these questyons following a fore his death.

BE ye glad that ye shall deye in christian believe: Let him answer / ye / know
ye yt ye have not so well lived as ye should / ye / have ye will to amend if
that ye should live / ye / believe ye yt Ihesu christ god sone of heaven was
borne of blessed marye / ye / Believe ye also that Ihesu christ deyed upon ye
cross to bye man's soul on good friday / ye / Do ye thank god therefore / ye
/ Believe ye yt ye may not be saved but by his passion and death / ye / As long
as ye soul is in your body thank god for his death and have a sure trust by it
and his passion to be saved. And counseyll him to say if yt he may thyes
following words of great virtue.

YPut crystys passion betwyx me and mine evil werkys / and betwyx me and his
wrath Now lord god be merciful to me a sinner. The prase of our lord ihu
christ and ye virtue of his passion with ye sign of ye holy cross and ye
undefiled Vergynyte of blyssed mary his mother and ye blyssyng of all saints /
and ye proteccyon of all holy angels with ye help and preyers of al saints be
betwyxe me and all mine enemies now and in ye hour of my death and departing
Amen Also thyes verse following be of great virtue in the time of death / and to
be said of the syke if he may or by an other for him. Dirupisti dn^e vincula
mea. tibi sacrificabo hostia^ laudis et nome^ dm^ inuocabo. Deus propicius esto
michi pcco^ri Dn^e ihu^ xp^e Ego cognosco me grauiter peccasse. et libenter
volo me emendare per gra^z tua^ Miserere mei propter amara^ passione^ tua^.
Dn^e ihu^ redemisti nos in sanguine tuo laus sit tibi pro amara passione tua.
Largire claru^ vespere. quo vita nusquam decidat. sed premiu^ mortes sacre
perennis instet gloria. Also to our Lady Maria plena gre^ matter misericordie.
tu nos ab host protege. et in hora mortis suscipe. And at last: In manus tuas
dn^e co^mendo spiritu^ meu^. In noi^e pri^s et filij and spu^s sancti ame^.

Here follows a short and sweet remembrance of the sacrament of the altar
or that it be received of the seek person or of any other before there comunyng.
WElcome blessed Ihesu my lord god and savior / to whom is apropryed all mercy
and pity. Remember good lord how freyll my nature and substance is / and have
mercy and pity on me great sinner / after thy great mercyes and for thy bitter
passion / for I knowse che and believe faithfully as a christian child of thyn /
that thou here in form of bread / is the same my lord god ye of thy goodness
come down from heaven and was borne and took my nature of blyssed virgyne Mary
and dyed for me and rose the third day and after ascended in to heaven and
ther^ reygneth with the fader and the holy ghoost and all saints for ever
i^mortall / ye which for our great health freylte and daily transgressyon and
in remembrance of thy great love and passion have ordained this thy blessed
body in this wise to be taken of me and of all other wyllyng to be saved I
know well yt I am fer^ unworthy to be called thy child or servant for ye
great multitude of my sins / how be it you may make me rightful and able yt
which only of sinners have made great saints of heaven By yt thy great power
and might grant me now to take yt mekely i^ all fere and with waylyng for my
sins and with a spirytuall gladness. Come now good lord in to my heart and
cleanse it of al sin / enter in to my soul and make it hole / and therwyth
sanctyfye me within and without and be my defense for body and soul rebukyng
and puttyng a side all mine enemies fer from ye presence of thy power / yt I
then so defended by ye may have a free and sure passage to thy kingdom /
where I shall not see ye in this form by mystery / but I shall see the face
to face where I shall never hungre ne thurst / but ever be in joy with ye and
thine / there to gloryfye the and to worship ye to lawde and to preyse ye
world withouten end am^. By thyes following aen^ venyall sins taken away if
they be done devoutly.

In taking holy water holy bread / also by seyeng of the Pater nr^ / and
spirytually for this clause and petyco^n. Dimitte nobis debita nra^ sicut and
nos dimittimus debitoribus nri^s. And also by knocking of ye breast for onis
sins and also for seyeng of Deus propicius esto in pcco^ri / and by seyeng of
the comyne Confiteor at mass or at other time. Also by receyuyng of any of ye
sac^mente of the church / and specially of the body of our lord. Also by
heryng of mass / and by the sight of the sac^ment of ye altar there or else
where By the blissyng of a bishop or of a pressed at his mass. By any of the
deeds of mercy. by pardones / by martyrdom / and penance / by forgyuenesse to
a trespasour / by good ensample gyuyng / or for conuertyng of other to good
life. by pacyence thankyng in trouble / and by contrycyon for sins with
dyspleasure of hem. And for every good deed dooeng with good intent and
devotion Amen.

The famous doctor Johan gerson Chau^celler of paris taking his ground of
holy scripture and according with holy doctors seyth thus.
OVre most merciful fader lord god / knowing our freylte and redynesse to
all sin / is ever ready during this wretchyd and mortal life by many and
diverse ways to forgive us ever our trespace and to grant and give us his
grace / if so be that trewly we do ordeyne unto him thyes iij virtues following
/ so that they be said and done with all the heart devoutly. The first is
that thou shall say Blessed lord I knowleche that I have sinned grievously
against thy goodness thus and thus rehersyng thy sins / and I am dyspleased
therwyth by reason of the which I do penance and will do / for I know well
that I have greuyd the merciful lord and broken thy commandments in the
which thou only ought to be worshypped. The second / say this. Good lord I
have a good purpose and desire with thy help / to be right ware herafter that
I fall not in to sin / and I entende to flee the occasyons after the
possybylyte of my power. The iij. is this. Gracyous lord I have good will to
make an hole confession of all my sins / when place and time conuenyent may
be had according to thy commandments and all holy church. Thyes iij
verytees or trewthys who soever says with his heart vnfeynyngly in what place
yt ever he be / he may be sure that he is in the state of grace and salvation
and that he shall have everlasting life though all he had done all the sins of
the world. And if he decessyd without any other confession for lack of a priest
as slepyng or sodeyne death / he should be save suffryng a fore hard pain in
purgatory. Wherefore it is good counsel that every christian man ones or twyes
on the day erly or late or else at lest on holy days examen his conscience /
and remember if that he may with all his heart vnfeynyngly this say iij trowthis
/ and if he can so do / he may be sure that he is in the state of grace / and
if he may not / but is in will to sin ageyn / and to have his delectacion
with deed / and will not flee the occasyons of mortal sins / and so drowned
in sin will not arise / such one may be certain that the Pope may not
assoyle him. not for thy good it is that such one use much prayer and give
alms and to do other good deeds after their power / that god the rather may
lyghten their hertes and the sooner torn to goodness Amen.

Here follows a synguler prayer to be said in the fest of the dedycacyon of
any church or at any other time.
O Myghtyfull and most pyteuous lord god Ihesu Christ which of thy great
goodness has ordained all things that been in heaven and in earth for the use
and well of man / to the entente and end that they shall serve him / and he
the allone. And how be it that in each place you ought to be served and
worshypped / yet it pleases the much more such service and prayer in a place
or church that is dedyfyed / enueyled and hallowed by a bishop and his
mynystres with ympnes / psalms and letanyes / and other suffragyes with their
mysteryall obseruauntes ordained therefore / and for by cause thy precyouse body
and blood is ther^ daily offered up unto thy fader in heaven i^ knowleche of thy
great love and passion that thou had for man. And if it pleased the in the
old testament with thyn angels night and day to be assystent and to here the
prayers of thy servants in the temple / where was but the flesh and blood
of unreasonable beestys offered in sacrefyce / much more we trust that thou
will vysyte and be assystent to us night and day with thine angels in this thy
new temple and church / where thine own body and very blood daily is offered
up unto thy fader in heaven / and therewith received according to thy desire and
will of us thy servants though sinners for our saluaco^n and thereto here ye
prayers of us and other yt entende to love worship and thank ye i^ ye best
manner we can or may Now then^e blessed lord full of all mercy and pity / that
will that we call upon the and has promised to here the prayers of the
servants grant now and at all times to us and to all other of thy
superhabundant mercy and grace / that who soever come unto this church or to
any other with devotion and pray in what caas that ever they be / prosperyte /
temptacyon / trouble / or aduersyte / that their petycyon behouefull and
necessary prayer may be herd / and that the pardone granted to them may in
her souls and bodies with all other things apperteynyng unto them may take
effect in every part gracyously. And over this grant us of thy pity / pease
and accord in the church and realm / and to our founders / faders and moders
/ friends / benefactours / and to all christian souls / forgyuenes of their
sins with relesse of their pains and joy perpetuel. And finally we desire
of thy bou^teuous goodness sesonable weder with fruytes and to exclude from us
pestylence hungre moreyne and sykenesse and all enemies ghoostly and bodily and
therwyth grant us of thy grace good life and endelesse bliss. Amen
