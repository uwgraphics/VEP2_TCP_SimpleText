AN ADDRES TO THE Lion in the Tower.
THINE only Friend on Earth (the Hangman) stays
With Halter (ready Nooz'd) to end thy Days;
And give some Respite (to thy Guilty Breast)
(From Ghosts) that Haunt Thee since thou were in the WEST.
Those Shades that (stabb thee) and disturb thy sleep,
When from thy guilty Sheets thou dare not peep,
Nor open Claring Eyes, lest thou should See
Some of Those Thousand Western GHOSTS; by Thee
With Bloody Mouth doomed to Untimely End.
GUINEAS ( that sometimes would make thee a Friend
To those thou Hatedst;) would not (then) suffice,
Thy Cruelty out-bids thy Avarice,
(That Avarice) by which thou used to Steer,
When on thy Sullen Bench at WESTMINSTER.
STRANGE! Thou should derogate from all thy Tribe!
Oh, Ho! The Broad-Seal was the Greatest Bribe!
Suetonius says, that NERO (thus) would come
In's Shirt ( New-sled from Bed) to the next Room;
Where his Guards watched, frighted (as well as he)
A Thing in WHITE, with Ghastly Looks, to see;
Hairs bolt Upright; a Ghost, they thought it; for
(Thus Guiz'd) they could not know their Emperor,
His Visage was so changed: Oh Ghastly Sight!
The Stoutest YEOMEN of his Guards to Fright!
They fled from It, thinking it was some DEVIL,
(Or Hellish Ghost that Walked; 'twas one as EVIL;
As bloody and as bad all-out as HE,
As bloody and as bad (almost) as THEE,
Or the Third Richard, the best of all you Three.
Richard and Nero too, (Vile Men!) Did Slay
Their nearest Kindred; This, -- brave Seneca;
The other, Worse; but HE ordained good LAWS,
Which thou have from the Groundsell razed; because
The Tempting BENCHES bribed thy Soul; for rather
Than not come there, thou would have Sold thy Father:
Nay, (like POPE Sylvester, thou wast so evil)
Both SOUL and BODY freely to the Devil.
Methinks I see thee March (with Guards) to the WEST,
(With Bawling Roaring Lyon's Mouth you are blessed,)
Gaping and Foaming, Eager to be there,
To Gorge with Blood thy Guilty MAW; for Here
Thou never could Glutted be; but KETCH may give
Thee Blood enough, when thou shall Cease to live.
Let True Repontance Cheer thee when thou Hangs;
Oh that thy Hell on Earth may end thy PANGS!
