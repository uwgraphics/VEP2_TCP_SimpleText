BEing informed, That many Officers of Our Army, as well Foot, and Horse, as
of Our Garrisons, are absent from their several charges to Our great
dis-service, and their own shame and dishonor, We do hereby ordain, injoyne,
and expressly command all Chiefs, Captains and Officers of horse and foot, as
well those of Our Army, as of Our Garrisons, whose regiments, troops and
companies are marched or ready to march, to depart out of these Our Cities of
London, Westminster and other parts, within eight and forty hours after the
publishing hereof, and to repair to their several Charges with all possidle
diligence: Whereof they are to take notice and conform themselves accordingly
upon pain of being cash^ered and for ever declared unworthy of Our service,
and incurring Our highest indignation and displeasure.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster, this fourteenth day of June, in the
sixteenth year of Our Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1640.
