WHereas diverse Complaints have of late come unto Us, from the Inhabitants of
Algier, Tunis, Sallie, and Tituan, and the Countries under the same

Subjects have, or shall have Commerce and Intercourse, as the good and safety
of Our Subjects trading into those Parts, by the Advice of Our Privy Counsel,
do hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure, and do straightly charge and
command all Our loving Subjects, of what sort, quality or degree soever they
be, whom it may any ways concern, that they do from henceforth forbear all
acts of Hostility, or to offer any violence, or ill usage unto any the persons
Ships, or goods belonging, or which shall belong to Algier, Tunis, Tituan,
Sallie, or any other Port or part of those Countries which are under the same

Our high and heavy displeasure, and such pains and punishments, as by Our
Laws may be imposed, or inflicted upon them for their contempt, or neglect
herein.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the two and twentieth day of October, in the
fourth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
