A Proclamation for restraint of unnecessary resorts to the Court.
FOr that the Infection of the Plague weekly increases, and is much dispersed,
as well within the Cities of London and Westminster, as in the Suburbs and
Confines thereof; His Majesty has, by the advice of his Privy Council,
thought fit for the more safety of himselft, and of the Queens Majesty, and
of such Lords and Ladies of Honor, and others, that necessarily are to attend
at Court, to withdraw himself from Whitehall, to some other of his ordinary
Houses of access, so far remote from the said Cities, as the necessary
occasions of his important affairs will conveniently adunt: Therefore to avoid
unnecessary resort to the Court, of people dwelling in, or near any places
infected; His Majesty does straightly charge and command, that no person, or
persons whatsoever, do presume to come from London, or Westminster, or the
Suburbs, or Confines of the same, or from any other Town, or Parish, that is,
or shall be infected with the Plague, unto his Majesty's Court, Wheresoever the
same shall happen to be, or to the Town, or Parish where his Majesty, or the
Queen shall be resident, or make their abode, or wherein his Majesty's said
houses of access are situate, nor newly to make any houses for their
habitation in those Towns, Parishes, or places, specially not within the
Towns of Hampton, Kingston, Windsor, Eaton, Richmond, Nonesuch, Ewell,
Otelands, Chertsey, or Weybridge, or in any of the Towns, or Villages that lie
in the passages to Hampton Court, Windsor, Otelands, Nonesuch, or Richmond, or
any of them, or bordering or adjoining upon the same, upon pain of his
Majesty's heavy indignation, and the seuerest punishments that may be inflicted
upon them, for their contempt and disobedience against this his Majesty's
Royal and most necessary Commandment; Straightly charging and commanding all
and singular Justices of the Peace, to take strict order with all Constables,
Pettie-Constables, and other Officers of the Towns and Parishes, through which
the said Passengers are to travail, that they suffer no person or persons to
come to the Court, Parishes, or places aforesaid, or remain or abide there,
contrary his Majesty's Royal Commandment, but to cause them to return back,
till it shall please God to assuage the present violence of the Infection, and
the great danger thereby threatened, as they, and every of them tender his
Majesty's pleasure and safety, and the discharge of their own duties, and
will answer for their neglects therein at their uttermost perils.

Given at the White Hall the six and twentieth day of June, in the first year
of his Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
