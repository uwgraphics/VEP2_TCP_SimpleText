royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation forbidding the Lodging of any Strangers, or His Majesty's own
Servants, in His Palaces of White Hall, and Denmarke-house, in the time of the
absence of His Majesty, and His Royal Consort the Queen, from those houses.
Whereas of late years, more then in former times, and much more then is fit
to be tolerated, many make their abode and resiance in the King and Queens
Royal Palaces of White Hall and Denmarke-house, when their Majesty's, and
Courts, are absent from thence, to the great annoyance of those places, and
scandal of government, because many retiring themselves thither, by the
privilege of those places escape the hand of Justice; his Majesty, therefore
straightly charge and commands, that no person whatsoever, other then
ordinary Keepers of those Houses, in the absence of their Majesty's, presume to
lodge or abide in either of them, upon pain of His Majesty's heavy
displeasure. And he does therefore straightly will and command, that the Lord
Chamberlain, and Vice-chamberlaine of his Majesty's house, and the Lord
Chamberlain and Vice-chamberlaine of the Queens Highness house, and all
those who have the charge or keeping of those houses, be careful to see His
Majesty's pleasure observed herein, as they will answer the neglect thereof,
at their utter most perils.

And His Majesty's further pleasure is, that all such as have any Keys, of, or
belonging to those houses, or either of them, do forthwith upon the King or
Queens Remooues, respectively, deliver up such Keys to the Lord Chamberlaines
respectively, or to such as they shall severally appoint, to receive and keep
the same.

Given at Our Court at Portesmouth, the three and twentieth day of July, in the
fourth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
