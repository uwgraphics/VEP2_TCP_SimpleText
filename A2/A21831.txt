A declaration of the Queens Majesty's most gracious dealing with William
Marsden and Robert Anderton, Seminary Priests, sithence the time of their just
condemnation, being convicted according to the Laws, and of their obstinacy
in refusing to acknowledge their duty and allegiance to her Majesty. 1586.
Whereas at the last Session of Parliament among other good and necessary Laws
and ordinances established for the maintenance, continuence and preservation of
her Majesty's most happy and quiet government, and for the preventing and
avoiding of Treasons and practices traitorously attempted by certain of her
Majesty's evil effected Subjects, being Jesuits, and Seminary Priests,
made and created at Rome and Rhemes, and other places beyond the Seas, who at
the instigation of the Pope and others, favoring his pretended tyrannous
authority over the Crown of England, and envying the happy and blessed estate
of her Majesty's said government, came daily into the Realm, to pervert and
seduce her Majesty's good Subjects under color of Religion, to draw them from
their due and natural obedience to wards her Majesty and her Crown, and to
prepare their minds and bodies to assist such foreign invasion, as was
certainly discovered to be intended by the said Pope and his adherents, as by
sundry effects and proofs has manifestly appeared, namely by the late
Rebellion in the North, the Invasion attempted in Ireland, and by the
discovery of sundry late plottes and purposes of treason, as well against her
Majesty's sacred person, as against the common quiet of the Realm: There was
for these considerations an Act made against the said Jesuits and Seminary
Priests, by the which their access into the Realm for the like seditions and
traitorous purposes was prohibited and ordered to be punished as in cases of
Treason. Contrary to which Act of Parliament, one William Marsden, and Robert
Anderton, Seminary Priests, being reconciled at Douay in Artois, by a Jesuit
called Father Columbine, and made Priests by the Cardinal of Guyse at Rhemes,
arriving secretly out of France lately at the Isle of Wight, where they were
apprehended, have confessed their purpose of coming into the Realm, to have
been to win souls, (as they term it) being in effect (as is before
mentioned) to persuade her Majesty's Subjects under color of maintenance of
Popery, to Rebellion. For the which, they having been by the due and orderly
course of her Majesty's Laws, tried and convicted at the last Assizes holden
at Winchester in the County of Southampton, upon the Statute aforesaid, were
nevertheless by the Judges of that Circuitc (knowing the merciful mind and
gracious disposition of the Queens Majesty to wards all her Subjects:)
conferred withal concerning their meaning to wards her Majesty's person and
the Realm, at which time they pretended in words and exterior show to
acknowledge her Majesty to be rightful Queen of this Realm, and to dowe and
protest that they would at all times adventure their lives in defense of her
Majesty and her Realms, against the Pope or any foreign power whatsocuer
that should attempt to invade the Realm with force, and that they would not
meddly or persuade with any in matter of Religion, but only keep their own
consciences to themsclues: Whereupon they were stayed from their execution, her
Majesty's minding nothing less, then that any of her Subjects, though
disagreeing from her in Religion, should dye for the same, as by them and their
companions has been most falsely and standerously published and affirmed. Upon
report whereof made by the said Judges to the Lords and others of her Majesty's
most honorable Privy Counsel, they following the mild and temperate course of
her Majesty's government, caused the said Marsden and Anderton to be stayed
from exceution, and to be remooucd from Winchester to London, where they were
further conferred withal, and examined concerning their obedience and duty
toward her Majesty for Civil causes, only to prove whether they would
remain constant in their protestations in that behalf made to the Judges at
their arraignement and conviction, that her Majesty might thereupon have been
moved to extend her mercy toward them. The said Marsden and Anderton being
accordingly examined by two principal persons thereunto appointed by her
Majesty's said privy Counsel, and put in remembrance of their former show of
duty made before the Justices of Assise, and advised to confirm the hope
conceaved of their reformation in matters of their allegiance to her Majesty,
to the end they might thereby move her Majesty to show mercy unto them:
Whereupon first the said Anderton being required to explane his true meaning in
his protestation of her Majesty's right to the Crown, and of his allegiance,
and particularly whether he did acknowledge her Majesty to be lawful Queen,
notwithstanding any sentence which the Pope either had given, or could give
against her: and whether he meant that it was his duty, and the duties of
all her Majesty's Subjects, to withstand the Pope, not only if his invasion
were for temporal respects, as to make conquest of the Realm, but also if he
would attempt such an invasion by force to reduce the Realm to his obedience
by color of Religion: he answered, that they be questions wherewith he does
not deal, and required to be respited for his answer, until such cases should
happen, adding by way of abusion, that in the mean time he may possibly be a
Protestant, and so then become of other opinion then he is now of.

William Marsden to the same questions before propounded to Anderton, auswered,
That he acknowledged her Majesty to be lawful Queen of this Realm, and of
other her Dominions: and that he took himself bound to obey her Majesty, so
far as his obedience impeached no this duty to God and to the Church,
(meaning the Church of Rome) requiring that he might not be asked his opinion
any further, until such case of sentence given by the Pope should happen: and
further says, that in case the Pope would send any forces into the Realm, to
reduce the same to the Catholic Religion, (meaning Popery) he would then do
the duty of a Priest, that is, he would pray, that right might take place.

And whereas they had both promised before the Iusties of Assise, that they
would not meddle in persuading of any person in matter of Religion, but only
keep their own couscience to themsclues: they now in this examination deny
that ever they promised not to deal with her Majesty's Subjects, to persuade
them in matter of Religion: Anderton saying, That he takes such as be out of
the unity of the Church of Rome, to stand in state of damnation, and that
therefore he is bound in conscience to do what he can to reclaim them. And
Marsden says, He may not promise not to deal with any of her Majesty's
Subjects in matters of Religion: for that he coming into the Realm to
persuade the Catholic Religion, (meaning Popery) he can not bind himself
not to do that duty.

Hereby may appear to all her Majesty's loving and true hearted Subjects, the
traitorous purpose of these two Seminary Priests, being borne Subjects of the
Realm, who though in general terms and speeches they seemed and made show to
the Justices of Assise, of true and dutiful allegiance to the Queens
Majesty their natural Sovereign: yet when endeavor is used to uncover their
masked and sayned protestations, they can not hide their malice and treasonable
intentions, even to their own confusions: which appearing thus manifestly to
the Queens most excellent Majesty, having subscribed these former answers
with their own hands, whereas she was much inclined upon the report of the
said Justices to afford them grace and pardon, if they would have persisted in
their former protestations, finding them now unworthy thereof, has left them
to the punishment appointed by the Law to be inflicted upon them for their just
offense.

God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Baker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
