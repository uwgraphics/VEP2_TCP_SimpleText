By the King.
A Proclamation concerning the viewing and distinguishing of Tobacco in England
and Ireland, the Dominion of Wales, and Town of Barwicke.
WHereas diverse good and necessary provisions have been heretofore made,
as well by Act of Parliament, as otherwise, for the well garbling of Spices and
Drugges, to the intent the Subjects of this Our Realm should not be
occasioned to use any unwholesome Spices or Drugges, to the impayring of their
health* or to buy the bad instead of the good, to the impairing of their
substance. And for as much as the Drugge called Tobacco, being of late years
grown frequent in this Our Realm and other Our Dominions, is daily sold
vngarbled, whereby more inconvenience grows and arises to Our loving
Subjects, then by any other Drugge whatsoever. And for that also by the many
and sundry abuses practiced and committed by Merchants, Masters of Ships and
others, in concealing and uttering the said Tobacco without paying any Impost
or Custom for the same, great loss and damage accrueth to Us,
notwithstanding any Laws, Statutes or other course heretofore taken for
preventing thereof: For remedy of all which Inconveniences, We, by our
Letters Patents under our great Seal of England, bearing Date, at Westmynster
the five and twentieth day of May now last past, did prohibit and forbid, That
no person or persons should at any time after the day of the Date of our said
Letters patents within Our Realm of England, the Dominion of Wales, and Port
and Town of Barwicke, or any of them; or within Our Realm of Ireland, or any
part of them or any of them, by himself or themselves, or his or their
servants or factours, or any others, directly or indirectly sell or put to
sale; or attempt, presume or go about any manner of way to sell or put to
sale, either in gross or by retaile, any Tobacco, of what sort, kind or growth
soever, before the Custom and Impost thereof due, were paid; and the same
Tobacco were viewed, distinguished and sealed by the Officer or Officers of Us,
Our Heirs and Successors, in that behalf to be constituted and appointed;
For whose labor, travel, charges and expenses in that behalf to be sustained
and taken in the execution of the said Office: We did by the said Letters
Patents, constitute and appoint, That they should and might from time to time,
demand, take and receive to their own use, of every person and persons whose
Tobacco they should so garble, view and seal, the sum of four pence of
current English money, for every pound weight thereof so viewed and sealed.

And We did also by Our said Letters Patents (for the considerations therein
mentioned) give and grant the said Office, with the powers, fees and
authorities before mentioned to Our well-beloved Subjects, Francis Nichols,
Jasper Leake and Philip Eden, Gentlemen, to be executed by them or their
Deputies or Assigns for thirty and one years next ensuing the Date of the
said Letters Patents.

And We did further by Our said Letters, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
give and grant unto the said Francis Nichols, Jasper Leake and Philip Eden, and
their Assigns, and to all and every person and persons, which by them or any
of them, by writing under their or any of their hands and Seals, should be in
that behalf deputed and assigned, full power and authority during the term
aforesaid, as well to be present and to have place in all manner of
Custome-houses, Ports, Havens, Creeks and places of lading or vnlading of any
manner of Goods, Wares or Merchandises, into or out of the said Realms and
Dominions: As also to be present with all and every the Customers, Collecters,
Searchers, Surueyers, Waiters, and other Officers and Ministers having charge
for or concerning the lading or vnlading of any Goods, Wares or Merchandises,
for their better executing of all and every thing and things thereby appointed,
and for their better receiving and enjoying of the benefit of Our said Grant at
all times and places, where the said Officers and Ministers or any of them,
should by reason of their said several Offices have cause or occasion to be:
And also in all and every place or places, as well in Ships arrived with
Tobacco, and riding in any Port, Road or River, as on the Land, to make and
appoint such and so many Watchmen, Waiters and Officers, and to provide and use
such reasonable ways, orders and means, as they the said Francis Nichols,
Jasper Leake and Philip Eden, and their Assigns and Deputies should and might
be just and truly informed of all parcels and quantities of Tobacco, as should
at any time or times during the said Grant, be brought into any Port or place,
or be planted or growing in any place or places of the said Realms and
Dominions or any of them.

And also that it should and might be lawful, to and for the said Francis
Nichols, Jasper Leake, and Philip Eden, and their Assigns, and their and every
of their Deputies and Substitutes, at all and every time and times during the
term aforesaid, in lawful and convenient manner, with a Constable or other
Officer of the place, as well to go on board, view, and suruay all Ships,
Uessels, or Bottmes, riding or lying within any of the Ports, Havens, Creekes
and places of lading or vnlading, within Our said Realm of England, Dominion
of Wales, Port or Town of Barwicke, or Realm of Ireland, or any the members
or places thereunto belonging, as to go into any House* Celler, Uault,
Warehouse, Shop, or other place within the said Realms and Dominion, and Port,
or Town of Barwicke, or any part of them, or any of them to search and view if
there be any Tobacco uttered, sold, or put to sale, or offered to be sold, or
put to sale before the same be viewed, distinguished, and sealed contrary to
the true meaning of the said Letters patents.

And We did also by the said Letters for Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
require, charge and Command all and singular Majors, Shiriffes, Justices of
Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers, Comptrollers,
Searchers, Surueyors, Waiters, and all other Officers, Ministers, and Subjects
whatsoever, of Us, Our Heirs and Successors, as well of the said Realm of
England, Dominion of Wales, and Port and Town of Barwicke, as of the said
Realm of Ireland, That they and every of them, should from time to time during
the continuance of that Our grant, be aiding and assisting to the said Francis
Nichols, Jasper Leake, and Philip Eden, and their Assigns, and to every of
them, their and every of their Deputy and Deputies, Substitute and
Substitutes, in the due Execution of all and every the powers and authorities
expressed in the said Letters Patents, upon pain of the displeasure of Us, Our
Heirs and Successors, and as they would answer the contrary at their perils*
as by the said Letters Patents more at large appears.

We now, to the intent Our will and pleasure in the premises may be the
better known to all Our loving Subjects whom it may concern, Do hereby
notify, publish and declare the same Our pleasure, willing and commanding that
all and every the premises, be from time to time in every respect duly
performed, executed and observed according to the true intent and meaning of
the same Our Letters Patents. And that no person or persons do attempt or
presume to violate or infringe Our Command hereby; or by Our said Letters
Patents declared or expressed, upon the pains and penalties therein contained.
And We do also hereby Charge and Command, as well all and singular Merchants,
and other person and persons whatsoever, which shall import any Tobacco of what
sort soever, That they cause the same to be duly entered in the Custom house
belonging to the Port or place where it shall be landed in the name or names
only of the true proprietor or owner, proprietors or owners thereof, and not
in the name or names of any other person or persons which is not the true owner
thereof; As also all Our Customers and other Officers whatsoever, That they
take special care and regard to the due performance of the same, as they
tender Our pleasure, and will avoid the contrary.

Given at Theobalds the tenth day of November, in the seventeenth year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
