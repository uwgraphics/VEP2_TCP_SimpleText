THE FOVR-LEGG'D ELDER OR, A horrible Relation of a Dog and an Elders Maid.
To the Tune of The Lady's fall.
ALL Christians and Lay Elders too
for shame amend your Lives,
I Will tell you of a Dog-trick now,
which much concerns your Wives:
An Elder's Maid near Temple-Barre
(ah what a Queen was she)
Did take an ougly Mastive Cut
where Christians use to be;
Help House of Commons, House of Peers,
oh now or never help,
The Assembly has not sat four years,
yet has brought forth a Whelp.
One Evening late she stepped aside,
pretending to fetch Eggs,
And there she made her self a Bride
to one that had four legs:
Her Master heard a rumblement,
and wondered she did tarry,
Not dreaming (without his consent)
his Dog would ever marry:
Oh house of Commens, house of Peers, etc
He went to peep, but was afraid
and hastily did run
To fetch a Staff to help his Maid,
not knowing what was done,
He took his Ruling Elders Cane,
and cried out help, help here,
For Swash our Mastive and poor Jane
are now sight Dog sight Bear.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc
But when he came he was full sorry,
for he perceived their strife,
That 'cording to the Directory
they two were Dog and Wife:
Oh (then said he) thou errant queen,
why have thou me beguiled,
I wonderd Swash was grown so lean,
poor Dog he is almost spoiled.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
I thought thou had no carnal sense
but what is in other Lasses,
And could have quenched thy cupiscence
according to the Classes,
But all the Parish see it plain
since thou art in this pickle,
Thou art an Independent queen,
and love a Conve^ticle.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
Alas now each Malignant Rogue
will all the World persuade
That she that is Spouse unto a Dog
may be an Elders Maid,
They Will jeere us if abroad we stir,
good Master Elder stay,
Sir, of what Classis i^ your Curre?
and then what can we say?
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
They Will many graceless Ballads sing
of a Presbyterian,
That a Lay-Elder is a thing
made up half Dog half Man;
Out, out, said he, and smote her down,
was mankind grown so scant*
There Is scarce another Dog in town
had took the Covenant.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
Then Swash began to look full grim,
and Jane did thus reply,
Sir, you thought naught too good for him,
you fed your Dog too high,
It Is true, he took me in the lurch,
and leapt into my arm,
But as I hope to come to Church
I did your Dog no harm.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
Then she was brought to Ne^gate jail
and there was naked stripped,
They whipped her till the cord did fail,
as Dogs use to be whipped*
Poor City Maids shed many a tear
when she was lashed and lang'd,
And had she bin a Cavalir
surely she had been hanged,
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers,
Here Is was but Fornication doomd,
for which she felt the lash,
But his was Buggary presumd,
therefore they hanged Swash:
What had become of Bishops then,
or Independency,
For now we find both Dogs and Men
stand for Presbytery.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers etc.
She might have took a Sowgelder*
with Synod-men good store,
But she would have a Lay-Elder
with two legs and two more:
Go tell the Assembly of Divines,
tell Adoniram Blew,
Tell Burgess, Marshall, Case, and Vines,
tell Now and-anon-too.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
Some said she was a Scottish Girl,
or else (at least) a Witch,
But she was borne in Colchester,
was ever such a Bitch*
Take heed all Christian Virgins now,
the Dog Star now prevails,
Ladies beware your Monkeys too,
for Monkeys have long tails.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peers, etc.
Bless King and Queen and send us peace
as we had seven years since*
For we remember no Dog-dayes
while we enjoyed, our Prince:
Bless sweet Prince Charles, two Dukes, three Git
Lord save His Majesty,
Grant that his Commons, Lords and Earls
may lead such Lives as He.
Oh House of Commons, House of Peers,
Oh now or never help,
The Assembly has not sat four years,
yet has brought forth a Whelp.
FINIS.
