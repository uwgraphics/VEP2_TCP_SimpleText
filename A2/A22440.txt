A Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of any Goods or Merchandise
whatsoever, in any French Ships or Bottomes.
Having duly considered and weighed the present State of Affairs, as they now
stand between Us and Our Brother of France, and Our Subjects, and foreseeing
the many inconveniences which would follow to Us and Our people, if the
Merchandise of that Kingdom, or of any other, should be imported into any of
Our Kingdoms or Dominions, in, or by any French Ships or Bottomes, We have
therefore thought fit, by the Advice of the whole body of Our Privy Counsel,
utterly to forbid and prohibit the same. Our will and pleasure therefore is,
and We do hereby publish and declare Our Royal Command to be, that no Goods,
Merchandise, or Commodities whatsoever, of what condition or nature soever,
shall at any time or times hereafter, be brought, or imported, into any of Our
Realms or Dominions, or any Haven, Port, or Creek of the same, in any Ship,
Bottom, or Vessel of, or belonging to the French King, or any his Subjects,
until Our pleasure shall be otherwise published and made known to the
contrary:

And if any person or persons whatsoever, shall presume to offend or
transgress Our Commandment and Royal pleasure herein, that then all such
goods and Merchadize, to whomsoever the same shall belong, shall be forfeited and
confiscated unto Us, and as forfeited shall be seized and converted to Our use:
and hereof We will that all Our loving Subjects, and all others whom it may
concern, do take notice at their peril, and to that end We do hereby
straightly charge and command, as well Our high Admiral of England, and all and
every the officers of Our Admiralty, as also all and sigular Our Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers and Wayters in all and every the Ports, Havens and
Creekes of this Our Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of
Berwicke, that they and every of them in the several places of their several
authorities, take special care to see this Our Royal pleasure and
Commandment put in due execution, as they tender Our pleasure and will avoid
the contrary at their utmost perils.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the 28. day of April in the third year of
Our Reign of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.
