An acre declarynge the establyshment of the succession of the kings most
(...) majesty in the imperyall crowce of this realm.
_(...) their most humble wise s^ewen unto your maiesty^, your most humble
and obedyent s^b^ecte^, the (...) ^^^^^^uall and tu^^^all, and the commons in
this present parley ament assembled, that syns it is the natural in (...) of
every man, gladly and wyllingly to prouy^e for the surety of both his title
and succession, although it touch his only private cause. Wethe^^^re most
ryghtfull and dredefull soueraign^ lord, teken our selves m^ch^ more bounds
to beseech and instant your highness, although we doubt not of your princely
he^^e and wisdom, myxed with (...) rall affectyon to the same, to forese and
provide for the perfyte surety of both you and of your most laufull
succesyon and heirs, upon which depends all our joy and welthe* In whom
also is united and k^ytte the only mere true inherytaunce and ^ycle of this
realm, without any contradictyon. ^herfore we your said most humble and
obedyent subjects, in this present parlyament assemb^ed, calling to our
remembrance the great diuisyons, which in times paste have been in this realm
by reason of several tyt^es pretende^ to the imperyall crown of the same
which somtymes, and for the most part ensued by occasyon of ambiguite and
doubts, than not so perfycely declared, but that men might upon froward
intentes expound them i^ every man's s^^^^ce appetyte and affectyon, after
their sense, contrary to the right legalyte of the succession and posterite of
the laufull kings and ^^perours of this realm: whereof has insued great
effecsyon and destruction of ma^^es blood, as well of a great number of the
nobles as of other the subjects, and specially inherytours in the same. And
the greatest occasyou thereof has been because no perfyte and substancyall
promsyou by law has been made within this realm of it self, when doubts and
questyous have been moved and proponed of the certay^ti^ and legalytie of the
succession and posterytie of the crown. By reason whereof the by shop of Bome
and see apostolybe, contrary to the great and inniolable grauntes of
iutisdictions given by god immedyatly to emp^^ours, kings, and princes in
succession to their hey^es, has presumed in times paste to inuest, who should
please them to inheryte in other me^^es ky^ghomes and domynions: Which thing
we pour most humble subjects, both spitiruall and temporal, do most abhor^
and deteste. And som^ymes other forayne princes and potentates of soudrye
degrees, minding rather dissensyon and discord to conty^^e in the rea^ne, to
the ^tter desolacyon them^f, that charity, equyre, or unite, have many times
suppor^^ ^^onge tyties, whereby they might the more casyly and facilly asppre to
the superyorite of the same. The contynuaunce and sufferaunce whereof depely
consydred and pondered, were to dangerous and pery^lous to be suffered any
longer within this realm, and to much contrary to the buite, peace, and
tranquyllite of the same, being greatly reprocheable and di^^^^^able to the
hole realm.

In consyderacion whereof your said most humble and obedyent subjects, the
nobles and commons of this realm, calling further to their remembrannce, that
the good vuite, peace, and welthe of this realm, and the succession of the
sithiectes of the same most specially and principally above all woridly
thyuges, consysteth and restech in the certayutie and surety of the
procreation, and postetyte of your highness, in whose most coyall person at
this present time is no manner of doubt nor question, do therefore most humbly
beseech your highness, that it may please your majesty, that it may be
inacted by your highness, with the assent of the lords spirytuall and
temporal, and the commons in this present parlyament assembled, and by
anctorite of the same, that the marriage here to fore solemnysed between your
highness and the lady Catharyue, beyuge before laufull wife to prince Acture,
your eider brother, which by him was carnally known, as does duly appear by
suffycient prove in a laufull process had and made before Ch^^mas by the
suffera^nce of god now archebyss^op of Canterbury, and metropolytane and
primate of all this realm, shall be by auctorit^ of this present parlyament,
diffynityuely, clearly, and absolutely declared, de^ed and ading^^ to be
ag^y^st the laws of a^uighty god, and also accepted, reputed, and taken of no
value ne effect: but utterly void and (...) thereof made be the said
a^chebysshop shall be good and effectual to all intentes and purposes: any
lyconce, dispen^^^^n or (...) act or acts, go^^ge before, or ^^suyng the same,
or to the contrary thereof in any wys^not withstanding. And that every (...),
dispensation, act or acts thing or things, here tofore had, made, done or
to be done to the contrary thereof shall be (...) of (...) effect. And that the
said lady Catharyne shall be from hence forth ca^^^d and reputed only
dowagyet to prince A^ture, and not queen of this realm. And that the laufull
matrymouye had and solemysed between your hyg^^esse and your most dear and
entietly beloved wy^^ queen A^me, shall be establysshed and taken for
undoubtful, true, sincere, and perfy^e ever hereafter, according to the
just iudgemen of the said Thomas archbysshop of Canterbury, metropolytane and
primate of all this realm / whose grounds of judgment have been confyrmed as
well by the hole clergy of this realm, in both the conuocacions, and by
both the vn^uersyties thereof, as by the vniuersyties of Bon^ny, Padua, Paris,
Orlyaunce, Tolouse, Ingieu, and diverse others: And also by the private
writings of many right excellent well learned men. Which grounds so
confyrmed, and judgment of the said archebysshop ^usuynge the same, together
with your marriage solempnysed, byt^^^e your highness and your said laufull
wife queen Anne / We your said subjects both spirytuall and temporal, do
purely, play^ely, constantly, and fyrmely accept, approve, and tatifye for good
and consonant to the laws of almighty god, without ^^rour or defaute: Most
humbly besechynge your majesty, that it may be so establysshed for ever by
your most gracyous and royal assent.

And furthermore syns many inconuenyences have fallen as well within this
realm as in others, by reason of maryenge within the degrees of marriage
prohybit by gods laws, that is to say. The son to marye the mother, or
the stepmother: The brother the syste^* The father his sons daughter, or his

his wyfes daughter, or his wyfes sons daughter, or his wyfes d^ughters

prohybite and detested by the laws of god: yet nevertheless at some times
the^ have proceeded under colors of dispensacions by man's power, which is
but usurped and of right ought not to be granted, admytted, (...) allowed* for
