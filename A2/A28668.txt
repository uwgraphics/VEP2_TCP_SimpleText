To the Honorable the House of Commons, FOR Raising of Moneys.
It is humbly offered,
IF in Your Wisdoms it be thought fit, That from and after the Twenty fourth
Day of June 1699. for and during the Space of Five Years, whoever shall happen
to Die within the said time without lawful Issue living at the time of their
Death, the Twentieth part of their Estate, after an Allowance made for Payment
of all their just Debts, be appropriated to the Public, and the Value thereof
paid within one Year after the Decease of the Party: And whoever shall defraud,
to pay double what Convicted of, one half to the Public, and the other half to
the Informer. It is presumed, That this may be a good Fund for One Million at
Seven per Cent. to pay both Principal, Interest, and incident Charges thereon
within Five Years, the time limited; and being a Contingency on a Benefit
accruing to some Persons at the same time, will not be grievous, especially to
the Poor. This, together with the Regulation thereof, is with all Submission
proposed to this most August Assembly, by a Well-wisher to the Public, and

Bridgwater-Square, February 3d, 169^/9. Your Honors Very humble and Faithful
Servant, Wm. BOND.

A PROPOSAL FOR Raising Moneys.
