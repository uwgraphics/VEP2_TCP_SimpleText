God save Queen Marye.

The pallis
QVhen pale Aurora with face lamentable
Her russat mantill borderit all with sable
Lappit about be heuinlye circumstance
The tender bed and arres honorable
Of Flora queen till flouris amyable
In may Irays, to do my observance
And entrit in a garding of plesance
With Sole depaint, as paradys amyable
And blisfull vewes, with blomed wariance.
So craftily dame flora had over tret
Her heuinly bed, powderit with money a set
Of Ruby, Topas, Perle, and Emerant.
With balmy dew, bathit, and kyndly wet,
Quhil vapors hot right fresche and well ybet
Dulce of odor, of flewour most fragant
The silver droppis on dayseis distillant.
Quhilk verdour branches over the alars et
With smoky sense ye mystis reflectant.
The fragrant flouris blomand in their seis
Ouerspred ye leaves of naturis tapestreis.
Above the quhilk with heuinly armoneis
The birds sat on twistis and on greis
Melodiously makand their kyndly gleis
Quhois schill notis, fordinned all the skyis.
Of reparcust air the eccon cryis.
Amang the branchis of the blomed treis.
And on the laurers silver droppis lyis.
Quhyll that I rowmed in that paradise
Replennessed and full of all delice
Out of the sea, Eous alift his heid.
I meyne the horse quhilk drawis at device
The assiltre and goldin chair of pryte
Of Tytan, quhilk at morrow semis reid.
The new colowr that all the night lay deid
Is restored, both fowlis, flowris, and ryce
Reconfort was, throw Phoebus gudly heid.
The dasy and the Maryguld onlappit
Quhilkis all the nicht lay with their leuis happic
Thaim to preserve fra rewmes pungitiue
The vmbrate treis that Tytan about wappit
War portrait, and on the earth yschappit.
Be goldin bemes viuificatiue.
Quhois amene hete is most restoratiue.
The gershoppers amangis the vergers gnappit
And beis wrocht material for their hyue.
Richt halsom was the sessoun of the eir.
Phoebus, forth et depured bemes cleir
May nutrityue till all things vigitant.
God Eolus of wynd list nocht appeir.
Nor ald Saturn with his mortal speir.
And bad aspect contrar til every plant.
Neptunus nolde within that palace hant.
The beriall stremes ryunyng men micht heir
By bonkis grene with glancis variant.
For till behold that heuinly place complete
The purgit air with new engendrit hete:
The soil enbroude with colowr, ure, and stunt:
The tender grene, the balmy drops sweet:
So reioysyt and confort was my sprete
I not was it a vision or fanton.
Amyd the buskys rowmyng mine alone
Within that garth of all plesans replete
A voce I hard preclare as phoebus schone.
Syngand O may thou myrrour of soles
Maternall month lady and maistres
Till every thing adoun respirature.
Thyn heuinly werk and worthy craftines
The small herbis constrenis till encres
O verray ground till werking of nature.
Quhois hie curage and assucuryt cure
Lausis the earth his frutis till expres
Dyffundant grace on every creature.
Thy godly lore, cu^nyng incomparabyl
Dantis the savage bestis may vnstabyl:
And expellis all that nature infestis.
The knoppit syonys with leuys agreabyl
For till reuert and burgione ar maid abyll
Thy mirth refreschis birdis in their nestis.
Quhilkis the to pryse and nature never restis.
Lonfessand ou may potent and louabyll
Amang the brownys of the olyue twystes.
In the is rute and augment of curage.
In the enforcis martis vassalage.
In the is amorus luf and armony
With incrementis fresche in lusty age
Quha that constrenit ar in luffis rage
Addressand yaim with obseruans ayrly
Weil auchtyst the till glore and magnify.
And with that word I rasyt my vissage
Sore effrayit half in a frenisye.
O Nature queen and O e lusty May
(Quod I) tho, quhow lang sail I thus foruay?
Quhilk owand Venus in this garth deseruis,
Reconsell me out of this great affray.
That I may fynge ow laudis day be day.
e that al mundane creaturis preseruis.
Lonfort our man that in this fanton stetuis.
With sprete arrasyt, and every wit away.
Quakyng for fere both puncys, vane and neruis.
My fatal werd, my febyl wit I wary
My dasyt heid quham lake of brave gart very,
And not sustene so amyabyll a soun
With ery curage febyl strenthis sary
Bownand me hame and list no langer tarry
Out of the air come ane impressioun.
Throw quhois lycht in ecstasy or swoun,
Amyd the virgultis all in till a fary
As femynine so feblyt fell I down.
And with that gleme so dasyt was my mycht.
Quhill their remanit not her voce nor sycht.
Breath motione, nor hetis natural
Saw neuit man so faint a leuand wycht.
And na ferly for over excelland lycht.
Lorruppis the wit and garrys the blud avail
On till the heart that it no danger ale.
Quhen it is smorit, membris wyrkes not richt
The dreadful terror, sua did me assail.
yt at the last I not quhou long a space
A little hete aperyt in my face.
Quhilk had to fore beyn pale and void of blud
Tho in my slewen I met a ferly case.
I thought me set within a desert place
Amyd a forest by a hydous flud
With grysly fysche, And schortly till conclud
I shall descryue (as god will give me grace)
Mine auision? in rurell terms rude.
Finis.


The Palys of Honor.
Thou barrant wit ouerset with fantasyis,
Schaw now the craft that in thy memor lyis,
Schaw now thy shame, schaw now thy bad nystee,
Schaw thyn endyt, repruf of rethoryis,
Schaw now thy beggit termis, mare than thryis,
Schaw now thy ranys, and thyn harlottree,
Schaw now thy dull exhaust inanytee,
Schaw forth thy cure, and write their frenesyis
Quhilkis of thy sempyll cunnyng nakyt the.
My rauyst sprete in that deserte terrybill
Approchit nere that ugly flude horrybill
Lyk till Cochyte, the river infernal
With vile wattyr quhilk maid a hydduus trubbyll
Rynnand ouerhed, blud red, and impossybyll
That it had been a river natural.
With brayis bare, raif rochis like to fall,
Quhare on na gers, nor herbys were visibyll
Bot skauppis brynt, with blastis boryall.
This laythly flude, rumland as thondyr routyt
In quham the fysche elland as eluys schoutyt
Their elpis wild my hering all fordeuyt
Tha gr^m monstruis my spretis abhorryt and doutyt
Not throu the soil, bot muskan treis sproutyt
Combust, barrant, vnblomyt, and vnleuyt.
Ald rottyn runtis quhairin no sap was leuyt
Much, all wast, widdrit with granis moutyt
A gana^d den, quhair morthurars men reuyt.
Quhairfore my seluyn was richt sore aghast.
This wyldernes abhomynable and wast
(In quhom na thing was nature confortand)
Was dyrk as roy^ the quhilk the sea vpcast,
The quhislyng wynd blew money byttir blast,
Runtis ratlit and uneath might I stand,
Out throu the wode I crap on fut and hand,
The ryuar stank, the treis clattryt fast,
The soil was not bot marres, slyik, and sand.
And not but cause my spretis were abasyt
All solitare in that desert arrasyt.
Allas I said is non other remede, A description of the in consta^ce of fortune

Cruel fortoun quhy hes thou me betrasyt?
Quhy hes thou thus my fatal end compasyt?
Allas allas, sall I thus sone be deed
In this desert, and wait non other read,
Bot be deuoryt with sum best rauanus,
I weep, I wale, I plene, I cry, I plede,
Inconstant world and quheil contrarius.
Thy transitory plesans quhat auaylys?
Now their, now heir, now hie, and now deualys.
Now to, now fro, now law, now magnifyis,
Now hot, now called, now lauhcys, now beualys,
Now seik, now hail, now weary, now not alys,
Now good, now evil, now wetis, and now dryis.
Now you promittis, and rycht now you deny is
Now woe, now weil, now ferm, now freuilus,
Now gam, now gram, now louys, now defyis,
Inconstant world and quheil contrarius.
Ha quha should haif affyans in thy blys*
Ha quha should haif fyrm esperans in this*
Quhilk is allace sa freuch and variant.
Tertis none, sum hes, no wycht? suythly is,
Than hes my self dene gylty? a I wys,
Thairfore allace sall danger thus me dant?
Quhyddyr is bycum sa sone thus duyly hant?
And veyr translat in wyntyr furyus?
Thus I bewale my faitis repugnant.
Inconstant world and quhiel contrarius.
Bydand the deid yus in mine ecstasy,
Adyn I hard approchyng fast me by,
Quhilk mouit fra the plage septentrionall,
As heyrd of bestis stampyng with loud cry,
Bot than (god wate) quhow afferyt was I
Traistand till be stranglyt with bestiall.
Amyd a stok richt preualy I stall,
Quhare lukand out anon I did espy
Ane lusty rout of bestis rational.
Of ladyis fair and gudly men arrayit, The quof sapy^ce with her court.

In constant weid that weil my spretis payit,
With degest mind quhairin all wit aboundyt,
Full sobyrly their haknais they assait
Eftyr the feitis auld and not fornayt,
Their hie prudence schew forth and nothing roundie
With good effere quhare at the wod resoundyt?
In steadfast ordour to vysy on affrayit,
They rydyng forth with stabylnes ygroundyt.
Amyddys quham borne in ane goldyn chare
Quyrfret with perle and stonys may preclare
That drawin was by haiknays four, mylk quhyt.
Was set a queen, as lylly sweet of swear
In purpur robe hemmid with gold ilk gare.
Quhilk Iemmyt claspes closyd all parfyte
A Diadem may pleasandly polyte
Set on the tressys of her gyltyn hare
And in her hand a scepter of delight.
Syne next her rayed in granyt violats
Xii. Damysylles ilk a^e in their estate
Quhilkis semyt of her consell most sec^e,
And nixt thaym was a lusty rout god wate
Lordis, ladyis, and money fair prelate:
Both borne of hie estate, and law degree,
Forth with their queen, they al by passyt me
Ane esy pase, they tydyng forth the gate
And I abaid alone within the tree.
And as the rout was passyt one, Craftye Synone. and false Architefel

And I remanand in the tree alone
Out throw the wode come rydand ca^iuis twane.
Ane on ane ass, a wedy about his moan.
The tothyr raid, ane hyddows horse apone,

Quhat men they were? they answeryt me agane,
Our namys ben, Achitefel, and Synone.
That by our ^uttell menys, feil hes slane.

Or that e pass (quod I) tell me this wondyr

Ar often in May, with money schour of rane.
Rycht so we been in till this company
Our wit aboundit and vsyt was lewdlye Architefel confessis his own craftenes
deceyt and abused wit.

My wisdom ay fulfyllyt my desire,
As you may in the bybyl weil aspy:
How Dauidis prayer put my counsel by,
I gart his son aganys him conspyre,
The quhilk was slane, quahairfore up be the swpre
My self I hangit frustrat sa ^owlily,
This Synon was a greik, that rasyt fire.
First in to Troy, as Virgyll dois report:
Sa tratourlyk maid him be draw over whore
Quhill in he brocht the horse with men of armies
Quhairthrow the town distroit was at schort, Sinons. craftines.

(Quod I) is this our destany and sort?
Cursyt be he that sorowis for our harmys,
For e been schrewis both be goddis armies
e will optene nane entres at one port,
Bot gyf it be throw sorcery or charmys,
Ingres till have (quod they) we not presume.
It sufficis us till se the palice blume
And stand on ro^me quhare bettyr folk been charrit.
For till remane adieu we have na tume
This ilk way cu^mis ye courtis be out dume
Of Diane, and Venus, that feil hes marryt,
With that they raid away, as they were skarryt,
And I again may lyk ane elrych grume,
Crap in the muskane akyn stok my sharrit,
Thus wrechitly I maid my resydence,
Imagynand feil lyse for sum defense.
In contrar savage bestis may cruel,
For na remeid bot deid be violence
Sum time asswagis febili indegence
Thus in a part I reconfort my sell,
Bot that so ^ityll was I dar nocht tell.
The stychlyng of a mows out of presence
Had been till me mare vgsum than the hell. Fear,

it glaid I was that I with thaym had spokkyn,
Had not been that, certis my heart had brokkyn
For megi^nes and pusi^lamytee.
Remanand thus within the tree al lokkyn
Dissyrand fast sum signys, or sum tokkyn.
Of lady Venus, and of her companee.
A heart transformyt ran fast by the tree,
With houndis rent on quham Dian was wrokkyn,
Tharby I understood that sche was nee.
They had tofore declarit her cu^myng.
Mare perfytly for thy I knew the sing.
Was action, quhilk Diane nakyt waryt
Bathyng in a well and eik her madynnys yng.
The gods was commouyt at this thing.
And him in form hes of a heart translatit;
I saw (allace) his houndis at him slatit:
Bakwert he vient to gyfthaym k^awlegyng
Tha raif their lord mysknew him at thaym batit.
Syne ladyis come with lusty giltyn treflys
In habit wild may like till fostar^ssys.
Amyddys quham heich on ane Eliphant
In sing that sche, in chastity incressys
Raid Diane that ladyis hartis dressys
Till be stabil and na way inconstant,
God wait that nane of thaym is variant,
all chaste and true virginite professys,
I not, bot few I saw with Diane hant.
In til that court I saw a none present
Ieptyis do^ ^^rit a lusty lady gent
Offeryt till god in her virginite.
Pollixena I wys was not absent
Panthessile with mannys hardyment
Effygyn* and Virgenius, douchter tree
With vthyr flouris of feminyte
Both of the new, and the ald testament
All on they raid, and left me in the tree.
In that desert dispers in sondyr skattryt.
Were bewys bare quham rane and wind on battryt
The watyr stank, the field was odious
Quhar Dragonys, lessertis, askis, edders swattryt
With mouthis gapand, forkyt tails tattryt,
With money a stang, and spoutis vennomous,
Corruppyng air be rewme contagious
May gros and vile enposonyt clowdis clatteryt,
Rekand lyk hellys, smoke sufturyus.
My dasyt head fordullyt dissyly.
I rasyt up, half in a letergy,
As dois a catyue ydronken in sleep
And so oppetyt till my fantasy
A schynand lycht out of the norhest sky.
The quihilk with cure till heir I did tak keep.
Proportion soundis dulcest hard I pepe,
In musyk nowmer full of harmony
Distant on far was catit be the deep.
Farther by wattyr folk may soundis here
Than by the earth, the quhilk with poris sete
Up drynkis air that mouit is by sound.
Quhilk in compact wattir of ane riuere
May nocht enter, bot rynnys their and here,
Quhil it, at last be caryit on the ground,
And thocht throw din be experience is found;
The fysch ar causyt within the ryuere stere
Inoth the wattyr the nois dois not abound.
Violent din the air brekkis and deris
Syne great motion of air the watyr steris
The wattyr steryt, fischis for ferdnes fleis.
Bot out of dout no fysch in wattyr heris.
For as we se tycht few of thaym has Eris.
And eik forsuyth, bot gyf wise clerkis leis.
Their is nane air Inoth watters nor seis.
But quhilk na thing may heir (as wise men leris^
Lyik as but lycht their is na thing that seis.
Anewch of this I not quhat it may mean
I will return till declare all bedene
My dreidfull dreme with grysly fantasys.
I schew tofore quhat I had hard and seen
Perticulary sum of my paynfull tene.
But now god wate quhate ferdnes on me lyis
Langere (I said) and now this time is twyis
A sound I hard of angellys as it had been
With armony fordynnand all the skyis.
So dulce, so sweet and so melodius.
That every wycht their with mycht be joyous
Bot I and catiuis dullit in dispare.
For quhen a man is wreth or furius
Malancolyk for woe or tedius
Than is al plesance till him may contrare. A sorrowful heart can not be merry

And semblably than, so did with me fare,
This melody intonyt heuinly thus
For profund woe constrenyt me make care.
And murnand thus as ane may woeful wycht
Of the may plesand court I had a sycht.
In world adoun sen Adam was create. ^eu^nlye harmonye

Quhat sang? quhat joy? quhat armony? quhat lycht*
Quhat myrthfull solace plesance all at right?
Quhat fresch bewte? quhat excel and estate?
Quhat sweet vocis? quhat wordis suggurate?
Quhat fair debatis? quhat lufsum ladyis bricht?
Quhat lusty gallandis did on their service wate?
Quhat gudly pastance? and quhat menstraly?
Quhat game they maid? in faith not tell can I.
Thocht I had profund wit angelical.
The heuinly soundis of their armony
Has dymmyt so my drery fantasy.
Both wit and reason, half is lost of all.
yt (as I know) als luchily say I sall
That angellyk and godly company.
Till se me thocht a thing celestial.
Procedand forth was draw ane chariote
Be cursuris twelf trappit in greni veluote. Goodly apparel.

Of fine gold were iuncturis and haruasyngis,
The lymnutis were of byrnyst gold god wot,
Both extre and quhelis of gold I hot.
Of goldyn cord were lyamys and the stryngis
Festnyt coniunct in massy goldyn ryngis
Euyr hamys convenient for sic note,
And raw silk brechamys ouyr their halsys hyngis.
The body of the cart of euit bone.
With crysolytis and money precious stone.
Was all ouirfret in dew proportioun.
Like sternys in the firmament quhilkis schone.
Reperalit was that godlyk plesand wone.
Tyldyt above and to the earth adoun.
In rychest claith of gold of purpur broun
Bot fas nor othyr freneis had it none.
Save plate of gold anamallyt all fassioun.
Quhairfra dependant hang their megyr bellys
Sum round, sum thraw in sound the quhilkis excellis
All were of gold of Araby may fine
Quhilkis with the wynd concordandly so knellys
That to be glad their sound al wycht compellys.
The armony was so melodius fine.
In mannys voce and instrument divine
Quhare so they went it semyt nothing else.
Bot Ierarchyes of angellys ordout nine.
Amyd the chare fulfillyt of plesance, Venus ^ her court.

A lady sat, at quhais obeisance.
Was all that rout: and wondyr is till here
Of her excelland lusty countenance,
Her hic bewte quhilk may is til auance,
Precellys all, their may be na compere,
For lyk Phoebus in hiest of his spear
Her bewtye schane castand so great a glance
All f^rehed it oppressed both far and nere.
Scho was peirles of schap and portrature,
In her had nature fynesyt her cure.
As for good hauyngis their was nane vot sche,
And her array was so fine and so pure,
That quhair of was her rob, I am not sure,
For nocht bot perle and stonys mycht I se,
Of quham the brychtnes of her hie beauty.
For till behald my sycht might not endure
More than the brycht son may the bakkis ^,
Her hair as gold or topasis was he wit,
Quha her beheld, her beauty ay renewyt.
On heid sche had a creste of dyamantis,
Their was na wycht that gat a sycht, eschewyt,
Wet he neuir sa constant nor weil the wit,
Na he was woundit and him her servant grantis*
That heuinly wycht, her cristall Eyn so dantis,
For blenkis sweet nane passit vnpersewyt
Bot gyf he were preseruit as their sanctis.
I wondryt sore and in mind did stare,
Quhat creature that mycht be was so fare,
Of sa peiries excelent womanheid.
And farlyand thus I saw within the chare
Quhare that a man was set with lymmes square,
His body weil ^ntaleit every steid. (...)

He bare a bow with dartis haw as leid.
His clethyng was als grene as ane hountare:
Bot he forsuyth had none Eyn in his head.
I understood by signis persauabill,
That was Cupyd the god may dissauabill,
The lady Venus his mother a gods,
I knew that was the court so variabill,
Of erdly luf quhilk sendill standis stabill,
Bot if thayr mirth and solace nevertheless,
In musik tone and menstraly expres,
So craftily with courage aggreabill,
Hard never wicht sik melody I ges.
Accumpanyit lusty onkers with all.
Fresche ladyis sang in voce virgineall. (...)

Concordes sweet, diverse entoned reportis,
Proportionis fine with sound celestial

Sesque altra, and decupla resortis,
Diapason of money syndry sortis
Wat songin, and plait be scir cunnynng menstrall,
On luf ballattis with money fair disportis.
In Modulatioun hard I play and sing
Faburdoun, priksang, discant, conturyng
Cant organe, figuration, and gemmell,
On crowd, lute, harp, with money gudly spryng.
Schalmis clarionis, portatiuis, hard I ryng.
Monycord, orgain, tympane, and symbell,
Sytholl, psalttry, and vocis sweet as bell,
Soft releschyngis in dulce delyueryng
Fractyonis divide at rest or clos compel.
Not Pan of archaid so plesandly plays
Nor king David quhais playng as men sayis.
Coniurit the spreit, the quhilk king Saul confoundit
Nor Amphion with money subtle layis.
Quhilk Thebes wallit with harpyng in his dayis
Nor he that first the subtle craftis foundit
Was not in musik half so weil groundit.
Nor knew their mesure tent dele be no ways
At their resort both heuyn and erd resoundit.
Na mare I understood their noumeris fine
Be god than dois a gekgo or a swyne
Save that me thynk sweet soundis good to heir
Na mair heiron my labor will I tyne.
Na mair I will their verbillys sweet diffyne.
Now that their musik, tones war mair cleir
And dulcer than the mouyng of the speir.
Or Orpheus harp of trace with sound divine
Glaskeryane maid na noyes compeir.
They condescend sa weil in ane accord,
That by na Iuynt their soundis been discord,
In every key they werren sa expert,
Of their array gyf I should make record
Lusty spryngaldis and money gudly lord.
Tendyr onglyngis with pietuous virgin heart.
Eldar ladyis knew mair of lustis art.
Diverse vtheris quilkis me not list remord
Quhais lakkest weid was silkis or brounuert.
In vest uris quent of money syndry gyse
I saw all claith of gold men mycht deuyse,
Purpur color, punyk and skarlot hewis,
Veluot robbis maid with the grand assyse,
Dames, satyn begaryit money wise.
Cramessy satin, veluos enbroude in diverse rewis
Satyn figuris champit with flouris and bewis.
Damesflure, tere, pyle quhare on their lyis
Perle, orphany quhilk every state renewis.
Their rich entire may peirles to behald,
My wit can not discriue howbe it I wald
Money entrappit stead with sylkis sere.
Money pattrell neruyt with gold I tald
Full money new gylt harnasyng not ald.
On money palfray lusum ladyis clear.
And nyxt the chare I saw formest appear
Upon a bardyt cursere stout and blad. Mars.

Mars god of stryf enarmyt in byrnist gere.
Every inuasybill wapyn on him he bare
His luke was grym, his body large and square.
His lymmys weil entaileit til be strange?
His nek was great a span lenth weil or mare:
His village braid with crisp broun curland hare,
Of statur not ouyr great nor it ouyr lang.
Behaldand Venus, O e my luif (he sang)

Xiiii. ere boynd with fyrm heart Immutabill,

Their fair ladyis in silk and claith of Lake
Thus lang sall not all foundyn be so stabyll.
This Venus court, quhilk was in luif may abil
For till discriue, my cunning is to wake
A multitude they were innumerabill.
Of gudly folk in every kind and age,
With blenkis sweet, fresch, lusty grene curage
And Dalyans, they rydyng forth in fere.
Sum leiuys in hope, and sum in great thyrlage,
Sum in dispare, sum findis his panys swage
Garlandis of flouris and rois chaplettis sere
They bare on head and samyn sang so clear.
Quhil that their mirth commouit my curage
Till sing this lay quhilk folowand e may here.
Constrenyt heart bylappit in distres
Groundit in woe and full of heaviness, A ballet of inconstant love.

Complene thy paynfull caris infinyte.
Bewale this warldis frele unsteadfastness,
Hauand regrait, sen gone is thy glaidnes.
And all thy solace, returnyt in dispyte
O catiue thrall inuoluit in dispyte
Confess thy fatale woeful wrechitnes,
Divide in twane and forth diffound all tyte,
Aggreuance great in miserabill endyte,
My crewell fait subiectit to penance
Predestinat sa void of all plesance,
Has every grief amyd mine heart in grave.
The slyd incostant destany or chance,
Vnequaly doith hyng in their balance,
My demeritis and great dolor I have,
This purgatory redowbly^ all the laue.
Ilk wycht has sum weilfare at obeisance.
Save me bysayng that may na grace ressaue
Deed the address and do me to my grave.
Woe worth sik strange mysforton anoyus
Quhilk has oppressed my spretis may Ioyus,
Woe worth this worldis freuch felicite.
Woe worth my fervent diseis dolorus
Woe worth the wycht that is not pietuus
Quhare the trespassor penitent they se.
Woe worth this deed that daily dois me de.
Woe worth Cupyd, and woe worth falls Venus
woe worth thaym bayth, ay waryit mot they be,
Woe worth their court and cursyt destane.
Loud as I mocht in dolor al distreneit
This lay I sayng and not a lettir feneit
Tho saw I Venus on her lyp did byte.
And all the court in have their horsys reneit.
Proclamand loud quhare is one poid that pleneit,
Quhilk death diseruis conmittand sik dispite.
Fra tree to tree they serchyng but respyte,
Quhill ane me fand quhilk said in grief disdeneit
Auant belane thou reclus imperfyte.
All in ane feuyr out of my muskan bowr
On knees I crap and law for fear did lowr.
Than all the court on me thayr hedis schuke
Sum glowmand grym, sum grinand with vissage sour
Sum in the nek gave me feil dyntis dowr.
Pluk at the craw they cryit, deplome the ruke
Pulland my hare, with blek my face they bruke,
Skrymmory fery gaif me money a clowr.
For chyppynuty full often my chaftis quuke.
With pain, torment, thus in thayr teynfull play
Till Venus bund they led me forth the way,
Quhilk than was set amyd a golden chare,
And so confoundit in to that fell affray
As that I micht consydyr their array.
Me thocht the field ouirspred with carpetis fare
(Quhilk was to fore brint barrant vile and bare)
Wox may plesand, bot all (the suyth to say)

Entronit sat Mars, Cupyd and Venus. The Auctor accused

Tho raise a clerk was clepit Varius.

And he begouth and red a dittay thus.

My lady here blasphemed in thy time.

For till betrais awatit here sen pryme.
Now God you wate me thocht my fortune fey
With quakand voce and heart called as a key.
On kneys I knelyt and mercy culd implore
Submyttand me, but any langer pley

For scho gaif chargis till proceed as before.

Inionand silence till ask grace any more.

For great effere me thocht na pane to be.
Bot sore I dred me for sum othyr Iape

In bestly form did on the field sudiourn.
And for his gilt was maid to weep and murn

For by exemplys often I herd to fore.

For all remeid was alterit in dispare.

Na wrichis word may depare our hie name

Of the musis, and in Venus presence

For my trespass I was so penytent.
And with that word all sodanly sche went

Of stormy see, quhilk mycht na manner swage.

And secondly, I saw a lusty barge
Quirset with seyes, and money stormy charge.

Were kepit in pondis of polist silver schene
With purifyit waitir as of the cristall clean.
