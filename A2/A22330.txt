By the King.
A Proclamation concerning the Prorogation of the Parliament.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, with the advice of the Lords of his Privy
Council, having taken into consideration, That a general sickness and
disease, which proves mortal to many, and infectious to more of his loving
Subjects (even now toward Winter) has dispersed it self within the Cities of
London and Westminster; And that, if the meeting of both Houses of Parliament
should hold (according to the last Prorogation thereof) on the second day of
November next, the same might prove dangerous, as well to his Majesty's own
Royal person, and his dear son the Prince (the occasions of Parliament
requiring their often residence, and being in, and near the Cities aforesaid)
as to the Nobility and Gentry of the land, to be called thither, out of the
fresh air, from all the parts of the Kingdom; Has therefore (by the advice
aforesaid, out of his Princely and gracious care of his loving Subjects of all
sorts) resolved to Prorogue the said Parliament, from the said second day of
November, to the sixteenth day of February then next following. And to the
end, That, as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as the Knights, Citizens
and Burgesses of Parliament, may spare and forbear their attendance
accordingly; His Majesty, for their ease, has thought fit by this
Proclamation, to publish and declare his Royal resolution and intention
therein: So that they, nor any of them (other then such, as for other occasions
shall happen to be in London or Westminster, who may attend the making of the
said Prorogation) shall not be bound, or compelled to appear the said second
day of November, at the City of Westminster, but shall be discharged thereof
against his Majesty. Nevertheless, his Majesty does will, charge, and
command them, and every of them, and all others, to whom in this case it shall
appertain, That they, and every of them, do personally appear and be present,
upon the said sixteenth day of February next coming, at the said City of
Westminster, to treat, consent, and conclude, upon such matters, as in the said
Parliament shall then, and there, of the common Council of the Realm (by Gods
favor) happen to be ordained.

Given at the Court at White Hall, the first day of October, in the two and
twentieth year of his Majesty's Reinge of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXXIIII.
