XXIII. Maij 1587. Anno 29. Elizabethae Reginae.
A publication of an order lately granted by the Queens Majesty, in favor of
a great number of her loving subjects, occupying the trade of Clothing in the
Realm; whereby they may have better sales of their Clothes to be transported
out of the Realm by the Port of London.
WHereas the Clothiers heretofore have used only to sell their clothes which
they brought to a place called Black well hall in London, where none but the
Merchant Adventurers did accustomably buy the same, and where also none but
free men of the city might bargain for any the said clothes with the
clothiers: The Queens Majesty in favor of the said clothiers, to the end
they may have more Merchants to buy their clothes, is pleased that both the
Merchants of the Stillyard resident in London, and all other Merchants
strangers whatsoever, and also all other Merchants of the realm though they be
not free of the company of the Merchant Adventurers, shall and may buy lawfully
of the said Clothiers any cloth being unwrought, vnbarbed or unshorn,
notwithstanding any law to the contrary prohibiting the same, and shall have
full liberty to ship and carry away out of the port of London any such
clothes: and of her Majesty's further favors the Merchants shall understand at
the Custom house in London, what customs and duties they shall pay.

And further it is ordered that all Merchants, strangers and English, that
shall not have liberty to buy any clothes at Black well hall, or within the
liberties of the city of London, shall and may at their will bargain for and
buy, all manner of clothes in the city of Mestminster, at a house appointed for
the same in the Kings street commonly called the George, where convenient
room is provided for that purpose, and to which place, the clothiers may bring
or cause to be brought all such clothes as they shall not be disposed to sell
within the city of London.
