A PROCLAMATION CONCERNING HERESY.
FOr because that of late many strangers, borne out of the kings obedience,
are arrived and come into this realm, which, al be it that they were baptized
in their infancye and chyldehod, according to the ordinance of the
vniuersalle church of Christ, Yet that not withstondynge, in contempt of the
holy sacrament of baptism so given and received, they have of their own
presumption and auctorite, latelye rebaptised them selfs: and over and beside
that, they deny the most blessed and holy sacrament of the altar to be
really the very body of our lord Jesus Christ: And yet farther, they keep hold
and teache other diverse and sundry pestilent herysies against god and his holy
scriptures, to the great unquietness of christendom, and pardition of
innumerable christen souls, wherefore a great nombre of them ben iudicially
and laufully conuicte of their detestable heresies, and have and shall for the
same suffer peynes of death, as reason and justice requirethe in that behalf:
The kings most royal majesty, being Supreme heed in earth under god of
the church of England, always entendynge to defend and maynteyne the faith
of Christ, and sacraments of holy church, and daily studyenge and minding
above al things to save his loving subjects (members of the said church)
from falling into any erroneous opinions and damnable heresies, into which
they might happen to fall, and be infected by the communyon and conversation
of such corrupt, sedicions, and erroneous persons, ordeyneth and straytely
charge and commands, that al and synguler strangers, now being in this
his realm, as well such as have recanted and reuokyd their said heresies, as
al other that have or do hold or tech those or any other erroneous opinions or
heresies against god and his holy scriptures, shall within.xii. days next
after this present proclamation depart out of this his realm, and of al other
his dominions, on pain to suffer death, if they contrary to this proclamation
do abide and be apprehended or taken. And that no person hereafter being of
the same sectis, and holding such erroneous opinions and heresies, upon like
pain repair into this his realm, or into any part or place of his
dominions. And over this, his highness straytely charge and commands, that
none of his own loving and natural subjects be so hardy to hold keep or
teache any errors or heresies contrary to god and his holy scriptures, upon
like peynes above remembered, wyllyng and commaundyng as well al prelates of holy
church, as all nobles, Justices, mayres, shireffes, baylyffes, constables, and
al other his ministers and loving subjects, that they and every of them, shall
put their good and effectual endeavor for the apprehendynge of such as they
shall here or know to keep, hold, or teache any such heresies, to the entente
the offenders may resceyue due punishemente and peynes of death from time to
time, as the case shall require, according to their merits, not faylynge so to
do, as they will avoid and eschew the kings most high indignation and
displeasure, and answer to his majesty for the same at their vttermoste
perils.
