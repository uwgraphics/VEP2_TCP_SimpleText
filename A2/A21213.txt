live to him, walking in his Commandments all the days of my life.

Q Rehearse the Commandments?

A. HArken and take heed Israel, for I am the Lord Exodus 20.
thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house
of bondage.

1 Thou shall have no other Gods but me.

2 Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, nor in the earth beneath, nor in the water under
the earth: Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them, for I the Lord
thy God am aiealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto
thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

3. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord
will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

4. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: six days shall thou labor
and do all that thou have to do: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God: in it thou shall do no manner work, thou, nor thy son, nor
thy daughter, thy man servant, thy maid servant, thy cattle, nor the stranger
that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.

which the Lord thy God gives thee.

any thing that is his.

Q. What is the sum and effect of these Commandments?

A. Thou shall love the Lord thy Mat. 22. 37.
God with all thy heart, mind, and strength; and thy neighbor as thy self.

Q Is any man able to do these things perfectly in his life?

A. None at all. 2 Chr. 6. 36. Ecle. 7. 22.


Q why so?

A. Because no man is perfectly sanctified Romans 7. 14. 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Pro. 20. 9.
To. 7. 23. 24.
in this life.

Q. Yet must not we strive to perfection in fulfilling of Gods Commandments?

A. Doubtless, for otherwise there 1 These. 4. 1, Pro. 4. 18. Act. 15. 9, 2 Timothy 2, 19. Job 1, 1,
is neither faith nor fear of God in us.

Q. what must we do then, when we break any of these commandments.

A. We must run to God by repentance Act. 2, 37.
and Prayer. Hos. 14. 2. 3.


Q. what is Repentance?

A. It is the turning of my heart to Deu. 4. 29. 30 Joel 2. 13. 2 Cor. 7, 10.
Ezekiel. 18. 27. 28. 31. 32. Psalm. 39. 1. Job 31. 1.
God, with an unfeigned sorrow for offending his Majesty, and a constant
resolution to amend my life.

Q. what is Prayer?

A. It is calling on God, in the Psalm. ^0. 15 Ioh. 14. 14. Mat. 3, 33.
name of Christ, for things belonging to Gods glory, and our necessity.

Q. why is it not lawful to pray to Creatures, as to Angels, and Saints
glorified?

A. Because God has commanded Col. 2. 18. Reu 22. 9. Mat. 4, 10.
us to worship him alone.

Q why must we pray only in Christ's Name?

A. Because he is our only Mediator 1 Timothy 1, 2, 5. Ioh. 14, 6.
and intercessor.

Q How then should we pray?

A. According to that pattern of prayer Luke 11. 2.
which our Master has set before us, saying: When ye pray, say,

Our Father which art in heaven:

1. Hallowed be thy Name.

2. Thy Kingdom come.

3. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.

4. Give us this day our daily bread.

5. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us.

6. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is
the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen.

Q How are you assured that God will hear your Prayers?

A. By Christ's own Word, promising Joh 16. 23.
that whatsoever we ask the Father in his name, it shall be given us.

Q. what is the end of this your whole Religion?

A. Hereby God is glorified, and I Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 6.
am saved, through Jesus Christ my Lord, to whom be everlasting praise and
glory. Amen.

me quiet rest in soul and body, that I may better serve thee in both, through
Jesus Christ my gracious Lord and Savior. Amen.

I will lay me down in peace and sleep: for thou Lord only make me dwell in
safety. Psalm 4. 8. Grace before meat.
THe eyes of all things do look up and wait on thee (O Lord) thou give them

through Jesus Christ our Lord. So be it.

Another after meat. Matthew. 4. 4.
LOrd thou have said it, and we believe it, that man lives not by bread only,
but by every word that proceeds out of thy mouth: Therefore give us (we

A Method of Catechizing.
Of Religion in general.
Question. WHich is the only way to true happiness?

Answer. The true Acts 4. 12. Psalm. ^, 12. John 3, 36.
christian Religion.

Q. What is the true Christian Religion?

A. That which is agreeable to the 2 John 9,
Doctrine of Christ.

Q. Where is that Doctrine to be learned?

A. Only in the holy Scriptures, for they are able to make us wise unto
salvation, John ^, 39. 2 Timothy 3, 15. 16 17.
and perfect and meet for every good work.

Q. Wherein consists the true Christian Religion?

Joh. 3. 36. 1 John 2. 3. Jam. 1. 27. Eccle. 12. 13 Tit. 3. 8.
A. In true Faith, and good Works.

Q. Are both Faith and good works necessary to salvation or true happiness?

A. Both are necessary: for the Scripture says of the first, Mar. 16. 16
He that believes not, shall be condemned; and of the second, Mat. 3 10.
Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down and cast
into the fire.

Q. May not true faith be without good works?

A. Impossible: For Faith without good works, is dead in it self. Iam. 3. 17.


Q. May not good works be without true Faith?

A. Works without faith may be good in the eyes of men, but not so before
Genesis 4. 3, 4, 5 Heb. 11. 4. Heb. 11. 6. Romans 14. 23.
God: for without faith it is inpossible to please God: And all that is done
without fath, is sin.

The first Part, Of Faith.
Q. What do you call true Faith?

A. It is Ioh. 6. 69. Joh. 17. 2.
the true knowledge of God in Christ, Romans 4. 11. and 21. Heb. 11. 1. Heb. 10.
22.
with assurance of Salvation in him

Q. Rehearse the Articles of your Faith?

Ans: I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, etc.

Q. How divide you this form of confession?

A. In two parts: the first concerns Gods nature and works; the second
concerns Gods Church, and his gifts toward it.

Of Faith in God.
Q. What believe you concerning Gods Nature?

A. That he is one undivided Godhead, or divine essence, distinct in three 1
Cor. 8. 6. 1 Ioh. 5. 7. Joh. 1. 14. Ioh. 15. 26.
Persons; the Father, who from all eternity has begotten the Son; the Son,
who from all Eternity is begotten of the Father; and the Holy Ghost, who
proceeds from the Father and the Son.

Q. Must we not worship this one Godhead in the three Persons, and the three
persons in this one Godhead?

A. 2 Cor. 13. 13.
Doubtless: and therefore I say in my Creed Ioh. 14. 1.
I believe in God the Father, and in his Son, and in the holy Ghost; Heb. 11.
6. Ioh. 3. 33. Mat. 25. 8 9.
The first and chief part of Gods worship, being this, to believe in God.

Q. Why say you, as for your self alone, I believe?

A. Because every man must be saved Heb. 2. 4. Ioh. 3. 36. Mat. 25. 8. 9.
by his own Faith.

Q. What is it to believe in God?

A. It is not only to know and acknowledge him to be such a God, as he Acts
19, 15. Heb, 10, 19, 22 Heb, 11, 1, Psalm. 2, 12,
has revealed himself in his word, but also to put my trust and confidence in
him.

Q. Which are the props, and pillars of your confidence in God?

A. His Joh. 3. 16. 1 Ioh. 3. 1.
Fatherly affection, whereby he is willing, and his Luke 1. 37.
Almighty Power, whereby he is able Ephe. 3. 20
to give me all good things and 2 Timothy 4. 18
auert from me all evil, Romans 8. 28.
or turn them to my good.

Of the Creation and providence.
Q. Wherein does he show his fatherly affection, and almighty Power?

A. In his works of Creation, and Act. 17. 24. 28 John 3. 16. To. 1. 19. 10.
Heb. 1. 3. Romans 1. 4. Ephesians. 1. 19. 20. Job 12. 9. 10. Heb 1. 3. Romans 11. 36.
Acts, 17. 25. 27 28.
redemption.

Q. And say you nothing of his wise and wonderful providence, whereby he gouerns
ye World?

A. I comprehend it under the Creation; because as the World once by Creation
was made and set in order, so it has ever since bin continued in being and
order by the providence of God.

Q. Is the providence of God extended toward all things that has being?

A. Yea, even to the sparrowes, and Mat. 10. 29. 30
hairs of our head?

Q. Has his providence place also in things which be evil?

A. Yea in the baddest actions of the Genesis 50. 20. 2 Samuel 16. 10 Job. 1. 21.
Acts. 2. 23. Acts 4. 27.
wicked: for even in those he works well, and directs them to his own
glory, and to our comfort.

Q. Then it appears that nothing in this world does fall out by chance?

A. Nothing at all: for whatsoever Pro. 16. 30. Exodus 21. 30. Job. 14. 5. Acts
17. 28. Act. 4 27. 28.
falls out in this World, is directed, ruled, and moved by God, according to
the determinate counsel of his good will, which was before all worlds.

Q. I see now, how God being called the maker of Heaven and Earth, must be
understood to be also the Governor of all things; therefore tell me
concerning the Creation of Man, in what estate God made him?

A. In the Genesis 1. 31
beginning God made all things very good, and Genesis 1. 26 27.
above the rest he made Man according to his own Image Ephesians. 4. 24.
in righteousness and true holiness.

Of the Fall of Man.
Q. How fell we from that good estate?

A. By the disobedience of our first Gen 6. 3. 6. 1 Timothy 2. 14.
parents Adam and Eve.

Q. Whence came their disobedience?

A. From Satan, and the abuse of Genesis 3.
their own free will.

Q. How so?

A. Satan, when he had lost his original, Jud. 6. John 8. 44. 1 Timothy 2. 14. 2
Cor. 11. 3.
and fallen from the truth himself, became a murderer of them by intising
them, and they willingly giving way to his temptation, made filthy apostasy
from God.

Of Original sin.
Q. Are we guilty of their sin?

A. Doubtless, because we sinned in them being in their loins, to stand or
To. 5. 12. 18. Heb. 7. 9.
fall with them.

Q. What punnishment have we incurred by their transgression?

A. Thereby we are made guilty of To. 5. 16. 18. To. 3. 10. etc. Genesis 6. 5.
Psalm. 51. 5.
death and condemnation, we have lost the Image of God, and are polluted in
all the powers of soul and body, even from our conception.

Q. How far has this corruption prevailed over us?

A. So far that we all by nature are Ioh. 8. 34. Romans 6. 16. Romans 3. 12. Romans
8. 7. 1 Cor 2. 14. Genesis 6. 5.
slaves to sin, unable for all good, and bent to all evil.

Q. What produces this corruption in us?

A. All manner of actual sins, in Romans 7. 17. Jam. 1. 15.
thought, word and deed.

Q. Is not God angry with us, both for our original and actual sins?

A. Wonderfully: and punishes both Ephesians. 2. 3. Romans 5. 14. Deuteronomy. 27. 28. Mat.
25. 41.
with his fearful curse, in all kind of plagues in this world, and hell fire
in the world to come.

Of Man's Deliverance.
Q How are we delivered from this infinite misery?

A. By the free mercy of God in Jesus 2 Timothy 1. 91 Ephesians. 2. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 30.
Christ, who is given of the Father to be our Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification, and Redemption.

Of Christ's Person.
Q. What kind of Person is Jesus Christ?

A. He is one Person, very God, equal Philip 2. 6. He. 2. 14. etc. Heb. 4. 15.
Heb. 7. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 21
with the Father, and very Man, like us in all things, sin only excepted.

Q. How confess you him to be very God?

A. I confess him to be God, professing Ioh. 14. 1. Ier. 17. 5.
that I believe in him; John 1. 18.
that he is the only begotten or natural Son of the Father; Romans 1. 4. Io.
10. 17. 18
and that he rose from death by his own power.

Q. How confess you him to be Man?

A. I confess him to be Man when I say that he was borne of a Woman: and that
he died by the sentence of a Judge. Gal. 4. 4, Luke 23. 24.


Q. How confess you him to be without sin?

A. By ascribing his conception, not to the power of nature, but to the Luke 1.
4, 5.
Holy Ghost.

Q Why was it necessary that he should be without sin?

A. Because every sinner stands in Heb. 13. 14. Deuteronomy. 4 24. 1 Pet. 3. 18.
need of a Mediator for himself.

Q Why was it requisite that he should be both God and Man?

A. It behooued him Heb. 2. 14. 15.
to be man, that he might die for man; Romans 1. 4,
and to be God, that in dying he might overcome death, Ioh. 5. 21. Joh. 17. 2.
22.
and give eternal life to every true believer.

Q. Why say you, he was both God and man in one person?

A. Because the eternal Son of God Heb. 2. 16.
in his miraculous conception, assumed, not the person, but the nature of man
in the unity of his own person.

Q. How then must we consider the two natures in one person?

A. 1 Pet. 3. 18. Acts 20. 28. Gal. 4. 4, Joh. 3. 13.
Without confusion of the Natures, Tim. 3. 16.
or division of the person.

Q. Why say you without confusion of the Natures?

A. Because the divine and humane Rom 1. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 3. 18.
natures remain distinct both in themselves, and in their properties.

Q. Why say you, without division of the Person?

A. Because the Lord Jesus is the Romans 1. 3, 4. John 1. 14.
Son of God, and the Son of Man: and yet but one person; his man-head
subsisting not in it self, but in the eternal word

Q. Does not this personal union of the humane nature with the eternal word
and Son of God, tend greatly to the glory of the humane nature of Jesus Christ?

A. Out of question: for hence it is that in both the natures (that is, as he
is God-and-man jointly) 1 Timothy 2. 5
he is the Mediator, Mat. 1. 21.
the Savior, and Ephesians. 1. 22
head of his Church; Joh. 5. 23. Heb. 1. 6. Reu. 5. 12. 13. 14.
to be adored, Ioh. 14. 1. 1 Timothy 1. 16.
believed in, and Act. 7. 59.
called on.

Of Christ's office.
Q. Having spoken of his Person, now show me concerning his office: and first
why call you him Jesus, that is, a Savior?

A. So he is called, because he saues his people from Luke 2. 11.
sin, and Heb. 2. 14. 15.
death, and gives unto them 1 Cor. 1. 30 Ier. 23. 6.
righteousness, and Ioh. 10. 18.
life.

Q. Then is our whole Salvation in him, and from him?

A. Certainly, for the Scripture testifies that all fullness is in him; that in
him we are complete and that there is no Salvation Col. 1. 19. Col. 2. 3. 10.
Acts 4. 12.
in any other.

Q Why is he called Christ: that is Anointed?

A. Because John 6. 27. 1 Pet. 1 20.
by the Father he was appointed Isa. 61. 1. Psalm. 45. John 3. 34. Col. 1. 19.
Col. 2. 3. 9. Joh. 1. 14. 16.
and endowed with gifts, to be unto us his people, a Prophet, a Priest, and a
King.

Q. Why was he made a Prophet?

A. That he might reveal unto us the Deuteronomy. 18. 18 John 1. 18. John 15. 15.
Joh. 16. 13. 14 Jsa. 61. 1. 1 Pet 3. 19.
whole counsel and will of God, concerning our Salvation.

Q. Why was he made a Priest?

A. That by the Sacrifice of himself once offered, he might reconcile us unto
Heb. ^. 26. Heb. 7. 25.
God, and continually make intercession for us.

Q. Why was he made a King?

A. Iam. 2. 8. Jam. 4. 12. Romans 3. 27. Mat. 28. 20.
That he might give us a royal Law, whereby to believe, and live; Heb. 10. 16
Heb. 12. 2. Acts 16. 14. Heb. 2. 11.
that he might incline our hearts to the obedience of his Law, Deu. 33. 29 Psa.
119. 114
that he might powerfully defend, and 1 Cor. 15. 58. Heb. 6. 10. 2 Timothy 4 8.
John 10. 28
bountifully reward his faithful Subjects, Psalm. 110. 1
and make all his enemies his footstool.

Q. Why call you him our Lord?

A Because he has delivered us from the power of darkness, to be a peculiar
Col. 1. 13. Tit. 2 14.
people to himself.

Of the execution of his Office.

Q. How has he accomplished this deliverance?

A. By his humiliation, and axaltation. Ephesians. 4 9. Romans 4. 25. Phil. 2. 7, 8,


Q. Wherein stands his Humiliation?

A. In his incarnation and suffering.

Q. What comprehends his incarnation? Phil. 2. 7. 8.


A. His Conception and Birth.

Q. Under whom suffered Christ?

A. Under Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor.

Q. Why was he condemned by a mortal Man?

A. That we might be absolved by the To. 5. 18. 19.
immortal God.

Q. In what nature suffered he?

A: Only 1 Pe. 3. 18
in his humane nature: for Jam. 1. 17,
the divine nature is impassible, and not subject to suffering.

Q. In what part of his humane nature suffered he?

A. Both in his Body and Soul.

Q. What suffered he in his body?

A. He was crucified, in Gal. 3. 13.
token that he bore the curse of the Law for us: Heb. 2. 14. 1 Cor. 15. 55. 56.
57.
he died to free us from death: and was Romans 1. 4.
buried for the greater certenty of his death, and the greter glory of his
resurrection.

Q. Why say you he has saved us from death, since it is Heb. 9. 27
appointed for all men once to die?

A. Our death is Romans 5. 1.
no satisfaction for sin, Romans 6. 7. 1 Cor. 15. 26.
but the abolishing of sin in us; Phil. 1. 23.
and a passage to life everlasting.

Q. What suffered he in his Soul?

A. Being, in a manner, Mat. 27. 46
left of God for a season, he Mat. 26. 37 38. 39. Gal. 3. 13.
suffered extreme anguish and horror, under the sense of the fearful wrath and
curse of God, which here is called his descending into hell.

Q What benifit have we by his suffering?

A. All that he suffered in Soul and Body was for me; to free my soul and 1
Pet. 3. 18. Heb 9. 28. 2 Cor. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 6. 20. 1 These. 5. 23.
body from everlasting torments, which I deserve for my sins.

Q. How could it stand with the Justice of God to punish him for our sins, the
righteous for the unrighteous?

A. The Lord Jesus made our sins his own, by his willing taking them on 1
Pet. 2 24. 2 Cor. 5. 23. 1 Ioh. 3. 5, 1 Timothy 2. 6.
him, as our surety and pledge.

Q But how could his sufferings that were shortly ended, free us from
everlasting punishment?

A. Albeit his sufferings were finite in time, yet in value they were infinite:
because they were the sufferings of the eternal 1 Pet. 1. 18. 19. Acts 20. 28.
Son of God.

Q. Having spoken of his Humiliation, tell me which are the degrees of his
exaltation?

A. His Resurrection from Death; his Ascension into Heaven; and his sitting
Luke 24* Acts 1. Heb. 1.
at the right hand of God.

Q. What benefit have we by his Resurrection from death?

A. Thereby Hos. 13. 14. Heb. 2. 14. Romans 1. 4.
he has manifested his victory over death, he Romans 4. 25.
makes us partakers of the righteousness purchased by his death, Romans 6. 4.
he raises us up to newnes of life, Romans 8. 11.
and assures us of our resurrection.

Q. Why ascended he up to heaven?

A. That there he might Joh. 14. 3.
prepare a place for us, and Romans 8. 34
make intercession for us; and that we might follow him, Col. 3. 2
in our affections while we are here, Phil. 2. 23. Luke 23 42.
in our souls at the hour of death, 1 These. 4, 17
and in our bodies at the day of the Resurrection.

Q. What Imports his sitting at the right hand of God?

A. By this speech, ^ Kin 2. 19
borrowed from the manner of men, is signified Mat. 28 18 Ephesians. 1. 22.
that the Father has set him over all things, to be the head of the Church;
Joh. 5. 22.
and the Judge of the World.

Q. What profit have we by this glory of Christ, our head?

A. He imployes this glory and power to our vtility, Ephesians. 4. 8. 10 11.
in pouring out his gifts Ephesians. 4. 12.
on us his members Ioh. 14. 16. 26. 1 Cor. 6. 11.
by his holy Spirit; Ioh 10. 28. Psalm. 29.
and in protecting us against our enemies.

Q. When shall this glory of our Lord be manifested to all the world?

A. In the last day, when he shall come 1 These. 4. 15. 16. 17. 1 Pet. 4. 5.
to judge the quick and the dead.

Q. What shall become of those that shall be living at his coming?

A. They shall all be changed, and this 1 Cor. 15. 52
change shall be in place of death to them.

Of the Holy Ghost.
Q. By whom is this redemption thus accomplished in the humiliation, and
exaltation of our Savior, applied unto us?

A. By the holy Spirit in our Sanctification. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Ephesians. 1. 13. Gal. 5.
5. ^ Cor. 2. 12. 2 Cor. 1. 21. 22.


Q. Why is the third Person of the Trinity peculiarly called the Spirit: John
4. 24 1 Cor. 3. 17
Seeing God the Father, and the Son also, is a Spirit? Romans 8. 9.


A. He is so called from his Personal property; Joh. 15. 26.
because he proceeds from the Father and the Son, Isa. 61. 1. Romans 8. 9 11
Gal. 4. 6.
as the Spirit of both.

Q. Why is he particularly called Holy, Jsa. 6. 3. Jos. 24. 19.
seeing holiness is an essential property of God, and so is common to all the
three Persons

A He is called holy not from his essential property, but from his work of
Sanctification and holiness wrought in us; Romans 8. 13.
because he is the immediate worker thereof.

Of the Church.
Q To whom does this Redemption, purchased by Christ, and applied by the
Spirit, belong?

A. To the whole Church universal, John 17. 20. 21. etc. Acts. 13. 48.
and every particular member thereof.

Q. What call you the Church universal?

A. The whole company of the faithful, Mat: 16. 18. Heb. 13. 23. Ephesians. 1. 4.
To. 9. 23. 24
whom God has chosen to life in Christ, before all Worlds.

Q. Why is this Church called Holy?

A. Because every true member thereof, is 2 Timothy 1. 9.
by an holy calling, Ioh. 17. 65 9. 14.
separated from the world, 1 Pet. 1. 15. 16 Deuteronomy. 14. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 9.
to be holy to the Lord; is Gal. 3. 27. Romans 13. 14.
clothed with the perfect holiness of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 24. Tit. 3. 5.
and is endowed with the Image of God in true holiness, Ephesians. 5. 25. 26. 27. 1
Cor. 1. 8* Phil. 1. 6. 1 These. 4 13.
begun here, to be accomplished in the world to come.

Q Why is the Church called Universal?

A. Because it comprehends the whole number of the elect and faithful, Heb.
12. 23. Ephesians. 1. 10. Epc. 2. 16.
of all times, places, and people.

Q. Which are the parts of this Church Universal?

A. The Church militant on earth, and Ephesians. 6 12. 2 Timothy 4. 7. 8
the Church triumphant in Heaven.

Q. May not the Church militant upon the earth, amongst all Nations, be called
Universal?

A. Yes, and so the Christian Church Deuteronomy. 4. 7. 8. Rom 9. 23. 24. 25.
of old was called: to distinguish it from the Synagog of the Jews; which was
tied to one people and place: but here the whole is called Universal, and that
more properly then any part of the whole can be called.

Q Why say you not, I believe in the Church, as you said before; I believe in
God?

A. Because we must believe in God Mat. 4. 10. Jer. 17. 5. Psalm. 118. 8. Psalm.
146. 3. 1 Timothy 6. 17
only.

Q. And why say you; I believe there is a Church?

A. Because Faith is the evidence of Heb. 11. 1. Romans 2. 29. 2 Timothy ^. 19. Romans
2. 29.
things that are not seen: and this Church is invisible to mortal eyes, as
being the company of Gods elect and secret ones, who are known to God alone.

Q What than call you a visible Church?

A. Any particular Congregation in ^ Tim. 1. 7. 8. Psalm. 22 22.
any place, making profession of the Faith Romans 16, 5. Phile. 2.
of Christ.

Q. Are all the Congregations that make profession of the Faith of Christ, true
visible Churches?

A. No: but only those Ioh. 10. 27 Romans 10. 17.
where Gods Word is Preached, Mat. 28. 19 20. Act. 2. 41. 42
the Sacraments are Ministered, and Ioh. 4. 22. Deuteronomy. 6. 13.
God alone is worshipped, according to his Word.

Q. Are all such Churches alike pure?

A. No, but as the purity of Doctrine Gal. 3. 1, 2. 3. Gal. 4. 9. 10. 11. etc.
Heb. 8. 5. 2 Timothy 1. 15.
and worship has degrees, so these Churches are purest, where the Doctrine and
worship is most pure: that is, most agreeable to the word of God.

Q. Are all they that are of a visible Church, members also of that Holy
Catholic Church which we believe?

A. No: but of a visible Church, are Mat. 13. 47. 48. 49. Romans 9. 27. Romans 2.
27. 28. 29. Mat. 20. 16.
both clect and reprobate, good and bad, which make outward profession of the
faith, being externally called by the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments.

Of the Ministry.
Q. To whom belongs it to Minister the Word and Sacraments?

A. Only to those that are called by Mat. 28. 19. 20. Romans 10. 15. Ephesians 4. 8.
11. Jsa. 50. 4.
Christ and his Tit. 1. 5. 1 Timothy 5. 22. Act. 6. 3. 5, 6,
Church unto that holy Function.

Q. What power has Christ given unto them that are thus called?

A. He has given them the power of Binding and Loosing of sins. Mat 16. 19.
Mat. 18. 18. Ioh. 20. 23.


Q. Wherein stands this Power?

A. In the Ministry of the word, of the 1 Cor. 2. 15. 16. 1 Cor. 11. 27. 29.
Mat. 16. 19. Luke 11. 52. Reu. 3. 7.
Sacraments, and of the censures; which therefore are called the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven.

Q. How does the Ministers of Christ open, and shut with these Keys?

A. They open by anouncing remission of sins to the penitent; and they shut,
by Ioh. 3. 16. 35. 36. Act. 2. 36. Ephesians. 5. 5. Mar. 16. 16. Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17,
1 Cor. 5. 11. 12. 13. Ioh. 2. 10.
denouncing Judgment to the impenitent: and this they do more generally by the
Ministry of the word, and more particularly, by the Ministry of the
Sacraments and Censures.

Q. What is the end of this Ministry in the Church?

A. The purging of the Church from offenses, and the gathering of the Saints
unto Christ, that by him in time they 1 Cor. 5. 6 Ephesians. 4. 12, Ephesians. 1 4. 5,
may enjoy the benefits allotted to them before all Worlds.

Q. Which be those benefits?

A. They be two in this World, the communion of Saints, and the remission of
sins: and two in the World to come: The resurrection of the body, and life
everlasting.

Communion of Saints.
Q. What call you the Communion of Saints?

A. It is that fellowship which they 1 John 1. ^. Col. 2. 12. Romans 12. 5. 1
Cor. 10. 16. 17.
that are sanctified have with Christ their head by faith, and amongst
themselves by love. Ephesians. 4. 4, Ephesians. 3. 6, 17. Phile. 5 6. 7. 1 Cor 12. 13.


Q. Wherein consists our fellowship with Christ our head by Faith?

A. In this, that Christ is ours, and 1 Cor. 3. 23. Cant. 6. 2. John 15 4. Col.
1. 14. John 17. 19. 1 Cor. 1. 30.
we are Christ's; that his suffering is our satisfaction; and that all the
benefits procured by his suffering are also ours.

Q. Wherein stands our fellowship amongst our selves by love? 1 Cor. 12. 26.
Romans 12. 15. Ephesians 6. 18. 19. 1 Timothy 2. 1. Acts 4. 32. Rom, 12. 1 Cor, 12. Phil.
2. 4.


A. In our mourning and rejoicing together, in our praying every one for
another; and in extending the gifts bestowed on any of us, to the common
benefit of the body.

Remission of Sins.
Q. What call you Remission of Sins?

A. Act. 26 18. Romans 4. 5, 6, 7 8, 9.
Otherways it is called Justification, Rom 8. 33. Mat. 9. 8.
and it is that action of God, Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. Romans 3. 20. 24. 28. Phil 3 9.
where by of his free grace, without our deserving, he 2 Cor. 5. 19 Romans 4. 5,
6. 7, 8. Mich. 7. 19. Jsa. 38. 17. Ier 31. 34.
reputes and pronounces us to be righteous, as if we had never sinned: and that
for the obedience and righteousness of 2 Cor. 5 21. Romans 5. 19. Phil 2. 8.
Jsa. 53. 5.
Christ, applied Ioh 1. 12. Gal. 3. 14. Act. 26. 18.
to us by Faith.

Q. Then your meaning is, that Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 3. 14. Act. 16. 18, Romans 3. 2.
Romans 5. 1. Phil 3. 9.
Faith is the Instrument which takes hold on Christ's righteousness, whereby
we are justified, Romans 5. 19. Romans 3. 24.
and that the whole merit and cause of our Justification, is in the
righteousness of Christ, Romans 3* 28.
and not in the apprehension of our Faith

A. So I do think, and steadfastly believe.

Q. Why reckon you the Resurrection of of the body, amongst the gifts of God in
Christ bestowed on his Church, seeing the wicked also shall rise in the last
day?

A. The resurrection of the wicked is no benifit to them; but the resurrection
of 2 Cor. 5. 10. Joh. 5. 28. 29 To. 20. 12. 13 Acts 24. 15.
the just, is an inestimable benefit to them.

Q. Why is the resurrection of the wicked no benefit to them?

A. Because they are not partakers of the first resurrection, which is from
Reu. 20. 5. 6.
sin, in this life.

Q. What follows thereupon?

A. Hence it is, that in the second resurrection Mat. 25. Dan. 12. 2.
they rise in sin, in shame, and sorrow; by the power of Christ being forced to
get up, and present themselves before the angry Judge of the world, to here
their sentence condemnatorie, and accordingly to be cast into hell, there to
sustain the judgment of everlasting fire.

Q Why is the resurrection of the godly an inestimable benefit to them?

A. Because in this life they are made Reu. 20. 6.
partakers of the first resurrection; therefore in the world to come the second
death shall have no power over them.

Q. How then do they rise, and to what end?

A: They rise in righteousness, in Phil 3. 20. Mat. 13. 43.
glory, and joy, being quickened by the Spirit of Christ their head, to be
presented in the presence of their gracious Lord and Savior: that from his
mouth they Mat. 25. 34. 2 Timothy 4. 8.
may hear sentence of absolution pronounced upon them, and accordingly may
enter in full possession of life everlasting.

Q What call you life everlasting?

A. It is Ep. 4. 18. 22. Ioh. 17. 2. John 5. 24. Col. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 1. 9.
that life of God begun in my soul here, and for ever 2 Timothy 4. 8. 1 Ioh. 3.
2. Col. 3. 3. 4, Psalm. 16. 11. Jsa. 60. 18. 19 Phil. 3. 21. 1 Cor. 2. 9. Ioh.
17. 2^.
to be continued in perfect happiness of soul and body hereafter, when God
shall be 1 Cor. 1^* 28
all in all to me.

Of particular assurance.
Q Do you believe that these foresaid benefits do belong to you in particular?

A. Yea, by the grace of my God I do so believe: the Lord help my unbelief.

Q. How are you assured that they belong Mar. 9. 24.
to you in particular?

A. I know by the Gospel, Ioh: 3. 16.
that they belong to all that believe, and 1 Cor. 4. 13 2 Cor. 2. 11.
being privy to my self that I am one of those that believe, according as I
confess in my Creed, 2 Timothy 4. 8.
why should I doubt, but these benefits do belong to me?

Q. But is it of your self that you believe these things?

A. Ephesians. 2. 8.
No, it is of the Holy Ghost; who therefore is called 2 Cor. 4. 13
the Spirit of Faith, Ephesians. 1. 13. Romans 8. 15. Gal. 4. 6.
the spirit of promise, the seal, and witness of God unto us, and the earnest
of our inheritanes.

Of the Covenant.
Q. By what means does he work it in you?

A. By the Word of God.

Q. What call you the word of God?

A. The Doctrine of the Prophets and 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Pet. 1. 25. Ephesians. 2. 20.
Apostles, contained in the books of the old and new Testament.

Q. Which is the chief subject or matter handled in the Word?

A. The Covenant. Heb. 8. 8. 9. 10. etc. Acts 3. 25.


Q. What Covenant?

A. Even that Covenant of grace and peace, which the Lord God was graciously
Genesis 3. 15. 2 Timothy 1. 9. 10
pleased to make with man, after man had broken that former Covenant made with
him in his Creation.

Q. What do you call that first Covenant which God made with man in the
Creation?

A. I do call it the Covenant of Genesis 2. 16. 17.
works, and of Nature.

Q. Why do you call it so?

A. Because in it God promised that Gal. 3, 12.
man should live in happiness for ever, under condition that he should
continue in the holy works of Gods perfect obedience according to the purity
of his nature.

Q. Is any man able to get life now by that first Covenant made with Adam?

A. None at all: for Adam by breaking Romans 3. 20. Gal. 2. 16. Gal. 3. 11. 21.
Romans 8. 3.
the condition of that covenant, not only deprived himself, and us, of life
promised in the Covenant, but also made us unable to fulfill the condition
thereof.

Q. Why then does God in his Law urge us with no less pain than his curse, to
fulfill that impossible condition of perfect obedience to the Law?

A. Romans 7. 7, 13.
That the wickedness of sin may appear; Romans 3. 19.
that every mouth may be stopped, all being declared to be guilty of the
condemnation of God; Romans 10. 4. Gal. 3. 22. 23
and that every one of us may be urged to betake us to Christ, and to the
Covenant of grace Gal. 3. 22. 23. 24.
made by him.

Q. What is promised to us in the covenant of grace made in Christ?

A. Remission of sins, righteousness, Heb. 8. 8, 9. 10. 11, 1^. Heb. 9. 12. 15
Joh. 3. 16.
and life everlasting.

Q. Under what condition is this promise made?

A. Under condition of Faith, and new obedience. Ioh. 13. 34. Joh. 15. 10 Ioh.
13. 17. Gal. 6. 16. 1 Timothy 1 19.


Q. Why is it called the covenant of grace, seeing the promise in it is not
made freely, but under a condition to be performed on our part?

A. Because God not Genesis 3. 15. Ephesians. 2. 7. 8,
only of his free grace made this covenant with man after his fall, Tit. 2.
11. Isa 9. 6. 1 John 4. 9, John 4. 10.
but also of the same grace gives unto him Christ, Heb. 9. 15. Jsai. 42. 6.
the Mediator of the Covenant, and Phil. 1. 29. Ephesians. 2. 8.
faith in him, to fulfill the condition thereof.

Q. Why is it called the Covenant of peace?

A. Because the end thereof, is peace Ephesians. 2. 14. 2 Cor. 5. 18 19.
and reconciliation with God.

Q. Were the Patriarchs, and Prophets of old saved by this Covenant?

A. They were: For Jesus Christ Reu. 13. 8.
was a Lamb slain from the beginning of the world.

Q. Declare that more plainly?

A. The death of Jesus was not only Gal. 3. 8. John 8. 26.
decreed from all eternity; but also was promised, was shadowed, and was
effectual from the beginning of the world, to save them that believed the
promise, and by faith did see his day.

Q. Are we than the same way saved as they were?

A. Act 15. 11. 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2. 3, etc.
Certainly, Heb. 13. 8. Mar. 16. 16. Ioh. 3 17. 18.
for Jesus Christ, yesterday, to day, and for ever is the same: that is all men
that ever were saved that now are saved, or hereafter shall be saved, had,
have, and shall have salvation by Jesus Christ alone.

Q. Then it appears there is no salvation unto man, but by believing the
promise of this Covenant of grace, which is the Gospel?

A. Nothing more certain. Acts 4. 12.


Q. And what if a man seek salvation by the works of the law, and refuse to
embrace the condition of this Covenant?

A. He is under the curse of the Law, Gal. 3. 10. Heb. 10. 26. John 3. 36.
neither is there any sacrifice for his sin, but the wrath of God abides upon
him for ever.

Of the Sacraments in general.
Q This Doctrine stirs me up to seek strengthening of my faith, therefore, as
you taught me whence, and by what means we attain to faith; show me
likewse, I pray you, by whom, and how it is confirmed?

A. The Lord, Heb. 12. 2. 1 Cor. 1. 8.
who is the Author and finisher of our faith, Romans 1. 17 1 Pet. 2 1, 2, Act.
20. 3^.
confirms it by the same word of the covenant, whereby it is wrought, Romans 4.
11.
and by the Sacraments.

Q. What call you the Sacraments?

A. They are visible signs, and seals Genesis 17. 11. Romans 4. 11. Mat. 28. 18. 1
Cor. 10. 16
of the Gospel, or Covenant of grace, ordained of God to confirm my faith in
the promise thereof.

Q. How do they confime your faith in the promise of the Gospel?

A. By receiving them as sure pledges Mat. 26. 26. 27.
from God, that Christ crucified is given to me in particular, to be my Savior.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. Two: Baptism, and the Lords Mat. 28. 18. 1 Cor. 11. 23. 1 Cor. 10. 2, 3, 4,
Supper.

Of Baptism:
Q What is Baptism?

A. It is the Sacrament of Romans 6. 3. 4, 5. Col. 2. 12.
my incorporation in Christ, Ephesians. 5. 26. Joh. 1. 33. Act. 9. 36. 38.
by dipping, washing, or sprinkling with water, Act. 22. 16.
sealing up my spiritual washing from sin, in his 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
blood, and Ioh. 3. 5.
Spirit.

Q. What understand you by your washing the blood of Christ?

A. The remission of my sins in the Romans 5. 9: Romans 6. 3. Gal. 3. 27.
merit of his blood.

Q* What understand you by your washing in the Spirit of Christ?

A. The renouation of my heart by John 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5. Mat. 3. 11.
the virtue of his Spirit.

Q. When you think your Baptism Gods seal to you, whereby your faith is
further confirmed in the remission of your sins, and your heart is more
deeply marked with the print of Sanctification?

A. Albeit I could not know that Romans 4. 11. Tit. 3. 5 1 Cor. 9. 2.
when I was baptized, being an infant, yet now, through the grace of my God, I
feel not only my faith further confirmed, but my heart also further renewed,
in consideration of my Baptism.

Q. And why are the children of Christians Baptized?

A. Because the promise of the Covenant Mat. 19. 14* 15 1 Cor. 7. 14. Col. 2.
11. 12.
belongs to them, and their children.

Of the Lords Supper.
Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. It is the Sacrament of my spiriall Joh. 6. 50 5^ Ephesians. 4. 13. 1^.
nourishment, and further growth in Christ.

Q How does the Lords Supper confirm your faith in the promise of the Covenant?

A. Being thereby assured, that as my 1 Cor 10, 16 Joh. 6. 50. 51 53. Ioh. 6.
35 and 47
body lives feeds, and grows by meat and drink, so my soul lives,
feeds, and increases on, and by Jesus Christ, who died for me, that I might
live.

Q. Which are the external signs in the Sacrament of the Supper?

A. The signs are; first, the elements 1 Cor. 11. 23. 24. etc.
of bread and wine, nixt, the sacramental rites and actions; which are,
breaking, pouring, giving, taking, eating, drinking.

Q. What is represented, and sealed, by these elements, and actions.

A. Jesus Christ, his sufferings, and 1 Cor. 10. 16. 1 Cor. 11. 24
benefits, together with our communion with him, his sufferings, and benefits.

Q. What then are the bread and wine in the Sacrament?

A. They are the body and blood of the Lord.

Q. Are the bread and wine changed in the Lords body and blood?

A. No; for the Sacrament changes 1 Cor. 11. 28
their use, but not their substance.

Q. Yet they are verily his body and blood?

A. I believe them verily so to be, because Joh. 14. 6.
Christ, who is the verity it self, has said it.

Q. As you are surely persuaded that they are his body and blood, are you also
resolved how they are his body and blood?

A. That is a mystery, wherein I do 1 Cor. 4. 6.
not crave to be wise above that which is written; but, so far as I am
taught by the word, I believe them so to be called, because by them the Lords
body and blood are not only represented and offered, but John 3. 36.
also truly given to the true believer.

Q. Hence it must follow, that we eat his body, and drink his blood by
believing assuredly, that his body was broken, and his blood was shed for us?

A. Certainly: For this Sacrament is the communion of the body and blood of 1
Cor. 10. 16 Ephesians. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 6. 17. 1 Ioh. 3. 24. 1 John 4. 13 John 1. 12.
Joh. 6. 61. 63. Gal. 3. 14. Act. 26. 18.
Christ, and as our whole communion with Christ is spiritual, not carnal; so
we receive him, we eat his body, and drink his blood, not carnally, but
spiritually, and by faith.

Q* You have satisfied me concerning the elements, now show me touching the
sacramental actions, and first, what is the breaking of the bread, and pouring
out of the wine?

A. The breaking and pouring represent 1 Cor. 11. 24 25. Mat. 26. 28. Js. 53.
5. 10.
the sufferings of the Lord, and the benefits procured by his suffering; for
those two cannot be separated.

Q. What imports the giving, taking, eating, and drinking?

A. Those be signs, and seals whereby the holy Ghost represents and applies
Ioh. 3. 16. Gal. 2. 20. John 1. 12. Gal. 3. 14. Act. 26. 18. Ioh. 6. 47. 48
Christ, his sufferings, and benefits to the believing receiver.

Q. Is it requisite that we distinctly consider all these mystical actions,
when we receive?

A. Yes verily, if we would have our 1 Cor. 11. 29 Romans 4. 11.
knowledge made more clear, and our confidence made more sure.

Q. How should we be prepared when we come to receive?

A. We should come: first, with Mat. 3. 2. Zach. 12, 10.
repentance, mourning for our sins that procured the Lords death: Secondly,
with Act ^. 36. 37.
faith, believing the remission of our sins in the Lords death: Thirdly, with
love Mat. 5. 24.
being reconciled to them that we have offended, Ephesians. 4. 32. Col. 3. 13.
and freely forgiving them that have offended us, even as God for Christ sake
has freely forgiven us.

Q What if a man communicate, being void of repentance, faith, and love?

A. He eats and drinks unworthily, to his own damnation; and is guilty of
1 Cor. 11. 27. 30.
the body and blood of the Lord.

Q. Should those, who in their lives are manifestly wicked, be admitted unto
the holy Communion?

A. Mat. 7. 6. Leu. 10. 10. Number. 5. 2, 3, 1 Cor. 10. 21
By no means: For so 1 Cor. 11. 27. Isa 66. 3. Psalm. 50. 16. Mal. 1. 7,
the Covenant of God is profaned, and the 1 Cor. 11. 30.
wrath of God is kindled against the whole congregation: Therefore Mat. 18. 17
the Church using the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, according to the command
of Christ and his Apostles, should hold such a man back from the Sacrament,
unto 2 Cor. 2. 7, 8.
the time he repent and amend his life.

Q. But, if after trial, a man find in himself a very great measure of sin,
and a very small measure of grace, may he come to the Lords Table without
danger?

A. Yea, and Mat. 11. 28 Mat. 9. 12. Luke 14. 21.
with great profit, if he be deeply displeased for his sinful imperfections,
and ardently Mat. 5. 6.
thirst for a further measure of perfection in Jesus Christ.

The second Part, Of good Works.
Q. IN the beginning you said; that true Religion consisted in Faith and good
works; therefore, having spoken of Faith, show me which be those you call Good
works?

A. These I call good works, which Act. 15. 9. 1 Timothy 1 5. Heb. 11. 6.
are done in faith, to the glory of Gods name, according to his command.

Q* Why must they be done to the glory of Gods name?

A. Because howsoever we must do good works, Jam. 2. 18. 1 John 1. 6* 7,
to testify our faith in God, Psa. 116. 12 13.
to testify our thankfulness to God, 2 Per. 1. 10
to make our election sure, 1 Pet. 3. 1.
and to winue others by our good example; 1 Cor. 10. 31. Col. 3. 17:
yet in all these our chief purpose should be, that we may glorify God in all.

Q Why must they be done according to Gods command?

A. Because God accepts no service of us, howsoever right in our eyes, but
Deu 12. 8. 14 Deuteronomy. 4. 2 Mat. 15. 9.
that which is warranted by his Law and Commandments.

Of the Moral Law.
Q Which is that Law of God, whereby our actions must be warranted and ruled?

A. The Moral Law, set down in the Exodus 20. 1. Deuteronomy. 5 6.
20. of Exodus. And God spoke all these words, etc.

Q. How is this Law divided?

A. In two Tables. Deu. 10. 2, 3.


Q. What contains the first Table?

A. In four Commandments, it prescribs 2 Pet. 1. ^, 7. 1 Timothy 4 7. Mich. 6. 8.
all the dutis we owe to God, which are properly called the works of piety.

Q. Which are these works of piety?

A. 1. That we worship God alone: 2. According to his word, not our will: 3.
That we think and speak reverently of him, his titles, word, and works: 4.
And that we separate our selves on the Sabbath for his public worship.

Q. Which is the sum of these four precepts, and duties of piety?

A Thou shall love the Lord thy God Mat. 22. 37. 1 Timothy 1. 5.
with all thy mind, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with thy whole
strength.

Q. What contains the second Table?

A. In six Commandments it prescribes 2 Pet. 1. 3, 7. Romans 13. 9.
all the duties we owe to men, which are usually called the works of charity.

Q. Which be these?

A. That we strive by all means to advance our Neighbors 1. Estate, 2.
Person, 3. Chastity, 4. Goods, 5. Name, 6. And that we do not so much as
think an evil thought, albeit without consent of the will, against our
Neighbor his estate, person, chastity, goods, or name.

Q. Which is the sum of these six precepts, and duties of charity?

A. Thou shall love thy Neighbor as thy self: or, do to him as thou would
have him do to thee.

Of the spiritual power, and perfection of the Law.
Q: Which are the essential properties of this Law, necessary to be known of
us?

A. Even these whereby it excels all Romans 7. 14. Psalm. 19. 7. Psalm. 119. 96.
laws of earthly Kings; to wit, that it is spiritual, and perfect.

Q. Why call you it Spiritual?

A. Because it reaches to the soul and Heb. 4. 12. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5
all the powers thereof.

Q How so?

A. It charge the Isa. 1. 3. Ier. 4. 22.
understanding to know every duty: it charge the Romans 2. 18. 19. 1 Cor. 10.
15 Heb. 5. 14.
judgment to discern betwixt good and evil, the Exo. 20. 8. Eccl. 12. 1
memory to retain, the Deu 30. 19 Ios. 24. 15. 1 These. 5. 20.
will to choose what is better, and leave what is worse, Psalm. 45. 7.
and the affections to love good, and hate evil.

Q Why call you it perfect.

A. Because it charge not only the soul, Mat. 22. 37. 39.
but the whole soul: not only to know, discern, retain, will, and follow
good, but also to do the same Jam. 2. 10.
perfectly: Phil 4. 8.
and because as it commands all good, so it Romans 7. 7.
condemns all evil.

Q. Yet all the Commandments, except the fourth, and fifth, appears only to
forbid evil?

A. Even these under the evil forbidden expressly, Mat. 5. 28. Job. 31. 1.
forbids not only the occasions thereof, but also Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Ephesians. 4. 25. 28.
1 Pet. 3. 9. 11.
commands the good contrary thereto.

Of Man's inability to fulfill the Law.
Q Is any man able perfectly to keep that so strict and perfect Law?

A. No, Gal. 3. 22. Prou. 24. 16.
not one.

Q. Why so?

A. Because even Romans 7. 23 Gal. 5. 17.
in those that have attained greatest measure of Sanctification, the flesh
fights against the spirit.

Q. How far preuailes it by fighting?

A. So far Romans 7. 19.
that it either hinders the good works we would do, or at least Iam. 4. 3.
stains them with some sinful imperfection.

Of the use of the Law.
Q. Then it appears we cannot be justified, or live by the Law?

A. That is most certain: for the Law is Romans 3. 20. 18. Gal. 3. 10. 11 Act. 13.
39.
sealed up with this threatening; Cursed be every man that abides not in every
thing that is written in the Law, to do it.

Q. Then apparently the Law is able to condemn us?

A. As it cannot justify us, Romans 8. 3.
because we cannot fulfill it, so Romans 8 1.
neither can it condemn us, because we are in Christ, Gal. 4. 4, 5, Mat. 3.
15. Gal. 3. 13.
who for us has fulfilled it.

Q To what use serves the Law then?

A. It serves for two uses: First, it Gal. 3 22, 23 24. Act. 13. 39. Romans 10.
4. Act. 4. 12.
prepares us for the Gospel, urging us to betake us to Christ, and to seek
life in him, where only it is to be found.

Q. How does it that?

A. By humbling us under the sense Gal. 3. 10. 11. Act. 2. 27. 2^.
of sin, and the fear of Gods curse for sin.

Q. What is the second use of the Law?

A. When I have found life in Christ 1 Timothy 1. 9. Tit. 2. 11. 1 (...). 2. 24.
Col. 1. 21. Ephesians 1. 4. ^ Ioh. 3. 3,
by the Gospel, the Law serves to be the rule of my conversation in
thankfulness toward my Lord, for his superaboundant mercies.

Q How can God accept of your works, which you study to frame according to
that rule, they being but imperfectly good?

A. My person and works be acceptable Rom 12. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 5. 1 John 2. 1.
Psalm. 32. 1.
to God in Jesus Christ, by whose perfect obedience the imperfections both of
my Person and works are covered and pardoned.

Q. But when shall we and our works be altogether agreeable unto the Law?

A. When our Sanctification shall be 2 Pet. 3. 13. Reu. 21. 4. 27.
perfected, in the life to come.

Q What must we do in the mean time, while we attain to that blessed estate?

A. We must continually strive to 1 These. 4. ^ 10. Phil. 3. 12. 13 14. 15. 1 Timothy 4. 7.
perfection, by exercising our selves in all manner of good works; especially
in Repentance, and Prayer.

Of Repentance.
Q. What is Repentance?

A. It is our turning from darkness Act. 26. 18. Hos. 14. 2.
to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.

Q. Are we able to turn to God of our selves?

A. No, our conversion is Gods work, Act. 5. 31. Act. 11. 18.
and gift.

Q. Why then do you reckon it amongst our good works?

A. First, the Lord of his grace turns Ier. 31. 18. 19*
us; then, we assisted by the same grace, as working with God, do turn and
repent.

Q. By what means does the Lord work our conversion?

A. By the preaching of the Law, and Luke 24. 47*
Gospel.

Q. Which are the Parts of Repentance?

A. The mortification of the old man, Ephesians. 4. ^2. 2^ 2^.
and the quickening of the new man.

Q. Wherein stands the mortification of the old man?

A. It stands in a godly sorrow for ^ Cor. 7. 10. Romans 6. 6. Iud. 23. Col. 3.
8. 9.
offending God, and in a detesting and flying of sin.

Q. Wherein stands the quickening of the new man?

A. It stands in a joy unspeakable, arising Romans 5. 1: Job 19. 23, 24. 25.
Romans 6. 4.
of the sense of Gods mercy in Christ, and in an ardent study of newness of
life.

Q. By what special mean are we kept in the way of Repentance?

A. By earnest, and continual Prayer. Mat. 26. 41. Iam. 5. 16. Luke 18. 1.


Of Prayer.
Q. What is Prayer?

A. It is a calling Psa. 50. 15
upon God, in the Ioh. 14. 6. 14.
name of Christ, for Psalm. 33. 1. 12.
such things as concern Gods glory, and our necessity.

Q. Why is it not lawful to pray to Creatures, as to Saints glorified, and
Angels?

A. Because God has commanded us Mat. 4. 10. Romans 10. 14.
to worship himself alone.

Q. Why should we pray only in the name of Christ?

A. Because he is our only Mediator 1 Timothy 2. 5. Ioh. 14. 6.
and intercessor, and none comes to the Father but by him.

Q. How should we Pray?

A. According to that perfect pattern of prayer, which our Lord himself taught
Luke 11. 2.
his Disciples: saying, When you pray, say, Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

Q In how many parts do you divide this Prayer?

A. In three parts: In a Preface, six petitions, and a conclusion.

Q Which is the Preface?

A. Our Father which art in heaven.

Q. What are we taught by this Preface?

A. Thereby we are taught to come to God, both with boldness, because he
Heb. 4. 16. Eccle. 4. 17,
is our Father; and reverence, because his Majesty fills the heavens.

Q. What crave we in the first three Petitions?

A. We crave things directly belonging to Gods glory: As namely 1. that his
glory may be advanced, 2. by the coming of the Kingdom of Christ, 3. and by
our ready obedience to our King.

Q. What crave we in the last three Petitions?

A. We crave things belonging to our own necessity 4. both temperall, for
this present life, as bread; and 5. spiritual for the life to come, as
remission of sin already committed: 6. and strength against tentations, that
we may stand fast in time to come.

Q. what contains the conclusion?

A. A reason of our Petitions, taken from the Kingdom, Power, and Glory of
God: and a seal of our desire and assurance to obtain, in the word, Amen.

Q. what imports the word, Amen?

A. It signifies either (So be it) as a note of desire, or (so it is) as a note
of assurance, teaching us to pray both with desire, and confidence to obtain.

Q. How shall we have confidence to obtain our desire?

A. By leaning to the promise of God, Mat. 7. 8. Joh. 14. 13. 14.
certifying us, that whatsoever we ask of him in the name of Christ, it shall
be given unto us.

Q. Having spoken of Faith, and of good works in general, and in particular
of repentance and prayer, now in the end show me what is the fruit of this your
Religion?

A. The fruit and end of this my Religion, 2 These. 1. 11. 12.
is the glory of my God in the everlasting salvation of my soul, through Jesus
Christ my Lord, to whom be glory and praise for ever, Amen.

Instructions for worthy receiving of the Lords Supper.
THe Lord commands his people Israel, (Exo. 12.) to eat the Paschall Lamb
with bitter herbs, and unleavened bread, having their shoes on their feet,
their staves in their hands, and their loins girded up, as ready prepared, to
take iourny out of Egypt to Canan. In the which institution, they were
instructed, to consider the time bypast, their present disposition, and their
resolution for the time to come. In respect of the time bygone, they were to
eat their Lamb with bitter herbs; to put them in remembrance of their bitter
captivity, and servitude in Egypt. In respect of the time present, al they that
did eat were circumcised, and all Leaven was removed; to show that all Gods
sealed people, they must presently depart, not having space nor leisure to
leaven their bread. And as for the time to come, they must be resolved
instantly to leave Egypt, and take theit journey to Canaan.

Now Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, and who would worthily eat
this Passover, must of necessity consider these same things; His bypast life,
his present disposition, and his resolution for the time to come. First, if
thou will run the back, tread of thy life, and remember what thou have bin,
and what thou have done; questionless thou shall find much occasion of bitter
mourning. When thou see thy many and great offenses, what in thought, what in
word, what in deed; what of omission, what of commission; what of ignorance,
what of knowledge: in remembrance of this thy vile servitude, in the Egyptian
darkness of sin, and ignorance, under that spiritual Pharao, prepare to thy
self the bitter herbs of remorse and sorrow; that therewith thou may eat thy
Passover. For the better effectuating hereof, examine the bypast time of thy
life, according to all the commandments, and finding thy sins to be many
and greiuous, and thy God to be very angry with thee, and all the curses of the
Law justly to belong unto thee for them, with grief of heart, and contrition
of Spirit, Pray in this form, or sense.

A Prayer.
O Lord, to fulfill the commandments of thy law is impossible, to sustain the
curse of thy law is intolerable. And I, alas, miserable wretch, have broaken
all thy commandments, yea, and many of them wittingly, and willingly:
therefore as a servant knowing his Masters will, and not doing it, I deserve to
be beaten with many stripes: if one transgression of one commandment deserves
thy fearful curse, O what a burden of wrath have I drawn on my silly soul,
by my infinite transgressions? But what shall I do, Lord? shall I drown my
soul in the deepest gulf of desperation? No good Lord, thy Word is my
comfort; there thou calls them unto thee that are weary and laden, promising
to ease them, to refresh them, to release them. Lift up thy head, O my soul,
and taste of the sweetness of this consolation; the Lord calls on thee,
promises to relieve thee and to refresh thee; for thy Lord sees thee not only
burdened with thy sins, but also weary of thy burden. Thou bids me come, O
Lord; behold here am I ready at thy gracious call: but how shall I come to
thee, except thou draw me? draw me, O Lord, and I shall follow thee: the
burden of my sins, more heavy then a mountain, so bears me down, that I
cannot stir one foot toward thee, till thou put under thy hand and free me
of my loading. And if I might creep to thee-ward under it, how durst I present
my self before thee in my sins? should I not be consumed as stubble before
the fire? Lord I do believe thy own testimony, thou so louedst the world, that
thou gave thy only Son for the world, that whosoever belieueth in him should
not perish, but have eternal life: Lord I believe in him, keep thy promise to
me, let me not perish as I deserve; but give me life, that my poor soul may
live by thee, in thee, and with thee: through Jesus Christ my blessed Lord and
Savior, Amen.

Secondly, we must consider the time present, how we are, and how we eat; we
must take heed both to the disposition of our person, and to the manner of our
eating; all they that did eat the Passover, were circumcised, and did eat
with unleavened bread. So must we be, so must we do; except we be circumcised
in our hearts, we can have no fellowship with Jesus Christ: if any man be in
him, he must be a new Creature, for he that has not the Spirit of Christ, the
same is not his. Ahimelech would not give of the show bread to David his
servants, till he understood that the young man were sanctified; but here is a
more holy bread then that: here is the Bread of Life, which was sent down from
Heaven, to give life unto the World: No man, says our Savior, puts new
wine in old vessels; this is new wine, this is the Lords blood of the new
Covenant. See therefore that the vessel of thy soul be not geisned, for then
it will run out; see it be not foisted, for then it will turn this wholesome
medicine into poison. Thus touching the disposition of thy person. Next, for
the manner of thy eating, thou must eat thy Passover with unleavened bread.
The Israelites did put all leaven out of their houses; thou must search the
corners of thy heart, and cast forth all sorts of leaven. First, cast out the
leaven of the Pharisees, that is, false opinions; next, cast forth the leaven
of malice, that is, foul affections: a little leaven will leaven the whole
mass. One false opinion in the grounds of Religion, as that of
transsubstantiation; one soul affection, as hypocrisy or malice will make all
thy service unprofitable, yea, abominable. Therefore that thou may be holy
both in thy person and carriage, as becomes one that bankets with the Lord at
his Table; put up thy humble suite unto the Lord, in this manner, or sense.

O Lord, thou will be sanctified in all them that approach unto thee, yea,
without sanctification none can see thee: therefore, good Lord, sanctify my
heart, that I may draw near unto thee; sanctify my mind, that I may see
thee; circumcise the foreskin of my heart, remove from me all leaven of
ignorance, of malice, and hypocrisy; that I may eat my Passover, even the
Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world, with the unleavened bread
of truth, of love, and sincerity: that in the strength of that heavenly food,
my soul may grow in faith, in hope, in patience, and all spiritual graces; to
the glory of thy great Name, and the salvation of my poor soul, through Jesus
Christ, my blessed Lord and Savior, Amen.

In the third place, take good heed to thy Resolution, in respect of the time
to come; in regard whereof, thy feet must be shodde with the shoes of the
preparation of the Gospel of peace; the staff of Gods promises must be in
thy hand, to sustain thee in thy journey; and thy loins must be girded up
with the girdle of verity, to make thee expedite for thy journey. Thus thou
must be ready prepared and resolved, to take thy journey out of Egypt, to thy
promised Canaan. Thou must resolve to make no longer stay in Egypt, to serve
Satan that spiritual Pharao there: for it is toomuch, and more then toomuch,
that thou have misspent any part of thy bypast life, in that filthy and
miserable servitude. Now must thou make a covenant with thy eyes, that they
behold no vanity; with thy heart, that it follow not the ways of thy eyes; and
with thy feet, that they neither stand, nor walk in the way of the wicked.
That thou may attain hereto, pray as after follows.

Alas, Lord, I have been a great sinner in times past, and woe is me that I
have so long continued in a sinful course of life, to the great offense of thy
Majesty: Now am I resolved by thy grace to take up a new course, to make no
longer stay in Egypt, to serve sin and Satan no longer, but to go from
strength to strength, till I come to the Land of promise: only Lord, as thou
have given me a heart to resolve, so grant me grace and power to perform;
for it is thou alone that workest both the will and the deed, through the
effectual power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ my Lord, to whom be glory for
ever, Amen.

A Prayer to be said immediately before the Receiving.
MY heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared; my Lamp is dressed and
trimmed, that I may meet my Savior, who is graciously pleased to call me to
the wedding. But alas, neither is the preparation of my heart, nor the
cleernesse of my lamp, nor the measure of my oil answerable to that that thou
requirest, or to that that I desire: Yet thou, O merciful God, that quenchest
not the smoking, flax, and breakest not the bruised reed; for Jesus Christ's
sake, accept, I humbly beseech thee, of these small beginnings of grace, as of
the first fruits of thy own Spirit: and when it shall please thy goodness to
enlarge my heart, and to bestow upon me a larger measure of grace, I vow to
offer up unto thee a fatter Sacrifice. In the mean time according to thy
gracious promise, accept of the will for the deed, and let me be acceptable,
not for that that I have not, but for that that I have. I presently sacrifice
my soul, my body, my affections, my words and actions, my goods and all to
thee, promising and vowing henceforth to bestow my self and all that I have on
thee and thy glory, because thou have bestowed thy only and well beloved Son
on me and my salvation. Only Lord, as thou have given me a heart to promise,
so give me also help for to perform, for Jesus Christ thy Sons sake. Amen.

Thanksgiving, and Prayer after the Communion.
WHat shall I render unto thee, O Lord, for all thy benefits toward me? for
giving thy Son to die for me? for covering my shameful nakedness with his
glorious righteousness; for healing my wounded soul with his stripes; for
giving his flesh to me for meat, for giving his blood to me for drink? What
can I render, O Lord, for thy unspeakable love toward me? If Nathans poor man
loved his sheep well, that he fed with his own bread and water. (2 Samuel 12.
3.) O what a love has my good shepherd borne to me his silly lost sheep,
which he feeds with his own flesh and blood? What then shall I render, O
Lord? surely I shall love thee, who have loved me, and washed me from my
sins in the blood of thy Son; surely I shall praise thy goodness so long
as I live; surely I shall henceforth live to thee, who have given thy Son to
die for me. Here I renounce my self, my own wit, my own will, my own
affections. Here I consecrate and sacrifice my self, and all that is in me or
belongs unto me, to thee my God, and to the glory of thy Name. O Lord, in token
of thy acceptance of my offering, kindle thou it with a coal from thy Altar,
that it may smell sweetly in thy presence. Lord suffer not my soul again to
go a whooring from thee, after any thing beside thee: let me fear none but
thee; love none but thee; delight in none beside thee. Be thou always at my
right hand, that I fall not, and that I may rise when I fall. As I have
received Christ Jesus my Lord this day, so make me walk in him from
henceforth even for ever. Lord make me always feel the powerful effects of
his presence: I know my Lord is not idle in the heart where he dwells. If the
bones of a dead Prophet could revive a dead carkase, (2 King. 13. 21.) shall
not the lively Spirit of Jesus, quicken the heart wherein he remains? O Lord
thou blessedst the house of Obed-Edom, because of the presence of thy Arc; (2 Samuel 6. 11.) much more then shall thou bless my soul, because of the presence
of thy Son. The poor Woman with the bloody issue was cured, not by touching
the hem of his Garment; but because she touched him by faith, therefore she
drew Virtue out of him, and was made whole: ( Mar. 5. 28.) Lord Jesus my
blessed Savior, it is not the participation of these earthy elements, which
are but as it were the hem of thy Garment, that will stanch the bloody issue of
sin in my soul; if my soul has touched thee by faith, it has drawn
virtue out of thee. Let me know, Lord, by thy Virtue curing the bloody issue
of my soul, that by Faith I have touched thee. My Lord, thou art the Bread of
Life, let me feel thee living in my soul, that thereby I may know that I have
truly eaten of that bread: Lord let me feel the power of that Spirit of life,
which is in thee, quickening my soul to eternal life, and mortifying sin in
my soul. As thou, O Lord, this day have renewed thy Covenant with me, so here
I vow unto thee amendment and newness of life: Only, Lord, as by a holy
resolution, thou have entered me this day in a good course, so give me grace to
persevere therein unto the end, that I return not as a dog to my vomit; or,
as a sow that is washed, to wallow in the mire of my filthiness. O Lord, make
me at all times hereafter to bemoue, to distaste, and abhor my former
iniquities; knowing that the unclean spirit, if ever he can get into my soul
again, after that it is swept and garnished, he will enter with seven other
devils worse then himself; and my end shall be worse then my beginning. Only
thou, O Lord, the stronger man, who have disarmed that strong armed man, and
thrust him out of his possession, thou only can hold him out, and keep my
soul, thy darling, to thy self. Thou therefore, my sweet Savior, who art the
Author and finisher of my faith, who give not only to will, but also to
perform; accomplish thy good work in me, which thou of thy goodness have
begun, to the glory of thy blessed name, and the salvation of my poor soul,
Amen.

Morning Prayer for a Family.
OH Lord our God, let our Prayers ascend into thy presence like sweet incense,
and in the name of Christ let this our morning sacrifice of thanksgiving, be
acceptable unto thee. Great cause have we to praise thee, O God; for thy
mercies toward us in number pass our reckoning, and in greatness surmount
our estunation; and we poor Creatures are less then the least of them. We
bless thy holy Name, for making us to thy Image, when we were noght, for
redeeming us with the precious blood of thy beloved Son, when we were worse
then naught; for revealing unto us that great redemption in thy blessed
Gospel, and for making us partakers of the salvation of the Gospel by thy
holy Spirit, We yield thee hearty thanks also for all thy temporal benefits,
for giving unto us food, raiment, health, and peace. O Lord, the current of
thy compassions does never fail toward us, but thy mercies are renewed every
morning; whereas this last night, thou might have suddenly surprised us by
death, and brought us to judgment, because of our manifold offenses against
thy holy Majesty: thou have not only mercifully spared us, but have also given
us quiet rest, and brought us to the light of this day. O Lord, thou art a
gracious God, slow to anger, and rich in mercy; and the more blessings thou
bestowest upon us, the more bent are we to beg for further: therefore as thou
have raised our bodies from sleep, so be thou graciously pleased, to raise our
souls from sin and security; and as thou have made the light of the day to
shine on our bodily eyes, so let the light of thy Word and Spirit illuminate
the eyes of our understanding, that we as the children of Light, may walk in
all thy holy commandments this day. O Lord let thy gracious presence accompany
us, that we this day may keep faith and a good conscience toward thee, and
toward all men, in all our thoughts, our words, and deeds. O Lord, bless us;
bless all our purposes and actions, which we shall take in hand, that they
may tend to thy glory, to the good of others, and to the comfort of our own
souls, in that day when we shall make our final accounts unto thee for them.
O Lord, thou know how many snares Satan lays for us to entrap us, when we
resolve to walk in thy ways: Therefore, O God, be thou not far from us:
let thy favor compass us as a shield; give thy Angels charge over us, to
guide us in all our ways, that we may be saved from the malice and cruelty of
that evil one. Into thy hand, O Lord, we do commend our souls, our bodies,
our affairs, and all that we have, to be guided by thy grace, and guarded by
thy power. Lord, thou art a faithful Creator, and wilt suffer nothing to take
harm that is committed into thy tuition and custody. Therefore our very souls
do rest and repose in the assurance of thy merciful protection. Good Lord,
mortify the old man more and more in us; give and increase in us, faith, hope,
love, humility, patience, meekness, chastity and all other Christian virtues.
Turn our hearts from the love of earthly things, and set them on things that
are above, where Christ is at thy right hand. Furnish unto us solid comfort in
all our tribulations, and in thy strength at last let us be victorious over all
tentations whatsoever: make us spend this life in purity, and end it in peace,
that we in the last day may rise in joy to life everlasting, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.

Gracious God be merciful to thy whole Church and chosen Children, wheresoever
they be upon the face of the earth: defend them from the rage and tyranny of
the Devil, the world, and Antichrist: Give thy Gospel free passage through
the World, for the gathering of thy Saints, and the conversion of al those that
belong to thy Election and Kingdom: Bless the Churches and Kingdoms wherein
we live, with continuance of Justice, Peace, and true Religion. Defend the
Kings M. from all his enemies; grant him a long life, in health, and happiness
to reign over us. Bless the hopeful Prince Charles, Prince Palatine of the
Rhene, the virtuous Lady Elizabeth, his wife, and their Progeny. Grant that
all Magistrates and Subjects, husbands and wives, fathers and children, masters
and servants, may faithfully do their duty, and thy will. Lord continue the
light of thy glorious Gospel, with us and our posterity: increase the number
of the faithful Preachers of thy Word; and open thou the hearts of their
hearers, that they may believe and obey the same unto salvation. Lord we
commend unto thee all our kinsmen and acquaintance, all our friends and
benefactors: recompense abundantly unto them all the good they have done. Let
our ways please thee, O Lord, that all our enemies may be at peace with us.
Comfort the comfortless, be near all them that call upon thy Name. Hasten
thy coming, our blessed Savior, and make us ready with the oil of grace and
faith in our lamps to meet thee our sweet Bridegroom at thy coming. These
and all other things thou know to be needful, we beg at thy hands for our
selves, and all thy Saints on earth, in the name of thy beloved Son, our
blessed Savior Jesus Christ, according to that most perfect form of prayer,
which he has taught us: Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

Evening Prayer for a Family.
O Lord God, who art infinite both in might and mercy, in greatness and
goodness: we thank thee from the very bottom of our hearts, for mightily and
mercifully protecting us from our mothers womb, to this present hour: And we
beseech thee, howsoever this day we have sinned against thee, by the deceit of
the flesh, the evil example of the world, or the sleight of Satan; in thought,
word, or deed; in omitting of good, or committing of evil; of ignorance, or
knowledge; let it please thy Majesty graciously to forgive us, in the blood of
Jesus Christ. Good Lord, let not our iniquities separate betwixt us and thy
favor, or spoil us of thy fatherly protection: But under the couerture of the
wings of thy merciful safeguard, let us rest this night free from all dangers
of body and soul; that to morrow we may rise in safety to praise thy name, and
may serve thee with ready minds, with pure hearts, and chaste bodies, in true
joy and hearty thanksgiving: through Jesus Christ our Lord: in whose name we
humbly beg these, and all other blessings thou know to be expedient for us,
and all thy chosen children on the earth, in that perfect form of Prayer,
which he has taught us: Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

FINIS.
