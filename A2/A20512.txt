An excellent new Ditty: OR, Which proves that women the best Warriers be, For
they made the Devil from earth for to flee.
To the tune of, Deaths Dance.


OLd Beelzebub merry
disposed to be,
To earth he did hurry,
some pastime to see;
A Landlord he proved,
and ^eases would let.
To all them that loved
a long life to get.
Come hither all mortals,
(quoth the Devil of Hell)
Come long tails and curtailes,
now unto my Cell,
To you I here proffer,
a bargain to buy;
If you will take my offer,
you never shall dye.
This bargain them pleased,
they longed it to gain,
The sick and diseased,
came thither amain,
And though they were crasie,
they hither could fly,
The sluggard and lazy,
this bargain would buy.
The Gallants and Gentry,
his love to embrace,
From City and Country,
flockt hither apace,
Long life they desired,
with much iollity,
Their hearts they were fired,
this bargain to buy.
The Dames of the City,
came hither with speed,
Your Merchant wives pretty,
would seal to this deed,
To live with a Lover,
and never to dye,
Here Curtesans houer,
this bargain to buy.
No females there wanted,
But hither they came,
They came till they panted,
to purchase the same,
Wives, Widows, and Maidens,
to the Devil did hye,
Brave Lasses and Ladies,
this bargain would buy.
The Lecher which viewed,
such pretty ones there,
His love was renewed,
and he would have a share,
And here he soiourned,
cause never he would dye,
His heart it was burned,
this bargain to buy.
Now wicked sons roaring,
that had their means spent,
In Dicing and Whoring,
to this office went,
Apace they here gather,
because they would not dye,
But to outliue their father,
this bargain they would buy.
The second part. To the same Tune.


N^xt comes the Shoemaker,
to crave a long life,
Here to be partaker,
he brought his fine wife;
The Tailors attends here,
for money they cry,
And follow the spender,
this bargain to buy.
The Usurers follow,
that pawnes have in hand,
With whoop and with hollow,
they call for the Land,
Which spend-thrifts pawn to them
while for cash they hye,
To live to undo them,
this bargain they will buy.
Next came these rich Farmers,
that coozin the poor,
And hoord up in corners,
provision and store,
To live till a dear year,
and never to dye:
These greedy cornmizers,
this bargain would buy.
Now Brokers came hither,
that in their hands had,
Pawnes heaped together,
both good ones and bad,
To live till they view them
all forfeited lie,
To the Devil they sue then,
this bargain to buy.
This purchase contented
the Devil of Hell,
To see such flocks enter
all into his Cell,
Yet still he proclaimed,
they never should dye,
Who ere it was aimed,
this bargain to buy.
Next came the poor women,
that cry fish and Oysters,
They flock here in common,
and many great clusters,
They ran hither scolding,
and to the Devil cry,
Sir we would be beholding,
this bargain to buy.
But when these came hither,
they kept such a noise,
Each brabled with other,
which first should have choice,
As that their noise frighted
the Devil of Hell,
No more he delighted,
such bargains to sell.
Quoth he, I must from them,
for should I stay here,
In pieces among them,
my body they will tear;
(Quoth he) I am willing
to deal among men,
But nere will have dealing,
amongst women again.
FINIS.
