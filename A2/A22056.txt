By the King.
A Proclamation giving a further time for the amendment of defective Titles.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, continuing still his Royal intention, to
extend his grace to such of his loving Subjects as shall seek the same, for
confirmation of such Graunts, as have been passed to any of them, or their
Ancestors from the Crown, by which his Princely favor, they and their
posterity may be secured from the manifold dangers in which they stand, if by
variety of time his Majesty's Title to their possessions should be set on foot,
and pressed to their overthrow in succeeding ages: And having for that purpose
lately published his Proclamation touching defective Titles, with a limitation
of a day prefixed, which is now upon the point to be expired, Does well
perceive by report of great numbers that do crave the benefit thereof (which
cannot conveniently be dispatched) that it was not any general neglect of his
Majesty's grace and favor, that caused this late coming, but merely the
accident of time in most men, whereof the greatest part passed on in the long
Vacation, during which space, the Commissioners did not sit, nor the Counsel
learned remained in Town, and the chiefest time, whereupon most men did rest
their expectation (which was after Michaelmas) was likewise by the
doubtfulnesse and shortness of the Term much disappointed: His Majesty is
therefore pleased, for these and such like considerations, (by the advice of
his Privy Counsel) to give once more, a prolongation of the same until the
sixth of February next ensuing, to the intent that all such as have any desire
to receive this grace, may enjoy the benefit of Confirmation of his Majesty's
Grants of that nature by this Parliament, which is so immediately to follow, as
that opportunity would not be neglected, which happens not but upon other
extraordinary and urgent occasions.

Given at Newmarket the last day of November, in the seventh year of our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.

ANNO 1609.
