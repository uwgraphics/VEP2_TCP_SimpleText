To the PARLIAMENT of the COMMONWEALTH of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
assembled at Westminster.
The humble Petition of Humphrey Bagaley
Shows,

THat your Petitioner, having bin by a party of Horse taken out of Bed the 21th
of May last, and delivered to a Company of Foot at St. James; and from thence
carried to the Tower, where he was cast into a Prison-lodging commonly called
Nunns Bower, or The Hole, until he had submitted to pay an arbitrary Fine, has
ever since continued a Prisoner, though not at al brought before any Officer
Millitary or Civil to be examined. Al which, as he really beleives it to be
unknown to this honorable House; so is he not ignorant, that it is against
Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, and the sixth Article of the present
Government. And therefore being conscious to himself, that he has not in any
manner transgrest against any Law of the Land or the present Government,

Humbly prays,

He may be referred to a speedy legal trial, which is it he above all things
desires, to the end his innocence may be manifested to the World. Or otherwise
to release him with such consideration for the heavy charge and exspence be
has thereby bin exposed to, as unto Equity and Justice does appertein. And, as
in duty bound,

Your Petitioner shall pray, etc.
