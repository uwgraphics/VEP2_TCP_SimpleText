A Proclamation for better furnishing the Navy, and Shipping of the Realm,
with able and skillful Mariners.
WHereas the most Excellent, High and Mighty Prince, King James, of most noble
and blessed memory, Our most dear and royal Father, out of his princely and
provident care of the safety and honor of His Kingdoms and people, and for
the continuance and maintaining of the Navigations of this Realm, and to the
intent that skillful Mariners, and Seafaring men might be always in
readiness, to furnish, as well His own Royal Navy, as the shipping of His
loving subjects, did by Proclamation, dated the sixth day of August, in the
twentieth year of His Reign, straightly inhibite and forbid, That no Mariner,
or Sea faring man, Ship-wright, or Ship-carpenter whatsoever, being His
subject, should, without express license of Himself, or His Admiral of
England, enter or attempt, or go about to enter into the service of any
foreign Prince, or State, or be employed out of this Realm, in any service
whatsoever, unless it were in the service of the said late King, Our most
dear Father, or of some of His liege subjects: And did afterward by a later
Proclamation, dated the seven and twentieth day of February then following,
further straightly charge and command. That no Mariner, or Sea faring man should
absent, hide, or withdraw himself from His late Majesty's service or prests,
and that all such persons having prest-money given, or tendered unto them,
should duetifully, and reverently receive the same, and repair aboard the
ships appointed, and continue in that service, as to the duty of good subjects
appertained, and not withdraw themselves, or depart therefrom, without
special license: And did lately by another Proclamation, bearing date the
twentieth day of this instant month of March, likewise straightly inhibite and
forbid. That no Owner or Master of any ship or vessel, nor any other, setting
forth any vessels of Trade, fishing, or otherwise, should hire, or entertain
any Mariner, or Seafaring man, knowing him to have offended against either of
the said Proclamations: and if such Owner, or other person not knowing of the
said offenses, should hire or entertain any such offender or offenders, did
will and command, That forthwith, upon notice of any the said offenses, they
should deliver such offenders over unto the next Justice of Peace, Mayor,
Bailiffe, Constable, or other Officer, to be imprisoned, until the said
offenders should give sufficient bond and caution, for their foorth-comming and
appearance, in such Court, or place of Justice, unto which it might appertain,
to have them proceeded against and punished, according to their demerits, and
withal, that the said Masters, Owners, and other persons, should forbear to
pay to the said offenders any wages.

And did further thereby straightly charge and command all Lieutenants,
Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Majors, Bayliffes, Constables,
Customers, Comptrollers, searchers, and officers, as well of the Admiralty, as
of the Ports, and also all and every person and persons, to whom any
Commission, Deputation, or Letters of Assistance should be directed, for the
presting of Mariners, and Seafaring men for public service, that they should
from time to time use all possible diligence, and endeavor, to apprehend, and
cause to be apprehended, as well all such Mariners and Seafaring men,
offending, as aforesaid, as also all such Owners, Masters, and others, as
should entertain or hire them, or pay them any wages, or otherwise help them
to escape the hands of Justice; and such as they should apprehend, they should,
with Certificate of their names and offenses, bind over to appear before the
Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy, in London, to be by them committed, and
delivered over to the ordinary course of Justice, either in the Court of
Star Chamber, or of the Admiralty, or otherwise, as the quality of the
offense should require, with special charge and commandment to all Pressed
masters, and their Assistants, that they should publish the names of all such,
as should be prested by them in the Ports where they should be taken, as also
deliver a note of their names to the officers of the Ports, and others who were
fittest to discover them, if they should fail in the performance of their
duties, As in and by the said several Proclamations more at large appears.

Now we, having taken the premises into Our Princely consideration, and
advised seriously thereof with Our Privy Council, finding how necessary it is,
both for the safety and honor of this Our Kingdom and State, That all the
several Proclamations before mentioned should be put in due execution, for
preventing and suppressing the manifold abuses, contempts, and neglects
heretofore committed in services of so weighty consequence* Do hereby straightly
charge and command, that all the said Proclamations, and every branch and
article therein contained, be continued at all times hereafter, and be from
time to time hereafter carefully observed, and put in exact execution, as
fully, and effectually, as the same should, or might have been in the life time
of Our said dear Father, upon the pains and penalties specified in the said
Proclamations, and such further punishments, as by Our Laws or Prerogative
Royal may be inflicted upon the offenders:

Letting all Our loving Subjects hereby know, That, as Our said most dear and
Royal Father, in the publishing of the last of the said Proclamations, had a
gracious eye unto the special service then intended, and to be now shortly
performed; So we rest assured, that none of Our said Subjects in the
advancement thereof (so much concerning the safety of Our Kingdoms and Our
Imperial Crown and Dignity) will be wanting to do their uttermost in making Us
such a supply, as may give testimony of their extraordinary care, faithfulness,
and dutiful affection toward Us, who had much rather have cause to express
Our gracious acceptance thereof at their hands, then be enforced to any other
course, which the necessity and importance of Our service will otherwise
require.

Given at Our Court at Saint James, the one and thirtieth day of March, in the
first year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the
King.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and John Bill, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty.
