By the King.
A Proclamation for the better direction of those who desire to repair to the
Court, for the Cure of their disease, called, The Kings Evil.
WHereas by the grace and blessing of God, the Kings and Queens of this Realm
by many ages past, have had the happiness by their sacred Touch, and
invocation of the Name of God, to cure those who are afflicted with the disease
called, The Kings Evil: And his now most Excellent Majesty, in no less
measure then any of his Royal Predecessors, has had good success herein, and
in His most gracious and pious disposition, is as ready and willing as any King
or Queen of this Realm ever was, in any thing to relieve the distresses and
necessity of his good Subjects, yet in his Princely wisdom foreseeing, that
in this (as in all other things) order is to be observed, and fit times are
necessarily to be appointed, for performing of this great work of charity: His
most Excellent Majesty does hereby publish and declare his Royal will and
pleasure to be, as formerly his Majesty did by the like Proclamation published
in April last; That whereas heretofore the usual times of presenting such
persons to his Majesty for this purpose, were Easter and Whitsuntide, That
from henceforth the times shall be Easter and Michaelmas, as times more
conuement, both for the temperature of the season, and in respect of any
contagion which may happen in this near access to his Majesty's Sacred
person; And his Majesty does accordingly will and command, that from the time
of publishing this Proclamation, none presume to repair to his Majesty's
Royal Court to be healed of that disease, before the Feast of S. Michael now
next coming, The danger being now visible to have any concourse of people in
this Spring or Summer time to have resort to this City of London, the place of
His usual access, or to his Court or Royal Person.

And his Majesty does further will and command, that all such as hereafter
shall come or repair to the Court for this purpose, shall bring with them
Certificates under the hands of the Parson, Vicar, or Minister, and
Churchwardens of those several Parishes where they dwell, and from whence they
come, testifying according to the truth, that they have not any time before
been touched by the King, to the intent to be healed of that disease.

And his Majesty does straightly charge all Justices of the Peace, Constables,
and other Officers, That they do not suffer any to pass, but such as have
such Certificates, upon pain of his Majesty's displeasure.

And, to the end that all his loving Subjects may the better take knowledge of
this his Majesty's pleasure and command, his will is, That this Proclamation be
published and affixed in some open lace in every market Town of this Realm;
All which his Majesty having by former Proclamations, upon the like occasion
published and commanded, He does now again command strictly to be observed, by
all and every person and persons whom is shall or may concern, upon such
pains and penalties as may be inflicted upon them for the neglect thereof.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the five and twentieth day of March, in the
sixth year of Our Reign.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. M.DC.XXXI.
