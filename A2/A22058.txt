By the King.
THis later age and times of the world wherein we are fallen, is so much given
to verbal profession, as well of Religion, as of all commendable Moral
virtues, but wanting the actions and deeds agreeable to so specious a
profession, as it has bred such an insatiable curiosity in many men's spirits,
and such an itching in the tongues and pens of most men, as nothing is left
unsearched to the bottom, both in talking and writing. For from the very
highest mysteries in the Godhead, and the most inscrutable Councels in the
Trinity, to the very lowest pit of Hell, and the confused actions of the
devils there, there is nothing now unsearched into by the curiosity of men's
brains; Men not being contented with the knowledge of so much of the Will of
God, as it has pleased him to reveal; but they will needs sit with him in his
most privy Closet, and become privy of his most inscrutable Councels: And
therefore it is no wonder, that men in these our days do not spare to wade in
all the deepest mysteries that belong to the persons or State of Kings or
Princes, that are gods upon Earth: since we see, (as we have already said) that
they spare not God himself. And this license that every talker or writer now
assumeth to himself, is come to this abuse, that many Phormio's will give
council to Hanibal, and many men that never went out of the compass of
Cloisters or Colleges, will freely wade by their writings in the deepest
mysteries of Monarchy and politic government: Whereupon it cannot otherwise
fall out, but that when men go out of their element, and meddle with things
above their capacity; themselves shall not only go astray, and stumble in
darkness, but will mislead also diverse others with themselves into many
mistakings and errors; The proof whereof we have lately had by a Book
written by Doctor Cowell, called THE INTERPRETER: For he being only a
Ciuilian by profession, and upon that large ground of a kind of Dictionary (as
it were) following the Alphabet, having all kind of purposes belonging to
Government and Monarchy in his way, by meddling in matters above his reach, he
has fallen in many things to mistake and deceive himself: In some things
disputing so nicely upon the Mysteries of this our Monarchy, that it may
receive doubtful interpretations: yea in some points very derogatory to the
supreme power of this Crown: In other cases mistaking the true state of the
Parliament of this Kingdom, and the fundamental Constitutions and privileges
thereof: And in some other points speaking irreverently of the Common Law of
England, and of the works of some of the most famous and ancient Judges
therein; it being a thing utterly unlawful to any Subject, to speak or write
against that law under which he lives, and which we are sworn and are
resolved to maintain. Wherefore, upon just considerations moving us hereunto,
for preventing of the said errors and inconveniences in all times to come, We
do hereby not only prohibit the buying-vttering or reading of the said
Books, but do also will and straightly command all and singular persons
whatsoever, who have or shall have any of them in their hands or custody, That
upon pain of our high displeasure, and the consequence thereof, they do
deliver the same presently upon this publication, to the Lord Mayor of London,
if they or any of them be dwelling in or near the said City, or otherwise to
the Sheriff of the County where they or any of them shall reside, and in the
two Universities to the Chancellor or Vicechancellor there, to the intent that
further order may be given for the utter suppressing thereof. And because there
shall be better oversight of Books of all sorts before they come to the Press,
we have resolved to make choice of Commissioners that shall look more narrowly
into the nature of all those things that shall be put to the Press, either
concerning our Authority Royal, or concerning our government or the Laws of
our Kingdom, from whom a more strict account shall be yielded unto us, then has
been used heretofore.

Given at our Palace of Westminster, the 25. day of March, in the eight year
of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno DOM. 1610.
