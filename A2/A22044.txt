By the King.
A Proclamation for the apprehending of the L. Maxwell.
WHereas the Lord Maxwell, a Noble man of our Realm of Scotland, being our
prisoner in our Castle of Edinburgh, for great disorders there committed, has
broken prison, which by the Laws of that our Realm is Treason, And in his
breach has done violence to the Porter of the Castle, having sore wounded him,
And likewise attempted to have delivered Sir James Mac Donnell, a person
guilty of many heinous offenses, prisoner in the same place: After which
escape he is now (as we are informed) fled into this our Realm of England, and
lies lurking in and about our City of London: Having had heretofore good
proof of our peoples love and devotion toward us, in their readiness to
discover and apprehend any persons guilty of Treasons against Us and our
Estate, We have thought it fit to publish unto them the escape of the said
Lord Maxwell, and the cause thereof; And to require and charge all Lieutenants,
Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes,
Constables, Headboroughes, and all other our Officers, Ministers and loving
Subjects, to do their best endeavor to discover and apprehend the said Lord
Maxwell, and to deliver him, if he shall light into their hands, to some of our
Officers, and to give knowledge thereof to Us or our Privy Council.

And to the end they may the better find and discover him, they shall know him
by these signs, He is about the age of three and twenty years, tall and
slender, of a whitish complexion, his face full of pockhooles, his nose short
and low in the midst, a little hair on his chinne of a white color, the
hair of his head somewhat darker, and his legs are very long and small.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the nineteenth day of December, in the
fifth yeereof our Reign of great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
