Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables. Churchwardens
and Headboroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsouer

come, greeting:
WHEREAS we are credibly given to understand, by a Certificate under the
hands of our right trusty and well-beloved Cosen Robert Earl of Warwick, and
William Lord Peter, William Towse Sergeant at Law, Robert Millan Doctor of
Divinity, William Ayloffe, Robert Sandford, Thomas Fanshaw, and William Beriffe
Esquiors, Justices of the Peace within our County of Essex, That our poor
distressed Subject Henry Kent of Copford in our foresaid County Inholder, has
always been a man of honest life and conversation very painful and
industrious to hue, and ready and willing upon all occasions according to his
ability to contribute to wards the relief of others necessities, but he is now
fallen into great want and poverty, by reason of a sudden and lamentable Fire
happening on the Tenth day of May last past, which consumed and burnt a great
Malting-house of his, being the principal means and only stay of his living,
with all the houses, vtensils and implements thereunto belonging, together also
with a great quantity of Malte and Barley mounting in the whole loss to the
value of Two hundred pounds and upwards, To the utter undoing of our said poor
Subject who before this untimely accident lived well and gave relief unto
others, but has little or small means now left to help himself being much
behind hand and indebted, whereby great misery is like to fall upon him, his
poor Wife and Children, unless some charitable course be forthwith taken for
their relief herein, whose poor estate we have thought good upon the humble
suit of our foresaid Lords and Justices made unto us on their behalfes, to
commend the same unto the charitable consideration of all our loving and well
disposed Subjects within certain Counties hereafter mentioned, not doubting
but that all good Christians well weighing the uncertainty of man's estate
through these inevitable accidents, will be ready and willing as feeling
members one of another misery to extend their liberal Contributions toward
the relief and comfort of their distressed brother in this his great
necessity, none knowing how soon nor whose chance may next happen into the
like Calamity.

KNOW ye therefore, that of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant,
unto our said poor Subject Henry Kent, and to his Deputy and Deputies, the
bearer or bearers hereof, full power, license, and Authority, to ask, gather,
receive and take the Alms, and charitable benevolence of all our loving
Subjects whatsoever, Inhabiting within our Counties of Middlesex, Kent, Essex,
Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk, with our Cities of Canterbuty, Rochester,
and the Cinque Ports, with our City of Norwich, our University of Cambridge
and Isle of Ely, And in all Towns Corporate, Privileged places, Parishes*
Villages, and in all other places whatsoever within our said Counties and not
else where, for and toward the recovery of his said losses, and the relief
and maintenance of himself his poor Wife and Children.

WHEREFORE We will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times as the said Henry Kent, or his Deputy or Deputies, the bearer or bearers
hereof, shall come and repair to any your Churches, Chapels, or other places,
to ask, and receive, the gratuities and charitable benevolence of our said
Subjects, quietly to permit, and suffer them so to do, without any manner your
lets, or contradictions. And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curates, for the
better stirring up of a Charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and
declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents, unto our said Subjects, upon
some Sabbath day, when as the same shall be tendered unto you, Exhorting and
persuading them to extend their liberal contributions in so good and
charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of every Parish, where such
Collection is to be made (as aforesaid) to Collect and gather the Alms and
charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects, as well Strangers as others,
and what shall be by you so gathered to deliver it to the bearer or bearers of
these our Letters Patents and to no other person* when as thereunto you shall
be required. And lastly, whereas we are informed of the great abuse which is
now crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Licenses unto some
other person, whereby men's charity goes not the right way but unto such as
deserve it least: That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that if it may
appear unto you or any of you, that the said Henry Kent have contracted any
bargain, or made, or shall make sale of these our Letters Patents, whereby the
benefit should pass from him to any other person, That thereupon these our
Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect, And Statute, Law, Ordinance,
or Provision heretofore made to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next offer the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster, the Twelth day of December, in the Eighteenth
year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of Scotland the Four
and Fiftieth. 1620. Steward
