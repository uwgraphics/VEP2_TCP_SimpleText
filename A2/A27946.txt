Twenty.

Fitted to the Tunes used in Churches.

Cor. I.XV. And I will sing with the Understanding also. LONDON: Printed for
the Company of Stationers. MDCXCV.

A New Version of the PSALMS, etc.
PSALM I.
1. HAppy the Man whom ill advice
From Virtue never withdrew;
Who never with Sinners stood, nor sat
Amongst the scoffing Crew:
2. But always makes the Law of God
His business and delight;
Devoutly reads therein by day,
And meditates by night.
3. He, like a Tree by Rivers fed,
With timely Fruit shall bend;
His Leaf shall flourish, and Success
All his Designs attend.
4. Ungodly Men, and their attempts,
No lasting Root shall find;
Untimely blasted, and dispersed
Like Chaff before the wind.
5. The Wicked therefore shall not stand
Before their Judges face;
Nor Hypocrites, who past for Saints,
Amongst the Just have place.
6. God knows the ways of righteous Men,
To happiness they tend;
But Sinners, and their vain designs,
Shall both in ruin end.
PSALM II.
1. WIth restless and ungoverned Rage,
Why do the Heathen storm?
Why in such fond attempts engage,
As they can never perform?
2. The Great in Council and in Might,
Their various Forces bring;
Against the Lord they all unite,
And his anointed King.
3. Must we submit to their commands?
Blinded with pride they say;
No, let us break their slavish bands,
And cast their chains away.
4. But God, who sits enthroned on high,
Whose Wisdom all things guides,
Does their conspiring strength defy,
Their empty plots derides.
5. Thick clouds of wrath Divine shall break
On his Rebellious Foes;
And in loud Thunder thus he will speak
To all that dare oppose.
6. "In spite of those who thwart my Will,
"The King that I approve,
"Whose Throne is fixed on Sion's hill,
"Like that, shall never move.
7. "Listen, O Earth, whilst I declare
"My firm unchanged Decree;
"Thou art my Son, this day my Heir
"Have Ibegotten thee.
8. "Ask, and receive; thy just Commands
"The Heathen World shall sway,
"The utmost Limits of the Lands
"Shall thy dread Will obey.
9. "Thy powerful Scepter thou shall shake,
"And crush them every where;
"As massy bars of Iron break
"The Potters brittle ware.
10. Learn then, ye Princes, and give ear
Ye Judges of the Earth;
11. Worship the Lord with holy Fear,
Rejoice with awful mirth.
12. Appease the Son with due respect,
Your humble homage pay;
Lest he revenge the cold neglect,
Incensed by your delay:
13. If but in part his anger rise,
Who can endure its flame?
Then blessed are they, whose hope relies
On his most holy Name.
PSALM III.
1. LOrd, how of late are multiplied
The Troublers of my Peace!
And as their Factious number grows,
So does their Rage increase.
2. Insulting they my Soul upbraid,
And him that I adore;
The God in whom he trusts, say they,
Shall rescue him no more.
3. But thou, O Lord, art my Defense;
On thee my hopes rely;
Thou art my Glory, and shall yet
Lift up my head on high.
4. Since, whensoe're in like distress
To God I made my prayer,
He heard me from his holy Hill,
Why should I now despair?
5. Guarded by him, I laid me down
My sweet repose to take;
For I through him securely sleep,
Through him in safety wake.
6. No force, nor fury of my foes,
My courage shall confound;
Were they as many Hosts, as Men,
That have beset me round.
7. Arise, and save me, O my God,
Who often have owned my Cause,
And scattered often these foes to me
And to thy righteous Laws.
8. Salvation to the Lord belongs;
He only can defend;
His Blessing he extends to all
That on his power depend.
PSALM IV.
1. OLord, that art my righteous Judge,
To my complaint give ear;
Thou that still free'st me from distress,
Have mercy, Lord, and hear.
2. How long will ye, O Sons of Men,
To blot my fame devise?
How long your vain designs pursue,
And spread malicious lies?
3. Consider, that the righteous Man
Is Gods peculiar choice,
And when to him I make my prayer,
He always hears my voice.
4. Then stand in awe of his commands,
Flee every thing that is ill;
Commune in private with your hearts,
And bend them to his will.
5. The place of other Sacrifice
Let Righteousness supply;
And let your hope securely fixed,
On God alone rely.
6. Whilst worldly Minds impatient grow
More prosperous Times to see,
Still let the glories of thy Face
Shine brightly, Lord, on me.
7. So shall my heart overflow with joy
More lasting and more true,
Than theirs, who stores of Corn and Wine
Successively renew.
8. Then down in peace I Will lay my head,
And take my needful rest;
No other guard, O Lord, I crave,
Of thy Defense possessed.
PSALM V.
1. LOrd, hear the voice of my complaint,
Accept my secret prayer;
2. To thee alone, my King, my God,
Will I for help repair.
3. Thou in the morn my voice shall hear;
And with the dawning day,
To thee devoutly I Will look up,
To thee devoutly pray.
4. For thou the wrongs that I sustain
Can never, Lord, approve,
Who from thy sacred Dewlling Place
All evil do remove.
5. Not long shall hardn'd fools remain
Unpunished in thy sight.
All such as act unrighteous things
Thy vengeance shall requite.
6. The sland'ring Tongue, O God of Truth,
By thee shall be destroyed,
Who hat'st alike the man in blood
And in deceit employed.
7. But when thy boundless Grace shall me
To thy loved Courts restore,
On thee I Will fix my longing eyes,
And humbly there adore.
8. Conduct me in thy righteous Paths,
For watchful is my foe:
Therefore, O Lord, make plain the way
Wherein I ought to go.
9. Their mouth vents nothing but deceit,
Their heart is set on wrong;
Their throat is a devouring grave,
They flatter with their tongue.
10. By their own counsels let them fall,
Oppressed with loads of sin;
For they against thy righteous Laws
Have hardened rebels been.
11. But let all those who trust in thee,
With shouts their joy proclaim;
Let them rejoice whom thou preserv'st,
And all that love thy Name.
12. To righteous Men the righteous Lord
His Blessing will extend,
And with his favor, from their foes,
As with a Shield, defend.
PSALM VI.
1. THY dreadful anger, Lord, restrain,
And spare a wretch forlorn;
Correct me not in thy fierce wrath,
Too heavy to be born.
2. Have mercy, Lord, my strength decays,
Unable to endure
The anguish of my aching bones,
Which thou alone can cure.
3. My tortured flesh infects my mind,
And sills my Soul with grief;
But, Lord, how long will thou delay
To grant me thy relief!
4. Thy wonted goodness, Lord, repeat,
And ease my troubled Soul;
Lord, for thy wondrous mercy's sake
Vouchsafe to make me whole.
5. For after death no more can I
Thy glorious Acts proclaim;
No prisoner of the silent grave
Can magnify thy Name.
6. Quite tired with pain, with groaning faint,
No hope of ease I see;
The night, that quiets common griefs,
Is spent in tears by me.
7. My beauty fades, my sight grows dim,
My eyes with weakness close;
Old age o'ertakes me, whilst I think
On my insulting Foes.
8. But those that triumph in my harms
No longer shall rejoice;
For God, I find, accepts my tears,
And listens to my voice.
9. 10. God hears and grants my humble prayer,
And they that wish my fall,
Shall blush, and rage, to see that God
Protects me from them all.
PSALM VII.
1. OLord, my God, as I have placed
My trust alone in thee,
From all my persecutors rage
Do thou deliver me.
2. Save me from my remorseless Foe,
Lord, interpose thy power;
Lest, like a Savage Lion, he
My helpless Soul devour.
3, 4. If I am guilty, or did e're
Against his peace combine;
Nay, If I have not spared his life,
Who sought unjustly mine;
5. Let then to persecuting Foes
My Soul become a prey;
Let them to earth tread down my life,
In dust my honor lay.
6. Arise, and let thine anger, Lord,
In my defense engage;
Exalt thy self above my foes,
And their insulting rage:
Awake, awake, in my behalf,
The Judgment to dispense,
Which thou have righteously ordained
For injured Innocence.
7. So to thy Throne adoring crowds
Shall still for Justice fly;
O! therefore for their suffering sakes,
Do thou return on high.
8. Impartial Judge of all the world,
I trust my cause to thee;
O! judge me by my Righteousness,
And hearts Integrity.
9. Let wickedness, and wicked Men,
Together be overthrown;
But six the just, thou God, to whom
The hearts of both are known.
10, 11. God me protects; nor only me,
But all of upright Heart;
And daily lays up wrath for those
Who from his Laws depart.
12, If they persist. he whets his sword;
His bow stands always bent;
13. Even now, with swift destruction winged,
His pointed shafts are sent.
14. Those treacherous plots my foe conceived,
Abortive are and vain;
15. The pit he dug, has proved a grave
His ruins to contain.
16. On his malicious head returns
The mischief he contrived;
The violence, for me designed,
Is to himself arrived.
17. Therefore, of providence Divine,
The Justice I Will proclaim;
I Will sing the praise of God most high,
And celebrate his Name.
PSALM VIII.
1. O Thou, to whom all Creatures bow
Within this earthly frame,
Through all the world how great art Thou!
How glorious is thy Name!
In Heaven thy wondrous Acts are sung,
Nor fully reckoned there;
2. And yet thou make the infant Tongue
Thy boundless Praise declare:
Through thee the weak confound the strong,
And crush their haughty Foes;
And so thou quell'st the wicked throng
That thee and thine oppose.
3. When Heaven, thy beauteous work on high,
Employs my wondering sight;
The Moon, that nightly gilds the sky,
With Stars of feebler light;
4. Lord, what is man, that still thou love
To keep him in thy mind!
Or what his offspring, that thou prov'st
To them so wondrous kind!
5. Him next in power thou did create
To thy celestial train;
6. Ordained, with dignity and state,
Over all thy works to reign.
7. They jointly own his potent sway;
The Beasts that prey, or graze;
8. The Bird, that wings its airy way,
The Fish, that cuts the Seas.
9. O thou, to whom all Creatures bow
Within this earthly frame,
Through all the world how great art Thou!
How glorious is thy Name!
PSALM IX.
1. TO celebrate thy praise, O Lord,
I will my heart prepare;
To all the listening world thy Works,
Thy wondrous Works declare.
2. The thought of them shall to my Soul
Exalted raptures bring;
Whilst to thy Name, O thou most High,
Triumphant Praise I sing.
3. Thou made my haughty Foes to turn
Their backs in shameful flight;
Struck with thy presence down they fell,
They perished at thy sight.
4. Against insulting Foes advanced,
Thou did my cause maintain;
My Right asserting from thy Throne,
Where Truth and Justice reign.
5. The insolence of heathen pride
Thou have reduced to shame;
Their wicked offspring quite destroyed,
And blotted out their name.
6. Mistaken Foes! your threats and you
Are to a period come:
Our Cities stand, designed by you
Their slaughtered owners Tomb.
7, 8. The Lord endures, who has on high
His Righteous Throne prepared,
Impartial Justice to dispense,
To punish or reward.
9. His kindness is a sure defense
Against oppressing rage;
As troubles rise, his needful aids
In our behalf engage.
10. All those who have his Goodness proved
Will in his Truth confide;
Whose mercy never forsook the man
That on his help relied.
11. Sing Praises therefore to the Lord,
From Sion his abode;
Proclaim his Deeds, till all the world
Confess no other God.
PART II.
12. When he enquiry makes for blood,
He Will call their guilt to mind;
The injured humble man's complaint
Relief from him shall find.
13. Compassion on my troubles take,
That spiteful Foes create,
Thou, that have rescued me so often
From deaths devouring gate.
14. In Sion then I Will sing thy Praise,
To all that love thy Name;
And with loud shouts of grateful joy
Thy saving Power proclaim.
15. Deep in the pit they dug for me,
The heathen pride is laid;
Their guilty feet to their own snare
Insensibly betrayed.
16. Thus by the just returns he makes
The mighty Lord is known;
While wicked Men by their own plots
Are shamefully overthrown.
17. His injured Saints, when most distressed,
He never forgets to aid;
Their expectation shall be crowned,
Tho for a time delayed.
18. No single Sinner shall escape,
By privacy obscured;
Nor Nations from his just Revenge
By numbers be secured.
19. Arise, O Lord, assert thy power,
And let not man overcome;
Descend to Judgment, and pronounce
The guilty Heathens doom.
20. Strike terror through the Nations round,
Till by consenting fear,
They, to each other and themselves,
But mortal Men appear.
PSALM X.
1. THy presence why withdraw'st thou, Lord?
Why hid'st thou now thy Face?
When dismal Times of deep distress
Call for thy wonted Grace.
2. The wicked, swelled with lawless pride,
Have made the poor their prey:
O! let them fall by those designs
Which they for others lay.
3. For strait they triumph, if success
Their thriving crimes attend;
And sordid wretches, whom God hates,
In his despite commend.
4. To own a power above themselves
Their haughty pride disdains;
And therefore in their stubborn mind
No thought of God remains.
5. Oppressive methods they pursue,
And all their Foes they slight;
Because thy Judgments unobserved
Are far above their sight.
6. They fondly think, their prosperous state
Shall unmolested be;
They think their vain designs shall thrive,
From all misfortunes free.
7. Vain and deceitful is their Speech,
With curses filled and lies;
By which the mischief they intend,
They study to disguise.
8. Near public Roads they lie concealed,
And all their art employ,
The innocent and poor at once
To rifle and destroy.
9. Not Lions, couchant in their dens,
Surprise their heedless prey
With greater cunning, or express
More savage rage, than they.
10. Sometimes they act the harmless man,
And humble looks they wear;
That so deceived, the poor may less
Their sudden onset fear.
PART II.
11. For God, they think, no notice takes
Of their unrighteous Deeds;
He never minds the suffering poor,
Nor their oppression heeds.
12. But Thou, O Lord, at length arise;
Stretch forth thy mighty Arm;
And by the greatness of thy Power
Defend the poor from harm.
13. No longer let the wicked vaunt.
And proudly boasting say,
"Tush, God regards not what we do,
"He never will repay.
14. But sure thou see, and all their deeds
Impartially shall try;
The Orphan therefore and the Poor
To thee for succor fly.
15. Defenseless let the wicked fall,
Of all their strength bereft:
Destroy, O God, their vile designs,
Till none of them be left.
16. Assert thy just Dominion, Lord,
Which shall for ever stand;
Through which the Heathen were expelled
From this thy chosen Land.
17. Thy humble suppliants still thou hear'st
That to thy Throne repair;
Thou first prepar'st their hearts to pray,
And then accept'st their prayer.
18. Thou in thy righteous Judgment weigh'st
The Fatherless and Poor;
That so the Tyrants of the earth
May persecute no more.
PSALM XI.
1. SInce I in God have placed my trust,
A refuge always nigh,
Why should I, like a timorous Bird,
To distant mountains fly?
2. Behold, the wicked bend their bow,
And ready fix their dart;
Lurking in ambush, to destroy
The man of upright heart.
3. When once the firm assurance fails
Which public Faith imparts,
It Is time for innocence to fly,
From such deceitful arts.
4. The Lord has both a Temple here,
And righteous Throne above;
Whence he surveys the Sons of Men,
And how their counsels move.
5. If God, the Righteous whom he loves,
For trial does correct;
What must the Sons of violence,
Whom he abhors, expect?
6. Snares, fire, and brimstone, on their heads
Shall in one tempest shower;
This dreadful mixture his revenge
Into their cup shall pour.
7. The righteous Lord will righteous Deeds
With signal favor grace;
And on the upright man reflect
The brightness of his face.
PSALM XII.
1. SInce godly men decay, O Lord,
Do thou my cause defend;
For scarce these wretched times afford
One just and faithful Friend.
2. One Neighbor now can scarce believe
What the other does impart;
With flattering lips they all deceive,
And with a double heart
3. But lips that with deceit abound
Shall never prosper long;
God's Righteous Vengeance will confound
The proud blaspheming Tongue.
4. In vain those foolish boasters say,
"Our tongues are sure our own;
"With doubtful words we'll still betray,
"And be controlled by none.
5. For God, who hears the poor oppressed,
And all their sufferings knows,
Will soon arise, and give them rest,
In spite of all their Foes.
6. The word of God shall still abide,
And void of falsehood be;
As is the silver, sev'n-times tried,
From drosly mixture free.
7. The promise of his aiding Grace
Shall reach its purposed end;
His Servants from this faithless Race
He ever shall defend.
8. Then shall the wicked be perplexed,
Nor know which way to fly;
When those, whom they despised and vexed,
Shall be advanced on high.
PSALM XIII.
1. HOW long will thou forget me, Lord?
Must I for ever mourn?
How long will thou withdraw from me?
Oh! never to return!
2. How long shall anxious thoughts my soul,
And grief my heart oppress?
How long my enemies insult,
And I have no redress?
3. O hear! and to my longing eyes
Restore thy wonted light;
And suddenly, or I shall sleep
In everlasting night.
4. Restore me, lest they proudly boast
'Twas their own strength o'ercame;
Permit not them that vex my soul
To triumph in my shame.
5. Surely, as I have placed my trust
Beneath thy mercies wing,
E're long, when thy salvation comes,
My heart with joy shall spring.
6. Then shall my song, with praise inspired,
To thee my God ascend;
Who to thy servant in distress
Such bounty did extend.
PSALM XIV.
1. THE wicked Fools must sure suppose
That God is nothing but a name;
This their corrupt lewd practice shows,
Since righteous Acts they all disclaim.
2. The Lord looked down from Heavens high tower,
And did the race of mankind view;
To see, if any owned his power,
If any, Truth or Justice knew.
3. But all, he saw, were gone aside,
All were degenerate grown and base;
None took Religion for their guide,
Not one of all the sinful Race.
4. But can these workers of deceit
Be all so dull and senseless grown?
That they, like bread, my people eat,
And God's Almighty Power disown?
5. How will they tremble then for fear,
When his just Wrath shall them overtake?
For to the righteous God is near,
And never will their cause forsake.
6. In vain ungodly Men condemn
Those counsels which the Just pursue;
Since God a refuge is for them
Whom his just Eyes with favor view.
7. Would he his saving Power employ,
To break his peoples servile band!
Then shouts of universal joy
Should loudly echo through the Land.
PSALM XV.
1. LOrd, who is the happy man, that may
To thy blessed Courts repair?
Not, stranger-like, to visit them,
But to inhabit there?
2. It Is he, whose every thought and deed
By rules of virtue moves;
Whose generous Tongue disdains to speak
The thing his heart disproves.
3. Who never did a slander forge,
His neighbors fame to wound;
Nor hearkens to a false Report,
By malice whispered round.
4. Who Vice, in all its pomp and power,
Can treat with just neglect;
And piety, tho clothed in rags,
Religiously respect.
Who to his plighted vows and trust
Has ever firmly stood;
And tho he promise to his loss,
He makes his promise good.
5. Whose soul in usury disdains
His treasure to employ;
Whom no rewards could ever bribe,
The guiltless to destroy.
The man, who by this steady course
Has happiness ensur'd;
When earths foundations shake, shall stand,
By providence secured.
PSALM XVI.
1. PRotect me from my cruel Foes,
And shield me, Lord, from harm;
Because my trust I still repose
On thy Almighty Arm.
2. My soul all help but thine does slight,
All Gods but thee disown;
Yet can no deeds of mine requite
The goodness thou have shown.
3. But those that are of virtuous Note,
Who love the thing that is right,
To favor always and promote,
Shall be my chief delight.
4. How shall their sorrows be increased,
Who other Gods adore?
Their bloody offerings I detest,
Their very names abhor.
5. My lot is fallen in that blessed Land
Where God is purely served;
He fills my cup with liberal hand;
My right's by him preserved.
6. In natures most delightful scene
My happy portion lies;
The place of my appointed reign
All other Lands outvies.
7. Therefore my soul shall bless the Lord,
Whose Word's my guide and light;
Who private counsel does afford,
In dark affliction's night.
8. Nothing, I know, can lie concealed
From his All-seeing Eye;
And my firm hope has never failed,
Because he still is nigh.
9. Therefore my heart all grief defies,
My glory does rejoice;
My flesh shall rest, in hope to rise,
Waked by his powerful voice.
10. Thou, Lord, when I resign my breath,
My soul from hell wilt free;
Nor let thy Holy One in death
The least corruption see.
11. Thou shall the paths of Life display,
Which to thy presence lead;
Where pleasures dwell without allay,
And joys that never fade.
PSALM XVII.
1. HEar my just plea, to my complaint
Attend, O Righteous Lord!
And to my prayer, as it is unfeigned,
A gracious Ear afford.
2. As in thy presence I Am approved,
So let my sentence be;
And with impartial Eyes, O Lord,
My upright dealing see.
3. For thou have proved my heart by day,
And visited by night;
And on the strictest trial found
Its secret motions right.
Nor shall thy Justice, Lord, alone
My hearts designs acquit;
For I have purposed, that my Tongue
Shall no offense commit.
4. I know, what wicked men would do,
Their safety to maintain;
But me thy just and mild commands
From bloody Paths restrain.
5. That I may still, in spite of wrongs,
My innocence secure;
O! Guide me in thy Righteous Ways,
And make my footsteps sure.
6. Since heretofore I never in vain
To thee my prayer addressed;
O! now, my God, incline thine Ear
To this my just request.
7. The wonders of thy love and care
In my defense engage,
Thou, whose right Hand preserves thy Saints
From their oppressors rage.
PART II.
8, 9. O! keep me in thy tenderest care,
With sheltering wings stretched out,
From cruel and oppressing Foes,
That compass me about.
10. O'ergrown with luxury, enclosed
In their own fat they lie;
And with a proud blaspheming Mouth
Both God and Man defy.
11. Well, may they boast; for they have now
My path encompassed round;
Their eyes at watch, their bodies bowed,
And couching to the ground.
12. In posture of a Lion set,
When greedy of his prey;
Or a young Lion, when he lurks
Within a covert way.
13. Arise, O Lord, defeat their plots,
Their swelling rage control;
From the ungodly man, thy Sword,
Deliver thou my Soul.
14. From worldly Men, thy sharpest scourge,
Whose portion's here below;
Who, filled with earthly stores, aspire
No other bliss to know;
15. Pleased with a numerous Race, to share
Their substance while they live;
Successive heirs, to whom they may
The vast remainder give.
16. But, Lord, for me, I only crave
The treasure of thy Grace;
And waking in my Soul to find
The Image of thy Face.
PSALM XVIII.
1, 2. NO change of times shall ever shock
My firm affection, Lord, to Thee:
For thou have always been a rock,
A fortress, and defense to me.
Thou my deliv'rer art, my God;
My trust is in thy mighty Power;
Thou art my shield from foes abroad,
At home my safeguard, and my tower.
3. To thee I Will still address my prayer,
To whom my praise I justly owe;
So shall I, by thy watchful care,
Be guarded from my treacherous Foe.
4, 5. By floods of wicked Men distressed,
With deadly sorrows compassed round,
With dire infernal Pangs oppressed,
In deaths unwieldy fetters bound.
6. To Heaven I make my mournful prayer,
To God address my humble moan;
Who graciously inclines his Ear,
And hears me from his lofty Throne.
PART II.
7. When God arose to take my part,
The trembling Earth did quake for fear;
From their firm posts the Hills did start,
Nor durst his dreadful fury bear.
8. Thick clouds of smoke, dispersed abroad,
Ensigns of wrath, before him came;
Devouring fire around him glowed,
That coals were kindled at its flame.
9. He left the beauteous Realms of Light,
Whilst Heaven bowed down its awful head;
Beneath his feet, substantial Night
Was, like a sable carpet, spread.
10. The Chariot of the King of Kings,
Which troops of harnessed Angels drew,
On a strong tempest's rapid wings
With most amazing swiftness flew.
11, 12. Black watery mists and clouds conspired
With thickest shades his face to veil;
But at his brightness soon retired,
And fell in showers of fire and hail.
13. Through Heavens wide Arch a thundering peal
Gods angry voice, did loudly roar;
While earths sad face, with heaps of hail
And flakes of fire, was covered over.
14. His sharpened arrows round he threw,
Which made his scattered foes retreat;
Like darts, his nimble Lightenings flew,
And quickly finished their defeat.
15. The deep its secret stores disclosed;
The worlds Foundations naked lay;
By his avenging Wrath exposed,
Which fiercely raged, that dreadful day.
PART III.
16. The Lord did on my side engage,
From Heaven, his Throne, my cause upheld;
And snatched me from the furious rage
Of threatening waves that proudly swelled.
17. God his resistless Power employed,
My strongest Foes attempts to break;
Who else with ease had soon destroyed
The weak defense that I could make.
18. Their subtle rage had near prevailed,
When I distressed and friendless lay;
But still, when other succors failed,
God was my firm support and stay.
19. From dangers, that enclosed me round,
He brought me forth, and set me free;
For some just cause his goodness found,
That moved him to delight in me.
20. Because in me no guilt remains,
God does his gracious help extend;
My hands are free from bloody stains,
Therefore the Lord is still my Friend.
21, 22. For I his Judgments kept in sight;
In his just Ways I always trod;
I never did his Statutes slight,
Nor vainly wandered from my God.
23, 24. But still my Soul sincere and pure,
Did even from darling sins refrain;
His favors therefore yet endure,
Because my heart and hands are clean.
PART IV.
25, 26. Thou suit'st, O Lord, thy righteous Ways
To various paths of human kind;
They who for mercy merit praise,
With thee shall wondrous mercy find.
Thou to the Just shall Justice show.
Thy purity the pure shall see;
Such as perversely choose to go,
Shall meet perverse returns from thee.
27, 28. That he the humble Soul will save,
And crush the haughty's boasted might.
In me the Lord an instance gave,
Whose darkness he has turned to light.
29. On his firm succor I relied,
And did over numerous Foes prevail;
Nor feared, whilst he was on my side,
The best defended walls to scale.
30. For Gods designs shall still succeed;
His Word will bear the strictest Test;
He Is a strong shield to all that need,
And on his sure protection rest.
31. Who then deserves to be adored,
But God, on whom my hopes depend?
Or who, except the mighty Lord,
Can with resistless power defend?
PART V.
32, 33. It Is God that girds my armor on,
And all my just designs fulfils;
Through him my feet can swiftly run,
And nimbly climb the steepest hills.
34. Lessons of war from him I take,
And manly weapons learn to wield;
Strong bows of steel with ease I break,
Forced to my stronger Arms to yield.
35. The buckler of his saving health
Protects me from assaulting foes;
His hand sustains me still; my wealth
And greatness from his bounty flows.
36. My goings he enlarged abroad,
Before to narrow paths confined;
And when in slippery ways I trod,
The method of my steps designed.
37. Through him I numerous Foes defeat,
And in their hasty flight overtake;
Nor from my fierce pursuit retreat,
Till a full end of all I make.
38. Covered with wounds, in vain they try
Their vanquished heads again to rear;
Groveling beneath my feet they lie,
From whence to rise they must despair.
39. God, when fierce Armies take the field,
Recruits my strength, and courage warms;
He makes my strong opposers yield,
Subdued by my prevailing Arms.
40. Through him, the necks of prostrate Foes
My conquering feet in triumph press;
Aided by him, I root out those
Who hate and envy my success.
41. With loud complaints all friends they tried,
But none was able to defend;
At length to God for succor cried,
But God would no assistance lend.
42. Like flying dust which winds pursue,
Their broken troops were scattered round;
Contemptible and vile they grew,
As loathsome dirt that clogs the ground.
PART VI.
43. Our factious Tribes, at strife till now,
At Gods appointment me obey;
The Heathen to my Scepter bow,
And Foreign Nations own my sway.
44. Remotest Realms their homage send,
When my successful name they hear;
Strangers for my commands attend,
Charmed with respect, or awed by fear.
45. All to my summons tamely yield,
Or soon in battle are dismayed;
For stronger Holds they quit the field,
And still in strongest Holds afraid.
46. Let the Eternal Lord be praised!
The Rock on whose defense I rest!
Over highest Heavens his Name be raised,
Who me with his Salvation blessed!
47. It Is God that still supports my right,
His just Rovenge my foes pursues;
It Is he, that with resistless Might
Fierce Nations to my yoke subdues.
48. My universal safeguard, He!
From whom my lasting honors slow;
He made me great, and set me free
From my remorseless bloody Foe.
49. Therefore to celebrate his fame
My grateful voice to Heaven I Will raise;
And Nations, strangers to his Name,
Shall thus be taught to sing his Praise;
50. "God to his King deliverance sends;
"Shows his Anointed signal Grace;
"His mercy evermore extends
"To David, and his promised Race.
PSALM XIX.
1. THE Heavens declare thy Glory, Lord,
Which that alone can fill;
The Firmament and Stars express
Their great Creators skill.
2. Revolving days, with every dawn,
Fresh beams of knowledge bring;
From darkest nights successive rounds
Divine Instructions spring.
3. Their powerful Language to no Realm
Or Region is confined;
It Is Natures voice, and understood
Alike by all Mankind.
4. Their Doctrines sacred Sense itself
Through Earths extent displays;
Whose bright contents the circling Sun
Around the World conveys.
5. No Bridegroom, for his Nuptials dressed,
Has such a cheerful face;
No Giant does like him rejoice
To run his glorious race.
6. From East to West, from West to East,
His restless circuit goes;
And through his progress, cheerful light
And vital warmth bestows.
PART II.
7. Gods perfect Law converts the Soul,
Reclaims from false desires;
With sacred Wisdom his firm Word
The ignorant inspires.
8. The Statutes of the Lord are Just,
And bring fincere delight;
His pure commands, in search of Truth,
Assist the feeblest sight.
9. His fear is clean, his worship fixed
For ever to abide;
His equal Judgments in the scale
Of Truth and Justice tried.
10. Of more esteem than golden Mines,
Or Gold refined with skill;
More sweet than honey, or the drops
That from the comb distill.
11. My trusty Counselors they are,
And friendly warnings give;
Divine Rewards attend on those
Who by thy Precepts live.
12. But what frail man observes, how often
He does thy Laws transgress?
Do thou, who only know them all,
My secret faults redress.
13. Let no presumptuous Sin, O Lord,
Dominion have over me;
Preserve me guiltless, or at least
From great offenses free.
14. So shall my prayer and praises be
With thy acceptance blessed;
And I secure on thy defense,
My strength and Savior, rest.
PSALM XX.
1. THE Lord to thy request attend,
And hear thee in distress;
The Name of Jacob's God defend,
And grant thy Arms success.
2. To aid thee from on high repair,
And strength from Sion give;
Remember all thy offerings there,
Thy sacrifice receive.
3. To compass thy own heart's desire
Thy counsels still direct;
Make kindly all events conspire
To bring them to effect.
4. To thy Salvation, Lord, for aid
We'll cheerfully repair,
With banners in thy Name displayed;
The Lord accept thy prayer.
5. Our hopes are now confirmed, the Lord
Will by our Sovereign stand;
From Heaven the saving strength afford
Of his resistless Hand.
6. Some trust in Steeds, for war designed,
On Chariots some rely;
Against them All, we'll call to mind
The Name of God most high.
7. But from their Steeds and Chariots thrown,
Behold them through the plain,
Disordered, broke, and trampled down,
Whilst firm our Troops remain.
8. Still save us, Lord, and still proceed
Our rightful cause to bless;
Hear, King of Heaven, in times of need
The prayers that we address.
FINIS.
