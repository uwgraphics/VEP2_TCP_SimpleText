royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE By the King.
A Proclamation for the ease of the Subjects in making their Compositions for
not receiving the Order of Knighthood, according to the Law.
WHereas We have heretofore granted Our Commission under Our Great Seal of
England, to sundry of the Lords, and others of Our Privy Council, to Treat
and Compound with such of Our loving Subjects, as by Law ought to make their
Fines with Us for not making their appearance at the time and place by Our
Writts appointed for receiving the Order of Knightgood, wherein our
Commissioners have so far proceeded, that many have Compounded with them, and
paid their Fines agreed upon accordingly, and We are resolved constantly to
hold the like course with all others, who are liable by Law to pay the like
Fines. Nevertheless, because many parts of this Our Kingdom are so remote
from Our City of London, as the travail from thence hither would be very
chargeable and troublesome, and at this time dangerous to draw them from their
own dwellings, to attend their Compositions at Our Cities of London or
Westminster: In favor of Our good and loving Subjects whom it concerns, We
have resolved to send Our Commissions to the several Counties of this Our
Realm, to whom they may with more ease and safety repair for their dispatch.
Whereof We have thought fit by these presents to give notice to all whom it
may concern, hereby letting them know, that if they shall neglect this Our
Grace, and not attend Our Commissioners in their several Counties where they
dwell, and with them make agreement on Our behalf, that We shall leave them
to the just proceedings of Our Law, and to that end to attend Our Commissioners
at Whitehall, or Our Court of Exchequer, and if it shall so fall out to be more
charge or trouble unto them, they shall have just cause to lay the blame upon
themselves, and to acknowledge Our Grace and favor, if in time it had been
accepted.

Given at Our Court at Saint James, the sixth day of July, in the sixth year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXX.
