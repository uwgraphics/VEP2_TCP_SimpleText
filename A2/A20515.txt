THe great cause (as I do think) why we profit little in the way of
perfeccion is: that we do not with all our study and dylyge^ce / follow by
perseueraunt exercise in our daily conuersacy on / the good instruccyons and
counceylles that be daily given us of our lord god. The which for the
gracyous desire that he has of our salvation: cease not to admonysshe and
teache us / how we should ensue and obtain our souls health: and his perpetual
favor: not only by secret inspyracy on / but also by outward techynges and
en samples: that often times we read and se. And this defaulte in ve ryseth
partly of our nelygence / that we give no great force of our own profit:
partly of our frail and oblyuyous memory / that soon forgets what is taught
us: but if by often rehersynge it be depesy written and graven in our stony
hertes. Against the first the only remedy is a good will / the which with the
help of grace (daily desiring by contynuall prayers to amend) shall at the
last opteyne that it perseuerantly desires. Against the second defaulte the
remedy is: often times to read or here those things the which would always be
had in mind. wherefore I have according to your devout request / noted breuely
i^ this little papyre three exercyses: the which I have many times cou^ceylled
you to use at three times of the day specially / that is to say in the morning
when ye ryseat your meat / and when ye go to rest.

In the morning.
AS soon as ye be full waking mark well what thing comes first to your mind
And if ye have been waking at any time of the night past / what remembrance ye
have had of god. And if ye find that any thing has occupied your heart then
the rule of perfeccyon requires / the which is that our heart be at altymes
vnyd and knytte unto god / either by actual love and contemplacyon of his
goodness with de we thanks gyuynge for his benefytes / or else by contynuall
prayer and confession of our own euylles. Then anon with great heaviness
complain of your self knowlegyng that this i^perfeccyon is found in you for
want of dylygent ghostly exercise in the time past. And with a fervent desire
to amend from thensforth: begin anon with humble prostracyo^ both of spyryte
and also of body (if ye be alone) to praise the glorious trynyte saying thus. O
beata et benedicta and gloriosa trinitas tibi laus et gloria et gratiaru^ actio
ab omni creatura tua perinfinita secula seculorum. Amen.

Thus in sentence. O blyssed and glorious trynyte / laud / glory and thanks
be to the of all thy creatures / world without any end. Amen. And when ye say
this prayer: speak it not only with your tongue / but of all your hole heart
most affectuously desire that the praise / glory and thank of all goodness
that is or shall be wrought by you or any other creature be returned all only
to him the which is the begyn^yng / the mids and the end of al thing yt is
worthy any praise. And acustome to rehearse this many times on the day / so often
as ye feel any ghostly / or else corporal / delectacyon of god / or of his
creatures / that is to say when soever ye be touched with inward devotion or
good thought: when ye co^sydre the graces of saints / when ye be delyted with
the be wty of any creature / when your meat and drink do content your
appetyte / and so of al other things that pleases you. Always syngeth your
heart and many times speak with your mouth. O beata triuitas. vts^. But
specially se that ye in no wise omytte this when ye be moved to vayngsory. And
I think the contynuall exercise of your h^rte in this one lesson / shall much
promote and increase the grace and love of god in you.

But now retournyng to the mornings exercise when ye do on your clothes / se
that your mind be occupied i^ the praise of god thanking him that he has so
plentuously puyded for you al necessaryes / many other much better then ye /
being i^ need / and pray him to move your heart: and the hertes of other to
releue his poor people. And this ye shall dylygently remember both at your
fedynge and when ye go to your rest at night.

First when that ye be clothed before that ye depart out of your chamber say
this short prayer following before some image of our lord Ihesu christ /
first thanking him for your creacyon and rede^pcyon saying. Gratias tibi ago
domine Ihesu criste qui me creastiredemisti et preordinasti ad hoc quoth sum: tu
scis quid de me facere vis / fac de me secu^dum voluntatem tuam cum
misericordia. Amen.

Lord Ihesu christ that have created me / hedemed me / and prcordynat me to be
that I am: thou know what thou wylt do with me / therefore make of me what
soever thy will is after thy mercy. Amen.

And when ye say this knowledge in your heart that ye are well content with the
estate and calling that ye be in: desiring intyerly with all your heart to
be obedyent to the ordinance of god what soever it pleases him to make of you.

Secunderly confess yt al your life past has been full of sin and much
unkindness to ward your lord god / promising vnfeyningly that ye will without
any further delay / with the help of his grace this same day begin a new
life / humbly asking mercy and remyssyon / saying.

Dn^e Ihesu criste ego cognosco me grauiter peccasse / et libenter vo lo me
emendare per gratiam tuam miserere mei propter amaram passionem tuam. Amen. O
lord Ihesu christ I know that I have grievously sinned / and gladly I will
amend me by thy grace: have mercy on me for thy bitter passion. And when ye
say thus / have before your eyes some of your greatest offenses yt most may
move you to shame of your self and to contrycyon.

Thyrdlye utterly dysprayrynge of your self (thynkyng that ye are not in any
wise able or suffycye^t to order your own life and to gyde your self in the
way of virtue) commit you fully to the prouyde^ce of god and say Domine Ihesu
criste qui solus es sapientia patris / tu scis que michi peccatori expediunt,
prout tibi placet / et sicut i^ oculis tue maiestatis videtur de me / ita fiat
cum misericordia. Amen. O lord Ihesu christ that only art the wysdom of the
father / thou know what things are to me expedyent / as it pleases the:
and as it is seen in the eyes of thy majesty of me / so be it with mercy.
Amen. And when ye say thus: offer your self perpetually to be obedyent to all
ghostly counceylles and mouynges of the holy ghost / to the power of your
freyltye. Unto the hour of death: saying in remembrance thereof. In manus
tuas domine. etc. Lord in to thy hands I commend my soul and body: having
a full purpose to be wylful to dye: when soever it shall please our lord to
call you. After that ye have thus done: ye shall give thanks to the trynyte
(as ye before have been taught) for three special excellentes given to our
blessed lady: saying thryes. Aue maria. Greatly desyryng to do some thing
before ye dye that may be pleasant to her. And then have mind of your good
angel and other saints to whom ye have special devotion: namely those
which shall be honored in the church that day. And of this ye may occupye
your mind in the way to ward the church / prepayrynge your heart to prayer
/ by the remembrance of some part of their life. And when ye come to church
/ se that ye do nothing only of custom / as it were a thing that has no
reason or under standing. But in all thing consydre the presence of your
lord god: having him co^tynually before the eye of your soul. and so behave
you in all things / that your service may be pleasynge to him the which
requires of us not only our corporal exercise / but much more the exercise
of our heart. And before ye depart out from the church forget not to thank
our lord with all your heart that he has given you grace that day to be
present at his holy service: and such leisure that ye may attend without
worldly let your souls health: thynking yt many one in the world that be
compelled of need to apply their bodily labors* if they might have such
seysure as ye have to ensue the spyrytuall life: should much more profit in
virtue than ye do: and be peraue^ture (not withstanding all their besynes)
much more fervent in the love of god. And then call to mind how many
persons beset from the presence of the church to provide for your need /
meat / drink / and clothe: and hertely commend them al at the lest
ingenerall to our lord and his saints.

In departing from the church beware that ye fall not anon to idle speech:
but in the way consydre by order / how ye have been occupied in the church /
and what devotion our lord has given you / and what good purpose ye have been
moved to / and give god and his saints thanks with a full desire to follow
them. And likewise co^sydre wherein ye have be fawty and neclyge^t / and be sorry
therefore with a purpose to be more ware from thensforth. And thus ye shall do
after every work / before ye dyuerte to any other occupacyon. And when ye come
home to your chamber / se yt ye demean your self there like as at the church:
at all times considering the presence of god / and his angels. First at your
entryng / on your knees salute our savior and his mother / and apply your
self to some profitable occupacyon / considering in the beginning whether it
be of necessytye or else voluntary. If so be that it be of necessytye it may
not be omytted / But and if it be of voluntarye then co^sydre whether there be
any other thing of more necessytye and profit that may be done at that same
time or not / and say to your self would thou be thus occupied if thou
should dye this day / and constrayne your self with the fere of death to
spend your time at every hour to the most profit of your soul / offering
your heart with your work both at the beginning and at the ending unto our
lord. And before ye depart from your chamber / commit your custodye and
governance to our lord and to your good angel.

Before your meat.
PRepare your heart dylygently to com thereto with co^punccyon / the which is
the most excellent remedy against al se^suall appetytes. And though there ben
many means to induce compu^ccyon / yet that notwithstanding it shall be
expedyent / that ye be determined every day to some inspecyal / wherefore I shall
assygne to you like as ye desired for every day in the weke one refeccyon of
our lord Ihesu / yt ye may be accustomed to feed with him.These seven ye shall
find in vita christi secundum bonauenturam: in the chapytres here intytled. On
moneday the.xvii. chapter.i. On tuesdaye the.xxii. chapter.ii. On wednesdaye
the.xxiii. chapter.iii. On thursdaye the.xxv. chapter.iiii. On frydaye
the.xxxix. chapter.v. On saturdaye the.xxxiii. chapter.vi. On sunday
the.lxii. chapter.vii.


These chapitres ye shall use to read either in part or hole as may be
suffycye^t to stir your herie to compu^ccyon. But if ye will find shortly
the fruit of your redynge / se yt ye begin with a great desire to take profit
thereof / and ask of our lord help saying.

Emitte domine sapie^tiam tuam de sede magnitudinis tue vt mecu^sit et mecum
laboret / vt sciam quid acceptum sit coram te in omni tempore. Amen. Good lord
send out thy wysdom from the seet of thy magnyfyce^ce that it may be with me
and labor with me / so that I may know what is acceptable before the at all
times. Then begin to read every thing reverently / depely merkynge each word
that ye read / often times asking grace to profit.

And when ye shall make an end / consydre your doing as I have said before /
and give god thanks for his help / and confess your own neclyge^ce. And
then give thanks also to our lord for the saint that wrote those things for
the profit of your soul: and say i^ the honor of him one. Aue maria. And so
co^mendynge your self unto our lord / come to your meat with heaviness of
heart that ye be compelled for the need of your body (the which is your
co^tynuall enemy) to leave the service of your most beloved spouse. After
this when ye have said grace (intyerly desyryng our lord lo bliss you and all
your company / and his creatures that ye shall feed of) take your place in
order as besemeth / thinking your self to use the to wme of a servant and
not of a souetayne if yt ye will follow his example that said. Ego in medio
vestru^ sum sicut qui ministrat. I am amongst you as it were a mynystre or a
servant. Being glad if all other have that thing that co^tenteth them. And
think that ye alone be unworthy the bread that ye do eat. And observe at your
meal these five things.

First that ye feed not gredely without consyderacyon / but before every time
that ye shall take your meat: lift your heart un to god thanking him that he
has made that creature for your use / and then consydre whyther it be
co^uenyent for the health of your body: and then take of it moderatly seuinge
the best for other that be more worthy.

The second is that your abstynence be as secret as ye can / standing
rather in the brekynge of your appetytes / and forberynge of those meats that
ye feel yourselfe much inclyned to desire: than in any syngularytie notable.

The third that you refuse nothing yt is offered you / but with great devotion
receive it as sent of god / gyuynge thanks to him therefore. And when ye have
taken part of it / give the resydue as ye think best / specially for the
norysshynge of charity.

The fourth / that in all that time ye study to keep in your heart the
remembrance of god at every morsel that ye receive / gyuynge thanks in heart
to him. And every thing that ye leave / offer it unto him / and your heart
withal.

The fyft / that ye do not forgette to pray for the pore people (like as ye
did i^ the morning.) And when ye have fed suffycyently / so that ye leave
always with hungry stomach / beware then of idle words. But if the
co^uenyency of the company so requires / to find such co^munycacyo^ that may
edyfye your self and the herers.

When ye have said grace / as shortly as ye may conuenyently / without any
occasyon depart to your Chamber and recompte with your self how you have
done as is before rehearsed. Then be much ware of ydlenes: and apply your
self to some profitable exercise. And if any thing would occupye your mind
that before ye have herd or seen: an one return in heart unto our Lord
Ihesu / and tell him all the matter / whatsoever it be. If ye be dyscontentyd
make your playnt unto him. If ye have done amysse / confess forth with to him.
If ye be in any doubt or perplexyte ask counceyll of him. If ye be sick o:
dyseased let him be your Physycyon. And generally at all times have him
sitting in the myddyst of your heart / as your Judge / your priest / your
master and leche.

When the after noone is passed in virtuous oc^upacyon / order your self in
the service of god / before your supper and in the time t^^^of syke as is
before rehersyd. So that ye endeuer your self always to do better the after
noone than ye did the forenone And the second day better than ye did the
first / and so forth to your lives end. But in all things beware that ye be
not much anxious or pensyfe / nor long abiding in any heaviness / nor yet
greatly labourynge for to weep / though ye find your self much neclygent:
and daily fawty little or nothing amendynge. For it is another necessary nor
profitable / but much let of profit to them / that find in them self a
good will / to serve god. But rather / anon as ye find and have aspyed your
defaute and co^fessyd it to our lord / thank him of his great pacyence / that
he has with you / and by such means renders you to the knowledge of your
self / and thereby unto mekenes. And sing always in your heart. O beata et
gloriosa trinitas. As it is beforesayde. For it is much better in all things
to consydre the goodness of god: and to praise him therefore / than to consydre
your own evil / and to mourn for it. And example much notable for this / ye
have in vitis patrum / of two brethren.

Before night.
AT complyne time / call to mind in order the benefits of our Lord showed to
you that day / and thank him for them. And contrary wise your neclygence /
and all your deeds / words and thoughts / making co^fessyon of them to our
lord. And those things that be notable / whereof ye should be most asshamed to
show / Imprynt them in your mind with purpose to confess them to your
ghostly father / asking grace that ye may so do.

Consydre also what saints inspecyall ye have served that day / and what ye
have done to their honor / comptynge that day in manner lost / that ye do not
obtain some frendshyp of the cytezens of heaven / where ye shall evermore
dwell. And then teme^bre what saynees be the next day / with a desire to honor
them. After all this / when ye have also prayed for the poor people / syke as
ye did in the morning / commend your self unto our lord / our lady / your
good angel / and all saints with the same prayers / and in the same order as
is before written. And the time that ye do of your clothes / and till that
sleep close your senses / keep your heart dylygently occupied in remembrynge
the goodness of our Lord to ward you: and specially his gracyous prouydence
and long pacyence that he has with you from day to day. And then conceive a
great desire and a fervent purpose to begin the next day tymely / to amend
your life. And if ye contynewe this order and cease not / but perseuerantly
enforse your self to keep it to your lives end. I trust in gods mercy by
the prayers of his holy mother and all saints / ye shall increase in good life
/ and in the love and favor of our lord Ihesu. To whom be all praise /
honor / and glory with out end. Amen.

Deo gratias.
