books have been unduly printed, and other books and papers without license,
to the disturbance of the peace of the Church and State: For prevention whereof
in time to come, It is now Ordered and Decreed, That the said former Decrees
and Ordinances shall stand in force with these Additions, Explanations, and

or them six other high Commissioners, to supply the place or places of those,
which are now already Printers by this Court, as they shall fall void by death,
or Censure, or otherwise: Provided that they exceed not the number of Twenty,
besides His Majesty's Printers, and the Printers allowed for the Universities.

XVI. Item, That every person or persons, now allowed or admitted to have the
use of a Press, and Printing House, shall within Ten days after the date

entered into by all, and every person and persons, that hereafter shall be
admitted, or allowed to print, before he or they be suffered to have the use of
a Press.

XVII. Item, That no allowed Printer shall keep above two Presses, unless he
has been Master or upper Warden of his Company, who are thereby allowed to
keep three Presses and no more, under pain of being disabled for ever after to
keep or use any Press at all, unless for some great and special occasion
for the public, he or they have for a time leave of the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, or Lord Bishop of London for the time being, to have or use one, or
more above the foresaid number, as their Lordships, or either of them shall
think fit. And whereas there are some Master Printers that have at this
present one, or more Presses allowed them by this Decree, the Court does
further order and declare, That the Master and Wardens of the Company of
Stationers, do forthwith certify the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, or the
Lord Bishop of London, what number of Presses each Master Printer has, that
their Lordships or either of them, taking unto them six other high
Commissioners, may take such present order for the suppressing of the
supernumerarie Presses, as to their Lordships, or to either of them shall seem

charge hereby, but the bringing and leaving of two printed copies of the book

additions as the Author has made.

XIX. Item, The Court does declare, as formerly, so now, That no Apprentices be
taken into any printing house, otherwise then according to this proportion
following, (viz.) every Master-Printer that is, or has been Master or upper
Warden of his Company, may have three Apprentices at one time and no more, and
every Master-printer that is of the Liuerie of his Company, may have two
Apprentices at one time and no more, and every Master-printer of the Yeomanry
of the Company may have one Apprentice at one time and no more, neither by
Copartnership, binding at the Scriueners, nor any other way whatsoever; neither
shall it be lawful for any Master-Printer when any Apprentice or Apprentices,
shall run or be put away, to take another Apprentice, or other Apprentices in
his or their place or places, unless the name or names of him or them so gone
away, be raced out of the Hall book, and never admitted again, upon pain of
being for ever disabled of the use of a Press or printing house, and of such
further punishment, as by this Court, or the high Commission Court
respectively, as the several causes shall require, shall be thought fit to be
imposed.

XX. Item, The Court does likewise declare, that because a great part of the
secret printing in corners has been caused for want of orderly employment for
Iourneymen printers, Therefore the Court does hereby require the Master and
Wardens of the Company of Stationers, to take especial care that all
Iourneymen-printers, who are free of the Company of Stationers, shall be set to
work, and employed within their own Company of Stationers; for which purpose
the Court does also order and declare, that if any Iourneyman-Printer, and free
of the Company of Stationers, who is of honest, and good behavior, and able in
his trade, do want employment, he shall repair to the Master and Wardens of
the Company of Stationers, and they or one of them, taking with him or them
one or two of the Master Printers, shall go along with the said
Iourneyman-Printer, and shall offer his service in the first place to the
Master-Printer under whom he served his Apprentiship, if he be living, and do
continue an allowed Printer, or otherwise to any other Master Printer, whom the
Master and Wardens of the said Company shall think fit. And every Master
Printer shall be bound to employ one Iourneyman, being so offered to him, and
more, if need shall so require, and it shall be so adjudged to come to his
share, according to the proportion of his Apprentices and employments, by the
Master and Wardens of the Company of Stationers, although he the said Master
Printer with his Apprentice or Apprentices be able without the help of the
said Iourneyman or Iourneymen to discharge his own work, upon pain of such
punishment, as by this Court, or the high Commission Court respectively, as the
several causes shall require, shall be thought fit.

XXI. Item, The Court does declare, That if the Master and Wardens of the
Company of Stationers, or any of them, shall refuse or neglect to go along
with any honest and sufficient Iourney-man Printer, so desiring their
assistance, to find him employment, upon complaint and proof made thereof,
he, or they so offending, shall suffer imprisonment, and such other punishment,
as by this court, or the high Commission Court respectively, as the several
causes shall require, shall be thought fit to be imposed. But in case any
Master Printer has more employment then he is able to discharge with help of
his Apprentice or Apprentices, it shall be lawful for him to require the help
of any Iourney-man, or Iourneymen-Printers, who are not employed, and if the
said Iourney-man, or Iourneymen-Printers so required, shall refuse employment,
or neglect it when he or they have undertaken it, he, or they shall suffer
imprisonment, and undergo such punishment, as this Court shall think fit.

XXII. Item, The Court does hereby declare, that it does not hereby restrain
the Printers of either of the Universities from taking what number of
Apprentices for their service in printing there, they themselves shall think
fit. Provided always, that the said Printers in the Universities shall employ
all their own Iourney-men within themselves, and not suffer any of their said
Iourney-men to go abroad for employment to the Printers of London (unless upon
occasion some Printers of London desire to employ some extraordinary Workman
o^ Workmen amongst them, without prejudice to their own Iourneymen, who are
Freemen) upon such penalty as the Chancellor of either of the Universities for
the time being, shall think fit to inflict upon the delinquents herein.

XXIII. Item, That no Master-printer shall employ either to work at the Case,
or the Press, or otherwise about his printing, any other person or persons,
then such only as are Freemen, or Apprentices to the Trade or mystery of
Printing, under pain of being disabled for ever after to keep or use any
Press or Printing House, and such further punishment as by this court, or the
high Commission Court respectively, as the several causes shall require, shall
be thought fit to be imposed.

XXIV. Item, The Court does hereby declare their firm resolution, that if any
person or persons, that is not allowed Printer, shall hereafter presume to set
up any Press for printing, or shall work at any such Press, or Set, or
Compose any Letters to be wrought by any such Press; he, or they so
offending, shall from time to time, by the Order of this Court, be set in the
Pillorie, and Whipped through the City of London, and suffer such other
punishment, as this Court shall Order or think fit to inflict upon them, upon
Complaint or proof of such offense or offenses, or shall be otherwise punished,
as the Court of high Commission shall think fit, and is agreeable to their
Commission.

XXV. Item, That for the better discovery of printing in Corners without
license; The Master and Wardens of the Company of Stationers for the time
being, or any two licensed Master-Printers, which shall be appointed by the
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, or Lord B. of London for the time being, shall
have power and authority, to take unto themselves such assistance as they shall
think needful, and to search what houses and shops (and at what time they
shall think fit) especially Printing-houses, and to view what is in printing,
and to call for the license to see whether it be licensed or no, and if not, to
seize upon so much as is printed, together with the several offenders, and to
bring them before the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Lord Bishop of
London for the time being, that they or either of them may take such further
order therein as shall appertain to Justice.

XXVI. Item, The Court does declare, that it shall be lawful also for the said
Searchers, if upon search they find any book or books, or part of book or
books which they suspect to contain matter in it or them, contrary to the
doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, or against the State and
Government, upon such suspicion to seize upon such book or books, or part of
book or books, and to bring it, or them, to the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, or the Lord Bishop of London for the time being, who shall take
such further course therein, as to their Lordships, or either of them shall
seem fit.

XXVII. Item, The Court does order and declare, that there shall be four
Founders of letters for printing allowed, and no more, and does hereby
nominate, allow, and admit these persons, whose names hereafter follow, to the
number of four, to be letter-Founders for the time being (viz.) John Grismand,
Thomas Wright, Arthur Nichols, Alexander Fifeild. And further, the Court does
Order and Decree, that it shall be lawful for the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, or the Lord Bishop of London for the time being, tak^ng unto him or
them, six other high Commissioners, to supply the place or places of these who
are now allowed Founders of letters by this Court, as they shall fall void by
death, censure, or otherwise.

Provided, that they exceed not the number of four, set down by this Court.
And if any person or persons, not being an allowed Founder, shall
notwithstanding take upon him, or them, to Found, or cast letters for printing,
upon complaint and proof made of such offense, or offenses, he, or they so
offending, shall suffer such punishment, as this Court, or the high Commission
court respectively, as the several causes shall require, shall think fit to
inflict upon them.

Apprentices at one time, neither by Copartnership, binding at the Scriueners,
nor any other way whatsoever, neither shall it be lawful for any
Master-Founder, when any Apprentice, or Appentices shall run, or be put away,
to take another Apprentice, or other Apprentices in his, or their place or
places, unless the name, or names of him, or them so gone away, be rased out
of the Hall-booke of the company, whereof the Master-Founder is free, and never
admitted again, upon pain of such punishment, as by this Court, or the high
Commission respectively, as the several Causes shall require, shall be thought
fit to be imposed.

XXIX. Item, That all Iourney-men-Founders be employed by the Master-Founders
of the said trade, and that idle Iourney-men be compelled to work after the
same manner, and upon the same penalties, as in case of the Iourneymen-Printers

persons in any work belonging to the casting or founding of letters, then such

when they are first cast, in which work it shall be lawful for every
Master-Founder, to employ one boy only that is not, nor has been bound to the
trade of Founding letters, but not otherwise, upon pain of being for ever
disabled to use or exercise that art, and such further punishment, as by this
Court, or the high Commission Court respectively, as the several causes shall
require, be thought fit to be imposed.
