A Small ACCOUNT GIVEN FORTH By one that has been a Traveller For these 40
Years in the Good OLD WAY. And as an Encouragement to the Weary to go forward;
I by Experience have found there is a Rest remains for all they that truly
trusts in the Lord.

Psalms 31.14. I trusted in thee, O Lord, and said, thou art my God.

Psalms 31.24. All ye that trust in the Lord, be strong, he shall establish
your Hearts.

Printed in the Year School.

AS God by his Grace having inclined my Heart to be Merciful, and I have had
the Comfort of doing Good; whilst I had an opportunity, in the things as he in
this Life is pleased to commit to my Care: I have, as in his sight, walked in
the uprightness of my Heart, and as in those things partaining to this Life, I
have endeavored to keep a good Conscience. So in Love to all that may have the
Reading of this small Book, I am willing to give them an understanding, as I
have found where it is to be attained; as Christ said, There is but one good,
and that is God; and as we come be guided by his good Spirit, it will lead us
into all things that are good; without which we cannot inherit Eternal Life.
And whatever any may think of me, who look with an evil Eye, yet to my Friends
that looks with an Impartial Eye, it will be received, as it is intended good
will to all; and to those remain a Friend.

S. B.

The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.

A good understanding have all those that keep his Law.


AND as a Traveller to the good Land of Rest and Peace, and having in measure
attained thereunto, by that Heavenly Guide Christ Jesus the true Light, that
has been my Instructor and Helper, without which I am nothing, nor can do any
thing as I ought to do; I am made free to relate something of my attainment
thereunto. I was Born of good Parents, Educated according to the Church of
England; and though Young, Zealous therein; yet could not my Immortal Soul be
therewith satisfied, but a desire was begotten in me, to know the true God, the
which to attain I endeavored the best way I could, by Prayer and Fasting in
secret, not to be seen of any: But God, whose Eye saw me, and my true desire
therein; knowing herein I was not safe, tried me, and by one thought which
arose in my Heart concerning God, which I could not help, dashed all my
Building to pieces, and I thought my self the worst Creature living; thus night
and day I had great trouble within, but resolved in the midst of all, and made
it my resolution to follow the thing that is good, and that God that saw me,
though I saw not him; I was by this often comforted, and it became my Song,
Great are the Troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivers out of them all;
and sometimes betwixt Hope and Fear, I traveled from Twelve Years of Age to
Eighteen; about which time, by Providence I was led into the North, at which
time, by wonderful changes wrought in them (by which they had the name given
them) called Quakers, a People so contrary to my Education; and the many
strange Reports, that were raised of them, was rather frightful, than
desirable to me; but that God, that saw the great desire I had to know him,
the only true God, and Jesus Christ his Son, led the blind by a way I knew not,
and by one not called a Quaker, but one true to the Church of England, and a
sufferer for King Charles the first.

I received a true Account of the Principles and good Lives of these People,
which in Simplicity of Heart was related to me, of which I was made seriously
to consider; and in a short time, felt a Power arise in my Heart, and I said
this is it I have waited for, and with great Power it rent the Vail, chased
away my dark thoughts, gave me some understanding of the Scriptures, and I
could say, I have heard of thee, and have read of the Wonders thou did for
the Children of Men; but that was not mine, but now by thy great Power and
Change thou have wrought in me, I came to know thee O God, and by this, and in
no other way can I be satisfied, and that thou the Immortal God, may have
the Glory of thy own good Work, which I never received of Man, neither did I
ever see or hear any of them called Quakers, till three Years after or more,
but returned into my own Country (North-Hampton-shire) to my Relations, and not
long after came to London, and made it my business, and went secretly amongst
all persuasions (except Papists and Ranters) to see if I could find any, that
had the sense to know God, and his Son Jesus Christ within them.

But, I could find no outward thing could give my Soul satisfaction, neither
then, nor now, and in that State I walked alone three Years, but being at a
Meeting in great Allhallows, one Edw. Buroughs came in, and stood up, and
spoke; at which I with others was amazed, having never seen nor heard any of
them before; but was resolved to hear him again; but by the many strange
reports raised of them, I was afraid, but I Prayed to the Lord my God in whom I
trusted, that I might not be deceived, for he knew I had nothing in my Eye, but
to have a further manifestation of Him, whom to know is Life Eternal, of the
which he resolved me, and with Signs and Tokens of his Love, confirmed me, and
I could, and can say it was, and is of God, and is the Truth, and proceeds from
the same Rock, from which all the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, had their
teaching, Christ Jesus the Rock, the Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, is
made known unto us, of which Knowledge I have learned, as they did, who said,
what is to be known of God, is manifest in them, which is the Key of David,
which opens and shuts, and gives the true Understanding of the Mystery of the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the true knowledge to all those, who have in true
Obedience submitted to his Yoke, and their Wills subjected to his Will; these
shall find his saving Virtue of Life, which Life being received, and joined too
with all the Heart, it will endow them with the Heavenly Virtue, in Christ
Jesus our High Priest, and Captain of our Salvation: And with Righteousness,
Peace and Joy, in the Holy Spirit of God, and those that willingly give up all
they have unto him, shall find in it more than they can believe, or the Carnal
Mind can apprehend, for they knew what they said, that the Carnal Mind knows
not the things of God, for they are Spiritually discerned, and to be carnally
minded is Death, but to be spiritually minded is Life and Peace, which is a
certain Truth, and according to the Holy Scriptures, from which I desire
neither from Them, nor my Neighbor to borrow Words, or a Profession; but to
have a right to them, and be made one with them, by the same Spirit of Jesus
Christ, the Lord of all our Mercies; and as in him they lived, moved, and had
their being, who gave them forth, he is so to the faithful this day, and what I
have heard and seen, I declare, that he is the true God, And the Poor in Spirit
receive the Kingdom of Heaven, and see a nothingness and emptiness in
themselves, without a daily supply from him, and they are led and made to
understand the Mystery of Election and Reprobation, as in the two Seeds and
Births, the one elect and blessed of God before the World was; if the mind of
Man joins to Christ, who is God's Elect, Isa. 42. they are saved by him, and
Works out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and this is the Elect and
Cornerstone, Christ Jesus, whom soever Builds thereon, The Gates of Hell shall
not prevail, and will over turn overturn till he come whose right is to Reign;
and as unto this Elect and Precious Seed we Unite, we are therein and thereby
blesed of God; this is not of our selves, but the free Gift given of God, by
which we make our Calling and Election sure, and in this we have learned to
know the Reprobated, and the Enemy of all Mankind, that leads the mind from
God, into the Lust of the Eye, the lust of the Flesh, and the Pride of Life,
and all other Evils, which if joined unto the Evil conceived in the mind brings
Death, and separates Man from God his Maker, and here the strong Man keeps the
House, and by his Temptations therein, prevails on Man to eat the forbidden
Fruit, by which he breaks the Law of God, and falls under Condemnation, from
which State there is no coming; nor the Figg-leaf Garment, nor nothing without
will cover, but a turning to the blessed Appearance and Gift of God in the
Soul, and there find the Mystery, Christ within, the Hope of Glory, who has
many Names, and his Kingdom is compared to a little Leaven, the lost Groat, a
grain of Mustard Seed, and many other Parables, and it is veiled from Man, who
is in the first nature of the Earth, Earthly, but revealed in the second Man,
who is the Lord from Heaven, which gives us to know the first Man Adam a living
Soul, and the last Man Adam a quickening Spirit, by which, unless we be Born
again of the true incorruptible Seed, which enlightens us, we cannot see the
Kingdom of Heaven, nor the Glory thereof, which Man in the first Nature have
strove to know; but we must receive that knowledge by the ingrafted Word of
God, not in our will and time, these things God gives as to know, but being
acquainted with his Mercies, and the Temptations of the evil One, as we may
read and learn of Christ, who left us an example, as all true Travelers shall
find in themselves, him near in their best performances; as I have seen, and do
see his approach, and when I have heard, or seen any on the high Mountains, in
their Imaginations, who pretend they see all the World, and their selves in
conceit above all, for which I have been grieved, as well-knowing the danger of
that State, and willing I was to have advised them, but knowing they was so
highly set up in themselves, my voice could not reach them, calling that God
which is not God, taking the Name of the Lord God in Vain, for which he will
not hold them guiltless, some of them having blown a loud Trumpet, Jehu like,
saying, Come and see my Zeal for the Lord of Hosts, which I have been grieved
to see in some, both Men and Women, and have lived to see diverse fall, which I
well knew as they stood could not hold out to the end, and many of Martha's
Spirit I have seen, and now do, which runs, and serves, and cumbers themselves
with striving to utter Words, and have got the true Notion in their Heads, but
the true Seed has not taken root downwards; and those are they which are
Stumbling Blocks, who have been by some encouraged, as I might have been, but
the Lord my God kept me out of that Temptation, and many others not loving
Hypocricy, nor a feigned imitation whereby I might deceive others, in what I
was not truly to God, who called me to take up the Cross, to that which my
Heart loved, whether they were Idols of Silver, or Gold, or other things though
useful, yet if over-valued they fill the Heart, of which there must be an
emptying, to make room for the Heavenly Jesus, under whose Reign, Israel shall
safely possess their Souls in Peace, and have the new Name given them, and the
White Stone which none knows, nor can believe, but those that have it, and
those are they that are come through great Tribulations, and are washed with
the Blood of the Lamb: and all those of this Faith, I dearly salute, as being
Children of one Father, whose Voice I know from the Voice of a Stranger, and I
thank God, who has raised up the Poor in Spirit, all that are therein
gathered, will out-last all other Notions, and the Lord give Wisdom to them,
that have not as yet thereto attained, to know the true Ministration and the
right Season, when they should, and when they should not, which in some has
been lacking; which causes the weak to stumble, and keeps out more than it
brings in.

Thus have I given a short but true Account as I have passed through the
Wilderness of this World, and have seen many fall on the Right Hand, and on the
Left, where also I might but have had for my preservation, the cloud over me by
day to keep me low, that I might not be exalted, neither by Visions, Sights,
nor Revelations; many have been hurt thereby, and cast that on others, which
concerned themselves: And as the cloud stood over me, it kept me low from
self-exaltation, to know my self nothing, but what I received from the God of
all my Mercies: and as I see the Cloud by day, I also see the Pillar of Fire by
Night, which caused me to stand still, and see the Salvation of God, and the
bright appearance of his Glory. I am sorry for some that are backsliden, and
may say to them, what have you or your Fathers found in the God of Jacob, that
you should depart from him? But let all the strong willed, know little David,
who trusts not in Bow nor Sword, but in the living God; he by his Sling and
smooth Stone, shall hit the Head of those that defies the Armies of Israel's
God.

And to all you workers of Iniquity, who have charged us that we deny Christ
Jesus come in the Flesh, the Holy Scriptures and the Resurrection, and say we
are Heathens, and Heretics, all which we know to be false, and can appeal to
God in the integrity of our Hearts therein, and with him we can with Joy leave
our Cause, as well-knowing he is able in his time to plead it, though there may
be evil doers amongst us. If Christ had one in twelve, that was not enough for
the Jews and some that followed him, to say he was not in the Truth, because
Judas betrayed him, and Peter denied him, and he in that Agony bearing our
griefs, Isa. 53. to cry out, My God my God why have thou forsaken me, all this
must needs stumble the Eye that looked out, but they remembered his promise, and
waited at Jerusalem for the fulfilling of it, who said, he would come, and he
did come, which confirmed them, and so it has done us.

And now something to you my dear Children, whom I never decked in the extremes
of formality, to make my self, or you seem what you were not; but this was, and
is my desire for you, seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteousness
thereof, and all other things shall be added unto you, be sure to Remember your
Creator in the days of your Youth, and you shall find the Comfort of it in your
Old Age, or at your Death, when all the Glory of this World will stand you in
no stead: And though some of you have met with some Disappointments, yet you
shall find (as I have done) all things work together for good, and bring you
nearer to God, which I have ever desired for you, more than for Silver or Gold,
though therein some of you have had a blessing beyond my desire, and my comfort
is, you all set your Faces Sion-ward, and to your Parents have been Dutiful,
Loving and Obedient, for which God will bless you, as you continue in his Grace.

This is written by one that has been called a Dissenting Quaker, which I
desire not to be from faithful Friends, for I never knowingly dissented from
the Truth, but loved it, and though in some things was not satisfied, yet kept
as near as I could in Word and Deed to hurt no one, but endeavored to answer a
good Conscience toward God and all Men, in which I have found him near to help
me, and the blessing to my Soul and Body, and have a true Love to all the
sincere in Heart, by what name soever called.

And as through Dispensations and Administrations and Gifts, (which are all by
the same Spirit) God is pleased to give a further manifestation of Himself, who
is a Spirit, in that way shows Himself to Man as he can receive him, which was,
and is his great Love, knowing how happy he is made by it, and unhappy without
it, and God's great Condescension therein, who seeks Man, before Man seeks Him,
because he is good, and would have Us be like unto Him, and take delight in Us,
and we in Him: and in this way he led all his faithful People, before the Law
and after, which Law was given by Moses by Divine Inspiration, many Years after
some of those things were done, which all had their signification, and pointed
at Christ Jesus coming in the Flesh, who, when come, said, before Abraham was I
am, and they in the Wilderness drank of the same Spiritual Rock, which Rock is
Christ, the Messenger of God and of the New Covenant, the Law written in the
Heart, unto Him must all come, that will truly know the Interpretation of
what is contained in both Old and New Testament, which was declared from the
Spirit and Power of God in the true Seed, and that were left to be profitable,
especially to the Man of God, through Faith in Christ Jesus, by which we may
see (as our Minds are turned to God) the Examples of those that followed the
Lord their God, and there make a true spiritual Application, and see how far we
are come into the good work of God, in the proving of our Hearts; as Abraham
Offered up Isaac, so must every one offer up what God requires, to manifest our
love to God; and for all such who by Faith walk, God will provide himself a
Sacrifice; and so Jacob the wrestler with God, sent from his Father's House to
go into a strange Land, and have no dependency on any outward or visible thing
in this his Journey, yet Travels on, and the Sun sets, night comes on, on this
Stone lays his head, and thus rests on the faithfulness of God to him in all
conditions, and then is the ladder of true experience seen, where the Angels of
God ascend, and descend, at the foot abode, and you will say God was here and I
knew it not; and here Jacob received his blessing, to whom Children was given,
and there was a striving, as by the best Mind and Spirit, you shall find the
eldest by Nature will seek to rule, and strive against the beloved of the
Father: And Joseph the true born Son sold into Egypt, to provide Corn for Jacob
and his Sons, but they must go down to fetch it; and this is to be known in its
time and season, and the Scripture fulfilled, and the spiritual meaning therein
known: As Saul the first King over Israel, for stature and appearance
Beautiful, anointed of the Prophet to be King; but God saw beyond outward
appearances into the Heart, and they that go out from God their strength, their
defense is gone, and they shall become weak as Soul did, and their Enemies
prevail; then contemtible David, who by his Brethren despised, him God saw, and
by the Arm of God's strength had killed the Lion and the Bear, and in that
Power by which he overcame the Latter, by believing in the same Power he
overcame the greatest of his Enemies, and this made him King in Readiness stead,
though with him he had long Wars to Fight the Lord's Battle: but Solomon by the
true Wisdom of God must Build the House, in whose Reign there is Peace and
Safety, and he shall Judge and give true Judgment betwixt the Mother and the
Child; and Christ's Kingdom (Typified in Solomon's) consists of Righteousness,
Peace and Joy, which is very delightful and desirous, because, the satisfaction
the Soul receives thereby, and has a true sight of the Love of God in all he
does, is but to make his Creature Man happy, which Love is so great it cannot
be expressed, for the which, all those that have received it praise God, and
all that have not come out of themselves, and seek the Kingdom of Christ, not
in words, but in Truth, that they may partake with thy Saints in Glory, and
thereby see the Emptiness and Vanity of this World, whether it be Profession,
Pleasure, Riches, Honor; the Excellency of this Excels them all.

And to all you sincere hearted, as Cornelius was, to whom Peter was sent, who
said, I see of a Truth, God is no respecter of Persons; but amongst all that
truly fears God, and works Righteousness, are therein accepted, yet God was
pleased by Peter, to Preach and Testify unto Jesus Christ as his anointed, who
was crucified, and to his Resurection from the Dead, Acts 10. that in and
through him they might believe, and receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost and of
Power, and thereby the inward cleansing from Sin and Pollution, and by the
Power and Work of Christ, to become the Sons of God, which no outward thing can
do; but whosoever therein believes, shall find Power in that Gift which God has
given, which is a true discerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart, to
which, I would persuade all that are weary and heavy laden to come unto, and
they shall assuredly find Rest to their Souls, by Christ Jesus the Substance,
unto which all Men must bow in the inwardness of their Hearts, for the day of
his bright Appearance is at hand; and Behold he comes with Clouds, Rev. 1.7.
yet they that are gazing abroad, cannot see him, being veiled from that Eye and
Mind, as he was unknown to the Jews formerly, who had a great expectation of
the coming of the Messiah, who came in the will of God at the appointed time;
yet he not coming in that Glory, and great Appearances they expected him, they
could not believe nor think that it was he, and now there is great expectation
in some of his second appearance, some saying, Lo here, and some Lo there, and
yet still are disappointed, and strangers to his appearance in Spirit: but to
them who truly look for him, he shall appear the second time without Sin, unto
Salvation, and there the true inward Christians shall see him in his Glory, and
enter into his Kingdom, which exceeds all the glory of this World, neither can
the wise imaginary part in Man give a true description thereof, but as God's
Wisdom rises up into the Throne, and has the Government of the Mind, they
shall know the depth of these things from him that gives it; and give him the
Praise, who has brought them into so happy estate, who desires well for every
Creature, both Man and Beast, who groans for deliverance: And as a Man comes to
be gathered into the light, and changed into the Nature of Jesus Christ, the
whole Creation will reap great benefit thereby, and as many as have seen the
beginning of the good Work of God in what he did, He divided the Light from the
Darkness, and saw the Light, and it was Good; and so he went on in every day's
Work, till the whole Creation was finished; and as we read in the Old, we must
find it in the New, for he says, I will make a new Heaven, and a new Earth,
wherein shall dwell Righteousness. And as in the first, he went on in order in
his Work, so you shall find him now; and though by him called into the
Vineyard to work, it shall find in many a high and strong will, which would
obstruct the good Work of God, and that Hammon like gets upon the Kings Horse,
but he is not Mordica, that sits low in sackcloth at the gate, and where this
is, in what pretense so ever, in whom Pride rises and prevails, it will (if
suffered) destroy the Seed of the Jews; but he that sees in secret will reveal
the matter, and that Spirit shall be brought down, let its clothing be never
so glorious: God has decreed to exalt Mordicai, who is of the true Seed, he is
found worthy, and the Lord lives; he shall Reign whose Right it is, though the
Heathen rage, and the People imagine a vain thing, yet will he set his Son upon
the holy hill of Sion.

I could not well omit one thing more, to give satisfaction to some, who may
think, I am one that goes under the name that ministers to the People, but I am
not; but this I give as my experience, to all that are traveling to find rest
with God in his Kingdom of Peace; but to appear in a Public Assembly, there to
speak, I never did; and I am of the Apostle's mind, Let such Women (as want
Instruction, or would usurp Authority over the Man) keep Silence in the
Church, and give place to Man, to whom God has given Preheminency, and made
fit for that great Work; in which Work, had not I satisfaction in my self, and
been strengthened by those worthy good Ministers, through the weakness of some
others who thereto pretend, and, as I well know, run when they are not sent, I
might have stumbled; but I saw, how ever Justified by others, diverse of them
were not, nor are not upon the right Ground, and some of them have been blown
away like Chaff with the Wind, not but that I know there is many Good and
Virtuous Women, who are appointed for good Examples in their Families, who in
Modesty, Sobriety, Charity, and good Works, a good Life, and Conversation; with
these I join, and in that Life I desire to Preach to my Children, Friends,
Neighbors and Servants; and they that in this rightness of Heart Live, shall
deceive none, but gain to themselves a lasting Establishment, which shall be of
good Savor, never to be repented of; and as in this I desire to do unto all as
I would be done unto, and that in Truth and Sincerity I have here writ, may be
for the good of all; to help the Feeble, and strengthen the Weak, and that from
the ground of Integrity, and in Good Will to all Men; and it being received in
the good Mind, will cover any Weakness herein contained, and make that use of
it as it is intended, Good Will to all, and Glory to God. Yet as there was
formerly, so there is now, he that is born after the Flesh, Persecutes him that
is born after the Spirit, whose Censures I expect not to escape, it being so
natural to the Litteral Jews, when they could find nothing to accuse Christ of,
whilst upon the Earth, sought what they could to entrap him in his Words; but
God gave him that Wisdom to see in them, and cautioned his Disciples, not to
give the Childrens Bread to Dogs, nor Pearls to Swine, least they trample them
under Foot, and turn again and Rent you; under Christ's Protection I leave my
self.

This writ by one that has waited at Wisdom's Gate for Instruction, who has
given me an entrance to know as I have here declared, and all that would go
higher to see the Bride, the Lambs Wife, must be guided thereto by the Meek and
Humble Spirit of Jesus, without which there is no Safety, though they may
understand all Mysteries, and give much to the Poor, and have all those Gifts
the Apostle mentions (in the 13 of the 1. Epistle to the Corinthians) and yet
if the most excelent gift of Charity be wanting that thinks no Evil, which
boasts not, etc. but Suffers, Believes, Hops, and Endures all Things,
and rejoices in God alone, he that is here will out-last all other let their
pretenses be what it will, and they that come not here let them change their
Habits, their Customs, and as some call it the Worlds Fashions, yet if they
come not to see the World's Covetousness (unto which the Heart of Man is
naturally inclined) rooted out, the Earth will open and swallow up that Mind,
and the Heart will be dead to God, and they will loose their part in the
blessed Inheritance.

Some on the other hand notwithstanding they may have seen the good way, set
forward therein, but soon forgot what the Lord did for them, who brought them
out of the Land of Darkness, from under their hard Taskmastrrs, who put them to
make Brick without Straw; their Hearts not being thoroughly Converted, they
lusted for the Garlic and Onions again, their old Diet; and though they had
past the Sea, many dyed in the Wilderness, and all them that delighted in the
Sins of Sodom, and make a mock at the good Angel, that God has sent to pull
just Lot out of Sodom, they shall be struck Blind, and the Fire of God's Wrath
shall destroy all such that come not in at the right Door of him who said, I am
the Way, the Truth, the Life, and the Light; who ever striveth by any other way
will be found Theives and Robbers, and deprive the Soul of its In heritance
with God.

This by one who for many Years has been counted a Dissenter, being never
forward to intrude into those things I had not seen nor adhered to, what I had
not a clear sight as my duty to God, and there I stand still waiting on God to
reveal to me; yet that God that sees the inside, the Heart, has rewarded me
according to the sincerity thereof; and I have found his Love so great and
unexpressible, which has made up all again more than I have lost by any Man,
and has safely preserved where Man could not see me, whose Eye is abroad and
looks at the outside appearance; but as God's Eye, who beholds both Evil and
Good, so have I seen in both Parties things acted and done, which my Soul had
no Pleasure nor Unity with, but was willing the Lord should bring me off from
those from whom he was departed, and that the sincere hearted of both sides
might be Reconciled, for the accomplishing of which I have used my best
Endeavors, desiring there may not be a looking at what is past, but an
endeavoring for the good of all, as I have really done, as may be seen in this
following Letter, which I writ in answer to a Friend, who was and is
dissatisfied with some for appearing therein; but let thembe what they please,
I am well satisfied in this good Work.

But I have seen the new Wine put into the old Bottle, it not being well
seasoned there becomes a Sowerness, and the good Relish thereby seems to be
lost, that is in it self good; in which state there is many that keeps to the
old Leaven of the Pharisees; Christ gives this Mark by which they should be
known, They love the uppermost Places, and to be Master, make long Prayers, and
to preach in their own Wills, different in their Robes, makes a fair show in
the Flesh, that they may appear well unto Men; this has been and is a great
grief to the Just, but I am comforted in this, I see many right-hearted and
good Christians, who speaks from the Truth the anointed of God, those God will
bless, and he will appear in them who reigns in Righteousness, and all such
shall reign with him for ever and ever; and as I have seen this Good, I have
also seen this Evil, which Man is prone to, and apt to set a great value upon
themselves, and they not see it, and let the Truth be never so plainly
discovered, and from the Spirit of the Living God dictated; yet if it comes not
in their way, and after their manner, as they have set it up in themselves,
there is no room for any thing to enter, though never so good; of this I have
made to my self a good Caution, and said, O Lord if this Iniquity remains in
me, search it out; for I see it looks ill in others, and so it will in me if I
am found therein.

S. B.

How mean soever I may appear to Man,
A Witness in my Soul there lives that can,
Bear Record to the Father this, that I
Seek not Mortals praise, but Immortality;
That Crown of Rest and Peace I may receive,
Which Mortals have not in their Power to give;
Which he must do who sets me free from Sin,
And being clean in Peace there Rules that King,
Who will not join unto Iniquity,
But love's Vprightness and Integrity.
Thinks Human Wisdom, I can easily see,
The Scripture can this thing declare to me;
But it is not known by Pleasure, Ease or Sleep,
Who find this Pearl, must dig low and deep;
And who finds before it be his own,
They must sell all to purchase that alone,
And cast up all his Stock and look within,
Before to Build this House he does begin,
And learn by true experience rightly for to know,
The thing that is realy good from what is but good in show
Remember Babel, do not build too High,
Nor make a Tower to reach unto the Sky,
Nor look thou out, but turn thy Eye within,
See Christ there laid, then build thy House on him.
Who build not on that Rock shall surely fall,
For he is that Corner Stone uniteth all.
Cease then a while you Humane Learned Men,
That know your Wisdom cannot find out him.
Thou Willing and Obedient, know it is thee,
Whose Vale is rent to see this Mystery,
It Is not the prudent learned Wit that shall
Him comprehend who is the Light of all,
The Lamb of God, who comes in love to gain
And bring lost Man (strayed from God) back again;
And make Man happy, the greatest good that can
Befall to Mortals, or the Sons of Men;
Which if not rightly known, what e're we do
Wants the good Oil, and God's acceptance too.
He sees the Heart and what rules there full well,
Whether it be Pride or Passion, Husk, Fame or Shell;
Of all that cumber we must come to see,
Man stripped of all and Christ alone to be
The true conducter, from the ways wherein
He Will not appear, because they lead from him;
And all that goes in this true blessed way,
Shall by his Light be saved both Night and Day.
And as I have walked unseen and all alone,
In secret to my God I made my moan.
Its restless eye that makes complaint to none,
But unto thee from whom relief must come;
Out of my Troubles, Doubts and Fears,
And send the Harvest which was sown in Tears;
Though sorrow may endure for a Night,
Thy morning Presence brings my Soul delight;
Thou art a God of Truth, in all things Just,
And those that know thy Name will in thee Trust.
An Answer to a Letter from a Friend.
THine I received, and have considered thereof, and could have been more large
in my own, and my Friends Vindication therein concerned; but am gathered into
that, not to strive, but to commit my Cause to God in well-doing; having in my
self, and many others, seen Pride to beget Passion, and Passion Prejudice, by
which the Eye of the right understanding is made Blind: As for rehearsal of all
those former sailings therein contained, if they were true, yet rightly
considered, and impartially weighed; may say, since those Divisions, a great
manifestation there has been of such Spirits, to whom those names may
deservedly be attributed; though for many Years I have been counted a Dissenter,
Yet I, nor many more, never took pleasure to lay the Nakedness of any open, but
rather to cover for his Names sake, who has kept us in his Truth, by which we
have been preserved.

I have seen, I have seen, an Enemy enter the House, and has not been
discovered till they come into the Cool, out of the Hurry and Noise, and hear
the call of the still Voice; and herein my Soul, with many other of my
Christian Friends, have been Blessed; and by this we are led to Unite, and to
be truly reconciled in that Spirit, by that Heavenly Jesus, that true
Reconciler of Man to his Maker.

And of this, from thy true Friend, be assured, it was not from the Spirit of
Hypocrisy, Policy, or any carnal or selfish End, no, no, our House is not
Built on that Sandy Foundation, but on Christ Jesus, that Rock of Ages, which
leads his in the way of Everlasting Peace, which Peace cannot be declared, but
as it is felt, of which Peace has my Soul tasted largely, and can say truly,
since into this happy state the Lord has brought me, I have experienced more
of that Heavenly Joy, and Everlasting Peace, than ever I knew before, but I
thank the Lord who gave me a share thereof, under every dispensation he has
led me through, and can say, they were all good in their time, but this
excels them all, well knowing the Administration of John to be Glorious in
its Time, yet, He that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he;
into which Kingdom, that thou may have an entrance after all thy Travels,
and come into this Sabbath and Rest with God, will be a true Joy to thy Friend,
of which I can say, with many more of my dear Friends whom I know not, but as I
feel them in this Spirit, It is the Way and there is not another: And for all
those that are other wise-minded, the Lord sned a Famine to come on the outward
Knowledge, that they may know to be led to the Spiritual Joseph; whoever comes
unto him, (...) upbraideth no one with what is past, but receives them with his
Love, and embraces them, and they partake with him of the Fatness of the good
Land. Of this I am a witness, and remain

Thy True Friend, S. B.
AS to a Fast, I desire this may be solemnly proclaimed; a Fast from Strife,
Malice and every evil Work, as new Born Babes desire the sincere Milk of the
Word of Life, and grow thereby, in which we shall be accepted of God, and truly
reconciled to one another.

Postscript.
I Did not intend to have Printed this Letter I sent to a Friend, but finding
he has Printed the Letter he sent to me, as an Answer to W. R's Book I sent
him, which Book I had good Unity with, and with all that are of a reconciling
Spirit, which to my Comfort, I find many sincere hearted therein, and as the
vail of Prejudice comes to be taken of the Heart, we shall see one another as
God sees us, to whom I approve my Heart, let Men Judge of me as they please;
it is not from any Evil or Insinuating self-end, I can truly say for my self,
and many more true Christian Friends, whose Hearts in this matter of
Reconciliation is not to gain Praise of Men, God is our witness; but we are led
to Unite by that blessed Spirit, who has showed us of what and in what the
Kingdom of Heaven consists, of which is true Righteousness, Joy and Peace in
the holy Spirit, which I with many more have tasted, and could be glad all that
oppose would come and taste and see how good the Lord is, and with what the
Immortal Soul is Refreshed.

I could never find satisfaction in any visible thing, till I received the Word
of God, in which Word I find the Key of David, Which opens and none can shut,
and shuts and none can open; and that is that, that opens the Mystery of the
Kingdom of God, in which the Father, Son and Spirit is to be koown; which Word
of Faith, gave the true understanding to the Prophets and Apostles, and to all
the Faithful of God to this day: And in that way which some call Heresy,
Worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all the Law and the Prophets, and in
Jesus Christ, who is the Author and Finisher of our Faith.

S. B.

O Lord! Out of the deep I cried unto thee, and thou pluckedst my feet out of
the Mire and Clay, and have set them in the right way: And being converted,
strengthen my Brethren. Unto which I have this further to add, when I first
heard the confused noise, made by G. K. and T. B. which appearance was, and is
to me like the Golden Calf; and beholding many I knew, which I thought had been
more grafted in the Word of Life, than to go after it, for which I was greatly
troubled, but the heavenly still Voice gave me this Satisfaction, fret not thy
self, be still, it is a Cloud I suffer, the Wind thereof shall blow away the
Chaff, but I will gather my Wheat thereby nearer together; and this I know to
be a certain Truth, by which my Heart has been often refreshed, for which my
Soul, Praise thou the Lord.

S. B.

And unto all those who have raked up the miscarriages and evils, and printed
it, and given it abroad to defame the People called Quakers, whose Principles
shall out-last their Malice; and was some of us of their Spirit, to render evil
for evil, revileing for revileing, might say that of some of them that would
cause shame, who covered their foolish actions with the name of the Lord, but
it was, and is such a Lord, of which there is many, but not the true God as
some can witness, but covered it from Men, hopeing time might work them to see
their weakness, and know the true Lord overruling all their false
Imaginations, who may be truly compared to Saul, when gone from the true God,
he goes to the Witch of Endor, and she raised up what he would see, but not
what he should see; so he was never the better for it, but his Enemies
prevailed, and he fell by his own Sword; so shall envy slay the wicked Man; and
they in darkness shall grope for the door, but shall not find it: All this is
true, and I own before all Men the Principle of the Quakers. And have this to
say for my self, and many more I well know, however our Enemies may render us;
we know this by our selves, and our Consciences bears us vvitness, we have
in good Conversation vvalked before God and Men, which will speak for us in
the gates of our Enemies; and we find the answer of a good Conscience a
continual Feast, who have not received the Truth by observation, but by the
true administration, by which we have learned what lets into the Kingdom of
our God, and what keeps out, let Men's pretenses be what they will; they that
makes lies there refuge, and takes away Men's good names, shall be found
workers of Iniquity.

I having in this small account hinted of many States, and several ways of the
Lord's working in Man, that he may come to know him, and on him rely in all
estates. I have one thing further to add; I have lately seen an exercise at
hand, but when or in what I know not, but leave it to God and his appointed
time, let it be in Mercy or in Judgment, I believe all is for good, as I have
ever found all his dealings to me, it was unpleasant to the fleshly part, but I
turned in, and saw God's preservation near to all that truly on him relies; and
in nothing else was there safety, and therefore I desire all to draw their
minds from Vanity and consider their latter end, that it may go well with them,
what change so ever comes; for the glory of this World passes away, therefore
Work while the Day lasts, for the Night comes wherein no Man can Work: I have
also by my experience learned that in Sights and Visions, without watchfulness,
there is a Temptation near, there being a readiness in Man to cast that on
others, which God intends for our selves, if we could patiently wait till the
Vision speaks; for want of that many have run fiercely into things without,
and have failed, and have brought Reproach on themselves, and God not glorified
thereby: this I have also seen, and is often before me, and as there is no
outward thing I more truly rejoiced in than to hear the Faithful Ministers of
Jesus Christ, in the which I am Comforted, that God has given such a
manifestation of his Heavenly good Spirit to instruct his People in the Right
and Everlasting Way, which God will Establish in the Earth; though I could be
glad for the sake of many who take offense and are kept back, because it is
very discernable, Martha's Spirit speaks when they had better be Silent, goes
hastily forward, but would find a greater gain in themselves, if they learned
to obey, and stand still and see the Salvation of God; such may be angry that
others rise not up and serve after their manner, but Jesus that rightly knows
the Spirits of all, saw Mary sit at his Feet, low in her self, she chose the
better Part, which shall never be taken away, and the Seed lown in that good
Ground shall bring forth Fruit to the Lord of the Harvest; but there is several
sorts of Ground in which the good Seed is sown, and there are many
Obstructions in the Ground which hinder the Prosperity of Gods holy and good
Seed; but the Harvest will come, and the good Husbandman will discern the
Tares from the Wheat, which none else can do, there being such a likeness; the
Administration of John was Glorious, in its time, but he said, Behold the Lamb
of God, that takes away the Sins of the World, shall be preferred before and
above all appearances, be they what they will, here many that are Last shall
be First, and the First Last: these are Christ's own Words, and are certainly
true, and believed by one who vvishes well to all.

S. B.

I being encouraged by the Immortal God to Print this, and the matter contained
therein, and gave it to several Friends; and it coming into the hand of T. C.
he came to me, and asked me, Whether I meant George Keith? To whom I replied, I
did; who made this Application, because he Preached up the Man Christ Jesus;
therefore he said, I made him the Golden Calf; and so he reported it: And to
all that shall hear this Report, I have this to say, and take Almighty God to
be my Witness, I do believe Jesus of Nazareth, Born at Bethlehem, according to
God's Divine Appointment, to be the Eternal Son of God, and all those things to
be true, as the Scriptures declare of him, and have received so great a benefit
by him, as my Tongue cannot express; and for this false Aspersion and wrong
Interpretation of T. C. I leave God to plead my Cause, whom I know is able, and
in his time will do it; but must say, as I have once before, He that is born
after the Flesh Persecutes Him that is born after the Spirit.

FINIS.
