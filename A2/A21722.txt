By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty considering that the great and horrrible
conspiracies, treasons, and rebellions lately practiced, attempted, and with
open action prosecuted in the north parts of her highnesses Realm by the
Earls of Northumberlande and Westmerlande, and others their confederates,
contrary to the commandment of Almighty God, and their duties of allegeaunce
to their natural and most undoubted Sovereign Lady and Queen, and to the
great disturbyng of the common quiet and peace of this Realm of England, their
native country, be by the great goodness of Almighty God, her Majesty's
great providence, and the faithful service of her true and loyal subjects,
discovered, frustrated, and utterly suppressed. And understanding by her right
trusty and right well-beloved cousin the Earl of Sussex, her Majesty's
lieftenaunt general of those north parts, that sundry of the meaner sort of
such as did forciably and rebelliously assist the said rebellious Earls in
their traiterous attemptes, have by the marshall law suffered pains of death
according to their just deserts, and to the terror and example of others, and
that great numbers of her Majesty's common people that were like offenders in
that rebellion, do earnestly repent, and be grievously sorry for their heinous
offenses past, and do bewail and lament their unhappy and miserable estate,
and be fully persuaded and earnestly bent to be from henceforth faithful,
loyal, and dutiful subjects to her Majesty, if it might please her
highness of her royal clemency to grant to them their lives and her
gracious pardon for their offenses past, and to receive them to her grace, in
such sort as may best please her Majesty, for the which they will acknowledge
themselves bound to her Majesty, as her true and natural subjects, and as
persons that have received their lives and beinges from her highness as the
minister of Almighty God, for the which they be bound by double band to
serve her Majesty faithfully and truly during the continuance of their lives
to come, and to spend in her service that which from her clemency they have
received. Like as when her Majesty looks upon their grievous offenses and
detestable actions practiced and executed in this rebellion against her
Majesty, having never given to them or any other of her subjects (as is well
known) any occasion to neglect their duties in such sort as they have done,
she is by their unnatural dealinges moved to think every of them unworthy to
receive any drop of her mercy and grace: So her most excellent Majesty
nevertheless laying apart that rigor whereunto they have justly provoked her,
and followyng that natural inclination that she has ever been disposed unto
in showing of mercy, and hoping there with upon report made to her highness,
that the common sort of her subjects lately in this rebellion, do in deed
see how wikkedly they have been seduced, and do know and repent from the
bottom of their hearts their offenses toward God and her Majesty, and will
from henceforth be faithful and true subjects to her Majesty: does by this
her Majesty's Proclamation, grant and give her free pardon of life to all and
every such of her subjects within the Counties of York, Durisme,
Northumberlande, Cumberlande, and Westmerland, who neither has at this
present, nor heretofore has had any lands, tenementes, or hereditamentes of
any estate of inheritance, and that they, and every of them, as above is said,
shall remain and continue without any arrest, vexation or disturbaunce to be
done by any of her Majesty's officers, and ministers, or any other person to
their bodies or goods, so that every such subject do repair to the said
Earl of Sussex her Majesty's Liefetenuant, and other her highnesses
Commissioners appointed for those causes, within forty days next after the
publication hereof, and do submit himself to all such orders and directions
as by the said Commissioners shall be appointed. Whereupon every such subject
shall receive a note in writting under the hands of the said liefetenaunt and
other the said Commissioners, or three of them, testifying his submission,
which shall be a sufficient waraunt to the Lord keeper of the great seal of
England for passing of his pardon under the great seal, without any further
special byll or warraunt to be obtained for the same from her Majesty, so as
he do sue out the same within three months after the date of the same note.

Provided always, that this her Majesty's pardon do not extend to any person
now out of the Realm, or in prison, or committed to the custody of any
person, or delivered upon bail, promise, or other to appear at any day or
time: nor to any person that has had (as above is said) any lands tenementes,
or hereditaments, of any state of inheritance.

Given at our honor of Hampton Court the xviii. day of February, in the year
of our Lord God. 1569. and in the twelfth year of our Reign.

God save the Queen.
