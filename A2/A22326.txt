By the King.
A Proclamation against Seditious, Popish, and Puritanicall Books and
Pamphlets.
FOR that the printing, importing, and dispersing of Popish and seditious
Books and Pamphlets, and seditious Puritanicall Books and Pamphlets,
scandalous to Our person, or State, such as have been lately vented by some
Puritanicall spirits, is grown so common, and practiced so licentiously, both
to the traduting of Religion, and the State, as that great inconueniencies may
grow thereby, if they be not prevented and punished: Therefore, We do straightly
charge and command, That from henceforth no person or persons Whatsoever,
presume to print any Book or Pamphlet, touching, or concerning matters of
Religion, Church government, or State, within any Our own Dominions, which
shall not first be perused, corrected, and allowed, under the hand of the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London,
the Vicechancelour of one of the Universities, of Oxford, or Cambridge, for the
time being, or one of them, or of some other learned person or persons, to that
purpose appointed by them, or one of them; And that no Merchant, or other
person whatsoever, from henceforth presume to import, or bring into this
Kingdom any such Book or Pamphlet, and set, or offer the same to sale, or
otherwise dispose thereof, before the same be first perused and allowed by the
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Archbishop of York, or Bishop of
London, for the time being, or by some other learned person or pesons, to that
purpose appointed by them, or one of them, who shall testify their allowance
thereof, under his or their hands: And that no Booke-binder, or Booke-seller,
or other person whatsoever, shall from henceforth presume to sell, or offer to
sell, or otherwise disperse or dispose any such Book or Pamphlet, not so
perused and allowed, upon pain of Our high displeasure and such other severe
punishment, as by Our Laws, or by Our Prerogative Royal, can, or may be
inflicted upon them for such their contempt. And We do straightly charge and
command all Majors, Justices of the Peace, Shiriffes, and all other Our
officers and ministers whatsoever, and all other Our loving Subjects, whom it
shall, or may appertain, and especially the Master and Wardens of the Company
of Stationers of London, that from time to time they do their utmost
endeavors, for the due observance of the Premises, and for the discovery and
searching out of all Offenses and Offenders against this Our Royal command.

Given at Our Court at Nottingham the fifteenth day of August, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXIIII.
