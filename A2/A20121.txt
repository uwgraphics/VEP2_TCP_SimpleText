A joyful new Ballad, declaring the happy obtaining of the great Galleazzo,
Wherein Don Pietro de Valdez Was the chiese, through the mighty power and
providence of God, being a special token of his gracious and fatherly goodness
toward us, to the great encouragement of all those that willingly fight in the
defense of his gospel and our good Queen of England.
To the Tune of Mounseurs Almaigne.


O Noble England,
fall down upon thy knee:
And praise thy God with thankful heart
which still maintains thee.
The foreign forces,
that seeks thy utter spoil:
Shall then through his especial grace
be brought to shameful foil.
With mighty power
they come unto our coast:
To over run our country quite,
they make their brags and boast.
In strength of men
they set their only stay:
But we upon the Lord our God,
will put our trust always.
Great is their number,
of ships upon the sea:
And their provision wonderful,
but Lord thou art our stay.
Their armed soldiers
are many by account:
Their aiders eke in this attempt,
do sundry ways surmount.
The Pope of Rome
with many blessed grains:
To sanctify their bad pretense
bestowed both cost and pains.
But little land,
be not dismaide at all:
The Lord no doubt is on our side,
which soon will work their fall.
In happy hour,
our foes we did discry:
And under sail with gallant wind
as they came passing by.
Which sudden tidings,
to Plymmouth being brought:
Full soon our Lord high Admiral,
for to pursue them sought.
And to his train,
coragiously he said:
Now for the Lord and our good Queen,
to fight be not afraid.
Regard our cause,
and play your parts like men:
The Lord no doubt will prosper us,
in all our actions then.
This great Galleazzo,
which was so huge and hye:
That like a bulwark on the sea,
did seem to each man's eye.
There was it taken,
unto our great relief:
And diverse Nobles in which train
Don Pietro was the chief.
Strong was she sluft,
with Cannons great and small:
And other instruments of war,
which we obtained all.
A certain sign,
of good success we trust:
That God will overthrow the rest,
as he has done the first.
Then did our Navy,
pursue the rest amain:
With roaring noise of Cannons great*
till they near Callice came:
With manly courage,
they followed them so fast:
Another mighty Gallion,
did seem to yield at last.
And in distress,
for saueg^^d of their lives:
A flag of truce they did hang out,
with many mournful cries:
Which when our men,
did perfectly epsy:
Some little Barks they sent to her,
to board her quietly.
But these false Spaniards,
esteeming them but weak:
When they within their danger came,
their malice forth did break.
With charged Cannons,
they laid about them then:
For to destroy those proper Barks,
and all their valiant men.
Which when our men,
perceived so to be:
Like Lions fierce they forward went,
to quite this injury.
And bourding them,
with strong and mighty hand:
They killed the men until their Arc,
did sink in Callice sand.
The chiefest Captain,
of this Gallion so hie:
Don Hugo de Moncaldo he,
within this fight did die.
Who was the General,
of all the Gallions great:
But through his brains with pouders force,
a Bullet strong did beat.
And many more,
by sword did loose their breath:
And many more within the sea,
did swim and took their death.
There might you see,
the salt and feming flood:
Died and staind like scarlet red,
with store of Spanish blood.
This mighty vessel,
was threescore yards in length:
Most wonderful to each man's eye,
for making and for strength.
In her was placed,
an hundredth Cannons great:
And mightily provided eke,
with bread-corne wine and meat.
There was of Oats,
two hundredth I ween:
Threescore foot and twelve in length,
well measured to be seen.
And yet subdued,
with many others more:
And not a Ship of ours lost,
the Lord be thankt therefore.
Our pleasant country,
so fruitful and so fair:
They do intend by deadly war*
to make both poor and bare.
Our towns and cities,
to rack and sack likewise:
To kill and murder man and wife,
as malice does arise.
And to deflower
our virgins in our sight:
And in the cradle cruelly
the tender babe to smite.
Gods holy truth,
they mean for to cast down:
And to deprive our noble Queen,
both of her life and crown.
Our wealth and riches,
which we enjoyed long:
They do appoint their pray and spoil,
by cruelty and wrong.
To set our houses
a fire on our heads:
And cursedly to cut our throats,
as we lie in our beds.
Our childrens brains,
to dash against the ground:
And from the earth our memory,
for ever to confound.
To charge our joy,
to grief and mourning sad:
And never more to see the days,
of pleasure we have had.
But God almighty
be blessed evermore:
Who does encourage Englishmen,
to beat them from our shore.
With roaring Cannons,
their hasty steps to stay:
And with the force of thundering shot
to make them fly away.
Who ma^e account,
before this time or day:
Against the walls of fair London,
their banners to display.
But their intent,
the Lord will bring to naught:
If faithfully we call and cry,
for succor as we ought.
And you dear brethren,
which bears Arms this day:
For safegarde of your native soil,
mark well what I shall say.
Regard your duties,
think on your countries good:
And fear not in defense thereof,
to spend your dearest blood.
Our gracious Queen
does greet you every one:
And says she will among you be,
in every bitter storm.
Desiring you,
true English hearts to bear:
To God, and her, and to the land*
wherein you nursed were.
Lord God almighty,
which has the hearts in hand:
Of every person to dispose
defend this English land.
Bless thou our Sovereign
with long and happy life:
Indue her Council with thy grace,
and end this mortal strife.
Give to the rest,
of Commons more and less:
Loving hearts, obedient minds,
and perfect faithfulness.
That they and we,
and all with one accord:
On Sion hill may sing the praise,
of our most mighty Lord.
FINIS.
