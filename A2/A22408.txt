A Proclamation prohibiting the publishing, dispersing and reading of a
Declaration or Remonstrance, drawn by some Committees of the Commons-House of
the late dissolved Parliament, and intended to have been preferred by them to
his MAJESTY.
HIs most Excellent Majesty, taking knowledge of a Declaration or
Remonstrance, drawn and penned by some Committees of the Commons House of the
late dissolved Parliament, and intended to have been preferred by them to His
Majesty, wherein are contained many things, which tend much to the dishonor
of His now Majesty, and of His late Majesty, His Royal Father of ever
blessed memory, deceased; and whereby, through the sides of a Peer of this
Realm, they wound the honor of their Sovereigns, Whereof His Majesty being
sensible, has refused to admit the presenting thereof unto Him: And whereas He
understands, that some of the members of that House, ill affected to His
service, to vent their own passions against that Peer, at whom they specially
aimed, and to prepossesse the world with an ill opinion of him, before his
Cause were heard in a Judicial way, whereunto it was referred, have beforehand
willingly and purposely published and scattered Copies of that intended
Declaration or Remonstrance, and thereby have endeavored to detract much from
the reputation of their Sovereign, which in their allegiance to His Highness
ought to have been dear and tender unto them. His Majesty therefore, for the
repressing of such an insufferable wrong unto Himself, which might otherwise
be of ill consequence, Does straightly charge and command, upon pain of His
indignation and high Displeasure, all persons, of what degree, quality, or
condition soever, who have, or at any time hereafter shall have any Copy or
Notes of the said Declaration or Remonstrance, intended to be preferred unto
His Majesty, as aforesaid, or shall come to the view thereof, forthwith, upon
publication of this Our Pleasure, to burn the same, that the memory thereof
may be utterly abolished, and never give occasion to His Majesty, to renew the
remembrance of that, which out of His Grace and Goodness He would gladly
forget: And it at any time hereafter any Copy or Notes of the said
Declaration or Remonstrance shall be found, or known to be in the hands or
custody of any of His subjects, and not burnt, or caused to be burnt by them,
as aforesaid; His Majesty does hereby declare, and publish His Royal Pleasure
and Resolution to be, That He will proceed against all such offenders and
wilful contemners of this His Royal Commandment, with that severity, which
by the Law, or by His Prerogative Royal, He any ways may justly do; and
further, that His Majesty will esteem of all such, as persons ill affected
both to His Person and government.

Given at His Majesty's Palace of Westminster the sixteenth day June, in the
second year of His Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent MAJESTY. M.DC.XXVI.
