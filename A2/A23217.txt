Thus ends the table of this present book.
How a man should behold his estate and degree. Ca. i.
UIdete vocatio^em vfam. These are ye words of the appostle the which does
parteyne to men and women of relygion. Take heed says he / and behold whereto
ye be called. And this says he for to move and stere us to perfeccyo^. And
therefore when soever and as often as I think upon my self / be it by night or
by day I have on the one part great joy / and on ye other great sorrow. Great
joy for the holy relygion / sorrow and confusyon for the feeble conversation.
And it is no marvel / for I have great cause / for this says saint Eusebe
in a sermon. Uenire ad religione ^^^a perfectio est. (...) non perfect viuere
est suma da^pnatio. That is to say. To come to relygyon is a sovereign and
high perfeccyon / but not to live parfytely is a sovereign and high dampnacion.
And therefore you that live in relygyon or in congregacyo^ follow the way of
perfeccyon. And so if ye love your health and will be saved leave / forsake and
despise ye world and all thing in it and belonging to it / and set and put
all your dylygence and power for to live parfytely.

What thing it is to live parfytely and what is the will of god. Ca. ii.
To live parfytely also as saint Bernarde techeth us is to live mekely louyngly
and honorably. Mekely / as to your self. Loui^gly toward your neighbor.
And honorably as toward god / so yt ye set all your heart and mind to do all that is to the pleasure and will of god. That is to have god in every thing
always yt ye think with your heart or speak with your mouth / or do in o^acion
/ by were ke ofony of your.v. wits. As in (...) with your (...) herynge with
your eeres / tastinge with your tongue smelling with your nose / feeling or
touchin ge with your hands / going / standing / sitting or lyenge. Think
always in the beginning whyther it be the will of god or not. And yfit be his
will do it as nygh as ye may to your power. And if it be not do it not / and
though ye should suffer death. But he r^ upon some will ask me what is the
will of god. I say the will of god is nothing but our holiness. For as saint
Poule the apostle says. (...) est volun tas dei. ^ctificatio vestra. It is ye
will of god that ye be holy and saints.

what th^ges makes man a saint / and how a man shall live to the knowledge of
himself in body and soul. Ca. iii.
^wo things without any mo makes man a saint That is to wit / knowledge of
truth / and ye love of goodness. But to ye knowledge of god which is very
and truth may you not come but if first you know your self. Nor to the love
of god which is al goodness and bou^te can you not come without ye love your
neighbor. Than to the knowledge of your self may ye come by often and sweet
medytacio^ / and to the knowledge of god by pure conte^placyon. Now to the
knowledge of your self may ye come in this manner. Think dylyge^tly inwardly
and often what ye be / what ye have been / and what ye shall be / first touch
ynge your body and after as to your soul. As touching your body think yt ye
are fouler tha^ any donge or slyme. ye were en gendred in so great fylthe yt it
is shame to tell it / and abhomynable to think it. For ye were borne in great
fylthe / and ye have led your life in great wretchedness and mysery. And after
your death ye shall be delyuerd to todes and worms and to other foul beestes
which shall devour and ete you. what ye have been and what ye now are ye should
thy^ke as touchige your soul / for what ye shall be ye may not know. Therefore
call to your rem^braunce and think often how ye have done great euylles and
many / and how ye have lost great goods and many. Think also how long ye
have lived / what ye have received / and how ye spent your time for eve ry
hour in which ye thought not on god ye have lo ste. For ye shall give a
rekenyge of every idle word / of all idle and vain thoughts / and of every
idle deed and work. And likewise as ye have not one only here in your heed
but it shall be gloryfyed when ye shall be saved / so shall there escape no hour
of your time but it shall be rekened to you in the mercy of god. O good lord
if all ye world were full of small (...) or (...) who might be so wise to judge
every sperke by it self and to deuyde every one from other; But ye soul is a
thousa^de times greter than ye world / and if the world were a thousand
times gretter than it is. (...) then if ye soul be full of diverse thoughts /
(...) and desires / who may search or inquyre of his heart to know all yt is
in it, or think it. Now behold and t^ ke head my dear sister how ye have
great need to consider and to know your self. Tha^ after take good (...) what
ye be now as touchig yoursoule how ye have little goodness in you / little
understanding or wit little power and pity / for ye always desire that whi che
is not good for you nor profitable. And always ye do for sake and leave yt which
might do you much good. And oftentimes ye be deceived / now by over gretesoro
we / now by (...) love / now by indy serecyon and intemperau^ce / now by
vaynglory / now malycyous and seek / now helthy and merry / now are ye vered
with aduersyte / now lift up with falls hope. On the other side year so mutable
and waver ynge y^ look what thing ye will this day to moro we ye will none of
it. And oftentimes ye languysshe and are angry and sore tormented for many
things that ye coueyte and desire / and than after ye have them at your will:
than are ye incontyuent or by and by of the weary anoyed / and grieved. Think
also on ye other par te how ye are light to be tempted / frail and feeble to
resyst / and ready to consent and agree. Of all these ifyrmytees and wretchedness
has delivered you your spouse and your god Thu^ christ / and does daily
deliver more and more. For when ye were not than he made you in soul to his
own propre symylytude and likeness. And of yt most foul and fylthy thing
of which it is abhomynable to think he made your body and fourmed your wits
and your members so noble and so fair that no man can it better deuyse / nor
none such dyspose and provide. Think also now dylygently and with good
affeccion you which love your carnal and flesshely friends and kynne so
tenderly. where fore love ye them so (...) and so fervently? if ye say that ye
love your (...) and your mother because ye be (...) of their flesh and their
blood. So are the worms that bredeth in them and comes from them daily and
hourly. And on the other side ye have of them neither soul nor body / but ye
have them of god by the. For your fader and mother has brought you forth to
syn^e. what should ye have been if ye had abyden still that which ye had of
your fader and mother when ye were engendered in fylthe and sin of them? On the
other side if ye lo ue your brod or your sister or any other of your kyn^e
because they be of the same flesh and blood yt ye be of. So should ye in
likewise love (...) of yt flesh of your fader or of your mother if it were cut
out of ye bo die of one of them / and that should be great (...) and shame out
of measure. And if ye say yt ye love them because their flesh and image is
fygured to the like nesse of a man and because they have a soul as ye have /
tha^ are your flesshely brother and sister no (...) to you than any other / but
only because yt you and they have one flesshely fader the rote and beginning
of your flesh / the which is a fylthy thing foul and stynkynge. Therefore
love him specially of whom all your beauty comes / and love every man spyritu
ally and goostly. And leave of / fro hensforth to love carnally and flesshely /
for certainly so should ye do.

Of the great benefytes and gifts of our lord god. Ca. iiii.
MOre over if ye think wisely on the great goodness yt our lord god has
done to you ^ daily does and will always more and more if ye love him intyerly
or inwardly. For as I told you in y^ (...) beginning / wha^ ye were not he
made you of naught. And when ye were lost than he found you. And when ye were
in deedly sin sold / than he bought you and redeemed you. And when ye were
dampened than he saved you. And wha^ ye were borne in sin he baptized you. And
afterward when ye syn^ed so foul and so often / than he suffered you gentle
and pacyently / and tarried for you so long. Than after received you so swetely
and has put you and set in his most sweet covent. And every day that ye do
any ill he rebukes you. And wha^ ye do syn^e he does pardon you. When ye err
than he corrects you. And when ye stand in doubt he techeth you. When ye ben
hongry than he fedeth you. And when ye are athyrste he gives you drink. When
ye have cold he warmeth you. When ye be to hot he cools you. When ye wake
he saves you. When ye sleep he conserueth you. When ye rise he susteyneth you.
When ye fall he reyseth you. And when ye sytte than he holds you. When ye
stand than he supporteth you. When ye go than he ledeth you. When ye return
he dyrecteth you. When ye come to him he receives you. And when ye go from him
he does conduyte you. And when ye are out of the way he calls you again.
And ever when ye be seek and evil at ease he comforts you. Lo these great
goods and many other does and has done to you your sweet spouse Jesus In and
with the sweetness of his heart.

How a man should spend his time. Ca. v.
FOr these great goods and many other should ye always think of god / and
speak unto him / and thank him intyerly. Evermore lauding and praysynge him /
and that as well by night as by day / if that ye knew any thing what love
were / or if ye had any love in you. Therefore every morning or at mydnyght
wha^ ye rise out of your bed think incontynently how that many thousa^des
of men has been perysshed that night / and lost both in body and soul. As
some in the fire brenned / and some in the water / some in the sea drowned /
and some on the land in many diverse ways / as robbed / wounded / waxed ma^de
and out of mind / maimed / killed / deed suddenly without confession / which
have descended in to everlasting damnacyon. Think also how many thousands of
persons are the same night fallen in danger and peril of their souls / as
in glotony / lechery / auaryce / homycyde / or manslaughter / and in many other
great myscheuous deeds and folyschenesses. And from all these great myscheues
and euylles has your sweet lord Jesus christ delivered you without your
deserving or merytes. For what good service or other things have ye done
unto him for the which he should so keep and has kept and preserved you / and
to leave and forsake so great nombre of other / Therefore if ye mark dylygently
and take good head how much good he has done / and does to you always in
every where / and on every side / ye shall fy^de him so occupied and dylygent
about your proufyte as though he did none other thing else but only to give
attendau^ce / and take always head and regard to your welthe and salute / and
so shall yefe him that for to keep you he is so curyous and besy as though he
had forgoten all ye world and took head to no body but only to attend and
keep you. And when ye have thought all this lift up your hands to your lord
god and thank him of these and of all other his great benefytes and goods in
this manner. Gratias tibi ago dn^e jesus xp^e qui me indignam famula^ tuam. N. in
hac nocte custodisti / (...) / visitasti ac sana^ et ico lumen: ad hanc horam
peruenire fecisti et pro alijs been fic^ tuis que michi tua sola bonitate
contulisti. Qui (...) and regnas deus per oia (...) seculorum. Ame^. And even
in the same manner should ye say when ye rise in the morning / and when ye goo
to bed at night / sauf only that where ye say at mydnyght. (...) hanc ho ram
there should ye say in the morning. (...) hutus (...). And at night. (...)
huius (...). And when ye have so done than should ye besyly and inwardly
think and consider how ye have spent all ye time from the morning yt ye rose
unto that time at night when ye lie in your bed. And also from ye time yt ye
lie down in your bed unto the time that ye are risen in the morning. Than
desire / require / and ask of god hettely his mercy for all the euylles yt ye
have done / and of all the good deeds that ye have left and lost in that day or
yt night. And than do none erthely thing unto the time that ye have commended
your self and all your friends quycke and deed in to ye hades of our sweet sau
your Jesus christ / and say in this manner for your self and for the this prayer
following. In manus tuas dn^e and scto^rum angelorum tuorum com^do in hac nocte

How a man shall co^te^ple god (...) creature. ca. vi.
(...) ben.iii. manners of contemplacyon. The first manner is in creature.
The.ii. ^re. The.iii. is of god himself in his own nature.

Coutemplacyon the first wise is nothing else but the sight of god in his
creatures / and that may ye se in this manner. Three things there ben in god yt
is to (...) / power / wisdom / and bounte or love. Power is ap propryate to
god ye fader / wisdom to god ye sone and bounte to god ye holy ghost. By his
power all thyn ges are created and made. by his wisdom they are they praise
you / they ^oure you / and all your cre^ ^es does glorify you o blyssed
trynite. All creatures of ryghtdooth praise you for their goodness, they
adoure you of right for their fayrnesse / and of^yght they gloryfy you for
t^eyr ^gyte and welthe. O blyssed trynite of whom all thing by your power

whom all thiges are by your bou^te multyplyed. Tibi honor and g^a isc^a rum.

Now a man shall se the will of god in holy scripture. Ca vii.
NOw have ye matter how ye may se yt will of god in every creature / and yt is
the first degree of co^te^plation. The.ii. degree of co^te^placion is in scry
pture. But now peraue^ture ye yt be of sy^ple lerninge will ask me this
questyon. Now may I ever come to yt co^te^platio^ of god in scripture and have
no co^n^ge? Now swetely atte^de to me and here me and it may hap I shall tell
you. what so ever is written in scripture it may be told and showed to you. And
therefore yfye understand not yt scripture be glad to learn and here althy^ ge
yt wise men will show you so yt ye may vndersta^ de and know all thige yt
good is and to keep it when it is showed you. And wha^ ye here any thing in
open set mon or in secret collacyon / take good head if ye here ought yt may
do you good to the edyfycacion of your soul / to ye hatynge of syn^e / and
loving of virtue. to yt ferynge of pain / and to the desyringe of joy. to yt
die spysynge of this world / and to ye hastynge toward another. what is to be
done / and what to be left / and how much does illumyn and quycken your vuder
sta^dy ge in yt ^owlege of truth / and how much does inflam be their desire
in the fervor or bren^ynge love of charity. For of these good things should
ye know whatsoever be written secretly or open. Out of holy sctypture shall ye
take and know which ben yt.vii deedly sins / and the.vii. virtues of the
gospel / yt.vii gifts of the holy ghost / and the.x. co^maund^me^tes of god /
the.xii. artycles of ye faith / and the.vii. sacramen tes of holy church.
the.vii. virtues / and yt. vii. works of mercy. the.vii. pet ycyons of the
pater nt^. the pains of hell / and the wyes of heaven.

Of the.vii. deedly sins / and of their branches. Ca. viii.
THe.vii. deedly syfies are these following. Pride / envy / wrath / slouthe /
auaryce / glotony / and lechery. Than first pride is ye love of his own
excellece / and highness / and of it does ^ede and come these. vii. vices and
branches / that is to ^ay. Inobedience against god or against his superyour or
lord / that is to leave that thing yt he is commanded to do. And to do ye
thing which is forboden and defended. The secon de branch is boost. ^tau^ce
/ or auauntry. when and man does boost hym^e and wexe proud of the god des
that he has of another. or of the evil or vngracyousnesse that is in
himself. The.iii. is y pocrysy / and yt is when a man does feign him to have
goods that he has not / or does hyde the evil which is in him. The.iiii.
branch is dyspyte of other; yt is w^ on y mynyssheth or makes sytill the
goodness of another yt he himself may seem and appear the better. The.v. is
arrogau^ce / stoburnesse / or reioycyn ge in ill / and that is when a man
makes comparyson between his cuyls and unhappy deeds / and the wicked deeds of
another / because that his may seem yt less. The.vi. is unshamefastness / yt is
when a man has no manner shame of his wicked life / or vngracyousnesse openly
known. The.vii. branch is clacyon / o: auauncynge of himself / as when a
man rejoices of his own wickedness and evil. And here ye shall know that
three thy^ gesthere be of the which man is proud. The first is of the goods
and gifts of na ture as beauty / strength / good wit / and nobleness of
^ynred. The second is of the goods and gifts of fortu ne that man does
acquere and get / as conning / ver tue / grace / good name and fame / and
dygnyte or worldly worship. The third is of temporal goods / as clothing /
housynge / rentes and possessyo^s / household meyny and such as longs to
riding / as horses / armure or harneys / and such worldly honors. Out of
envy comes ^oye of others ill / and sorrow for his welthe and good. And yt may
be in heart by afflyccion / or in mouth by detraccyon / or in deed by
subtraccyo^ as by styrynge or mouynge of good or ill. Out of wrath does come
and proceed chiding / contencyos or debates / rysynge or swellynge of heart /
evil and reprouable words / dysdayne / blasphemy / or sclaun der. Out of
trystesse or slouthe does come malice and ^ancour of will / dyspayre of mercy
/ neclygence about the commandments of god / and wauerynge mind about
unlawful things. Of auaryce pro cedeth gyle / treason / perjury / evil rest
/ vyole^ce / hardenesse of heart against mercy. Out of glotony comes idle and
wa^ton myrthe or gladness / lechery / vnclenlynesse / over much speech and
words / and a weyke or feeble understanding. Out of lechery comes ye
blyndenesse of heart in prayenge unsteadfastness / anguysshe / folly /
hastynesse / love of himself / hatred of god / affection and love of this
present world / horror and dyspayre of the world to come. These ben the vii.
deedly sins / and so they may well be called deedly For. iii. the first
dispoyleth and robs the wretched and caytyf sinner. The fourth all to
tourmenteth him. The.v. does cast and treed him under foot. The.vi. does
deceive and dyshe^yte him. The.vii. brings him in all bondage and fylthy
service. For pride takes fro man his god. Envy his neighbor. wrath himself.
Slouthe tourmenteth him. Auaryce oppresses him. Glotony deceyueth him. And
lechery brings him in to all fylthy and foul seruage or bondage.

Of the virtues of the gospel. Ca. x.


NOw for a remedy against these.vii. vices and sins our lord puts. vii.
virtues in ye holy gospel of saint Matthew and says thus. Blyssed be ye poor
in spyrite / for theyrs is ye ky^gedom of heaven. And yt is against pride yt fro
man takes his god. Blyssed be ye meke and deb^nayrs. For they shall possess
the land perdurable or everlasting. And that is against (...) uye that takes
fro man his neighbor. Blyssed be they that here do wayle and weep / for they
shall be conforted. And that is against wrath that takes fro man himself.
Blyssed be yt merciful that have mercy on other. For they shall get mercy of
god. And that is agayust auaryce that takes pite on no man nor mercy. Blyssed
be they which be ho^gry and thrysty / that is to say / after right and justice
/ for they shall be refresshed. That is against slouthe and neclygence. Blyssed
be they that be clean in heart for they shall se god. And that is against
glotony y^ which thinks always (...) and (...) and fyllynge of the belly.
Blyssed be the peasybles for they shall be called the children / or sons of
god. And that is against lechery / for the lecherous body can never have rest
in his my^de nor peace in his her (...). Also against the (...) of pride man
should have in his heart both in word and deed very humyly te. Against envy
(...) of others welthe and good / and sorrow for his hurt and damage and again
frendshyp. Also against wrath a man should have pacyence and (...) or
myldenesse. Also against slouthe, lyghtnesse or swyftnesse / and strength
both of heart and body in ye service of god and in other good works. Against
auaryce lyberalyte and largeness / that he give of his goods to the poor and
nedy / and yt with good will and heart after his power. Against lechery he
should be chaste in heart / in body and in (...). Against glotony he should
have measure in himself / both of meet and drink / and most specially of
drink. For by super (...) and over much drink many young persons has been
perysshed and lost / and many vyrgyns has lost their vyrgynyte / and also many
good men and women has lost the chastyte. Also the dropesyes / the fe uers or
the ague / the gout and apostumes / the tothe a che and many diverse other
infyrmytees mo than I can rehearse or name comes often by the super fluyte of
drink. These are the.vii. remedies and anty dotes against the forenamed. vii.
venyms. Therefore take these helthy medicines against the foresaid deedly
sekenesses / and grievous infyrmytees.

Of the.vii. gifts of the holy ghost. Ca. xi.


NOw have ye the dyseases and their medicines. Than here comes ye sovereign and
hye (...) / and takes his me dycynes and heeleth ye man of these. vii.
infyrmytees / and comforts him in the.vii. virtues by the.vii. gifts of the
holy ghost which ben these. The spyrite of wisdom, and understanding. The
spyryte of council and of strength. The spyryte of scylence and of pity. The
spyryte of ye feere of our lord. By these. vii. gifts our lord techeth man
every thing yt is to hun necessary both for the life (...) and the life
contemplatyf. Now thanse first how a man should and ought to for sake the evil
and yt te cheth the spyryte of the feere of our lord. And to do ye good
lerneth us ye spyryte of pity. And because there be two things that lets
man to do well that is to wit / prosperyte / and aduersyte of this (...). For
prosperyte does deceive him by flatery and aduersy and not se him lost and
spylte should not take ye from (...) which should sustain and keep his life.
The.viii. commandment is. Ye shall bear no falls witness against your
neighbor. That is to wit with them yt will slay him or do by any way hurt / ye
shall not consent thereto / and that is right. For he yt (...) not of him self
hurt his neighbor he shall to none other which will hurt him / consent /
council / nor help.

The.(...). commandment is. ye shall not (...) yt nor (...). (...) ye wife of
your neighbor. In which is un derstande yt no man shall coueyt ye wife of his
neygh bour / his daughter nor any other his servant. And agay (...) that no
woman shall coueyt nor desire any (...) of ye world with wanton carnal or (...)
leave.

The.^. commandment is. ye shall coueyt noth in ge that is your neighbors.
These two last commandments accords to ye other two yt go (...) / which
are these. Thou shall do no lechery / and thou shalt do no theft. For who yt
has an evil will or an (...) intent in his heart can not long absteyne and
keep him fro doing cuyll in work and deed. And therefore (...) ye will do no
lechery in deed you man coueyt no manner of woman / nor you woman also no man
wan ill in^ of heart. And yfye will not stele or do (...) de coueyt never
another man's gods in your (...). These are the.x. (...) which our lord
gave to Moses in ye mount synay / of the which the first three perteyneth and
belongs to the love of god / and the other. vii. to ye love of our self and
of our neighbor.

Of ye three virtues theologycalles / faith / hope / and charity. Ca. xiii.
Moreover now shall ye know which be^ the.vii. virtues / yt is to wite Faith
/ hope / charity / prudence / justice / teperau^ce / and strength. Of all one
matter be the.x. commandments and ye. vii. virtues. But this is the
dyfference / yt the.x. comaundementes techeth us what we shall do / and these.
vii. virtues techeth us to do good. The.iii. first virtues yt is to say faith
/ hope / and charity does order us how we shall live as toward god. The other
four affermeth us how we shall order our life in this world that they may
bring us to ye (...) of heaven. (...) ye shall know that we all are create and
made for one end / yt is / (...) know god / to have god / and to love god.
But. iii. things are necessary for to come to a good end. The one is that we
know whyder we shall go. That we desire with (...) love in wardly for to come
to (...). And that we hope surely thither to go. For it is great folly to a man
to begin a thing yt he can not bring to an enoe. On the other side yfony man
(...) do any good he (...) needs have these three / yt is to wit / knowledge /
power / and will. That is yt he can do it well. That he may do it well. And yt
he will do it well. But because we have no knowledge nor will of our self /
therefore god has given to us faith to fulfill the defaut of our knowledge. Hope
to (...) ye defaut of our power. Charyteor true love (...) ordey ne our wylone
to another. And Faith ordeyneth us to god the sone to whom is appropryed
(...). Hope to god the Fader to whom is (...) power. And Charity and love unto
god the holy ghost unto whom is appropryed goodness. And therefore faith
makes us to have ye knowledge of god. And ye knowledge shows us yt he is god
almighty / and that he is marvelous and lyberall that in such manner and so
largely gives and lends us of his goods. And of this faith comes hope by
the same knowledge yt says y^ god is hye god. And fro thens comes the.iii.
virtue yt is called charity or love. For every (...) naturally does love that
the which is good.

Of the.iiii. cardynall virtues. Ca. xiiii.
HEre after ye shall know which be ye.iiii cardynal virtues / by ye which al
ye life of mankind is ruled and kept. and the worl de also guided / and these
are they. Prube^ce justice (...) / and strength. Of these. iiii. says ye holy
ghost in ye book of sapyence yt in this world is nothige so pfytable for man /
and here is ye cause. For who so ever will do well it is necessary yt he can
choose the good fro the ill / and of. ii. good things to choose ye better and yt
techeth you prudence. And when ye have chosen ye good fro the ill / and of
the.ii. goods ye better / than shall ye leave ye ill and do the good / and leave
the less good and do ye greter / and yt is the (...) called justice. And bycau
se there be. ii.things yt lets a man to do good and to leave the ill / yt is
to wit / ye prosperity of this world yt deceueth (...) by flatery / pleasures
/ and falls sweetness / and the aduersyte of ye same yt may oppress by ye
sorrowful and sore sharpness and pains. Therefore against prospe (...) ye must
have measure and dyserecyo^ yt ye be not to much elate and proud of it / and
this virtue is (...) peraunce. And against aduersyte ye must (...) dacyte or
boldness yt ye be not (...) And this virtue is called Strength.

Of the.xii. artycles of the faith. Ca. xv.


HEre shall ye know which ben the.xii. artycles of the faith. The first is
yt yt fader / the sone / and the holy ghost is one god and. iii. persons. And
yt self same god which is one in substance / and. iii. in persons is with
out beginning and shall be without end / the which With his word made heaven and
earth / the sea and all that is in them of nothing. The second article is
that ye sone of god was ^as and took flesh and blood of the (...) Mary and of
the same vyrgyn was borne very god and very man. The.iii. article is yt the
same Jesus the (...) of god and of the blyssed vyrgyn Mary suffre^ passion was
deed / and honestly buried. This passion he suffered kyndly and mekely and of
his own good will that he might redeem us out of the infernal bonds (...)
captyuyte. His soul dese ended in to hell with his god ^d his body lyenge in the
sepulere / and drew out with ^m the souls yt in this world had done his will.

The.iiii. article is yt the self Jesus christ very god and very man arose ye
third day fro death to life in his (...) glorified and appeared many times to
Mary inawdeleyne and his dysciples and appostles / and dydespe (...) and ete
with them. And by his resurreccyon with yt same body which we have here in
this world we shall ar yse fro death to life. The.v. article is yt the same
Jesus christ very god and very man ascended to heaven and by him to heaven we shall
ascend if we be taken out of this world without deedly syn^e. And fro heaven he
did send to his apostles yt holy ghost. And in yt day of ^ugement he shall
come fro thens in his man heed to judge the lyuinge and deed / and every (...)
a^er his deeds to receive reward.

Of the.vii. sacraments of holy church. Ca. xvi.


THe first sacrament of holy church is baptun. For our lord god made himself
to be bapty sed in the floode or river of ^ordane to halowe and sanctyfy the
sacrament of baptym / by ye virtue of words. And by ye sacramet of baptim yt
deuylis put out and chaced fro yt child and his orygynall sin is taken fro
him which he took of his tader and mother / and is infu^ded in yt child the
grace of baptym. And if yt chyl de borne were or happed to be in peril of death
and yt there be no ple^te of prestes / as no priest to get than shall a lay
man or woman say to hy^. N. so named I ba ptyse the. In nole p^s and (...) and
spu^ss^ti. A^ne^. And the^ put water upon hy^ / and that suffyseth to ye
chyldes sou le. Yfa child be found unknown if it be baptized or not / than
shall yt chapellayne or priest say to ye chyl de. Si ^o^ es baptizatus ego
baptizo te in (...) pris and ft lij and spu^ss^ti. a^ne^. They yt hold the
child at yt font stone ought and should teache him his believe / yt is to say
the Qat noster / ye Aue maria / and the Credo. For man can not be saved but by
baptym and faith. And let the priest be well ware yt he put not the chyide
agay ne in the water if he were baptized before of any lay man or woman / lest
yt he be made irreguler and the child also after yt decree. The second sa^
(...) is co^fyrmacyon the which confyrmeth ye holy ghost in ye person
baptized and co^serueth him. within. v. years at the leest after ye child is
borne he should be co^fyrmed of the bysshoppes hands / and if he pass yt time
by necligence he falls in deedly syn^e and should be confessed before he were
co^fyrmed. The fader and mother shall also beware and keep the^ well yt they
hold not their own child before ye bishop at confyrmynge.

The third sacrament is penance the which wassheth and takes ever away
both ye actual syn^e / ye venyall sin / and the deedly syn^e. This
sacrament ordained ye sone of god which coming fro heaven did here meke
penance / not for himself / but for ye saluacyo^ of his people. And saint
John^ baptyst preched penance in remyssyon and forgyuenesse of sins. For
penance with contricyon of the heart / co^fessyon of ye mouth / and with
satisfaction of ye deed and with meekness puts out and banissheth the enmye
fro yt heart of the penyte^t and dystroyeth deedly syn^e / and draws ye man
again to his maker / and ledeth ye mind or will to great joy and clerenesse.
The.iiii. is ye sacrament of the auter yt confyrmeth ye penytent and conforteth
lest he again slide and fall in to deedly syn^e / and also reconsyleth him and
susteyneth. For when our lord Jesus christ souped with his dysciples he did
ordeyne this sacrament in ye co^memoracyon and memory of his passion. And
therefore every cryste^ man should at the leest be houseled ones in the year /
as in ye eester day with great devotion.

The.v. sacrament is holy ordres yt brings and gives power to such as be
ordered and ordained for to do their office / and for to celebrate and halowe
the sacraments. For our lord Jesus god almighty has given power to priests
and prelates of the church yt they should help other / and inform them in
ye faith / that they shall bind and loose / yt is to say fro sin / and that
they should mynystre to them the sacraments of holy church / and namely the
sacrament of ye auter the which is made by the virtue of words of the true
priest of prelates. For in three things there be virtues / yt is to wit in
stones / in words / and in herbs.

The.vi. sacrament is matrymony or wedlock ye which excludes and puts
away deedly syn^e in the work of generacyon between man and woman. God yt is
sovereign and hye good / and also hye wisdom did ordeyne in erthly paradyse
this sacrament in Adam and Eve / which is a coniunccion and knyttynge so
strong that it may not be undone nor dysseuered in their life / but by the
judgment of holy church or by death. God also made matrymony for the
procreacyon and ge tynge of children / and for chastity to be kept.
Notwithstanding wedded people should with dylygence and wisdom keep time and
hour. The.vii. sacrament is ye last holy anoyntynge or enelynge yt alyghteth
and swageth ye seek people in peril of death both fro the bodyly pain and
goostly. And it is given to the^ that be seek to the mynysshynge or making
less of their penance. For ever lightly the pain of ye pacient and seek
does aswage at that anoyntynge / and ever some thing is forgyuen of his
penance. And therefore as it is said the last anoyntynge or euelynge is one of
the.vii. by whom are released the pains of satysfaccion. wherefore the error
of the lay people is to be removed and put away which will not receive the
last holy anoyntynge but only at the hour of death. It were better for them
to be anointed in ye be gynnynge of their sickness. For as says saint James.
Infirmatus quis ex vobis ^ducat sacerdotes orantes and vnguentes oleo and
allemabit infirmus. and s^ in pet^s sit dunittentur ei p^ta^. Therefore a man
may know that many are heeled of their sickness by ye la^te holy anoyntynge
or anclynge. And yet there is another error of the lay people to be put away /
and yt is this. That it is not lawful to any man after this last anoynty^ge to
touch his wife flesshely / they say also that ever after he should live in
abstynence / and al these be falls. Not with standinge he yt is so anointed
should keep his body in the more reverence after than he did before / and not
for all yt to eschew his wife / nor a priest also his ordres after one year.
Moreover it is to be noted and known that ye last holy anoyntynge may be
iterate again after the custom of holy chyr the. For the virtue of yt last
holy anoyntynge dureth but one year / as ye penance of all synues is termyned
and ended in one year. And therefore ye benedyccion and the con^ecracion or
halowynge of the holy cresme or oil is ever made new of the bishop in ye
end of ye year / not by cause the old cresme or oil does leave or loose his
v^diccion. But it is done because ye new cresme is had in greter reverence
than the old / and because all the old cresme or oy^ might have be spent in
ye year passed. Moreover it is to be douted of that yt saint James says.
Inf^rmat^. (...). That is to say / yfony of you be seek let him cause to be
brought in prestes prayenge and anoynt^ge / and he shall soon^ be releued of
his pain and infyrmyte / and if he be in sin his sins shall be forgyuen /
as though he would say that one priest is not enough. But is said of council.
For (...) ^e ^re in ^alue ye prayers of many prestes than of one It (...)
^pleth more to be (...) yuen to many prestes tha^ to (...). For by many
shamefastnesses shall some what of the pain of sin be released and forgyuen.
And nevertheless it is suffyeyent to be shryuen to one priest only. So
therefore it shows well yt the last holy anoyntinge may be iterate and (...)
again / but ^ot dystroyed / that is to say after one year only. For to all
sekenesses and (...) yt fall or happen in one year one only anoyntynge is
enough. And also it is not called the last because there may none other follow
/ but because most con^nly it happens that s^ che anoynty^ge is given to
them ye labor in ye point and pa^ges of death. And therefore ever after yt any
has taken this holy anoyntynge he should be ye more pro^ pte and ^esyer in the
dyuyne co^emplacyon.

Of the.vii. works of merry. Ca. xvii.
NOw here after shall ye know which be^ the.vii. works of merry. The first
is to fe^e ye ho^gry The second is to give drink to the thyrsty. The third
is (...) clothe ye (...). The fourth is to herborowe the pylg^s. The fyfth is
to dysyte ye prisoners. The syxte is to comfort ^hoscke. And the.vii. is to
bury ye deed. These ben the.vii. wer^es of mercy ye does belong and perte yne
to the body of man. But now ye may say this ^o (...). I (...) in (...) ^ not
whereof I may do it. Nor I may not vysyte the pry^oners / nor comfort the seek
/ nor bury the deed for I am put and set under the will of another man / and
there fore it were much better for me that I were (...) that I might perform
and do these works of mercy. But as to yt be ye not deceived. for better it is
and dot^ more prevail to have pity and compassyon in your heart of any poor
wretch having and suffrynge ^ede / than though ye had in possessyon all this
world that ye might give it him for charity. For it is mo^he more worth
without co^paryson that which ye be than yt which ye have. Therefore give
yourselfe and than do ye give more than though ye gave all the world. But now
may ye say this to me. Truth it is that it is better for a man to give
himself than of his / but it avails gretely to do the one with the other.
For more are worth two good things than one by himself. I say that is not
so. For whyther is it better to be called god or his servant / ye wot well
that it is better to be called god. But those the which do suffer hongre /
thirst / cold / defaute / and such other mysery and wretchednesses of the
world for gods sake our lord Jesus crystealleth them h^selfe. For this he
says in the gospel. Quicquid f^ceritis vni de hus minimis (...) meo michi^is
That is to say. Look what ye do to one of the leest in my name / as who would
say / for my sake / ye do it to me. On the other side whyther does it more
avail to judge or to be iuged? ye know well it is better to judge / and that
do the po^re. For these poor people shall judge the (...) men. As Christ say
(...) the gospel. ^s (...) omnia and secuti es^ me (...) filius hois in sede
magestatis sue. sede bitis and vos s^. xii. tribus thronos iudica^tes. xii.
tribus israel. That is to say. Ye that have left and forsaken all worldly
things and have followed me / when ye sone of man shall come in the seet of his
mageste than shall ye sit upon. x^. thrones iugynge the.xii. tribes of israel.
On the other side whyder is it better to have ye joy of heaven in possessyon or
in promysse. Su rely it is better in possessyon / and so has it the poor
people. For this saythour lord in the gospel. Bea^ pauperes spu^ ^n^
ipsorume^ regnu^ celorum. Blyssed ben ye poor in spyryte / for theyrs is the
ky^gdom of heaven. He says not / their shall be / but theyrs is. as though he
said / they be as sure of the joy of heaven as of the thing the which they
hold in their hands. And therefore says saint Bernarde in this wise. ^auperes
nichil habet in terra nec du^tes aliquid habe^t in celo. That is to say. the
poor men has noth ynge in earth / nor the rich men has noth ynge in heaven.
And therefore if they will have any thige there they must bye it of the poor.
Now I wot well yt yede sire to know who is poor and who is not who is ve ry
rich and who is not / therefore here me with deuocy on. There be some which
have richesse and they love them as be the nigardes and covetous people of the
world. Other there be that have no (...) never thelesse they love them and
desire / and would (...) ha ue them / as ^en the wretched beggars of (...)
^rlde and the ^uyll relygiouses / and they are as (...) the other or more. And
these are they of (...) Jesus christ speaks in the (...) est camelum performen

BEfore matyns ye shall first think on the natyuyte of our lord / and after
on his passion On ye not y^yte shall ye think inward ly / the time / the place
and the hour in ye which our lord Jesus christ was borne. The time was in ye
mids of wy^ter when it was most cold. The hour was at mydnyght which is
ye most hardest hour. The place was in the myd des of the way in a house
without walls / the which is called in latin. Diuersorium. That is as ino che
to say / as a place where men went ever to (...) themself fro the rain and
other storms. In the whi che he was wrapped in ye most poor cloutes / and
bo^ de with alyste. He was laid in the crybbe or rack before an ox and an
ass / for he had none other place in that house Than shall ye think on the
dylygent and besy labor and charge yt our blyss^d lady tok^ about her sweet
sone Jesus. and of Joseph her spouse what gre te joy he made and had. Think
also on the (...) that the shepeherdes had / and of the (...) company of
aungelles / and lift up your heart and sing with them yt swetesonge. Gl^ia i^
excelsis deo. etc. Than touchy^ge the passion shall ye think how yt at such
an hou re of the night he was betrayed of his dysciple. as a traytre taken. as
a thief bound. and as a wicked person led and brought. Think also
inwardly how freely and with good will he offered himself to ye jews / and to
ye people. and how yt he kyssed Judas his traytre and named him by his name /
and called him his friend. and how he for bode and defended his disciples yt
none of the^ should draw sword out of ye shethe. And how he he led ye eere
which saint Peter cut of. and how his dysci ples left him. and how the cursed
jews took him hell de him and bound him / and after brought him before Anne.
and how he was there examyned and buffeted because he answered contrary to
their will. After how they led hm^ to Cayphas / where saint Peter tre^bled for
feere. and thryes forsook hy^ by ye words of a w^che.

Of the illusyon or scornynge. And of the resurreccyon at pryme. Ca. xxii.




Before mydday shall ye think on the annu^cyacion and on the passion. On ye
annu^cyacio^ shall ye think of the great mercy of our lord god by cause he
would vouch sauf to become man. and to suffer ^ethe for us in his manheed sith
he might have redeemed us otherwise. And a^ yt did he to us that he might draw
and get to him our love. For if one hadben our maker and another our redemer /
tha^ should we more have loved our redemer than our maker. And therefore would
our maker be our sau your and redemer and suffer in one body all our soro we yt
he might so bye all our love. Of the passion shall ye think yt at s^ che an
hour was our lord Jesus christ crucyfyed between. ii. thieves / on each side one
/ as though he had been the master of them. Now here can I not tell what I
shall say. For if all the paynfull sores / sorrow full and woeful sekenesses of
this world were in the bo ^y of one only man / and if this man might conceive
and have as much angu ysshe and pain with grievous sorrow as all the men in ye
world / it should be little or nothing in regard and comparyson to ye sorrow
ye our lord suffered for us in one hour of the day. wherefore if I might live
by ye space of a. C. M. years and in every day dye a. M. times for him the same
death yt he deyed for me but ones / it were nothing in co^pary son to the
doloure and pain which he had in him. Than it may happen yt some man will
say to me yt the pain which Jesus crist suffered on ye cross for us was more
and greter ^or the space and tune than ye pain of he^. It is truth. and for
this cause. There is no creature yt may suffer so much as did our lord Jesus.
For no man has nor had in him so much (...) as he. Tha^ it appears yt the
pain of hell was less for so much space and tune than ye pain yt our lord
Ie su christ suffered. I say not this certainly or for a surete because of the
co^scy ence of some people. For ye which he says himself by Ierempe ye
prophet. O vos oe^s (...) transitis per viam att^e et videte si est dolor (...)
cut dolor meus. that is to say. O all ye which go by ye way / behold and se
if there be any sorrow like unto mine. Surely there is none / nor ueuer was yet
soro, we like yours O sweet lord Jesus) in this world. Also ye shall here
think ou the most sweet and blys sed vyrgyn Marye how she was replenys^hed
and filled full of great sorrow and anguysshe when she stood on the right side
of her best beloved sone / and received y^ ^y sey ple for the master. and how
she had great sorrow when she took the servant for ye lord. the sone of a
(...) ner for the sone of an emperor. John^ the sone of zebedee for Jesus the
sone of god. Therefore might she say of her that Noemye said. De me dicas
mag^aliter pulchram sed de tetero appellare me amaram. That is to say. call me
never here after fair but call me bitter and sorrowful. Also she might well say
this yt is in ye so^ge of love. Marvel ye not though I be pale and broune.
For I am dyscolored by heet of ye son^e. Therefore an english man moved with
pity made this

Now gooth the son under the wood.
Me reweth Mary thy fair roode.
Now gooth the son under the tree
Me reweth Mary thy sone and the.
O fairest / o beautifullest maiden now have ye ta sted and truly felt ye
most sharp point of ye sword of ye which Symeon made mention to you in ye
day of your puryfycation. and now ye have also received the promesses yt Anne
the prophetess promised you.

Of ye death of our lord Jesus christ. And of his ascensyon at Noone. Ca. xxv.


A Fore noone ye shall think on ye passion / and on the ascensyon. On the
passion ye shall thy^ ke yt at such an hour deyed yt auctour of life for our
love. Also ye shall here think on ye. vii. words yt he spoke on ye cross and
on ye. iiii. tokens yt befell at his death The first word yt he spoke was. Pat
ignosce illis or nesciu^t ^d faciu^t. yt is to say. Fader forgive the^
theyrsyn^e for they wot not what they do. The ii. word was. A men dico tibi
or hodie mecu^ eris in paradiso. These words he spoke to ye thief penytent and
sorry for his sins. yt is to say. Certainly I say to the yt this day shall ye
be with me in paradise. The.iii word was wha^ he spoke to his mother of saint
john in this wise. Multer ecce filius tuus. Lo woman behol de and take here thy
sone. And than said to his disciple ^cce mt^ tua. yt is to say. Behold and take
her there for thy mother. The.iiii. word was. ^ly. h^ly lama zabathani. yt is to
say. O my god my god wherefore have ye for saken me. The.v. word was. ^itio.
ye is to say. I am a thyrst. The.vi. was. ^o^su^matu^ est. yt is to say. Now
are ye prophecies fulfilled. The vii. was. ^t^ in manus tuas co^mendo spin^
meu. yt is to say. Fader in to thy hands I commend my spyrite and so bowynge
down his he^d his spyryte departed. The.iiii. signs or tokens were these. All
ye earth began to tremble. and of all the universal world there was an

down. The stones die de break and cleue in pyeces / the deed bodies arose out
of their graves. The son wexed dark and ^drewe his light fro mydday till ye
hour of noone. whereof saint Denis Arryopage being in ye parties f^rre fro
Jerusalem said. A ut deus nature pa^. aut machina mu^dt dissoluie^. yt is. Or
ye god of nature suffers passion / or ye hole match y^eme^t of ye world is
dyssolued and losed in sonder. (...) astensyon shall (...) yt such an hour
our lord went in to ye ^ou^t of Oly^ete-seyng his dysciples and his most
sweet mother. and fro them he ascended to heaven / and sytteth on yt right ha de
of his fader. And than his disciples returned to Je rusalem and there they were
in fastiges and prayers till ye coming of ye holy ghost. And there were of
the^ co^gregate together in one house about the nombre of. vi score men abiding
the blyssed coming of the holy ghost as our lord had commanded them.

Of the souper of our lord. And of his taking down fro ye cross at
Euensonge. Ca. xxvi.


Before euensonge time ye shall thy^ke on ye mau^ die or souper of our lord. and
of his taky^ge down fro ye cross. Of his taking down shall ye thi^^ how
Joseph of Aromathia had ipetred and gotten ye bo die of Jesu of Pylate. and how
ye jews came to ye cross of Jesu and brake ye thieves legs. and how a knight
took a spear and perced the blyssed syd^ of our lord. and yt in continent
blood and water ran^e out of it habou^dau^tly. Blood in token of our
rede^pcion. water in token of remyssyon of our sins. Joseph than took him
d^une of ye cross / because yt no body or corpse should bide unburied in so
great and hye a feast as was ye next day folo winge / which was their sabot
day. Of y^ maun die or souper shall ye thike yt at such an hour out lor de
gave his body flesh and blood to his dysciples in (...) likeness of breed
and wine. Her^ shall ye understand de yt in ye blyssed sacrament of ye auter
there ben. iii. thy^ ges. The first is ye likeness of breed and wy^e yt which
we se bodyly. The.ii. is ye very true body and blood of our lord Jesus christ
which we may not se with our bo dyly eyes. The.iii. is spyrytuall grace which
were ceyue when we take worthyly ye holy body / and that most blyssed blood.
We se ye substance and likeness of breed and wine. and yet ye substance of
breed and wine does not remain there after the consecracion. And we believe
surely and steadfastly that y^ symilytudeo: ly kenesse does conteyne in it
verily the body and blo^de of our lord Jesus christ. notwithstanding ye symy^y
tude or likeness of y^ body and blood may we (...) se. ^or we should abhor
and feere as touching our body to ete the raw flesh and dry^ke y^ blood of
a man. Therefore has our lord given to us his body and his blo de under the
likeness of breed and wine to comfort our bodyly understanding and wit by
such mete as we be wont to se and dare ^te. and to ^difye and make strong our
faith by that / that ^e do se one thing and believe another. And therefore
when ye approach to the auter for to be co^myned or houseled so take and
receive there ye blyssed sacrament as though ye received vysybly his blyssed
and most holy blood flowynge out of his side.

Of the blody sweetinge of our lord / and of his buryenge at at Complyn. Ca.
xxvii.


BEfore co^plyn should ye think. First how Jo seph and Nychodeme wrapped and
closed the body of our lord Jesu christ in fair shetes and a clean shrow de
and anointed it wpretyous oynteme^tes and did put him in a sepulcre and also
they put a stone at ye door of ye monument and the people put to their seals
and ordained knights to keep ye sepulcre. Secondly ye shall thike how our
lord Jesu ye day of his maundy after yt he had souped went with his dysciples in
to a gardyn where he prayed to his fader in such wise yt for soro we of death
he swette so yt the drops of blood dyst^ led fro his blyssed face and fell to
the ^the.

Of the contemplacion of god / as touch^ge his godheed. Ca. xxviii.


NOw have ye ye matter and way to think in god and to know him as touching in
his man he de. Now after shall ye know how to think vp^ him and to know him
in his moon high godherd. As to (...) shall (...) y^ god so ordered y^ (...) of
him self in (...) to mank ynde yt he w^lde not of all be showed nor of all be
^ept (...) to him. For if he had fully and holly showed himself than had faith
be no thige worth and (...) had been (...). For faith is of a thing yt may not
be seen. and therefore ye thing is no faith y^ (...) of him. And if he had of
all thing kept himself secret than faith had not ben and infydelyte had been
excused. And therefore god (...) a part show himself and a part keep
secret. In. iiii. manner wise he would show himself to m^ that is to wit
in.ii. manners withoutforth / and in.ii. manners withinforth. (...) you and by
reason. without by sc^ypture and by creature. By re uelac yon as when god has
showed or does show himself to some (...) people by insy yracyonor by
miracle. By reason (...) god to the knowles ge of man in this wise. Every man
may well know and (...) himself that he is / that is to say that he has
being / and that he has not ben ever. And by that he knows well that he
had a begyn^ynge of some other. Than it follows that he must think and
consider. that sometime was / in which orwhan he was not. But than when he was
not hecoude by no manner know himself / nor make himself. And the self same
sees man in every creature / for every day he sees some creatures pass and
depart. and some to come. And than because that all things be / and be not of
themself / ther^re it must needs be that one thing be and is which gy^eth
all things bey^ge / or too be. that is of whom all things be. And by that it
must needs be of right that he by whom all things he made is without
beginning / and without ending. For (...) should have a beginning it must
needs be that he should have it of some other. and so if he had a begin nynge
of another / than should not he be the first auctour and begynner / and (...)
first beginning of al. And therefore it is co^ueny (...) and must needs beth at
he by whom all things be or have being is before all thing / and nothing
before him. And if no^ thing be be^re him than came ^e of none other. And if
he came of none other than had he never begyunyng. For as I have said before /
every thing that has a beginning has it of another. For there is no thing
that is not that can give to it se^ fe being. And therefore it must needs be in
all manet wise that one thing there be y^ which had never begynnunge. And
when that ye reason of man booth se that of necessyte it can not / nor may none
other wise be / than begins he to believe steadfastly that one thing is
without beginning which is the auctour / begynuer / maker and gouernout of
all things which be in this world. And that thing is called Deus. That is
to say. God. For this word Deus. came of a name of greek y^ which is called
Theos. as much for to say as to make or nout ysshe. And therefore call we the
first beginning. Deus. in lat in. and. God. in english / for he has created
and made all. and has noury^shed all / for so sou^deth this word. deus. In
this manner wise came man first to the knowledge of god which is high and al
good.

How god is one in sub staunce. and. iii. in persons. Ca. xxix.


AFter comes ye reason of man and sees that necessarily the same god was and
is one only god and yt there be no mo gods. For if there were. ii. gods of
yt should needs follow yt both gods were superfluous and to scante. or to
much and to little. in same and several. togy der and asonder. For the first
should be superfluous and to much because ye second should suffice / or else
he shol de not be god. By the same reason ye second should be sup^uous when ye
first should be suffyrient enough. On the other side every of them should be to
scant or to little / because yt each of the^ should defaute or fail of other.
for none of them should be other / but each of them should be sovereign and hye
good. and so than should good fail of the^ both / so in both of them. And
there fore if there were two gods i^ both gods there should be superfluyte
and scantnesse / together and asonder and than it is co^uenyent and necessary yt
there be but one only god. On the other side no good may fail or die splease
god. but because ye consolacyon and comfort of company is good and sweet /
therefore god might not be without ye goodness of company. and than it should be
co^ueny ent and necessary yt the pluralite of persons be in god ye sovereign
and hye good. And because yt company can be in no less than between. ii.
therefore it is necessary yt in god at ye leest be. ii. persons. And because yt
company is little or nothing worth where there is no aly aunce nor love /
therefore it is co^uenyent yt the.iii. per soue be in god which must be the
knyttynge of love and alyaunce between the.ii. other persons. Therefore sith
unity is good and pluralyte / it is conuen yent and al so it must needs be yt
both these persons be in god. By such reason comes man to ye knowledge of
god yt he is one god in himself and in his substance / and. iii. in persons.
This same self thing sees man in himself. For he sees well that ever from
the begynny^ge that he has had power in himself to remember in ^ule. and
after power wisdom to vnderstandt. and tha^ he began to know that he had
power in soul / and of that power comes co^nynge / and of both comes love.
And when man sees well yt it is so in himself of that he understands well
yt it should be so in god which is above him. That is as much to say that in
god is power. and of that power comes his wysdo me / and of both does love
peede and come. And because that out of the first person comes the second
and yt of them both the third does proceed. therso re the first person is
called god the fadet. the second god the sone. and the third god ye holy
spyrite or ghost. And because that among men it is wont always to be that the
fader is more febler than ye sone for his (...) ge / and that the sone is not
so wise as the fader ^se of his youth. leest any man should think it so in
god / therefore is power appropryate to god the fader wisdom to ye sone. and
because that this word sp^te or ghost sounds always in feere / or yt it is a
feerful word. therefore to the holy ghost is appropryate sw^ tenesse / love /
and goodness. By this manner comes man first to the knowledge of god his maker.
how ^e is without beginning and without end. and wherefore he is called god.
and wherefore he is one in substance and iii. in persons. and wherefore the
first person is called fader / the second sone / the.iii. holy ghost. and
where fore yt power is appropryate to god ye fader / wisdom to ye sone / love
and goodness to the holy ghost. J^su su the wise shall ye know your god. and
this (...) of knowledge is the foundement of contemplaryon.

Of the.iii. degrees of co^templacyon. a. xxx.
Therefore afterward yt ye have thus establisshed your heart in very right
faythested fast hope / and perfyte charity. than lift up your heart in the
most highest conte^pla cyon of your cr^atour and maker. But your soul would
often se god by conte^plac yon in his natu re and she may not. and than she
comes again to herself and makes of herself degrees and steps by the
which she may ascend and mount to the dyuine co^templacyon. so that first she
may se and behold her own propre nature. and afterward yt nature yt is above
her. But if her thought and mind be by bodily ymagyna ^io^s dyuersly
dispercled and troubled / than may not she search nor find herself in her
own nature. For look was many ill thoughts and cogytacions as she is leddew.
with as many obstacles she is noyed and let. The first degree of co^templacyon
of ye soul is / that the soul be returned to herself and gadred together and
bring her self in herself. The.ii. degree is that ye soul may se and behold
herself what she is / when she is so gadred togider. The.iii. degree is yt the
sou le lift her up above herself / and enforce herself to behold her degree in
her own propre in ward nature. But to the knowledge of herself may she never
come / ^yll she be taught and informed to refrain every ymaginacyon bodyly /
erthly / and heavenly. And when the re comes to her heart any manner of
delecta^yo / why der it be by the sight / herynge / tastynge smelling / or
touching / or by any other of her body y wits she should incontynently
refuse and trecd the^ under foot. that she may se herself such as she is
holly without body. Take ye therefore dyligent head and merk^ it well how that
the soul is merueylous in herself / and how she is one in her nature / yet
(...) she does diverse works. For she ledeth him that sees with her ^yen /
heereth by her eeres / tastes by mouth / smells by nose / touches and
feleth by all other members. Afterward think how great she is / that with one
only thought she may comp^eh heaven and earth / and al things that be in them
/ if they were a. (...) times greter tha^ they are. which may not be. Tha^ if
the soul of man be so great and so noble yt no creature in this life may
understand nor know her per fytely. how great and how noble than is he that
ma de so noble th^ges. Ueryly he is above all. under all. within all. and
without all. He is above all / all things gouern^ge. under all / all th^ges
supporting. with in all / all things fulfyllynge. without all / all things
co^passynge. Such manner of contemplacyon engenders in man sted fast believe /
and sure (...). After shall ye know how he is large and lyberall. and that may
yese in diverse wise. Behold first how he is lyberall of temporal goods. and
how he gives his goods as well to the evil as to the good and every thing
that yese in earth. Than after ye shall mer ke how large and lyberall he is to
pardon and to forgive. For if so were that one man had done and committed
as many euylles and sins as all ye men in the world may do / yet of his
great and gracious goodness will he be and is daily and hourly more redyer
and dylygent for to forgive and pardon than the most wretched and miserable
s^ner will be for to ask forgyuenesse. Moreover ye shall think how lyberall
he is of spyrytuall goods. that is to say of virtues. for who has one has
them: that is to wy te charity. The.(...). ye shall think how large and (...)
berall he is of everlasting goods to (...) that will ask them ryghtfully.
For how can he deny you yt, which he commands you to ask. for this he
says h^selfe. First desire and pray me that I shall give you the (...) of
heaven and I will give it you. and also al te^ porall good without asking or
re^uyringe. On the other side he gives you here all the laud and (...) that
ye can desire. for all erthly things obeys to man. This manner of
conte^placyon of his power and lyberalyte engenders in man certain and sure
hope. After this ye shall thy^ke of his goodness / his swe tenesse and of his
beauty. and to do yt take ye good head of the great goodness / of the great
beauty / and of the (...) sweetness yt is in an erthly creature. how many
things there be which are delectable and pleasant to the bodily eye for
their beauty. and to the tastynge for their sweetness. and to the no^e for the
(...) sweet smelling and to the feeling for their softness. and so to all
other wits. Than sith so much beauty / sweetness / and goodness be in a
creature which this day is and to morrow shall not be. how great goodness
beauty and sweetness is there than in a goostly crea ture which never shall
have end. On the other side if so much ^ beauty / goodness / and sweetness
be in eve ry creature. how great beauty / sweetness / and good ^esse should
there than be in their creator and maker. ye know well / much more without
compary^on. This (...) of contemplacion engenders in man ye love of his maker.
Than (...) when y^ have thus beholden your most sweet creator and maker by
the consyderacyon and sight of his creatures (...). and put out fro your heart
every corporal or bo dyly ymagynacion. and than let your bare understanding
fl^e above all maimes reason in to heaven. and there shall ye find so great
sweetness and so many secret things that no man may know but he only
which has proved and assayed it. if ye will know this by techynge / go to
him yt has proved it by experience or use. And for because that I wretch have
not done all this. I am the more (...) to (...) and tell with my mouth which
with mine heart I may not think. For it is so hye and so secret that it
surmounteth and passes all manner thynkinge. And therefore it behooves me to be
still. and also it is right yt I do so / and not to teache it with my tongue but
to full fill it in work only by grace. Now have ye ye.iii degrees of
conte^placyon. one in creature. another in scripture. and the.iii. of god in
his most sweet nature.

What it is to live honorably / louyngly / fr^n ^ely / and mekoly. Ca. xxxi.
VF (...) after this (...) and (...) than live ye honorably. and yt is the
first part of our sermon that we touched at ye beginning. And after ye shall
study toly uelouyngly and friendly as touching to your neighbor. And yt for to
do ye must put and se^ all your pain and (...) for to lou^ and for to be be
loved. ye oughtor ye shall love all men in god. that is to wit / for goodness
only. and ^ot for the bea^te and fayrnesse of body / or for good singing. nor
for every such manner thing. as strength / or any such corpo rall virtue. For
beauty and: goodiynesse of ^ody / sweet singing and such other bodyly virtues
may by folly be beloved without god. and yet can they not ^e without god. And
therefore to love man i^ god is none other but to love him for such a thing
that may not be be loved without god. as for goodness / rightwysnesse / or
justice / and truth. For / ^or such virtues may ye lo ue no man but that ye
love god. And wha^ yeloue oni man for goodness / justice / and truth / than
love ye (...) in god. For god of all is goodness / (...) and truth. Therefore
if we be good / we shall have no friend but the good. nor no ennemy but the
evil. And therefore should we love the good people because they are good. and
ye evil also because they may be good. and in this manner love ye nothing but
goodness. And than if ye wyil be beloved show your self (...). And if ye
will be amiable I pray you for gods sake receive and take these. iii. things
and keep them without forgetynge. Do that any you commands / and instauntly
requires and prays. Ta ke without grutchynge that any gives to you / and
keep it. (...) and bear ^ere what soever any man says to you. And if ye live
in this manner tha^ live ye louyngly and friendly. After more shall ye study how
ye may live mekely. and for that shall ye know that there be. ii. manners of
humylyte and meke kenesse. The one comes of verite / and the other of charity,
By the knowledge of your self may ye come to ye first manner of humylyte. For by
no manner wise of the world may yese and know your self what ye be in verite.
onelesse that ye be humble and m^ke. The second manner may ye know and hau^ if
ye think often upon ye great humylyte and (...) of our sweet lord Jesus christ.
how he humbled and meked himself which never dydesynne / and that (...)
comes clearly of charity. Now know ye what it is to live honorably /
louyngly / and mekely. that is to say perfitely. Our most ^wete lord Ie su
c^yst so grant us hy^ to honor. to love our n^ygh bour. and to meke our self
/ that we may for our honor be honored. for our love be beloved. and for our
humylyce to be exalted to the joy of heaven / the (...) ^he was ordained and
made ready for us sy^h the beginning of ^he world.

Amen.
