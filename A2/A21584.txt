By the Queen.
THe Queen's Majesty understanding that there be certain persons, having in
times past the office of Ministry in the church, which now do purpose to use
their former office in Preaching and Ministry, and partly have attempted the
same, assembling specially in the City of London in sundry places, great number
of people, wheruppon rises among the common sort not only unfruitful
dispute in matters of religion, but also contention and occasion to break
common quiet: Has therefore according to thauthoritie committed to her highness,
for the quiet governance of al manner her subjects, thought it necessary to
charge and command, like as hereby her highness does charge and command, all
manner of her Subjects, as well those that be called to ministry in the church,
as al others: that they do forbear to preach or teach, or to give audience
to any manner of doctrine or preaching, other then to the Gospels and Epistels,
commonly called the Gospel and Epistel of the day, and to the Ten
commandments in the vulgar tongue, without exposition or addition of any
manner sense or meaning to be applied or added, or to use any other manner of
public Prayer, Rite or Ceremony in the church: but that which is already
used and by law received, or the common Letany used at this present in her
Majesty's own Chapel, and the Lords prayer, and the Creed in English, until
consultation may be had by Parliament, by her Majesty and her three estates of
this Realm, for the better conciliation and accord, of such causes as at
this present are moved in matters and ceremonies of Religion.

THE true advancement whereof to the due honor of almighty God, the increace
of virtue and godlynes with universal charity and concord among her people,
her Majesty most desires and means effectually by all manner of means
possible, to procure and to restore to this her Realm. Whereunto, as her
Majesty instantly requires all her good faithful and loving subjects to be
assenting and ayding with due obedience: So, if any shall disobediently use
them selfs to the breach hereof, her Majesty both must and will see the same
duly punyshed, both for the qualite of thoffence, and for example to all
others neglecting her Majesty's so reasonable commandment. Yeuen at her
highness palais of Westminster, the.xxvij. day of December, the first year of
her Majesty's reign.

God save the Queen.
