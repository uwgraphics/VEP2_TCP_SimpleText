By the King.
Having occasion at this time to deliberate upon diverse great and weighty
affairs highly tending to the continuance and further settling of the peaceable
government and safety of this Our Kingdom, whereof God has given Us the
charge, We have thought good, according to the laudable Custom of Our
Progenitors, to crave the advice and assistance herein of Our well affected
Subjects, by calling a Parliament, to begin upon the sixteenth day of January
next; And though there were no more to be had in consideration, but the present
face of Christendom, so miserably and dangerously distracted at this time,
besides a number of other great and weighty affairs, that We are to resolve
upon, We have more then sufficient reason to wish and desire, (if ever at any
time, especially at this) that the Knights and Burgesses that shall serve in
Parliament, be, according to the old Institutions, chosen of the grauest,
ablest, and best affected minds that may be found. And therefore out of the
Care of the Common good, whereof themselves are also participant, We do
hereby admonish all Our loving Subjects that have votes in the Elections, that
Choice be made of persons approved for their sincerity in Religion, and not of
any, that is noted either of superstitious blindness one way, or of turbulent
humors another way, but of such as shall be found zealous and obedient children
to this their Mohter Church.

And as to Knights of Shires, That they cast their eyes upon the wortheiest
men, of all sorts of Kinghts and Gentlemen, that are Guides and Lights of
their Countries, of good experience, and great integrity, Men that lead an
honest and exemplary life in their Counties, doing Us good service therein, And
no Bankrupts or discontented Persons that cannot fish but in troubled waters:
And for the Burgesses, That they make choice of them that best understand the
State of their Countries, Cities, or Boroughs, And where such may not be had
within their Corporations, then of other grave and discreet men, fit to serve
in so worthy an Assembly. For We may well foresee, how ill effects the bad
choice of unfit men may produce, if the House should be supplied with
Bankrupts and necessitous persons that may disire long Parliaments for their
private protections, Or with young and unexperienced men that are not ripe and
mature for so grave a Council, Or with men of mean qualities in themselves,
who may only serve to applaud the opinion of others on whom they depend, Or
yet with curious and wrangling Lawyers, who may seek reputation by stirring
needless questions: But We wish all Our good Subjects so to understand these
Our admonitions, as that We no way mean to bar them of their lawful
freedom in election, according to the fundamental laws and laudable custom
of this Our Kingdom, and especially in the times of good and settled
government.

Given at Our Court at Theobaldes the sixth day of November, in the eighteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. 1620.
