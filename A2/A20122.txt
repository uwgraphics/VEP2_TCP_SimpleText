The Noble Acts n^wly found, of Arthur of the Table round.
To the tune of flying Fame.
When Arthur first in Court b^gan,
and was approved King:
By force of Arms great Victories won,
and conquest home did bring:
Then into Britain straight he came,
where fifty good and able
Knights then repaired unto him,
which were of the Round-table.
And many Iustes and Tournaments,
before him there were breast:
Wherein both Knights did then excel,
and far surmount the rest:
But one Sir Lancelot du Lake,
who was approved we^:
He in his sight and deeds of Arms,
all other did excel.
When he had rested him a while,
to play and game and sport;
He thought he would approve himself,
in some aduenturous sort:
He armed rode in Forest wide, and met a Damsel fair,
Who told him of adventures great: whereto he gave good ear.
Why should I not (quoth Lancelot tho)
for that cause came I hither.
Thou seemist (quoth she) ^ Knight right good
and I will bring thee thither,
Whereas the mightiest Knights does dwell
that now is of great fame:
Wherefore tell me what Knight thou art,
and then what is thy name:
My name is Lancelot du Lake.
Quoth she, it likes me than:
Here dwells a Knight that never was
e're matched of any man:
Who has in Prison threescore Knights
and four, that he has won?
Knights of King Arthurs Court they be,
and of the Table-round;
She brought him to a river then,
and also to a tree,
Whereas acopper Basin hung,
his fellows Shields to see,
He stroke so hard, the Basin broke;
When Tarquin heard the sound,
He drove a Horse before him straight,
whereon a Knight lay bound,
Sir Knight (then said Sir Lancelot tho)
bring me that Horse-load hither,
And lay him down, and let him rest,
we will try our force together:
For as I understand, thou have,
as far as thou art able,
Done great despite and shame unto
the Knights of the Round-table,
If thou be of the Table-round,
(quoth Tarquin speedily)
Both thee and all thy fellowship,
I utterly defy.
That's overmuch (quoth Lancelot tho)
defend thee by and by,
They put their spurs, unto their Steeds,
and each at other fly:
They couch their Spears, and Horses run,
as though there had been thunder,
And each stroke there amidst the shield,
wherewith they brake in sunder:
Their Horses backs brake under them,
the Knights were both astound:
To void their horses they made great haste
to light upon the ground:
They took them to their Shields full fast,
their Swords they drue out then:
With mighty strokes most eagerly,
each one to other can,
They wounded were, and bled full sore,
for breath they both did stand;
And leaning on their Swords a while,
quoth Tarquin hold thy hand
And tell to me what I shall ask.
say on quoth Lancelot tho.
Thou art (quoth Tarquin) the best Knight
that ever I did know,
And like a Knight tha^ did hate:
so that that thou be not he,
I will deliver all the rest,
and eke accord with thee.
That is (...) (quoth Lancelot then)
but since it so must be,
What is that Knight thou hate so,
I pray thee show to me:
His name's Sir Lancelot du Lake,
He slew my brother dear:
Him I suspect of all the rest,
I would I had him here.
Thy Wish thou have, but now unknown*
I am Lancelot du Lake,
Now Knight of Arthurs Table-round,
King Hand ^onne of Benwake:
And I defy thee do thy worst,
Ha, ha, (quoth Tarquin tho)
One of us two shall end our lives,
before that we do go:
If thou be Lancelot du Lake,
then welcome thou shall be:
Wherefore, see thou thy self defend,
for now I thee defy.
They hurled them together so,
like two wild Bores, so rashing:
And with their Swords and Shields they ran
at one another lashing.
The ground ^^s^rinkled was with Blood:
Tarquin began to faint,
For he gave back, and bore his Shield
so low he did repent.
That soonee spide Sir Lancelot tho,
he lept upon him then:
He pulled him down upon his knee,
and rushed-off his Helmne:
And then he struck his neck in two,
And when he had done so.
From prison threescore Knight and (...),
Lancelot delivered tho.
