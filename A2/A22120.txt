By the King.
A Proclamation for the due execution of Forest Laws.
FOr that great numbers of Dear both Red and Fallow, have been destroyed by
the last great Frost and Snow, and those that remain and have escaped the
hardness of weather, have been so weakened and surfeited by the extremity of
cold, so as they will hardly hold out this next Winter; And therefore all good
means is to be used to preserve and sustain them; whereof one principal is,
that pawnage be not consumed and taken from them, nor that there be any
surcharge or other wronging of the grounds, which may scant them of their
feed: We do therefore straightly charge and command, that all the Laws and
Ordinances of the Forest, concerning the restraint of Swine, and the ringing
of them according to the Customs of the Forest, be striefly observed and put
in execution, in all Our Forests, Chases and Parkes whatsoever; Willing and
commanding Our Justices in Air on both sides Trent, Lieutenants, Rangers,
Fosters, Verderours and Keepers, that they take care to see this Our Royal
Commandment duly executed, and all other Our Subjects likewise to take notice
of the same, That they do not offend therein; upon pain unto Our said
Officers of loss of Office, and to every Offendour, of Imprisonment, and other
punishment according to Our Laws in that behalf.

Given at Theobalds, the sixteenth day of September, in the thirteenth yeereof
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and
fourtieth.
God save the King.
