A Proclamation for preventing of the abuses growing by the unordered Retailing
of Tobacco.
WHereas the Plant or Drugge called Tobacco scarce known to this Nation in
former times, was in this Age first usually brought into this Realm in small
quantity, as Medicine, and so used, and by diverse taken as Medicine, but in
process of time, to satisfy the inordinate appetite of a great number of men
and women it has been brought in in great quantity, and taken for wantonness
and excess, provoking them to drinking and other inconveniences, to the great
impairing of their healths, and deprauing of their manners, so that the care
which His Majesty has of his people has enforced Him to think of some means
for the preventing of the evil consequence of this immoderate use thereof. And
albeit His Majesty's dearest father of blessed memory had given directions
therein, as well by Proclamation as otherwise, yet those ways took not so
good effect as was desired, for that therein was no restraint of the number of
those that should sell Tobacco by retaile, nor care taken of the quality of
those that should make such sale, but Uictuallers, Tauerners, Alehousekeepers,
Tapsters, Chamberlaines, Hostlers and others, of the meanest condition have
promiscuously used to regrate the same as allurements to other naughtiness,
keeping therein no Assize, to the prejudice of the rest of His Majesty's loving
Subjects. For repressing therefore of all such excesses and for preventing of
future inconvenience, Our Sovereign Lord the King, by the advice of the Lords
and others of His Privy Council has resolved to reduce the venting, selling
and uttering of Tobacco into some good order, and that none but men of
sufficiency, and such as shall bring certificate of their meetnesse, shall
hereafter sell or utter any Tobacco by retaile. And to that purpose His
Majesty has lately caused Letters from His Lords, and others of His Privy
Council to be directed unto the Justices of Peace of the several Counties of
this Kingdom, and Dominion of Wales, and also unto the Majors, Bailiffes and
other chief Officers of diverse Cities and Towns Corporate; Commanding them to
certify in what Towns and places it may be fit to suffer selling and
retailing of Tobacco, and how many in each place were fit to be licensed to
use that Trade. In answer of which Letters, Certificates have been made from
diverse of the Justices of Peace, and from the Majors, Bailiffes, and other
Magistrates of diverse Cities and Towns Corporate, who therein have
acknowledged the abuses that daily arise by the ungoverned selling and
retailing of Tobacco, expressing their desire of reformation.

Whereupon His Majesty by like advice of his Counsel has caused other Letters
to be directed to the Justices and Conseruators of the Peace in several
Counties; thereby declaring in what Towns and places Tobacco shall be
permitted to be sold or uttered by Retayle, and has Commanded the said
Justices and Conseruators of the Peace, to cause the names of those Towns and
places specified in those Letters, to be written and affixed in public places
where the Assizes and Sessions of the peace shall be kept, in those Counties,
to the end that all His people may take notice that other places are not
admitted or allowed for selling or uttering of Tobacco by Retaile. And by
Letters directed to the said Majors, Bayliffes, and other head Officers of
Cities and Towns, His Majesty has given notice unto them of the names of
those that are permitted there to sell or deliver Tobacco in that manner, and
has Commanded them to give public notice in the said Cities and Towns, of
the names of those persons that are so admitted to sell or deliver it.

Now our said Sovereign Lord the King does straightly prohibit all His
people, that after the feast of Candlemas next coming after the date of these
presents, none of them out of the said Cities or Towns so appointed as
aforesaid, or within the said Cities, or Towns, no others but those named as
aforesaid, and such as from time to time shall be permitted in like manner,
do sell or deliver any Tobacco by Retayle, and that none of them that are
permitted or allowed in this behalf, keep any Tavern, Alehouse, or
Uictualling, or otherwise sell any distilled or hot Waters, Wine, Ale, Beer,
or Cider in their houses, so long as they shall be permitted to sell Tobacco
by Retayle: And for that the necessities of these times require it, His
Majesty does charge and command all His Subjects to obey these His Ordinances,
under the pains to be inflicted upon contemners of the same, and of His
Royal will and pleasure, being for the good of His people: All which His
pleasure is shall be observed until He shall by His Proclamation, or Letters
of His Privy Counsel make other public signification of His pleasure
herein. And He does charge and command all Justices of Peace, and all Majors,
Bayliffes, and head Officers of all His Cities and Towns within His said
Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, and all those who are permitted to
sell Tobacco by Retaile, that they make diligent inquiry of all those that
shall presume to do against this Command, and from time to time to make
certificate of their names, and places of their residence, with the particular
of their contempts, to the Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council.

Given at the Court at Whitehall the thirteenth day of October, in the ninth
year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord CHARLES by the grace of God King of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. God save
the King.
