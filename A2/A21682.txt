necessary considerations, should be suspended and prorogued from the xxix. of
September last, until the xv. of March next following, and then to be renewed
again: whereby it is also ordered, that both her Majesty, and the said king,
her good brother, should cause the same suspention and prorogation, to be

to all her Subjects, and to the Subjects belonging to the said king, that they,
and every of them, may use and continue the manner of their intercourse and
traffic of Marchaundize, betwixt her Majesty's dominions, and the countries
of the said king of Spain, in like sort and manner as heretofore they have
done, until such time as further order shall be taken by both their Majesty's.
