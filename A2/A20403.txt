Here aftir Folowith the Prologe of this present volume*




FOrasmoche as Isidore wytnessith in his first book de summo bono ca.iiii. that
almighty god shewith to us by example and consideracyon of things
circomscripte and of knowyn kind. Part of such things as be incircumschripte
/ and cannot plainly be understand or knowin that by euidente knowledge of
things that be in appare^ce / the more rypely we mow comprehend the inward
meanyge / that outward plainly shewith not. and by ye same path that man erryd
from God / he may be ruducyd and return to him again / and as he was pluckyd
by his own concupiscens and inordinate love of the creature / from the great
love of his lord and maker. So by inspeccyon of the creat beawte of creaturys
he owith to be refourmyd and to give lawde and worship to the incomparable
creator and maker of al thing / and thowghe it be so that as this book
faynith / these creaturis speak not to us with mouth and voice fourmyd
nevertheless by inclynacyon / and propirte of natural institucyon they sece
not to teache us to corecte owr manners and amend our living / the which the
gloryows light of all doctowris saint Augustine wytnessith for he says in his
wrytinge. O lord God says he / all thy Creaturis which thou haste made / cry
to me and sece not that I owe to love the my lord god and maker above all
other thing / and therefore the author and compositor of this Book for our
wholesome erudicyon and learning to avoid sloth and sluggysshnesse and to
inbuce the minds of the herers to quyknesse and devotion / has compylyd this
tretys that the more esyly we mow understand the moral sense includyd in the
same.

Thus endith the Table Christ with beast
Of the Son and the Moon. Dialogus Primus.


AFter the Philosofers sayng / the Son is the Iye of the world / the gladness
and the Iocundyte of the day / the beawtye of Heuyn / the mesure of times / ye
vertewe and origynall of all things growing / the lord of all planettys /
the ledar and perfectoure of all planettys and sterrys. The Moon also as says
Ambrose in Eyameron / is the beawtye of the night / mother and mynistre of all
humors / mesure of all times / gyder of the Sea / chaunger of the air /
follower of the son. And forasmoch as she is most like unto the son / upon a
time she began to detracte and diffame the son / the which he perceyuyng
spoke to the moon and said? Why doyst thowe bak byte me and blasfemyst me / I
have ever geuyn the light and goon before the to thy profit / and thou hate
me and malicyously malignest against me. Go from me quod the Moon for I love
the not. For thy great brightness cawseth me to be set little store by in the
world. For and thou were not / I should be in great dignite The Son answered
and said. O thou vncurteys creature / be thou content with thy degree. For as I
shine in the day time and bear than the rule / So thou without impediment
occupyest all the night at thine own pleasure. Let us therefore mekely obey unto
our maker / and exalte not thy self by pride / but suffer me patiently to do
as I am ordained / and do thou thy duty. The moon considering no reason / in
great anger departed and gaderyd together all the sterrys / and began batell /
and shot arowes against the Son / and entendyd utterly with dartis and arowes
to smite him and destroy him. The Son being above and at a vauntage seeing
all this cruelnes / drew out his sword and smote the Moon a sonder. And
threw down the Sterrys and said / As oftyn as thou art rownde / I shall
depart the. For this cawse as fables report / the moon conceyueth not townde
/ and sterris often times fall down. And so the moon was confused and said.

Less hurt is to the stryuer / to be parted in twain
Then to be all lost / and brought unto vain.
SO in like wise much people being inflate and blowe^ up with pride and elacion
/ would be like unto ye so^n and have domynacion above all other / and by their
wyllys would yt none were above the^ / nor like unto the^ / as the gloss faith.
Pride is a bre^nyng eleuacyon in ye mind. dispysing them yt be under / and
would be equal with them that be above / for why As Crisostom says / desire of
exaltacyo^ / is great syn / and utterly to be dispysed / and suffra^ce is
worshipful and commendable. It is written and said that the proud people be
lift up on height / because their fall should be the mor grievous / For he that
falls but low may sone arise as ye Poet says. But he yt falls from on
high / may not so esely be restored to health Branches of a tree growing allow
/ be conyued from te^pesiys / as writes Crisostom. But they that be on high be
oftyn times broken and in great ieoperdye. Wherefore quintus Curcius says / that
a serteyn person said unto king Alexander that a tree being of great heyght /
may ye sooner be blowe^ up by the rote. And though a Lion be mighty and proud
yet be small birds fed with his flesh. A Philosofer came to the Tomb of
Alexander and said / yesterday to this man suffysed not all the world. Now is
he suffysed with the space of.vij. foot long. And therefore pride is to be
reprouyd. etc.

Of Saturn and the Cloud Dialogo. Secundo.


PHilosophers write that there be.vij. Planetis. That is to say / Saturn /
Jupiter. Mars. Sol. Venus. Mercurye. and Luna. But there is great space between
planet and planet For as Moses greatest of philoforhers reherseth and says /
and also it is written in ye goldyn legende / that every compass of every
planet has in thiknes ye way of.v.c years / that is to mean / as much space
as a man may journey and walk iv.c. yerys so that daily his journey extendid
to xl. miles / and every mile to be^e in length ij. M. pace. Upon a time a
great thycke cloud began to exalt her self and said. Mine excellency is great
/ for I may by interposicio^ of my gretnes cawse that other planetis may not
show the^self in ye world but at my will. Seeing that I am under other
planetis and may do so much / if I were exalted higher / then might I do much
more. And thus this cloud prowdly asce^did upward till she I am to saturn.
Saturn seeing this cloud presumptuously aplyng to go above him / was sore
greuid and said unto her / what art thou that couetyst with pride to ascend
there as neuyr man came. I shall ascend above the quod the cloud / and
ouuerthrowe the. That heryng Saturn and fore mouyd / ordained harneys and
wepyn / and stoppid fast the way / and threw down the clowd and destroyde him
for euyr and said.

He that couyteth to be above all.
Noforce though he have a foul fall.
SO befell it to Nabugodonosor which desirid to be above all other kings and
princes / and to be called king of all Kings / and Lord of all lordis. For
pride not considering that almighty god has domynacion above all erthly
lordships as it is specifyed Danyel.iiij. Wha^ the heart of Nabugodonosor was
lift up be pride / wherefore he was deposid from his dygnyte / whereof it was
said unto him. The dwelling of the shall be among wild beastis / and god shall
eiect the / and cast the owte fro ma^nys company / and thou shall ete hay like
an ox and.vij. seasons shall be changed over the. It is written in Hystory
scolasticall that Nabugodonosor was not chanuged into a beast unreasonable by
mutacion and chanuge of the body but by mutacion and alienacio^ of his wit
and reason / and also the eloque^cie of his speech was taken from him / and he
semyd him self that in his forlymmes of his body he was like to an ox or a
bull / and in his hinder parties he thought himself to be like a lion. Danyell
also / all the time of his alienacion prayde for him so heartily / that the.vij.
seasone / that is to say.vij. years by his prayers were changed in to.vij.
monethis. In the which.vij. monethis the space of.xl. days. he had great in
firmy te and disease. Other.xl. days within the said.vij. monethis he
retournyd to his mind / and prayde with great mepynge so largely that his iyen
were turned in to rednes / and like unto raw flesh. Manyon went to have a
sight of him / a stir that.vij. monthis were fully complete and fulfyld / He
was Reuokyd and called again unto his first estate / but he regnyd not
inmediatly / for there were ordained, vij. Iuges / and so he co^tynued in
abstinence and penance unto the end of.vij. years never etige bred nor
flesh / nor drank wine in all that long season.

Of a Sterre called Transmontana / and other sterrys Dialogo Tercio.


A Sterre which is called Tra^smo^tana stands ever fix in the nauyll of the
Heuyn / and gothe never to declyne / nor labors not by compass circuler as
other sterrys does. It is as a mark or a path of the sea / to the which
shypmen give great attendance. All other sterrys gadryd them togeder and came to
this sterre and said Thou sit always still and haste eas and rest / and we
go about and labor without rest and be thy servants. arise thou a while and
let an other be souerayn and occupy thy rome. To whom this sterre Tra^smonteyn
answered and said / ye know not what ye would have / for your desire is not
lefull nor to you expedient / For I have great labor and great fatigacyon to
rule you. And if I did not wisely conserve you in your places and mocyons / ye
should greatly err for lack of a good gyder. Wherefore I counsel you to be
content and in peace. But the other sterris would not be pleasyd / but rather
more wylfuller to have their peticyon / and said all at onys. We pray the to
suffer us to chose an other gyder. Trasmontayn than beholdynge their froward
wylfulnes / departed from them / and went and complained to his lord and
maker. The sterrys that seeing / made great exultacyon and gladness / and aplyed
the^ to make election of a new gyder. but therein they cowde not agree / but
fell at varyance and began to fight each with other / and as sheep lacking a
shepherde / they erryd and fell out of good rule. at last when they concidered
the felicyte that they were in sometime by the policye and good gydinge of their
sovereign / and the great myserie yt was fallen to them for lack of him. They
fell in repentance and came to their first gyder and prayde him to take them to
grace and to rule them as he had done before / and confirmed him in his worship
/ and said all with one voice.

The gyder that gydeth / with vertewe and grace
Should never be changed / lest a worse have his place
EVyn so it is conuenyent for us to do when we have a good ruler the which
rightfully rules and gydeth us / we be bownde to love him / and to do him
honor and worship / and not lightly to change him / but cherysshe him after
our power for the great labor that he has to gyde us for our well. The degree
of governance is called great worship / but it is a great charge / as Barnard
says / what is worship or power / but a great bourden and miserye. Or what is
sublimyte or dignyte of the world but a perylous and doubtful tempest. Who
may be in worship or prelacye without pain or tribulacyon. Or who is in dignyte
without vanyte / as Valery tells. lib.vii. of a King that was of so great
wit and so great counsel / that when ye Crown was delivered to him he held
it long between his hands or he set it upon his head / and consideringe it
well and said. O noble and fortunable garlonde / how full of besynes and
peryllart thou / Innumerable to be told. For as Augustyne says. There is no
thing more laboryous / more hard / nor more perylous / than is to have great
domynacyon or seignyorye. and therefore Valerius does show unto us in
Libro.vii. of Corneli scipion / that when Spayn was fallen unto him / he
answered and said he would not go thither / and showed the cawse why / For he
cowld not do equite and right wysnes. For he thought him self not co^nynge ne
sufficyent to so great a worsship / and so great a peril togeder.



Of the Even sterre and the morrow sterre. Dialogo. Quarto.
VEsperus is called the night sterre / and Lucifer the day sterre / which
apperith in the morning. These two sterrys / gadryd togider all other sterrys
and went with one assent to the creator and maker of all sterrys / and made
unto him their sapplicacyon and said / Gracious Lord thou art a good maker /
and we therefore thank the / for thou haste ordeynyd and bestowyd us in the
best wise. But for this cawse we be trowblyd that owre beawte and brightness is
not always showed. Therefore lord we mekely beseech the / to take the light
fro the (...) make him dark that owre bryghtnes in the (...) time may appear
and be showed. To whom the lord and maker answered and said your peticion is
not lawful for the son is the garnyssher of the day / The distrybutour of
howrys / the Orygynall of all things growing / and without him no thing may
encreace. Therefore I wyllnot condescende to your peticion for it is not
exaudible / nor worthy to be alowyd. Wherefore the sterrys seeing they cowlde not
have their desire went ageyn togydre and fourmed a new peticio^ and offeryd it
to their maker and said. O blessid lord and maker of all creatures / we
beseech the at least to dry up and put a way the clowdis out of the air the
which let our bright light to be showed For ostyntymes for their lettyng. we
may not apree / nor be knowyn as we be. And therefore lowly we pray the / that
where as our first askyng was denied us / of thy godenes grant us this second
peticion and desire. The lord and maker considering their symples / gave them
this answer with a sad countenance and said. Hold your peace and desire not
unlawful things / for I will not grant them / for it is wryttyn in the book
of Caton / Ask that is righfull / and that yt semyth honest. ye clouds be
necessary though ye think contrary For they with their rayn moyste^ therth If
no rain should fall the earth cowde not be fruitful and with this answer he
put the sterrys from their desire and said thus in this wise.

That peticion may Justly be denied
Which at no time to Reason is applied.
MAn by this example it apereth that he that will be herd in his prayers or in
his supplicacion / must ask the things that be rightful / honest and
reasonable to be granted. Wherefore saint Austyn says / when ye ask the
things which god laudeth and promyseth / the^ is your asking sure / for yt
peticyo^ is sone granted of god Therefore Isyder says true. Many men praynge /
be not herd in their askyng. For god grants them better and more for their
wealth / then they desire. Seneca tells in ye ij. book of benefits / yt a
^teyn person on a time asked j. d. of Alexander / and he gave him an hole
town. And when the peticyoner thanked alexander and said he was not worthy nor
able to receive so great a gift / alexander answered and said natto him. I
retain in my mind what becomes ye to ask / but what becmoth me to give So
almighty god does / for oftentimes he grants not our askyng / becawse he will
auaunce our peticyon with a better / and more profitable reward. And therefore
says Isidor. Some times god hereth not many folks to their pleasure. for he
will gracyously here them to their more profit and health.

Of ye Raynbowe / and a sign called Cancer. Dial.v.


Our Lordys bow / after the first Flode apered in the Clouds having two
colors / that was waterye and fyrye. signifyenge the Judgment coming. which
bow apered by the space of.xl years after the byldynge of the Arc As it is
said History Scolasticall. Cancer is one of the signs of Heuyn / and this
word cancer is Eqniuocum / and has many signyficyons / But notwihstandyng /
here it betokens the sign of Heuyn And so this sign Canrer went unto the
Raynbowe in a great anger and said. Thou art to bold / for all heuyn is little
enough for the / in so much that thou besyest the to let me of my course /
and other sterrys that should occupy there. Wherefore I advise the to be removed
lightly or else thou shall be surely coryed of me and my company The bow
answered and said. Brother thou spekest not well / for I am not about to let ye
of thy way / for I show my self but in the day time / and thou in the night
ro^nest where plesith the. Wherefore me thi^keth if thou entend to fight with me
/ thou art evil aduysed for this cawse / For thou may gader great company of
sterrys to hold with the. And I have frendys ynow / both clouds and also great
thonders for to fight against the for all thy strength / and so there may
grow great myschefe. But I will cownsell the for the best / that (...) goo
before a rightwys Judge that he may termyn thy questyon by a diffinytyf sentence
/ and let the fawte be punysshed there as it is / whereto cancer agreed. and
when they both were before ye presence of the Judge / and had showed there unto
him their matter / The Judge spoke than and said thus. Thou wicked Cancer / it is
against the law or reason all ye prehemynence yt thou ask and desyrest of
the bow. If thou have thy will and walking in ye night time / and the bow but
only in the day tym / how may it be credyble that he lets thy way. Therefore
this is my sentence ageyn the. I will and charge the that thou never apere in
the day time. And I condemn the in all expencys and costys of the court.
Cancer herynge this sentence / was greatly ashamyd and said.

A besy man / that is full of questyon.
Cawseth to him self / often great confusyon.
MAny one in like wise against Law and Reason sometime will strive and fall at
alteracy on with out occasyon / and be full of questyons. wherefore they be
takyn for wra^gelers and evil people / and often times they be iuged to the
worst. Of such it is written. Prouerbi.xvi. A wrayward man cawseth stryues.
And a man full of wordys / overcomes pryncis. The evil man ever seeks
debate. The bad angel and cruel / is sent against him / Truly through
questyo^s and stryues / many one be brought to naught. as Isider says / as
love and co^corde is always by loynge / so strife and debate / is evermore
destroynge. Bid says. By discord the gretest things may be distroyed. There
was somtym an honest man that had three sons / which when he should dye / he
called them before him and said. Fet me a great many of wa^dys bownde together /
and so they did. And when they were brought he said to his children / fold
them and break them. But they cowde not they were so styf. To whom the fader
said ageyn / pluck out one of them and break all the other. And they assayed
to do so. And they might well bow them / but they cowd not break them. The
third time the fader spoke and said to them / take one alone and asay to
break that / which they sone destroyed and brake a sonder. Then said he to them
in this wise / Children / thus shall yt fall unto you / If that ye do contynewe
together in love and concord / no man shall be able lightly to hurt nor
distroye you. But if ye varye and be divided by dyscorde Every man shall
preuayll esely against you / and distroy you / and put you under foot / and
therefore beware of malice and discord.

Of Heuyn and of Earth. Dialogo.vi.


OF diverse Philosofers ye sayng is / that the earth is ye myddell part of ye
world The conseruer of frutis. The couerige of hell. The noryssher of all
quycke things. The mother of all growing things / The con^uatrice of life /
and the swalower of all things. Upon a time Heuyn sent down to the Earth here
many great tempestys / of rayn / of thonder / and of lightening. whereby he
greuyd ye earth very sore. when she was angry and greatly displesed she called
the air to her and said / brother air I pray the me dyll not between heuyn
and me For mine intent is utterly fiyced to overthrow him / for he has done
great wrong and injury unto me / that I hope to be avenged upon him with such
ways as I can find. To whom the air answered and said. Do not so suster /
but let thy wra the pass For though it be so that heuyn have grieved the now /
another time ye shall be frendys and make merry together. The earth being blind
and ouercom with anger would not cese / but ran and caught harneys and began to
fight with heuyn. That seeing ye air raised up great darkness / and brought
forth great clouds / and cawsed so great thyknes / that the earth cowde not
discern where heuyn was. And yt contynewed so long / till the wrath and
wodnes was clean gone. Than after that the air sent out wyndes and purged the
country / and drove away the mystes and darknessys / and made all clear and
said.

Of Ire and malice / to do out the flame /
we be all bownde / and not norysshe the same.
EVery man ought so to do when he seyth his fre^dis and neighbors wroth
togider. For after the saying of Caton / Ire and wrath lets the mind that
it may not discern truth. For a man that is angry is past his mind / and
therefore he is to be temperatly gyded and refrayned by his frendys till he be
removed from that wodenes / and till wrath in him be endyd. For Seneca says.
The beginynge of wysdom is to moderate Ire and wrath for he that overcomes
wrath / does overcome his greatest ennemy / as Valeri tells when Archita
tarencius was greuyd with his servant he said unto him. O thou unhappy creture
now would I corect the / if I were not at this time wroth with the. Whereby it
apperet that Ire and malice is to be voyded out of the mind. For as it is
said in the book of prouerbis.xxvij. Ire has no mercy. Therefore a Judge
ought never to give Sentence while he is angry. Wherefore it is read in
Histories of Romans that Theodosius the Emperor was oftyntymes prompt and
dysposed to do cruel execucyon. But there was a wise man yt gave him cownsell
that when he felt him self greuyd and angry / or ever he gave any sentence he
should say and rehearse softly within himself xxiij. letters of the.a.b.c. that
his mind might be refresshed / and so to muse what was best to be done. and
that he might the more rypely se and know what Judgment ought rightwisly to be
given with good discrecyon and deliberacyon.

Of the air / and the wind. Dailogo.vij.


Know ye as the Philosofre says / that Air is the Spiracle of all things
living without whom all thing is sone choked / and dies that is living.
The wind also is ye dryer of the earth / the mouer of watres / and trowbler of
the Air. And becawse he is trowbler of the air / the air cawsed him to be
Cited before the high Judge and maker of al things and said. O mighty lord
and maker of all thing / Look upon me I beseech the and have mercy upon me.
Thou have ordained me sufficyently / and indewyd me with great priuylege.
wherefore I give lawde and thank unto the. For thou haste made me to be life of
all things / But for this cawse. I am greatly trowbled and vexed with the wind
/ For he ever makes me cold and cawseth me to be intemperate Therefore I say
to him / if ever from hensforth he presume to blow upon me / I will choke him
and put him from his life. To whom the maker answered and said / Air thou
spekest not well / Though the wind make the cold and beat the with his blast
/ Nevertheless he yeldeth the purged and temperat / If it so were that the
wind blewe not on the / thou sholdest be seek and corrupt both tedyous and
hateful to every man. wherefore thou ought to love him yt con^ueth the in
good estate / and so the air was pleased and said.

Correctours that correct us for our own good
we ought to love / and to suffer with a glad mood.
SO every Creature ought to love them that corect them and shows the^ their
fawts and ente^de toreduce them to goodness and to ye way of truth / For truly
the seek man that denies to drink the bitter drink that his leche gives him
will not suffer him self to be cured / and so he shall never be delivered from
his sebenes. And he that hatyth his corectoure / shall not be weldyrected
Verelye a man louith not his leche / when he will not suffer him that rebukyth
him for his good. But true it is that Chrysostom says. He shall have hatrede
that repreueth the sinful. And Seneca says. He sekyth a blame to him self /
that rebukith the wicked man. Such be not wisemen. but rather they be folys /
as says Ecclesiastes. A wyseman louyth to be rebukyd / but a fool is wroth if
he be corecte. Therefore corecte a wyseman and he shall love the. Proverb.ix.
Hitte is wryttyn in the life of saint Ambrose / that when Theodosius the
Emperowr had punyshed diverse and dwellers of that country withowte delyberation
and judgment. Ambrose the Archebisshope of mylene expulsyd him owte of ye
church / although he was a very Christen Emperowr And when the Emperowre knew
itte / he said to Ambrose. David comyttyd both adulterye and manslaughter. And
Ambrose answerde. If thou have folowyd him in his errowre / follow also the
penance of him. The Emperowre that herynge / was very contryte inwardelye and
did great penance and said. I have found a man of trowth Ambrose the
Bysshope. And so the Emperowr ordained that nomanshulde be iugid to death
withowte.xl. days of respyghte / that Ire might be swagyd and the mind might
be the more clear that rightwysnes might be seen in geuynge of judgment.

Of the sea bankys and the sea Dialogo.viij.


The sea is the halser of the world / the well of al showrys / and the
lodginge place of all floodys as the Philosofre says. For as it is wryttyn
Ecclesia stici primo. Al floodes enter the sea and he yeldith them not again.
And the flodes return to the place that they came fro / that they should slow
again. This see is great and large as it is wrytyn in the Psalm.ciij. And so
the sea by his magnificence and great power went to the bankys and said. I
marvel greatly of thy hardness and of thy styf heart. Thowe art euyr contrary
to me and with stondist me and lettyst me that I may not ete the earth and
consume it as I would do. Wherefore I desire the to be removed fro thy place /
that I may prevail again the earth and put him underfoot or else. I shall
notte cese to war on the and put the to great trowble. To whom the bank
answered and said. It is evil said brodir. For the maker of all thing has
ordained me so / and I suffer great labor infrayning the for ye obedience yt I
owe to him. Thou comyst upon me oftyn times and puttist me to great gref. I
bear ye and suffer ye pacyently for ye love of god / therefore thowe owyst not
to multiplye unkind wordis again me for I may not change my place. This hering
ye see answered in great wodenes / and thou may suffer tha^ / suffer still for
I shall neuir let ye to be i^ peace. but I shall beat and punysh ye with all my
power. The ba^k paci^tly put hi self under yt yocke of obedience. and said thus.

Godemen may both Chyde and fight.
And punysh them that does not right.
EVery prelate and rular owith to be manlye and resist them that be sinful yt
they prevail not. Nevertheless Gregory says. As ye see euir rebellyth and
repugnith again ye bankys by whom it is refrained and kept In likewise some
personys in relygion euir rebel again there prelatis. which can not coarte them
nor bring them to godenes. But good shepeherdis need not to dread ye malicyous
thretyngis of the^ yt be badde. But rathr like as a wakyng shepeherdeis wont
to keep his sheep from cr^el beastis / so good curatisowe to be diligent to
co^s^rue there flock from peryshing. Therefore says Isidir. Evil shepeherdis
take no head of there sheep. but as it is read in the Euangely of the^ yt be but
hyrid men which take no great charge of ye flock / for and if they see ye wolf
cominge anon they flee. When fle they away. Certainly when they be still and
dare not speak before the^ yt be mighty and of power / and when they be tymerous
and fereful to with stand the^ yt be synful and evil disposyd. Therefore Iherom
comfortith us and says / let us intend to please god / and as for ye thretinge
of man / we shall not need to care. Petrus Come or tellith yt there was a king
of Macedone called philippe / and he be segid a cite called Athenis / and at
last he spoke to the^ of ye cite and said. Deliver me.x. orators such as I
shall chese among you / and Ishal be cdfedrid with you / and go my way The
most wise Creature called demostenes answered to the king and said. wolves
on a time spoke to the shepheerdis and said. All the discord between you and
us cawseth yowr doggis if ye entende to be at one with us / deliver us yor dogs
and we shall be frdndys for euyr. And when they had so done / The woluys at there
own will deuowryd the sheep. Be the which example hitte aperyth how great
perell hitte is when doggis by whom is vndirstonde prechowrs and Curatis
forsake there flockys and be negligent to bark and preche again sin. For as
softnes is laudable in manner and ire is reprouable / so is it contrary in a
dog. For a soft dog is not good / but rathir more to be cherisshed for
his fiersnes in time needful. And so discreate fiersnes is comendable in him
that has cure and charge of sowlys etc.

Of Fire and watyr Dialogo.ix.


THe fire is light. Pure. Subtle. Moneable. Bright and warm. And for it is
so precious he conceyuyd a pride and sublymacyon in him self and said. I
prevail in the earth upon all other thing and consume all thing. but and I
might prevail in the watyr / than should I be exaltyd myghtyly above all thing
/ and for this cawse he called the watyr to him and said. Most dear suster I
know well yt thou art an elemente of goddis as I am. Wherefore if I were
dwellinge with the and conjoined to the I should apere the gretter and of more
excellency. Wherefore I pray the suffir me to dwell with the and to rejoice in
the. The watyr subtelly began to make symulacyon and said Long have I desired
to be at this rest with the. Come to me surely and I shall auaunce the bettyr to
my power This herynge the fire was merry and iocunde and frendely entryd in to
the watyr. The watyr said whyl she had the fire within her to them that stood
beside. This is mine enymy and contrary of my kind. He has oftyn times
consumyd me and brought me to naught. Now I may be vengyd and destroy him if
me list. But aftir the counsel of the Apostle. I will not do oon shrewyd turn
for an othyr. And also the world shall not lose so necessary a thing be the
meanys of me / Nevertheless some what I will abate his pride and make him
lower. and thus saying the watyr began to gadre her self togidyr and to piss
in the fire. And a none the fire began to speak fair and prayde the watyr to
destroy him notte utterly. The watyr was merciful to the fire and did not
put him out clean. butte conueyde him to the earth and said in this manner*

Goddis pleasure he does fulfill
That yeldith a good turn for an ill.
NOw it is so that manyon does contrary / and does one shrewyd turn for an
other / and be wylfull to take vengeance and will not forgive offencis done to
them wherefore Jerome says. As god has forgyuen owr sins in Christ / so we
must forgive them that offend us / and so the following of the example of god
/ reuokith and brekith the iniurye done to us / consyderinge yt criste
patiently suffirde and forgave. So we must be sufferable in aduersyte / and
mekely forgive owr adversaries as it is read in the historys of Alexandre. where
it is shewid yt a sertayne person had so grievously offendyd Alexander that he
would not forgive him. Aristotle that knowing went to Alexander and said my
lord I will that this day thou salt be more victoryous then euir thou were
Alexandyr answered and said. I will. Then said Aristotle. Thou haste subduyd
all the kyngdomys of the world / but now this day thou art overcome. For and
thou be not ruler of thy self then art thou ruled. And if thou rule thy self
than art thou victorious / for he that ouercomith him self is most strong as
says the philosofre. Alexandre herynge this saying of Aristotle. Remyttyd the
offense done and was pleasid. Wherefore it is wryttyn Proverb.xvi. Bettyr is a
pacyent man / than a strong man. And he that has domynacyon ouir him self
then a geter of citees etc.

Of the watyr and the Fire. Dialogo.x.
BRothir said the water unto the Fire. Why be we twayn always contrary and
enymyes. Good it is for us to keep goddis Comaundmentis that says. Thou shall
love the neyboure as thy self. Mat.xxij. For fulfyllinge of the law is love as
says ye Apostle ad Romansxiij. To whom the Fire answered saying. It plesith me
well that thou spekist for the same Apostle wytnessith in the same Chapter.
That love of neybour is profitable and does neuir harm. wherefore let us go and
make owr dwelling togider. And when they were dwelling togider they cowde
neuir accord / for the Fire made the watyr hot and consumyd her. The watyr
oftyntymes qwenchid ye fire wherefore they continuyd euyr in contencyon and
discord For the which cawse they departed asonder and said.

It will not be at one word.
That tway contraryes should kyndely acorde.
ONe that is of good disposicion owith not to dwell with him that is badde /
which is to him contrary for lightly he may lose his godenes / and his good
name and all his good operacyon and workyng / for cause of his evil company /
as a philosofre says. Chese thou good folk and meke that thowe may live
and be good / For it is wryttyn Psalmo.xvii. with a good man thowe shalt be
good / and with a wrayward man thou shall be like him. The apostill
consyderinge that it is perilous to lead the life with bad people. wrote ad
Thessalo.iiij. saying. Bredryn we show unto you in the name of out lord Jesus
Christ / that ye withdraw yowre self from the compeny of every brodir that
walkith inordynatlye for Isidir says. Hitte is perylous to lead owre life with
them that be knowyn bad and sinful / and hit is dought full to be associate
unto them that be of bad mind. A fable is told that heuyn sent dowu fair
watyr to wasshe the earth / and when this watyr should have been lodgid all
night with a colier she said unto him. Brodyr we may not dwell togithyr / for
all that euyr I may cleanse and make clean in the long day time / thowe may
spotte it with blaknes in an owre. So like wise all that euyr a wiseman or a
godeman getyth in long season / a sole or a bad man may destroy in an owre.

Of the floode and the sea. Dialogo.xi.


AS the Philosofre says ye floode is a continual rynnyng / a refresshynge of
the son and moystre of the earth / and at a time of oportunite / the flode
went to the sea that is called Mare in laten and said to him. Thowe art
ryghtfully called mare / yt is bytternes / for thou contynuyst euir in great
bitterness. Is not thy bitterness great and thyn unkindness much more / when
thou continually drinkest of my swetnes and thou euir gyuest to me again
nothing but bytternes. The sea answered and said. Gold and silver have I none.
Such as I have of the best and of the inward party of my body I give unto
the as to my feythfull friend. Therefore thou owyst patiently to suffir my
bytternesse for and if thou look and consydre well / thereof is deryuyd thy most
great swetnesse and thy incomparable goodness. This hearing the floode / was
all pleasyd and said.

Who that desyryth the sweet to Assaye
He must taste byttyr this is no Nay.
Likewise it behouithe every man to suffyr the bittyr scourge of trybulacyon
that desires to have the swetnes of everlasting consolation as Gregory says
Tribulacion is the gate of the kingdom of heuyn. The psalter witnessith the
same, cxvij. where it is thus writtyn / This is the gate of owre lord.
Rightful men shall entyr by it. It is also read. Actu.xiiij. Be many
tribulacions it behouith us to enter in to the kingdom of heuyn. But many on
may be lyknyd to an Ape / the which clymyth into a tree of nottys / and when she
tastithe the owte part that is byttyr / she castith away all ye Remnaunte or
she come to the Cornell / and therefore she tastyth neuyr of the swetnes of the
Notte. So many unwise folkys cast away Tribulacion lightly as sone a^ euyr
they feel itte / and therefore of the swetnes of the heuynly reward which
shall be geuyn to them that pacyently suffyr tribulacyon they shall neuyr taste.
As a sertayn abbotte said when he was blind. I give tha^ king to my lord
God / that has wrokyn me on mine enymye. Which were wonde to do me so much
hurt / that were to me like theuys and traytowres / which would have destroyed
me. I mean my wanton eyn twayn But godde of his grace has now destroyed them.
An othyr Relygyous man made great joy / when he had lost oon of his eyn /
and other folkis made great sorrow for him And he asked of them for which of
his eyes th^i made that heaviness / and they said for that that was owte. And he
answerde and said to them. He that has tway enymyes / if one be destroyed the
othyr is to be drad and not he that is goon redye. Wherefore Iherome says and
wrytyth to a sertayn person. Sorrow thowe notte nor mourn though thowe have
not that flies and serpentis have. For we have seen and knowyn diverse
philosofirs that have wylfully put owte there eyes. Intending to keep there
myndys the bettyr inwardlye and to eschew vanyteys which grow be occasion of
the eyes / and therefore some pain must be suffirde of him that desires
everlasting rest.

Of the Hill and the Valey Dialogo.xii.


A Vale lay low in a sertayne place having to her joined an high mownte which
kept the vale in subieccion / At last this vale grutchid and was sore vexyd
with impacye^ce / and brak owte and multyplyed great wordis again the hill /
and said even thus to him. Thou wicked and Comberows caytyf why greuyst thou
me so long and neuyr secyste. Cece trowbelous wretch of the great greef that
thou doyst to me and change thy place for thou have long kept me under / and if
thou will not I shall be vengid on the. To whom the hill answered and said. Thy
complaynt cannot be reformed as yet For our maker has erect me / and set me
above for the beginning / and he has ordeynd ye to be benethe and under
Therefore be pacie^t and suffir to ye last day of judgment and than shall mowntes
and hills be made law / as wrytith Isaye.xl. But the vale took none head of all this / but in great hastynes brought with her treys and herbys / and began
batell again ye hill / and woundid him sore with shot of arowys and dartys. The
hill seeing yt / began to wax wood with yt vale and said. Of thyn own dedys
I judge the thou shewid servant / for thou art not ashamyd to begin batell
again thy sovereign and thy bettyr. And thus saying the mownte threw down
stonys and all to knockyd the vale and stoppid the ways that she might not
fly nor none of her Company. And so the vale was humilyate subduyd and
brought under with correction and said.

Seruauntis be bownde at all times to obaye.
To there souereygnes and not to say Nay.
MAnyon impacyent repugne again there bettyrs. Wherefore they owe to be hold
vndyr the yocke of service / For it is wryttyn Eccles.xxiiij. Mete correctyo^
and burdone longith to an ass / and lernyge with labor to a servant. While
he workyth with correccyon he sekyth rest. Relece him and he sechyth lyberte.
To an Iuylwyllyd servant longith Correccyn and fettyrs. Send him to his
work that he be not Idyll / set him in besynes / for that becomyth him
best. A sertayne lord sometime had a wraywarde servant and Iuylwyllyd which
when he was Idle he Rebellyde with his wordis again his lord. Wherefore his
Lord beat him myghtyly and kept him from delycyows metys and drynkes and
put him to great labowre / and so with werynes and labowre he was overcome
and feign to amend / and bridle his tongue from such vncurteys langage.
Wherefore it is wryttyn. Prouerbio.xxix. He that dilycatly nourrisshth his
servant in his yowth and brings him so up / aftyrwarde he shall find him
rebel again him / and therefore dew correccyon is to be had.

Of Gemmys and precious Stonys. Dialogo xiij.


Precious stonys and Gemmis came altogidyr and said. we be dearest and best be
louyd to people above all othyr thing. But and if we be fownde esylye in every
place. we shall be abiecte and little price set bye. wherefore let us go hyde
us in far contrays that we lightly may not be found / without great
labowre and cost. For that thing that is dear boughte and with great price
is much set bye / and surely kept. Therefore we will not be much seen. Nor
daily apere to every mannys sight for it is not most profitable unto us aftyr
this proverb that says.

They that will precyows things have and find.
Must plye them to labor both body and mind.
SO the servant of Christ that couetyth and desires to be replete and
fulfilled with precious vertays must aplye him besy lie to exercise hi^ self in
goostly labowre / and be neuir Idyl. For idelnes is enymye to the soul as it
is read in Vitis pa. There was but one fend aboughte to tempte a monk that
was Idle. and a. M. abought an other that was occupied. Therefore Jerome says.
Do euyr some good deed that the devil may find the occupied. A man well
occupied is like unto a Castle that is surely closyd / to the which none
enymye may be noyable / and saint Augustyn says. He is not esily deceyuid of
the find that besylye intendith to good occupacion. Wherefore fadirs and
modirs owith to meue and stere there young Chyldryn to occupation and labowre /
that they fail not of there living be the meanys of slowth. As there was
sometime a wise husbondman / that set a vine / and when he should dye / he told
his chldryn that he had hid great treasoure in ye vyneyerd / but he shewid
the^ not in what place he had hid it / aftir his death his childern began to
delue and to dygge / in ye vyneyerde to find the tresowre / and of that
labowre the vyneyerde was very fruitful and brought for the fruit in the most
plentyuous wise / and so the children perceived well the meanyge of there fadir /
be the tresowre hyd in the vyneyerde was no more to mean / but that the more
they labowryd in the vyneyerde / the more profyght should they have. And they
did so and were co^tynually besy when they had oportunyte and laysar. Also there
was a philosofre that tawght his sone and said. Sone look yt the antte be not
found wiser than thou the which gadryth in the somer somoch and with so besy
labor that she is thereby mayteynyd all the long winter Let not the cok be
waker or stronger than thou / which duly obseruith and kepith his matutynall
owrys / and chastisith him self with betynge excitynge and steryng other be his
good example to do the same. And who is so strong that has so many wyllys
as the Cok has / and kepith them all Chaste and in obedience to him as he does
/ and thou say thou canste not subdue one wy^ to the.

Of the Smaragde and the Ring. Dialogo.xiiij.


SMaragdus is a stone as says brito / to the which there is no thing may be
lykenyd of more grenenesse. For why he transcendith in colowre of grene both
herbis and bowys / and fillyth the Ien but satisfies the^ not as says papie.
A ryng of gold bare in him a precious Smaragde a great while / whereof the
colowre was so plesawnte / that many one came out of far contrays with great
desire to behold hitte. Upon a day the Ring spoke vncurteyslye to the
Smaragde and said Thowe haste long continued / and dwellyde in my stacyon /
and neuyr paydest me / for thy stondynge. wherefore deliver thy dewlye for thyn
habitacyon / and goo thy way. Or I shall take from the all that thowe haste /
and put the owte of thy lodging. To whom the Smaragde said. If I have
long continuyd and dwelled with the. It has rebowndid to thy worship. For
by me thou have be take in great reputacion and worshype. For I have cawsyd the
to be honorably exaltyd and to be put on the kyngis finger / and if thou
wyltenedis expel me / make no delay but sell me / and of my great valowre take
thy duty for my howserent. For I can not lack of habytacyon. And when the
ring had expellyd this precyows stone and dischargid him of his hows. The
ring him self apperyd but bare and abiecte and was not take in reputacyon of
any man. and at the last be repentyd him sore and said.

Example is showed by the stone and the Ring.
That it is vile to be partyd from a worthy thing.
THe servant of Criste is worshypfull in likewise / as long as he retaynyth
and kepith precyows vertewys with in him. And if he cast them from him he is
to be cast away / as Seneca says. A good man is to be prouyd be his dedys /
and so prouyd owyth to be takyn. Upon a time when great Alexander called him
self lord of all the world. Diogenes the phylolofer answered to him and said.
Not so for thowe art no Lord / but servant of one of my seruauntis. For
pride is thy lady and my servant. For she rulyth the and I have destroyed
her. Flesshly lust. Glotonye and Ire be thy ladies and my seruauntis / for
they led the and have do mynacyon ouir the. I have overcome them and put thez
under foot / and therefore verylye thou art but a seruante of one of my
seruauntis. And when the seruauntis of Alexander that hard this / would have
fall upon ye Philosofre and have betyn him. Alexander chargyd Nay and said.
Not so hardy any man to towche him vyolentlye / for he is full true and good
and reportith even as hit is. Also Gregorye says. Man is made of great
dignite and worship if he keep him self as he is bownde to do withowte
vycyowsnes / and that is a perfyghte tokyn of great manhood in him and of
great vertewe and ce.

Of the Saphyre and of the Goldesinyth. Dialogo.xv.


EThymologiarum.xvi. says Isydore / that Saphirus is a precious stone / like
unto the Firmamente when it is clear / which geuith a brynnyge light when he
is smytyn with the son beamis. There was sometime a conning goldesmyth
which was an excellent workman of that most honorable occupacyon / which
disposyd to set this precious saphyre In the Emperowris Dyademe. That seeing
the Sapphire / said unto the Goldesmyth. Good Mastir enclose me notte. For I am
at lyberte and young and apt to the world. Therefore I will not be separate
and departed from the iocundyte of the world. But I will be merry a while and
se the compass of hitte. To whom this noble workman said. Thyn inclusion
shall be thy holiness and for thy great avail / For I shall set the in a
sure place where thou shall live in suretye with owte dread / For I consydre
well thy precyosite and thy great valowre / and I dread that and if thowe
wandyr abought the world thou shall be lost / for it is written primo Iohannis
quinto. All the world is set in malycyousnes. There be so many perils in
this world that neythyr the tongue of man can express them / nor yet the heart
think them. Whereof Gregory writes and says We owe euyr to dread / for we be
in continual perell. and for this cawse mine own dear son / and for the
great love and fauowre I owe to the / I will not suffer the to go fro me / nor
to wandre aboughte the world. But I will put the in sure conseruacyon and
keeping / and aftyr this saying this reverend workman and Goldsmyth inclosyd
the Saphyr worshipfully in the kyngis Dyademe. Where he continuyd perpetually
in great worshype and said.

In sure place is bettyr to abide.
Than to wandre abought / and be without gyde
SO it is sure to a Relygyows man to continewe and abide in his cloystre and in
his Cell. For it is written in vitis pa. Go in to thy Cell thowe man of Relygyon
/ and it shall teache the all things necessary to thy well. For there regnyth
peace in the Cell / and withowt is away of batell and stryf. And therefore as
Jerome says he that desire the Christ / let him seek nothing else in this
world / but let his Cell be to him as paradyce fulfilled with swetnes of holy
scripture / and that use oftens for delycis / and rejoice in the stodye of
them. An abbotte called euagarius said unto one that said to him / as it is
read in vitis pa. I may notte fast / nor labor nor wait upon seek folk.
Go ete quod the abbotte / drink and sleep / but keep still thy cell and come
notte owte / for perseueraunce in the cell / ledith a monk to his order / and
so lytyl and little he retournyd again to the holy workys of perfeccyon.

Of the precious Topasyon Dialogo, xvj.


TOpasiue as says Papie is a precious Gemme Which in him self beryth the
colowris of almaner of precious stonys. Isidore also says ethymo. libro.xvi.
that it is a stone grene of kind shynyng with almaner of Colowr which was
first found in an I Will of Arabye that is Called Topazi and thereof the stone is
named Topazius. Upon a time a precyows Topasyon / was conueyde and Carried out
of Arabye unto Rome and reverently set and consecrate in a cross in the
Church of saint Petyr of Rome and there it was desyrouslye behold / of many a
creature. This Topasyon was infecte with bad counsel and saxde. What life is
this to continewe always in the Church and neuyr to depart thens. Nor at no
time to be famylier with the world. Wherefore I will for a season / retourn to
the world that I may have a little recreacyon in it and ^emery with secularis /
and aftir to regne with Criste in heuyn. And when he was departed from that
holy place and tournyd to the world again he was takyn and deceived be unlawful
concupiscencis of the world and so put him self to the danger of allmaner of
vicis / and fell in to the hondis of hethyn people. And when they knew not the
worthynes of him they set little price be him and despised him and drove him
fro the contray / in so much that he durst neuyr aftyr apere there / and at
ye conclusion this Topasion was broke and destroyed and said with great
lamentacion and mourning.

He that departith from an holy place
Without cause leful shall somtym fail of grace
Therefore Relygyous folkys owith to be ware to retourn to the world that they
prrish not with the world. For truly concupiscens destroyth relygyous folkys.
And therefore sayn^t augustyn says. As the love of God is the well of all
virtue. So is the love of the world well of all vicis. Wherefore he that wylhaue
god in possession must forsake the world that God may be to him a blessed
possession for euyr. Barnard also says. The perfight servant of Criste louyth
nothing but him. And if he love any thing save him he is notte perfighte.
Also Barnarde says. They that be made rich with lpirituall goodis / owe not
to be employed to secular occupacions. It is read in vitis patrum / that a
sertayne brodir of Relygyon asked an old man a questyon and said What shall I
do for my thought will not suffir me to abide oon hour in my cell. And the
oldeman answerde and said. Sone turn again and sit still in thicell / and
labor with thy hondis / and pray God besylye / and cast up thy thought to
him / and beware that no man deceive the nor cawse the to depart fro thy Cell
/ For I shall tell the a marvelous tale. There was a yongman sometime that was
secular and had his fader living / and so this yongman had a great desire to
be a monk. And at a time of oportunite and laysar he prayde his fadir to
grant him his good will / that he might receive the holy order and his fader
would not grant him. And aftyrwarde this yongman cawsid his kynrede and
frendis to make great instaunce to his fadir / and at last be there meanys his
fadir suffirde him to acomplish his apetyte / and to enter in to Relygyon how
be it his fadir was not greatly pleasid with all. And forthwith immediately this
yongman went to a monasterye / and was made a monk. And when he had receyuid
the holy habyte of Religion he began in great perfeccion Dewly to perform
all the charges of the monastery and vsid great fasting daily. And aftirwarde
he vsyd fasting be.ii. days and.iii. days / and onys in the weke to take
suftenaunce / his abbotte seeing his perfeccyon had mer^ayle and thankyd God of
his vertewe and goostely travail. Aftyr a season it happid this young monk
made supplycacyon to his abbotte and said. I pray the fadir to license me to
goo in to wyldernes. And the abbotte answerde and said. Sone think not there
one for thou may not suffer so great labor / nor so great temptacyons of
the fend and subtyltyes of him there. And if it happyn the to fall in
temptacyon thowe shall find no man there to give the good counsel / for to
preserve the fro the trowble of thyn enymye / that he will put to the This
monk encrecyd his peticyon and prayde his abbot to license him to depart. The
abbotte seeing that he would depart / and that he cowde not keep him / gave hi^
good counsel and prayde deuowtely for him and let him goo. But he also desired
his abbotte to send some folkys with him to set him in his way / and he
ordained two monkis of that same monasterye / and they dyrectid him in his
journey. and as they malkyd a day or twain in the wyldernes they were
almooste overcome with great heat / and they lay down to rest them / and
fell in a slombre / and there came an egle and smote them with his wings and
flew fer thens and set on the ground And they woke and saw him / and said
to the young monk. Behold this is thyn angel. Rise and follow him. And he
rose and took leave of them and folowyd the egle / and came where she stood.
The which streyghte rose and flewe forth a furlonge thens / and set down
again. And this monk folowyd her And eft again the egle flewe forth not
far thens and satte down. And this continuyd be the space of iii howris. And
aftyrwarde whyll this monk folowyd the egle / she tournyd upon his right side
and suddenly was gone. Nevertheless this brodir folowyd aftyr her and lokyd
and espyede.iii. palm treys and a well of fair watyr / and a cave in the
earth and said. This is the place that God has ordeynede for me / and went in
and Tarried there and ete and took his sustynaunce of the datis that grew there /
and drank watyr of the well and contynuyd there.vi. yeris space. and saw neuir
creature all that season. And upon a day the devil Came thedir to him in
lykenes of an old abbotte having a dredefull look. And when this monk saw
him he was aferde / and lay down prostrate in prayer and rose again / and the
devil spoke and said to him. Brodir / let us go pray more. And when they
rose / the devil said unto him again. How long have thowe been here. And
he answerde. The Term of.vi. yerys. Then said the fend Thowe have been my
neybowre a great while / and I knew not of thy dwelling here not paste.iiii.
days ^goon. And I have a monastery not fer hens / and forsooth this.xiii. yeris
came I not owte of it tell now this same day / and that was for cawse I
understood that thou dweldist so nere me. For I Reuoluyd in my mind and said
to my self. I will go unto this good man / and Common with him for the well of
my soul. And therefore brodyr for this intent I am come hyder. Certainly me
thinkith that we prositte but little here syttyng in these Cellis / for we
receive not the blessed Sacrament / of Cristis holy flessh and blood / and
therefore I dread that we shall be no partyners of it / if we neglygentlye keep
owr self from the percepcyon of so excellent a mysterye / as yt is. But
brodir.iii. mile bens is a monasterye and there is a priest / and by my counsel
we will go upon sunday next or with in this fortnyght at fardest / and we will
receive owre lord and maker / and retourn again to owr Cellys. And so this
monk thought that this Counsel of the fend was good / and when the day
was come that they had prefyxed the devil came and said. Goo we hens for it
is time. And forth they went to gither the devil and the monk / tell they came
to the monastery where the priest was / and they entrid into the Church there
and took them to their prayers. And at the last this monk rose up and
lokyd abought / and could not find him that brought him thedyr and said to
him self. where is he become. I trow he begoon to the place of common
necessite. And aftyr when he had tarried long / and the other shrew came not /
the monk went out and sought him / and when he cowde not find him / he
inquyred for him of the bredrin of that monasterye / and said to them. where
is that old abbotte that came with me in to yower Church. Saw you not of
him lately. And they answerde to him and said. we saw non to but ye aloone.
Then knew this monk well that it was his aduersarye the devil that had
deceived him and said Now I consydyr well that ye devil with his sotylteys
has brought me fro my Cell / but it forthinkith me not For I Came for a good
entente / to receive the holy sacrament of Cristis flessh and blood / and then
to goo again to my cell. And when mass was done the fader and abbotte of
that monasterye would not suffer him to depart / but said to him. we will not
let you goo tell ye have dynyd and refresshyd yowr self. when dinner was done
and he was going to his cell. The devil came again in lykenes of a yongman
in secular clothyng and behylde this monk intentyflye fro the head to the foot
and sayo with reiteracyo^ many times. This same is he. It is not he. At last
this monk said. I trow thou knowyst me. But how may yt be / For I have not
been seen many yeris. The devil said. I am thy fadirs neybour the son of
such a man / and this is thy fadirs Name. and thy mother is Named thus / and
thus art thou named / and be not these yowr servants namys and thy modir and
sustyr be ded.iij. yerys paste / and thy fadir is now lately deceside / and
has made the his air and said when he should dye. To whom should I leave my
good / but to mine own son that is so vertuows and good and has forsake the
world and folowyd thesteppis of godde to him I leave all my goodis. Now if
there be any good man that dredith God and wot where he is / let him tell me /
that he may come and depart my goodis to power people for the well of my soul
and his both. And manyon have gone to seek the and cowde not find the / and
as my fortune was for an other cawse I came this way / and happyd to espy
the. Wherefore tarry not be my council but come and sell all thing and
perform the will of thy fadyr. The monk answered and said It is not
expedient to me to turn again to the world The devil answerde again and
said. If thowe com not all thy Fadirs good shall be lost / and thowe shall be
counteable for it in ye sight of god. What harm say I to the. But I show the
thy fadirs will / and I desire the to come and distrybute his goodis like a
good mynister to them that be indigent and nedy that it be notte consumyd nor
my spent / be vnthristes / but that it may be spent to the consolacyon and
releef of such as be vertuows and in pouerte. Or what great burdon shall it
be to the / to come and do for thy fadirs soul / with his own goodis as his
syngler trust was in the / and then torn again to thy Cell. What more. The
devil preuaylyd be his false instigacion / and so this monk went forth with
him tell they came togider to the cite / and there he forsook him. And when this
monk was alone he went toward his fadirs hows / wenynge to have fownde him
deed. and his fadir was Coming owte of the durre being alive / and knew not
his son / butte asked what he was / and he was wonderfully troubled and cowde
give noone answer. And his fadyr askyde of him diverse times and many what he
was / and whens he came. And at last he said with Rubowre and great
confusyon. I am thy son. Then said his fadir Why art thowe come again. And
he was ashamyd to tell the Circunstaunce of the matter. Butte at the last thus
he said to his fadir. The love of the has cawsyd me to come hydir for I
desired sore to fee the / and there he contynuyd and bode still / and aftyrin a
short space he comittyd fornycacyon / and other great enormyteys and sins.
Wherefore his fadir vexyd him / with diverse af flyceyons. But notwithstondinge
he amendid not his living nor took no repentance / but like an unhappy
creature. Contynuyd still in the world / and endid his life synfullye.
Wherefore bredryn I say that a monk should never depart from his cell for no
bad counsel etc.



Of the Charboncle and the Glass. Dialogo.xvii.
CArbunculus is a precyows stone / as says brito / and so named for it is
brinnyge lyk a Cole offyre / and the brightness of hitte shewith in the night
time Hitte shynythe in derknesse so greatly that the flamys of hitte smytythe
theiye sight. A myrowre of Glass went to this Charboncle upon a time and
said. Brodir among all othyr precyows stonys / thowe art very precious and
splendent / and I also bear a bright colowre / so that in me all thing is
clearly seen and consyderid. wherefore as me thinks if we twain were oon. we
should be of more excellence / and seuyn times of more valowre then we be. To
whom this Charboncle answerde and said thus / I will not consent to thy
mocyon. For I consydre well that thowe comyste of a frail stock / that is to
say of brotyll Glass / and mine orygynall growith of precyus ge^mis. Therefore
owre coniunctyon is not conuenyent / for Isidore says. The Child is
oftyntymes like unto ye mother. And for thou art not equyualent unto my
substance / goo fro me. For I will notte be assocyate nor I will not be
conioynyde unto the. And moreover he said.

This is at all times conuenyent and good.
Gentyls to be gydyd aftyr their blood.
SO a Crystyn man / which is of the most noble kind / that is to say of
Christ / for of Christ is said a Christen man / owithe notte to here / nor
owith notte to give credence to the perswasyon of the fend. For he is worste
of all things / whereof it is wryttyn in the book of Clement. He that wylfully
subduyth him self to the deuyls will / shall notte have peace with God / nor
with man. And saint Augustyn says. The devil may disceyue no man / but if he
will freely assent unto him. Wherefore Jerome says. Power of the fend is not
to be drad for the dread and boste of him is ever in the will of man / for the
flessh does nothing / but the soul consentith first thereto. It is read in
vitis patrum / that one hermyte was led by an Angel to a sertayne place /
where as was a great congregacyon of holy monkys / and he saw the placis that
lay abought them replete with innumerable multitude of fendes flying as it had
been flies. And when the angel and the Heremyte came togider to a great Cite
where as was kept a great fair / this heremyte saw but oon fend stondynge
upon the gatys / and he was Idell / and not half occupied and the Heremyte
asked what it mente. The angel answerde and said. All that euyr were in the
cite were aplyable to perform the fendes will / and therefore one fend was
sufficient there. But in the abbaye it was contrary for they resistyd manly and
therefore came many fendes togider again them to tempte them with diverse
temptacions.

Of a precyows stone called Achate and a serpent Called Cerastes. Dialogo.xviii.


AS wrytith Papie there is a stone called Achates / which is a very precyows
Gemme having black serclys and white and diverse of colowre. Brito and Isydore
say Etymologiarum.xvi. that hit is a stone first found in sicilie / be a
floode of the sam Name / and aftyrwarde it has been fownde in diverse placys as
says hugucio / and it cawsith a man to be fauourhable. Cerastes is a serpent
so called as wrytithe Isidore Ethimologiarum.xii. for that he berithe.viii.
hornys in his head like unto the hornys of a Ram / and the hornys of him be
oftyn times set upon rich mennys tablys to eschew venyme. And also of his
hornys be made knyuys hastis / which were wonde to be laid before kings and
Emperowrys that be the swetynge of them it should be showed if any mete that
were set forth were infecte with poison. This serpent consydrid in him self
that he was hateful and odyows to every man and that he was also forsakyn of
them. Therefore he went to the Achate and said. O precious Gemme come to me and
set thy self between my hornys / and I shall bear the between them
worshypfullye. For I understand well that thowe haste great virtue to cawse
thy berar to be gracyows. And moreouir I promise the that and if thowe Cawse me
to be in fauowre / and beloved I shall be my strength rob both lordis and in
nocentys / and thou shall be partenar and have half my wynnygis. To whom this
precyows stone answered and said. Thy speech lykyth me not. for the Apostle
says Notte only the doers of sin. but also they that consent to them be
worthy perpetual dampnacion. And also it is a comune saying. As great fawte
has he that holdith / as he that fleyth or yeldyth. Therefore goo from / for
thy disposicyon is not good / and thus this precyows Gemme departed fro the
Serpent and said.

Contrary to sin we owe to be.
And not consent thereto perde.
THus did David when he said Psalmo.c. I have hatyd synnars thongh it were my
fadir or mother / suster or brother / or friend / or Bisshoppe or in any manner of
degree that wilfully would offend / and so utterly I would flee his feleshippe
that I would never think upon him. wherefore it is wryttyn in policrato. libro
nono, that saint Iherome excludyd three Clerkys from his bourde. For they were
vnmanerlye / and also he said / it was rebukefull for a worshypfull man / or
for a man of auctorite to keep any evil disposyd person in his company.

Of Gold and Led. Dialogo.xix.


IN a great hastynes Leede went to gold and said. why art thowe so proud
again me. Am not I of the substance of metallys as well as thowe. wherefore
dispysist thou me / and thou disdarnyst that I should be as precyows as thowe.
Come nere to me and prove me in fire / and thou shall see the great vertewe
that is in me. To whom Gold answerde and said. I know well that owre
creatowr has made the as he has made me / and so I contynewe as I was
ordeynyd be him. Therefore I do noon iniurye to the. wherefore take thou that is
thine and strive not with me / for it behouith us to be prouyd in all things
as the holy Apostle writith i. Thessal.v. and says thus prove ye every thing
and kepeye that thing that is good. Go to the fire and than shall thy vertewe
and victory apere. And when they were to gidir in the fire the leede consumyd
and vanyshed away. The Gold was puryfyed and came forth fair and bright and
said.

Words of boste of pomp and of pride
Be but in vain / thowgh they be blowyn wide
Much proud people be in that same case thinking they have vertewe / which is
not in them. And therefore if they have a little blaste of temptacion / they be
soon overcome / and brought to naught as led in the fire. Therefore and if
thou intend to be precyows in the sight of Godde / stody and aplye the to be
meke and lowlye in thyn own mind. Wherefore Isidore says. Be thou like a
child lowlye in thyn own sight / that thou may be great in the sight of
Godde. Forsomoche the more precyows shall thou be in gods sight / how much
thou art humylyate in thyn own conscience. And he that is vile to his own
mind / is great to Godde. Gregory says. Consydre the more glorious thou art
in thyn own mind. The more vile art thowe before Godde and his aungellys. In
Rome sometime was a lady / of so great humilite and reverence / yt she thought
her self unworthy to come nyghe the awter / and to behold the blessed body
of ower lord. when it was lift up. Whereof it fortuned on a time / when the
people were how sild she for great mekenes and honowre came not nere to
receive it. wherefore be the operacyon of almighty Godde / it was so all the
people stondynge and beholdinge there came a lylywhy the dove and took the host
from the awter and delivered it unto herre with great worship / and
therefore humylyte and mekenes is comendale / and Contynually to be obseruyd /
and kete.

Of Gold and Silver. Dialogo.xx.


Upon a time Gold went to silver and said. Be merry brodyr / for we twain
bear the price among all other metallys. And if we were conjoined togider we
should be of great sublymyte and worshype. Whereto Silver gave this answer and
said. Brother thowe spekist charitably. but I consydre well that thy colowre is
reed and mine is white. Also I remember that thou art of great reputacyon and
incomparable valowre. Wherefore I trow verily that like as we be deuydid and
contrary in price and in valowre / so shall we be deuydid in owre wyllys. It is
bettyr therefore for us not to begin coniunccyon than aftyrwarde to make
separacyon and to withdraw us from the thing that is begone / and also silver
said these wordis.

No wysdom it is for any man to aplye.
To compare with his bettyr / nor to step to hye.
AS it is written Ecclesi.xiii. He chargith him self with an importable burdon /
that ioynythe him self to his bettyr / and also hit is wryttyn in that same
place. Be thowe no fellow to him that is rycher than thowe. wherefore the
philosofre says. The poreman perisshith when he begynnyth to strive with the
rich man / as Isope shewith in a fable and says that the got / the sheep and
the ass upon a time made a confederacye with the lion and compenyed with him
to goo an hunting together / as felows and neybowris / and all they togider
took an heart. But when they should deuyde it / the lion spoke and said. I
shall be air of the first part. For I am grettist of worshppe here / and the
first choice shall yield me the secounde part / and ye grettist labowre shall
give me the thryd yarte. And but if I have the forth part I shall break the
conuenaunte of concord / and with these wordys he began to gryne with his teth
/ and smote the grownde with his tail / so soore that all they for fere rane
away / and left all the hoole heart to the lion. Whereby it apperithe that a
man owith to be ware to assocyate him self with his bettyrs / for he shall euyr
be put to the worse part / as it is said in a commune proverb. I counsel
not seruauntis to ete Cheryes with there bettyrs. For they will have the Ripe /
and leave them the hard / and therefore says Isope. By this exemple it is
showed that it is not good for the weke to be joined to the mighty / for he will
not at all times be faithful unto him.

Of Silver and Iryn. Dialogo.xxi.


Silver in a season vncurteyslye and vndiscretelye spoke unto Iryn and said. O
unhappy creature. Cursyd be thy generacyon. for by the infynyte sorowis be
wrowght in the world. For of the be made swerdis / shaftisdartys / brestplatys
/ helmettis / and all manner of wepyns and harneys / for to punyssh and to slay
man By the also batellys and stryues happyn in the world If thowe haddist not
be made / the world had been in great tranquillyte and rest. Iryn this
herynge with great reason excusid him self and said. Howgh brodie thou
spekyst not trwlye / for I do no wrong to the. For and if I be a malefactor
as thowe reportyste / thyn own consideracyon shall prove it / if thou take heed. For withowte me no work can be made. By me alsoo crastys be occupied and
the earth berythe / Men alsoo work by me and drive me in length and bred / and
forge of me what it pleasith the^ / and Isay not nay / but obey to the^ as my
makr has ordeinid me. if they make of me othrwise then good it is there blame
and not mine. For I do as I should do. But I marvel of the that so sone
conste see a little fawte in mine ye / and consyderiste not a great beam in
thyn own. For and if all trowthe should truly be declared thou art orygynall of
all myschefe. Be the meanys of the / men fall to theft / adulterye /
Manslaughter / and many othyr crimes. By the also troth and rightwysnes
perissheth / and be destroyed Rape and vsurye come be the. Thowe desseyuiste the
soul of man and bringith it to perdycyon. Therefore it had been bettyr for the
to have hold thy peace / and not to speak so inordinatlye / but a fool cannot
speak / that cannot be still / and therefore it is said in proverb.

Or euir the word be forth I brought.
Considre before what thou haste wroughte
FOr saint Augustyn says. Let thy word first come to thy mind / and aftyr
to thy tongue. wha^ a Philosofre was in company of much people / and spoke but
few woordys / he was asked the cause / and he said It has repentyd me of my
speech. But neuyr of scilence wherefore Caton says. It hurtyth noman to be
still / but it noyeth to speak to much. There was sometime a good thrysty man /
which in his hows had three cockys And also he had within that same place of his
habytacyon a servant / which led noon honest life. That consyderige the
cockys / oon of them sange in this wise / and said. Such dedys that servant
does / which shall not please owre mastyr. This heringe the servant / said.
This cok shall live no lengar / and immediatlye cawsid him to be slain. An
othyr day the second cok lift up his voice and sange thus. For sayng of
troth my fellow is deed / and even forthwithe this servant put him to death.
Then the thryd cock was wise / and thought he would save him self and sange
in this manner and said. Here / see / and hold thy peace / if thou intend to
live in peace / and therefore he had his life / and contynuyd long in great
wealth and prosperity.

Of Tynne and Brass. Dialogo.xxii.
Tynne and brass confederide togidere enuyede again Gold. Wherefore they
deuysid a pot full of fair Copyr and bright / and brought it to the markette
and sold it / affermynge with sugryd wordys / that this Copyr was Gold. A
sertayne chapman came and bought yt. and joyfully bare it home. And when he
would have prouyd the perfeccyon of the Gold / he fownde it Copir. Wherefore he
was replete with indignacyon and cawsid Gold to be Cyted before a judge / for
by cawse he had deceived him. Notwithstondynge Gold made his true excuse /
and said to the judge / that he neuyr sold the pot / nor deuisid it / nor it
was neuyr of his generacyon nor kynrede. Wherefore in great haste the judge
cawsyd ye vendytowris all to be Cyted before him and punyshed them with great
pains / and so be compulsyon they confessyd the trowth and shewid that they
did it for envy / which they bare again Gold / and there intent was for to
have slaundrid him that his Name should have been apayrid and that he should not
have been so precyows / in the world. Wherefore the judge discretelye correctyd
them like there deseruynge and comendid. Gold greatly and said.

He that is both good and pure
May euyr sleep sowndlye and sure.
MAnyon intend in likewise to diffame there bettyrs / be false wytnes. And he
that berythe false wytnes shall not be unpunished / as it is wryttyn
Proverb.xix. A false wytnes shall not be vnpunyshid and he that spekyth
lesynges shall not escape / that is to say the judgment of Godde. And it is
wryttyn in the same place. A false witness shall perish / as it is wrytyn in
collacyonibus patrum. That sometime an abbotte called pafuncyus when he was
young and gracyous and sat in his Cell / oon of his bredryn enuyed at him /
and for to put him to a slawnder he went and hid his bocke in the bed of
pafunce. And when mass was fynysshed and endyd and all the monkys were
congregate togider / this untrue brodyr reportyd and said that his book was
stolyn. Wherefore three brodryn were assygnyd to search in every Cell and they
fownde the book in pafuncis bed / and thus he was falslye accusyd before all
his bredryn and assignyd to do great penance for theft which he neuyr
comyttyd. But notwithstondinge he mekely suffyrde it and performyd it. And wha^
he had continuyd in penance a sertayne season / this false monk was vexyd with
a fend / and publyshed his offense / with loud clamoure / and shewid that he
had wrought that soteyltye hydinge the book / and that he did it for envy /
for to have diffamyd the holy man / and desired heartily that he might be
brought unto him to be delivered fro the fend by his holy prayers. And when
he was brought before him he was immediately helyd and delyueryd from the fendis
possessyon. Wherefore saint Gregory spekyth of false witness and says. He that
berithe false witness is culpable to three personnys. First unto Godde whose
penance he forsakith. Secounde to the judge / whom he disseyuith by his
lesinges. Thryd to the innocent which he hurtythe by his false witness. And
therefore be the law a false wytnesser is bound to make restitucyon of all
such goods as he has cawsid his neybowre to lose be his false record.

Of the Lock and the kaye. Dialogo.xxiii


Akaye there was sometime. Which was very good / and plesauntlye opynde her
lock / and also made it fast / in so much that the patron / and ownar
thereof reioycyd greatly therein. Upon a time this Lock fell in froward mind
and grutchyd again the kay and said thus. O wykked creature why pursewyst
thou me thus continuallye daily thou entrist in to my bowellys and tournyst my
stomak up and down. Cece of thy greef and trowble me no more / or else I
shall cast the away or make the crokyd. To whom ye kaye answerde and said.
Sustyr thou spekyst evil. By me thowe art conseruyd in prosperity and
defendid from thyn enymyce. If thowe wylt be separate and departed fro me /
thou shall be destroyde and brokyn and cast away. But this notwithstondinge
the lock was not pleasyd but suddenly stoppyd fast the hole / and would not
suffer the kaye entyr in to him / and so the ownar cowde not opyn the door.
wherefore he was angrye / and in a sodeyn hete he smote of the lock / and brake
it for cause it would not opyn. wherefore the kaye scornyd the lock and said
in this wise.

with thy friend that mayntaynith the.
Discord thou neuir in no degree.
BEware therefore to strive or varye with him that thou lyuyste with famylyerly.
For Seneca says Nothing is more foul then to be at stryf and varyaunce with
him that thowe louyd and been conuersaunte with. Nevertheless they that desire
to live peseablye with there neybowris / should help to supporte them and bear
part of there charges as the Apostle wrytythe ad Galat.vi. Every one of you
bear the burdon of other. Tully also says. There is nothing but it may be
suffirde of him that perfightlye louith his neybowre / as it is read in the
Hystory scolasticall. That antipater Idu meus which was fader of Herod the
great was sore woundid in batell / with many diverse great woundis in the
Emperowris service / which he gladlye suffirde / for his sake. Notwithstondinge
at last he was falsely accusyd to the Emperowre. And when he was brought
before him / he spoke to the Emperowre and said. My Lord I will not show you
fair wordys for mine excuse. but these great woundis which I have suffyrde
for your love / let them speak for me / and express also the great love and
verey true heart that I have euir owghte to you. And immediatlye the
Emperowre receyuyd him to grace / and showed him great fauowre euyraftyr. Also
hit is read in the first book of Iapis of Philosophirs / of Iulye Caesar how
there was an old man lyklye to have perished in a stryf upon a day / and when
he came before the iugis he prayde the emperor to come and help him. And the
Emperowre assygned one to help him. To whom he answerde and said. O Emperowr
Remember I fawght my self for the in the batell of Asye / and made no proctoure
/ and disclosyd his woundis which he had there / and showed them to the
Emperowre. Wherefore he went him self personallye and sped his besynes / and was
sore ashamyd in him self to be Reputyd not oonly proud / but also un curteys
and vnlouynge. Whereof it is wryttyn. He that labowrith not. etethe not. And
also the same Emperor says. He yt labowrith not to be loving to his knights.
Cannot be favorable to them / as it is said in lawde of the same Emperowre
that he neuyr vside to say. Goo ye / but goo we / for he was euyr partetaker
of there labowre as ^on of them / and that was at all times of any iubardye.

Of the Cawdron and the Chain Dialogo.xxiiii.


THe chain spoke to the Cawdron upon a time and said. Thowe art greatly
unkind for I bear the to the fire / and thowe daily sethyst many a good
morsel and geuyst me neuyr part to ete with the. Thy glotony is great. For
thou consumyst all and leuist me hungry. The Cawdron answered and said. Thou
seruyst me to my hurt. And therefore thowe art not worthy to be rewardyd / but
rather to be punyshed for thowe holdiste me up to the fire / sore again my
will and cawsiste my sides to be brent and consumyd. And therefore if my power
would extend thereto I would gladly destroy ye. But and if thou be wylfull to
do me acceptable service. Ordeyne to me things profitable and necessary and
not contrary / and also he said.

Service that is does good and prefytable
Is louyd to all men and acceptable.
Therefore and if thou desire to do service to other men / serve them to there
pleasure / that they may thank the. Or else thou shall lose thy reward For
Seneca says. He that cannot give reward / unrightfully askyth it / that is to
say. He that cannot give a reward profitable / desires it unrightfully.
Small bestys teache us to yield godenes. As it is read that the mows went upon
the lion whyll he slepte / and the lion cawght him and would have etyn him. But
the mows spoke mekely to the lion and said. Be pacyent to me and have mercy
upon me / and I shall yield itte the when I may. The Lion began to smyle and
laugh thinking his habylyte was weke and small to do for him. And breuely
aftyr it fortuned that the Lion was take in a net. That knowing the mows.
Came and gnewe a sondyr the cordys / and delivered the Lion owte of dawnger.
But evil disposicion is not lightly changed in lordis and mighty men be gifts
and benefytes done to them / but rather it is apayrid and worse and continuyth
in shrewdnes. Wherefore it is told that a yongman in the winter season / saw a
serpent almost ded with feruence of great cold / and he having pete of it /
took it up and put it in his sleue. but when he was warm he stonge him / and
destroyde him. Therefore says Seneca. A Serpent in the winter is not to be
ha^dlyd with suretye for though he lie still he secyth not to stynge and to
shede his venyme.

Of Rosemary and of the Fylde. Dialogo.xxv.


AS hit is read of the vertewe of erbys Rosmarye among al other vertewis has
this vertew in especyall. That and if he be plantyd in a field / or in a
vyneyerde and kept Clean and worshypfully / the vynes shall be fruteful and
rejoice greatly / and the Cornis shall multyplye and largely encrece. For the
which cawse a sertayn feylde continually being infructuous and bareyn went to
the Rosmarye with humilite and devotion and prayde him that he might be
fruitful / and said. O gracyous pastor and good keeper come to me and defend
me / and I shall set the clean and clenly / and also I shall serve the. All
oonely I desire the to sytte still and rest the in me that the rathr be thy
goodness I may bring forth wholesome and kyndely frewte. The Rosemary was mouyd
with piete / and overcome with the fair supplicacyon of the feelde / and went
forthewith him and set him self in the myddys of him. Who rulynge and
defendinge / the field recoueryd and waxyd grene / and multiplied and brought
forth fruit Threscore fold and an hundridfold with great haboundaunce and
gladness and said in this wise.

For on godemannis sake / many other moo.
Be oftyn conseruid and kept owte of woo.
THus owght the people to do / when they have no gider. To chese a prouyd man
/ ryghtfull and wise / which be his polycye and wisdom may govern them wisely
and defend them. Verily and truly a wise king is a sure stablysshment of the
people / as it is wryttyn Sapient.vi. O ye kyngis if ye delyght you in yower
Royal seys. Love ye wisdom. Love ye the light of wisdom that be preferryd to
have rule of the people / ad Ecclesiast. A wyseiuge shaliuge his people The
prince hode of a wyseman shall be stable. And yt is wryttyn in the same place.
A king unwise shall lose his people and the Cyteys shall be inhabyte be the
reason of wisemen. Wherefore Solomon desyrid of God a techeable heart / that he
might teache ye people of God and discern between good and Iuyll. Also vigecyus
says de re militari. No man owith more to know nor bettyr to know every
thing than the prince and ruler. whose doctrine should be to all his subiectis
most profitable. For truly yongmen be not oftyn to be chosyn rulers for it is
not most expedient forsomoche as they be not always steadfast / and wise / as
it is said in the thryd book of etykys. And Plato also says. Then the large
world was prosperows and happy when wisemen regnyd / and kyngis inwardlye
conceyuyd good gydynge as says Valerye and also boyce in his first book of
consolacyon. wherefore it was called the goldyn world when the regne of wisemen
continuyd and Seneca says / and it is wryttyn in libro Politicorum iiii. That
while ye commune well among the Romans prosperyd and chenyd / the Emperowris
and Rulers were conynge and well instruct in learning / and I know not says
Scneca / how hit fortunythe that the vertew of co^nynge langwyssith and is
abatyd among princes and Rulers. Wherefore no marvel though their state
apayre for withowte wisdom nothing auaylythe as holy writ makyth meneyon.
proverb.viii. by me kings regne says almighty God. Wherefore the king of
Romans exhortyd the king of France that he should cawse his sonnis to be
imbute / and lernyd in lybetall science saying. A king vnlernyd is like to an
Ass crownyd. Socrates reportith in his last book and says That emonge a
sertayn people that is to say in an I Will of Campanye. Dignyte of birth
preuaylyth not in eleccyon of the king / but the voys of all the people. For
they make eleccyon and chese one that is ornate and Clothid with good
condicyons and manners. benyuolent in rightwysnes / and mercy / and also sad of
age and that has no children. And if he be prouyd of his people to continewe
in any great sin he shall dye and be destroyed.

Of Rewe and of venymows bestis Dialogo.xxvi.
IN the book of de virtutibus erbarum it is wryttyn Rewe among all othr
vertuys that she has in especyall this is oon. That if she be takyn in drink
or in mete she meruelously preuaylythe again venyme / and again almaner of
venymows bytynges or styngynges if she be brosid or stampyd with garlyke salt
and nottis. And so for this great vertewe that she has again venyme / all
venymows bestis came togider to her and said. We pray the depart owte of
Compenye / and meddle not between us and mankind. for we intend in all owre
mind for to sow owre venyme among men / and for to destroy them / for the
which cawse they pursewe us and slay us To whom Rewe answerde and said. yower
words be wicked and my scheuows. Of you it is wryttyn in the Psalter
Psalmo.xiii. The venyme of aspys is under their tongis. ye cursyd serpentis
why be ye about to destroy man who^ god has created and made to be lord of
all thing. And forasmoch as ye say yt I have grace and vertewe again you /
and also again yowr venyme / fro this time forthwarde / the Grace of God shall
not be void in me. but his grace shall ever dwell in me For I shall euyr aplye
me to be Contrary unto you and unto yower badde disposycyon / and resyste
you that ye shall not fulfill yowre evil intent / and also she said these
words.

Good people owith euyr to prevail
Again sinful that would them assail.
EVyn thus should Rulers do / and wyselye euyr resist to bad folkys and to
say Nay to them and to punyssh them. For Seneca says. He Noyeth good folkys
that sparyth the bad. For sothly a judge owithe not to spare male factowris /
for a judge correctynge not the sinful committith to sin as says Seneca.
wherefore Ambrose says. when indulgence and favor is showed to the unworthy /
many other be prouokyd to sin therbye / as valery rehersith in his.v. book.
of oon called bruto the which was first consul of Romans the which
comaundid his own sonnys when they were brought before him sitting in
ingement to be sore betyn with roddis and aftyr that to be behedid. For by
cawse they intendid to reduce the lordshyppe of Tarquynye / which he had
expullyd. For he had leuyr to be withowte Chyldryn / then to lack to do dewi
punishment. A semblable example shewith saint Augustyn.v. de Ci. Dei. That a
sertayn Emperower of Rome comaundid upon pain of death that no man should fight
again the fowwarde of his enemies And his own son which was oftyn prouokyd
of them. Onys faught with them manly and defendid the contray and put them to
the worse. But all that notwithstandyge his fadir comawndid him to death. For
brekinge of his comawndment. And therefore Rightwysnes is euyr to be kept and
observed.

Of Isope and a man Called Marcurye Dialogo.xxvii


BRito says there is an erbe named Isope apt and good to pourge the lungis.
An other author says that Isope with oxymell destroys flewme that is towgh.
For which cause Marcurye whom Gentyls named to be a God / but he was a false
covetous man and an hard. A witch full of wykednes / and an interpretowr of
spechis. And while he had health many vicis regnyd in him therefore he was
rightfully smitten of god with diverse infirmyteis / and was made both lungsyk
and Reumatyke that he might not occupye his accostomyd sins. wherefore he went
to ysope and said. The vertewe of God is in the to hele syke folkys. For in
erbys woordis and stonys is great vertewe. Therefore I pray the show thy
vertewe upon me / and cure my lungis and destroy the flewme that is in me. And
I promise to God and to the that thowe shall be partenar of all such goods as
shall grow to me by the meanis of Rabeyne and of stelth. To whom Isope answered
and said. It is euydently knowin that in thyn health thou have done innumerable
crimes / and surely I think if thou shuldist now be restoryd again to health /
thou woldist do worse. But the vertewe of God that thou say is in me / shall
not give maintenance unto sin Go fro me therefore / for thowe shall never be
helyd by me / and so he put him forth with great confusyon and said in this
wise.

Sinful people when they have health.
Be euir the worse / and in there most wealth.
When God correctith and scourgithe them that be sinful with passions of
diverse infirmyteis that they may not sin / and they be not amendid therbye.
Certaynlye it is a great tokyn of perpetual dampnacyon. For in this lyse
present every stroke of Godys other purgacyon of sin or else begynnyg of
pain folowinge. For the chastisement of some folkys begynnyth here in this
world and duryth everlasting lie. Of diverse men it is oftyn said. God geuyth
not judgment twyes for on thing. Nevertheless that sentence attendith not
that that is written. God allmyghty delyueringe his people owte of the land of
Egypt / them that believed not in him aftirwarde he destroyde. And although
that oon fawte be not twyse correctyd. Nevertheless if it be twyes punyshed
the first punishment begynnyth here and continuith there eter nallye / as it
is exemplyfied in those personys that correct not them self here in this
present life. To whom the stroke of God and of his punishment here is a
beginning of everlasting tourmente. Here of it is wryttyn in the Psalte
Psalmo.cviii. Be they coueryd with there confusyon as with a dowblette. Diplo is
is called a double garment / which they do on / at oon time / that ^e punysshed
with temperall pain and dampnacyon perpetual. Isope tellyth that there was a
kyte so ranenous that he stale whersoeuer he might have advantage were it never
so nygh the church or sanctuarye. In so much that he was hateful unto all
men / for the owtrageows rauyne that he vsid. At last he fell syke so sore
that he was like to dye / and than he was compuncte and sorye for his sins
and mekyd him self and sent for his mother in great haste / and said to her /
Most sweet mother I am very syke and feeble / and I am dredefull of death / for I
have been a great extorcyonar / and ^oon great hurt to many folkys. Wherefore
I beseech powedere modir to goo to the Temple of Goddis and offer Sacryfice to
them for me / that I may escape and recouir of this infyrmyte. For I am redye
to be conuertyd to a bettyr life. To whom his mother answered and said. In thy
life thou have greatly offendid the Goddys and the sacrid power of them. The
rightwysnes of them yeldith to all men aftyr their deserving. In thy health
thowe haste done many great offenses. If thou myghtyste escape / God knowith
thou shall do worse. For very contricyon is none in the. The dread of death
cawsith the to be meke of speech. But verylye as Isayde if thowe myghtyste have
health thowe shuldyste be worse than thowe haste been. Whersore I will not
pray for thyn escape. And the kyte did / and departed from the world in
great dread and in great heaviness.

Of a Tree called Abrotanum and of the hare. Dialogo.xxviii.


ABrotanum as says Oracyus is a tree which by his propyrte drawith owte all
thing that is infixte / with help of an other thing called anxungial
Wherefore an hare that haltyd came mekely to him which had a sharp thorn smytyn
in his foot and said O thou helpar both of body and soul have pity on me and
hele me / and thus saying he lift his foot and showed it to him. Abrotanum was
mouyd with compassyon / and laid him self upon his wownde / and brought out
the thorn and helyd him. And verely^ this hare was not forgetful of this
benyfyte / but daily brought a galon of watre upon his shuldyrs / and bathyd
at the Rote of Abrotanum / and cawsid him to co^tynewe grene and fressh and
said.

To owre benefactours that does us good.
Let us do service with a glad mode.
But cursyd people and vncurteys do not so / but rather sone forgette the
benyfytes done to them. Wherefore of Salamon was asked what thing should not
esylye be forgotyn. And he said. Benyfytrs and kyndnes. And therefore says
Caton. Be thou remembryd of benyfytes done to the before time. And also he
says. A small gift that thy pooer friend geuyth the Receive it gladlye and
remember to yield full thankingis therefore. Thou owyst to yield the benyfites
unto thy friend. with increce if thy power extend thereto / or else to have it
oftyn in thy remembrawnce / that thy friend has shewid to the / that thou
may give him thankynges at lestwyse for his goodness / For Seneca says. It is
a sufficyent and large reward / for a good bid / to be had oftyn in
Remembrance. And alsoo the same clerk says. He is vncurteys that yeldith a
good turn withowte usure and encrece. It is read in Ecclesiastical Hystory /
that there was a lioness that had a cave nere to the cell of an holy man was
called Macharye / and this Lioness fownde her whelpys blind and brought them
all before the fete of Macharye. And this holy man understanding that her
supplycacion was for her whelpis / and he by his prayers causid them to have
sight. And this lioness for that she would not be reputiding rate and unkind
/ oftyntymes she brought the skynnys of all the beastis that she took to the
cell door of this good man / and there left them as for his reward. Also an
other beast came to the cell of saint Macharye with his sone that was born
blind and be signs and tokyns prayde him of help. The which knowing the
holy man prayde for the whelpe and anon it had sight. And this best thankyd
him in her manner / and went her way with her child / and with in a short
space she came again with all her children lodyd all with shepes kynnes that
they had takyn / and offird them to the holy man for a gift / in
recompensacyon of his goodness / and made to him obeyssance and went there way
gyuynge to him worship and thankingis

Of Plantayne and of the Ape. Dialogo.xxix.
PLantayne is an erbe most profitable again the Feuyr quartayne to be
remedyed. Wherefore an Ape that had a son vexyde with that disease / which
cowde synde no remedy for him when she had spent great goodis in phisyke and
mederynes. Therefore she went unto Macrum and said. I have compassyd heuyn and
earth and ouerwalkyd the land / and found no rest to my son but now at
last I have found the so great a lethe. ^ Therefore give me thy council and
help that I may deliver my child from this quartayne disease. Macer that
his cawse should be found true said thus. Take.iiii. rotys of Plantayne and
give them the pacyent and he shall soon be curyd. The Ape that hering ordained
breuely the medecyne and helyd her sone and said thus.

A connyge leche that can us save.
We must seek that health will have.
SO we desyringe health of owre sowlis must search for a priest and a
confessowre that is sufficientlye lernyd that both can and may bind and
unbind. Thus owist thou to do thou christian man or woman to find the ways to
save thy soul. For Isidore says. Every sinner be penance receyuyth health of
his wound. But the medicyne is to be takyn aftyr the gretnesse of the sore /
and aftyr the profoundite and depnes of the wound the remedy is to be sowghte
/ as it is read that diverse Theuys being in great iubardye and tempest in the sea / made a vow if they might escape they would be confessyd. And aftir there
escape they made confession to an heremyte. Of whom to the mastir these when
he was confessyd the heremyte enjoined for his great offencis and enormyteys
that he should goo to ye Pope to be assoylyd. wherefore he kyllyd the Heremyte /
and forth he went to the second Confessor / and also him he kyllyd. And so he
went unto the thryd confessor. And when he had showed him his Confession / he
intretyd him curteyslye / and thus when he perceived that he cowde not mollyfye
his heart nor withdraw him from his wyckednes / lyk a very fa^ir and a
princypall leche of sowlys he inioynyd him that when any creature was deed / if
he were nyghe / he should lay the corse in the grave / and so he did. And by
that me^ys he conceuyd a remembrance / whereto he should come and how sone he
knew not. And thus the deed of death was so fyxed in his mind that he ordained
his state bettyr and amendid his life and went in to wilderness and took upon
him great penance and endid in vertewe Wherefore it is written in the gloss.
Nothing auaylith more to chastise and destroy the flesshly desires / than to
think oftyn upon death.

Of Varuayne and the Wolf. Dialogo.xxx.


MAcer says that when thou visitest ye syke if thou bear varuayne upon ye and
ask of the pacyent how it is with him / if yt he say well / he shall escape
and have health. And if he answer and say it is iuyl with me / there is no trust
of amendment. Wherefore a wolf which was a leche gretely named had a syke person
in cure and daily gave him good hope of amendment. The fox knowing the
vertewe of Varuayne and intending to begyle the wolf he went to vysite the
pacyent and bare with him a bra^che of varuayne and inquirid how it stood with
him. To whom the syke answerde and said. Full hardlye and full syke I am. The
fox being sure that he should dye departed strayghte fro the pacyent and went
to the wolf that had him in cure and asked of him how he thowghte be by the
syke person. Whethir he should live or dye, To whom the wolf answerde and
said yt he should soon be curyd and helyd of his disease. For he is in
amendinge quod the wolf as I consydre by mocyon of his pulse and also by his
vryne. The fox smylyd and said. Leche thou art begylyd / and knowyst not the
craft of medecyne / for he may not escape by any mean / for the sentence of
death is geuyn to him. The wolf said contrary / and thus they varyed and
stryuyd togider in presence of many personys and laid great pleggis and
waiers.upon the prof of the trowth of the matter. But breuely to tell. The man
dyed and departed from the world within the space of.ix. days / and the wolf
was confused and lost his waiers and al his good / and Remaynyd in great
pouertye and said.

Waiers to lay of things unknow
Is no wisdom / but madness I trow.
Therefore beware and bind not thy self to tho thingis that thou knowist not.
Nor speak thou not but that thou art sure of that thou be not disceyued. For
Socrates says / there was oon that asked how he might best say Trowth. And he
answerde and said If thou say nothing but that thou knowist for sertayn.
Tha^ shall thou not lie. And as ye philosofre says If thou fere to speak that
thou shall repent / bettyr it is euyr to be still. But manyon will defend there
sayngis be they good or evil / to there power and fall at stryf and debate with
every person and neuir be in rest. Whereof there is a tale that a woman which
was vsyd and acustomyd to strive / walked by the fylde with her husbonde / and
he said the fylde was mow down / and she said it was shorn. And so they
multyplyed so many wordis that at the last her husbonde all to coryed her. But
she would not be still / but said it was clyppid with sherys. Werfore in a
great angir he cut owte her tongue. And when she might no more speak. She made
signs with her fyngers like sherys meaning the filde was Clypped. A like tale
is told of an othyr woman thewich stryuynge with her husbonde said that he was
lowsye. And he was mouyd and greuyd with her for her sayng / and beat her
grievously / but she would not amend her. But came before all her neybowris and
called him so to his rebuke. Wherefore he was replete with ire and threw herin
to a water and trade on her and drownyd her. And when she might not speak / she
lift up her hondes and made tokyns with her them bys as though she kyllyd
lyce. Wherefore it is wryttyn Ecelesiast.xxviii. Many have fall by the stroke of
sword / but not like to them that have be destroyed by the meanys of their
tongis / and therefore bad speech is to be refrained.

Of a Fruit called Mandragora / and of the desirous woman. Dialogo.xxxi.


AS says saint Augustyn super Genesim Maudragora is of the kind of an apple.
And of this Apple kind he says some men have opinion if it be receyuyd in
mete or drink. It cawsith secoundite and frutefulnesse to them that be
bareyne. And for this great vertew which she has. Venus ye goddess of
adultery / which excercisid her lechery wiht diverse personis / went to the
mandrake and made her prayer mekely and said thus / O thowe best and most
frutefulltre. Look upon me and despise not my prayers / but grawnte me of thy
goodness to be partetaker of the / that I may conceive children of them that be
my lovers / For soth lie I am barayne and withowte the I may not conceive.
Wherefore I pray the to here my peticyon / and ask of me what thou wolte. To
whom the mandrake said. O thowe most unclean of all creatures. For both ye
earth and the air be corrupt and defylyd of thy stynkynge lecherye. But much
more should it be infecte / if thou myghtyst bring forth lecherows Childryn
that might behold the multiplied and living delectablye Goo thou fro me in all
have possible. For even now I am replete tedyouslye and stoppid of the stenche
of thyn uncleanness. And so the mandrake expulsyd her owte of her presence with
confusyon to her and said.

Put away strompettis that dread for no shame
Talking of them shall hurt thy good name
FOr it is written Ecclesi.ix. The speech of an unclean woman and Iuyll
disposyd brynnythe like fire. He that louith chastity and to keep him clean
owyth not to talk much with women. Nor give audyence unto them / but put them
of / and give them no credence. For it is perylous to the soul. As saint
Jerome tellyth of a martyr which when he had overcome all manner of tourmentys /
he was laid in a bed strawyd full of flowris / where as a strompette was
fair of body lie fauowre / which Towchyd his flessh / and mouyd him to sin.
And he having especyall love to chastyte and clennesse / with his owneteth
bote a sondir his tongue and spet it in her face with blood and all. In
confusyon of her corruption and mayntenaunce of his chastyte. Also a queen of
France when she saw oon M. Perotte which was a wyseman and had passingly
fair hondis she called him to her and said. O how worthy be these fair
fyngers for to towche / and to feel the secret partys of the Queen. This
herynge he with drew his hondis and said. Nay lady it shall not be so. For
and if my fyngers should touch you in that manner / and if I should keep them
aftyr. I would think them so unclean of that towchinge that I would abhor to
put them unto my mowth euyr aftyr whyll I lived.

Of the Rosyer and the Partryche Dialogo.xxxii.


IN a sertayne herbar there grew a fair Rosyer replete with sweet rosys / it
happyd so that a partryth coming by and beholdinge the rosys desired greatly
to have of them and said. O thou beawtyfull flower of all flowris grant me of
thy Rosys / For I desire to refresshe my self a while in these sweet odowris.
To whom the Rosyer answered and said. Come to me most interely beloved sustyr
and take to yowr pleasure of the best and of the f^yreste. And when the
partryche was flow in upon the Rosyer to gadir the rosys / the sharp spynis
and thornis prykkyd his fete and leggis so sore that gladlye he departed
withowt rosis and said in this wise.

The rosis be both sweet and soft.
The thornis be sharp and prykkyth me often.
THe Rosyer betokenithe the world. The rosis among thornis be worldly
richesse / which our savior remembrith in the Euangely of Luke / and saint
Gregorye says in the exposicyon of the same. Who should believe me if I should be
interpretation assemble richesse to thornis / and especyally for thornis prykke
and richesse be delectable / and nevertheless they be Thornis / for be the
prykkynge of their inordinate love they wound the mind of man / and when they
bring it unto sin it is as a blodye wound new smyten. And also Bernard
says. yowr richesse be vain. For they promise lordshippe / and cawse
thraldom. They promise suretye and bring in dread. whereof it is wrytt^n i. ad
Timotheum.vi. They that will be made rich / fall in to great temptacyon and
snaris of the fend and in to diverse unlawful desires unprofitable and
noyhable which bring men to death and to perdycyon / as Jerome tellith of Crate
Theban a Philosofre / the which threw a great peace of fine gold in to the sea and said. Goye fro me ye wykkyd couetyse. I drown you in to the deep see /
for fere that I be not drownyd of you. To the which a like example is put of
Saint Gregory of an othyr Philosofre / which bare with him by the way a
great wege of Gold / and in his mind reuoluynge and consyderinge that he
cowde not possede riches and vertewe togidyr. He wylfullye threw from him the
Gold and said thus. O ye vain richesse goo fro me / and euyr mote ye be
far from. And therefore couetyse is euir to be dispisyd.

Of a Thorny tree called Rampnus and of the wild got. Dialogo.xxxiii.


PApye says / Rampnus is a white thorn or a thornye tree. Saint Augustyn says
in the Gloss upon the Psalter that Rampnus is a kind of Thornis most thick /
the which in his erbe is fair and soft / when he is young / but in process
he waxith thorny and full of spynys The wild got went to this tree while it was
in erbe both young and tendir and fed him self thereof sobyrlye and swetelye.
Aftyr a while this wild got remembringe of the sweet relece of this tree.
Returnyd again to him willing to ete of him as she had done before times.
But this tree was than replete with thornys which were indurate and hard /
that when this goote tastyd and gnewe of them / they were infixed and stak
fast in her throat / and in the palate of her mowth and greuyd hersore. This
best for anguysshe and great pain and for tourmentis that she suffirde
cursid this tree and said in this wise.

Cursyd wretch thy beginning was good.
Now art thou alterde in to a wykked mood.
SO manyon makyth a good beginnynge / but they bring it to no good ending.
Wherefore they induce malediccyon upon them self / as Jerome says. In a Christian
man a good ending is lawdid and commended more than a good begynnyge. For
Pawle began iuyll and endyd well / Otherwhile the begynnyge is lawdyd / and the
ending is damnyd / as Isidor says. The end is euyr to be sowghte in the life
of man. For God beholdith not what we have be. But in owre last ending what
we be. And Cipriane says. Aftyr his last end every man shall be sauyd or
dampnyd. There was sometime a knight willing to entyrin to relygion attendinge
the great offencis and parellys that he had done with his tongue. wherefore he
sent his servant unto ye abbot to show him his purpose / and also to say
to him that he was mute and redye to be obedyent in every thing And he was
receyuyd there / and they believed that he cowde not speak. And when he had
continuyd there and greatly profytyd / the abbotte led him to an othr knight
that yt labowrid in extremys. And when this knight saw him greatly trowblyd in
his departinge from ye world he wept hugelye. And when they were departed
from the knight / there came an other knight and met with that same abbot and
made faithful promysse to him yt as soon as he might have oportunite he would
entyr in to relygion. And so he went forth before them. And as he went ouir a
brygge he slode and fell inn / and was drownyd. And the other knight going
with the abbot saw the soul of the drownyd knight born up to heuyn with
Aungellys in likeness of a monk. whereof he lawghid and reioycyd greatly. And
the abbot adsuryd him and commaundid him in the vertewe of obedience yt if he
might speak / he should tell why he lawghid so. And he answerde and said. Thou
have done puyl to cawse me speak again my will. And forthwith he told the
abbot like as he had seen. and ye abbot when he hard his saynges / he felldowne
prostrate before the knight and he took him curteisly and prayde hi^ to include
hi^ that he might observe and keep his purpose.

Of a tree called Myrtus and of the syke woman Dialogo.xxxiiii.


MIrtus after the opinion of Isydore ethi mologiarum.xvii.is a tree named of
the sea / for that cawse that it growith on these bankys much. Therefore of
lechis in bokys of lechecrafte they be called mirene / and this tree is apt to
women in many necessiteys / as they write / wherefore there was a syke woman
which had spente and consumyd all her goodis in lechis and medecynes / and
cowde find no remedy / and at last she went to the sea and found this Myrte
in the sea bankys to the which she made her prayers and said. O thou fair
tree have mercy of me / and grant to me vnfortunable creature oon of thy
braunchis that I may cure me / and put away mine infirmyte. To whom this Myrte
answerde and said. If I give to the part of me what reward shall I have. To
whom she said. Gold and silver have I noon / for I have consumyd all my
goodis in this disease But this I promise to Godde and to the / that in my
prayers I shall euyr have the in remembrance / and of such goodis as God shall
send me here aftyr I shall depart with the. Quod the Myrte thou have promised
me a great reward if thou will pray for me to God almyghtye. Therefore come
to me and take what the lykith / and give me noon other good / but oonly keep
thy promise / and also he said.

To give them and help them that for us will pray
We be all bownde and not to say Nay.


IN likewise we owe to do to the servants of almighty God / that they may
pray for us to him. For holy prayers may obtain what they will of owr Lord
as says the gloss. Orysons and prayers defendith us from the Ire of God as a
bokler defendith the body fro strokys. And Origene says Oon godeman
preuaylyth more in prayinge than many sinners in fighting / as it is
exemplyfied. Exodi.xvii. When Moses was in deserte with the children of
Israel. A king called Amalech faught with him. And when Moses saw his
adversary prevail / and he should have be overcome / he made recourse unto his
prayers / and lift up his hondes unto heuyn and prayde / and then his people
had the bettyr. And wha^ he secid and laid down his hondes / his enymyes
had the bettyr. The handis of Moses were ponderows / and weke / and he might
not long hold them up. wherefore as it is wryttyn.ii. men Aron and Vr / and
one of them went to the right arm. An other to the left arm of Moses / and
sustaynyd them / that they were still erecte unto the time their enymyes fled
and durst no longer bide. Whereby it aperith that prayer cawsithe victory in
batell bodylye apparent. It is read in historiis transmarinis. That when
Godfray of Bolayne / and his lordis were in the sege of Antioche / and Carbera
Prince of Cheualrye of the king of Perce / with a great multitude of Turkys
and Sarazyns had laid them rownde about. They were so sore afflicte with
hongre and thruste / that they had nothing to ete / and there horsys for great
ho^gre ete ye barkis of treys / and wha^ they had made there prayers to God /
they came out manly again the Turkis ready to iubarde there lyuis / and god sent
upon them / and upon their horsis a Celestyall dew. By the swetnesse of the
which both they and their horsis were so fortified and refresshid by the space
of three days that they overcame the sarazyns and put the^ to flighte and took
many of them / and there goods. whereby it aperith how preualent prayer is /
wha^ it is proferryd with devotion and swettenes.

Of the high Cedretre. Dialogo.xxxv.


A Cedretre high and apparente was plantyd in a mowntayne which showed above
all other plesauntlye / in somoche that manyon went up to se it / and of that
sight they were greatly Cheryd. And commandid it with great commendacyon.
Wherefore this Cedre magnyfied her self inwardly and said within her self. I am
greatly spokyn of / and lawdid of every man for my lawdable beawte which is
worthy to be lawdyd But I trow that if the small plantis and treys that be
grene and grow rownde about me / were cut down or pluckyd up I should apere
most goodely and large withowt comparyson. Therefore me thinkith it most sure to
mayme them / or fell them down be times / or they ascend to high / that they
take not away my worship nor appayre it. And thus saying she cawsid all the
young plantys and treys that grew abowte her to be cut down / and pluckyd
up by the rote. Wherefore she aperyd nakyd and bare and within few days a
great wind blewe fro the mowntaynes and the proud Cedre was Curuate and
overthrow / and pluckyd up by the Root. And than she spoke and said with
great heaviness.

They that be rulers may nothing avail.
If they that be vndyr of help does them fail
But manyon will not believe that / but rathir covet them self oonly to apere
worshypfull / and to destroy other that be under. As it is exemplyfyed / how
the olyue and the great rissh stryuyd togider and the olyue said to the
rissh. Thou art but an unprofitable wretch / but I am preualent / for I
mynistre oil unto the help of man. To whom the rich answerde and said. Thou
shall see anon of what profyt I am / and suddenly she was blowyn with a great
wind / from oon way to an other / and as the wind chawngyd so she bowyd /
and had no harm. And than she said to the olyur. More auaylyth wekenesse with
meekness / then strength with pride. A child when he is born geuyth us
exemple of humylyte / for he is born to live like a beast crokyd and on all
sour / for as Dauyd says. He is comparyd unto bestis insypiente and made like
unto them / and also he is born wepinge and not lawghinge / as it is written
Sapience.vii. The first voice of all I have showed in wepinge. And saint
Augustyn says in his book de Ciuitate Dei. A child when he is born beginnith
with wepinge. Not knowinge what hurt he shall suffer. Allonly zoroastes
lawghid wha^ he was born / and nevertheless his lawghtir profited him but
little. For he was the first inuentowre and begynner of art magyk / and
wychecrafte / and he was a king called king of Bactryanys / but
notwithstondinge he was slain of the king of Assyrye that was called Nynus.
Saint Johan also says that owre Lord weppyd when he Reysyd lazar / and the
chief cawse of his wepinge was for that he was in manner constrained for the
gostely health of diverse personys to call up his most tenderly beloved friend
unto this troublous and mortal life. Wherefore as solinus says. A custom has
continuyd among certain people / and yet it continuyth. That when a child is
born / the fader and mother of it make great lamentacyon and mournige. And when
it is deed / it is brought to the grave with great mirth and gladness.

Of twayn diverse treys. Dialogo.xxxvi.
TReys twayn grewenygh togider upon an hyl side. Of the which oon was fair and
goodely in appearance / and fresshly leuyd and fruitful. The other was old and
vncomlye to behold To these tway treys came much people / and seeing the
great dissymilitude between them. They said. It were rightful and well done
to smite down ye foul tree the which so greatly defacyth and apeyrith the beawte
of the other tree. And when they would have smytte it down. The tree spoke to
them and said. O ye wise men / it is written in the law / Leuitici.xix. Judge
thou rightfully to thy Neybowre. For when owr lord by his power went again
Sodom to Judge the wicked men and sinners of that contre / he said unto
Abraham. Gene.xviii. The clamowre of Sodom is greatly multiplied I shall
descend and behold whedyr they have fulfilled in deed the clamowre that has
come to me. as who says. Give not always credence to wicked talis or euyr ye
be assuryd of the proof. Therefore a judge may not punysh sin / but oonly that
is openly known. Whereof hit is written Johannes octauo. That owre Lord said
unto the woman that was accusyd in adulterye. Noman has condempnyd the woman
/ and she answerde and said thus. Noman good Lord. And owre Lord said. Nor
I shall condemn the. Therefore dampne me not tell ye have prouyd of my frewte.
For owr savior says. Mat.vii By their frewtys ye shall know them. The people
stood still herynge this / and assayde of the frewte. And when they had
tastyd of the fair tree / and found no good releece in the frewte thereof. They
despysyd both ye teee and the frewt / and made a proof of the foul treys
frewte. and they found it swetely sauowrid and delycyouslye relecyd. and all
they togider gave laud to God and commendid the frewte and said.

Science and wisdom it is very deed.
To make a dew proof / or the sentence proceed.
ISydore says. Condemn no man before he be iugyd. First prove and then judge
/ for thou art bound to know the trowth or thou give sentence. and Gregory
says. He that dampnithe a just man / sleyth the man living. and he that
intendith to save the wicked man / besieth him self to quyckyn the deed / a
judge should neuyr proferre any sentence in ire nor withowte great examinacyon.
For it is wryttyn Prouerbi.xxvii. Ire has no mercy / whereof Valery tellith in
his sixte book. Cap.ii. That king Philippe / when he was in ebriate and
replete with wine / he gave a wrong sentence again a widow / and she came to
him and said she apelyd fro Philippe vnsobre unto Philippe sobre. and when he
had digestyd that wine he rouokyd his sentence / a like tale is told of a
sinful woman / the which was cruelly iugid of Tholome king of egypt. and she
withowte fere or dread appelyd unto the benygnyte of the same king. Which he
consyderinge aftirwarde reuokyd his sentence / and said / that the benygnyte
and meekness of him be very law / owith to over come all his judgment that
procedid of cruelte.

Of the Dolphyn and the Ele. Dialogo.xxxvii.


DElphinus is a fissh of the which Isidore wrytteth Ethimologiar.xii. where he
says that Dolphyns have this custom that they follow the voice of man. Or
unto the noise of a symphan they will lightly come togider. Nothing in the sea
is more swyfte. For oftyntymes they overtake ships saylynge and ouerpasse
them. When they play in the floodes and leepe and make great labowre in the
wawes of the sea. They signyfie great tempests. These be called properly
symones. It is also the dolphyns kind with sharp prickys in his back to sle
crocodylles / ryppinge the soft belyes of them. There was a sertayne dolphyn in
the sea that found an Ele / among the flodes / and stoppid her passage and
pursewyd aftyr her. And when he had takyn her of tyntymes he cowde not keep her
/ she was so slypper / that euyr she escapid. Whereof the Dolphyn was greatly
sorye. The Ele willing to mock the Dolphyn and to escape from him / she spoke
sotelly to him and said. O thou merueylous Dolphyn I sorrow hugely for the. For
thy labowre is great to swym thus aftyr me / and thy heart is not merry. But
thou labowrist in vain / for thou shall never take me / in the depnesse of the
watyr. But goo with me into the mudde / and in to the dry grownde / and thou
shall have me at thy will. This dolphyn was folyssh and had lost his wit /
for angyr and gulosite / and swam aftyr the ele a great pace / intendinge to
destroy her. The Ele brought the dolphyn unto shalowe watyrs and sprange in to
ye mydde / and said to the dolphyn / come to me for the rotys of the erbys
shall let my passage / and thou may satisfye thyn apetite of me. The Dolphyn
made a great lepe to catch the ele. But she lurkyd under the mudde and the
Dolphyn stak fast in the mire. And within a while there came a fyssher and smote
throw the Dolphyn and said.

He that has affection with his enymye to goo
His hurt is to be dowbtyd of his mortal foo.
BEware and despise therefore not thy enymye though he be not mighty / but trust
him not / and beware that he deceive the not / for Seneca says. A weke enymye
it is wisdom to dread / it is told in the moral lore of philosofers that
xerses king of Mede / ordained a great batell again the Grekys / and gadrid
an host innumerable. Wherefore oone of his said unto him. The Grekys shall
never abide the Iubardye of thy great host / but they shall turn there backys
as soon as euyr they here of thy coming / an other of his servants said unto
him. It is to be drad that the king shall find cyteys and townys deserte and
void of inhabitauntes / and therefore he shall not mow show the great strenth
of his people. The third also said to ye king. The sea is to narowe for the
ships. The castellys to little for the knights. The feldis not large I nowgh
for the fotemen. The sky very scante to the arows of the innumerable
multitude of the medonys. And whyll that they steryd the king in this wise /
and fortifyed him with great wordis and estymacyon of inuincyble power / and
despisyd there enymyes Damachus the philosofre said to the king. This great
multitude of people that pleasith the. Is to be dredde of the. For it is very
true / that a great multitude of people can never be well ruled. And that
thing which cannot be well ruled may not continewe / and therefore there is
nothing so great but it perissheth. And even so it happyd as this Philosofre
Damachus had before said. For that great puyssawnce of people / thinkinge
them self in suuetye / for lakke of gydynge / and providence was scomfight and
overthrow / of but a few of ware personys / and wyselye ordird by great
polycye and wisdom.

Of the Marmayde and the Lechowre. Dialogo.xxxviii.


SIren is a monstre of the sea / and in owr tongue it is called a Marmayde. For
fro the nauyl upward it is a fair maid. And fro thens downwarde it is al
fissh. This monstre sings so swetely oftyntymes that for the great swetnesse
of her song. Shipmen forgete them self many times / and let their shippis be
vngidid and fall in sleep / and therefore manyon of them peryshe. A sertayn man
unclean myndyd and lecherowsly disposyd saylinge by the sea coostes / espied
this Siren most fair and couetyd her and stered her to lecherye. This monstre
sange merylye and made noise ever the longer the swetter / and ordeynyd her
self ready to disceyue this lecherows man and said to him. As I considre thy
love is great to me. Wherefore if thou wilt have thy desire of me / descend
and come to me in to the floodes / and at thyn own will my body shall be
redye. This man was so sore brent and inflamyd with lecherows desire that he
utterly forgate his own well and took no cure of him self / but madlye lepte
in to the sea / and destroyed him self. And she swam forth in to the sea as she
was wonde to do / and said.

A man that to woman his credence will give.
Ordaynyth a snare him self to myscheue.
Therefore unclean men owe to be ware / that they perissh not throw the beawte
of woman / for that has caused manyon to peryssh / as it is wryttyn
Ecclesiasti.ix. Wherefore the wyseman geuyth wholesome counsel and says in that
same place. Coueyte thou no vyrgyne that thou be not slaundrid in the beawte of
her. For the holy man Job this consydering said. Job.xxxi I have made
conuenaunt with mine eyn that I should not think on a maiden. Wherefore Barnarde
says. The beawte of a woman is like a poysond arowe that woundith the soul
and puttith in venyme. wherefore when Pares had takyn Elayne to his wife /
diverse of the philosofirs came to see her / and when they saw her great beawte
/ they coueryd there Ien and said. Flee we flee we. For truly it noyeth more to
the soul / to behold a fair woman than a foul. As oon rehersith and tellyth
that a philosofre called democritus / put out his own Ien. And as these other
philosofirs show. He did it for three diverse cawsis. The first cawse was / for
his sight lettyd him from his inward good meditacyons The secounde for he was
impacyent to see wretchis and sinners flower in great prosperity. The thryd
for he cowde not look on women / with owte concupiscens and inordynate desire.
And therefore the sight of ye Ien owith to be kept clean / that the soul may be
preseruyd from sinful affection and corrupcyon.

Of a glotonous Fyssh or Best called Venture Marinus. Dialogo.xxxix.


Venture Marinus. Is a belue of the sea Which sechith his meat both in the
watyr and in the land / and also drownyth him self in the wawys of the sea
like a Fissh / and goith on the dry land like a beast. Oon of these upon a
time / when he had sownde mete of the watyr / he ete it on the land / for
cawse that watyrbeastis should notte ete with him / an othertyme wha^ he had
takyn mete on the land. He ete it in the watyrs that it should not be takyn
from him by the beastis of the land. And thus he continued and never departed
of hismetc to any that asked part / but like an insaciable gloton kept all to
him self. Wherefore he was odyows and hateful to all other beastis and fisshes.
The time of age and of affliccyon came on him / and he was both old and
impotent in somoche that he might not swym / nor labowre by ye see nor goo on
the land. Wherefore he was very nedy and hongry and constraynyd with great
pouerte to ask his leuynge for almysse. But forasmoche as he neuyr gave of his
own to other when he had plentye. Noon would depart with him in his necessite.
And therefore he made great heaviness and said.

Seek for help bitterly he shall and seldom speed.
That to noon other wilhelpe at there Need.
MAny such there be / that will nothing depart withal for couetyse and
gulosyte / dredynge that they shall lack sustynaunce and temperall goodis. But
as saint Gregory says. worldely substance is multiplied and increcid when it
is distribute to the pouer people. And also he says. He that geuyth alms.
Receyuith more than he geuyth. And also it is written Proverb.xxviii. He that
geuith to the nedye / shall not be nedye. And he that despises the asker shall
be indigent. when a sertayne person had prechid the Gospel upon a time at
saint Vyctowris. The monkys of the same place asked of him why they were
powrer in goodis / and more grievously indettyd / than they were wonde to be /
and notwithstondynge they l^uyd more sparynglye / and there rentis and lyuylode
were increcyd. To whom he answerde and said that they sometime had a proctowre
in there house which ordained the^ all thing needful. But becawse he was
iniustelye expulsyd owte of the abbay with his fellow. For that time there might
no plentye grow / till he were reuokyd and called home again / and his name
was dabitur vobis / yt was goon with his fellow called date. But and if they
would keep their customable hospytalyte / as they had before vsyd. He should
return again and bring with him great had oundance and plente / saying owr
Lord Jesus / Give ye and it shall be geuyn unto you. Luce sexto.

Of a Fissher and of.v. Fisshys. Dialogo.xl.


FIsshes.v.called dentales / young fall and lustye swam in the sea floodes. But a
Fissher coming bye and seeing them cast his nettis and ordained to them. These
fisshes seeing that said. Good it is that we stronglye swym togider / and break
the nettis / that they never shall dysceyue fyssh more / for we be strong and
we may vyolently perform owre intent / by the Reason of owre great might and
strength In the depnesse of the watyr lay an old fissh and a wise called a
stourgyn. And when he had hard all this / he rose up and went to these young
fysshes and said Children your thought is but folly. I counsel you if ye love
your health to eschew the nettis / or else ye shall make great mournige and
heaviness when ye be takin in them and be in danger and not escape. These
Fisshes which were young and lustye trustinge to themself and despisinge the
wholesome counsel of there senyour Ioynyd there strenghthis togider and swam in to
the nettis trustinge to disruppe them and break them. But the nettis mollyfied
themself that the stroke of them might not prevail / and so they were takyn /
and aftirwarde they weppid and made great lamentation and said.

Good it is always counsel to have.
Of such as be wise / that from parell may save.
Therefore I advise every man to attend to the counsel of them that be sad /
and wise / and not to the Counsel of yongmen and folys. For folys louith folly
and all thercounsell a greyth to the same / yongmen have no very ripe reason /
and they love tho things that long to yowth / and they be apliable unto them
/ as says Job.xii. In agid folk is wisdom / and in long time great
prudence. Wherefore it is commaundid Ecclesi. The narracyon of senyours let not
pass the. For they have lernyd of there fadirs before time / as Tullye says be
senectute. Great things be not gidyd be strength / or swyftnes / or fyersnes
of the body / but by counsel Maturite and scyrnce. Gyuers of good counsel
do more then other / for they be like unto gouernowris in a ship. Wherefore
Philosofers preuaylyd in great batellys by there great counsel / rathir then
princes with all these harneys and strength / as it is said prouerbio.xxiiii.
Batell is begone with preordinaunce and disposycyon / and there shall be health as
is good counsel. Therefore Alexander optaynyd and had victory / for he guydyd
his oste by counsel / as says Pompeyus Trogu^ libro tercio. Alexander when he
should goo to a iubardows batell. He chose no young men to goo with him / but
old men and wise / especyally of his counsel / and such as had been in
counsel with his fader and in service with hi^ before time / yt not oonly
knights but masters of knights they were acountyd. and of his other
serua^tis there went noon with him vndyr the age of. lx. yeris. And contrary was
of the oste of darye / and therefore Alexander was victoriows / and Darius was
victe and overcome / and so it aperith that good counsel gretely preuaylyth.

Of a see wolf called Lucyus / and a serpent called Basiliscus. Dialogo.xli.


The sea wolf called Lucyus / has in his right cheke a spyne or a bone like
to a cross. And if thou seek diligently / thou shall find it. Take it and
wrappe it in a lynen cloth / and bear it with the / and thou shall not be takyn
of thyn enymyes / and if thou be takyn they shall not be takyn of thyn enymyes
/ and if thowe be takyn they shall not long keep the / and it is said that
this has been oftyn prouyd. There is a serpent called Basyliscus aftyr the
langage of Greek. In Latin hit is called Regulus / forasmoche as it is king of
all serpentis / as wrytteth Isidore. And in englyssh some folk callyth it a
Cokatrice. All serpentis seeing him be ferefull / and slay fro him / for with
his smelling he sleyth them. With his breath also / and with his look he
destroys al thing that berithe life. For the sight of him harmeles no bird
can escape. And though she be far from him / she is deuowrid and brent with
his mowth. Notwithstanding a wesyll ouercomith him. Therefore men bear these
wesyls unto the cauys where as these serpentis lurkyth / for almighty God left
nothing without remedy. This serpent Basylyscus seeing the wesyll fleyth /
whom Mustela called in Englyssh a wesyll / purswith and kyllyth. And this
Mustela is but a little best of half a foot long and spottyd with white
spottis. These serpentis Reguly be scorpyons having there being there dryness
is. And when they come to watyr they bread. Idrophodos and Lymphaticos / for
they Intoxicate and poison the watyrs and cawse the^ to be dedly noyhable to
man. This regulus also is called sibilis of many folk / for with his hyssing
somtym and oftin he sleith or euir he bite or styng. thus hiderto writith of
hi^ Isidor. lib.xii.ca.iiii. but Plinius. lib.viii.ca.xxii. says, Emo^ge the
hespery Ethiopis is a well. Which is supposyd to be the head of Nyle / nygh
unto the which is a wild beast or serpent called Cacoblephas / but little of
body / slow in all his membris / beringe a grievous head / which continually
is lokynge downwarde to the earth. Or else he should be destruccyon of all man
kind. For all men that should behold the eyn of him should dye. Of equal
strength is this serpent of the basyliske or Cokatrice / and he is bred in a
prouynce called coronea / and his body conteynith in length.xii. fyngers long
/ and he goyth with a white spotte on his head / and he has a crown on his
head or a comb. With his hysfynge he puts all serpentis to flyghte / and he
wrappyth not his body in many foldyngis / but he is erecte and high in going
/ He dries up fruit treys / and brennith and exurith herbis / not oonly in
towchinge / but also with his blaste and hyssynge he corruptith and destroys
all thing lyinge rowndeabowte him. He is also of so great venymosyte and
pernycyon that he destroys and sleyth them that towche him / with pole or
shafte be it never so long withowt tariynge / Mustela destroys this serpent
and ouercomith him. For to god it pleasith to ordeyne all thing with remedy
and every creature to have his peer. And also the death of this serpent cawsyd
by the wesyll is also the death of the wesyll and that cawsith the great
stenche of the serpent. And this is very trowth but if this little mustele this
we fill be defensyd with frycacyon and rubbing of rewe / and fedynge of the
same erbe / which meruelously defendith fro poysonde sauowres as says
Aristotle and also auycenne. First therefore this little wesyll goyth and etith
of this erbe rewe / though that it be bettyr. And so by ye vertewe of the iuse
of this byttir erbe / she goith boldly agayneher enymye and ouercomith hi. and
though this serpent basyliscus be venymous withowt remedy whyl he is leuyng
nevertheless when he is brent in to asshis he lesyth the malice of his venyme
/ and the asshis of him be thought profitable in the operacyo^s of alkymye and
especyally in transmutacyons of metallys. This sarpent basiliscus went unto the sea side in the habyte of a monk like as he had been a relygyous man / and
called unto him this for said see wolf or luce and said. O brodyr forasmoche
as thowe art signyd with the sign of the cross I am assuryd that thou art a
perfight Christian man. Therefore com to me for I desire to be lernyd of the
crystis faith. And to be crystened / that I may escape the dredefull judgment
of God / and to have fruycyon of everlasting joy. This lucius beholdinge this
serpent and knowinge him spoke unto him and said. O thou false ypocryte. A
cowle makith not a monk. Nor clothis of relygyon make not a Relygyous man /
but vertewe and Relygyous conuersacyon. Thy wordys be wicked and dowble / for
thew intendist not to be crystened of me / but rathir thou thinkyst to disceyue
me and to poison me / and therefore I will not here ye / And this ^ssh
immediatlye coueryd him self in the watyr and swa^ forth and left yt serpent
with confusyon and said.

A false ypocryte full of pomp and pride.
Is euyr subtle all vertewe laid a side.
OF all such owr sauyowr commaundith us to beware saying. Mat.vii. be ye ware
of them yt comt^yow in their clothinge like sheep / For inwardly they be woluis
rapawnte / of ye which Isidor spekith and says ypocrytes be very bad inwardlye
and in things secret And openly in things apparent they show them self to
be very good. To such it is conuenyently said by the word of God.
Mat.xxiii. Woe be to you ye false ypocrytes / for ye be made like unto white
beryellys or grauys / which apere fair owtwarde / and within they be full of
Rotyn bonys / of deed men. And you in likewise apeere owtewarde unto men good
and ryghtwis But within ye be replete with auaryce and wyckednes. It is read
that when saint Hillarye was goone to dispute again heretics. The Devil
folowid him in lyknes of a servant / and brought his Cope aftyr him / and
was very seruycehable to him in many other things. And as it had been for
compassyon he prayde saint Hyllari to meddle but little watyr with his wine for
cause of his labowre / and he was greable. And aftyr that he desyrid him to
drink pure wine / withowte any delay of watyr. And so he did. And then he
mouyd him to ete flessh / and so he changed his penance and took him to
flessh. And aftirwarde when they came togider to a town he told saint hylarye
there was a Relygious woman desyringe to speak with him. And wha^ they had
talkyd togider the holy man was infecte with concupiscens and sawghte the
meanys how for to follow his flesshly apetite. But it was showed unto him by
the Reuelacyon of God and of saint Martyne / that it was the workynge of the
Devil. And saint Martyne came and expulsyd him and shewid him as he was. And
thus almighty God delyueryd Hillary from temptacyon by the great merits of
saint Martyne

Of the Sturgyon that went to the sea. Dialogo.xlii.


A Sturgyon great and famowse lay in a floode of pade which is in Lombardye /
who^ all fisshes of pade worshipped and dred / for his great excellence and
strength. Wherefore he was lift up with in him self / and said. What is it
vaylehable or worshypfull to me to be associate to fisshes of lome degree. For
though they refer to me lawde and honowre / they be of no reputacyon. Bettyr
it is to me to goo to the great see / which is so large and spacyows where as
be Fisshes without no^bre and great beluys of ye see / and diverse othr / for of
the^ I shall be magnified for my worthiness / and I shall be very famous emonge
them. and thus saying he departed fro the floodes / and swam to the sea. and
while ye he was there and beheld ye fisshes so great and fierce he repentid
sore his doing for ye ferefull sight of the^. He couetyd greatly to tourn again
/ not knowig what was best to do for ye great furyousnes of ye bestes / among
alothr felchus which as a beast or a fissh of ye for named a see calls most
cruel and dredefull came and lokyd upon this sturgyon and said unto him. why
art not thou shanre fast to go among them yt be so great above ye / without
ye license of them. Certainly thou shall not be unpunished / and with yt same
word he went to him and destroyed him and said.

Every man chastise him self and amend.
By example of him that vaynlye would ascend
Therefore when any person is great and sufficiently honowrid in any place.
Stody he not to apere gretter. Nor to be conuersaunt emonge lorbis and statis /
yt be of excellent power / nor assocyate him self unto them. For Seneca says.
A small thing may not long stand with a great. And also he says. A ship
is great in appearance / being in the floode. But in ye great see he semyth
but little. The gydynge yt to some ship is great / to some is but small. There
is a fable yt when ye frogge saw a great fat ox lyinge in ye pasture / she
desirid to be as great as he. And when this frogge had inflate and blowyn her
self / as great nygh as ye skin would hold. She asked of her children if she
were not so great as ye ox. and they said. No. The frogge blew her skyn
gretter than she didfirst time. Intending to be as great as ye ox / and so her
skyn was ouyr straynyd and brast and she dyed / therefore it is not good any man
to erecte or lift up him self more then becomythe him yt he perissh not as did
the frogge. For Isidore says All pride lies somoch yt lower. How much he
desires to be high. For why. Angel for pride was made a Devil / king sawle
also for the same was made a ^emonyak and Nabudonosor was made like a beast
and all for the sin of pride.

Of a Lampurn and a watyrbeaste called Crocodilus. Dialogo.xliii.


MVrenula as says Brito is a fissh lyk to an ele. In Englyssh called a
Lampurn. Upon a time this Lampurn fownde the children of a waterbeaste that is
called Crokodylus / Which is like unto a lacerte. And wha^ she had behold them
she killed them and went forth her way This beast Crocodilus when he was come
again and saw his children deed / he was bitterly greuid / and made sorrow
more than can be told of / and disposyd hi^ with all his might and power to
avenge the death of his children. Wherefore he went daily in haberionys and
harneys and lay in a wait for to sle the Lampurn. And upon a time he fownde
a cruel serpent and a venymows and believed that he had be a Lampurn and went
again him and said. Thowe cursyd wretch. Now shall not thowe escape. For
thowe slewyste my Children cruelly withowte cawse. Therefore now I shall slay
the and destroy the. To whom this Serpent answerde and said. Be thou ware and
well aduysed by my counsel / for I am no Lampurn but a poysonde serpent / and
if thou presume to come to me I shall soon infecte the / with my venyme. Then
said the Crokodyll. Thou canste not disceyue me / nor hyde the from. For thou
art no serpent / but thou art a Lampurn and thou art made as she is in every
point. And therefore I shall slay the. And while this crocodyll in great haste
/ and with great wodenesse ran to sle him. The serpent fortified him self and
bote him and poison de him and said.

With him yt is vnknowyn to chyde or to fight
Noman owith that intendith to do right.
ANd therefore noman presume to fight with him that he knowith not / though he
be but of small power. For vertewe restith not always in the great stature of
the person / but rathir in the heart / and in ye wisdom of the fighter. For
Golye despysyd Dauyd and yitte was he slain of him. primo Regum decimosepti.
Be thowe ware also to fall in batell for Ire Vengeance or Couoytise. For he
that is irefull trowythe that he may do more then all other / and therefore his
power is the less / as Seneca says. Evermore the wrathful man thinkyth he
may do more then he may. And he also says. The irefull man is oftyn
forgetful of the law. Wherefore the philosofre says. The law beholdith the
irefull man in his wrath. But he in his wrath seyth not the law. Therefore
wrath is to be departed from the soul / for it is said Prouerbiorum.xxvii.
Ire has no mercy. And therefore a judge should never proferre any sentence
while he is in ire / ^or mouyd with wrath. It is read in the cronicles of
Themperowris of Rome / that when Otto the first had ordained a great feast to
his Princes and lordis in the high solempnyte of eftyr. Before or they were
set / the son of a great Prince being but a babe and of tender age / of
very chyldehode took a mess fro the Table. Wherefore the sewer in great anger
smote the child with his fyste and ouirthrewe him. The mastyr of the child
that seeing and being greatly mouyd with ire. Smote the sewer and kyllyd him.
Wherewith the Emperowre was greatelye disspleasyd / and in his anger would have
dampnyd him withowte any audience. But he Caught the Emperower and threw him
to grownde and began to choke him. And the Emperowr when he was delivered with
great difficulte fro his hondis. Comaundid him to be kept / and said that he
him self was culpable and fawtye / that he gave not dew honowre unto the high
feste / Wherefore he commaundid him freely to be let goo and to have lybertye.

Of a Luce and a Tenche. Dialogo.xliiii.


Upon a time there was a Fissher that fisshed / and hid his hookis sotellye /
and shewid unto the fissh the delycyows bayte / a Luce and a Tenche beholdynge
the plesaunte bayte / desyrid it greatly. But the Luce was wytty and said to
the Tenche. This mete semyth very good and delicate / but nevertheless I trow
that it be put here to disceyue Fisshes. Therefore let us forsake it / that we
be not lost by the foul apetyte of glotonye. Trincha than spoke and said. It
is but folly to forsake so good a morsel and so delycyous / for a little
vain dred For rathir I my self shall at taste of it first / and dyne with it
with great pleasure and swettenesse. And Tarry thou and behold my chance. And
while that she swalowyd in the mete / she felt the hokys that were hydds. And
she would feign have retournyd bakwarde. But the Fissher pluckyd her up to him,
and the Luce fled swyftlye and said thus.

Of othirmennys sorrow corected mote webe.
Euyr that fro parell we mow escape free.
SO we owe to be ware by correccyon and hurt of othirmen / as says Caton. The
hurt of thineybowre mote chastise the. and Seneca says. Good it is to espy
what is to be left by the punysshment of other and also he says. a wyseman
amendith his own fawt by consyderacyon of an other mannys fawte. and also the
same clerk says / he is wise that can disspose well his besynes / and beware
of harm to him self by exemple of othirmen / as Isope rehersith in his Fablis.
That a Lion was syke and faynte and lay in his cave. To whom there came
diverse beastis to vysyte him in his infirmyte / and when he saw advantage /
and they were nere him / he cawght them and ete them at last came the Fox
unto him for cawse of vysitacion / and stood all withowte / before the mowth of
the cave / and would not entyr in to the cave for he dradde to come nere the
Lion. To whom the Lion said. Come hyder my dear sustre that we may frendely
and louynglye talk togider. The Fox answerde and said thus to the Lion.
Certainly I espy well / the fotynge of diverse bestis going inward. But I see
noon Coming owtewarde. and therefore pardone me. For I will come no nere.

Of a Scalye Fyssh called Regyna / and a watyrsarpent called Idrus. Dialogo.xlv.


THere is a Fissh called Regina and it is a scaly fissh / and takyn in the
floodes. And she is called Regina of a Verb. Rego / is / that sygnifieth in
Englyssh to rule or to govern. For she rulyth her self very well. A
waterserpent called Idrus having many heedis came upon a time to this Fissh
and said. O Regina most fair to me before all other fisshes thou art in
great fauowre / and most interly beloved. And therefore I will be knytts unto
ye and sacryd by holy matrimony / and for that cawse frendely at this time I am
come unto the. To whom Regyna answerde and said thus. That may not be. For
it is not convenient. It is wryttyn Ecclesiastici.xiii. Every beast louyth his
own likeness / and so every man louyth his own Neybowre. Every thing that
berithe life desires to be conioynyd to his assembleable. And every man shall
be assocyate to his own symylitude. Therefore and forasmoche as thou art not of
my kynrede nor of my kind thou shall neuyr be socyate unto me. This serpent
Idrus seeing that he was derydyd and deceyuyd of his purpose retournyd homewarde
again with confusyon and said.

I am confused utterly and plainly forsake.
My joy is for euir goon / mirth shall I neuyr make.
EVery Christian man should so answer to the Devil when he temptith him / for
he is the old serpent more subtyle than any thing living that is under heuyn
as it is wryttyn Genesis tertio. And therefore thus should every creature say
unto him. Go thou fro me / for thowe art not of my kind. Nor thou art noon
of them that shall be sauyd. And if thou do thus he cannotte abide. For it is
wryttyn Iacoby.iiii. Resyste ye the Devil and he shall fle fro you / and the
Apostill says. Be ye strong in batell and fight ye with the old serpent.
Therefore we must fight again him and we shall have victory. For he is but
feeble again them that will with stand him / as Isidore says The Devil is
dredefull in the sight of them that be worldely and flesshly dyssposyd. But in
the sight of the^ that be elect and godly the dread of him is vile / and not
set bye. As by an example is showed in vitis pat. That sometime there was a
brodir of Relygion that retournyd unto the world again / and there he spottyd
him self with lecherye and with other vices / and became servant to
allmaner of sins and so contynewyd long. but by Grace he repentyd him / and
was very penytent / and soorye / and lyuyd strayghtlye / in a Sepulcher / or
Charnell hows / And there he chastised him self in diverse manners with great
penance long season. and fendes temptyd him oftyntymes and promised him
richesse and bodyly pleasure / and at the last they beat him till he was nyghe
deed and when the fendis saw him stedfastlye continue in prayer and wepinge /
they cried owte and said. Thou have overcome us monk thou have overcome us /
and so they fled all away. and the goodman remembringe the malice and
wickedness of them purposyd verylye in his mind rathir to dye than to obaye
unto the fendes. and so was he chaungyd fro sin and made like unto an angel
in vertewe / to good Example of many folks etc.

Of a Fyssh called a Carpe / and a Fissh called Tymallus. Dialogo.xlvi.


IT happyd in a great solemn Feste. Fisshes of the floode walked togidre
aftyr dynar in great Tranquillyte and peace / for to take there recreacyon and
so lace / but the Carpe began to trowble the Feste erectynge him self by pride
and saying / I am worthy to be lawdyd above all other / for my flessh is
delicate and sweet more then it can be told of. I have not be nourrisshed
nothir in dychesse / nor ston dynghwatyrs nor pondes / but I have be brought
up in the floode of the great guard. Wherefore I owe to be Prince and regent
among all you. There is a Fissh called Tymassus / having his Name of a flower
/ for Timus is called a flower. And this Tymallus is a fissh of the sea / as
says Isidore / Ethimologiarum.xii. and all though that he be fauoureable in
sight and detectable in taste / yet moreouir the Fyssh of him sineslyth sweet
like a flower and geuith a plesaunte odor And so this Fyssh Tymallus / heringe
this saying of the Carpe had great scorn of him and sterte forth and said.
It is not as thou sayste. For I shine more bright then thowe and excede the in
odowre and relece. Who may be comparyd unto me / for he that tyndith me has a
great tresowre. If thou have thy dwelling oonly in the watir of guard. I have
mine abiding in many large floodes. And so emonge them were great stryuis and
contencyons. Wherefore the feste was tournyd in to great trowble / For some
fauowryd the part of the one and some of the other / so that be lykly hode
there should have grown great my schefe emonge them. For every of them began
to snak at other and would have torn each other on small pecys. There was monge
all other a fissh called Truta euyr mouyd to break strife. And so this trowte
forasmoche as she was agid / and well lernyd she spoke and said. Bredryn it is
not good to strive and fight for vain lawdatowris and praysers. For I praise
not my self though some personis think me worthy to be commendid / for it is
wryttyn. Themowth of an other man mote commend the and not thyn own. For all
commendacyon and lawde of him self is foul in ye mouth of the spekar. Therefore
bettyr hit is that those that praise them self goo togider to the sea judge that
is the Dolphyn which is a just judge and a rightful and dredinge God for he
shall rightfully detertermyn this matter. This counsel plesyd them well and
forth went these twayn togider unto the Dolphyn and showed to him all there
minds / and to there power comendid the^self. To whom the dolphyn said.
Children I neuyr saw you tell this time for ye be always hid in the floodes
and I am steringe in the great wawys of the sea. Wherefore I cannot give
ryghtfull sentence between you / but if I first assaye and make a taste of
you And thus saying he gave a spring and swalowyd them in both two and said.

Noman owith him self to commend.
Above all other last he offend.
ANd so some folk lawde and commend them self and there own dedys desyringe
to erecte and lift up them self by pride and vanyte above all other. But lowlye
people and rightful despise them self. And gregory says. Then owr workys
grow and increce by me ryte when they be lest set bye in owre own minds.
Whereof it is wryttyn. Job.xxxi. If I kiss my hand with mine own mowth / that
is a great wickedness. He kyssyth his own hand that praysith his own
dedys. Therefore Verite and Trowthe / him self techyth us saying. Luce.xvii.
When ye have perfourmyd all thing that is commaundyd you / say ye. We have
done as we owght to do and yitte be we unprofitable seruauntis. It is in
Fables that birds fownde a neste Ornate of Rooses and Flowers / and the Egle
King of all birds said that the neste should be geuyn to the most noble
bird. And he cawsyd all the birds of heuyn to be called togider / and asked
of all them which was the most fair bird. And the Cuckowe answerde and
said. The Cuckowe. And the Egle demaundid which was the strengest bird / and
the Cuckowe said I. And the Egle was greuyd and said. Thou unhappy Cuckowe
thou euyr praysist thy self and nevertheless thou art not fairest / dor
swyftest. Nor stre^gest. Nor thy song is not very sweet. But thowe euyr cryest
oone cry. And therefore I give this sentence of da^pnacyon against the / that
thou (...) have this neste nor noon other. In likewise many folks euyr praise
and commend them self and sing allwaye oon song like the Cuckowe.

Of the Frogge and the Crabbe. Dialogo.xlvii.
THe Frogge upon a time when she saw the Crabbe swymmynge by the watersyde
spoke and said. What is he this so foul and uncomely yt is so bold to trouble
my watyr. Forsomoch as I am mighty and strong both in watyr and land I shall go
and drive him away. And aftir this saying she made a lepe as though she would
have oppressyd ye crabbe and said. O thou wretch why art not thou shame
fast to entyr in to my resting place. Art not thowe Confused to (...) the
watyr that is so fair and bright when thou a^^^ so foul so black and so
odyows. The Crabbe as he is vsyd to do went euyr bakwarde saying to the Frogge.
Sister say not so. For I desire to have thy love / and to be at peace with
the. Therefore I pray the entyr not upon me with vyolence / And the Frogge
seeing him going bakwarde beleuid that he had done so for fere of her.
Wherefore she began to grieve him more and more / both with words and dedys /
saying withdraw not thy self thowe most foul for thou may not escape. For
this same day I shall feed Fysshes with the. And even forthwith that same
word she made a lepe willing to sle the Crabbe. The Crabbe seeing the great
iubardye and that he cowde not escape. He tournyd him self and disposyd him to
batell and caught the Frogge with his cleys and bote her and plukkyd her to
small pecys and said.

He that to batell is compellyd to goo.
Let him fight manly with his mortal foo.
EVery creature owith as ferforth as euyr he can or may to the uttermost of
his power to fle fro batell and strife. But if he cannot eschew it by no mean
/ or he should suffer him self to dye or to be slain he may to his power fight
and with stand his enymyes. Dauyd the composytor of Psalmis desired to be
crepte and delyueryd from such personys and said. Psalmo. lvii. O good Lord
/ deliver thou me from the^ that rise again me. And also he prayde all such
to be destroyed saying. Psalmo. lxii. Destroy thowe such people as love
batell and fighting. We owe not oonly to fight for owr own cause. But also
for the diffence of owre friends / and especially of fader and mother / and for
the commune profit to be sauyd as Valery shewith in lib.v.cap.iiii. that when
king Daryus had entrid ye coostis of the contray of scythyns. The people of
the same contraye sent to him / and said that they might suffir the
destruccyon of both there vynes and cornys. But and if they towchid the
sepulchris of there friends / then should they feel the power of the scythins /
and the strength of them. For they for diffence thereof and for the commune well
were ready to dye. So we ow to love our frendis and contray somoche / that for
the conseruacyon of them in time of need we shall iubard owre lyuis. Valery
also tellyth libro.v.cap.vii. That when Codrus king of Athenys / was mouid by
his enymys to batell He had an Answer of Apollyne. That his oste should have
victory if he would suffer him self to be slain of his enymyes. The which
answer when his enymyes knew / they comaundid that noman should towche the
king. Then he chaungid his clothinge and went again his enymyes and met with
a knight and smote him with his wepyne / and he fell upon him and kyllyd hi^
And when the body of the king was seyn deed / and known the enymyes fled and
left all their goods behind them. Remembringe that it was before said yt
they should be destroyde.

Of a Fissher and a little Fissh. Dialogo.xlviii


A Fissher as he Fisshed he cawght a little fissh and when he would have killed
him he spoke and said. O gentle Fissher have mercy upon me. for if thou kyl
me thou shall have but little advantage of me. But and if thou will suffer me to
go fre and deliver me from this danger and captivity I promise to God and to
the / that I shall cawse the to have great winning. for I shall return unto
the daily with great multitude of fisshes and I shall led them in to thy
nettis. To who^ the fissher said. How shall I mow know the emonge so many
fisshes. Then said yt fissh. Cut of a little of my tail that thou may know
me among al other. The fissher gave crede^ce to his woordis and cut of his
tail and let him go. This little fissh was ever vncurteys / for contrary to his
promise he lettyd the fissher as oftyn as he should fissh / and withdrewe ye
fisshes from him and said. faders and worshipful senyours be ye ware of that
deceyuar for he deceyuyd me / and cut of my tail / and so shall he serve you
if ye be not ware. And if ye believe not me / believe his workis that apere upon
me. And thus saying the fissh showed the^ his tail yt was cut. wherefore the
fisshes abhorryd ye fyssher and fled from him in all possible haste. The fissher
vsid no more fysshinge. wherefore he leuyd in great pouerte. Of fortune it
happid so that a long while aftir the fissher cawght again the same fissh
emonge other. And when he knew him he kyllyd him cruelly and said.

He that has a good turn and is vncurteys again
It is very rightful that he be therefore slain
Truly many be so unkind that they evermore yield evil for good. To whom it
is said Prou.xvii. He yt yeldith badnesse for godenesse / malice and
cursidnesse shall never depart from the hows of hi^. for that is a great
unkindness and an unworthy reward of good dedys. whereof spekyth Barnarde and
says. Unkindness is enymye to ye soul / destruccyon of good dedys.
Ingratitude is enymy of ye soul a brinnyg wind drying ye well of al pyete / ye
dew of al mercy / ye floodes of all grace / Again unkind men may be reportyd
the example of the pouer Townysshman that daily went to the wood with his ass
/ which also found a dragon^ oppressyd under a tree / and he delivered him
from that perell. And aftirwarde the dragon would have ete the ass / saying
all the grettest services be oftyn times lost But this villane had counsel of
ye fox / which brought the dragon again there he was first and sauyd both
the man and the ass. Also there is a nothir example of Gerarde tenersi which
was in manner of a fool / and had nothing in substance of goods. but he had
a son / and when he saw much people going to the Emperowre berynge him
great gifts / he said with in him self / I shall alsoo goo to the Emperowre
and present him with gifts * such as shall please him / And ye first that he
fownde was a beast called Centaurus. The which beast in the nether parties is
an horse / and in the ouerpartyes it is like a man / and he is swyfte in
rynnynge as an horse. And than he took a bear and ^ode upon him and gave them
both to the Emperowre as of the part and sonde of his lord and fader. To whom
the Emperor sent great gifts again / and made him passingly rich. And aftyr
this immediately this yongman / the son of this Gerarde / faynyd him self to
be deed / and sent word to his Fader to prove what moon he would make for him
/ and he prouyd that his Fader took no care for him / and therefore he set the
less price by his Fader / and thought him very unkind. wherefore says
Gregory. He is not worthy to have gyftys geuyn that referrith not thankynges
for theke yt has been geuyn. And saint Augustyn says. Tho things that God
gave to them that were loving he took fro them that were unkind.

Of the Egle and all other birds / and the lion and all other beastis.
Dialogo.xlix.


Upon a time the Egle was acompanyed and strenghthid with almaner of birds
and took there stondingis and pight there fyldes and faugt again the Lion / and
almaner of beastis. And so daily encresid the nombre of both parties / and
went fierslye to batell every kind again other. And while these batellys thus
had continuyd. The Fox called the swalowe unto him and said. Now is the time
present / that we may redeem owre self owte of captivity and danger. For we
may see ve^geaunce of owre princes that have dominacyon and rule ouir us / let
us do wisely / and we may be polycye ordain that they togider shall fight
them self and every of them shall sle other. And thus to do the swalowe
consentyd / and flewe straygth to the Egle and magnified her greatly and
said. Thou art Queen of all birds and Emperesse / and if thou wylt take heed to my counsel thowe shall be princess / and lady of all beastis. The
Egle consentyd and promised to keep secret this matere. The swalowe retournyd
again to the Fox / and made such ordinance with her and with other / that
the Egle should fight with the Lion / and nomo but oonly they twain. And
which of them that might obtain and be victoriows / should be prince and Ruler
both of birds and beastis. and when they were stryuynge in there batell / the
Egle spoke and said. O Noblesse Leonyne if thou take heed / we be disceyuyd be
false consellowrs. For they hope to be delyueryd of our dominacyon and
lordshippe / and for that cawse they mean and stere us to batell. But certeynly
hit is bettyr that each of us have dominacyon and rule ouyr his own kind /
then that we should shamefully sle euerych othr be there frawdes and sotylteys.
The Lion believed the saynges of the Egle / for he understood verily that it
was true / and so were they acordyd togider as frendis for cuyr and said.

Wicked seductours in deed they be.
That false counsel give iuyll mote they the.
PRinces therefore owe to be ware of such / yt they be not lyghtlye mouyd in
them self for wordys nor talys though they be subtellye told / for there is
many a false deceyuer. And Seneca says. Be thou mouid at the deed doing / and
not at the herynge of the word. Every creature owith to keep him self wisely
and to beware before that he be not disceyuyd of false counsellowres / as it is
written and commawndyd Prouerbi.xxvii. From a badde counselloure keep well thy
soul. A prince owith to have understanding of parellys rownde abowte him. And
especyally of seduccyon and disceyuynge of flaterers. There be many flaterers
like unto Marmaydes which disceyue many by there sweet voices. Of whom it
behouith especyallye to be ware / and to understand there deceytefulnesse.
Wherefore a philosofre called Sensippus kynsman of Plato said unto one that
flaterde him. Thowe flaterer be thowe still. For thou profitiste not. For I
know thyn adulacyon / in the best wise. And therefore thowe canste not begile
me.

Of the Egle that cyted almaner of Birds. Dialogo. l.


THe Egle cyted allmaner of birds and wild fowls to chapitle. And while they
were togider and correctyd offencis. Sodeynlye there came honters and
byrdetakers and stretchid owte there nettis and ordeynyd there snarys to kache of
the birds. The Egle beholdinge this and knowinge the great perell / by her
cryers cawsid opynlye to be cried that all wild fowls and birds should follow
the banere of the Egle / and that they should wait upon her and fly togider
if they desired to escape / and be owte of danger. And so they that were
obedye^t and flewe forth with the Egle escapid and were owte of parell. But
there were some that were glotonows and inobedyent / and they lokyd on the mete
and couetyd to have thereof. And so they flewe into the nettys where they were
fast masshyd and snaryd and then they cried wretchidlye and said.

He that mekelye will not obaye.
Shall perissh wyckydlye it is no nay.
Therefore the vice of inobedyence is to be eschewyd. For inobedyence cawsith
death and curse in this present life / and perpetual pain in time coming.
wherefore it was said unto Adam. Gen iii. Forasmoche as thowe have eten of the
tree of the which I commaundid the not to ete. Cursyd be the earth in thy work
/ and it shall Germyn and bear unto ye thornys and brerys. It was also said
unto king Sawle as it is written primo.xv. For becawse that thou have
castawaye the word of God and not been obedyent to his comaundment. He has
cast the away yt thou shall no longer be a king. Wherefore also Barnarde says.
The vice of inobedience is very great / for Angel lofte heuyne. Adam
paradyce. Saul his kingdom. Solomon the love of Godde / and all for
inobedience. And Valery says in his secounde book putting an example how
fadirs before time punysshed there children for not kepinge knyghtly discipline.
Aurelius cawsed his son to be punyshed among fotemen / for he kept not his
commandment / which correccyon in tho days was of the grettest humyliacion
that cowde be. It is also read in cronicis Romanorum that when Julius Caesar
had passid the space of.v. yeris in subduynge of enymyes though he had
oftyntymes been victoriows. Nevertheless the dew honowre which he was wonde
to have was denied him at his cominge home / and he was not suffirde to entyr
thecyte forsomoche as he had Tarried so long aftyr the space of.iii. yeris
which was prefixte unto him.

Of a bird Called Herodius / and of the kyte Dialogo. li.


HErodius is a dyrde of all birds flying most cruel and most rapaunte and
gretter than any bird / the which subduyth and ouercomyth the Egle as says
the gloss upon this verse of the psalter. Herodii domus etc. This Herodius
occupied the air fleing abowte. But the kyte began to whistle aftyr him and
said. Abide a while thou wicked caytif for I shall make ye ballyd / for thowe
desyrist dominacy on ouyt all birds But I shall my self avenge all birds upon
the. This Royal bird this Herodius / fleing in the air took no cure of the
lewd woordis of the kyte. But he cowde not be still / but began to rehearse the
words again. Wherefore this Herodius was greuyd and would no longer suffer him
/ but swyftely descendid down upon ye kyte and with his cleys pluckyd owte
his guttis / and kyllyd him and said.

He that will fight and strive with the strong
Perisshith many times / and sekyth his death among
Therefore we may well consider that it is no small parell to be vnrasonablye
word full again the^ that be mighty / or to vex them to much / as it is
written Ecclesia.viii. Strive thou not with a mighty man / lest that thou fall
in to the hondes of him Whereof Isope tellyth a fable that upon a time a wolf
drank of a river and a Lamb also drank of the same river lower and in an other
place. And the wolf lift up his voice and spoke to the Lamb / and said.
Thowe trowbly st my watyr. To whom the Lamb answerde and said. My Lord I do
no wrong to you. Nor trouble the watyr. The wolf said. Thretyst thowe me /
Wotyst not thou what I did to thy fadyr not yitte.viwekys paste. To whom the
Lamb spoke and said. I have not leuyd so long. Then the wolf cried loud and
said. Sayste thou so thou vyllane / and straight fell upon him and deuowrid
him. So do the mighty men of the world to them that be under / for without
occasion they deuowre them and destroy them. Therefore it is oftyn said. There
lakkyth never occasion to a lord / or to a man of great power.

Of the Crane that would fly to the son. Dialogo. lii.


I Am as fair and as great as an Egle said the proud Crane / when he see the
Egle flee to the Son / for to behold the brightness of it / Wherefore I will
fly up to the Son and behold it withowt irreuerberacyon of mine Ien / as
does the Egle. And aftirwarde I shall be magnified as she is. And when she had
exaltid her self to the sterrye she began to wax weary / and was passid her
strength and yet she came not to the Son. Nor alsoo for pride she would not
descend / but exceeding her power she labowrid up ward. Wherefore she was
gretely greuyd and not hable to gide her self / nor to fly to the Son / and
therefore she fell without remedy and said.

Who that again might upward will tend.
Again his own will shall downwarde descend
IN likewise manyon that be full of elacyon and pride coueyte and desire to be
above all other. And forasmoche as pride ever has a fall again there will they
shall be humiliate. For he that will exalte him self / shall be made low.
Luc.xiiii. Wherefore Bernarde says. He that exaltith him self as much as he
may / shall be subduyd as much as God may. And saint Augustyn says. If thou
extol and lift up thy self / God shall throw the down. If thou meke thy
self. God shall exalte the. For it is the sentence of god him self which
cannot be made more nor less. He that exaltith him self shall be lowyd. And
also Leo the Pope rehersith / Bredryn says he ye may se a great miracle. God
is most excellent and high. If thou lift up thy self he fleyth fro the. If
thowe meke thy self he descendith and comith down to the. Orosius tellith in
his fyfte book / that Valery the eight Emperowr aftir Nero for his pride and
infidelite he reysid perseeucyon in ye servants of christ / through all the
world / coveting in his corrupt mind / to destroy the faith of christ /
and to trede it underfoot. wherefore he commaundid to sle al them that named
that most gloryows name of christ. And therefore when he should fight with
Sapore king of Perce / he was overcome and takyn with all his host / and God
delyueryd him in to the hondes of Sapore / for his great pride / and he was
servant under him as long as he leuyd. And as oftyn as the said Sap^ lepte
on his horse / he trade first on the back of this Valerye as he lay prostrate
before him / and then he took his horse and rode forth.

Of a bird called sterla that took an hare. Dialogo. liii.


There is a fyrde called Sterla and is like a crane / and she has a great byll
and a perylows. This bird took an hare with her byll. Butte thowgh she were
hongrye / she would not ete this pray that she had takyn herself / but said
thus within her own mind. I will show to other dyuersse / so worthyly that I
have spedde / and so excellent a game that I have takyn that I may be
magnifyed of them that shall se it. And when she had brought it to the mustre of
birds. The grettest birds and stre^geste couetid to have it / and took it
away and left no part to her that had cawght it. Therefore Sterla contynuyd
still hungrye / with great pain and heaviness and said in this wise.

He that will booste and show that he has.
Shall have noon auantage but sometime great scath
SO manyon that be vayngloriows will show there goodis to other folks to be the
more collawdid and worshippete. But Gregory says. He desires to be robbyd
that opynlye berith his tresowre in the wayt There be also many other that
coueyte to show all there good workys to every person about them / to ye
intents that they should be knowyn. To whom saint Augustyn spekyth and says.
Hyde thy good workys as much as thou may. And if thou may not hyde them all.
Let within the be a will to hyde it if thou cowdest. And Gregory says. A good
work mote so be done opynlye / that the good intent thereof may be hid
secretly. Also it is wryttyn. He is oppressyd with the beast that he has
slain him self / that reioycith openly of the good dedis that he has done.
Isope tellyth in his fablys that upon a time the Wolf caught a kydde that was
tender and fat. The kydde spoke to the wolf and said. Be merry and joy with
great joy. that thowe haste so good a kydde in thy kepinge. But or euyr thou
ete me. I pray the to sing a merry song / and I shall dawnce while thou
syngest. And forthwith the wolf sange plesawntlye / and the kydde lepte about
and dancyd luftelye. And so by that noise all the doggis that were nyghe came
togider and made a great assawt upon the wolf / and folowid him / and
compellyd him to leave the kydde behynd him. And so the kydde fled and was
sauyd. This exemple mouyth and counsellyth every man to occupye his goods
withowte booste and in secret wise.

Of the Strucyon and the Sireurgyn. Dialogo. liiii.


STrucyo is a great bird and a strong / and largelye fedyrde / and wyngid.
And nevertheless she may not fly high for wekenesse of her wings. There was
sometime a Strucyon sufficyently fair and beawtifull the which had wings very
strong and comlye / but in tho same wings there were two fedirs contraryouslye
stondinge and lettynge her flight. Whereof she oftyn times was not merye. And
for to have remedy she went to a Sireurgyn and said. I am sufficiently
worshipful and goodely / but I have two fedirs retournyd bacwarde. I will that
thou smite them of. for they become me naught. This Sireurgyn smote of theke
two fedyrs and anointed the wings with such an ointment that all the other
feddyrs fell away. Wherefore she was impotent and might never fly aftir. This
Strucyo was sorye and made great mourninge and wept tell she dyed for sorrow
and said.

As Godde has ordeynyd us in every point.
Let us continewe and not owre self disioynte.
SO some personys that be curyows and vain. Thowghe they be made of there maker
sufficientlye and well / they Refer not to him dew honowre and thankyngis
therefore. But rather if they have any fault or spotte in there body / they
stodye and deuyse how they may amend it. Not taking such cure of the
spottys of there sowlys / how they should hele them. But as Saint Augustyn
says. The spowse that is invisible desires not the owtwarde beawte of the
body / but ye inward beawte of the soul. Therefore it is wryttyn.
Proverb.xxxi. Grace is deceyuable / and beauty is but vain / that is to say
worldely grace and beawte. Of such beawte saint Augustyn says. Behold al
thing about man / and it is beawtefull and fair / except man him self / which
is very foul. Whereof it is told that there was sometime a king that made a
great feste to his lords and estatis / and there was no cornar left in the
hows but it was coueryd with purple and with other precyows clothis. And there
was a philosofre present. And when he would have spette / and fownde no place
bare. He spette in the kyngis face. And when the kings seruauntis would have
led him to hanginge for that same deed / the king would not suffer the^ /
but asked of the philosofre why he did so. And he said. I saw every place
full of Gold and Silver / of purple also and precyows stonys / and therefore I
spet in to the kings face / which is replete with flessh and fatness for me
thought I saw not a more unclean place. And when the king hard this saying
of the philosofre / he was greatly compuncte and humiliate in him self. for
they that array them self with Gold and other ornamentis be sone rewyd of there
beawte / if they lack there garnamentis / as Isope shewith in his fablis. That
a Crow that was black and uncomely upon a time went to a wedding / but or
euyr she entyrde the brydehows / she took of every bird a feddyr / and made
her self gay / and she was very fair not be kind / but be craste. And when
she should goo in to the hows where the wedding was hold / all other birds
meruaylyd of the beawte of the crow. And at the last all the birds came to
her of whom she had stolyn the fedyrs / and every bird took his own fedir fro
the crow / and so she remaynyd black / and foul as she was wonde to do. It
happid also at pareys in a general processyon / yt an ape pluckyd from a ladys
head a browdering of othr folkys heris / which she bare before all the people.
And she apet^d foul / and without herys / like the Crow when other birds
fedirs were goon / and this fortuned be rightful judgment of God.

Of the Faulcon and the cock. Dialogo. lv.


A Knight there was sometime yt had a Royal Faulcon with the which he
greatly reioycyd / which he bare daily upon his glove / and noryssned him
delycyowslye. Upon a time this knight let fly this hawke.in to the air
coveting to reclayme him and to call him again to his hand. And when he had
been fro him a while / the knight whistlyd yt he should come again / but he
would not descend in no wise. A proud cock was there dwelling and seeing
this began to exalte him self and said. What do I that ever hiderto have leuyd
like a wretch / and seek my leuynge foul and with great labowre in the donge
and in the mire. Am not I a fair bird / and as large as a Fawlcon. Certainly
I shall fly upon the glove and be fed with the delycyows mete of my lord. And
when he was flow in upon the glove. The knight was glad for he was thowhtfull
for his faulcon / and caught the Cock and kyllyd him lyghtlye / and showed a
leg of him to the faulcon and called him therewith / to his hand. The faulcon
seeing so delicate flessh / and desyringe to have it / descendid joyfully to it
and said.

It is no wyisdom eleuacyon to make.
For him that is well / but keep the same state
TRuly every man should so do / that is to say to continewe in his degree / and
not to lift up his Ien there to that is not conuenyent to his state. Wherefore it
is written Eccle.iii. Ordeyne thou manner to thy wysdom / seek thou not tho
things that pass thy degree / no^ search thou not things that excede thy
strength far and Seneca says. Seek that that thou may find. Learn that
that thou may can. Isope tellyth that a worthy man had a little whelpe / and
a sportefull / and also he had an ass. The ass he sent to myl that he should
bear corn and do other great workys / the little whelpe playde at home with his
mastir. And sometime his mastir fed him of his own dissh. The ass seeing yt
he labowrid so sore and was weary daily / and that the whelpe was fostirde with
good mete / and with great cherissinge / he said to him self. This whelpe
does nothing / but tredith upon my mastir with his fete / and lyckyth hi^
with his tongue / and he is greatly belouid. Where for I will assay / and if I can
do so as he does. and so this ass came in suddenly before his mastir and lift
up both his forfete / and set them upon his mastirs shulders and sange in
his vncowth and strange manner. The Lord was greatly aferde of him and cried
out / and his seruauntis came anon with clubbys and stauys / and all to beat
the sely ass. And then he remembrid him / and said. It had be bettyr for me
to have left my sport / and to have been still than to do as I did. For I
have won nothing thereby sauf great strokys. Wherefore we be tawght by this
example that a man owith neuyr to attempt to do that thing / which he cannot
perform of very kind / as an autowre says. Noman assaye to do / that
kyndely may not be done / for a fool displeasith when he thinkyth to please.

Of a bird called an Astur which sent for an other bird called Caridrius.
Dialogo. lvi.


IN the air the Crane was pursewyd of a bird that is called Astur / and at
the last Astur ouyrthrewe him. But nevertheless this Crane with his long
byll smote this astur and gave him a dedly wound. astur this bird feeling him
self sore woundid / sent forth messengers and great gifts unto a bird called
Caridrius seeing. O thou leche and helper both of sowles and bodies / come to me
and hele my wounds / and I shall reward the to thy pleasure. This Caridrius
as says Papie is a bird al white of the which bowellys make fore eyne to be
hole and the propirte of this bird is that if a man shall leave / he will draw
nere to him* and if he shall dye he will fly from him. Wherefore he knew well
that this astur should dye breuely / and for that cawse he would not goo to him
but said in this wise.

Of them that shall perissh I will take no cure
But of such as shall health have / and ye is most sure
Manyon such is now a days if they were well sowght. For they be frendis in
time of prosperity and gladness / and then they vysite there frendis. But in
time of trouble and mys^rye they will not see them. and therefore says Seneca.
It is full hard to prove friends in prosperity. and it is very esy to prove
them in aduersite. and also it is written Eccles.xxxvi. There is a friend I name
oonlye. and Isidore says. Frendis there be but few that be frendlye to ye
last end. There was sometime a man that asked of his son if he had any
feythfull friend to trust to* and he answerde and said that he had.iii. especy
all friends. Then said his fader a brother and a friend is prouyd in
tribulacyon. Go therefore and prove them. and so forth he went and took an
hog and smote of his head and his fete / and put him in a sack / and sent it
to every of them three and said. Here is a man which I have slain by
mysfortune. I desire you to bery him secretly / that I be not take with the
fawte. But noon of all them three would receive hit. And for this cawse his
fader counsellyd him to assaye his friends. And also he told him a nothir
example of two lovers that were felowys. Of which the oon granted the other a
wife / which he had fervently louyd. And immediatlye he that had grauntyd this
grant went ouyr the sea to vysite his friends. And lost all his gooddes in
the sea. And when he was retournyd again / he durst not for shame show him
self / nor go^ to his fellow / but fell in desperacyon. And as it fortuned that
same time / there was a man slain. And wha^ his body was fownde there was great
inquysicion made for him that slew the man. And so this man that was
desperate confessyd that he had slain the man / which he never did. But for
becawse that he would feign have dyed for thought and confusyon And when his
fellow knew him be a sertayne tokyn. He said that he had kyllyd the man to
deliver his feloowe fro death A^ last he that was the very homycyde / seeing
all this disclosyd him self and shewid that he verylye did the deed / and that
the other twayn were nothing gyltye. Valery tellyth also libro quarto capite
septimo. Of great love and kyndenesse that was between two frendys. And of them
oone was called Damon / and the other was named Phitia. And when the Tyraunte
Dyoni se would have destroyde oon of them. He asked license that he might goo
home to his own hows / and dispose his goods / and the other undertook upon
iubardye of life that he should come again at a day assygned. And when the
day drew nere / and he was not herd of. Every man blamyd the other and said
that he was to hastye for to be his suretye / but he said plainly he dowbtyd
not the constaunce and stablenesse of his friend. And so in the same hour that
was assygnyd him he came and faylyd not. Whereof the Tyrant meruaylyd greatly
/ and of the sure minds of them / and of yt faithful frendeshippe / and
forgave his malice and remyttyd the pain / and prayde them to receive him in
to the third degree of love / and good frendshippe. If oon man will do somoche
for an other that is but mortal What owith he to do / for God yt is immortal
/ which suffirde him self to dye for the love of man. As hit is wryttyn
Ecclesiasti.xix. Forgete thou not the grace of thy surytye and helper / for he
gave his life for love of the etcetera.

Of tway hawks and a Quayle. Dialogo. lvii.


AN hawke called Osmerillus / and a Goshawke were confederate togider to goo an
hawkinge. And what game that ever they took / it should be deuydid between
them. It fortuned upon a time / that they twayn togider took a Quayle / being
from her neste. A Quayle is a bird that has her name of Qualis, or else of
the noise that she makyth. For she cries / quaquera / quaquera / and when
these tway hawks had this quayle / they said to her. Chese the whethir the is
lever that we shall ete the allone. Qrellys if thou will led us to thineste /
that we shall ete the and thy children togider. To whom the Quayle said
Angwyssh and trowble is to me on every side / and what is best I wot not. But
less hurt me thinkith for me to dye / and to fall in to yowre hondes / my
self alone / the^ for to be kyllyd my self and all my children with me. And so
they caught her / but or euyr they killed her she spoke and said.

Less hurt it is to him ye may none otherwise chese.
Him self alone to suffer / then many moo to lose
IN likewise by example of the Quayle we owe to do / when we may not escape
from perell.

Ever let us chese that / the which shall lest hurt / aftir counsel of
the wiseman / yt says. Of tway harmys / the less is to be suffirde. We be
bownde to chese rather for to dye / for a comune profit / then for to live for
a syngler avail / as saint Augustine wrytethde Ciuitate Dei libro primo. Where
he shewith / that when Marc^s regulus was take and imprysonyd of them of
cartage / and ye Romaynys had many of them of cartage in prison / which were
yongmen and lustye. The forsayde regulus was sent home to Rome for an
exchange. But or euyr he departed fro the Cartagenensis he was sworn that if
the Romans would not deliver the prisoners of cartage / he should come
again. And when he came to Rome he counseylyd the Romans not to be greable
to their petycyon / forasmoch as he was an old man and be lykelyhode should
live but a while. And there prisoners were yongmen / and lykely to do great
myscheef to the Romans in time coming. And they prayde him to go no more to
cartage / but to abide still with them at Rome. But in no wise he would not be
greable / but forth he went to cartage. And when he came thedir / he was
cruelly put to death / It had been profitable to him to have bydde still at Rome
/ but for his oath it had not been honest. And for the profyt of the Romans
it had not been vayleable nor profitable.

Of a bird called Carflanchus that would go to Relygyon. Dialogo. lviii.
CArflanchus is a bird like to a fawlcon strong and mighty. This bird in
his yowth was disposyd to go to Relygyon and to live in perfeccyon. But for
dread of sharpness of the Rule / he differde it and said. I trow verylye
and I believe / that I may not fast. Nor rise to Mateynes. Nor keep chastyte.
Nor forsake mine own will. And for this cawse that he would begin no good deed
For dread of penance / he came neuir to the mids / but rather endid his life
full lewdely saying in this wise.

He that for dread no vertewe will use
Shall perysshe dowghtlesse / and grace him refuse.
SO many one coueyte and desire to fly to the grace of God. But they fere to
lack the pleasure of ye world. For certainly the love of Christ prouokyth and
steryth them to vertewe. But couetyse and worldly affection drawith them
again. And of such many be wonde oftyn times to say. I would serve God
gladly I would gladlye go in to relygion. But I dread I should not be able to
maynteyne the sharpness thereof. Such folkys take noon head to the saying of
the apostle / ad Philip.iiii. I may do all thing in him that confortithe me /
that is to say in Christ. and barnarde says. God is to them that trust in
him. Richesse in pouertye. Solace in sadness / joy in ambycyon / worship in
contempt, a shadow in diffence / from beat and from rain. a teller of Fablys
says that on a time. The sawcon took a kyte / and threw him under his fete /
and with one of his fete smote him and said. Thou art unhappy. for thou art
as great as I and as strong. and why defendist not thou thy self fro me that
trede on the and will ryppe owte thy bowellys. The kyte answerde and said.
Thou say soth. I am gretter and strenger the^ thou / and I have a perylous
byll / and my fete be strenger then thine / but my heart lackyth / and so it
farithe be manyon / that may do many good things / but the heart faylith. and
steadfast mind is a way. There was oon fell in to a watyr and cowde not swym.
wherefore he cried owte. Saint George help me. Saint George came to him and
said. Thowe slowfull man help thy self / move thy hondes and thy feet / and
thou shall be sauyd. For he that will help him self. Is holpyn of God. So
should he do that is fallyn in to sin. For he should not ask forgiveness
of God oonly with his mowth. but labowre and do his vttyr diligence to rise
owte of sin. Saint augustyn tellyth in Epistle to Jerome. That when a
sertayne person upon a time / was fall in to ^^ pytte / and an other came bye
/ and asked how he fell inn / he said. I pray the inquyre not how I fell
inn / but assaye rather be what meanys thou canste help to get me owte.

Of the lapwynge and the Popyniaye. dial. lix.
VPupa is a bird as says Isidore.xii. Ethimol. and in englyssh it is called a
laywynge. Grekys call her Vpupa / for cause yt she oftyn beholdith and
considerith ye filthy donge of man. and she is fed wit^ stinking donge and she
is an unclean bird. She has three Crestis of feddirs stondinge on her heed /
and she bydeth much in pittis and there as is donge and fylth. With the blood
of the which bird if a man anoynte him self when he goyth to sleep / he shall
se fendes about to destroy him The bird for cawse that she is fair and
plesauntely Crestyd and fedryd with diverse colowres / she began to lift up her
self beholdynge the Popyniaye dwelling with the king in a Cage of gold / the
which was fed clenlye of the kings mete / and thus she said. I am as
plesaunte as a popyniaye. Neuyrthelesse I seek my living with great labowre.
This popyniaye dwellyth worshipfullye and he labowrith not / nor swetith / and
he is served to his pleasure. Wherefore I purpose to go to the king and to
profre him my seruyse / and to sing in a cage as does the popyniaye / and to
fare well if I may / and to make merry with the king. And so she flewe to the
king. And when he had her / he put her in to a cage / and kept her there.
and when she had been there a while / she took great thought and was very sorry
that she was in captivity and danger that sometime was fre and at lybertye. and
therefore for thowght and heaviness / she leuyd but a while. and said or she
departed fro the world.

To Fredom and lybertye comparison to make.
There is noon trwlye / all other thing to take.
SO manyon speak of Relygyows men and say. These bredryn be well possessyd.
They be well Fed. They sing and live withowte great labowr but when they
will prove it / and be includid in a monastery and be under Rule and vndyr the
power of there sovereign / they repent that they have lost there lybertye / as
a Philosofre says. Liberty is not gladlye sold Of this world for all the
gold. Valery tellyth lib.vi. That lenonydes the Noble duke of spartaynes /
with CCC. men faught again xerxem king of Perce. And with a Comfortable
there he exhortyd his men to fight and said / My true seruauntis and
sowdyowrs / dyne and make you strong / as though ye shall never ete more. And
they did so / and were nothing aferde of his saying. And when there was no
hope to escape / he hartyd them so that they were glad to suffer death /
rather then to lose there lybertye / and to be seruauntis unto the percys. Also
Orosius tellyth libro vi. That Demetrius king of Ponte and Armenye / when his
own sone besegid him / and would not cese / he was sorye therefore and came
down to the lower partys of his hows / and gave venyme to drink to all his
wifis / his dowghters / and his concubynes / and he him self drank of the same
for thought and desperacyon / and for all that when he saw that he cowde not
dye lyghtlye. He offrid him self to be slain to oon of his enymys that entirde
be a wall. Rather then he would be subdued to his enymyes / and lose his
lyberte and fre will. Also Orosius tellyth that some men were besegid by the
Romaynys and be scypyon of Affrike / and considered well that and if they were
take / they might not resist the Romans. For cawse the said Romans should
not rejoice of there goods. They made fast the gatys of there cite / and
brynnyd them self / there Cite / and all there goods / rather then they would
yield them self / to their enymyes. It is red also in Ecclesiastical history
that in the time of Abrahe. A king of Babylon callid Belus entirde in a part
of Syrye / and dyed breuely aftir. But his wife that was called semyramys was
ambycyows to be Queen / and to the Intent yt she might regne she weddid her
own son / that was named Nynus. The which aftyrwarde took also Syrye / and
made a great city of three days journey / to goo or to ride and aftyr his
name that was Nynys / he called the cite Nynyue. And he had a child by his
own modyr. And the name of him was Babylio / and he enlargyd the cite of
Babylon.

Of the Hen / and the Culuyr. Dialogo. lx.
AN Hen and a Culuyr made there nestys togider / and dwelled both in on hows.
but oftyntymes they were at great strife / for cawse that oon sange tomoche /
and the other cried tomoche. The Hen many times saw the Culuirs children
hangid / and she made merye and sange / wherefore the Culuyr was sore greuyd and
said to the Hen. Thowe Hen thowe mowrnist not with me / when thou seyst my
Children destroyed. The Hen answerde and said. Thou will not sing with me /
when I bring forth an Egg out of my bowellys / and am delyueryd from great
parell. And thus they fell at great varyaunce and spoke unkind woordis / each
to other. And at the last they togider went to the Egle and said. Give
judgment between us O rightful Queen we beseech the / if it be co^uenyent for
us twain to dwell togider or not. The egle gave sentence in opyn audyence and
said.

Let them that be glad have their dwelling alone
And they that be sad togider make there moan.
FOr it is not convenient for them that be merye and iocounde / to walk with
them that be in heaviness. Nor for such as be sad and sorye to dwell with them
that be joyful and merye. but as the apostle says ad Romano.xii. Joy ye
with men ioyjnge / and weep ye with men weeping. But noot this well yt great
gladness sometime may cawse sudden death. For therewith the heart waxith great
/ and the natural hete goith to the extery or partis / and then the heart
faylyth and death entryth. Whereof Valery tellyth / yt on a time there was
tydyngis browght to a woman ye her son was deed / when he was absente / and
it was not so / but it sprange of errowre of some simple person Nevertheless
she believed hit and mournyd and made great heaviness. and as she sat weeping
and sorowi^g Suddenly in came her son / and when she saw him she ran to
him and kyste him / and sodeynlye feldoun deed. Tristice and heaviness sleyth not
so soon. For in heaviness the natural hete Is drawyn first to the inward
parties / and such steringe of the hete geuy the nourrisshinge in the membris
/ and so cawsith consumpcion in them / and so by process of time folowithe
Etica / as it is written Prouerbio.xv. An heavy spirit dries up the bonys /
Wherefore it may be prouyd that worldly joy is like pure wine / which sone
turnith / and so does it / but if it be moderate with wholesome sadness / as it
is written Ecclesiast.vii. Bettyr it is to goo to an hows of wepinge and
sadness / then to an hows of festis and mirth. Tully tellythe that when any
consul of Rome had been at batell and won the victory and was come home. He
should have three diverse worshippes / done to him. First all the people should
come again him with great gladness. The secownde all ye prisoners that he
had takyn should follow his chare with there hondes fast manaclyd. The thryd was
that the same victowr was indute with the cotearmure of iouis and sat in a
chare and was conveyed with.iiii. white stedys / unto the capitoly. And for
that he should not to much exalte him self / above him self. They mytygate
this honowre in the threfolde wise. For first a man of seruyle condicyon /
should sit with him in the chare / that hope should be geuyn to every person /
to come to such worship / if his manhood deseruyd it. The secounde ye same
servant syttinge with him should Bobbe him and say to him. Know thy self.
The thryd it was laufull to every man that same day / to bring again him all
the rebukys that they would. Therefore if paynymes and hethen men thus wisely
cowde myxte there vain gladness. Much more we that be Christian men / owe to
repress such vanyteys. For as saint Gregory says Perpetual lamentacyon and
heaviness follow ye joys of the world / to such as love them in especyall.
And saint Augustyn says. The gladness of the world is vanyte. with long
abiding it is trustyd to come / and when it is come / it may not long endure.

Of the Cock and the Capon. Dialogo. lxi.


IN a courtelage the Cock and the Capon dwelled togider. but the Cock had
dominacyon ouyr the Hennys. The Capon full mekely ete her mete among them. And
as hit vnfortunably happyd the Fox came and caught the Cock and ete him / but
he towchid not the Comb of his head. but kept it hoole / and led it to the
Capon and said. O brodir Capon / thy follow is departed from the world and
for the great love that I owe unto the I have brought to the a goodly Comb /
which he bare continually upon his head. Therefore descend and come down to me
/ and I shall crown the / and aftyr that thou shall be prince and regent of the
Hennys as he was. The Capon heringe this / and hopinge to have Rule over the
hennys. Came down from the Rowste and went to the Fox. The Fox was glad and
sterte / and caught the Capon lyghtlye and kyllyd him and said

To every word no credence thou give.
beware of false men that the would my scheue.
OF such owre sauyowre commaundith us to beware saying. Mat.vii. be ye ware of
such / as come to you in the clothinge of sheep. For they be inwardely like
cruel wolkys. As Isope tellyth of a crow / yt had a piece of flessh in his
mowth / and stood upon a tree And when the Fox had espied him / she thowght in
her mind. O if I might begile this crow and have ye flessh that he holdith in
his mowth / I might be merye And therefore she spoke and said. brodir Crow
behold what I say. Thy beawtye passyth the beawtye of all birds / and thy
strength excedith the strength of all other birds. but I am sorye that thou
have no voice. Nor coming to sing. and even forthwith the Crow began to
sing / and the flessh fellowte of his mowth. Which the fox cawght and ete /
and went his way. So oftyntymes it happith to a man when he herythe him self
preysid and comendid. Wherefore it is written Jeremy.ix. Every man keep him
from his neybowre yt is full of adulacyon. And put not to much trust in his
own brodyr. and Caton says. believe thowe not an other man of thy self / more
then thy self.

Of the Fesawnte and the Pecocke. Dialogo. lxii.


ELeccyon made the birds in a dyuysyon / and they chose the fesaunte and the
Pecocke. And they twayn for ye Eleccyon fell at great words / and spente
great goods. Therefore the birds went togider to the Egle and said. We have
made Eleccyon. But thou like a judge give confirmacyon that owre electis may be
comprobate. The Egle cyted the electis willing to examyn the Eleccyon. But the
Fesaunte which is a bird that came first owte of Greek / and his flessh is
very sweet to ete / magnyfyed him self greatly saying. O rightfulliuge as thou
knowist well. I am very delicate. Fair alsoo / and dyuersly colowrid. My
flessh is redolent and sweet / above all other. Wherefore the principalyte
becomyth me best. The Pecocke defendid him self to his uttermost power and
said. Madame and it please your grace it is not so / as the Fesawnte has
said. For I my self am fayrer than he / and gretter / and crestid. And alsoo my
tail yeldith to me the souerayn worship. And with these words he left up
his Tail / and spredde it a brood / and reioycyd greatly there in. The Egle
discretely consyderinge all this said first to the Pecocke. Thou Pecocke thou
have greatly rebukyd thiself / in lyftynge up of thitayle. For thowe have
showed us a pair of foul fete. Therefore thou art not worthy to be a ruler.
At last she spoke also to the Fesawnte / and said. Thou have rinnynge Ien /
and thou art but weke / and thou canste not sing. And therefore for the
impedimentis that thou have / and other cawsis lefull I depryue the from
worship. And so they both were put from promocyon and contynuyd withowte
worship duringe both there lyuys and said.

He is not worthy gydinge to take.
That of each word great quarrel will make.
THis vice regnith of tyntymes in them that be elect. For be questyoni^g of
the Eleccyon many mennys fawtis be rekenyd up. Wherefore they be diverse times
rebuked and diffamyd. Wherefore it is not good to strive for preeminence of
worship. For Gregory says Desire of prelacye is gendrid of pride / of the
heart / and whosoeuyr desire soueraynte in earth shall find confusyon in heuyn.
This desire to have governance / is perilowse / and to be eschewyd to owre
powers. For as gregory says. The higher the ruler is in worship / the more is
he in perell. Wherefore princes in the old time would not suffer there children
to be preferryd withowt they might profit / as tellyth Helmandus
historiographus of helio adriano. Than when he was from a senator create an
Emperowre / and the Senate desirid him to name his son that same time
Augustum Cesarem. He answerde them and said. Truly it owith to suffice that I
vnwilfully regne when I have not deseruyd it. For Pryncehode and rule longith
not unto blood. but unto good merytes and good gydinge. And oftyntymes / He
is not profitable unto the Reame / that is born a king. For withowte dowbte he
cannot love his friends / that destroys his children with importable charge.
This is to say to destroy his children / when he promotyth them not for there
merytes. They owe to be norisshed and excercised in vertewe / and when they
have continuyd in them it should be prouyd that they shul be goo before in
vertewys / that should be first preferrid to worship. And so they actually
fulfyllyd that is commaundid Eccles.vii. Intend thou not to labowr to be a
judge. But if thou may be thy vertewe destroy sin and wickedness. Whereof it
is written in Policraticon li.vj. That Octauyan when his children were worthy
to be promotyd to great worship. He would not promote them / but if they
might be their vertewe and strength defend them self and other also
sufficientlye. Wherefore he commaundid that they should be excercysed to
Runnynge to lepynge to swymmynge / to throw stonys with the hand / or with a
slynge / and in such other faculteys as longith to knyghthode or service. And
his daughters he ordeynyd to be clothiers. That and if fortune had driven them
to the extremyte of pouertye / they should have their sustentacyon and leuynge
/ by reason of there conynge / for of spynnynge and we bynge and of cloth
making / they had not oonely conynge but also daily exercise. And it is
commawndid Eccle.vii. If thou have men children. Teache the^ / or cawse them to
be tawghte. And it folowith in the same place. And if thou have dowghters keep
the bodies of them from corrupcyon and sin etc.

Of the Rauyn and a bird called ficedula. Dialogo. lxiii.
COrnix in owr tongue is called a rauyn and it is a bird that leuyth unto the
age of a. M. yeris as Papye wrytteth This bird upon a time labowrid sore and
made her neste. Wherefore her feddyrs fell away / and she was lene / but
notwithstondi^g she nourisshed her eggis and brought them forth. That self time
Ficedula which in lateyn is also called papafigo / went unto her and rebukyd
her greatly and would not suffer her be in peace. Cornix for love of her Eggs
took pacyentlye all thing. But notwithstondinge her mind was sore vexyd / but
she kept it close with in her self. Aftyrwarde when her children were brought
forth this cornix began to amend / and newlye repayryd her self. But the
forsayde bird ficedula came again and rehersyd contumelyows words / and
began to despise her as she had done before. wherefore she was greuouslye mouyd
/ and in will to be auengid / and in that great Ire she caught this bird and
kyllyd it and said.

who that will oftyn varye and make fraye.
Sekith his own death in soth it is no Nay.
When manyon seyth an other depressyd or in disease / he is glad to rebuke him
/ and to do him wrong. But when thou seyst a man in myschefe thou shuldist
not rebuke hi^. for ye philosofre says. to be rebukyd in wretchidnesse is more
grievous tha^ yt wretch dnesse / it is great wrong not to be co^passionable to
the^ that be in trowble. Princes and lordis in the old time were pitefull and
compassionable to wretchis and to diseasid folk in there mysery. Whereof Valery
tellyth lib.v. that when Caesar lokyd upon the head of Pompey that was smytte
of. He wept sore / and let fall many Terys of great piete. Also he tellyth
there / that wha^ Marcus Marcellus had takyn the Siracusanys / and was in a
tower of that rich cite / and when he remembrid and inwardlye beheld the my
fortune and afflyccyon of the same noble cite. He cowde not restrain hi^ from
weping. He tellyth also there / of the buxomnes of Pompey showed to the king of
Armenye / which again the Romans oftyntymes had made great war But that
notwithstondinge when he was takyn and ouircome / he would not suffer long to
knele before him but confortyd him with curteys words / and commandyd the
crown to be set upon his head / that he hi^ self had laid away / and
restorid him unto his first degree and worship. and said it was as great a
deed to restore a king to his worship. As to subdue him / and put him from
his worship. And a like tale he tellith of a counsel that was named pawle /
which upon a time when a king was takyn / and should be browght before him.
He went to mete him / and when he would have knelyd for mercy. This noble
counsull would not suffer him / but took him up / and set him on his right
side / and cheryd him with great comfort / and ordeynid him next to him self
in counsellys and at his Table. For although that it be lawdable to have
victory / and ouirthrowe enymyes. It is as great honowr to be merciful to
them that be in heaviness.

Of the Nightcrowe / and the lark Dialogo. lxiiii.


NIcticorax is a nyghtcrowe in English / and it is deryuyd of Nictos that is
night / and Corax which is a Crow / as who says a nyghtcrowe / for she
flies in the night. Or for that she wakyth all the night. Isidore
Ethimol.xii. Nicticorax she is Noctua the owl that louyth darkness. The lark
went to this bird and said. Most dear sustre heartily I pray the to be with
me to morrow / for a lover of mine desyrithe to see me in the clear day light.
And if we twain be togider / I shall seem the fayrer. The nighecrowe promised
to fulfill her desire / for she was ashamyd to say nay in such a small
matere. And when the day aperyd and phoebus shoone plesauntlye and clear. The
lark lokyd for her to fulfill her promys. But she came not. For she durst not
be showed in the bright son / and also she might nothing see in the day
light. wherefore the Lark was sorye and greatly trowblyd and abhorryd her and
pursuyd her eueraftir and unto this day. And therefore ye Owl dare not fly in
the day time for fere of the lark / and so she fleyth all in the night / and
sekythe her mete with great penurite and hongre saying in this wise.

Noman should for love nor for doubt.
Promise that thing that he cannot bring abowte.
Therefore we owe to be ware to make promys of thing impossible to be
perfourmyd / that we be not prouyd untrue. If it fortuned the to be desired of
thy friend to do such thing as plesith ye not. be not ashamyd to say nay /
rather then to promise and perform it not. For the philosofre says. beware
that shamefastnes of denyinge / Cawse not to thy self necessite of lyinge. For
he is not deceived that is lightly denied. Nevertheless manyon for liberalyte
and fre heart be shamefaste to say nay of things desired of them As it is
written in gestis Romanorum of the lyberalyte of Tyte the Emperowre. For he
ordeynyd that noman should ask of him withowt hope of having or he let them
go. And his friends asked of him why he gra^tyd more then he might give. And he
answerde and said that for cause no man should depart heuyly yt had spok with
him. also it is red in gestis Romanorum of Traiane / that when his frendis
rebukyd him that he was famylyer with every man / more tha^ they thought was
convenient to his dignite / that is to say in condesce^ding to their petycions.
This Traiane answerde and said that he would be to Every Creature as gracyows
and Curteys as they cowde think or desire to have him / and so he continuyd
eueraftyr

Of the wagtayle and the Fesaunte. Dialogo. lxv.


A wagtayle does continually wag her tail in ded / and therefore she is so named
Upon a time she went to ye Fesaunt and said. Thou wretch why wypest not thou
thyn Ien. They be ever full of watyr / and ye stenche of the^ causithe yt to be
abominable to al men. The Fesaunt was wroth and answered and said / art not
thou ashamyd mad wrech yt art so vile and so little / and thou have a wagging
tail full of palsye / and thou art besy to note my vicis. but go forth and
amend thyn own fautes first and then thou shall be hoole. The wagtayle heringe
this / was sore ashamyd / and with confusyon turnyd home again and said.

First pourge thy self from all manner of Sin
Or thou again other any judgment begin
SO in like somefolke took noon head to there own fawtes. But they be ready to
rebuke other folks / and forgete them self. To such owr sauyowre spekyth
Luce.vi. and Mat.vii. Why can thou espy a little mote in thyn neybowris Ie /
and considerist not a great beam in thyn own. Or how may thowe for shame
say to thy brodir suffir me to take the mote out of thyn Ie / not seeing so
great a beam in thyn own Ie. Thou Ipocryte first take the great beam fro
thyn own Ie / and thou may the bettyr then help thy brodirs Ie. It is read
in vitis patrum that a Relygyows man / spoke and blamyd on of his bredren and
detractyd him before the couente. The abotte of the same place was agyd / and
said no word. And upon a time when he bare behind him a sack full of
gravel / and had laid a little of the same gravel before him / oon asked of
him what he bare / and he said / a sack full of gravel / which betokened his
own sins. But he said while they were behind him he carid not for the^.
But the small hand full of gravel that lay before him / he said theke were
his brodirs sins which he had detractyd. And moreover he addid these words
and said. bredren it should not be so. but mine own sins owyth euyr to be in
my mind. And I am bownde to think upon them / and so is every creature. And
his bredren said. Truly this is the way of life and health everlasting.

Of the Nyghtyngale and ye crow emonge other birds. Dialogo. lxvi.


Upon an high solemn day. The Egle had boode all other birds to dinner /
and when they had dynyd and faryd ryally / the Egle called the Nyghtyngale to
her and said. Daughter goo and break thy voice / and sing as thou art lernyd
and show thy conning to chere owre hartys. The nyghtingale was obediente and
glad to please / and began to sing so plesauntly that almaner of birds
desirouslye lyftened to her song. Among al other a crow came bye and
consyderinge that he said to him self. I will also sing with the Nyghtyngale.
For I have a great voice / and I shall be hard far. And he began to Croke
in a full foul manner. The Nyghtingale was still and might sing no longer ye
crow made so foul a noise. And all the other Birds were sore trowblyd and
abhorryd the Crow / for he despisid the feste. Therefore the Egle commaundid
him to goo his way / or to be still. The crow answered and said that he would
solempnyse the feste with other birds / and he intendid not to remeue from his
place for her words. The secounde time the Egle chargid him to depart / for
noman reioycyd to here him. But the crow would not be still / but began to
garre and coye more and more. Wherefore the Egle commawndid him to be killed
without longer respite and said in this wise.

Song or other conning be it never so dear.
Is showed but in vain to the^ that lift not here.
SO it is but folly to speak where the herers be dull to take heed. Therefore it
is said Ecclesi.xxxiii. Show not thy Sermon there as is noone audyence. And
farthermore he says. In compeny of great men presume not to speak. And there
as be senyowrs speak not tomoche / like as the crow sange but lewdlye. So a
legate of athenys answerde symplye before king philyppe. Of whom Seneca tellyth
/ libro tercyo de Ira. Where he shewith that when the legatis of athenensis
were come before king Philippe / and there legacye hard. The king curteyslye
answerde and said. Look what ye think I may do to the pleasure of the
athenensis / and ye shall find me reasonable. To whom oon of the same legatis
Named Democritus answerde saying to the king. To hang thy self. And when they
that stood about were indignate and would have been auengid. The king
commaundid to let him go / unpunished / and said to the other legatis. Show
you unto the Athenensis that they be much more proud that speak such
words / then they that pacyently here them / when they be vnpacyently spokyn.

Of a bird called Ciconia / and the swalowe. Dialogo. lxvii.


CIconya upon a time made her neste in an high tower withowte in ye top /
and the swalowe byldyd within. But the swalowe made great noise oftyn times
and reioycyd of brynging forth of her birds. Wherewith this Ciconia was greatly
trowblyd. For when she would have takyn rest with her children / she might not
for the chatheringe of the swalowe. Therefore in the absence of the swalowe
Ciconya destroyed her neste / and killyd her birds. And when the swalowe was
come home again to her neste. She made right doulfoll sorrow for her children.
But forasmoch as she knew not who did it / she auengid not the deed. Within a
while after ye swalowe repayrid her self again / and made a new neste and
brought forth her birds and was greatly glad of them / and chyrkyd fast and
made much noise. Wherefore Cyconia was greuid greatelye as before time / and
spoke loud / and said. Certaynlye but if thowe be still. I shall throw down
thy birds with thy neste as I did oonnys / for cawse that thou inquyetest me
and makyth such noise that I can have no rest with my children. This heringe
the swalowe and knowing / verily that Cyconya had mourdird her children / with
all her hole mind she bethought her how to be avenged. And therefore upon a
time when Ciconia was slepinge with her children / the swalowe came pryuelye
and set fire in her neste / and brynnyd her with all her children and said.

He that on his Enymyes seyth his quarrel bewroke
Of much thowght and heaviness his heart is vnloke.
By this exemple it aperith that hit is not good to vex or to wrong them
that be under / for doubt that they will be avenged / other openly or
pryuelye. For oftyntymes hit fortunith that a man receives of other as he had
deseruyd before time him self. For seneca says. Look thou have of an other as
thou have done to other. And the Apostle powle says / ad co locensis.iii. He
that does iniurye and wrong / shall have his reward aftyr his deserving. As
Isope tellyth yt the Egle flewe in to an high hill / and fownde the foxys
children there / which she took owte of there den and carried them with her to
her neste / that she and her birds should have ete them to there sowper. And
when ye Fox was come home to his loggynge et found not his children he went
down to the wood and cried for them and at the last he hard them weep and
mourn in the Eglis neste. The Fox spoke to the Egle many sweet woordis and
with great reverence prayde her to deliver the children. But utterly the Egle
would not grant nor give audyence to her peticion. Wherefore the Fox was angry
and impacyent and went and gadrid styekys bowys and branches of vynes that
were seere and dry and brought a bronde in her mowth / and made so great
smoke under the tree that she kyllyd the Eglys birds. And when the Egle
considerid al thing she was feign to meke her self and came down and delyueryd
ye whelps by compulsion. Of tway harmys chesyng the less. By this a man is
tawghte / that thowgh he be at advantage and above / let him dowte to offend
him yt is under / and ever of tway harmys chease the least harm. Whereof a
sertayne auctour says. Noman owith to stodye to hurt him that is weke and
pouer. For he that is both weke and pouer may sometime hurt him that is above
him.

Of a bird called a Pygarde and a great bird called Alietus. Dialo. lxviii.


PIgardue is a bird as wrytteth vgncyo / and but a little bird nombrid emonge
them that be comestible and hable to mannys sustinaunce / as hit is written
Deuteronomii.xiiii. And upon a time when this little bird was sore pursewyd
in the air by an other Rauenows bird and stood in great iudardye of her
life. To have proteccyon and to be defendid she fled unto the aliete and
said. Thou art great mighty also and merciful. Therefore I come unto the that
am but little and impotent and know no refuge / and in me is no resistance. Be
thou my proteccyon I beseech the / and defend me fro my cruel enymye under
the couerte of thy merciful wings. This Alietus which as Papye says / is a
bird like unto an Egle but larger was mouyd with piete and answerde to this
little byrd and said. Forasmoche as thou art a little bird and humble / weke
and impotent / and desire socowr of me. Sit down and rest the with me and
walk with me when I walk and dread thou nothing. And thus he sauyd the
little bird and comfortyd him and said.

Meekness and pouerte should ever be defendid
and there as it is contrary Godmay soon amend it.
IN this example it aperith that they that be impotente should be defendid and
holpyn in there need of them that be mighty. For yt is great meke nesse and
mercy. For meekness and mercy as Bernard says is prouyd the gretter when it
is showed in them yt be great / and in them that be clear it is the more
clear. and Seneca also says. He that may socowre to him yt should perissh and
soco^rith not he steyth him. In ^he old time princys were mouyd with pity
and beniu^lence to such as were under them / as it aperith euydently in there
gestis. Whereof Helmandus tellyth in gestys Romanorum of Traiane that upon a
time when he should take his horse toward batell in great haste / there came a
widow to him with great lamentacyon and said Ibeseche the to avenge the
blood of mine innocent child which lately was slain. To whom Traiane said If
I come again with victory and health I shall auengethe. and the widow said.
Who shall do equity to me if thou be slain in this batell. Traiane answerde
he that shall succeed me in the Empire. To whom the wedowe said. and what shall
that avail the if an other man do rightwysnes to me. Traiane said. Certainly
nothing. To whom the widow answerde / and said. Is it not bettyr that thowe
thy self do right to me / and so to encrece thyn own merytes / than to leave it
to an other man. Then traiane was mouyd with pity and descendid from his horse
and auengid her cawse and set her heart at rest. also upon an other time /
when oon of ye sonnys of traiane rode throw ye cite very wa^tonly / he kyllyd
a widows son with his horse. and wha^ ye wydowe had showed it to his fader
with great lacrymacyon and mourninge he gave his own son to the same wydowe
forever / with great abundance of other richesse.

Of a bird called Onocrotalus and the ass. Dialogo. lxix.


There is a bird as Brito says / the which is called Onocrotalus or
Onocrotalon / and his comyth of Onos that is an ass. For she has a face like
an ass / and her body is like a swan. This bird made her neste in a great
wilderness and laid her eggis and brought forth her birds. but when she
cowde no longer find sustynaunce in the deserte to her and her children / she
went to the cite / and called the ass to her frendlye and said. O brodyr I am
like to the as thou well seyst / for I have an Assis face as thou have.
Therefore thou should trust me bettyr than an other. I pray the come with me
and dowte not The Ass was innocente and credidle seeing his own similitude /
and symply went with her. and Onocrotalus led the ass forth right to the
markette / and there boughte diverse metys and bestowyd much money and lodid the
ass sufficyently and said. Go with me brodir and let us carey this vytayle to
owre children and I shall reward the to thy pleasure. The Ass went with this
Onocrotalon through the deserte a great while but at the last with great
labowre he came to the neste and laid down his burdon and took his reward and
turnyd him homewarde. But for cawse that he was in deserte and in a foul myrye
contray and knew not the perfect way / He cowde not goo home / and so he
perisshed even there in the wilderness and said.

Noman to go far owith to be feign
But he be assuryd how to come again.
Whereby it aperith that noman should goo to far contrays that he knowith not
for diverse parellys that daily hap throw the world. For it is written primo
Iohannis secundo. All the world is set in great myschefe. As who says.
Whersoeuer a man be he is ever in great parell. And therefore the apostle
complaynyth secunda ad Corinthios.xi. of diverse parellys in land in water /
and especyally in false Christian people. Therefore as Gregory says. We must
euyr dread / for we be ever in parell / as hit is read in collacyonidus
patrum. That on a time there was a solytary man leuyd in the most perfight wise
and served God / and the find daily waytyd to bring him to perdicion by
great sotylte. wherefore on a time he transfigured him self in to the likeness
of a marchantes horse / having bags on his bakke full of Gold and silver and
precious stonys / and he entyrde suddenly in to the cell of this holy man and
stood there. And he seeing the horse meruay led greatly what it should mean. and
when he saw noman pursuynge aftyr the horse / he began to towche him and to
undo the baggis. In the which he fownde great haboundance of goods temperall
/ and money innumerable. And so he was overcome with temptacyon and clothyd
him self in the most fressh wise / and took the horse and roode to a great
cite with all that good and took up an hostage and ete and drank of the best.
And when the goodeman that hostyd him / saw and consyderyd his great richesse
/ he gave him his dowghter to wife / and he dwelled still in that same hows.
The devil came within a short space aftir and aperyd to the goodeman of the
same hows in likeness of a man / and said. What have thowe done. To whom have
thou geuyn thy daughter. He is a Clerk and Apostata and by the law she may
not be his wife. And when this man hard this he was sad for his dowghter and
serchid his head and fownd that it was so / and pryuelye kyllyd him / and when
he would have undone the sack / he fownde nothing save water and donge.
Therefore it is said. Ecclesiast.ix. A man knowith not his end. Butte as a
Fisshe is takyn with an hook and a bird with a snare so is a sinful man
takyn in his sin / and in many parellys. In the great see of marcyle
scantlye oon escapith of many / and of the^ that pass throwgh the parellys of
this world few escape. Whereof it is written in vitispatrum. The abbot
Theodorus gave an answer to a monk that said to him a brodir of owris is
retournyd to the world marvel thou not thereof. But and if thowe may here
and understand that any man has preuaylyd and escapyd fro the hondes of his
goostlye enymys / thereof thou may well maruayle and thank God.

Of the Swan and the crow. Dialogo. lxx.


CIgnus a swan is a bird all white. And Coruus a crow is all black. And he
therefore enuyed the swan / for his whytenesse and clennesse. Therefore the crow
with great stodye and besy labowre sought the meanys to defile the swan / and
to make him black as he is. But forasmoche as he cowde not bring his propose
abowte while the swan was waking. He la bowryd to do it while he was slepinge.
Wherefore upon a night slepinge ye swan / the cursyd crow came to his neste
in secret wise and defilyd the swan / and made hi all black. And wha^ the
day was spr^nge and Titan shoone / and the swa^ was risen from sleep and
espied that he was effect and pollute / he went and wasshyd him self so long
/ that he was puryfyed and clean / from all filth and said.

who that desires blessed to be.
Must euyr be clean in his degree.
THe crow signifies the Devil / which may not see nor behold the clean
life of the seruauntys of God. wherefore with all his power and might he is besy
to pollute and defile them. But forasmoche as he cannot prevail again them
waking / he labowrith to deceive them slepinge / wherefore man owith to wake.
For saint Augustyn says. Thyn enymye wakyth and thou sleapiste. And it is
written primo Petri vltimo. Dear friends be ye sobre and wake in devout
prayers / for yowre aduersarye the Devil goyth abowte like a lion rorynge /
and seeking whom he may deuowre. To whom resist ye strong in yowr faith. And
Isidore says. Such folk as be stable in faith / when wicked spirits see
they cannot overcome them waking / they trowble them sore sleapinge / wherefore
it is read in vitis patrum. That fendis deludyd a Relygyows man in somoche
that when he with his bredryn should have been how silde / while he slepte
there aperyd unto him the symylytudes of women and defilyd him / and he asked
cownsell of his senyowres what was best to do. and they inquyryd of his diete
and gydynge / and found by experience that it grew not of superfluyte of mete
and drink / and therefore they iugid yt it came of illusyon of the devil / and
they sadlye cownsellyd him not to abstain from the holy comunyon for that
cawse. and aftyrwarde the Devil deludyd him no more / and showed that he had
done it for to withdraw the holy man from that holy mysterye.

Of a bird Called Ornix and the Hen. Dialo. lxxi.


Upon a time Ornix the wodehenne e^pyed the eggis of a Pecocke and made her
neste in a rychemannys hows. and when ye Chekyns were hacchyd and browghte
forth. They were greatly belouid of the richeman. wherefore he set great price by
this hen and fed her delycatlye / yt she should the bettyr noryssh her
birds. But this Ornix was unkind to the other hennys of that place. For she
was bold of her mastir for fauowre of the chekyns and would in nowyse suffer
the hennys to pyke with her / but beat them and drove them away. The hennys
were bytterlye greuyd and said no word / but hopyd to see a time to be
auengid. and when these chekyns were growyn up they forsook this wodehenne /
and tournyd unto there own pecocke kind / and the richeman took not then so
great head of this wodehenne as he had done / but suffirde her to scrape for
her living among other hens. And they were fresshly remembrid of the old
persecucyo^ of this wodehe^ne and thought they would be avenged / and therefore
they would not suffer her to pyke with them. And when she reuoluyd in her mind
the old felycite and wealth that she had be inn / and the mysery that she was
come to. She wept and said. Alas alas I have norysshed children and brought
them up and they have forsakyn me. But notwithstondinge the hennis would
show no mercy to her. but laid on and all to beat her and said.

He that is prosperows and has the world at will
Owith not to be cruel all other for to spyll.
THis should every wiseman remember when he is in office or in prosperity / and
not to despise them yt be under. For the time always ronnyth / and there comyth
many chaungis as it is written Ecclesiast.iii. al thing has time and every
thing under heuyn is mutable in space. For there is a time of prosperity and a
time of aduersite. Time ronnyth like a whele / in the which some ascend and
some descend. but they that be going upward should not despise them that be
cominge downwarde. For as it is said Ecclesia.vii. Scorn thou noman that is
in heaviness for God is an ouerseer that can make both high and low. and
alsoo hit is written Eccles.xi. In the days of thy wealth be not forgetful of
harmys / and especyall for chaunginge of times and also of offices / for as
Isidore says. Temperal power is faynte frail and Caduke. Who can say and tell
where be the kings and princes or the Emperoures. where be the richemen where
be the mighty men / of the world / Xerses king of Perse and Mede most proud
and most mighty which ouertournyd hills and coueryd the sees. when upon a
time he stood in an high place / and sawgh and beheld an infinite and
innumerable multitude of people he weppyd sore. Remembringe that within an C.
yerys space after that / noon of them should be leuynge. and also when he went
again the grekys / with a Thowth and thowthandes of men of armies / and with a
M. and. CC. of ships seeing before him so great an host / and remembringe
of the chawnablenesse of time / and of the breuenesse of life and whereto all
thing should return / he was humylyate and made low in his own mind and
said. Men call me a king / that am but a man of such power and strength to
bring such a multitude togider. but sertaynly I say my self as true is /
that I am but duste and asshyn. alsoo when the Duke of lotheringe / lay in
extremys / and was departinge from the world he lokyd upon his howses and
castellys and said. O good lord what auaylyth these temperall goods. For I
that have so many castellys and palacys / and have had power to give loggynge
to so many men / know not now whethir to goo nor where I shall be lodgyd.

Of the Quayle and the Lark. Dialogo. lxxii.
Upon a time the Quayle bethoughte her and said. The Goshawke is a great
pursewar of my kynrede. but and if I might be at peace with him and have his
frendeshippe and fauowr. I were then in great suretye and at great hartys
ease. and therefore she called the Lark unto her / and spoke fair to her and
said. Thou art worthy to be lawdyd for thou art called alauda for thy wisdom
Therefore I desire the to goo to the Goshawke for me / and get me his
benyuolence and say to him. The quayle recommendith her unto the obedyently as
thy subject / and she heartily desires to be knytte with the in amyte and
fauowre / and to have sure and stable peace with ye for ever / for the which
cawse she sent me to ye yt I should give a prouyd answer. The Lark went forth
mekelye and reportyd these words to ye Goshawke. The Goshawke was trowblyd
greatly with this message and said to ye Lark. This is an hard matter and
grievous to here. Nevertheless I will yt she her self come with ye to my
presence / and speak her own mowth for her self. And when the Lark had hard
these words she retournyd and showed them joyfully to ye Quayle. The Quayle
was glad and forth she went with ye Lark to ye Goshawke to conferme piece and
love between them And as soon as ye Goshawke espied them togider / He fell in
desire and concupiscens and cawghte them both and ete them and said.

Noman should him self follow make.
With him that is great but keep his own state.
ANd in likewise he that has enymyes that be mighty and strong may not
provoke them / to be frendlye to him but at there own pleasure that he be not
acombrid with them. wherefore hit is written Ecclesia.xiii. Be thou far fro a
man that has power of death. For and if thou be with him / thowe shall fall in
to his snares / as a Fable is told / that an Ass upon a time for cawse of
solace walked in a wood and met with a boore and boldly salutyd him and
said. Hayle mine own brodir. The boore herynge that was mouyd with ire / and
thought to ^ere the Ass on small pe^^s with his teth. But he refrained him
self and said I would all to rent the / but my noble teth despise / and
abhor so foul and hateful flessh as thine is. And yt auaylyth the thy life
/ herebye it is showed that he that is a fool owithe not to make Iapes and
derysyons to him that is wyce. Nor he that is low and in pouertye to be to
besye with him that is mighty and rich. For they that be pouer and in low
degree may dread and fere to be oppressyd and to be punyshed richemen and
mighty dread not / but they be bold for they be but seelde punyshed. Therefore
the Cock answerde to the Goshawke that demaundid of him this questyon and said
What is the cawse that ye dread men somoche with whom ye be brought up and
daily noryshed / and we be buxome and come to there hondes wylfully. Tell me
quod the Cock if euyr thou saw.xx. Goshawkes in oone hows as is of us. And
for that we be so famylyer with them we be punyshed sore daily / and that
causith us to dread them and to fly from them for fere.

Of a bird called Ison Dialogo. lxxiii.


ISon as says brito is a bird of the kind of a grype. but she is white and
less than a gripe / and most rauenows. This bird in her yowth had done
great myschefe / and stolyn chekyns and trowblyd both men and birds. At last
in her age she repentyd and was penytente and willing to restore that she had
mystakyn / and to do penance / and to exercise dedys of mercy and live
rightwyslye. But forasmoche as she had my spente her Iuuente and was not
acustomyd in virtue. She cowde noon occupye in age / wherefore she stryuyd with
her self and would feign have done good dedys. But for cawse that she had no
good beginnynge in yowthe she cowde have no good ending in age / and therefore
she mowrnyd and said.

He that is young and to no vertewe applies
In age to amend him bad custom denies.
Therefore it aperith that it is expedyent to gadre vertewys and good dedys in
yowth that they may be fownde in age. For Ecclesiast says. In yowth thou
gaderist no goodness. And how shuldiste thou find any in age. Sone in thy
yowth tempte thyn own mind / and if thowe find it wicked give it no power.
And a sertayne versifier says. He that in yowth no vertewe uses. In age both
virtue and grace him refusith. And that cawsith badde custom. For as the
Philosofre says. Custom is a nothir kind. For the strength of custom is so
great that a man shall do sometime slepinge as he has vsid to do waking. And
that he has vsyd to do lokynge / He does blind fylde. Wherefore it is told of
a leche to whom there was owyng.xiii. lib. payable in three yeris / and when he
labowryd in extremys and was mouyd to confession and to receive the holy
Sacrament. There cowde no word be had of him but.xiii. lib.in three yeris /
and with such words he dyed. For bad custom and use false iuges and vocates
be wont to do much hurt in there domis and business / and otherwhile they
ordir all thing full symplye / in there last ends / when they have most need
of wisdom. Wherefore upon a time when the Sacrament was browght to a sykeman
and profird him to receive / he said. Let it be iugid first if I be worthy to
receive hit or not. And they that stood bye / said in this manner. yower
Judgment is notte approuyd. For ye have notte suffycyente power / of Iustise
to Judge me by any cawse ryghtfully. An other there was alsoo which labowryd
toward his ending. And when he was warnyd by his friends to receive ye holy
Sacrament / he desired space longer / and they would noon grant him. For
they saw well yt death came fast on / and he for custom of apelys that he
had used before / apelyd that same time from the opyn greef of that same
infirmyte. But his apele preuaylyd him nothing.

Of a bird Called Mergus in Laten in Englyssh a Dyuedopper. Dialo. lxxiiii.


MErgus as says brito is said of drownynge / for it is a bird which sekyth
her mete in the watyr and is always dyuynge and therefore some folkys call her a
Dyuedopper or a doppechyk. This Mergus waxyd unlusty and neglygente and said in
his own mind. What do I wretch. Emonge all birds there is not oone yt
sekythe her mete with so great labowre as I do. For all the long day I
drown my self in the pyttes and watyrs to have my living. And parauenture at
last I shall peryssh and be destroyde / It is bettyr for me to goo to other
birds that be my fellows and to seek my mete with them / and than shall I not
be in such iubardye / nor ete my bread in labowre and sorrow as I do. But I
shall fare much bettyr with less labowre. And when he was flow in to the
feelde and sawghte his food with other birds / he cowde find no mete that
sauowrid in his mouth / and so he was passyngly leene and hongrie / daily. And
notwithstondinge for all that penuryte and ho^gre he would not return to his
natural Occupacyon nor plunge him self in the watyr for very slowth and
vnlustynes / but dyed in great nedenesse and said.

He is not worthy mete nor drink.
That therefore will neither sweet nor swynke.
IN likewise many a neglygent person full of slowth and vnlustynes / will not
labowre / but rather live in great pouertye. Wherefore it is written Job
quinto. Man is born to labowre. And if he deny to labowre / he does not that
thing that he was ordeynyd to do. And therefore he shall not come to that
reward that he was create to have / yt is to mean Infinite good. And also the
Apostle wrytteth primo ad Corinthios.ix. He that labowrith shall ete. Therefore
thou man as Isidore says seek to the a prophetable occupacion / by the which
thy mind may be occupied. For it is full merry and wholesome both for the body
and soul to have moderate labowre. There was a wydow thewich refusyd to be
beryed in a smock that was geuyn her and said. I will be buried in that mine
own hondes made and not othermennys. It is read in vitis patrum. That abbot
arsenye in his beginning was greatly magnyfied in the Emperowres palace. But
aftyrwarde he was an heremyte most perfighte. And when sertayn persons asked
of hi^ where in his trust was most / he answerde and said. In this that I have
exchewyd ryotte and compenye / and have spoke but little. But most princypallye
I am glad and rejoice yt I have labowrid with mine own hondes and put no man to
charge for my cawse.

Of a Carduell in his cage. Dialogo. lxxv


There is a bird named Carduellus which is a bird of song and was inclosyd in
a cage in a rychemannys place and deyntely fed / for this worthy man had great
pleasure / to here his song. And for that cawse he was plentyuouslye served
daily both of mete and drink / and caryd nothing for them that were nedye /
and within a short space there fell great hongre and many pore birds were sore
punyshed with hongre and cold for it happyd in ye seruente winter season. And
therefore they went to this Carduell and asked his almysse. But he gave them
none but the fragmentys and leuynges of his Table / and such as he would not
ete him self. The sely birds gladlye took that was geuyn them and made no
refuse. But ete it meryly and said.

Mete that is not comparable to Elys and congre.
Will serve right well to them that has hongre.
SOme such folks there be which unto pouer people will give nothing that
goodis / but that yt is vile and nawghte. And almighty God abhorryd the
oblacyon of Cayme for cause that he gave of the worste / and he acceptyd the
gifts of Abell / for he offirde of the best. Wherefore Jacob said to his
children. Bring ye of the best fruits of the earth. and it is written
proverb.iiii. worship thou God of thy substance / and give thou to the pouer
of the first increce of thy fruits / and also it is written in the same place.
Offer thou no small gift / for God refusith that is offirde of yt worste It is
a great unkindness to give of the best to man and offer to Godde of the
worste / Mastir Alaynered at mownte pessulane / and the knights that dwelled
bye hard tell of his great clergy / and that he would answer to every
questyon. And therefore with a comune consent / they came to him and asked of
him what was the grettest curtesye that cowde be. To whom he said To give and
to be lyberall. And when they understood his answer. They affermyd hit / and
Consentyd thereto. And he bad them take there cownsell togidir and tell him which
was the grettest chorlysshnes that cowde be among all other. And they laid
there hedis togider and cowde not accord. And when he saw that / herebukyd
them and said. I my self set you in the way by the which ye might well have
knowyn the plain solucyon of my questyon. For like as geuynge is most
curtesye. So is takyn away most chorlysshnes / for it is contrary to gift.
Therefore ye that continually take away poremennis goods / and give unto God
that is nothing or little worth. ye be most chorlelyssh and most unkind /
as it is said / it is more gracyows to give than to take. In gestis Romanorum
it is written of the lyberalyte of Cite the Emperowre. That on a time as he sat
at soper he remembryd that he had given nothing that day. Wherefore he wept
and said. O friends this day have I lost / for I have geuyn nothing this
day.

Of an unclean bird called Iuis and of the Poticarye. Dialogo. lxxvi.


AS Papye says Iuys is a bird of egypt / and aftyr the law hit is the most
unclean bird that is. For she is fed with deed Careyne / nyghe the sea
bankys or floodis / and she purgith her self with her byll / and alsoo she
eteth the Eggis of serpentys. Apotecarye took this unclean bird / and would
have puryfied her / that she might have been lawfully meteable. And he put her
in to his Potecarye shop / that she should smell sweet / and be pourgyd with
medecynes. but all that sauowryd not with her / while she was there / but rather
she couetyd stynkynge careyne. wherefore she would not abide / but went her
way. For her apetite was not to ^arye there clennes and swettenesse was. and
therefore she endyd the residewe of her life in filthede and corrupcyon as she
had before vsyd and said thus.

Such mete as sauowrith to me that will I have
Of Potecary spyces I will never noone crave.
SO faryth manyon that be unclean both in body and mind / and customably
excercysed in the foul sins of lechery and couetyse. For they sauowre nor
desire noon other thing. and if they be but a short space withdrawn from such
flesshlye and worldely delectacyons. They be soon retournyd to there sins
again as a dog to his vomyte. Therefore saint Jerome says. Woe be him that
in lechery dyethe / and woo be to him that in his last end makythe an end of
his stynkynge lechery. a fable is told that sarcho upon a time came owte of a
donghyll / and flewe in to the feelde and was all the day emonge the flowers
of almondes / of lylyes and of rooses / and at night when he came home he
fownd his lemman in the donghepe. wherefore with great joy and affection he
lepte in and said. The sweet sauowres and precyows flowers of the feelde be
nothing in respect of this delectable place / and so he endyd his life in
stynkynge lechery and corrupcyon where in he had most delyghte.

Of the Solytary Pelican. Dialogo. lxxvii*


PEllicanus as says papye is no great bird / and he delyteth to dwelin
wilderness. Upon a time a Ducke and a gandre made a great sooper to the which
they desired to come almaner of Tame fowls. And moreover for to worship the
sowpere they went in to wilderness / and brought with them the Pellycan to
the same sowpere And when sowpere was done all tame birds prayde the Pellycan
to dwell with them emonge people and no longer to dwell in deserte in the
large wilderness like a Pilgrim. Nor to suffer so great sharpness and
penurite. The Pellycan was victe and ouercom with the fair words and desires
of the Tame birds / and tarried still with them a sertayne season / and had
royal chere and faryd delycatelye every day. But when he should pray and be
in contemplacyon and redynge of holy scripture / he cowde not be quyete. For
the noise and chaterynge that the birds made. Nor he cowde not live soberlye
as he had before vsyd / for great habowndance of mete and drink. Wherefore he
conceived an inward remembrance of his soul health / and as soon as he had
oportunyte / he retournyd in to wilderness and in to secret place where he
labowryd in gostely labowre / and perfowrmyd a manly batell again his goostely
enymys / and endid his course / and obseruyd his feith and devotion in great
quyetenesse and said

He that will pray and be contemplatyf.
Most fle fro noise and all worldly stryf.
ANd in likewise thou yt desirist to serve god. Evermore when time requires
take laysar / and be solytary / yt in quietenesse thy mind may be occupied in
holy meditacio^s / in prayers and co^te^placio^s so yt thy soul may delyghte
in the collocacyon of almighty God. and hark what Barnarde says. O thou holy
soul be thou aloone / that thou may keep thy self to thy lord God / whom
thou have chosyn before all other. Fle from the love of things create if thou
desire to be louyd of him that is creator and maker of all thing. Fle the
world if thou will be clean / for augustyn says. If thou be clean thou
delyteste not in worldelye things. abbot arseny as it is red in vitis patrum
praid and said. Lord led me in to the way of health everlasting / and there
came a voice to him and said. Fle fro badde compeny / be still and occupye no
vain speech and rest in vertewe and thou shalt be sauyd. He that sits in
solytude and restith. Is delyueryd from threfolde parell / that is to say of
herynge / of sight / and of speech. A solytary person went in to wilderness
clothyd in a lynnen sack / and had no mo clothis. And when he had walked by
the space of three days he went up on a great roche of stone / and fownde
under hit great plentye of grene herbys / and a man fedynge like a beast /
and he went down pryuelye and made him a ferde / and he being nakyd fled / for
he was shamefaste to abide the sight of man / but scantly he might escape And
the other folowyd him and cried. Tarry and abide for I follow the for the love
of god / and the other answerde and said. And I fle for his love. Then he that
was clothid threw away his clothes and folowyd hi^ and when the other saw
that / he abode him and said Now thou have cast from the thy worldely
clothing I have tarried for ye. To whom he said. Fader tell me some good
word whereby I may be sauyd. And he answerde saying. Fle from woldly people
and be still of speech and thou shall be sauyd for these be the principal
beginninges of health. For there as is people is much trowble. Wherefore Seneca
says. As oftyn as I have been in great compeny I have been trowblyd or ever I
have departed. And therefore it is said. Trenorum tertio. Blessed be that man
that shall sit solytaryly and be still. For he shall lift him self above him
self.

Of the Chaste turtyll, Dialogo. lxxviii.
Clean and most Chaste is the Turtyl among all other birds. For while she
dwellythe with her husbonde / she louyth never noon other. And if he dye she
never takith mo husbondis nor makes. And aftir his death she ever drinks
trowblyd water / and sits never aftyr upon grene tree nor bowgh. There was
sometime a Turtyll that was a wydowe for her husbonde was decesid. wherefore she
was greatly heavy and would never walk abroad / nor take consolacyon. But in
great merowre and lame^tacyon she contynuyd and led a very clean and chaste
life. and all other birds were compassionable unto her consyderinge that she
was lyklye to peryssh for the great and continual heaviness that she made.
Wherefore they flewe togider to her and said. Sister why consume ye yowre self
thus with heaviness and sorrow. Come and be merry with us a while / for we in
the most glad wise that we can intend to cherissh you and lodge you and do
you comfort. And the Turtill knowinge there good wylles was somdele comforted
and went charitably with them. And all the birds receyuyd her frendely and
brought her to there nestis / and gave her part of all such vytayles as they
had. This Turtil was armyd with the zele of chastyte / and when she understood
the great fornicacyons that were occupied there. She might in no wise suffir
the stenche of there lecherye. wherefore she fled and abhorryd the place and
wyllyd not to abide there. And when she had done so oftyntymes / at the last
she utterly forsook that lecherows compenye / for ever and retournyd unto the
clennesse of chastity and said.

I will be chaste both in body and thought
To flesshly corrupcyon will I never be brought
SO owe they to do that be bownde to keep chastity For they should not only
flee fro lecherows personys. But also fro the howsis of them / for the
abomynacyon and stenche of lecheryc. For there is nothing more stynkynge and
hateful then the stenche of lecherye / and flesshly lust with pollucyons /
and therefore Bernarde says. The apetyte of lechery is full of thowght adede of
abomynacyon and uncleanness. The end is shame and great heaviness. Ambrose
tellyth lybro tercyo de virginitate. Of a mother and her daughters that kyssed
each other and ledynge like a dance / they lepte all togider in to a great
watyr and drownyd them self for cawse they would not be rebukyd of there
neybowris of there vyolacyon. And saint Augustyn tellyth a like tale in his
book de Ciuitate Dei / of Lucrece which when she was vyolently oppressyd of
the kings son Tarquynye / she inducyd her friends to be venged. And
aftyrward she was syke and impacyent of that same sin that was comytted with
her / and kyllyd her self. Though she should not so have done / as saint
augustyn says. For verylye no creature owithe to sle her self for to eschew

person / perseueringe in a chaste purpose though she be vyolentlye oppressyd.
For the body is sanctified or corrupt aftyr ye entente of the mind. And

told Libro terciode nuges philosophorum. That when a sertayne person upon a
time rebukyd her husbonde / and said that he had a foul stynkynge breath. And
he asked of his wife why she warnyd him not thereof that he might have sowght

but I believed verily that every mannys mowth had smellyd so / wherefore it
aperid be very lykelyhode that she had never kyssyd mannys mowth / except

Of the Theuyssh Partrych. Dialogo. lxxix.


PErdix berith her name of the voice. Ambrose and Isidore say that it is a
subtle bird and a frawdelente in so much that she will stele the Eggys of
other birds and noryssh them and bring them forth. But her frawde is not
proueable. For when the chekins that she had hatchid here the voice of there
own modyr by there own natural instinccyon they forsake her that brought them
up and return unto there own modyr that gendrid them. and this Partrich
mkayth her neste among thick busshis and thornis / and leyth her Eggis in the
bare duste. And when any man comyth bye where her nestis be. The hennys of them
come owte / and show them self as though they might not go nor fly. and as
they might sone be takyn. and they goo ever the longer the slowlyer / and by
this sotylte they tarry them that they mete till that they bring them far
from there nestis. Upon a time there was a false partryche that stale ye Eggis
of an other bird in her absence. and when she that had been absente was
retournyd home to her own neste and fownde not her Eggis she made great sorrow
and sowght all abowte with a full heavy chere for them But at the last with
great labowre / and stodye she fownde both the eggs and the thief that stale
them / and immediately she showed the matter unto the Iug^* and he cytyd the
thief / and examyned the matter subtellye. But he cowd not come to the knowledge
of the trowth For the thief denied it utterly. and the judge cowde not give
diffinytif sentence of death / for there was no witness. And she that was
accusatrix said to the judge. Thou owyste to tourment him and to compel him to
show the trowth. To whom the judge answerde and said Thou owyste to prove that
thowe haste said / that mi judgment may be rightful. Or else I shall
punysshe the with her. But when no proof cowde be made of ye matere. the judge
had suspeccyon and commandid them both / to be grievously punyshed / and emonge
there pains examynyd of the matter. And the thief made opyn confession both of
that myscheuows deed and many other that he had done before that time. Wherefore
the judge commaundid the thief to be hangid withowt lengar taryinge and said.

He that stelyth and also accusith.
By great sotylte him self excusith.
Therefore begin thou first at thy self / and reuollue in thyn own mind / and
think what thou art thy self that accusist an other / and whedir thou be not
reproueable of that same word or deed. For it is written ad Romanos secundo. O
thou man that iugiste. Thou art not excusyd / for in that same fawte that thou
iugiste an other / thou dampnest thy self. For thou commyttyste tho same crimes
yt thou iugiste. Therefore thou that techiste an othyr / techyst not thy self.
Thou stelyste / and rebukyst theft. thou doyste lecherye / and byddest
contrary / wherefore Caton says. Do thou not that thing / that thou art wond
to blame. For it is rebukefull to a doctoure that does ye same. Upon a time
there was a tyraunte gave Judgment that a thief should be hangyd / and a
Philosofre that was there present / and hard it lawghyd. and he was asked of
the Tyraunte why he lawghyd. And he answerde and said. For great theuys judge
small And Saint Augustyn de Ciuitate Dei / Libro primo. Capit. quarto /
brings in an Example / of Alexander and Dyonyde a pirate. That when he was
take and Alexander asked him why he enforcyd the sea. He answerde and said. By
fre presumpcyon as thowe doyst all the world. But for cawse that I occupye but
with a small Nauye I am called a thief. And thou named an Eemperowre / for thou
occupiest with a great main. If Alexander were takyn aloone. He were a thief.
If much people were attendaunt to my request. Dyonydes should be Named an
Emperowre. Lack of goods cawsith my badde name. And in tolerable pride and
insacyable couetyse make the a thief. If fortune chaungyd I might fortune be
thy bettyr / and thou that art now more fortunable / myghteste hap to be
worse than I am. Alexander meruaylyd greatelye of the constauncie and
steadfastness of this Dionidys / and said to him / I shall make a preefit thou
will do bettyr in time coming. For I shall change thy fortune / that from
hensforth thy manhood shall be alowyd with thy good manners. And cawsyd him to
be ascribid unto his knights / that he might lawfully do knyghtelyt service /
and live there bye ever aftyr duringe all his life.

Of the Pie and other birds. Dialogo. lxxx.


There is a bird named Pica / the which is the most subtle as says Plinyus
/ and varyed with colowris of black / and white. There was sometime a wylye
pie / that dwelled with a byrder and cowde speak both Englissh and Lateyne.
Wherefore the fowler cherysshed her well and maynteynyd her greatly. And the
Pie was not vnremembrid of the benefytes of her kepere. And thowght to reward
him / and flewe forth to other chateringe birds and sat with them famylyerly /
and spoke mannys speech. These birds were very glad and reioycyd gretely to
here her. And they had great affection to lern to iangle and speak as she did.
Wherefore they called ye pie to them / and said to her all with oon voice. We
pray and beseech the to teache us to speak as thou spekyste / and we shall
reward the to thy pleasure. To whom the pie answerde and said. I can give you
no full answer unto the time that I have spoke with my mastir that tawght me.
Nevertheless if it please you to fly with me to him. He shall receive you full
curteyslye / and teache you as I am tawghte. The birds were credible and flewe
togider with the pie. And when the pie came home to her mastirs hows / she
showed hi^ all her mind and said. Go make ready thy nettis and I shall fly in
to them with these birds. and the birds hard well the speech of the Pie /
but they understood her not. And therefore they went forth merylye and feryd
not. And even forthwith came the fowler and stretchid his nettys / and the Pie
went forth to the birds and said. Dowte not deresusters / but fly with me
boldly. For I have spokyn peseably to my mastir for you and he will receive
you with good will. And when they were all come in to the nettys. The fowlar
wrappyd them in the nettys and took them / and sold them / and made him self
rich and said.

To them that thou canste not understand.
Give thou no credence on se nor on land.
ANd so we owe to be ware of credence geuynge to such as speak to us subtellye
/ and be sophemys For it is said Prouer.xxix. A man that speaks to his friend
with flatering and feigned words / strecchid owte a net before his fete to
kache him. And in ye same place it is said. A false flatereris like a Snars to
an innocente. Wherefore on a time a ryatowre said to his felows when he saw a
pouer man bear a lamb to the markette to sell. Will ye have the lamb that he
berith to markette. And they said. ye with good will And he ordeynyd his
felows to stand in diverse placis as the poreman should come / and every of
them should ask if he would sell the dog that he bare. And when the first
had asked him / he answerde and said. It is not a dog / but a lamb. and
when they had met with him all and asked so / the simple man believed that ye
lamb was a dog / and so let them have it for little or nowghte. and in
likewise manyon believe every thing that is told them / which is great
parell. Wherefore it is said Eccles.xix. Believe thou not every word. But in
every deed / the possibilite and the end / is to be dowbtyd. as it is told in
fable. That upon a time myce made a counsel / and there it was concludyd that
they would ordeyne a bell and it should be hangyd abowte ye Cattis neck / that
the myce might here when she came / and flee and hyde them self. There was among
the^ a mows that was very wyttye / and said. I put case that the bell be made
who shall hang it about the cattis neck, and there was not oon that durst
take it upon him. And so they let fall there purpose for cawse they cowde not
perform it.

Of a Kyte that begilyd the wodehennys chekyns. Dialogo. lxxxi.


MIluue a Kyte / as says Isidore / is a bird nyghe as great as an Egle / and
has c^eys Fete and byll like a Goshawke / but they be crokyd and notte right
/ and he has wings like a Goshawke. And he is but weke in strength and not
very swyfte. And he rauenouslye awaylith to sle small chekyns / and oftyn
times he is abowte flesshamyls and there as Careyne is. And as Plynius says.
The kyte is bold in small things / and ferefull in great things / and ye
sperhawke put him to flyghte / thowgh he be dowble so great as he. This Kyte
cruelly cawghte the Chekyns of a wodehenne and ete them. Wherefore Ornix there
mother was sore greuyd and brent inwardely for impacyence / and never would
spare the Kyte aftyr / but ever enuyed her / and sawghte to be avenged with all
her power. And aftyrwarde the kyte repentyd him and was compuncte and asked
forgyuenesse both by him self and by messengers of the great mourdre that he
had done. But this Ornix was indurate in malice / and would not be merciful
nor grant him forgiveness / and said

I shall never forgive the and grant the full rest
While thou have life. Nor when thou lie in cheste
SO manyon be indurate and nenyr will forgive to them that ask forgiveness.
again such or sauy owr says Mat.vi. If ye forgive not to men there sins.
yowr heuynly fadir shall not remytte yowr of fencis. And saint Augustine says.
Every creature shall receive such forgiveness of God / as he geuyth to his
neybowre. Wherefore it is written Ecclesiasti.xxviii. Forgive to thy ney bower
that he has noyed the / and then to the prayinge thy sins shall be forgeuyn.
For Saint augustyn says / that a wiseman not oonly forgettyth iniuryes and
wrongs / but alsoo he says he suffyrde noon. and alsoo Seneca says in his
book dequattuor.virtutibus making inquisicyon of the constancye of a wiseman.
If a wyseman be smytten what shall he do. He answerde and said. What did
Caton when he was smytten on the mowth / he granted not Nor he venged not ye
wrong / and he not only forgave / but said he had no hurt / yt hi^ thought
most honest saying yt he cowd. Seneca says / in ye same book speking of Ire /
and tellith of Socrate / yt as he went by ye cite / and was smytten with a
great buffet / he said nothing else but yt it was an heavy case / that men knew
not when they should do on helmettis on there hedis / and when they should not
also in the same book it is told of Diogene the Philosofre / that when he had
talkyd with oon was named lentulus / and this lentulus was mouyd with ire / and
spet in the face of the philosofer / he pacyentlye suffirde him and wypid his
face and said to him thus. O Lentule I shall bear witness that all they be
deceived that say thou haste no mowth. and Seneca also tellyth that so crates
had two Wyuys. The which were very Ielous and contencyows / in somoche that on
a day / they made a sawte upon him and threw him to grownde. and an
othirtyme when oon of them had sore auexyd him / he went forth and said. I
fere we shall have great thondir after this trowbelows wedir / and set him
self down by a wall / of the hows / and she cawghte a pispotfull of vryne and
poryd it on his head. But Socrates kept his pacyence and said when he had
wyped him I knew well that aftyr great thonder / there should follow rain. and
when his friends had counsellyd him that he should put them from him / he
answerde and said / I lern at home what I shall be in the markette. That is to
mean. I lern pacyence at home that I may show it opynly. when a man asked on
a time / of theodose the most meke and pacyente Emperowre / how he cowde
suffer the great iniuryes and wrongs that were done to his own person / and
how he might here him self the rebukeful words of his enymyes and venged it
not. He answerde and said. we do thus for cawse that we would feign bring
deed men to life. that is to say. wicked men to vertewe. For it is but a small
deed to slemen that be leuynge. For the smaleste bestis ye bear life may do yt
as loppes and spidirs / and also venymous serpentis may sone sle a man. But it
is a great thing and possible oonly to god to reyse them that be deed.

Of the Owl that would have lordshippe of all wild fowls. Dialo. lxxxii.


AS says Isidore / Bubo is called so of the sownde of the voice / and it is
called an Owl aftyr owr Englyssh tongue / and it is a passing cruel bird and
greatly loodid with fedyrs / and full of slowth and feeble to fly. And there is
an awtowre that spekythe of her and says. The owl sowpith up the douys
Eggis and hurtyth and cachith myce / and she lurkyth in Chirches and drinks
the oil of the lamp and defilith it with her donge. And when she is impugnyd
of other birds that love daylyghte she sits and defendith her self with her
Cleys / and by night she wandrith and flies about / and in the day time /
she hydeth her self in hoolys of wallys / with this bird many other birds be
takyn that fly about her / and rob her of her feddirs. For all they hate her
and be enymyes unto her / and therefore these byrders take all manner of birds
with the owl. Plinius says that the tail comyth first fro the egg. This
owl is a night bird most foul and hateful among all other birds / and
there be versis of difference between Bubo bouis / for an Owl / and hic bufo /
bufonis / for a Toode.verse. Anodyows bird is bubo the owl. but bufo is a
beast most foul. Upon a time when all birds had made a great conuocacyon /
and after sowper they went all to re^^eferinge nothing. The owl came for the
when night was come and exalted her self and said. I am greatly rebukyd and
subduyd of all birds / and nothing magnyfied as my noblesse requyrith / but
now I will exalte my self. For I will now with my friends and kynsmen lepe
among these other birds / and we shall sle and destroy the gretteste and the
rulers of them. And aftirwarde I shall be Duke and ruler of all wild fowls
and birds. Wherefore she called forth unto her the porphuryon and the
nightcrowe. The back and the sweet / and also almaner of nyghtbyrdes. And they
all togider in bright harneys with great strength entryd in the night time
upon all other birds. Intendinge to slay the great rulers / and by
vsurpacyon to have the dominyon of the cite. but all the other birds were
wakyd sodeynlye with the noise of there harneys / and when they espied the
great treason / they ran and caught harneys / and took the traitors
euerychone / and brought them all togider fast fettyrde / and chaynyd to the
Egle that he should give ingement upon them. And wha^ the Egle knew this
mateer / he gave this dredeful sentence again the traytowris. That even forth
with they should be drawyn through the cite / and to be hangyd. and also that
the owl and all her kynrede should have perpetual persecncyon / and be takyn
for enymyes to all other birds / and to be banysshed from there company for
ever. And for this cawse after the fygmentys of fablys all other birds pursewe
the Owl and cry owl upon her. Wherefore in the day time she dare in no wise
apere emonge them / but fleyth al by the night and sekyth her mete with great
heaviness and penurite saying in this wise.

He that iuyllry since shall have a fall
and he that betrayth at last peryssh shall
ANd so in many a great cite there is meanys made be proud people and evil
disposyd to destroy them that be above / that they might have the rule.
Therefore such people owith to be ware that they be not pnnyshed as was the owl
/ for it is written Ecclesi.vii. Do thou noon evil and there shall noon come to
the. and offend thou not in great multitude of the cite. Nor be not to besy
among the people. And also it is written Prouer.xxiiii. He that thinkyth to
do iuyll / shall be called a fool. But he yt walkyth lowlye / walkyth surely /
they yt be great and mighty / owith to be content with there worshipr / and
not to usurp lordeship and rule vyolently / For of all lordeshyppe the time is
but short as it is said Eccle.x. and he that will not understand this
breuenesse of time now in this present life / shall feel great pain aftyr
this life / and it is written sapi.v. What has owr pride profyted to us. Or
what has the booste of owr richesse auaylyd us. All this is fled and passyd
like a shodowe. and Valery tellith. li.viii. That when Anaxarchus an eurle had
reportyd unto Alexander that there were innumerable worlds as Democritus had
showed unto him before time. Alas quod Alexander I am but a wretch. For unto
this time have I not obtained oon hole world. And nevertheless within a
short while aftir he was includyd and laid in the space of v. foot. And
therefore Quintus Curcyus tellith that oon said unto Alexander. Beware that
when thou comyst to the heyght of worship to the which thou labowriste. lest
thou be takyn and overthrown with the bows / that is to say / with the
parellys that long unto worship. A sertayne sowldan most noble among all
other king agarenorum. aftyrwarde that he remembrid that he should dye / he
cawsed his wyndynge shete to be takyn and put upon a spear like a baner / and
to be preconysed and cried abowte the cite / that of all his realm and
richesse and tresowres / He should no more carye with him in time of his death
/ but oonly yt same shete to wrappe his body in. And therefore all transitorye
and worldely worship is little worth.

Of the Londebyrdes and waterfowles. Dialo. lxxxiii.
THe Birds of the land beholdinge Waterbyrdes to take there food both in the
watir and on the land / were sore trowblyd and came all togider and said. we
be begilyd and robbyd daily of these Waterfowles. For they be saturate in the
watirs. And aftirwarde when they have well eten / they come to the land and
take away owr l^uinge and deuowre it. And so they called these waterfowles
forth before them and sayd^ to them even thus. We be greatly kept bare by the
meanys of you / for at yowr pleasure ye be refresshid in the waters / and
yet ye cannot be sufficyd. But after yowr sufficient saturation ye come to the
land and deuowre owre leuyng. Do no more so / fro this time forthwarde. For
and ye do. we shall drive you fro the land / or else we shall make some of
you weary of yowr lyuys. To whom the waterbyrdes answerde and said. Sustirs ye
speak vncurteyslye / rebukynge us for owre mete. But we pray you heartily that
ye will vowch sawf to ete with us of owre delicatis / for owr hartys shall be
the meryer for yowre company. And these land birds herynge the profirs of
the other birds / and desyringe watyrmete for gulosite flewe forth togider
with them in to the watyrs* but for cawse they cowde not swym / they were in
great parell / and iubardye of there lyuys emonge the floodes and wawes.
wherefore they cried for help and socowre. The watyrbyrdes were merciful and
full of compassion and would not yield a shrew de turn for an other / but took
them up on there backs and conveyed them to land. Wherefore they were lycencyd
for ever of them to feed both in watyr and land at there own pleasure saying.

Sobre folk dure much lengerthen glotenows
Meke folk live meryer than they yt be inuydyows
SO many a glotynis sorry when he seyth other folks ete / thinkinge yt he shall
never have I nowgh and that he shall lack that is needful. But God is a good
lord that made the world and all thing that is there in as it is written
act.xvii. God has geuyn to al thing life and inspiracyon / and all other
things he has ordained. Therefore Crysostome says. God geuyth carnal
benyfycys to such as be worthy and also unworthy. Therefore we owe to be
content of that god sendyth to us. For as Barnarde says. The most rauenows
bird is content with the air. The wolf with the land / the luce with the
watyr. But a couetows man would rob be the earth the air and the watyr / and
heuyn also if he might for his insaciable desire. But Princes in the old time
were not of that condition / for in them was great contine^ce and restraynte of
glotonye as says vigecius dear mylytari lib.i. Where he spekyth of contynence
of princes / and first of Alexander he says that walkinge in his journey with
his agid seruauntis he vsid to ete bread oftyn times withowte any other
sustinaunce / and in the same wise it is read of Scypion emylyan / and of
Caton it is red that he was content to drink such wine as his seruauntis
drank / that were shipmen and rowyd the ship. And alsoo of Hanyball it is
said / that he restid not before night / and in the night time he vsid to
rise / and in the twylyghte he went to sowper. And in that same place hit is
told of the merueylows abstinence of the hooste under mark satyrie / that
when an apple tree ladyd with applys was in an orcharde adioyninge unto there
castelles seyn of them / it was so left upon the next day / and not oon
apple mynyshed. It is read also in gestis Romanorum / that Augustus Caesar was
a man of small mete. For he was content with bread and small fisshes / and
Chese / and grene fygges / and he took his food in every place / and in such
times as his stomach was desyrows and never else. And this great restraynte of
glotonye was not oonly in men / but also in women / customablye obseruyd / for
by cawse they should be preseruyd from sin and shame. For the belly and
membris of generacyon be nyghe togider / and therefore Jerome says. The belly
that is replete with wine does sone boil and spuyth in to lecherows affection
and desire.

Of the Chorle and the Beys. Dialogo. lxxxiiii.


Upon a time there was a Chorle / which cherysshed many beys in an hyue / by the
which he gate great good / but nevertheless he had many a paynfull townge
of them / when he took owte the Combs. And it fortuned upon a time that he
had a greuows struck of a be / which greuyd him very sore. wherefore he was
right angrye and thretenyd the beys and said in this wise / I promise you by
God almighty / that and ever ye stynge me more / I shall overthrow you and
drive you away. To whom the beys said. Thowe Chorle thou art glad to
gadre and receive the prophetable swetnesse that comyth of us / but thou art
loath to suffer any pain / Take patiently the bitterness / if thou wylt
rejoice the swettenes / or else we will forsake the / and thou shalt never
have more profit by us. This Chorle within a short space after came again to
his hyues / and took owte the honycombes / and forth came a be and stunge him
sore and thryst in his spear / and gave him a great wownde / wherefore he was
wood / and in great anger he overthrew all the hyues and destroyed them and the
beys seeing the great furyowsnes of the chorle. They forsook him all at oonis
/ and came never more there. and so the Chorle was brought to great pouerte /
that was sometime vsyd to live prosperouslye. and when he remembrid the great
avail and profit that he had receyuyd before season of the beys / and the
pouerte that he was fall inn / he bewaylyd his miserable state and said.

He must suffer both disease and pain.
That to have advantage is ever feign.
But now in these deys there be many such that desire to live esilye / and to be
merry and to have worldely joy / and aftyrwarde to regne with Christ in
eternal bliss. Manione seek christ in delytes and pleasure. But as it is
written Job.xxviii. He is not fownde emonge them that intend to live
delycyously / and aftir the bodyly pleasure. and therefore Jerome says. He that
will leave after the doctrine of christ and aftyr the gospel / all his life
shall be paynfull and like a martirdom. For almighty God excludid not man owte
of paradise to the entente that he should have here an other paradise / as
says bernarde. Wherefore it is read in vitis patrum / that a brother of religion
put a question to his abbotte and said. Why am I so slowthfull sittinge in my
cell. To whom he said. For thou sawyst never the great rest that we hope to
come to Nor the great pains of hell that we dread. For and if thou woldist
behold them dylygently / and if thy cell were replete with woormys up to thy
neck thou woldist gladlye and wylfullye abide among them withowte any slowth.
Also it is read in vitis patrum that sertayne bredren of relygyon prayde and
desired an old man that he should take his rest / and labowre not so sore. To
whom he answerde and said. Bredren believe me truly. For Abraham shall repent
him when he shall see the great gifts and rewardis of Godde that he has no
more labowrid and trauaylyd in goostly travail. Also there were an other time
diverse personys that said to a man of great perfeccyon. How art thou
content in thy mind here to suffer so great labowre / and he answerde and
said / all the time of my labowre that I suffer here / is not sufficient to be
comparyd to one day of the tourmentis which be ordeynyd to sinners in time
coming.

Of a lion that fawghte with an Egle. Dialogo. lxxxv.


Upon a time Leo the king of wild beastis fawghte grievously with the Egle
king of all birds. The Lion having on his side all manner of beastis / and
they stood on the grownde ready enbatayllyd and there feldis pighte The Egle
truly with other birds took there advantage both on the grownde and on treys /
and with dartys and sharp arowys they fawght with the beastis A bird called
Gryfes coming bye / and beholdinge this myscheef was very sorry / and went up
to an hill and there abode / and would not meddle among them. The lion seeing yt
was sore aferde and said within him self / and if this Gryfon take part again
me I shall be overcome. The Egle also thought in her mind. This Gryfon has a
tail and fete like a beast. Wherefore I dowte yt and if he fortify the
beastis / I shall not mow dure. Therefore both the lion and the Egle sent forth
embassatowrs to the Gryfon / to understand what he was / and why he sat
there. To whom the Gryfon said / I am a bird and a beast / but neither. H.
nor. k Here I sit for love and peace. For I love no percyalyte / nor rumowre.
And when he had given this answer he was gracyously receyuyd of all beastis
and birds And so this Grifon walked at his pleasure / emonge them all / for he
was not suspect to neither party / and when he saw oportunite / he began to
treat of peace / and for cawse the parties had no suspeccyon in him / they
compromytted the matter freely in to his hondes / and he gave sentence yt they
should depart fro ye feelde in all have possible / and no more to continewe
war / but dwell in peace for ever and said.

He that is willinge peace for to make
Must be indifferent and no party take.
ANd thus every man should do among ye vnpesible to set the^ at rest / yt he may
be ye child of god. mat.v. says blessed be they yt be pesible / yt cause
peace to be among the^ yt discord. they shall be callid children of god. Isaie
lii. How godely be ye fete of the^ yt show peace. and so ye fete of me^ bering
discord be accursyd. as Eccl.xxviii. ye double tongid man and maker of strife
is accursid / for he has troublid manyon yt would have kept peace. It is red
invit. pa. yt on a tym there was a great stryf between an he thin and a christian /
and came togider with there kynsmen and friends even ready to fight / but Saint
Appollony^ prayde them to be in peace. But notwithstondinge oon that was cheef
cawser of the discord and discencyon / which was a cursyd man and myscheuows
lettyd the peace and said that he would never have peace while he leuyd. Then
said the holy man. Be it as thou say For this day shall noon be slain
except the / and thy sepulcher shall be congruente to thy deserving in the
belyes of all birds and beastis / and so it was in deed. For he was sone
slain in that same fight and trodden in the sonde / and there he lay all the
night. And in ye morninge his friends came to burye his body / and they
fownde it all to torn and deuowrid of Grypes and of other wild beastis.

Of the Lion that wedyd twain of his whelpi^. Dialogo. lxxxvi.


IT fortuned upon a time that the lion married twain of his sonnis / and he
gave to every of them a great wood to there marriage. But or ever he sent them
from him he warnyd them of three things / and said. Children keep ye my
commaundmentis / and in especial observe these three things / and ye shall
prospere and leave merylye. First look that ye be in rest and peace with them
that be abowte you. The secounde keep ye well this wood which I have geuyn to
you / that beastis and Catell may multiply and increce there in. And the thryd
fight never with the kind of man in nowyse. The eldeste kept truly these
commaundementis of his fader and increcyd in great wealth and richesse. The
younger troubled sore with his servants and had never peace in his howsolde.
Wherefore he ran in to the wodes with great furyousnes and cruelly kyllyd all
the beastis / that were there / and shortly to tell he robbyd all the wode.
And at a layser he went to see his brodir / and when he behylde him in wealth /
and having great abundance of richesse he said. I am unhappy / for I live
in great penurite and trowble / and thou art iocou^de and lyuyst in great
peace and pleasure. To whom the older said / Thou have not obseruyd my faders
preceptis / and therefore these incomodyteys been fall upon the / but I pray
the to come with me in to the woodis / and se how I have keppyd and increcyd my
faders goods. And as they went togider there came an hunter / and pighte up his
nettys / for to Catch of the beastis. Then said ye younger lion to the elder.
Seyste thou not how yonder little man labowrith and intendith to destroy us.
The elder Lion said. Knowyst not thowe that owre fader commaundid us that we
should not fight with man in nowyse. The younger said. Fie on the wretch wylt
thou lose thy noblesse leonyne for vain fablys I my self shall go pluck him on
small pecys. and as he ran in great haste toward man and took noon head of
the nettis / he fell among them / and was fast masshid and takyn and
destroyed. The elder lion tournyd home again and said with a full sad mind.

The faders preceptis he that obseruith
In great suretye him self conseruith
Therefore it aperith plainly that it is a sure thing to keep the commaundmentis
of fadir and modir and to be obedyent unto them in all thing that lefull is /
as says the Apostle ad colos.vi. Children be ye obedient in God to yowr
genytowris / for yt is rightful. It is told in fablys that a lion was bedrede
and lay in his bed still and might not rise for age. But a whelpe of his
which was very strong / young and lustye. Came to him to vysite him in his
sykenesse. To whom his fader said. Joy thou son and be merye for almaner of
beastis dread the. Sauf of oon thing I warn the. Fight thou never with man /
for he is strengest of all beastis. This young lion was sore temptyd again man
and sauwghte him to fight with him. And as he went he fownde two oxen yowkyd
togider under a iocke / and he asked of them and said. Be ye men / and they
said Nay. But we be subduyd of man This whelpe was ever the longer the
fiersar and fond an horse fast chaynyd with Iron and a sadyll upon his back
and to him he said. Art thou man whom I seek / and he answered and said nay /
but he has made me fast. The lion meruaylyd and ran forth and at the last he
fownde an husbonde man cleuynge a tree. To whom he said. Make the ready for I
will fight with the. And the man answerde. Let us cleue this tree first and
after that we shall have layser I nowgh to fight and with these words the
man made a great clyfte in the tree with his axe / and tawght the Lion to put
in his Cleys in to the clyfte / that it should the sooner be clouyn a sonder.
And when he had put them in / the man pluckyd owte his axe / and the Cleys of
the Lion were fast in the tree / and the man cryde owte for help of his
neybowris. To whose clamowre all men of the town rose up and ran owte / some
with swerdes / some with clubbys and some with spetys / to sle the lion / And
he seeing him self in so great iubardye for haste he left his cleys in the
tree / and scantlye cowde escape with a pair of blodye fete. And so with
great confusyon he tournydde home again unto his Fader / and comfermyd his
cownsell / For he had prouyd hytte / by experience.

Of the Tyrawnte the Gryfon Dialogo. lxxxvii.
AS Isydore says Ethymologiarum xxii. Gryfes is a fedyrde bird / and iiii.
fotyd. And the kinds of these birds be gendrid in eperboray mowntis that is
scithia asiaticha / and he is like unto an Egle both in head and in wyngis /
and in all other parties of his body. He is sembleable to a lion / and he
destroys both men and horsis. and he puts a smaragdyne stone in his neste
/ again venymous beasts of ye mownte / And he sleyth and destroys all men
that dwell nere him. This Gryfon took a great prouynce to rule. But for his
Tyranny and Couetyse he commaundid three things. First that no man should be
receyuyd there neither to bye nor sell. Secounde that no manner of creature
should come thedir from other contrays. The thryd that noon of all his people
should be so hardye to go to other contrays. And these three commaundmentys were
observed of his subiertis / and he leuyd in delycis and pleasure and gadryd
great goods and no wonder. For what so ever that came to his possession he
partyd with noman thereof. But kept it straytlye to his own propre use. And
upon a time by the rightful judgment of God. Thondris lyghtninges and
tempestis destroyed all the contraye. The dwellers and comprouincy allys of
that country ran all togider to the gryfon crying and saying. Go we hens / that
we dye not through honger And he sent forth legates to other nacyons that were
next adioynaunte to him that they should send of there goods and graynes unto
him / and sell them at there own price. To whom they answerde and said. thou
woldist never sell to us noon of thy goods. Nor now in thy need we will noon
sell to the. He sent again other messangers desyringe them to come with
marchaundise and to have fre passage at there pleasure. and they answerde. Thou
woldist never receive us before this time / nor now thou shall not. The third
time he sent to them and prayde them to receive him and his people / and not to
forsake them in mysery and penurite. And they said. Thowe camste never to us
tell now need coartyth the / and therefore we shall not receive the / but
rather drive the from us and if thou come to us. And so forsakyn of al people
in great wretchidnes he dyed with all his nacyon and said.

He that will not serve / nor help at no need.
Shall oftyn be indygent and crave and not speed.
Therefore hit is good to be curteys and to receive foraynes and strangers and
to use marchaundise with other nacyons / and to depart the wordelye goods
with other / and let them run to common use / for owr sauyowre says Mat.vii.
All thing that ye will othermen do to you / do ye the same unto them Thus
biddith the law and prophetis all. And basile says. Be thou such to othermen
/ as thowe desyrest to have them to the. It is red that when Alexander went by
the way with his oste / and both he and all they were nyghe lost with thirst
/ oon gave to him a cup of fair watir / for a great gift / and he
commaundid hit to be powrid owte. For he would not drink him self / for cawse
he cowde not give part to his knights. But ye Couetows man says contrary.
Ecclesiasti.x. I have fownde rest unto me / and I shall ete of mine own goodis
alone. Such couetowse men should not be preferrid Wherefore in the old time
such as louyd auaryce should not be preferryd again ye common well as Valety
tellyth libro sexto / that when two consullis of rome should have be sent in
to spain / and the romans took counsel and deliberacyon there upon. Oon
Scipion said Neither of them lyketh me. For the oon of the^ has nothing and
to the other nothing sufficith. Iugynge equalye pouertye and auaryce in
malyciows people. Also Valerye tellith / that Tiberius the Emperowre chaungid
but seldom the iuges of the prouynces / for cawse that they that were new
ordained were very ready and intentyf to receive. An example is showed of a man
that was wowndid the which a great hepe of flies coueryd / and oon came bye
and saw them and drove them away. To whom he fayde. Thou have done evil to
me / for these were full and replete. Now shall other come that be hongrye /
and do me more greef. and in likewise iugis when they be nedy or couetowse /
they be gredye to catch / and desirows to have. It is red in the fablys of
poetys / that a king desired of apollyne yt whatsoeuyr he towchid might be
tournyd to Gold / and it was grauntyd to him. And so when he should towche
mete or drink with his hondis or with his lips toward his mouth / it was
tournyd in to gold. and he was oftyn hongry / and perisshed for lack of
sustinance. And so haboundance of richesse makyth a couetows man hongry and
destroys him / it is read in Croniclys. That Taryce a queen when she had
takyn the king of perce / she cawsyd his head to be smytte of / and put it in
to a botell full of blood and said. Thou have euyr thrustyd blood. Now
drink blood thy fill. So shall it fall in time coming to couetows tyrauntis
the which desire the blood of the pouer people. That is to say. There goods
and sore labowris. Couetows men in hell shall drink moltyn gold. As a
philosofre tellith that Nero the Emperowre was seen in hell / bathinge him self
in seething gold. And when he saw a great many of comers bye he said to
them / come hider ye people that be venditowrs of yowr neybowris and bath you
here with me / for I have reseruyd the best part to you.

Of a Leoparde and an Unicorn that fawght with a dragon. Dialogo. lxxxviii.


THere is a beast the which is gendrid of a Lion and a Parde says Solinus and
is named Leopardus. And the femalis of them be bolder and strengar then the
malys. Plinius also says. Who so will resist to wode Leopardus must rub
garlyke between his hondes / and withowte Taryinge the Leoparde goith away /
for he in nowyse may abide the air of garlyke. And the Leoparde berith a
colowre subrufe / and he is full of black spottis / and these beastis be much
less them lions / and if he fortune to ete any venyme / he sekyth for the
donge of man / and etith it and is hole. Ambrose says. These leopardus be most
cruel of kind / in somoche that they can never be tamyd to forgete there
cruelnesse. And nevertheless they be tamyd / and tawght to hunte / and when
they se there pray they be let lose / and if he cannot catch hit at the
fowrth or the fyfte lepe / he is even wode / and what so ever come before him
/ in that wodenesse / he rinneth upon it be it man or beast / but if the
hunter preuyde some best and give it him forthwith. For it is impossible to
please him but with blood. This Leoparde upon a time fawght with a dragon /
but he prevailed not. Wherefore he went to the unicorn and mekely besought him
of help and said. Thou art goodely and vertuows / and lernyd to fight.
Wherefore I pray the inteerlye to defend me from the furowre of this dragon.
the unicorn began to exalte him self herynge this comend^cyon and said. Thowe
haste reportid of me as it is truly. For I am an old warryowre and I shall
defend the in the best wise / have thou no doughte. For when the Dragon
opynneth his mowthe. I shall smite him throwgh the throat with my horn. And
when they came both togider to the Dragon. The Leoparde began batell / trustyge
to have help of the unicorn. And the dragon faught again them both / and
spet fire owte of his mowth with great stench. And when the Dragon gapyd / the
unicorn ran as fast as he cowde / willing to thrufte him throwgh the
throat. But the dragon mouyd his head / and the Unicorn smote his horn in the
grownde fast and cowde not pluck it owte / and there he dyed and said.

He that for othermen gladlye wylfighte.
Is oftyn confondid though he have great might
SO hit is but folly for any man to trust ouermoche in his manhood or to fight
for that thing that longith not to him / for it is written Eccle.xi. Fight
thowe not for that thing that is not noyus unto the. Therefore search thou of
thy self within thy self what thowe art / and what thowe wylt do / and
whether that deed partayne to the or not. At lestwyse thowe owist not to
intromytte in an other mannys matere but if thou be partyner therein. Fight not
for an other / nor increce not discordis among them that Varye / but do as
Seneca says / ever let discord begin of an other / and reconsiliacyon of the.
Upon a time diverse men in harneys pursewyd there enymyes / and an other man
came and saw them / and ran to help the man / and stood with him again his
enymyes. And they said unto him. Freynde we profre the no wrong. Take thou
that is thine / and goo thy way / for we desire to be venged on owre enymye /
and not on the / he would not be ruled but made him self ready and sawght again
them with all his power. And they had indignacyon of him and maymyd him with
there enymye.

Of the Olefawnte that bowyth not the kneys. Dialogo. lxxxix.


ELephas as Brito says comith of Elephis greece / which is an hill in lateyne /
and he is so called for the gretnesse of his body. And these beastis be very
apt to batell. For the warryowrs of Perce and Mede / use to fight in Cowris of
Tymbre set upon the ^ackys of these beastis / and cast down sperys and dartys
/ as from a wall / and these Elephawntys have great mind and understanding /
and they goo togider after there manner / and they fere the mows and flee from
him / and they goo two year with whelpe. and they never gendir but oonys. Nor
they have never but oone whelpe at onys. And they live ccc. yeris / as says
Isydore Ethimol.xii. And scripture that conteyneth ye old historyes tellyth
that the Elesawnte is takyn in this manner. Tway maydenes that be very virgins
their pappis being bare / and the ouerpartys of thee bodies also disclosyd and
showed goo both togider where these Elefawntys abide / and oon of them berith a
pot. The other berith a sword / which maydyns with loud voice singing the
Elefawnte herith and comyth nere. And by his natural instinccyon he knowith
the innocencye of the virginal flessh / and geuyth worship unto the chastity
of them. and as he is lyckynge the breasts and pappes of them / he is
meruelously delytyd and fallyth a sleep. and withowte Taryinge the maid with
the sword smyteth him in to the soft belie / and shedith his blood and he
fallyth down and the other maid receyuyth the blood in the pot. with the
which is dyed a purple colowre that longyth oonly to a king to were. This
beast is very famows and greatly reuomyd / among all other beastis / and
notwithstondinge he may not knele / for he has no kneys. Upon a time the Lion
walked by the wode among all other beastis and lokyd on them / and all made
great curtesye / and knelyd down unto him as to there sovereign lord and
king. But the Elefawnt knelyd not / for he might not. Wherefore the other wild
beastis were inuidious and went togider to ye Lion / and diffamyd ye elefant.
ye lion came to hi^ and said. Why art thou so proud and so hard hartyd yt thou
bowist not thy kneys before me as other beastis do. He answerde. My lord I
refer to you honor and worship as my duty is / I may not knele / for I have
no kneys. ye lyo^ said. If thou refuse not to worship me in thy heart / thy
salutacyo^ is acceptable. for he worshippith his lord sufficiently / yt
labowrith thereto with all his possibilite. wherefore ye lyo^ condemnyd the
adversaries yt accusyd ye elefant. and promotyd him to great worship and
said.

Noman wrongfully owith punysshment to have.
But his fawt be prouid / for the judge may him save
IN likewise iugis should attend to give right fall judgment / and not aftir
diffamacyon / but aftir the trowth of every thing. For he is notte always
fawtye that is accusyd / but he that is prouyd as says Isidore. and also he
says. First prove / and then give judgment / Whereof Valery tellith of oon
called Naulius torquatus. That when his son was accusid unto him of a
trespace / and conuicte of the same / he gave sentence of him and said. When I
have cownsellyd my son to observe my commaundmentis and it is prouid unto me
/ that he has receyuyd money of his felows / contrary to my byddinges. I
therefore discharge him of mine hows / and give this sentence that he is worthy
to be punyshed and shall suffer death / and so he did. Thus a judge owith to do /
for he should not do contrary unto right for love nor for hatred. For Bernard
says / love and hatrede knowithe not the judgment of trowth. Therefore Valerye
tellyth libro sexto that when Calericus gouernyd the common well within a cite /
that he made him self / the which was defensyd with full wholesome and just
laws among all other there was a constilucy on that whosoever were take and
prouyd in the cry me of adulterye / should lose both his Ien. and when his own
son was take in the same fawte / and all the cite came togider and prayde for
him yt the pain might be remytted. a while he repugnyd / at last he was victe
and overcome with the supplicacyon of the people. But that notwithstondinge he
put oon of his own Ien first out / and after oon of his sonnys Ien / and so he
gave a meruelows temperament to equity. For he reseruyd to every of them both
use of seeing and executyd dew justice / and showed him self both rightwys and
merciful. also Valery tellyth of oon called Carandius Tirius which made a law
/ that whosoeuyr entrid among any company of people with a sword or a dagger
about him should dye. And within a while aftir / when he was come home from
far contreys / he came in to his own hows with his sword about him. And when
he was warnyd of oone that stood bye him of brekynge of the law / even strayte
he pluckyd owte his sword / and killed him self. For he would not defend his
errowre nor dyssymyle / but rather suffer pain then break the law. Also
valerye tellythe libro sexto / that when a judge had geuyn false judgment upon
a time king Cambizes cawsyd him to be flaynt / and his skin to be set fast
upon the judicial sete / and cawsyd his son to sit and give iugementis in
the same sete aftir the death of his fader. And so he ordained by this new
pain that no judge aftyrwarde durst break the law / nor be corupte peruertynge
rightwysnes. For so commawndith the law of God / as it is written Deutero.xvi.
Ordeyne two iugis and rulers in every place / to judge the people rightfully /
and se yt they varye not from equite in to noon other way / for love nor for
dread / but do rightfully and indifferentlye at al times to every person.

Of a beast called Satirus / which weddyd a wife. Dialogo.xc*


AS it is said in Catholycon Satyrus comyth of satur saturi penultima corepta.
These Satiri be called homuncyones ab vncis naribus / and they have hornys in
there forhedys / and in there fete they be like unto gootes and such oone saint
Antony saw in wilderness / and asked what he was and he answered and said. I
am mortal and an occupier of this wilderness. And there be also diverse other
which gentyles worship deludyd with diverse errowre. And they call them.
Fawnos and Satyros. And this Satyrus is a monstruows best berynge in the upper
partis the likeness of a man. and in the netherpartys he is like a goote / and
he is called the God of wyldernes and wodys. This monstre weddyd a wife the
dowghter of hippocentauri / which is a man myxte strong and mighty. And when
he should goo to bed and lodge with his wife. First he warnyd her of three
things / and said / Make never no lesynges to me. Rebuke me not. Nor vyolate
notte my bed. If thowe keep these three / thou shall continewe with me in
great rest and peace. Within a short space aftir this Satyrus thowghte to
prove his wife if she were obedyent and said. O wife tell me the namys of thy
progenytowrs. To who^ she said. I had never noon. And Satirus said with
sadness and mowrninge. Thou have sone forgotyn my techinge. and she being bold
of her kynrede and friends began to blaspheme her husbonde / Wherefore he for
soke her and departed her from his bed. And not long aftyr she suffirde an
Ass to defyle her. And when her husbonde Satyrus knew that he iugyd her to be
done to death with all that longid to her / and in her dyinge she made great moan
and took repentawnce and said.

Most comendable thing is for women to obaye.
To there weddyd husbondes by night and by day.
But oftyntymes women be inobedyent. But ye soueraynte becomyth them not / for
Ecclesiast. says, xxv. If a woman have the superiorite she is contrary to her
husbonde / and also he says.xxi. It is bettyr to dwell in a deserte contraye /
than with a striuynge woman and angrye. A man there was on a time that had a
shrewe to his wife / and inobedyent / and he chastised her and made simulacyon
that he would goo to ye markette and said to his wife / in any wise I charge
the put not thy finger in that hoole / and he went and hyd him in the next
hows. and his wife began to think why has he fordoden me that. I will neuyr
be somoche obedyent unto him / and with great haste she ran to the hoole and
thrustein all her hand And the hole was full of sharp nails / and rents her
fyngers / and for great pain she cried owte in somoche that her husbonde
herd it / and came ronnynge and said. Why wylt not thou obey my
commaundementis / and so he served her diverse times in that and other thing /
tell she was feign to obey. In a great tempeste and horrible wedder in the sea the shipmen cried and commaundid to cast owte the heuyest things in the sea. And there was a man in the ship having his wife with him / which was the
grettest shrewe of her tongue yt cowde be. Wherefore her husbonde brought her to
the shipman and said that in all the ship was not so greuows a thing / and
heavy as her tongue. Wherefore Seneca says. As nothing is more commendable then
a good wife. So is nothing more cruel than a trowblows woman. And the
Philosofre says. A wife is other perpetual joy / or an endless pain. If she
be badde she cawsith much trowble / and much gladness if she be good. For
good wyuys be obedyent ever to there husbondes / and love them above all erthly
things Jerome in his book that he wrytteth again Iouynyan puttyth an Exemple
of three Matronys of Rome. The which when they had lost there husbondes / they
would never take moo. The first of them was named Marcya Cathonis / and when
she was asked why she would not take an other husbonde. She answerde that she
cowde find noman / that would love her for her self but rather for her goods /
for parauenture she was not fair / but she was rich. The secownde was Called
Valeria / and when inquysicion was made of her / for what cawse she took notte
the secownde husbonde / she said she might not / for her first husbonde was
leuynge in her daily remembrance / and euyr should be duringe her life. The
thryd hight Anna / and she was greatly mouyd by her friends to be sacryd to the
secounde husbonde / forasmoche as she was both young and rich she denied hit /
and said / she might not. For she before had a goodeman / and if she should
take an other / she said truly that he should be either good or badde If he
were good / she should euyr be in fere to lose him. If he were badde / she
should euyr be in sorrow that aftyr a good man she had my sped and fownde a
badde.

Of the Dromedarye and of his labowre. Dialogo.xci.


DRomedarius is a beast as says Jerome / that will goo as far in oone day
/ as an horse will in three. The Lion called this beast to him / and said.
Among all bestis / to me thou art most lawdable. For thou can well run
and lepe. Wherefore I will that thou go in to the east and inquere of a person /
of the qualyte and company of the Gryfon / the which will fight with me as I
understand. Whereof bring me word lyghtlye that I may make me redyeto batell.
And thou shall be rewardyd aftyr thy labowre both with goods and worship.
The Dromedary began to exalte him self / when he hard him self thus praysyd /
and took on him his Journey / and trustyng to get more lawde he ran and
labowrid owte of mesure / and more then his strength might attain to. And for
hope of reward he ran so fast and lept that he destroyed him self /
wherefore he fell and gave up the ghost and said.

Such labowre as we know / so let us fulfill.
That be excess owre self we not spyll.
ANd so we should discretely do the things that we can and know / that we
hurt not owre bodies / nor destroy owre tymmes / For saint augustyn says in
his rule. He that tourmentith his body excessyflye / sleith his neybowre / For
truly than a man kylleth his neybowre / that is his own body. when he vexyth
it and punysshith it more then he may bear. wherefore Isidor says in every deed
owith temperaunce and mesure to be had / for what souer is done with
temperaunce and mesure is wholesome. and all that is done ouermoch and withowt
mesure is noyows. There is a fable told that a Philosofre with his son was in
a tower stondynge alone in the sea / and his son was Tedyows of being there
/ and prayde his fader to ordain some mean that he might go thense / and be
delivered from that captivity / and he fownde there many fedirs of diverse
birds / and he set them togider with pyt the and glewe / and made a peyre of
wings / for him self / and an other for his son. So that they with there
wings should fly and come owte. and among all other the fader said to his
son. Beware thou fly not to high. Nor descend not to low / but keep a
mean if thou desire to be blessid. For aracyows and blessed people keep a
menewaye / and the fadir did so / and escapid owte of prison the right way /
and was sauf. Then his son understanding that he might fly / was very
glad and euyr ascendid upward / and the hete of ye son dissoluyed the glewe
/ and brent the fedirs and consumyd them / and so he fell and dyed. wherefore
Barnard says / keep the in a mean if thou will not lose manner.

Of the lion that bylded an Abbay Dialogo.xcii.


AN excellent Abbaye bylded the lion for the redempcyon of his own soul and of
his friends / in the which he or deyned many beastis to be under rule / and
gave to the^ a rule and a form of living / and made Eleccyon of a priowre
and he was the Fawn / which is the son of the heart / as says papye / and
he is diverse of Colowre / and the Lion believed that he would be a good and a
relygyows cloysterer. Hi^nulus this Fawn was variable both in colowre and
co^dicions. For he set his bredren at dyuysion / and cawsyd them to take
parties / and ordained officers / and with in a while dischargid them / and
ordeynyd other. And they that were put owte of office grutchid again him and
the other held with him. and thus he did oftyntymes malycyouslye. In somoche /
that all they conspirid again him / and were again him all hoole. at last ye
bredren armyd them self / willing to fight for there quarrel. But a sad
palfray which was old and wise and had been long there spoke and said. Cece
Bredren / for it is not good to strive or fight. yet is it bettir to void
this wicked pryowre / and to install an other that is pesible. These woordis
pleasyd among the bredren and all they with oon consent put him down and said
thus.

Concord and love is ever to be hold.
among bredren specially that partayn to oon foolde
By this it aperith yt concord is an acceptable virtue / among bredren as it
is written. Eccle.xxv. In three things there is great pleasur to my mind / which
be approbable before God and man. Concord of bredren / love of neybowres / and
man and wife well agreinge togider. For as saint Augustine says. He in nowise
may have concord with christ nor with him self / yt will have discord with a
christian man. But there be some that cannotte live while they be in peace. As
there was a fissher that trowblyd the watyr / and they that stood by rebukyd
him / and he answerde and said. If this watir be not trowblyd I cannot live.
There is nothing more profitable to a cite / than concord / as oon says. And
therefore it is good to desire to have concord / and amyte. Wherefore Valery
tellyth of concord libro quarto that when Hanyball bese gyd a cite / the
people of the cite suffirde so great Need / that they en^yed oon again an
other / and would not sell that was needful to sustentacyon of life / and in
that same cite oon sold bread / and dyed for honger. And an other that bought
it leuyd but a while therewith. And this great mysery fell of discord among
hem self. And therefore discord is ever to be lest.

Of a beast called Onocentaurus that bylded a Palace. Dialogo.xciii.
Diverse monstres there be / and among al other Onocentaurus is oon / which is
an ass myxte with man / so named for he berith the likeness of man in half
his body / and in the other half he has the shappe of an ass as says
Hugucyo. This beast for his own pleasure cawsid a royal pa^lays to be made /
but trustinge in his own wit he would begin it. Ordeyne it / and end it /
without counsel of the cheef workmastir. And also oftyntymes wha^ his conning
workman gave him profitable counsel for the great well of the work as he
understood by his conynge. This proud beast took no respect to him but
said. I am ingeniows and witty I nowgh / it becomith not you to teache me. But
I will have all thing perfourmyd aftyr mine own mind. And when the palace was
fynyshed and complete / for lack of good fundary on and wisdom / it was
ruynows / and fell shorteey to the grownde. And therefore Onocen taurns was
utterly confused and spoylyd of all his goods / and said with great
heaviness.

That man him self sone destroys.
Which to no doctrine his mind applies
SO many oone will not give credence to the consell of wisemen. But dispose all
thing after there own mind. But look that thou believe not always to thyn own
conynge. Nor trust to thyn own wit. Nor always follow thyn own will / but
do all thing with counsel / and by the advice of prudent men and discrete
and be thou aplyable to follow there doctrine / yt thou err not from the way
of trowth. For it is said Sapience.xxxi. Do thou nothing withowt cownsell /
and thou shall not repent aftir the deed. For the wiseman says.
Prouerbi.xiii. He that is ware doith all thing by counsel / and they that so
do be gidyd wiselye. And this is the difference between wysemen and folys. For
a fool beholdith but oonly the beginning of his workys / but a wiseman takyth
head to the end / and to such things as pertayne thereto. It is read of a
philosofre that sitting in the Markette in the most opyn place he said he
would sell wisdom. and when diverse came to him to bye it. He wrote in a
scrowe these words saying / in all things that thou intendiste to do /
evermore think what may be fall to the there bye. and many folks derided the
sentence and would have cast away the scrowe. But he conseylyd them to keep it
/ and bear it with them to there lordys sauf affermynge yt it was worth much
good. and when the prince of the land had receuyd it. He causid it to be
written with litters of gold upon ye dorris and gatis of his place. a long
space aftir it fortunid yt the princes enimys ordained to destroy him by the
meanys of his barbowr / and as this barboure entrid by ye gate and red this
scripture and understood it / he began suddenly to quake / and wax pale for
dread yt seeing ye prince causid him to be take / and with threting and
tourme^tis co^pellid hi^ to confess ye troth / and aftirward sparid hi^* but
al ye first imaginers of yt treson he causid to be slain / and put them to
death. Wherefore a philosofre says. What so ever thou do / do it wisely / and
behold the end.

Of a beast called rynoceron which despised agid folk. Dialogo.xciiii.


BRito writes* Rinoceron is interpretate in Lateyne / Horn in the Nose. The
same is Rinoceres that is an unicorn / for cawse that he berith oon horn in
the mids of his forhede of four ^ote long / so sharp and strong that
whatsoever he smyteth he berith it down and thyrlyth it. And he fightyth with
the Elephant and wondith him in the belly and ouerthrowith him. And he is of so
great strength that be no meanys of hunting he can be take. But as they say
that have written the naturis of beastis. A fair maid is ordained and
putforth again him. Which opens her bosom to him. Where in he puts his
hide and forgeteth his wildenesse / and fallyth in sleep / and so he is takyn
like a man withowt harneys. as says Isidore Ethim.xii. Rinoceron also as says
Papye is a beast having an horn in his nose. And he also says that
Rinoceron is a wild best of indomitable kind in somoche that though he be
takyn he cannot be kept by vyolence. This beast for his strength and lustye
inuentye might not behold nor look on agid folk. For when so ever that he
beheld any agyd people / he skornyd them seeing them crokyd and impotent. Of
very derision he showed them his fete and cleys. And when his Time was wastid /
and he him self was wax agid / young men despised him / and he pacyentlye
suffirde and said in this manner.

He that desires old for to be.
May not despise age / in nomanere of gre.
By this it aperith that old men should notte be despised of yongmen but
rather worshypped. Of this we have a comandment leu.xix. Before an horchede
remeue thou and arise. And worship thou the person of an old man. And alsoo
it is written Petri quinto. Ionge men be ye subject unto agyd men and Caton
says. Give rome to thy bettyr. For as Valery tellyth libro quinto Capite
secundo / of alexander which deseruyd the most principal honowre / and love of
all his knights through his great curtesy and buxomnes. as he tellyth in that
same place that upon a time when alexander behyld an agid knight was called
Macedone oppressyd with a tempest of snow / he descendid from his sete lyghtlye
and brought him up him self / and set him by the fire in his own sete. also
valery tellyth that when these birds called Ciconie wax old / there chekins
bear them to there nestis and lay them self about them / and feed them and
norysh them / and keep them warm / much rather owith men that be reasonable /
so to do to there senyowrs and friends. Moreover Valery tellyth libro quinto.
That when a noble woman was comytted unto ward / for a great offense / and
there should have perisshed through hongir. Her own dowghter that was weddyd
by the license of the judge visited her daily / but first she was serchyd with
great dylygence / that she should bear with her no mete. But she daily
drough out her brestis and fed her modir with her own milk. At last the judge
mouyd with great pyete / gave the modir to the daughter And a like tale is
told of an agid man that was sustained in all things by his daughter.
Vulturys otherwise called in Englyssh grypes. They be unkind. for they suffer
there progenitouris to dye for need / and they will not socowre them. So manyon
be unkind to there own fadirs and modirs / and other of there good friends /
and the more is there charger

Of a best called Orix that was long withowte sykenesse. Dialogo.xcv.
AS Brito wytnessith and other Autours also / Orix is a beast in the wilderness
/ like to a got / of whom the here is reflexyd / and tournith forward
contrary to the kind of all other beastis. and some say that it is a
watirmows / and when he is takyn / he is cast out in pathis and ways. and some
other has opinion that it is a beast like a mows that we call Glirem / in
lateyn as says Isidore. And this Orix is a clean beast as towchinge to mete /
but not to sacrifice. This beast Orix / leuinge long in most health of
body.in somoche that he was neuir syke / and therefore he scornyd and derided
syke folk when they gronyd / and thus he said. These people faynyth to show
great sufferance of pain / to have ease bodylye. And to esche we true labor.
and thus saying he was never service able to them yt were syke / and in
langowre. and at the last he was smyten with a feuyr and became very syke.
wherefore he began to weep and wayle saying. Alas what shall I do. I have not
mynystirde to syke solke but diffamyd them to my power. but now yt I am thus
castigate with sykenes. I promise to god / yt and if he discharge me of this
great disease / I shall euir gladly serve to syke folk and unwieldy. and when
god had sent him health and he was recoueryd in ye most glad wise he served to
sike folk and said.

God visitith us here daily with sykenesse and disease
For owr own profit that we should him please
HEre we may evidently know that infirmite is sent to us of God / For our
well and goostely strength of our soulys / as says the apostel / secunda ad
corinth.xii. When I am syke / that is to say bodily. Than am I more strong
and mighty goostly / that is to mean. For virtue is perfourmyd in sykenesse.
and Gregory says. Bodylye sykenes is kepar of all virtue and it is read in
vitis patrum that a sertayne person desired of Johan the Heremyte to be made
hole of the feuyr tercyan. and he answerde. Thou desire to be delivered of a
thing most necessary to the. For as the bodies be curyd by medecynes. So be
goostelye langours purified by sykenes and castigacyons / (...) when a knight
upon a time prayde an holy man yt by his holy prayers he might be delyueryd
from a great disease that he had / and told him more over that he was more
virtuously disposid and more devout in sikenesse then in health. The holy man
answerde and said in this manner. I pray God keep the in the same state / yt
thou may best please Godde and be most meke and vertuows.

Of the Common Laborer. Dialogo.xcvi.
Upon a time there was a common laborer that eryd a field intendinge to sowit.
But the oxen eryd not so well / as they were wonde to do / but wyncyd and made
recalcitracyon with all there power. wherefore the plouman beat them and pricked
them sore. The oxen cried out again him and said. Thou cursyd ceeature why
betyst thou us that ever have been serviceable to the. To whom he said. I
desire to ere up this fylde to maynteyne both me and you / and ye list not
to labowre. The oxen answerde. We will not ere this field / for the pasture is
good and it fedith us delycyowslye / and therefore we shall resist to owr
powris. But forasmoche as they were fast yockyd togidir / and might not
depart / the husbondman punysshed them with prickynge and sore strokys / and
so they were feign to obey with humylyte / and said.

Bettyr it is for love / good service to do.
than for dread thanklesse be compellyd thereto.
ANd therefore we that be creaturis induyd with reason / should serve charitably
when we owe to serve / and wilfully also / and not constrained. For coact
service plesith not to Godde. Wherefore saint Augustyn says. Constrained no man
can do well thowghe it be good that he does. Crisostome says. The good will
cawsith the deed to be remunerable / and without good intencyon the deed is not
alowable. And Isidore says. Such shall thy deed be reputyd / as thyn intent
has been precedynge. as it is read of a iogular that cowde well Tabowre. And
he was seen in his Cellta bowringe and doing worship to God. And there were
seen abowte him four aungellys / with four Tapirs stondinge and assistinge
him / for his good mind that he had to the honowre of almighty god.

Of the Ape that wrote books. Dialogo.xcvii.


AN Ape there was dwellinge in a good cite / that wrote very Fair / and made
diverse books. But he gave neuir his mind / to such things / as he wrote /
but talkyd with other folks or harkenyd what was said of the^ For the which
cawse he falsified his bookys oftyntymes. Wrytinge in them the words that he
spoke him self. Or that he hard spokyn of othermen. And so he continuyd and
would neuyr amend nor correct his fawt. wherefore noman would set hi^ to work /
and so he had no getynge and came to great pouerte and said

The writer that writes all the long day
Deseruith no reward / if his mind be away.
SO and in likewise when we intend to sing or pray. we owe to inprinte owre
prayers and song^ in our minds steadfastly. For it auaylyth but little or
nothing to singe or say without deuocyo^ and applicacyon of ye mind. ye
apostel says ephe.v. Sige ye in your hartys to god / yt is to say. Not only
with voice outwardly but inwardly in your minds / yt we may say with ye said
apostel i. corin.xiiii. I shall singe both with spirit and mind. Seneca says.
I sing and say whersoeuer I be. Thus did Philosofirs yt intendid to show and
to find prudence. Wherefore it is but vain labor to write yt great study of
the^ in laboring for wysdom. For there mighty stodies and labowrs apere by there
wise techinges and doctrines. Of whose Valery tellith li.viii. and says yt
Carneades an old knight and besy and coninge / wha^ he was passid xc. yeris /
he had so meruelously spent his time in stody for conyng yt diverse times as sat
at table for cause of refecyo^ / he forgate to put his hand to ye table / his
mind was so besyly occupied in remembrance of coning. Valery tellith of
archimede a philos. yt wha^ his cite siracusana was takyn. Marcellus commaundid
that he should not be slain / and he stood and his Ien defixed in the grownde
/ and made diverse figures / Fourmys and serclys / and to a knight coming to
him and holdinge a sharp sword ouyr his head and askyng what he was For the
great apetyte and desire of conynge / that was in him he gave noon answer. nor
told him his name* But when he had made many serclys and figuris in the duste
/ he said to the knighte. I pray the trowble not this sercle nor hurt it.
and they took him for a contemptowre of the Empire / and neglygente / and so
they killed him cruellye with the sword of the knight that was victowre.

Of a beast called Cameliopardus Dialogo.xcviii.


Cameliopardus is a beast of Ethiope as says Isidore libro duodecynto and
Plinius libro octauo capit. decimonono says that this beast has an head like
a Camel / and he is neckyd like an horse / and his thighs and fete be like an
ox / and he has spottys like a parde. This Camelyopardus is a beast
ouerspraynyd with white spottis dyuydinge the other fressh colowres that he is
^lorisshed with. And this beast semyth more dowtfull than he is / for he
semyth sometime so tame that well nyghe he may be called ashepe / as says the
for said outowre. This beast was a paynturefull of conning But he of malice
ever faynyd criste to be monstruows to be auengid again him. Wherefore manyone
despisid Criste and set little by him saying. How should he help and socowre
us / that has nether fauowre nor beauty. Upon a time this beast this
Cameliopardus staynyd the Image of Christ in an high place / and aftyr his
power shewid him to be monstruows and despisable. Wherefore Christ was
pertourbyd / and aperyd to him and said. Why doyste thou so presomptuowslye
defile me shewinge me to be monstruows / when I am fair and beawtyfull /
excellynge the beawte of all creaturis. For aungellys desire to behold me and
my beautye. and thou labowrist to stele a way my beawte and worship. To whom
this beast answerde and said Thinkyst thou not that I remember that thou
haste made me monstruows and not beawtifull nor fair. And therefore now I
shall venge me upon the and neuyr spare to the. And Criste was displeased
greatly with him / and as he was payntynge and high upon a scafolde / he
ouirthrewe him and cast him down bacwarde and said.

He has wrought vengeannce in a strange form
That on him self the stroke does return.
SO manyon be byttir and hard hartyd / that neuir will forgive iniuryes and
wrongis done to them / but euir a wait to be auengid / wherefore it is said
eccles.xxviii. He that will be auengid / shall find vengeance of Ged. and
therefore Seneca says. We should forgive and forgete injuries. For a great
remedy of wrongs is sorgetfulnes. Princes in the old time were very buxome
and gentle in geuynge rewardys to such as deseruyd them / and in remittinge
offencis to their enymes. whereof Valery tellyth libro vi. of a consul of Rome
called Camillus the which when he had upon a time besegid Faliscos. The mastir
of the game led all the most noble children of the faliscons by a train in
to the castellys of the Romans. wherefore it was vndowtyd that they should be
feign to yield them self to the Emperowre / But this Camillus was not pleasid
with the treason / but utterly despised it and commaundid that the said
children should led there forsayde mastir fast manaclyd and cheynyd and
greuouslye betyn with toddys with them home to there friends to dispose him at
there pleasure. With this great benefices and kyndnes / the minds of the
Falyscons were mollyfyed / and so they opynyd the gatis to the Romans Ambrose
also tellyth in summa de officio in cronicis Romanorum. That when a phisicien
of pirrethe king of epirotarum had come to fabryce that besegid a great cite /
called Tarentus of the said kings. The foresaid Phisicien told to Fabrice
that he would give unto the king a medecyne intoxicate / by the which he
should dye / and by this meanys Fabricius should be victoriews / but he this
heringe abhorryd the treason / and co^mawndid him to be fast bownde and carried
to his king to be punyshed. wherefore ambrose says. Verily ye ma^hode and
clarite of him is to be lawdyd. For he yt has enterprised a batell of knyghtly
courage and virtue / would in nowyse obtain frawdelent victory. The forsayde
king pirrus this under stondinge said in commendacyon of Fabrice. This is the
Fabricius that is so noble / which is more hard to be removed from rightwisnes
/ than the son to be auertyd and changid from his course / and so the king
fell at composicion with him yt he had his pleasure. Valery tellith
lib.v.cap.i. That when ye legatis of cartage were come to ye cite of Rome to
redeem there prisoners yt were there in captivity / immediately without taryinge
there were delivered to the^ yongmen yt were prisoners to the no nombyr of
MMCCC. XL. and all they were delivered without money or tribute. whereof great
marvel may be conceyuyd / to se so great nombre of enymyes delyueryd freely /
so great goods forsakyn / and marcye showed to so many in iuries. also Valery
tellyth. li.vi.ca.v. yt wha^ pribarnacium a prince was takyn by ye romans /
and diverse of his people slain and many imprisonid and there was no refuge to
the^ / but only by supplicacio^. A question was asked to ye prince / what pain
he and his people had deseruyd. He answerde. Such pain as they deserve yt be
worthy to have lyberte. and wha^ it was demandid of him again what peace ye
romans should have with him and his if they remytted there offense and suffird
the^ to depart unpunished. He said. If ye give to us good peace. ye shall have
peace for euir. If ye give to us bad peace / ye shall not long have peace. By
the which answer he obtaynid not only relaxacion / but also he had a great been
fitz grantyd to hi and his of the cite of Rome. For they were made and admittid
cytezyns of ye same cite of rome.

Of a bird called Laurus that occupied shypmannys Craste. Dialogo.xcix.


IN the watyr as well as on the Land is a bird / and is named Laurus / And he
both flies and swimmeth / as says the gloss Deuterono.xiiii. He flies like
an Egle / and swymmith like a fissh And is but a lytyl bird and black / and
Fat. And bydith euyr nyghe watirs / and he may not fly far. Wherefore
oftyntimes men that be swyst run aftir them and catch them. And of this
bird it is written in aurora Laurus is a dweller of the watirs. and
inhabitator of the lands. This Laurus was a shipman the grettest that cowde
be. But ever he ouerchargid his ship trustinge to his conynge. And many times
his friends rebukyd him therefore / but nevertheless he amendyd him not but
occupied so still for couetyse of lucre. and upon a time he fraughte his
ship excedinglye with diverse marchaundise in somoche that he cowde not gyde
it for the great burdon and the trowblows waluys and therefore the ship sanke
to ye botome and was brownyd. and so this Laurus was utterly undone and made
great heaviness and said in this manner.

He that couetith suddenly great richesse to have.
May fortune to lose much / and scante him self save
MArchauntis should take heed hereto / and not to be desirows of hasty
wynnynges / to be suddenly made rich with great parell / but surely to increce
to goods with moderacyon. For Bernarde says. I will not suddenly be made
gretteste but I will profit and encreace moderatly fro little unto more. There
was a chorle that had an hen / the which laid every day an egg / and so he
gadryd many and sold them and encrecyd to his advantage. and at last he
thowghte if this hen were killed and opened he should have many eggis in her.
and for cawse that he was inordinatly couetowse / and would have had great
lucre at oonis / he cawsid the hen to be slain / and departed in twain and
fownde noon eggis in her / but lost all / both hen and eggis / aftir the
commune proverb that says. He that couetith all / oftyntymes lesith much.
Therefore marchauntis and chapmen owe to be ware to get any thing wrongfully.
For the gods of unjust men shall sone be destroyed / aftir the opinion of the
philosofre yt says. Richesse lightly gotyn may not last long. also
Prouer.xx. Heritage or lyuelode that is hastyly pourchessyd in the beginning /
shall lack blessinge in the endinge. When a Marchaunte in the sea upon a time
had sold his wine which was myxte half with watyr / for as much money as
though it had be pure wine and when he opened the bag to put in the money
that he had receyuyd for the myxte wine. an Ape that was in the ship espied
it / and in secret wise came and cawghte the lagge with the money / and fled
to the ankyr and sittinge there upon / she opened the bag and threw oone
penny in to the sea / an other in to the ship / and so she continuyd tell she
had cast them out every penye. In somoche that the marchante had noon avail
by his frawde.

Of the lion how he was an hunter. Dialogo. C.


A Lion there was sometime that was a famowse honter / and ever this was his
customable usage. When he hontyd he would sadly behold all ye beastis before
him / and mark surely oone of the best / and him pursewe with all his might.
But the beast being in good distaunce and remote from the lion. Fled in
all haste possible. Wherefore the lion was greuyd lacking of his purpose and
faylynge of that he hopyd to have. And than he labowrid to have of the other
beasts that he had first forsakyn. But he cowdnoon obtain. For they were goo
and fled and hid them in there couertys. wherewith the Lion was angirde so
bytterlye / that he would never aftyr hunte more / but said with great
wodenesse.

It is a great madness the suretye forsake
Of thing that is sertayne / and the contrary take.
SO manyon when they may have ye thingis yt be competent for the^. they take
noon head thereto.couetinge to have bettyr / and therefore they be oftyn deceyuid
/ and cannot com to possessid of such thingis as they in time past might have
had. then they would take yt they may not com by / and recouir yt is lost and
vnrecouirable. But they prevail not but seldom. wherefore they mourn and be in
great heuinesse. again who^ david spekith.ii. re.xii Now yt he is deed why do I
fast whethir I may call hi^ again / I shall rather go to hi^. For he shall never
return to me. It is also told in fablys that ye Nyghtingale taught a yongma^
yt had takin her to mourn not to gretely for a thing lost yt cowde not be
recouerid as it is read in balaam / it is but a madness and parell to forsake
a thing sure and sertayne / for an other thing vain and uncertain / as
Isope she with by example that there was a dog went over a brigge and bare a
peace of flessh in his mowth / and when he espied the shadow in the watyr / he
forsook the flessh that he had in his mouth to kache the flessh that aperyd in
the watyr. And therefore he lost it. So do manyon that for couetyse of getynge
/ forsake there sure possession / to obtain yt they have not / nor never can
have. Wherefore Isope says Things certain owe not to be forsakyn for vanyteys
For as it is but madness to trust tomoche in surete / so is it but folly to
hope tomoche of vanyteys / for vain be all erthly things longing to men / as
says Dauyd psalm.xciiii. Whereof it is told in fablys that a lady upon a time
delivered to her maiden a Galon of milk to sell at a cite / and by the way as
she sat and restid her by a dyche side / she began to think yt with ye money
of the milk she would bye an hen / the which should bring forth chekyns /
and when they were grawyn to hennys she would sell them and by piggis / and
eschaunge them in to sheep / and the sheep in to oxen / and so when she was
come to richesse she should be married right worshipfully unto some worthy man /
and thus she reioycid. And when she was thus meruelously co^fortid and
rauisshed inwardely in her secret solace thinking with how great joy she
should be led toward the church / with her husbond on horseback / she said
to her self. Goo we / goo we / sodaynlye she smote the ground with her foot /
minding to spur the horse / but her foot slypped and she fell in the dyche /
and there lay all her milk / and so she was far from her purpose / and
never had that she hopid to have.

Of a beast called Tragelaphus that was a False byldar. Dialogo.ci.


TRagelaphus that is a beast of a got and a heart as says brito / and it is
a nown compounde of tragos that is a goote / and laph^s (...) is an heart /
which beast though he be of the similitude of an heart in somparte.
Nevertheless he has rowgh herys like a goote behind / and a barbydde chynne
/ and hornis he has also like an heart and full of braunchis. This beast was
a principal workman and a great deuisar in byldinges. But he was a false
disceyuar / and begilyd many folks. For when he should give cownsell for
diverse edificacions to be made. He would ordeyne such fundacyon that ye
byldinge should sone fall / and to him self he would say Hit forsith not to me
thowgh it fall. For I shall have the more adauntage in Reedificacion of such
workys and thus his badde cownsell was robbery to every man that medlyd with
him. among all other in that country there was a mighty tyraunte willing to
bylde a meruelows paleys / for him self. And for to have it perfourmyd / he
sent for this hedemastir / and delyueryd to him money innumerable / for the
construccyon of the Palace. This cheef workmastir laid a badde fundacion like
as he had vsto before time / in somoche that when the work was finisshed / the
wallys departed / and Claue a sonder in the mids / and all the hoole work
began to synke. The Ciraunt that seeing was sore agreuyd and cited the
archemastir and said unto him. Why haste thou deceyuyd me thou cursyd wretch.
To whom he answerde and said. I was disseyu^d when I said the fundacion / but
now it behouith to bear down this work and make a bettyr fundacion This
tyraunte was wode that so great a cost was (...) lost / and cawghte him and
threw him down from the loppe of the palace / and destroyde him / and said.

For cownsell geuynge that is not good.
Manyone lesith and is in heavy mood.
Therefore be thou ware to give false consell and wicked. For many times it
happith that they which give false Counsel fall in great trowble and myscheef
/ as it is written eccle.xxvii. To the gyuer of wicked counsel all myscheef
shall happyn / and he shall not know how it comith to him. As Orosius testith
/ that when a Tyraunte upon a time had dampnyd many innocentis. A goldsmyth
that was namid Pimis willing to please the said Tiraunte / made a great bull
of brass having a durre in oone of his sides by the which they that were
dampnyd might be put in to the said brasyn beast / and he gave it to the
said tyraunte / to the entente that he should include al them that he louyd not
and put fire under / and so in great pains they should cry / and make
great noise like oxen or other beastis. But this tyraunte abhorryd so cruel
a deed and said unto him / that he him self first should entir / that by him /
he might have experience / what noise he cowde make / other like an ox or
like a cow. And immediately he was put inn / and pwnysshede with deddely
pain / that he had ordeynyd for other.

Of a beast called Bubalus that was a shomaker. Dialogo.cii.


Unto an ox there is a beast right like and is named Bubalus. So vntame that
for wyldnesse he will bear no yocke in his neck. Africa norisshith and
bringith forth these beastis. In germany also be wild oxen having hornis of
so great length / that they be set with drink upon the kings table / for
there great capacite / as says Isidore. and it is a beast of great strength /
wherefore he cannot be tamyd / but if an iron ringe be fastnyd in his nose / by
the which he may be led. and he is black or yelowe of colowre / and he has
but few herys or noon He has also a forehede of horn desensyd with tway
mighty hornis. And the flessh of him is profitable not oonly to mete / but also
to medecyne / as says Plinius lib.xxviii. Cap.x. This Bubalus was a shomaker
greatly named for his conninge which by his craft ^euyd honestlye / and
kept a great how sold. But aftir that when he had gotyn great goods by his
Craft he began to despise it and said. This is a foul craste and a hateful
/ for ever my hondes be black. I sit also continually in filth and turpitude /
lyckynge black ledir and shoone. But I will amend it / and be an apote carye
/ For then I shall be redolente and sweet. and when he was a spicer and should
occupy his craste / every man mockyd him / for he cowde no skyl thereon /
nether to bye nor sell. Wherefore with in short time all his goods ye he had
before gadryd / were consumyd and wastyd and he was fall in great pouertye and
made great heaviness and said.

Bettir it is in small crastis wisely to prevail.
Then to change symplye / and of leuinge to fail
EVery man therefore beware and considre his own state / and lightly not change.
For the Apostell says prima and corinth.vii. In such vocacyon as ye be called
continewe ye in the same. For Seneca says. a young tree or plaunte may not
grow / that is oftyn remeuyd. For perseueraunce is called a stable and
perpetual mansyon / ordeynyd well in reason. and as Tully writes primo
rethorice. The nobilite of man should dwell in this perseueraunce. That is to
say. Not to be brokyn with aduersiteis / nor to be exaltid with prosperiteys.
Nor to be feryd with comynacyons and thretingis. Nor also to be inclynyd or
bowyd from virtue by promise or adulacyo^s. For Seneca also says denaturalibus
questionibus libro tertio. And also as the expositor super boecium
deconsolatione says / that the philosofirs laid or cowchyd two Tonnes of wine
in the entrey of the hows of Iouys / and aftir the declaracyon of the said
expositor. The house betokenyth this world present / the two tonnys prosperity
and aduersite. Of which it behouith every creature to taste entringe in to this
world. Alexander might not overcome the constaunce and perseueraunce of
Diogenes. For when he came to him on a time sittinge in the son and bad him
desire what he would / and according to reason he should have it. This
Diogenes answerde with great stedfastnes and said. I would quod he before all
other things that thou keep not the son from / that is to mean / that thou
stand not between me and the son. and so hereof came a proverb. That
alexander attemptid to have put diogenem from his degree of stablenes / but it
was more esy to him to deprive king Dary from his Roall see / by force of
armis. and therefore says Seneca libro quinto de beneficiis that Diogenes was
much strenger and richer than alexander having all the world. For it was more
yt he freely refusyd / than ever ye other might give. and therefore that day
Alexander was victe for he found such a man to the which he cowde nothing
give nor take away. The old philosofirs dispysyd all temporal things / and
reputyd them to be vile and of no valowre. wherefore a Philosofre weppyd for he
saw men labowring and trauelynge with so great dylygence / abowte there
feeldis / vynes and how singes as though in them were perpetual bliss. An
other philosofer ever lawghid deludid / and scornyd men of the world for that
cawse yt there felycite restyd in flesshly delectacyon continually and inloue of
things transitorye of this mortal life. Wherefore it is written Iere. li.
Every man is a fool of his own conynge / and every man is confused of his
own sculptyle. Sculptile is called that thing which a man louyth best / and
settith most price bye in this world.

Of a steer that was a good Cook. Dialogo.ciii.


IVuencus is a young ox / when he is no longer a calf / and he is then called
a steer when he begins to be helpful unto the profit of man in eringe ye
earth. This iuuencus was a special good Coke / for he cowde make diverse good
dysshes and delicate. But his conning was much the less alowyd for he
ouersaltyd his mete / and destroyed it. Wherefore his lord called him before him
and said Why destroyest thou my mete that is so sumptuous / and delicate /
with unmeasurable salt. And this Coke answerde and said. I salt it well for
it sauowrith and relecith ye bettyr in my mouth. Seeing his mastir yt he would
not amend for his great glotonye he all to beat him and put him owte of his
service / and so he was expulsyd fro many good service / and at the last
for his insaciable glotonye / and inordinate apetyte of unmeasurable sauowre he
was kyllyd / and wretchydly dyed and said.

Many moo people / be glotonye is slain.
Then in batell or in fight or with other pain.
IN likewise many glotowns will nothing but that pleasith to them self and
such as they desire. And they that follow there own glotonows apetyte / be
like unclean beastis. Wherefore Seneca says. Obedyent people unto the belyes /
have the likeness of unclean beastis / and not of reasonable creaturis / but as
the gloss says. Not the mete but the foul apetyte causith ye sin. It is
greatly culpable to a christian man to worship his belly as a god / and for
concupisce^s and apetyt of glotony / to expulse and destroy ye vertewis of the
soul. For Galiene says. Concupiscens of metys by hurt to the soul and
cawsith goostly faintness. For truly how much any person is replete bodyly
with metys / so much more goostly is he mynysshed in vertewys. and ypocrates
says. The more largelye thou fedist thy corruptiblye body / the more thou
hurtist it. In france sometime was an abbotte the which daily was served
delicatly / and ete of the best / and richesse he lackyd noon. But he was euir
sike and cowde not be repayrid with medecynys. Wherefore he was in desperacyon
of his life / and took upon him the ordyr of cisterciense / in the which for
parcyte and scarceness of mete he amendid and was hole / and strong. Wherefore
Galiene says. abstynence is most excellent medecyne. and also it is written
ecclesia.xxxvi. He that is abstinent shall encrece his life. It is red that a
sertayn people called bragmaynes wrote unto alexander and said.it is unlawful
to us to have owr belyes straynyd with metys / and therefore we be without
sykenesse / and live long. We be very hole and have neuyr need of me decyne /
and these people desirid nothing of alexander sauf immortalite / which they
lackyd / and he cowde not give it to them. There was in owre days an agid man
which leuyd many yeris. and when it was asked of hi^ why he had so great health
and leuyd so long / he answerde and said. For I never rose fro Table so
replete that my belly was greuyd. Nor I never vsyd to be let blood. Nor I knew
never woman flesshly. For these three cawsis I have had health / and
contynuawnce of life.

Of a beast called Capreolus ye which vsyd to iogle. Dialogo.ciiii.


CApreolus such a beast there was sometime / that cowde most sotelly iogle. he
cowde also singe very well / dawnce also and talk plesauntly. Nevertheless he
was the more eschewyd of all people for that he occupied excedingly And
therefore he leuyd but pouerlye. And upon a time he went to the king and said.
My lord most sovereign ye know well that I am a conning iogular and pass
all other in your realm / but for all that I am not gladly hard in yowr
realm. nor rewardyd aftyr my conning. But few or noon can iowgle so crastely
as I can / and notwithstondinge they be take forth and largely rewardyd. Tell
me the cause. To whom the king answerde. As thou say thou can iowgle well
/ but this is thy fawte. Thou doyst al thing excessyflye both in doing and in
saying / Whereof the herars be fastydyows and werye. But and if thou will be
gladly hard. Stody thou to speak and to iowgle temperatly. This Capreolus did
aftir counsel / and was verily well amendyd in his goodis in short time aftyr
and leuyd meryly all his days and said.

Plays and desportys be acceptable and good.
Temperatly vsyd / and in a mean mood.
SO we owe to do such thingis as we know and can with temperaunce / that we
cawse not werynesse to the beholders / for Isidore says. All thing that is
ouermoche and without mesure done.cawsith werynesse / and a sertayn versisier
says. The words of them be not acceptable. That ever be talkinge for there
saynges be not stable. For the why stelynge byrder makyth merry song. and yet
the sely birds begylyth he among. A child asked a question of an old man and
said. Fadir is it bettir to speak or be still. to whom the old man spoke and
said. If the words be unprofitable leave them. If they be good. Differ not
long to speak them.it is written eccle.xxxii. young man make but little speech
in thyn own cawse. If thou be twyes interogate and asked a question / have thou
ready thyn answer in thy mind or thou speak. There as be senyowrs be thou not
verbose / and among agyd folk cast not out thy speech. In vitis patrum oon
made a question to an old man and said. How long shall I keep spilence. To
whom he said. Tell thou be spokyn to. In every place if thou be still thou
shall have rest / and keep thou scilence unto a time of conuenie^ce Temestides
a philosofre said to a chorle yt sat with hi^ ^^ dinner / and spoke not. Art
thou lernyd / me thinks so for thou spekist not. Therefore Isidore says.
When time requires speak thou / and in time be still / and speak not but if
thou be spokyn to first. and also here thou al thing patiently or thou speak /
and the question of an other more ever precede and cawse the to give a
reasonable answer.

Of the hare that was a lawyer. Dialogo.cv.


THe hare Lepus went to pareys to scole and was in process a good lawyer / and
therefore he went to the lion and said. My lord I have spent and consumyd my
goods in study and scolage / for conning and science. wherefore I pray you
that I may be well maynteyned and stypendyd / and live worshipfully under the
proteccyon and shadow of your wings. To who^ the lion answerde. I will first
make a proof of thy wysdom and conynge or I grante ye thy desire Go with me to
see diverse things that I may prove thy learning. and as they went by a wode
side there came an hunter having a bow and a^rowis / and ordeynyd to shoot
aftyr the bear and the fox. But the fox was wylye. And when she espied the
bow and the arowe she lepte a side and escapid fro the stroke. The bear was
proud and trustyd to his own strength and came hastily again the man willing
to teere him on pecys / but the hunter losyd his arowe and smote yt bear and
kylde him. This saying the lion said unto the hare. Make me a proverb of this
that I may know thy science. if thou desire to be admytted to my salarye. The
hare wrotte immedyatelye in his book / and said.

Again death it preuaylith much more among.
To have wisdom / than to be strong.
ANd the lion commendyd this proverb and led the hare with him / to a cite /
where they fownde a lord rebukynge his seruauntis. and oone of the seruauntis
took pacyentlye the rebukys of his mastir. The other was impacient and not
sufferable / but full of froward answers. Wherefore the Lord in his ire all to
beat him and spoylyd him and expulsyd him owte of service / and kept still the
pacyent and promotyd him to great worship. And of this matere ye hare wrote
to the lion saying in this wise.

Much bettyr it is many times to be still
Then to speak shrewdlye / and have iuyll will
THe Lion also magnifyed greatly this proverb and led the hare in to a
town. In the which they fownde a laborer yockynge his oxen / and assygnyd
them to there journey to ere.xii. acres of land and delivered for the fedinge
of every of them a botell of hay. Oon of these beasts went forth and bare his
botell of hay withowte grutchinge / and an other began to speak boldlye and
prowdly and said. What should hit suffice us to bear hay with us. He shall
not feed us so. and thus saying he would not carry hay to feed him self with
him. And when they came to there labor / and had eryd unto even he that had
the botell of hay refresshid him self. The other was werye and having
nothing whereof to be comfortyd for great hongre he dyed. Whereof the hare
wrote to the Lion saying in this wise.

Bettyr it is at need little thing to have.
Than utterly nothing that might the life save.
THe lion consyderinge all this / said unto the hare. Trewly son thou have
studied well / and lost no time in vain. For thou can answer wisely to
every question. Wherefore he gave him great wagis and promotyd him and said.

He that of honowre desires to have a chair.
Owith to be conning / and of very wisdom air.
STudyentis should take heed hereto / and continually apply them to have
conning / that they may be promotyd / For the mind of man ioyeth and is fed
with conning / and therefore it owith to have noon end / as Seneca says. Be
not faynte in learning / for life and learning should end at onys / and an
othyr says. If my foot were in my grave / yet would I gladly lern conning.
For conning and science is desirable both for it self and for other / for it
is very profitable to many things as says the expositor upon the first of
the ethikes. And that man is very blessed that has found wisdom / and
haboundith with prudence. Prouer.iii. Therefore old princes had there mastirs /
as traiana had plularchum. Nero had Scneca / and alexander had Aristotyll. When
Alexander was born philippe the fadir of him wrote an Epistle to aristotyl
saying in this wise. Philippe to aristotyll sendith gretinge. know thou that
a son is born to me / whereof greatly I reioy^r and refer gracys unto the
gods. Not oonly for cawse of his birth. But rather for that it fortunyth him
to be borne in thy time For my great confidence res^yth in the / trustinge that
thou shall bring him up in vertewe and doctrine / that he may be worthy to be
a gydar / and profitable to the well of or reame. And hit is to be notyd that a
prince of a reame owith to be wise / not oonly in disposinge of thing is
temporal and lawys of them. But also in dyuyne thingis and lawys of god as it
is written Deuteromii.xvii. Aftyr that a king have possession and is set in
the Trone of his ^^ame / he shall cawse the Deutronomye to write unto him of the
law in a volume / taking an example of the presris of the trybe Leuiticall /
and it shall Remain in his kepinge / and he shall read it all the days of his
life / that he may lern and have remembrance to drrbe his lord God and keep
the cerymonyes of hi^ which be commaundyd in the law. and if the prince be not
let tyrde. It is necessary to him to be counsellyd of such as be lernyd
wherefore he is commawndid to take an examplar of the law of preystis and men
of the church as Helinandus expownyth. Tully says in detusculanis
questionibus libro quinto. Philosofir is a serchar of the mind / which drawith
owte vicis by the rote / and purgith them / and makith ready ye sowlys to bring
forth good fruit. Papie says that academia / was sometime a town oftyn times
shakyn with earth quauys stondinge but a mile from athenys / which town
philosofirs that is to say plato and al his / chose to dwell inn / yt dread
should cawse them to be continent and to be doutefull euir / and eschew other
vices / and aplye there lernyge and of that town they were named Academici.

Of a Dog and many Woluys Dialogo.cvi.


A Dog which was a great barkar and enymye again woluys to fight again them
was keppid in a great cite / and he was so fierce that in nowise he would
suffir them to entyr ye cite. Wherefore the woluis hatid the dog and lay
daily waytinge to destroy him. and for that same intent they came togider in
to the feldys and sent forth two of the eldest of them inmessage to the dog
saying unto him. Thou art mighty and goodly strong and virtuous. and therefore
al we be assemblyd togider in ye feeldis to crown ye our king. come with us
peseablye and receive thy dignite that thou may be honowrably put in
possession. This dog was mad for joy when he hard him self thus lawdyd
and thoughee he should be exalcyd and departed from the courtelage in which he
had sure abiding and went forth with his enymyes to his coronacyon The woluys
conueyde the dog secretly to there own company / and when they espied him /
they fortified them self togider and all to rent the dog and said.

He that desires to be hardy and bold.
Should ever dwell still in a strong hold.
So a man yt dwellith in a strong place / owithe not to depart thens for
fair promi^ and flateringe words. For there be many deceyuers / decey^inge
the^ yt be not ware with sugryd words / wherefore Albartanus says. Thou shall
not dread byttyr words but rather great strokis. The Philosofre says. He
that wisely dissimulith / the sooner preuaylith again his enymye. and Isope
willing to show that a man owith prudently to consider why and for what cause
anythinge is promised or geuyn to him tellyth and inducith a fable and says
that on a time a thief came to a man^ys hows by night to rob him / and a
dog which was in yt same hows barkyd and made great noise. but ye thief was
subtle and pluckyd bread out of his bosom and gave it to ye dog to cawse
him / to be still. The dog refusyd the bread and said to the thief. By thy
gifts thou labowrist to cause me to be still / ye thou may rob and spoil
my mastir / If I should take thy bread / thou wol best exca^ye all the substance
of this house / and for this little morsel yt thou profirst me / I should lose
all my lyuinge. But I will not lose my continual and daily sustinaunce / for
thy false pleasure. And therefore I advise the to depart from hens wylfully /
or else I shall cry out again the and show thy theft. and all the while ye
dog was still the thief Tarried / and when he barkyd yt thees departed and
durst not tarry. Therefore an autour says. when any thing is geuyn the /
remembyr why. and to whom thou geuyft thy gifts have an Ie.

Of the Wolf and the Ass. Dialogo.cvii.


THe wolf on a time sawyd with the ass / but ye ass labowrid full truly
above. the wolf was malycyous and drew the saw vndernethese king an Occasyon
to deuowre the ass. wherefore he made quarrel again him and said. Why doyste
thou throw the duste in to mine Ien. the ass answerde / and said. I do not
so to the / but I govern the saw perfightly aftyr my wit and conning. If
thou wilt saw above I am pleasyd / and I shall labowre beneth truly. To whom
the wolf said I can nor. But and if thou throw any more duste in to mine Ien /
I shall put owte both thyn Ien. and they thus sawynge the wolf blewe with all
his power willing yt the duste should fly in to the Ien of his fellow / but
ye timber stoppid it / and cawsid the dust to fall in to the Ien of the wolf /
and he was grievously paynid and swear that he would ouirthrowe the portars and
berars. But the timber fell suddenly by the right full judgment of God and
oppressed the wolf and killed him. The ass lept and sauyd him self and said.

Manyone that thinkith his Neybowre to kill
Is slain with that same sword sore again his will
THus do malycyows people that layenettis to deceive there neybowris / and to
take them. But as it is written Eccle.xxvii. He that ordeynith a pit for his
Neybowre shall fall in to it him self / as Isope inducith a fable and shewith yt
he yt labowrith to disceyue other folks / god shall suffir him to be begilyd
and dampnyd / and forth he brings an example and says That on a time a mous
came to a great waterside / and durst not swym ouir / and a frogge espied him
/ and thought to deceive him / and said. Thou art welcome brodir and friend.
It is said that frendeship is prouyd in necessite. Wherefore come with me / for
I can swym right well. The mous trustid well and suffirde him self to be fast
bownde to the foot of ye Frogge and as they swam the frogge descendyd in to
the watir and drownyd the mous and killed her. and at the last there came a
kyte fleing ouir and espied the mows and caught her and the Frogge also and
ete them both. and therefore says Isope. So mote they perissh / yt will speak
fair and deceive / for it is worthy that punysshment return to him that
causith it.

Of the bear and the wolf. Dialogo.cviii


Upon a time the bear called the wolf to him and said. We twain be had in
great reputacion and have a great name emonge all other wild beastis. But
and if we take owr lodging togider and lie in oone mansion nyghtlye / we shall
be more louyd and dredde of them all then webe. These words pleasid unto the
wolf and they made compenye and dwelled togidrr. The bear gave informacion to
the wolf and said. I will continewe gladlye with the in somer for thou shalt
feed me with such vytayle as thou may get by thy hunting. And I shall
cherissh the in my Cell / for I am very well purueyde in the winter. I will not
that thou shall be withowte in the winter in the froste and the cold. But
rather co^tinew with me in my cave and make good chere The wolf beleuid well /
and with all his dilygence day he went an huntinge to feed him self and the
bear. The bear lyuyd myrylye withowte labowre. And when the wolf came to his
Cell / the bear brought him to his cave. But there fownde he nothing. wherefore
he was gretely sorry and very hongrye. The bear lycked him self and was well
refresshed and took noon head of the wolf wherefore the wolf spoke and said.
what is there here to ete / why have thou disseyuid me thus. The bear said.
Sit down and lycke thy self if thou lift / and else goo whedir thou will.
The wolf was deceived and with great mourninge retournyd again to the wode
and said.

Evermore wisely a prose let us make.
Or we to owr how sold any personys take.
WE should preue our friends / or we give credence unto them / for no man that
is wise should disclose to his friend the secretnesse of his mind but if he be
assuryd of him and have prouyd him before / as it is written Ecclesi.xi. Bring
not every man in to thy hows / that is to mean. In to thy mind / by hastye
credence geuinge for the world is replete with great soteltye. And also it is
written in the same place. If thou have a friend / prove him in thy trowble /
and be assuryd of him or thou show him all thy mind. For certainly a prudent
man and discrete should notte to hastyly give credence to his friend but aftyr
he has prouyd him and found him faithful he may the more largely commit
trust unto him. Wherefore Valerye writes libro tertio cap.viii. of Alexander
king of macedone. That when Philippe Phisicien unto the said alexander and
his perfightly prouyd friend / should give him a drink / there were lettirs
sent to alexander conteynyge that the said Philippe was corrupt with money of
king Darye and he had put venyme in the medecyne. which lettres when Alexander
had read / he drank first the medecyne / and aftirwarde immediatlye he
delivered the lettyrs to Philippe to read / having in him so great confidence
/ that in nowyse he cowde mystruste him. Therefore we should eschew to be
knytte to any person in fauowre and amyte before a dew preef. For the
Philosofir says. Beware thou of friends not prouyd and Seneca says. Take
delyberacion with thy friend / but first with thy self / for every fellow is
not good nor faith full. Therefore discrecyon must discern the good from the
badde.it is told that on a time twey felows went togider by the way. To whom
a bear suddenly met and made on them a grate sawte. For dread oon of them
scandyd a tree. The other lay flat on the ground faynyge him self to be deed
The bear went to him that lay like deed and demyd he had be deed / and
departed from him and went his way. His fellow descendid when the bear was
goone and asked of his fellow what the bear had said to hi^ in his ere / and
he said. The bear counsellyd me to beware of such a fellow that has forsake
me in so great a iubardye. And it is to be notyd that enymyes that offend
either to other to the vttermoste that they can they may never have sure and
continual peace togider aftir. Whereof an example is told of a chorle that had
but oone son. And upon a time he lycencyd hi^ to goo to a place and play.
and a serpent bote him / and killed him / and he was buried and a sign set
upon his grave. The said chorle lay daily in a wait and be thought him how
he might sle the serpente / and at last fownde him and in great angir smote
at him willing to have kyllyd him. But the serpent fled in to an hole / and
he smote of his tail. And there grew inextinguible hatrede between the chorle
and the scrpe^te. The chorle at last spoke of peace / but the serpente
answerde and said. It may not be that thou spekyste of. For as long as thou
seyste the grave of thisonne / and as oftyn as I behold my Tail cut of / there
shall never between us by perfect peace nor concord.

Of the wild got and the wolf. Dialogo.cix.


OAmula as says Papie is a female got of the wilderness. This got warchid
on a night with a chorle / and as she went homeward from her pasture / the
wolf came to her and said. Now shall I fyl my belly of the / for thou may
not escape. This Damula knelyd down before the wolf and said. I pray the for
the love of Godde to suffir me to go to the fold / for my kydde soukyd not
this day. Wherefore he may perissh with hongre. And truly I promise unto the
when I have fed him I shall return to the again. The wolf thought surely to
have them both saying. Go to thy fold and bring thy kydde with the / For I
desire greatly to se him / and I shall be Fauowrable to you both / but
withowte the / he shall have no grace. This Female got swear to fulfill all
this / and forth she went. But when she came home she kept her hows and
brought up her kydde and never retournyd to the wolf. wherefore the wolf made
great lamentacyon many a long day aftir and said.

He that is possessyd and has gold in hand.
Is not wise to lose it for promys tresour or land.
So manyon having sufficience / for concupiscens and avarice desire to swalow
up al things like wolfis insaciable / that never be saturate. wherefore they be
void oftyntymes and not always fully replete. a couetows man full of avarice
is like a vessel botomelesse / that is never fall / as it is written Eccle.
quinto. The Couetows man shall never be fyllyd with money / and therefore old
princis hatyd couetyse and forsook it. And they desirid not to have dominacyon
to gadre money / but for worship and conseruacyon of the comune well.
wherefore Valery tellyth. lib.iii. when Scypion was accusyd of couetyse to the
Senate he answerde and said in this manner. when I lately had subduyd all
Affrike unto yowr power. I reseruyd thereof nothing to my behofe / sauf oonly
my name. For he was named euyr aftir Scipio Affrican. for he subduyd affrike.
Valery also tellith of man tense curione that was the very loremastir of
curtesye of rome and a spectacle of strength / when the legatis of the Sannytes
were come to him and he had receyuyd them in to his place / they behylde him
sittynge by the fire upon a stole etynge his sowpere in a platere of tree. They
offirde to him a great sum of Gold and with sweet words they prayde him to
occupy the Gold to his worship and to ete no more in tree. And he lawghid and
said. your labowre is in vain to bring Gold to me. But goo ye and repoorte
unto the Sannytes that the Mantense Curione desires rather to rule them that
has possessyon of gold than to have the gold. and also say unto them that
the said Curione will notte be corrupt by no money / nor by dread of any
enymyes. Also it is told in that same place that when the legatis sent from
the sannytes were come to Rome / the found fabrice prince of the Romans
sittinge and singing. To whom when they had offirde a great Sum of Gold
for there lyberty He beholdinge not his own well / but rather the comune profit
/ gave this answer to them and said. Goo ye fro me and bear yowr Gold with
you. For Romans have more affection to have dominacion ouir goldkepers then
over the Gold. And also saint Augustine tellyth de ciuitate Dei that Lucyus
Valerius that did when he was consul of Rome / was so poor that no money was
found in his hows when he should dye. wherefore he desired the people to
ordeyne for his beryinge. For in that time the princes that ruled the comune
thing / that was most rich. In there own howsis they were very pouer.
wherefore saint Augustyne says in the same place / that oon of them was twyes
consul and he was utterly expulsyd of the Senate / for cawse that.x. powndis
of money were fownde in his hows. And Valery says. Every man labowrid to
encrece the common well / and not his own / and desired rather to be pouer in a
rich reame / than to be rich in a pouer reame And he inducith examplys of the
consullys that were so pouer when they dyed that they had no goods to
prefer their doughtirs / to marriages. but notwithsto^dinge the necessite of
worthymen was releuyd by the senate. And they vsyd customablye to prefer the
doughtyrs of them to worshipful marriages. and saint augustyn Epistola quinta.
That they that wisely aduertith and attendith say that it was more to be
sorowyd wha^ the wylfull pouertye of Rome was forsakyn. Than when richesse
lackyd. For in pouertye the integrite of all good manners was conseruyd.
Richesse corruptyth the mind of man / worse than any other enymye. whereof it
is red that the host of alexander was enrychid owte of nombir when Darye was
deuicte / and breuely aftir / when they should fight again / they of
alexandirs host were overcome. which when alexandir understood he commaundyd
immediately al tho goods to be burnt that his hooste had gotyn by spolyacyon
and said. As long as my people had no possession of goods there was noon that
might resist them. But now that they be o^erate and chargyd with gold and
silver they be made slowghtfull and unlusty / and when tho goods were brent
and goone / they fawghte and were manlye as they were before. Also it is read
of the Romans that in old times they warryd to get worship. To have
lybertye / for conseruacyon of the common well / and than they obtaynyd and had
the bettyr at all times / But when there minds were infecte with couetyse and
avarice / then were they continually victe and overcome.

Of a little discolowrid beast called Varius and the swyrell. Dialogo.cx.
VArius is a little beast some what more then a wesyll and he is called Varius
for he is variably colowrid. For on the belly he is white and on the back he
has a colowre like asshis. so comely that thowe may marvel to see so
fourmably he is depayntyd with colowrys / and he is of the kind of piroly /
and he bydith much in treys and brings forth his generacyon. And diverse men
use greatly to rejoice in diverse garnamentis furryd with skynnes of these
beastis. But nevertheless this pretty beast reioycith but lytellin his own
furre / and all though yt this Varius be but little of bodily quantite. yet
aftir the consideracion of his noble furre / he is a most excellent best. and
so is ye sayrell also. These twain were associate togider and said. we twain
be honorable and of great price among all people for the great valowre of owr
skynnes. And forasmoche as we be so Noble of owr natyf kind / let us pursewe
such beastis as be vile and despisable. wherefore it fortuned yt they found a
Tode crepinge / and they greuid him sore / and put him to great vexacyon. To
whom the tode spoke and said. god made us all and not we owre self. If ye be
more bewtifull thank ye yowr muker. These beestis were wroth with the toode /
and put owte both his Ien saying. Daryst thou speak again us thou vglye
creature. and aftirwarde they fownde an owl making her neste in a tree. and
they made great showte and noise aftir her and put her to flyghte and
destroyde both her neste and her eggis. The owl fled with great heaviness
and said. bredren ye have done evil to me. For I am a creature of Goddis
creacyon as ye be. but thowgh I cannot be auengid my self. an other shall be
vengid upon you / For yowr extorcyon. at the last they Fownde an Ape Iapinge
and mowynge upon a tree. To whom they said. why art not thou shamefaste thou
worst of all beastis / For thou have no tail / and thou shewiste us thyn arse.
The ape was wood and came down From the tree / and kyllyd them both / and
pluckyd owte there Guts and said / in this manner as here folowyth.

Noble people naturallye be curteys / and good
Mockers and skorners be far fro gentyl blood
Therefore noble people and mighty should notte grieve them that be pouer and
low. For nobilyte restith not in the dignite of the parentys. But rather in
the composicion of good manners / as the Philosofir says. Noblesse is that
thing oonlye that garnysshith the soul with good manners / and alsoo yt is
Communely said. He is a vyllayne that does vyllanows things / and not he that
was borne in vylla. It is read that a Lion did great hurt in his yowth for
he had wowndyd sore with his cleys a Boore / a bull / and an ass. and in
process he was old / and in ye winter season he fell in to a great snow /
and he was so cold that he cowde not rise by him self. That seeing yt boore
and remembringe of his old wowndys / he smote him grievously with his teth. and
the bull / alsoo gooryd him in to the belly with his hornys. The Ass with his
helis laid at him freely and hit him on the forehede with many a great stroke.
The Lion might not fly but spoke with great dolowre / and said. All thing
that I have overcome / ouercomith me now. My worship is now a sleep / and
help of mine honowre is paste. Behold now he noyeth me that I have noyede /
and as I have done to other before time now fallyth it to me.

Of the Horse and the boore Dialogo.cxi.


ON a time it befell that an horse had pleded so long a geynste a Boore that by
long contynuance the horse becam so poer that he was not able to mateyne his
plee for lack of money or goods / for all his substance was spent and gone
and he sought his frendis / Than he went to the Mule and prayed him with great
lamentacyon to lend him.x. li.in gold / the which he did for pitye with a
good will. wherewith the horse wan his plee and recovered all his costys and
damages / with habundance of great goods. Thus when all his care was past and
he being ageyn in his prosperyte / the Mule come unto him and required his
lendt money / the which with a mocking manner The horse that was inflamyd with
ire and falshede / called to him the camel and the ass / and they three all to
beat the mule and went forth to the judge. The judge this knowinge he gave this
sentence that all that money should breuely be restoryd to the mule / and for
there violence / and hurtys that they had done to him / they should pay him an
hundryd markys. The camel having no good to pay / he forsook the cite and
was banyshed. The ass was imprisonyd and stockyd fast and endyd his life
wretchidlye. The horse was constraynyd by great rygowre to pay his dettys and
his damage and so he remaynyd in great pouertye / and was utterly undone and
spoylyd and said.

He that is indettyd and will never pay
Shall lose oftyn times / and his good shall away.
SO there be manyon yt be unkind yt know not benefitys done to them / nor
yield no thankyng is to there good doers. Again such caton says be thou
remembryd of ye benefitis yt thou have receyuid. And also he says. A little
gift yt thy pouer friend geuith unto the. Receive thou gladlye / and remembyr
fully to give thankinges. But many oon now a days / not oonly give no
thankynges / but rather speak falsely again there good doers. As it is red yt
when a sertayne king had exaltyd oon that he especyally louyd above al other.
This man thought and said to him self. The king has so gretely auancyd me yt
I shall never aquite him nor be free. Wherefore he compassyd ye kings death The
king yt knowinge cyted him before his own presence / and the troth known /
he iugid him to be drawyn throw ye ^ite. And as he was drawyn / every man
threw unclean thing is upon him. and he suffirde it patiently forasmoche as he
in prosperity had be combrous and not fauowreable to any person / but proud
and noyable to all people. But when a friend of his which he louyd as him self
had throwyn a stoone at him and smytte him on the too / he cried out and made
great heaviness / and when he had be drawyn and was brought before ye king gayn.
The king asked of his seruauntis / How behanyd ye wretch him self in his
passion. They said / very pacyently. But he made great lamentacyon for oon
stroke ye was geuyn him. The king inquyred of him ye cawse. And said. For I
louyd him most feruentlye yt smote me / and trustyd synglerly to his socowr.
The king said. Of thyn own mowth I judge yt thou bad seruante. For thou have
most falsely without cawse conspired again me. And ye king commaundyd that
he should be hangyd forthwith / according to his demerytes. Hitte is a great
maruayle that creaturis having reason shalde be so Ingrate / and unkind when
brute Beastis unreasonable know there benefactours As it is read that upon a
time when a Lion was takyn in the nettis of hunters a shepeheerde that was
compassionable unto him delivered him. And an other time the same lion was
again takyn of hunters / and put in to a cave of the Emperowrys with other
wild beastis. And the forsayde shepeheerde for his offenses was cast in to
the same cave to be deuowryd. And the Lion knowinge the Shepeheerde not oonely
hurt him not / but also preseruyd him from al other beastis that would have
deuowryd him. Alsoo it is read that the duke of Saxonye fownde a Lion
fighting with a most cruel Serpente / which had compassyd the neck of
him rownde abowte. and intendyd with his venyme to sle him. The knight
beholdinge the noblesse Leonyne / and the malice Serpentine / He smote of the
Serpentis head. Wherefore the Lion folowyd ye knight like a tame beast / and
never forsook him. and for the forsayde knights love / the forsayde Lion
fawghte again his enymyes / and when the knight was deed and buried. The Lion
/ for love lay on his grave / and there dyed.

Of the ass and the Ox. Dialogo.cxii.
AN Ox and an ass had there dwelling togider / with an husbondeman / which
fed them plentyfully. But many times he prickyd them and co^pellyd them to
labowre. Upon a time this man beat his ass / and he was angrye and went to
the Ox saying What shall we do. This Chorle betith us sore / and makith us
werye. Let us goo from him / and cast up owr yockys / for we be but young as
yet / and we may be merry a great while and owte of daungere. and so forth
they went. and as they walked by many fair pasturis they were very glad.
and at last night came and it was very Dark / and they compleynyd euerich
to other and said. How shall we sleep. Ox hows have we noon as we were wonde
to have. Certaynlye it had been bettyr for us to maynteyne true labowre then
to depart. and as they lay on the gronde couetinge to sleep. The wolf came
cryinge and vexyd them so sore / that all the long night they were withowte
sleep and said. It is not good for us to bide here / but rather with small
beastys / for then shall we be defendyd of shepeheerdys and doggis. and when
they came to the Flocks / desyringe to be with them / and tarry all night.
The shepeheerdys expulsydde them / and beat them / and they weppyd and made
gretemone and concordyd to dwell with a laborer that punysshed them soore and
fed them scantly. Wherefore they were compuncte greatly / and retournyd to there
first state and said

Bettir it is in suretye at home for to bide
The^ through ye world to wa^dyr and be without guide
IN this we may note what iubardye it is to goo in to strange contreys and fro
place to place / and to be lodgyd in othermennys howsis / whereof it is said
Eccle.xxix. It is a wicked life to be logid from bous to house. and it is also
bettir and more profitable to suffir otherwhile some small greef / then to
suffir a gretter greef. and when a man shall do any thing euyr he owith wisely
to consider what may fall to him therbye as the wiseman says. What soeuyr thou
do / do it wisely and behold the end. And also he says / I will pacienely
suffir small hurtys in eschewing of gretter. whereof it is told that a kyte on
a time greuyd dowuis very fore and stale away there chekyns / and otherwhyle
the dowuys defendyd them self to there power / and smote him with there wings
and drove him away. At last they m^de a counsel and chose the goshawke to be
there king to maintain them again the furyous kyte. The king began cruellye
and was to them more noyable then there old enymye / and took daily oon of the
fatteste / and ete her. The dowuys complaynyd emonge them self of there king
and said that bettyr it had been to them and less hurt to have suffirde the
batell of the kyte / then to be mourdryd daily and cruelly slain withowte
defense or remedy. By this it is showed that bettyr counsel is bettyr with
rest and sykernesse than delectable with besynes and parell. As Isope shewith
in fablys yt the feelde mows came to the town / and there he was worthyly
receyuyd of the mows of the cite / and he made him great chere / and commendyd
the large expense of the cite greatelye / and browght him to the bysshopis
celar / and gave him delycate mete. at last came ye botelar / and the kaye
ratled / and in came he. The house mowse fled in to his hoole. The feld mows
ran again the wallys and scantlye escapyd with his life At last they met
togider and the field mows said. I had lever gnawe hard benys all my life
then to be in this sodeyne feere. Take to the thy delycatys / that be to the
great pleasure / for I love piece with pouertye and quietness delyteth me more
then precyosite of metys / or delycyows fedynges.

Of the Goote and the Ram. Dialogo.cxiii.


Diverse beastis in a great Flock were gadryd togider upon a time / and fed
them in there pasturis. The Ram among all other called the Goote fro the Flock
and said. Go we fro the Flock. To what intent abide we with these sheep so
shamefullye. and when they were departed from the Flock and had forsake the
feleshippe. The rauenows wolf that lurkyd in the woods came owte upon them
and bote them / and fed him self / and said.

Bettyr it is with compeny surely to goo.
Then to be soole / for dread of thy foo.
By this example it aperith that he that forsakith good compeny forsakyth
great suretye. For it is written Eccle.iiii. woe be to the sole man for if he
fall he has no helpar to rise. There was a wodehenne that had many chekyns
which she norysshed lovingly. There came a kyte daily awaytinge to sle the
chekyns. But this wodehenne gadryd her chekyns togider to defend them from the
Rauenows bird. and all they that came to her were protecte and defendyd.
Nevertheless oon of them would euyr pike aloone and took noon head of his
compenye. wherefore the cruel kyte cawghte him and bare him away and ete him
with owte mercy.

Of the Pantere and the Hog. Dialogo.cxiiii.


PAnterais a beast of dynerse colowris very fair and sweet smelling / Solyne
says that it is a beast very especyall varyed with colowris / full of small
cerclys / so that he shynyth of the yelowe cerclys that be hyd / and his
colowryd boody is distinct in yelowe and white. And it is in his manner a meke
beast / and he has the dragon oonly to his enymye. And when he has etyn /
and is sufficiently replete with diverse metys / he hydeth him self and slepith
in his cave / as says Phisiologus. And aftyr three days he ryseth from sleep
/ and makyth great noise all other beastis when they here the voice of him
they gadir togider / and follow the swetnesse of the sauowr that comyth out of
his mouth The dragon allonlye when he herith the voice of him is full of dread
/ and hydith him self in his cave. Upon a time this Pantera was gretely
temptyd to ete of an of an hog. But forasmoche as he was acustomyd to ete
clean mete. He abhorryd yt was unclean. Notwithstondinge he nourrisshed an
hog for him self and ordeynyd for him a most clean lodginge / and cawsid him
oftyn to be wypedde / and would notte suffir him to be wrappyd in the mire.
This unclean sow was wroth and had a natural apetyte rather to be rollyd in
yt mire / then to be kept clean. And at a leysar this sow stale owte of the
hows / and all to defylyd her self with other swyne of her own kind. Wherefore
the forsayde sweet best Pantera hatyd the hog / and put her away from him
for ever and said.

From nature and kind any thing to change
It is very paynfull / and oftyntymes strange
THus do unclean people and synful which may not arise out of the mire of
concupiscens / and lecherye / for their bad custom / for the philosofre says.
Custom is an otherkynde / and therefore with stand in the beginning.
Temptacyon in his springinge is like a young plant / that esyly may be
pluckyd up or ever he grow to a tree by age / but as ye gloss says Customhably
sin is like to an old sykenesse / which is hard to be helyd. Whereof it is
written Ihero.xiii. If ethiops may change his skin / and a parde his
varyacyon of colowre. Then may ye do well aftyr yor continual sin. As who
says / it is like an impossibilite. It is read of vespa^yane the Emperowre /
yt when he was couetows and had so contynuyd unto age / and a sertayn person
had repreuyd him and said. A fox may change his skin / but not his
condycions / he answerde and said. At such men we may smyle / and take it to
owr own correccyon.

Of the wild Ass and the wild boore. dia.cxv


AS Papye writes Onager is a wild Ass / and aper is a bore or a wyld hog.
These two beastis fond there mastir walking in the fylde / and they said unto
him. Help us mastir we pray the / and give rightful judgment of us. To whom
he said. What shall I do to you. The ass answerde. My lord has deceyuyd
me / for he has a little whelpe yt ecyth of his mete / and slepith on his own
bed / and my lord cherysshith him and playth with him daily / and he neuyr
towchyth me. Nor shewith to me such merry contenance / ye daily bear his sackys
and vex my self in his labowr. to who^ his mastir said. thou ass if thy
desire be to be oftyn seen / and touchid / thou must be clean and not defylyd.
The little whelpe is acceptable and pleasant to his lord / for he is
continually clean and waytyth upon him. ye bore also said. My lord kepith a
nyghtingale at whom in a goldyn cage. And when she syngeth / he reioycyth
greatly / and is very myrye. And when I draw forth my song / it is nothing
to his pleasure / nor when my fellow syngith nether. Wherefore we pray the ordyr
this matere in dew form. To these petycions there mastir answerde and said.
ye know notte what ye should ask. If ye desire to be hard and takyn head to.
ye must have delectable and sweet songis. and voice timable / and not
contrary. The nyghtyngale is iowyouslye harkenyd / for she spekyth and
singethe plesauntlye / and so do not you. and they were confused with these
words / and said.

That is not lefull we should neuyr axe
Nor in vnknowyn conning owr tongis laxe.
Therefore if we desire gladlye to be seen and towchid / let us stody to be
clean and not defilyd. and moreouyr if we will be hard and attendyd to. Speak
we plesauntly and vertuouslye. Not vile words of rybaw dry and of
corrupcyon. Some personys there be of whom the throat is like a grave that
stynkyth when it is opened / as it is written psalmo.v. a grave alopyn is the
throat of them. That is to say. Of sinful men that ever speak stinkynge
words. Of whom also it is written in that same book. God mote destroy al
wicked lyppes and tongues large speaking. That is to mean again God and his
neybowre. They that speak such words of contumely and iniurye owe not to be
hard as Seneca says. The erys should be stoppid again bad talys. Diogenes
the philosofir said to a sertayne person that told him a bad tale that his
friend should say by him / it is to me dowtfull whethir my friend so said.
But it is very sertayne to me yt thou sayste shrewdlye of me. Antisthenes
answerde to oon that reportyd that an other should say shrewdlye by him / he
said not so of me / but of him that knowith him self to have such fawtys
within him. Senocrates answerde to oon yt cursyd him. as thou art lord of thy
tongue so am I lord of mine erys / for I may close them at my pleasure. he gave
alsoo an answer to an other that told him that a sertayne person cursyd him /
and reportyd falsely of him. I care not. For herynge should be strenger than
the tongue. For to every creature longith but oon tongue and two ^rys. and so a
man should suffir more with his tway erys / than any man might speak with oo
tongue. It is ^olde in a book of Iapes of philosofirs that oon answerde to an
other that said shrewdely to him. Thou may esylye say to me evil / for I
will not answer. In the same book hit is told that the Philosofre zeno / said
to oone that cursyd him. If thou hardist thy self with mine erys thou shuldyste
be still and noote well that there was great pacyence in old fadirs in
suffringe of contumelyows words and rebukes. It is read of alexander / as it
aperyth in the.iii. book of Iapis of philosofir that antigonus said unto him /
it is convenient to thyn age to rule / as who says. Thou art unworthy to
regne / but by the reason of thyn age and voluptuousnes / and nevertheless he
suffirde it most pacyentlye / In that same book alsoo it is told of the
pacyence of Iulii Cesaris which greatly lothid to be ballyd / how be it / he
was so. and when he kembyd his here forewarde / that grew bacwarde / a knygte
said unto him. O Emperowre it is more possible to me to prevail again the
host of Rome / than the to be not ballyd / which saying he patiently suffirde
/ and also when there were made of him famows books and rydyculows songs
opynlye song / and that to his rebuke he suffirde it pacyently. And also upon
a time when an agid woman despised his oryginal / and be gynnynge / and called
him bredemaker / and baker he suffryd it / and smylyd at her. In the same place
it is told of Caesar Augusto / that when oon spoke to him and said. O thou
tyrawnte. He answerde. If I were so / thou woldist not so call me. In that
same place also it is told of Scipione affrican / that when oon callid him
from fightinge and rebukyd him he said. My modir brought me forth an Emperowre
and not a warryowr It is tedde also of Caesar augusto in the third book of iapis
of philosofirs. That when Tyberius complaynid to him that many spoke evil of
him / he answerde. It is sufficyent to us / if we have that fortune that no
person can prevail to do us hurt. Therefore be thou not greuyd if any person
speak shrewdly of us / for we may suffir it. And Seneca tellyth of the pacyence
of Antigoni in his third book deira. That when he had hard diverse personys
speaking evil of him to there thinkyng the king not knowinge / and he had
harkenyd and plainly hard every word / for as much as between him and them
was interiecte but a thyn wall / he softelye / knockyd with his hand and said
as though he had been an other person. Goo ye yowr way hens that the king
here you not. Also Seneca tellyth in his.iiii. book deira of the said king
antigono. That upon a time when he hard diverse of his knights / saying by
him all the evil they cowde / he went to them yt had spokyn most and said.
Now that ye have cursyd yowre king cawselesse and spokyn of him so
vncurteyslye. now leave youreuyl speech / and will him good / for he louith you
nevertheless. O marvelous humilite of a king / yt disdaynyd not to
condescende to them yt labowrid most and a wondirfull patience that he was not
indignate / nor cruel to give judgment to them that cursyd him / and deseruid
it.

Of the Salamandre and the Idre. Dialogo.cxvi.


THe Salamandre is of the kind of a lacerte or of a stellyon a pestiferus
beast and most greatly venymed. For as plinius says lib.xxix.ca.iiii. she
infectith the fruits of treys and corruptith the watirs. Of the which who so
euyr etyth or drinks / he is even strayt deed. And also if ye spetyll of her
towche the foot of a man. It is poisoned and destroieth him. and all be it so
that in the Salama^dre remaynyth great strength of poison / she ysetyn of
some Beastys / and takyn for a food. This said beast Salamandre oonly and no
mo lyuyth in ye fire / as says Plinius / and puts owte both the fire / and
the flame / and it is the kind of a Salamandre to be rowgh and full of curlyd
herys / like a see calf. Of whose skin sometime is made gyrdyllys for kings
to were. For wha^ they have be long worn / and then cast in to the fire they
will not burn / but aftir they have lie long in the fire they be clean and
newly pourgid and be newlye drawyn from the fire as though they were repayrid
of new. and of the same skin be made macchis in lamps yt will not waste for
no brinnynge. Hydrus is a poysonde Serpent that leuith in the watyrs
having.vheedis. The twey serpentis fawght togider / but when the Salamandre was
overcome of the Hydre / she lepte in to the fire to escape. When the hydre had
the worse / and was almooste scomfighte of the Salamandre he fled in to the
watirs. And so they conseruyd them self from death and said.

He that retournyth to his own natural place
Shall be defendyd / and find great solace.
THus owe we to diffende owre self / when we be temptyd of owr goostly enymyes.
Of the brynnynge fire of concupiscens and lechery. We should manlye resist and
cast owr self in to the watirs of Chastity and clennesse. When we be impugnyd
of the watirs of couetyse and auaryce. We owe to lepe in to ye fire of charity
and largess / by example of the down. For it is read in the propirte of
birds that there be some Goshawkys that take no birds / but oonly in the air
/ And some there be that take noon but oonly in the land. And naturally the
down knowith that. and therefore she flies / fro the Goshawke that cachith her
in the air / and descendith in to the land / If she be pursewyd of the hawke
that rauyssheth on the land / she co^tinuith and bydith still in the air.
Such reason should we have again the Goshawke of hell / which has a M. wyles
to hurt / whereof Paulyne says. Our enemy to whom is known a M. diverse ways
of noyinge / should be defendyd with so many diverse wepyns as he ordeynyth
sotylteys. And therefore when mine enymye pursewith me / having so many
disceytes. I must by Goddys grace ordeyne a M. diverse ways to with stand
him. It is told yt a demoniak was brought to an holy man / which commawndyd the
feende to come forth and tell him his name / and he answerde and said. We be
three fendes / that dwell in this man / I am called the closer of the heart / My
secounde brodyr is called the closer of the mowth / and the third is called
closer of the purse / Mine office is to indurate the heart of the sinner that he
may have no contricyon / and if he be contrite / my brodyr labowrith to keep
him from confession. And though he be confessyd / my third brodir will suffer
him do no satisfaccyon / And thus my third brodir is named / closer of the
purse. And by these meanys we prevail again much people

Of the Ape / and a beast called Taxus. and in Englyssh a Brocke. Dialogo.
Cxvii.


OF Taxus the here is harshe and rough and is a beast to the quantite of a fox
Of this beast spekith plinius. li.viii.cap.xxxix. and says / when doggis
follow him / he restraynyth and kepith in his wind and his breath / and so he
cawsith his skin to be blowyn and straynyd / and be that mean he defendyth
the bytynge of doggis / and felyth not the strokes of men. This beast hatith
the fox and has a custom to fight again him. But the subtle fox seeing
that he cowde not hurt this brocke for his hard skin / and rowgh here / she
faynyd her self to be venquyssyd and victe / and of subtylte fled and ran a
way. and while this Taxus this brocke or gray sawghte for his pray. The false
fox entryd in to his closette / and shamefully defylyd the lodging of this
graye with pysse and other unclean things. In someche that he abhorryd to come
home / and utterly forsook his howsolde / and chose him an other little mansyo^
for his ease a great way thens. If he lack mete in ye wintyr / he will
sleep for his dinner / for it is a beast yt leuith much by sleep.unto this
brocke came an ape and said. Brodir lend me an.c. markys. For I have
affection to goo beyond the sea to merchandise / and I shall truly deuyde the
lucre between the and me. To whom the brocke answerde. That shall I gladly
gra^te the. For all my desire is to live easyly. wherefore thou shall have thy
desire if thou canste find me sufficient suretye and make me an instrumente by
the hondes of a notarye. The ape found sureteys the bugle and the bull / and
left the oblygacyon / in kepinge of the horse / and went forth on his journey
/ and neuir came home again. Taxus this brocke seeing that he was thus illudyd
of the ape. he asked his good of the sureteys. They scornyd him and despised
him gretely. Wherefore this beast complaynyd to the judge / and showed him his
obligacion. The judge immediately cyted the creditowris and gave sentence that
they should restore the goods according to there bond. Wherefore they were
greatly wroth and ever malygnyd again the brocke and pursewyd him. And at the
last they took him and wowndyd him sore with many a great stroke / and when
he was so woundyd he said with great lamentacion and mourninge.

He that can beware of him that would borowe
Is euyr owte of strife and kept fro much sorrow
OFtyntymes it happith that a man lesith his fre^des when he askyth his own
goods that he has lent. Nevertheless the Prophet says. Psalmo.cxi. He is
a iocounde man that she with mercy and lendith. But that notwithstondinge
Caton says. Look to whom thou geuyste. That is to mean / there should be a
discrecyon in the gyuer and lendar / it is told in fablys that a do being
great with fawn came to an other do that had an hows / and with sweet
words. Fair prayers and lamentacion she asked lodging / and desired hows
rome for the time of her need permyttynge / that she should deliver the hows to
the ownar when she had fawnyd. The other was merciful and departed / and
suffirde her to have the rome. And aftir a long season when the iubardy was
paste The ownar retowrnyd and repetyd his right. The other lockyd fast the
durrys / and closyd her erys / and would not deliver that she promised. But
spoke cruellye and said. I fere not thy long teth. For the teth of my
children shall al to rent ye. Wherefore by this fable a man is tawghte that he
should not always gyu^ crede^ce to hastyly to sweet words. For manyon be
disceyuyd by the meanys of pity. As Isope tellyth willing to show that
nothing may profit unto bad folk when the shrewyd mind of them is notte a
shamyd to be vnremembryd of a good deed. Wherefore he tellyth that the wolf was
acloyed in the throat / and almost chokyd with a boon of a lamb that he had
deuowryd which stacke fast in his throat ouirthwarte. Wherefore in all possible
haste he sent to the crane that he with his long byll should draw it out. The
bone out drawyn fro the throat of the wolf by the meanys of the crane / he
asked his reward which the wolf had promised him. The wolf answerde and said.
Thou unhappy creature / lyuest not thou by the gift of me / might not I with
oon bytte have bytte a sonder thy neck. Therefore take thy life / for my
reward. For other reward shall thou noon have of me. And so manyon be unkind
to there benefactowris.

Of the mows / and the catte Dialogo.cxviii.


Upon a time the mows went unto ye catte and humbly salutyd him and said O
mastir of most excellence I entende ever to do to the true service. alonlye
I beseech the by my protectowre again the wodenesse of the wesyll. the Catte
receyuyd him in to proteccyon and led the mous about with him and would not
suffir him to be deseyuyd of the wesyll. The wesyl was greuyd with the dealing
of the catte and enuyed at him greatly. Upon a time the mows offendyd and the
Catte did dew correccyon. Wherewith the mows was greuyd and went to the wesyll
and said when he had done dew salutacyon. Mine offenses be great and I am
verily worthy to be punyshed. For I have been again the under proteccyon of
the catte. And thus subtelly he sowid discord between the catte and the wesyll
/ when he was justly punyshed of either of them. At last he browght them to
that point that utterly they intendyd each to kill other. and as they were
going promptely to batel the wesyll spoke and said. O dear suster what mean
we. Why should oon of us sle the other by the meanys of the false mows. Bettir
it is and less hurt for us to kill him / than to kill owrself. These words
plesyd well the catte / and they both togider killed the mows and ete him
meryly between them and said

They that make Rancowre / discord or debate
Shall not be unpunished erly or late.
THus do flaterers and malycyows people between princes and lords that be at
rest and peace Wherefore they be hateful unto god / for hit is written
Prouer.vi. There be.vi. things that God hatyth / and ye.vii.is detestable unto
him. Ien high lokinge / a tongue lyinge / hondes shedynge innocente blood. The
heart thinking most wicked thowghtys. Fete that be swyfte to run to do
sin. Lesyngmongers and false witness berers / and such as sow discord
among lovers and bredren. Whereof it is written Ecclesiastici.xxviii. A
flaterer and a dowble tongid man is acursyd / for he has trowblyd many a man /
that dwelled in peace. Old fadirs louid no such glosers and dowble tongyd
folkys / for in them was magnificence and strength for to say the trowth / in
all there spechis / as Valery tellyth libro sexto. That when all the people
hopyd upon the death of the tyraunte Dyonyse / for ye exceeding bytternesse of
his most cruel manners / a woman of the grettest age prayde the goddis yt he
might continewe long in life without sykenes or disease / and when the said
Tyrawnte knew it / he maruaylyd o^ herbenyuolence withowt his deserving / and
Called her / and inqueryd what reward she had receyuyd of him so to say. She
answerde and said. For a reason that I have prouyd by experience before time.
For wha^ I was a maid and had a grievous tyraunte. I would gladlye have lackyd
him. and when he was slain / a worse occupied his rome / and then his
dominacyon to be endyd I desired most fervently. and a worse rular than thou
art we keep never to have. therefore I dread if thou were take from us. a worse
if it be possible should succeed in to thy place. Therefore I have prayde for
thy conseruacyon. Old philosophirs also had leuyr dye for saying trowthe /
then to live and hyde it. wherefore of Dyogene it is told / that he was
showing trowthe in every place. Of whom Valery spekith li.iiii.ca.iii. that
when aristipus had said to the forsayde Diogene yt stood and wasshyd wortys.
O Dyogene if thou haddiste pleasyd yt tyra^te dyonyse with thy fair words /
thou shuldist not have nedyd thus to do / truly quod he if thou woldist do thus
/ thou shuldist not have need to flater ye said tyraunte. For this philosofre
had much leuyr to be fed and maynteynyd with a mess of wortys and say
troth then to be fed with ye kings deyntis and to flater him or say to him
other then trowth.

Of.v. Lambys and a Wolf. Dialogo.cxix.


Five Lambys there were in nombyr yt were forsakyn both of fader and mother and
left like pupyllis and orphanys / were ruled / and gydyd of there kynsmen and
tutowris / upon a time the wolf called oon of these lambys secretly to him /
and said. I think to be compassionable unto the. Consyderinge thy great
friend and fadir is deed. Wherefore I will deliver to the my lettirs of
proteccyon that thou may goo sawf. Nevertheless first goo to thy bredren and
bydde them come to me with the to conferme this matere. This innocente lam was
reioycid with great gladness and went to his bredre^ and showed unto them all
this matter. To whom they said. This plesith us greatly. But go we first to our
friends and tutowris and desire there counsel. and when they came to them. There
tutowris answerde and said Beware for god sake of such a mastir. For and if
ye go and return to him / he will destroy you and kill you But they not taking
head of the wholesome consel of there senyours / went forth to the wolf. The cruel
wolf s^ynge them was very glad / and lepte among them and killed them every
chone and fed him self and his children and said.

He walkyth evil and oftyn offendith.
That to sad counsel neuir attendith.
Therefore we must give credence to the counsel of our senyours. For it is
written. Job* xxv.in agyd folkys is great wisdom and prudence in long time.
we should do aftir counsel / and especyally of our friends. For it is said
prouer.iii. Keep thou the law and good counsel and life shall be geuyn unto
thy soul and grace unto thy chekys. It is said that an husbondman labowryd
his land and sew it with hemp. Flexe or lynette seed. A Swalowe that was
old and wise / seeing that / called all other birds togider and said. This
feelde and this seed thretnyth us soore. For in time coming / hereof shall be
made many a comberows net. Therefore go we all togider and spurn it a brood /
or euir it grow / or come up. But all othr birds would not consent / but
repreuyd the swalowe and said she was full of folyssh dread / Up grew this
erbe / and the swalowe warnyd them again that great parell yt approchid and
drew nere. The birds deryded the swalowe and said. This swalowe pleasith men
/ and flaterith them with his song. This hemp was full growyn and mow down
and diverse nettis were made of it / and cawght many a bird. Then all the
birds knew there fawte / and repentyd them when there was no remedy. Therefore
he that despises profitable cownsell / oftyntymes takith unprofitable / and he
that thinkith him self to sure / fallith oftyntymes in to snarys. And many
times the cownsell of a vile person / is very good aed profitable / for
wisdom vaylyth more then strength. For an example it is written that the Egle
fleing in the air and seeing the snayle puttinge owte his hornis. She
descendyd and caught her and held her still in her cleys. And the snayle
shrank in to the shell / so that the Egle in no wise cowde ete of her. That
seeing a crow said unto the Egle. Thowghe thou be mighty and king of all
birds / thou knowist not all thing. Hark surely therefore what I say and do
by my counsel / for that in the shell is very good mete and delycyows. Bear
the shell up an high / and let it fall and break / and so she did / and fownde
great swettenesse.

Of many Crepinge wormys and beastis. Dialogo. CXX.
THe Crepynge beastis and wormys upon the earth took there solace again the
son. But ye most venymows beast of all and most perylowse Serpente
Basiliscus of whom is made mencyon / in the dialogo.xli. lepte in among all
other and said with loud voice / Who is so bold that dare fight with me /
let him come and I shall fight with hi^. The snayle in his cotearmure came in
among all other / ready to fight again this serpente. And as they fawghte.
This Serpente labowryd to byte and to poison hi^. But she wisely drew in her
head and fete in to the shell / that the serpente cowde not towche her / and
aftirwarde when she espied advantage / she put out her hornys and cleys and
pricked this serpent. Whereof she had great shame. A little space aftir / this
forsayde serpent basiliscus fortified him self / and thowghte to excuse him
self of yt he had been shamefully ouircom / and said / I will avenge me.
Wherefore if there be any among all you yt is so bold to fight / I shall make
him gladly to turn his back and fle. The Irchyn full of spinis heringe this /
came forth in his harneys toward Batell. And when this forsayde Serpente saw
him / with great malice he came again him. This said Irchyn was hearty and
made sharp her prickis and smote them in to the serpent / and wowndyd him unto
the effusyon of his blood. This Basiliscus was faynte for angir and confusyon.
Among all other a frogge beholdinge this and thought to be auengid upon the
serpente / he l^pte upon him willinge to kill him. The serpent seeing the
frogge all nakyd and bare / without defense / and he him self was both weary and
hungrye / and to strength his body he cawght the frogge and swalowyd her in /
and said.

He fightith but faintely / that is not arayde
And he that has noon harneys may ever be afraid
By this we bet awght yt when we see our great enymyes somewhat ouerthrowyn /
we owe not sodeynlye to fall upon them / but to refrain / and to see the end.
For Seneca says. It is properlye the condicyon of a wyseman to dread his
enymye / though he be but weke. And therefore noman should rejoice the death of
his enymye / for dowghte of him self. For it is written prouerbi.xxiii. When
thyn enymye has had a fall / be thou not glad thereof. Nor be thou merry upon
the death of thyn enymye / lest there fall like iubardye upon the For he that
gretely reioycith upon the loss or hurt of his enymye / shall fall oftyn in
to loss and hurts / It is read that an Emperowre / had tway seruauntis / of
which oon was a taylowre / and the other was a barboure. The taylowre hatyd the
barbowre / for cawse the emperor had him more in fauowre. Wherefore he accusyd
him to the Emperor / that he should diffame hi^ and say that he might not
suffir the stench of his breath when he shauyd him. The Emperowr was sore greuyd
and commawndyd him to be cast in to the sea in a sack. And as the said
Emperor cast forth his hand poyntynge to the shippemen the place where they
should cast him / his signette of gold fell from his finger in to the sea. This
barbowre corruptid the shipmen with money / and by them he was conveyed to
far contreys and strange nacyons. where as he leuyd prosperowsly And upon a
day he bought a fissh / and fond the emperowrs ringe in the belly of the same
fissh / with the which ringe he came to the Emperowr / and gave it to him
excusing him self of the crime that was obiecte again him. And at the last
for a reward he desired that the taylowre that had ioyed of his death / might
be cast in to that same place of iubardye that he was / and so he escapyd. and
his enymye was destroyed / that hoopid he had destroyed him. Wherefore Seneca
says. look daily to have of other / as thou intendist to do to other And this
is oftyn prouyd by experience.

of man and woman. Dialogo. CXXI.


MAn aftir the saying of the Philosofre Is a mind incarnate. A Fantasye of
time. A beholder of life. A Ma^ciple of death. A walker going A dweller of a
place. A laboryows mind. An habitacle of small time. A woman as says the
philosofre / is the confusyon of man / A beast insaciable / a continual
business. a batell never endid / ma^nis ma^ciple and to a continent man
destruccyon / As upon a time it happid / yt a man which was clean and chaste
desired to have famylyarite / and speech with a woman. whereby he fell to
delectacyon and was cawght in the nettys of sin / and lightly lost the seal
of chastity and comytted dedly sin. For wha^ he attendyd unto the swettenesse
of her speech / and behyld the beawte of her face / he was overcome and
destroyde / and said.

Many mennys minds for women be broke
And wowndyd sorer then with other struck
Wherefore an Autowr spekyth and says / A Woman is the form of sin / and
condicyonyd dedly / Iheronie says. The gate of the Fend / The way of
wickedness. The struck of the Serpente / A noyable kind is the woman. That
same doctowr says / The beawte of woman is like a brinninge sword. Remembyr
yt Thamar was corrupt of her own brodir / and ever remembyr yt a woman put
Ada^ from his possession. who was strenger than Samson / wyser then Salamon /
more holy then dauyd / and all these were subuertid by women It is written
Eccle: xxv / The oryginal of sin began of a woman / and all men suffir death
/ by ye meanys of her / wherefore these old Fadirs and philosofirs were very
co^tynente and kept them self chaste / as tellith Vigecius libro secundo. of
the continence of alexander / yt wha^ a maid of most excellent beawte was
brought to him / which was weddyd to an other prince / he spared her / and
utterly abstaynyd him self from her / In so much yt he would not see her / But
sent her again to her husbond / and wha^ she was so remytted and sent again /
it pleasyd greatly ye minds both of her husbonde and of her / a like tale
tellith Valery libro quarto / cap / iii / of Scypione / saying yt wha^ he knew
yt a maid most bewtifull was among them of cartage yt were besegyd / which
was weddyd to a nobyll gentylma^ / after yt this Scipion had won ye cite he
called the Friends of the said maid / and also her husbonde before him / and
delyuerde her to him a clean maid / and all the Gold yt was brought to him
for rede^pcyon of her / he gave it to her marriage / wherefore ye hartys of them
were euir aftyr aplyed toward him / For his great chastity and bounteuous
largess / Valery also tellyth in yt same chapitle / of the meruelowse chastity
of zenocrates a philosofre saying / That on a time at athenys a compeny of
young men promised a great sum of money to a wantonly disposyd woman / if she
cowde corrupt the mind of the said philosofre and ynclyne it to lechery /
The which woman in the night time went and lay down by him. But in nowyse
she cowde prevail to hurt his chastity / and to the young men yt derydyd her
/ yt she cowde not bow his mind. She answered yt she had not go to no lively
man / but rather to a statue / or deed Image. She called the philosofre a
statue. For the great and immovable continence that regnyd in him.

Of Life and Death. Dialogo.cxxii.


AS says the Philosofre death is a perpetual sleep / dread of richemen /
desire of pouer men. An incurable hap the thief of man / the chacer of life.
Resolucyon of man. The life of good men is gladness. Of wretchis sadness / A
young man upon a time / that was in his flowris / both goodly of person.
Rich / strong / and hoole / went to death and said. O inevitable fortune /
have mercy upon me / and be deprecable unto me and suffir me never to be
punyshed / with the pain yt I look aftir daily fro the. For I shall give to ye
what someuit thou wilt have / that is to say. Gold / Silver / Precyows stonys
/ Seruauntis / horse / lands / lyueloade / Palacys / Possessions / all oonly
the to towche not me. To whom death answerde and said. Brother thou askyste
things impossible. Nothing should be desired of God / but honest and possible.
And therefore thou spekist not wisely. For it is said unto man. Death abydith the
every where. And if thou be wise / thou shall abide it in every place. For it
is written psalm. lxxxviii Who is that man that lyuyth / and shall not see death
/ as whoo says. Noon. Therefore receive me pacyently for I come to the to do no
noueltye. For Seneca says. Noman is so unwise / but he knowith he shaldye.
Nevertheless when death drawith nere he dredith and wepith. Why wepist thou
man. Why mournyst thou for cawse of death. To that thou were ordained and borne
what thing of new is done to the. To this law thou art born. This happid to
thifader / to thimoder / to thy bettirs also. and generally to all that have
been before the / and it shall not fail to come to all them that shall be. For
life is not geuyn to any creature with excepcyon of death. There is a law
universal / which ordeynith to be born and to dye all thing that berith life.
And also he says. We owe to suffir pacyently that thing that we may not escape
fro. Example of David that said when his child was deed. Now that he is deed
why do I fast. whether I may call him again. I shall rather go to him / for
he shall not return to me. When it was showed unto a philosofre that his son
was ded he answerde and said. when I gate him. I knew he should dye. Valery
tellyth li.v.ca.x. that Anaxagoras herynge the death of his son / said to the
messengere. Thou bring me no new tidings. Nor merue lowse. I knew him
mortal / as soon as I knew him born. For of the law of nature I have lernyd
life to be takyn and left. And no man can dye / but he that has leuyd. Nor no
man may live but he shall dye naturally / In the same place it is made mencyon
/ yt zenophon heringe the death of his eldest son which was slain in batell
was content / aloonly he put the crown from his heed / for he was doing
solemn sacryfice. And aftirward he inqueryd how his son dyed / and it was
showed him that he was slain most manly fighting and he swear by his goddis
to whom he did sacrifice yt he conceyuyd more gladness thereof / then henynesse
of his death. Saint Jerome tellyth that an holy woman / and most noble / when
her husbonde was deed who^ she especyally louyd and mournyd and his body lay
unburied in the same day of his buryinge she lost tway sons which she had
and no moo. I am to tell a thing incredyble says saint Jerome / but God by
witness not false. Who would not have trowyd / that she might a goone
pluckynge her brestis / her clothis teryng her herys down hanging / certainly
from her fell not a droope of terys. She stood immovable / and falling down
to the feet of christ / she held them and said / I am spedde good lord and
ready to thy service / for thou have dischargyd me of so great a burdon. It is
read also in the chronicles of Emperowrs / that the wise of Octauyan buried her
son named druse. And though she were a paynyme / nevertheless by the great
Natural sense that was in her / she put from her all the tokyns of merowre and
heaviness / that were in her and said. What profit is to dread that may not be
reuokyd / wherefore Seneca says / a wyseman is not afflycte for loss of his
children or friends. For in such mode he may sustain there death / as he daily
awaytith for his own. And truly the Remembrance of death is like a brydell
refraynynge a man that he efflowe not to much / and Rynne in the great bread
of couetyse and lechery. The meditacyon of death. Is most great philosofre as
says Plato. Wherefore it is told in the life of Saint Iehan the ampuere. That
in the old time aftir that an Emperowre was crownyd / by the Eleccyon of his
Lords / Immediatelye masons / and makers of tombis went unto him and said. O
Emperowre of what stone or metal wylt thou command thy grave to be made.
They showed this unto him that he should know and remembyr that he was
transitorye / and but a corruptible man / and that he should think on the well
of his soul / and gide the reeme wisely and vertuowsly / aftir ye saying of
Scripture Eccle.vi. Remembyr thy last thingis / and thou shall never sin.
Alfonse tellyth in his tretyse de Prudencia. That when Alexander was deed and
to him was made a Sepulcher of Gold / many philosofres came thedir togider.
And oon of them said Alexander made his Tresowre of Gold / and now in
contrarywyse Gold has made Cresowre of him / an other said. Alexander
yisterdaye ruled people / and now people may soon Rule him / an other said.
yistirdaye alexander might have delyueryd manyon from death. This day he cowde
not escape from the dartys of death that were cast to him. an other said.
alexander yistirdaye led a great host. This day of them he is led to his
grave / an other / yistirday alexander pressyd the earth. This day he is
pressyd of the earth. an other. yisterdaye much people dredde alexander / this
day they despise him. an other. yisterday had many friends. this day al be
equal with hi^. an other. yisterday to hi^ sufficid not al ye world / this day
is he content with a grave of.vii. foot long. He that inwardely would oftyn
consydre this / should be refrained from the foul apetyte of sin. It is
said of a living man / that he shallbe destroyde at last / and rote like a
downghil. Job.xx. Therefore it is commaundyd Ecclesiast.vii. Remembir the end.
For it is bettyr to goo to an hows of lamentacyon and wepinge / than to an hows
of welfare and gladness. For there as is mourninge / the last end of every
Creature is remembryd. And a man thinkyth what shall fall to him self / that is
to say that he shall come to such an end. Therefore attend ye and consydre
well that in the death of every creature / the noose waxith cold / the teth
black. The face waxith pale / the vaynys and synowys of the body break. The
heart as it is said deuydeth a sondir for great pains. All the lymmes and
membris wax dry / and styfe like Timber / and stoonys / Nothing in all this
world is so abominable and tedyows as is a deed corpse / It is not cast in to
watirs for cause of infeccyo^. It is not hangid in ye air / for corrupcyon.
But like poison most perylows / It is cast in to a pytte no more to be seen /
and earth is lyghtlye cast on it. Behold the joy of the world how it endith.
It is closyd in a most stynkynge dyche. where the heart consumyth. The Iendrye
up. The erys fall from the head. The noose rotith from the face. The tongue
stynkith in the mowth. The heart putrifieth in the body. But alas alas good
lord to me. what should these yen delyghte to see fair things. The erys te
here vanyteys. The noose to smell sweet things. The tongue to speak foul
things and unprofitable. The mowth to taste sweet things. The heart to think
vain and vile things. wherefore Bernarde says. why art thou proud / thou
asshyn and duste. The concepcyon of the is sin. Thy birth is mysery. Thy life
is pain / and death is great angwyssh. As this Figure shewith. Not oonly of
sympel power wretchis / but also of al manner of noble estatys / both Emperowr
king and knight which must change this transitory life / and follow the
Dance of death / through age his heart is heavy / his head akyth / his spirit
is vexyd / his breath stinkith his face ryuelyth / his back stowpith. His Ien
wax dymme. His erys Run. His Herys fall away. His teth stink / He lesyth
his strenghtis. Now is he glad Now is he sad / Now is he syke. O miserable
and wretchid condycyon. why beholdist not thou the mysery of this mortal life.
Consydre where by thy genytowris thy friends and antecessowris / that occupied
here before the. and bernarde says. Tell me where be the lovers of this would
/ that in short time paste were here with us. Nothing remaynyth of them / but
oonlye asshyn. and therefore I pray the / tell me where be the Barownys. Where
be the princes and rulers / Where be the prymatis. Certainly they be passyd
like a shadow / and come to nothing / also saint augustyn sait^ Goo to the
grave and take up the bonys / and discern if thou canste / which was a
lord. which was a servant / which was fair / which was foul. which was
rich / which was pouer / which was wise / which was Idyote / and thou may
not know in nowyse. Therefore remembyr fro whense thou comyste / and be ashamyd
/ where thou art / and make mournyng / whedir thou goyste / and be aferde /
that thou may come to that celestial place above. From the which thowe art
now expulsyd / which that most blessid lord grant unto us that lyuyth and
regnith eternally. amen.
