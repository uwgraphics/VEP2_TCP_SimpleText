HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT royal blazon of the House of
Stuart
By the King. A Proclamation against the false dying of Silk.
WHereas the Trade of Silk within this Realm, by the importation thereof raw
from foreigne parts, and Throwing, Dying, and working the same into
Manufactures here at home, is much increased within a few years now past, and
the same is likely to be much more enlarged, to the enriching of this Kingdom,
and the setting of many thousand poor people on work, unless the deceitful
handling thereof, do bring the same into discredit, and destroy the reputation
thereof, and thereby deprive the Land of so hopeful a Trade, when it has
near attained to the perfection thereof.

And whereas it has been lately discovered in Our Court of Star Chamber,
that a notable abuse has crept in by the Fraud and Couetize of some ill
disposed persons, (some of which have already been deservedly punished by the
just Sentence of that Court, and the rest of the offenders shall surely be
prosecuted for an example to all others) by adding to the weight of Silk in
their Dye beyond a just proportion, by false and deceitful mixture of the
ingredients used in the Dying, whereby, besides the unjust increase of the
weights, the Silk is weakened and corrupted, and the color made worse, to the
great abuse of Us and Our Subjects, and to the apparent overthrow of the whole
Trade, if the same be not speedily prevented.

We taking this into Our Princely consideration, and esteeming it a work
worthy of Our Royal care, have thought it fit by this Our public
Proclamation, utterly to forbid the use of all such deceit and falsitie in
Dying of Silks, and for the present to prescribe some probable Rules to be
observed, for the preventing of the like abuses hereafter, until upon serious
and mature deliberation, We, by the advice of Our Counsel, shall be able to
make a more absolute reformation.

In the first place therefore We do straightly charge and command, That no
Silke-Dyer do at any time hereafter use any Slipp, Alder-barke, filings of
Iron, or other corrupt or deceitful matter in dying of Silks, either black,
or into Colors, whereby the weight of the Silk shall or may be increased,
upon pain of Our high displeasure, and of such further pains and punishments,
as by Our Laws, or by the Sentence of Our Court of Star Chamber, or by Our
Prerogative Royal, can or may be inflicted upon the offenders; And if any
Silke-man, Silke-weauer, or other person using the Trade of buying or selling
of Silk, either in gross, or by retaile, either by the skaine, or other
weight, or which shall convert the same into Lace, Ribben, Buttons, Points, or
other Manufactures, or shall use the Trade of buying or selling the same so
converted, shall be privy and consenting to such deceit in Dying, or knowing
the same to be so falsely Dyed, shall buy, receive, or put the same to sale,
or utter the same to any other, Every such offender shall incur the like
punishment as the Silke-Dyer himself should undergo by the intention of this
Our Proclamation.

And to the end that all good means may be used, which may further this
reformation intended, We further straightly charge and command, That no Silk
shall be dyed of any other Black, but of that color and dye called or known
by the name of Spanish black, and not of that Dye which is called or known by
the name of London black, or light weight.

That no Silke-Dyer do dye any Silk before the Gum be fair boiled off
from the Silk being raw, so that the pound of Raw silk, which before the
Gum boiled off was sixteen ounces, be reduced to twelve ounces, or
thereabouts, when the Gum is boiled off.

That no silk weighing a pound before it be put to dying, and after dyed into
Spanish black, do exceed sixteen ounces after it is dyed; And that the
pound weight of Silk of Italy dyed into black, do not exceed fifteen ounces
when it is dyed, with half an ounce at the most for remedy.

That no pound weight of Silk which shall be dyed into these sadd Colors
following, (viz.) Liuer-colour, Deroy, Tawny, Purple, French green,
Gingerline, Dear color, Orange color, or light Russet, shall exceed
thirteen ounces when it is dyed, and half an ounce at the most for remedy.

That no pound weight of Silk which shall be dyed into other colors, which
are called Light colors, exceed twelve ounces when it is dyed, and half an
ounce at the most for remedy; And that no Galls be used in the dying of those
light colors.

That no pound weight of Silk which shall be dyed into Grain colors, do
exceed thirteen ounces when it is dyed, and half an ounce at the most for
remedy.

That no pound weight of Silk which shall be used, as white, or light Yellow,
for Silver and Gold thread, shall exceed twelve ounces, without any addition
for remedy.

That the Throwster do not add any Gum, Sirrops, or other deceitful stuff
to increase the weight before it go to the Dyer.

That no Broker sell any dyed Silks, unless the owner himself appear in
person, and own the same, that he may be answerable for the abuse in dying,
if there fall out to be any.

That all Stuffes made of Silk, be marked with the proper Mark of the Weauer
thereof; And that no person buying Silk, do Dye his own Silk.

And We straightly charge and command, That the Lord Mayor of London, within the
City and Liberties thereof, The Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Company
of Dyers of London, (as far as by their Charters they are enabled) and all
other Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Bailiffes, and other head Officers
within their several Jurisdictions in all parts of this Kingdom of England,
and Realm of Ireland, do use all diligence to search, find out, and prevent
all the abuses in false or deceitful Dying of Silk, according to the power
they already have to that purpose, and according to the direction of these
Presents; And such abuses being found, that they discover the same to the
Lords of Our Privy Counsel, or to Our Attorney general for the time being,
to the end that the offenders may be punished for the same.

And because it were in vain to command the true and honest Dying of Silk
within this Realm, and suffer silk falsely Dyed beyond the Seas to be
imported, We do straightly charge and command, That no man be so hardy as to
bring into these Our Realms of England or Ireland, or any Port, Haven, Creek,
or place thereof, any Silk deceitfully Dyed with increase of weight, upon
pain of forfeiture thereof, and of such further punishment as may by Law be
inflicted upon them.

And lastly, because there is at this present much Silk in the hands of many
persons, which has been falsely Dyed as aforesaid, We do straightly charge and
command, that all such Silk be transported out of these Kingdoms before the
first day of December now next coming* And if after that day any such false or
deceitful Dyed Silk, either already so Dyed, or hereafter to be so died,
shall be found in the hands of any person whatsoever, besides the punishments
aforesaid, the Silk it self shall be burnt, and utterly destroyed
wheresoever the same shall be found.

Given at Our Court at Farnham, the ninth day of August, in the sixth year o^
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXX.
