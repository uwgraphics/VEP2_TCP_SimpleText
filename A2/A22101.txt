By the King.
A Proclamation concerning the bringing in of Whale-finnes into his Majesty's
Dominions, etc.
AS We conceive, it cannot be construed by any Our doings or proceedings, that
We are carried with any ambitious or unjust appetite, to covet that which
appertains to others: So it shall be always Our desire and resolution, to
nourish and maintain the happy estate of Our loving Subjects, and the honor
of Our Kingdoms; not only in the same degree, in the which we have received
them; but likewise with that increase and advancement, whereof the providence
of Almighty God by just occasions shall put means and opportunities into Our
hands; and in nothing more (next unto the true worship of God, and the
administration of Justice) then in the maintenance and increase of Navigations,
wherein Our kingdoms both by situation, strength of shipping, skill of
Narriners, value of Commanders at Sea, and many honorable discoueries and
exploits, have for long time, and more and more of late time flourished. And
whereas Our Company of Merchants for the discovery of new Trades, commonly
called the Muscouia Company, have with their great costs and charges, of late
yceres discovered a Land, which they call by the name of King James his
Newland, to the increase of Navigations and Mariners, and have further by their
care and industry entered into a trade of fishing for the Whale, and procured
Biscainers, skillful in striking the Whale, teach and Instruct the English
Nation therein: And whereas a principal part of the beuefit of the
Whale-fishing consists in the commodity of Whale-finnes, imported into Our
Kingdoms; And that experience already shows, that Our own subjects in their
return from that Fishing, are able to furnish and serve Our Kingdoms with
sufficient quantity for the use of Our loving subjects: it being also a matter
of deliracie, and rather to be considered as it may concern Navigations, then
in it self: We have therefore thought fit for the better encouragement of the
said Company, and other Our Subjects, in services of like nature, to Prohibit
all Aliens and strangers, and also Our own subjects, (except the says
Muscouia Merchanks, and that in their joint stock) to bring hereafter into any
Our Kingdoms the said commodity.

Wherefore we do by these presents, straightly and expressly forbid and prohibit,
all Aliens and strangers whatsoever, and also all Our own Subjects (others
then the said Muscouia Merchants, and that in their joint stock) to bring into
any Our kingdoms, and Dominions any Whale-finnes, upon pain of Confiscation
of the same, and of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further
punishment, as shall be meet to be inflicted upon the offenders for their
contempt in that behalf: And We do further hereby charge and require all Our
Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers and other Officers, and also the Farmors of
Our Customs, and their ministers, carefully to attend every one in their
several duties, the execution of this Our Royal Proclamation, and in no wise
to permit or suffer any Whale-finnes, either directly or indirectly, openly or
privately, to be brought into the Ports, or other places of any of Our
kingdoms: And in case any be brought in, the same to seize to Our use, and by
all other means to find out, and inform of all offenses tending to the
breach of this Our Royal Proclamation.

Given at Wansted the eleventh day of September, in the twelfth year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. 1614.

Majesty ANNO DOM. 1614
