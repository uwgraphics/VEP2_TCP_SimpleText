The Description and Use of a Joynt-Rule fitted with Lines for the ready
finding the Lengths and Angles of Rafters, Hips, and Collar Beams in any Square
or Bevelling Roofs at any Pitch.


FIrst, The Rule is an ordinary Joynted Rule of a foot long when shut together,
or two foot being opened to a straight Line. And the Lines delineated thereon
for this purpose, are

1. First, a Line of Lines, drawn Sector-wise from a center on both legs of the
Rule, but continued to 30 at the end in stead of 10 the old usual manner, and
every fingle Integer of the 30 is divided into 12 parts, to represent every
particular inch of the 30 foot according to the common reckoning by feet and
inches.

2. There is another Scale of equal parts also, of the same length lying as
near to the other of 30 as may be, on one leg only, which is divided into 40
parts, to represent 40 feet: and each of those 40 feet, parted into 6 parts to
represent every two inches only, because the room for one foot, will not admit
of more parts.

3. In the same place on the other leg is divided a Line of natural Sines and
Tangents to 45, but numbered as a Line of Chords to 180 Degrees, to set the Rule
to, or to find the quantity of any Angle, in the proper terms of expression
(all the world over) degrees and minutes.

4, On the innermost Line of the 30 Scale that runs to the Center is set 20
pricks, beginning at 2 at the Center-pin at 30, and so proceeding with 3, 4, 5,
and 6 at the Center-pin at 15, and then 7, 8, 9, 10, and so forwards to 20,
toward the Center, which serves to divide a Circle into any number of parts,
very useful and ready in the practice of Drawing or Architecture.

Thus much for Description, the Uses follow.

The uses of this Line of Lines, or Scale of equal Parts to 30, drawn from the
Center is of a general and manifold use: as Mr. Gunter in his Book of the
Sector has showed.

A brief touch whereof take in the first place, as by the way, and then the use
of the Rule to the business intended.

And for the better doing hereof, it is needful to explain three or four terms,
for the avoiding of many words, and needless repetitions in this brief, yet
plain Discourse.

1. First by the word Lateral is meant any distance taken, either in feet and
inches, on the 30 Scale; or degrees and minutes on the Chords, taken and
counted from the Center, in the midst of the head of the Joynt-Rule, a long any
one leg: as thus; Suppose I would take out 15 foot Laterally, set on point of
the Compasses in the Center at the head, and open the other to 15 on any one
Leg on the 30 Scale; this extent I call a Lateral Extent of 15 foot. Also if
you takethe Lateral Chord of 60 Degrees you shall find the extent of the
Compasses from the Center to 60 to be the same as from the Center to 15 foot,
on the 30 Scale of Feet and Inches.

2. By the word Parallel, I mean any distance taken, by setting one point of
the Compasses in any number of feet and inches on one Leg, and the other point
in the same, or any other number on the other Leg, across from one Leg to the
other; as thus the Rule being opened then the extent of the Compasses from 20
on one Leg, to 20 on the other Leg, is a Parallel extent.

3. In all Parallel Extents, you must set one point of the Compasses in the
Common Line on one Leg, to the Common Line on the other Leg, which Common Line
is that only of the 30 Scale which runs to the Center, in which the Center-pins
at 15 and 30 are.

4. The nearest distance from a point to a Line is only thus: Set one point of
the Compasses in the point given, and open or shut the other being turned
about, till the other will but just touch or cleave the Line, that I call the
nearest distance.

Use I.
To lay down a line, that shall represent any Number of Feet and Inches given
or required.
Take the Number given laterally from the 30, or 40 Scale from the Center, and
that is the Line required.

But if these Scales are too great, or too small, then take your Number of
parts and the length thereof Laterally.

As for Example suppose I would have 3 Inches to represent 30 Foot, take out 3
Inches between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in 30 and 30, and the 30
Scale is set to your desire.

Use II.
To Increase or Diminish a Line to any Proportion.
Take the given Line between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in the
parts thereof; then the parallel extent of the parts you would have it
Increased, or Diminished to, is the Augmentation, or Diminution, which was
required.

Example.

Let 3 Inches represent 8 foot, and to the same proportion I would have 10
Foot, or 5 foot, viz. more, or less.

Take 3 Inches between your Compasses, and make it a parallel in 8, and 8 on
the 30 Scale; then the parallel distance between 5 and 5, does diminish the
Line, and the parallel between 10 and 10 does Increase the Line to the
proportion required.

Use III.
To divide a Line into any Number of parts or models under 30.
Take the given Line, and make it a parallel in the parts on the 30 Scale into
which you would have it divided, then the parallel extent between 1 and 1 shall
divide the Line accordingly, Example.

Let 4 Inches be a Line to be divided into 9 parts, take 4 Inches (or any
distance whatsoever) and make it a parallel in 9 and 9 on the 30 Scale; then
the parallel distance between 1 and 1 shall divide 4 Inches into 9 parts
required: Note, that for more exactness and convenience, you may Double 9, or
Triple 9, viz. 18, or 27. and then if you make the Line to be divided, a
parallel in Triple the Number you must take out 3 in stead of one, and that
shall divide the Line into the parts required.

Example, I would have 5 Inches put into 10 parts, take 5 Inches between your
compasses and make it a parallel in 30 and 30 the Triple of 10, then take out
parallel 3, and 3 the triple of one: and that shall divide the Line given being
5 Inches into 10 parts or models exactly: the like for any other. And note as
the Rule stands you may take out any number of parts or models whatsoever, to
that Scale.

Use IV.
Any two Lines given, to find their Proportion one to another according to any
other Number.
That the Lines severally, and lay them Laterally from the Center, on the 30 or
the 40 Scale, which you please; and the Numbers of Feet and Inches, to which
they reach, shall show their proportion one to another of the parts of the Line
on which they are measured.

Example, I have 2 Lines suppose one is 2 Inches long, and the other 5 or any
other unknown part.

Take 2 Inches the measure of one Line, and measure it Laterally on the 30
Scale, and it gives 5 Foot an Inch, then take out 5 Inches the supposed length
of the other Line, and it gives Laterally 12 Foot 8 Inches; then I say one Line
is 5 Foot and half an Inch, and the other is 12 Foot 8 Inches of a Scale of 30
Foot in 11 Inches 3 quarters length.

Or if you conclude on the Term or number of one Line, then make that Line a
parallel in the parts thereof, then take the other Line, and carry it
parallelly till it stay in like parts, on both Legs in the common Line, and
that shall be the Denomination of the other Line.

Use V.
Two Lines being given to find a Third in continual Proportion to them.
Take both the Lines, and lay them laterally on both Legs, and note the feet
and inches to which they do extend as in the last.

Then take out the lateral extent of the second Line, and make a parallel in
the terms of the first Line, keeping the common Line at that opening, then the
parallel extent from the terms of the second Line, shall be the lateral 3d Term
or Line in Proportion. Example,

Suppose I have one Line 3 foot long, and another 5 foot, and I would have
another to bear proportion to 5, as 3 does to 5 increasing, being in numbers
thus; as 3 is to 5, so is 5 to what? Here note that 3 is the first number, and
5 the second.

3. The first Line laid from the Center, on the 30 Scale, extends to 7 foot 7
inches, and 5 inches, the second Line gives 12 foot 8 inches.

Now the lateral second Line, viz. 5. or 12 foot 8 inches, made a parallel in 7
foot 7 inches the terms of the first Line, then take out the parallel extent
from 12 foot 8 inches (the measure of 5) and it shall give 21 foot 1 inch laid
laterally from the Center, for a third Proportional required; which, measured
on the inches, is 8 inches and a third, the answer required; for as 3 is in
proportion to 5, so is 5 to 8 and a third part.

But by the Line of Numbers, having the Quantity of the Lines given in Numbers,
do thus;

The Extent of the Compasses from the first Number 3, to the second Number 5,
shall reach the same way from the second Number 5, to 8. 33 the third
Proportional Number required.

Use VI.
To divide a Line in such sort as another Line is divided.
Take the whole Line that is divided, and lay it laterally yon both Legs, and
fit the Line that is to be divided parallelly in the ends thereof, then lay
every part of the divided Line laterally in like manner, as the whole Line was
laid, and the parallel extent between those parts shall divide the Line
accordingly: as for Example;

Suppose I would divide a Line of 8 inches long in such sort as the Line of
Circles on the inside of the 30 Scale is divided.

Take out 8 inches, and make it a parallel in 2 and 2, the divided Line, then
take out the parallel distance from 3 and 3, and that shall give the Point 3
from the end of the Line you would divide, and so consequently all the rest in
order. As far as you please.

Use VII.
To find a Mean Proportional between two Lines or Numbers.
Open the 30 Scale to a right Angle, by making Lateral 21 foot 2 inches a
parallel in 15 foot.

Then find the Sum and half Sum, the Difference and half Difference, between
your two Numbers; and having the half Sum between your Compasses, set one Point
to the half Difference counted laterally on one Leg; and wheresoever the other
Point shall touch the Common Line on the other Leg, is the mean Proportional
required. Example.

Suppose a piece of Timber be 10 inches one way, and 18 inches another, what is
the Square equal, which is the Mean Proportional between them? the sum of 10
and 18 is 28, the half sum is 14, the difference between 10 and 18 is 8, the
half difference is 4. Now the 30 Scale standing Square, taking 14 the half Sum
between your Compasses, and then fet one Point in 4 on one Leg; and turn the
other Point of the Compasses toward the Common Line, and there it shall show 13
5/12 near the Square equal required.

Use VIII.
To work the Rule of Three by the Line of Lines to 30, or to 3 Numbers given to
find a fourth, in Geometrical Proportion Direct.
Make the lateral second, a parallel in the first, then the parallel third
shall give the lateral fourth number required. Example;

If one foot of Timber cost 10 d. what shall 6 foot cost? facit 60 d.

Make Lateral 10 a Parallel in 10 counted as 1, then the Parallel Extent
between 6 and 6 shall reach to Lateral 60, the Answer required, (in pence).

Again, another Example:

If 50 Foot, or a load of Timber cost 44 s, what shall one Foot cost?

Take the Lateral Extent from 22 the half of 44 s, and make it a Parallel in 25
the half of 50, then the Parallel distance between 2 and 2 counted as 4 foot
shall give the Lateral Number of 3 s. 6 d. the price of 4 foot, whose fourth
part is 10 d. the price of one foot. Note this help is used, to avoid the
neerness to the center where the work is inconvenient.

Use IX.
To measure Flat Measure by the Scale of 30.
At any inches broad to find how much in length makes a foot.

Take Lateral 12, make it a Parallel in the breadth given, then take out
Parallel 12 again, and it shall give the length of a foot required.

Example, At 9 Inches broad, as Lateral 12, to Parallel 9, so is parallel 12,
to Lateral 16, the length required.

Use X.
The breadth of a Board given in Inches, and the length in Feet, to find the
Content in Feet and Inches required.
Take the Lateral length in feet, and make it a Parallel in 12, then the
Lateral distance, between the Inches broad, shall give the Parallel Content.

Example, Of 15 foot 3 inches long, and 9 inches broad.

Take Lateral 15 foot 3 inches, and make it a Parallel in 12, then take out
Parallel 9 and 9, and it shall give Lateral 11, foot and a half, the Content.

Use XI.
To Measure Timber by the Line of Lines to 30.
At any Inches Square to find how much makes a Foot of Timber.

If the Piece be not Square, then by the 8th Use make it Square: Then thus;

Take the Lateral Side of the Square in Inches, make it a Parallel in 12, then
take out the Parallel Side of the Square, and it shall give a Lateral 4th
Number.

Then take out Lateral 12, and make it a parallel in the 4th number, and then
take out Parallel 12 again, and it shall show the answer in Inches laid
Laterally from the Center.

Example, At 9 Inches Square what makes a Foot?

As lat. 9 to par. 12, so is par. 9 to lat. 6: Agair,

As lat. 12, to par. 4th viz. 6, so is par. 12, to 21 inches the length to make
one foot required.

Use XII.
The Inches Square, and Length given in Feet, to find the Content in Feet and
Inches.
As the Lat. Side of the Square, to parallel 12 so is the parlength to a lat.
4th: Again,

As the la^. 4th to parallel 12, so is the par. side of the Square, to Lateral
Content.

Example, at 9 Inches Square and 20 Foot long.

As lat. 9 to par. 12, so is par. 20 to lateral 15, a 4th number: Again,

As lat. 15 the 4th, to par. 12: So is parallel 9, to lat. 11, the Content
required.

Thus much for the General Use, being too long a Digression from the matter
mainly intended.

Use XIII.
The Breadth of any Frame being given, to find the Length of the Rafter and
Perpendicular by Inspection only.
It being a General received Rule, that the length of the Rafters should be
three quarters the breadth of the House (or frame) for true pitch, and 40 the
feet in one Scale, being equal in length to 30 the Number of feet in another
Scale, and 30 being 3 quarters of 40. Therefore,

If you seek for the breadth of the house on the 40 Scale, then right against
it, on the 30 Scale, is the length of the Rafter required. Also if you seek the
length of the Rafter on the 40 Scale, on the 30 Scale, right against it, is the
height of the perpendicular required, viz. from the Raising-piece to the top of
the Gable end or Rafter required.

Example, If a house be 30 foot broad, the Rafter ought to be 22 foot 6 Inches,
and the perpendicular 16 foot 9 Inches and a, for right against 30, counted on
the 40 Scale, on the 30 Scale is 22 - 6 the Rafter, and right against 22 - 6 on
the 40 Scale on the 30 is 16 - 9 the perpendicular.

1. Also by the Line of Numbers, the extent of the Compasses, from 20 to 15,
will reach the same way from the breadth of any house to his proportionable
Rafter at true pitch.

2. And the extent, from 20 to 18, turned the same way from any breadth of a
house to his proportionable Hip Rafter, in square frames.

3. Also the extent from 20 to 11 18/100 will reach the same way from the width
of any house to his proportionable perpendicular, at square and true pitch.

4. And the extent from 20 to 28 - 28, will reach from any other house breadth
to his proportional whole Diagonal Line required, at square and true pitch.

5. And the extent from 20 the breadth to 16 - 63 the nearest distance at that
breadth, shall reach from any other breadth to his proportional nearest
distance required, if it were needful. But the Angles in all Roofs great or
small, if true pitch and square, are the same in all Frames.

Use XIV.
The breadth of the house and the height of the Perpendicular being given to
find the Rafters length, the Hips Length, the Diagonal Line, from Corner to the
King-post, and any Angle required, in Square Frames. What the Perpendiculer
height of the Gable end ought to be at true pitch by the last Rule you may
readily see, and the better make estimate of the quantity of alteration. Which
being once Resolved on, then thus proceed,
First open the two 30. Scales to a Right Angle by making Lateral 21 Foot 2
Inches a parallel in 15, and 15 in the Brass Center pins.

1. Then count half the breadth of the house on one Leg, and the Length of the
Perpendicular resolved on, on the other leg, then the parallel distance between
them, measured Laterally from the Center, shall give the true length of the
Rafter required. Rafter.


2. For the Hips Length count the Length of the Rafter last found on one Leg,
and the half breadth of the house on Hips.
the other Leg, and take the parallel distance between, and measure it from the
Center, Laterally, and it shall be the true Length of the Hips required.

3. For the Diagonal Line, count the half breadth of the Diagonal.
house on both Legs, and take the parallel distance between, and measure it
from the Center, and it shall be the Length of the Diagonal Line, from the
Corner to the King-Post.

4. Again for the Hips count the Diagonal Line last found Hips Length.
on one leg, and the perpendicular height on the other Leg, and the parallel
distance between shall be the Hips true Length measured us before from the
Center.

Example, in a house of 20 Foot wide at true pitch. See fig. 1. let A B C D
represent a frame of a house 20 Foot wide, B I the half width, B A and C D
equal to B C the whole width being 2 points to draw the Diagonal Lines by. I E
being equal to I B, and the half E I laid from E to G gives I G the true length
of the Rafters, and G B or G C the Length of the Hips.

Or thus, Three quarters of C B, viz. C H, gives C F and B F, the Rafters
Length: the same extent also laid upon the middle Line from I to G, gives CG
and BG the Hips Length. IF is the perpendicular height, E is the point of the
Diagonal Line or King-post, perpendicularly opposite to or right under the
meeting point of the 2 Hips, and the two Rafters, when raised and set in their
places.

Thus much for Illustration what to do, now for Application how to do.

The width of the house is always given, the Length of the Rafter; or the
height of the perpendicular is next resolved on, which in our Example being
true pitch is also resolved on, either by inspection as before, or else by
operation in this manner.

1. The Breadth of the house being 20 Foot, and the perpendicular resolved on
to be 11 Foot 2 Inches To find the Rafters Length, work thus,

Open the 30 Scale to a Right Angle (by use the 7th) count 10 the half breadth
of the house on one Leg, and the For the Rafters length.
perpendicular height 11 2 on the other Leg. (viz. both on the 30 Scale from
the Center) and take the parallel distance between them, (on the common Line)
and measure it from the Center, and it shall give just 15 Foot the length of
the Rafter required C F.

2. But if according to the width of any frame, you resolve on the Rafters
length, and would have the perpendicular height of the Gable end, then thus,

Count the length of the Rafter from the Center, and take the lateral extent
thereof (being 15) between your Compasses, the Compasses being so set, set one
point in 10 For the Perpendicular.
the half width of the frame, and turn the other point parallelly to the common
Line, and there it shall show 11 Foot 2 1/7 Inches, the true height of the
perpendicular at true pitch required. I F 11 Foot 2 Inches 1/7.

3. For the Length of the Hips, Count the half breadth of the house on one Leg,
and the Rafters length on the other Leg, and take the parallel distance
between, and it shall give the true length of the Hips required. As here, the
parallel For the Lips Length.
distance between 15 and 10, shall be lateral 18, the true length of the Hips
required in a square frame 20 foot wide true pitch. C G

4. For the Diagonal line from the Corner to the King-post.

Count the half width of the house, viz. 10 Foot on both Half the Diagonal Line.
Legs, and take the parallel extent between, and it shall reach from the Center
to 14 foot 1 Inch being the line C E in the figure.

5. Otherwise for the Hips length, Count the half Diagonal on one Leg 14 1 and
the perpendicular 11 foot 2 In. Hip.
Inches 2 2/7 on the other Leg, and the parallel distance between, measured
from the Center, will give the true Hips length 18, viz. the line C G.

Thus much for the Rafters and Hips in square frames at true pitch, the measure
of whose Angles and Lengths are as follows, F. Inc. 100 parts F. 100 parts.

The Rule to find the Angles of the Rafters and Hips.
1. For the Angles that the Rafters make at Foot, and Head, with the
Raising-piece and King-post, do thus,

When the Rule stands square in the 30 Scale, then lay any straight piece to
the Compass points, when one stands in the half breadth, and the other point in
the perpendicular; then if you apply a Bevel severally, to that straight edge,
and the 30 Scale at each end, the one is the Angle at Foot 48 - 10, and the
other the Angle at Head, viz. 41 - 50.

2. For the Angle at Head or King-post and foot of the Hips, do thus, the 30
Scale being set square, set one point of the Compasses in the half
Diagonal-line; on one 30 Scale, and the other point in the perpendicular on the
other 30 Scale, and to those points lay any straight piece, then set a Bevel to
that Straight piece, and each 30 Scale, and the one shall be the Angle at Foot
38 - 22, and the other the Angle at the head, viz. 51 - 38; then this last
Angle doubled, and the difference between the Angle at Head, and Foot, viz. 13
- 16 added, makes 116 - 12 the Angle of the outside of the Hip-rafter in a
square frame at true pitch required.

3. A General way to find this outward Angle of the Hip or mould is thus, in
any pitch.

First, you must find the nearest distance from one corner to the opposite Hip
set up, or from a point in the raising piece, as far from one corner as the
house end is broad, as the point K or L in the Figure may be done thus,

Count the length of the Hip on one Leg, (and also take it between your
Compasses) and count the breadth of the house on the other Leg, and set one
point of the Compasses in the Hips length on one Leg, and the other point in
the breadth of the house on the other Leg altering the 30 Scales, but not your
Compasses; then when the 30 Scales are so set, one represents the Raising
piece, and the other the Hip set up.

Then the nearest distance from the breadth of the house on one 30 Scale, to
the Common-line on the other 30 Scale, is the nearest distance required being
measured from the Center, 16 - 7 -

Then take the whole Diagonal Line, viz. C L, or B K from the Center Laterally,
and make it a parallel, in the nearest distance last found; and that shall set
the 30 Scales to the Angle of the outside of the Hip required, which you may
measure in degrees thus: take parallel 15 as the Rule stands, and lay it from
the Center, and it shall reach to 116 Degrees on the Chords, next one 30 Scale,
the Angle of the outside of the Hips required.

Example and more briefly in a House 20 Foot broad.

The house end is 20 Foot broad the whole Diagonal Line is 28 foot 3 inches,
the Hip Rafter 18 Foot.

Take 18 Foot between your compasses, and set one point in 20, and open or shut
the Rule till the other fits 18, then the nearest distance from 20 to the
Common Line will be 16 foot 7 inches 4/8.

Then take 28 foot 3 inches, the whole Diagonal Line, and make it a parallel in
16 foot 7 inches the nearest distance, and the 30 Scales are set to the Angles
required: For,

If you take out Parallel 15 the Chord of 60, and measure it Laterally from the
Center, it shall reach to 116, the Angle in Degrees and Minutes required.

Note, If the whole breadth and whole Diagonal Line is too large for your
Compasses, then the half breadth and half Diagonal will do as well, (taking the
half length of the Hip also between your Compasses, and on the Scale also) and
that shall set the Scales to the same Angle as before.

Use XV.
To find the Lengths and Angles of the Rafters and Hips, or Sleepers, in
Bevelling Frames at any Pitch.
1. For the length of the Rafter, set the 30 Scales square, then count the half
length of the bevel-end on one Leg, (being always more there than the half
breadth) and the Perpendicular resolved on, on the other Leg; Then the Parallel
distance between, measured laterally, shall be the length of Rafter.
the Rafter required, and a Ruler laid to the two Points of the Compasses so
set on the 30 Scales, and a Bevel set, as before in Square Frames is showed,
shall give the Angles at head and foot required.

2. For the Hips length, count the Rafters length on one Leg, and the half
breadth of the bevel-end of the House, more by half the number of inches
bevelling on the other Leg, and take the parallel distance between, and Measure
it Laterally Hips.
from the Center, and it shall be the length of the longest Hip-Rafter. And for
the shortest Hip count less than the Bevel-end, by half the number of Inches
bevelling, and that shall be the short Hip required.

3. The Inches, or Feet and Inches of Bevelling being given, to find how much
one corner is under, and the other over 90 Degrees (or just Square) open the 30
Scales, and take the breadth of the House over at the nearest distance, between
Angle of the Frame.
your Compasses, from the 30 Scale from the Center laterally, and make it a
parallel in 15 and 15 for 60 of the Chords.

Then take the Feet and Inches Bevelling from the same 30 Scale laterally, and
carry it parallelly till it stay in like parts; then just against it on the
Degrees or Tangents are the Degrees and Minutes required, that one corner is
more, and the other less than 90 Degrees.

4. To find the Diagonal Line.

Take the distance in the Chords to the Degrees above, or under 90 last found,
from the Center Laterally, and make it a Parallel in 15 and 15, and then the 30
Scales are set to the Angle; the end is over, or under 90 Degrees: Then count
Diagonal Lines.
the whole or half Bevel end on both Legs, and the Parallel distance between
shall show the length of the whole, or half Diagonal Line measured from the
Center.

Note, That when the Rule stands at the Blunt Angle, it gives the longest
Diagonal Line, and when it stands at the Sharp Angle, it gives the shortest
Diagonal Line.

5. By the Diagonal Line and Perpendicular to find the Hips Length, and the
Angles at Head and Foot of the Hip or Sleeper.

Count the half Diagonal on one Leg, and the Perpendicular Hips.
height on the other Leg, (the 30 Scales being square) then the Parallel
distance between, shall be the length of the Hip required, being longer or
shorter, as the Diagonal Line is.

Also a Rule laid to the two Points of the Compasses measuring the Parallel
Extent, and a Bevel laid to the Rule, and Angles of the Hips.
the two 30 Scales, at each end, gives the Angles at head and foot of Hips
required.

To find the Nearest Distance from the Corner of the Rombus to the Opposite Hip
set up in his true place.

6. Count the length of the Hip on one 30 Scale, and take that distance also
between your Compasses Laterally, count also on the other 30 Scale the length
of the Bevel end, and there set one point of the Compasses, and open or shut
the Nearest Distance.
Rule, till the other point falls in the length of the Hip-Rafter first counted
(then one 30 Scale Represents the Raising Piece, and the other the Hip set up)
then the nearest distance from the breadth of the Frame over, at the Bevel end
and more, or less, by half the Feet and Inches Bevelling, to the Common Line of
the other 30 Scale, being measured from the Center shall be the nearest
distance required.

To find the Angle on the Outside of the Hip.

7. To find the Outside Angle of the longest Hip, Take the shortest Diagonal
Line between your Compasses, and make it a Parallel in the nearest distance
belonging to that Hip, and the 30 Scales will be set to the Angle required, and
to measure it take Parallel 15 and 15, and measure it Laterally from the Center
in the Chords; and you shall have the measure Outside Angle.
of the Angle required.

Example; In a House of 20 foot over at nearest distance, and 4 foot or 48
inches Bevelling out of Square. See fig. II.

Let A B C D represent a Frame 20 foot over, and 4 foot Bevelling, the
Bevel-end B C is longer than right over by 5 inches; for if you set the Rule
square, and take the parallel extent from 20 the measure over, to 4 foot the
measure of Bevelling, and measure it Laterally, you shall find it reach,
Laterally to 20 foot and 5 inches, the true length of the Bevel end.

The Bevel-end being 20. 5 inches the Perpendicular resolved on, which at true
Pitch ought to be about 11 foot 5 inches, Fere. Then first for the Rafters
length.

1. Set the 30 Scales square, and set one Point in 11. 5 the Perpendicular, and
the other point in 10 foot 2 the half Bevel-end; (and to the Compass-Points,
lay a Rule, and to the Rule and the 30 Scales at both ends set a Bevel, and one
shall Rafters Length and Angles.
be the Angle at foot, the other the Angle at the top of the Rafter: And the
one Angle will be 42 Degrees for the foot, and the other 48 for the top of the
Rafters) and the measure between the Compasses measured from the Center shall
be 15 foot 4 inches, the Rafters length required.

As by Inspection on the 40 and 30 Scales you may see.

2. For the longest Hip set one Point in 12 foot 2 inches and more by two foot,
then 10 foot 2 in. the half Bevel-end, and the other Point in 15. 4 the Rafters
length, and measure it from the Center, it gives 19 foot 6 inches the longest
Hip.

Again, Set one Point in 8 foot 2 inches 2 foot shorter than the half
Bevel-end, by 2 foot the half of 4 foot the Bevelling, Hips Length.
and the other Point in 15 foot the Rafters length, and measure it from the
Center, it gives 17 foot 4 inches the length of the shortest Hip.

3. For the length of both Diagonal Lines, set the Scales of 30 to the Angle of
the Frame at each corner, and the measure from the half, or the whole Bevel-end
taken Parallelly, shall be the length required of the half or whole Diagonal
Line, according as you take the whole or half Bevelend.

As here in our Example the Blunt end is 101 gr. 30 min. Diagonal Lines.
or 11 30 more then 90 gr. therefore take the distance from the Center to 101.
30. on the Chords, and make it a Parallel in (15 and 15) the Chord of 60, then
is the 30 Scales set to the Angle of the Blunt-end of the frame, and the
Parallel distance between 20-5 the whole Bevel-end gives 31 foot 6 inches, the
whole Diagonal Line, B L, or the Parallel between 10-2 give 15-09 inches B E
the half.

Again, The sharp end is 78. 30 11 degrees. 30 less then 90, then the Lateral Chord
of 78. 30. made a Parallel Chord of 60 (at 15): then is the Rule set to the
sharp end of the Frame, for the shorter Diagonal Line. And the Parallel
distance between 10-2 gives 12 foot 11. the half, or 25 foot 10 inches the
whole Diagonal Line C F, whose half is C E the shortest whole and half Diagonal
Lines.

4. For the Hips Length, and Angles at Foot and Head.

Set the 30 Scales Square, and count the shortest half Diagonal 12 foot 11 on
one Leg, and the Perpendicular 11 foot 5 on the other Leg, then the Compass
Points so set, lay a Rule Hips length.
and take the Bevel at both ends, and it shall give the two Angles at head and
foot of the shortest Hip, and the same distance of the Compass Points shall be
17 foot 4 inches fere, the Hip Hips length and Angles.
length, as before, and the Angle at the top 48. 30 and at foot 41* 30 his
Complement.

Again, Set one point in 15 foot 10 the longest half Diagonal, and the other
point in 11 foot 5 inches the Perpendicular, and lay a Rule to them, and set
the Bevel to both ends, and you shall find 54 gr. the Angle at the top, and 36
the Angle at foot, and the distance between the Compasses laid from the Center,
gives 19 foot 6 inches the longest Hip.

5. For the Outside Angles of both Hips, the longest first.

Take 19 6 between your Compasses the Hips length from the 30 Scale: Set one
point in 20 foot 5 the Bevel-end, and close the Rule till the other Point
touches 19. 6 the Hips length.

Then take the nearest distance from 18 foot 5 (2 foot less Outside Angle of
long Hip.
than 20 foot 5 the breadth of the Bevel-end of the frame), to the other 30
Scale, and it is the nearest distance from the Point of the Rombus A to the Hip
B G setup, 15 foot 9 inches.

Then take out 25 foot 10 the shortest Diagonal, and make it a Parallel in 15.
9 the nearest distance, and then the 30 Scales are set to the Angle required;
for the Outside of the Long Hip, being 110 degrees for Parallel 15 measured
laterally on the Chord, gives 110-0.

6. For the Outside Angle of the Shortest Hip.

Take 17 foot 4 inches between your Compasses, and set one Point in 20 foot 5
the Bevel end, and open or shut the Rule till the other Point reaches 17 4 on
the other 30 Scale. Then Outside Angle of short Hip.
the nearest distance from 22 foot, 2 foot more than the breadth of the Bevel
end of the Frame to the Common Line on the other 30 Scale, and that shall be
the nearest distance from L to C G the shortest Hip set up, which is 18 foot 9
inches.

Then take out 15 foot 10 inches the half greater Diagonal Line, (because 31
foot 8 inches is more than the Scale of 30) and make it a Parallel in 9. 00 the
half of 18 foot, and the 30 Scales are set to the Angle required, viz. 122
degrees; for if you take out parallel 15, and measure it in the Chords
Laterally, it shall be 122 the Angle required.

Note here by the way, the length of the Bevel-end, and the two Diagonal Lines,
and the halfs of them, and the Blunt and sharp Angles of the Frame, are given
by the draught of Fig. III
the Frame, and they being first known, the work is half done; but if not
given, then use these Directions, which will help you to see the reason of
Plain Triangles, and the use of the Scales.

Use XVI.
To find the Rafters, Hips and Angles in Bevel and Taper Frames, being broader
at one End that the other. See Fig. III.
First, when the Frame is broader at one end than the other, then the middle
breadth is to be the guide for the Rafters length, and the Perpendicular to be
equal to the middle Rafters perpendicular on both ends; though one pair of
Rafters is longer than another, and the Roof in winding thereby: Which winding
may many times be remedied by some convenient artifice or other, a, the
ingenious workman will soon perceive. As thus in brief:

Let A B C D represent the Frame of a House Bevelling at both ends, and broader
by 2 foot at one end than the other; as here in the Bevelling figure, being 20
foot on one side, and 24 foot on the other side at one Bevel-end 10 foot 4
inches, and at the other end 8 foot 1 inch but at the nearest distance over,
only 10 foot, and 8 foot.

First, for your more apparent fatisfaction, draw the true form of the Frame by
as large a Scale as you conveniently can, with the Sides and Angles as exact as
you can, as A B C D; then draw the middle Line E F quite through the length,
and G H through the breadth of the Frame Perpendicular one to the other, then
measure G H as suppose 9 foot, then lay off the half of G H from H to I and K,
then take out of G H, and lay it from K and I to L 6 foot 9 inches for a pair
of middling Rafters for this Taper House, L G being the common Perpendicular at
the middle and both ends of the Roof, 5 foot o inch of an inch.

And for the Principal Rafters, or other Rafters open the To find the length of
the very Principal (or single) Rafter in a Taper Frame.
30 Scale square, and then count the Perpendicular 5. 0. on one Leg, and half
the distance between the Rafter-feet or half breadth of the Frame at that place
on the other Leg; and the Parallel distance between shall be the true length of
the Rafter required.

Then for the Hips length, first, Make A M and B M equal to A E or B E at one
end, and make C N and D N equal to D F or C F and draw the lines M M and N N at
both ends, also make A b and B b equal to A B, and C a and D a equal to C D,
and draw the Diagonal Lines A S and B S, and C O, and D O, at each end
extended, and set down the measures of them.

These Lines being drawn you have the half Diagonal Lines A S and B S, and C O,
and D O, and may measure them by your Scale, to find their Lengths, or set the
Rule to the Angles A E S and B E S, find them by the 30 Scale; also you have
the Bevel ends of the frame, and the nearest distance over from side to side of
the frame.

Then for the Hips Length and Angles thus,

Set the 30 Scales square, and count the perpendicular height L G on one Leg 5
- 0 - and each half Diagonal Line, etc. one after another on the other Leg, and
the Parallel distance between shall be the true length of the several Hips
required, Example,

The Parallel distance between 5 foot - 0 - Inches the common perpendicular
counted on one 30 Scale, and 8 foot 1 Inch, the longest Diagonal line A S
counted on the other 30 Scale shall give 9 foot 6 Inches for the Length of one
Hip A P Laterally.

And the Parallel distance between 5 - 0 - the common perpendicular, and 6 foot
6 Inches the other Diagonal line B S shall give the Lateral measure of 8 foot 3
Inches, the length of B P, the other Hip-rafter for the broadest end of the
frame A B.

Again, the parallel distance between 5 - 0 - the common perpendicular, and 6
foot 4 Inches the greater Diagonal Line C O at the narrowest end shall give 8
foot 1 Inch for the Hip-Rafter C P. And the parallel distance between 5 - 0 -
the prependicular and 5 foot - 0 - Inch. - 0 the Lesser Diagonal Line D O shall
give 7 foot 2 Inches for the Hips Length D P to stand over the Diagonal Line D
O.

Note also that if to the Compass points standing parallelly you lay a Rule,
and to the Rule (so laid) and the 30 Scales at each end a Bevel, and set it
according to the Rule and 30 Scales, it shall give the true Angle of the Hips
at the Raising-piece and King-Post, which 8 Angles in these 4 Hips are expressed
by the Lines and Letters in the Scheam thus. P A S and P B S, P D O and P C O
the 4 Angles at the Raising Piece. And S P A and S P B O P C and O P D, the 4
Angles at the King-Post.

Whose length you may prove by Mr. Pope's excellent way, making S P and O P
equal to L G on the extended Diagonal Line, and drawing the Lines A P, B P, C
P, D P for the 4 Hip-Rafters length required.

Or for more proof thus also by the Rule, as before in Square Roofs.

Set the 30 Scales Square, and take the Parallel Extent, from 7 foot 2 - - the
Rafters length at the broader end, on one 30 Scale, to 6 foot 2 inches more,
then the Bevel-end by 1 foot the half quantity of Bevelling, and it shall give
9 foot 6 inches for the Hip A P, and from 7 - 2 - - to 4 - 2, one foot less
than the half Bevel-end, to 8 foot the Hip B P. Also the Par. Extent from 6
foot 5 - the Rafters length at the lesser end, to 5. foot 0 - one foot more
than 4. 0 - the half little Bevel-end, shall give 8 - 1 - for the Hip P C. And
the Extent, from 6 - 5 - 4/8 the Rafters length, to 3 - 0 1 foot less than the
half Bevel-end, gives 7 - 1 - the Hip D P, as before.

Note, That by the working these 3 ways, you may be sure to prevent any
mistakes that may happen in working one way only.

Lastly, For the Angles on the outside or backs of the Hips.

Take every several Hips length Laterally between your Compasses, and set one
Point in the length of the Bevel-end, (or rather in a mean between A B the
Bevel-end, and M M at the greater end, or C D and N N at the lesser end) and
open or shut the 30 Scales till the other Point falls on the Hips length that
you work for, then for the longer Hip count more, and for the shorter Hip less,
by half the inches Bevelling, then the whole breadth over, at the end, and take
the Parallel nearest distance from thence to the 30 Scale for a nearest
distance, which nearest distance you must keep.

Then take the whole Diagonal Line Perpendicular to the Hip, wrought for (viz.
the shortest Diagonal Line for the longest Hip at each end) between your
Compasses, and make it a Parallel in the nearest distance last found, and then
the 30 Scales are set to the Angle of the back of the Hip required.

Example in this Figure for the longest Hip.

Take 9 foot 6 inches, the Hips length A P between your Compasses, and set one
Point in 10 foot one inch (a mean between A B 10 foot 4, and M M 9-10) and open
or shut the Rule, till the other point stands in 9 foot 6, the Hips length
first taken. Then the nearest distance, from 9 foot 4 inches, one foot less
than 10 f. 4 inc. the Bevel-end distance over, to the other 30 Scale shall give
7-10 a nearest distance from the Point b to A P the Hip raised over A S the
Diagonal.

Then the Lateral Extent B b of the whole Diagonal Line 12 f. 7 inc. being made
a Parallel in 7-10 the nearest distance last found, shall set the 30 Scales to
the Angle at R the back of the Hip required measured by taking Parallel 30, and
measuring it Laterally on the Chords it is about 108 Degrees.

Secondly, Take 8 foot 4 inches, the other Hips length between your Compasses,
and setting one Point in 10 foot one inch as before, open or shat the Rule till
the other Point falls in 8. 4. the Hips length.

Then the nearest distance from 11 foot 4 inches, one foot more than 10 foot 4
inches the distance of the Bevel-end to the Common Line of the other 30 Scale
shall be when measured Laterally from the Center 9 foot fere, for a nearest
distance.

Then 15 foot 8 inches the longer Diagonal Line being made a Parallel in 9 foot
fere, the nearest distance last found, sets the 30 Scales to 121 Degrees the
Angle required, the back of the shorter Hip required.

The same work serves for the other end, being near the same Angles: Which you
may prove by Mr. Will. Pope's excellent way thus: find the middle between S and
A, or S and B at Q, then the nearest distance from Q to B P or A P near lay to
R, and draw the Lines R E, R M for the Angles at R the back of the Hips
required.

Moreover if you raise 4 Perpendiculars cutting the Points O and S, the 2
places of the King-posts being Perpendicular to the raising Pieces A C, and B
D, as the 4 Pricklines S, S, O, and O do show, and lay the length of each Hip
from his proper corner A B C D as A P from A to and. B P from B to and, D P
from D to and, C P from C to and, then draw lines from point to point, as in
the Figure.

Then and are the two Ridges when turned right over O S, and C D is the least
Hip, and A B is the greater Hip, as Mr. Pope has well showed. Thus much for
Hipt Roofs.

Use XVII.
To find the Length and Angles of every Principal Particular Rafter in Frames
broader at one end than the other.
The Perpendicular, as before was hinted, is to be the same all over the Roof.
Therefore open the Rule square, and take from the Perpendicular on one Leg, to
the half breadth of the Frame on the other Leg, measure it from the Center, and
that is the length required. For the Angles lay a Rule to the compass Points,
and set a Bevel, as before is showed, and you have the Angles at the
Raising-Piece, (and Ridge of the House), to cut the Rafters feet by.

The same Rule serves to draw out a pair of well Stairs, to give Hypothenusaes,
or strings, at any particular height and breadth; for the 30 Scales set Square,
and the Perpendicular height counted on one Leg, and the breadth on the other
Leg, the measure between is always the Hypothenusa, or string in flying Stairs,
as may plainly appear.

Use XVIII.
To find the Length and Angles of Collar Beams in any Roof.
Take the whole breadth of the Frame between your Compasses, and set one point
in the length of the Rafter on one Leg, and the other point in the same place
on the other Leg: then the two Legs represent the two Principal Rafters, and a
Rule laid to the Compass Points represents the Raising piece; then at any
height that you please above the Raising-piece, apply a Rule parallel to it,
and the measure between laid from the center, gives the length, (remembering to
add wood for the tenons) and a Bevel laid to the 30 Scale and Rule, gives the
true Angle to cut it by, (where the Timbers be square.)

Use XIX.
To find the Lengths, and Angles, of Rafters, and Purloyns in Bevel Frames.
The Length of the Rafters is showed before, to find it by the half breadth of
the Square or Bevel-end, and the perpendicular answerable to that Roof, (as
afterward in the Example.) And the Angle of the Foot, and outsides or backs of
the Bevel-end Rafters, and the upright of the Gable end, must be to an Angle
less and more than 90 degrees by the Angle at the Corner of the frame where
that Rafter is to stand, being more at the sharp Angle and less at the blunt
Angle, as in figure IIII you may see; the true quantity of which Angle is thus
found by the Rule.

Take the Length of the Rafter for the Bevel-end in Feet and Inches, and make
it a parallel in 15, then half the quantity of Feet and Inches Bevelling, taken
from the same Scale and carried parallelly till it stay in like parts, shall
show right against it in the Tangents the Degrees and minutes required.

And this is the Angle that the blunt corner is to be laid in Legement more
than a square, and the sharp Angle less than a square or 90 degrees, both out
of Level, and out of square also, when you tumble or stripe in, the tenons of
the purloins, the thing desired.

Example. Fig. III


Let A B represent the Bevel-end of a frame, being out of square from the Line
A C 6 Foot as the line C B shows, then if A C be 20 foot, A B will be 20 foot
10 Inches. Then draw E L the middle Line of the frame, and G M and H K, the
Lines at three quarter of the breadth of the frame, then take E D the half
Bevel and lay it from G to F and from H to I, and draw the Line; A F and B I,
for the outside Lines of the two Bevel-end Rafters: and the two other Lines
parallel to them, according to the breadth or scantling of your Bevel-end
Rafters, as here in the figure 8 Inches broad. Thus the Lines A F, and B I,
represent the two end Rafters, laid in Legement to fit in the purloins, as for
their lying out of square from the Raising pieces. And to the same Angle they
are to be laid out at Level, that the cutting of the purloin ends may fit the
Rafter sides, when erected in their places, according as the ends F and I of
the Bevel-end Rafters are, according to the Angles A F G and A F M the one
being 11 degrees and 20 minutes under, and the other 11, 20 above 90 degrees.

Also, Note that if P K, and O M do represent a pair of square Rafters, at any
intended distance from A, then T S and R Q will give the true Length of the
purloins fit for those places, R Q being the shortest purloin and T S the
longest purloin.

To find by the Rule only how long the purloin must be on the outside more or
less than the distance on the Raising pieces, where you intend the two square
Rafter feet shall stand, do thus: set the 30 Scales to the same Angle that the
Bevel-end Rafters lie out of square, when they lie in Legement, to frame which
here is to 11 degrees and 20 minutes.

Then count from the Center the quantity of Feet and Inches you intend to make
the mortise holes from the Rafter foot, in the Rafters, for the tenons of your
purloins; and take from thence to the nearest distance to the other Line, and
that shall show the quantity that the one purloin is to be longer, and the
other shorter, than the distance between the Rafter-feet on the Raising pieces,
Example thus,

Set the 30 Scales to the Angle G A F, then count A S the place for the mortise
hole from A on the Rafter, and take the nearest distance from thence to the
other 30 Scale that shall give S V, the quantity how much T S is shorter than A
O, and how much R Q is longer th^n P B.

Note, that if you count 3 quarters of 20 foot 10 Inches, being the length of
the Bevel-end, that then you will make the Rafters too long by 4 Inches and a
half, as in the figure you may see: therefore the surest way to find the
Rafters length is to set the Scales to a square, and then to take the parallel
extent from the common perpendicular, to the breadth between the place for the
Rafter feet, on the Raising piece: So that the length of the Rafters for the
Bevel-end at true pitch, is A F 15 foot 3 Inches, and not A W 15-7-, which is
just 3 quarters of A B the Bevel-end over which the two Rafters are to stand.
For then the top of the Bevel-end Rafters would be too high for the top of the
square Rafters being cut Just 15 foot, three quarters of 20 foot the breadth of
the frame.

Use XX.
The use of the Scales to lay down or measure out on Paper, or Board, the
Members and parts of the fine Columns, and their Ornaments, with their names
and measures, digested into a Table, for the more ease and use of workmen.
For the drawing of the fine Columns and their Ornaments is largely before
treated of in the former part, by models minutes and quarters, and considering
the harmony between it and our Scales to 30, that are parted into 12 parts, so
that when every figure or foot, on the Scales to 30 represent a model, then
every Inch is 5 Minutes; and for small paper draughts, that way of counting is
near enough, but when you use it for a bigger draught, that the whole scale of
30 may represent 3 models only: then every figure will represent 6 minutes, and
the 12 Inches between are half minutes: but in very great work as in Temples,
or Castles, then the whole foot or scale to 30 may represent half of one model
only, and then every figure or foot is a minute, and every Inch or small
division is the 12th part of a minute; for I count it to be a large Column,
whose Diameter at the base (which is a model) is above 3 foot, and by this
manner of computation which is natural to most scales, the scales to 30 may be
rendered convenient for small, or moderate, or large uses, as in the following
Examples may somewhat appear,

In Reading of which you must have recourse to the former figures whose members
are marked with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and which figures direct you to the names
in every of the columns which I found to be wanting in the former part, so that
the method here used is thus,

1. The first Column in the Table is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12, etc. answerable
to the figures on the 6th figure, in our present Example, which will straight
way guide you to the meaning of the names or terms in the Table by comparing
it and the figure together, whereby you may readily find every part or member
and it is proper name.

2. The second Column is the names of the part or Member in the gross and
particular also, as the Pedistal, the Base, the Shaft, the Capital, the
Architrave Frieze and the Cornish, are the names in gross; the other are the
names of the members in particular.

3. The third Column in the table is the several measures of the particular
members, in Models, Minutes, and quarters, as in the figures, though more
easily to be seen than in the figures, because of the straightness of the Room
there,

4. The fourth Column in the Table is the measure of every particular part and
member from the pedistal base or bottom to the top of the Cornish, being useful
in small draughts where the whole pillar is expressed.

5. The fifth Column in the Table is the several measures of every particular
member of each gross part, being useful when you draw large draughts of any
work or part thereof.

6. The sixth Column in the Table is the measure of the projecture of every
particular part from the middle line of the Column (or from the smallest or
most inward part of the pillar the rest being subtracted) but I Judge the
middle line to be the best Epoch to begin the account of projecture for the
convenience of the Compasses: and this Table of projectures as all the rest is
to models minutes and quarters; as by trial you may see at one view what each
gross part and every particular part is.
