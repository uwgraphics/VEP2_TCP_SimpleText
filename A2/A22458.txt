CHARLES By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting.
WHEREAS We are given to understand, by the Lords and others of Our Privy
Counsel, that there are a great number of the Inhabitants of the Isle of Ree,
together with their Wives and Children, professing the true Reformed Religion
with us, who out of a just apprehension, and fear of the malice and cruelty of
their enemies, practiced against them in former times upon all occasions, have
abandoned their own Country, their Houses and Estates, and other earthly
Commodities, and have withdrawn themselves into this Our Realm, and under Our
protection, for the security of their persons, and more free exercise of their
Religion. And that very many of them are in great distress, especially
occasioned through the suddenness of their leaving their own homes and
liuelyhoods; We being moved with a Princely and Pious compassion toward
them, as fellow Members of the true Church, and with comfort remembering the
charitable and hospitable refuge and relief, which Our Dominions have in
former times affoorded to all such Strangers, who have suffered for the
profession of the Gospel, And that the religious practice of this Christian
duty to others, will, by the blessing of God, be a means to preserve Us, and
Our people from the like distresses, And taking notice that the Lords, and
others of Our Privy Counsel for the inciting of the Charity of others, have
rated themselves to such a proportion of bounty and relief to these distressed
Strangers, as may give encouragement to so charitable a work, which example
We earnestly desire, that all other of Our loving Subjects, according to their
degrees, would chearefully follow. KNOW ye therefore, That We, of Our
Princely grace, do order and grant, that a Collection be made of the
charitable devotion, and liberality of all Our loving Subjects throughout Our
Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, in all places whatsoever, as well
within liberties as without, toward the relief and succor of the said poor
Inhabitants of the Isle of Ree, living dispersed and distressed in sundry parts
of this Our Realm, as in Plymouth, Southhampton Portsmouth, and in the City
of London, and elsewhere to be executed and ordered in manner and form
following: That is to say, We will, grant, appoint, and require, that Sir
William Becher Knight, one of the Clerks of Our Privy Counsel, shall and may
procure to be printed so many Briefes of these Our Letters Patents, as may
suffice for the accomplishing and performance of this good work, and shall
carry and show these Our Letters Patents, under Our great Seal, to the Lord
Bishop of London, and shall also leave with him so many of these printed
Briefes, as there be Churches of Chapels, wherein public or Divine service
is usually said within the circuit or precinct of the several Provinces of
Canterbury and York. And We require the said Lord Bishop of London to receive
the said Briefes, and to send and distribute them with speed unto every
Archbishop and Bishop within these Our Dominions, so many of the said Briefes,
as are requisite within their several Diocesses, the said Briefes to be sent
by the said Archbishops and Bishops to the Minister and Curate of every Parish
Church and Chapel within their several Diocesses. And We also will and
require every Minister or Curate of every Church or Chapel to whom such
printed Briefes shall be delivered that without any long delay, upon some
Sunday or Holy day, when the Parishioners be there fully assembled to hear
Divine Service they publicly declare in their several Church or Chapel unto
the Congregation there assembled, the tenor of these Briefes, with an especial
exhortation unto them to yield their liberal and extraordinary Contribution
to so charitable a work. And We also will and require you the Churchwardens
and overseers of the poor, to make diligent Collection of the charitable
devotion of the people within the said Church or Chapel so assembled, and
that after Collection so made, you do publicly declare in that Church that
whole sum of money so by you collected, and then procure the same sum to
be set down on the backeside of the said Brief under your hands, and the
hand of the Minister of the said Church or Chapel; And then that you the said
Churchwardens, or Overseers, or one of you, after the receipt of the money so
collected, deliver the same together with the Brief unto such Minister of the
Deanery, where the said Collection shall be made, as the Lord Bishop of the said
Diocese shall assign or appoint to receive the same. And We do hereby
require and authorize the Bishop of every Diocese to name and appoint one
fit and able Minister in every Deanery to receive the said Collections
accordingly. And We also require you the said Minister which shall be so
appointed to receive the said money from the foresaid Overseers, that you
receive the same with the aforesaid Brief, and that within ten days after
the receipt thereof, you pay and deliver the same with the Brief, whereby the
same has been collected, unto the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, where such
collection is made. And We also require you the Archbishops and Bishops of
every Diocese respectively that you receive of the said Minister the said
money with the Briefes, whereby the same has been collected, and deliver over
all the said Collections, which have been so made within the several
Diocesses, to the Lord Bishop of London. And we likewise require you the Bishop
of London, to transmit wihtout delay to the said Sir William Becher, or such as
he shall appoint under his hand and seal, all the sums of money so
collected within the several Diocesses, taking a receipt for the same under
his hand. And We hereby require and command the said Sir William Becher, to
distribute the same to the said poor distressed Strangers, according to such
directions as from time to time the Lords and others of Our Privy Counsel
shall give therein. All which for the furthering of the said charitable work
without any diminution, We require to be performed by all the persons
employed therein, without any deduction of charges, and to be justly and duly
executed, any Statute, Law, Ordinance, or provision heretofore made to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding. In witness whereof We have caused these
Our Letters to be made Patents for the space of two years from the date hereof
to continue.

Witness Our Self at Westminster, the fourth day of January, in the third
year of our Reign.
