A lamentable Ditty composed upon the Death of Robert Lord Devereux, late Earl
of Essex, who was beheaded in the Tower of London, on Ashwenesday in the
morning, 1600. To the tune of Welladay

SWeet Englands pride is gone,
welladay, welladay,
Which makes her sigh and groan
evermore still:
He did her fame advance,
in Ireland Spain, and France,
And now by dismal chance,
is from us taken.
He was a virtuous Peer,
welladay, welladay,
And was esteemed dear,
evermore still:
He always helped the poor.
which makes them sigh full sore
His death they do deplore,
in every place.
Brave honor graced him still.
gallantly, gallantly,
He nere did deed of ill,
well it is known,
But Envy that foul fiend,
whose malice nere did end,
Has brought true virtues friend
unto his thrall.
At Tilt he did surpass,
gallantly gallantly,
All men that is and was
evermore still:
One day as it was seen,
in honor of our Queen,
Such deeds has nere bin seen,
as he did do.
Abroad and eke at home,
gallantly, gallantly,
For valor there was none,
like him before.
In Ireland, France, and Spain,
they feared great Essex name,
And England loved the same,
in every place.
But all would not prevail,
welladay, welladay,
His deeds did not avail,
more was the pity:
He was condemned to die,
for treason certainly,
But God that sits on high,
kneweth all things.
That Sunday in the morn,
welladay, welladay,
That he to the City came,
with all his troops:
That first began the strife
and caused him lose his life,
And others did the like,
as well as he,
Yet her Princely Majesty,
graciously, graciously,
Has pardon given free,
to many of them:
She has released them quite,
and given them their right,
They may pray day and night,
God to defend her.
Shrevesunday in the night,
welladay welladay,
With a heavy hearted sprite.
as it is said:
The Lieutenant of the Tower,
who kept him in his power
At ten a Cloak that hour,
to him did come.
And said unto him there
mournefully, mournefully,
My Lord you must prepare,
to dye to morrow.
Gods will be done quoth he,
yet shall you strangely see,
God strong in me to be,
though I am weak.
I pray you pray for me,
welladay, welladay,
That God may strengthen me,
against that hour:
Then straightway he did call
to the Guard under the wall
And did entreat them all
for him to pray.
For to morrow is the day,
welladay, welladay,
That I the dept must pay,
which I do owe:
It is my life I mean,
which I must pay my Queen
Even so has Justice given,
that I must dye.
In the morning was he brought
welladay, welladay,
Where a Scaffold was set up
within the Tower:
Many Lords were present then,
with other Gentlemen,
Which were appointed then,
to see him die.
You Noble Lords quoth he,
welladay, welladay,
That must the witness be,
of this my death:
Know I never loved Papistry,
but still did it defy,
And Essex thus will dye,
here in this place,
I have a sinner been,
welladay, welladay,
Yet never wronged my Queen,
in all my life:
My God I did offend,
which grieves me at my end,
May all the rest amend,
I do forgive them.
To the State I nere meant ill,
welladay, welladay,
Neither wished the Commons ill,
in all my life:
But loved all with my heart,
and always took their part,
Whereas there was desert,
in any place
Then mildly did he crave,
mournefully, mournefully,
He might that savor have,
private to pray:
He then praid heartily,
and with great feruency,
To God that sits on hie,
for to receive him.
And then he praid again,
mournfully, mournfully,
God to preserve his Queen
from all her foes:
And send her long to reign,
true Justice to maintain,
And not to let proud Spain.
once to offend her.
His Gown he slipped off then
welladay, welladay,
And put off his hat and band,
and hung them by:
Praying still continually,
to God that sits on hie,
That he might patiently,
there suffer death.
My headsman that must be,
then said he chearefully,
Let him come here to me,
that I may him see,
Who l^^^led to him then,
art thou quoth he the man,
Which art appointed now,
my life to free.
Yes my Lord did he say,
welladay, welladay,
Forgive me, I you pray,
for this your death,
I here do you forgive,
and may true Justice live,
No foul crime to forgive,
within their place.
Then he kneeled down again,
mournfully, mournfully,
And was required by some
there standing by
To forgive his enemies,
before death close his eyes,
Which he did in hearty wise,
thanking them for it.
That they would remember him
welladay, welladay,
That he might forgive all them
that had him wronged,
Now my Lords I take my leave,
sweet Christ my soul receive,
Now when you will prepare,
for I am ready.
He laid his head on the bloke
welladay, welladay,
But his Doublet let the stroke,
some there did say;
What must be done quoth he,
shall be done presently,
Then his doublet off put he,
and lay down again.
Then his headsman did his part
cruelly, cruelly,
He was never seen to start,
for all the blows:
His soul it is at rest.
in heaven amongst the blessed,
Where God send us to rest,
when it shall please him.
FINIS.
