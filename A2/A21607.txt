the voycs of god in paradys treres tree to mow them ghewe them Wnderstondyng
that he Was not content With them in that they kepyt not his conmandeme^t et
spak to them by a interloqui tur by twys them and for this cause they did go

Mythe fow lych Waes thanswer Wenyng the displesyr of god Was in that he Was

That is to say the Woman thou did gheue for my co^paygon presentyd me the
fruit of knowledge of good and ewil et did ^yt. That down god did spek to the
Woman. Cur hocfecisti. Quhey^for did chowso. The Woman not excusy^g her self
blan^^t the serpent and s^cretly god almighty by ^aue of the serpent than seeing
owr s^ed god that the dewil had comp^ist all his Wyle^ that he had propos

to the thread ^e falsely desenyt owr first parens et forthys cans meryt the

Inimieitias ponam inter te et mu^^iere / ipsa conteret caput tuu^ et tu infidia

Wolf and the doge i^ lykewyes sholbe et Wys man and the serpent With out eynd

parens Was nakyd thewr that they Wa^ cursyd: the serpent ewer more to theynd of
the World shall feys a nakyd man et ^epithe and rynth of a man clothyd. Owr
mother eve synnyt i^ two thyngys and first i^ pride Secund in that she did eyt
of the fruit inhybitet for that sho Was proud god almighty correctyt her With
humilite and did gheue y^. The sentens agyens her fayeng. Sub potestate viviri

pain of him in thy defloration et shall be sugget be fayt thar as thou Was
aloonly bo for by loyf et amor et their as the Woman synyd i^ ettyng the fruit
so i^ lykwys sho is punyshyd by. Justice of god in beryng the finyt of her body
saying. In dolor paries. Et in thays Wordys god almighty did gheue on cursyng
et on hyshyng the cursyng that as ye said / thou shalbeyr thy child in sorrow.
The blessyng thar as he said thou shalbeyr thy child et so the iustys of god
apperyt of Ways full of myserycord^. Adam synnyt aloon in o^n thing that is to
say in ettyng the fr^yt and there for he Was punyshyd in pain and labo^ et al
ye of speyng that Was et shall be heyr after qwyche is to We oon cursyd thing et
to that We most principally obey to the conmandyme^t of god that ye to sers all the thyngy one qui^yd to his lyef. Be the Word god fayd to adam. M^ledicta
terra, yat ye to say the earth is cursyd by thy^ operacion be the qwyche
operation Was understand the syn of adam et for thyr causys that adam did
trespass i^ habunda^s of al manyr of fruyttes. Bot new in greyt penuryty et
scarnes et Were oftyntymes yt did beyr preciows fruyttys is new hab^ndys in
b^^rys and thornys foloth the Word of god to adam. Et comedes herbas terre.
Like as he Wald say thou shall be lyk the bestys brutal in that thou shall eyt
therbys of the earth. This parfayt god almighty cursyd the earth et not the
Watyr in so myche the tra^sgressio^ vaes maid by the fruit of the earth and not
of the Watyr Et for this cause owr saweur jesus christ dydeyt fyche bot We red not
that ewyr he did eyt flech bot a loonly the pascal for keeping the commandment
of the law. Et yt felothe. In sudore Wltus truveseeris p^ne tuo doner i^ terram
reuertaris. That is to say adam thou shall eyt thy breyd in the sweyt of thy
Wysage Wnto the time thou return to the earth that is to say qwyllys thou
depart out of this World. Quiaterro^s et in terra^ ibis. Thou ye ^^the^ et thou
shall twine in ertht. O father Adam this Was a merwelus sentens yat if thou
hadyst a bid in iustys original in innoce^^ et obediene / et kepyt the Ways
and the conmandyme^tys of god almighty the sowerayn makar the formyt the of
noght thou hadyst beyn immortel et ascendyt into bewen both body et saoul. Bot
new after the syn thou is constreynd to oun myseyr unto another et newer he in
rest lyk un to the Water the qwyche ewirmore rynneth insessantly With out any
rest. At the last adam pleynyng the Wrachythnes and mysere of him self and his
lynayge that should cum after him cayllyd and named is Will eu^ that Was ^amyd
vyrago as We have said before this end did. God almighty did make them cloythis
of the skynnys of beyd bestys by caves they sh^^d the fine of that deyd ly^ys
that they acquityd by there syn folothe the Word of god fayd to y^onee. Err
adam factus est quasi vnus ^^nobis Lyk as he Would a said adam Wald have beyn
maid lyk to us. Bot yt is now euydent yt is not fo. For he has grerneid to
know his imparfection and fragilite. The Wyche is the voys of the holy trinite
corekyng ma^kynd of his pride / ore^^^ ill made Wnderstond the voys of god
almighty spekyng to the angels / or yt is the Woy^ of the holy trinite pleynyng
the myseyr or transgression of adam. Of this Wys We have maid adam lyk oon of
Ws as to the immortalyte if that he Wald apersyst and contynuyd in the estayt
of innocens and obedyans. Bot be cause he Would na^ et that he hatht commit the
syne origynal in dysobeyng us. N^ forte mittat man^^ suam et sumat de ^igno
vite and admed^^ et viua^ in eternum. That is to say by the / ^t rayson ada^put
his hand and did tayk of the fruy^ of lie. For that he shall not live ewet
lustynly lat Ws put him forth of paradys. Alas hard and dreyful semyth the
sentens of god almighty qwyche suffyd not to have panyshyd man be pain and
labor corporal. Bot also by the election of paradys for ewermore. Newertheles
the said punyshon Was not With out myerfy by that he mesuryd the pain of adam
ghewyng exampyl to us Cum itatus fueris misericordie recordaberis. Qwan thou
shall executte thy iustys lat yt be mesuryd With mercy et miserycord. Et verily
understanding that owr for ancyteurs oght to live in pain et myseyr there
dymerytys there for the longer they lyeff should have beyn in so myche longer
they should have labeur and pain. Et so We may co^sydyr that if ada^ et Eve had
eyt of the fruit of live they should have lyuyt myche longer et so myche they
had beyn more miserabyl qweyr for god almighty did cast them forth of paradys
unto the feyld of damask there as adam Was maid that he might travel et labeur.
There after there miserabyl eyection from paradys. Qwer Was al pleysyr and
delectacion did god almighty cloys the portys With fire to the eynd / no man
should enter and commyt the angel cherubin he should deffend yt et from the power
of the dewyl that he did not enter Et the said fire for a spays of time Was tak
a Way to that cause Enoch and Helye might enter et also yt Was enteyrly quynsyd
at the passion of owr sawoyr et redemptur jesus. If yt be aschyd how long Adam
et Eve Was in paradys. The common opinion says yt Was aloon the time of fewyn
howrys et other docteurs says three howrys bot With out dowt they War not there
long. Also a curyo^s questyon if thou ash. Qwat Was the cause god almighty
permyt man to be tempyt of dewyllys / et that offendys ageyns commandment / to
fythe questions is. The common solucion et answer is that so yt plesythe god
almighty qways Will most be compleyd et that answar content him not / et he ash
mor ower qwat is the cause god Wald so et no notherWyse / he most Wndersto^d
that the Wyllys of god is the most suffycyand and the moist greet cause of al
other. Et With rayson lat him by content. We most consydyr that after adam et
Eve Was put forth of paradys ada^ had carnel knawlege of eve. For in paradys
terrestre they War botht parfyt Weyergens et the.xv. ear after adam had achyld
named caym a dow three namyt chalmana and e Will say he Was formyt in the age of
thretty ear that is Wnderstond a long imperfeccyon of nature and notght in
process of time. Et may Weel by that he had moy before Cayn netherles the maker
of the law Moses makys no mention of them after other.xv. ear he engendryt
Abel et his sister dellora the ear a hondreth and thretty of adam. Cayn slew
his browther Abel by enwy in the feyld of damask. Vvher lyuyt Adam and Eve in
trystes and sorrow The spays of a hondrethe ear in a Wallew callet lermes besyd
the mont of ebronet that en dydyd. Owr father adam know carnally his Wife Eve
et so engendryd seth and We most Wndestond that of the lynayge of cayn came.
Enoch that enge^dryd yrad / et yrad enge^dryd manan / et manan mathusael / and
mathusael engendryd lameth the qwyche Was ewyl et the.vij. after adam. The said
lameth had two Wyffys ada and sela and in is doong qwyche did commyt adwltery
ageyns the law of nature et the decret of god. The With did gheue to adam a
loonly o Wyff. This lameth Was punyshed grewonsly by the said Woman he blyndyt
et mowrdret his awn son cayn / the Wyche cayn et lameth thar generacions
peryshyd in the deluge. Seth engendryd Enos / Enos engendryd Caynam the qwyche
engendryd malael / malael engendryd Iareth / et is Iareth engerdryth enoch the
qwyche Was the sewynt of adam i^ the generation of the said seth he Was just
et pleysyd god in holiness. Et Was tra^slatyt in paradys. Et veritably the
generation of Cayn foresaid Was ywyl lameth foresaid of contrare the.vij. of adam
i^ his generation of Seth Was right just the said Enoch engerdryd mathusalem
the Wyche engerdryd oone other lameth qwyche engerdryd Noe the.x. after ada^
right iowst et of good live Wnder the qwyche Was maid the deluge by Watre the
two thousand ear after the creation of the World. Et certys owr first father
ada^ the Wych Was holy all the days of his live and had the ghost of
propheycye. did mayk great pennans in this World / et did ghewe his chylder
commendyme^tys of good live Et of justice / and commandment that they should
absteyng from the company of cayn et of his chylder. Et they should not mayk no
maryages With the said chylder of cayn. bot for the said chylder of cayn did
not keyp the conmendeme^tys by that they did tak Wyffys of the lignage of cayn
ageyns the prohibicions paternalys. The Wyche Was merweusly lycherous god the
maker said that he should efface the earth not oonly the men bot With that the
bestys et al other creatures / by the synnys et byrnyng carnalytys et lecheryes
the qwyche regnys abowff the earth bot god Would not do this Wythowth misericord
et meyrcy for he gheue them a hondreth.xx. ear to do pe^nans. Et Was done or not did mayk the arche and i^ the end of the hondreth ear god send abowndans of
Watres et deluge on the eyrthe the qwyche drownyt al creatures of the eyrth.
Except noe et his three chylder came / sem / iaphet and thar iiii. Wyffys et the
bestys the qwyche noe had put Wytht in the arche by the commandme^t of god. Et
yt is good to notte that the pain that god did send yt Was co^uenabl et right /
for charnel volupte habu^dit a bouf the eyrth the Wyche the bodyees of men
Warpollut et sowllest abouf the earth et by this cause the erht Was Weshyng et
clengyd be Watrys / bot i^ the end of the World that cupidite et auarys shall
habu^d / al shall be clengyd be fire. Certes gold na silver that are cause of
auarys et of cowstu^ to be purget be fire. O miserabyl and damnabyl Wrechydnes
of avarice how myche soowlys thou has led to perdicion et damnacion eternel sen
the said deluge Was maid by Watre. Woe should heyr notysy that the soowllys of al
them qwyche drownyt and Was maid after the creation of the said adam and not
oonly they soowllys of the^ that trespassyt after the said deluge unto the
resurrexion of jesus christ et also after the creation of the said adam unto the
forsaid resurrexion rynneth fywe. thousand two hondryth thrytty et two earys or

of holy fathers that Was i^ the lymbe. Abydyng the meyrcy of god the createwr
and as We have show by the cawse that adam et Eve offendyt in commission of
sin orginall ageyns the commandment of god Was shet et closyt thentre of
paradys i^ that manner Ne sowl ne for virtue no ryghtusnes no other goodness might

IN this present cheptur We shall say first that the orayson dominical is callit
the Pater noster. Ama^g al others things et oraisons yt is the most exelle^t

manne Woman may not have no obtain salut i^ the reawlme of paradys With out
this oraison. For as the appoystyl in the poystyl the qwych is Wryttyn to
philipencyens. No^ sumus sufficie^tes a nobis etia^ cogitare. That is to to say
that We haf no faculte to thynk any good of owr self by mor rayson We have no
might no faculte to do any thing vyth out the might be ghewyn to Ws the qwych
yt is ghewyn be grace of god that is not ghewin regulary of god to them that are

that is to tayk the refectyon of the body bot they foret often yt at pertenys to

incloysyt in the said orayson domynical et they are put after the ordyr after as
We should ash et desyr et yt is to notyfye that the said oraison domynical as
being maid of oon excellent lord et master as yt apperys yt is right
artyficyal for yt captisis the beynoywole^s of god the father beryng to him
rewerens and honowr qwen ve call Pater and ve vsys not of this naam heyr dominus
or deus or creator. That is to say that Jesus christ callys not god is father
lord or god or creatur the qwyche ar nams of dreyd bot We call him father qwych
as nam of lowf for that god lowys Ws paternally and Wald belowyt of Ws
fillyally for that cause he says. Pater noster. That is to say owr father on
the qwyche nam of father We should remembyr We are is chyldryn is We Will that owr
orayso^ be hoolsumly offert their for said saint ioon. Ioha^nis.iij. Videte
qualem caritate^ dederit nobis pater vt filij dei nominemur and sumus. That is
to say se qwat charity god the father as ghewyne Ws that is that We are callyt
his sonnys and the sonnys of god if We be the soo^nis of god not oonly namyt et
bot ryally We are the sonnys of god and if We are the hoyrs. He redes dei et
coheredes aute^ xprei. Et yt is to notyfy that he said this Word owrs their to
that no man should meyk Ws and him for that no man should rows no Want him of his
lynage desprisant other for no man Weritably may say their Wordis. Pater noster.
Bot oo^ly them that are brethyer in god et Weritably al man and Woman als Weyl

and may be right callyt brether first i^ so that god as maid and formyt We al
of noght as nobyls kyngys pren^ as powyr ar lyk ong and ald. Segu^dly that We are al cumyt nakyd above the earth. Job. j. Nudus egressus sum de vtero matris

breuis dies hoi^s sunt. etces. The.iiij. rayson that al men as kyngges prencys
paysans riches and powyrs they shall compeyr on the day of judgment in general
be for the siege imperyal of jesus christ for to refayf after their good deydys
et ewyl deydys the sente^s of owr redemptur. Apostolues. Omnes nos manifestari
oportet ante tribunal cristi. In the quhyc yt is clerly shawyng that We are al
in lyk brether follows after Qui es i^ celis. Et if they ash qweyr for he
says. Qui es in celis. That is to understand god is ower al Wayr in essens
presens and puyssans in earth be myercy in hell be iustys i^ hewyn be gloyr the
docturs answerys if as being put their to that owr redemptur and saluyowr jesus
christ should gheue to Wnderstond that We should lowf seyk et desyr the hewynly
thyngys and not the erthly temporalytees after the conseil of the appoystyl.
Que sursum sunt querite non que super terram. Ad colloce^ses tercio. Et the
self thing he says for to shaw Ws the plays War We War maid and boght to the
qwych plays We should daily mayk oo^ iowrny et for this We should mor desyr the.
Eynd and the thyngys the qwyche be holdys the said eynd the qwyche ar ordaynyt
for the said eynd et for this cause jesus christ owr redemptur puttys first two
peticions the qwyche be holdys to god the qwye is the eynd of al this. First
is. Sa^ctificetur nome^ tuu^. That is to say shyr thy nam mot be sanctyfyet. In
the qwyche petycyon We desyr and ashes that the nam of god be honowreth Saint
augustyn. In libro secu^do de sermon domini in monte / says. We are moneyst i^
this petycyon that the nam of god the qwych is ewyr holy mot be reputtyt holy
toward men that is to say that yt be not dyspysyt that yt prouffyt to men and
not to god and be this apperys that We ash not be the said peticyon that the
nam of god be sanctified i^ the self for it is not possibyl that it be mor
sanctified than yt is bot We ash that yt be sanctified in Ws and that yt should
be honowryd as holy lowyffyng With heart parfyt et low and and presh and With
mowht et Weyrk lyw and good life bot now is pitye the nam of god is blasphemyt
be manay chrystyn men mor tha^ sanctyfyed of this playnes ysaie the.lij.
cheptur. Iugiter tota die nomen meum blasphematur. Sych blasphemowrs honowres
not the nam of god et they make no orayson to god aggreabyl bot dysplaysant. The
segu^d peticyon of the said orayson domynical is. Adueniat regnum tuum. That is
to say the kyngryk mot cum to Ws. Saint augustyn in the plays before alleygyd
that We excyt owr desyr be the said peticyon that is that the realm of hewyn
cu^ to Ws and that We may regne in yt. Et Werytably the segund thing that We
desyr after the honowr of god is that We may cu^ to the reawlme of hewyn. As be
the first peticyon as said is We desyr that god be honowryt and glorified by
the men i^ earth. Et be the segund peticyon We ash We may cum to the gloyr of
god et is a^ much to say thy reawlme not cum to Ws as qwa Would desyr at god et
ash^ that he regne in Ws that We may fynaly have his gloyr after yt is Wryttyne
be the gloryows ewangelist saint Euc. i^ the.xvij. cheptur. Regnu^ dei intra
vos est. For god dwellys i^ the sowl of oon right wys man as in his reawlme be
grace in hewyn be gloyr qwar We desyr to ^eyng qwar he Will say on the day of
judgment general to his belowyt and faithful peupyl. Cum bleshyd of my father
resayf presently the reawlme the qwyche is reddy sen the beginning of the World
the thryd peticyon is. Fiat voluntas tua ficut in celo et in terra. That is to
say thy Will most be maid in earth as in hewyn this present peticyon and the
other that followys be holdys the thyngys that are ordaynt to the eynd for be
this present peticion thus as says sant awstye^ i^ the plays preallegyd above
said that owr ashyng that is We asche the meryt be the qwyche We may haff and
obteyn beatytud that consystys in the obeyssans of the godly commandmentys et
be this We ash as the Will of god is maid in he wyn be the angels et sych lyk
the Will of god not bemayd in earth be We tay obedyens / et as the angels
co^formys i^ the hewyn thar Will to the Will of god sych lyk the men in earth mot
conform there Will to the Will of god the father et makar they do not so they that
mowrimurs ageyns god in trybulacyon the qwyche is oon ewyde^t to kyn that they are not i^ the grace of god they are lyk to oon pot that void that sondys fast et
lyk a qweel that is ewyl oyntyt et cries fast. Certanly the good peupyl
conformys there Will to the Will of god Exampil of owr rede^ptur that said. Non
mea voluntas fiat sed tua. God my father thy Will mot be done et not mine. The
fowrth petycion is. Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie. That is to say
gheue Ws to day owr daily bred be this peticyon We ash at god at he gheue Ws
owr neydful lywyng the substa^s of owr body et the lywyng of owr sawl that the
is holy body precyows and be this bred yt is to Wnderstond al neydful et
requyryd to this present lyff. Et certanly the thyngys necessayre qwyche ar
requyryd for owr live should be ashed at god owr father and maykar for as says
the psalmyst. Oculi omnium in te sperant et tu das escam illorum i^ tempore
oportuno. That is to say lord god the eyn of al them of live ar vpleftyt to the
and as hop in the for this cause that thou should gheue substa^s to live for thar
subste^tacyon of there body. Et Werytably the mayneyr of ashyng the thyngys
te^porellys yt is showing to Ws ower Wyde^tly i^ this peticyon for be this the
said. Pane^. is ghewyn Ws to Wnderstond that We should fle al superflewyte of
meyttys et if yt happynys that god has ghewyn Ws ouy thing ower the bred We
should low and thank him gracioly by this that is said. Da nobis. It is to
Wnderstond We have no thing of Ws if god gheue yt to Ws for that sayees the
poystil. Quid habes quod non accepsti. That is to say qwhat good is aes thou
bot thou as thakyn et ressawyt them of god be the self that is said da / yt is
showing to ws that We should not tayk the thyngys temporellys of owr self bot of
god the makar and ghewer of al good asha^d him meykyly and dowtably he or sho
that resawys et takys them be him self of his propre hand he takys them un
ryghtwsly for god gheue them him not bot did tayk them by him self as them that are vsuriers theyf fys et payllars heurmayster et others that Wynnys iniustly et
takys the temporel gooddyes of them self age^s god et thar awn propre salut se
and and be hold and qwat they may say proffytably to there salut. Panem nostrum
quotidianum da nobis hodie. For not Wnderstond ne sey be this that yt is said
nobis is ghewyn to Wnderstond that no man should propyrly approyper to them the
said thyngys tymporels bot should co^mwn them et depart them to mysterfowl folle
after the say of sant augustyn. De meo vtique quero ait cristus da michi et
reddam tibi habuisti me largitorem et fac me debitore^. That is to say that
jesus christ said to the rych of this World I ash the of mine gheue me et I shall
gheue the mayk me detteur of this that I have lent the thou. gheuys me small I
shall gheue the syndry thyngys thou gheuys earth ly thyngys I shall gheue the
hewynly thyngys ewyrlestand for temporellys I shall gheue me self to the this is
Weyl to notyfy as to the Weyr leys of charity be this that is said hodye god
Wald tayk from Ws the great and effycace besynes and superflew folycytud of the
thynghys te^porellys after is yt is Wryttyn in sant mathow i^ the vj. cheptur.
Nolite esse soliciti in craftinum. God Wald not that We should be of ower greyt
desyr to conwoyt the thyngys temporels the qwych promyttys long live
co^qwestand by trews or not trews by many earys to cum as did the ewyl rich et
Wraychet sinner of the qwych is Wryttyn in the Wangel by the parson of the said
rich. Anima mea habes multa bona in annos plurimos. That is to say mysowl mayk
good chere for thou as much goodys Gadderyt in Thy Laws and thy garnyers by
syndry and long earys. Et answerys the Woys of the diwyne iustys to him. Stulie
hac nocte anima^ tua^ ate et que co^gregasti signa erunt. that is fowl mo^dain
the dewyllys shall cum this night the qwyche shall tayk thy sowll and shall beryt
to ewyrlestand dannacyon to qwoin shall be ghewyn the goodys that thou as i^
justly coqwyst as he Would say thou shall llyff them for ewyr mor. The.v.
petycyon is. Et dimitte nobis debita nra^ sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribues
nostris. That is to say for gheue Ws owr dettys as We for gheue to owr
dettoures by this petycyon We may ash as god for gheuys owr synnys done ageyns
god ageyns owr night bowr et as ageyns owr self et this petycyon in the regard
of ewyl syne of the qwyche ewyl We ash to be dylymeryt. Et certainly We ash
mor at god requyra^d that he forgheue Ws owr debtes that is to say owr synnys
for the first We reqwyr ashand at he forgheue Ws the coulp et the pain the
qwyche We should pay for owr synnys. The qwyche can not be done in the segund as
We Wald say forgheue Ws owr synnys for yt happynys often that the syne is for
ghewyn as to the coulp et always the said syn bydys as to the pain by this
that he says after. Sicut et nos. and ces. Is ghewyn clerly to Wnderstond if
that We forgheue and out al rancur et indygnacyon the qwych We haff in owr
hartys ageyns owr nythbowrs and prochayns god Will forgheue Ws et We Will not
forgheue other god Will not forgheue Ws after the say of the Wangell. Si non
dimiseritis nec patervester celestis dimittet vobis peccata vestra. That is to
say if e forgheue not owr nyghtbowrs their miwrys owr father celestial Will not
forgheue ow owr synnys. Et in dowttabyl yt is to notyfy that owr saluyowr et
rede^ptur jesus christ put this artikyl before said. Sicut and nos dimittimus
debitoribus nostris. For to shaw Ws et teych Ws We may not have no grace no
pardon of owr synnys With out first We haff i^ Ws charity and that We forgheue
aes We ash forgheuenees for thar is no man that has ra^cur upon his night bowr
newer mor he shall be forghewyn by this petycyon yt is ghewyn clerly to
Wnderstond that We should not ash at god thing bot yt Worcester just. Et Werytably yt
is oon thing right just to forgheue owr Ennemis so far as We ash forgheuenes
of owr sinnys. The.vj. peticion co^tenyt in this said orayson domynycal is. Et
ne nos i^ducas intemptationem. That is to say leyd Ws not intemptacyon et We
ash yat he Will deliver Ws of the eWyllys the qwyche We are inclynyt to fyn and
to do ewyl by this petycyon et this dema^d is ghewyn to Ws to Wndersto^d that
We should requyr at god no oonly that he forgheue Ws owr sins bot hals that he
preserve et keyp Ws from the occasyon of syn et to gheue Ws fors strenght and
might to battle ageynes the te^ptacyons frauddys et gayllys of the dewyl of
hell for pryncypally We should have in owr courage ferme constans of purpos With
Will there to Weyr et resyst the said temptacyons for also myche as We resyst We
shall have meryt et yt is good to Wnderstond that owr sawyour et rede^ptur jesus
christ knowand the te^ptacyons ar right peryllews to man put this peticyon and
yt should by Wndersto^d that We ash symply to by not tempyt bot We ash and
requyrys at god owr maykar that We by not led ne condwys intemptacyon that is
to say We be not ower cumyt in temptacyon ne owertaykyn be syn that owr enemy
and dewllys of hell may not hold Ws in thar nettys as the fych is in the net of
the fychar et certanly yt is Weel expedyent et reaysonnabyl that We reqwyr god
owr makyr in owr orayson that he preserve and keyp Ws from temptacyon for owr
adwersayr the dewyll of hell lucyfer et his complacys et follows ar ewyr in
Waych for to temp Ws for the grettast part of owr meryttys is sowstenant
trybulacyon et owercu^mand the temptacyones of this present lyff for as says
saint bernard. Quociens restiteris tociens coronaberis. That is to say also
often as thou resystees the temptacyo^s and tribulacions of this World not only
the te^ptacions of this World bot also of the Wekyt et cursyt flech of thy body
for thy body tempys the by day and night fleshly lust and to cause to syn of
lychery et to cause Ws to ryn in da^nacyone Wyrlestand and also to show the the
temptacyon of the ennemy that pourchassys the night et day for to draw the to
the pains of hell et if thou ma ower cum thyr three e^nemys also many times
thouw shall be crownyt in the realm of paradys yt is than expedye^t to put and
labor With pain to resyst to the said te^ptacio^^ or other Ways owr Werkys
shall be small for that says sant augustyn. Nullus ho^minum est ta^ta iusticia
preditus cui non sit necessaria tribulacionis temptacio ad proficiendum. That
is to say there is no man that is ornyt of so great iustys to the qwyche the
te^tacyon of trybulacyon is neydful forto proffyt et have meryt of the
ewirlestand live owr sawyour et redemptur jesus christ Was tempyt bot he Was not
led in te^ptacyon for he resystyt et owrcom the temptacyon of the dewyll of hell
i^nemy of man kind ghena^d us exe^pil that he Wald Weyl We War te^pyt bot he
Will that We resist the temptacyons et that We owercom et ower com and We may
meryt the ewerlestand live for this cause yt is neydful to batell et strive
ageyns the dewyl of hell et the World owr propre flech for after the say of the
appoystyl. Nullus coronabitur nisi qui legitime certaueryt. That is to say no
man may have the crown of gloyr With out he strive et batyhl strenghtly ageyns
the dewyl et the temptacyons of the World and of the flesh as dyt the gloryowes
matyrs as sant a^thoin the qwyche batyllyt ageyns the dewyl sant katheryn

Saint James The mayr put the iiij. article of the faith i^ the credo that is

Effu^dam de spu^ meo. etces Credo in spiritu^ sanctum

God dyscendit in the mownt of synay. Moses by him gheue the law. The holy
gheost dyscendyt so. To the appoistyll and lyghtnyth the faith.
Saint bertholomo puttys the.viij. artykyl of the said credo that is to
Wnderstond. Credo in spiritum sa^ctum. That is to say I beleyf i^ the holy
gheost for as that are We bown dyng to beleyf i^ the father et the soon sychlyk
ar We bownd to beleyf in the holy gheost in so far that he is substancyal et
hewyn to the father et soon et of on self substans and essens With them forthys
cause yt is of neyd to the falwt of ewyrych crestyn man to vndesto^d the said
holy gheost procedys of the father and the soon and that Errys the grekys that
sayees that oonly the holy gheost procedys of the father et not of the soon the
qwych is fale and again the faith of holy church mylyta^t that We sing daily
in the symboyl of the holy mes. Qui a patre filio qui procedit. Et the
appoystyl callys the gheost of god ad galathas.iiij. Misit deus spiritum filij
sui in corda vestra. Et by this apperys that the said holy gheost procedis of
the soon. Et certanly the said holy gheost should br desyryt of al me^ formen ar
qwylmyt of him iohannis sexto. Spiritus est qui viuificat Et he that aes not
the holy gheost With him is deyd for as the spyryt raisonnabyl is neydful to

the say of the spalmyst that says to god. Aufera^ spiritum eorum et deficie^t
Et tayk owth the holy gheost of tho saowllys et of the bodies of men et they

delyweryt from ewyl bot by him et We do no good bot by him.

Inuocabu^t nomen domini. Sancta^ ecclesia^ catholicam.

Aaron of god Was choysyn sowerayn. For to exers the godly sacryfys. Holy

Saint mathow puttys the.ix. artykyl in the said credo that is to understand
Sancta^ ecclesia^ catholica^. I beloyf in holy church that is to say that al
faithful crestyn me^ ar in oon gaderyt in holy church in unite et faith and
certa^ly the church is no other thing bot the congregacyon of faithful men and
crestyn peupyl and as to this cause oon ewyrych man or Woman qwyche is in the
stayt of grace is membyr of holy church and of jesus christ et is heyd of yt of
this says the appoystyl in the pystyl that is Wyrttyn to the Ephecyens in
the.v. cheptur qwer he says Vir est caput mulieries sicut xpres est caput
eccli^e. That is to say as man is heyd of the Woman so jesus christ is heyd of
the church the qwyche is of present in three parties. The first is to the World
and this party is in dreyd exspectacyon. The segund is in hewyn / et this
party is vyth out dreyd and With out exspectacion. The third party is i^
purgatoyr the qwyche holddys the Way betwyx the sam parties for yt is in
exspectacyon for the qwyche has no gloyr of the live ewyrlesta^d always yt is
With out dreyd for yt has the lyberal arbytyr co^fermyt i^ good and arthyr three
above said parties of the church representyd be three parties of the sacrement
of the autyr the qwoche ar maid in the mes / et in the mysterys of yt qwych is
oon thing much long for to declayr and for the cause of shortness j shall declayr
after in other passages.

deponet dn^s oe^s iniquitates Remissionem peccatorum

Sayge Was mary the sister of moses. Holyd be her contrycyon. We should trow
With out errowr. Of al synnys remyssyon.
Saint Simon cananeus put the.xi artykyl i^ the said credo qwar in dependys
much of owr beleyf as to the santtys of paradys that is to Wndersto^d Sanctorum
commuionem remissionem peccatorum. That is to say j beleyf in the communyon of
santys et in the remyssyon of synnys of the qwyche spekys myche as in the.vij.
cheptur. Deponet dominus om^s iniquitates nostras et proijciet in profundum
maris. That is to say owr lord shall tayk away owr synnys and shall put them in
the deyp of the sea. By this We should Wnderstond et notyfy that the communyon
of holy men of paradys is no Wtherthyng bot the congregacyon of things
spyritwellys ghettyng by the santtys of paradys the qwych ve should streynghtly
beleyf to by conmunyques and also by departyt ewyryche oon after his desert in all the membrys and suppoysytys of the church qwych ar in grace for all crestyn
men qwyche ar With out syn deydly they ar parttaykars of all the gooddys the
qwyche ar done in the church by ewyrych membyr of the said church as We see
that oon torch or oon candyl is lythnyght to lyghtnyng and serve oon man that
gooys by the streyt al them that are in the said streyt parsawys and resawys the
benyfys of the said light. Et Werytably yt is so if deydly syn that dyrkys the
Wnderstondyng and fylys the affection With out yt put enpyshyng after the say
of the psalmyst. Particeps ego sum omnium timencium te. Et Werraly charity that
is to Wnderstond that the low and union of Werray crestyn men is cause for
charity requyrys not yt prywe prouffyt bot seyth is yt the qwyche is
prouffytabyl to syndry by this cause charity should be callyt maystres of gooddys
the qwyche is in the church. Et Werytably this may be in thyngys humayns and
naturellys for qwan the meyt is Weyl dygestyt et that nature dryfys yt et sendys
to ych oon membyr that as neyd of noryshyng et as to the segund party yt is
said j beleyf the remyssyon of synnys we should beleyf that al syn is orygynal
or actwel is remyssybyl in the church and to this artykyl is redwyt the faith
of the sacrame^s as to Werray crestyn men the qwyche is as instrume^tys
gheuaynt for to sanctyfy and consequently for to remyt et forgheue the synnys
as be baptysyng that taykys away the syn of the saowl of him the qwyche is
baptysyd With out feeynyng or yt his he the qwyche is baptysyd beleyf in this
bas aage and al et often tymys that any fall in syn after that he be baptysyd be
yt deydfy or Wenyal he ma be reparyt by contrycyon confession et satysfaccyon
the qwych We call the sacrament of pennans et as this cause We should ewirych oon
beleyf streynghtly that the remyssyon of synnys is the church catholyk and not
no other plays for out of the church their is no salut for so much that yt is
not membre of the church et he that mysbelywys shall be eternally damnyt. Et in
this present artykyl We have oon techyng salutayr that noon should dysesper
qwath syn that ewyr he have done for as says ysodore de summo bono. Desperatio
est peior omni peccato. That is to say that myshop is the Worst of al synnys Et
saint augustyn says. De nemine desperandum est in hac vita. Solum enim
desperacionis crimen est quod mederi non potest. That is to say that We should
not dysesper i^ this World for dysespoyr is oon syn that may not have no
medicine. As for this cause We should beleyf i^ the remissyon of synnys qwath
greyt sinner that ewyr We by and thought We had commyttid oon thousand of
thowsanddys of deydly synnys for as says sant Bernard. Mayor est dei pietas
quam queuis iniquitas. That is to say that the meyrcy et pity of god ye gettar
than any inyquite.

Educam vos de sepulcris. Carnis resurrectionem

Saint Judas thadeus puttis the.xj artikyl in the said credo that is to

Wryttyn. Ioha^nis.vj. Veniet hora in qua om^s qui i^ mome^tis sunt audie^t

that all the bodies of deyd pewpyl that reposys in thar grawys shall eyr the Woys
of the soon of god and the appoystyl says. Omnes quidem resurgemus. That is to

Job. Ru^sum cirrunda^bor pelle mea and in carne mea v^id^bo deu^ saluatore^

j now in my propyt flech seys my sawyowr the qwych j chal se my self that is

SAnt mathyas put the.xij. artykyl and the last i^ the credo before said that is
to say. Vitam eternal. Et that is as much to say as ewyrlestyng live by. This
is to say and understand that after the resurrexcion of the bodies before said

veritabyly the blyshyd shall have live vyth out dethlyght With out dyrknes

deydly for yt is Wryttyn in the great decreyt. Non licet cristiano elementa
colere nec lune nec stellarum cursum deponere in coniugijs sociandis / in

augustyn says. Quod ois dies bonus est quia deus prima^ die^ fecit sic / et

On oonly god thou shall adore et lowf perfytly god i^ vayn thou should not sweyr

THe fryst co^mendme^t is of the low of god. Non adorabis deos alienos. Tat is
to say thou shall adoyr oon god et not may nay et i^ the beginning of this

Et fynaly defe^dis that We lowf not so myche temporells goodys et transytoyrys

dyscendys this presant commendyment the qwych says that man shoold not mor lowf

ower great prosperyte for that men fow lych as often of the goodys of god The

Worthy to serve god as is the stayt of vyrgynite of Weydowheyd of relygion or
of them that studyes theolygy et yt synnis they mor qwen they draw the said

qwych We Wald not no dowrst not do before the pewpyl We should also hownowr the

not for them self bot for that en seyeng them We gheue honowr to yt the qwyche
representys the dreyd rewere^s honowr and lowyf of god after the intencyon of

co^ma^dyment is often contrary ho^newr that We do to temporel lordys by flatery
et ewyl eynd by the qwych thayr cu^mys often tymys in the mysknowlegs of their

co^mandynent ar reprewyt et defendyt al fa^tyses et ypocrisy for to have gloyr

lowff dysordanyt that We may have to any creature as is thues as to their

them self Wnderstondyng that by the said thyngys We fall in hellys. Them no We
can not put Ws forth for god is oonly faithful et Werray freynd that may holp
Ws i^ owr last neyd. Et as to this cause he shoold by purely soweraynly endly
lowyt serwyt et honowryt of all The segund conma^dyme^t is. Non assumes nomendie tui in vanu^. That is to say
thou shall not tayk the nam of god in Wayn he that takys the name of god i^
Wayn qwych blasphemys the name of jesus christ. Et qwych sweyrrys by the Woondys
of god by the blood by the deeth or other members of owr lord. Et certanly sych
othees ar ewyr deydly syn qwen they are maid of powrpos dylyberyt their to With
owth cause no necessyte for they thynk the irre Werens and the blasphemyng and
them that swerrys by the santys qwen they sweyr Wyttyngly falsely and lesynly
thus as says sant thomas for as if the Women the chyldryn or the serua^tys
swerrys that they have not doing no said no seyeng any thing sychlyk qwen any

they that swerys et affermys ageyns their co^scyens falsely that oon thing is
bettyr than yt is or that yt cost mor than yt did qwath thing be yt much or
small. Et certanly We shoold not sweyr of oon thing With out yt War faithful et
if the thing be not lysum and sworn With dyscrecyon for just and lysum cause et
straynant necessyte after the Wryt of Ieremye in the.iiij. cheptur. Iurabis in

followyt of three thyngys before said yt is syn deydly or Wenyal after the
qwantyte of the cowlp for god may not be Wyttnes of falsyte. Et they that by

swerys fowlych oaths that renoncys and dyspytys god / et ghewys their body and

blasphemowrs synnys grewonsly. They shoold by Weyl chastyt they that has
cowstu^ to sweyr ower hastly for they fall often in deydly syn. Et of this spekys
the sayge. Vir multum iurans replebitur iniquitate et non recedit a domo eius
plaga. That is to say / That the man qwyche is cowstumyt to fowlych sweryng
shall be fowlfyllyt of al inyquyte and the plag of the godly punyshon of iustys
the qwych shall cum et dyscend a pon him. Again this comma^dyment synnys they
qwych brekys their Wowes and promessys et qwyche bresys their maryages and
kepys no faith no lawty. Et they that reweyllys the sacryt of on otheyr in
greyt confusyon by yt in confession or out of confession by toyknys or otherwys
for after the right of nature self after the holy Wryt / sacryt hold shoold /
that secret ressawys if other Wys no by confession he Wndersto^dys not. Et also

THe thryd commandyme^t of the law of god is. Memento vt diem sabbati

THe.iiij. co^ma^dyme^t is. Honor a patre^ et matre^ vt fi^ lo^geuues super

that doys no honowr to father and mother ar oftymys punyshyd of god in this
World in their propyr body et sowdayn deeth for yt is so that the reward of
them that honowrys father et mother is of long live as says the ecclesyastyk in
the.xiij. cheptur. Qui honorat patrem suu^ vita viuet longior. Of the contrary
them that doys not honowr to father and mother shall die of oon in prowisyd deyth
after the say of the psalmyst. Subito defecerunt et perierunt propter

bot i^ the other vyth this shall be punyshyd of ewytlestand damnacyon as yt
apperys in Exodi in the.xxj. cheptur. Qui maledixerit patri vel matri morte

ewyrlestandly. Et certanly the said fathers et mothers shoold inform et teache
their chyldryn in the godly co^mandyment is and chasty them qwen they fayke
qwen they sweyr and blasphemys the name of god the qwych they le Wyttyngly for all the synnys that the chyldyr do is et redondys and fallys above their fathers

oo^ly Worthy of deeth ewyrlestand the qwych do is the syn / bot With that they
that consentys to them that doys yt. Et yt is Weyl notyfyed that this
commandyment is not oonly Wnderstondyt of fathers and mothers flechly but yt is
Wndersto^d it With this of the prelatys of holy church of curatys maysteres
lordys gooddoars et of prencye te^porestyes on the qwych We should honowr vytht

mayner almighty god et nature Would and has ordaynyt to be kyeppyt to have

fylth of the ordynans of nature by yt out of marriage by the qwych yt is War in
marriage and of thyes syn We shall speyk of the kyndys of the.vij. deydly synnys.

THe.viij. co^ma^dyme^t is. Non loqueris contra proximu^ tuu^ falsu^
testimoniu^. That is to say thou shall not beyr fales vyttnees i^ judgment no
out of judgment. Et is heyr defendyt al lesyngys et by especyal they that are to
the domayge of other. Et yt is Wares if ve assewr the lesyng by oath for than We
mensweyr owrself the qwych We shoold not do for to by oon man from death by yt

assewr. Synnys also they that eyryes Wit ower good Will diffamacyo^s
blaphemyngys of other affermand ower lightly ageyns god and their night bowr.

THe.ix. co^mandyme^t is. Non co^cupisces vxorem proximi tui. That is to say
thou shoold not desir the vyf of thy nyghtbowr no his dother no his maiden in
the.vj co^mandyment yt is forbyddyn and defe^dyt lychery as to the deyd. Bot by
this presant co^mandyment al co^cupysce^s flesly and Wulysu^ ageyns this
co^mandyme^t sinnys three manayr of pewpyl. The first ar they qwych cowoyttys
and desyrys Wylfully to fulfill lichery et to cum to yt if it be possybyl if
they dred not the World or sclandyr of men. Et qwych for to cum to the said
deyd sendys lettrys / messangeyrs ghyfty^ et maykys / may nay / promise / le
syngys / et maykys cowntenans et beholdyngys other to draw to syn. Segundly
synnys ageyns this co^ma^dyme^t they that Weshys ornys et polycys their to that

syn is the parso^s ar by they of lignage or relygyon or married.

THe.x. co^mandyme^t is. Non concupisces rem proximitui. That is to say
thowshalt not desyr the goodys of other. Et certainly yt is heyr defe^dyt theft
as to the Will for yt is defe^dyt to the.vj. co^mandyment as to deyd. Ageyns
this co^mandyment sinnys they qwych With cowrayge dylyuer desyrys iniustly the
good of their nygtbowr doing them pain of al their power to cause them to leys

of his estayt in spekyng ageyns god for yt is Weyllyk to him the qwych cowytyes
that he has bettyr desserwyt or that he is mor Worthi to have sych gooddis no

Wrong et that fowlych is he that seruys him. Et also qwen domayge cu^mys to
other he is gled et says that god has done right to have send him sych oon
da^mayge for his ewylnes also sinnyes they that denies the Werkys of meyrcy
bodyly and spyrytwaly et Will not fawor the powers that are ordaynyt in necessite
opinly. Et yt is Werite qwen they have veyl qweyr of and goodis superflews the
qwych apertenyes to the power the qwych sych pewpyl cowytys ower ardently et
rekys not of their power parentys et the good serwans of god diys of ho^ger. Et
qwen they hold the seruys of their seruans. Et Wnder the schodow of fowndyn of
chyrchys orchapellys ordo almw^ holdyng the goodys of other the qwych We Wayt
to qwom We shoold restoyr them saint to the^ self that they the qwych they
apperteyn ar ower rych et Would dyspend them Worcester. Et yt is to not by oon rewl
general qwat sum ewyr good to cu^ or for to e^pesh ewyl We shoold not syn no
owerpas the co^mandymentys of god.

Heyr after We shall se of the three Wertus theologycalys et of the iiij. vertus
cardynalys
FOr that With out faith al other Wertus are not of sum vtylyte et Wit out it is
i^possybyl to pleys god as says the appoystyl in the pystyl qwych is Wryttyn to
the hebrews in the.xj. cheptur as to this cause We say that faith the qwych is
the first Wertu theologycal shoold proceyd al other Wertus of the qwych We shall
speyk the qwych ewirych oon man the qwych Would weyl dyshoold labowr to have it.
Et ceyrtanly if We Will that owr Weyrkys by merytabyl yt is neydful that they by
maid in parfyt faith formyt of charity for good Weyrkyes shall not sayf the
saowl but faith. Et Wnfayllant the lest Weyrk that man mado infayth et in grace
plesys mor to god than all the good Weyrkys that all the Wn faithful did do ewyr
na Will do ewyr yt is yt that doys call the men the sonnys of god as it is
Wryttyn to the appoystyl. Omnes filij dei estis per fid^. Et for that if We Will
Weyl leyf et consequently Weyl die yt is neydful to keyp the faith that We may
not Weyl do With out ve Wndersto^d qwat is of faith. And as to this cause We
shall sey heyr the dyfynycyon of yt after saint augustyn faith is the fo^deme^t
of al goodys et the beginning of the salut of ma^kynd. Et the appoystyl says i^
the poystyl to the hebreus in his.ix. cheptur. That faith is the substa^s the
qwych We shoold have hop and argument of thyngys not apperand. Et of this faith
et of thyngys to beleyf of necessyte of salut We have said heyr before i^ the
cheptur of the artyclys of the faith at langht.

HOp ye the segund Wertu theologycal the qwych after sant gregoyr is no other
thing bo^ exspectacyon of beatytud to ^a^ procydent of the grays of god and of
the propre good deydys of the person for to hop to by sawyt of his propyr Wertu
With out grays of god no to do qwath su^ ewir weyrk meritory it shoold by
presumpcio^ and not hop. Et certa^ly god techyes Ws i^ syndry passages of the
holy Wryt that We have hop i^ him. Et promys great goodys that is beatytud if We
have perfyt hop With out dowt Et he Will qwath synnys that ewyrwe have done i^
thies World that We have no dyshop bot ewyr that We by ferm et sekyr in the
faith and that We have no trust in owr propyr f^agylyte in stre^ght of man bot
We shoold have dyspayr in belleyffyng that With out the holp et grays of god We
may not do Weyrk no thing that is merytoyr.

CHuryte is the thryd Wertu theologycal et pre^ses of vertus after the say of
sant augustyn yt is the most right affectyon of the cowrage by the qwych god is
lowit forth love honowr goodnees / of god. Et^nfay^ a^t sho yes qwen of vertus
by the q^ych after sa^t augusti^ god should by first lo wit above al thing
Segu^dly we shoold love owr saowl and owr propyr salut and thread vayes the
salut of owr nyghtbowr. Et the iiij vayees owr propyr body and the body of owr
said nyghtbowr this is prowyt de. pe. di. ij. s. Ite^ hecest caritas.

PRude^s yes the first virtue cardynal the qwych is no other thing after the
phyloophy i^ is ethyquys bot right raiso^ of things that We shoold co^seyl
veyl and judge Weyl the things and the said things discernyt and iugyd and
followi^g to the Weyrk by the conma^dime^t of rayso^. and i^ effet the offys of
man prudent is to have mind of the things by passyd and by the said mind to
grayth Weyl the things present and fynaly by prouyde^s prouyd quych thing he
shoold do the tym to cum.

Tempora^s is oon other virtue cardynal kepar and sister to prude^s and yt yes
no other thing te^pora^s bot oon refreyna^t of perturbacyo^s and passions by
the qwych the saowl and thought of the parson is preserwyt of perturbacyons With
out fayneyng of affeccyons in him self Wnder him puttyng them to al rayson
thayr to that modesti shoold by kepit i^ al things. Et certa^ly te^pera^s
kepyes the i^tigryte of the thought With out any declyni^g to syn.

Force is oon Wertu cardynal by the qwych ewyrych man Wertws shoold dreyd and
also moye^ly Wndyr tayk greyt thyngys With out dreyd of peryllys of deeth Et
certanly fors is cohybytif and pressur of dreydys and temperer of hardynes et
as to this cause the Wertu of fors consystys in dreidys and paryllys of deeth.
Et the pryncypal offys of fors is to susteyn and beyr immowabyl or to Wndertayk
greyt thyngys and perylleus to the saowl that is to Wnderstond for the salut of
the saowl i^ the tynges co^serua^tes the faith and the defens of yt.

Ivstis is oon Wertu cardinal right perfyt for yt is oon seyssable co^na^t of
nature fo^d for the salut of syndry for the law yes the ba^d of man nys company
by the qwych the me^ lewys honestly With out hewrt oon other. yt is yt that
gheuys to ewyrych oon yt that pertenys to the et certa^ly qwych Would by ryghtus
he shoold d^yd Weyl and low god / and to hi^ so much is yt is possybyl to hi^
to i^ wit He propyrly calls god and followys qwych Will proffyt to al / and Will
not do noy to person / yt that he Would and desyr to do al me^ of good

In this cheptur subsequent followyng We heyr after we have to say of the sewyn
ghyftys of the holy gheost. That is to Wndersto^d of sapye^s / of Wndersto^dyng
/ of scye^s / of confyl / of pity / of dreyd and of rednees. By the qwych
the.vij. deydly synnys ar expel lyt and put away from the saowl of ma^kynd. Et
first of the ghyft of sapye^es and Wysdoo^ by the quych the holy gheost haes
ghewyn we might to sawor and gowst the hewynly thyngys. Te qwych sawour and
sweytnes procedies al sweytnes of this World of the qwych spekyes basylyus
sayand as thus O sweytnes mellyflewat mor swet tha^ howny sweytnes mer weyllowe
so much art tho^ sweyt i^ medytacyon mor swet i^ vrayson and right sweyt in
beaty tuo^. Et certanly yt is inexplycabyl et so greyt that if the bewyn opynyt
and that We might sey the left joy that the lest sant of peradis newyr the les
that the said joy War long from them qwych dwellys in the earth / they may
suffyr no susteyn the said joy bot they W^ld merweyl or by marweyll y^^ and
gled beholdyn the Wysyon of yt. Et they^ Would not by h^rt so sorrowful bot they
Would by gled (...) pa^n so byttyr that men shoold ^eyl yt. Owa^s ^^y shall We
have than qwen We shall be ^hey^ (...) qwen We shall moys Ws With god et With ^l
the sant ^y^. Et indow tabyl the vysyon so go^ so bylec^abyl / (...) sant
augustyn says he low y^ be^^ yr ^o by in hell to se god^ han to by in parady^
and to by p^^uyt an^ seys the sight of the vysyon of god.

This ghyft foresaid of Wysdom do is put away al lychery Quia gusta to spiritu
^^p it o^es curo. That is to say that he that gowsty^ thy^ present ghyft of
sapyens the sweytn^^ of the hewinly things fyndis not the gowst of the fleshly
lust bot syn dye them bitter. Et su^t ^^gustyn says. Thou shall not gowst the
joy. of hewynly sweytnes if thou fylys thy heart by charnel dylectacy^n.

THe segund gift of the holy gheost yes the gift of Wndersto^dyng by the qwych
the holy gheost gheues Ws to Wnderstond et to know god in Ws and in other
creatw^s for We know the godly might qwe^ we consider the greytnes and the
largynes of this World / et qwych by his ^yght he shoold have small and might
have maid Worldys i^ (...) We Wnderstond also the sapye^s of god by the fayrnes
and be a^^te of the hewyn and of the ^re at^^e of thy World. Et by tha^ ghyft
is owtyt and t^^^yn away the ^^y of glowto^ny for Ws (...) daynls by the ghyft
of Wynderstondyng and vs^^ of the ^e (...) of god / to the bon^ow not hi^ and
owr profyt and their to that Ws may mor (...) him do and fo^l fyl the things
reqryd to owe Wa^^acyon^ and stayt as for this cause We shoold put away al
glowto^^^ al superflwyte of meyt and da^^^.

THe thryd gift of the holy gheost is the ghyft of Wit and of s^yens by the
qwych the holy gheost is chyes Ws three thyngys First be techis to Ws to know
owr propyr self and Qwath thing yt is of Ws et qwath yt Was of Ws and qwath yt
shall be finally of Ws. Saint bernard says to cwyrych oon man mot tell. Thynk feo^
qwenes thowart cu^mytet have shaam of thy full generacyon. Behold qwey^ thou art
/ and in qw^^h^^nge y^^^ peyry^^^ and Weyp for thy bug^rows dwelling behold
qwa^h Way thou goye^^i behold how thou act et shall be ordayny^ in oon my^h
merwcy ^^ow^ dr^yd for the playcys of he^ful of horybyl pain. Consy^yr that by
cowlp be syn d^y^y thowar^ maid the ennemy of god. Et of the contrary that by
gr^^^ thou shall be may (...) he (...) he rytyer of god. S^gundly the ghyft of
^lyens techys Ws also to Wndersto^d that god is owr lord and owe may^^at also
yt is to Wnderstond god (...) we lord and that We are of his fugges et seruans
et that We shoold mayk obeyssa^s et seruys. Et also the said ghyft of sry^^
gh^uys Ws to Wnderstond that god is owr father ^t that We de his chyldryn and
that We should ghaue hi^ rewere^s et ho^nowr. Also yt gheuys Ws to Wnderstond
god is owr redemptur et for this cause We are bownd to low him also yt gheuys Ws
to Wnderstond god is owr judge and as to that We shoold breyd hi^ by yt mettyng
drynkyng / or slepyng. The thry^ (...) ynyeyt the gift a^^ (...) g^^^^ Ws
pryncyp^^^ to ^now owr nygh thou to and (...) al (...) by they rych (...) power
no ^yl or not nobyl at lyk (...).iiij. thing is. First that al men et Woman ar

maid al man et Woman of (...) matter that is of the sly^^ of the (...) / that are
boorn and shall be boorn al nakyt and power. Se^^^ly the said ghyft of scyens
gheuys Ws to Wndersto^d owr self owr ^ou^tte and that al they the ar of ^yue
ar lyk as to this that they are mortel et shall die after of oon short live / rich
a^ pow^^ The thryd mayney^ yt gheuy^ Ws to Wnderstond the ghyft of soyens that
al men shall be ardwy^ in oon self powdyret (...) By qwych aperys as to th^^^ nys
of deid pepyl as at saint innocent or i^ church ardyes their yes no dyffere^s
their betwix the bonys of nobyl and not nobyl. the iiij. mayneyr the ghyft of
scye^s ghewys Ws to Wndersto^d that al men and Woman shall be strayn yt to gheue
rekynnyng and cownt of owr Weyrkys before the soon of god owr redemptur and as
this cause is Wndersto^dyt that al men ar ewyn i^ the thyngyes by foresaid they
shoold low With out dysprisyng of oon or other no to hurt oon other no to enwy
oon other and for that the ghyft of scyens doys away the syn of enwy / qwych
yes contrary to charity for cause enwy / yes gled su^ of the ewyl of other and
is dysplesant of is good the qwych yes dewyky et ageyns al charity.

THe.iiij. ghyft of the holy gheost is the ghyft of co^seyl and certys the holy
gheost Would We shoold ash co^seyl at three. First at god after the say of the
holy man thobyas the qwych said to his son. Gheue thou blishyng of the lowyng
of god / and pray him that he dres thy Ways and do so that al thy conseyl bid
in him and the sayge says. In oi^bus deprecare consiliu^ altissimi. In all
thyngys ash the holp and the consyl of god. Segundly We shoold ash co^seyl at
owr prowchayn ye qwych is full of Wit et dyscreyt qwych dredis and lowys god and
not me^ that are dyssolut et of ewyl live / for With greyt pain he shoold gheue
good conseyl quwych is not proffytabyl et ewyl to him self Ambro. Quies iudicet
vtile^ aliene cause que^ videt in vtile^ vite sue. The thryd is We shoold ash
co^seyl at owr propyr co^scye^s i^ the qwych dwellys the holy gheost by grace.

Et certa^ly this ghyft of co^seyl puttys away al Wrechydnees from owr soowllys
the qwych yes doo^ qwe^ the holy gheost by this present ghyft of co^seyl
coseyllys Ws to dysprys the eerthly things and low the hewynly things. For
the eerthly things proffytes no thing as to the deeth and may not by led With
them in oon other World. Et they do mor ewyl than they do good for We most
gheue rayso^ how they have being Won / takyn / possess it and how they are
dyspendyt on to the last penny. Bot of the contrary the gooddys spyrytwellys
shoold be semblyd for they proffyt in this World et to cu^ and at the death and
after the death yt proffyttys at the deyd for they mayk the man to die Weyl Et
proffyttys after the deeth for the said gooddys gheuys ewyrlestand life.

THe.v. ghyft of the holy gheost yes pyty. Et is to not that their is three
mayners of pyty. The first is to god et consystys in the good that We shoold
have to him first in the prowysyon of the thyngys temporellys after the
psalmyst qwych says. Iacta cogitatum tuum in dn^o et ipse te enutriet. That is
to say put thy thought in god et he shall norysh the bodyly et spyrytualy. Thyes
trust puttys away al superflewite of te^porel thyngys the qwyche has Wrechyd
pewpyl that are ewyr in dreyd for cause the temporel goodys shoold fail them and
that are newyrful as they shoold leyf ewyr mor / always they dysoonnar than
they beleyf as yt apperys of the rych lowar of the qwych says saint luc in the
xij. cheptur. Stulte hac nocte etces. Et certa^ly if god has gheuyng the saowl
et the body the qwych ar of ower greyt thing tha^ the living or the clothyng yt
followys that he shall gheue the thyngys qwych ar les / that is the said living
et clothyng Nonne anima est plus quam esca and corpus quam vestimentu^.
Certanly / e. Secundly We shoold have trust in god that he shoold powruay Ws of
goodys spyrytwels as to the saowl and for this cause We shoold put away from Ws
al mayner of dyspayr for the spalmyst says. Spera^tem aute^ in domino
misericordia circu^dabit. The third mayner is We shoold have perfyt hop et
trust that he gheue Ws the goodys ewyrlesta^d. In reward ewyrlesta^d / that We
shoold not have hop of owr propyr good deydys bot of the meryt of jesus crist
owr rede^ptur the qwych god the father as ghewyng Ws et al thyngys in him in
tokynyng of this he had is syd opynyt i^ the cors by the qwych We may entyr in
paradys for he opynyt the said port by his holy passion. Ageyns this doys sum
that are Wayk the qwych also sown as they sey or eyt prech any thing of the
iustys of god or of the paynys of hell they have dreyd et incontyne^t says they
shoold newyr be sawyt co^sydera^t the synnys that they have done et mystrustys
of the ewyrlestand salvation the qwych is oon thing dyabolyk. For the dewyl has
lost al hyes hop of salvation / bot al faithful crystyn pewpyl shoold have
Werray hop et trust in god for yt is he that sawys the^ qwych has in him hop.
The segund pity is that We shoold have by the said gift of the holy gheost is
ayens owr self to have pyty et compassyon of owr saowl no ryshant yt of the
holy sacrament of the autyr et With prethyngys et Woordys of god et ghenyng yt
drynk of the chalyes of trybulacyons et of pacyens et clethyng yt With charity
of god et owr prochayn et herbryand yt in hewyn by Werray pennans et vysytand
yt by contrycyon et byttyr repenta^s of owr synnys thynkant of the fragylyte of
man kind puttand yt forth of the prison of this presant World by contemplacyon
et desyr of hewynly thyngys. The thryd pyty qwyche We shoold have by ghyst of
the forsaid pyty aes to owr nyghtbowr gheuand him of owr goodys by almows.
ecclesia.xiiij. Ante mortem been fac amico. Do of thy good to thy power brother
et crestyn freynd. For almows done i^ the live is of mor Wayl than after the
deeth. By this that oon pe^ny that thou ghyuyes i^ thy live yes mor Worth than
oon ho^dreth after thy death so yt by ghewyn for the low of god. Et self We
shoold len to owr nyghtbowr in his necessyte. luce.vj. Mutuu^ da^tes nichil
inde sperantes. That is to say that We shoold le^ to owr nyghtbowr With out
vsur no hop to have any proffyt ower the principal. We shoold also forghewe the
fawtys the qwych as beyn doo^ to owes biWoord or by deeth as to the ra^cur and
tokyn of yt / and of dysplaysans. We shoold not judge no man no tra^slayt the
dey dys of other as owr nygtboures in ewyl part / bot i^ the most profytabyl is
after the Word of owr rede^ptur. Nolite iudicare no^ iudicabimini By thyes is
vndersto^dyt that the Weyrkys of other shoold by interpretyt to the bettyr part
after the said veyrkys Wythowt yt War al manyfestly ewyl. Et certa^ly that to
judge ewyl the Weyrkyes of other of this procedys oon of the two causys or by
this or he that is iuged is ewyl et for that he belyffis ych oon is lyk to him
after the say of saint crystome.

Ois ho^ scdm se estimat alteru^ Certa^ly With pain We shoold have suspeccio^
ewil to oon good man and of contrary With pain oonewyl man may have good
suspeccyon of oon other. The segund cause is the rayso^ that We do mayk ewyl
iugeme^s is for that he that iugys ewyl things so of oon other that their
Weyrkys shoold belyk and as ewyl affection to him of the qwych he has the
foresaid suspeccyon and ewyl estymacyo^ the qwych procedys by fawlt of charity
et by this qwych said is opynly that this qhyft of the holy gheost aforsayd
puttys away all the syn of sweyrnes.

THe.vj. ghyft of the holy gheost is the ghyft of dreyd the qwych also soon is
yt cu^ is i^ owr saowl yt ghewys syndry goodys first yt teychys Ws and owr
saowl to mend owr ewyl synnys that are by passyt. yt techys to do Weyrkys.
Ecclesi. v. Qui timet deu^ faciet bona. This ghyft kepyes the man and causys
hi^ to perfeweyr i^ good Weyrkys. Dreyd of god dyssernys to have the meyrcy of
god. Et gheuys the man long live et prowysyon of things te^porells as after
the say of the profyt. Timete dn^oe^s scti^ eius qm^ no^ est inopia time^tibus
eum. Dreyd makys the orayson to be hard With god. Volu^tate^ time^tiu^ se facit
and deprecacione^ eorum exaudiet / inquit psalmi. Dreyd dyssernys the live and
joy ewyrlesta^d prouerbiorum.xxviij. Beatus ho^ qui semper e^ pauidus. The
ghyft of dreyd puttys away al pride.

THe.vij. et last dreyd of god yes the ghyft of fors spyrytwell by qwych the
holy gheost co^fortys the saowl i^ three mayners. First to beyr the aduersyt is
pacie^tly after the say of the appoystyl. Pacie^tes estote ad oe^s. Segu^dly
the said ghyst confortys the saowl to owercu^ the dewyl after the say of saint
iamys. Resistite dyabolo and fugiet avobis. And the thryd Way the said ghyft of
the holy gheost confortys the saowl et techys to do good Werkys as after the
say of saint ioon. Operati oportet donec dies e^ Et by this ghyft (...) put
awa^ the syn of y^a. Et ^^ys su^^y^ of the said.vij. ghyftys of the holy gheost.

HE^^ after in this present cheptur We shall speyk of the Werkys of meyrcy

Answer. All the sacramens after the percepcyon of the qwych the caracter is not
prentyd in the saowl. This apperys.xxxij q. vij. Licite and.j. q. Quod quide^
Caracter is oon qualyte spyry twel being i^ the saowl disposa^t to grace the
qwych qwalyte and car^^tyr dwellys perpetwel in the saowl. Et is not the said
caracter prentyd bot in three oonly.

That is to Wndersto^d i^ the sacrem^t of baptysyng i^ the qwich the faith is
enge^dryth. Et by this caracter is dywydyt the crystyn pewpyl from the
wnfaithful. Segu^dly the sacreme^t of co^firmacyo^ i^ the qwych the faith yes

the qwych much greyt Wertu is gheuyn and grantyt and to the qwych by i^pressyon
of the said caracter man is sa^tyfyd et hallowed in the seruys of god and holy
church. Et by this is separyd and dywyd yt from the pewpyl that are lawd. Et by
this cleyrly apperys that the said three sacremens baptysyng co^fyrmacyon / and
ordyr / may not by reytyred no taykyn bot oon tym. All the other.iiij. marriage /
penna^s the sacreme^s of the anter et vnxyon may be reytyryd and resawyt maynay

ANd ve shall sey heyr after of ych oon sacrament by ordyr. Et first of the holy
sacrement of baptysyng / et shall say after saint augustyn that their is three
mayners of baptysyng the qwyche the first is clepyd propyrly baptysyng of flood
oonly. The segund is clepyd the baptysyng of blood of the qwych is Wryttyn
Iohannis.xij. baptismo. Hoc habeo baptisari. Et the thryd is callyt baptysyng
of the holy gheost of the qwych yt is Wryttyn i^ the deydys of the appoystyls
in the segund cheptur. do aute^ baptisamini spiritu sancto. Thyr two last
baptysyngys of blood et of speryt ar clepyd baptysynges for they supply the
trust of the first baptysyng the qwyche clengys the saowl. Al Ways the segund
baptysyng that We clep baptysyng of blood excedys the first baptisyng as to the
reward accydental as to the lawreol the qwych is awyn to them that are baptisyt
of the said baptising of blood and not to the other. Et also doys as to the
reward esse^cyal after Petyr of palude i^ the.iiij. For the said baptisyng of
blood ghewys mor grace after this that yt is mor greyt veyk meritoyr as is
martyr. Thought yt be so that the caractyr of the for said by not i^prentyt by
the said baptysyng of blood as yt is by the first baptisyng of the flood

Et yt is thus before said baptysyng of blood as to growyn men qwych has parfyt
aage and to owng chyldryn now boorn or qwych ar i^ the motheres vaam. for
suppoes yt that the said ong chyldryn War yt With i^ their motheres vaam and
that they workyllyd for jesus christ / that is to Wnderstond for the detestacion
of the crystyn faith the qwych their pare^s holdys they shoold be ce^syt and
reputyt and taykyn martyrs after the docturs / et after petyr palude i^ his
said.iiij. Et it War so that the said mothers War strykyn i^ dyspyt of owr
redemptur jesus christ / et that they partyd With their chyldryn or that they war
kyllyd in any maynayr i^ dyspyt of owr faith their chyldryn shoold by faithful
martyrs et baptysyd of the said segund baptysyng. The thryd baptysyng of the
gheost before said is no other thing bot to have Werray propos to resayf and
tail the first baptifyng dewly if they have time et faculte. Et this baptisyng
co^petys not ^ot oonly to them that are growyng et cum to aage et has the vsayge
of rayson. Et certanly thies baptisi^g of the gheost a not eqpollent to the
first i^ a^^ thyngys / forth is baptysyng of the gheost al pain that We shoold
have sorrow synnys is not for ghewyn is yt is by the first. Bot rethar yt is
mor or les forghewyn after the devotion of him the qwych refa^ys it. Et also by
this baptysyng the caracter above said is not pre^tyd in the saowl. Et shoold
by et he dyed before or he had rescuyt the first baptisyng he shool^ not by
grauyt no erthdyt i^ holy church et also of yt shoold by pryuyt. thought it be
so that holy church prays for them that dies so Et for that their to that sych
pewpyl by sawyt by Wertu of the said baptisyng of the gheost yt is requyryd
that they have Werray co^tricyon the qwych is not requiryd to the first
baptysyng of flood bot yt suffys that they qwych resawys and i^ ar i^ parfyt
aage have attricyon oonly. Et this suffys of the foresaid baptysyngys of blood
et of the gheoft. For mine inte^cyon ye to declayr of the baptysi^g of flood. Et
for this cause yt is neydful to sey qwat is baptisyng. The master of the
sente^s i^ the.iiii. i^ his dyst^^ctyon says that baptysyng ye oon purgacyon
own wart of the man With oon rettayn form of voordis. Et yt i^ to not in this
bapt^syng is three things. The first is the thing of the sacrament al oonly.
That is to Wnderstond infusyon of grace and fo^gheuy^^^ of the fyn. The sag^nd
is sacrament oonly that is to Wnderstond Water clengand With form gheua^^ of
the Woordys. Et the thryd is the sacrament and the thing tha^ is to Wnderstond
the caracter. Et verytably this sacrament of baptisyng is the first / the port
and the fo^d^me^t of all the sacreme^^. For We gheue not i^ the church to no
mayneyr of peupil any of the other sacrame^s bot they by first baptisyd / et by
this qwych said is apperys that vater simpyl and natural hauand might to de^ge
is matyr conuer^^byl of thies said sacrament and that We may not baptys in no
other lyqwer bot i^ cleen vater. As yt apperys de bap. et eius effectu. c. Non
vt. Et for that Waters styllyd as Water of rosys or other shoold not by matter
sufficya^d of this sacrament bot Water of sey et Water of marres and Water
passi^ throw the us / may by matter of this sacrament in cas of neyd for the
kind of Water by dye in theem also may We say of the Waters that passys by the
Waynes of the earth full of flyme or of byrnstoon. Et indowttably Water of boo
wit or of flech myxyt With buttyr or With qwat other tallow no Water myxt With
vyd qwych has mor gowst of Wyn than of Water and spyshyng no Water of beyr no
good haal may not by matter suffycyand of this sacrament and We may not baptys
of them no be baptysyd. The form of this foresaid sacrament is sych. I the
baptys i^ the nom of father / et of the soon / et of the holy gheost / Amen.
They may ash qwat is the affec and the Wertu of this sacrament.

Answer The affec is sych that yt doys et puttys away from them that ressawys
yt Woethyly al cowlp orygynal deydly and Wenyaly and restorys the first
innocens as to the saowl, yt flakys the fire of hell and of progatory as to him
that ye baptysyd. Et taysays away of the satisfaccyon to the qwyche man Was
bownd et holdyn in this World for his synnys.

This apperys / for if any iow or sarrasyn had lyuyt oon thousand eyr et that
he had done ewyryche day oon thousand deydly synnys et if he repentyt et Would
(...) the faith of jesus christ and be baptysyd dewotly not fayna^d they shoold
not gheue no i^ put to him any pe^nans satysfactoyr. For the baptysyng as said
is / puttys away al oblygacyon and clenges the saowl i^ sych maynayr if the
said. Iow thus baptysyd dyed of this present World his saowl Would fle in hewyn
With out suffryng any pain in purgatory. Et by this cleyrly aperys that the
Women ar fowlych that Weypys the deeth of thayr chyldryn qwych ar deyd in the
stayt of innocen^ after this that they have beyn baptysyd or before that they
have lesyt the innocens et baptysyng for the said chyldryn they go from the
company of men in the company of angels et of the Waly of terys et Wepyngys in
the gloyr of hewyn. Et certa^ly the rayson is good / for the said sacrament is
ordaynyt for to regenyr and inressawant the said baptysyng man passys and goyes
of thy might of tenebrys in adopcion of the soon of god. Et thayr ar gheuyn by
the said baptysyng gracys and Wertus secu^dum glo. iij.c.ij. de co^se. di. iiij
Et if they ash at me to Wnderstond if the effec of the said sacrament is
grantyt and to al men egaly qwych ressawys the said sacrament. Answer. After
sant Bonawa^tur in his.iiij in the dystynctyon.iiij. in the first artykyl et
questyon.iij. of the first perty qwych says thayr is trypyl effec of baptysyng.
The first is the impressyon of the caracter above said. The segu^d his the
infusyon of grace Et the thryd the rystora^s of innocens. Al cristyn men
resawys egaly the effec of baptysyng if they resawyf yt but fyccyon. Bot this
they do not as to the segu^d for that grace the qwych is ghewyn on to the said
baptisyng and other sacramens as two effeckys. That is to Wnderstond to do away
the syn. Et as this cause yt doys away mor the fyn in him qwych mor as co^myttyt
for yt doys away al cowlp. Et the segu^d effec is to dyspos to good. Et as to
this yt as mor greyt effycas in him qwych is most goodly dysposyd. By this We
shoold Wnderstond that the effek of the said sacryment has oone self effycas as
ong chyldryn new boorn. As to the effec bot not to the^ that are baptysyd aftyr
this that they are cu^myt to the e arrys of dyscrecyon. Et yff they ash / that
of awentur that oon child War kyllyd qwen We do beyr yt to be baptisyd shoold
yt by sawyt ordaynyt. Answer. if yt War kyllyd there to that be ire he War not
baptysyd of the holy sacryme^t of baptisyng and of jesus christ by dyspyt We
should beleyf that the var sawyt as above as said / is bot and he var kyllyd for
other caws he shoold be dampnyt and punyshyd in hell of pain and of do^mage
oonly. That is that he shoold les and by prywyt of the Wysyon of god. Et yt may
also be ashed / if oon ferwe^tly beleyffyt that he War baptysyd and that he War
not really if he shall be sawyt.

Answer. e / yt apperys in the cheptur Apostolicam de pre. non bapti. I ash
mor ower / if oon sich not baptisyd belyffyng that he War baptysyd et faithful
crystyn man et that he did tayk the holy ordrys resayffys he the caracter.

Answer. No yt apperys de presbi. no^ bap. c. j. et. c. Veniens. Bot if he did
do mes ignora^tly and that he beleyffyt that he War baptysyd et had resawyt the
said caracter he sacrys for that the virtue of the holy gheost is vegetatyff and
confortys the church et holpys the might to co^sakyr i^ him thar to that is
church by not dyssawyt. yt may be ashyd qwen shoold oon child or oon other
vsa^t of rayson by baptysyd Answer. As to small chyldryn the docturs says that
they shoold inco^tynent by baptysyd First for the dangeyr et peril of deeth as
yt apperys de conse. di. iiij. Venerabilis. Segundly for that the dewyllys
should not have so greyt might on them after that they are baptysyd as before
qwych says sant denis vltimo capit. Celestis ierachie. Et certa^ly yt is hard
to excus the syn of them that deferrys along time the baptysyng of their
chyldryn. Et I beleyff not that they may ewayd deydly syn qwyche baptysys their
chyldryn in their hows With out keypyng gheuant sole^nyte pryncypaly qwen their
is no necessyte bot oonly doyes abydyng the gossopys for to do mor greyt pride
their after. Et thought yt be that they beyr the said chyldryn to the church
after that they have him baptysyd for to supply the solemnytys that Was not a
for done al Ways they that holdys the said chyldryn are not godfatherys. For
they hold the^ not to by baptysyd suppos that they War rebaptysyd for that they
War onys baptysyd in the hows that qwych apertenys not bot to pryncys bot in
the cas of necessyte. Et certa^ly i^ the first baptysi^g they have had for
godfathers and godmothers the^ that has baptysyt them et holdyn. Et in this ar
maynay abusyons et decepcyons. Et as to them that as vsayge of rayson et ar
inparfyt aage et Wald by baptysyd be they iowys or sarrasyns if their by no
peril of deeth inco^tynent they shoold be techyt i^ the faith by the tym and
spays of.viij. month or other time ghanant there to / the arbytrayge et Will of
them qwych techys them before that they be baptysyd. Et so should We Wndersto^d
the cheptur Iudei cu^ se. de. co^se. di. iij. bot et their War peril of
apeyrand deeth they should be baptysyd i^co^tynent after that they have exposyd
them the artyclys of the faith. The tym propyr for to baptys sych pewpyl With
out they be in peril of deeth ye hestyr and Wytsoonday. Et it is to not that if
their be any preyst qwen they baptys the chyldryn or otheyrs / the preyst
shoold baptys themet for fawlt of oon preyst oon cleyk if their by oon. Et
qweyr their yes no preyst no clerk oon lawd man should do yt et may do yt if he
by present. Et qwayr their is no man than oon Woman may do and not other Wys.
de. conse. di.iiij. Mulier et c. Romanus. xxx. q. iij. c. Super. Et certa^ly if
any clerk qwych is not preyst baptysyd With out necessyte he shoold by censyt
irregulyer ca.i. de cleai. non ordi. mi. Bot i^ cas of necessyte ewyrych oon
may oonly baptys bot he is holdyn in deyd / otherwys he synnys deydly et for
cause yt is good that ewyrych oon shoold leyrn the form of baptysyng above said
that is I the baptys i^ the nam of the father / et of the soon / et of the holy
geost. amen. Et yt suffys that thayr be oon parson qwych says the said for me.
For maynay should not say yt ageyns sum fowlysh Women qwych in baptysyng in cas
of necessyte says.iiij. or.v. at onys the said Woordys and yt is lyk to them
that the child is goodlyar baptysyd it is also to notyfy that no parson in qwat
cas of necessyte that they be in they may not baptis them self. c. debitum. de
bap. Et also yt is to notyfy that also much is oon child is clos i^ the Waam of
is mother With out any appeyrens of al or of oon party With out may not be
baptysyd / for the segund natyuite presupposys the first. Et it is neydful to
notyfy that he or sho qwych baptysys shoold have handys et Word / as this cause
oon that spekys not may not baptys. Et thought yt by that oon manqwych had no
ha^dys said the Woordys et that oon man that has not spyech Warteyt The child
of Water he War not baptysyt after the most hol opinion of docturs. Always
petir of palud is of opinion that he War baptysyd. Et certa^ly in cas of
necessite if any goyes to oon Wnfaythful man be he iow or sarraiayn heretyk or
cowrsyt et prays that he baptys him et that he say thyr Wordys heyr I the
baptyes in the nam of the father and of the soon et of the holy gheost. ame^.
if this herytyk or coursyt iow or sarrayn baptys him after the intencyon of him
qwych ashes to by baptysyd et that he Wnderstondys to do yt that they do that
baptysys in the church / et this that the church doys and Wndersto^dys he
shall be baptysyd dewly. Al tym the above sacrament of baptysyng shoold not by
ressawyt no takyn of oon herytyk no of oon cursyt no of oon that is suspendyd
as that says innocens i^ the cheptur. Fraternitati. de. cleri. ix. co^. mini.
Bot i^ the cas of necessyte. Et he qwych doys vylfully baptys from fych pewpyl
With out the said cas of necessyte resayffys not the said grace the qwych is
gheuyn to the said sacrament.i. q. multi. et. c. sequenti. For the qwych doys
so / ryghtly ageyns the ordyna^s of holy church he synnyes deidly. Et it may be
ashed that qwen oon Woman is in pain of child et dangyer of deeth et that
apperys any thing of the said child by yt fut or hond if yt may be baptysyt.
Landowlfus in his.iiij. in the distinccyo^ iiij. et first qwestyon holdys if
that fut or hond apperys they should i^ the said cas of necessyte Water yt et
pronons the form of baptysyng above said. Al tymys says that if he cu^ after
above the earth he shoold by in thies mayneyr baptisyd if thou by not baptysyd.
I baptys the in the nam of the father and of the soon / et of the holy gheost /
ame^. Et Werytably in the said cas of nycessyte this qwych should by baptysyd by
rayson of the operacyon occ^lt et secret of the holy gheost. Et as this opinion
full of cleme^s and right sowyr the qwych holdys sant thomas and rychart i^
the.iiij. of the sente^s to the qwych We shoold gheue faith. Thought yt be that
their is of other opynyons of other docturs We may ash if oon mo^styr cu^mys
above the earth the qwych has two hedys.iiij. fyeth et two bakys et yt Wa^
se^blabyl to have two faowllys it is to Wndersto^d if ve shoold baptys theem

We dowt if their War two faowlys or oon their for that yt has.iiij. handys two

after the other Wndyr condytyon fayand asthus if thou by not baptysyd I the
baptys in the na^ of the father and the soon etces. Et also yt may be ashyd if
We shoold baptys the chyldryn of i^wys qwen they are new boorn in so much that
they at in the slayt of innocens. Answer. Of this their is diueres syndry

that they the qwych as parfyt aage ar bown din to repent them self of the

Et Werytably.vj. thyngys ar requyry^ to the said sacrement of confyrmacyon. Two
of the partys et coyst of the sacrament in yt self. That is to understand the
matyr of the crime / et the form of the Woordys qwych is sych I the tokyn of
the sing of the co^ and confermys of the crime of salut in the nam of the
father and of the soon et of the holy geost amen. Two thyngys ar requyryd of
the part of the mysteyr / that is to Wndersto^d that he be bishop et that he
have dew et right inte^cyon to do yt that holy church Wnderstondys. Et fynaly
two thyngys ar requyryd of the party et cost of him that resawys.

That is to Wnderstond the front in the qwyche shoold be maid the sygnacyon et
vnxyon of the said creym. Et that the said confermyt shoold by baptysyt. Et yt
is to not that the vnxyon of the creym ye maid in three placys as three sacreme^s
qwyche imprentys the caracter of the qwyche has beyn spokyn heyr before. For the
said vnxyon as beyn maid above the hye of the heyd in baptysyng for toknyng the
resauyng of the faith Et in the sacrement of ordyr is maid the said vnxyon in
the ha^dys for to sygnify the might of the co^sacryng of the body of jesus
christ. Et this vnxyon is maid in the for heyd in the sacrement of confyrmacyon
that he that is co^fermyt as hardynes to confess the nam of jesus christ. Et
certanly the gracys emundant ^lengys the syn the qwych is ghewyn in ewyrych
sacrement not oonly yt is ghewyn to this sacrement of confyrmacyon bot With
this specyal grace by the qwych he that is confermyt is lawful to confess et
proclaym constantly the nam of iesucryst. The qwych is neydful to grant that he
his Werray god et man. For yt is neydful to grant that he is egal to the father
et to the holy gheost in godly nature. For qwych is notyd i^ the form of the
voordys of the trynyte is exprymyd. Segundly yt is neydful that the confess that
jesus christ has sufferd deyd et passion on the tree of the cors as to the
humanyte. The qwych is notyd in the toknyng of the cors the qwych is maid in
the for heyd. Et spyrytwelly this sacreme^t ornys We of spyrytwell beawte out
Wart and inwart. Inwart of purte of co^scyens et infusyon of grace. Et owtwart
by swetnes of good nam. Et thyr two thyngys ar be toknyt by the creym the qwych
ye maid and composyt of hoylly as to the first / et of bawm as to the segund.
This sacrament grathys the saowl to battayll spyrytwelly and for that al
cristyn men ar in the said battayll as this cause they should resayf thies
sacreme^t there to qwych might mor lightly ageyns the dewyl and the World et the
flech / for saint esperyt is ghewyn i^ this sacrement for to fortyfy the saowl.
Et for that not oo^ly ornys / bot vyth that the body by this that the saowl is
ornyt of the caracter / and the body of the buccleyr of the cors, Et i^ this
sacreme^t the cristyn men ar maid full of plynytud and of habo^dans / the qwych
i^ the sacreme^t of baptisyng has being maid full of plenytud and suffysa^s.
This sacreme^t crownys the saowl after that the e^nemy is ower cu^myt this
qwych is toknyt by the band the qwyche the heyd is bownd. Et certa^ly this
sacreme^t should by resawyt dewo^ly With out co^scyens of deethly syn for he
qwych refawys Wyttanly in deethly syn vyth out that they have propos to confess
them of the said syn in tym and placys ghanant their to he sinnys deethly. This
forsaid sacreme^t should not be reyteryd and sinnys deebtly he that reyteres yt
With his Wyttyng. They may ash if oon person not co^fermyt may hold oon other
parson that resawis the said sacreme^t. Answer. No / yt apperyes i^ the cheptur
In baptismate de conse. di. iiij. Et if that person not confyrmyt holdys him
qwych is confyrmyt their enge^dryth no god fathershyp bytwyx them. if they ash
how maynay parso^s ar requiryd for to hold any other to the said sacrament of
co^fyrmacion. Answer. Oon oonly / as i^ baptisyng / as yt apperys i^ the
cheptur. No^ plures de co^se. di. iiij Et Werytably the man shoold not hold his
Wife / no of contrary for empescheme^t qwych shoold enge^dyr ettwys them as to
the det of marriage. Et in cas of necessyte he the qwych has holdyn oon other i^
baptysyng or in cathesymy / that is to say in exorcysme instruccyon et techyng
qwyche is maid at the port of the church above him qwyche shoold be baptysyt
may bold him Weyl in this sacreme^t of co^fyrmacyon and no otherwys of honesty
/ thought yt be so that he may do yt With out syn. Et of them that holdys him
they are godfathers of him or of her qwych they hold yt apperys (...) the
cheptur fynal. de cognat^^^ spiri. ^ib. vj. Et this suffycy^ of the sacreme^t
of confyrmacion.



Beyr after ve shall sey of the sacryment of pe^nans right neydful by the qwyche
the syn is for ghewyn always to the^ that are Worthyly dysposyd The master of
sente^s says in the.iiij. in his distynccyon.xiiij That pennans is oon Wertu by
the qwych We pleyne and haytys the ewyl synnys that We have co^myttyd With
purpos to amend them / and by the qwych We powrpos to do no mor the said synnys
be this pleynant et Wepant. Et yt is to notyfy that thayr is.v. maneyr of
pe^nans. The first is clepyd pennans sole^nel. Of this penna^s I Will mayk no
other determynacyon for cause of shortness et by that yt is not i^ usage. The
segu^d is pe^nans opyn for cause yt is opynly done in the face of the church. Et
dyfferys from the above foresaid pe^nans i^ three maynayrs of thyngys. First i^
the maynayr that yt is not kepyt in oon as in oon other. Segundly by this that
this pennans publyk may not be input by oon simpyl confesseur / et the sole^nel
by the bishop oonly if the coustum did lat yt. The thryd mayner this pe^nans
publyk may be reyteryd / et the above said pennans sole^nel may not be
reyteryd. And if they ash me qwen shoold be imput pennans solemnel et pennans
publyk. Answer Panorme says in his cheptur. Quesitum de penitencia and remi.
That pennans solemnel shoold be input for oon greyt and grewous syn the qwych
scla^drys al oon cite. Et for pennans publyk shoold be i^ put for oon syn the
qwych sclandrys not al oon cite. Says mor if the syn by grewous and so greyt We
shoold not put no gheue pe^nans publyk no solemnel. As this cause reprowys the
said panorme the cowstu^ of the^ qwych gheuys pe^nans publyk te Women. The
qwych by myskeypyng as smoryt their chyldryn the qwyche did lay them in bed
With them et yt may be ashed also to qwom shoold by i^ posyd the said pennans
solemnel. Answer. yt shoold not by inposyd to clerkys no to relygyows no to
lawd pewpyl ordaynyt in dygnyte of offys. This the qwych is faithful of oon
clerk if hewar not deposyd be. The thryd pennans is clepyt pryuay pennans of
the qwych is Wndersto^dyt the dystyncyo^ of the pennans aforsayd. Et in the
qwych yt is ghanant first to consider that he qwych resawys. Would that his syn
War punyshyd. Et that he detestys et has abhomynacyon of his syn doing by him
desyrant to his vyl that he had newyr doo^ it. Thrydly that he accep Wylfully
the punyshon and pain to him doing for his sand synet that finaly he do beyr
yt pacie^tly. In thyr.iiij. thyngys consystys propyrly the propryety of this
voord heyr pe^nans. They ash commonly of qwat synnys shoold oon man confess
him. Answer of al deethly synnys doyeng by him before is baptysyng and after.
The confession of venyel sinnyes thought it be that they be expedye^t always yt
is not neydful in this World bot to the salwt bot i^ two mayners The first qwen
the man dowtye if the syn is deydly or Wenyel / than sholod he confess the said
syn thayr to that he expos him not to peril. Segundly qwen the parson has any
affection Wenyel and that he dowtys that he shryuis him not. That yt draw him
not no deidly syn. Than for rayson of peril he shoold co^fess and shryne him /
as that says sant bonave^tur i^ the iiij. dystyncyo^.xvj. i^ the segund
qwestyon and segund artykyl. Et certanly We shoold repent us of ewyryche oon
deethly syn the qwych We Wnderstond to have done qwen yt cu^ys to the
remenbrens. Et We are holdyn to thynk specyal to ewyrych oon syndoyng their to
that We may repent. Always after this that We have thought that by ignora^s
inwysybyl and excusybyl We may not have mind of sinnys doing their to that We
may repent them and al i^ general bot and if the ignorans War i^ excusabyl We
shoold by holdyn to repent in especyal. For ewyrych oon ye holdyn to do
dylygens of al his body and saowl to remenbyr his synnys thayr to that he may
repent him. They ash commonly if We may do pe^na^s of oon deethly syn With out
oo^ other. Asweyr. No for god forgheuys all the deethly synnys or he forgheuys
not / as for this cause yt is expedye^t to repent of al. The text is fo. 55.
Item. de. pe. di. iij. For to the Weryte if We speyk of pe^na^s i^ so much is
aes the cowlp and oblygacyo^ is to pain ewyrlesta^d it is put away by pe^na^s
and man co^sylyt With god / aes thought yt be that charity the qwich may not
bepertyd / suffyr no thoyll deydly syn With yt so that yt is out of
satiffaccyo^ followys that pe^na^s may not by doyeng bot yt by doing of al
deydly sinnys to gydder. Always if We Will speyk of pe^na^s i^ so much yt be
holdis ryghtly the satisfaccyon temporel of the pain dettyt for the synnys now
forghewyn as to the cowlp / pe^nans may veyl by doyn of oon syn With out oon
other and not otherwys. yt is neidful after to understood how manay pertys of
pennans thayr is. Answer. Three / contrycyon / co^fessyon and satisfaccyon.
Co^trycion after sant bonawe^tur i^ the iiij. in the dyst.xvj. in the first
artykyl et first qwestyon says that co^trycion is oon dolor and sorrow et oon
Wylful dysplaysa^s taykyn of the synnys that are doyeng With certain perpos to
co^fess him and to mayk satysfaccyo^. Et yt is to not that aes that We say that
oon thing is almost anichylyd and that is to say of noght qwen yt is brokyn in
three small pertis. Et qwych it is brokyn qwen yt is oonly dyuysyt i^ great pertys
sych lyk and by oon fymylytud ve say that the heart of the man is hard qwen he
ghewys not placys to the godly inspyracyon the qwych twychys him also as With
the hold or With oon other thing hard resysta^t also much has he bydys in the
affection to do syn. Bot qwen the said affection of syn is holyly distruyt and
that the vyl of syn depertys than We say that the heart us co^tryt. Et We say
that yt is brokyn qwen he taykys to have any sorrow and propos of Will to leyf
his syn than We say that the heart is co^tryt bot always he twrnys perfytly. Et
than shoold he by clepyt attryt et not co^tryt. Et as this co^trycyon attrycyo^
as dyffere^s / for attrycyon is oon sorrow inperfyt of the syn as said is. Et
co^trycyon is oon dolor perfyt. Segu^dly actrycyon is oon sorrow the qwych is
With out grace doyeng greabyl the qwych is maid thankful by confession and
absolucyo^ sacrame^tal. Et of attrycyo^ maid contrycyo^ bot qwych the penyte^t
put not no obys to the holy gheost. Et contricyo^ is oon sorrow perfyt of the
syn With grace mayka^d man tha^kful to god. et for to have perfyt contricyo^
aes to have hop forgheuynes procedys of the meyrcy of god. Et dreyd of pain by
the co^syderacyo^ of the iustys of god. Et Werytably man shoold have i^ his Will
oon sorrow and dyspleysans of his syn qwych should be right great i^ the regard of
other sorowys that We may have of things temporells For oon cause that oon man
shoold by streynyt to choos to syn deethly or to ryn i^ any damage te^porel or
to suffer bodyly deeth. He should so^nar leys all the goodys of the vorld and
suffer deeth / tha^ to syn deydly and i^ this Will shoold We live and die. Et al
tymys et how maynay tymys that oon person has thought of his deethly sinnys self
after the for gheuynes of the synnys We shoold detest and have co^trycyon and
dysplaysans of their synnys. Et their is non proposycyo^ for to not perpetuelly
that yt be so that oon ma^ne oon voma^ may not have sorrow no have dysplaysa^s
of the dylectacyon that they have doyeng deidly syn no of this that they have
had oon child i^ adwltery qwych is oon man of good / always they are not fowrth
of the stayt of salut bot yt suffycys that they have sorrow and dysplaysa^s that
they have had sych dylectacyo^ to have engendryth sych oon child by that
maynayr disordaynyt and of fe^sa^t god that is to say doyeng ageyns the
ordyna^s et forbyddyng of the conma^dyme^s of god. yt may be ashet qwat is the
affec of contricyo^. Answer. That is the remyssyo^ of the cowlp and of pain /
apperies. de. pem. de. iij. The segu^d of pe^na^s is co^fessyo^ Hostye^s says
that co^fessyo^ is oon lawghful declaracyo^ of their propyr sinnys doyeng before
the preyst by him qwych is co^tryt or actryt. Et so shoold co^fees us th^yr to
that ve mayk satiffacyo^ to god and to the church the qwych as grewyt and that
to that they have forgheuynes of their sinnys. By this apery^ that he qwych
shryuy^ him by void gloy^ or qwath other evil cynd synnys deethli / for he that
shoold ^ow in the eynd of the sacrament she also qwych shryuis the syn that he
baes not ^oon synnys deethly qwen his conscye^s says to him that he has not
doyeng the said syn / and qwych the said syn shoold be mortel if it had beyn
doyn / qwych is veel to not. Et We shoold Wnderstond i^dowtabil that after that
oon is Werytabyl sheywyn ve are not holdyn of necessite to reyter the said
co^fessyo^. The pape may not maykthe law by the qwych that he shoold command
him after pettyr palud. Et for that to do this / is no man holdyn^ if by good
co^seyl he Would not do yt thayr to that mor often he shoold have forgheuynes of
his syn this qwych if that he do yt syndry tymys shryuand him apperys. de. pe.
di. i. cap. Mensura^. That docturs in the iiij. of the se^tens i^ the
distinccyo^ xvij. assygne^t may nay caves in the qwych oon person is holdyn to
say ageyn his confessyo^ and confess his synnys of the qwych I leyf for caves of
shoortnees. The.iiij. perty of pe^na^s is satyffaccyo^ the qwych aes to the
co^lp by passyd is no other thing bot reco^pensing of the Wrang now gheuyn
after the qualyte of iustys. Et as to the rowlp to ^^ys no other thing to ^ut
^^tayk away the causys of the syn. Et We shoold not gheue enter to the
sugestyo^s of the synnyes apper^es de. pe. di. iij. c. Satiffaccio. Et
veritabily satisfaccio^ i^ so much that yt is party of pe^na^s is in other
thing bot solucyo^ of the pain dettyd for the syn. The qwych ewirich oo^
penitent sh^^^ Wylfully tayk et fulfill. Et is to notify that satyffaccyon has
three pertys i^ yt / orayson / fasting / et almows / et ar thyr three said partys
pryncypal the other as vechyngys / pilgrimage and dyscyplyns les prencypals. Et
y^ to notyfy that all the Werky^ afflyctiuys of the body ar re^^^cyt to fasting.
Al Weyrkye of meyrcy spyrytwells to orayso^ Et certanly if We Weyl speyk
generaly thayr ye three thyng^ i^ satyffaccyo^ that is to say shawyng of the

ANd ve shall sey heyr after of the sacryment of the holy awter in the qwych owr

THe.v. sacrement of owr mother the holy church is the sacrement of vnxyon The
matter of thyes sacrement is the vly sacryt by the blyshop oonly et that of
noles no of him self. Bot the form of this Sacrement after sant thomas is oon
orayson de precatyf of the qwych the translacyo^ followys i^ nyglysh. God by
this holy vnxyon and ye most pyteabyl meyrcy Wald forgheue the all that thou has
synnyt by seeing / eyryng / thwchyng et gwstyng and smellyng and of al other
Wyttys and pertyes of thy body in the na^ of the father and the soon and of the
holy gheost ame^. Et thies may be oonly ghewyn by oon preyst to seyk men being
in the peril of deeth of the qwych We dowt that thayr be aperans of deeth. and
We should not gheue the holy sacrem^t of vnxyo^ / aes the common opinyo^ of
doctures as to chylderyn or to the^ that goyees to batayl no to other that are
orday nit i^ sychlyk peril of death no to Woydme^ so long that they be i^ their
folyshnees With out they ash yt the^ being cler and of hool Wnderstondyng. Et
bonawen tur doctur seraphyque holdys i^ the.iiij. in his distynctyo^.xxiij that
this sacrement shoold oonly be ghewyn to seyk qwych are not in deethly syn and
qwych h^^ rayso^ and ar i^ the artykyl of deeth and qwych has not bot Wemal
synnys and no other. Et yt is to not that We shoold oynt the eyn the eyrys /
the hondys the nos the feyt and the neyrys. Always We shoold not oynt the
neyrys ^f Women for rayson of honesty. They qwych ar dowm et bly^ shoold by
oyngtyd in the parties most neyr of the said me^brys if they have them not in
the stait that they may be oynt tyd. Et certanly this sacrement may be reyteryd
With out any iniure doyn to the said sacrement for that their is not effec
perpetwel and that the heelth of the body and the saowl qwych is the effek
pryncypal of the said Sacremen^ may be losyt after that they ^^ue recowyryd. Et
for the if any parson is in peril (...) deeth and he shap the dang^^ and the
seyknes et that he cum to heelth / et that after that he fall in the said or lyk
seyknees he may resayf the said sacryment Et bonawentur repreuys the master of
the sentens qwych says that oon parson shoold not be oyngtyt two tymys in oon
^eyknes if the said seknes passys mor than oon eyr as he Would say that in oon
eyr oon man shoold not by oyngtyd two tymys for oon self seyknes this qwych the
said bonawentur reprewys and says that this shoold be oon thing dawyt et obsurd
that the sacryme^s War reygulyd after the mowyng et drawyngys of bodies
celestys. Et verytably if this sacreme^t War obmyttyd by dysprysyng et that We
dysprysyd yt this shoold be oon thing damnabyl Otherwyes shoold be if the said
sacryme^t War obmyttyd by neglygens. Et if they ash qwych yes the affek of
this said sacreme^t of vnxyo^. Answeyr Thayr is.iiij. effekys of the qwych sant

is ghewyn ageyns oon Wayknes the qwych body in Ws by rayson of orygynal syn /
by the qwych heelth spyrytwel man yes fortyfyed in taykyn this said sacrement.
Et for that grace doyes and gheuys this grace qwych may not suffyr fyn With yt
as this causyff yt fyndys any Wenyel syn yt doys yt away so doys yt the actwel

always the laft is formel in the regard to all the be foresaid. Et as thyes the
grace of the holy gheoft is infusyd in the last vnxyon. The thryd affecys that
this sacreme^t profytys to excyt to dewocyo^ Et also is for to morlyghtly fley
to the joy of hewyn. Et this suffycys as to the above said sacreme^t of lactyr

THe.vj. sacryment is the sacrement of ordyr of the qwych We shoold say syndry

With that they may sell yt yt is certain that god has three rewmyes the hewynly /
the eerthly and yt of hell. This reawm shoold be clepyt by the mayner of spekyng
/ he has ghewyn the rewm of hewyn to powyr pewpyl. The eerthly rewm to rych
pewpyl. Et the mawm of hell to the dewyllys. Always he has ordaynyt if that
they that are rich Will tayk and resayf the powyrs in this World in the eerthly
reawm that the said powyrs shall resayf them rych in live to cum in their reawm
of hewyn this apperys in sanc Luc in.xv. cheptur qwayr yt is Wryttyn. Facite
vobis amicos de ma^mona iniquitatis vt cum defeceritis recipiant vos in eterna
tabernacula. This is to say e rych Wordly mayk owr frendys of owr money gheuant
them to power pewpilthar to qwe^ e shall cum the howr of the deeth that the
bodyly Wertu shall fail ow that the said powyrs may refayf ow i^ the
tabernaculys and hewynly dwellyngys. Certanly sais sa^t augustyn the reawm of
hewyn is the powers. For the Werray powyr (...) thing in the eerth. Et the rych
as no thing in hewyn. Et in this apperys that god as dyscretyly maid al his
goodys and ghewyn them to two men the thyngys eerthly to rych et the thyngys
hewynly to powyr^. Always god Wys^and fayf the oon and the other (...)
did^ynyt that the rych ^esayf the powyrs ^^hys heritage / et the powyrs shall
resayf them in hewyn thayr to that ych oon by logyd oon by oon other. For
i^dowtably the rychyes qwych Will not refayf and nory^^ the powyrs pewpyl in
thayr reawm eerthly shall be refawyt of dewyllys in reawm and habytacyon of hell.
The segund beatytwd is. Beati mites. Bleshyd ar meyk men. This beatytwd ghanys
to the angels for qwen lucyfer and his angels co^myttyd pride / the good
angellys ferwyt meykly god. Et certanly they are so full of humylyte that they
thynk the^ not Wnwoorthy to serve and mynyster to Ws other qwych ar abhomynabyl
synnars. Et Werytably We may shoold have this beatytwd / yff We Will cum to the
company of angelle. Certanly they are not sweyt and meyk qwych ar impacyent et
prydful qwenthayr is said any Wrang to them. Et to this beatytwd god as ghewyn
on greyt promys ffor he promyttys that they qwych ar meyk humbyl and sweyt shall
possess the eerth of them of live that ye the reawm of hewyn. Et for that says
the Wenerabyl doctur bid if the reawm of hewyn is promised to powyrs / et the
earth to sweyt et meyk qwath restya theyrto prydful and to them full of ire bot
hellas he Would say. The yerestys no other thing. Et as thyes cause they mayk the
heyd of angels qwych honowrys god meykly. Et the prydful qwych dansys et
puttys their hartys to pompys and peydful arrayme^t of this World makys the
feyst to the dewyll followyng et servant him to their possybyl job xlj. Ipse
est rex super filios super^ie. The thryd beatytwd is Beati qui lugent. Bleshyd
ar they qwych. Wepys this beatytwd is ghayna^t to martyrs of the qwych yt is
said iohannys.xvj. Amen amen decovobies quia plorabitis vos et flebitis /
mu^dus autem gaudebit. I promys you says jesus crift to martyrs that e shall Weyp
and be sorrowful and tryst for the low of me in the World. That is to say the
Worldly pewpyl qwych martyrys ow shall be ioysum bot owr sorrow shall turn in
felycyte. Et certanly We may et shoold have this beatytwd. For as says sant
gregoyr that the thogt of the iowst is affectyd and profyt of.iiij. mayneyres
of perturbacyons / consydera^t qweyr he has beyn that is to say i^ syn qweyr
shall he by in horrybyl in geme^t. Et consyderant qweyr he is in myser
vrechydnes and banyshi^g. Et the plays qweyr he is not that yes in the gloyr of
hewyn. Et as this cause yt is not to by merwcyllyd if they weyp in this World.
As to thies beatytwd god promysys this qwych followys. Quoniam ipsi
consolabuntur. That is to say that they qwych Wepys shall be consolyd. And of
this consolacyon yt is Wayttyn in the poculypsys in the.vij. cheptur. God shall
tayk away the teyrys from cyn of his holy men qwych has Wepyd in this World.
The.iiij. beatytwd is Beati qui esurit^e and siciunt iustiriam. That is to say
they are blyshyd qwych has hongyr et thryst to do iustys. Et this beatytwd
ghanys to the prophe^ys qwych has ho^gyr to eye of breyd of iustys / of the
qwychys Wryttyn infant io^n in the.vj. cheptur. Ego sum panis vi^us qui de celo
descendi. They had thryst of the fontayn of the qwych is Wryttyn in the
psalmyst. Quoniam apud te fons vite est. God the fontayn of live is in the. Et
certa^ly We shoold have hongyr and thryst of this beatytwd of iustys gheua^t to
oon ych oon that qwych appertenys to god first / and to owr self / et to owr
nyghtbowr for We shoold gheue god four / and dreyd and to owr self pays and
owr heart and owr conscyens / pwrte et honesty i^ owr body. Et to owr nyghtbowr
do as We Would We War done to after the Word of jesus christ in sant mathow.
Omnia quecuque vultis vt vobis faciant homines et facite illies. Do to me^ all that the qwych ye Would War done to ow. Et certanly god promysys to men qwych
doys so. That they shall be fyllit and fed in hewyn of the ewyrlestand fruycyon.
The.v beatytwd is. Beati misericordes. Blyshid ar they the qwych doys meyrcy.
Et this beatytwd ghanys to the patryarkys insyslys to the^ that are lywyng to
her being to almows / et to do and fufyl the Weyrkys of meyrcy bodyly and
spyrytwelly / of the qwych We have spokyn heyr he for. Et certanly god promysys
them. Quod misericordia consequentur That yt is to say that so as e have beyn
meyrcyful sychlyk he shall do them meyrcy. First in this World temporelly qwen
yt is said / luce sexto. Date et dabitur vobis. For With great pain shall he be
maid powyr that gheuys of his goodys to powyr pewpyl. Et also god Will do them
meyrcy spyrytwelly yt apperyes in the segund cheptur to the corynthyens. Qui
seminat in benedictionibus de benedictionibus and metet. Qwych sawys the
blyshyng of almus in this present live shall resayf the blyshyng of grace in his
deeth / for almus followys the saowl at the departing of the body. For as says
sant ambros. The goodys that oon man may not beyr With him qwen he partys of
this World they are no mor his Their is no thing bot meyrcy qwych berys company
to deyd pewpyl qwen they part of this World. The.vj. beatwd is. Beatimundo
cord. Blyshyd ar they qwych ar cleyn of heart. This beatytwd ghanys to the
Wyergyns the qwych has had et kepys cleynes of heart and of body lywand
chastyly. Et certanly We shoold have this be atytwd thayr to that We may by
chaste in heart et keypyng Weyl cleynes to this that We be not pollyd and fylyd
by long abydyng i^ owr syn With thoghtyes and dylectacyo^s the qwyh ar deydly
syn qwen they are maid With consentyment of rayson. The self Ways We shoold
keyp owr body clenly With out that We by fyled of the syn of lychery as to the
deyd. For all the Werkys of lychery doye^g out of marriage is deydly syn. After
the say of the appoystyl qwych says. Quod oi^s fornicator aut i^mundus non
habet partem in regno dei. Et verytably god gheuys oon fair promise to them
qwich ar cleyn of heart. Quoniam ipsi deum videbunt. That is to say that they
that is cleen of heart may see god qwych is reward and beatytwd of al creatwr.
The.vij. beatytwd is. Beati pacifici. Bleshyd ar they that are of peys. This be
atytud ghanys to the confessurs qwych ar in pays of crystyens in them and
procurys pays to other so much is yt is to them possybyl We shoold have this
pays for thayr qwayr pays is god is to this pourpos says the psalmyst in the
psalm. lxxv. In pace factus est locus eius. The plays and dwelling of god is in
pays. Et sant ambros says. Pax est dux ad vitam eternam Pays is the duc and
leddar that leydyes the saowllies to ewyr left and live. Et saint crysostome
says. Vbi pax ibi omnia prosperabuntur. Quhayr pays is al thi^gys goyes Weyl
and they shall have prosperyte. Et as to this beatytwd god promysys oon great
promys. Quoniam filij dei vocabuntur. For they qwych ar payfybyl shall be called
the soonnys of god and hoyrs of the reawm of paradys. Et of contrary them of
dyscord ar the soonnys of the dewyl. Et as to this purpos says sant gregoyr if
they qwych procurys and lowys pays ar clepyd / the so^nyes of god indowtably
they are soonnys of satan qwych confondys and dystroys the pays the qwych is
newyr dystroyt of the earth bot by pride and auarys that is to say Wrechydnes
The.viij. beatytwd is. Beati qui persecucionem patiu^tur propter iusticiam.
Bleshyd ar they qwych suffrys and tholys persecucyon for rayson and causys of
iustys. This beatytwd is right neydful to all the holy me^ qwych ar in the World
/ and qwych Would pytwsly live in jesus christ and qwych Would serve him ryghtwsly.
And this aperys by the appoystyl qwych says in his segu^d cheptur the qwych he
Wryttys to his dyssypyl Thymothee in the thryd cheptur. Al they qwych Would live
goodly and pytwsly in jesus christ suffyrys and tholys the persecucyon of ewyl
men. Et jesus christ says in sant ioon in the.vj. cheptur. Si me persecuti sunt
and vos per sequentur. if they have doyen me ewyl. Certanly they may do you
ewyl. For the serwyteur is not and shoold not be mor than is master. Et as to
this beatytwd god gheuys oon great ghyft. Quoniam ipsorum est regnum celorum.
Certanly yt is oon Word of great consolacyo^ promised to them qwych sowstenys
pacyently the trybulacyons of this World for god promysys them the reawm of
hewyn. And this said opynly for to conclud fynaly. Beatieritis cum maledixerint
vobis homines et cetes. Gaudete et exultate quoniam merces vestra copiosa est
in celis. Bleshyd ar e my frendys says jesus christ to al faithful crystyn men
that lewys honnestly in this World kepand them from syn and hawand the dreyd of
god before thayr eynqwen the men that are Wykyt persecuturs of ryghttws men Would
curs and do to ow any iniurys and Wrong the qwych ye do beyr pacyently for the
boue of me. Reioy ow for ye shall have copyows reward in hewyn in ewyrlesta^d
joy. Et this suffycys of the viij. beatytwdys and godly promessys of god.

HEyr after We shall sey of the.iiij. conseylls ewa^gelikys of iesucrist The
first is that We shoold be meyk et live i^ parfyt meyknes so that if any
Wnfaythful ennemy of god shoold do Wrang or to stryk oony crystyn man in the
cheyk good conseyl is et co^mandyment of the gospel to have Will and cowrayge
grathyt to resaue oon other Wrang or persecucyon for to susteyn the faith et
les not the pays of his conscye^s by ire / or ewyl Will to rewenge him self.
The.ij. co^seyl is powyrty of spreyt. Et after this conseyl is Wryttyn / go et
sell all that thou has and gheue to the powyrs and fallow me. Certanly yt is
co^seyl et not propyr commandyment. The thryd conseyl ewangelyk is Wyergynyte
and parfyt chastyte / of the qwych yt is Wryttyn. Qwych have is yt may hold and
keyp yt. The.iiij. conseyl is parfyt dyleccyon and parfownd pacyens / for jesus
christ conselys et says i^ the hospel Pray for them that doys ow ewyl low owr
ennemys et sych thyngys semblabyls. Et this above said conseyl keyppys they
that are parfyt that are grathyd to thool iniwrys and to dyspys al rychess
te^porells for to fallow powyrte. Et to leyf chastely in parfyt charity and of
lowyng of god and of their nyghtbowr. Et i^ innocens of live and dysprysyng the
Worldly joy qwych shoold by dysprysyd for.v. thyngys. First that said Warldly
joy is cursyt of god / yt apperys i^ sant Luc in the.vj. cheptur. Ve vobis
diuitibus qui hic habetis consolationem. Cursyng shall fall above you rych men
and vorldly the qwyche has heyr your co^solacyons et pleysyr in Worldly joy.
Qwhat shoold he be qwych dwrst eyt of any meyt the qwych he Wnderstud War
cursyt of god almighty or of any sant of paradys. So much that the iustys of
this World is to dreyd et to show the qwych is cowrsyt. That is of jesus christ.
Mor shoold We low the Wepyngys that are blyshyd of owr redemptur as said is of
heyr before. Beati qui lugent. et cetes. Certanly We reyd / saint Bernard says
Weyl that Jesus christ Wepyd above the cite of iherusaelem and above lazarus /
bot We reyd not that he did lawgh no play. Segundly the Worldly joy and play of
this World shoold by dysprysyt for this that the said joy is myxyt With sorrow.
For qweyr the man dylytys him i^ drynkyng or ettyng or in lychery qwyche they
gadyr in greyt labowr et kepys them With greyt dreyd and lefys them With greyt
sorrow or dygnytys or offycys always the man shall find sum sorrow myxyt With the
said thyngys. Et they shall newyr have joy With the said thyngys / for they shall
have sum thing beyt seyknes or dysplaysans the qwych he Woold have no good and
qwayr they have defawt any thing they may not have yt. Et by this their is no
parfyt joy bot al sorrow et noysumnes. The thryd joy of this World suppos that
they be not cursyd of jesus christ and that yt War cleyn With out any myxyng of
sorrow so shoold they be dysprysyd. For they are short after the say of the holy
man Job in his.xx. cheptur. Gaudium ypocrite id est mu^di ad instar puncti. The
joy of this present World dyssawabyl is to the mayner of oon ypocryt and also
as the pownt qwych is of small shortness. The.iiij. cause the joy of this World
should by showed for this that yt pryuys of the ewyclestand gooddys of hewyn /
for as says saint Gregoyr. No man may have the sowlas of this World et be With
god ewyrlestandly i^ paradys. The.v. cause the joy of this World shoold be
showyt / for yt shall be towrnyd i^ oon other World i^ ewyrlestyng cursyng after
sa^t gregoyr that says. Presentia gaudia sequuntur perpetua lame^ta. Ve pyngys
and lame^tacyons ewyrlestand shall follow to the joys present of this World.

ANd We shall sey heyr after of the noryshi^g of the saowl spyrytwelly so much
as yt is in this Word present. That is to say of the vord of god of the qwych
is Wryttyn. That man lewys not oo^ly of the breyd materyal bot With this of all the Word qwych procedys of the mowth of god. Et certanly the Word of god is
oon said the qwych is brought of the hewyn by owr sawyowr et redemptur jesus
christ. Et if yt had not beyn brought all the World War peryshyd in synnys. After
the Word of Esaye in the first cheptur. Nisi dominus exercituum reliquisset
nobis semen quasi sodoma fuissemus. if owr redemptur had not lewyt Ws said of
his holy Word We had beyn full of Wycys and peryshyd in their synnys as did do
them of sodom et gomorram. Et Werytably the Word of god shoold by hard
rewerently yet dewotly as yt procedys of the mowht of jesus christ. For yt is
Wryttyn in sant Luc in the.x. cheptur. Qui vos audit me audit. Et saint Mathow
says yt is not e that spekys qwen e preyche / bot yt is the geost of god my
father that spekys in you yt is vryttyn i^ the decret He shall not have les syn
qwych eyrys the Word of god neglyge^tly / no the preyst qwych be neglygens
lattys fall the body of jesus christ above the earth. Et saint Augustyn says
Benign audiendum est. et cetes Al this qwyche appartenys to the salut of
saowlys et pryncypaly the Word of god shoold be ressawyt and hard meykly / and
dewotly holdyng and keeping besyly not has the Word of him that preshys bot as
the Word of god co^soland. Segundly the Word of god shoold by keypyt et
holdyng in mind and often put before owr eyn thayr to that We shoold not forghet
yt. Et yt is not ghanant to do as sum the qwych ar lyk oon redyl that is holyt
the qwyche fyllys full of Water qwen yt is plongyt in the Water bot qwen they
draw yt forth of the Water their is no thing in yt sych pewpyl may not have the
blyshyng of god qwych says. Beatiqui audiunt verbum dei et custodiunt illud. Et
as to this purpos says the appoystyl Wryttyng to the Romans in the segund
cheptur. They qwych eyrys oonly the law are not ryghtws enens god / bot the
doars et they qwych fulfyllys yt by goodverkys shall be iustyfyed. Et yt is
ghana^t that they qwych eyrys the Word of god and doys yt not rynnys in.iij.
greyt perylls The first is they shall be grewously punyshyd. This apperys in
saint Ioon in the.xv. cheptur. Si non venissem. etces. if I War not cu^myt
says the rede^ptur et that I had not spokyn they shoold not have syn bot they
have not no excusacyon of their syn. For yt is Wryttyn i^ sant Luc i^ the.vj.
cheptur. The servant that Wnderstondys the Will of is master et doys yt shall
not be bettyng of syndry Waandys. The segund da^gyer is that he qwyche eyrys
not the Word of god is that he closys the port of hewyn i^ so much as yt is to
him possybyl. Thies apperys by the psalmyst qwych says. Hodie si vocem eius
audieritis. if e heyr to day the vord of god be e not i^ Will to indurs yowr
hartys. That is to say that e be not hard to resayf the Word of god so as did
owr first pare^s in the desert to the qwych he as sworn in his ire that for
that they Would not heyr him / they should not enter i^ his ewyrlestand rest that
is in the eerth of promyssyon et hewynly beatytwd. The thryd dangyer is that
they that Will not heyr the vord of god is that they shall criqwen they shall be i^
necessyte as to the eynd of their live god shall not heyr them. This prewys the
prophet qwen he says in the parson of god they shall clep me and they shall not
be hard.

Certanly this Word of god should be Wylfully hard for the maynay prowffyttys
qwych yt ghewys to them qwych With good Will eyrys the Word of god and for the
much goodys that the said Word doys in them qwych Wylfully eyrys them. For
first the said Word of god clengys man Ioha^nis.xv. Iam vos mundi estis. etces.
ear clen and purget With i^ Says jesus christ to is dyscyplys for the Word that I
have preshyd to ow. Et this cu^mys i^ two mayners for the Word of god is as oon
myrower in the qwyche man has Wnderstondyng of his synnys Et the understanding
of his synnys is the beginning of salut. Segu^dly the said Word of god ghewys
grace to qwych eyrye yt by the qwych he is clengyd. For yt is Wryttyn in the
prowerbys i^ the.xiij. cheptur good techyng ghewys grace to the saowl. The
segund good that doys the Word of god to the parson qwych eyrys yt With good
Will yt is that the said Word as sych oon Wertu that god is present With the^
qwych eyrys With good Will the Word of god Mathei.xviij. Vbi duo vel tres.
etces. Qwen two or three ar gaderyt in the nam of the said redemptur forto eyr
my Word I am in the myddys of them. This apperys of the two discyplys qwych
did go the day of hefter of iherusaelem to the castle of emaus the qwych did
speyk of Jesus christ. The.iij. good the qwych doys the Word of god to the
parson the qwyche eyrys the Word of god is that yt refreshys the saowl after
this that yt is Wryttyn i^ saint mathow in the.iiij cheptur. Non in solo pane
viuit homo. and cetera. The saowl lyuys of the vord qwych procedys of the mowth
of god as said is. Et saint Gregoyr says. Cibus me^tis est verbum dei. et
cetera. The Word of god is the fowd of the saowl. For as is that the body is
noryshyd of bodyly meyt / sychlyk the saowl is noryshyd of spytwel meyt that is
of the voord of god. Et Werytably as that he qwych may not eyt bodyly et fyndys
no gowst in the meyt et holdys no thing of yt qwych is taykyn / bot puttys al
out of him qwych is oon opyn toykyn of greyt seyknes and that he is neyr the
deeth. Et sychlyk yt is of him qwych vyl not heyr speyk of god and qwych fleys
the preshyngys. The.iiij good is the qwych doys the Word of god to the parson
is / that With good Will eyrys yt that yt shawys ewydently that the said parson
is dyscypyl of god and of his famyl / for yt is oon natwrel thing that oon
ychoon eyr With good Will the Word of the father / is mother / is brether / is
sister et of his land. Than if god almighty is owr father and the gloryowes
excellant qweyn of hewyn empres of hell the vyrgyn mary is owr mother et the
angels et the archangels et all the gloryows santtys of hewynowr brether and the
reawm of heuyn owr land and ve shoold With good vyl speyk of them et of the
mayner how We may cu^ With them. The v. et last good is that doys the vord of
god to him that eyrys yt With good Will is that yt delywerys them of deeth / et
reqwyrys to them ewyrlestand beatytwd. yt apperys Ioha^nis viij. Si quis
sermonem meum seruaueryt etces. He that kepys and holdys my Word shall not gowst
the ewyrlestand deeth. yt may be ashyd qweyr for ewyl parsons Will not heyr
Weryte no the Word of god. Answer. For three caves. The first for yt is lyk to
them that yt is hard and sharp Ioha^nis.vj. Durus est hic sermo et quis potest
eu^ audire. That is to say / the Word of god is sharp yt may not behard. The
segu^d rayson is for that the Word of god is contrary to their dedys et for
this cause they Will not beleyf. Et for that yt is Wryttyn in saint Ioon in the
thryd cheptur Qui male agit odit lucem. etces. He the qwyche doys ewyl Werkys
lowys not the light thayr to that is verkys by not reprywyt. The thryd rayson
is for that their hartys ar inclynyt to synet to other Warldly thyngys / et of
this spekys the ecclesyastyk in the.xxj. cheptur. Audiuit luxuriosus and
displicebit ei / et proijciet illud post dorsu^ suu^. That is to say the man
that is lycherows as begown to heyr the Word of god et yt dysplefys him and
shall do cast yt a syd from him. For yt is Wryttyn in the prowerbys. Non recipit
stull verba prude^cie etces. The powyr synnar qwyche is fowlych resayffys not
no vndersto^dis not the Wordys of prudens et of sapyens of god With out he say
yt that he thynkys and the qwych he has in his heart. Al sych pewpyl shoold
dreyd that. They var not taykyn so as oon rich Wordly man Was taykyng of the
qwych spekys james of vytry the qwych vold newyr heyr the Word of god also
soon that he saw that is curat or oon other Would preyche he did go forth of the
church and speyk With sych lyk as him. Et of this he vas maynay tymys reprewyd
of his curat that he inpeshyt him et other to heyr the vord of god he did not
reyk bot parseuerit always i^ syn and ewyl cowstymys as obstynat. The qwych
finabyl Was taykyn of oon grewous seyknes so mooch that he vaes conpellyt for
dreyd of deeth and damnacyon to shryue him / et not for charity et low that he
had to god no of his awn saowl. Et of this seyknees after oon sych confession
deyd the said vorldly rych. Et qwen his body Was brought in the church before the
crucyfyx and qwe^ the curat et other clerkys vold begin the offys of requie^
and sing neyr the body. The image of the crucyfyx did tayk is two armies of the
cors et stoppyt is eyrys With his fyngers before all the pewpyl that Was their of
/ the multitwd of peupyl that vas their Was mooch ameyrWeellyd et ashyd at the
curat qwat that vas to say or might be. Et the said curat a^sweryt.

Certanly e shall Wnderstand that the image of owr redemptur Will gheue Ws to
Wnderstond that the soowl of this Wnhappy man of the qwyche the body is heyr
present is in the hondys of the dewyl. For also that the powyr Wnpappy being
not long a go in this World stouppyt is eyrys qwen he did heyr preshe the Word
of god and did go forth of the church dysprysant the Word of god.

Of the qwych I have syndry tymys reprewyt him sych lyk god closys now his
eyrys thayr to that he Will not eyr the prayers / the qwych We do for the saowl
of him. Et for that I defend you all that ye pray not mor god for him. Et also
soon they cessyt of their oraysons for that ve shoold not pray for theem that are da^nyt. Quia i^ inferno nulla est rede^pcio. Et than they did tayk the body
herd yt in oon feyld not holowyd for he vaes not worthy thereto.

FOr that ve have seyn heir be for of the fowd spyrituel of the saowl that is
of the Word of god by the qwych syndry ar clepyt to the reawm of heuyn Thought
yt be so that few ar choysyn and predestynat their to. Et no man wnderstondys
by scyens if he by in the love of god or in the indygnacyon of god as to this
cause for toleyf Weyl and conseqwe^tly mor goodly die. Veshal sey heyr after.ix.
mayners of predestynacyon by the qwych man may Wndorstond if he by in the stayt
of damnacyon. Et of so mooch that vefyndi^ owr self most of thyr.ix. fyngys
so much shoold We have mor great hoyp in god that We shall be of the nombyr of
santys suppos that We be sinners. The first sing of predestynacyon is adversyte
in this World. That is to Wnderstond / beyr bodyly seyknees pacye^tly and the
powyrte of temporel thyngys. After the saaw of the appoystyl qwych says. ad
hebreos.xj. Flagellat aute^ omne^ filiu^ quem recipit. That is to say that he
gheuys trybulacyon of bodyly seyknes et powyrte of te^porel things and eerthly
to his chylder qwych he Will resayff i^ beatytwd. Et yt is Wrytyn i^ the
apocalypsys i^ the thryd cheptur I prive and chasty them qwych I love. Et for
that qwen their cu^mys to any man any adversyte in his parson or in his goodys
/ and that they beyr pacyently the said adversytes for by adwentur he has before
grewyt god by pride / or by gloto^ny / or by Wrechydnes or other deydly syn. Or
he as beyn Wnthankful to god qwych as gheuyn him the said goodys. Et as to this
cause in punyshon god as punyshyt him of the said goodys. The segund sing of
predestynacyon is qwen any eyrys Wylfully the Word of god. That is that he eyr
With good Will the word of god and of his propyr salvation / et of the joy
ewyrlestand of peradys and of the pains of hell. For yt is Wryttyn i^ sant Ioon
in the.viij. cheptur. Qui ex deo est verba dei audit. He qwych is the soon of
god eyrys With good Will the Word of god. Of the qwych We have spokyn Will at
lenght heyr before as in them sing of leccyon et of the contrary they that vyl
not eyr yt is sing of ewyrlestand damnacyon. The thryd sing of predestynacyon
is that qwen any man honowrys them that dredys god as the good serua^s of god
almighty makar For yt is that oon falls penny often passys in the cownt With good
pennyes. Sych lyk / yt happynys that oon sinner qwych lowys the good that they
enter in hewyn With theem / by this that god gheuys them grace of co^trycyon by
the prayrees of the^ that are good. For if god Would forgheuyng have the
sodomtyes qwych vaes i^.v. cytes of sodoimy cye^s and to all the earth leyng
their to for.x. good parsons if they had beyn fownd With in the said cyttys.
For qwy shall not god forgheue to oon sinner doyeng to him meyrcy for the low
of syndry et maynay just persons the qwych ar good and to qwoom he doys faueur
to the said lowyt frendys ghewant the^ before that they depart forth of this
World Werray contrycyon and forghewenes of their synnys. Et certanly oon man as
natwrel Wertws qwych lowys the Wertws that are i^ oon other. Et of contrary it
is oon sing of reprobacyon qwen oon man enwyes the good and Wertwes et is so
mooche cursyd in him self qwych lowys not the good in him self ne may not sey
yt in others. Bot doys Wrong to the good pewpyl in word and deydto the exempyl
of falls the dewyss the qwych is obstynyt in his malys and ewer parsewys the
good and wertws. Et is oon greyt et grewons syn / for jesus christ reputis yt
doyn to him self qwych is doing to his freyndyes that this to good and just
parsons. The.iiij. sing of salvation is meyknes to of contrary pride is sing of
predestynacyon as the qywych says sant gregoryr. Et sa^t augustyn sais. Quem
superbium videris filium esse diaboli non dubites. Mayk no dowt bot he is son
of the dewyl the qwych thou seys prydful. Et certa^ly is the knyghtys and me^
of weyr ar knowyn by their armies et lyurys et sheyldys et that We Wnderstond
eythly by their said armis and lyurys and sheeldys under qwath king they feyght
sych lyk We know the knyghtys of jesus christ by humylyte et the serua^s of the
dewyl by pride For indowtably the qwych is most prydful in this woorld shall by
neyrest lucyfer in hell. Et he qwych is most meyk in this World he shall be
neyrest jesus christ in oon other World that is i^ hewyn. The.v. sing of
predestynacyon is qwen any eyrys not vyth good vyl speyk ewyl of his nyghtbowr
or brother crystyen. Et qwych exposys and conwertys in good all the said sawys
et dedys of his nyghtbowr / et of contrary yt is sing of reprobacyon qwen any
eyrys Wylfully detracturs qwych interpretys et exposys in ewyl party all that
they eyr et sey in the sawys et dedys of other et of their nyghtbowr. Sant
Thomas says if any heyrys Wylfwlly detraccyons With out that he resyst to the
detractur / or that the detractor pleys him by hatrent to him of the qwych ewyl
is spokyn he synnys not les than the detraccyo^ sumtym mor. For that says Saint
Bernard I can not say eythly qwych of the two is mor damnabyl detractur or to
say ewyl of his nyghtbowr or to eyr him that spekys ewyl. Always if he qwych
eyrys the detractur taykys no pleysyr to eyr the detraccyon and for sum dreydor
good causys reprewys et repellys not the detractur et to mayk opyn and shaw to
the detractur that the detraccyon desplesys him he synnys verayly bot of so
mooch les than the detractur / et oftymys venyaly. Et Werytably sum synnys
grewously saying that the deydys and operacyons of others that is their
nyghtbowr ar done by ewyl intencyon. For is oon is holdyn after their conscyens
to expos the tyngyes do^tabyls in the most goodlyest maynayr. For if any saw
two parsons speyk oon With oon other / et that Would judge dyfynytly that they do
speyk of su^ ewyl or that they lawgh by su^ fleshly lust that they have oon to
oon other. Certanly they syn deydly. For by awe^tur they speyk of sum thyngys
or they lawgh oon of oon other With out ewyl intencyon. For that says owr
redemptur in Sant luc in the.vj. cheptur. Nolite iudicare et non iudicabimini.
Judge not other and thou shall not by iugyd of ewyrlestand judgment. Ee the
appoystyl says. Quo iudicio alium iudicus te ipsum condamnas. Tow condamnys
they self by sych lyk judgment by the qwych thou iugys other. Et is to
Wnderstond this qwych is said holyly. For if any say any ewyl or syn opynly as
to kyl oon man With out iustyes blasphemyng god opynly. Bot of les deydys qwych
may be done by good or ewyl inte^cyo^ yt is syn to mayk any judgment as yt is
said.

The.vj. sing of predestynacyon is qwen any is meyrcyful to powyr quych ar i^
trybulacyon et seyknes. For as says Sant Gregoyr We may not otherwys be
maydme^brys of god and of owr rede^ptur jesus christ With out that We have pytye
of owr nyghtbowr that is in trybulacyon of so mooch their is mor great sing of
predestynacyon. For that says sa^t gregoyr i^ is moralys. Tanto quis
parfeccior est quanto perfectius alienos dolores sentit. So mooch as oon man
mor is parfyt in goodlynes qwyche parfytlyar Wnderstondys the dowleurs and
seyknes of others. Sych oon man acqwyrys meryt With al they With the qwych he
has pytye in charity of bretherheyd Et the Werray toykyn of pity is qwen he
holpys them With bodyly goodys or spirytwells qwych ar in trybulacyon. For yt
is i^ Wryttyn i^ saint ioon in the first canonyc i^ the.iij. cheptur. He qwych
as of goodys of this World et seys his nyghtbowr and crestyn brothyr have
necessyte / shettys the Wowellys of pyty that is to say he that holpys not of
his goodys bodyly or spyritwelly to his said brother / qwych is in necessyte.
How may he say that the charte of god bydys With him. Certanly sych oon person
has no low to god / no to his nyghtbowr. Et sant ioon / says in oon poystyl
god Would that ewyrych oon cristyn man should Wndersto^d et / parsayf in his heart
/ the trybulacyon et sorowys of others as owr awn / et We shoold holp them
qwych ar in tryhulacyo^. So as ve Would that We War holpyt and We var i^ sych
lyk adwersyte. Et of the contrary / he qwych as the art not pytyabyl is sing of
ewyrlestand reprobacyon / by that he has no pyty of powyr pewpyl For sant
gregoyr says that he qwych may not obteyn and dyserue the meyrcy of god qwych
haes not beyn meyrcyful in this World. Maynay dysprysys to speyk to powyr
peupyl of this World. Et consyderys not / if that yt had pleysyt to god / they
had beyn mor powyr than they that are dysprysyt. For their is no man so fair /
so rych / no so hoyl no he may be maid mor pouryr or mesel blind dum or
paralytyk. The.vij. sing of predestynacion is qwen any forgheuys eythly the
iniurys that are done to them. For their is no Wertu qwych may sonner reconsel
man With god / than to forgheue them that as blasphemyt et howrt and as doyn
Wrang to us. Et for this cause it is Written i^ Sant mathow i^ the vj. cheptur
yff e forgheue of al our heart to your prochaynes sych lyk your father of hewyn
shall for gheue you your synnys For Sant Gregoyr says. He shoold hold him self
oon sinner that as Will to do ewyl to his nyghtbour and Will not forgheue him
qwych as mysdoyeng. The.viij. sing of predestynacyon is qwen any desyrys to be
better oon tha^ other and better than he his. Et thayr is maynay great desyrs
that are good i^wart / by the qwych they desyr to be good et Were Ws and govern
them honestly in Wordys and maynayrs. Et certanly the gloys says above this
passayge i^ Sant mathow. Beati qui esuriunt et siciunt iusticiam. Qwych as
hongyr ec thryst of iustys is no other thing than to have desyr to profyt.
Verytabyl their is no other Way / the qwych is ghana^t that oon man shoold
proffyt or that he dyffaylls. Et so soon that man proffytys not he fayllys. Et
Werytabyl qwen oon man is hot et than is cold to do Weyl et that he cowstumys
to sleep i^ the matyn et to blaphem god et Wse the tawernys daily in playng of
the cach or of the dys Et as to the tyngys spyrytwells ad the church / the
study the prechyngyes i^ hatrent / and that he haf no desyr to exceres him to
do Weyl that is oon sing of eWyrlestand da^nacyon. For the payp leon says i^
oon sermon. That the rewm of hewyn shall not cum to them qwych slepye i^ their
synnys. Et that ewyrlesta^d beatytwd is not promised to them that are in sleep
by sweyrnes. For yt is of necessyte to exers in good Werkys / and have desyr to
do Weyl. The.ix. sing of predestinacyon ewyrlestand is qwen any thynkys of the
passion of jesus christ the qwych is pyteabyl et dolorows et thynkand of the said
dolorows passion and of jesus crist et that We thank him of this that yt
pleassyt him so mooch to meyk him that he has suffryd deeth and passion i^ the
cors for the rede^pcyon of mankind.

Et certanly We shoold have hop that he shall not be damnyt qwych thynkys often of
the said passion and that he remembyr yt With good Weyl. For thayr is no thing
mor aggreabyl to god no mor proffytabyl to man than to have mind of the passion
of jesus christ. The greyt Albert says in oon sermon that oon sympyl thynkyn or
recordacyon or remembrans of the passion of jesus christ as qwen he consyderys
the pyller qweyr the rede^ptur Was smyttyng or of the tree of the cors qwayr on
he vas crucyfyed so mooch oonly / or any myster of the said passion proffytys
mor to oon man than to fast oon ear holyly in breed and Water or that he did
hayt him self by ewyrych oon day With rodys unto the effusyon of blood. Or if
that he do reyd by ewyrych day oon hol sawltyer / as to this cause We shoold
dewotly thynk et doyeng this he acqwyrys the joy of paradyes the qwych gheue Ws
god be is grace.

qwom shall I call qwom shall Iashe at thies howr / I have no holp no confort / no

O saowl tayk heyr hey^ have pety of thy skyn I pray the that thou be not of

O my saowl by not to amend the ageyns the peril of damnacyon Wnto that thou be

For by sych ewyl Wycys I may newyr be reconsylyt With god. Et for that yt is

TO think alwayees of the deeth yt is not proffitabyl as says the poet cathon

of the ethykys spekand of thyngyes terribiles and dreidabiles qwych may hapnyng
in this World and and cu^ to man is the deeth. Mors resecat mors omne necat
quod in orb creatur. For the deeth is abolacyon of al gooddys qweyr he says in
the book of dysprysyng of this World as he as said before. For the deeth cuttis
kyllys / small ong / ald powyrs rich / kings / dukyes erlyes prensys / barons

so stark that he var that might ower cum him. Also deyd but yrn or any armies
owerco^ him et put him so law that all the might that he had might not preserve

terrybyls qwych ar in the World the deeth is the most. Quheyr yt is mooch to
dowt. Et yt is much merweyllows if the sayges pewpyl comtemplatywys dowtys yt.
For yt is Weyl Wnknowyng of the qwych oon freynd may not cu^ or send nowellys

qwych may be introducyt of deeth. They go sowddanly to the remeyd for to have
medcyns for to alenght their live. For so mooch that they Wndersto^d veyl that
the deeth is the most dreydabyl thing et most abhominabil qwych may cum. Et as
to this says the phylosophour spekand of the deeth naturel the qwych is
separacyon of body and of the saowl Bot ower this bodyly deeth qwych is so
crowel et dreydaybyl says the docturs co^templatywys of owr faith that their is
oon other deeth namyt the deeth of the saowl. Qwych With out comparaison is the
most dreydaybyl et most abhomynabyl tha^ the bodyly deeth. This qwych approwys
the holy doctur Sant Augustyn sayant. Maius est dampnum i^ amissione vnius
anime quam mill corporum. Says Sant augustyn mor great is the dommayge of oon
saowl qwych is lost et deyd be damnacyon than is the deeth of oon thousand
bodies of bodily deeth by abolycyon. This says also Sant bernard. Totus iste
mundu^ ob vnius anime precium estimari non potest. That is to say that al this
World full of riches qwat ewyr yt be is not Worthy to be estymyt to the prys of
oon saowl creat to the semblans of god. Et Wyllyng to say that oon creat to the
ymayge of god is mor nobyl et mor Worthy tha^ all the World by the qwych deeth

Bot says the actur by comtemplatyue merwellyng co^syderant the preparacyon

cha^seler of paris. Sepe per talem falsam co^solacionem et fictam sanitatis

medcyns gheuys in seyknes by oon fowlych trust the qwych they beleyff to

FOr to have cognoyssa^s ewydently if any pacye^t that is i^ the bed of deeth
may die Weyl and also for to teache Weyl. First We shoold monys him to trow
generaly al this that oon good crastyn man should trow / et to have Will to leyff
et die in the faith of god et in the Wnyte and obedye^es of holy church Segu^dly
We shoold monys him that he has grievously grewyt god for that the most just of
the World.vij. tymys the day grewys god and shaw to him how he shoold have i^
his heart dysplaysans of so mooch that he has offencyt god. Thrydly ve shoold
monys him to have good purpos and good Will to retowrne to penna^s and to amend

admonycyon is that We shoold monys them to be leyf that owr redemptur jesus
christ is Werray son of god et manet boorn of the vergyn mary. Et has suffert

mooch that Would meyk him to have suffryt deeth for to gheue him his salvation.
After this that they have monyst thy seyk man dewly of the thyngis above said

them first that he have in him verray contrycyon of heart of yt that he has
offencyt god. Segundly that he mayk oon hoyl confession With Will to do pennans
if he cu^mys to health or to tayk the deeth i^ thank if yt plesys god to send yt

Heyr the doctor makys solucy on of oon questyon that may be maid. That is to
Wnderstond if any seyk man the qwych is i^ the artikyl of the deeth qwych has
no company or assystens With him in his deeth to monys him or qwen he is in the
bed of the deeth that inqwyrys him of thyngys above said qwath shall he do.
Answerys the doctor that he that fyndys him in sych oon cas / he shoold inquyr
hi^ self and thynk so nooch as he may the thyngys above said. Consyderant if he
be so disposyt as qwych is requyryd in his co^scye^s that e / he shoold not

remember ewyr i^ his heart the holy and Worcester thy passyo^. For be this thought ar
owercu^myt all the temptacy ons of the dewyll pryncypally in the faith.

Vnde notandum est
HEyr says the actur that We shoold notyfy that they qwych ar in the artykyl of
deeth hanyes mor great et mor merweyllows temptacyons than they had beforn. Et
this is for that the Wnderstondyng and all the spretyes ar Wakyt as said is. Et
their is.v. pryncypal temptacyons qweyr of the dewyll te^pys man in the artykyl
of deeth as yt shall appeyr heyr after. Ageyns the qwych temptacyons the angel
of god always is besyd Ws for to keyp Ws and to conuoy Ws oon good Way if We
Will beleyf him he ghenys Ws.v. good inspyracyons.

HEyr says the actur of the mayner of procedyng in his book sayand. Bot their
to that thyes matter be fructws and proffytabyl to Ws / and that noon be
concludyt of the speculatyon bot to leyrn al the^ of qwath stayt that ewyr they
be to die Weyl I have trayt tyt this book in two fachons the oon to correspond
to the other. First in preshyngys auctoryset et parobosys for to serve to
clerkys. Segundly infigurs and ymayges before the eyn of them qwych be holdys
the letters is denotyd. Et I have maid for to serve to loud men. The two qwych
thyngys is lyk oon myrower in the qwych al thing by pass yt present and for to
cu^ ar be holdyn. Qwo Would than veyl die he shoold the thyngys before said With
them that followys et put them in their mind.

Te first temptacyon the qwych the dewyl tempys the man in the artykyl of the
deeth is.
Infirmus factus e^ Inte^ficias teipsu^ Fac sicut pagani.

After this qwych said is that the first thing of the qwych the seyk man should
be adwertyt in the artykyl of the deeth is the faith. Sych lyk the first
temptacyon of the qwych the dewyl gheuys is twechant the faith. For he
Wnderstondys weyl by is cautel he may oon tym do inso mooch that the pacyent is
indowt / of his deeth or otherwys he beleyffys not in the faith of god and holy
church that he is dam nyt. For yt is impossybyl to pleys god With out faith /
et for so mooch that With out faith We may not have salut in Wytnyssyng of holy
augustyng qwych says. Fides est bonorum omnium fundamentu^ et humane salutis
initium.

Faith is the fondement of al goodys and the beginning of salut to man kind.
Sant bernard also says.. Fidees est humane salutis initium. Sine hac nemo ad
filiorum dei numerum potest pertinere. Sine hac labor hominis est vacuus.

Says the gloryows sant Bernard / also says to this purpos. That faith is the
beginning of salut of ma^kynd. Et With out yt may no man cum to the nombyr of
the soonnys of god So yt yes With out yt the labe^ qwych man doys is Wayn et
may not proffyt to him / by the qwych if faith is the beginning of the salut of
man kind yt is Weyl that the ennemy at al howr being as oon lion romyshant and
sekant is proy for to Weary yt qwych desyrys not bot for to bring mankind to
perdycyon. Above al thyngys puttys is might to mayk man to fail in the faith.
For he Wayt Weyl if he may dassayff him by faith qwych is beginning of salut he
may noes cum to blysh of beatytwd. ffor so mooch of al is might he efforcys him
that Wekyt ennemy to cause the seyk man to renons his faith sayant to the seyk
man. O mesha^t and Wnhapy man that thou art beleyffes thou yt is faithful that
they presh to the and that thou qwych is man full of fyn is Worthy to have
paradys for oon oonly syn haes beyn da^nyt. Hell aes beyn maid for all synnars al
and syndry and qwat penna^s that ewyr thou do newirmor thou may efhayp Consider
all the pannans of Judas that he him self did hyng him and always he is da^nyt.
Ower be hold the kyngys payans qwyche so dewotyly seruyt to their ydoles et Were
ray godys qwych seys al before them and thou adorys and beleyffys that at thou
seys not et adoryes oon thing Wnknowyn qwych is oon great fowlyshnes With this
of thy beleyff thou has no experym^t. for their yes no^ of the^ that is passyt
the qwych is cu^ to say Weryte et thou shoold beleyf the contrary of all the
qwych they preshe to the better than otherwys. By sych perswasyons and fowlych
admonycy ons the dewyl te^pys et essays to temp et dyssayf him qwych is in the
passyones of deeth thar to that he cause him to go out of the Way of Weryte and
to cause him to er in the faith qwych is the beginning et fondacyo^ of al salut.
For the ennemy wayt Weyl if the fondement fail of any edyffys that is to say
any beggyn is cast down qwyche necessaryly the edyffys that is above the
fondement yff the fondement fayllys al fallys. Sciendum tamenet cetes. Heyr
puttys the actor oon notabyl for to gheue consolacyon to sympyl men not
lectoryt qwych may ower much dyspoyr of their Wertu and might to resyst to the
temptacyons of the ennemy and says so. That thought the ennemy may be malycyows
and dyssawabyl and that is temptacyons may be great. Always yt may also that
the dewil may not constraynge man in any temptacyon no ower cum i^ any manner in
so far that men as the vsayge of rayson. Et if he Will fully and With out any
strenyn he consent not to the temptacyons qwych cu^mys to him the qwych thing
above al is to dreyd. Et for this shoold the good christian man in is good mind
know god and protest be for him that qwath thing that ewyr the dewyl mayk him
to do by Wayknes of his Wit in the sorrow of the deeth he consent not no Would
consent bot callys before god protestant to live and die in the faith of the
appoystyls is oon good crystyn man. And also says the docturs contemplatyfs of
the holy Wryt that they find not that god permyttys not oon man in the
Wexacyo^s of the deeth that man shoold not be owercumyt of the e^nemy qwych i^
his good Wit makys this protestacyo^ sayant sant pol Fidelis deus qui non
pacietur vos temptari super id quod vos potestis sed facient cu^ te^ptacione
proue^tu^ vt possit sustinere. God qwych is good and faithful shall not suffyr
that e be tempyt ower yt that e have might of resystyng. Bot mor soon shall
gheue ow holp and confort thar to that he qwych is tempyt may goodlyar ower cum
the temptacyon. Queheyr for yt aperies i^ the artikyl of the deeth that qwe^ al
might fayllyes to man god holpys him et parmyttys not so much to be infestyt of
the e^nemy as qwe^ he is i^ his god mind and that before as a crystyn man as
dewly paid is det to god. Et for this is that ageyns the.v. temptacyons of the
dewyl in the artykyl of the deeth god gheuys to man.v. good inspyracyons send
by is angels for to resyst.

The good inspyracyon qwych gheuys the angel to the pacyent in the artykyl of
the deeth ageyns the temptacyon of the dewyl as to the faith.
Be sekyr in the faith. we lawbour i^ Wayn We are owercu^yt Latws fley.

OWR salwyour and redemptwr Jesus christ pyteabyl of ma^kynd not Willing that he
go to perdycyon. the howr that the power crystyn man is in torment of deeth and
that the dewyl of al is might drawys to dyssaue him by fawt of faith god sendys
him is angels for to gheue him admonycyons contrarys to them of the dewyl. Et
also is the fawls ennemys by falls perswasyons. Also the angels by good
admonycyons tystys him and says. O man qwych is formit of the earth and yt is
fors that thou retowrn in the earth haf co^gnoyssa^s of thy makar qwych has maid
thy saowl to his propyr lyknes keyp the Weyl that thou beleyff not to the
pestylens and mortel suggestyo^s of the dewyll for that he is bot oon lear and
qwat lesyngys he gheuys the to Wnderstond or any appera^s is of veryte always
the eynd of al deyd is bot dyssauyng and thynk thou how he dyssauyt adam et eve
and causyt them to syn by his lesyngyes qwen by his false ghewyn to Wnderstond
he causyt them to eyt of the fruit that Was prohybyt promytta^t them and saya^d
that be that they may be immortel and for that says the angel to the pacyent.
My freynd keyp the Weyl that in any may nar thou dowt not of the faith thought
yt be that thy Wndesto^dyng be Wayk and may not comprehend yt that is so great
oon thing of the faith of god With this that is mor proffytabyl to Wnderstond
yt not sensualy For if thou Wnderstoud yt et may Weyl comprehend yt shoold yt
not be meritabyl thyes qwych says sant gregoyr. Fides non habet meritum vbi
ratio prebet experimentum. Faith is of no meryt their qweyr the thing may be
prywyt by rayson or by experyens reme^byr the of thyes qwych has Wryttyn owr
holy fathers first says sant Pol in his.xj. cheptur to the hebreuxs Sine fide
i^possibile est placere deo. With out faith yt is not possybyl to pleys god
Wyllyng to infer that the thing qwych most pleysys to god that is faith. Sant
ioon says also in his thryd cheptur. Qui non credit ia^ iudicatus est. He qwych
beleyffys not in the faith sewrly he is iugyd. Sant bernard also says. Fides
est primogenita intervirtutees. Faith ettwyes the Wertus qwych causys the man
to his salvation is the first engendryth. Says ower that sant bernard. Beatior
fuit maria parcipiendo fidem cristi quam carne^ xpi Mor happy Waes the gloryows
Wyergyn mary for the Werray faith that sho had i^ god in beleyff and faith
fully to the Woordys of the holy angel how Weyl that yt Was oon merweyllows
thing in nature than yt Was of consawyng of the flech of jesus christ. For that
says the angel to the pacyent. Faith is the most precyows thing that may be
had. Consider the faith of owr ancyen fathers as abraham / ysaac / jacob.
Consydyr the faith of sum pyans as of jacob of raab the fowlysh Woman et of
syndry qwych so greyt faith as had in god how Weyl that they War of the ald
testament and had not no new law bot the holy Wryt preshyt them they War sawyt
for the greyt faith that they had i^ god the father and makar. Consydyr the
great faith of the appoystils that al their possessions / riches / fathers /
mothers / Wyffyes chyldryn and the self Ways their propir Will aes leyfyt for
the faith of jesus christ beleyff and faithfully and With out faith and doyeng as
before said is they might not entyr in the reawm of paradys. The faith also of
the Wyctoryows champyons of the faith that is to say the gloryows martyrs qwych
is Werray knythtys et as offert their bodies to innumerabyl torme^s for to
susteyn the faith of god Wyllyng to die inyt as Werray knyghtys in the faith and
law of there pryns. The faith also of the gloryows confessures and Wyergyns
qwych for the nam of god as lywyt in dreydabyl penna^s renonsa^t the World kep
and their Wyergynyte and lyw and strayt live for to pleas god hauand Werray
faith in them. Tak exampyl first at sant petyr that of his bodyly fut he eyd

venyn that Was brought to him and he had newyrewyl by so mooch he beleyffyt
faithfully that in makand the tokyn of the cors above the bryuayge the holy
gheost did tayk the Wenyn away. Thou as mor great exampyl says the angel to the
seyk man to beleyf that god shall holp the if thou trustis as yt is Wryttyn of
alexander et syndry other paganes and by the qwych yt is Weyl notyd if god for

freynd says the angel to the seyk man thou shoold weyl and manly and of great
fors resyst to the dewyl qwych tempys the to er in the faith. Et shurly beleyf

Nota quam cito.
Heyr puttys the actor of this present myrower oon notabyl sayant. Also soon

Fornicatus es. Periurus es. Auare vixisti. Ecce pcta^ tua. Occidisti.

The segund te^ptacyon the qwych the dewyl tempys the man in the artykyl of the
deeth is by myshop.
THe segund temptacyon after owr present Actor of The qwych the dewyl tempys
man or Woman and essays to dyssayf the seyk man in the artykyl of the deeth is
of dysperacyon ageyns the the great hop and trust that al crystyn man shoold
have in the meyrcy of god. Et he doys this te^ptacyon in two mayners. First by
the showing of his synnys doyn by the seyk man. Sygu^dly be Wayn Wordys le dyng
him to myshop. First than seeing the dewyl the powyr crystyn man torme^tyt With
afflyctyons of the dowleurs of deeth Wyllyng to gheue dowleur above doleur
deypnes With deypnes. Taykys oon great book in his hond qwar his Wryttyn all the
ewyl deydyes that the powyr sinner as doing in this World and specially of them
that he has not beyn shrynyng qwych ar so dysplaysant to the crystyn man of
good faith that any thing mor may not be. Et says to him. Thou meshant Wnhappy
qwych has had faith in god the qwych has doyn to the so maynay syndry goodys
and thou as grewyt him gretumly how beleyffys thou that he have meyrcy of the
qwen selflyk the si^nys that thou as doyn agei^s him thou as left the
Wnshrynyng and would not have knowynt them. Be hold I have put them al i^ Wryt
and I have hop thou shall newyr be to no man bot to me or other Ways god is not
faithful judge. Thou as beyn is by grace thou art mine by syn. Thou shoold be
naturelly by to him / bot by Wrech^d Will thou as lost thy part and right of the
heritage and thou art mine is prysonner ewyrlestand acqwyryd With greyt Weyr god
haes boght the by the meryt of his passion and I have stollyn the theftwsly
acquyryd by temptacyon. Thou aes beyn the soon of god be obedya^s if thou had
kepyt is commandymens Bot thou ar soon of the dewyl by consentyment in so
mooche that thou has trespassyt them Thou as left the habyt of immortalyte the
qwyche god by his gracys has ghewyn the. Et has taykyn the habyt of damnacyon
and of al pain by the enorm synnys qweyr of thou art clothyd / as yt apperys in
this present book qweyr ar al thy synnys. Et specially of them that thou maid
newer pe^nans as yt is Wryttyn et redygyt to mind qweyr for thou may say as did
Cayn qwyche kyllyd is propyr brother Abel. Mayor est mea inquitas quam vt
veniam merear. Mor greyt is mine inyquite than all the gracys that I can meryt
enens god After this shawyn the dewyl says the to seyk man at is neyr the
deeth. Be hold as thou as offencyt god. First in so mooch that above al thyngys
thou has not lowyt him thou has swoorn his nam in vayn / thou has not kepyt thy
holy days / Thou as not honowrit father (...) other bot do ageyns their
co^mandyment. Thou as beyn oon murdryer at the lest of thy Will if thou as not
beyn yt of deyd. For thou as be awarys or Wodnes desyryt often tymys Wengens and
the deeth of others / et Wylfully as purchassyt his deeth had not beyn the
dreyd of the World mor than of god. Thou as acqwyryt the goodys of other men be
theft by fors by Wylys by dyssawyng and be oon thousand other mayners qweyr of
thou maid nener restytucyo^. Thou as brokyn thy marriage of thy nyghtbowr thou
as fowlest his dowther and born fauls Wyttnessyng upon him and done oon
hondreth thousand synnys ageyns the co^mandymens of god With out that We keyp
them We may not besawyt as says jesus christ. Si vis ad vitam ingredi serua
mandata dei. yff thou Will have ewyrlestand live keyp the commandymens of god.
The qwyche says the dewyl to oon seyk man thou has not kepyt them. Bot thou has
beyn pride full / vrechydful / full of sweyrnes enwyows / dyspytows full of
glowtonny and lycherows. Qwyche ar the.vij. deydly synnys qwayr of thou ar full
and thou maid newyr confession this qwych apperys that yt is wayn et oon
fowlych thing to the to have hop that he be so m^rcyful to forgheue the. Seeing
that so often thou has hard presh that yff oon deyd in deydly syn they are damnyt.
Mor ower thou has not fulfilled the Werkys of meyrcy of the qwyche pryncypaly
god shall hold is judgment of the qwyche he shall low or blam them the qwyche
shall assyt before him as he puttys in the bookys maid of the judgment shall be at
his Wrong hond. That is to Wnderstond To the ewyl by oon mayner of reprewyng.
Ite in ignem eternum. Nam esuriui et non dedisti michi manducare. Sitiui et non
dedisti michi bibere. and ces Says god to the ewyl the day of judgment. Go e
ewyl pewpyl forth of my company to the dewyl and al is angels and to the
ewyrlestand fire of hell. For that qwen e War in the World ye have dysprysyt me
I have had honger e gheue me no thing to eyt qwen I had thryst thou gheue no
drynk to me. Et for that says the dewyl to the pacyent. Thou qwych is lywa^t
and thou fowfyllyt newyr no may fowlfyl the Werkys of meyrcy and charity thou
may weyl say et judge that thou ar frustryt of the meyrcy of god. Et yt is to
the oon greyt fowlyshnes to espoyr seeing that With out meyrcy thou h^^ lewyt
and faint Iamye says. Iudicium sine misericordia f^^t illi qui sine
misericordict fuit s^^per terram. Judgment With out meyrcy shall be to him qwych
as not had meyrcy above the earth. Ower this thou seys syndry that laborys night
and day in the law of god and always i^ no mayner they dar not presum of the
meyrcy of god. For so mooch if any Wndersto^dys not if he by Worthy of the lowf
of god or the hatre^t. Et for that yt is oon great fowlyshnes to oon synnar
qwyche has so maynay synnys to have hop in the meyrcy of god the qwych may not
have. By fych the monysynges the dewyl tystyes pacyent to myshop / the qwyche
above al ewyl is to show. As yt be so that We have offencyt the meyrcy of god
We may be sawyt. Vytnessyng the prophet that says. Misericordie domini quia
non consumpti sumus. This says the prophet of the greyt meyrcy of god that we are not Wayftyt no adnychylyt seeing the greyt ewyllys that We are full. Ower this
says saint Augustyn techyng to fle myshop. Vnusquisque positus in peccato si
de venia vera desesperauerit misericordia^ funditus perdit. etces. Al parson
qwych is in syn if he dyspayr that god may not or Will gheue him gracys by that
he retowrn dewotyly and by contrycyon of heart to him. He lefys holyly the
meyrcy of god / for thayr is no thing that mor offenses god than myshop.

The segund inspyracyon that the angel ghewys to the seyk man ageyns myshop.
AGeyns the Segund temptacyon that the dewyl gheuys to the seyk man in the bed
of deeth for to tech him from myshop gheuys the angel of god heyr oon
inspyracyon and comfort that is good and hol sum sayand. O man qweyr for has
thou myshop of the meyrcy of god dowta^t that he Will not or may not ghewe the
grays vyth out that thou ash him meyrcy With heart contryt et dewoyt mind I put
the cas that thou as co^myttyd so maynay theftys and mourthres is their is
dropys of Watyr i^ the se or sand in the se. Self if thou oonly as co^myttyd
and done also maynay synnys is that ewyr vas or ar or shall be ageyns the goodness
of god I put the cas that thou var newyr shryuyn of them et had newyr doyn no
pe^nans. For in sych oon cas suffycys oon good co^trycyon of heart in wyttnes of
the psalmyst qwych says. Cor contritum et Nequaquam desperes victoria michi
nulla humiliatum deue no^ despicies. O god says the psalmyst I Wnderstond thy
goodness so greyt and so infynyt vyth this that thou dysprys newyr the heart
qwych by co^trycyon and meyknes shall retowrn to the. As this that the prophet
Ezechiel spekand in the parson of god says. Quacumque hora peccator ingemuerit
saluus erit. Et in qwat howr yt be that the synnar have contrycyon and
dyspleysans of his syn he shall be sawyt. Sant bernard also says Mayor est dei
pietas quam queuis iniquitas. Mor greyt is the pyty and meyrcy of god than any
inyqwyte that man may do in this World. Saint austyen sychlyk Wys says. Plus
potest deus misereri qua^ homo peccare. Mor says saint austyn mor may god for
gheue tha^ man may syn. By the qwych the angel says to the pacyent. My freynd
qwhat ewyl that ewyr thou has doyn thou has no cause to have dyspayr. In casu
etiam quo. et cetera. Heyr the angel strengthys is admonycyon for to keyp the
pacyent from dysparyng and says to him. My freynd have no dyspayr of the meyrcy
of god not et thou Wist that thou War of the no^byr of them that War damnyt
thou shoold not have dyspayr of the meyrcy of god / for that in hell thayr is no
redempcyon bot their to that he shoold gheue the les torment. For qwen god seys
the dyspayr of any damnyt yt dyspleysys him so mooch that be so mooch he eykys
infynytly his torme^s

Ower this owr redemptur and sawyowr jesus christ is not cu^myt in this World to
suffyr deeth and passion in oon cors for ryghtus men bot for to redeym synnars
as he him self gheuys Wytnessyng. No^ veni vocare iustos sed peccatores. God
say I am not cummyt to call the ryghtusmen bot to call the synnars.

damnabyl than al thy synnys thar for qwat ewyr syn that man as co^myttyd so
mooch enorm that ewyr yt be he shoold not have no dyspayr. For as says saint
Augustyn. Plus peccauit Judas desesperando qua^ iudei crucifige^do christum.
Mor synnyt Judas in him self dyspayrant than the iowys did that crucyfyed

necessayr is hop after Crysostomus qwych dyffynys yt and says Spes est salutis
nostre anchora / vite nostre fundamentum / dux itineris quo itur ad relum

Hop says Crysostom is the ankyr of owr salut the fondyment of owr live the
condyt of owr Way by the qwych We go to hewyn / and for that hop for qwat sum
ewyr syn yt shoold not be left.

The thryd temptacyon of the qwyche the dewyl tempys in the deeth is of awarys.
Prouideas amicis. Intend thesauro.

THrydly qwenthe e^nemy of hell feys that he may not do so mooch that the
pacyent in the artykyl of deeth may deny et renons the faith of god and of the
church et that he beleyf not faithfully et Wyldy as oon faithful crystyn man.
The qwych this the false dewyl may not owercu^ et cause him torn to dyspayr as yt
is said. He essays to dyssayf the pacyent by oon othyr mayner. Et that the
Wnder put is mind et thought of the thyngys that are salutayr for his saowl He
cu^mys to him et presentys before him et bryngys to his mind al his negocys and
occupacyons temporells that the pacyent as had in this World et specyaly them
that most he as lowyt and qweyr he as had most affeccyo^. There to that by
regret that the pacyent may hawe to leyff they thyngys temporels qweyr he as
had so mooch felycyte he may troubyl his Wnderstondyng and cause him leyff the
thynkyng of his saowl. Et this is Weyl to not that this temptacyon princypaly
cum is to them qwych as great riches / and possessions qwych as fair Wyffys / et
fair lygnayge and al Worldly gooddis in the qwyih them being in health as had
mor of pleysans and of occupacyon et solycytud tha^ in the seruys of god no to
the salut of their saowl. Et for that at howr of their deeth that al this
shoold be foret et left / the dewyl of hell cu^mys to them et puttys in their
mind et says to the pacyent. Ownhappy man that thou art at this howr thou may
Wnderstond that their is in the great Wnhappynes / qwe^ so sowda^ly thou most
leyf al and of so greyt Worldly go odys that thou has had in so mooch thou as
acqwyryd With great pain et at the hour that thou should have yt et leyf at thy
eyes thou leysys them. Thy Wife also thy fair chyldryn qwych thou as so mooch
lowyt thou leyffys them inprowydyt and they Wayt not qwat they shall do after
that thou art goon. Thy fair dwelling placys thy fair howsys thy fair byggyns
qwo shall hald them after the. Thy great myrchandys so mooch in these as in earth
qwo shall be their condyt thou leyffys al at the howr that thou shoold have joy
et honor et to do veyl heyr as thy vyff and thy ong chyldryn that thou leyffys
dysconfortyt Sych did do them honor that shall dowrong them thou dies owersown.
Et yt War to the oo^ great profyt if thou might live sum thing mor. Et i^ this
mayner et i^ sych parswasyons tempyes the dewyl to desayf man thayr to that he
have regret in the World et to leyf the thynkgyng of the saowl for to thynk to
the Wanytes. Vnde singulariter notandu^ est. and ces. Heyr the actor techyes
this that they shoold do about oon seyk man twechant this temptacyon of auarys.
Et says that yt is to not syngulary et to keyp pryncypaly that before oon seyk
man being i^ the bed of deeth qwayr their is sum te^poralytes that they speyk
of non of them. Et that they remenbyr him not his Wyff his chyldryn is fre^dys
With out yt be i^ so mooch that yt twechys his saowl for to make his testament
et die as oon good faithful crystyn man in the faith of god. For that yt is that
all the santys et Wys me^ feilland the passyo^es of deeth lay in oon bed of aws
as did holy sant martyn or on strew as sayant that else they have forghet the
rychees of the World et also the Wanytes and thynkys no mor bot of the salut of
the saowl.

The good i^spyracyo^ that the angel gheuys to the pacyent in the artykyl of
the deeth.
AGeynes this said te^ptacyon of auarys that the dewyl gheuys in the artykyl of
the deeth the a^gel of god of the other part gheuys oon good inspyracyon et
faithful medcyn for to resyst Weyl and says. Oman return thy eyrys of the
mortel et dangerows suggestyons of the dewyl that al haylily efforcys him to
turn thy cogytacyo^ that thou shoold have to the salvation of thy saoul Leyf
and put by hynd the thynkyng of the tpalytes. Et remenbyr thy self that thou
art bot aws and of as thou ar cu^yt et that thou shall retorn i^ aws. Non sis
auarus. No^ inte^das amicis Quid faciam. Ower reme^byr the that qwen thou co^
i^ this World thou had not et that thou Was boorn al makyt et so most thou
retorn Also With this for the salvation of the saowl yt is necessayr that
Weylfully thou renons al temporalytys / thus as says owr lord jesus christ to
the^ qwych adherys and taykys in felycyte and joy in the Worldly posessyons.
Nisi quis renunciauerit omnibus qui possidet non potest meus esse discipulus.
Et that yff oon man renons not first to al his possessions he may not by my
dyssypyl. Says owr that owr lord. Si quis venit ad me and non odit patrem et
matrem and vxorem fratres et sorores et anima^ suam no^ potest meus esse
discipulus. Says owr falwyowr if any cu^mys to me and has not for et as be
hatrent is father / is mother / his Wyff hyes chyldrin his brethyr et systerys
et self Ways his propyr saowl that is to say is propyr Will senswel he may not
by my dyssypyl. Et after this says owr lord. Et omnis qui relinquerit domum vel
fratres Well sororores aut patrem aut matrem aut vxore^ aut filios aut agros
proter nomen meum centuplu^ accipiet et vitam eternal possidebit. Et al man
that leyffys his hows is brether / his systres / or is father / or is mother /
is Wyff or is chyldryn or is feyldds for my nam says owr lord he shall resayf
oon hondreth tymys the dowbyl et shall posses the lyff ewyrlestand. Et thus
admonysys the angel the pacyent to tayk powyrte Wylfully et to hayt al World
lines. Et yt is that he techys them not that they hayt their father or mother
or is chyldeyr of ewyl hatrent procedent of wodnes of heart bot of oon hatrent
leyffand them. That is to say that We shoold leyf and for et them as oon thing
that ve hat. Says after the actwr. Memento etiam. et cetera. Heyr techys the
angel the pacyent by symylyiud et says to him. My freynd remenbyr the of the
vylful powerte that owr lard had in he cors for the that Wylfully leyffyt is
most belowyt mother et his dyssypuls that so mooch he lowyt. Consider also that
so maynay sayge men et holy men in this dysprysyng of te^poralytys as followyth
owr lord Wyllyng to heyr this fair Word. Venite benedicti patris mei possidete
regnu^ quod paratum est vobis ab inicio mundi. Cum my bleshyd frendys bleshyt
of my father et posses the reawm that is grathyt to you before the beginning of
the World. For that says the angel to the pacyent. My friend in prent this that
I have said to the in thy thought et put a Way al thing that are transytoyrs from
the as venym et towrn the holyly to vylful poverty. For so thou may posseyd the
rewm of paradys. Beati pauperes spiritu quoniam ipsoru^ est regnu^ celorum.
Blyshyt ar the powers of spyryt qwych has Wylfully powerte for the rewm of
heuyn is ghewyn to them. Et so says the a^gel. My friend put al thy vyl of al
thy thought to the vyl of god i^ good faith and hop qwych shall gheue the
cwyrleft and riches. Nota quando infirmus. et cetera. Heyr techa^t the actor of
this book the pacyent dreydant the deeth and says. Quhen the seyk Wnderstondys
him tempyt by Wrechydnes or louf of thyngys of the earth he shoold consider
first that thies love deptyes this qwych concludys to the love of god of the
qwych spekys sant gregoyr that says. Tanto quis a supers no amore disiungit
quant and her inferius in creaturis delectac^. Of so mooch mor if any heyr i^
this World in the creatures of this World as mor low / he is departyt of the
sowerayn love of god. Segu^dly he shoold consider how much vylful pouerte is
proffytabyl qwych bleshys et ledys the man in hewyn as says owr lord. Beati
paupr^^ spiritu. et cetera.

The.iiij. temptacyon that the dewyl tempys man in the artykyl of deeth is
impacye^s
Ecce quamtam penam patitur quam Been decept eam.

THe.iiij. mayner that the dewyl tempys the man in the artikyl of the deeth is
of i^pacyens that makys man to murmur ageyns god. Et says specyaly that at the
howr that he sufferys most great dolewrs sayand to him. O Wnhappy how may thou
suffer oon so much sorrow qwich yes Wnthoyllerabyl qwich thou as not dysseruyt
and yt is not always proffytabyl et With out profyt. So yt apperys Weyl that
god has left the qwe^ thou art in oon so great dowleur and afflyccyo^ he leyffys
the With out confort. Et qwych is mor greuabyl. For thayr is no man that as
pacyens of the no of the dowleur that thou sufferys qwych is ageyns al rayson.

Thou shoold have great dyspyt in thy heart qwen thy Wife thy chylder and hoyrys
ar they qwych in their thought desyrys et hastys thy deeth With al their will
pryncypally for to have al thy succession thought yt be that with their mowth
and their eyn they Weyp they shaw them sorrowful the qwych they are not And their
is non of this that lowys That they shaw to the qwych after the departing of
thy saowl would for all thy good dys that thou as left the^ keyp thy body deeth
oonly for the spayes of oon day qweyr of thou shoold by much sorrowful and
murmur in thy heart that they fail the that sych great sorrow haldys the With out
any confort. By sych mayner tempys the dewyl to dyssayf the pacyent by
impacyens qwych is ageyns charity by the qwych. We are holdyn to low god above
al thyngys. Et for the low of him pacyently suffyr and thool al aduersytes.

Nota quod moriturus.
HEyr puttys the actor of this book oon notabyl for to tech Ws for to dyspos Ws
to the deeth thar to that we by not dyssauyt by impacye^s and murmyryng ageyns
god. Sayant that by impacyens thayr cu^mys not so often to the^ qwych lyuys by
long tym and eyld qwych is a naturel deeth as to them qwych deys by accydental
deeth as of fywrys postumys pestylans or any other pestylens seyknes that is
da^gerows qwych oftyn tymys is taykyn and taykys by fors ar mor grewyt i^ their
seyknes Et by so much sum tymys by Wehemens of ewyl they go Wyd et cu^mynys
demonyaclyes impacyens et murmurans ageyns god qwych sum tymys yes not oon good
toykyn for thyes may happyn by fawlt of conscyens et by temptacyon of the dewyl
qweyr of says snayt iherom. Si quis cu^ dolor egritudinem vel mortem patitur
seu accepit signum est quod sufficie^tur deum non diligit. Says sa^t ierom if
any suffrys dowseur and impaciently in seyknes or resayffys deeth indisplaysans
et murmurys. That is toykyn that suffycyently he lowys not god. Et for that he
deys not in faithful charity. For as says sant pol. Caritas pacienes est /
benigna est. Charity is pacyent and benyng. Et by this monysys the actor of
this book to dyspos them to full heelth protestant that for qwath su^ ewyr
fantasy that We have by vehement seyknes that We resayf the deeth in thank et
pacyently for the low of god.

The inspyracyon and good monysyng that the good angels gheuys ageyns i^pacye^s.
Sum captiuatus o ho^ auerie ab i^ pacie^tia ai^m tuu^. Labores amisi.

OF contrary of this that the dewyl of hell perswadis and says to the pacye^t
for to cause him to fall in impacyens et to go from the lowf of god by fawlt of
charity. Et finaly for to cause him to leyf all the goodys that ewyr he may have
doyn. The angel gheuys hi^ oon techyn of the contrary et says to him. O man put
away thy cowrayge from impacyens by the qwych the dewyl With al is damnabyl and
deethful castygacyons et desyrys no other thing bot the tynsal of thy saowl.
For by impacyens et murmurs the saowl is lost so as yt is possessyt by pacyens.
Vytnes of sant gregoyr that says. Regnu^ celorum nullus murmurans accipit.
Newyr says sa^t gregoyr that he qwych murmurys ageyns god shall ne wyr cu^ to
the reawm of hewyn Et for that says the angel my freynd ennoy the not of the
noysu^nees of thy seyknes the qwych if thou co^sydrys yt Weyl thou shall find
small and light in the regard of thy synnys. Ower thyes seyknes that god has
se^d before thy deeth yt may be to the oon purgatoyr so that thou suffyr yt
pacyently. Et thou shoold thank god gretumly. For We shoold not oonly thank him
of the thi^gys that he gheuys Ws to owr co^solacyon / bot sych lyk of the
thyngys that he gheuys Ws to owr affection. For as that says sant gregoyr.
Miseri corditer deus temporale^ adhibet seueritate^ ne eternal inferat
vlcione^. God for his meyrcy send Ws afflyccyones temporels that for owr
demeritys he send Ws not and infer to Ws vengens Sant austyen says also. Dn^e
hic ure / hic seca / vt ineternum michi parcas. Byrn me in this Wolrd / heyr /
cleyf me / et kyl me at thy Will thar to that ewyrlesta^dly thou forgheue me /
and for so much trybulacyo^s i^ this World they are not to be refusyd. For as
says sa^t austyen. Mala qui noes hic pugniunt ad deum nostre compellunt. The
ewyllys et afflyctyons that punyshys Ws in this World they compel and stranges
Ws to towrn ayens to god. Ower this the angel says / the salut of the saowl is
not apprewyt at the passion of the Wylles of the flesh bot either ewyrlestand
damnacyon as the qwych says sant augustyn. Signum manifest damnacionis est
beneplacita assequi et a mundo diligi. The sing of opyn da^nacyon that is to
fulfill al is Will and to belowyt of the World mor says sant augustyn. Miru^ est
quod omnibus ineternum damnandis omnes lapides no^ surgunt in solacium. Sed
magis mirum est quod omnibus ineternum saluandis omnes lapides non surgu^t in
periculum. This says sant austyen I merweyl that all the stonys of the World
that they rys not agei^s them that shoold be damnyt ewyrlestandly for to gheue
the^ sowlas and joy. Bot yt yt is morgret merweyl that the said stonys rysys
not agei^s thoyes that ewyrlestandly shoold besawyt for to gheue them torment.
For that says the angel to the pacyent. My freynd put away from the impacyens
as Wenymows pestylens and tayk pacye^s qwych is oon sowyr bucler et a faithful
sheeld by the qwych thou may feght and owercu^ all the e^nemys of the saowl in
beholdant jesus christ and his holy santtys qwych as being pacyent Wnto the deyth.

Not at cum infirmus sent it. etc Heyr the actor gheuys oon techyng to the
pacyent tempyt of i^pacie^s saya^t that al Ways that the pacye^t felys hi^
te^pyt in this cas We shoold consydyr how much i^pacie^s yes noyabil qwych
inqwyetys manet turnys him from the low of god may not rest in him as yt is
Wryttyn. Super quem requiescit spiritues meus nisi super quietem and humile^
cord. Above the qwych says owr lord shall repos my spyryt / bot above the
pacyent paysybil and meyk of heart. Segundly consider that pacyens sowerantly
neydful as that / by syndry actorytes is prewyt. First by sant polsayant.
Paciencia vobis necessaria est. Owr lord also apprewys that says. Nonne
oportuit cristum pati / and ita intrare in gloria^. God the father ashybyhowyt
he not that jesus christ suffert pacyently the deeth and in this manayr entyr in
joy. Sa^t gregoyr says also. Nunquam seruari concordia nisi per pacientiam
valet. Concord and pays may newyr be kepyt With out pacyens. Segundly pacye^s
is proffytabyl for the conseruacyon of the saowl qweyr of says owr lord. In
paciencia vestra possidebitis animas vestras. Et in owr pacyens e shall posses
yowr soowllys. Sant gregoire says also. Maioris meri ti est aduersa tollerare
quam bonis operibus insudare. yt is oon thing of mor greyt meryt to suffer and
beyr pacyently in aduersytes than to trawayl thy body inswet doing other good
Werkys. Says ower that sant gregoyr. Sine ferro martires esse possumus / si
patienciam in animo veraciter seruamus. Vyth out yrn We may be martyrs et also
With out bodyly torme^s owtwart / says sant gregoyr We may be martyrs if
faithfully We keyp pacyens in owr hartys. Solomon says. Melior est paciens viro
forti et qui dominabitur animo suo expugnatore vrbium. Mor good liar yt yes to
oon pacye^t man tha^ to a man of bodyly fors. Et he qwych as might to owercum
above his cowrage that he be not full of ire mor tha^ he qwich is oon expugnator
of cytes.

The.v. te^ptacyon that the dewyl ghewys to the pacyent in the artykyl of the
deeth yes of wayngloyr
Tu es firmus i^ fide. Gloriare. Corona^ meruisti In paciencia perseuerasti.
Exalta teipsum.

QWen the dewyl seys that he ca^ not cause the man to reno^s the faith or to
tyft hi^ to dysplaysans auarys or to impacyens and he cu^mys by oon other
dyssauyng by oon mayner of flechyng for to cause him to entyr in vayn gloyr and
presumpcyon of him self and of his deydyes O Worthy crystyn man that thou art
consydyr how Weyl thou as beyn constant and ferm in the faith / stark anens god
/ charytabyl and pacye^t in all thy deydys. And how maynay Werkyes meritabyls
and Worthy of lowynges thou as doyn Weyl thou shoold have in the oon great joy
and gloryffy the. For thou art not aes other me^ quych as doyn ewyl synnys
innomyrabyl / always for oon oonly Weeping et lamentacyon that they have had to
god they have beyn sawyt the qwych goodlyar shoold be doyn to the tha^ to them.
For thou as ewyr lefyt Wertusly and in good Werkys et as resystyt to Wycys et
temptacyones so as oon Worthy knight Quher for thou shoold prys thy self and
ash at god a seyge of gloyr excellent be for all other for of right he may not
denyet to the be so mooch daily thou as manly Weyrryt for the faith of god. Et
this maynayr instantly The false ennemy essays to dyssayf man by pride spyrytwel
and by errogans of him self gloryfyant in his propyr deydys.

Pro quo notandum est
HEyr gheuys the actor oon notabyl and says that for syndry causys pride and
Wayngloyr is to show. First for so mooch that by this man is maid lyk to the
dewyl. For by pride so mooch oonly Was oon angel maid oon dewyl. Segundly by so
much that Wayn gloyr is oon maynar of blasphemyng for this that he gheuyes to
him self the honowr the qwich he shoold gheue to god. Thrydly for so mooch that
yt doys / da^ man for as says sant Gregoyr. Reminisce^do quis boni quid gessit
dum se apud se erigit apud acto rem humilitatis cadet. Qwen any in his parso^
gloryfys him self et aleftys him by any good that he has doyn he fallys and
deprymys anens god qwych is actor of humylyte. Sa^t austye^ says. Homo si se
iustificauerit et de iusticia sua presumpserit cadit. So be yt that man says
him self just and presumys of his iustifycatyon he fallys in damnacyon.

Remeyd et good inspyratyo^ ageyns the foresaid temptacyon.
Sis humilis Superbos punio Victus sum

HOr and their to that the pacyent lawbours in the artykyl of the deeth that he
may resyst to the lattar temptacyon qwych is of Wayn gloyr the a^gel gheuys him
oon good techyn and certain inspyracyo^ for to resyst say t. O Wrechyt power
sinner qwayr for aes thou pride and gheuys the co^stans that thou has in hop
faith / pacye^s and resystens / ageyns auarys / qwayr of oonly the gloyr
appartenys to god yt is so for of the thayr is no thing of good of Weyl of
Worthynes / et of me ryt as says owr lord. Sine me nihil potesties facere. With
out me e may do no thing. Ower that yt is Wryttyn i^ other playcys. Non tibi
aroges. Gheue thou the not of ar rogans. No^ te iactas. Gloryfye thou not Nonte
insolenter extollas.

Alyft thou the not insole^tly by pride. Nichil de te presumas. Presum no thing
of thy self. Nichil boni tibi tribuas. Gheue no thing of the good to the. For
says the angel. O freynd thou as no cause to exalt the. Bot mor either to meyk
the thayr to that thou be exaltyt. By this that says owr lord. Qui se exaltat
humiliabitur. Qwych he that exaltys him self shall be meykyt. By this that says
owr lord. Nisi efficiamini sicut paruulus iste non intrabitis in regnum
celorum. Says owr lord to his dyssypulys shawant oon innocent child if e make ow
not also meyk as this child e shall not enter in the reawm of hewyn. Et for so
much We shoold meyk We Weyl for this that god as said Qui se exaltat
humiliabitur. He that humylys him self shall be exaltyt. Et sa^t austyen say Si
te humilias deus discendyt ad te. Si te exaltas deues reced^^ a te. yff thou
meykys the god shall dyscend towart the. Et if thou exaltyes the by wayn gloy^
god shall depart from the. Et for that says the angel to the pacyent my freynd
put away that cursyt pride from thy thought qwych maid lucyfer the fairest of the
angels / the fowlest of all the dewyllys did cayst him down from the hye of the
hewys on to the deyp of hell and qwych is cause of al ewyl. For as says Saint
Bernard. Initium omnis peccati et causa tocius perditionis est superbia. The
beginning of al syn et cause of al pardycyon is pride. For that says the angel to
the pacie^t put away from the al syn of pride pryncypally and With out labowr or
traweyl thou shall owercum et corromp al other.

Vnde singulariter not a^dum est. Heyr puttys the actor of this presant book
oon fynal no tabyl twechant the last inspyracyon saya^t that yt is necessayr to
not that qwen any pacyent labowrys to deeth if he felys him tempyt of Wayn
gloyr et pride he shoold first thynk in him self that pride dysplesys so mooch to
god that be occasyon he sendys et byndys in damnacyon ewyrlestand. The most
nobyl of all the creaturys this vas Lucyfer and al is company for that al
creatur Wnderstondys not qwether they be Worthy of the hatre^t of god or of the
low of god We shoold much meyk Ws in taykyn exa^pyl of saint Anthoyn to qwyche
the dewyl said. O anthoni tu me vicisti / cu^ enim volo te exaltare tu deprimis
/ cum te volo deprimere tu erigis. O anthoyn thou as ower cu^myt me qwen I Wald
exalt the by Wayn gloyr thou meykyt the. Qwen I Would abbayssyt the and put thy
heart forth of contemplacyon thou royes and lyftyt the mor than before. Segundly
the pacyent shoold thynk that humylyte so mooch plesys to god that pryncypally

all the company of angels in the gloyr of paradys.

The right proffytabyl conclusyon that makys the actor i^ the eynd of this book
in the beginning of the latin. Si moriturus. et cetera.
Spe^ nobis nulla Animam amissimus Heu infame Furore consumor Confusi fumus

FOr to mayk conclusyon of this good and salutayr techyng the actor of this
book says that at the passions of deeth if the pacyent may speek and as We of
rayson he shoold do of heart et of mowth make and do good orayso^s to god the
father maykar prayant him by his holy meyrcy and by the Wertu of his precyows
passion of his bleshyt soon jesus christ he Would ressayff the i^ his gracys.
After this he shoold call the bleshyt vyergyn mary for is adwocat enens god. The
selfwayes also is good angel the qwych as kepyt him et generaly all the sant tys
of heuyn qwych Would pray god for him. Et hauand ewyr the cors and the
reme^brans of the passion of jesus christ before him and that he kyssyt or that
they at ar cyrconstans mayk him to kyssyt faylla^d that he may not speyk in the
Wers qweyr yt is Wryttyn. Disrupisti domine vincula mea tibi sacrificabo ho
stiam laudis. Qwych is to say i^ englysh. Lord thou aes brokyn my bandys I shall
sacryfy to the hosty of lowengys et he shoold say yt by.iij. tymys. For after
Cassydore / the Wers is of sych Wertu that he that says dewotyly in good
contrycyon in the eynd of the synnys of the parso^ they are forghewyn. Item
after We shoold make him to say if We may the Woordys followyng that they gheue
to saint Augustyn. That is to say / the pays of owr lord redemptur et sowerayn
makar almighty of hewyn et eerth jesus christ the wertu of his bleshyt passion /
the sing of the holy cors the most hayl / and cleen / integryte of the Wyergyn
mary / the bleshyng of the sa^ttys the keeping of the angels. Et all the
intercessyons et suffragys of all the choysyn men of god / and also the
suffragys of owr mother the holy church / most be bettwyx me et my ennemys
seyabyl and Wnseyabyl and in this howr of my deeth. Amen. Et shoold the said
pacyent say three tymys if he may or sum good person for him. Ower mor says the
actor intechand to al sayge parsons to acqwyr in his live oon faithful et trust
freynd to the qwych he as faithful trust the qwych heys vyth him i^ the artykyl
of the deeth for to gheue him trust astane the qwych may cause him to tayk the
deeth in thank for sych oon freynd is of much Worth and prowffytabyl. Et in
sych oon stayt the creatwr deys et that they sey that he as thyr condycyo^s
above said i^ his deeth vyth the prayeres that sum of his frendys doys for him
We may beleyf at god as doyeng him grace and has ressawyt him in the gloyr of
paradys to the qwych conwoy Ws the father soon and the holy gheost Amen.

Heyr endysh the book intytulyt the art of good deyng by samoht not gnywel Et
begynnys The pownt of the dreyd of god for to dyveyl The prologwe of the actor
above the traycte of godly dreyd for to dyweyl shall conteyn.x. chepture
pryncypals.


FOr that no man lywant in this present lywe no may understood certa^ly if he
be i^ the grace of god and low or i^ the hatrent. That is to say / forth of
his grace in the stayt of syn / as yt is Wryttyn in the ecclesyastyk in the.x.
chepr^. Nescit homo vtrum amore aut odio dignus sit. Also yt is Wndersto^dyng
that oon man Wayttys not the day no the howr of his deeth so as yt is Wryttyn
in the sefl cheptur. Nescit homo finem suum. Et as to this cause shoold oon man
rayssonabyl be ordaynyt in much dreyd of god and always dowt the howr of deeth
incertayn. For says the psalmyst in the psalm oon hondreth et.x. The dreyd of
god is the beginning of sapyens. Et shall be Weyl fynabyl the saowl of him or of
her the qwyche dowtys god. Initium sapientie timor domini. For he shall be
blyshyt of god of is deeth as that is Wryttyn in the ecclesyastyk in the first
cheptur. Timenti deum been erit in extremis et in die deffunctionis sue
benedicetur. Et Weritably the dreyd of god chassys et puttys forth the syn of
owr saowlies For he the qwych shall be With out dreyd of god may not be iustyfyed
as yt is Wryttyn in the ecclesyastyk in the first cheptur byfor allygyt. Timor
domini expellit peccatum / na^ qui sine timore est non poterit iustifirari. Et
in effec they that dredys god shall not be mysbeleyffand no dysobeyant to his
word as yt apperys in the ecclesyastyk in the segund cheptur. Quitiment dominu^
non eru^t incredibiles verbo illius. Et for that they shall be bleshyt / for man
is bleshyt in this World by certain bydyng et exspectacyon of ewyrlestand
beatylwd. Et shall be really by effec in the gloyr to the qwych god as ghewyn is
grace to have the dreyd of him as yt is Wryttyn in the ecclesiastyk in the.xxv.
cheptur Beatus est cui donatum est habere timorem dei. Or yt is so that thayr
is nothing qwych mor may and shoold cause and forthoryng the dreyd of god i^ owr
hartys than to thynk often of the pains of hell ewyrlestand the qwych suffrys and
shall suffyr their ewyrmor ewyrlestandly with out hop of redempcyon the qwyche
ar deyd of this world in deydly syn. Et for that al them that arlywant et
faithful studyans in the art et scyens of good deyng shoold oon tym the day at
all the les or syndry tymys if yt be possybyl retowrn to the^ self by good
medytacyon co^syderant the synnys that they have doyn again the bonte of god
i^ so great no^byr yt may be they may not nombyr them or can not. Et co^syderant
that et yt War not the meyrcy of god inco^tynent that they offencyt god deydly
the dewyl of hell Would put them to deeth et Wald beyr their saowlys to hell / as
yt is Wryttyn in the thryd cheptur of the trewis and lamentacyons of Iheremy
Misericordie domini quia non consumpti sumus. Also shoold consider if they deyd
With their Wryttyng in oon oonly deydly syn not shrywyng or be malicyows
neglyge^s that they shoold be da^nyt in ewyrlesta^d pains of hell With out any
hop of rede^pcyon / as yt is vryttyng in the Canonyk of saint James in the
segund cheptur et they had kepyt al their lywe the conmandyme^s of god un the
howr of their deeth et yt be so that they die i^ the ower passing and
tra^sgressyon of the said conma^dymens by oon oonly deydly syn. Qui tota^ legem
seruauerit offe^dat aute^ i^ vno factus est oi^mreus. Iacobi.ij.c. Et veritably
and We Will Weyl be hold this qwych is said and if the saowl of the creatwr
qwych is dowther and spows of god by grace is delyweryt to the dewyl et
condamnyt to suffyr ewyr mor ewyrlestand pains of hell for oon deydly syn We
shoold than contynualy bid in the dreyd of god in doyeng good Werkys and dreyd
to fall in the said ewyrlestand pains. Qwych ar so horrybyl and dreydabyl et
merweyllws thayr is not oon man mortel qwych can suffycyently thynk Wryt no
pronone For as Wryttyn yt to the corynthyens in the segu^d cheptur eyn as not
the fight no the eyr eryes not and yt is not dyscendyt in the heart of any man
by suffysant Wnderstondyng this that god as ordanyt to them the qwyche he lowys
in paradys. Oculus non vidit nec auris audiuit / nec in cor hominis ascendit
que preparauit deus diligentibus se. Et of the contrary yt is to Wnderstond
that. Eseys not / no eyr erys not / and yt is not dyscendyt parfytly in the
heart of man that god as grathyt by iustys to them that dyis in the stayt of
deedly syn. Et for so mooch the prophet Esaye says in his.xxx. cheptur he
merweyl lyt of the said paynys qwen he said to the synnars. Qwyche is he ettwys
you that may habyt With the fwellant fire of hell and With the ewyrlestyng
byrnyngys. As if he Would say no man may habyt With out great afflyccyon. Qwych
of you may dwell With the swellyng fire. Quis ex vobis poterit habitare cum igne
deuorante / aut quis habitabit cu^ arrdoribus sempiternis. Et to this cause that
fowl and parfyt dried of god may disce^d i^ to the hartyes of the^ that
desyryes to leyf Weyl and that they may have cler Wndersto^dyng of this qwych I
shall Wryt heyr after. Et the art of shyens of good deyng I shall traytte short
by after the small grace and Wndersto^dyng that god as lent me of maynay syndry
pains of hell and a most of all the paynees of the pains of the qwych the
Wryttyngys and holy doctures of owr mother the holy church as determynit et
Wryttyn in syndry Wolumes et for to do by ordyr I shall dywys this present
traycte in.x. chepturs. The first cheptur shall conteyn the dysputacyon the
qwych I thynk to make ageynes them qwych is Wnfaythful and beleyffyes not that
their is hell no purgatory et the rayso^s the auctorytes the qwych / I thynk to
allege to them.

Pride The segu^d cheptur shall tractye of the first pain of hell selfly of
certain Wellyes the qwych the saowllys of prydful men et prydful Woman ar
hangyth. Enwy The.iij. cheptur shall traycte of the segund pain of hell that this
of freysyng Waters the qwych the saowllys of enwyows qwych ar punyshyt
crowelly. Ire The.iiij. cheptur shall traycty of the trhyd pain of hell that is
of certain hoyllys et placys of derknes qweyr they full of ire ar pershyt With
knyffys that are sharp in syndry mayners. Sweyrnes The.v. cheptur shall traycte
of the.v. pain that is of oon plays horrybyl dyrk in the qwych ar heddars
serpens that byttys et punyshys the peupyl that are sweyr in syndry partys of
their body. Vrechydnes The.v. cheptur shall traycte of the.vj. pain of hell that
is of great chauderons full of diverse metaylls play and and et so as the Water
above thy fire in the qwych all the saowllys of Wrechyd peupyl forto fyl them of
their auarys to their great and Wrechyd damnacyon Lychery. The.vij. cheptur shall
traytte of the.vij. pain of hell that is of oon great ill full of Wellyes that are

the qwych they that are lychyrows ar horrybyly turmentyt. Glotonny The.viij.
cheptur shall traitte of the.viij. pain of hell that is of oon vala of oon flood

i^nomberabyl turment of taydys serpens heddars and other venunsum bestys of the
said flood. The.ix. cheptur shall traytte of the.ix. pain contenant syndry other
kind. Of pains of hell after this that the docturs of owr mother the holy
church as the holy Wryttyes of prophetys has spokyn. The.x. cheptur shall
shortly traytte of sum thyngys necessayrs of the pains of proptory Et thyes
shall be the trayttyt at eynd of this presa^t traytte. etces


The first cheptur shall be trayttyt of the certain dysputacyon ageyns the false
crystyn men.
Qwe^ yt is to the first cheptur and party of this present traytte it is to not
that their is maynay falls crystyn men and Woome^ the qwych says With their
mowth oonly that they beleyf Weyl in god and in the holy vryttyes the qwych god
has prono^cyd by him et be his holy prophetys. Bot newer the ses / they thynk
of the contrary by effec. Of the qwych says sant pol in the pystyl qwych is
Wryttyn to is dyssypyl tytus in the first cheptur qwen he says. They shryue
With mowth that they Wnderstond god. Bot they deney by thayr Weyrkys.
Co^fitentur se nosse deum factis autem negant. Et for that they falls their
faith i^ great peril and da^nacyon of their faowllys. For qwhat ewyr he be that
Would besawyt yt is ghaynant that he beleyf and have faithful and hoyl faith
apprewyt by good Werkys. This the qwych doys not they that are coustumyt to say
if they be joys of paradys et of pains of hell et purgatory. The Wryt says yt
is oon merweullus thing. Sych mayner of pewpyl they gayn say not symply et
hollyly the holy Wryt et the faith catolyk that holdys et affermys yt. Bot also
sych pewpyl certanly if they de i^ sych oon stayt they shall be damnyt. For the
crystyn faith shoold be sewr With constant fors With out any dowt no heresy.
Sych vys if their com oon angel of hewyn qwych preshyt oon other faith than yt
of owr salwyowr et redemptur jesus christ We shoold not beleyf it as that says
the apoystyl in the pystyl Wryttyn to the hebrews in the first cheptur. Licet
angelus de celo eua^geliet vobis preter quam eua^geliamus vobis anathemasit.
Certanly faith is the first ettwys all the Wertus With out the qwych the other
ar of no valeur no of no proffyt is yt is qwych makys the man son of god be
baptysyng so as says the apoystyl in the pystyl to galatyens. Omnes filij dei
estis per fidem. No men may be the son of god bot be faith yt aperys i^ the
vangelyst sant ioon in the first cheptur. Debit eis potestate^ filios dei fieri
his qui credunt in nonine eius. yt is the fundatur of the faith et of al meryt.
Of the qwych fondeme^t says the apoystyl in the segund cheptur qwen he says. No
man may put other fondeme^t bot he qwych as put yt that is to Wnderstond the
faith of jesus christ. Fundame^tum aliud nemo potest ponere preter illud quod
positu^ est iesues cristus id est fides cristi. Et for that yt is inpossybyl to
pleys god With out parfyt faith as yt is Wryttyn by the apoystyl in the pystyl
to the hebrews in the.xj. cheptur. Sine fide i^possibile est placere deo. For
as the bra^chys of the tredryys and deys also soon as the root is deyd. Self
Ways is the Werkys of crystyn men et Women ar deyd et of no effec for to meryt
the ewyrlestand qwen they are partyt of solydyte et of the ferme co^stans of the
faith of owr redemptur. As to this cause al crystyn pewpyl shoold desyr to live
and die in the faith of the church. Et shoold beleyf hold ferm by the.xij.
artykyles of the faith. For he qwych mysbeleyffys moon artykyl he is in Way of
damnacyo^. For that no men may besauyt no shall be With out faithful and hoyl
faith of the.xij. artykyls qwych ar contenyt in thy faith that is in the credo.
This aperys by the Word of owr sawyowr et redemptur jesus christ in the gospel
of sant marc. He that beleyffys not he shall be da^nyt. Quinon crediderit
co^damnabytur. Or yt ye so in the.v. artykl of owr faith contenyt in the credo
sant phelyp appoystyl says of the redemptur jesus christ that he dyscendyt in
hellys. Descendit ad i^ferna tertia die. He did incontinent qwen the saowl Was
partyt of the body. Thought it be so thath the said saowl vas Wnyt vyth the
diuinyte. Et disce^dyt i^ the lymbe of the fathers qweyr he did abyd from the
howr of non of holy friday qwych Was the howr of the deeth of jesus christ Wnto
the howr of his bleshyt resurrexyon. Always the dywynyte Was ewer vnyt With
the saowl i^ so mooch as he vas in the hellys. Et With the body qwych lay i^
the sepulkyr Of the redemptur. Et yt is gh^nant to not that before the passion
of jesus christ their Was i^ hell.iiij. receptakyle et placye the qwych al
saowlye discendyt to after the dyuersyte of their estyat i^ the qwych they
deyd. For the qwych deyd parfytly ewyl descendyt qweyn they are yt present in
hell of damnyt pains of the qwych We shall speyk heyr after. Et jesus christ
discendyt not in that hell for he delyuryt non of that plays. For in hell thayr
ye no redempcyon as says sant gregoyr in the.ix. cheptur of his mor^le^ The
meyrcy of god doye^t perdon delyuryes neuyr them qwych y^ iustye as onys
co^damnyt i^ the pain byl placys of hell. Nequaquam vltra misericordia
percentis liberat quoe semel in locis penalybus iusticia iudicanti^ damnat. Et
for that ve shoold no Ways pray for them. Thyes co^fyrmys sant augustyn in oon
of has sermons qweyr he say Et yt var so that I Wnderstud that the saoul of my
father var in hell I shoold no mor pray for him than for the dewyl. The segund
plays and princypal of hell qwych as above the plays of them that are damnyt is
the lymb of the chyldryn that are deeth boorn qwych deys in the syn original i^
the qwych plays the saowffys of they chyldryn as pain of dammayge that is to
say pryuacyon of the sight of god. For thayr is not in the said plays any pain
sensybyl Bot their is dyrknees owtwart That is of the pryuacyo^ of the Wysyo^
of god et of the grace of god Et in this plays jesus christ dyscendyt not no
delyueryt no^ no Will not deliver non. Raysson qweyr for that their War not
captabyls of the grays of jesus crhyst / the saowllys of the chylder deyant With
out cyrconsyon. Et now after the passion of jesus christ / their dyscendys the
chyldryn qwych deys With out baptysyng. The third plays of the said hell is
purgatoyr the qwych is above the lymb of the said small chyl d^^n the qwych is
oon fire corporal byrna^t sharply and merueylleus to suffyr of the qwych ve
shall speyk in the last cheptur of this present trayttye. Et in the qwych plays
ar punyshyt the saowllys of them that as not fulfyllyt their pennans in this
World as to Worthy satyffaccyon. Of the quych plays they vat put forth be the
rede^ptur jesus christ qwen he dysce^dyt in the lymbe of the fathers. They qwych
var sufyffycye^tly purget or qwych as meryt or deseruyt that they shoold be
disyueryt in the dyscens of jesus christ. The.iiij. plays above hell is the lymb
of the holy fatheres of the qwych they War pryuyt for sum tym of the vysyon of
god With out any other pain For they had not no thoyllyt not no pain se^sybyl.
Et i^ this plays dyscendyt jesus christ and did breast the portys. Et put forth
owr holy fathers in the qwych plays before said no men desce^dyt no shall descend
newer mor. By this that said is clerly yt apperys by the.v. artykyl of owr
faith that ve shoold of no Wys dowt bot thayr yes oon hell ordant by the iustys
of god for to punysh them that deys i^ the stayt of deydly syne wyrle stand Et
oon purgatory for to purge owr synnyes and for to mayk the layf of the pennans
of owr synnys. The qwych they that decedys of this present World in the stayt
of grace may not do parfytly their pennans so that they are taykyn With bodyly
deyd. Bot yt is oon thing merweullows that sum Warldly peupyl of this presant
World ar so holdyn in the temporel thyngys. That be so great cupidyte that they
desyr the thyngys tra^sytoyres that they foret the spyrytwel thyngys. Sych
mayner of pewpyl the dewyl ledyes the voorld and the flech that they Wnderstond
not their self that they beleyf not that their is oon other paradys bot the
playsanset po^pes of the World that their aes no other hell for to punysh owr
Wekyt synnys lycherows et Wrechydnes in the qwych they leyff in. This qwych
procedys by fault of faith With out the qwych as I have declaryth heyr before
the qwych yt is inpossybyl at ewyr they besawyt. Et in short I shall declayr
that their as oon hell by the Wryttys et autorytes of of holy docturs I suppos
also that the dewyl of hell ettwys all the te^ptacions of the qwych he tempys man
he efforeys him gretumly above al thyngyes for tayk the eyn of the faith from
them. By the qwych he beleyffys that hell is oon plays ordaynyt by the iustys of
god for to punysh the ewyl doars et transgressurs of the co^mendymens of god
qwych ar damnyt ewyrlestandly. Et thye doys the dewyl that he may mor eythly
led the saowl be the blyndnes that he blyndyes them by the Way of deydly synet
doyand synvyth out dreyd of any pain They to qwom he shawyes not the pain of
hell. The qwych he beleyffys not to be / he fallye sowdanly i^ the pain the
qwych he dowtye not. Et to the mayner of the hang man the qwych bandys the eyn
of the trayttur of the qwyche he Will smyt of the heyd. Thought yt be so that the
said traytur beleyffys that he shoold not smyt him so soon et that he shoold
lat him speek mor. In the fygur of this the king Sedechyas had the eyn bryssyng
by the king Nabegodonosar and Was led in babylon as yt apperys in the.iiij.
Book of the kyngys in the last cheptur. By the qwyche is gheuyn to Wnderstond
that Nabegodonozor that ye the dewyl of hell taykys a Way the eyn of the king
Sedechyas. That is to say that he blyndyes the powyr and Wrechyd sinner tayk
and from him the faith the qwyche he shoold have and the beleyffyng of the
paynys of hell. Et ledys him fynaly in the captyuyte Wrechydnes penabylyte of
babylon That is the horrybyl pain confusyon and sorrow of hell. This I presuppos
and say that hell is and that We shoold not dowt for sum rayssons and certayns
causys qwyche I shall say. The first is. For if yt appertenys to the gloyr and
magnyfycens of oon temporel king to have fair and greyt pallays for the
resydens of him et of his pewpyl and frendys selfwayes yt appartenys to him to
have fossys and prysons for to put and hold is mysdoars and others contrary
ennemys. By mor rayssonyt appartenys to the king of gloyr qwyche ye king and
lord of gloyr above al other kyngys qwyche ar above the eerth and for to have
oon pallays for them that are good that is the hewyn. Et oon prison for the^
that are will the qwych ar Wnfaythful and transgressurs of the commandymens of
god / that is to Wnderstond hell The segund raysson is / for god owr salwyowr
and redemptur jesus christ is so good so just that he Would not in no mayner of
vys leyf no thing i^ his reawm and lordshyp be yt in hewyn or in eerth that War
fowl et dyshonnest and Wnryghtus War yt any syn or delyt qwyche did bid
vnpunyshyt and Wnsatyssyet Et aes to this as Job i^ the.xxiiij cheptur. God
leyf thou no thing inpunyshyt / thought yt be oon small thought bot he punyshyt.
Deus inultu^ abire nichil putitur minimum etiam cogitatum. For yt is that We se
syndry synnars die With out pe^nans the qwych dyis i^ their howrdoms and
mysdoyngys the qwych as contynuyt in their mysdoyngys and lycherys. The others
dyis in Wrechydnes and of this they have not suffert no paynyes in this World.
For the qwyche is neydful to conclud that they shall be punyshyt in oon other
World. Et the placys of the above said punycyon is hell. Et as We sey the lawys
posytywys dyscernys and ornys that the above said synnares for their demerytys
shall be send in banyshyng parpetuel. Sychwys the iustys of god Will and ordanys
that they synnars by send in hell in the qwyche they shall have pain wyrlestand.
Item et if the iustys ecclesyastyk partys and puttys forth any synnar qwan they
cu^ to their grawyng of the company of faithful crystyn men beryen them forth
of the holy eerth in prophayn placys fowl et fylthful. Qwheyr for may not than
the iustys of god the qwyche is With out comparayson mor greyt than the iustys
ecclesyastyks part ewyrlestandly sum saowllys Wnworthy of the company of
santtys leyffand them oon plays fowl et fylthful and gheua^t them in the
banyshyng Wrechyt of hell. Item al man Weyl ordaynyt in good raysson says that
god the makar is sowerantly sayge. Et the first et sowerayn good of the qwych
may no man be better. Et if yt be so as thou beleyffys that god is of al makar
and gowernowr of this World. Thou shoold not beleyf no say that he be blyndyt
and that he seys not clerly the thyngys qwyche ar maid in this World. Et thou
shoold not beleyff if he saw them bot he Wndersto^dys them parfytly. Et also
thou shoold not beleyff that he be so i^ iwst bot that he gheue reward to good
paynys to ewyl qweyr for yt ghanys necessaryly to infer that in hell is the
plays ordaynyt for punyshon of the said ewyl so as paradys is ordaynyt for the
good and for the reward of the good pewpyl. Others rayssons and parswasyons may
be heyr maid bot I leyf them for cause of shortness. Et I have not allegyt the
said rayssons bot for them that are obstynat infaythful the qwych mysknowys les
god than the thyngyes insensybyls the qwych obeys to the makar and to his Word
this that doys not the said Wnfaythful pewpyl. For the reed se to the playsyr
of god obeyant to the makar dyuydyt / yt self and maid Way to the chyldryn of
ysrael qwyche passyt With in yt qwyche apperys in Exodi in the.xiiij. cheptur.
The flood iordayn obeyant to god did draw yt abayk for to gheue passage to the
said chyldryn of ysrael so as yt apperys in Iosue i^ the.iij cheptur The
stoonys et hye rochys of armon inclynyt them to obey to god for to gheue them
passayge to the said chyldryn of ysrael as qwych apperys in the book of Numeri
in the.xxj. cheptur. The rooch obeyant to god did cast abondans of Watyr by two
tymys / as yt apperys in the book of Numeri in the.xvj. et.xx. chepturs. Et the
sown obeyant to god the makar did draw baykware on to the oryent / for yt
Was.x. howrs and.x. other howrs War adiowstyt in the tym of king Ezechias / as
yt apperys in the kyngys i^ the.xx. cheptur Et in the tym of Iosue the said
sown and also the moon did obey to god the creater et arrestyt their self and
did abyd by the spays of oon day With out steryng of oon plays. Qwhat shall thou
say thou myserabyl and Wrechyd sinner Wnfaythful if the things insensybyls
obeys to the Word et to the Will of god the maker. The qwych creatwrys as no
Wnderstondyng. By mor raysson thou shoold be obeyant to the Word of god the
makar qwyche says to the and affermys in syndry placys et passayges of the holy
catholyk techyng ewangelyk. That hell is oon plays ordaynyt for to punysh the
Wrechyd sinners qwyche dyis in the stayt of deydly syn / With out shryuyng et
Worthy pennans. This he says to the first salwyowr in the gospel Wryttyn be is
ewa^gelyst sant Mathow in the.v. cheptur qwen he says. Cursyt da^nyt go e to
the fire of hell ewyrlesta^d. Ite maledicti in ignem eternum. Et mor expressyly
he expressys the plays qwen he says by his scrybe saint Luc spekand of the ewyl
rych in the.vj. cheptur that he is deyd et grawet in hell. Mortuus est dives et
sepultus est in inferno. By the qwych auctoryte apperys clerly that hell is oon
horrybyl plays et of sharp sorrow. Et for that powyr Wnfaythful peupyl qwych as
owr heart so indurcyt dreyd e not and dowtys not to fall in the bitter pain of
hell. Be e certain et dowt not that e sey or e may not sey fyndry thyngys
naturells the qwych shoold be lyk to ow Wnfaythful War not yt that e have
cowstum to se them. Et certanly if oonchyld War norryshyt in oon cave that War
dyrk With out light that he did not se no sown nomown to the earrys et aage of
dyscrecyon and selfwayes that they said to him that their is oon cleyr lythnyng
sown that lyghtnys all the World. Et also oon fair light that lyghtnys all the
night by all the varld the night and so maynay sterys qwych ar the ornement of

et so maynay fair edyffycys above the eerth. Also With fyndry other thyngys
naturells qwyche ar merweyllows to beleyff. Et indowtabyly this may be to him
Wnfaythful also as e thynk the pains of hell to ow Wnfaythful. Bot qwen the
child qwych as beynnorryshyt in oon plays that is dyrk et that he cu^mys above
the eerht i^ oon cler plays and that he seys this that they have spokyn to him
before / he Will merweyl and Will understood by experyens this that he dow tyt to

horrybyl et merweyllows paynys of hell. Bot helas yt shall be ower layt. For that
so mooch that We by i^ thies World let us not by incredibyl The pain of the

shoold be to ow suffycyant exampyl of dreyd. No merweyl e not that ve be ewyr
lestandly i^ the fire of hell i^ pain and sorrow With out deyng. For as says
saint Augustyn in the.xxj. cheptur of the cite of god. That yt is a merweyllows
thing to leyff in the fire and to be norryshyt With out suffyr sorrow and that
to leyf et suffyr pain. This that We may se in this World by experyens of the
salemandyr the qwych leyffys With in the fire and may not leyf other part. Et
maynay syndry examplys bot for cause of shortness I leyf them al. Et qwo Will reyd
of lym and the condycyon of yt et other diverse examplys they may find by

merweyllows and lykys to be impossybyl to them qwych as not had experyens. Et
always qwen they have had experyens of the said paynys of hell or qwen they
gheue faith to them that as had exsperymens. Sych lyk of necessyte yt is
ghana^t that yt be so of falls crestyn pewpyl and other Wnfaythful qwych
beleyffys not this that they rehers of the paynys of hell. For they man that
passys to the said plays of hell after their deeth for to have importabyl and
inextymabyl experyens of the said paynys of hell or that they gheue faith to
the^ that as feld them by experyens The ewyl rich above said of the qwych
story yt is long to rehers has rehersyt is i^ the story of saint Luc in the.xv.
cheptur he had ressaywyt of god in this World the goodys temporells and he
beant in torment and paynys of hell leftyt is eyn i^ hye towart the lymbe of the
fathers in the qwych he saw abraam and the powyr seppyr man that beggyt from
him. To the qwych the cursyt rich ha refusyt the almows Et inco^tynent the
ewyl rych as so much as he might cry With hye Woys and said. Father abraam
pleyssyt the to have pytye and meyrcy of me and send me heyr the ladyr heyr to
me that he Weyt the eynd of hies finger in cold Watyr their to that he may lat
oon gowt fall oon my tongue. For I am horrybyly byrnt et tormentyt in this low of
fire. To the qwych Abraam answeryt. Soon of perdicyon thynk oon that thou as
had the habo^da^s of the goodys in the World and al thy plesans Woluptys et
desyrs. Et the powyr ladyr has had nothing bot tribulacyo^s. Et as to this cause
he has heyr consolacyon plesans et rest With out that he have no thoyl any
other pain sensybyl. Et thou shall be ewyr mor in tormens and paynys for thy syn.
Et if the said Wntrewabyl and falls catholykye Will not sewyrly beleyf the said
ewyl rych bot that they Will have other approbacyons I shall allyge them and

DE reyd i^ the gospel of sant ioon in the.xij. cheptur that the Saytterday be

et of mesellery by owr salwyowr et redemptur. Et for that he is callyt lepreus.
Et he grathyt to him oon souper mary magdelayn and mary marthe they War

all the horrybyl syeges et all the abhomynabyls Wrechydnes the qwych they that are
damnyt suffrys i^ hell. So as reharsys sant augustyn in the book maid by him of

doing for owr instruccyo^ their to that We may be mor certain of the said
pains and mor dylygens to show them by good Werkys. Et certanly the said
lazarus qwych rehersys the said paynyes of hell i^ the prese^s of owr rede^ptur
might not say bot Weryte. For he spak in the prese^s of him that Wnderstwd al.
By the qwych no man may thayk cause of ygnorans bot their yes oon hell i^ the

thought yt be so that I may allege syndry holy parsons the qwych haes seyn the
said pains and as reweyllyt the^ to syndry as yt apperys of sant scaryoth et

the text of the gospel berys Wytnes. Et self Ways apperyt the self soon of

The segund cheptur shall traycte of the first pain of hell seeing by lazarus

Pride
THe holy man laarus at the request of the asystans of the souper above said i^
the house of the said simon lepreus so as says sant augustyn in the book of the
Wordys of owr lord self Ways by the co^mandymens of the redemptur et salwyowr
jesus christ did begin to shaw be ordyr sum of the pryncypal pains of hell the
qwych he had seeing i^ hell. Thyes qwych after Was preshyt of the appoystyls by
mary magdaleynet other holy dyscyplys of owr lord. Et after they have beyn put
in Wryt / not that a mortel man might sufffycyently Wryt them no pronons. Bot
in so mooch that mind et engyn of mankind may have co^prehendyt et holdyn. Et
certanly thought yt be so that this qwych shall be Wryttyn heyr after be mer
Weyllous to their lementabyl to prono^s and dreydful to sey in to payntyng or
hystory always no man may paynt no make hystory of the hondreth party of this
qwych is in the real exystems. Et to this yt is not neydful to have other
Wyttnes bot the Wryttynges of the gentylls and payans. The quych as had faith
of the said paynys of hell. For Wyrgyl says in the.vj. book of Eneydes that if
he had oon ho^dreth tongys and oon hendreth mowthys et the Woys of y^^ or of
latton he myth not comprehend all the syndry formys and maynars et all the diverse
namys of the paynys of hell. No^ michi sint lingue centum si^^ or a que centum
ferrea vox omnes stelerum co^prehendere fora^s omnia penarum parcurere nomina
possu^. Et as this cause their ar much to dreyd and in dowt. Said than lazarus
to the assystens I have seyn in hell first above oon ill imbrasyt of fire and
byrnstoon byrnant / great quantyte of weyllys of myslys their qwych did towrn by
great impetwosyte co^tynually With out any rest. Et to the partys owtwart et
inwart of the said Weyl War tadys fessynyt of byrnant yrn to the qwych they War
hong Wrechydly the saowffys of prydful pewpyl the qwych did Weyp and cry and
sorrow et murn blasphemant the nam of god lynand qwych maid them for to thool

Et neyr the said hyl thayr Was oon horrybyl dewyl namyt lamathan captayn of
pride et king above all the soonnys of pride / the qwych Was transformyt i^ fygur
of oon beyst of merueyllows gretnes. For he vas / as yt lykyt mor great than all the / hyllys of the World yt had the eyn as two hyllys byrnant the mowth so
mooch so horrybyl as it Warlyk that he might Worray.x. thousand men of armies of
the qwych mouth com forth agret brandon of feyr mextinguabyl the qwych cowyryt
the said Wrechyd saowllye qwych War fessynyt to the said qweyllys. The said
best did hold in his patys oon great and merweyflowe stayf of fire bryngyng et
With the qwych he did smyt et scruge the said saowllyes. Et ewyrych turnyng
that they said Weyllyesmayd he did smyt vyth his cursyt byrnand says above the
hye of the qweyl saya^d go down cursyt prydful peupyl and go down in the fire
et byrnston byrnant law ow in the deypnes of da^nacyon et fire ewyrlesta^d. For
this that he Would have beyn leftyt i^ the vorld by Wanyte of pride. O what
profyttys to ow now owr greyt / pride / po^pys / clothys of dyssolucyon / yowr

Off thyr ^eelys says not oonly the ho^^ Wryt bot with that the ^ryttye of the

Envy


THe holy man laarus after thies that he had rehersit the paynees above said
did say of the segu^d pain that he had seyn swffyr and thool other faowllys
da^nyt et sayand I have seyn certa^ly floodys in hell in the qwych the cursyt
enwyows men et Woman qwych partys of this World ar deppyt sum to the nawel and
other to the oxstars. Et above the^ the qwych floodys rynnes oon Wynd so sharp
so coold so cheyra^d and so vyole^t that their yes no man that may exsprym yt.
of this Wynd the said saowllys ar smyttyng so horrybyl that for to eshow the
said Wynd they plong them With in the said flood that is so horrybyl froysyng.
and this doyeng they are merweyllowsly torme^tyt and scurgyd tha^ be for.
Neyrthyr said floodys ar other sta^kies al of byrnyng fire the qwych ionnys to

et tormentyes them so horrybyl and pytewsly that their is no tongue that can
exspryme no Wndestond comprehe^d no heart thynk. Others dewyllys With great
crukys of yrn the qwych drawys sum of the said saowllys out of the said stankys
and puttys them by Wntrewabyl felnes With in the said floodys. O qwaht We
pyngys qwat cryengys qwat mowrnyngys maykyes the said saowllys so rewyng / so

the thondyr that makys the felon fire plenyshyt of hyrn ston fowl et stynkant.
So heyr We also pyteabyl of the said saowllys qwych cries With he Woyes. Cursyt
be the howr that We War ewyr boorn. Of the other syd the most dreydabyl din of
the dewyl pryncypally of the said beelzebuth the qwich the Woys is so horrybyl
says to the said saowllys ewyr mor scurgyng the^ and castyng the^ from flood to

falls and ewyl crystyens for of this e have approbacyon by the said laarus. and
of the said floodyes and stankys e have the text of the holy Wryt in Job
the.xxiiij. cheptur qweyr yt is Wryttyn that the ewyl saowllyes damnyt shall pas

qwych they shall have sorrow imcomparabyl. So aes ych oon may have experyment as
to the handys and the nayllys froysyng / their no thing so sorrowful as to hold
them to the fire. Transibunt ab aquis niuium ad calorem nimium. Also yt is
Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the.xxj. cheptur that the part et portyon of them
that are damnyt shall be in oon stank byrnant of fire and byrnstoon. Pars illorum
erit i^ stagno ardenti igne and sulphur Et this suffys as to the segund pain.

The.iiij. cheptur is of the.iij. pain of hell.
Ire.
THe cheptur followyng shall traytte of the.iij. pain of hell. The qwych did se
lazarus in the said hell. For he said to the assystens qwych Was at the souper
in the hows of Simon leprowes that he had seeing in hell oon cave right dyrk
qwych Was lyk that yt Was full of tablys and stallys so as yt might be oon
bowchery i^ the qwich plays he saw the saowllys of men and Women that War full
of ire et of fellonny in this World. Et says also that the said saowllyes War
lyeng Wpwart et abowth them Balberyth dewyl of hell capytaynet h^yd of menet
Women full of ire With sindry other dewyllys. The qwych had great and horrybyl
axys With great swordys et lenyssys Weyl sharpyt and cowtant the qwych the said
dewyllys peyrcyt and cowttyt the said powyr saowllys the qwych did cast great
Wepyngys lamentacyons and mournyngys With great and me weyllows cryengys
horrybyls / et Wrechyt plantys right pyteabyl to eyr. To the qwych saowllys the
said baalberyth dewyl infernal captan as said is of me^ et Women full of ire
says With oon Woys dredabyl et horrybyl Unhappy et Wrechyt damnyt small thing
proffytys to you owr yrys yowr blasfemys and felonnes resistans. Now e ar iugyt
et condamnyt to preson et ewyrlesta^d pain. Quheyr ewir e shall die in lyuand and
ewyr live i^ dya^d. Et this said and doyeng cu^mys others dewyllys With great

said saowllys so peyrcyt and cuttyt et castys the^ With in oon other fornays
much full of fire bytna^t and other dewyllys blawys. Et by great ire the said
fornays With great trukyes and stayssys of yrn. Their is hard Wepyngys /
cryengys lamentacyons / showtyngys / in estymabyls. Et so much Was the said
saowllys byrnt With in the said fire of the said fournays that they War redyget
as to noght / ^yt Warlyk that they War reyd as byrna^t colys and ambrasyt of
fire as on ba^ of fire bowyt qwych as yt cummys forth of the furnays. After
they said dewyllys of hell qwych torme^tyt so / the said saowllys tha^ they did
tayk the^ With their turkaysys infernals et put the^ above their studys al
imbrasyt of fire and did smyt the^ With great strypys of ammers above the said
saowllys Wnto this that they War redygyt et put to oon mass or oon lomp so as
they had beyn gaderyt i^ oon. Et not ageynsta^dyng they did not die How Weyl al
Ways they desyryt the deeth / and they may not find yt. Et this doyn the said
dewyll of hell ashyt ettwys the^ is yt a newth suffycys yt not. Et the other
dewyl qwich Waes in oon other forge neyr them answert. Cast Ws them this that
they did / et they resawyt them With their turkysys before that they might fall

them et tormentyt them. Sychlyk tormentyt the others now heyr and now their. Et
they War so byrnt the said saowllys that yt Was lyk that they War redyget in
sparkys of fire. Et tha^ after they turnyt i^ their first figur and Was brought
agheyn to the first pain above said. Et so contynually they are et shall be the
said saowllys in pain wyrle stand for the cursyt syn of ire. the qwych shoold
be shewyt by faithful crystyn men if they Will show the said pains of hell /
neyd is to have pacyens. Et for all approbacyo^ of the said is in the holy Wryt
I allege this qwych ye^ Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the xvij. cheptur. that is
that the ewyl damnyt as blasphemyt the nam of god for the sorrow of their
Woondys doing to them by the dewillys of hell. Blasphe mauerunt deum celi pro
doloribus et vulneribus suis. Et of this also is Wryttyn in the prowerbes
in.xix. cheptur that ammers ar grathyt in hell to the body of fowlysh pewpyl
that is to say of sinners. Et mallei percutientis stultorum corporibues Et this
suffycys as to the.iiij pain above said.

Awarys.
THe holy man laarus rehersyt to the assystens at the super above said that he
saw in hell oon other mayner of paynys. For he saw great chawderons to the
maynayr of fowrnases byrna^t full of syndry met tells ettant and playant as Water
doys above the fire. Et With in the said metals Was plonget the saowllys of
Wrechyt peupyl men and Women that vsyt of awarys for to fyl them of their
cursyt awarys et cowoytys of the temporel goodys the qwych they have excersyt
i^ this World. After the qwych their vas oon horrybyl dewyl na^myt ma^mona heyd
and captayn of awarycyows With maynay other syndry dewyllys detestabyls and
abhomynabyls to behold. The qwych var al cowert of byrnant fire et did hold the
said saowllys With fors With in the said chawderons With great brochys et
fowrkys of yrn vyth the qwych they persyt the^ Wnto the inwart partys of the
heart. Et of that cu^mys oon great horrybyl smok of dyrknes selfways a dyrk low
mor stynkant and mor abhomynabyl that We may not Wnderstond no thynk. Et
incontinent I hard oon horribyl cry and shutyng right horrybyl. Et oon tho^der
so dredabyl qwyche might belyk as al fondemens of hell et of eerth trymblyt. Et
ettwyes the otheres thyngys he saw oon great chawderon sqwaryt to the^ mayner of
oon cystern partyt allow myxyt With oon stynka^d smok abhomynabyl to the maynayr
of oo^ cowlon qwych vas so long that stentyt so hye that yt War lyk that yt

oonly War redygyt in noght falland of new With the dewyllys Wnto the deyp of

Et say and this they did ryf them self the Wysagys. Et the dewyllys eyrand the
said lame^tacyons the qwych did go about them i^ the said low they crukyt them
With their horrybyl crukys and they draw them Wnto the deyp of the said furnays
and chawderons qweyr they have suffert swffrys et shall suffyr Wnthool lerabyl

Wsuryers and Wrechyd saowllyes qwych as put al yowr love i^ gold and met al

Now e ar in the turmens of the qwyche e shall newyr part always e shall live in

Omnes vultus redigentur in ollam. It is Wryttyn in Job in the.xx. cheptur. That

and the saowllys of them qwyche taykys the ghyftys et goodys of others
Wnryghtusly so as doys the Wsuryers and okerers. Ignis deuorabit tabernacula

Lychery


THe holy man laarus said that after he had seeing in hell oon other pain
merweyllws. For he said that he saw oon other certain plays that Was of oon
great spays to the mayner of oon great cha^pagny the qwych Was full of vellys great

Wellys that var merweyllws deyp full of fire and byrnston and did cast oon
horrybyl stynkand smok. The deypnes of the said Wellys did cum et respond to
the Well of the myddys qwych is the great gouffer et Well of hell in the qwych
lucyfer is their logyt and shaynyt. Et With in the said deypnes ar the saowllys
of the cursyt lycherows men and Women The qwych ar right sharply byrnt et

peteabyl the Wepyngys shutyngys et they are so horrybyls et dreydabyl that their
no man lyua^t that may exprym them. Et shoold no man merweyl if the said
saowllys castys great pla^tys et sorows. For the said dewyll Hasmodeus and his
conpany strenes them to dyscend of the said les Wells Wn to the deypnes of the
great Weel and spot in the qwych is sucyfer in the form et maynayr of oon blak

abhomynabyl to see is tail Was large and long et sharp al full of sharp
nedyllyes. Et Werytabel the mo^styr and beyst of hell is right horrybyl et Was
hong above oon brandon of yrn byrnant Wnder the qwych Was oon great quantyte of
colys inbrasyt and lyghtnyt by dylygens right besyly With oon multytud
innomberabyl of dewyllys the qwych blawys With oon thousand bellowys for to

multytud of dewyllys abowe him et of damnyt saowllys that With pain any might /
nombyr them or beleyff that the World might comprehend no resayf i^ yt so

hell lucyfer is bownd be all the ionttys of thy menbrys With shanyes of yrn al
i^brasyt of feyr / right great and merweyllows / With faculte that he may torn

above the said colys of hell he hangerys et cursys him self so by ire that he
turnyes him vyolently of oon syd above the other. Et castys be great ire is
hondys horrybyls abowe the said saowllys qwych tumbys et fallys of all the
partys of hell above him et taykys the said saowllys qwych is so dystressyt With
his said handys so is qwo Would press oon grap of Weriws sych vays that yt is
lyk that the said saowllys ar al anychylyt. Soon after he sobys et blawys so
horrybyl that he scalys the said saowllys in the syndry parties of the fire of
hell. Et this doing he goys forth of the Weyl and gouffyr of hell oon great low
right stynka^t and horrybyl fowl of the said saowllys the qwych castyes oon
great et horrybyl Wepynges Et qwen the said best dewyl et prens of hell drawys
his eynd and spreyt to him he drawys With in his horrybyl mowth the said
saowllys the qwych he had so scateryt as said is the qwych did fall With the
smok et byrnstoon byrnant With in the said detestabyl Waam i^ the qwych they
varlyk to be dyed et swellyt. Bot soon after he did cast them forth of the fosse
of the said hell i^ the qwych they sufferyt Wnthoolerabyl paynys. Et all the
saowllys the qwych mayewayd and show that they be not taykyn ettwys the handys
of the said lucyfer ar smyttyng et scurgyt With the tail of this horrybyl said
lucyfer. Et be thyr Ways qwen yt is inferryt et ghewyn pain et tourmens all the
creaturys i^fernals he is / smyttyng rostyt torm^t above the other dewylys For
about the said lucifer there is oon great plant of dewyllys blac as colys qwych

lycherows men et Women that are damnyt the qwych cryys shuttyes horrybyl to

much horrybyl serpens the qwych rywys the inwart parties of their Waam so as

Wellyes ar drawyn sowdanly the said da^nyt saowllys sayand to them Cursyt

Wnfaylant their is noman mortel qwych may suffyciently say no rehers. Quheyr
for ewy rych oon crystyn man and Woman shoold dreyd et dowt that he fall not in

playsans that is oon great fowlyshnes to bynd them self in pain et tomens the
qwych newyr shall have eynd. Et for this that sum ar so Wnfaythful that they
dyspys as fablys et lesyngys et doys bot lac and makys of them qwych rehersys
so as they of things that are faynyt as lesyngys. Of dremys of melencolykys and
beleyffys not that their is oon hell or if they bleyff et yff they confess yt
vyth mowth. Always they denyyt be Werk. For they dowt not to live in their
synnys Wnto the deeth qwych is oon cler demonstans that they have not certain
faith of the paynys of hell. Thought yt be so that sant gregoyr in the.iiij. of
his dyalogues as not maid no dyffyculte to beleyff this and as put et left the^
be Wryt to their successurs. Et to thyp cause I shall allege syndry auctorytes of
the holy Wryt confermatywys et approbatywys of this that said is of the said
payny of hell For yt is Wryttyn by sa^t toon the euangelyst in the appocalypsys
in the.x. cheptur qweyr he says of the said Well et spot of hell that the Weel of
the deepnes of hell thayr is cu^ oon smok to the maynayr of oon great furnays et
that the thryd party of the men as beyn kyllyt crusyt tormentyt / of the fire /
smok et byrnston qwych cu^mys of the said spot i^fernal. Et be the said thryd
party is Wnderstondyt the ewyl damnyt qwych shoold be tormentyt in the
ewyrlestand fire of hell De puteo abissi fumus fornacis magne et occisa pars
tercia hominum. Certanly so says sant gregoyr e shall have deeth vyth out deeth
falt With out dyffault. Erit miseris damnatis mors sine morte defectus sine
defectu quia mors ibi semper insipit and deficere defectus nescit By e seur
that he qwych preparys to oon man oon fair bed soft et most goodlyast grathyt
the qwych We can not et may not exstym no dewys et that they say to him yt is
ghanant to the to lym the said bed that thou part not of the said bed this.xx.
ear / for thing of the vorld he Would nytly. O helas how may the man Wolupt wows
that is ghewyn to his charnalytys et fleshly lust may be laid in hell by oon
towsand of earrys et mor / he shall have for his bed serpe^tys et heddars for
his coweryng abhomynabyl Woormys and for his bed the fire of hell. Quhat
folyshnes is this to bynd et oblyge his saowl so presyows for oon small
dylectacyon off syn to oon ewyrlestand pain of the qwych yt may newyr cum forth
/ in the qwych pain the fire shall newyr be slokyn. Et the Woormys et serpens
qwych rongys bettys et ryffys the saowl shall newyrdy as that yt is Wryttyn
esaye in the last cheptur. Vermes eorum non mouetur et ignis eorum non
extinguetur. Et for to shaw by fygur the bytternes of the horrybyl damnacyon et
of the eieccyon in hell of the said damnyt says saint Ioon appocalyps in
the.xviij. cheptur he saw oon angel qwych lestyt on hye oon stoon as oon
mylstoon et did cast yt inpetwosly in the sea saya^t that the co^fusyon of
synnars shoold be so castyn in hell on the day of the judgment general. Sustulit
angelus lapidem molarem grandem et proiecit in mare dicens hoc i^petuose
mittetur babillon in i^fernu^. Hell is maid to the maynayr of the hows of
dedalues callyt laborinthues i^ the qwych he entryt eythly bot after that newyr
mor they may cum forth after the Word of esaye.xxiiij. cheptur qweyr he says
that the damnyt shall be assemblyt in the layk et deyp of hell in the qwych they

that the serpens et beystys de-Worabyls shall ronge and ryff the shaamful partys
of lycherows me^ et Women be the qwych they have synnyt et offencyt god as yt
apperys promply by this that is Wryttyn in the book of sapyens qwayr yt is said
that oon ewyrych synnar shall be punyshyt by the menbrys by the qwych they have
synnyt. Per que peccat quis per hec et torquetur. Et this suffycys to the.vij.
et last pain et the.viij. party of this present trayctye

The.ix. cheptur shall traytte in general of syndry paynys of hell.
THe medytacyon et thought of the paynys abowe said shoold be cause sufficyant to
oon ewyrych crystyn man et Women to Weyr ageyns the dewyl of hell and to resyst
to his temptacyons For if the man co^syderys veyl et that he be owercu^myt of
the dewyl he shall be led and drawyng by the might of the dewyl i^ the pains of
hell above said. He shall effors him to resyst to the te^ptacyons et do so mooch
that he be not owercummyt So We reed of sant anthony that after that the dewyl
had te^pyt him of any syn he said to him dewyl of hell if I did the syn that
thou tempys me I shall fall in the fire of hell et in ewyrlestand damnacyon With
the this the qwych I shoold above al thyngys show. Et so much go they Way for
the mind of the paynyes of hell may not permyt that I Would habandon me et
consent to do any syn. Soon after this answer the dewyl apperyt to him i^ the
form of oon small child mor or eutheopyen and he did cum and ly and prostern the
face ageyns the eerth before the feyt of the said friend of god. Sa^t anthony
co^fessant qwath he Was owercummyt. Et that thayr Was no thing in this that he
might mor ower cum the temptacyons of the dewyl lie than to bring to is mind
the said paynys of hell in the qwych the saowllys and the bodies of the damnyt
had dowbyl pain. That is to Wnderstond pain of dommayge. For they shall be
prywyst ewyrlestandly of the wysyon of the godly essens. Et shall have other
pains sensybyls of syndry and defferent maynars. For they shall be ewyr mor in
hell in sharpnes / betternes / of byrnyng / of the fire of hell / and crudelyte /
of cooldnes / and Wnmesurabyl / stynkyn / in obscuryte / dyrknes / of smok / in
horrybyl honger and in thryst qwych may not be slokyn / in stryf contynuel / in
detencyon and byndyng / of cheynees / Wnloyssabyl in byttyng / of serpens in
company / of dewyllys / in Wysyon horrybyl / of the said dewyllys / in hewynes
/ in imbecyllyte / in dreyd / in horrewr / and shaam / in sorrow / in showtyngys
/ in mowrnyng / trymblyng of the teyth / in dyscord / in hatrent / mennymyts /
in blasphemyngys / incompunctyons and ewyr mor / in bytternes / in obprobrys /
in confusyon / scruytud / in trystys / in desolacyon in myshop et small and
fynal obstynacyon. Et in others infynyt Wrechydnes et calamytes. The gloryows
sant gregoyrsay and of the crudelyte of the fire of hell says that hou may they
se that the fire of hell that yt byrnyes bodyly the repreywyt always yt is not
lythnyt by the study of man / no yt is not noryshyt no mai^tenyt of Wod Bot sen
yt is oon tym creyt yt byrnys ewyr mor With out slokynnyng and yt has no myster
to be lythnyt and yt is newyr With out byrnyng. Gehenne ignis cum sit corporeus
in se misses reprobos corporaliter exurat nec humano studio succenditur
neglige^s nutritur sed semel creatus durat inextinguibilis ne successione
indiget nec ardore caret. Et yt is to not that so as the damnyt et repreywyt as
synnyt in body and saowl in this World sych lyk they shall be tormentyt in the
said fire of hell to gydder so much in the faowl as in the body. Et the psalmyst
dauyd spekand to god the maykar of the punytyon and of the damnacyon of the
said Wrechyd da^nyt and reprewyt in the.xx. psalm says lord thou shall put the
damnyt in hell to the maynayt of oon furnays fulfyllyt of fire et this thou shall
do the day of thy vengens thou shall trowbyl them and fire shall swelly them.
Pones eos vt clibanum ignis et ea que sequntur. Certa^ly thayr to that the
prophet shawys clerly that the damnyt shall not byrn oonly owtwart of the fire
of hell. Bot With this they shall be tormentyt ewyr inwart he beyrrys Wytnees that
they shall byrn to the maynayr of oon fornays byrnant for to shaw ewyde^tly that
they shall be burnt of the said fire owtwart as to the body et tormentyt in the
thought in Wart of sorows and dolewrs. Et their to that they be mor sharppely
tormentyt they shall be sowdanly castyng of the said byrnyng i^ to the ice and
cooldnes Wnthollabyl as yt is prewyt heyr before. Et que fulgente rehersyes yt
in oon serment qweyr he says that their is two pryncypal tormens in hell that
is to say cooldnes Wnthoollerabyl. Et eyt that the may not be slokynt For to
grow the said paynys aftyr this that the said damnyt shall be in body et in saowl
in hell they shall feyl oon abhomynabyl stynkyn of the caryo^s of bodies of the^
da^nyt. For thayr sum tymys muk no fylth in the World or charyon so stynkand as
shall be the bodies of the said damnyt. O myserabyl synnars consider than qwath
stynkyng shall be in hell of the in numberabyl and neyr infynyt bodies of damnyt.
Of this stynkyng says ysaye i^ the.xxiiij cheptur qwen he says. De cadaueribus
^orum ascendit fetor Et for to eyk the said paynys the lycherows men et Women
qwych as beyn burnt in this World of fleshy desyrs shall suffyr justly paynys in
fire et in byrnstoon. For all et so maynay tymys that the stynkand delectacyon
of the flesh domynys in owr thought yt is Watyryt of fylth of byrnstoon. Etyes
the saowl dysposyt to this that yt shall be byrnt in hell in fire et byrstoon. Et
Werytabyly the said damnyt they shall not be oonly torme^tyt in the said fire
and byrnstoon bot With this shall fall upon them contynuelly for pain and tormens
afflyctywys ra^nys of fire and of byrnstoon coold sowdan tempes thues as the
psalm mist. Pluet super peccatores laqueos ignis sulphur et spiritus procellarum
pars calitis eoru^. Et certanly the Wrechyt synnars of this World perseuera^t
in their synnys so much that they are bownd in the cheynes of hell they shall fall
in the said pains for that they have beyn neglygens to purwoy them et that
Would not beleyf them. Et for that the said damnyt shall be craftyn in owtwart
dyrknes et shall be bownd the handys et the feyt of them qwich is Wryttyn in
sant mathow in the.xxij. Cheptur. Et in effec says the blyshyt pewpyl ar fyllyt
and refreshyt ewyrlestandly and blyshytly of the ewyrlestand breed that is of
the Wysyon of god. Of the self Ways ar the damnyt ewyrlestandly pryuyt of the
Wysyon of god that ye they die be honger by fawlt of the Wysyon of god almighty.
Et also deys the said damnyt pewpyl of thryst as yt apperys of the ewyl rych in
sant Luc in the.xvj. Cheptur qwych sessyt not to ash oon drop of Watyr by the
spays of.v. thousand earys and yt may not have yt. Bot he mowrnys cryys et
showtys and Wepys With the other damnyt and fremys With his teeth by Woydnes of
sorrow qwych is Wryttyn in the gospel. Ibi erit fletus et stridor dentium. Et in
sant Luc in the.vj. Cheptur is Wryttyn. Maledyccyon and cursyng fall above you
rych men and mighty of this World qwych as yowr playsans and yowr consolacyon
heyr in this World for e shall Weyp in hell. Ve vobis diuitibus qui habetis
consolationem vestram / quia plorabitis et flebitis vos. yt is also Wryttyn in
ysay in the.lxv. cheptur that the prophet in the parson of god says to the
damnyt. Sey heyr my seruans shall eyt and e shall have honger. My seruans shall
drynk et e shall have thryst. My seruans shall be reiosyst in gloyr and e shall be
confondyt in paynys / my seruans shall low by glednes of pacyens et e shall cry
in hell by doleur of heart and mowrn by dysplaysans of thought. Ecce serui mei
comedunt et vos esurietis et ea que sequntur. The above said damnyt shall be
fyllyt of al fylth and of dreyd and sorowfulnes. For so as says holy anselmus.
Ewyrych oon of them shall be full of fylth et mor full than any charyon or fylth et
mor deformyt than monstyr of the World. For so as the blyshyt shynys as the
soon of contrary the damnyt shall stynk as mook or charyon that is rottyng. The
bodis of the said da^nyt shall be so ewy as that says sant anselmus that for the
ewynes of pains the qwych shall fall above them that they may not move no hand
no fout no any other party of their bodies. Et shall that said body be oon great
sharge euy and importabyl to the saowl damnyt the qwych may not leyf yt be any
Wys. Self Ways oon ewyrych oon damnyt shall be so bestyab that they may not tayk
away from their propyr eyn the Wormys serpens qwych byttys them et shalscurg
them so as says holy anselmus. Says also that the bodies of them that are
damnyt shall be so seyk and Wnsekyr that medecyn may not holp the^ Et that the
above said damnyt shall be so ordaynt in oon great and full seruytud / for they
shall be holdyn seruantly as ewy et Wekyt seruans. They shall be full of ire by that
Woodnes of al cruel bestys and deworabyls ewyr mor be trowbyllyt by Woodnes and
impacyens after the Word above said of the psalmyst. Dominus in ira sua
conturbabit eos. Et to the cause of the above said perturbacyon their shall
proceyd merweyllows blasphemyng of god et of the santys cursant them. Et in
effect they Wald ryf With good Will by ire and they might their thongys et the
membrys of their bodies. Et they have oon ire indycybyl ettwys them ageyns god
and his iustys cursa^t him of this that he delyurye not them of paynet tormens
of hell. They have hatre^t to them self for the hatrent et sorrow of their live
they desyr the deeth after this as yt is Wryttyn in the appocalipsys in the.ix.
cheptur. They shall chers and they shall not find yt bot they shall fle from them.
Indiebus illis querant homines mortem et non inuenie^t Et With out dyffault if
oon manor oon Woman had all the reawmys of the World he Would gheue them thayr to
that they might die. Et for so much ashys sant augustyn in oon sermon qweyr for
is that the deyd is desyryt in hell et may not be fund. Certanly yt is for that
that so much as the da^nyt War in this World god offryt them the ewyrlestand
live that is to say paradys et they Would not tayk yt. Than yt is right and
rayson that qwen they are dyscendyt in hell in the qwych they desyr the deyd that
yt be denyet to them. Et Wndowtably their is oon merweyllows hatrent in hell of
the syd et party of almighty jesus owr rede^ptur and of his santys the qwych
shall hayt and bayttys the damnyt for their synnys by sych maynayr that they
Would not holp them in any Ways no have compassyon of their paynys. For the
father shall not have pitye no co^passyo^ of the soon no the chylderyn of the
fathers et mothers. The said damnyt as says sa^t anselmus shall be in oongret
discord so that their body and their saowl may not accord to gydder. For the
body shall hayt the saowl for this that yt as beyn ewyl pa^syt et the saowl shall
hayt the body for thyes that yt aes fulfyllyt be Werk the thyngys by yt
mysdoyng by the qwych they are intorme^t togydder. Et the chylder shall pleyne of
their pare^s so as yt is Wryt tyn in the ecclesyastyk the.xli. cheptur for this
they have not techyt them the thyngys necessayrs to their awn saowllys et that
they have not chastyt the^ qwen they have fayllyt et trespassyt / selfways that
they have not forbyddyng^st restranyt them to do ewyl / and that they have not
monyst them et techyt them the thyngys qwych ar reqwyryd et proffytabyl to
gowein them. De part impio co^querentur f^^ij. Et the parens shall plane of
their chyldryn say and that they have laboryt intoght for the^. E^ if they have
gaderyt synd^y thyngyes thef tufty the qwych they have not restoryt. Et self
Ways they have not doing no almows of the thyngys ewyl taykyn by them the qwych
has not maid resty tucyon of the qwych they have sparyt the said thi^gys to
their said chyldryn. In the qwych synnys grewously the okerers and auarycyows
of this World the qwych by fault of makyn restytucyon of the thyngys ewyltaykyn
they go they their Wyffys their chyldryn posteryte et lynayge / to ewyrlestand
damnacyon if they posses Wyttansy the said goodyes so ewyl taykyn the qwych
shoold be restoryt. Et of this We have oon exampyl that the saowl of oon holy
man deuot Was rauyst et led by oon good angel in hell for to se the pains of
them that are da^nyt. Et saw the said a^gel o man the qwych lay obreyd i^ the
deyp spot of hell. Et out of the Waam of him cum oon great tremerweyllows hye the
said trehud maynay bra^chys fulfyllyt of small bur Ions in the qwych Was hangyt
damnyt saowllys of men et of Women. Et of the said plays of deyp hell Waes laid
he of the qwych Waam procedyt the said tree / com oon great low of fire horrybyl
of the qwych Was torme^tyt the said saowllys the qwych hang i^ the said
bra^chys. Et than the said saowl al dredant ashyt at the good angel qwath might
yt be and for qwath cause they War hangyt oon the said tree et in the branchys of
yt so crewsly torme^tyt. To the qwych the angel answeryt that he qwych lies in
the deyp of hell is the father and the first beginning of al the^ qwych hyngys
in the said branchys. Et he has being other tymys powyr bot he is maid rych by
his okers auarycyowes nes et theftys qwych as not maid restytucyon of the thing
ewyl acqwyryd self Wayees that fynaly he is so deyd and as to this cause he is
eerdyd in hell. Says also the said angel that they that are hyngant in the said
bra^chys War the hoyrs of the said vsurier the qwych haes possessyt Wyttanly
the said gooddys also Wnryghtwsly acqwyryd be the said Wsuryer. Et as this cause
they et al them qwych dys^endys of him the qwych holdys Wyttanly the said
gooddyes ewyl acquyryd shall be so da^nyt in the deypnes of hell as they that
hyngys. In the qwych yt apperys clerly that the Wsuryers rapynewrs and theyffys
of this World shoold dreyd the iustys of god et that they shoold not dam the^
for their chyldryn of the qwych they shall have no consolatyon in hell bot al
reprewyngys et desolacyon. Et certantly there my considera^t that the damnyt
may not be holpyt by prayers no by almows ne be suffragees / ne penna^s With
out they War doyn by them or by their frendys lyuant in this World no they may
not be exaltyt in their propyr parso^s this qwych is clear ewydent of the ewyl
rich the qwich may not have yt oon gowt of Watyr says in this mayner spekant to
the said damnyt. Qwych shall be he that shall have meyrcy of the or qwath is he
that Will or shall mowrn for the or do pennans for the or qwych shall pray for thy
pays and rest. As he Would say no man shall do for the / for they leyf their
pain. Quis miseribitur tui aut quis contristabitur propter te / aut quis ibit
ad roganduin pro pace iua. For in hell thayr is no redempcyon / ne any small
co^solacyon. Et so as says sant anselmus et other doctures catholykies that all the good dys et all the ewyllys of this present World may not twoch the lest
degree of their parfeccyon that they may not be had et possessyt or mor or les
so as yt apperys of all the Wertus and of all the Wyses. Et certantly We may not
hawe joy in this present World With out trystesse With out consolacyon no
parfyt heelt With out seyknes ne the gooddys of the World may not be acqwyryd
With out labowr possessit With out toght no left With out sorrow no the self
Wayees ewillyes of thies World With out presens to them contrary. The qwych is
in the hewyn no in hell / for in hewyn ar al gooddys in all the degres of
parfectyon. Et in hell ar all the ewyllys With out any degree or permyxtyon of any
contrary qwych may cause consolacyon. For the said ewyllys and paynys they are
maid in their last degree of al consummacyon so much that they may no mor grow.
For their is perfyt sorrow parfyt byrnyng parfyt caoldnes parfyt fylth parfyt
Wayknes parfyt desolacyon parfyt Wrechydnes stynkyng and powyrte so as that
says sant gregoyr that the damnyt can not thynk other thing bot to their pain
in the qwych they are and is al their cogytacyo^ and thought is to sorrow that
they suffyr. For that says baruth the prophet in the thryd cheptur that the
da^nyt ar deyd in ewyl sorows. Mortui sunt in doloribus pessimis. In the said
Wepyngys for to notyfy the dyuersyte of paynys et ewylnes for to denot the
crudelyte and the rygh austeryte of them. Et thayt to that ewyrych oon crestyn
man may eythly ymagyn the above said crudelyte sant anselmus in the book of
symylytudys puttys oon sych exampyl qwych is long to rehers and for cuus of
shortness I pas ower. Et consyderant of the pains of hell oon seyk man has sum
rest. Bot the damnyt as seyknes mortel With out deyng and With out rest. Et yt
be so that in hell after the day of judgment abydys the qualyte contrayres to
the elemens al / wayees they shall not have their accyons myxyt et temporyt as
they have now for this that they shall not have no tempore^es no effec oon above
oon other for the byrnyng of the fire shall not eyt the caldnes of the Watyr et
of contrary the humydyte of the hayr shall not temper the drynes of the fire no
maykles the euynes et grauyte of the earth. Et of this is Wryttyn in the book of
sapyens in the.xvi. cheptur the snaw shall fusteyn Wertu of the fysret yt shall
not fail. Nix et glacies sustinebunt vim ignis et non tabesce^t Certanly the
damnyt shall susteynet suffyr all the pains above said by the owtwart creatures
by this that all the creaturys shall punysh the damnyt after the day of the great
judgment general by infynyt Ways and mayners. For the lecter and the exystens
of all the thyngys of the qwych man vsys malycyowsly in this World shall be
conseruyt in sowm of the elymens for to punysh et torment the said damnyt thayr
to that the Wryt may be Weryfyet by the qwych yt is said in the book of sapie^s
in the.xj. cheptur that ewyrych oon damnyt shall be tormentyt by the thing by the
qwych they have synnyt. The paynys above said to thynk they are horrybyl / to
speyk they are dredabyl bot helaes they are right grewo^s to susteyn. The rayson
for this that the said pains ar ewyrlestand. Et Werytably the dolewr and the
affection of them that are damnyt is not momentayr / ymagynatyue / or
transsytoyr bot yt is sensybyl ferm contynuel et ewyrlestand For the body of
them that are damnyt shall byrn in ewyrlestand fire and they may not be Wayftyt /
so as We se that the saowl raysonnabyl lyuant / the body may suffer sorrow and
yt may not die. Of the self Ways shall yt be of the body of them that are damnyt
the qwych shall suffyr ewyrlestand paynys and shall live ewyr mor thayr to that
the deeth lyuys ewyr mor in hell in pain of the qwych the live as beyn deeth in
this World by cul^. Certanly the holy man Job put Weel this deeth ewyrlestand
of the and of the saowl before the eyn of is thought qwen he said to god. Dimitte
me vt plangam paululum dolorem meum antequam vadam. Lord god let me pla^e the
sorrow of my syn before that I part of this World the sorrow of owr synqwen the
retrybucyon et pain of hell is by Ws prowydyt With oon great dreyd kepant Ws from
syn. Et ewyrych oon man shoold keyp him Weel dylygently also much as he may
that he partyt not of this Woorld With bwt he do pennans for and he dyscend in
hell of them that are damnyt he shall newyr mor retowrn as yt is Wryttyn in the
book of sapyens. Non est agnitus qui sit reuersus ab inferis. Et for that says
Weel job before that I go / for i^dowtably for he qwych shall be neglygent of
Weeping et mowrni^g of his synnye i^ this Woorld shall go straight in hell / as
the dectwr the qwych the credytur says / pay yt that thou awys otherwies I shall
mayk the be put in prison bot thou pay yt that thou aw. It is so of synnars the
qwych dyscendys in the chartyr and preson of hell bot if they pay by pennans yt
that they are bownd to god. For they shall dyscend in dyrknes and horrybyl paynys
of hell. Et yt is to notyfy that their is iiij. mayner of pains in hell two
corporells et two spyrytwellys. First their shall be in hell great dyrknes and
materyalles for the dyrknes of the plays for the thyknes of their hayr and the
pryuacyon of the light of the soon / et of ych oon other light. For the fire of
hell shall gheue no shynyng bot smook dyrknes / and stynkyng. How Weyl that yt be
that the fire natwrel as in yt byrnyng and clarie always the fire of hell
holdys in yt self the byrnyng bot yt as no propyrte of light. Thought yt be
thayr to that yt torme^tys mor the damnyt yt holdys in yt sum clerte of dyrknes
thayr to that the damnyt may so With in the said fire for to mot greyf their
pain and they With the qwych they have offendyt god. Segundly their shall be in
hell oon other dyrknes causys of produytys of the fylth and of the bodies of them
that are damnyt mor blak than swet or colyes the qwych shall gheue and cause of
them self oon other dyrknes horrybyls and abhomynabyls. The thryd dyrknes that
shall be in hell oon other dyrknes spyrytwell and mwart. For the damnyt shall be
blyndyt and prywyst With in of al light of Wnderstandyng and of al congnoyssans
bot oonly of the congnoyssans by the qwych they shall feyl and se the pains of
hell and the tormens qwych shall torment them ewyrlestandly. The.iiij. dyrknes
that shall be in hell is War and mor sorrowful than al others that is to say to be
partyt of the presens of the most hye et incomprehensybyl clarte and vysyon of
god. Et thought yt be so that in hell their is no ordyr of pain sorrowful
afflectyue after as says the holy man job. Vbi nullus ordo. For that as yt is
said their is Wnmyxtyon and confusyon of paynys et of tormens. Always their is
ordyr of the iustys of god almighty the qwych ordyr reqwyrys that ewyrych oon
culp be punyshyt and that ewyr as mor offencyt shoold be mor punyshyt after
this aes yt is Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the xviij. or in the deuteronomye
in the.xxv. Cheptur. Quantu^ glorificauit se in deliciis tantum date ei
tormentum et luctum. Et iuxta quantitatem de licti erit et plagarum modus. Et
Werytably after the dysparyte and dyfferens of the synnys their shall be in hell
dyuersyte of tormens and of pains so as yt is shawyn before. For as says sant
gregoyr thought yt be that fire of hell be oon and commun to all the damnyt
always yt shall not byrn the bodies of them damnyt egaly. For they shall suffer
et feyl the byrnyng of the said fire infernal after their demeryttys crymys et
synnys and qwych is mor synnyt shall be mor torme^tyt after the ordyr of iustys
of god. Their shall the damnyt have great horreur to se et to be ewyrlestandly in
the company of the dewyllys the qwyche shall cum above the^ With right horrybyl
fygurys Inestymably after this that yt is Wryttyn in job in the.xx. Cheptur.
Vadent et venient super eum horribiles. Et indowtably oon ewyrych damnyt shall
have horreur of his propyr fylth in the consyderacyon of his Wykyt and
abhomynabyl statur. Et so be yt that the said ar ower prydful alwayees they
shall have horrewr to se them self et to be hold them. Thought yt be they may not
so much do bot they so them self no behold the qwych shall cause them oon sych
confusyon that they Would newyr be boorn if yt Warpossybyl. Qwath is he that as
no dreyd to be byrnt ewyrlestandly wythowt any cessyng With out dei^g no
anychylyt to thool et susteyn dyrknes and smookkys ryth blak et obscur With out
any seeing qwath clarte is yt to feyl the abhomymabyls stynkyns of their propyr
body et of the bodies of others damnyt and for to be tormentyt of the dewyllys
and With them to se their horrybyl fygurs and to find no consolacyon no conseyl
/ and newyr to have no hop to ewayd no to be delyweryt For to be ewyr mor
owercummyt With sorowys plantys cryengis showtyngys of dewyllys and cursyt
damnet pewpyl. Certanly their is no man so assewryt bot he shoold dreyd and
dowt to fall in the said myserabyl calymytes. Et that shoold not contempyl qwath
pain is to thool the above said paynys et tormens et to be exclusyt and partyt
of the joy of god et to be partyt of the bleshyt company of angels and santys
of paradys. Et Wndowtably they et them qwych puttys in their mind the thyngys
the quych We have heyr before Wryttyng of the pains of hell they shall ewayd
eythly deydly syn and shall have dreyd of god be for their eyn be the quych they
shall show al vice and do pe^na^s of their synnys by them doyeng et fynaly they
shall show the said paynys of hell and shall have joy and beatytwd ewyrlesta^dly.
Et of contrary the damnyt shall have ewyr mor fire i^ the ewyrlesta^d pains of
hell the qwych fire of hell aes to the eyt and the byrnyng their is great and
merweyllows dyfferens With the fire materyel of this World the qwych is not
byrna^t to the regard of the fire of hell qwych is payntyt in oon Wall i^ the
regard of the fire materyal of this World. Et certanly if their War any man
strenyt to hold his finger oon howr in the fire materyal he shoold be grettumly
twrme^tyt in body et in saowl ewyrlestandly in the said fire of hell in the
qwych the paynys newyr shall have eynd. For yt is impossybyl to pas oon thing
infynyt no to find the eynd so as says Arestotyl in the segund book of
generacyon et corrupcyon. Et indowttably and yt var so that god said to the
da^nyt saowllys I Will do to you this grays that all the sand that is in the
World be gaderyt in oon ill that ewyr i^ oon thousand ear i^ oon thousand ear
and not ofter their cum oon byrd et tayk oon cwrn Et aftyr this that the said
ill be taykyn et leftyt I Will and ordayn that e be sawyt. The said saowllys Would
thank god et say god be blyshyt of is gyftys for owr pain thought yt be so that
yt be right long alwayees yt shall have eynd how Weyl yt is ghana^t to Ws to
suffyr paynys by syndry thowsa^d of earrys hell as yt shall not be so as said is
for newyr the saowllys damnyt may not have any hop of redempcyon / et this
suffycys as to the.ix. party.

The.x. cheptur et party of this present and short traycte shall traycte of the
paynys of purgatory.


IN the.x. et last party of this present traytte after this that We have
determynyt of the horrybyl paynys of hell. Ve shall traytte in this party of the
paynys of the bitter fire of purgatoyr. Et before that We dysce^d in the
partyculyer and specyal determynacyon of them yt is to notyfy if yt War so that
god had reweyllyt that of all the menlywand in this World that they shoold be
bot oon damnyt ychoon anens him self should dreyd that yt shoold not be he the
qwyche by the sentens of the iustys of god shoold be damnyt So that qwen the
rede^ptur of the World said the day of is seyn to is appoystyls oon of you shall
sell me and deliver me to the iowys they did begin to say et have dreyd lord is
yt I / the qwych shall do sych oon trayson. By mor raysson if the salwyowr of
the World said in is gospel in saint Mathow in the xxij. cheptur that syndry ar
callyt et for to have salwacyon et beatytwd et that newyr the les thayr is few
that are choysyn et sawyt / ewyrych oon should dreid Weyl that he be not of them
qwych shall be da^nyt and reprewyt abyd and the paynys of hell above said. Et
that syndry men et v^men ar callyt to the faith of god to hawe salwacyon et
that they be damnyt and few sawyt yt ^^erys be oon fygur of the ald testament.
For We reyd inge^^sy in the.vj. cheptur that god the makar for the synnys et
lycherys of men and Women send is judgment et deluge general in the ^wych al
creatures rayston ^^byls War peryshyt and deyt Wnto the nombyr of.viij. parsons
the qwyche War sawyt in the arch of nowel. Et so as the viij. said parsons War
les of the thyngys i^ the regard to the multytwd of the parso^s qwych Was
peryshyt and lost. Sychways few pewpyl shoold be sawyt in the arch that is in
the faith of the church i^ the regard to the damnyt that goys to pardycyon so
as nombyr infynyt after the Word of the ecclesyastyk in the first cheptur
qweyr he says that the no^byr of fowllys that is to say of da^nyt the qwyche ar
folys ar infynyt. This as beyn sych lyk fyguryt in the enter of the eerth of
promyssyon in the qwyche of all the chyldryn of ysrael the qwyche com of the
eerth of egypt from the aage of.xx. and above their entryt not bot two that is
to say Iosu^ et Caleph et all the other diet in the desert. In the qwych is
gheuyn to understood that few of men callyt by god the creatwr shall enter in
the eerth of promyssyon that ye in the eerth of the lywans of paradys this
apperys also in the now testament in Saint Eve in the.xviij. cheptur qweyryt is
Wryttyn that jesus christ haylyt.x. lyppyr men of the qwych they Was bot oon that
retowrnyt towart him for to thank and to low him. Et in the qwych yt is
oppynly gheuyn to Wnderstond that With pain the.x. party of men mendyt et
medycynyt be holy baptysyng shall retowrn in beatytud for to low and thank god
ewyrlestandly. Et that their is few sawyt yt apperys et yt may be eythly
Wnderstandyt by the live of men. For it is certain that the iowst oo^ly shall be
sawyt that Wytnysys the psalmyst qwen he says spek and of jesus christ owr
rede^ptur qwych is port of hewyn et that ryghtusmen shall enter in yt by faith
et dewocyon. Hec porta domini iusti i^ntrabunt in eam. Of the self ways yt is
Wryttyn in the first poystyl of saint Petyr in the.iiij. cheptur that the just
shall be sawyt vyth great pain et Dyffyculte qweyr may appeyr the men With out
pytye and the sinners. Et in effecal this is this day i^ the World their is bot
concupyscens of the flesch / or co^cupyscens of the eyn or pride of the live so
as says saint Ioon. Et al this apperys clearly and ewydently for the day in the
Woorld their is mor that Wsys of lychery than of chastety / thayr ye mor
prydful pewpyl than meyk pewpyl and mor Wrechyd pewpyl than meyrcyful et meyk
et thayr is mor trompewrs et lears than their is Werytabyl pewpyl so as says
the Psalmyst that the verytys of the soonnys of men ar maid les: Diminute sunt
veritates a filijs hominum. Qwheyr for ve may infer that the Weryte of the
soonnys of men that is the Word of the redemptur is Weryfyed qweyr he says
syndry ar callyt bot their is few choysyn to be sawyt. Et to this cause ewyrych
crystyn man shoold be dylygent so much as he is in this World to do good
Werykys et to have perfyt hop that he shall be of the no^byr of them that are
choysyn the qwyche may not be With out the parson have perfyt low and charity
in god lowa^d and obeya^t to him above al things and k^pa^t is co^mandyme^s
and also lowant is nyghtbowr as him self. Et if yt be by fragylyte of nature
that they fall in any syn We shoold recowyr to the sacrament of pe^nans inso
much that he as of good heelth et shoold not defer to the morowyng or to the
deeth so as Doys syndry. The qwyche puttys them self in oon greyt dangyer / for
as says the docturs yt is oon thing right diffycyl et hard that any mayk
faithful pennans that abydys Wnto the deeth. Et to this be rys Wytnes saint
Augustyn that pennans at the howr of deeth is right perylows thayr find We bot
oon in all the holy Wryt / that is to say the good thief / of al them qwych as
abydyng to do pe^nans to the eynd of thayr lywe qwyche is sawyt no the qwych as
doing faithful pe^na^s their god have Would have that their shoold be oon thayr
to that no man shoold disesper. For pe^nans is hool i^ the man hool and seyknes
and Wayknes in the Wnsekyr and deyd as in the man deeth. As to this cause says
saint augustyn et yt is rehersyt in the great dycret. That if any synnar be and
in the last necessyte of seyknes that is to say in the danger and peril of
deeth et he be and in sych oon peril et necessyte the said pouyr sinner Would
tayk or ash pe^nans and he in deyd taykys yt and sowdanly he deys of this
World. We shoold not deny him yt that he ashys bot We presum not that he dyis
Weyl I Wayt not says sant austyen if he passys of this vorld in sewrte We may
Weyl ghewe pennans bot We can not gheue seurte I say not that he shall be damnyt
et I say not that he shall be sawyt. Et for that says he / do pe^nanes qwyl thou
as thy health / if at thou doys so I promise the that thou art asseuryt For thou
as maid pennans in the tym that thou might have synnyt et offencyt god. Et if
thou Will abyd to do pennans qwe^ thou may syn no mor thy synnys leyffys the et
thou not the^ Et certa^ly if god seys i^ the inte^cyon and heart of the synnar
be and i^ seyknes and artykyl of the deeth if he trust yt to eshap and cu^ to
the heelth of is seyknes that he Would leyf i^ syn as before et in that inte^cyon
he has oon co^trycyon faynet et sumylyt et that he shryue him et maykys is te
stame^t and gheuys great almows and permyttys to mayk satysfacyon to them qwych
he has offendyt et that he ash the holy Wnxyo^ et call thesantys of hcwyn to is
holp. Et thought he do all the thyngys above said for this so this oonly he
beleyffys that he shoold die soon et be damnyt ewyrlestand. Et not for the love
of god bot for the hattrant et dysplaysans that he has of his syn bot With this
he as intencyo^ et he might have oon xx. ear mor ower that he should ewyr mor
parseueyr in his syn as said is. Vyth out any dyfyculte he shall be ewerleftandly
damnyt. For their is bot charity that is to say leyf to do ewyl for the lowf of
god et hatrent of the syn. Qwych may sayf man et not dreyd ferwyl. Et suppos
that the benyngnyte et clemens of god as largyt and for ghewyn the cowlp of him
qwych deserwys et abydys to do pe^na^s to the eynd of is live always he abydys
bownd to the themporel pain the qwych shall be satyffayt. Payt et maid be oongret
long spays of him in pugatoyr. Et the qwych pain he might have payt yt in oon
shoort and small espays of time if he had doyeng pennans in this Woorld in tym
he leua^t in his prospyryte et heelth. Et certanly the saowllys qwych deys of
this prysent live in grace et dyscendys in the fire of proctory shall not be
punyshyt for the great synnys bot With this for the Wenyal synnys. Et to this
ewyrych oon parson shoold do heyr pe^nans in so far as he is hool and punysh is
body et is menbrys by the qwych he as offe^cyt god he be and i^ good heelth et
mayk satyffaccyon to god in this World for his synnys / for if the man as lywyt
in dronknes and maid exces he should chasty is body by fasting and abstyne^s. Et
if he as beyn lycherous he should scurge and chasty is body and dyscyplyne his
body for to live chastely. Et if he as of fencyt god be clothyng that are ower
soft or be beddees ower soft We shoold Weyt the hayr cloth or sum other sharp
clothyng et ly sum tym above hard things Et if We have offencyt god by dancys
and placys that are Warldly We shoold go bayrfut to the church and yt War goodly
ar to satyffy to god in this World than in proctory / for so much We shoold
ash at god that he punysh We heyr in this World So said saint Augustyn to god
Lord god byrn me heyr With the fire of trybulacyon et ryeff me et cut my body
by seyknes thayr to that thou forgheue me my synnys et that thou co^dam me not
ewyrlesta^dly. For ^s says saint Gregoyr god for gheuys syndry i^ this Woorld
and sendys them no trybulacyon thayr to that he dam them ewyrlestandly. The
others he smyttys and punyshys in this vorld thayr to that he may forgheue them
ewyrlestandly and that he may not punysh them i^ hell no i^ purgatory / for the
thyngys presupposyt We shall say of them heyr after of the pain of purgatory the
qwyche ychoon shoold beleyf that the said pain is right sharp et mor
merweyllows tha^ ve can say. Et thought yt be so that sum herytikys vyl say that
their is no proctory et that qwen god forghewys the culp that he forgheuyes the
pain et that al man that deys of this World goys in paradys if yt be so that
the culp et the syn before gheuyn of god so as did the good theyf yt Was said
thou shall be With me to day in paradys qweyr he had dyscendyt in hell and the syn
had not beyn for ghewyng / so as did the ewyl rych qwych is beryed i^ hell.
Always ageyns sych herytykys thayr is oppyn rayson ageyns the^ With the
autoryte et faith of holy church et of holy docturs cotholykys et syndry
experyens and rewelacyo^s maid to syndry dewoyt et holy parsons so as yt shall be
declayryt fullyly heyr after. The rayson sych et yt is cleyr ewerych oon
confessys that al syn is not mortel so as ych seyknees is not mortel. Et
selfwys al offens maid ageyns owr nyghtbowr in oon thing publyk qwych is not
punyshyt of oon judge seculyer or eclesyastyk of the pain of deeth. Self Ways
if any crystyn deys of this World in the stayt of Wenyal syn conly yt is cleyr
that the iustys of god than shall not co^dam him to be punyshyt ewyrlestandly.
For they had no deydly synnys qwe^ they deyt it sollowys that their shall be oon
tym sayffyt et not damnyt. Or than he may not be sauyt not With out he be
purgyt of the said synnys Wenyels. Than yt is ghanant and neydful to say that
their is su^ plays in the other World i^ the qwych they shall be purgyt that is
to say proctory. Item and qwen any shryuys the^ of their ewy deydly synnys be
qwych they have doing or all the pain is put from them of necessyte sych Ways be
oon mayner of saying that god be stranget to put away and forgheue all the culp
and the pain to gydder to the qwych he is not streynget neydfully. Et if they
say that god is straynet to do that the qwych is oon thing falls and dayf and
that he Would do and beyr meykly after is confessyo^ Worthy and salutayr fruit
of pennans after the Word of sant ioon baptyst in sant luc / i^ the thryd
cheptur qweyr he says mayk Worthy fruit of pennans. Certanly this proffyttys.
Et if yt be so that god is not to this necessaryly stranget as he is not et
that the contrycyon of the parson War so great that yt var suffycyand for to put
a Way the cowlp and the oblygacyo^ of ewyrlestand pain oonly qwyche is
suffycyand and possybyl. Et that by is goodness he forgheue the cowlp et the
oblygacyon of the pain ewyrlestand oonly to the qwych the said parson by ye
deydly syn yt followys that the said parson abydys bownd to sum pain temporel /
et if the said parson decedys of this World how small that yt has payt and
fulfyllyt the said pain et pennans yt is neydful that yt be paid in oon other
World the said pain be yt not suffycyand payt. Et the said pain shall not be
ewyrlestand for the saowl shall not be dampnyt Wnderstondyt the remyssyo^ of the
cowlp tha^ the said pain shall be temporel et transytoyr et Worthy of purgacyon
in the other World namyt proctory in the qwych the saowllys ar purgyt et
clengyt of this qwych yt is bownd. Et the said pain is no other thing bot oon
sharp fire of proctory in the qwych the saowllys ar purgyt et clengyd et qweyr
they pay the remanant of their pains and pennans. Sant gregoyr in his dyalogue
says that yt is al oon seff fire i^ hell and i^ proctory as he says yt is oon
self fire qwych clengys the gold and qwych byrnys the strew. Et yt is ghana^t
to notyfy that proctory is ordaynt the lymbe of the holy fathers of the qwych
proctory com the saowllys before the passion of the rede^ptur after this that
they var sufycyently purgyt and clengyd they assendyt to the said lymb. Ve reyd
not that the good angels as punyshyt the saowllyes of good bot it var mor
ghana^t to the ewyl. Et thought yt be that the ewyl angels dewyllys of hell as no
intencyon to cleng the saowllys qwych is in proctory / bot to crucyfy them and
punysh them if they might aluayes after sant thomas the saowlys of proctory are not punyshyt be the dewyllys of the qwych they have had vyctoyr. For they may
not exers their malyes above the saowllyes of petory as they do abowe the s^ow
llys damnyt. Thought yt be so that the dewyllys presentys them right horrybyle
before the said saowllys of proctory for to mayk them sorrowful et for to cause
them mor great pain et afflyccyons for to se their pains bot the said saowllys
as of the contrary consolacyon of the good angels as yt shall be said heyr after.
That the saowllys that dyscendys in proctory ar punyshyt be oon merweyllows et
horrybyl fire yt apperys be auctorytys et pryncypally be the auctoryte of sant
pol appoystyl qwych says i^ the first poystyl qwych is vryttyn to the
coryntye^s i^ the.iij. cheptur. Vnius cuiusque opus quale sit probabit. That is
to say that the sharp fire of proctory shall preyf the operacyon of ewy rych man
qwat yt is. Says also the appoystil that the verk et the operacyon of ewyrych
man abydys to be byrnt be fire he shall suffyr grettumly bot he shall be sawyt et
purgyt be fire Si cuius opus arserit detrime^tum pacietur ipse aute^ saluus
erit sic tamen quasi per ignem Et of the qwych fire spekys sant augustyn qwen
he says. Purgandus est igne purgationis qui hic distulit frnctum co^uersionis.
He shall be purgyt in oon other of the sharp fire of proctory qwych as defferryt
in this World to towrn him self by pennans. Et certanly yt is owr faith that
for oon small pennans doing Wylfully in this World they may deliver of oon long
et great pe^nans that shall thool a long spays pe^nans in the fire of proctory.
Et he qwych defferrys et says that he is content to do his pennans in proctory
/ he is lyk to him qwych for oon halpenny the qwych he Will not pay grathly he
byndys him to pain oon hondreth. For the said pain of proctory is mor grewous a
oon ho^dreth thou sant myllyo^s tha^ yt of this present world. Helas syndry ar
in this World qwych consyders not the crudelyte et the bytternes of the pain of
the dreydabyl fire of proctory et for this cause they Will not absteyn them from
syn the qwych they are lyk oon blind man qwych passys be oon dangerows passages
be the qwych he dowrst not pas With out he saw yt cleyr. Their is others that
thynkys Weyl / bot as heretykys soonnys of the dewyl of hell forth of the Way of
salut they beleyf not for cause they are roytyt in their synnys et for that they
dreyd not the said fire lyk to them of sodom that vold not beleyf loath of the
dystrowyng of cite of sodo^ ne go forth With him the qwych dyscendyt al qwyk /
in hell body and saowl yt apperys in.xix. cheptur of genesys. Et yt is said
como^ly that oon fowl beleyf is not qwyl the tym that he ress^yff. Et their is
sum that dredys not the said fire of purgatoyr for that they have not
exspyryment of yt. Et they are lyk to the dog the qwych aes not beyn byrnt for
he dredys not the hot Water as he that as beyn byrnt. Et for that thayr to that
ych oon of us have perfyt faith et credens of the said fire We shall allege yt
that gloryows sant augustyn allegys and says in the great decret. De^pe.
distinctio.xxv. et.vij. capitu. Fi. Hic ignis et si eternus non sit et cetera
que sequuntur. That is to say thought yt be so that the sharp fire of purgatoyr
be not ewyrlestand always yt tormentys grettumly the saowl. For yt excedyes al
pain temporal that any may have sufert or suffrys in this woorld. No newyr moor
may be fund for to torment mannyes flech sych pain no so hard torme^s as the
pain of proctory. Thought yt be so that the holy martyrs as suffert merweyllows
paynys et tormens. Et of this abowe said bytternes et crudelyte We reyd oon
exampyl in the holy Wryt I put oon cas that oon saowl has beyn byrnt by the tym
et spays of.xxx. earrys With in the said fire of proctory and that their com
oon a^gel of god to the said saowl et say god as gheuyn the faculte that thou
be oon day heyr or that thou return to thy body in the quych thou shall pay the
rest of thy pain the qwych thou should do i^ this purgatoyr by the tym and spays
of oon day. Et for pennans thou shall live i^ the body oon hondreth ear. Et all the certh that thou shall go appon shall be full of great sharp naylys above the
qwych it is ghanant to the to go ewyr thayr apoon they shall pyers and hool thy
feet Wnto the boon. Et thou shall not eyt al thy live bot breyd baykyn ettwys
the aws and thou shall drynk gal myxyt With Wynagyr and thou shall not be cled
bot With oon camel skyn of hayret thou shall not sleyp no ly bot above the
eerth et for thy cod thou shall have oon sharp stoon under thy heyd
Indowttabyly the said saowl Would moor Wylfully cheys to retowrn in is body oon
hondreth ear and susteyn the pe^nans above said than to by oon hoyl day in the
fire of proctory. Et by this clearly it aperyes that no pain te^porel may be
maid conparayson to the said pain of proctory. Et for that said veyl the
gloryows sant augustyn qwen he said that the fire of this present vorld should
not be clepyt byrna^t no actyf i^ the regard of the fire of proctory qwych is
lyk to the fire of hell as to the crudelyte of yt et not to the duracyon / not
mor than the fire qwych is payntyt above oon Wall shoold be reputyt as to the
byrnant as to the regard of the fire materyal. Et for cause of the above said
crudelyte they that are i^ proctory thynkys oon moment right long. Et yt aperys
be oon exampyl of two relygyows me^ qwych lowyt oon other merueyllowes veyl and
faithfully in this World and seruyt god oon long spayes both to gydder
dewotyly. Fynaly oon of them two Was seyk wn to the deeth. Et he beant in his
seeknes their apperyt oon angel of god to him qwych said to him thou shall
decess of this World in short tym and thou shall go to proctory et thou shall
be their the spays that oon may say oon mes. Et also soon is the mes may be
said thou shall go forth of proctory et thou shall fle in ewyn i^ gloyr et
felycyte. This the said relygyows reweyllyt to is fallow peayant him that
incontinent that he War deyd that he would eynd and say the said mes and of this
he prayt him for charity et faythfulnes that they had oon to the other This the
other promyst him In the morning the above said relygyows dyscessyt et
i^co^tynent is fallow grathyt him to the mes et so said mes et these doyeng he
that Was dyscessyt apperyt to the other is fallow saya^t. O dysloyal and Wn
faithful fallow thou as deseruit veyl to be punyshyt and god should sent to the
su^ punyshon to have foret me so. The relygyows al full of dreyd said / to him
qweyr. For that I prayt the qwen I was lyuant that inco^tynent after my desces
that thou shoold reyd oon mes for me. Et thou art oon felon i^ humayn et cruel
fallow thou as lattyn me be tormentyt in the sharp fire of proctory by the
spays of.xx. earrys ne thou no noon of my other brethers as not said oon mes
for me. Et incontinent he that Was lyua^t said to him that vas dyscessyt I
promise the that they charyon Was not eerthdyd et incontyne^t that thou
dyscessyt I dysposyt me to say mes and I do yt bot endyd at thyes howr. Et
incontinent he that Was dyscessyt said to the lyua^t / if yt be so yt is
ghana^t to say that me thought the tym so long for the bytternes et the
crudelyte of the paynyes I thynk that I have suffert et tholyt torment mor
than.xx. earrys. Et than he that Was dyscessyt thankyt is follow et flew
gledsumly in hewyn. Et in the qwych cleyrfy yt apperys the folyshnes of the^
qwych desyrys to be in purgatory and the qwyche settys not by and they may cum
their to the qwych saint Angustyn. Nescit quid petat qui purgatoriu^ petit He
that desyrys to be in proctory be Wayt not qwhat he ashes For so as says the
above said saint Augustyn that the pain that oon saowl tholys in purgatory be
the tym that thou may oppyn thy eyn et clos them is mor great / mor sharp / et
mor grewous than the pain the qwych gloryows Saint Laurens suffryd and tholyt
above the brandon of yrn. We reyd of great Allert qwych chesyt to by.x. days in
purgatory and after this he apperyt to oon of his freyndys say and to him. O
thou my freynd how maynay thousand of earrys have I beyn byrnt in the sharp
fire of purgatory. The men shoold ash that god ^old deffend and keyp them from
the fire of hell / for With pain may be any so perfyt qwhat that ewyr they be of
/ for after the psalmyst their is non perfyt bot oonly god bot Wnder god et is
santtys their for We may say With pain yt is ghana^t that he be punyshyt by sum
days in the fire of purgatory

For this that before the saowl may fle in paradys yt is ghanant that yt be With
out any spot of syn and With out any fylth of syn so much deydly as Wenyally so
as yt Was at the howr of baptysyng that qwen he had resawyt the sacrament of
baptysyng. No yt may newyr se god bot first he be redwysyt to the sacrament of
baptysyng and to the cleennes et innocens of yt. Et alexander of hallys above
the cantykys in the.iiij. book et.xvj. cheptur says. Anima que cum macula
venialis culpe recedit ab ergasculo carnis transibit perigne^ purgatorij
purganda antequam co^spectui regies regum presentetur licet virtutum claritate
multa refulgeat. That is to say / that the saowl the qwych departys of the
prison of the body shall pas be the fire of purgatory for to be purgyt et
cleengyt be for that yt be presentyt in the presens of the king of king is
Thought yt be so that yt shynys of much great clarte of Wertus. Ve reyd in the
dyaloge of saint Gregoyr that Pascacyus cardynal lyuyt so dewoytly and holyly
et that after is dysces oon demonyal Was delyweryt of the might et possessyon
of the dewyl oonly for the twechyng of is grayf. Et alwayees after is deeth he
dyscendyt in purgatory. For that in the eleccyon of two papys he had faworyt
the oon mor than the other by errewr. How Weyl yt is possybyl to man to leyf in
this Woorld so parfytly and holyly that after is dysces he fleys al right in
hewyn so as yt apperys of the chylder innocens and of men qwyche as cummyt to
aage that as led so good live et so parfyt in this World. Sum may ash qwat ar
the saowllys that entrys in purgatory. Unto the qwych We answer that three
mayner of saowllys entrys and shall enter in purgatory. The first ar they
saowllys the qwyche oonly has had contrycyon of their synnys at the eynd qwen
they depart of this World Wythowt pe^na^s Wythowt satyffaccyon / selfwayes the
saowllys of them qwych ar shryuyng in their bodily heelth and dyis before that
they may have fulfyllyt their pennans. For the above said saowllys shall mayk
oon eynd to pay al their pennans in purgatory. The segund saowllys qwyche
dyscendys in purgatory ar the saowlys of them qwych as taykyn and ressawyt in
pennans in this Woorld of their synnys et fulfyllyt them bot the satysfaccyon
that as beyn gheuyng to them for their said synnys Was not suffycyant sych
mayneyr of saowlys shall mayk the remanent of their synnys in purgatory. Et
certa^ly the men ar fowlych that reffusys and Will not tayk no hard pennans in
this World. For yt is oon thing mor eysy to do et mayk satyffaccyon heyr in the
tym of grace than to abyd to mayk satyffaccyon in purgatory. The iij. mayneyr
of saowllys the qwyche dyscendys in purgatory ar they the qwyche berys With
them thayr Wenyal synnys. Qwehyr for yt is to notyfy that the small synnys
Wenyals the qwyche as not beyn put away in this Woorld they shall be grewously
punyshyt in purgatory for cause they have maid no pennans. For how little that
ewyr the syn be We most mayk pennans and satysfaccyon to the iustys of god in
this World or in purgatory qweyr the pain is right grewous and right sharp as
said is. For and thou be hool and thou sleyp by sweyrnes qwen thou eyrrys ryng
to the matyns or to the first mes and thou Wylt not go to the preshyng or to
the ewynsong vyth out lawful cause or if thou seys dans or loyp / or mayk any
plays / or if thou beholdyes the fair maid dyue veyl grathyt and anowrnyt or
that thou lawgh be lyghtnees or that thou pronons Wayn Woordys Wnproffytabyl
vyth plesans this shall be deydly syn. For oon ewyrych oon deydly syn not put
away i^n this World thou shall suffer mor pain in purgatory than saint Laurens
did in this World qwen he Was rostyt above the brandon of yrn. Grauius est esse
in purgatorio quamdiu oculus claudi and apperiri possit quam illa pena quam
sanctus laurentius sustinuit in craticula. Hec augustinus. Vereyd in the live
of the ancyens fathers of the ordyr of prescheurs that oon good brother after
is dysces apperyt to oon of is brether and said to him I am grettu^ly twrmentyt
in purgatory for this that I have dronk Wyn With out Wattyr thayr to I might
goodlyar sleep / bot pray god dewoytly for me that I may be delyueryt et if
thou doys yt beleyf that I shall cum soon forth of the said paynys. Et i^ the
self book ve reyd that oon good brother vas.vij. days in purgatory for this
that he had said sum fowlych Woordys for cause of creacyon: Et vndowtably their
is saowlys that are punyshyd be the spays of.xx. ear in purgatory / the others
be the spays of oon hondreth the otheres by the spays of oon thousand ear and
mor / et otheres by short tym for so much says Rychart of saint Vyctor. Alique
christianoru^ anime vsque ad finem mundi ad ignem purgatorij ex dei iusticia
sunt deputate. That is to say / that the saowllys of sum crysty^ men and Women
ar ordant et gheuyng to the fire of purgatory by the ordynans of the iwstys of
god Wn to the eynd of the World. Et Cesaryus in his dyaloge Wryttys of oon
saowl qwych vas conda^nyt to abyd i^ the fire of proctory two thousand ear /
bot by the suffragys et prayers of faithful and deuoyt crystyn pewpyl yt Was
delyueryt in two ear. Ve reyd also of oon Wyergy^ qwyche Was sister of the holy
martyrs faint Cosm et saint Damyen that for oon Wenyal syn of the qwych sho
Was co^tryt no shryuyng. That is to say / for cause sho hard at ewyn sum pewpyl
dans and sing in oon plays qweyr sho had sum little dylectacyon / that sho Was
ordant et co^damnyt.xviij. days to thool the fire of purgatory so as sho
reweyllyt after her deeth to oon holy man. This that ong mayddes and he and sho
qwych be ower greyt Wolupte and dylectacyons beholdys the dancys shoold Weyl
consider et notyfy this. Et this shoold not be lyk to them oon small thing to be
in purgatory oon small spays of tym. For as said is that their is no temporel
pain that may be maid comparayson to the said pain. So as the saowl of oon man
the qwyche Wa^ in the fire of purgatory reweyllyt and said to oon of is
freyndy^ to the qwyche by the playsyr et Will of god he apperyt for y^
correccyon et say and my pain is so greyt that if all the Woyd et all the hyllys
and af the thyngys Wysybyls of this World byrnyt and that I War in the myddys
of the fire I Wald not suffyr the hondreth part of the pain of yt that I
suffer. Et With out dyffyculte oon man shoold soonnar desyr to be.xxx. ear in
oon bed seyk of oon grewous seyknees than to byrn oonly oon howr i^ the fire of
proctory. Et of this We reyd in libeo de septe^plici timore / that thayr Was
oon synnar the qwyche god for to chastys him and to mend send him oon hard and
sharp seyknes so long Will he prayt daily to god that he Would put him forth of
this World. Et so as he maid often is prayer the angel of god apperyt to him et
said. God has send me towart the for to grant the thy ashyng cheys of two
thyngys the oon that thou be ij. days in purgatory or two ^eur in the seyknees
in the qwych thou art Et the said seyle man Was gleds^m and choysyt the deeth
and incontinent he dyit and is faowl Was led in purgatory and With in oon owr
the angel apperyt to him to the qwych he ashyt qwhat he Was and he answeryt I
am the angel of god the qwyche as led heyr thy saowl yt is not possybyl thou be
oon angel of god for the angels of god leys not for thou promysyt to me that I
shoold be heyr bot two days in purgatory et I have beyn heyr fyndry earrys. Et
the angel said to him / I promees the that thou aes not beyn heyr oon hoyl howr
Et sown the saowl said to him I pray the have me to the vorld for I am ready and
grathyt to thool all the seyknes by sych et so long tym qwyl yt pleys to god by
this that I towrn not in this pain so yt Was doyeng by the dysposycyon of god.
Et qwen he Was he did beyr al pacyently by two ear the seyknees that he Was in.
Et Was is pe^nans thankful to god the maykar. For qwen he dyscessyt he flew in
paradys Wythowt tho lyng of any other pain in purgatory. By this apperys that
ych oon shoold be pacyens in is seyknes and offer the said seyknes to god in
satyffaccyon of their synnys. For he that is impacyent he as dowbyl hell. The
first is the seyknes the qwyche hemwrmurys ageyns and the qwyche he berys yt
impacyently. The segund is hell ewyrlestand da^nacyon. Et if they ash at me qwat
spays of tym shoold they be punyshyt in purgatory after the iustys of god the
saowl of ewyrych oon crystyn man for the fatyffaccyon of the pain of oon deydly
syn the qwych he is shryuyn of the qwych he as not maid pe^nans in this World.
Ve answer that raysso^nabyl that oon ewyrych oon shoold be punyshyt i^ proctory
after the iustys of god for hies satysfaccyon for ewyrych oon deydly syn be so
maynay earrys as their is / thayr is days i^ un. ear. Et the raysson for after
the vetray iowst for ych oon deydly syn they should gheue and in iown pe^nans i^
this World.vij. ear so as yt is Wryttyn in the xxxij.q.ij. Hoc ipsum, Byt in
purgatory the ear shall be gheuyng for the day. Et as to this cause of this qwych
We may satysfy in oon day in this World yt is ghanant that We suffer in
proctory oon ear. For god says by the prophet Ezechyal in the iiij. cheptur to
them qwyche as tym of grace and of meyrcy and doys pe^nans in this World. Diem
pro anno dedi tibi. That is to say / that I shall gheue the i^ this present live
in the qwych is the tym of grace and of meyrcy oon oonly day of pennans for oon
ear the qwyche is ghanant to him to beyr shall be i^ the tym of iustys. Et this
is fyguryt of the chylder of ysrael the qwych War.xl. ear in the desers and did
abyd for their synnyes of the enter of the earth of promyssyon Et if they had
not offe^cyt god by mwrmuryng and dysobedyens they shoold have beyn entryt
in.xl. days. In the qwych yt apperys clearly that god punyshyt the said
chyldryn of ysrael oon oonly day by pennans et pain of oon ear. Et by this
clearly apperys that sum saowllys shall be be long tym and grewously punyshyt i^
proctory fee in ych oon ear ar.iij.C.lxv. days and in.vij. ear ar two
thousand.v. C. lv. days. Et be so maynay earryes after the faithful iustys of
god should be byrnt oon saowl in the sharp fire of proctory for oon deydly syn.
^ This co^syderys not they that are lycherows qwyche shoold be punyshyt so long
for oon deydly syn for oon short dylectacyon charnel of the qwych they have
doing and maid confession With pwrpos of satyffaccyon to mayk and to retowrn
not to their fyn With out fayneyng

Of the selfwayes dronkars prydful pewpyl / danse^ts / blasphemowrs / lears /
inwyous / yrows / sweyrnes and them that bresys the fastyngys and the holy days
co^mandyt of holy church Et also the others synnars shoold be dylygent et
consider dylygently this that said is by the foresaid dreyd et dowt that they
fall not in the said sharp fire of proctory. Et certanly no man shoold have
myshop for thing that We hawe said. For this shoold be Wnderstondyt of the
iustys of god almighty in the other World i^ the tym of iustys. Et so much is
We are in this World in the qwych is the tym of grays et of meyrcy god is right
meyrcyful. For be contrycyon erubescens et shaam that We have of owr syn
shryuant owr self in him by satyffaccyon that We do i^ this World by good
Weerlys by the trybwlacyons of scylenes et be the parsecusyons that We suffyr
in this World pacyently et Wylfully oon great party of the pain of proctory is
put away / et forgheuyn. Et for so much yt is oon great good to shryue them often.
For suppos that he that abydys to mayk is confession Wn to the eynd af is live
in the artykyl of the deeth may be sawyt if he repent him Weyl. Et Werytably
With out any fyccyon this the qwych is right hard as ve have said ^n the first
present traycte / always he shall have les joy in hewyn. For he qwych abydys to
do is pennans Wnto the artykyl of the deeth et he qwych has doing pennans et
seruyes to god by the spays of.xl or.l. ear a^ right Wnlyk and they deffer in
the meryt and in the fire as to this cause yt is Wryttyn in sant ioon i^
the.xiiij cheptur. In domo patris multe mansiones sunt. They may ash at me if
the saowffys that are in proctory as any consolacyons. Ve answer that they
have.iij. mayner of consolacyons. The first consolacyon that the saowllys that are i^ purgatoyr as / that the good a^gels Wysys and confortys the said saowllys
qwych ar in purgatory anoncys to them the suffragys the qwych is doyn for the^
by their parens / freyndys / and be others that lyuys in this World. The segund
consolacyon that the said saowllys of proctory as yt that they are certain to
have ewyrlestand beatytud. Et for that says sant thomas that the saowllys of
proctory holdys the myddy^ ettwy^ us the qwych ar i^ this World and of them
qwych ar bleshyd in hewyn they are certain of the ewyrfystand gloyr with out any
abydyng. Et in the World their is abydyng of bleshyng With dreyd. For man
lyuant in this World he is not certain if he be in the hatrent of god or in the
lowf of god or if he be sawyt or da^nyt. Et they that are in purgatory abydys
the meyrcy of god and the beatytwd of ewyrlestand gloyr of hewyn With sewrte
and they are certain that they shall not be damnyt in hell With the dewyllys / bot
they have Werray Wnderstondyng and Wnderstondys parfytly that they shall fle
parfytly in paradysso soon as they have payt their pennans. Et in this
presyde^t the saowllys of purgatory of me^ of this World be this that the said
saowllyes of purgatory ar certain of their salut aes said is and the said
certylud is to them oon great co^solacyon. The thryd consolacyon ye hop that the
said saowllys as is the suffragys of their frendys parens / and cousyns of
others dewoyt parsons of this World. Et of this We reyd oon exempyl of two
saowllys the qwych the oon Was in great paynye in purgatory and always yt had
great joy for that oon good angel reweyllit to it that that day Was boorn oon
thyld qwych shoold deliver if of the fire of purgatory be the orayson of the
said child the day that the o^g child shoold sing his first mes. Et the other
faowl Was sorrowful for this that yt had no specyal freynd that praytit maid any
suffragys for yt bot oonly had hop in the common suffragys the qwych ar doyeng
for all the saowlyes i^ general and in this tuk hop and consolacyon. Et
Werytably their is.iiij. thyngys that shoold cause Ws to holp the saowllys in
purgatory. The first is the bitter and sorrowful pain the qwych the said
saowllys thool lys in purgatory / for the said saowllys ar right merweyllowsly
in great pain as said is et in great powyrte and fawlt. The segund is for this
that the said saowllys ar Worthy that We thynk et that We holp them. For all
the said saowllys ar i^ the grace and charyty of god and hoyrs of the reawm of
hewyn and as to this cause they are worthy to have holp and that We holp them.
The.iij. is for this that holpand them We shoold have hop of the reward that
qwen the said saowllys ar delyueryt and that they shall be in paradys they shall
pray for We. This qwych may appeyr be exempyl. For if the soon of oon eerthly
king War banyshyt Wn to oon certain tym in the qwych he had fallt et neyd of
any thing and that their War su^ good parson that vold holp him in is neyd that
is in the tym of is necessyte and qwen he com i^ to his rewm he Would reward him
that as holpyt him in is neyd. Et yt is so that the saowllys of purgatory ar
sonnys and doghterys of god that as great fault of holp and of succowr. Et also
they that holpyes the^ shall be rewayrdyt qwen they are forth and fleyng in
paradys. The.iiij. raysson that shoold monys us to pray for the saowllys of
purgatory is. Forth suffragys and gooddys doyn the qwych We do for them yt
proffyttyes to owr self and We send the said good dedys et suffragys be for as
messagyers before Ws grathand the Woy of owr saowllys. Et heyr may be maid oon
qwestyon that is to Wndersto^d if the suffragys the qwych ar doing in this
World for the saowllys of purgatory if they proffyt to him that doys them Ve
Answer after sant thomas in is.iiij. in the dystynecyon.xlv. that the Werk of
suffrage doing by any may be co^syderyt in two mayners. First after this that
said Werk is clengyng of the pain by him by the qwych yt is also as by the
mayner of reward or of su^ recompensyng. Et qwen to the Weyrk of the said
suffrage yt appertenys oonly to him by the qwych yt is doing. For yt absolys
him by the qwych yt is doing of all the paynawn by or of the party of yt. Et yt
absolys not him that doys the said Werk of the pain doing by him. Segundly the
said Werk of suffrage doyeng be any may be consyderyt insomych that yt is
merytoyr of live ewyrlesta^d if yt be doing in clarte and that yt proceyd of
the root of charity. Et as / to this Werk of suffrage yt profyttys not oonly
for him by qwych yt is doing / bot proffyttys mor to him that doys yt after the
say of the psalmyst. Oracie mea in sinu meo conuertetur. That is to say. My
orayson the qwych I do for the saowllys of purgatory shall retowrn in my bosum
and shall proffyt to me for to have ewyrlestand live. Et sant Ioon damascene
says that qwat ewyr he be that traweyllys him for the salut and proffyt of
their nyghtbowr first to him self et after to his nyghtbowr. Et if they ash be
qwat suffragys et Ways may ve holp the saowllys of proctory. Ve answe^ that all the good Werkys and operacyo^s the qwych ar maid for the said sharp fire of
purgatory profyttys bot I find pryncypally in the Wryt and prechyng of holy
docturs.xv. thyngys by the qwych conmonly We holp to the said saowllys of
purgatory. First ve holp them and bryngys them holp With ca^deles that are
lyghtnyt in the ho^neur of god thayr to that jesus christ that is Werray light
lyghtna^t al parso^ lyua^t i^ this World deliver the^ and put them forth of
dyrknes of the said purgatory and lyghtnyng them of his ewyrlestand light. Et
i^ this sing ve gheue the byrnant candel in the hand of him qwych yes to go to
deyd and qwych vyl die thayr to that the pacye^t and al is frendys at is deeth
desyrys that jesus christ owr salwyowr and owr rede^ptur the qwych as suffert
deeth and passion for Ws qwych is light of the world Would lyghtnyng the saowl
be the Way of dyrknes and mysknowyng by the qwych yt shoold go throw. Et
selfwayes they put Wylfully about the beyr and body of him that is deyd.iiij.
candellyes byrna^s thayr to that god for gheue to the deyd this that they have
ofe^cyt god be thought by Word / by Werk / and be obmyssyon. And also qwen the
preyst says mes of the requiem he prays.vj. tymys in the mes that the
ewyrlesta^d light may be gheuyng to them. Segundly they ghewe confort and hop
to the saowllys of purgatory qwen the encens is lyghtnyt et boorn by the church
in suffrage of them that are descessyt. For be this ve desyr that the saowl may
be delyueryt of al stynkyng of purgatory qwayr yt is i^ the horrybyl stynkand
fire and so as the smok of the ence^s ascendys i^ hye sych lyk owr deWucyon
shoold ascend in hye that is in hewyn after the Word of the spalmyst.
Dirigatur domine oracio mea sicut incensum i^ conspectu tuo. The thryd hop that
We holp to the saowllys of purgatory is castyng holy Waryt abowe the bonys and
grawys of them that are descescyt. Et this doyeng shoold the parson dewotyly
dyssyst so as the byrnyng of the materyal fire as slokynnyt be Watyr materyal /
sych lyk the byrnyng of the fire of purgatory may be temporyt to the saowllys
be the moyen of the dew of hewyn of grays / and of meyrcy. The.iiij. mayner
they qwych ar in the fire of purgatory ar holpyt qwen We offer at the mes breyd
and Wyn for them that god Would fyl them and refrech the said saowllys of
purgatory and gheue them drynk of is beatytwd and gloryows Wysyon and put them
forth of the necessyte that they are in This mayner they are holpyt qwen We mayk
prayers et oraysons for them so as We do for them that are holdyn in prison the
qwych may not be delyweryt be thayr prayers bot be the prayers solycytacyons
and requestys of others their purens and freyndys. Et Werrayly ar delyweryt the
said saowllys be the oraysons of good men et of chyldryn qwych ar yt in the
stayt of innocens For With out dyfyculte sych prayers proffytys gretu^ly to the
saowllys. This apperys by this present exempyl. Vereyd of oon bishop right
deuoyt qwych saw in his slepyng oon child above the board of oon Weel of the
fire of purgatory and oon Wand of silver in the qwych hand oon cruk of gold et
so as this said child did cast is Wand in the said Weel he drow oon saowl of
oon right fair Women after that he had drawyng her the said saowl flew in hewyn
/ and the said child did drow syndry others. In the moornyng after that the
said bishop Was awayknyt he saw the said child in the church ard abowe oon
grayf the qwych maid to god orayso^ right dewoytly. To the qwych the said
bishop ashyd qwhat he did above the said grayf. Et he answeryt / that he said
is Paternoster and Miserere meideus. For the saowl of is mother. Et be this
Wnderstud the holy man that the saowl of the said Women Was delyueryt of
purgatory be the prayer of the said child. Et yt is ghanant to Wnderstond that
the Wand et the cruk of gold Was the Pater noster. Of the said child and the
cord of silver is to be Wnderstondyt the Miserere mei deus. The.vj. maynayr the
saowllys of purgatory is holpyt be the oblacyons of their freyndys thayr to
that the said saowllys may be assoylet et qwyt of the dettyes the qwych the ar
bownd ane^s god.

The.vij. mayner they may souccur the saowllys of purgatory in reqwyrant and
prayant the sanctys of paradys qwych makys intercessyon to god for the saowllys
of purgatory. Et certanly the said santtys ar the freyndys and messangyers of
god the qwych We send to the king of hewyn thayr to that he forghewe the
saowllys for the qwych We reqwyr the^. Et to this cause ve shoold dewoyttyly
reqwyr the gloryowes vyergyn mary / the gloryows santtys ioon baptyst / and
ioon ewa^gelyst / and the gloryows appoystyls holy saint Petyr / et holy sant
pol / et holy sant thomas gloryows martyrs / sant thomas / sant denis / sant
sebastyen and sa^t anthoyn / sant stewyn Et the gloryows confessurs sant
nycolas / sant benoyst / sant martyn. Et the gloryows Wyergyns sant kateryn
sant barbara et sant clare. Et generaly all the other sanctys of paradyes that
they mayk prayer to god for the delywerans of the said soawllys. For their
prayers they shall be eythly delyweryt. The.viij mayner by the qwych We may holp
to the saowllys of proctory is be fastyngys afflyccyons and knellyngys and
prosternacyons doyn in this World for the said saowl his of proctory Et
Wndowtally so that We se that oon membyr is sum brokyn and hurt thayr to that
the other behoyllyt et that yt return to conuales^^^ or so as We se oftymys
that ^^lat ws bleed of oon member thayr to that the other may be holyt. Sychlyk
they that are ly^a^t may mayk satyffacyon for them that are deyd if they fulfill
parfytly pennans that Was ghewyng to them qwen they lyuyt Et also yt is
alwayees that the pennans et satyffacyones is porcyonnet to the culp of them
qwych ar dyscessyt. Et that they that doys and fulfyllys that they be i^ the
stayt of grays For so much yt is Wryttyn.xiij q.ii.c. Animo ieiunia
viuentiu^sunt auxilia deffunctorum. That is to say that the fastyngys of them
lyuant ar the holp of the^ that are dyssessyt. The.ix mayner by the qwych We may
holp them that are in proctory that is that We pay Weyk lawfully the dettys of
them that are dyscessyt. We reed i^ the book of propyrtes of bey^ of honny that
thayr Was oon nobyl man the qwych apperyt after his dysces to oon of is
seruyteurs the qwych Was right deuoyt and Was the said nobyl man bownd With
chei^es of yrn byrnant merweyllowsly be the feet and by the ha^dyes. and said
to the said servant that if his Wyff Wald pay al thies that he awght to oon
powyr smyth qwych he namyt hi^ and yt shoold profyt much for the dylyuera^s of
is painys. and this hard by yes Wife so clepit the said smyth and co^tyt. With
him of al i^ the quych yr housba^d Waes bund et payt him of is said labowres Et
the night followant the said man nobyl apperyt in the form qwych follows. The
said howsband Was set in oon bath full of fire on to the throt bund With dyrnant
cheynes of yrn be all the body. Et said to the said Womanlows me et sown sho
losyt from the to eynd to the other. Et this doing her howsbant thankyt her et
said I Was so bownd first in the pain of proctory Wn to this tym that thou as
payt al my dettes et this in the qwych I Was bownd to the said smyth / bot now
I am qwyt et assoylyt of the said pain off proctory and I go in paradys by thy
good dylyge^s. Et in this clearly apperys that yt is great danger to hold the
fee of powyr labowrers et iornay men. Quia dignus est operarius mercebe sua.
The.x. mayner by the qwych We may holp the saowllys that are in the sharp fire
of proctory is for to fulfill the Werkys of meyrcy bodyly and spyrytwelly
notyshant the powyr famylyer / gheuant drynk to them that as thryst ^lethyng
the power that are nakyt Wysyand the prysonners / berya^d the bodies of them that are deyd consylla^d the^ that are will co^seyllytet chastyant the mysdoars /
confort them that are dysconfortyt supportant the noysumnes of others /
forgheuant their ennemys praya^d god for them that are qwyk et deyd. The.xj.
mayner be the qwych the saowllys of proctory is payant the testamens et last
Will of them that are deyd so as they have ordaynyt. Et that this be the shonest
that they may With out delay / for be delayng the execucyons of the said
testamenes the powyr saowllys of the said te^taturs ar sum tym mor tormentyt in
the said fire of proctory The.xij. mayner by the qwych We may holp to the said
saow^lys of proctory yes qwen any fu^fyllyes the pennans for them the qwych as
beyn ghewyng i^ this Woorld to them before the bysses of thy parson. Et certanly
this shall be to them and is proffytabyl thayr to that the said saowllys may have
les to pay in the said proctory. Et yt y^ heyr ghanant to notify that.ii^
thi^gys ar reqwyryd before that the satyffacyon and pennans that any doys for
the saowllys of proctory beyn to him proffytabyl. First that this be auctorite
of co^fessur. Segundly that the parsons for the qwych We mayk satysfacyon may
not fulfill them self the pennans the qwych they Would do for them self so as is
the saowllis of proctory the qwych ar forth of the plays in the qwych they
might do pennans and beyn bleshyt of meryt. The thryd manner the said pennans is
maid in grace that is to say With out deydly syn. Et for so much if any that
Would die et that he had co^mytyd and ghewyn is penna^s and satysfacyon yt shoold
profyt to him much that he qwych takys the said pennans and that he did mayk yt
lightly he should be mor sown delyweryt of the pains of proctory. The.xiij.
mayner that the saowllys of proctory may be delyweryt et holp yt be Ws is qwen
We pay and fulfill their Wowes the qwych they have trespass yt Woe want them in
their lywing the qwych they have delayt to pay thought yt be that they Would have
fulfyllyt them and that they have had contrycyon and shrynyng them at the eynd
of their live. Et certanly yt yes oon fowlych thing and peryllows to Wow to god
or to is santtys the thing that We Will not et to pay them not this that they
have promysyt them. Sa^ccius est non viuere quam votum proposse non
perficere.xij.q.i. The.xiiij mayner that We may holp to the saowllys of
proctory is qwen any forghewys the said saowllys of proctory the iniurys et
mysdedys that they have done to them they beant in this World present. Et
prayand god that he Would forgheue them the said sins and al other and he Would
allege them of their pain. The.xv. mayner by the qwych We may holp the saowllys
of proctory is qwen any syngys or says messes for them. Et this mayner yes the
grettast and the most Pryncypal suffrayge Be the qwych We may mayk les the pain
of the said saowllys. and of this We reeyd oon exampyl in the live of the
fathers of the brether presheures that oon holy father pryor pryncypal of the
order in the holy eerth / meyk / gracyows et denoyt Was oon tym in the church
qweyr he maid is orayson right dewotylyrso as he leftyt his sight tow art the
lamp of the qweyr he saw oon shadow so as yt Was oon brother Relygyows The
qwych Was in oon dyrk habyt right blak and Wncleyn to the qwych he ashyt qwath
yt Was. Et he answeryt I am sych oon brother the qwych is not long ago sen I
Was deyd and in my lywyng I lowyt the With oon speculatyf lowyng. Et soon the
holy father ashyt how he Was and inqwath estayt. Et he answeryt right ewyl. For
I am i^ oon horrybyl pain and fire in the qwych I shoold be thyes.xv. ear Et
the holy father ashit qweyr for he shoold be punyshyt so long et that he had
lyuyt so ferwently so relygyowsly and deuotyly Et the saowl answeryt / ash me
not sych qwestyo^s for after the judgment of god qwych is right ewyn I
dysseruyt Weyl to thoyl the pain to the qwych I am bownd. Bot I pray the holp
me by thy prayers and suffrages. This the qwych the holy father promyst to do
to him. For so sown as the day Was cummyt the said holy father offryt to god
the holy sacryfys of the awter for the said saowl. Et so as the said man did
hold the sacryt body of christ etwys is hand is after the first elewacyon he
maid is prayer for the said saowl Wsant of thyr Wordys or lyk. My ford jesus
christ if the sowldan qwych is king of payans had oon prysonner in his presons
and that oon of is frendys chamberlayn qwych as seruyt him faithfully be the
spays of.xx. ear and he ashyt the said prysonneyr for is reward of al is seruys
that he Would gheue him the body of the said prysonneyr. The said sowldayn Would
not deny yt Wyllfully. My sawyowr et redemptur jesus in the qwych al meyrcy et
goodness abondys pleysyt the by thy bleshyt passion to remember the of thy pytye

pleysyt thy goodly goodness for to gheue me hi^ for my reward. Et after this
that he had said^ ^epit yt mor no oon tym no two tymys With great effusyon of

the saowl answeryt I am the saowl of thy brother of relygyo^ the qwych apperys
heyr / the holy father ashyt how yt Was With him / the saowl answeryt I am
delyueryt of the sharp pain of proctory et now I go in hewyn qweyr I shall pray
god for the. Et this the saowl partyt / and the said holy man thankyt et ghewe
lowenges to god. We reyd also of oon nobyl man at the eynd of his days send is
soon towart the payp qwych Was his systerys soon thayr to if yt pleassyt him to
pray god for him. Et the said soon co^ to the payp abowe.xij. howrrys after
that is father Was descessyt The payp qwych Waes oon man deuoyt and of holy
live put him in orayson and said oon mes for the saowl of is onkyl et eym. Et
after the said mes the saowl of his said onkyl apperyt / and Saynad to him that
after the ordynans of the iustys of god that he shoold be.xxx. ear in the sharp
fire of proctory / bot be the oblacyon and by suffrayge of the said mes oonly
yt Was holyly and Wythowt any delay yt Was delyweryt of the said pains of
proctory and incontinent said by thy holy prayer and mes I go to the joy of
paradys. And be thyr.ij. exampyls abowe said that the holy sacryment of the
awter and the doing of the messes is the pryncypal and sowerayn swffraycte be
the qwych We may holp the saowllys of the sharp and vnthoollabyl fire of
proctory Bot they may mayk heyr oon qwestyon / if oon mes of requie^ proffytys
mot to the dylyuerans than oon other mes. To this qwestyo^. We answer after
sant thomas in is.iiij. that in the offys thayr is not oonly sacryfys / bot
With this their is certain oraysons. Et for this the fuffrayge of the mes
contenys thyr two thyngys. That is to say oraysons er sacryfys. Say We than
qwen yt is of the party of the sacryfys afferys the mes yt proffytys egaly to
the saowllys of proctory of qwych sant that ewyt yt be said of and is the said
sacryfys the pryncypal thing qwych byys in the mes. Bot qwen yt is of the party
of the oraysons of the requiem proffytys mor to the said saowllys of proctory
than oon other mes for the oraysons determynys of this in the said mes of the
requyem. Arwayes qwo Would do or say oon other mes of any other sant the
deffault of the said oraysons so appropryet for them that dyscessyt may be
supplyet et recompensyt by the great dewocyon of him that causys to say or be
the intercessyon of the sant of the qwych they ash the suffragees and of qwych
the mees is said Et yt may be ashyt also if We shoold do mes for the o^g
chyldryn the qwych dyscessys of this World. Sant thomas answerys that We say
the suffrages of the mes for the o^g chyldryn baptysyt not for that the said
suffrages proffytys to the remyssyon of any culp or to the augmentacyon of
gloyr bot for others raysons that is to say for the consolacyons of the lyuans
et for to shaw that they ong chyloryn appartenys et ar of union of bodies
mistykye of jesus christ / membrys et sonnys of the church this qwych apperys
qwen any kepys lyk form et maynayr as to te grawyng et erthyng of ong chyldryn
innoce^s as they do to the eerthi^g of ald men i^ aage. Et the thryd mayner for
to recommand and bring to mind the mysteyr of owr redempcyon the qwych is
remembryt in the sacryment of aw^er. Et be the qwych meryt of the redempcyon et
passion of owr sawyowr and redemptur jesus christ the fayd ong chyldryn innocens
abtenys salut ewyrlesta^d With out tholiyng of any pain of proctory et not be
their propyr meryt. Et always yt is to notyfy after master petyr palud above
the.iiij. of his sentences if they say mes for the said ong chyldryn shoold be
maid and said for all them that are dyscessyt et shoold the said oblacyons et
oraysons be reportyt to al the^ that are deyd qwych abydyes the meyrcy of god in
the fire of proctory. Sant thomas answerys that bydyng that the suffrayges the
qwych We do specyaly that the suffrage that We do for any is of Wertu synyt
shall be addressyt et ghewyn by the intencyon of him qwych doys yt or to qwoom yt
pleas him et for that yt shall prowffyt to him for the qwych is yt may / as to
the delyueea^s and the dymynucyon of the pain mor tha^ yt doys to otheres. Bot
qwen congratulacyon and inwart unsolacyon after this that the snowyl qwych is
in charity in graceys ioyn ws of the gooddyes of other. Et in thy^ the
suffrages doyn be any for any saowl proffytys to all the faowllys of proctory
and mor to the^ qwych ar i^ charity. Et be thies apperyes that qwe^ any causys
to be doyn any suffrages for the saowl / of is father / or of is mother / or of
is nerest freyndys as cousyns or others all the saowllys of proctory ar gledsum.
Bot We shall ash heyr that is to say if the suffragys doyn be oon ewyl man if
they proffyt to the saowllys i^ proctory. We answer that the suffrayges may be
maid be oon ewyl man in two mayners. First the suffrayges prayers oraysons may
be maid be oon ewyl man so as be oon mynyster publyk of the church and of god
so as oon preyst qwych doys mes in the seruys of the^ that are deyd in the
church Et Wnfaylant of oonsych mynystyr proffytys to them that are deyd.
Segundly the prayers orayso^s suffragees may be maid for the^ that are deyd by
oone will man of is peopyr mowyng and sych prayers proffytys not to the saowllys
of proctory. For yt is Wryttyn. Peccati^ inuolutis pro alijs or are non potest
i. q. i. fertar. Et alwayees if oon ewyl man ordaynt in stayt of deydly syn
ghewe almows to oon powyr parson the qwych is in the stayt of grace et that the
said powyr man in the Way of the said almows War excyt to pray god for the
saowl of him for the qwych the said almows Was ghewyn be the said synnar
indowtably the said almows shall proffyt to the said saowl. Et yt is ghanant to
notyfy that the suffrages ar doyen by the commandment of him qwych is lyuant
in charity as of him qwych yes descessyt in the stayt of grace / sych
swffrayges proffytys to the saowl qwath estayt that ewyr he be he that doys
them. Et if the said suffragys be doyn be the commandyment of sum qwych yes not
i^ the stayt of grace quych comma^dyes that they do the bot yt is at the howr
that they do them be and in the stayt of grace. Self Ways if any be in grace
at the pwr that they command or orbon that they do sum suffrages proffytys so
that they tayk thankful the commandment that they hawe doyn or commandyt of
new he beant in the stayt of grace. et self Ways if any be in the stayt of
grace at the howr that they command or ordayn them that they do any swffraygys
suppos that they be not qwen they do yt sych suffrayges shall proffyt to the
saowllys of them that are decessyt. Et after the sentens of rychart in is.iiij.
in the distynccyon. xiv. in the.iiij. artykyl et segu^d qwestyon how Weyl that
sum be in charity qwen he sendys sum suffrayges to be doyn et that he ressayf
the fruyttys of the said suffrayges shall not be so merytabyl as if yt War doyn
by oon mynyster be and in grace et in charity / for and if War so sych
suffrayges shoold be me rytabyls of both the partys. That is to say of the syd
of him that causys yt to be doyn et of the syd of the executur. Et now We have
to se oon qwestyo^ that is to say of qwath man pleynes the saowllys that are
holdyn in the fire of proctory I find that they said soawllys planes of.iiij.
mayner of pewpyl. The first of the^ that they have ghenyng any benyfyrys in
this World. Certanly the said saowllys complenys of their ingratytwd of this
that they gheue them not other benefycys spyrytwels bot they foret tham of al.
Et in their parson says the psalmyst. Obliuioni datus sum ta^quam mortuus a
cord. Et certanly yt is oon great Wnthankfulnes and ageyns rayson to foret
thayr gooddoars With out that they do them any grace. Or yt is so that We may
not otherwys thank the saowllys of the^ that ardescessyt of the benyficys the
qwich they have ghewyn to Ws bot be the prayers the qwych We do or cause to be
done for the^ forthys cause ych oon shoold do dylygens to pray for them.
Segu^dly they plenay of their hoyrys the qwych possesses et boldys their
herytayges the qwych they have conqweryt and the qwyche ar reqwyryd With
labowrs always they thynk not of the^. So as their is syndry soonnys and
dotheres sister soo^nys cowsyns and others qwych possessys the gooddys of their
for bears and byys gownys and horse et byggys great howsys and that spendys the
said gooddys in pride and other synnys in lycherys pallardyses in bankys and in
other thyngys superflews. Self Ways doys the Wedows qwych marys them
incontinent that forettys the saowllys of their howsbans that are deyd. Et
generaly al them that holdyes the said good dys of them that are deyd the qwych
ar bowndyn to holp to them that are deyd of the qwych they have the gooddys. Et
if they do not the said saowllys playnes of them sayand this that is Wryttyn in
job in the xx. Cheptur. Quare me persequiminisicut deus et carnibus meis
saturamini. That is to say. Qwayr for parsecut e Ws as god and fyllys ow of owr
flesh gooddys / substans / With out that e have any pyty of Ws. Theyreyly the
said saowllys planes of their executurs the qwych expedys not lightly their
testamens and pays not their dettes that they have left bot defferryes them to
pay their dettes from day to day the qwych is ageyns charity and faythfulnes.
For after sant thomas the saowllys in so much ar frustryt of the holp the qwych
We shoold mayk them. That is of the allegens of the pain that they shoold have
if the said testament had beyn qwyttyt in tym. Et certanly they qwych dyssauys
the^ that are decessyt in the excucyon of their testamens offenses grewously god
et ar oftymys grewously punyshyt not oonly in this Woorld bot in oon other. Of
this We reyd oon exampyl of oon of the knyghtys of charles the great the qwych
sea^d be him that he shoold enter in the feyld ageyns hies e^nemyes prayt oon
of is cowsyns if that he dessessyt in the said batayl that he Would sell is horse
et ghewe the silver to the powyr pewpil It happyn nyt that he decessyt in the
said batayl et for cause the said horse Was fair the said cowsyn did hold yt Oon
small tym after the said saowl of him that Was decessyt appeyryt cleyr et shynyt
is the soon before the fayes of hyes cowsyn qwych has holdyn the said horse
sayand. Of als traytur and Wnfaythful cowsyn thou has cawsyt me to be tormentyt
in the sharp fire of proctory be the spays of.viij. days for this that thou as
not ghewyn the silver of my horse so as I ordaynyt the. Et certanly thou shall
not eshayp With out punyshon. For by the ordynans of the iustys of god the
dewyllys shall beyr the day thy saowl in hell. Et I go clengyt et purgyt of syn
in the gloyr and felycyte ewyrlestand. Et sowdanly in the air Was hard oon cry
as lions / of beyrrys and of Wolffys the qwych tuk the trayttur executur and
did beyr him sowdanly the qwych sensyn Was newyt seyn. Et this shoold gheue
dreyd to trayturs and to ewyl executurs the qwych holdys the gooddys of the
powyr deyd pewpyl the qwych fulfyllys not their testame^s et their ordyna^s. Et
of sych executurs qwych dessauys the saowllys of them that are decessyt says the
decret. Debita suffragia promortuus non rede^tes fures su^t sacrylegij et
excommunicandi. xij. q. ij. That is to say that he qwych ghewys not the
suffrages to them that are deyd ar theyffys sacrylegys and Worthy to be
ewyrlesta^dly cursyt and Worthy of ewyrlesta^d da^nacio^ The iiij. mayner they
that ardecessyt pla^es of relygyows and of me^ of church / et also of the powyr
pewpyl the qwych is recew is the almus of the said deyd pewpyl. Et always they
pray not for them so faithfully as they shoold. Self Wayees they plane of them
that as benefyces / chapelles / prebendes / et qwych possessys in their abbays
the gooddys of them that are dessessyt approypryit to the said abbayes the qwych
prays not god so deuotyly as they shoold for the saowllys of them qwych as
resawyt the gooddys of them. For all parsons that lywys of almows shoold be mor
dewoyt et mor contynuel in oraysons than other parsons for this that they
shoold not oonly pray for them self bot With this f^e the qwyk and the deyd for
the almowes qwych they are sustenyt Et this is Wryttyn in the decret. x. n. i.
Et certanly no parson qwych may leyf of is labewr, shool^ not leyf of almows.
For the powyr seyk et Wayk pewpylet p^wyr presonneres the qwych may not labowr
shoold propyrly resayf the awlmows et for the^ or for others / et not they that are stark et dely weryt and may labowr. Impoten tibus ad laborandum tantummodo
danda est elemosina. xxx q. i. Et of them qwych resawyes the almows et pray not
faithfully so as they shoold for the saowllys of them qwych they have ressauyt
the said almowes We reyd oon sych exampyl in the dyaloge of cesarus. That oon
powyr pilgrim dyssessyt and be gheue is gown to oon preyst et commendyt is
saowl to him. The qwych gown the said preyst tuk dylygently and did beyr yt in
his hows. Et so as syndry do as to day qweyr of yt is pyty after that he had
the said clethyng and he thought no mor of the said saowl of the pilgrim. Soon
after the preyst Was nouys in the ordyr of cyteaws. Et he be and oon day in the
dortur qweyr he did sleyp he Was ra^yst in the pains of hell qweyr he saw the
dewyll the qwych did cast ^^^t cryenges plantys et mowrnyngys and hol^a^t the
s^yd gowns playa^t yt and fowl of pyk dydlyt yt and With the said gown co^ and
^ower^t et smyt the nek of the said preyst the qwych did awayk cryant horrybyly
holp me. And sown com syndry of the relygyows the qwych led et toknyt him of
the toknyn of the cors. To the qwych he said sey heyr I die I am bowrnt. Et so
as they co^neyr him for to se in qwath stayt he Was they saw et fand that is
heyd Was byrnt. Et brought him half deyd in the enfermery in the qwych he com
after in heelth and did pennanes of is neglygens pray and dewotyly for the
saowllis the qwych Was to him recommandyd et above al for the saowl of the
pilgrym. Et certanly ych oon for their power and might shoold holp the said
saowllys of proctory / for that syndry dyis that as no parens no frendys in the
World qwych may holp them no pray for them / as to this cause ar the said
saowllys gretumly holdyn in the said pains. Et this apperys be exampyl of oon
saowl the qwych apperyt to oon holy father of relygyon sayand to him that he
Was co^damnyt in the said pains of proctory Wnto the day of judgment With that
yt War holpyt by the prayers of holy and dewot men. We reyd also in oon sermon
that sum saowllys has beyn in the sharp fire of proctory in the said paynys
from the tym of Jesus christ Wn to oon thousand ear after for fawlt of freyndys
cousyns or parens qwych as doyn no holpyt With any suffrayges prayers for to
deliver them of the said paynees Et yt may be that su^ saowllys ar yt sen the
tym of owr rede^tur jesus christ as said is in great pains trybulacyons and
tormens and shall be Wnto the day of judgment for this that in this World qwen
they lyuyt as not acqwyryd any freyndys qwych as doing no doys prayers
suffrayges to god for to soucowr them et holp them of their dowlewrs et said
paynys. Qweyr for We shoold so much as We are in thyes World acqweyr the prayers
et suffrayges of the church and of holy and deuoyt parsons thayr to that be
thayr ordyson and prayers after owr days that We be dysc^ssyt of this World
god the maybrar gheue Ws is grace et have pyty of owr saowllys et gheue Ws is
meyrcy so that We may ewayd the paynys if that yt be so that We be ordynyt be
iustys of god be any tym to be in the said paynys of purgatory. Et this
suffycys for the.x. et last party of this present short and little traycte. Et
pray and et reqwyrand all the ^^yddas et all the eyrrars that yt pleassyt them
reyddant and eyrrand sum tymys this that I have said heyr before in the said
little et short traycte said and translatyt et Wryttyn of the inenarrabyls et
horrybyls paynys of hell et of purgatory. if their be any thing qwych is not so
dewly translatyt and vryttyn that may reqwyr vold supply to my small et little
Wnderstondyng and pleys them to say god have meyrcy of the saowl of the
interpretwr / translator et actor / et of their fathers / mothers / parens et
freyndys. Et god by is grace keyp et deffend them of the said paynys of hell and
purgatory / et gheue the^ ewyrlestand blysh by samoht not nywel. Amen.

Heyr endysh the traytte of the paynys of hell et of purgatory. Et the beginning
of the traytte of the cu^myng of antecryst.


Before that We trayt te of the ioys of paradys holpa^d owr lord We have
inte^cyon to traycte of all the thyngys the qwych may mones man to dreyd god and
low^ et consequently to die Weyl. E^ first We shall traycty et say o^ the cu^myng
of antecryst / et o^ is birth / et qwen he shall leys^ in the World. Et of the
parsecucyon that he shall do to the church and of is being / et kyllyng et of
the pain that he shall suffer in hell. Et after i^ the segund party of this
tractyte We shall traycte of the.xv. syngys or toknys that shall cum before the
judgment general of god. Et in the thryd party of the said judgment general.
Et in this.iiij party of fynal of the joys of paradys.

The first party of the cummyng of ante christ and of the birth of him.


QWen to the first party We shoold beleyf et hold that owr salwyowr Jesus christ
shall not cum to is judgment general bot first antecryst ennemy of owr faith
shall be cu^myt in the World of the qwych cummyng the lymytacyon of the tym is of
al incertayn after this that says the appoystyl in the segund pystyl the qwych
is Wryttyn to the Tessalyens in the segund cheptur. Rogamus vos per adueutu^
domini nostri jesus christi vt non cito moueamini neque terramini. et cetera que
sequuntur. That is to say / I pray you my brether be the cu^myng of owr lord
jesus christ / that e mow not no dreyd not so sown so as at the day of the lord.
That is to say / the day of the judgment War neyr. Et keyp Weyl that any of you
dreyd not i^ no mayner. For the lord jesus christ shall not cum to is judgment
general Wnto this that certain departement et dyuysyon be first cum et that the
soon of perdycyon / that is to Wnderstond antecryst be reweystyt and apperyt.
Et after the doctuts We find.iiij. thyngys pryncypals the qwyche shall go before
the cummyng of antecryst. The first shall be the dyuysyon et partyng of landys
and of the eerth the qwych shall depart of the empyr of Rowm. For before the
cummyng of the said antecryst the empyr of Rowm shall be dyuydyt in.x. Reawmys as
yt is Wryttyn in danyel in the vij. cheptur / et fyguryt be the best qwych
had.x. hornys. The segund thing that shall go before the enmmyng of the said
antecryst shall be the dyuysyon of the chyrchys pertyculyeres the qwych shall
depart of the obedyans of the chyrehys of Rowm. The thryd thing that shall go
before cu^myng of antecryst shall be the departing / et the dyuysyon of syndry
crystyn men the qwyche shall depart from the faith catholyk. Et this is Wryttyn
i^ the appoystyl i^ the first that he Wryttys to is dyscypyl tymothee in
the.iiij. cheptur. Innouissimis temporibus discedent quidam aside. The.iiij.
thing that shall go before the cu^myng of antecryst he shall cum in the tym in the
qwych the synnars shall be in great habondans so as they are new. Et of this berys
Wytnes danyel qwen he said. Cum venerint iniquitates consurget rex impudicus.
That is to say qwen the synnys shall be generaly skateryt Et the king of al fylth
and of lychery generaly shall be fyllyt of al inyquyte shall cum above the eerth.
Et also yt is right that qwe^ antecryst prens of inyquyte shall cum above the
earth that he shall not find oonly oon inyquyte bot syndry inyquites. Et after
this qwyche is Wryttyn i^ Osyas i^ the.iiij. cheptur in the tym of antecryst
men kyllars / okerers / lears / adwlterers / rapyns / vrechydnes in ower great
exces et superfluytes. Et oon syn shall twech the other for oon syn shall fall in
oon other. Et certanly after the merytys of the sugges of god shall send them
rectors and gowernowrs so as says saint Gregoyr. Et of this yt is said in the
decreyt. Prelatus malum quandoque datur propter peccata populi. vj. q. j. Et as
to this cause yt shall not be merweyl if antecryst cu^mys qwen the synnys shall
habownd above the eerth. Of tym yt is Wryttyn i^ sant Mathow i^ the.xxiiij.
cheptur Inyquyte shall habownd et charity of syndry shall be cold before that the
cursyt antechryst shall cum above the eerth. Qwych is he qwyche puttys in dowt
that the tym of antecryst cummys and drawys neyr Wndersto^dyng that be the ewyl
coustumes and infynyt synnys qwyche ar now doyn. Certanly et With out
dyffyculte that the men Wertws of the tym by passyt var Wont to have i^
reprewyng et shaam et that is now right honorabyl and just to men that are now
present. Qweyr is now the chastyte et honestyte of marriage. The contynens et
relygyon of men of church. Now the synnys of the flech / howrdowms / and
fylthys ar publykyt in men of oon kind in oon other faith and Weryte ar
banyshyt / marchans Wsys not bot of falset lesyngys and trompety of sweryng et
mensweryng for to sell and by mor deyt With out the dreyd of god before their
oyn. Qwheyr for their restys not bot that the said antecryst cum the qwych is
messa^gyer of the rynd of the World. Et if they ash at me qweyr shall be boorn
the said antecryst. Saint Remy above the appocalyps says that he shall be boorn
in babylon of sum iowys the qwych shall be of the lygnage of dan after the
prophecy of Jacob in Genesy in the.xlix. cheptur qweyr he says Fiat dan coluber
i^ via / ceraftes in femita. That is to say / that antecryst shall dyscend of
the lygnayge of dan and shall arm ageyns the holy faithful men the qwych shall be
bytyng of the byt of is pestyllens te^hyng / et shall smyt of the hoorn of is
might. Than yt is certain so is the rede^ptur jesus christ Was boorn of the
lygnayge of Judah in Bethleem in oon right small cite in the toknyn of meyknes to
the oposyte of antecryst shall be boorn et dyscend of the lygnage of dan et
shall be boorn in babylon in oon prydful cite in toknyn of co^fusyon et
maledyecyon of pride and after thies that is Wryttyn i^ the appocalyps in
the.xxx. cheptur. Asce^det de mari. That is to say so as exposys the glos that
he shall be boorn et cum of babylon the qwych is neyrthe s^^ Et yt may be ashyt
of qwhat mother he shall be boorn.

Answer after Damascene that he shall be boorn forth of the band of marriage et of
pewpyl that are lycherows charnels abandonnyt to al dyssolucyon et howrdom. Et
also sownys he shall be co^sawyt in the Waam of the howr et Wnhappy mother full of
al abhomynacyon et fylth of lychery his saowl dam nyt shall be fyllyt of the
speryt of dewylry the qwych shall be in is body et live With him after the say of
the appoystyl the qwych says. Cuius aduentus est secundum operationem sathane.
That is to say / that the cummyng of the said antecryst shall be after the
operacyon of satan. For after the concepcyon of the said antecryst the dewyl
shall dyscend before in the Waam of is abhomynabyl mother by the Wertu et
operacyon of the qwych the said antecryst shall be boorn et norryshyt. Et for
that he shall be callyt the soon of perdycyon actyuyly. For he shall be solycytows
and gledsum of the da^nacyon of other^. Et be this that said is followys that
they are and shoold bechasyd as oon herytyk and ennemy of the faith qwych says
that antecryst shall be boorn of oon Wyergyn the qwych is right falls and
damnabyl heresy. For yt Was newyr ghewyn to oon Wyergyn no grantyt the tym by
pass yt no shall be i^ the tym to cum that oon may be mother and Wyergyn to
gydder With out commyxtyon of said and twychyng of man excep the holy Wyergyn
mary mother of owr redemptur jesus christ oonly. The qwych consawyt be operacyon
of the holy gheost et Was Wyergyn in the concepcyon of yr soon / et Wyergyn /
i^ is birth / and after is birth of the qwyche owr mother the holy church
syngys. Quia nec prima^ similem visa est / nec habere seque^tem. That is to say
/ that the holy Wyergyn mary had newyr mor oon sych lyk se^blabyl to her / to
the party after that shall be lyk her. Et for this sho is callyt in the church.
Virgo singulares. Vyergyn and singlar vyth out ewyr mor that their be oon lyk
to her. yt may be ashyt after of the mayner of the lywyng and conuersacyon of
the said antecryst and in the plays qweyr he shall be norryshyt.

Answer ve shoold Wndersto^d that he shall be noryshyt in two cytys that is to
say i^ the cytys of corroaym and of bethsayda. Et of the qwych says the
redemptur in sant matohw i^ the ix. cheptur. Ve tibi corroaym et ve tibi
bethsayda. Et cetera que sequuntur. That is to say cursyng shall cum above
corroaym maledycyo^ shall cu^ above the bethsayda. For et the Wertus and
myraclys had beyn maid in the cytes of the payens they Wald have doyn pennans /
and boorn the hayr cloth and lyeng above the aws. Says also the docturs that
after that the said antecryst shall be so norryshyt in the said eytes he shall go
i^ jerusalem in the tempyl the qwych the iowys shall hawe maid et byggyt. Et
shall be circumcysyt saya^d to the iowys I am yowr christ and yowr messyaes qwych
is promest ow by the law. Et incontinent the iowys as fowlych peupyl et out of
Wit shall resayf him for their messyas and shall beleyf in him. Et he shall sit
him in the said tempyl say^nd is oon ewyl and Wekytle ar et oon wekyt
blasphemour that is god. Et this is that jesus christ be foresaid et show to the
iowys I am cumwyt i^ the nam of my father et e Would not resayf. Alius
autemveniet in nomine suo et illi credetis. That is to say their shall cum oon
other that is to say the ewyl antecryst the qwych is cu^myt i^ is nam and e
shall beleyff him and shall ressayf him and beleyf i^ him Et certanly that is oon
great pyty that the pewpyl of iowys shall be so dyssauyt that the shall specially
beleyf i^ him and follow him as their god. Et yt is to notyfy that the said
antecryst shall be fyllyt of vycys and synnys for so much he is callyt antecryst
so contrary to christ et is live shall be fulfyllyt of vycys. For as jesus christ is
Weshel of al Wertus / sych lyk antecryst shall be the Weshel of al synnys et
Wycys. Et so as jesus christ com in all meyknes / the said antecryst shall cum in all pride. Et self Ways as jesus christ is cu^myt for to exalt the meyk of heart et
for to iustyfy the synnars / antecryst shall cum for to oppress the meyk et to
out cast them. Et for to magnyfy and exalthe sinners. Et shall torment the good
and they that are just et shall seyk et shers is propyr gloyr / for he shall be
right prydful. Et this is yt that says the appoystyl. Extolletur super omne
quod dicitur cristus aut colitur. That is to say that the said a^tecryst shall
exalt him by pride above all that he qwych he may be honowryt / that is above the
godheyd of the redemptur for he shall be in the te^pyl so byggyt as said is and
shall shaw him to al as he War god. Et Werytably he shall be right ewyl / for he
shall be prens of al ewyl men et of al inyquyte yt is Wryttyn in danyel in
the.xj. cheptur. Eleuabitur et magnificabitur aduersus omnem deum. That yt to
say he shall exalt and magnify him self ageyns all the deyte. Et certa^ly the
pride of antecryst shall be mor than great then yt of lucyfer for he vold not have
beyn lyk to god bot antecryst Would exalt him above. The above said a^tecryst
for mor great ewyl Wnrewerans shall strane the men to ador is image and Wekyt
ydoll. Et he shall got merk et toknyng al is sugges of is caracter specyal. Et
for this cause he shall dystroy / et put away the toknys of the corser of the
crucifyxet shall ordon to adowrn is ydol as We reed in danyel in the iij.
cheptur that nobogodonosar that all the gooddys of the eerth War put away thayr
to oonly that he War reputyt god so shall do antecryst above al lycherows so as
yt is Wryttyn i^ danyel i^ the.xj. cheptur. Erit in concupiscenciis feminarum
That is to say that the said antecryst shall be habandonnyt to al concupyscens et
lycheryes of Weme^. Et Werytably that shall be right peryllows et dangerows after
the saw of the appoystyl. In nouissimis diebus iustabunt tempora periculosa.
That is to at the days of the World of qwych shall be in the tym of the said
antecryst the tym shall be right peryllows. For at the cu^myng of antecryst the
men et Women shall syn so manyfestly that they shall have no shaam to do their
lycherys et adulterys / they shall do them al most ^pynly et With out any shaam.
Et yt is great pyty to day of thy lycheryes qwych rynnys in the Woorld / for
syndry baghthys the^ in their malys lycherys howrdowms and sych pewpyl ar the
messangers of antecryst. For as jesus christ vas chaste and mowrowr of chastyte in
deyd and i^ saw / of the contrary antecryst shall be lycherowes. Et so as jesus
christ had ioon the baptyst for is messanger and precur for the qwych is full of
al meyknes of contrary antecryst shall have for is messangers lycherows men et
Woman howrmasters and howrs ffornycaturs the qwych shall be of al fylth et of
Wncleynnes corrumpyt in Word et deyd. Et so as jesus christ Was powyr of
temporel goodyes of this World as to the admynystracyo^ vsayge / superflewyte /
of them / for he Was right powyr in is birth in is live after this qwych is
vryttyn in sant mathow in the.xj. cheptur qweyr yt is Wryttyn the toddys as
propyr hoollys for to hyd them et loge the^ bot the soon of the vyergyn as not
oon little propyr plays qweyr he may lay or rest his heyd. Of the contrary
a^tecryst shall be much rych et full of temporel gooddys of this World / for he
shall have might and lord ship abowe all the tresors of the World et of the gold
and of the sylwer the qwych he shall spend in to ewyl et vekyt vsayge. Et that
a^tecrist shall blasphem god et is santtys so yt is Wryttyn in daniel in the.xj.
cheptur. Aduersus deum deoru^ loquetur blasphemiam. That is to say that the
said antecryst shall pronowns blasphemyngys ageyns god et the santtys et of the
angels qwych ar gooddys by partycypacyon of goodness and not by essens. Et for
so much the blasphematurs ar messangers of antecryst. Heyr after We shall se of
the persecucyon the qwych shall do the said antecryst ageyns the crystyn man Et
yt is to not that he and is dewyllys shall torment all the crystyn men i^ al
pertyes of the eerth. Et this he shall do i^.iiij. mayneres. First by is subtyl
tystyngys et falls prechyngys. For he shall presh oon new law right Wekyt et ewyl
be the qwych he shall lycens et gheue faculte et might to dosyn. Et also the law
of salut and veryte forbyddys al syn / of the contrary the law of Wekytnes and
falsete shall tyst men to syn. Et shall be the said cursyt and Wekyt law preshyt
by all the cytes / the qwych law shall be conte^psyon and dystynccyon of the law
of iesucryst. Et Werytably the said antecryst shall presh et co^ferm be falls
argumens et falls probacyons et tystyngys that jesus christ Was not the faithful
messyas promyst in the law and that he shall be the faithful and that no other no
he shall be yt no as beyn. Et shall rynfals cursyt preshours by cytes et shall
prech the above said falls prechyng et techyng. The said antecryst shall lat so
much is yt is possybyl to him that the holy Wryt be not exposyd be the faithful
docturs after the faithful right Wit and Wnderstondyng / et than shall be maid
les the Werytys of the soonnys of men and of the self ways says esaye. Corruet
in platea veritas. Et in danyel in the.viij. cheptur. Prosternetur veritas in
terra. That is to say in the tym of the said antecryst veryte shall be oppressyt.
Certanly the false preshowrs of the said antecryst that the lycherows et Worldly
men of this Word shall eyr vyth good Will for they shall tech them to syn and for
to by lycherows et fallow the Worldly pleysans Et so as jesus christ says in the
gospel in sant mathow in the vij. cheptur. The vay is right strayt that ledys
the saowl in the ewyrlestand live. Et says in oon other plays Essay et effors
you to entyr by the strayt port of pennans. Et of contrary / antecryst shall
presh the flesly thyngys techant men to fallow their propyr senswalyte / et to
go by the large Way of Wolwptes of the World / the qwych vay shall leyd the
saowl to perdycyon. Et for this shall the said a^tecryst have maynay awdyturs /
et that is yt that says the appoystyl. Erit tempus cum sanam doctrinam no^
sustinebunt. et cetera que sequu^tur. He shall cu^ says the appoystyl oon tym
that is to say the tym of antecryst that the men shall not susteyn no Would not
eyr the holy and faithful techyng of jesus christ bot shall fallow their desyrs et
sensualyte fallowyng falls preshowrs the qwych shall be plesans to thayr eyrrys
shall not say to the^ oon Word of Weryte preshant fabyls et lesyngys. The
segu^d mayner by the qwych antecryst shall dyssayff syndry shall be by the shawyng
of myraclyes and merweyllows thyngys after the appoystyl qwych says. Cuius
aduentus est secundum operationem sathane in omni virtute et signis and
prodigiis mendacibus. That is to say that said antecryst shall cum by the
operacyon of satan in all virtue of toknys dyssawabyls et falls Woordys. For the
syngys the qwych shall do the said antecryst shall be falls for thies that he doys
them by heart and frye^s of nygroma^cy. Et they shall be lears for they shall
desayff the men by the said falls signys so as yt is Wryttyn in the appocalyps
in the.xiij. cheptur. Seducet habitantes in terra propter signa que data sunt
illi. That is to say that antecryst shall dyssayf the habytans of the eerth be
toknys that shall be maid be him Et in effec the said antecryst shall mayk
merweyllows toknys for to conform is Wekyt et falls doctryn / for he shall cause
the treys to florys fowdanly et so he shall cause them to dry incontinent. He
shall mayk the images to speyk and say the thyngys to cum. He shall mayk and cause
tormens et tempes in the sea et incontinent he shall cause them to ces. He shall
mayk the rywars et the flooddys to ryn Wpwart towrna^t their right cowrs et
natwrel ordyr. He shall mowyf the air by great co^mocyons maykand thondyr et fire
flaghtys he shall falsely rays them that are deeth. For the dewyllys shall entyr in
thayr bodies et tayk the spays of men the qwych shall appeyr as thy War roysyng
from deeth. Et to the qwych bodies they shall say that they war roysyn be
antecryst. He shall mayk the fire to dyscend of the hewyn that is to say the
ewyl spyryt of the dewyl above them the qwych is of is band thayr to that they
may speek With syndry tongys to the mayner of the appoystyls. Et in effec al
this that antecryst et is dewyllys shall prech translatant the holy Wryt in
ewyl. He shall conform by myraclys and falls synnys done be art of nygroma^cy and
might of the dewyl thayr to that they mayk samblant to follow the appoystyls
after this quych is Wryttyn in sant mathow i^ the last cheptur that the
appoystyls of jesus christ prechyt be hal placys holpand owr lord mayka^d sekyrys
voordys be toknys et myraclys ewyde^t Et thayr to that I say shortly the said
antecryst and is dewyllys falls prophetyes and preshowrs shall do so maynay
ewyllys so maynay falls toknys et. merweyllows thyngys that the most great party
of the crystyn pewpyl shall be put in errewr blyshyt shall they be that as perfyt
faith et qwych abydys i^ the law of owr lord jesus christ / this that may syndry
do qwen they are dewly aduertyt of the dyssawyngys et inwencyons of the said
antecryst the qwych may be Wnderstondyt of the reeddyng of this present
traytte. Et they may ash queyr for god the makar shall parmyt that the bewyllys
et their seruans may do sych toknys and merweyllows thyngys. Answer sant
augustyn says in the thryd book of the cite of god in the iiij. cheptur that
ytys for.iij. raysso^s. The first is thayr to that the tro^powrs and dyssawours
most be trumpyt et dyssawyt. The segund thayr that good pewpyl be exercyd in
good et that abydys ewyr mor in the faith vyth out Waryeng. Et the thryd that
the good pewpyl pretend not to do sych falls tokyns the qwych they beleyf sewrly
to be done be dewylry art. Et certanly in the tym of the said antecryst they
that are good shall not mayk no myraclys and i^ this shall appeyr thayr constans.
Et as to this caussant gregoyr in is morales co^syderant the trybulacyon the
qwych shall be above the crestyens in the tym of the said antecryst says. Et
consider We now and thynk We how much great shall be the temptacyons et
trbulacyons of the thought of man in the tym of antecryst delyweryt is body to
martyr / et always the false dyssauyr that is to say antecryst shall mayk
miraclys i^ merweyllows thyngys before is eyn for to towrn and dyssayf Ws
certanly the crystyn pewpyl shall than acqwyr great meryt The thayd mayner ^e the
qwych antecryst shall dyssayff the men and the Women shall be be ghyftys that he
shall gheue them that shall follow him. For the dewyl shall reweyl and shaw to the
said antecryst all the tresors the qwych (...) beyn long ago hydyng in the eerth
/ and be this he shall inclyn^^d draw to him the most great party of men. First
he shall draw to him be the said ghy^tys the great and mighty men of the earth. Et
syen after the others / pryncypally and above (...) others the awarycyows / of
this is Wryttyn in danyel the prophet i^ the.xj. cheptur qweyr yt is said
diuidit terram gra^^^o. That is to say he shall ^ywyd the earth thankfully. Et
^^e spalmyst. Sedet cum diuiti^^ in occultis vt interficat in^^centem. That is
to say an^^cryst shall sit With the rych ^^ndayns of this World the ^wych he as
maid rich the qwych he as drawyng to him be gyftys and promessys thayr to that
he and the said mondayns so dissauyt be him may kyl the the i^noce^s the god
crystyn men the qwych Wald not follow is falls and Wekyt thechyng. Et certanly
yt is good to dreyd that syndry flatteurs and falls prophettys might and ewyl
preschowrs that they be not precursurs / messangyers and prononsowrs of the
cummyng of the said antecryst the qwych co^seyllys to the prensys of this World
that they tayk vnryghttusly the gooddys and substans of their subges for to
rych the^ self thayr to that the said falls may obteyn sum gooddys temporels
gheuant them to Wnderstond this the qwych they oppres Wnryghtusly the qwych
they may lysumly gheue to the fowndacyon of chyrchys chapels / or of obys to
the great perdycyon confusyon and damnacyon as much of them that co^seyllys as
of them that affaldys the to cursyt Wnhappy Wekyt dyssauars trompowrs the
dewyllys follows of the said malycyows antecryst to their conseyl and falls
tystyngys and dyssawyngs. Et Werytably so as antecryst and is dewyllys shall be
cummyt and resauyt by is myghthtyes to this he shall gheue temporel gooddyes et
riches sychlyk ar syndry falls ypocrytyes dyssauars Weyl cu^myt With syndry rych
prensys in the Way of this that the said falls precursurs of a^tecryst assewrys
the kyngys of their saluacyo^ et that they gheue the^ this that they
vnryghtusly acqwyryt ageyns their co^scyens Wythowt any Will of right before
their eyn the qwych is veryte et vndowtabyl and co^mun. No^ dimititur peccatu^
nisi restituatur ablatum. Helas yt is now great pyty of the auarys of this World
/ for qwych gheuys to day he shall ryng temporally. The ecclesyastyk porweya^t
the cursyt tym of the for cursurs et messa^giers of antecryst says in the.x.
cheptur. Pecunie obediunt oi^a Al thing obeys to pecu^. Et says in oon other
plays that the ghyftys shall blind the eyn of sayge and Wysmen. Certainly in
owr tym qwych yes pyty most all the men shall appetyt ho^nowr and desyr to be
rych of the temporel gooddys of this World mor than ewyr they did says. Ieremye
in the.vj. cheptur yt is veryfyed yt that he said be the qwych he says. A
minori vsque ad maiorem ome^s auaricie student. That is to say the most great
almayner of pewpyl studys to fallow the cursyt fire of auarys the qwych shall
retowrn the right judgment / to auans oon fowl for oon sayge / et berys and
tra^sportys reawmys / co^treys et cytys of thayr estayt of prosperyte in
unhappy et lamentabyl Wrechydnes. Et Werytably I beleyf that yt may be Weel
said that if the said antecryst lyuyt or War cu^myt he shoold have syndry
seruans et dewyllys for to resayf is ghystys. Et yt is much to dreyd that We be
not neyr the tym of the said antecryst Wnderstondyng this that said is / as
much they that are lytteryt / as Wnlettryt / and they that are ydeot / nobyls as
vnnobyl / also much rych / as pouyr ar taykyn of the stynka^d fire of auarys so
as they should ewyrlesta^dly abyd i^ thyes World The.iiij. mayner by the qwych
the said antecryst shall strane the meyn to obey to him shall be by turmens
acqwyryt by him.

For them qwyche he may not twrn be oon of the three torme^s above said he shall
punysh them by syndry torme^s Et i^ effec the said a^tecryst and is dewyllys
they shall thynk syndry mayner of tormens be the qwyche he may towrn et put
forth the faithful and good crystyn out of the faith this that says danyel in
the.xij cheptur. Erit tempus quale no^ fuit ex quo gentes ceperunt esse vsque
ad te^pus illud. That is to say / thayr shall cum oon tym of antecryst of the
qwych they have not seyn sych lyk tym from the beginning of the World unto this
tym. Et the said antecryst shall Weyr above all the relygyows et men of church so
as says the Glos above the Psalmyst. Oculi eius in pauperem recipient. That is
to say that he shall torment the holy parsones of relygyon and of the church and
gegeneraly the powyrs of spreyt. Et as this cause the torme^tures of the church
and of clerkys et lettryt also much regulyer as seculyers ar the messangyers et
for cursurs et of antecryst. Et indowtably in the tym of the said antecryst
shall be so great et grewows parsecucyon above the church mylyta^t and above the
me^brys of yt that thayr Was newyr seyn so great in the tym of martyrs of owr
salwyowr jesus christ. Thought yt be so that the said martyrs has suffryt syndry
trybulacyons / always the good and faithful crystyn men shall suffer mor great
in the tym of the said antecryst. Et this confermys the master incompendium of
the Weryte theologycal qweyr he says that in the tym they vold not sell no thing
to the good crystyn pewpyl no by no thing of them bot oonly of them that as the
caractar of the said antecryst by the qwych they shall Wnderstond that they are
of his pewpyl follows et seruans For so that antecryst shall be the most cruel
of al others parsecutwr^ the qwyche has beyn the tym before. Sych lyk the
santtys and good parsons the qwych shall be constans that tym than al otheres
that as beyn before. Et indowtably god shall ghewe and grant in this tym oon great
grace to is good and faithful crystyn men by the qwych they may suffer et
susteyn the above said trybulacyons after qwych yes Wryttyn in abacuch in
the.iij cheptur. Cu^ tratus fueris misericordie recordaberis. Lord says the
prophet to god / thou shall remembyr of thy meyrcy qwe^ thou shall be crabbet at
thy pewpyl. Et that the said trybulacyo^ shall be so sharp is said is It apperys
be this qwych is Wryttyn in sant mathow in the.xiij. cheptur. Erunt tunc
trybulacyones quales non fuerunt ab initio vsque nunc neque fient. That is to
say that the trybulacyons the qwych shall be in the tym of antecryst shall be sych
that newyr mor Was seyn sych lyk sen the beginning of the World Wn to that tym
no shall not be seyn after in tym to cum. O so much ar fowlysh et out of Wit
they qwych desyrys that they may leyf Wn to the tym of the said antecryst. Et
says ower that if they lewyt Wnto that tym the qwych they shall suffer With good
Will great pains et torme^s for owr salwyowr jesus christ the qwych parawantur for
oon little persecucyon Would leyf the faith and habandon the said faith of owr
salwyowr jesus christ. Consider ewyrych oon this the qwych is cum to sant petyr
in the persecutyon et passion of jesus christ et he shall have great dreyd et he
shall Wndersto^d oon small thing of him self With out presumcyon. Sant petyr
promyst to iesucryst that he shoold not leyf him i^ qwat trybulacyo^ and shoold
he die. Et always et qwen yt co^ to the pyteows howr of is passion he renoncyt
is redemptur for the sympyl Word of oon maydyn et chamberer et servant the
qwych said to him swetly et fynaly renoncyt.iij. tymys. O qwath shall do than
the powyr crestyn man the qwych shall be than i^ mor great et mor sharp
tribulacio^ that Waes newyr seyn sen the beginning of the World Certa^ly they
shall have mich to do. and War not the meyrcy of god qwych shall confort the said
crystyn pewpyl the said antecryst shoold and dyssayf al nature of man kind. Bot
the maykar the qwych Will ewyr mor holp is frendys shall send two great et
excellant prophetis that is to say Enoch et hely the qwych ar in paradys
terrest and the qwych shall resyst ageyns the said antecryst et his dewyllys
presha^t the faith of owr salwyowr jesus christ thayr to that they towrn the
iowys the qwych as beyn dyssauyt be the said antecryst et that they conform et
confort the good cristyn men the qwych has resystyt ageyns the said antecryst
and shall call to the faith them the qwych has goon from yt et from the Way of
the faith by the said antecryst et is dewyllys. Et certanly crestyens et iowys
the qwych ar now dyfferent et of dyscord in the relygyon and Wnyte of the faith
they shall concord et be Wnyt With the crystyn men in the law of jesus christ. Et
yt is yt that says the prophet. In diebus illis saluabitur judah and israel
habitabit co^fidenter. That is to say that the pewpyl et the crestyens shall ^e
gadderyt in oon in the faith of jesus christ. Et shall be the said pewpyl iudayk
fawyt. Et so aes yt is Wryttyn insa^t ioon in the.x cheptur that oon park
shall be gadderyt of the iowys et of the crystyn men the qwych shall be than
gadderyt to the mayner of sheyp Wnder oon shyephard. That is to say in the
faith of jesus crist the qwych yes the faith full pastor. The said prophetys
Enoch et Hely shall presh to all the pewpil the faith and the techi^g of jesus
christ so as yt yes Wryttyn i^ the appocalyps i^ the.xj. cheptur I shall ghewe to
my two prophets that is to say enoch and hely the sperit of Weryte and they
shall prophetise be oonthowsa^d two ho^dreth three stor and.vj. days that yes to
say three earrys and oon half so as did jesus christ. and they shall be cowert of
sekkys / that is to say they shall presh penna^s of word and of deyd shawa^d
and gheua^t exa^pyl of good living by holiness of live Dabo duobus. etc. They
shall repreyf the said a^tecryst and shall declayr is gyllys and dyssauynges and
that he is bot oon lear. and oon in uocatur and caller of the dewyllys soon of
the dewyl of hell and oon child of perdycyo^. Et for that he shall gar the^ die.
Soon after the deeth of the holy prophetys antecryst et his dewyllys shall be
great et mayk brankqwettys et sowpers and feystys etwys the^ makand the fest of
the deeth of the said prophetys the qwych Was ageyns the^. Et they send oon to
the others ghystys and presens sayant be gled for now they that War ageyns owr
prechyngys et Werkys ar owercu^myt. Et of contrary the faithful crystyn men
shall be tryst and sorrowful and mowrnant of the deeth of the said prophetys et
they shall be co^fusantly scornyt of the said dewyllys. Bot owr lord Will ewyr mor
confort is freyndys in their extreym necessyte shall rays the said prophetys at
the eynd of.iij. days et oon half / so as yt is Wryttyn in the appocalyps.
Spiritus vite intrabunt in eos. That is to say that the saowllyes shall entyr i^
the bodies of the said prophet the qwych shall be above their feet et shall be
lyuant et vnpayssabyl for they shall newyr die after that they be roysyng from
deeth to live. Et after the said resurreccyo^ so aes before the good and
faithful Crystyn pewpyl mowrnyt et did Weyp With out any consolacyon and that
the dewyllys of antecryst maid great chyer / sychlyr and of contrary they cursyt
dewyllys shall be sorrowful et confondyt and merweyl. Et the good crystyn men
shall be confort yt et consyrmyt i^ the faith qwen they shall sey the said holy
prophetys ryssyn and gloryfyed. Et that they shall heyr the Woyes of the hewyn
the qwych shall say to the said prophetys / ascend heyr in the company of angels
et of santys. Et than sayant al they the qwych Would se them ascend to the hewyn
in oon clood in body et in saowl gloryows so as did jesus christ the day of is
holy ascencyon. Of the qwych the good crystyn men shall be much reioysyt et
conformyt. Et shall Wnderstond et gheue thankys to god. Et syndry of them qwych
as beyn towrnyt be antecryst shall towrn them to pennans et the others shall
perseueyr in their obstynacyon and shall torment the crystyn morthan before. Et
yt is ghanant to not that ante crist shall feign him to by deyd by.iij. days
and shall yed him in sum secret plays / et after he shall appeyr fayant to is
dewyllys that he shall be royssyng after this qwych is Wryttyn in the appocalyps
in the.xiij. cheptur. Vidi vnum de capitibus suis. q. occisum. etces. Et this
doyeng is dewyllys shall presh is resurrection above the qwych he shall se^d the
dewyl the qwych shall dysce^d above them in kind of fire Et syndry shall go With
them for by the Woys of the dewyl the qwych shall be With in them they shall speyk
syndry la^gayge to the mayner of the appoystyls the qwych Was fyllyt of the
holy gheost. Et in all and be al qwen to the Werkys full of myraclyes and
godlynes the said a^tecryst shall effors him by art of nygromancy et dewyky
conform him to do sychlyk as jesus christ to is appoystyls et dyssypyls. Et this
doyeng as yt is Wryttyn i^ danyel in the.xj. cheptur. Antecryst shall cu^ With
oon great multytwd of is dewyllys et adhere^s and shall put is tabernakyl above
the ill of olyuet. Veniet antecristus in multitudine magna / et figet
tabernaculum fuu^ et cete. For so as says the glos. That antecryst shall ascend
of the said mo^tayn in to the air by art of nygromancy et dewylry might as did
symo^ magus the qwych the dewyllyes did beyr in the air Et this doyeng so as
says the appoystyl. Reuelabitur ille iniquus. That is to say that the inyquyte
dyssauyng et malys of the said a^tecryst shall be opynly reweyllyt and manifest.
Que^ dominus jesus interficiet spiritu oris sui. So the qwych says the
appoystyl owr salwyowr et redemptur jesus christ shall kyl and put to deeth
presently al is dewyllys not by multytud or legyon of angels the qwych he may
se^d for to feyght ageyns the said antecryst bot oonly the spyryt of is mowth /
that is to say in the Wertu of the holy gheost et to is oonly Will for he shall
suffer that he be kyllyt et he shall be deeth incontinent dixit and facta sunt.
Or after sum he shall be kyllyt by the archangel sant mygheel executur of the
Word et iustys of god. Et this shall be doyn about the plays qweyr god ascendyt
to hewyn in the qwych plays the said antecryst shall be smyttyn of deeth
ewyrlestand and shall fall in hell. For indowtably he shall die of oon ewyl deeth.
First for he shall die of oon sowdan deeth. Segundly by this that he shall die full
of al synnys after the sente^s of the psalmyst In operibus manuum suarum
comprehensus est peccator. yt ma be ashyt how shall he be punyshyt in hell.
Answer. Certa^ly is pain shall be merweyllows horrybyl / dreydabyl and sensabyl.
For first he shall ewyr mor by pryuyst of the Wysyon of god after the Word of
the prophet ysaye Inique gessit non videbit gloriam dei. That is to say. The
cursyt antecryst he beyand in this Woorld put is tym to do ewyl as to this cause
he shall not se the gloyr of god the qwych is the most great pain of them that are
damnyt so as says sant crysostom. Segundly the said antecryst shall be
ewyrlestantly crucyt / tormentyt / bowrnt and smyttyn / in hell et shall newyr die
after this qwych is Wryttyn in job in the.xx. cheptur. Luet omnia que fecit nec
tamen consumabuntur. That is to say That antecryst shall suffer in hell the pain
of all the ewyllys the qwych he as doyn. Bot always he shall not die for yt shall
be With out eynd et With out Waystyng. Et thought yt be so that is pain is lyk
to the pain of others that are damnyt as to the duracyon and infynyte for this

after this qwych is Wryttyn in the appocalyps Quantum glorificauit se in

ewyr mor in the company and Wysyon of the horrybyl dewyllys and that al is
dewyllys followys sych lyk al them of is allegens not oonly of oon pain bot
With all the paynyes that is in hell he shall be punyshyt of all the pains of hell
of the qwych We have Wryttyn afor qwych thayr is diverse et syndry tormens of
the qwich the said a^tecryst shall suffer for yes iniquyte. yt may be ashyt if
owr salwyowr et rede^ptur jesus christ shall cu^ inco^tyne^t to hald is great
judgment general after the deeth and damnacyon of the said antecryst.

Answer. To this answerys the glos above the.xj. cheptur of danyel the qwych
says that.xl. days shall be ghewyn to them to do pennans qwych has beyn dyssawyt
be the said antecryst the Qwcyh as mysbelewyt et erryt in the faith of
iesucryst. Bot always after the said.xl. days Wn to the eynd of the World /
no manvayt the spays no tym for this is in the Will and dysposycyon of him qwych
in tym et howr shall judge the good et ewyl the qwych he as porwoyt to do before
the Worldys. Et certanly shall Wnderstond ewydently that they have beyn dyssauyt
by antecryst shall towrn to the faith of iesucryst as said is. Et shall be owr
mother the holy church payssabyl Wn to te eynd of the Wolrd. Always sum
minystryes of antecryst shall be gled and reioys them and mayk feystys and plays
in syndry mayners Et shall contynwe in thayr synnys that are cursyt sayand lat
was mayk good chier for thought yt be that so that owr master be deyd always We
hawe seurte and peys. Bot so as says the appooystyl Wryttant to is dyssypyl thy
mothee. Cum dixerunt pax et securitas repentinus illis veniat interitus. That
is to say qwen they say We are now in peys and sewyrte sowdayn deeth shall cum
above them. Et so as says the salwyowr in sa^t mathow in the.xxiiij cheptur.
Sicut sint in diebus noe ita erit adue^tus filij. That is to say that so as
before the great dyluge maid be Watyr in the qwych did not abyd bot viij. parsons
of all the creaturs raysonnabyls the qwych Was above the eorth the man et the
Woman did eyt and drynk et dwell in their synnys With out Wyllyng to towrn them
Wn to the day that noe entryt in the arch and had no co^gnoys sans of their
synnys no of iustys of god Wn to the tym that the Watyr of the dyluge fell above
them drownyt and lost them sych lyk shall be of the me^ in the aend in the World
the qwych shall not amend them no towrn them to do pennans Wnto the tym the soon
of god owr redemptur shall cum sowdanly to hold is judgment qwe^ they shall not
be War of the^ self.

The segu^d party shall traytte of the.xv. toknyes et syngys that shall go be
for the judgment general.


IN the segund party We shall declayr et determ of the syngnys et toknys the
qwych shall go before the judgment general of god qwych is so meyrcyful that he
Will not punysh us bot first he Will send sum toknys before for to monys Ws to do
pe^nans. Et after the docturs I find that.iiij. sygnys shall be before. Et after
they.iiij. syngys shall cum other.xv. syngnys the qwych sa^t Ierosm says that he
has fund in the ennelles et cronicquees of the iowyes of the qwych I shall speyk
be ordyr. The first sing of the.iiij. be for said shall be the eynd et the
co^sumacyo^ of the World shall be that the might of satan the qwych by the Wertu
of the passion of owr redemptur jesus christ Waes maid les et bownd / yt shall be
lowsyt thought yt be that be for by the Wertu of the said passion yt Was bownd
that yt might not noy so much to men as yt did or has yt Would. For the dewyl is
bownd et holdyn Wn to oon certain tym Wn to the qwych he shall be lowsyt thayr to
that he may noy mor strenghtlyar by temptacyon and parsecusyon for mor great
purgacyon of the holy choysyn et mor great subuersyon and da^nacyon of ewyl men.
For in the eynd of the World the good shall be perfytly good et the ewyl parfytly
ewyl after this qwych is Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the last cheptur. Te^pus
prope est qui nocet noceat adhuc / et qui in sordibus est sordestat adhuc. Et
qui sanctus est santtificetur adhuc et iustus iustificetur adhuc. The segund of
the.iiij. sygnys of the eynd of the vorld shall be qwen charity shal-Wax cold.
For so as in man the qwych the phylosophys callys the little World qwen he Waxys
ald the naturel eyt of him Waxys cold in him and qwen he cu^myes above the
eerth et qwen yt cu^mys at the howr of the deeth yt faylys of al in him.
Sychlyk is yt of the great World / for so much as yt goys fordwart and that yt
drawys neyr the eynd charity qwych is the eyt of the live spyrytwel shall Wax
cold and fynaly shall fail / for this that the World drawys neyr the deeth and
of the eynd and terin shall be called be fault of charity and dry by falt of
devotion / the qwych two thyngys consystys in the conseruacyon of the spyrytwel
live Or as yt is that yt so be that We se the eyt of charity is al most slokyn
and that the humwr of devotion and orayson is al most dry Qwhat may We other
thing say bot the eynd of the World drawys neyr so as says the appoystyl
Wryttyn to the hebreus in the.viij. cheptur Quod enim antiquatur et senescit
prope interitum est. That is to say that yt that is hald is neyr the deeth. Et
if ouywyl consider as they serve now indewoytly god and Wnrewerently to god as
he is dysprysyt dyshonoryt so howgsumly blaspemyt he shall se that devotion is
not oonly Waxyt cold bot With that slokyn. Et as to regard of charity towart is
nyghtbowr yt is fayllyt yt apperys ewydently / for syndry that is nakyt cries
et may not have no holp. Et syndry howshaldars dies of honger qwych has no
supple. The port of pyty is chet and closyt / the fontayn of pyty as cloysyt
the stryndyes of yt rewyngys opynly theftys ar exercyt above the innoce^s the
qwych as no gheyn saying Faith is faylyt ettwyes syndry freyndys and parens.
Thayr restys no mor bot god to mayk is judgment above them qwych as chassyt and
put surth of the World / charity / et mercy in sing of the.iiij. that is before
the eynd of the World qwen al maneyr of synnys et of inyquytes shall be in the
World Dreyd of god is be hynd put qwen their is no Weryte / mercy / no pyty /
in the World bot allesyngys trompery and dyssauyngs. Et that the men shall love
of oon secret love and that they shall not set by bot of their preuay proffyt /
of the qwych shall preceyd al Wyces so as of charity procedys al Wertus for the

They shall be full of al vices / of malyes / of auarys of trayson / of men kyllars

the judgment general et eynd of the World in toknyng the tym drawys neyr in the
qwyche god the maykar Would judge is pewpyl after their merytys that is after
their good deydys et ewyl deydys shall be qwen the co^mocyons Weyrrys feghtyns

Mathow i^ the.xxiiij. cheptur / batayllys et Werrys shall be ettwys men ennemys

The great lordys shall rys ageyns their seruans and ageyns them self. The seruans

fulfyllyt qwych is Wryttyn in Jeremy in the.ix. cheptur Vnusquisque a proximo
suo suo se custodiat et cetera qui sequuntur. That is to say. Oon ychoon shoold
keyp him of is nyghtbowr and that they hawe no trust in their brothers. For
ewyrych oon faya^t that he is oon freynd bot they shall falsely dyssayf the^ and
him that he that trustys in him. Et oon brother shall scorn the other and shall

above said co^mocyon shall be in thyngys publykys / yt shall be oon tokyneuydent of
the latter eynd of the World. Others commocyons shall be in the elymens / for
before the eynd of the World shall be general famyn and not i^ oon regyon et in

cytys towrs et castles shall al be dystroyt et castyn done. Et in the flooddys

The air shall be fyllyt of pestylens and of infeccyons of the qwych shall cum the
said pestylens qweyr of deyd shall cum et mortalytys also Weyl in bestys as in

ierosm declarys yt not no the holy docturs affermys no thing of certain bot
seyffys them and puttys them in the Will of god the maykar.

The first sing as the se shall lift et rys above the montayns


THe first of the.xv syngys before the great judgment general is et shall be that
the sea shall be leftyt.xl. cottys above the heyst mo^tayngys of the World and
shall abayd the said vaters of the sea so leftyt to the maynayr and symylytwd of
myrakyl With out that they albeys mor in oon party than i^ oon other. Thayr to
that the Word of the psalmyst be Weryfyet. Mirabiles elaciones maris. That is
to say that the eleuacyo^s of see shall be merweilloues

Et this shall send god the maykar for to punysh the pridful pewpyl / for as
says the sayge in is prower bys in the.xiij. cheptur. Corsuperbi quasi mare
ferue^s quoth no^ quiescit. The heart of the prydful pewpyl is also as oon see
flowant the qwyche as no rest the qwych desyrys not bot dyscord and feghttyn
the qwych enge^drys pride / so as says Solomon in is prowerbys i^ the plays
aforsayd. Inter superbos semper iur^^a sunt. Dyscord et dyuysyons ar ettwys the
pridful men for pride vyl ewyr mor be i^ the most hye plays and thynkys
oonlytel thing oon great thing doyn be him et Worthy of lowyngys and of great
ho^nowrs and serchys how he may appeyr grettar et newyr Would be full of ho^nowr.
Et Werytably god shall send is said is in pain and punyshon of the said pride full
peupil so alyftit for to meyk et oppress them / et that the said prydful pewpyl
most have Wnderstondyng of their synnys and that they may do pe^nans. For owr
god and rede^ptur is so good so meyrcyful et full of charity that he Would newyr
dam no leyf oon saowl oonly. Bot ewyr moor monysys the synnars by toknyes
adwersytys et trybwlacyons thayr to that they may retowrn to him be grace et
pennans and satysfaccyon. For as sais the appoystyl Non deletur peccatu^ nisi
restituatur ablatu^. That is to say that the syn is newyr for ghewyn bot first
that he mayk satyffaccyon and restytucyon With Worthy pennans. Et in this
qwych said is god shall send the said.xv. toknys before that he cum to is great
and dreydful ingement general.



The segund sing is how the se shall dyscend in the deypnes and lawnes of the
eerth.
THe segund sing that shall be before the judgment general of god qweyr god shall
(...) to judge the qwyk et deed / shall be that the sea shall dyscend in the lawnes
et hoyllys of the earth that With pain they may sayt after this qwych is Wryt
ty^ in the prophyt Naum. Increpans mare et exsiccans illud

That is to say / that god the maykar almighty of the vorld shall blaym be oon
mayner of spekyn / he shall blaym the sea be oon sych Wys et be sych fashon that
yt shall yed yt in the deyp ^cym et profundyte et deypnes of the eerth so as yt
War dry.

Et in toknyng et horreur et demo^strane that the prydful men and Women lyche
rows / men and lycherows vomen full of fleshly l^^est the qwi^ch as ^yfty^ them
in this World by great presumpcyons et that they have Wylful liar labowrryt et
takyn pain for to conqwys the dygnytys / honnewrs / myghtes / riches / Wit fair
howsys and pleysant byggyns sumptws for to loge and draw their bodies et to
pleys to thayr fleshly lowstys than they Would have doyn for to grayth i^ hewyn
With god i^ the joy of paradys for their saowlys howssys and byggyns
spyrytwels. Et also qwych has dysprysyt et put Wnder their feyt the powyr that
^r meyk and mysterful of the good^ys of this World. Bot in this said day that
the said see shall abayss and shall yed yt so / they have good cause to dreyd and
yt is oon toknyng ewydent that for their above said synnys prydyes et
eleuacyo^s / et presumpcyons. They shall be maid meyk and put doyn i^ great
confession et da^nacyon of their saowlys after the Word said be sa^t Luc i^
the.xiij cheptur. Oi^s qui se exaltat humiliabitur. Et also yt is vryttyn i^
the perwerbys i^ the.xxix. cheptur. Superbu^ sequitur humilitas. That is to say
/ al man and of Woman the qwych leftys them self be pride and presumpcyon they
shall be oppressyt and mekyt.



The.iij. toknyng of the xv. syngyes that shall preceyd the great judgment of god
is that the sych and the mownstrys of the sea qwych shall appeyr maka^d great
cyrengys above the sea.
THe.iij. sing the qwych shall be preceyd the judgment general of god yes that al

lamentacyons et gheua^t great cryengys et merweyllows With howdows showttyngys
i^ syndry mayneyrs the qwych shall ascend Wnto the hewyn the qwyche cryengys god

Loquere terre et annunciabit tibi et ^arrabunt pisces maris. That is to say /
speyk to the earth and yt shall shaw to the synnys of men and the fych of these

doing in god et is commandyme^s. For the glednes of sych pewpyl / their
ioysummes / and their plays and pleysens shall be towrnyt in Wepyngys et
lame^tacyons. After this qwych is Wryttyn in sant luc in the.vj. cheptur qweyr

tournyt in Wepyngys et lamentacyons and mournyng i^ the day of the great

bestys of the sea by oon mayner of spekyng shall plane of the synnys of men
ashand Wengens of the said synnys by the qwych they suffer sych pain et
affleccyons in the sea.

The.iiij. tokyn is that the se et all the Waters of the floodys shall byrn.


The.iiij. sing that the sea and all the Waters of other flooddys shall byrn in
the fire cu^myng of the hewyn i^ punysho^ / and reprewyng et abhomynacyo^ of
lycherows men and lycherows vomen howrmasters and fornycaturs / the qwych as

The.v. toknyng shall be qwen the herbs et trees shall sweyt reed vater as blood.


THe.v. tokyn qwych shall go before the judgment general of god shall be that al
herbys treys Wooddys shall sweyt reed gouttys of Water as blood so as sybyt as

qweyr of We have spokyn i^ the traytte aforsayd.

The.vj. sing is the qwych shall go afor the judgment general of god that is
that all the byggyns as cytes et castles above the eerth shall fall.


THe.vj. tokyn the qwych shall preceyd the judgment general of god shall be sych

THe.x toknyng the qwyche shall go before the great judgment general above said

retwrna^t them to great meyrcy of god almighty the salwyowr et rede^ptur jesus

The.xj. sing shall be as the bonys of them that are deeth the qwych ar in thayr

THe.xj. tokyn and sing shall be going afor the judgment general of god shall be
that all the grawys et monymens qwyche ar from the orient Wnto the occydent.
shall opyn et all the bonys of the bodies of them that are dyscessyt from the
beginning of the vorld Wnto the said day shall rys et cum forth of their grawys
so as they shoold ryes incontyne^t et that yt as beyn prophecyd be the prophet
ezechyel i^ the.xxxvij. cheptur. Ecce ego apperiam tu mulos vestros. Certa^ly
says god saya^d to man of the day above said I shall oppyn yowr grawys thayr to
that yowr bonys most nedys cum forth of yowr grawys. Et this above said toknyng
god the makar shall send that all the thyngys sacryt et selfwayes the secret

co^fessyon or faithful pe^nans shall be reweylled dyscouert and maid opyn and the
synnars manyfestyd and maid opynet confundyt / for jesus christ says in the
gospel. Nichil opertu^ quod non reueletur / nec absconditu^ quod no^ sciatur.
That is to say / that thayr yes no thing so cowert bot yt shall be reweyllyt and
dyscowert before god of the day of judgment general / no thing so yd et Wnknowyn
bot yt shall be than knowyn opynnly et appeyr.

The.xij. sing is that the sterys shall fall of the hewyn et the bestys shall be

THe.xij. sing shall be that the steryes shall fall of heuyn For all the sterys of
the hewyn et planettys that mowys thaylles in the mayner of sperys of fire
byrnant the qwych shall be horrybyl to se. Et the Way et rayson of this all the
bestys of the earth shall gadder to gydder i^ the feyldys With out eyttyng or
drynkyng and they shall cry horrybyly et showt dreydfully. Et of the sterys yt
is Wryttyn in sant mathow in the.xiiij. cheptur Stelle cade^t decelo et
virtutes celorum mouelentur. This may be Wndersto^dyt that they shall not be
seyn of the hewyn nor than they War fallyn of hewyn. Et after sa^t ambroyes
sant ierom and the Wenerabyl be demay be Wnderstondyt that the soon and the
noon et other lyghthys of the hewyn shall be dyrk not be les making of their
light / bot for the prese^s of soon of iustyes that is of the rede^ptur qwen he
shall cu^ to is judgment in the present of the soonet the moon shall be lyk to be
With out any light. Et for that says joel the prophet in the segund cheptur.
Sol conuertetur in tenebras et luna in sanguinem antequam veniat dies magnues
and horribilies. That is to say be so that god shall cu^ to hald is judgment
general of the soon shall be towrnyt i^ dyrknes et the mown shall be dyrk et reed
in the mayner of blood so as yt is Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the.vj.
cheptur. Sol factus est niger quasi saccus silicinus and luna facta est sicut
sanguis et stelle cadent super terram. That is to say on that day et tokyn
merweyllows the soon shall be dryk et blak to the mayner of oon sek of penna^s
ghanant to put the aws et the mown shall be reyd as blood in the qwcyche is
ghewyn to Wndersto^d that all the hewynly bodies seand the eynd of the vorld for

lamentacyon so as doys the seruans of oon hows planys and Wepys and cloythys
them of blak clothyngs qwe^ their lord and master is deyd. Et qwen he says that
the sterys of the hewyn shall fall to the earth in the qwych they shall be corumpyt
et maid of noght / yt is ghanant to Wndersto^d that great et merweyllows
flawghtys certain Wapewrs and smokys in the above party of the air shall ryn et
mow selfwayes in the law partys sych lyk yt ma not be lyghtnyt bot the sterys
fallys of the hye. Et certa^ly qwen yt is said that the vertus that is to say
the angels et the bleshyt spretys hewyn shall moyf and trymbyl on the day of
judgment / yt is to Wnderstond of the mowyng of rewerans and not of dreyd that
they have to be damnyt or to suffer any pain / bot qwen they shall se the
majesty of the judge cu^mand to the iugem^t et is great et inperyal autoryte the
qwych they shall see grayth him dreydabyl ageyns them that are damnyt they shall
feyl little of them et shall meyk the^ before god so as they had being ordaynyt i^
dreyd. Et thyes may be ordaynyt that the said angels et bleshyt espretys of god
shall mow them for to fulfill the admynastracyo^ et dylyge^s the godly Will in so
mooch as yt twechys the rysyng of the bodies et other goyeng a for the said
judgment general. Et yt is to not that god shall send the above said sing of the
fallyn of the sterys i^ sing et dreyd of the^ qwych ar falling from the unity
of the holy faith / of the qwych prosperyte et aduersyte as drawyng them from
the serwys of god. God shall send in the self day oon sing above the bestys the
qwych shall another eyt no drynk as said is. Et this in oon fyng of d^eyd to the^
unhappy Worldly okerers and lyche rows and other synnares the qwych ar full of
fleshly lowst the quych as not fownd no gowst in the spyrytwels thyngys /
suffrages monysyngys of owr mother the holy church.

The.xiij. sing that goys be for the judgment general of god that al men Women

THe.xiii. tokyn shall go afor the judgment generaal of god is et shall be is that

Wepyngys and right soyr sobbyngyes the qwych void Weyl consider this et

Qwhat may oon heart pytows and Wrechyt thynk in yt self for to ymagyn the tyngys

shall e do in this day that all the men and Women et al creatur lyuant With out

sowdanly shall die. Their is no Wnderstondyng of ma^kynd that may thynk the great

qwych may.

The.xiiij. sing shall be of the fire qwych shall byrn the hewyn et the eerth and
generaly all that qwych shall be above the eyrth.


THe. xiiij. sing that go yes before the above said day of judgment general of
god shall be that in this day the hewyn et the earth shall byrn et all the elymens
et generally / all that they qwych shall be above the earth / as bodies of me^ et of
Women the qwych shall be byrnt et shall be Westyt in aws after this qwych is said
and Wryttyn in genesy in the thryd cheptur. Puluis es et in puluerem
reuerteris. et cetera. Et of the above said resolucyon of the bewyn and of the
earth is Wryttyn in sant mathow i^ the.xiiij cheptur Celu^ et terra tra^sibu^t
Et thyes above said fire of flagracyo^ says the spalmyst david qwen he says.
Ignis ante eu^ precedet. That is to say that the fire of conflagracyon shall go
before the cu^myng of owr redemptur cu^myng to is judgment general the qwych
fyet shall be gretunly great. For be the godly might not oonly the fire qwych is
i^ the spyer bot With that all the fyers qwych ar i^ the earth above shall be
rynnant to gydder for to byrn the World. Et so as says the docturs that fire
shall have the offys of the fyerryes that is to say the offys of the fire of hell
punyshant the^ that are ewyl. The offys of the fire of eerth Waystant et byrnant
all the thyngys of live et sensybyls as treys herbs beyftys and generally al
erthly thyngys. For yt shall be put i^ aws all the bodies of men et Women yt shall
hawe the offys of fire of the elymens et shall clenge and shall rewolf the
elymens dysposant them to certain innouacyon. et their is no dowt bot the deyd
of this fire shall be followyng for yt shall be beginning myddys and eynd. The
said fire shall go about all the World and clenge the elymens oouly of their
Wncleynes the qwych they have had in them for the myxyng of oonfatnes and
dyrknes the qwych they have now contrayt by the synnys et infeccyons of men
qwych as pollud et filled et i^feckyt their habytacyon. For the men fylyes et
infeckys all the creaturs of the qwych they Ws. Et for that We may beleyf
lysumly rayssonnably that the said fire of conflagracyon cleengyng of the World
shall assend also hey as the smok of the wekyt sacryfys of ydols et mawmens and
also hye as the fylth and infeccyon of crymys and synnys of men that are
ascendyt. Et shall asse^d also the said fire for to cleeng et extermyn the said
infeccyo^s Et certanly all the elyme^s shall be be said fire of conflagracyo^ sych
Wys clengent that al dyrknes / et Wncleynes et infeccyons shall be put away from
the air et also of other elyme^s. Et for that qwe^ the salwyowe and rede^ptur
says that the hewyn et the eerth shall part et perysh yt is to Wnderstond
holyly. For they shall not perysh as to their fulstans the qwych is in
corruptybyl / bot after sum dysposycyo^ les parfyt i^ oon / i^ other mor parfyt
/ for the said fire shall ascend.xv. cowttys above the most heast montayn of the
World so as did the Watyr of the dyluge thayr to that yt may clenge the said
party above of the air of fylthys et Wncleynes. Vapwrs and smok the qwych the
synnars as doyn et said syndry synnys. Et be thyes Way et the hewyn and the air
shall be cleengyt as said is.

Bot the sperys of the hewyn shall not perysh be no mayneyr be the said fire aes
to the nessayr clengyng Always the prophet says. Ipsi peribu^t tu aute^ perma
/ nes. It is to Wnderstond that the said hewyn shall perysh not as said is as to
their sbustans incorruptybyl bot they shall perysh after su^dysposicyon and
cha^gyng of their estayt of the^ i^ the qwych they are now the qwych shall not be
than mor neyd full. For the said sperys mowys now of oon plays in oon other
continuelly and they shall be than et abayd Wnmowabyl in that day after the that
no^byr of choysyn men shall be perfytyt and fulfyllyd so as I have exposyt and
tra^slatyt after master nicolaes de lira in the tra^slacyon that he as maid
above the sawltyer in the psalm oon hondreth et oon. They may mayk heyr syndry
fair qwestyons the qwych I leyf for the present and for cause of shortness.

The.xv. and last sing is the bodies of men et Women shall rys that Was deyd for
to cum to the judgment general of god.


THe.xv. et last cheptur et sing shall be that the hewynnys and the earth shall be
to the mayner that I have said heyr before. Et that all the men et Women shall cum
to the judgment. Et as to the first party as to the above said renewyng says
sant thomas that the elemens shall be renewyt for ressauyng of su^ clayr te for
the earth shall be cleyn and cleyr in the owtwart party as glass and the Water as
crystal. Et the air is the hewyn and fire as the body lyghtys of hewyn. Et as
to the regard of hewyn and hewynly speyrs their shall be no other renewyng vyth
out yt be they shall ces of their mowyng et shall abayd in their placys sekyr
Wnmowabyl. Et Werytably the above said fire of co^flagracyon and byrnyng above
said shall byrn all the bodies of me^ et Women the qwych yt shall find be they
lyuant or deyd be they good or ewyl For thayr shall be dyfferens for yt shall
gheue pain sensatyf to them that are ewyl / bo yt shall do no pain to the^ that are good the qwych yt shall not find to cle^ge no mor than the fire of the
furnays that did no ewyl to the three chyldryn the qwych Was put With i^ the
fornays of byrnant fire so as yt apperys in daniel in the.iij. cheqtur Bot the
good the qwych yt shall find any thing to cleenge yt shall mayk the^ sum dolewr
and pain after that they have mor or les neyd to be clengyd Et verytably the
said fire of conflagracyo^ may cle^ge at onys yt that shall be to cleenge / for
the said fire shall recowyr in actywyte thyes that yt is lost in induracyon. Et
vold not obey be sum that this We have said incontinent heyr before shall be
contrary to thyes that We have said that the.xiij. day al them lyuant shall die
men and Women and as this cause the fire of conflagracyon shall not find noon
above the eyrth lyuant. Certanly this maykys no thing for as I have said heyr
before no man Wnderstondys the said syngys bot god if the said syngys commys oon
after oon ofter With out any goyeng ettwys the said syngyes Or if thayr shall
cum syndry in oon day / for this incertayn et vnknowyn. Et for that may yt be
that at the howr of the said fire of cleengyng shall cum and that yt shall put to
deeth them that are lywand et that yt shall Wayst them i^ powdyr and aws so as
said is. Et as this cause yt ghanys not to say no to afferin that the said
syngys shall cum so be.xv. days oon after oon other as sant ierom says as he as
fund the^ i^ the cronyks et annels of hebrews for he affermyes yt not him self
Bot veyl ve may say that the synges above said or the most part of them and
pryncypally they qwych ar aprewyt by the text of the holy gospel shall cum
vndowtably. Et that the vorld shall be byrnt and the eleme^s clengyd as said is /
et also that the bodies of al them that deyd shall rys. Et verytably the fire
above said after the judgment shall tayk them that shall be da^nyt et al this that
shall be With in the said fire of byrnyng of hotnes of gretnes shall dyscend in
hell for to punysh the said da^net pewpyl. Et this that is in the said fire of
clarte shall abayd in hye in the gloyr of bleshyd and chosyn men. Et this
apperys that fire above said shall go afor the cu^myng of the judge the qwych
shall follow in syndry mayners self Wys al this qwych shall be of dyrknes of
bytternes in the air / of byrternes / that is sawlt in the Watyr of hewynes /
and dyrknes i^ the earth shall be purgyt shall be cleengyt be the said fire and
shall be castyng in hell for to punysh the da^nyt pewpyl. Et for this that the men
shall have no mor myster no neyd of bestys / of treys and other thyngyes
vegetaty wys and sensatyfs shall all the above said thing be corru^pyt and maid
noght not oonly aes to the matter bot With that as to the form. Et this suffycys
as to the segund party in the qwych I have promised to traytte et determ of the
syngyes the qwych shall go afor the judgment general of god the maykar and the
redemptur.

The thryd party of this present traytte contenys al et be al shortly the form
et mayner of the judgment general of god.


GOod and faithful crystyn me^ should Wnderstond by the symbol of the faith the
qwych sympyl pewpyl callys the credo in deum. The qwych ewyrych oon shoold
leyrn under the pain of ewyrlestand da^nacyon that owr salwyowr et redemptur
shall cu^ to is judgment above said to judge the qwyk bot and the deet good and
ewyl in the qwych judgment shall be gheuyn to ewyrych oon after their good Werkys
and ewyl Werkys / and yt shall be i^ the tym above said qwen the said redemptur
shall cum With great might in the tym of iustys i^ the qwych their shall be no

the.x. cheptur qweyr he says that he saw oon angel dyscenda^t of the hewyn the
qwych put is right fowt above these et is Wrong fowt above the earth et swor be
the god lyuant in the World of varldys that the tym shall be no mor / qweyr the
glos exposys that the tym of meyrcy shall not be mor bot the tym of judgment et
of iustys. Says ower that.vij. thondryes did speyk to him the qwych shoold be
Wndersto^di.vij. Wrechydnes the qwych shall fall upon the day of judgment above
them that are dampnyt. Et of contrary.vij. specyal joys the qwych shall have the

Wnderstond the royssyng of the bodies of men and vome^ that are decessyt For
after that the said clengyng of the World maid be fire et that the rede^ptur

great sowndyng the qwych shall gadder all the choysyn me^ and freyndyes of god
qwych as beyn byrnyt in aws in all the.iiij. partys of the World / yt is the
text of sant mathow i^ the.xxiiij. cheptur. Mittet a^gelos cu^ tuba. etc. qui

Oe^s quide^ resurgemus Et verytably this tro^pet shall sownd dreydfully of the

that I heyr the voys of the last tro^pet of the iugem^t of god the qwych

oon sensybylvoys and oon co^ma^deme^t calla^d of jesus christ by the qwych he

crysostom that this voys of this small tro^pet horrybyl to the qwych all the

Et this ordyr shall be gheuyn and delyueryt to the dewyl With out any mercy and

they part of this after the Word of sant ioon. Qui no^ credit ia^ iudi catus

fornays of the byrnant fire ofhel qweyr their shall be vepyngs sorows / and i^
nowmerabyl paynys so as We have said i^ the traytte of the paynys of hell. By
the thryd tho^dyr of the qwych says sant ioon in the appocalyps in the plays
aforsayd We shoold Wnderstond the merweyllows syngys and toknys of the passion
the qwych shall brought With him to is right dreydabyl judgment. For he shall
shaw to all the creatures rayssonabyle that as beyn sen the beginning of the
World Wn to the said howr the to kyns of is passyo^ qwych shall be mor cleyr than

holy and Worthy Woondys the qwych he has suffert for Ws so as says crystom
above sant mathow the qwych says that he shall shaw the said tokyns to damnyt
pewpyl thayr to that they Wnderstond how they shall be iustyly damnyt for that
they have desprysyt the pryes of is blood so precyowes Certanly as says the
said crystom jesus christ shall repreyf the^ I have taykyn humanyte for the low

serwys and the reward that e have gheuyn to me for the prys of my blood. Et
than all the pewpyl of the earth shall plain and cast mowrnygs above them self.
Pryncypaly the sarrayns and the iowys the qwych shall plane that ewyr they
traytyt owr lord jesus christ so carlysly Et the false crystyn men shall plain of
this that they have gheuyn the ewyl for much gooddys to the^ doyn be the

peyr cyt Tho qwych as beyn opynyt for to resayff you and e Would not enter.
Behold my hondys the qwych as beyn nalyt i^ the cors for to embrays you and to

shoold have him to do pennans qwyl he lyuys thayr to that he may be boght of
the precyows blood of owr salwyowr and rede^ptur jesus christ et that he be not
of the nombyr and ordyr of da^nyt Et yt is to not that jesus christ shall shaw the
said and Woondys to good pewpyl to the great joy et honowr of the^ / et to the
ewyl to their dreyd and confusyon. Et first to Wnthankful men the qwych as not
thankyt him et lowyt him of his passion for ewyrych oon shoold thank him this
did sant ambros Plus eni^ domine jesus debeo tuis iniurijs quibus redemptus sum
quam tuis virtutibus quibus creatues su^ no^ eni^ hoc prodesset nisi read mi
profuisset That is to say Lord jesus christ I am mor holdyng to the reprewyngyes
Wrongys the qwych thou as suffert in thy passion be the qwych thou as boght me
no I am to the Wertus qwych thou as maid me / for to be maid yt had not proffit
to me and if I had not beyn redemyt. Et Weraly the meditacyon of the passion is
right frutwows to manet thankful to god. This Wytnysys sant bernard qwen he
says. Their is no thing of so great effec for to hoyl the Woondys of the
co^scyens as for to have pardon of his syn and to have contynuel medytacyon and
mind of the Woondys of jesus christ. Segundly the rede^ptur shall shaw is precyows
crown of thoornys to prydful pewpyl the qwych as offencyt by ornymens / hattys
/ hayr / and other arraymens of thayr hedys and generally by oyssolut thyngys
the qwych they have put above their hedys for to pleas to the World With out
they have had mind of the sharp and rygh pyckant crown of thornys the qwych the
rede^ptur did beyr above yes heyd for them The thryd Ways he shall shaw the
speyr passion to yerful pewpyl and to enwyows pewpyl / the qwych as trowblyt

aduersyte and sorrowful of the prosperyte of their said prochayns. Of the qwych
enwyows says seneca. To my Will that all the enwyowes of the vorld had their eyn

peyrs them of all the felycytys of the et prosperytes the qwych they say to men

lycherowes men and Women as fowlfyllyt to the lowstys of their bodies and fylyt
their bodies and their saowlys dystroyt their goodys and shortyt their live
With out that they have chastyt their body by penite^s or co^tine^s The.viij.

concupyssens / of the qwych spekys crysosto^ qwen he says that they qwych
grathys the^ thayr to that they draw other to syn shall sowsteyn the ewyrlestand
judgment for they syn deydly. The.ix. the rede^ptur shall shaw to the false lears
and marchans et other falsmen of the World the great cloyth of the qwych is
precyows eyn War bandyt / the qwych strenthys them self in so mooch is yt is to

blahpemyngys et mensworn othys thayr marcha^dys the qwych is right ewyl the
qwych they mayk good and voorth the prys so as god had no Wnderstondyng of yt.
The.x. the redemptur shall shaw the cordyes of the qwych he Was bownd be the
handys et be the armies to them qwych by brasyng et twechyng prowokys them and
other to fleshly lowst. The rede^ptur shall haw the gal and the Wynagyr of the
qwych yt Was gheuyn him in the cors to glowto^s et dronkars the qwych as Wakyt
in this World to glotonny and dronknes of the qwych he says in sant luc in
the.vj. cheptur Vobis qui saturati estis. Of the qwych says sant ierosm It is
inpossybyl to the glowtons of this World to fyl heyr thar Waam and thayr saowl
in paradys. Et sant bernard says. That he that is fed and full in this World of
the bodyly lowstys and esemens is Wnwoorthy to be fed of the spyrytwel meyttys
of paradyes. Et sa^t ambros says dronkars confundys and howrtys nature / they
leys the grays of god / the gloyr of paradys / et rynnys in ewyrlestand
damnacyon. The.xij. the rede^ptur shall shaw on the day of judgment the spyttyng
of the qwych is gloryows fays Was fylyt and maid blak the day of is passion and
this he shall shaw to the^ qwych makys the^ fair be art for to pleys and gheue
occasyon of syn and qwych Would mayk them farer than god as maid the^ of the
qwych says sant ambros / Deles picturam dei si Wltum tuum naturali candore ob

fire of hell The.xiij. Way owr redemptur shall shaw is precyows hayr et bayrd the
qwych vas drawyng frorn him the day of this passion. Et this shall he doyn to
the^ that as thayr hayr cowloryt and payntyt and also cowrlys thayr hayr for
ewyl eynd. Et the Women the qwych dyscowers their heydys et lactys their hayr
fall done for to draw men to syn. The.iiij. Way the redemptur shall shaw the dies
to howr masters and players the qwych has playt be awaryes et Wrechydnes et as
dyssawyt their nyghtbowrs be tro^perys rewyngs and be other plays that are
Wnlysum for the inte^cyon to dyssayf the said nyghtbowrs i^ powyrte for cause of
proffyt te^porel / for sych play is no other thing bot oon spoyllyng and rewyng
and for that no man may acqwyr lysu^ly any thing. Et With great pain may be maid
sych play With out deydly syn pryncypally qwen they play by awarys / for awarys
is of the self deydly syn et ar sych pewpyl holdyn to restytucyon. The.xv
mayner et finally the rede^ptur shall shaw the pennys for the qwych he Was sald
and this shall be doyn to the okerers qwych has possessyon vnryghtusly of the
gooddys of others and makys no restytwcyon. Helas qwat shall say oon sych mayner
of pewpyl the day of judgment thought yt be so that Judas as restowryt the.xxx.
pennys for the qwyche he had saold the redemptur to the iowys by awarys o
cwrsyt Wrechyd okerers theyssys et Wrechyt pewpyl sacrylegys and other Wnlysum
haldars the qwych holdys Wyttanly the gooddys of others With out they mayk
restytucyon / of the qwych is Wryttyn in the decret. Vsurarius non vere penitet
nisi prius vsuras restituat.xiiij. questione.iiij. Quid dicam. That is to say
that the okerer makys not faithful pennans With out that he mayk first
restytucyon of the okyr. Rayson. For that says saint Augustyn in the rewl of
the right Weyl co^mun rygh certain and Wnfaylant. Peccatum non dimittuur nisi
restituatur ablatum. et cetera. That is to say / that syn is newyr for ghewyn
bot first the thing ewyl taykyn be restoryt

Et certanly in the said merweyllows day of yer and of Wrechydnes right
dowtabyl to al creatwrys after that god the maykar Redemptur and salwy owr jesus
christ as shawyng the above said thyngys he shall ash cownt and rekynnyng and
rayson of the^ the qwych he shall judge first of their thoghttys after this qwych
is Wryttyn in the book of sapyens in the first cheptur. as he Would say / e.
This consyderys not they that dancys et leyppys be ewyl intencyon / et they
that goys and towrnys at their pleysane and fleshly lowftys Et certa^ly they
most gheue reke^nyng to god of al twychyng and Wnfysum seeing and of the thyngys
Wnlysum hard. Et also he most gheue rekynnyng of the gyftys of the body of the
fors / owtheyd et of the heelth and bodyly fayrnes. Et generaly he most gheue
rekynnyng of al bodyly Werkys / that is to say how maynay tymys We have beyn
dronkyn / how maynay tymys We have doyn the syn of lychery et of the flesh
forth of marriage / et at how maynay dancys We have fowlyshly dancyt / how
maynay tymys We have smyttyng owr propyr Wife or othyr men be ire be Wengens and
so of other Werkys. The.iiij. et pryncypally We most gheue cownt of temporel
thyngys in three mayners. First in thou ewyr ych oon as Won the temporel thyngys
the qwych he possedys in this World Wnto the lacter penny. That is to
Wnderstond / if he Wonnys them ryghtwsly or Wnryghtwsly / et certanly We may
not acqwyr riches With out fyn. For the appoystyl says they the qwych Would be
maid rych fallys i^ the nettys of the dewyl of hell. Segundly ewyr ych oon shall
gheue rekynnyng in the judgment of the temporel thyngys / that is to Wnderstond
/ how he has spendyt them Wnto the lacter penny / this shoold they thynk and
have before thayr eyn the glow tons that qwych dyspendys so maynay pennys i^ Wyn
in meyt ower habowndant and superflew qwych ar sumtymys from the morning Wnto
mydnyght and sumtymys all the night in tawernys for to fyl them of Wyn et
superflew exces / of the qwych they shall gheue oon strayt rekynnyng. Et for
this cause ewyr ych oon crystyn man dredant et lowand god shoold newyr drynk vyn
With out caves of necessyte and proffyt bot shoold ewyr drynkant et eyttand
seyk thayr sustentacyon et confortacyon of natwr. Of this says sant angustyn i^
the book of the Woordys of owr lord qwen he says if thou eyttys and drynkys for
the refeccyon and sustentacyon of this me^byrs gheuant thank to god thy meyt
and drynk lowys god. Et the prydful pewpyl qwych dispendys their goodys in pride
et superflewyte of clothyng great tayllys and large / and large slewys / and
haua^t pluralyte of cloythyng by pomp or pride et be ewyl eynd. Et they qwych
dyspendys thayr gooddys in Wnlysum plays most gheue cownt et rekynnyng before
god on the day of judgment. For un fayllantly oon man or oon Woman qwyche
spendys so ewylly thayr goodys suppos that they have Won them justly and that
he has acquyryd them ryghtusly they may Weyl be damnyt. This prewys clearly the
text of the gospel in saint Luc in the xvj. cheptur of the ewyl rych qwych
drank et eyt habowndandly With great superflewyte et Was clothyt of purpor. Et
yt makys no mencyon that he Was oon okerer no howr master bot oonly that he
dyspendyt is goodys ewylly and that he had not holpyt to the powyr lypper man
of that qwych he dyspendyt i^ superflewytys / et for this cause he is grawyt in
hell. Crysostom above saint Mathow says. Thou as taykyn the riches not thayr to
that thou Wayst them bot thayr to that thou gheue them in almows. The goodys
that thou as appartenys to the powyr pewpyl bot god as lent them the oonly / et
had thou conqwest them by thy ryghtus labowres or if they War fallyn to the by
succession or herytayge of thy parens. Certa^ly yt is oon also great syn to deny
the almows to him that as myster as yt is to rob the goodys of other so as says
saint Ambroys. The thryd mayner We shall gheue cownt of the goodys lewyt be Ws
to howr hoyrs and of the mayner to leyf them / for yt War better to leyf them
noght than to leyf pledyng and process / for that for sych process enge^drys enwy
ettwys the hoyrs the qwych process noys to the saowl of him that is decessyt /
for he shall be by this prywydyt of the suffragys of his freyndys. Et the said
saowl shall be punyshyt be this et of this that be his Wre chydnes he as not
soonnar dysposyt of is goodys. Et as this cause cwyrychoon shoold have before is
eyn the saw of Esaye the prophet sayand to the king Eechyas. Dispone domui tue
quia morieris tu et no^viues. Dyspoyn of thy hows and of thy goodys for thou
shall die et leyf no mor. Also We shall gheue rekynnyng and cownt on the day of
judgment of them of the qwych We have drawyng to syn by Word or by ewyl exampyl
or be fayrnes or by grathyng of the bodyly arrayment. We shall also gheue cownt
and rekynnyng ewyr ych oon of is craft and negocyacyon / of tromperys et
dyssauyngs by Weght or by mesur et gn^aly of al malys dyssauyngs and new
inwencyons drawyng to syn. We shall gheue cownt et rekynnyng of the sugges also
Weyl in byshopryk et Worthynes of the church as otherwys

We shall gheue rekynnyng ewyr ych oon of the estayt of the qwyche ewyrychoon as
lewyt be yt of marriage / or of Wedowheyd / or of vyergynyte / or otherwys / or
of relygyon. Et also ve shall gheue rekynnyng of the goodys of the qwyche We
have left to do. Et yt suffys not to do no ewyl bot that he did sum good for he
qwych Would do so shall be da^nyt. A malo abstinere no^ sufficit nisi faciat quis
quod bonum est. de pe. ca. Cupie^tes in cle. Et the psalmyst says. Declina a
malo et fac bonum.

Fynaly yt is neydful to Ws to gheue rekynnyng of the tym of the qwyche We
lyuyt in this World and how they have spendyt thayr tym after saint Bernard for
ewyrychoon shall gheue rayson of all the earrys months Weykys days howrrys et
momens in the qwych he as lyuyt sen he as had Wsayge of rayson

Helas o synnar parawantwr thou as lyuyt.lx. earrys et in all this tym of the
qwych thou as not seruyt.iij. ear faithfully to god. Qwhat shoold thou do I
answeyr to the that thou shoold have oon great displaysa^s et contrycyon to so
ewylly have spendyt thy tym et shryue the right meykly. For after saint bernard
thayr is no thing mor precyows than the tym helas and et oon hondreth tym helas
/ for thayr is fond the day no thing mor fylful in the live of syndry Warldly
men for the days of pe^nans and of salut passys dyrkly et they go et no parson
thynkys of the^ We reyd of oon holy man that had ewyr be syd him oon horlege
and so soon as he hard the howr smyt he said to god. O my lord and maker thayr
is oon howr of my tym passyt qwych thou as ghewyn me for to serwe and low the
of the qwych I shoold gheue the rekynnyng pleysyt the for to forgheue me my
neclygens of this that I have not so Weyl spendyt the tym as I shoold have
doyeng / so shoold ewyrch oon good crystyn to do so. et all the day at the last
at ewyn qwen he shoold rest shoold thynk how he as spendyt the day. For the
damnyt pewpyl in hell pleynes abowe al thing thus that they hawe ewyl spendyt
the tym of grace Et in the book of semtemplycy timore We reyd of oon deuoyt
holy man that Was oon day in orayson et he hard oon Woys the qwych Was right
myserabyl fowl of terys et of sobbyngys at the qwych the holy man ashyt / qwat
yt Was / and the said Woys answeryt I am oon da^pnyt saowl et also Weyl I as al
other damnyt saowllys We mowrn not et conplaynes not of thing so much no mor as
We do of the tym of grace the qwych We have lost et spendyt yt in synnys. For
in that tym We might in oon howr repent us of owr sinnyes and have shewyt
ewyrlestand damnacyon in the qwych We are now by neglyge^s et for that We have
ewyl spendyt owrtym. By the.iiij. thondyr of the qyych spekys Sant Ioon
appocallyps We shoold Wnderstond the Wytnes the qwych synnars has ageynes the^
in the day of judgment. For the first Wytnes and accusurs of the synnyes shall be
thayr propyr synnys after jeremy that says i^ the segund cheptur. Arguet te
malicia tua. That is to say cursyt synnar thy malys and syn shall repreyf the
oon the day of judgment / for the Werkys of synnars shall follow the^ after the
saw of sa^t bernard qwych says that the Werkys of the synnys of men shall say to
them on the day of judgment. Tunos egisti. et cetera. That is to say thou as
maid Ws We are thy verkys vald thou or not thou may not yed Ws this day / for ve
shall not leyf the / bot We shall go With the in the judgment and excus the as
culpabyl of syndry crymys and synnys. Et certanly the propyr conscyens of the
man shall be Wytnes of is damnacyon after the say of the appoystyl i^ the pystyl
qwych is vryttyn to the romans. Testimonium reddite illis co^sciencia illorum.
The segund Wytnes et excusator of synnars of the said day of judgment shall be
the dewyl qwych shall rehers all the ewyl et synnys the qwych they did ewyr of
the qwych they have not doyn pennans after sant augustyn qwych says. Presto
erit diabolus. et cetera. That yes to say the dewyl shall be reddy the qwych shall
rehers al this that they have doyn / in qwat day in qwat howr i^ qwat plays
Than he shall shaw to the synnars al their ewyl thought is lycherows / yrful /
and al this qwych We have synnyt / sayand blasphemant detractant / myssayant
leant / scornant / et / prouoca^t / to ire. He shall reheres all the Werkys of
the body the fowt steppys / the loppyngys the seyngys / the ^wechyngys and al
theshaamful Werkys et lycherows. He shall accus all the synnars of the syn of
co^myssyo^ how maynay messees how maynay preshyngys as left With out lawful
cause how maynay fastyngys they have lost how maynay hallow days they have not
dewoytly seruyt god how maynay veyrkyes of meyrcy they have not doyn no
fufyllyt. For than the dewyl shall say the qwych ies e^nemy of ma^kynd to god
the makar. Oryght judge iugye to my by thy sentens dyffynyt if this synnar to be
mine by culp the qwych Would no be thyn be grace He as beyn to the desobeyant and
he as beyn to me obeyant. He as left thy cleythyng and he is heyr cum cled of
my cleythyng. Et as to this cause yt is raysson that he bowrn With me in the
fire of ewyrlestand damnacyon. The thryd excusur the qwych shall excus the
synnar on the day of judgment before god shall be all the vorld and With all the
creatures of yt of this says sant gregoyr spekand to the synnar. Et if thou
ashes at me qwo shall excus the oon the day of judgment I answer that all the
World. For the earth shall say. O cursyt synnar thou as goyn above me With thy

vatyr shall say I have seruyt the of drynk qwe^ two aes had thryst I have serwyt

et gheuyn the light for to lythnyng the ghewe cownt of thy Wnthankfulnes of
this that thou as not thankyt god the makar. Crysostom says lhayr is no thing
that ve may say of the day of judgment the qwych / the soon / the mown / et the
earth the days et the night and all the vorld shall be ageyns the synnars et Wytnes
of there inyqwytys et synnys. Et as thyes cause says sa^t gregoyr so much the
Ways shall be strayt et da^gerows to synnars or the said day of judgment qwen
they shall se the judge above the^ and hell horrybyl Wnder their feyt at thayr
right hand thayr synnys qwych shall excus them / at their left hand Wnnomerabyl

/ veyl shoold ewirych dreyd the above said thondyr of the iustys of god and be
good Werkys We may do so much that We may be of the nombyr of the bleshyt the
qwych shall be at the right hand of god the father of the qwych he shall say. Cu^

creacyon of the World. By the vij. thonder We may Wnderstond the fyndry pains
et torme^s of the^ that are damnyt and after the abowe said sentens al thoys
that are damnyt and dewyllys of hell shall fall in the qwych they shall be ewyr mor
With out eynd i^ Wnthoyllabyl paynys and fire byrna^t of the qwych ve hawe

hewyn syngant swetly and melodyowsly the qwych shall hawe ewyr mor bwt eynd joy
and glednes of the qwych We shall speyk heyr after. Et formor clearly Wnderstond
this that said is / yt is ghana^t to hald in mind that thayr is dowbyl judgment
that is to say judgment partyculeyr et judgment general judgment partyculeyr is
yt the qwych yes maid at the howr of deeth of the Wrechyt parson deyng of this
World heyr presa^t. Of the qwych says innocent in the thryd book of the fylth
of the condycyon of man / of the qwych he says oon thing much to not / that al
man be he good or ewyl before or hedy or that the saowl part of the body seys is
judge owr salwyowr et redemptur jesus christ so as he Was put in the cors. The
ewyl shall see him to thayr confusyon thayr to that they may be confundyt et
that they have shaam of this that they shall not be part taykars of the meryt of
is passion and be thayr cowlp the precyows blood of jesus christ as not brought
them the fruit of redempcyon in the qwych is ghewyn to Wnderstond that the
iugemnt of the saowl is doyn before that yt part of the body. Et for that qwych
is Wryttyn. Viderunt in quem pupugerunt. That is to say the damnyt shall see the
redemptur ageyns the qwych they have doyn et maid the pykyngyes of blaphemyng
and other synnys / yt shoold be Wnderstond also much of the judgment general of
the qwych We have said heyr before as of the judgment partyculeyr the qwych is
oon the day that the parson dyscessys so as says innocent et of the self
judgment partyculeyr yt is Wryttyn in sant luc in the.xij. cheptur. Estote
parati quia qua hora non putatis filius hominis veniet. Be e grathyt and ready
for jesus christ the soon of the Wyergyn mary shall cum to the judgment
partyculeyr at the howr that We shall not be War of owr self. The judgment the
qwych ve have spokyn heyr before Weyl at lenght yt is yt in the qwych al men et
Women shall be iugyt after the saw of the appoystyl in the pystylqwych yes
Writtyn to the corinthye^s. Omnees nos manifestari oportet ante tribunal
cristi. et cetera. That is to say We be hows to compeyr be for the trown of
christ al me^ and Women at onys thayr to that ych oon resayf is reward of is
propyr Werkys after the qwych he has doyn i^ this World good or ewyl. Et
Werytably the said judgment shall be maid in the air above the vala of iosaphat
in the plays qwych jesus christ ascendyt to the hewyn so as yt is Wryttyn in joel
in the segund cheptur in the parson of the redemptur. Congregabo omnes gentes
et adducem eos in vallem iosaphat et ibi sedebo vt iudice^ omnes gentes. That
is to say I shall gaddyr al mayner of pewpyl et I shall leyd the^ i^ the Walla of
iosaphat and I shall set thayr to that I may judge the^ Et verytably aes said yes
the said judgment shall be at the eynd of the vorld bot the day and the howr ar
incertayn and parson Wndersto^dys yt not bot god oonly Sum Would have said that
yt shall be maid at mydnyght for this that yt is Wryttyn in sa^t mathow. Media
nocte clamor factus est ecce sponsus veniet. The others Would say that yt shall be
maid in the morning et allegys the spalmyst. In matutino interficiam omnes
peccatores terre. Bot sant augustyn says that the judgment shall be doyn qwen no
men shall be War of them self also says sant mathow. Vigilate quia nescitys die^
neque horam. Heyr they may ash oon qwestyon if the cowlp of men or Women
shall be dyscouert and maid opynon the day of judgment and if the syn of oon
shall be knowyn to oon other also Weyl the synnys shryuyn as Wnshryuyn. Of this
matyr Wryttys gloryowsly the gloryows sans thomas abowe the.iiij. of the
sentens / et also doys rychart Et for to answer to the qwestyon yt is ghana^t
to not that oon sente^s dyffinytyf co^da^nent or rewardant may no be just if yt
be not ghewyn after the good deydys or ewyl deydys of the^ or ageyns the^ of
the qwych yt is ghewyn to. Et as this cause so as yt appartenys that the judge et
is accessewrs before that the sentens be prononcyt that they Wnderstond of the
good dedys or ewyl dedys and the cause / sychlyk yt is ghana^t that yt be so on
the day of judgment general of god / that is that be for that the sentenes of
god co^da^notoyr of ewyl and prymatyf of good may be said ce^syt no repwtyt
iowst that the holy accesseurs and assystans Wndersto^dant the good deydys et
ewyl dedys of them qwych shall be iugyd Et that also as the reward et damnacyon
of ewyr ychoon shall be known of is merytyes or dysmerytyes of the cause sychlyk
yt shall be knouyng to all the assystans. Et so as god shall bring to mind to oon
ewyrych oon is good dedys and is meryttys or demeryttys put before thayr eyn of
oon ewyrych assystant in the said judgment. Et this opinion is the most common
thought be yt is so that the master of the sentens is lyk to say the contrary
that is to say that the synnys the qwych as beyn put away by pennans shall not
appeyr on the day of judgment. For after sant thomas We shoold Wndersto^d that
the synnys of ryghtus men of the qwych as doyn pennans shall not cum to the
Wndersto^dyng of other as synnys punyshabyl that is to say to be punyshyt. Bot
as synnys that is for gheuyn and put a Way of this thayr shall follow no pain to
right tusmen bot thayr to shall fallow gloyr. Et so shoold be Wnderstondyt of
synnys shryuyn and for ghewyn to be cowert on the day of judgment for that they
shall not gheue no rekynnyng no cownt and that god seys no mor as to this that
he Will not that the they be punyshyt of any pain bot he shall Will Weyl that they
said synnys be occurre^t to the consyderacyon of ewyrych oon thayr to that all the ryghtues men that seyes thyes may love god of this that they have showyt
the pains that War awyn for the said synnys by the penna^s the qwych they have
doing in this World. Et be this that said is We may conclud that all the good
dedys and ewyl dedyes of ewyrych oon shall be maynyfest that to say al seyn
opynly on the day of judgment be for jesus christ right judge / before the angels
and before the men. God by is grace Weyl that We be of the party of iowst men
and faithful men and that We may ascend in gloyr of hewyn in gloryows body qwen
the above said day of judgment shall cu^ thayr to that We may ewyrlestandly lowf
and thank god in the joys of hewyn i^estymabyl Et this suffycys as to the
thryd party of this present and short traytte in the qwych as beyn spokyn of
the great judgment general of god the makar. And prayand and reqwyrand all the
reddars and eyrars of this present book and short traytte that is said /
Wryttyn / or translatyt Et if their be any thing that War not so dewly vryttyn
that as yt apartenys / I pray them that they Would supple my feybyl
Wnderstondyng and mend yt qweyr I have faylyt and yt is oon Werk merytoyr /
bescyka^d them With meyk supplycacyo^ that if yt pleassyt them to say god have
mercy of the saowllyes of the actor translator and of their fathers mothers
parens and freyndys brether et systers good doars and Weyl Wyllars Et also of
the redars et eyrars Et that the holy trinite Would keyp them in body and saowl
that We be not confundyt oon that dredabyl day of judgment Et god gheue Ws that
grays the We be of the nombyr of the^ to the qwych god shall say. Venite
benedicti patres mei and possidete regnum paratum vobis ab inicio mundi god
grant / be not nywel Samoth. Amen.

The.iiij. et last party of this trayttyt shall trayttet of the joys of paradys


AFter this that the rede^ptur aes ghewyn the sente^s dyffynytyf and that the

for so much my brether and freyndys right deyr qwych We sowsteyn i^ powerte of

Wanyte for Weryte banyshyng and blaberyng mor than owr propyr land / powyrte /
for habondans fylth for gloyr I pray you that We comtempyl the joys of the

that We may gowst sum thing With the lyppys of the heart and that after that We

present and We shall newyr low the banyshyng of this Wrechyd pylgramage of the
World for to low owr land and herytayge hewynly bot aes right dylyge^t he good
desyrs We shall be hold to the live ewyrlesta^d of paradys Et Weraly thayr is oon
sych dyffere^s ettwys the bodyly delyttys and spyrytwels / for qwen any may not
have his delyttys bodyly yt lyghtnys and enbrasys i^ the little sensatyf oon

have beyn plenyshyt so much mor they have desyr and takys them felycyte and to
have co^tynuel fyccyon of the said vyth out noysumnes. Et as this cause they
qwych has them not they may With paynlowe for this that the saweur of the^
jesus almyngty godys ioyws et not kanowyn Et as this cause the psalmyst monysys
Ws to gowst the said joys and says. Gustate et videte quoniam suauis est
dominus / that is to say gowst / feyl and parsayf spyrytwelly / for certa^ly
the lord is right sweyt and ye ken not is sweytnes for thyes that e gow yt not.
Et Werytably so as says sant gregoyr after this that owr first father Adam Was
castyng of the joys of paradys by is demerytys and that he Was cu^yt in
powyrte of this Wrechyt World and banyshyng the qwych We suffyr now and that he
might not mor see the joys of paradys the qwych he comtemplyt afor / for he
had that cowstum he beyant in paradys terrest to Wse of the Wordys of god and
assyst by mditacyon of thought et heenes of visyon in the joys of blyshyt
spretyes / bot after thyes that he Was falling by the syn of the said estayt in
this Wrethyt banyshyng he de partyt of the above said vysyons cleennes et
cleyrte of thought. Et as this cause We other qwych ar boorn of thyes flech ve
have veyl hard in this banyshyng of the World that thayr is oon other land of
hewyn that is to say paradys and that the a^gels of god ar indwellars and that
speryts of ryghtus men perfyt followys of the said angels always the fleschy
men qwych may not know no gowst the thyngys in Wysybyls by exsperyens dowtyes
thyes that they have not feyn by the real existe^s With thayr bodyly heyn is yt
or not. The qwych dowtys indowtably yt might not be i^ owr first father for
after this that yt Was excludyt et put forth of the joys of paradys he
remenbryt him Weyl he had seyn yt that he had lost. Et certanly We may not
thynk this remenbyr no feyl for We have not the exsperyens as he had in the tym
bypassyt and has yt not oonly bot be heyr saying so as oon Woman great With
child War put i^ oon pryso^ i^ the qwych sho War lyghter of oon child et that
yt War no ryshyt in the said prison on to the tym of his adolesce^s and that
the said Woman said to her said child and that hye above the said prison War
the soonet the mown and the sterys montayns and byrdyes horse and syndry mayner
of creaturys of cowlewrs and of payntyngs / the said child eyrant this the
qwych had newyr seyn no thing bot dyrknees vold not beleyf no thing of thyes
for he has not knowing this be exsperye^s Sych lyk the men qwych ar boorn i^
blyndnes cecite et dyrknes of this Wrechyd banyshyng qwen they eyr speyk of the
hye hewynly thyngys et vnseabyl they have mystrust if they be true or not for
they have no Wndersto^dyng bot of the erthly thyngys et seabyl in the qwych
they have beyn boorn. Et as by dyspensacyon of god he as beyn maid that creatur
of seabyl thyngys et Wnseabyl com down heyr for the redemptyon of ma^kynd thayr
to that be him he War maid man seabyl We War rawyst in the i^ wysybyly^ et
vnseabyl. Et thayr is mor for he has send in owr hartys the holy gheost thayr
to that after this that We have beyn qwyknyt by him that shoold beleyf feuently
and vndowtably i^ the full faith of the holy Wryt et of the Wytnysyng of the
holy men the qwych aes beyn techyt by co^tynuel meditacyon of Wertus by the
qwych contynwel meditacyon and sowtyl conte^placyon et be the rewelacyon of god
of the qwych says sant poul the qwych Was rawst unto the.iij. hewyn thayr to
that he so leftyt shoold leyrn ettwyes a^gels the thing that he shoold preshe
ettwys the men / says in the first epoystyl the qwych he Wryttys to the
corinthiens in the segu^d. ca. Oculus no^ vidit nec auris audiuit. etc. That is
to say that Ematernal as not seyn no the heyr of man as not hard no the heart of
man can not thynk no the understanding can not comprehend all the joys the qwch
god as grathyt to them that lowys him in the gloyr et lyk to be tra^fformyt in
the godly nature and to be lyk to god be the above said dowayr qwych ^as cleyr
vysyon of the essens and cleyr te of god. We reyd that master iowrdayn brother
of the ordyr preshowrs that he vas oon day praya^d god to se and Wysy oon
synful Woman the qwych vas possessyt of the dewyl of hell. Et al so soon is the
good and deuoyt brother master iowrdayn Was cu^ before the said voman the dewyl
qwych Was in the body of the voman said to the said brother in latin / how Weyl
yt War the said voman had newyr leyrnyt no thing to spek latin et Was newyr at
the scowl. Et inco^tynent the said brother inqwyryt the said dewyl lytteraly
qweyr for he did torment the said Woman et pleysans he did tayk to abyd With in
the body of the said Women / to the qwyche the dewyl answeryt I am co^stryngyt
of my creatur to do this as this cause I may not be in other placys. Unto the
qwych iowrdayn said / say to me qwehyr thou Would be if thou had faculte to be
in other placys. The dewyl said Wnderstondyng thou art oon so greyt clerk and
doctwr of the church I Would that thou had not so symply ashyt. Bot say to me
qwhat plays thou Would be thy self if thou had facwlte to be or to thynk To the
qwych iowrdayn answeryt I Would not be other part than in the hewyn. Et the
dewyl answeryt I Would be so. Et master iowrdayn ashyt at him qweyr for Would
thou be. The dewyl answeryt thayr to that I might se the fays of my makar and
qwen the said brother had hard this / he fell to the earth Wepand so as he had
beyn rawyst in spreyt. Et after that he cum to him self he said to the dewyl
say to me qwhat paynys thou Would suffer Weyl thayr to that thou might se the
fays of thy makar. The dewyl answeryt. Certanly I Would be content to suffer all the paynys and to susteyn yt that all the dewyllys has tholyt from the howr that
they War castyng forth of the hewyn and the qwych they shall susteyn unto the
day of iugem^t et that I might se the cleyrte of the fays of god so as yt is.
To the qwych iowrdayn said I beleyf that thou art of the most nobyl dewyllys.
Et the dewyl said to him I have beyn of the ordyr of seraphyns the qwych ar
ewyr mor before the fays of god To the qwych master iowr dayn said / say to me
sum of the fays of god understanding that thou as seyn is fays so neyr. Et the
dewyl said to him I shall not be suffycyant for to say any thing of the said
cleyrte / always I shall say thing to the by symylytwd be the qwyche thou may
conprehend sum thing of the said cleyrte of the above said fays I say to the if
that all the flowrys qwyche as beyn et shall be Wn to the eynd of the World and
the greynes / fayrnes and beawlte of all the treys herbys qwyche as beyn et
shall be ewyr mor / et the cowleur and fayrnes of all the precyows stoonys and
metals et of al other shynant thyngys qwych ar above the eerth and that the
shynyng et cleyrnes of the soon and of the mown and of all the sterys qwych ar
in the hewyn et all the cleyrte of all the lyghtys the qwych as shynyt and shall
shyn sen the begi^nyng of the Woorld Wnto the eynd and that they shynyt al to
gydder in the earth al their cleyrte shoold be bot oon dyrk night to the regard
of the fays of god. O so much man myserabyl shall be qwyche lesys by is syn the
Wysyon of the above said fays et godly cleyrte.

THe segund dowayr of the saowl yes fruyccyon et delectacyon the qwych the
saowl shall have of the above said godly essens. For in the hewynly eerth of the
saowl thayr shall be oon right parfyt co^iunccyon of the saowl of ewyrych oon
bleshyt With god et With this thayr shall be oon right parfyt delectacyon be yt
also great in the thing possessyt as this thing is great / et god be oon thing
infynyt / ineffabyl et inco^prehensybyl followys that the delectacyon infynyt
the qwych as ewyrych oon bleshyt saowl to the Wysyon of god is vnmesurabyl /
ineffabyl et inco^prehensybyl after the capacyte of ewyrych oon bleshyt saowl
hauand fruyccyon et delectacyon. Et shall be the said delectacyon infynyt if the
capacyte of the saowl may tayk the thing infynyt. Et Werytably the said
fruyccyon shall not be egaly of oon ewyrychon bleshyt this the qwych shall not
cum no proceyd of the party of the obiec of the qwych the saowl shall have the
fruyccyon that is of god bot yt shall proceyd of the party et syd of the
saowllys hauand fruyccyon. Et certanly of so much that the bleshyt shall be mor
parfytly lyghtnyt of the light of gloyr et that they shall be maid be the said
illustracyo^ mor parfytly co^fyrmyt to god / of so mooch they shall co^tempyl
mor clerly and mor sharply the godly essens et majesty of god. Et shall delyt
the said saowllyes of the said bleshyt mor fully in the conte^placyon et
reme^brans of yt. Et this inco^prehensybyl dilectacyon that the above said
bleshyt as taykyn in the godly esse^s of god is clepyt fruycyon the qwych is
begung and taykyn in the right cleyr and shynant vysyon of god in the qwyche
they shall myrow them et behold of oon right parfyt low qwyche shall be i^ them.
Et as this cause al beatytwd is said to co^syst et be in the said Wysyon after
the saw et the Word of saint augustyn qwych says. Visio est tota merces. That
is to say / that the Wysyon of god is all the reward et the beatytwd of them
bleshyt. Et certanly the imme^syte of the godly cleyrte as drawyn to him self
be is greyt beawlte et be is vnmeswrabyl et excella^t sweytnes all the espreyt
qwych kepys and conte^plys i^ sych fachon that the spreyt also faylant and
forettant of him self berys et grantys of al his Wertu in the above said
cleyrte and godly Wysyon / et that spreyt qwyche also as absorbyt in the deyp
of the inco^prehensybyl light foretta^t in him self all this qwych is creat so
as deyfyet be oon mayner indycybyl yt Wnys yt self With god by Wnyon et
delectacyon inseperabyl et Wnfaylant / et for that says saint augustyn. That
the beawte and fayrnes of the godly fays is so fair et so ioysum and that the
iocu^dyte and delectacyon of the light ewyr lestand and of the immowabyl veryte
et sapyens so greyt qweyr he shall be et be possybyl to abyd in yt that be the
dwelling tym et spays of oon day oonly / earrys Wnnomerabyl of this present
live remplyshyt of al delylytes temporel gooddys shall be ryghtusly et With good
right dysprysyt for the abydyng i^ the above said joy not oonly for the the
spays of oon day bot for the spays of oon howr. Et of this says sant bernard.
That all the sweytnes and that the delytes are not bot sorrow / to the reward of
the joy of hewyn al Warldy joy is bot vepyng al erthly sweyt / nes bot
bytternes / al fayrnes bot Wncleynes / al thing that is delyt or joy i^ this
World is bot thing full of sorrow et full of melancoly to the regard of the
ewyrlesta^d joy of hewyn. As yt is be that the goodness of god exedys infynytly
al other goodness. Et saint augustyn says in the parson of god sayand to bleshyt
saowllys I shall be to the^ all that qwych may honestly be desyryt be the^ / for I
shall be to the^ live / copyows / salut / habowndans / glory / honowr / pays et
al goodys / and for so much he shall be al thyngys in all / he shall be the eynd of
al owr desyrs / he shall be live With out eynd / he shall be lowyt With out
noysumnes / he shall be lowyt With out traweyl / he shall be desyryt With out
hatrent or fatygacyon. Et he him self promysant to his good and faithful
serwytur. Moses says in exodi. Ego oftenda^ tibi omne bonum. That is to say /
I shall shaw the al good. Et in the book of sapyens. Desiderium iustorum omne
bonu^. That is to say / that the desyr of ryghtusmen is no other thing bot al
good. Et in oon other passayge. Desideriu^ suu^ justice dabitur. That is to say
/ that ryghtusmen shall have their desyr after this that says the propheyt. Et
indowtably all the desyr of bleshyt men shall be fulfyllyt qwen they have the
fruyccyon of the godly essens as says the propheyt. Saciabor cu^ apparuerit
gloria tua. I shall be content says the propheyt qwen the gloyr of god shall
appeyr to me / for otherwys mine appetyt may not befyllyt i^ this World. Et this
doys no thing qwych is Wryttyn in the ecclesyaftyk. Quis saciabiturvide^s
gloria^ der. Qwat shall he be qwych is fowl qwen he seys the glory of god / for
as ^ayd is. That their shall be in paradys oon refreshyng fruyccyon et
delectacyon the qwych shall content et fyl the appetyt With out any noysumnes
the auctoryte above said twechys ashand qwyche shall be he that shall be fyllyt /
that is to say noy sumnes i^ seeing the gloyr of god as the sayge said no man
may be noyt. Bot always their shall be oonfulnes and refeccyon of the desyr of
bleshyt men shall be plenyshyt of the right superhabowndant fowlnes of
dylectacyon and shall put away al mysterfowlnes. Et the desyr contynuel of the
fruyccyon shall put away al noysumnes. Et of the Wysyon the qwych the bleshyt
angels seys god / says sant Mathow. Angelieorum semper vide^t facie^ patris.
That is to say / that the angels seys ewyr mor the fays of god the father and
alwayees they desyr daily to se after the say of sant petyr. In que^ desiderant
angeli perspicere. Et of this syngys owr mother the holy church. Mirantur nec
deficiunt in illum que^ prospiciunt fruu^tur nec fastidiunt quo erui magis
sitiunt. That is to say / that the bleshyt angels et gloryows saowllys the
qwyche ar With god i^ the gloyr of hewyn et in live ewyrlestand / ewyrlestandly
they merweyl and defaylys not seyand the godly essens they have and yt noys not
to them newyr of this that they have mor great thryst and mor great desyr to se
god. We reed that thayr Was oon Woman possessyt of the dewyl of hell With in the
church of saint Petyr in cowllayn and thayr happinyt oon other voman possessyt
sychlyk of the dewyl the said two vomen did rys et left them self blamant of
oon and of oon other by great cryen gys and showtyngys. Et soon oon dewyl said
to the other vrechyt espreyt qweyr for ar ve heyr falling co^sentand to lucyfer
of the heuyn. Et the other said et answeryt / qweyr for art thou falling. Et
the other said to him Hold the peys cause not me to repent me / for this pe^nans
is ower layt. Et thayr Was oon holy man that hard them the qwych ashyt at them
qwat pennans he Would do thayr to that he might ascend in paradys. Et the dewyl
answeryt I promise the if that their War oon pyllar aleftyt from the eerth armyt
et full of resoyrs and of sherp naylyes right veyl sharpyt about and yt War so
that if I had body et flesh of man in the qwych I might suffyr et thool pain
sensybyl I am content to be drawyn from the hye to law rewyng brokyn et cowttyt
in this torment Wn to the day of judgment so that I might cu^ after the said
day of judgment to the gloyr / vysyon of god the qwych I have lost be my pride.
Et in this apperys cleyrly qwahat gloyr / qwahat dylectacyon as the blyshyt
saowllys i^ the reawm of hewyn. Et so as says sant ierom. Nullus labor durus /
nullum tempus longu^ videri debet quo gloria eternitatis acquiritur. That is to
say / that no lawbowr no any tym We shoold not thing long be the qwych the
ewyrlestand gloyr is acqwyryt et this is suffycyand as to the segund of the
saowl.

THe dowayr of the saowl gloryows is sowyr tencyon that is to say parfyt
possessyon of god the maykar With out any dreyd to leys yt. For the bleshyt
shoold not have perfyt beatytwd no they shoold not be callyt bleshyt if they
dreyd to leyf god qwych is al their beatytwd. Et certanly god qwych by is
largynes and is infynyt goodness as gheuyn the above said beatytud the qwych he
Will newyr tayk away from the blyshyt saowllys bot ghewys them sewyrte of
ewyrlestand gloyr. Et this sewrte et party of beatytud confermys all the other
partys of that beatytwd the qwych may not be had With out the said sewyrte and
the said sewrte is ordanyt i^ great transqwylyte of peys of the before said
bleshyd.

HEyr after ve have to se of the dowares and ghyftys of the bodies gloryows of
them bleshyt. Et certanly thayr is.iiij. that is to say cleerte /
i^passaybylyte / subtylyte / et agylyte. Et as yt is so that the form shoold be
proporcyonnet to the matter / the bodies beand dysposyt in the stayt of the
ryssyng to cum after the exygens of the saowllys Et as the bodies of da^nyt as
by ordynans of god dysposycyons answera^t to their vrechydnes. Sychlyk the
bodies of them blyshyt shall have dowayrs et propyrtes semand et porcyo^net to
their estayt so Weyl porcyo^net to the beatytud of saowllys With out empeschyng
of the deyd of gloyr. Et qwych mor is the said bodies gloryows shall be aleftyt
above the estayt of ewyrych oon bodyly creatur thayr to that be the beatytwd of
the said body gloryows ar of mor cressens. Et certanly the bleshyt shall be Wnyt
Wndepartanly to the body thayr to that the form incorruptybyl that is to say
the saowl confers et gheuys to be incorruptybyl to the body in the stayt of
incorrupcyon / not ageyns sta^nant the co^posycyons of the thyngys contraryows.
Et for this that the saowl gloryows shall be alestyt to the estayt of gloyr yt
shall be Weyl seyma^t that the body the qwych shall be Wnyst to yt be alestyt to
sych gloyr as yt is seymand to yt et be the qwych yt most be maid
proporcyonabyl to the saowl. Et thayr to that the body be sugest to the saowl
and that yt empesh not of the deyd of gloyr.iiij. thyngys ar reqwyryt of the
qwych two appartenys to the felyng et other two to the mowement. Et as to the
felyng is reqwyryt that the body be eythly resauabyl to / of the kyndys of
sensabylyte and of this dysposys the first dowayr of the body gloryows / that
is to understand clarte. The segund thing reqwyryt as to the felyng is that the
body gloryowes is not suggest to the passions to the qwych they War suggest in
the impassybylyte. Et as to the moweme^t two thyngys ar reqwyryt. The first is
that the said body gloryows resystys not be inclynacyon contrary to is motur /
that is to say to the saowl qwen yt Would mow the said body. Et to this
dysposys the dowayr of agylyte. The segund qwen any resyste^s be not to yt doyn
be the bodies and inwart thyngys and owtwars by meddys the qwyche he shall mow
to the qwych yes dysposyt the.iiij. dowayr / that is to Wnderstond subtylyte.
Of the orygynal birth of the said dowayrs says sum docturs that they shall
proceyd of almighty god be creacyon et that the said dowayrs shall be i^ the body
gloryows be redo^dans of the gloyr of the saowl i^ the body be the vay of the
beatitud of the saowl so as says sa^t augustyn expressyly et yt is ghana^t
dylygently to notyfy and consider sowtylly so as the bleshyt saowl haua^d
fruyccyon of the right cleyr vysyo^ of god shall be fyllyt of oon spyrytwel
cleyrte. Sych lyk shall be the body cled of al spyrytuellyte cleyrte of gloyr
competant by redundans of the cleyrte of the saowl to the said body. et is this
qwych says the appoystyl in the poystyl to the coryntye^s Seminatur corpus i^
innobilitate surget i^ gloria. That is to say the body of man is sawynet
co^sawyt i^ fylth and lymon et inwncleynes bot yt shall rys in gloyr For the
body the qwych yes now great et materyal et full of dyrknes shall be than gloryows
and cleyr so as says the appoystyl Reformabit corpus humanitatis nostre
co^figuratum corporis claritaties sue That yes to say that god shall reform in
beaty twd the bodies of owr humylyte fyguryd and maid to the body of is
clayrte. Et certanly as yt is so that oon thing may be said cleyr in two
mayners and for this that yt is cleyret shynant as oon steyrn / or for this
that yt is ower perant / et that We may se yt i^ the myddys so as ve do in oon
glays as or trow the cleyr Watyr. The gloryows bodies of bleshyt men shall be
cleyr in all the two mayners / that is to say shynant et right perant / for as
says sa^t gregoyr the corpulans of the body shall not empesh in the reawm of
hewyn that ewyrych oon bleshyt man may see the thought Will and intencyon of oon
ewyrych oon the qwych shall appeyr be for all et selfways shall the body be so
cleyr that the ermony of the body et organacyon of the menbrys / boonys / Wanys
et other subtyllytes ioynttes shall appeyr to them bleshyt. Sych Wys that oon
ewyrych oon may se et be hold him self / so Wytnysys sant augustyn i^ the book
of the cite of god / the qwych says that the menbrys and iuwert thyngys of the
gloryows bodies incorruptybyls the qwych ar now ordaynnyt to syndry necessytes
rys that thies that is owr faith holdys of great lyghtnes of the body gloryows
is not possybyl to god / et selfwayes the bemys of owr eyn in the lyftyng of
the^ the sight goyes unto the heuyn et of oon oo^ly stryp of the^ returnys holy
i^ the self. The.iij. perty of the beatytwd of the body is fors / for the body
gloryowes shall be so straight for if yt pleassys yt to mow all the earth yt may
this eythly do as the a^gels / no thing may empesh yt. Et if thou ashis at me
qwat shall profyt the above said fors abaydi^g than that al things shall be than
so veyl disposyt by god the maykar that they shall have no myster of holp no of
dreyd no of cha^gyng or owertwrni^g. I answer to the quistyon that the
possessyo^ et faculte of the said fors shall be to Ws thankful matyr et cause of
great exaltacyon thought yt be so that yt be not always necessayr after thies
that god shall put al thyngys in their estayt.

The.iiij. perty of the beatytud of the body is lyberte et fredowm be the qwych
them bleshyt may not be co^straynyt i^ any thing to do ageynes their vyl / no
to be forbyddi^g and defe^dyt to do With out yt be thayr plesyr. This the quych
mortel man may not do no have naturelly in this World. The.v. party of the
beatytwd of the body is health perfyt be the qwych the body shall not sufyr newyr
no thryst no ho^ger blyndynd no fawlt of heryng / fewyr no seyknes qwhat sum
ewyr. Bot shall be so heel that yt shall be newyr seyk / for thayr shall be sowerayn
and parfyt heelth The.vj. perty of beatytud appertenant to the body shall be
lowst / not yt that is in the flesh in the vsayge of bodyly thyngys / the qwych
things appertenys to the beystyly live and ar conmun so much to hoornyt
beystis as to us bot in peradys ar pleysa^s and delytynges and right hye /
right cleyn and right nobyl i^ the qwych We cowmun With the holy angels. Et the
qwych thyngys co^systys in the right Wysyon of god et right nobyl fruycyon the
qwych shall be co^mun to angels et to men so as says sant mathow. In
resurrectione neque nube^t neque nubentur sed sunt sicunt angeli dei. Et that
the bodies et saowllys gloryows Wsys not of bodyly meyttys no othyr thyngys yt
apperys by dowbyl rayso^ First for after this that the live corruptybyl shall be
put away and partyt is said of necessyte that the thyngys qwych seruys to the
live corruptybyl ar put away. Sen yt so that the vsayge of the two said things
that is to say to the bodyly noryshyng seruys to the live corruptybyl / thayr
to that the body maid abayd awyn and ghana^t qwantyte et that yt be co^seruyt
et keypyt in the being. Selfwayes to the Wsayge of the fleshly lowst is
necessayr i^ thyes World for the keeping of the kind of man the qwych may not be
kepyt in oon oonly suppost i^dywydabyl et morte if yt be so than that in the
live for to cum that al men shall be incorruptybyls yt followys that thayr shall
not be than any generacyo^ of mankind. Et certanly the bleshyt live shall be of
owergreyt and of much et goodly ar ordannyt than is this present live. For We
shall se that i^ this World is oon thing straight and Wycyows et bestyly for to
Wse of the said thyngys / that is to say of the bodyly noryshyng and of the
fleshly lowst for yt is oo^ly playsans and delectacyon. For be ordynans of the
law they shoold not Wse oonly for to susteyn the body. Et of the Werk of nature
oonly for to have lygnayge. Et Werytably the delectacyons the qwych ar i^ sych
Werkys are not the latter eyndys of the said accyo^s / for they shall have plays
for they shall not have no deferens ettwys the bestys irrayssonnabyls et the men
this that no man of good Wndersto^dyng Would not say et susteyn. Et if thou says
thayr is no auctorytes of the holy Wryt the qwych arlyk to say that they shall
eyt or drynk in paradys. For adam in stayt of innocens had live immortel Et
alwayees suppoes that he had abaydyd in the said stayt so he had vsyt of the
meyttys and fyllyt the Werk of nature. Et to this they may answeyr eythly that
adam i^ the stayt of innoce^s had oon parfeccyon parsonnal that Waes ghana^t to
the beginning of the lygnayge of man / bot yt Was not of al parfyt for this
that the natwr of mankind Was not begung by multiplycacyon of suppost and yt
Was ghanant that they engendryth for to multyply the nature of mankind. Et also
in the said stayt might adam die and not die / die if he synnyt so as he did / and
not die if he had abaydyn i^ the said estayt of innocens. Bot after the estayt
of the body nature humayn shall be perfyt and the nombyr of choysyn men compleyt
et maid parfyt / and as to this cause thayr shall be no mor myster of noryshyng of
generacyon. Et thayr is mor after the said resurrexyon the said bodies shall be
immortel qweyr for their is great dyfferens ettwys the immortalite of the said
adam in the stayt of innocens and yt of the body gloryows. Et if thou says to
me that jesus christ eyt after is resurrexyon. Certanly We say that he ettyt not
for cause of necessyte that he had / Bot for to shaw to his appoystyls the
Weryte of his resurrexyon. Et the meyt the qwych he tuk Was not twrnyt in
noryshyng of the flesh gloryows / bot also as absorbyt returnyt and resolut in
his preiacent et first nature. Et as this cause necessayr of eyttyng shall not be
i^ the reawm of hewyn. Et al auctorytes of the holy Wryt the qwych is lyk to
say and that shall have vsayge of drynkyng et eyttyng in paradys shoold be
Wnderstondyt spyrytwelly for the holy Wryt condyscendys to the smalnes of owr
Wndersto^dyng proposys to Ws and promysys spyrytwels things under the
symylytwd et lyknes of sensybyl thyngys so / aleftyt to the thyngys Wynknowyng
be the thyngyes knowyn so as that sapye^s is deuotyt et toykynyt in the holy
Wryt by the vsayge of meyttys. Miscuunt vinu^ et posuit me^sam. Et in oon other
plays is Wryttyn. Cibauit illum pane vite et intellectus.

This qwych is Wndersto^dyt of sapyens Et for that the auctorytes of the holy
Wryt Wnderstondyes spyrytwaly concludys not necessayrly no Werytably the Wsayge
of meyttys of bodyly so as so^ herytykys vold have said. Et qwen We find i^ the
holy Wryt. Quod christus post resurrexione^ cu^ suis discipulis bibit vinum
nouu^ yt is Wnderstondyt that he drank yt in oon new mayner not for necessyte
bot for Werytabyl showing of his resurreccyon so as said is. Et verytabyl all the accyo^s of the live actyf shall ceys after the reyssyng. Et shall not abayd
oonly bot the accyon of the live conte^platyf. The.vij. et last beatytwd of the
body gloryows shall be lo^geuyte / that is to say long live after this qwych is
Wryttyn i^ sant Luc. Cuius regni non erit finis. Et certa^ly thayr is no other
live no of other eynd bot to cum to the Wysyon of the godly essens the qwych is
infynyt. Et this suffycys of the said beatytwdys.

Thought yt be so that the holy docturs as Wryttyn syndry thyngys of the
precyosyte of the gloyr of peradys always the said docturs might newyr exsplyk
them suffycye^tly oon oonly joy of them that are bfeshyt / for their shall be
gheuyn to them bleshyt / syndry spu^el meyttys et right precyows the qwych god
has promysyt to is choysyn men. He promysys to the^ owthheyd With out eyld for
the men shall ryes i^ the age i^ the qwych jesus christ Was qwen he suffryt deeth
and passion for us in the.xxxiij. ear. Selfwayes they quych at the howr of
their deeth had.ix. c. viij. c. vj. hondreth ear shall ryes in the aage of the
jesus christ and also oon child of oon day of aage shall rys in the above said
aage. Et the rayson is for man shoold ryes to in the mor perfyt estayt of his
aage. Et for so much he that desyrys to be ewyr mor ong With out eyld he shoold
eyttel to the owthheyd in the qwych he shall newyr be hold. Et they that are
chargyt of eyld shoold have hop that they shall cum to the said estayt i^ the
qwych they shall have owtheyd With out eyld and ewyrlestand health With out any
debylyte / no passybylyte / for the body gloryowes may not be mor howrt than
the bemys of the sown and no thing shall noy to him this qwych is Wryttyn in the
appocalyps. Absterget deus omnem lachrimam. et cetes. For their shall be no
dowlewr / no deeth / bot ewyrlestand health the qwyche ewyr mor shall parseweyr.
Et in the said gloyr shall be rychess With out any powyrte habowndanes parfyt of
al thyngys / for thayr shall be ghewyn parfyt habowndans of al thyngys the qwych
has myster in this World.

Et certanly the rayson for the qwych oon man may not be fyllyt in this World
present of rychess / of honnowrs et of delytys / is for this that the saowl is
maid after god et may not be fyllyt unto this that yt cum to the exa^playr
after the qwych yt as beyn maid that is to god et so sown as yt is their yt is
content and fyllyt et this apperys be oon exampyl famylyer for if the Wax is
prentyt in any seel et be yt boorn be all the World et be the said Wax applykyt
to all the seellys of the World yt may not be propyrly ghanant bot to the first
seel / so yt is of the saowl maid to the image of god. The said bleshyt shall be
i^ ewyr lestand pays and sewrte / et i^ sweyt syngyng of angels et holy men the
qwych lowys and shall low god ewyrlestandly et contynualy after the saw of the
psalmyst

Beati qui habitant in domo tua domine insecula seculorum laudabu^t te. Sen yt
is so that yt be oon delectabyl thing to eyr in this World the sownd of
instrume^s of musyk the qwych sownd is of no thing estymyt in the regard of the
syngyng of the angel the qwych sweyttnees shall be thayr in hewyn to heyr the
syngyng and melody of all the holy men et angels of paradys. Et certanly if all the vorld var parchement et the sea ynk et all the layffys of treys and of
herbys War Wryttars With all the men qwych ar and as beyn and shall be they Would
fail first et before that they might exsprym oon oonly joy of the syngyng of
paradys qweyr god shall reward not oonly the good Werkys / bot vyth this / all this that man may thynk Weyl or as said Weyl et of that he has had pytye of the
Wrechydnes of his prochayn. Et certanly god shall reward all the fowt steppyes
that as beyn doyn for to do Weyl / et al this that have boyrn pacyens all the
sorows that they have suffert in their bodies / or in their membyrs / in their
eyn / in their heyd / in their han^ys and in their feyt / et al this generaly
that they have suffert pacye^tly for the ho^nowr and low of him. The other joy
of the gloyr and salwacyon of oon ewyrych oon holy man of the qwych no man Wayt
the nombyr after this qwych is Wryttyn in the appocalyps in the.vij. cheptur.
Vidi turbam magnam quam nemo dinumerare poterat.

That is to say I have seyn oon great multytwd of pewpyl the qwych may not be
nombryt. Et certanly oon ewyrych oon crystyn man shall have so great joy of the
oon ewyrych oon sa^t as he has serwyt god by two hondreth earrys et yt he has
not maid satyffaccyon to god for the joy the qwych he as had of the salvation
of oon oonly sant. For this that the charity the qwych is et shall be ettwys them
bseshyt is so deyp and so greyt that they hold the good Werkys et joys of
other blyshyt and santys to be thayr propyr joys for rayson of the great low
et charity the qwych they have ettwys them. Et Werytably sa^t petyr shall be
reioyt be gled of the Wyergynyte of sant ioonet sant ioon of the martyryng of
sant petyr et also of al other sa^tys the qwych as said is shall be gled oon of
