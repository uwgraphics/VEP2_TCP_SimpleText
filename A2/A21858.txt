By the Queen.
A Proclamation, inhibiting the execution of any exemplification of her
Majesty's grant of the penalty of the Statute for sowing of Hemp and Flax
seed.
THE Queens most excellent Majesty, understanding by the several complaints
of diverse her loving Subjects, that certain lewd and evil disposed persons,
pretending under color of a grant from her Majesty, to have power and
authority to execute the penalty of the Statute made for the sowing of Hemp
and Flax seed, do go about into diverse parts of this her Highness Realm,
carrying with them duplicats and exemplifications of that part of the Patent
only, which does concern that penal Statute, contrary to the purpose,
intent, and meaning of our said Sovereign Lady set down in the same grant,
and to the great offense of her Highness, the trouble and vexation of her
loving Subjects, and abuse of the chief Patentees, who pretend no such matter
by the same grant: Does of her Highness favor and Princely regard toward
the quiet and good of her said loving subjects, straightly charge and
command, and hereby also inhibite and forbid all persons whatsoever within
this her Highness Realm, that from henceforth they nor any of them, do
execute, cause to be executed, or put in execution, any such exemplification,
duplicate, or inrollement of the said grant or License, touching the
executing of the penalty of the said Statute made for the sowing of Hemp and
Flaxe-seede, at any time after the date of this her Highness Proclamation in
any place, or places whatsoever of this her Highness Realm, upon pain of her
Majesty's high displeasure, and of such further punishment, as by her Highness
Counsel, or by the laws of the Realm shall be inflicted and imposed upon them,
or any of them in that behalf.

And for the better execution of this her Majesty's Proclamation according to
her Highness will and pleasure in that behalf: her Majesty does further by
these presents, straightly charge and command all, and every Justices of
peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Cunstables, Hedboroughs, and all other her
Highness Officers and Ministers whatsoever, to whom in that behalf it shall
or may appertain, to apprehend, or cause to be apprehended all and every such
person and persons, which shall from henceforth bring or carry about with them
any of the said Exemplifications, Duplicates or enrolments, to the end to
execute the same, or any part thereof, in any City, Town, Borough, Village,
Hamlet, or other place or places whatsoever, within this her Highness Realm,
or the Dominion of Wales. And the same person or persons so attached and
apprehended, to send by unto her Highness privy Counsel, together with the
said Exemplifications, Duplicates or Enrolments, that thereupon such further
order may be taken for the punishment of every such offender, as the cause shall
require.

Given under our signet at Nonsuch, the four and twentieth day of July, in the
one and thirtieth year of our reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.

Anno 1589.
