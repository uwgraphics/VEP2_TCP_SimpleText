By the Queen. A Proclamation to forbid all manner of persons to resort to any
Towns held by the French Kings rebels, or to traffic with any of them, upon
pain to be punished as Traitors: with a declaration of the just causes of the
said prohibition. Given under her Majesty's signet at Greenwich the xiiij. day
of April 1591, and of her Majesty's reign the xxxiij. year.
THe Queens Majesty considering the continuance of the unnatural rebellion of
a multitude of the French kings Subjects in France, against their most
lawful king, heretofore king of Navarre, and now justly entitled Henry the
fourth king of France and Navarre, being recommended to the realm by the last
king before his death, in presence of all the Princes of the blood, and of the
rest of the Nobility of the Realm, to be his most lawful successor of the
Crown, and so immediately upon the death of the said late French king,
accepted and acknowledged by all the said Princes of the Blood, inheritable to
the crown, without exception of any one of the same princes Ecclesiastical or
Temporal: And in like manner from the death of the last king, served and obeyed
by all the ancient officers of the Crown, and namely by all the Marshals of
France, the principal officers of that Realm, and by the greatest part of
all the Noble men, governors of the Provinces. And that it now manifestly
appears, that this unnatural rebellion is favored by none of the ancient
birth of France, but by a very few of a strange blood, lately brought in, and
planted by marriages in France, being only branches depending of the house of
Lorraine, which is no natural member of the Crown of France to possess the
same: Therefore her Majesty has for these and many other causes in the sight
of Almighty God very just, and to the world most honorable, been moved to
yield to the said king her good brother and confederate, her favor, both in
approbation of his right, and wishing to him prosperity against his rebels, as
she thinks there is no Monarch, nor any Sovereign Potentate in all
Christendom but does the like, saving only one: who not contented with all
the kingdoms and dominions which his most noble father left him, by reason of
his abundant riches brought to him out of his Indies, attempteth to augment
his estate by encroching to himself the dominions of his neighbors. And for
that purpose, her Majesty has also according to such power as God has given
to her, and as she may conveniently yield with regard to her own estate,
given to the said most Christian king some succors, and so minds to continue
her favors, as manifestly has, and daily is seen, both to all strangers, and
to her own people, and by none misliked but by the rebels and the king above
described, who at this day is manifestly seen, that if he were disposed to
live in peace, and be contented with his own dominions, and not seek the
dominions of any others, Christendom were to enjoy an universal peace,
without any noise of war in any country or corner of Christendom. And now
her Majesty finding that this populer rebellion against the said king, is
fed and maintained in sundry Port Towns of France, and specially in
Normandy and Britain, where the people live by bringing to them foreign
merchandise, and by vent of their own, and by receiving of succors of
victuals and munitions of war from foreign countries, without which the
rebels in their Ports could neither continue their rebellion, nor yet relieve
their fellow rebels within the land: Has thought it meet, that although her
subjects ought in reason of themselves to have considered as much, to will and
charge, and so she does expressly will, charge, and command, all manner her
own natural Subjects, and all other persons resorting to her realm, to
forbear from repayring to any Port or Creek of Picardie, Normandy, or
Britain, where the Rulers of the same Ports or Creekes do not manifestly
obey the French king, and that in no manner, directly or indirectly, they do
carry or send any Merchandise, victual, or munition to any Port or Town, that
does disobey the French king, or do use any trade of buying or selling by
bartering or by exchange with any of the kings rebels, or with their adherents
either in France, or fraudulently here in England or elsewhere: upon pain
that whosoever shall attempt the contrary, the same shall be punished as
Traitors, and relieuers and succourers of her Majesty's enemies. For such her
Majesty does judge the said kings rebels to be, in that they have and do to
their power, declare themselves to be enemies to her Majesty and her
Subjects, as by their hostile actions against her Majesty's subjects, has in
many parts manifestly appeared. As in like sort also the king of Scotts her
good brother, and a friend and ancient Allie to the Crown of France, has
publicly declared himself an enemy to the said rebels, and (...) prohibited
his Subjects from trading in any sort with the rebels of France:
notwithstanding some of the heads of the rebellion, to his great misliking, are
by the house of Lorraine of kindred to him.

And because her Majesty is informed, that though many of her secretly evil
disposed subjects do outwardly show themselves not to have a mind to repair
to the ports possessed by the foresaid Rebels, but colourably do in her
Majesty's ports lade their wares, and make their entries with the officers of
the Customehouses, and take their cockets, as thereby to carry the same to the
ports of France which are known to obey the French king: Or sometimes lading
of vitailes, make their entries to repair only to other ports of the realm,
and sometimes to the isles of Iernsey or Garnsey, and yet most corruptly, and
against their loyalty, for gain or other corruption, they do craftily
repair with the said merchandise and vitailes, yea and by stealth with
munition, as powder, shot, copper, and other habislements of war, to the
ports manifestly held by the Rebels: For repressing of which abuse, her
Majesty charge and commands all her officers of her Customehouses, to have
good regard to the conditions of all that shall lade any wares to be
transported out of the realm by sea, or of vitaile from port to port. And if
they shall have any suspicion that the said wares or vitailes so to be laden,
might be carried to the Rebels towns in France, they shall not suffer any such
to depart with their lading, except the owners and laders shall both by their
corporal oath, and by bond with sureties to the double value of the things
laden, give assurance, and clear themselves of all suspicion, that no part of
their lading shall by them, or by any for them, be carried to any town of the
Rebels in France. And if any officers of the ports shall hereafter know, or be
informed of any being either the merchant, the owner, or the master of the
ship, or sailer, that shall offend to the contrary of this her Majesty's
proclamation, and shall not speedily give notice thereof to the Lord Treasurer
of England, or to the Lords of the Privy council, to the intent the persons
offending, and the ships also may be apprehended: such officer for concealing
thereof, shall lose all offices in the port for ever, and shall suffer close
imprisonment one whole year without bail, and yield such fine to her
Majesty, as his condition may endure. And if any Viceadmirall or his deputy,
shall know, or be informed of any person that shall offend to the contrary of
this proclamation, and shall not speedily give notice thereof to the Lord
Admiral, or in the Five ports to the Lord Warden, or to the Privy council:
the same person so concealing the same, shall loose his office for ever, and
suffer close imprisonment the space of one whole year, and likewise yield such
fine, as his condition shall endure.

God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
