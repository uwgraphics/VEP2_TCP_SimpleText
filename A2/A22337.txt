By the King.
A Proclamation for restraint of killing, dressing, and eating of Flesh in
Lent, or on Fish days, appointed by the Law, to be hereafter strictly observed
by all sorts of people.
WHereas, for the benefit and commodity of this Our Realm of England, as well
in the maintenance of Our Navy and Shipping (a principal strength of this
Island) as for the sparing and increase of Flesh victual, diverse good Laws and
Statutes have been provided, for the due observation of Lent, and other days
appointed for Fish days, which from time to time have been seconded and
quickened by sundry Our Proclamations, and other Acts and Ordinances of State;
And whereas, notwithstanding the many good provisions heretofore had and made
in that kind, We yet find the inordinate liberty, now usually taken by all
sorts of people to kill, dress, and eat Flesh in the Lent season, and on
other days and times prohibited by Law, is become an evil of such inueterate
growth, as it requires more then ordinary care to suppress the same:

We therefore much affecting the Reformation of this so great an evil (and
enemy to the plenty of Our Kingdoms) Have thought fit eftsoons (and thus
timely, the better to take away the excuse, and to prevent the provisions of
Flesh that usually men make against the Lent season) To express Our self and
Our Royal Commandment in this behalf: Wherein, without any future
declaration of Our pleasure in this kind, We shall expect and require from
all Our Subjects, that due Notice be taken, and that a strict and continued
obedience and conformity be yielded thereunto in all succeeding times.

And therefore We do straightly Charge and Command all and every person and
persons whatsoever, to whom it may appertain, carefully to provide and see,
that these Orders following may be duly observed and put in execution, upon
pain of Our high displeasure, and such penalties, as by the Laws of this Our
Realm may be inflicted upon the Offenders, for their contempt or neglect of Us
and Our Laws, whereof We shall show Our selves most sensible.

And first, whereas We find, that the chiefest cause of these disorders has
grown from the Licenses that have been granted to Butchers, to kill and utter
Flesh contrary to Law, And that by Our Laws, no Mayor, Justice of Peace, or
other person of what degree or quality soever, can grant any License in this
kind, And that the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, do by Our direction
forbear to grant the same, or give way thereunto; Our will and pleasure is
upon the penalties provided by Law, and such further punishment to be inflicted
upon the offenders, as shall be thought meet, that no such License shall be
granted for the killing or uttering of Flesh; And that no Butcher or other
person whatsoever, do by color thereof, kill, utter, or put to sale any Flesh
contrary to the Laws established and provided in that behalf.

And for the avoiding of such inconveniences hereafter, Our will and pleasure
is, That the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, and every other Officer and
Justice of Peace, shall call before them, and send for any of the servants of
any Inholders, Uictuallers, Cooks, Alehousekeepers, Tauerners, and keepers of
Ordinary tables, and such others that utter victuals, and to examine them upon
their corporal Oaths, what Flesh is, or has been, during the Lent season,
or other days prohibited by the Law, dressed, killed, uttered, or eaten in
their houses, which if they shall refuse to do, then to commit to prison the
said servants so refusing upon their Oaths to declare the truth.

That the Lord Mayor shall also yearly before Lent, or at the beginning
thereof, cause all Inholders, Keepers of Ordinary Tables, Uictuallers, Alehouse
keepers, and Tauerners within the City and Liberties thereof, to appear before
him, or such persons as he shall appoint meet for that purpose; And shall take
Recognizances with sufficient Sureties of every of them in good sums of
money, (viz.) One hundred pounds of the Principal, and their sureties thirty
pounds apiece, to Our use, not to dress any Flesh in their houses in the Lent
time, or at other times prohibited, for any respect, nor suffer it to be eaten
contrary to Law. The like Recognizance with Sureties, shall be taken of the
like parties upon like penalties, by the Justices of Peace of Our City of
Westminster, and the Liberties thereof; and every of the said Recognizances to
be certified into Our Exchequer.

And for the Butchers, and others that come with victual of Flesh out of the
Country into the City, Our pleasure is, That the Lord Mayor shall cause
certain persons to watch at the Gates and other like places in the Suburbs,
where Flesh may be brought, to view and search, and to intercept the same: And
if any of those Watchmen shall be found negligent and corrupt in his Charge,
then he to be committed to prison during the whole Lent.

And to the end that Fishermen may employ themselves to Sea with better
encouragement then heretofore, and that the Fishmongers may furnish themselves
with such store from time to time hereafter, as shall be expedient, as well for
the provision of the City, as for selling the same at reasonable Rates; We
will that they take notice of this Our Commandment, and constant resolution
for the observance of Lent, and Fish-dayes, both now and hereafter, as by Law
is required.

And furthermore, as We think it fit, that every man should be a rule of order
and abstinence in his own House, as well in respect of the public, as of his
private ease and benefit, So We straightly charge and command all Inholders,
Keepers of Ordinary Tables, Uictuallers, Alehouse-keepers, and Tauerners, not
to make any Supper for any person or persons whatsoever, upon Friday nights,
either in Lent or out of Lent; nor to suffer any meat to be then dressed,
uttered, sold or eaten in their Houses, upon pain of such punishment, as is
due to those that shall contemn Our Royal pleasure and Commandment.

And forasmuch as upon further advice and consideration had, that the restraint
of killing and dressing of flesh is no sufficient remedy for the mischief,
unless there be better care also taken to suppress the unlawful and
inordinate eating of Flesh in the time of Lent, and on other days and times
prohibited, wherewith Our subjects have accustomed themselves, rather for
delicacie then for necessity; It is therefore Our Royal will and pleasure, and
accordingly We do hereby straightly prohibit and forbid all Our Subjects of
what degree or quality soever within this Our Realm, to eat any manner of
Flesh in the time of Lent, or on other days now usually observed as
Fish-dayes, without a special License first obtained from the Bishop of the
Diocese, or such other as by the Law have power to give License in that
behalf, (which We will and command shall be sparingly granted, and in cases
of necessity only) upon pain of Our high displeasure, and to be proceeded
against by Our Attorney General in Our Court of Star Chamber, as contemners
of Our Royal Commandment, and upon such further penalty, as by the Laws and
Statutes of Our Realm may be inflicted on those that shall wilfully offend in
this kind.

And as these Orders are to be executed in Our City of London, and places near
to the same, so it is Our express pleasure and Commandment, That Our Justices
of Peace in all Shires within their Rule, and all other Majors, Bailiffes, and
chief Officers in Towns corporate, or in any Liberties within their
Precincts, shall cause the same to be observed and performed in like manner;
and that no manner of Toleration, Favor, or Conniuencie be used by any Justice
of Peace, or other Officer, contrary to the true meaning of this Our
Proclamation, as both they that shall presume wittingly so to tolerate the
offense, as also the party himself offending, will answer the same at their
uttermost perils: Our Commandment being, That Our Laws in this case shall be
hereafter severely executed upon all offenders whatsoever.

Further charging and commanding the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, the
Justices of Assize in their several Circuits, the Majors and chief Officers
of all other Cities and Towns corporate, Justices of Peace, Lords of
Liberties, and all other Officers and Ministers within the several Counties of
this Our Realm, That they and every of them fully obey this Our Pleasure, and
cause and compel the same to be obeyed and executed by others, as they will
answer the contrary at their uttermost perils.

And for the due execution of the Premises in all other the Counties of this
Our Realm, as well as in Our Cities of London and Westminster, We do hereby
straightly charge and command all Our Justices of Peace within the same Counties,
as well within Liberties as without, That yearly and every year hereafter
before Lent, they cause to come and appear before them all Inholders, Cooks,
Tauerners, Alehouse-keepers, Butchers, and other Uictuallers whatsoever, and to
require and take of them to Our use, several Recognizances, with Sureties, for
observation of the premises, (viz) The principals in ten pounds, and their
two Sureties in five pounds apiece: And if they shall refuse or neglect to
enter into such Recognizances, then the said Justices shall suppress such
persons so refusing, from victualling any more, and shall also cause them
forth with to become bound by Recognizance with Sureties to our use, (viz) The
principals in twenty pounds, and their two Sureties in ten pounds apiece, not
to Uictuall or sell Beer or Ale from thencefoorth, which if they shall refuse
to do, then the said Justices to commit to prison all such persons so refusing
to enter into such Recognizances, until they shall submit themselves, and
become bound, as aforesaid. And further for-all such Inholders, Cooks,
Tauerners, Alehouse keepers, Butchers, and other Uictuallers as shall not
appear before the said Justices, as aforesaid, That they immediately send
forth their Warrants, or grant process against them and every of them so
making default, to appear and answer their contempt at the next general
Sessions of the Peace.

And further, for the more due punishment of Inholders, Keepers of ordinary
Tables, Cooks, Butchers, Uictuallers, Alehouse keepers, Tauerners, and such
like, who shall forfeit their Recognizances by killing or dressing of Flesh, or
suffering it to be eaten in their houses in the Lent time, and other Fish
days, And to the end that the same may be as well taken in due form of Law,
as duly certified into Our Exchequer, We do will and require all Justices of
peace, as well within Liberties as without, That at such times as they shall
meet within their several Divisions, for the taking of such Recognizances, that
they give notice to the Clerks of the Peace, or their Deputies, to attend them
for that purpose. Of whom we will require a strict Account for the Legal
taking and returning of the same Recognizances into Our said Exchequer: The
said Clerks of the Peace and their Deputies, taking for the making and
certifying of the same Recognizances of all Inne-keepers, Tauerners, Cooks,
and Butchers, the Fee of two shillings six pence; And of all Alehouse-keepers
the Fee of twelve pence, as is limited to be taken by the Clerk of the Peace
for Our County of Middlesex for every such Recognizance, and no more.

And lastly, for that the Fishmongers (upon the observation of the aforesaid
Orders) may perhaps take occasion thereby to enhaunce the prices, as well of
Fresh, as of Sea Fish, we do therefore hereby further charge and command all
Fishmongers whatsoever, That they sell and utter their Fish at moderate and
usual Rates and prices; And that all Justices of Peace, Majors, Bailiffes, and
other Our Officers, as well within Liberties as without, to whom it shall
appertain, shall from time to time take such order with the said Fishmongers,
that Our Subjects be not grieved by any such enhauncement or increase of prices
upon Fish, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such further punishment as
may be inflicted upon them by Our Laws.

Given at Our Court at Newmarket the seventh day of February, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save
the King.
